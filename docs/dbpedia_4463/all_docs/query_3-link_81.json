        "text": "Renewal forms not received cannot be resent. However, you may renew your license plate without a renewal form on Online Services or at our self-service stations if your insurance can be verified electronically. You may also renew without the renewal form at any Secretary of State branch office. Documents needed for renewals are:\n\nOld registration for each registration (or plate configuration)\n\nProof of Michigan no-fault insurance for each registration\n\nDriver's license\n\nCash, check, money order, or a Discover, MasterCard or Visa debit or credit card.\n\nYou may also mail a photocopy of your current registration, proof of valid Michigan no-fault insurance, and a check or money order payable to the State of Michigan to:\n\nMichigan Department of State\n\nInternal Services Section\n\n7064 Crowner Drive\n\nLansing, Michigan 48918\n\nOnline\n\nGo to Online Services and then to Vehicle Services. If you go to ‘More Online Vehicle Services’, you can renew your license plate and submit a one-time mailing address so that your new tab and registration can be mailed directly to you. Tabs and registrations renewed using the Quick Renewal option will be mailed to the vehicle’s residential address on record.\n\nBy mail\n\nSend a photocopy of your current registration, proof of valid Michigan no-fault insurance, and a check or money order payable to the \"State of Michigan\" to:\n\nMichigan Department of State\n\nRenewal by Mail Unit\n\n7064 Crowner Drive\n\nLansing, Michigan 48980\n\nInformation about your renewal fee can be obtained by calling 517-636-5872. Please provide an out-of-state address if you want your registration receipt and new license plate tab mailed to you while you are out-of-state.\n\nUnder Michigan law, you are obligated to have a valid license plate and registration for your vehicle. Therefore, whenever you are issued a new license plate and tab, you must put them on your vehicle as soon as you receive them. Your old plate is cancelled once the new one is assigned to you - no matter when your old plate was set to expire. There is no grace period under Michigan law. If you continue driving with your old plate, the license plate and tab on your vehicle will not match what is on file with the Secretary of State. This may be considered an improper plate violation. It could result in a ticket from law enforcement, a fine and having your vehicle impounded. Registration and insurance. Always make sure to have the proper registration and insurance certificates with you when driving. Failure to do so can result in tickets.\n\nLicense plate fees for 1984 or newer model year passenger vehicles and light trucks are calculated using a percentage of the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) at the time the vehicle is first titled. This is also known as the base price. It is then reduced by a percentage of that registration fee for the following three years. Under the present law, no further reduction is provided.\n\nIf the vehicle is older than 1984, the fee is based on the weight of the vehicle. You may contact our Information Center at 1-888-SOS-MICH (1-888-767-6424) and someone will help you figure the fee for your particular vehicle, or visit a Secretary of State branch office for assistance.\n\nOn individually owned passenger vehicles, pickup trucks, and vans, the license plate expires on the owner's birthday. For vehicles owned by more than one person, either owner's birthday may be used as the expiration date. If the license plate expiration date is not on one of the owner's birthday, it can be changed at renewal time at the request of the owner. A new license plate fee will be calculated for the new expiration date. Changes to plate expiration dates must be submitted at a Secretary of State office.\n\nSchedule an office visit\n\nWhen you move, you must change the address on your driver's license as soon as possible. A change of address may be submitted at a Secretary of State office, online through online services or by mail using the change-of-address form. Until all system upgrades can be completed, changing the address on your driver’s license will not update the address on your vehicle registration. Changing your driver’s license address will update the address for your voter registration.\n\nWhen you renew your license plate by mail and the address needs to be corrected, check \"yes\" for a change of address on the front of the renewal notice and write your new address on the back of the form in the space provided. This will alert the Michigan Department of State to correct the address when renewing your registration. If you are renewing your vehicle registration online and you are logged into your account, then you may also submit a change of address at the same time. Change of address cannot be submitted when using the Quick Renewal option.\n\nVeteran plates are available in the standard Pure Michigan design. Campaign and Service Medal Veteran plates are available for veterans who have served in Afghanistan, Iraq and Vietnam and earned a medal. Veterans must provide their Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty form (DD-214), indicating a medal award, for a Campaign or Service Medal Veteran plate. The official Service Medal Award Certificate issued by any of the Armed Forces branches will also be accepted for the Vietnam Service Medal plate. Veteran plates may be ordered at any Secretary of State office or by mailing in a completed Application for Veteran Plate form.\n\nThe latest in graphic plates, the Mackinac Bridge plate offers residents a chance to show their state pride in a way that is Pure Michigan. Featuring one of the most iconic of Michigan landmarks, the Mackinac Bridge is featured front and center on this beautifully designed plate. It is available in disability and personalized versions and for motorcycles. A one-time fee of $5 is charged when purchasing a plate (in addition to any other registration or fees that may apply). Order it at any Secretary of State office, on at Online Services or by mail. The Mackinac Bridge plate replaces the Spectacular Peninsulas plate, which is being slowly phased out.\n\nYou may transfer a license plate issued in your name at any Secretary of State branch office. You will need your current registration or license plate number, your title to the vehicle to which you want to transfer the license plate (your copy of the title application will be sufficient if you recently applied for your title), a $10 transfer fee and a $5 stand alone transaction fee will be due. Additional fees may be due if transferring a plate to a different type of vehicle (such as from a car to a motor home). Additional fees will be due if you apply for a new title at the same time. The owner of the registration must be one of the owners shown on the title. If you are purchasing a vehicle from a Michigan dealer, the dealer will handle the plate transfer for you.\n\nYour registration receipt will show the license plate number and the vehicle to which your license plate is registered. If any of this information is incorrect, you should visit a Secretary of State branch office for assistance or check with our Information Center at 1-888-SOS-MICH (1-888-767-6424) for further information. Some corrections, such as for name or vehicle information, may require that you also bring in the vehicle title.\n\nThe number and letter configurations used on Auto Centennial plates are not used on any other type of plates and therefore may be incorporated into a personalized plate. Owners of an Auto Centennial plate who wish to personalize a different type of plate using the number and letter configuration of their Auto Centennial plate may do so before the plate expires. The original personalized plate service fee is due in addition to the regular renewal fee. Once the Auto Centennial plate expires, the number and letter configuration are no longer reserved to the original owner and anyone seeking a personalized plate may use them.\n\nTo request replacement registration for a vehicle, watercraft, snowmobile, or moped, select Online Services, and follow the prompts to create or log into your account to print a duplicate copy of your registration.\n\nMake sure to have the license plate number or registration number ready. There is no fee for a duplicate vehicle registration. A duplicate watercraft or moped registration is $2 and a duplicate snowmobile registration is $5.\n\nGo to Online Services\n\nAllow at least 14 days when renewing a license plate online or by mail. A branch office can process your renewal immediately (proof of Michigan no-fault insurance will be required), but at least two weeks is needed when renewing by these alternate systems. Many Secretary of State offices and other locations also feature a Self-service station - another convenient method for immediately renewing license plates. You must have insurance that has been electronically verified indicated on your renewal notice and pay by credit card to use a Self-Service Station. (Note: Please refer to the Frequently Asked Question topic of \"New Standard and Spectacular Peninsulas Plates\" for information about renewing a standard license plate.)\n\nKeep your valid registration and insurance certificate with you when driving. Neglecting to carry your vehicle's registration and insurance certificate are two more violations that can result in tickets, fines and fees.\n\nIf you are using a license plate frame, please make sure that it does not cover or obscure any of the information on the plate or tab.\n\nAt the start of 2007, some of the state's license plates were inadvertently stamped with the two bottom bolt holes slightly out of line. This problem was immediately corrected. It may not be possible for you to use all four bolts if you have one of these plates. However, your plate will still be held securely on your vehicle even if you use only the top or bottom two bolts. If you have any questions about your plate or are having trouble fastening it to your vehicle, please contact the Department of State Information Center at (888) SOS-MICH; (888-767-6424).\n\nYou may obtain a replacement license plate at a Secretary of State office. Bring the vehicle registration or the license plate number and your identification. A replacement plate and tab will be issued for $5, along with a new registration. Additional fees are due if you personalize your replacement plate or if you purchase a different type of plate.\n\nIf your plate was stolen, contact your local police or sheriff's office. The agency will enter a message into the Law Enforcement Information Network alerting officers that the plate was reported as stolen.\n\nA license plate can only be replaced by the vehicle owner, by a member of the owner's family living at the same address or by a representative of the owner with an Appointment of Agent form completed by the vehicle owner.\n\nA vehicle can be titled in your name without a license, but to maintain the registration and plate there will need to be a licensed adult listed on the registration. There cannot be a registration hold on your record. You may also wish to contact your insurance company for any requirements it may have.\n\nUnder Michigan law, you are obligated to have a valid license plate and registration for your vehicle. Therefore, whenever you are issued a new license plate and tab, you must put them on your vehicle as soon as you receive them. Your old plate is canceled once the new one is assigned to you - no matter when your old plate was set to expire. There is no grace period under Michigan law. If you continue driving with your old plate, the license plate and tab on your vehicle will not match what is on file with the Secretary of State. This may be considered an improper plate violation. It could result in a ticket from law enforcement, a fine and having your vehicle impounded.\n\nIf it's been more than 30 days since you renewed, create or log into your online Secretary of State account or contact the Michigan Department of State to verify the address on your vehicle registration.\n\nIf your address is incorrect, you can update it and order a new set of tabs for $5 online, at a Secretary of State office, or by calling our department. If your address is correct and it's been more than 30 days since you renewed, request a set of replacement tabs by calling our department or visiting a Secretary of State office. If you renewed by mail, track processing of your renewal by monitoring the account from which you submitted payment by check or money order. Once payment has been withdrawn, your renewal has been processed.\n\nUpon renewing your tab and license plate, your vehicle registration will be updated automatically in the state record system, which can also be accessed by law enforcement.\n\nPassenger vehicles, vans, and light trucks must have proof of Michigan No-Fault insurance to be registered and renewed in Michigan. Out-of-state insurance policies cannot be used to meet Michigan insurance requirements for registering a vehicle. Motorcycles must also be insured, but it doesn’t need to be No-Fault insurance.\n\nKeep your Michigan No-Fault insurance certificate in your vehicle or carry it with you when you drive. Failure to present proof of valid Michigan No-Fault insurance while driving a vehicle could result in the suspension of your license. Your license plate could also be canceled if proof of insurance isn’t provided.\n\nIf you use your vehicle seasonally and it will be kept in storage when your plate and registration expire, you can either renew it up to 6 months early or provide proof of your storage/comprehensive insurance policy and valid Michigan No-Fault insurance policy to renew after the expiration.\n\nBring your plate to a Secretary of State office and let the greeter know you have a damaged plate. The $5 plate replacement fee may be waived if the manager determines the plate is damaged because of a manufacturing defect.\n\nDamaged plates are canceled on system after they have been brought to our attention. If you don’t bring the plate to a Secretary of State office for disposal, you may destroy it by cutting it up or bending off a corner so that it can no longer be used.\n\nEarly: You can renew your registration, tab and license plate up to six months in advance of their expiration.\n\nExpiration date: In most cases, your tab and license plate will expire on your birthday. If your birthday falls on the weekend or a legal holiday, you have until the next business day to renew your tab and plate without penalty.\n\nAfter expiration (additional fees apply): If you don't renew your registration, tab and plate on time, you will be charged an added $10 fee and risk being ticketed or fined by law enforcement for driving on expired registration. Renewal fees for expired plates are not prorated. The amount shown on your renewal notice doesn't change if the plate is renewed after it expires."
