If you choose to use the Waterfront station, United asks that any arriving fans be good neighbors and be mindful of noise when walking on residential streets.\n\nYou can get to Audi Field from both the Navy Yard-Ballpark and Waterfront Metrorail Stations. Signs will be available to direct you. Navy Yard Station has more capacity, more sidewalk space, and plenty of restaurants along the walk to the stadium. If you choose to use Waterfront Station, be mindful of noise when walking near the residential neighborhoods. Navy Yard Station is one stop on the Green Line from the Anacostia Metrorail Station. Parking is available at the Anacostia Metrorail Station. If you are walking from a parking garage/lot in the area, you should use the recommended routes for transit riders.\n\nThe Audi Field Bike Valet will be free to any fans who wish to store their bike during the match. The valet is at the southwest corner of the stadium at the intersection of 2nd and T St. The valet opens when gates open and will remain open at least one hour after the end of a match.
