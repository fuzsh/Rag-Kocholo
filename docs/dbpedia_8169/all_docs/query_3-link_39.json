        "text": "In 'Deal or No Deal Island,' 13 players compete in challenges to secure briefcases, which later become values on the board.\n\nBy Kelly Corbett\n\nUpdated March 11 2024, 1:23 p.m. ET\n\nThink Deal or No Deal meets Survivor! NBC's beloved game show Deal or No Deal is back with an exciting new spinoff: Deal or No Deal Island.\n\nHosted by Joe Manganiello and executive produced by Howie Mandel, Deal or No Deal Island premiered on Feb. 26. It transported 13 players to the Banker’s private island (located in Panama), where so far, they've had to plunge through mud lagoons and scale trees for arrows, among grueling challenges in order to locate the game's iconic silver briefcases.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nThese briefcases are hidden around the island and are worth over $200 million in prize money, split between them. During the day, players compete for these cases, hoping to get the case with the highest value, which will give them immunity or at least one of the higher values available. This is because the contestants with the briefcases with the two lowest values will automatically land themselves in the bottom two.\n\nThe player with the highest value then decides who from the bottom two will enter the \"The Banker's Temple\" that night and play. If the chosen player in the game accepts a lower offer than the value in their case, they're eliminated. But, if they make a smart deal and accept an offer higher than their case value, the power is in their hands, and they get to select who to eliminate.\n\nSo, who are these 13 brave competitors? Below, we share everything we know about the Deal or No Deal Island players, including their Instagram handles.\n\nDawson Addis\n\nDawson Addis is a realtor who lives with his boyfriend in Muskego, Wis.
