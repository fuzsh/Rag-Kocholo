        "text": "AMST 1000.10: Zombie Capitalism\n\nCRN: 86864 // D. Orenstein\n\nW 12:45-3:15 PM\n\nThe Walking Dead. World War Z. “Zombie Banks.” Why does the specter of the living dead loom so largely in contemporary U.S. culture? How is it useful? What does it illuminate about the relationship between capitalism and democracy that might otherwise remain inscrutable? And how has it served in this allegorical manner throughout modern U.S. history? How did it haunt the rise of mass production, or the growth of suburbs, or the eruption of a social movement like Occupy Wall Street? To answer such questions, in this seminar we will screen one film per week, supplemented by brief readings in primary sources, to track the figure of the zombie from the Great Depression to the Great Recession (or, now, the Great Depression 2.0), and from the sugar plantations of Haiti to the tents of Zuccotti Park and the COVID-19 morgues of Detroit.\n\nAMST 1050.10: National Bodies\n\nCRN: 86784 // N. Ivy\n\nMW 11:10-12:25 PM\n\nWho makes up the body politic? How have discussions of citizenship and belonging been mapped onto ideas about biology and difference? To approach these questions, this course explores of how representations of the physical form as well as ideas about what constitutes appropriate bodies are shaped by U.S. cultural, political, social, and economic discourse. Assigned texts will present specific theoretical emphasis on race, gender, sexuality, labor, ability, and class.\n\nAMST 1050.11: Gender & Environmental Politics\n\nCRN: TBA // M. Henderson\n\nTR 2:20-3:35 PM\n\nThis interdisciplinary seminar addresses major questions at the intersection of gender and the environment, tracking developments in feminist, queer, and environmental theory and activism. Throughout the course, we will attend to gender’s relationship to race, sexuality, nationality, class, and disability. The course will focus on topics including environmental health, colonialism and empire, and environmental and climate (in)justice, and will include readings by Rachel Carson, Naomi Klein, and Octavia Butler. Alongside academic scholarship, we will explore these ideas through film, podcasts and literature.\n\nAMST 1100.10: Politics & Film\n\nCRN: 82329 // E. Anker\n\nM 12:45-2:00 PM & 7:10-9:40 PM\n\nThis class addresses the relationship between politics and film by examining how American films interpret and challenge political power in America. We pair film analysis with readings in political theory to interrogate the operations of power in political life. Exploring films thematically, first we examine those that shape conventional interpretations of political power in America, including concepts of limited government, popular sovereignty, and liberal individualism. Next, we consider films that challenge these ideas by offering alternate conceptions of how power functions, while addressing questions of ideology, surveillance, domination, and biopolitics. The last section investigates particular genres—melodrama, the western, and film noir—that reshape and rearticulate these themes within American political culture. Throughout, we will focus on how to read the visual language of film and the written texts of political theory. Students must also register for a discussion section to satisfy the course requirement.\n\nAMST 2010.80: Early American Cultural History\n\nCRN: 81723 // N. Ivy\n\nMW 2:20-3:10 PM\n\nThis course starts with the argument that understanding culture is key to understanding American history. Culture can refer to art and literature—some of which we will explore in class. However, culture can also refer to popular forms of expression, including the way people act. With this broader perspective, we will study some of the major scholarship addressing the evolution of American culture—from the Colonial period through Reconstruction. For example, we will look at what scholars have to say about why minstrel shows were popular and about how Indian captivity narratives were used to justify the conquest of the West. To shape our analyses, we will examine old newspapers, read popular literature, and explore the museums here in Washington, DC—then develop our own opinions and arguments as we engage in small group discussions and complete class assignments. This is an upper division course, but it is geared toward freshmen and sophomores who are looking for a challenge. Students must also register for a discussion section to satisfy the course requirement. Same as HIST 2010.\n\nAMST 2440W.80: The American City\n\nCRN: 87182 // S. Osman\n\nTR 9:35-10:25 AM\n\nThis introduces students to the exciting field of urban studies. Students will explore the political, architectural and cultural history of American cities, with a particular focus on Washington DC. Students will tackle urban planning and policy debates about topics such as urban renewal, sprawl, public housing, policing and gentrification. The course will include works by a range of urban writers such as Jane Jacobs, Mike Davis, Neil Smith, William Julius Wilson and clips from the TV show “The Wire.”\n\nAMST 2490.10: The Politics of Care\n\nCRN: 87189 // J. McMaster\n\nTR 3:45-5:00 PM\n\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, people everywhere seem to be talking about care: self-care, collective care, care for the environment and nonhuman others. The reality is that everyone requires care to live. But what exactly is care? How is it distributed in our households, our city, our country, and across the globe? Who tends to receive it and who is disproportionately tasked with the undervalued work of providing it to others? This course will turn to critical theories of race, feminist philosophy, disability studies, and queer/trans scholarship for answers to these questions and others pertaining to the politics of care.\n\nAMST 2490.11: Dinner with Marx\n\nCRN: 87190 // D. Orenstein\n\nW 5:00-7:30 PM\n\nSome have called it the greatest novel of the nineteenth century. It has been translated into hundreds of languages, from Amharic and Bengali to Yiddish and Zulu; this September it is appearing in a new English translation. Published in 1867 (in German), Karl Marx’s first volume of Das Kapital: A Critique of Political Economy—the only volume of the three that Marx himself completed before his death—remains an inescapable and prescient text, for its mode of analysis as much as for its historical materialist account of the world system of capitalism. In this seminar we will read Volume One cover to cover, two to three chapters per week, over dinner for those who feel so inclined. No prior knowledge is required! But instructor approval is, because space is limited. Go to https://dinnerwithmarx.paperform.co to fill out an enrollment form.\n\nAMST 2710.80: The United States in the World\n\nCRN: 87191 // M. McAlister\n\nTR 12:45-1:35 PM\n\nThis course examines US history from 1898-present in terms of its cultural and political relationships with the world beyond US borders. We will consider, among other things, US state and military power, globalizing cultures, transnational ideas and social movements, travel and tourism, and the impact of media in the context of US global power.\n\nAMST 2730W.80: World War II in History and Memory\n\nCRN: 87196 // T. Guglielmo\n\nMW 9:35-10:25 AM\n\nThis course examines Americans’ World War II experiences and how those experiences have been studied, debated, understood, and “remembered”—officially, culturally, and personally. Through a mix of reading, writing, and discussion, it focuses on six overlapping topics: GIs, the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japanese American internment, African Americans, the Holocaust, and women.\n\nAMST 3600.30: Popular Music & Politics\n\nCRN: 87199 // G. Wald\n\nTR 2:20-3:10 PM\n\nThis interdisciplinary course explores the interactions and intersections of music and politics, focusing on the 20th-century United States. It has units on music and the U.S. state, music and social protest movements, and music and freedom. For spring 2021, there will be new course material on music and #BLM and music and queer/trans/non-binary identities.\n\nAMST 3900.10: Critiquing Culture\n\nCRN: 82930 // G. Wald\n\nTR 11:10-12:25 PM\n\nThis course provides an introduction to the major theories and methods that define the field of American studies. In particular, we seek to understand the elusive yet omnipresent world of “culture”—the values, symbols, myths, ideas, ways of life, and systems of meaning that shape our identities and worldviews.\n\nAMST 3950.80: Democracy and American Political Culture\n\nCRN: 87658 // E. Anker\n\nM 3:30-6:00 PM\n\nThis class will examine major concepts, practices, and cultural visions of democracy in the United States (and in a transnational context). Democracy is one of the most widely-valued systems for organizing politics and political culture, yet there is significant disagreement about the core ideals and practices that comprise it. This class will examine a variety of cultural, literary, and theoretical texts on the promises and perils of democracy in the US. As this is an election year, we will also explore visions of presidential power.\n\nAMST 3950W.81: Black Women in 21st Century\n\nCRN: 87860 // AK Wright\n\nT 12:45-3:15 PM\n\nAn interdisciplinary approach to critical inquiry into the scholarship on, and status of, Black women in North America, the Caribbean, Latin America, and Africa in the twenty-first century; historical, national, and transnational linkages between Black women; responses to intersectionality; analyses, strategies, and actions being deployed by and about Black women in action and scholarship. Includes a significant engagement in writing as a form of critical inquiry and scholarly expression to satisfy the WID requirement.\n\nAMST 4500W.10: Proseminar in American Studies\n\nCRN: 83722 // E. Bock\n\nTR 5:15-6:30 PM\n\nDirected research and writing on special topics. May be repeated for credit provided the topic differs. Includes a significant engagement in writing as a form of critical inquiry and scholarly expression to satisfy the WID requirement.\n\nAMST 4500W.11: Proseminar in American Studies\n\nCRN: 87660 // E. Bock\n\nTR 12:45-2:00 PM\n\nDirected research and writing on special topics. May be repeated for credit provided the topic differs. Includes a significant engagement in writing as a form of critical inquiry and scholarly expression to satisfy the WID requirement.\n\nAMST 1000.10: Entertainment Nation\n\nCRN: 98635 // S. Silver\n\nT 12:45-3:15 PM\n\nIn 2023, the Smithsonian National Museum of American History unveiled its new exhibit “Entertainment Nation,” just blocks from GW’s campus. This seminar invites students to engage critically with this exhibit, which includes artifacts from Dorothy’s ruby slippers to Ali Wong’s “Baby Cobra” dress, covering a wide range of entertainment forms in theater, television, film, music, stand-up comedy, and sports. We will examine how history is written, how historians present their ideas to the public, and how the arrangement of those ideas and artifacts make an argument. Students who are fans of music, comedy, and television will be introduced to scholarship on these topics, as we learn to think critically about the role entertainment has played in U.S. history, engaging in questions of empire, citizenship, and national identity. This seminar will introduce students to some of the major questions in American Studies—How can we think globally about “American” history? What is the relationship between the individual and the popular? How does media technology shape popular culture? What are the politics of spectatorship and display? How have U.S. entertainment cultures perpetuated white supremacy and racial subjugation? And, in contrast, how have racialized performers mobilized entertainment to demand freedom? In analyzing the exhibit’s contents and interpretation, we will examine how studies in LGBT/queer history, Black history, Latine history, and Indigenous histories have shaped the exhibit, while engaging theories in media studies, performance studies, popular music studies, and public history to interpret U.S. entertainment cultures.\n\nAMST 1000.11: Zombie Capitalism\n\nCRN: TBA // D. Orenstein\n\nW 12:45-3:15 PM\n\nThe Walking Dead. World War Z. “Zombie Banks.” Why does the specter of the living dead loom so largely in contemporary U.S. culture? How is it useful? What does it illuminate about the relationship between capitalism and democracy that might otherwise remain inscrutable? And how has it served in this allegorical manner throughout modern U.S. history? How did it haunt the rise of mass production, or the growth of suburbs, or the eruption of a social movement like Occupy Wall Street? To answer such questions, in this seminar we will screen one film per week, supplemented by brief readings in primary sources, to track the figure of the zombie from the Great Depression to the Great Recession (or, now, the Great Depression 2.0), and from the sugar plantations of Haiti to the tents of Zuccotti Park and the COVID-19 morgues of Detroit.\n\nAMST 1050.11: National Bodies\n\nCRN: 96622 // N. Ivy\n\nTR 11:10-12:25 PM\n\nWho makes up the body politic? How have discussions of citizenship and belonging been mapped onto ideas about biology and difference? To approach these questions, this course explores of how representations of the physical form as well as ideas about what constitutes appropriate bodies are shaped by U.S. cultural, political, social, and economic discourse. Assigned texts will present specific theoretical emphasis on race, gender, sexuality, labor, ability, and class.\n\nAMST 2011.80: Modern American Cultural History\n\nCRN: 95456 // G. Wald\n\nMW 12:45-1:35 PM\n\nThis course examines the history of the United States from World War I to the present using culture as its central organizing concept. We will define culture broadly to encompass customs, beliefs, and everyday practices, as well as forms of literary and artistic expression. Central themes of the course include: the role of mass media in shaping a national culture; the intersections of culture and technology; changes in racial formations and ethnic affiliations; cultural dynamics within neighborhoods and cities; cultural meanings of gender and sexual identities; and the political consequences of cultural conflict. We will also consider transnational influences on American culture and, conversely, the effects of American culture abroad.\n\nAMST 2120W.80: Freedom in American Thought and Popular Culture\n\nCRN: 96623 // E. Anker\n\nMW 11:10-12:00 PM\n\nAmerica was founded on the premise of providing freedom to its people. But what, exactly, is―”freedom”? Is it doing what you want or is it participation in politics? Is it about escaping domination or does it require sharing power? These questions have been debated in America since its founding. The course will examine varied answers to these questions provided by American thought and popular culture. We will intertwine the study of theoretical texts with cultural analysis to examine authors from Jefferson to Thoreau, speeches from Martin Luther King to George W. Bush, films from High Noon to Minority Report, and the video art of Jeremy Blake. Together, we will explore how concepts of freedom and anxieties over freedom’s possibility to take cultural form. While we may not settle the question of what freedom is or how to produce it, we will learn both to appreciate its complexity and to critically engage its operations in American public life. This course satisfies a WID requirement. Students must also register for a discussion section to satisfy the course requirements.\n\nAMST 2490.10: American Contagions\n\nCRN: 96915 // N. Ivy\n\nTR 2:20-3:35 PM\n\nThis course examines how national ideas about health, disease, cleanliness, and contamination have concurrently informed and been shaped by notions of difference. Together, we will think through how forms of human difference have been historically medicalized—as unhealthy, as in need of repair or management. We will seriously consider how gender, sexuality, race, and ability to continue to shape U.S. health care policy and practice. To do this, assigned course materials and class discussions will explore difficult-to-answer questions about the legacies of contagion narratives in American culture and politics. How have fears of outbreak influenced American military and economic actions? How do evolving understandings of the transmission and treatment of disease create and sustain moral panics? We will place primary sources such as political cartoons, plantation manuals, and printed broadsides in conversation with readings in social theory, feminist theory, and cultural studies. Across the semester, we will study and practice the essential skills of research, critical thinking, and textual analysis.\n\nAMST 2490.11: US Political Culture, 1960-Present\n\nCRN: 98474 // M. Dallek\n\nMW 2:20-3:10 PM\n\nThis course traces the impact of cultural divisions on American politics from 1960 to the present. Students will examine how novels, films, plays, TV shows, art exhibits, and other cultural materials influenced the ideas and contexts that inform American political development. The course explores how a variety of cultural “texts” have framed debates about topics ranging from race, gender, and sexuality to social issues such as abortion and book bans, stirred public conversations about the meaning of “morality,” and dissented from mainstream thinking to upend traditional norms and behaviors. Students will be asked to think critically about manifestos (the Port Huron Statement), concert films (Altamont), conspiracy theories (Birtherism), “Be-Ins,” and the iconography of movements for social justice, among other cultural documents, in order to understand the interconnectedness of ideas, culture, and politics. Finally, the course will consider how cultural divisions since 1960 have contributed to politics in the 2020s; and how this past differs from controversies in our own times.\n\nAMST 2490.80: Sex, Gender, Citizenship\n\nCRN: 97824 // E. Bock\n\nTR 12:45-1:35 PM\n\nThis course offers an examination of how sex, sexuality, and gender influence our understandings (and feelings) of what it means to be a citizen of a nation, a community, and the world. Through encounters with texts, podcasts, films, and art, we will investigate a series of important questions relating to the regulation of bodies, desires, and public/private life, paying particular attention to how these questions influence what it means to belong to a social body and to ourselves.\n\nAMST 3901.10: Examining America\n\nCRN: 93416 // E. Anker\n\nM 3:30-6:00 PM\n\nThis course offers students an introduction to the history, debates, and methodologies that are central to the field of American Studies. Students will be introduced to key texts in American Studies scholarship from foundational primary sources to contemporary secondary scholarship. Registration restricted to American Studies majors.\n\nAMST 3950.10: Performing America\n\nCRN: 97018 // E. Bock\n\nR 3:30-6:00 PM\n\nWhen we think of the word “performance,” we most commonly think of a stage, lights, costumes, and props, but we rarely consider how performances find their way into the most ordinary events that shape everyday life in the United States. From social media and local school board meetings to the security line at the airport and the waiting room in the doctor’s office, American life is diffused with different genres of performance that are easily dismissed and/or reproduced without question. This course asks how performance both shapes and reinforces narratives of belonging to the American social body and how people have pushed against and and complicated those very narratives through history. Taking both large and small cultural productions as our primary objects of study, we will attend to the ways that performance—on the stage, in the streets, and in the intimate spaces of the private sphere—becomes an important lens through which to understand social, political, and economic life in America.\n\nAMST 1000.10: Consuming Asian America\n\nCRN: 48283 // GJ Sevillano\n\nW 12:45-3:15 PM\n\n“Did you eat yet?” Cut fruit apologies. Dogeaters. Mukbang and kamayan. Dhaba and Chinese take-out.\n\nInterested in the diversity of Asian American life, this course introduces students to the differentiated yet intersecting experiences of Asian racialization in the United States from the 19th century to the present by examining the complexities of Asian/American food, foodways, and food systems. Surveying critical themes in the interdisciplinary fields of Asian American studies and critical food studies, this course utilizes novels, film, television, cookbooks, recipes, archival documents, and popular culture to better understand categories such as race, gender and sexuality, family and kinship, class, empire and nationhood, and the body. Students will adopt theoretically informed reading practices to begin exploring how “consumption” informs our understanding of “Asian America.” This course tackles a series of questions such as: Who or what is considered an “Asian American”? Who or what constitutes “Asian America”? How can we understand the Asian American diaspora through the contexts of food and foodways? How are Asian American foodways represented in writing, film, and popular culture? How have these conceptions changed over time? Readings and viewings may include Elaine Castillo, Bich Minh Nguyen, Milton Murayama, David Chang, Padma Lakshmi, Ang Lee, Bong Joon-ho, Jon M. Chu, BLACKPINK, or others.\n\nAMST 1050.11: Asian American Feelings\n\nCRN: 48182 // J. McMaster\n\nTR 11:10-12:25 PM\n\nThis course takes a feminist, queer, and crip approach to the study of Asian American emotional life. It asks questions like, How do those held and hailed by the category “Asian American” feel about themselves and the world? How do others in the world feel about them in turn? Why do all of these people feel this way? And what historical, political, economic, and social circumstances have given rise to those feelings? Over the course of the past few decades, affect theory —basically, the study of feelings, their ontology, their causes, and their effects—has emerged as a key explanatory framework for understanding what it is to affect and to be affected, to move and to be moved, to feel and to be felt.\n\nWith attention to historical specificity, students will spend the semester analyzing the arguments theorists have made in relation to racialized and gendered structures of feeling ranging from \"racial melancholia\" and \"racist love\" to \"national abjection\" and \"model minority masochism.\" Students will also be asked to examine how racial feelings such as these are rendered across a range of media beyond academic theory, including creative nonfiction, live performance, visual art, television, material culture, and film. Taking seriously the political stakes of studying affect and emotion, the ultimate aim of this course is to provide students with the tools to attune to Asian American feeling and to imagine how the world might be remade so that Asian Americans might feel otherwise.\n\nAMST 1100.10: Politics & Film\n\nCRN: 42482 // E. Anker\n\nM 12:45-2:00 PM; M 7:10-9:40 PM\n\nThis class addresses the relationship between politics and film by examining how American films interpret and challenge political power in America. We pair film analysis with readings in political theory to interrogate the operations of power in political life. Exploring films thematically, first we examine those that shape conventional interpretations of political power in America, including concepts of limited government, popular sovereignty, and liberal individualism. Next, we consider films that challenge these ideas by offering alternate conceptions of how power functions, while addressing questions of ideology, surveillance, domination, and biopolitics. The last section investigates particular genres—melodrama, the western, and film noir—that reshape and rearticulate these themes within American political culture. Throughout, we will focus on how to read the visual language of film and the written texts of political theory. Students must also register for a discussion section to satisfy the course requirement.\n\nAMST 2010.80: Early American Cultural History\n\nCRN: 41825 // N. Ivy\n\nMW 2:20-3:10 PM\n\nThis course starts with the argument that understanding culture is key to understanding American history.

Students must also register for a discussion section to satisfy the course requirement. Same as HIST 2010.\n\nAMST 2410W.80: Modern US Immigration\n\nCRN: 47450 // T. Guglielmo\n\nMW 9:35-10:25 AM\n\nThis class will investigate immigration patterns, immigration policy, and immigrants’ lives in the United States from the turn of the twentieth century to the present. Which immigrant groups have come to the United States? When and why have they come? And what have their lives been like once they got here? How has the federal government, and Americans more generally, responded to immigrants and immigration? Why have we welcomed some newcomers as good future Americans and scorned others as “forever foreigners” or “illegal aliens”? The course will explore these questions through a mix of reading, writing, lecture, and discussion. This course will satisfy a WID requirement.\n\nAMST 2490.80: Sex, Gender, Citizenship\n\nCRN: 47947 // E. Bock\n\nTR 12:45-1:35 PM\n\nThis course offers an examination of how sex, sexuality, and gender influence our understandings (and feelings) of what it means to be a citizen of a nation, a community, and the world. Through encounters with texts, podcasts, films, and art, we will investigate a series of important questions relating to the regulation of bodies, desires, and public/private life, paying particular attention to how these questions influence what it means to belong to a social body and to ourselves.\n\nAMST 3625.80: Ethnographic and Historical Perspectives on Data Ethics\n\nCRN: 46523 // J. Cohen-Cole\n\nT 12:45-3:15 PM\n\nThis class is an introduction to ethics of data sciences from two disparate perspectives: historical and ethnographic. The course focuses on the ethical and moral dilemmas posed by the collection and use of large data sets, by artificial intelligence, and by our increasingly on-line lives. Issues we will examine include the erosion of public life in the face of mediated remote communication, government and corporate surveillance; loss of privacy; the interaction of social media and democratic norms; and the substitution of artificial algorithmic and automatic processes for human judgment in policy making and practices of everyday life. The course is open to students from all fields. It is designed as an interdisciplinary meeting ground for students interested in humanistic inquiry and those in the data science major and other STEM fields. It will be useful to students in social sciences involved in the generation, recording, curation, processing, sharing and use of data; While it is a stand-alone course, it provides a “front door” for further research into the study of ethical life in an electronically mediated world through the methods of historical methods and digital ethnography. While it is a stand-alone course, it provides a “front door” for further research into the study of ethical life in an electronically mediated world through social scientific or humanistic methods. Those wishing further studies in these areas may consider continuing on with courses such as AMST 2610 Science, Technology and Politics in Modern America, AMST 2620 Human Minds and Artificial Intelligence, and AMST 2680 Hashtag America.\n\nAMST 3900.10: Critiquing Culture\n\nCRN: 43153 // E. Bock\n\nTR 3:45-5:00 PM\n\nThis course provides an introduction to the major theories and methods that define the field of American studies. In particular, we seek to understand the elusive yet omnipresent world of “culture”—the values, symbols, myths, ideas, ways of life, and systems of meaning that shape our identities and worldviews.\n\nAMST 4500W.10: Interrogating Education: GW & Beyond\n\nCRN: 44035 // J. Cohne-Cole\n\nW 12:45-3:15 PM\n\nCourse Description Provided Soon\n\nAMST 1050.11: National Bodies\n\nCRN: 67856 // N. Ivy\n\nTR 11:10-12:25 PM\n\nWho makes up the body politic? How have discussions of citizenship and belonging been mapped onto ideas about biology and difference? To approach these questions, this course explores of how representations of the physical form as well as ideas about what constitutes appropriate bodies are shaped by U.S. cultural, political, social, and economic discourse. Assigned texts will present specific theoretical emphasis on race, gender, sexuality, labor, ability, and class.\n\nAMST 1050.12: What is Democracy?\n\nCRN: 68227 // E. Anker\n\nW 12:45-3:15 PM\n\nThis class will examine the various concepts and experiences that make up democracy in the United States (and in a transnational context). Democracy is one of the most widely-valued systems of political power, but there is little agreement about its core ideals, and it is often defined and exercised in divergent ways. We will read a variety of texts that examine the promises and perils of democracy, and also focus on sharpening our own political values and investments.\n\nAMST 2011.80: Modern American Cultural History\n\nCRN: 66137 // D. Orenstein\n\nMW 9:35-10:25 AM\n\nThis course examines the history of the United States from World War I to the present using culture as its central organizing concept. We will define culture broadly to encompass customs, beliefs, and everyday practices, as well as forms of literary and artistic expression. Central themes of the course include: the role of mass media in shaping a national culture; the intersections of culture and technology; changes in racial formations and ethnic affiliations; cultural dynamics within neighborhoods and cities; cultural meanings of gender and sexual identities; and the political consequences of cultural conflict. We will also consider transnational influences on American culture and, conversely, the effects of American culture abroad.\n\nAMST 2120W.80: Freedom in American Thought and Popular Culture\n\nCRN: 67857 // E. Anker\n\nMW 11:10-12:00 PM\n\nAmerica was founded on the premise of providing freedom to its people. But what, exactly, is―”freedom”? Is it doing what you want or is it participation in politics? Is it about escaping domination or does it require sharing power? These questions have been debated in America since its founding. The course will examine varied answers to these questions provided by American thought and popular culture. We will intertwine the study of theoretical texts with cultural analysis to examine authors from Jefferson to Thoreau, speeches from Martin Luther King to George W. Bush, films from High Noon to Minority Report, and the video art of Jeremy Blake. Together, we will explore how concepts of freedom and anxieties over freedom’s possibility to take cultural form. While we may not settle the question of what freedom is or how to produce it, we will learn both to appreciate its complexity and to critically engage its operations in American public life. This course satisfies a WID requirement. Students must also register for a discussion section to satisfy the course requirements.\n\nAMST 2490.10: American Contagions\n\nCRN: 68228 // N. Ivy\n\nTR 2:20-3:35 PM\n\nThis course examines how national ideas about health, disease, cleanliness, and contamination have concurrently informed and been shaped by notions of difference. Together, we will think through how forms of human difference have been historically medicalized—as unhealthy, as in need of repair or management. We will seriously consider how gender, sexuality, race, and ability to continue to shape U.S. health care policy and practice. To do this, assigned course materials and class discussions will explore difficult-to-answer questions about the legacies of contagion narratives in American culture and politics. How have fears of outbreak influenced American military and economic actions? How do evolving understandings of the transmission and treatment of disease create and sustain moral panics? We will place primary sources such as political cartoons, plantation manuals, and printed broadsides in conversation with readings in social theory, feminist theory, and cultural studies. Across the semester, we will study and practice the essential skills of research, critical thinking, and textual analysis.\n\nAMST 2490.11: NYC in the 1970s\n\nCRN: 68229 // D. Orenstein\n\nW 3:30-6:00 PM\n\nAMST 2710.80: The US in the World\n\nCRN: 66153 // M. McAlister\n\nMW 12:45-1:35 PM\n\nThis course examines US history from 1898-present in terms of its cultural and political relationships with the world beyond US borders. We will consider, among other things, US state and military power, globalizing cultures, transnational ideas and social movements, travel and tourism, and the impact of media in the context of US global power.\n\nAMST 2750.80: Latinos in the US\n\nCRN: 65003 // E. Peña\n\nTR 3:45-5:00 PM\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau projects that the Hispanic population will reach 111 million by 2060. But who are Hispanics? What does that term mean and how does it relate to Latino and Latinx? Can those terms accurately reflect the various communities they seek to represent? Returning to those questions throughout the semester, we will critically analyze the evolution of the term “Hispanic” and its impact on discussions of race, identity, and citizenship expectations in the United States. We will engage ethnographic and historical analyses, legal perspectives, and films that explore Hispanic, Latino, and Latinx identity formation in geographic regions across the United States and in transnational/hemispheric contexts. One of the goals of this course is to not only identify how historical, political, and economic shifts have shaped the terms Hispanic and Latino in the United States but also connect those processes to ongoing discussions of immigration reform and border security. This course fulfills critical thinking and cross-cultural perspective learning goals.\n\nAMST 3900.10: Critiquing Culture\n\nCRN: 64622 // D. Orenstein\n\nMW 12:45-2:00 PM\n\nThis course provides an introduction to the major theories and methods that define the field of American studies. In particular, we seek to understand the elusive yet omnipresent world of “culture”—the values, symbols, myths, ideas, ways of life, and systems of meaning that shape our identities and world views.\n\nAMST 3901.10: Examining America\n\nCRN: 63726 // E. Bock\n\nTR 2:20-3:35 PM\n\nWhat does it mean to examine “America” as a nation, concept, or field of study? And how does the way we examine (the methods, archives, and artifacts) affect what we can and cannot see? This course acquaints students to key theoretical and ethnographic texts on race, gender, and sexuality as important sites for asking questions about nationalism, citizenship, belonging, and sovereignty. Instead of being a chronological history of America, the course is organized around a series of questions and concepts essential to the study of migration, slavery, and struggles for emancipation so that we might reframe our teleological investments in narratives of progress. Through the readings, our goal is to explore the various technologies, strategies, and discourses that have built particular systems of power and those which have sought to disrupt those same systems. Assigned readings will be paired with poetry, visual and performance art, films, and music so that the rarified questions of the texts might be posed anew with reference to more familiar media.\n\nAMST 3950.11: Filipinx American History\n\nCRN: 68353 // T. Gonzalves\n\nMW 2:20-3:35 PM\n\nThis interdisciplinary course offers a survey of Filipinx American experiences, including, but not limited to, analyses of labor migration from the Philippines to various locations in the diaspora; creative and artistic uses of expressive forms of culture; participation in various of social movements; and settlement in the United States as part of the nation’s fastest growing racial group.\n\nAMST 4701.80: Epidemics in American History\n\nCRN: 63770 // V. Gamble\n\nMW 12:45-2:00 PM\n\nThis course surveys the history of infectious disease epidemics in the United States from the late nineteenth century to today, including the Covid-19 pandemic. It examines the development of the medical and public health responses to epidemics and the social, political, cultural and economic impact of epidemics on American history and culture. We will use primary documents, historical accounts, memoirs, and films to understand the history of epidemic disease.\n\nAMST 1000.10: Bodies of Work\n\nNicole Ivy\n\nMW 4:45 - 6:00\n\nCRN: 77313\n\nThe National Gallery of Art’s ongoing exhibition, Bodies of Work, explores how American painters and sculptors across the last fifty years have “reimagine[d] the human form as a site of fantasy, fear, and travail.” Taking its title from this show, this course will examine how the human body has figured in cultural and historical narratives, not simply as a physical fact but as a site of social and political meaning-making. Using an interdisciplinary approach that highlights visual culture analysis, we will trace how historical perspectives on the body and embodiment have shaped American culture. Our texts for this class will include both written works and visual objects. We will explore how artists and intellectuals have engaged embodiment over an expansive period of time, considering works by a diverse array of thinkers including: Thomas Jefferson, Donna Haraway, Kerry James Marshall, and Andy Warhol.\n\nAMST 1000.11: Zombie Capitalism\n\nDara Orenstein\n\nT 3:30-6:00\n\nCRN: 78432\n\nThe Walking Dead. World War Z. “Zombie Banks.” Why does the specter of the living dead loom so largely in contemporary U.S. culture? How is it useful? What does it illuminate about the relationship between capitalism and democracy that might otherwise remain inscrutable? And how has it served in this allegorical manner throughout modern U.S. history? How did it haunt the rise of mass production, or the growth of suburbs, or the eruption of a social movement like Occupy Wall Street? To answer such questions, in this seminar we will screen one film per week, supplemented by brief readings in primary sources, to track the figure of the zombie from the Great Depression to the Great Recession (or, now, the Great Depression 2.0), and from the sugar plantations of Haiti to the tents of Zuccotti Park and the COVID-19 morgues of Detroit.\n\nAMST 1100.10: Politics and Film\n\nElisabeth Anker\n\nM 2:20 -3:35 and 7:10 - 9:40\n\nCRN: 72628\n\nThis class addresses the relationship between politics and film by examining how American films interpret and challenge political power in America. We pair film analysis with readings in political theory to interrogate the operations of power in political life. Exploring films thematically, first we examine those that shape conventional interpretations of political power in America, including concepts of limited government, popular sovereignty, and liberal individualism. Next, we consider films that challenge these ideas by offering alternate conceptions of how power functions, while addressing questions of ideology, surveillance, domination, and biopolitics. The last section investigates particular genres—melodrama, the western, and film noir—that reshape and rearticulate these themes within American political culture. Throughout, we will focus on how to read the visual language of film and the written texts of political theory. Students must also register for a discussion section to satisfy the course requirement.\n\nAMST 2010.80: Early American Cultural History\n\nNicole Ivy\n\nMW 2:20 - 3:10\n\nCRN: 71919\n\nThis course starts with the argument that understanding culture is key to understanding American history. Culture can refer to art and literature—some of which we will explore in class. However, culture can also refer to popular forms of expression, including the way people act. With this broader perspective, we will study some of the major scholarship addressing the evolution of American culture—from the Colonial period through Reconstruction. For example, we will look at what scholars have to say about why minstrel shows were popular and about how Indian captivity narratives were used to justify the conquest of the West. To shape our analyses, we will examine old newspapers, read popular literature, and explore the museums here in Washington, DC—then develop our own opinions and arguments as we engage in small group discussions and complete class assignments. This is an upper division course, but it is geared toward freshmen and sophomores who are looking for a challenge. Students must also register for a discussion section to satisfy the course requirement. Same as HIST 2010.\n\nAMST 2320.80: U.S. Media and Cultural History\n\nMelani McAlister\n\nTR 11:10 - 12:00\n\nCRN: 77314\n\nThis course will examine mass culture – film, radio, music, television, internet – and its role in US history from the turn of the 20th century to the present. Focusing on cultural production, consumption, and reception, this course will consider the historical contexts in which popular culture has emerged and developed. The cultural texts we will study range from silent films to 1950s sitcoms and twenty-first century new media. Students will learn to consider media histories in light of theoretical debates about ideology, media effects, national identity, ethnic and racial identity, gender roles, and imperialism. Reading and viewing requirements are extensive. In addition to other course requirements, student work includes a final paper in which students analyze a media artifact in its historical and cultural context.\n\nAMST 2430.10: Capitalism and Culture\n\nDara Orenstein\n\nTR 2:20 - 3:10\n\nCRN: 74829\n\nWhat is capitalism, exactly? The COVID-19 pandemic has spotlighted this deceptively simple question in a way not seen in generations. Why were supermarket shelves empty of toilet paper in 2020? Who is an \"essential\" worker? When Amazon offers \"free shipping,\" what happens in its warehouses? And, across the board, what does culture have to do with it? How might TikTok yield more answers than the New York Times? Our aim in this reading-intensive lecture course will be to tackle such riddles with the methods and insights of the arts and humanities. Each week we will take up an aspect of the real abstraction of capitalism. Surveying the histories of the crises that surround us, we will investigate how, in a capitalist society, concepts like “productivity,” “growth,” and “value” are, increasingly, threats to life itself.\n\nAMST 2440W.80: The American City\n\nSuleiman Osman\n\nMW 11:10 - 12:00\n\nCRN: 76677\n\nThis introduces students to the exciting field of urban studies. Students will explore the political, architectural and cultural history of American cities, with a particular focus on Washington DC. Students will tackle urban planning and policy debates about topics such as urban renewal, sprawl, public housing, policing and gentrification. The course will include works by a range of urban writers such as Jane Jacobs, Mike Davis, Neil Smith, William Julius Wilson and clips from the TV show “The Wire.”\n\nAMST 3900.10: Critiquing Culture\n\nDara Orenstein\n\nTR 9:35 - 10:50\n\nCRN: 73335\n\nThis course provides an introduction to the major theories and methods that define the field of American studies. In particular, we seek to understand the elusive yet omnipresent world of “culture”—the values, symbols, myths, ideas, ways of life, and systems of meaning that shape our identities and worldviews.\n\nAMST 3901.10: Examining America\n\nEmily Bock\n\nTR 2:20 - 3:35\n\nCRN: 74830\n\nWhat does it mean to examine “America” as a nation, concept, or field of study? And how does the way we examine (the methods, archives, and artifacts) affect what we can and cannot see? This course acquaints students to key theoretical and ethnographic texts on race, gender, and sexuality as important sites for asking questions about nationalism, citizenship, belonging, and sovereignty. Instead of being a chronological history of America, the course is organized around a series of questions and concepts essential to the study of migration, slavery, and struggles for emancipation so that we might reframe our teleological investments in narratives of progress. Through the readings, our goal is to explore the various technologies, strategies, and discourses that have built particular systems of power and those which have sought to disrupt those same systems. Assigned readings will be paired with poetry, visual and performance art, films, and music so that the rarified questions of the texts might be posed anew with reference to more familiar media.\n\nAMST 4500W.10: History of Washington, D.C.\n\nSuleiman Osman\n\nMW 9:35 - 10:50\n\nCRN: 74306\n\nThis is an advanced research seminar for American Studies majors. Seminar participants will spend the semester researching and writing a paper on a topic of their choice related to the history of the District of Columbia. Students may choose a topic in any time period, including the very recent past. Students will be encouraged to explore Gelman's D.C. History collection and other archives in the D.C. metropolitan area. The seminar will be conducted as a workshop during which students will have the opportunity to give supportive feedback to one another as they develop their projects.\n\nAMST 4500W.11: “Interrogating GW”\n\nThomas Guglielmo\n\nT 12:45 - 3:15\n\nCRN: 75089\n\nThis is an advanced research seminar for American Studies majors on the topic of George Washington University. Each student will spend the semester writing a substantial research paper on some aspect of the university -- its student culture or activism; its race, class, or gender politics; its staff; its faculty; its leadership; its donors; its real estate holdings; its relationship with DC or Foggy Bottom; its cultural representation; its labor struggles; its “corporatization,” and so forth.\n\nAMST 4702W.80: Race, Medicine, and Public Health\n\nVanessa Northington Gamble\n\nMW 12:45 - 2:00\n\nCRN: 72717\n\nThis course focuses on the role of race and racism in the development of American medicine and public health by examining the experiences of African Americans from slavery to today. It will emphasize the importance of understanding the historical roots of contemporary policy dilemmas such as racial and ethnic inequalities and inequities in health and health care. The course will challenge students to synthesize materials from several disciplines to gain a broad understanding of the relationship between race, medicine, and public health in the United States.It includes a significant engagement in writing as a form of critical inquiry and scholarly expression to satisfy the WID requirement.\n\nAMST 1000.11: Zombie Capitalism\n\nDara Orenstein\n\nM 12:45-3:15\n\nCRN: 36116\n\nThe Walking Dead. World War Z. “Zombie Banks.” Why does the specter of the living dead loom so largely in contemporary U.S. culture? How is it useful? What does it illuminate about the relationship between capitalism and democracy that might otherwise remain inscrutable? And how has it served in this allegorical manner throughout modern U.S. history? How did it haunt the rise of mass production, or the growth of suburbs, or the eruption of a social movement like Occupy Wall Street? To answer such questions, in this seminar we will screen one film per week, supplemented by brief readings in primary sources, to track the figure of the zombie from the Great Depression to the Great Recession (or, now, the Great Depression 2.0), and from the sugar plantations of Haiti to the tents of Zuccotti Park and the COVID-19 morgues of Detroit.\n\nAMST 1200.10: The Sixties in America\n\nSuleiman Osman\n\nTR 12:45-1:35\n\nCRN: 36290\n\nThis course will examine American society, culture, and politics during the dramatic decade of the 1960s. Students will examine topics that include the civil rights movement, the student movement, the Vietnam War and antiwar movement, the counterculture, the women’s movement, the environmentalist movement, and the conservative movement.\n\nAMST 2011.80: Modern American Cultural History\n\nGayle Wald\n\nMW 2:20-3:10\n\nCRN: 37289\n\nThis course surveys US history from 1912-2020 through the lens of culture and cultural change. Instead of trying to be exhaustive, it is organized around historical moments and phenomena that reflect the course theme of “culture wars.” We are living through a moment when talk of culture wars is everywhere, and yet culture has long been a site of political struggle and social change. While lectures lay a broad groundwork, students engage with primary texts, primarily literature, film, and music, but also theater, radio, and television. Student learning is assessed through writing assignments and a final exam, as well as through participation in weekly breakout sessions. There are no prerequisites for this course.\n\nAMST 2410.80: Modern US Immigration History\n\nTom Guglielmo\n\nMW 9:35-10:25\n\nCRN: 17948\n\nThis class will investigate immigration patterns, immigration policy, and immigrants’ lives in the United States from the turn of the twentieth century to the present. Which immigrant groups have come to the United States? When and why have they come? And what have their lives been like once they got here? How has the federal government, and Americans more generally, responded to immigrants and immigration? Why have we welcomed some newcomers as good future Americans and scorned others as “forever foreigners” or “illegal aliens”? The course will explore these questions through a mix of reading, writing, lecture, and discussion. This course will satisfy a WID requirement.\n\nAMST 2490.10: American Contagions\n\nNicole Ivy\n\nTR 2:20-3:35\n\nCRN: 34503\n\nThis course examines how national ideas about health, disease, cleanliness, and contamination have concurrently informed and been shaped by notions of difference. Together, we will think through how forms of human difference have been historically medicalized—as unhealthy, as in need of repair or management. We will seriously consider how gender, sexuality, race, and ability to continue to shape U.S. health care policy and practice. To do this, assigned course materials and class discussions will explore difficult-to-answer questions about the legacies of contagion narratives in American culture and politics. How have fears of outbreak influenced American military and economic actions? How do evolving understandings of the transmission and treatment of disease create and sustain moral panics? We will place primary sources such as political cartoons, plantation manuals, and printed broadsides in conversation with readings in social theory, feminist theory, and cultural studies. Across the semester, we will study and practice the essential skills of research, critical thinking, and textual analysis.\n\nAMST 2490.11: Borders and Boundaries\n\nElaine Pena\n\nTR 12:45-2:00\n\nCRN: 36117\n\nInternational borders affect you every day. In the United States and elsewhere, they play a role in determining whether you are a birthright citizen or an unauthorized migrant. They showcase a nation’s ability or inability to guarantee your wellbeing. They factor into comprehensive immigration reform and national security debates, including wall construction plans, that reinforce party lines and determine elections. Those who live in close proximity to an international border often deal with a particular set of issues. Living in an either/or environment can impel border residents to strategically recognize or deny cultural forms—to be hyper patriotic, for example, or to speak one language at home and another at school. This course will draw from the work of anthropologists, political scientists, historians, geographers, and documentary filmmakers to establish a strong base in border theory and to shine light on ground up dynamics. It will use the U.S.-Mexico border as its primary reference point, but it will also draw our attention to boundary lines around the globe including places like Ceuta and Melilla in Northern Africa and the Guatemala-Mexico border.\n\nAMST 2610W.80: Science, Tech, and Politics in Modern America\n\nJamie Cohen-Cole\n\nTR 9:35-10:25\n\nCRN: 37302\n\nThis course examines the history of science and technology and their role in political and social life. Among the questions we will consider are: how has society, culture, and politics developed and changed because of technical developments ranging from electricity to the automobile, nuclear weapons, the internet, biotechnology and social sciences from SAT tests to economic modeling? How have struggles over science and technology over issues including evolution, global warming, GMOs, and vaccines shaped our culture? How have citizens and the government resolved conflicts over the truth or uses of science and technology? This course will satisfy a WID requirement.\n\nAMST 2710.80: US in the World\n\nMelani McAlister\n\nTR 11:10-12:00\n\nCRN: 37305\n\nThis course examines US history from 1898-present in terms of its cultural and political relationships with the world beyond US borders. We will consider, among other things, US state and military power, globalizing cultures, transnational ideas and social movements, travel and tourism, and the impact of media in the context of US global power.\n\nAMST 2750.80: Latinos in the US\n\nElaine Peña\n\nTR 3:45-5:00\n\nCRN: 35589\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau projects that the Hispanic population will reach 111 million by 2060. But who are Hispanics? What does that term mean and how does it relate to Latino and Latinx? Can those terms accurately reflect the various communities they seek to represent? Returning to those questions throughout the semester, we will critically analyze the evolution of the term “Hispanic” and its impact on discussions of race, identity, and citizenship expectations in the United States. We will engage ethnographic and historical analyses, legal perspectives, and films that explore Hispanic, Latino, and Latinx identity formation in geographic regions across the United States and in transnational/hemispheric contexts. One of the goals of this course is to not only identify how historical, political, and economic shifts have shaped the terms Hispanic and Latino in the United States but also connect those processes to ongoing discussions of immigration reform and border security. This course fulfills critical thinking and cross-cultural perspective learning goals.\n\nAMST 3900.10: Critiquing Culture\n\nDara Orenstein\n\nMW 9:35-10:50\n\nCRN: 35100\n\nThis course provides an introduction to the major theories and methods that define the field of American studies. In particular, we seek to understand the elusive yet omnipresent world of “culture”—the values, symbols, myths, ideas, ways of life, and systems of meaning that shape our identities and worldviews.\n\nAMST 3901.10: Examining America\n\nSuleiman Osman\n\nTR 2:20-3:10\n\nCRN: 34021\n\nThis course offers students an introduction to the history, debates, and methodologies that are central to the field of American Studies. Students will be introduced to key texts in American Studies scholarship from foundational primary sources to contemporary secondary scholarship. Registration restricted to American Studies majors.\n\nAMST 4701.80: Epidemics in American History\n\nVanessa Northington Gamble\n\nMW 12:45-2:00\n\nCRN: 34076\n\nThis course surveys the history of infectious disease epidemics in the United States from the late nineteenth century to today, including the Covid-19 pandemic. It examines the development of the medical and public health responses to epidemics and the social, political, cultural and economic impact of epidemics on American history and culture. We will use primary documents, historical accounts, memoirs, and films to understand the history of epidemic disease.\n\nAMST 1050.10 – What is Democracy?\n\nLibby Anker\n\nT 12:45-3:15\n\nCRN: 68061\n\nAMST 1100.10 – Politics and Film\n\nElisabeth Anker\n\nM 12:45-2:00 and M 7:10-9:40\n\nCRN: 62945\n\nThis class addresses the relationship between politics and film by examining how American films interpret and challenge political power in America. We pair film analysis with readings in political theory to interrogate the operations of power in political life. Exploring films thematically, first we examine those that shape conventional interpretations of political power in America, including concepts of limited government, popular sovereignty, and liberal individualism. Next, we consider films that challenge these ideas by offering alternate conceptions of how power functions, while addressing questions of ideology, surveillance, domination, and biopolitics. The last section investigates particular genres—melodrama, the western, and film noir—that reshape and rearticulate these themes within American political culture. Throughout, we will focus on how to read the visual language of film and the written texts of political theory. Students must also register for a discussion section to satisfy the course requirement.\n\nAMST 2010.80 – Early American Cultural History\n\nTeresa Murphy\n\nMW 2:20-3:10\n\nCRN: 62122\n\nThis course starts with the argument that understanding culture is key to understanding American history. Culture can refer to art and literature—some of which we will explore in class. However, culture can also refer to popular forms of expression, including the way people act. With this broader perspective, we will study some of the major scholarship addressing the evolution of American culture—from the Colonial period through Reconstruction.

To shape our analyses, we will examine old newspapers, read popular literature, and explore the museums here in Washington, DC—then develop our own opinions and arguments as we engage in small group discussions and complete class assignments. This is an upper division course, but it is geared toward freshman and sophomores who are looking for a challenge. Students must also register for a discussion section to satisfy the course requirement. Same as HIST 2010.\n\nAMST 2071.80 – Introduction to the Arts in America\n\nKatherine Markowski\n\nTR 9:35-10:50\n\nCRN: 67687\n\nThis is a lecture survey of American art from the colonial period to the postmodern present. Primarily focused upon painting, the course also covers sculpture, architecture, printmaking and photography within the broader visual and material culture of United States history. Art works are analyzed in relation to issues of religion, nationalism, ethnicity, race, class and gender.\n\nAMST 2430.10 – Capitalism and Culture\n\nDara Orenstein\n\nTR 9:35-10:25AM\n\nCRN: 65596\n\nAs of this writing, in April, GW is online. Most of the nation is under quarantine. And the world as we knew it is over. Why are the shelves empty of toilet paper? Why are ventilators in short supply? Why are hospitals laying off doctors and nurses? Why is Congress bailing out the airline industry, the cruise industry, the oil industry? Why are the people who are now recognized as “essential workers”—the food-service workers, the healthcare workers, the transit workers, the warehouse workers—also the same people who are most vulnerable, structurally speaking, to premature death? (And why, by the way, is GW online?) Any answer to these questions must contend with one word: capitalism. And it is not “capitalism” merely in terms of the dollars and cents that needs to be examined (or, autopsied). It is equally the culture of capitalism that is at the root of the pandemic of COVID-19. This reading-intensive, discussion-based course is an introduction to scholarship in the arts, humanities, and social sciences on the culture of capitalism. Organized thematically, and with a historical sensibility, it investigates how, in a capitalist framework, concepts like “productivity,” “growth,” and “value” are, increasingly, threats to life itself.\n\nAMST 2440W.80 – The American City\n\nSuleiman Osman\n\nTR, 2:20-3:10\n\nCRN: 68094\n\nThis introduces students to the exciting field of urban studies. Students will explore the political, architectural and cultural history of American cities, with a particular focus on Washington DC. Students will tackle urban planning and policy debates about topics such as urban renewal, sprawl, racial inequality, policing, public housing, immigration and gentrification. The course will include works by a range of urban writers such as Jane Jacobs, Mike Davis, Neil Smith, Anne Petry and clips from the TV show “The Wire.”\n\nAMST 2450.10 – History and Meaning of Higher Education in the United States\n\nTeresa Murphy\n\nMW 11:10-12:00PM\n\nCRN: 67688\n\nInterest in, and support for universities as well as the academic training they provide is longstanding and complicated. Community and state support have been rooted in civic aspirations while students and their families have generally focused on the economic and cultural benefits that students derive. This course will analyze the ways in which these two different sets of expectations have evolved, intersected, and sometimes collided over the past two centuries. Students will analyze how college experiences were reflective of competing social, economic, and cultural goals. Students also will explore how colleges provided social mobility for some students at the same time that they reinscribed inequality in other ways. We will pay particular attention to how student life has changed over the last two hundred years, how college curricula have been modified, and how professional standards have evolved. Finally, students will examine how universities have been and continue to be deeply tied to governmental goals and needs. Students will be expected not only to analyze these issues but to suggest interventions for improving higher education in the 21 st century.\n\nAMST 2730W.80: World War II in History and Memory\n\nTom Guglielmo\n\nMW 9:35-10:25AM\n\nCRN: 66951\n\nThis course examines Americans’ World War II experiences and how those experiences have been studied, debated, understood, and “remembered”—officially, culturally, and personally. Through a mix of reading, writing, and discussion, it focuses on six overlapping topics: GIs, the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japanese American internment, African Americans, the Holocaust, and women.\n\nAMST 3362.80 – African American Women's History\n\nErin Chapman\n\nTR 2:20-3:35\n\nCRN: 66952\n\nIn this course, we will explore the history of African American women’s labor, leisure, institution-building, and activism from the antebellum period through the early 1980s. In addition, we will investigate the complexities of gender, sexuality, and class as they have shaped African American women’s experiences, the idea of race, racial identity and racism, and U.S. society. We will cover slavery, abolitionism, Reconstruction, the Women’s Era, the great migration, the New Negro Era, Civil Rights, Black Power, and Black Feminism, with an eye toward both African American women’s participation and the gender politics of racial advancement efforts. Readings will include biography and histories of specific moments and movements. Requirements will include reading responses and a final examination.\n\nAMST 3625.80 – Ethnographic and Historical Perspectives on Data Ethics\n\nJamie Cohen-Cole and Joel Kuipers\n\nT 12:45-3:15\n\nCRN: 66238\n\nThis class is an introduction to ethics of data sciences from two disparate perspectives: historical and ethnographic. The course focuses on the ethical and moral dilemmas posed by the collection and use of large data sets, by artificial intelligence, and by our increasingly on-line lives. Issues we will examine include the erosion of public life in the face of mediated remote communication, government and corporate surveillance; loss of privacy; the interaction of social media and democratic norms; and the substitution of artificial algorithmic and automatic processes for human judgment in policy making and practices of everyday life. The course is open to students from all fields. It is designed as an interdisciplinary meeting ground for students interested in humanistic inquiry and those in the data science major and other STEM fields. It will be useful to students in social sciences involved in the generation, recording, curation, processing, sharing and use of data; While it is a stand-alone course, it provides a “front door” for further research into the study of ethical life in an electronically mediated world through the methods of historical methods and digital ethnography. While it is a stand-alone course, it provides a “front door” for further research into the study of ethical life in an electronically mediated world through social scientific or humanistic methods. Those wishing further studies in these areas may consider continuing on with courses such as AMST 2610 Science, Technology and Politics in Modern America, AMST 2620 Human Minds and Artificial Intelligence, and AMST 2680 Hashtag America.\n\nAMST 3900.10 – Critiquing Culture\n\nDara Orenstein\n\nTR 9:35-10:50\n\nCRN: 63740\n\nThis course provides an introduction to the major theories and methods that define the field of American studies. In particular, we seek to understand the elusive yet omnipresent world of “culture”—the values, symbols, myths, ideas, ways of life, and systems of meaning that shape our identities and worldviews.\n\nAMST 3901.10 - Examining America\n\nElaine Peña\n\nT 12:45-3:15\n\nCRN: 65603\n\nA wide array of itineraries, exchanges, networks, and social movements have shaped America and have created dynamic variations of the American experience. Yet, the field of American Studies has not always captured those complexities. This course invites AMST majors to think critically about the institutional history of the discipline using a variety of interpretive tools. We will examine how scholarly debates around interdisciplinarity and methodology have changed over time to contemplate where to take AMST moving forward.\n\nAMST 3950W.80 – American Slavery and Its Legacies\n\nErin Chapman\n\nR 11:10-1:00\n\nCRN: 67696\n\nAMST 4500W.10 – STEM and its Cultures\n\nJamie Cohen-Cole\n\nR 12:45-3:15\n\nCRN: 64928\n\nThis is an advanced seminar for American Studies majors in which students will write original research papers on an aspect of the cultural role of science, technology and/or medicine (STM) in America. STM has been, variously, a repository of truth and political authority, a source of values, and site of conflict. In the face of wars, climate change, and epidemics, STM provides means of imagining or modeling scenarios and of shaping possible futures. Yet these interventions are not frictionless. Scientific and technological changes sometimes reinforce and at others challenge existing social categories and hierarchies. If STM fields and their products have loomed large in American culture – even, to some, defining it – these fields have not been unmoved movers. The fields are subject to cultural and political forces and themselves have internal subcultures that are accessible to cultural critique just as much as any other aspect of American life. Thus, a premise of the class is that STM and other aspects of American culture, society, and politics mutually constitute one another. We will begin with by developing the fundamental skills for writing a research paper and reading exemplary articles. Students will then engage in individual research projects of their own choosing that are based in primary sources and address important scholarly issues related to the cultural analysis of Science, Technology, and Medicine.\n\nAMST 4500W.11 – Transnational America\n\nMelani McAlister\n\nW 12:45-3:15\n\nCRN: 66025\n\nIn this advanced research seminar for American Studies majors, students write an original research paper that considers some aspect of how transnational connections and frictions among the world’s peoples have functioned both within and outside U.S. borders. =. Students should expect to combine archival research (using a range of possible archives) and cultural analysis that examines state and/or non-state actors as sources of international relations, broadly conceived. Research topics might cover issues such as the role culture or religion has played in the histories of the U.S. Empire. Or how have activists or actors of various types (the alt-right, nineteenth century missionaries, hip hop artists) worked across borders to construct networks. We will read theoretical materials on the state, transnationalism, and actor-network theory, as well as works of cultural analysis, to establish frameworks for individual research projects.\n\nAMST 4702W.80 – Race, Medicine, and Public Health\n\nVanessa Gamble\n\nMW 12:45-2:00PM\n\nCRN: 63044\n\nThis course focuses on the role of race and racism in the development of American medicine and public health by examining the experiences of African Americans from slavery to today. It will emphasize the importance of understanding the historical roots of contemporary policy dilemmas such as racial and ethnic inequalities and inequities in health and health care. The course will challenge students to synthesize materials from several disciplines to gain a broad understanding of the relationship between race, medicine, and public health in the United States. Among the questions that will be addressed are: How have race and racism influenced, and continue to influence, American medicine and public health? What is race? How have concepts of race evolved? What have been some of the historical vulnerabilities of black bodies within the medical system? How has medical thought and practices contributed to the political and social status of African Americans? What are racial inequalities and inequities in health and health care? What is the history of these inequalities and inequities and what factors have contributed to their existence and persistence? How have African Americans, the medical and public health professions, and governmental agencies addressed these inequalities and inequities in health and health care? What have been the experiences of African Americans as patients and health care providers and how have they challenged racism in medicine. This course will satisfy a WID requirement.\n\nAMST 1000.10 – Bodies of Work\n\nNicole Ivy\n\nM 12:45-3:15\n\nCRN: 15114\n\nThe National Gallery of Art’s ongoing exhibition, Bodies of Work, explores how American painters and sculptors across the last fifty years have “reimagine[d] the human form as a site of fantasy, fear, and travail.” Taking its title from this show, this course will examine how the human body has figured in cultural and historical narratives, not simply as a physical fact but as site of social and political meaning-making. Using an interdisciplinary approach that highlights visual culture analysis, we will trace how historical perspectives on the body and embodiment have shaped American culture. Our texts for this class will include both written works and visual objects. We will explore how artists and intellectuals have engaged embodiment over an expansive period of time, considering works by a diverse array of thinkers including: Thomas Jefferson, Donna Haraway, Kerry James Marshall, and Andy Warhol.\n\nAMST 1000.11 – Media Culture & COVID\n\nMelani McAlister\n\nMW 2:20-3:35\n\nCRN: 17707\n\nThis is a research seminar in which students will document and analyze cultural and political responses to the COVID crisis. Our final product will be a jointly produced webpage that will serve as a public digital humanities resource. Students will read some theoretical and historical materials on how US and global cultures have responded to previous contagions. But our primary work will be independent projects. Participants draw on their own experiences, using diaries, photographs, interviews, etc. Or they may analyze news media coverage, popular culture, or social media to unpack ideologies, cultural meanings, and the responses of ordinary people. Our project will include local, national, and transnational analyses, and formats will likely range from written essays to short videos to podcasts to photographic essays. This course satisfies GPAC requirements in the Arts and Global/Cross-Cultural perspectives.\n\nAMST 1000.12 – The Nature & Culture of Children\n\nJamie Cohen-Cole\n\nW, 3:30-6:00\n\nCRN: 18875\n\nThe sciences and philosophy ask hard questions: What is the nature of knowledge? What characteristics define humanity? How much does culture matter? It turns out that these questions have provoked fierce disagreements for how we understand, raise, and educate children. They are tied to our visions of morality, politics, education, and the shape we want the future to take. This seminar adopts a historical approach to see how these questions and the debates about children have been approached by philosophers, biologists, anthropologists, and psychologists. Registration restricted to CCAS freshman only.\n\nAMST 1200.10 – The Sixties in America\n\nSuleiman Osman\n\nTR 11:10-12:00\n\nCRN: 17949\n\nThis course will examine American society, culture, and politics during the dynamic and contentious decade of the 1960s. Students will examine topics such as the civil rights movement, the student movement, the Vietnam War and anti-war movement, black power, the counterculture, feminism, the environmental movement, and the New Right. Students will also examine how the memory of the 1960s continues to shape debates about political activism, foreign policy, and cultural consumption today. Students must also register for a discussion section to satisfy the course requirement.\n\nAMST 1050.10 – Race and Racism in US History\n\nTom Guglielmo\n\nMW 9:35-10:50\n\nCRN: 17948\n\nThis class will examine the history of race and racism in the United States from the turn of the twentieth century to the present day. Through a mixture of reading, writing, lecture, in-class discussion, film viewings, and trips around DC, we’ll explore the evolving social boundaries of race and their significance in shaping our lives, livelihoods, thoughts, and dreams. Class topics will include Jim Crow and mass incarceration, colonialism and immigration, Chinese exclusion and Japanese-American internment, civil rights and Black Lives Matter.\n\nAMST 2120W.80 – Freedom in American Thought and Popular Culture\n\nElisabeth Anker\n\nMW 11:10-12:00\n\nCRN: 13389\n\nAmerica was founded on the premise of providing freedom to its people. But what, exactly, is―”freedom”? Is it doing what you want or is it participation in politics? Is it about escaping domination or does it require sharing power? These questions have been debated in America since its founding. The course will examine varied answers to these questions provided by American thought and popular culture. We will intertwine the study of theoretical texts with cultural analysis to examine authors from Jefferson to Thoreau, speeches from Martin Luther King to George W. Bush, films from High Noon to Minority Report, and the video art of Jeremy Blake. Together, we will explore how concepts of freedom and anxieties over freedom’s possibility to take cultural form. While we may not settle the question of what freedom is or how to produce it, we will learn both to appreciate its complexity and to critically engage its operations in American public life. This course satisfies a WID requirement. Students must also register for a discussion section to satisfy the course requirements\n\nAMST 2210.10 – African American Experience\n\nAmber Musser\n\nTR 12:45-1:35\n\nCRN: 15177\n\nMuch of what we think about in relation to the African American experience begins with the central question: what does it mean to have been treated as a commodity? This course uses that question as the central point for examining African American life from slavery to the present by focusing specifically on how gender and sexuality have been part of commodification and central to resisting it. Students will gain historical contexts for this question in addition to learning to analyze contemporary portrayals of African American experience in literature, film, television, and music.\n\nAMST 2490.10 – American Contagions\n\nNicole Ivy\n\nMW 4:45-6:00\n\nCRN: 15180\n\nThis course examines how national ideas about health, disease, cleanliness, and contamination have concurrently informed and been shaped by notions of difference. Together, we will think through how forms of human difference have been historically medicalized—as unhealthy, as in need of repair or management. We will seriously consider how gender, sexuality, race, and ability to continue to shape U.S. health care policy and practice. To do this, assigned course materials and class discussions will explore difficult-to-answer questions about the legacies of contagion narratives in American culture and politics. How have fears of outbreak influenced American military and economic actions? How do evolving understandings of the transmission and treatment of disease create and sustain moral panics? We will place primary sources such as political cartoons, plantation manuals, and printed broadsides in conversation with readings in social theory, feminist theory, and cultural studies. Across the semester, we will study and practice the essential skills of research, critical thinking, and textual analysis.\n\nAMST 2490.11 – COVID: Race, Gender & Uprisings\n\nAmber Musser\n\nTR 3:45-5:00\n\nCRN: 17708\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has upended so many aspects of American Culture. This seminar will focus specifically on the reorientations to intimacy, work, and leisure in several ways. We will position this moment in relation to previous public health emergencies; we will look at the way inequalities have been made visible by this crisis; and we will look at emergent solutions to these social problems. This seminar will require critical self-reflection and a willingness to engage with theory. There will be a weekly writing assignment in addition to a final project.\n\nAMST 2750.80 – Latinos in the U.S.\n\nElaine Peña\n\nTR 12:45-2:00\n\nCRN: 16925\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau projects that Latinos will make up the majority in the United States by 2050. But who are Latinos? What does that term mean now and how has it changed over time? Can the term accurately reflect the various communities it seeks to represent? Returning to those questions throughout the semester, we will critically analyze the evolution of the term “Latino” and its impact on discussions of race, identity, and citizenship expectations in the United States. We will engage ethnographic and historical analyses, legal perspectives, and films that explore Latino identity formation in geographic regions across the United States as well as hemispherically. One of the goals of this course is to not only identify how historical, political, and economic shifts have shaped the term Latino in the United States but also connect those processes to ongoing discussions of immigration reform and border security. This course fulfills critical thinking and cross-cultural perspective learning goals.\n\nAMST 3600.10 – Popular Music and Politics\n\nGayle Wald\n\nMW, 2:20-3:10\n\nCRN: 17709\n\nThis interdisciplinary course explores the interactions and intersections of music and politics, focusing on the 20th-century United States. It has units on music and the U.S. state, music and social protest movements, and music and freedom. For spring 2021, there will be new course material on music and #BLM and music and queer/trans/non-binary identities.\n\nAMST 3900.10 – Critiquing Culture\n\nMelani McAlister\n\nMW 12:45-2:00\n\nCRN: 16111\n\nThis course provides an introduction to the major theories and methods that define the field of American studies. In particular, we seek to understand the elusive yet omnipresent world of “culture”—the values, symbols, myths, ideas, ways of life, and systems of meaning that shape our identities and worldviews.\n\nAMST 3901.10 – Examining America\n\nElaine Pena\n\nT 3:30-6:00\n\nCRN: 14583\n\nThis course invites students to examine America using international, transnational, and cross-border processes as optics. A wide array of itineraries, exchanges, networks, and social movements have shaped America and have created dynamic variations of the American experience. Using key works in American Studies, this course shows that the United States is deeply invested in maintaining those long-standing strategies of social reproduction and economic development. But does the cross-border flow of capital, people, ideas, and values weaken or strengthen national character? Do those processes make the category of “nation” obsolete? Do they change the way we think about American racial politics, American citizenship, or what constitutes American religion? We will consider those questions using a variety of interpretive tools. We will also situate those discussions within the development of American Studies as a field of study to understand how scholarly debates have changed over time.\n\nAMST 3950.10 – The Iraq Wars\n\nZaynab Quadri\n\nTR, 9:35-10:50\n\nCRN: 18466\n\nNearly twenty years after the “shock and awe” invasion of Baghdad, the Iraq War remains a contested subject in the United States— sharply criticized by some, generally misunderstood by most, if remembered publicly at all. This writing-intensive, interdisciplinary seminar seeks to remedy the knowledge gap by building a multimedia archive with which to study the war, utilizing memoirs, films, news reporting, and government documents to lay a historical foundation. Further, the course will contextualize the 2003-2011 conflict in a longer trajectory of American foreign policy in Iraq and the Middle East from the 1980s to the present. Finally, the course will consider the legacies of the war in U.S. politics and culture, from the changing nature of security and surveillance to popular Hollywood memory. Students will be challenged to analyze the long origins and impacts of the Iraq War(s); survey the deployment of American power in the world; and critically evaluate an array of primary sources and perspectives.\n\nAMST 3950.80 – Freemasonry and American Art\n\nDavid Bjelajac\n\nT 3:30-6:00\n\nCRN: 18167\n\nDuring the eighteenth-century, English, Scottish, Irish and continental European stonemasons’ medieval guild traditions inspired the modern cultural formation of Freemasonry and competing international networks of masonic lodges. Freemasonry attracted men from a wide socio- economic spectrum and found support from both radical revolutionaries and counter- revolutionary conservatives. Barred from membership in White lodges, free African Americans created their own fraternal network of Prince Hall Freemasons. Ever since the Age of Enlightenment and the American and French Revolutions, Freemasonry’s secretive lodge meetings, mysterious initiation rituals and esoteric visual symbols have fostered orthodox Christian opposition and anti-masonic conspiracy theories charging a varying host of purported vices, blasphemies and subversive misdeeds. This course critically examines these conspiracy theories, popularized in a variety of media, while also exploring Freemasonry’s racial, gender and class exclusions/divisions. Freemasonry’s global networking assisted American imperialism and helped shape the nation’s capital. Washington, D.C.’s urban design, historic-revival architecture, monumental sculpture and large-scale history paintings will be subjects for lectures, readings, and class discussions. The seminar will consider the manner in which George Washington himself came to personify American Freemasonry, becoming a model for later United States presidents who joined the fraternity. Students will read both primary and secondary sources and will be required to write papers critically analyzing visual objects and architectural spaces while also evaluating the literature of Freemasonry, anti-masonry and secret-society conspiracies. Contemporary artists such as Matthew Barney, Bill Traylor and Jim Shaw have appropriated masonic emblems and themes.\n\nAMST 4701W.80 – Epidemics in American History\n\nVanessa Northington Gamble\n\nMW 12:45-2:00\n\nCRN: 14663\n\nThis course surveys the history of infectious disease epidemics in the United States from the late nineteenth century to today, including the Covid-19 pandemic. It examines the development of the medical and public health responses to epidemics and the social, political, cultural and economic impact of epidemics on American history and culture. We will use primary documents, historical accounts, memoirs, and films to understand the history of epidemic disease.\n\nAMST 1000.10: Zombie Capitalism\n\nDara Orenstein\n\nT 3:30-6:00\n\nCRN: 56078\n\nThe Walking Dead. World War Z. “Zombie Banks.” Why does the specter of the living dead loom so largely in contemporary U.S. culture? How is it useful? What does it illuminate about the relationship between capitalism and democracy that might otherwise remain inscrutable? And how has it served in this allegorical manner throughout modern U.S. history? How did it haunt the rise of mass production, or the growth of suburbs, or the eruption of a social movement like Occupy Wall Street? To answer such questions, in this seminar we will screen one film per week, supplemented by brief readings in primary sources, to track the figure of the zombie from the Great Depression to the Great Recession (or, now, the Great Depression 2.0), and from the sugar plantations of Haiti to the tents of Zuccotti Park and the COVID-19 morgues of Detroit.\n\nAMST 1000.11 – World of Bob Dylan\n\nGayle Wald\n\nTR, 9:35-10:50AM\n\nCRN: 58235\n\nThis dean’s seminar investigates the life and art of Bob Dylan, placing Dylan in the context of the wider social, cultural, and political forces have shaped and influenced him. We’ll investigate Dylan’s own creative work (primarily music, but also writing and visual art) as well as creative and scholarly work that Dylan’s persona and music have inspired. We’ll also pay attention to figures that are sometimes relegated to the margins of the Dylan story, especially the women and people of color with whom Dylan has long engaged in a complex dance of love and theft. This course is not meant as an uncritical love letter to Bob Dylan or an exercise in hagiography (although we’ll briefly delve into the domain of Dylanologists). It is rather about Dylan the person/artist and “Dylan” as a lens into American history and culture. No previous Dylan experience necessary!\n\n**This course satisfies a GPAC requirement in Creative Thinking**\n\nAMST 1100.10 Politics and Film\n\nElisabeth Anker\n\nM 3:45-5:00 and M 7:10-9:40\n\nCRN: 53373\n\nThis class addresses the relationship between politics and film by examining how American films interpret and challenge political power in America. We pair film analysis with readings in political theory to interrogate the operations of power in political life. Exploring films thematically, first we examine those that shape conventional interpretations of political power in America, including concepts of limited government, popular sovereignty, and liberal individualism. Next, we consider films that challenge these ideas by offering alternate conceptions of how power functions, while addressing questions of ideology, surveillance, domination, and biopolitics. The last section investigates particular genres—melodrama, the western, and film noir—that reshape and rearticulate these themes within American political culture. Throughout, we will focus on how to read the visual language of film and the written texts of political theory. Students must also register for a discussion section to satisfy the course requirement.\n\nAMST 2010.80: Early American Cultural History\n\nNicole Ivy\n\nMW 2:20-3:10\n\nCRN: 52329\n\nThis course explores how people’s efforts to make meaning of natural landscapes, built environments, social worlds, and encounters of difference influenced the formation of the United States. We track the development of national ideas about freedom and democracy alongside the evolution of everyday beliefs and practices in order to explore what culture might mean as a category of study-- and what difference the study of culture makes. Same as HIST 2010.\n\nAMST 2071.80: Introduction to the Arts in America\n\nDavid Bjelajac\n\nMW 12:45-2:00\n\nCRN: 54009\n\nThis is a lecture survey of American art from the colonial period to the postmodern present. Primarily focused upon painting, the course also covers sculpture, architecture, printmaking and photography within the broader visual and material culture of United States history. Art works are analyzed in relation to issues of religion, nationalism, ethnicity, race, class and gender.\n\nAMST​ 2320.80: U.S. Media and Cultural History ​\n\nMelani McAlister\n\nTR 12:45-1:35PM\n\nCRN: 54972\n\nThis course will examine mass culture – film, radio, music, television, internet – and its role in US history from the turn of the 20th century to the present. Focusing on cultural production, consumption, and reception, this course will consider the historical contexts in which popular culture has emerged and developed. The cultural texts we will study range from silent films to 1950s sitcoms and twenty-first century new media. Students will learn to consider media histories in light of theoretical debates about ideology, media effects, national identity, ethnic and racial identity, gender roles, and imperialism. Reading and viewing requirements are extensive. In addition to other course requirements, student work includes a final paper in which students analyze a media artifact in its historical and cultural context.\n\nAMST 2410W.80: 20th Century US Immigration\n\nTom Guglielmo\n\nMW 9:35-10:25AM\n\nCRN: 57718\n\nThis class will investigate immigration patterns, immigration policy, and immigrants’ lives in the United States from the turn of the twentieth century to the present. Which immigrant groups have come to the United States? When and why have they come? And what have their lives been like once they got here? How has the federal government, and Americans more generally, responded to immigrants and immigration? Why have we welcomed some newcomers as good future Americans and scorned others as “forever foreigners” or “illegal aliens”? The course will explore these questions through a mix of reading, writing, lecture, and discussion. This course will satisfy a WID requirement.\n\nAMST 2430.10: Capitalism and Culture\n\nDara Orenstein\n\nTR 9:35-10:25AM\n\nCRN: 57097\n\nAs of this writing, in April, GW is online. Most of the nation is under quarantine. And the world as we knew it is over. Why are the shelves empty of toilet paper? Why are ventilators in short supply? Why are hospitals laying off doctors and nurses? Why is Congress bailing out the airline industry, the cruise industry, the oil industry? Why are the people who are now recognized as “essential workers”—the food-service workers, the healthcare workers, the transit workers, the warehouse workers—also the same people who are most vulnerable, structurally speaking, to premature death? (And why, by the way, is GW online?) Any answer to these questions must contend with one word: capitalism. And it is not “capitalism” merely in terms of the dollars and cents that needs to be examined (or, autopsied). It is equally the culture of capitalism that is at the root of the pandemic of COVID-19. This reading-intensive, discussion-based course is an introduction to scholarship in the arts, humanities, and social sciences on the culture of capitalism. Organized thematically, and with a historical sensibility, it investigates how, in a capitalist framework, concepts like “productivity,” “growth,” and “value” are, increasingly, threats to life itself.\n\nAMST 2620.10: Human Mind and Artificial Intelligence\n\nJamie Cohen-Cole\n\nTR 11:10-12:00\n\nCRN: 57099\n\nWhere is the boundary between humans and robots? Is it that humans can bleed and robots can rust? Or is there something more important that gets to what is distinctive about humanity? Is it how we think, our intelligence, or our language? If so, then what happens when computers or robots or robots speak and perform intelligent tasks? Focusing on questions such as these this class looks at the history of computers, robots, and artificial intelligence. In tracking this history we will see how the line between humans and machines has been in constant motion as what we believe, and imagine about machines had affected what we know, imagine, and believe about the human mind. We will examine these themes by reading about computers, robots, and artificial intelligence in history and through the visions of the future given in science fiction stories and movies from Frankenstein to AI and I Robot. Topics covered in this course include Charles Babbage's analytical engine, the Turing Machine, cyberspace, and the origins, development, and criticism of research in artificial intelligence.\n\nAMST 3625.80: Ethnographic and Historical Perspectives on Data Ethics\n\nJamie Cohen-Cole and Joel Kuipers\n\nT 12:45-3:15\n\nCRN: 58013\n\nThis class is an introduction to ethics of data sciences from two disparate perspectives: historical and ethnographic. The course focuses on the ethical and moral dilemmas posed by the collection and use of large data sets, by artificial intelligence, and by our increasingly on-line lives. Issues we will examine include the erosion of public life in the face of mediated remote communication, government and corporate surveillance; loss of privacy; the interaction of social media and democratic norms; and the substitution of artificial algorithmic and automatic processes for human judgment in policy making and practices of everyday life. The course is open to students from all fields. It is designed as an interdisciplinary meeting ground for students interested in humanistic inquiry and those in the data science major and other STEM fields. It will be useful to students in social sciences involved in the generation, recording, curation, processing, sharing and use of data; While it is a stand-alone course, it provides a “front door” for further research into the study of ethical life in an electronically mediated world through the methods of historical methods and digital ethnography. While it is a stand-alone course, it provides a “front door” for further research into the study of ethical life in an electronically mediated world through social scientific or humanistic methods. Those wishing further studies in these areas may consider continuing on with courses such as AMST 2610 Science, Technology and Politics in Modern America, AMST 2620 Human Minds and Artificial Intelligence, and AMST 2680 Hashtag America.\n\nAMST 3900.10: Critiquing Culture\n\nMelani McAlister\n\nT 3:30-6:00\n\nCRN: 54362\n\nThis course provides an introduction to the major theories and methods that define the field of American studies. In particular, we seek to understand the elusive yet omnipresent world of “culture”—the values, symbols, myths, ideas, ways of life, and systems of meaning that shape our identities and worldviews.\n\nAMST 3901.10: Examining America\n\nElisabeth Anker\n\nT 12:45-3:15\n\nCRN: 57106\n\nThis course offers students an introduction to the history, debates, and methodologies that are central to the field of American Studies. Students will analyze key texts in American Studies scholarship from the foundational ―Myth and Symbol school to contemporary transnational works. Students will also be introduced to different approaches to interdisciplinary research. Registration restricted to American Studies majors.\n\nAMST 4500W.10: STEM and its Cultures\n\nJamie Cohen-Cole\n\nR 12:45-3:15\n\nCRN: 56079\n\nThis is an advanced seminar for American Studies majors in which students will write original research papers on an aspect of the cultural role of science, technology and/or medicine (STM) in America. STM has been, variously, a repository of truth and political authority, a source of values, and site of conflict. In the face of wars, climate change, and epidemics, STM provides means of imagining or modeling scenarios and of shaping possible futures. Yet these interventions are not frictionless. Scientific and technological changes sometimes reinforce and at others challenge existing social categories and hierarchies.\n\nIf STM fields and their products have loomed large in American culture – even, to some, defining it – these fields have not been unmoved movers. The fields are subject to cultural and political forces and themselves have internal subcultures that are accessible to cultural critique just as much as any other aspect of American life. Thus, a premise of the class is that STM and other aspects of American culture, society, and politics mutually constitute one another. We will begin with by developing the fundamental skills for writing a research paper and reading exemplary articles. Students will then engage in individual research projects of their own choosing that are based in primary sources and address important scholarly issues related to the cultural analysis of Science, Technology, and Medicine.\n\nAMST 4500W.11: DC Immigration Histories\n\nElaine Peña\n\nW 3:30-6:00\n\nCRN: 57730\n\nThis is an advanced research seminar for American Studies majors. Seminar participants will spend the semester focusing on immigration histories and narratives that are specific to the District of Columbia. Key goals of this course include: choosing an aspect of DC immigration history that you would like to know more about, conceptualizing an original project, undertaking independent research, making connections between individual research agendas and scholarly sources, and producing a substantial research paper. Various methods-- ranging from archival, ethnographic, to built environment-focused or any approach you feel most comfortable with-- may be combined to produce your research paper.\n\nAMST 4702W.80 – Race, Medicine, and Public Health\n\nVanessa Gamble\n\nMW 12:45-2:00PM\n\nCRN: 53489\n\nThis course focuses on the role of race and racism in the development of American medicine and public health by examining the experiences of African Americans from slavery to today. It will emphasize the importance of understanding the historical roots of contemporary policy dilemmas such as racial and ethnic inequalities and inequities in health and health care. The course will challenge students to synthesize materials from several disciplines to gain a broad\n\nunderstanding of the relationship between race, medicine, and public health in the United States. Among the questions that will be addressed are: How have race and racism influenced, and continue to influence, American medicine and public health? What is race? How have concepts of race evolved? What have been some of the historical vulnerabilities of black bodies within the medical system? How has medical thought and practices contributed to the political and soc"
