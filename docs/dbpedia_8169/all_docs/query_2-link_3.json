        "text": "Highest Rated: Not Available\n\nLowest Rated: Not Available\n\nBirthday: Apr 12, 1973\n\nBirthplace: Providence, Rhode Island, USA\n\nActress-model Claudia Jordan became a game show, hosting and reality show staple thanks to her talent and charisma. Born April 12, 1973 in Providence, RI, Jordan was an all-star athlete who competed in track and field in three Junior Olympics, but she also represented her home state in the Miss Teen USA and Miss USA pageants. After stints as a correspondent for \"The Best Damn Sports Show Period\" (Fox Sports Net, 2001-09) and as one of \"Barker's Beauties\" on \"The Price Is Right\" (CBS, 1972- ), Jordan became the model who held suitcase number one on the game show \"Deal or No Deal\" (NBC, 2005-09). Achieving surprising breakout success in this role, Jordan booked acting roles on such series as \"City Guys\" (NBC, 1997-2001) and \"Modern Girl's Guide to Life\" (Style Network, 2003-06). A music video mainstay who appeared in clips by Fabolous and Backstreet Boys, Jordan also co-hosted \"Miss Universe 2009\" (NBC). Jordan achieved even greater popularity as a contestant on a celebrity installment of Donald Trump's reality show \"The Apprentice\" (NBC, 2004- ), and proved so memorable that she returned for the 2012 \"all-stars\" season in 2013.\n\nPhotos\n\nClaudia Jordan Claudia Jordan at arrivals for PEPPERMINT Premiere, Regal LA LIVE, Los Angeles, CA August 28, 2018.
