        "text": "Larsa Pippen has officially found love again.\n\nThe Real Housewives of Miami star recently shared new insight into her relationship with boyfriend Marcus Jordan—the 32-year-old son of NBA legend Michael Jordan—and even revealed how they first got together.\n\n\"We're in a really good place,\" Larsa stated on The Tamron Hall Show Feb. 28. \"I feel like a lot of people think that we've known each other our whole lives, which we have not. We literally just met at a party four years ago and we were just friends.\"\n\nSince the two are both from Chicago, Larsa added they have a lot of mutual friends and \"a lot in common\"—especially since Marcus' dad and Larsa's ex-husband Scottie Pippen were teammates on the Chicago Bulls for years.\n\nAs for Larsa, 48, and Marcus' 16-year age difference, the star isn't bothered by chatter about her dating a younger man.\n\n\"I can't basically explain how someone else feels,\" she said of Scottie, with whom she shares four kids. \"I feel like I live my truth, I'm happy. I feel like we get along, he's my best friend.\"\n\nAt the end of the day, Larsa just wants people to be happy for her.\n\n\"For me being someone who was married to an athlete, it's really hard. You get scrutinized a lot,\" she explained. \"People don't think you should have a life once you get divorced. They think once you're divorced, you're done. And I feel like I've overcome so many different obstacles because I feel like I should have love, I should be able to date who I want. I should be able to live happy and go wherever I want to go and not be judged every time I'm with someone.\""
