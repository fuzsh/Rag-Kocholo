        "text": "Claudia Angela Jordan is an American talk show host, actress, model, businesswoman, and reality television and radio personality who was born on April 12, 1973. She is best known for modeling on the American versions of Deal or No Deal and The Price Is Right, as well as competing on Celebrity Apprentice seasons 2 and 6. Jordan featured in the seventh season of Bravo’s reality show The Real Housewives of Atlanta.\n\nShe was Miss Teen USA in 1991 and Miss USA in 1997, representing Rhode Island. She has also appeared in numerous ads for brands such as Coors Light, Sears, Denny’s, and Pepsi.\n\nClaudia Jordan competed in the Miss Teen USA beauty pageant in 1990, representing Rhode Island. In 1997, she was crowned Miss Rhode Island USA and placed in the top ten of the Miss USA competition.\n\nJordan performed in music videos for musicians such as the Backstreet Boys, Ginuwine, Fabolous, Charlie Wilson, Joe, Chico DeBarge, D’Angelo, Coolio, Ludacris, and Kenny Lattimore after her success in beauty pageants. She also started appearing in national television ads for brands like Coors Light, Sears, Pepsi, Visa, and Mountain Dew.\n\nClaudia was one of Bob Barker’s “beauties” on CBS’s “The Price Is Right” from 2001 to 2003, and Jordan was hired for the American version of “Deal or No Deal” in 2005, where he held the briefcase #1 for four seasons.\n\nClaudia started her first hosting position in 2003 as a red-carpet correspondent for Fox Sports West’s “54321,” and she also started appearing on “The Best Damn Sports Show Period.” For two seasons, she co-hosted “The Modern Girl’s Guide to Life” on The Style Network.Claudia featured on the second season of “Celebrity Apprentice” in 2009, when she and the other celebrities earned money for a charity of their choosing, which Jordan chose to be the North American Psychoanalytic Confederation. Claudia co-hosted the 2009 Miss Universe competition with Billy Bush in the Bahamas the same year.\n\nJordan was a star on Jamie Foxx’s satellite radio show “The Foxxhole,” and in December 2012, she began co-hosting Tameka Cottle’s discussion show “Tiny’s Tonight.” Claudia also hosted the AT&T travel show “The Summer of Adventure” that year, and Jordan returned to the “Celebrity Apprentice” in 2013 to compete on the All-Star version of the show. Claudia confirmed in October 2014 that she will be joining the cast of “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” for its seventh season as one of the main housewives. Jordan was simultaneously working as a co-host on the “Rickey Smiley Morning Show” while filming “The Real Housewives of Atlanta.”\n\nClaudia hosted “The Morning Rush,” a one-year-old morning show in Dallas that was the top-rated R&B morning show in the city. Jordan conducts a chat program on Fox Soul Platform, an American internet streaming service, as of 2020.\n\nClaudia had a feud with OG cast member NeNe Leakes during her stint on the show because of her strong friendship with Kenya. After NeNe slammed Claudia with charges that she was being controlled by Kenya, the two had an epic dinner table brawl. Despite holding her own and “reading” NeNe, as noticed by Kandi Burruss and Cynthia Bailey, Claudia was not asked back as a series regular on the successful franchise. Jordan also became close friends with Leakes’ former BFF Cynthia Bailey during her time on the show.\n\nOn the 7th season, Jordan and Leakes had multiple verbal spats, including the now-famous episode during a group trip to Puerto Rico in which Leakes accused Jordan of lacking a brain. Jordan was also assailed by Leakes, who called her promiscuous.\n\nThe women were still at odds by the time the season 7 reunion was taped. Jordan claimed Leakes had an inflated ego and thought her co-stars were beneath her. Jordan was allegedly plotting to be at odds with Leakes in order to save her spot on the program, according to Leakes.\n\nHowever, the show runners are now looking into the possibility of inviting Jordan back into the show with Cynthia Bailey and Porsha Williams‘ recent exit."
