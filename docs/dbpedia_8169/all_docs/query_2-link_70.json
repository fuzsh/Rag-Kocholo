        "text": "*Porsha Williams will not be a main cast member when “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” returns next month for its seventh season.\n\nInstead, she’ll have a “recurring” role on the series, which will chronicle her newly single life as she takes up a job as a gossip reporter.\n\nBravo revealed the news this morning while confirming earlier reports that media personality Claudia Jordan will indeed join returning vets Kenya Moore, NeNe Leakes, Kandi Burruss, Phaedra Parks and Cynthia Bailey in the main cast.\n\nAlso, actress Demetria McKinney (best known for her role as Janine Payne in “Tyler Perry’s House of Payne”) will have a recurring role similar to Porsha.\n\nIn the grand tradition of the show, she also is not a housewife, but rather a girlfriend to TV, film and theatrical producer Roger Bobb.\n\nBorn in London and raised in Brooklyn, Bobb is the president and CEO of Bobbcat Films, a film and TV production company based out of Atlanta. He was a former executive for Tyler Perry Studios and winner of six NAACP Image Awards.\n\nAs for the vets…\n\nAccording to Bravo, Kenya will have a “leading storyline” and NeNe will be seen pursuing her growing career as an actress and performer. The show will also follow Phaedra dealing with the aftermath of her husband Apollo Nida’s incarceration, after he was sentenced to eight years in prison this past summer for fraud.\n\nThe new season premieres Sunday, Nov. 9, at 8 p.m. ET.\n\nAbout Post Author"
