        "text": "TURNER â€“ On Feb. 17 2021, Claudia Jordan unexpectedly passed away in her home in Turner, Maine.\n\nClaudia was born March 25, 1946, to parents Madeline and Harold Jordan. The oldest of four siblings, she grew up in a loving and busy household in Auburn. Claudia would go on to graduate from Edward Little High School before continuing her education at UMF. Through a varied career, she would eventually spend 15 years with Geiger Brothers, after which she would go onto another eight years with Mardens before finally retiring.\n\nA very active person, even in retirement, Claudia loved the company of others and to stay busy by playing cards with friends, going off for a drive, enjoying her love of Native American culture at a Pow Wow, making new friends at the gym or in her cardio group, or even enjoying a family cookout at her favorite lake, Range Pond. A quiet night at home was often spent filling her love of reading with another good book, while a purring cat sat in her lap. She loved to spending time with her grandsons.\n\nShe will be deeply missed by her siblings, Joanne Charpentier, Lynn Ross, Scott Jordan and his wife Ragena Jordan; her son and his wife, Leigh and Hayley Jordan; her grandchildren, Gabriel, Wyatt, and Elijah Jordan; nieces and nephews, Sara Needham, Travis and Erin Ross, Tyler and Rebecca Ross, Jessica Jordan, and Jeremy Jordan; her cousins, and many grandnieces and grandnephews.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please consider making a donation to one of her favorite charities, The Greater Androscoggin Humane Society.\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors."
