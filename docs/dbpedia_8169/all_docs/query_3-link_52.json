Prior to this role, he served as a National UN Volunteer at UNDP Egypt, where he assisted the Egyptian Government in producing and launching various knowledge products and flagship publications, such as the National Human Development Report, and supported the Egyptian Foreign Ministry, representing the CoP27 Presidency, in organizing preliminary consultations with multilateral stakeholders. During an internship at FAO, Karim was in charge of coordinating the Young Scientists Group, which focuses on providing scientific evidence and technical knowledge to various initiatives within the World Food Forum and supported the Youth Action Track in organizing key events of the 2023 Flagship Event.

She holds a Master’s degree in Languages for International Communications and Cooperation.\n\nMs Ludovica Nesbitt is a junior consultant with a master's degree in International Relations and global studies. She is committed to collaborating with a wide range of stakeholders within the food systems domain, a dedication that has been cultivated through her extensive international encounters. Moreover, Ludovica had the opportunity to undertake an internship at the Council of Europe and later on, with the UN Food Systems Coordination Hub itself, which allowed her to experience closely how international actors get to work together. With her academic background, international and practical experiences, Ludovica is poised to make a significant impact on the world stage in addressing the challenges of global food systems.\n\nBorn in Morocco, Mr Abdellatif Abdelmoula has a strong educational background in law, international arbitration, and mediation.

This academic background has provided him with a profound awareness of the pivotal importance foreign affairs, diplomacy and intercultural networks play in tackling global challenges. Before joining the Hub, he dedicated himself to actively join two different civil society organizations targeting the youth with the objective of empowering younger generations and strengthening their role both within international organizations and across our society. In this role, he also participated as member of a delegation to the 2023 World Food Forum Flagship Event, thus having the possibility to watch from a close point of view how the international community is addressing and implementing food systems transformation. With a keen interest in contributing to the work of international organizations, he is committed to putting his knowledge and capabilities to work with the UN Food Systems Coordination Hub. During his internship at the Hub, he supports the knowledge management activities and other cross cutting work within the team."
