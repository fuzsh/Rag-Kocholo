        "text": "Jim Jordan\n\nAmerican politician\n\nJim Jordan (born February 17, 1964, Troy, Ohio, U.S.) is a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Ohio, who is widely seen as one of the legislative body’s most conservative members. Jordan was first elected to Congress in 2006 and was instrumental in the founding of the House Freedom Caucus in 2015, becoming the first chair of the group of ultra-conservative House members. Jordan, a close ally of former U.S. president Donald Trump, sought to be elected speaker of the House in October 2023 after Kevin McCarthy’s historic ouster from that role.\n\nEarly years\n\nJordan was raised in Champaign county, Ohio. His mother, Shirley Jordan, ran a housecleaning business, and his father, John Jordan, worked at a General Motors plant. Jordan excelled as a high-school wrestler, winning the Ohio state championships four times.\n\nAfter high school, Jordan attended the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he was twice a National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I wrestling champion. He competed in the 1988 Olympic wrestling trials but failed to make the U.S. team. After graduating with a bachelor’s degree in economics in 1986, Jordan earned a master’s in education (1991) from The Ohio State University (OSU) and a law degree (2001) from Capital University in Columbus, Ohio. He never took the bar exam.\n\nCoaching and politics\n\nJordan coached wrestling at OSU from 1987 to 1995. In 1994 he was first elected to public office, beginning the first of his three terms in the Ohio House of Representatives. In 2000 he was elected to the Ohio Senate, where he was reelected in 2004. In 2005, shortly after Rep. Mike Oxley (1981–2007) announced he would not seek reelection the following year, Jordan entered the race for the 4th district seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. Jordan won the Republican primary, easily defeated his Democratic challenger, and has held the seat since taking office in 2007.\n\nJordan’s rise to power in the Republican ranks has not always been as smooth. He is known for being hard-charging and quick-talking as he moves through the halls of Congress, often in shirtsleeves. Jordan chaired the Republican Study Committee (RSC) during the 112th Congress, which met from January 2011 to January 2013, and he played a large role in the 2013 shutdown of the federal government for 16 days in a bid to end funding for the Affordable Care Act (ACA). His positions on issues have earned him criticism, even from members of his own party, with former House speaker and fellow Republican and Ohioan John Boehner notably calling Jordan a “legislative terrorist” in a 2017 interview with Politico Magazine. In addition to his opposition to the ACA, Jordan cosponsored legislation in 2015 to ban same-sex marriage, opposed vaccine mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic, and is opposed to abortion.\n\nJordan ran to become speaker of the House in 2013 and 2015, getting two votes and one vote, respectively. He also lost to McCarthy in 2019 for the role of House minority leader by a vote of 159–43. In 2018 a sexual abuse scandal involving OSU’s athletics program led to allegations that Jordan knew of the abuse and did nothing to stop it. Jordan has said he was unaware of wrongdoing.\n\nJordan and Trump\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Jordan was often animated in his defense of Trump during the president’s first impeachment trial, involving Trump’s 2019 phone call with Ukrainian Pres. Volodymyr Zelensky. During the call Trump threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine unless Zelensky investigated the business dealings of Joe Biden’s son Hunter. Jordan also supported lawsuits to question the validity of the 2020 U.S. presidential election and refused on January 6, 2021, to certify the election’s results. He was subpoenaed to testify before the House select committee on the January 6 attack but refused to appear. Trump awarded Jordan the Presidential Medal of Freedom less than a week after the riot at the Capitol.\n\nAfter McCarthy’s ouster from the speaker role in 2023, Trump endorsed Jordan, saying on social media that “he will be a GREAT Speaker of the House, & has my Complete & Total Endorsement!” However, former Republican representative of Wyoming Liz Cheney, who served as vice chair of the January 6 committee, said in a speech at the University of Minnesota in October 2023 that if Jordan were elected “there would no longer be any possible way to argue that a group of elected Republicans could be counted on to defend the Constitution.”\n\nPersonal life\n\nJordan married his wife, Polly, in 1985. They were high-school sweethearts, meeting when he was 13 and she was 14. The couple has four grown children.\n\nJacob Stovall"
