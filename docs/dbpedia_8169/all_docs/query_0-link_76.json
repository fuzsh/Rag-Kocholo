(R.I.W.B.L.) — Every year, Providence’s Jeffrey Osborne asks some of his most trusted friends to visit Rhode Island and celebrate the journey to promote the fine and performing arts to children and their families. For Osborne, who grew up on Olney Street in the Mount Hope section of Providence, the goal is to help raise money to support local community organizations.\n\n​\n\nFor both Jeffrey and E. Justin, an unwavering love for educating children and providing them a safe space to create what is in their heart is what keeps them going each and every day. It is what binds them together as artists. On August 11-12, the Rhode Island WIFFLE® Ball League is partnering with the Jeffrey Osborne Foundation to make Rhode Island a better place, to continue the push for music and arts to children and their families, while benefitting those who provide a safe haven for families in need. Osborne, 70, feels that, “giving to people in any number of ways is extremely important. So as long as I can do it, I will.\n\n​"
