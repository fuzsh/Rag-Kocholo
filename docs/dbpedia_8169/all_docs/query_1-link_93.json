        "text": "FORMER Real Housewives of Atlanta star Claudia Jordan blasted Bravo producers for its lack of diversity across the franchise.\n\nThe 46-year-old reality star slammed the network on Instagram and got into a nasty feud with Real Housewives of Dallas star Kary Brittingham over the series having “no women of color.”\n\nThe RHOA alum - who appeared on the show from 2014-2015 - called out production under a picture of the Dallas cast: \"And STILL no women of color.... Dallas come on now.\n\n“There are soooo many beautiful, fun, cool wealthy women of considered for this show and still nothing. It didn't have to be me - but PLEASE consider representing better.\n\n“The ratings would surely be affected IN a positive way. Look how Atlanta continues to have the highest ratings.... bring the needed spice.”\n\nNewcomer Kary - who was born and raised in Guadalajara, Mexico - clapped back and revealed Claudia had actually previously auditioned for the Southern cast.\n\nShe wrote: “You did try out and I was actually hoping you would come on the show, but I could make the same argument about many other shows including Atlanta that they don’t have latinas!!!!!\n\n“Are you implying that only black people count as diversity????? Or only black people have spice?????”\n\nClaudia confirmed she did have “one Skype interview for the show” before she moved to LA but the casting did not work out as the outspoken personality fired off: “ I know what y’all get paid and I’m quite ok with my talk show salary.”\n\nShe continued to defend her stance: \"I think the show's should reflect the demographic of the CITY they are portraying.\n\n“Dallas is a big city and they have a large Latin population so they saw fit to add you- a Latina to the show. Which is a great move.”\n\nClaudia then questioned the Bravo star who joined the cast in 2019: “So are you saying they have you so no need for more ethnicities since they have you?\n\n\"Or are you saying all the other shows need to add a Latina woman before we can add a black woman to Dallas??\n\n“It’s about misrepresenting the city. Make it make sense. This isn’t saying Latinas don’t have spice but the fact remains the cast is still Very white.”\n\nAfter the blonde Texas native defended her city had plenty of “spice” without an African American woman on the cast, the model threw shade:\n\n“Don’t you think making it more inclusive would be good for the brand? Many people didn’t even know there was a RHOD.\n\n“Look- The same way I’m sure Latina’s weren’t interested in watching the show until they was someone their community could relative too- is the same way many black women feel. It’s really just common sense.”\n\nThe Real Housewives spinoff from Orange County and New York have also lacked women of color on their cast since the shows began to air in 2006.\n\nBravo announced in August actress and model Garcelle Beauvais joined the cast of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and will be the first African American woman to be featured on the show.\n\nDo you have a story for The US Sun team?"
