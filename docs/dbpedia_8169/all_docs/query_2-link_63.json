Don’t be afraid or look down upon aging. And it’s dumb to call someone ‘old’ (as an insult) that’s actually doing what they’re supposed to be doing in this world. Aging means you’re still here and you made it thru some things. The alternative to NOT aging is no longer existing, no longer growing and no longer LIVING. Live your life loud and unapologetically,” she wrote on Instagram."
