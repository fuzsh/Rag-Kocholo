Whether sudden or in the making for years, circumstances vary but one thing is constant; it is an opportunity for personal growth and change. In this program participants will work through group exercises and progress toward healing, rebuilding trust &recovery from separation, divorce, or the ending of a relationship. Join us in a structured 8-Week program in an intimate group setting for people experiencing the end of a long-term relationship or marriage based on Rebuilding When Your Relationship Ends (W.Y.R.E.) by Bruce Fisher.\n\nFacilitated by: Toya Foster, Licensed Professional Counselor-Intern\n\nOpen to anyone needing help through the group process to move forward in healing and rebuilding their life.\n\nFor more information and registration visit: https://tcfr-atx.regfox.com/rebuilding-when-your-relationship-ends\n\nThis group is a continuation of the W.Y.R.E. Group offered for many years by Dr. Larry Miller in Austin, TX.\n\nPre- Group Screening via phone will be required prior to joining\n\n“Many books on divorce only talk about the problems… Dr. Bruce Fisher has given us a very practical and useful framework within which to examine… the life that comes after the divorce. He presents it as a period in which one can learn from the past, get to know oneself better and to help to develop new parts of the self that were previously unknown.”– Virginia Satir, MSW"
