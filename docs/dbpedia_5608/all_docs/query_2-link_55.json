The family moved to Oklahoma City in 1945 and she graduated from John Marshall High School in 1957.  Following in the footsteps of her mother and grandmother, Charlene has been a lifelong member of the Church of Christ.  Charlene's life took a momentous turn when she began to attend the 36th and Prospect Church of Christ where she met the love of her life, Larry Calvin Miller, as a Junior in high school.  They were married on July 17, 1959, embarking on a lifelong journey together that would be marked by devotion and unwavering support for one another.  They would go on to have a daughter, Mindy Jane Miller in 1962 and their son, Martin Larry Miller in 1967.  Although she poured her heart and soul into raising both of her children, Charlene's life's mission was being the main caretaker and constant companion for Marty in navigating his life with Cerebral Palsy.  Charlene was a loving grandmother to six grandchildren and ten great-grandchildren.  In 1977, Charlene, Larry, and their children joined the Edmond Church of Christ.  She co-led divorce recovery groups with Larry.  They were an important part of classes such as the Overcomers, the Young Families, and the Prime Time.  She taught bible class for children in various age groups.  Charlene enjoyed her role as an elder's wife.  She also made hundreds of chicken pies and countless snicker-doodles for her church family and neighbors.  Charlene studied Psychology and Sociology at UCO.  She and Larry sold real estate starting in 1993 with Abide, later to become Prudential Realty, where they were named Rookies of the Year.  She knitted scarfs, purses, and dish cloths.  Charlene was a meticulous housekeeper.  She valued cleanliness and was always ready to remind people to wash their hands.  She was part of the welcoming committee for her neighborhood HOA and volunteered at Edmond Neighborhood Alliance events.  She sent cards to many people in her family, friends, and congregation.  Charlene was a builder of relationships and her warm and inviting nature made everyone around her feel a part of her world.   Charlene loved the family dogs, especially Sugar Bear and Chloe, and although she also loved Honey Bear, she bit Charlene their first day together.  Charlene was a rather reluctant traveler with Larry and Marty where they built beautiful memories.  However, she would almost always have the threesome return a day or two early, as there was no place she cherished more than the comfort of her own home.  Charlene will be remembered for her  kindness and compassion by her family and friends.  In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation to \"In Search of The Lord's Way -Television Ministries.\"  Visitation will be held Thursday, July 6, 2023, from 1:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. at Matthews Funeral Home. Family will be present to greet friends and guests from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. at Matthews Funeral Home.   Services will be held Friday, July 7, 2023, beginning at 10:00 a.m. at the Edmond Church of Christ. Interment is to follow at Gracelawn Cemetery in Edmond, Oklahoma.
