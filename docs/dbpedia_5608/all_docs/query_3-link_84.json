        "text": "Larry Delmar Miller, 80, of California, Missouri passed away Wednesday, January 10, 2024, after a long battle of numerous health issues related to his military service.\n\nLarry was born on October 23, 1943, in Pekin, Illinois, the son of the late Delmar and Elva Miller.\n\nOn August 17, 1975, he was united in marriage to Rose Mary (Moeller) Herzing. Together they raised four children. He was very proud of his family, especially his grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.\n\nHe loved fishing and was an active member of the Disabled American Veterans until his health declined.\n\nHe took great pride in his military service, serving active duty in both Vietnam and the Gulf War. He was in the Special Forces and took his orders literally to his grave as he would not divulge specifics in order to obtain Agent Orange benefits. He was a proud member of Honor Flight #43.\n\nHe is survived by his wife of forty-eight years, Rose Mary Miller; children, Deborah (David) Holzer, Larry (Veronica) Herzing, Patricia (Ron) Morrow, and Tracy (Kevin) Bonecutter; grandchildren, Joshua (Sera) Holzer, Isaac (Cassy) Holzer, Samuel Holzer, Matt Falk Herzing, Megan Herzing, Allison Morrow, Shelby Morrow, Katie Herzing (fianc√© Josh Phillips), Cody Bonecutter and Acacia Bonecutter; and great-grandchildren, Blair Holzer and Jacob Holzer.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents.\n\nVisitation will be 10-11:00 a.m. Saturday, January 13, 2024, at St. Martin Catholic Church. Mass of Christian Burial will follow at 11 a.m. with the Very Rev. Jason T. Doke, officiating.\n\nBurial with Military Honors will be in St. Martin Catholic Cemetery West.\n\nMemorials are suggested to Disabled American Veterans or the California Fire Department.\n\nWe would like to especially thank the California Fire Department and the First Responders for all their frequent calls to the house and the compassion and dignity they always showed him and our family.\n\nMay his soul finally rest in peace."
