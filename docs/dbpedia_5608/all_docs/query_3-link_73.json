        "text": "David Winegardner, 84, of Indianapolis, IN passed away peacefully at his home with his family by his side on August 3, 2024. He was born December 10, 1939 in Greentown, IN to Miller and Mary Doris Winegardner.\n\nDavid grew up on a family farm that is now a Hoosier Homestead and had many fond memories and stories of life on the farm. After graduating Ball State University, he entered into the Air Force and served in North Dakota, Alaska, Mississippi, and Wisconsin. David met Roberta Paul at Ball State. They married in July 1962 and had 62 wonderful years together. After being discharged from the Air Force David embarked on his accounting career where he proudly served clients for 54 years, retiring in 2019. He especially enjoyed mentoring young accountants throughout his career and setting them up for success. David was active in his church, most recently East 91st Christian Church. Together he and Roberta enjoyed family vacations and traveling, especially with their grandsons. He enjoyed music, and singing in the church choir.\n\nDavid is survived by his loving wife, Roberta Winegardner; daughter, Cindi Winegardner; son, Rick (Beth) Winegardner; grandchildren, Sam Winegardner and Tom Winegardner; sisters, Annette (Larry) LaRowe and Donna (Kent) McQuiston; and several nieces and nephews.\n\nThe family would like to extend a special thanks to Guardian Angel Hospice and At Home Preferred Senior Companions for the excellent care throughout their service to David.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made in David's honor to: East 91st Street Christian Church Foundation, 6049 E. 91st St., Indianapolis, IN 46250 or THE ARK Christian Ministries, 3522 N 1000 W 27, Converse, IN 46919."
