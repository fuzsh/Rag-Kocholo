        "text": "Larry Miller is a multiple Emmy and Edward R. Murrow Award winning Morning News Anchor and Consumer Investigative Reporter for WUSA 9-TV in Washington, D.C. He joined the team in 2015, anchoring WUSA 9’s morning newscast, Get Up DC, and the News at 12pm.\n\nLarry’s field reporting and breaking news coverage, including the death of George Floyd, Black Lives Matters demonstrations and investigations into a deadly shooting at the Pentagon have earned him countless accolades from community advocates and leaders in the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia.\n\nHis investigation on housing appraisal bias in minority communities garnered national attention. It was his reporting that helped to change laws in Maryland to protect homeowners.\n\nPrior to his time in Washington, Larry worked in Birmingham, Alabama at WBMA-TV and Medford, Oregon at KOBI-TV.\n\nLarry Miller takes pride in serving the Washington Metropolitan community. A graduate of the Maryland Youth Ballet in 2005, he now sits on its Board of Directors. In addition to being a full-time journalist, Larry is also an Assistant Professor at Prince George’s Community College where he teaches classes in speech communications and news writing.\n\nIn 2019, Larry was selected by the National Association of Black Journalists as its Ethel Payne Fellow. He spent five days in Johannesburg, South Africa investigating the country’s on-going discussions around land reform and its economic implications. Larry has also reported from Germany; examining how the country has changed more than 30 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n\nHe holds a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology from the University of Pittsburgh and Master of Arts in Journalism and Mass Communication from Point Park University.\n\nWhen Larry isn’t working, he’s either writing or running. Larry is currently writing a book on his yearlong investigation uncovering allegations of home appraisal bias in Maryland. In his spare time, he’s training to his third 50 mile race in December 2022."
