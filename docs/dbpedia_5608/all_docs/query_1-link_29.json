        "text": "November 27, 1935 ~ January 23, 2024\n\nCEDAR – Larry James Miller, 88, of Cedar and formerly of Livonia, Michigan died Tuesday, January 23, 2024, at home with his loving family at his side after a 7-month battle with cancer.\n\nLarry was born in Detroit, the son of John and Mary Miller. Larry graduated high school from Dearborn High with a perfect attendance record. He earned his bachelor’s degree from Hillsdale College, master’s degree from Wayne State University and his Specialist’s Degree in Education from Eastern Michigan University. He a was career educator in elementary and middle schools as both a teacher and principal. He started his career in Livonia Public Schools and then moved to Plymouth Canton Public Schools. He was the principal of Field Elementary School for 27 years and prior to retiring, he opened Bentley Elementary School in Canton, Michigan. Educating his students and staff was his passion in life. This passion was validated by the continued contact he maintained and the thanks he received from both former students and staff members.\n\nOn June 14, 1961, he married Laureen J. (Konkel) Miller at Zion Lutheran Church in Detroit. Laurie and Larry’s spark of love started metaphorically and literally on their first date when an errant cigarette butt accidentally started the back seat on fire in Larry’s dad’s Plymouth! In a karmic balancing act, Larry took to the water to propose. The place was on South Manistique Lake in Curtis, MI while on a romantic rowboat ride. Larry asked Laureen’s dad, Arthur Konkel, for his daughters’ hand in marriage. Art said yes and the rest was history. Their two sons Tim and Paul were born. The two educators raised their family in Livonia, MI. They owned a nice ranch home that was always a gathering place for neighbors and friends. Larry grew extremely close to his in-laws Art and Eleanor Konkel and considered Art the greatest man he ever knew. He said he learned from Art that the investment of time not material things was the best gift that persons could give to each other! Larry had an unrivaled work ethic that he learned from his father John Miller.\n\nA lifelong University of Michigan and Detroit Pro Sports fan. He was at the 1957 NFL Championship Game where the Detroit Lions defeated the Cleveland Browns. Multiple Red Wing Hockey games at Olympia. He attended the Tigers World Series wins in 1968 and 1984. Family trips to Pasadena, CA to see the Wolverines in the 1993 and 2004 Rose Bowls. This year while battling cancer, Larry got to see his Wolverines win the 2024 Rose Bowl and then the National Championship. In his last days he also cheered on the Lions as they make their playoff run this year… Sparky Anderson, former manager of the Detroit Tigers personally congratulated Larry for his volunteer and fund-raising work in Sparky’s CATCH Charity.\n\nLarry was a man of great faith. He loved God and knew of eternal life through his son Jesus Christ. Larry and Laureen are longtime members of Immanuel Lutheran Church of Suttons Bay and devoted much time to the church. He sang in the choir, wrote several plays for church, helped with funeral luncheons, started a euchre club and many other activities. It gives his family great joy to know he’s with the Lord.\n\nLarry, affectionately known as “LaLa” loved his family and was always so excited to see them come Up North to visit. So many memories were made at the cottage in the U.P., on the Leelanau Peninsula, and on the beaches of Florida, Brazil and the Bahamas. Larry loved to swim and travel! He also loved sweets…especially white cake. He was a fan of estate sales and would find special treasures for each family member. A gentle and kind person whose word was his bond. An honest man of integrity. Generous, loving, loyal and approachable are words that describe him. He could also be set in his ways and stubborn…He gave great hugs, and you could feel his warmth. He touched many lives and will be greatly missed by his family and friends.\n\nHe was always “game” to do anything with his family, he enjoyed playing euchre, Tripoli and many other games. Larry loved America. He especially loved the flag and Flag Day. The Fourth of July celebrations and parades were always his favorite.\n\nLarry is survived by his loving wife of 62 years, Laureen; his sons, Timothy (Jennifer) Miller, Paul (Kristin) Miller, Milton (Aline) Pacheco de Andrade, Marcos Pacheco de Andrade; and his grandchildren, Josephine Miller, Wesley Miller, Danny Miller, Felipe Andrade and Lucas Andrade. God Daughters Debbie Damesworth Mayer, Jacque Smith, Sally North and Joelle Wallace.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents John and Mary Miller; brother Jack Miller, sister-in-law Joyce Miller, his father & mother-in-law Arthur and Eleanor Konkel. Visitation will be held on Friday, February 9, 2024, at the Martinson Funeral Home of Suttons Bay from 2 to 5pm and from 6 to 8pm. The funeral service will be held on Saturday, February 10, 2024, at 10:30am at Immanuel Lutheran Church of Suttons Bay. The family will be greeting guests starting at 9:30am. Pastor Jonathan Reid will preside.\n\nBurial in the Swedish Mission Cemetery will be announced later.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorials may be directed to: The Leelanau Conservancy, PO Box 1007, Leland, MI , 49654; Immanuel Lutheran Church, PO Box 206, Suttons Bay, MI 49682 and/or Presbyterian Villages of Michigan at www. pvmfoundation.org Please share condolences with the family at www.martinson.info Arrangements are with the Martinson Funeral Home and Cremation Services of Leelanau."
