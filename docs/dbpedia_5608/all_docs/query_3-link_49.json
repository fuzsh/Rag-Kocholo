        "text": "As part of Excelsior University's celebration of Second Chance Month, yesterday the Center for Social Justice and the Civic Engagement Rope Team had the privilege of hosting Trent Griffin-Braaf, who shared his powerful journey with us in his keynote: 'From Felon to Forbes'. Below are a few highlights of his paradigm-shifting presentation: - The value of family and intentional connection. - The importance of focusing on our health and wellness, regardless of our circumstances. - The relevance of focusing on our personal and professional development. - The power of becoming a forever learner, to learn as much as possible in all situations. - Nothing lasts forever, so put your best step forward every day and focus on learning and preparing for next steps. - Never stop looking for opportunities and pivot as needed. - Remember that an arrow needs to be pulled back before it goes forward. - Focus on identifying needs and pursuing service, leadership, and workforce development opportunities. - Find ways of helping others identify and pursue their goals. - The power of empathy as part of a successful organization and of helping others to do better. - The importance of community engagement and of giving back. Thank you for sharing your leadership, partnership, and story with us, Trent!\n\nIt's nomination season!

Let the judging commence!\n\nWhen I graduated, I had no idea what public affairs firms did. It seemed like the only political career options were going to the hill or a think tank. Navigating life in that first year out of college can be difficult - everyone wants experience, but an internship might be all you have. That's why we created the fellowship: to give young professionals an intro to public affairs, letting them see if that field and THG are the right, long-term fit. If you or someone you know is looking for that next step, DM me, and we can talk next steps.\n\nOn behalf of our entire team at Mentor Connect, I wanted to express our gratitude to Bobby Hulme-Lippert for speaking on our behalf at the Leadership Conference, City of Austin on June 21st, 2024. Your presentation, ‚ÄúBring Your Dance Moves: How Leaders Cultivate Belonging,‚Äù was profoundly impactful. Your explanation of how everyone has unique and important gifts to offer, and how these gifts are best shared when we feel a sense of belonging, resonated deeply with us. We were particularly inspired by your explanation on how leaders can cultivate belonging: 1. Use Improv Comedy‚Äôs ‚ÄúYes, and‚Äù as a Leadership Approach ‚Äì Building from the input, perspective, and strengths of others. 2. Share Stories ‚Äì Providing outlets for team members to appreciate each other‚Äôs stories, even short conversational prompts can quickly build a deeper connection. 3. Practice Gratitude ‚Äì Offering team members specific, personalized expressions of gratitude and recognition for their work. These approaches are especially beneficial for high school students as we navigate formative years, fostering a supportive and inclusive environment that enhances our personal and academic growth. Mentor Connect is truly grateful for your partnership.

The honorees are selected each year by those who have received the honor in the past. Kim Butler Hegedus, a member of our 2001 Forty Under 40 class and our 2023 Forty Under 40 Alum of the Year, is one of our many alumni who help with judging. She says: \"Over the years, this process has become increasingly competitive. ... When I am judging a nominee, I look for effort and quality of the submission. Did they take time to be thoughtful about their career success and how they are advancing themselves and their organization in a meaningful way? Career success is only one factor. How are they balancing professional achievement with community involvement? Did they take time to seek out individuals to give them a solid recommendation? These young professionals are our future leaders and critical to the health of our business community and vibrancy of our community.\" Here, Butler Hegedus spends time with her grandchildren, Jordyn (9) and Brady (5), at a Central College football game. Central is her alma mater, and her oldest son is on the coaching staff. Nominations for our 25th class of Forty Under 40 open in December. Learn more at https://lnkd.in/gPXr7AWm."
