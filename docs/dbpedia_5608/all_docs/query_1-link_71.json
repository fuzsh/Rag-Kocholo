        "text": "Who’s who on the Larry Miller Remodeling Dream Team?\n\nWhile Larry is an amazing craftsman himself, he couldn’t do what he does without his amazing team.\n\nMitchell Brant has been with Larry for 5 years. He is married to Brooke and has twins, Nora and Lincoln. Mitchell and Brooke live in southern Delaware county in a house in the country that Mitchell has substantially remodeled. He is a gifted carpenter! When Mitchell isn’t improving homes, he can be found spending time with his wife and the twins.\n\nMichael Desrosiers has been on the team since spring of 2019. He is married to Rebecca. They live in a communal house with several other people on the near east side of Columbus. Michael does most of the painting and wood finishing work for the team. When not on the job, Michael loves being active…hiking, camping, and exploring the outdoors. He and Rebecca love the concert scene and are huge Grateful Dead fans.\n\nMatt Miller joined the team in 2022. He is married to Inga, and they have a baby girl, Amelia. Matt is a gifted craftsman, and excels at problem solving. He loves working with wood. Matt plays guitar in his off time, and has found he loves being a father!"
