After her marriage, and starting a family, she started working and retired from Northern Engraving of Sparta, WI, in the Quality Assurance Department.\n\nWilma loved to travel when her husband was still alive, they took many vacations traveling to Hardin, Montana. That being their special place for them. After her husband’s passing in 1994, she took many vacations with her daughters and son-in-laws to Vegas, Prescott, and Sun City West, AZ, to visit and stay with 2 of her brothers and their wife’s. Her other destination that she loved was Lake Havasu City to spend time with a classmate Darone Hicks. Oh, the fun those two had!!\n\nWilma also enjoyed reading, playing games on her computer, doing embroidery, going for rides to watch for wildlife, visiting casinos, and going to lunch with her cousins.\n\nShe is survived by her two daughters Denise Nibbelink (Allen), Gina Scholl (Jeff) both of La Crosse, WI.
