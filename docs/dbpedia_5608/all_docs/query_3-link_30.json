        "text": "Larry James Cooper age 76, of Halls, passed away on Wednesday, August 7, 2024, at Heritage Assisted Living. He was a longtime member of Hines Creek Baptist Church, and often would visit Emory Valley Baptist Church. He loved to watch Westerns, but loved spending time with his family more. In 1995, he partnered in opening Nana’s Playschool Inc., where he quickly became known as “Pop” to all the little children he loved and who loved him also. He was preceded in death by his wife, Carolyn Cooper, parents, Tauby and Beulah Cooper, and sister, Linda Cooper. He is survived by his daughter Leeann Cooper Miller and son-in-law, Russell, grandchildren; Whitley, Emily and Cheyenne; great-grandchildren, Sidney and Marley, brother, Gary Cooper, and brothers-in-law: Lon Clayton Allen, Charles Allen and Ray Allen. The family will receive friends Saturday, August 10, 2024, from 5:00 pm – 7:00 pm at Mynatt Funeral Home, Halls Chapel, immediately followed by a 7:00 pm funeral service. Family and friends will meet Sunday, August 11, 2024, at Mynatt Funeral Home, Halls Chapel at 1:15 pm and travel in procession to Hinds Creek Baptist Church Cemetery for a 2:00pm interment service.
