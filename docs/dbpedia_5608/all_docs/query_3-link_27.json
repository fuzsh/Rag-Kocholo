        "text": "Before joining AAFMAA Wealth Management & Trust LLC (AWM&T), Larry began his career as a Regional Wholesaler for the Invesco Funds Group in Denver, CO. In that role, he worked with numerous brokers and investment management firms to provide their clients with educational workshops on diversification and asset allocation. Subsequently, Larry served as an Investment Advisor Representative for a boutique firm specializing in wealth accumulation and retirement planning. During this time, he became familiar with the mechanics of Medicare and coverage options for seniors.\n\nLarry developed a passion for the U.S. Armed Forces while caring for his elderly father, a WWII Navy Veteran. His dad was present at Iwo Jima the day the U.S. Marines raised the American flag atop Mount Suribachi and captured photographs of the famous event.\n\nIn his role as Relationship Manager with AWM&T, Larry brings the same admiration and respect for his father to every client. He leverages his financial services background to provide a top-notch customer experience for all members of the U.S. Armed Forces. Additionally, Larry supports local military and Veteran organizations throughout the state of Colorado.\n\nLarry is a graduate of the Colorado Academy in Denver and Colorado State University. He holds a degree in psychology.\n\nHe and his wife of over 25 years, Kelly, live near Colorado Springs. The recent empty nesters enjoy hiking and fishing at their family cabin. In his spare time, Larry enjoys playing all the classics on his acoustic guitar and learning the art of being a BBQ pitmaster on his Traeger grill."
