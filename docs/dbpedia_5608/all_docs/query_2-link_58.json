        "text": "Why Chris Stapleton is here to stay. I had fun putting my comments on this article from GQ magazine. Do you like him? Is there anyone better in country music out there today? \"THE UNITED STATES OF CHRIS STAPLETON In an age rife with division, he's maybe the only thing Americans all agree on. How did a songwriter who never cared much for being famous transcend country music to become one of today's most popular stars?\" Article by Brett Martin Photographs (including Thumbnail) by Stacy Kranitz #countrymusic #musicindustry #musicbusiness #songwriter #songwriting #songwriters #musician #musicpodcast #music #podcasting #podcaster #podcasts\n\nWelcome, everyone! In today's episode of \"Talking with the Experts,\" Mark Engelhardt will tell you all about himself, his work and the top-down approach in the U.K. Stay tuned for more exciting sessions with Mark on Drop of Wisdom! #assetmanagement #talkingwiththeexperts #markengelhardt #patreon https://lnkd.in/g6-yxwFD\n\nAre we sabotaging our quest for greatness by insisting on understanding everything, rather than embracing the mystery and uncertainty of the journey? Dive into this episode with Moby as he shares his journey from philosphy to music, the 'hungry ghost' of fulfillment, and the crucial role of open-mindedness and ego in our pursuit of true purpose and happiness. Tune in for deep insights on embracing uncertainty and discovering your path to greatness.\n\nIf you're like me, you like to get your news (industry and otherwise) from multiple mediums and sources. For my experiential folks, I highly suggest listening to the \"No More Bad Events\" podcast. Here is a piece of the summary: \"They detail their \"wow plus what\" and \"INVNTion\" methodologies, address the “stacking hands” principal, define the event story arc, talk about Austin’s creative motto, i.e.,” keep it weird, inventive and unique,” celebrate their agency's recent Hermes Creative awards, emphasize the power of storytelling and emotional connections in creating live brand experiences, and how technology in storytelling is unfolding. The conversation delves into the delicate balance of using immersive technologies like VR and AR while preserving the irreplaceable value of in-person events. Actually, McCoobery and Blurton bet big on tech-enhancing real experiences, not replacing them in order to preserve the soul of performances.\" #invnt #podcast #experiential\n\nI've found that playing music in the background when preparing for a speaking event, a podcast, a presentation, a proposal, or something requiring focus helps me. What about you? This is what I'm listening to right now: https://lnkd.in/gUuyAZR4"
