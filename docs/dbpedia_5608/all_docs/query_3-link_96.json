        "text": "His Life and Legacy\n\nLarry Miller, the son of Charles and Mary Agnes Miller was born on January 15, 1952, in Indianapolis, Indiana.\n\nLarry graduated from Arsenal Technical High School. He began his transportation career with Metro/IndyGo in Indianapolis, and he retired after thirty-seven years of service.\n\nLarry was a God-fearing man, as he would often say, “The Lord is my Savior”, and “God loves you and so do I”. He confessed his love for Christ and was baptized at Greater Galilee Missionary Baptist Church.\n\nLarry was united in matrimony to Ethel Mae Johnson in 1981. Their union was blessed with three beautiful daughters. If you asked Larry his greatest accomplishment; he would undoubtedly say his family. Larry was a hard worker and a great provider for his family.\n\nLarry was a family man. He embodied strength and love. He was a proud, loving husband, father, and grandfather.\n\nLarry enjoyed spending time with family and friends, casino trips, traveling, music, and cheering on his hometown teams. His smile and presence would light up any room, to know Larry was to love him. He never met a stranger and after meeting him you were family.\n\nLarry Miller departed this life at the age of sixty-nine years. He was preceded in death by his grandparents, John and Clara Twyman and Thomas and Mary Kelly; his mother, Mary Agnes Miller; his son, Paul Baker “Willie”; and stepbrothers, Stanley Warfield and Tony Warfield.\n\nHe will be greatly missed by his devoted wife, Ethel Mae Miller; daughters, Tiyaka Star Johnson, Larice \"Reese\" and Rochelle Miller; father, Charles Miller; brothers, Ray Charles Miller, and Ronnie Miller; stepbrother, Kevin Warfield; stepsister, Kathy Warfield; grandchildren, Azavia Miller, Ramsey Bates, Diamond Miller, Bryson Bates, Corey Miller, Jadan Webb, Ashley Thompson-Baker, Brandon Baker; great-grandchild, Tavin Brinkley Jr. \"TJ”; a host of aunts, nieces, nephews, other relatives and many friends.\n\nI am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.\n\nJohn 11:25-26\n\nHumbly Submitted……….The Family"
