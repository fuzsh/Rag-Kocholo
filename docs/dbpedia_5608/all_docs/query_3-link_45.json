        "text": "Local golfers can attest that the Little River Golf Course has been very busy this July. Looking at the stats, Pro Shop Manager Kathy Shepley says that compared to July 2023, golf rounds have increased by 25%. Kathy attributes the increase to the fact that there is no sports salmon season, no abalone diving, and the hot inland weather. Many folks routinely come to the coast for a get-a-way this time of year to fish or dive. No fishing or diving. What’s left? I guess we gotta go play golf. Golf Notes has randomly asked golfers on the course why they are here and where they are from. Many have said they are from Ukiah or Willits and are here to get out of the heat.\n\nDriving up from Pt. Arena Butch Carlstedt wasn’t getting out of the heat last Wednesday when he shot three strokes under his age, an admiral 88. Butch, who has taken ninety-one trips around the sun due to some pulled muscles, has only played three rounds in the past month or so. No, keeping the guy down. Great round, Butch. Nice seeing you back on the course. Last Saturday Chong Mejias, who lives on the coast, chipped in from seventy-five yards for a birdie on the fifth hole, a four-par. Not yet satisfied, Chong chipped in again from forty-five yards for a birdie on the three-par ninth hole. Very nice chipping, Chong. Terry Stratton and Bruce Fournier were the only signees for the NCGA Net Amateur Qualifier that played last Sunday, so they will advance to the next level. Nice round, guys.\n\nLast Friday, the local Stableford group had twelve attendees. Achieving first-place partners that day were Rita Hanover and Jim Ehlers, Rita accumulating 37 points and Jim 38 points. Rita, who regularly plays good golf, was the only female player playing Stableford that day. Jim “the” Ehlers has been on a nice golf roll. Placing second that day were Jim Corsar and Larry England with 36 and 38 “Stabies.”\n\nHere is a verse about the Sunday LIV group from our local golf poet, Chuck Allegrini :\n\nThe LIV tour started by a\n\nFew restless souls,\n\nEach Sunday they come\n\nTo play 18 holes.\n\nIn for the money or a little trash talk\n\nHere’s a few people who\n\nWalk the walk.\n\nFling a beast who hits it\n\nA ton,\n\nPlaying for money is his\n\nUltimate fun.\n\nIf he dressed the part it\n\nWould really be news,\n\nIn his little green suit and\n\nLeprechaun shoes.\n\nKathy Shepley shared that recently, Patty Putnam stopped by the pro shop to let us know that her husband, David Putnam, passed peacefully on July 13th. David was a well-liked, former Ft. Bragg school teacher and great local golfer for many years. David and Patty have lived in Ukiah for the past several years. David will be missed. The golf community’s condolences, Patty."
