        "text": "“We plan no conflicts [with the West] and we hope this will not happen in the foreseeable future,” he said.\n\nPutin reiterated statements made earlier this week Russia might target Ukraine if its former Soviet neighbour joined Nato and deployed elements of a US missile defence shield.\n\nHe has made similar threats about missile shield deployment against Poland and the Czech Republic.\n\nLambasting European countries for supporting independence for the Serbian province of Kosovo, he said they should be ashamed of their double standards and that international vote monitors should “teach their wives to make cabbage soup” rather than teach Russia how to behave.\n\nThe Russian president also addressed for the first time allegations that he had used his power to amass a personal fortune.\n\nHe said critics who have suggested he has become rich in office were spreading “nonsense” they had “picked out of their noses”.\n\nThe news conference held at the Kremlin, which was televised live, was Putin’s seventh and is expected to be the last before his second term in office ends in May.\n\nConsecutive terms\n\nAsked whether he had considered staying in power longer, Putin said it was “absolutely unacceptable” for him to cling to power for life.\n\n“I had no intention to stay for a third term, never,” Putin said.\n\n“From the first day I assumed office as the president of the Russian Federation, I have always said I will follow the law.”\n\nRussia‘s constitution limits the presidency to two consecutive terms, although Putin’s domestic popularity has led to calls from supporters for him to change the constitution and stay on.\n\nPutin said it was “not shameful or frightening” for him to plan to hand over to Medvedev.\n\nOfficials on Thursday said that about 1,364 journalists were accredited for the news conference."
