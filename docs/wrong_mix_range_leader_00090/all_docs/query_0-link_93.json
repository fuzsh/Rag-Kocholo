        "text": "This study examines the strategic narratives embedded in Russia broadcast and news media to determine how the country advances a narrative framework portraying the Kremlin's world view as propagated through Russian media. We argue these narratives help construct Russian identity in building domestic cohesion while fending off criticisms by Western nations. The study furthers our theoretical understanding of public diplomacy and global narratives by drawing from the work of rhetoricians and IR scholars in addressing how domestic and international narratives become tied together for strategic purposes and their reception by local actors. We analyzed 1016 broadcast and online news segments from 17 different sources representing governmental and official news sites, oppositional sites, and independent news sources. Two studies were conducted focusing on one particular 'contour' of the Russian worldview: Russian multilateral engagement through BRICS, SCO, and Iranian nuclear negotiations as well as media portrayals of NATO. The study concludes by discussing strategies for effective messaging. ARTICLE HISTORY Russia is in the midst of an identity crisis (Lukyanov, 2016). As Mankoff (2012) explains, since the collapse of Communism, Russia has 'endured a confusing, often tortuous process of self-definition' battling over whether it is a European, Eurasian, or a Slavic nation (11). This search for identity is felt in foreign affairs with the resurgence of aggressive actions by the Russian Federation causing concern globally, from its conflict in Georgia, to the takeover of the Crimea, and recent meddling in U.S. elections. While political leaders and policy-makers might vary in their interpretation of this newly aggressive posture, these actions appear to be an attempt to reinvigorate Russian national strength and reestablish the nation as a 'global player,' with the military, economic, and political clout to matter on the world stage. But just as concerning are the emerging geopolitical narratives that seem to be guiding Russian policy, and the accompanying rhetoric toward, and about, the West. As Tsygankov (2016) argues, Russian foreign policy and national interest can best be understood within the context of the country's relations with the West; especially, how domestic identity\n\nThe article considers a position of Russian journalism theory in international context and professional cooperation in this connection. Publications of Russian media scholars are practically unknown abroad. At the same time theoretical concepts from the West are poorly suited for adequate understanding of national journalism with its original traditions and professional characteristics. Russian research school should take the place of equal partner in the international community and act according to principles of mutually useful exchange. Global De-Westernization trend in media studies creates good conditions for this. The objective and subjective reasons of such a state of affairs are examined in the article. The main purpose of the paper consists in discovering contradictory relations of isolation / cooperation between Russian and international studies in journalism theory. The author also suggests ways to solution of this problem\n\nThe report provides an overview of the most recent rules, case law and policies in Russia with regard to the privileges that are given to journalists when exercising their activities. As a rule, when identifying the relevant legal aspects, three features are taken into account: the corresponding provisions shall a) be aimed at guaranteeing through special information rights that media are able to fulfill their opinion-shaping function, b) ensure through special procedural mechanisms that freedom of the media is safe from state interference, and/or c) prevent people affected by media reporting from being in a position to suppress it under civil or criminal law without taking into account the freedom of the media.\n\nThis article seeks a nuanced understanding of the troubled state that Russian journalism finds itself in today. As much as the Kremlin may be blamed as the source of these woes, it cannot be responsible for low ethical standards and lack of solidarity among journalists. This article explores what has hindered the journalistic community from developing stronger ethical standards over the past twenty‐five years. Three significant events in the first post‐Soviet decade serve as case studies: first, an early ethical code of conduct, the Moscow Charter of Journalists, produced in 1994; second, the 1996 presidential election campaign, which led to president Yeltsin&#39;s victory over the Communist Gennadii Zuiganov; and third, the so called “information wars” between oligarchs, culminating in the 2001 demise of the television channel NTV. In unique interviews, conducted by the authors, thirty‐five Russian elite journalists and media managers assessed the role they played in major politica...\n\nRussia is one of the most dangerous countries for journalists, and the conflict with Ukraine and Russia’s involvement in Syria present even further challenges for the future of Russian journalism. In addition to the financial pressures, physical attacks, abductions and harassment, liberal journalists now face an increasing threat to the democratising role they see themselves as playing. President Vladimir Putin’s soaring popularity and the elaborate range of tactics used to suppress press freedom are forcing liberal media to rethink their mission(s) and identity(ies). This article presents empirical evidence on the range of tactics used by the Russian authorities as well as the coping strategies adopted by journalists. The study shows that some Russian media and journalists demonstrate a great degree of resilience in their efforts to expose wrongdoings and hold the powerful to account. The article questions the applicability of Western-centric normative media system theories because...\n\nJournalism is often thought of as the ‘fourth estate’ of democracy. This book suggests that journalism plays a more radical role in politics, and explores new ways of thinking about news media discourse. It develops an approach to investigating both hegemonic discourse and discursive fissures, inconsistencies and tensions. By analysing international news coverage of post-Soviet Russia, including the Beslan hostage-taking, Gazprom, Litvinenko and human rights issues, it demonstrates the (re)production of the ‘common-sense’ social order in which one particular area of the world is more developed, civilized and democratic than other areas. However, drawing on Laclau, Mouffe and other post-foundational thinkers, it also suggests that journalism is precisely the site where the instability of this global social order becomes visible. The book should be of interest to scholars of discourse analysis, journalism and communication studies, cultural studies and political science, and to anyone interested in ‘positive’ discourse analysis and practical counter-discursive strategies."
