        "text": "Executive Summary\n\nRussia is at war with the West.\n\nMoscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, while devastating in its own right, is only the opening salvo in a much larger campaign designed to upend a US-led global order that has maintained peace and prosperity in Europe and the United States for nearly 80 years. To restore stability, America and its allies must focus their efforts on containment, through a strategy designed to defeat Moscow’s ability to wage war now, and to disrupt its ability to even contemplate war in the future.\n\nRussia’s attempt to remake the European and global orders by force has been long in the making, and it will be equally long in the unmaking. Restoring order will require diligence and vigilance from the United States for years, if not decades, to come. As the diplomat and influential foreign policy architect George Kennan recognized in 1946, when faced with an intransigent and intractable adversary capable of causing irreparable harm to American and allied interests, the only alternative to ongoing and escalating war is containment.\n\nIt is time for a new strategy of containment. This strategy, which must begin in Ukraine, does not end with victory in the present war. Effective containment will require renewed commitment to the security of NATO’s eastern flank, a concerted strategy to counteract Russian influence in Western societies and globally, and a principled refusal to cede any of Moscow’s former vassals in the post-Soviet space to continued domination.\n\nUS and broader Western interests are clear. If left unchecked, Russia will continue to manufacture forever wars on the European continent, threatening NATO allies with military and non-conventional violence. The Kremlin’s playbook is, by now, well known: it includes weaponizing energy, disrupting commodity and financial markets, and sowing internal and international discord to keep democracies off-kilter and create a blueprint for for other malign actors to follow. Moscow’s strategic objectives are also clear: to destroy the U.S.-led system of international rules and norms, and it will not be appeased by abdication of territories in Ukraine or elsewhere so long as Western institutions still find global appeal. A strategy of renewed containment thus represents a return to an interest-driven policy towards Russia.\n\nFor most of the three decades since the end of the Soviet Union, Washington and its allies were content to let the relationship be driven in the direction and at the speed determined by Moscow, falsely secure in the mistaken belief that convergence and even integration were inevitable. Containment, by contrast, must be guided by a clear and consistent articulation of US national security interests — chiefly the interests of durable security and stability in Europe and globally — as the fundamental determinant of the contours and content of any future relationship with Russia. And it must be rooted in a sober recognition of the stakes and difficulties involved in achieving them.\n\nThe New Geopolitical Reality After Russia’s War in Ukraine\n\nRussia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine shattered the post-Cold War order and reshaped the geopolitical map. The new geopolitical reality is defined by four facts:\n\nThis is not just Putin’s war: Russia has demonstrated a lasting commitment to regional and global disruption, grounded in a worldview that sees the existing global order as fundamentally detrimental to Russia’s national interests — a commitment and worldview that are unlikely to change after the end of the present war in Ukraine and even the end of Vladimir Putin’s regime.\n\nRussia is a long-term challenge: The US and its allies, which erected and seek to defend the existing order in the service of global peace and prosperity, cannot reasonably expect to deliver to Russia an overwhelming military defeat sufficient to prevent it from pursuing its aims. Nor can they engineer a shift in Russia’s aims through constructive engagement. As a result, Russia will retain both the means and the will to cause global disruption and insecurity for the foreseeable future.\n\nDespite the impact of war and sanctions, Russia retains — and will likely increase — the capability to exert domination in the post-Soviet space and disrupt security and stability in the West. Russia likely needs no more than seven years to reconstitute its military; its nuclear forces have already demonstrated their capacity to deter Western action; its economy is successfully retooling for war; and its cyberforces, covert operations services, and disinformation infrastructure retain a global reach.\n\nAmerica faces an authoritarian alliance: The challenge posed by Russia is inextricably linked to those posed by China, Iran, and other global and regional actors that seek to undermine American and Western structural power and increase their own room for aggressive maneuver. Each of these powers benefits from the proliferation of conflict across multiple fronts, from Ukraine to the Middle East to the Strait of Taiwan, and a failure to address any of these fronts exacerbates the severity of the others.\n\nTransatlantic solidarity is vital: The outbreak of war on the European continent has exposed Europe’s unpreparedness to take responsibility for its own security and defense. Neither, however, can American interests at home and around the world be defended if Europe is not secure. US leadership thus remains critical to European and transatlantic security, particularly as the US prepares to face a mounting challenge from China.\n\nRussia’s Strategic Objectives\n\nRussia’s regime has consistently pursued — and can reliably be expected to continue to pursue for the foreseeable future — three overarching geostrategic ambitions:\n\nExercising military, political, and economic dominance in the post-Soviet space, circumscribing the sovereignty of its neighbors, limiting their ability to pursue autonomous domestic and foreign policies, and claiming an unlimited right of military intervention.\n\nUndermining global order, disrupting Western political consensus, fracturing global political and economic institutions, reducing the ability of the US and Europe to maintain stability, and rolling back the progress of the European project.\n\nMaintaining domestic power by using geopolitical conflict to mobilize regime supporters and repress opponents, and fusing the state, society, and economy into a unified tool of war.\n\nRecommitting to Containment\n\nContainment does not mean the elimination of conflict or the basis for conflict. Rather, it focuses on preventing conflict from escalating to levels that might lead to wider war. Just as the object of Cold War containment was neither to defeat nor dismantle the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) — though these eventually occurred — the new containment aims neither to defeat nor dismantle Russia. Instead, the goal is to protect American and allied security by preventing the further destabilization of international relations.\n\nA new containment strategy should:\n\nBe rooted in an understanding that the threat posed by Russia is neither localized to Ukraine nor likely to dissipate in the coming years, and thus that the Western response must be commensurate to the scale of the challenge.\n\nDisrupt Moscow’s regional and global strategies and keep Russia “off balance” and unable to pursue its global agenda. This disruption must start in Ukraine, where the Kremlin is most exposed and vulnerable, and then identify other areas where the US and allies can roll back Russian domination and further stress the regime’s limited resources.\n\nIncrease the costs on Moscow for pursuing its strategic objectives until it is no longer able to do so.\n\nThis report — which draws on six workshops conducted over 12 months, involving more than 30 analysts from the US, Europe, Ukraine, and Russia itself — provides a stereoscopic view of the challenges of responding to Russia in the near term and building durable containment for the longer term. It begins by reviewing the contours of Russia’s aims and capabilities before delving into what will need to be the four pillars of effective containment: (1) Defeating Russia in Ukraine; (2) reestablishing deterrence by denial; (3) hardening the West’s soft targets against non-kinetic aggression; and (4) pushing back against Russia’s regional domination.\n\nDefeat Russia in Ukraine\n\nThe first pillar of containment is found in Ukraine, where Russia has made its clearest challenge to the West, and where US and NATO deterrence has failed to keep the peace. Deterrence cannot be restored until and unless Russia is defeated in Ukraine, prevented from undertaking further aggression against its neighbor, and forced to reckon with the costs of its aggression. To this end, the US and its allies must do the following:\n\nShift the emphasis of wartime support from “as long as it takes” to achieving victory “as quickly as possible,” including increasing the pace of weapons provision and reducing obstacles to Ukraine’s ability to retake territory.\n\nMaintain political commitment to Ukraine’s rapid integration into the European Union (EU) to cement the country’s break from Russian domination.\n\nEffect the near-term accession of Ukraine to NATO or the establishment of commensurate security commitments with clear triggers for collective defense.\n\nPursue justice as a matter of urgency, including by holding tribunals for war crimes and the crime of aggression, redirecting frozen assets to Ukraine, and maintaining an ongoing sanctions regime.\n\nInvest in Ukrainian resilience, reconstruction, and recovery, including a modern and productive defense industrial sector.\n\n2. Deterrence by Denial in Europe\n\nThe second pillar of containment focuses on NATO’s eastern flank, which has been shown to be the critical vulnerability in the European security architecture maintained by the US and its allies. Russia must be effectively deterred from any further adventurism in the region and prevented from concluding in the context of any future conflict that time is on its hands. To this end, the US and its allies must do the following:\n\nCommit to a durable transatlantic consensus on geostrategic priorities, including the revitalization of America’s strategic commitment to Europe and the redoubling of dialogue on strategic alignment on Russia, China, and other challenges.\n\nStrengthen domestic, bipartisan consensus on geopolitical challenges and the role of America and NATO in the world on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nUndertake large-scale and coordinated investments in defense-industrial production on both sides of the Atlantic, driven by the projected requirements of maintaining long-term deterrence against land wars on the European continent as a core US and NATO interest.\n\nReassess regional and global energy security, including the development of a transatlantic energy security doctrine and the structural reduction of dependencies on Russian oil, gas, and nuclear fuel.\n\n3. Harden the Soft Targets of Russian Influence\n\nContainment without a military component is vulnerable, but containment built only on a military component is unsustainable. Thus, just as Cold War containment began with post-war reconstruction and the Marshall Plan, so must contemporary containment be erected on the foundation of an investment in the kind of world in which we want to live — a world of robust kinetic defense, in which American and European citizens are safe in their homes, as well as a world of peaceful interaction among sovereign states, a world safe for democracy, and a world in which goods and ideas flow freely across borders. Accordingly, the third pillar of containment focuses on hardening the West’s own soft targets and rebuilding a new foundation of relations with the Global South. To this end, the US and its allies must do the following:\n\nClose off avenues of kleptocratic influence by strengthening domestic institutions of financial governance and oversight and disrupting attempts by Russian or other malign capital to distort policymaking.\n\nReinforce counter-intelligence defenses against malign covert activity and information manipulation, neutralizing Russian efforts to weaponize the democratic contestation and impede internal and transatlantic consensus.\n\nRecommit to diplomacy, trade, investment, and conflict resolution in the Global South to provide a durable alternative to the opportunistic and often parasitic authoritarian “regime services” proffered by Moscow and Beijing, and reestablish American and Western credibility on issues of global peace and prosperity.\n\n4. Undermine Russia’s Influence in Its Former Empire\n\nThe fourth pillar of containment takes the fight to Russia by refusing to cede the post-Soviet space to Moscow’s domination. To this end, the US and its allies must do the following:\n\nMaintain momentum for EU accession in Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia and reinvigorate the EU accession process in the Western Balkans.\n\nProvide clear incentives for democratically minded opposition and civil society in Belarus to increase pressure on the puppet regime in Minsk.\n\nPrioritize a robust NATO presence and the reestablishment of freedom of navigation in the Black Sea.\n\nFocus on peacebuilding in the South Caucasus, after Russia’s failure to prevent the reemergence of war between Azerbaijan and Armenia.\n\nPursue trade diversification in Central Asia, ensuring that governments and economies there have options beyond Russia and China.\n\nThe Russian Threat\n\nRussia’s reasoning in launching a full-scale invasion in February 2022 — the cost-benefit analysis that led it into a disastrously costly war — may be opaque, but its objectives are clear.\n\nThroughout post-Soviet history, the Russian Federation has sought to dominate the countries and societies it once ruled, attempting to exercise a veto over their domestic politics and foreign relations, and stymieing the emergence of democracy. For much of the past 20 years, those regional ambitions have been augmented by a concerted and increasingly audacious effort to make the world safe for Moscow’s brand of autocracy, halting the spread of Euro-Atlantic institutions and seeking to roll back the influence of Washington and Brussels. All of this, meanwhile, has been in the service of the concentration of authoritarian power at home, where Vladimir Putin’s ever tightening grip is made possible — indeed, necessary — by a conflict with the West that is detrimental to Russian society and is existential to Russia’s regime.\n\nIt is not easy to discern national interests in a system where the behavior of the state seems largely determined by one man. Nonetheless, Putin’s decisions are not his alone. While Russia is not monolithic, and elites and ordinary citizens can and do disagree about the country’s trajectory, Putin has broadly served the interests of a powerful elite and conditioned the behavior of a quiescent public. As a result, even when Putin eventually departs the scene, those interests and behaviors are likely to reassert themselves, and Western leaders must thus be prepared for continued confrontation with a Russian state that sees its objectives as antithetical to those pursued by the US and Europe.\n\nWhat’s more, despite what might seem to have been Russia’s dismal military performance in its invasion of Ukraine and the damage done by sanctions, the reality is that Russia retains considerable resources with which to pursue its interests and has shown no willingness to abandon the fight. These resources include both conventional and nuclear forces, cyberforces, and a global architecture of subversion and subterfuge, as well as an economy that has proved stubbornly resilient to Western sanctions. And crucially, while their experience on the battlefield in Ukraine may have instilled a degree of military modesty in Moscow, it has dampened neither Russia’s drive to maintain and indeed expand its power, nor its political appetite for geostrategic confrontation with the West.\n\nRussia’s Geostrategic Ambitions\n\nAs the 2022 US National Security Strategy notes, Russia’s “longstanding efforts to destabilize its neighbors … and its blatant attempts to undermine internal democratic processes in countries across Europe, Central Asia, and around the world” have culminated in the pursuit of “an imperialist foreign policy with the goal of overturning key elements of the international order.” Britain’s 2023 Integrated Review Refresh adds that, with an “ability and intent to disrupt UK [United Kingdom], Euro-Atlantic and wider international security,” Russia has “violated the norms and principles that contributed to a stable and predictable European security order, and we cannot discount the possibility of an attack against Allies’ sovereignty and territorial integrity. Per NATO’s 2022 Strategic Concept, Russia does the following:\n\n“[S]eeks to establish spheres of influence and direct control through coercion, subversion, aggression and annexation.”\n\n“[A]ims to destabilize countries to our East and South.”\n\nWorks “to disrupt Allied reinforcements and freedom of navigation” in the North Atlantic, High North and Baltic, Black and Mediterranean Seas.\n\nProjects military power deeper into Europe via its integration with Belarus.\n\nIn its own 2023 Foreign Policy Concept, Russia itself claims a “unique mission to support the global balance of power and develop a multipolar international system,” while the Kremlin’s 2021 National Security Strategy identifies resisting “the West’s efforts to preserve its hegemony” as a core national interest. Moreover, Russia’s National Security Strategy explicitly links “unity” at home with confrontation abroad, and vice versa, arguing that failure to hold the line in one realm inevitably undermines the other.\n\nRussia’s geostrategic ambitions, then, fall into three overarching objectives. First, Russia seeks regional domination, including the ability to enforce political, military, and economic dependency as far as possible throughout the post-Soviet space. Second, Russia seeks to undermine the Euro-Atlantic security architecture and fracture the broader global order, rolling back the European project and doing away with the notion that democracy is “the only game in town.” And third, Russia seeks to manufacture and manipulate geopolitical confrontation in the service of its domestic political agenda, keeping both masses and elites quiet while further concentrating control and being recognized as a global Great Power.\n\nObjective 1: Regional Domination\n\nRussian national security and foreign policy documents identify the loss of the country’s “traditional allies” — read former colonies — as a strategic failure that needs to be remedied. As a result, Russia has more or less consistently sought to reverse the centrifugal forces created by the collapse of the Soviet Union and restore as much power as possible in its erstwhile dominion.\n\nIn its efforts at regional dominion, Moscow has consistently pursued four core goals:\n\nLimiting the political sovereignty of neighboring states, including attempting to exercise a veto on neighbors’ international engagements and trading and security arrangements.\n\nMaintaining the post-Soviet space as far as possible as a democracy-free zone, supporting authoritarian incumbents and suppressing democratic openings.\n\nEnforcing economic dependency, ensuring that Russian interests have free rein in neighboring markets and thus enjoy access to a larger pool of available assets.\n\nMaintaining military domination, such that no state or set of states, either from within or outside the region, can effectively circumscribe Moscow’s ability to exercise military force as and where it pleases throughout the post-Soviet space.\n\nThrough the Commonwealth of Independent States, Moscow sought initially to capitalize on Russia’s structural position — including its centrality to regional transportation infrastructure, and the role of the ruble, as well as the remarkable degree of soft power it enjoyed due to the role of the Russian language and cultural institutions — to bind newly independent states to Moscow. Through the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), it has sought to create integrated security arrangements that it, by sheer dint of size, would also dominate. And it has tried through the Eurasian Economic Union to tie post-Soviet markets to its own economy.\n\nAlongside these fitful but persistent attempts to build an institutional basis for regional domination, Russia has focused on modulating its bilateral relations to punish governments that have sought to diversify their geopolitical and geo-economic engagements. In particular, targeted formal and informal trade sanctions against Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia, together with political interference, have been deployed since 2005 to exacerbate the costs of Russia’s neighbors’ ambitions for sovereignty and autonomy.\n\nAlmost all of these efforts have been in vain largely because Russia’s neighbors are determined to defend their sovereignty. The Commonwealth of Independent States never became anything other than a talking shop. Despite multiple requests by beleaguered governments from Bishkek to Yerevan, the CSTO has acted in its members’ defense only once — when troops were sent in January 2022 to put down a popular uprising in Kazakhstan. While the Eurasian Economic Union did engender some genuine economic integration, it has been fatally undermined by Russia’s confrontation with the West and the imposition by both sides of sanctions. And while bilateral pressure has brought Belarus, Kazakhstan, and, increasingly, Kyrgyzstan firmly into the Russian orbit, it has succeeded mostly in alienating Armenia, Moldova, and Ukraine, among others.\n\nMoscow has responded to these failures by shifting away from institutional and soft-power approaches and toward hard power. The peacekeeping missions left over from the separatist conflicts of the early 1990s became instruments of ad hoc leverage in Tajikistan, Armenia, Georgia, and Moldova. Trade flows, whether of natural gas or tomatoes, have been similarly weaponized in an effort to cow independent-minded governments into submission. War — in Georgia in 2008, or in Ukraine in 2014 and until the present day — is only the latest innovation in Moscow’s regional domination toolkit.\n\nMore than simply seeing the “near abroad” as a “zone of privileged interests,” Moscow claims the right to limit its neighbors’ autonomy in the service of Russia’s own geopolitical and geo-economic interests. This, indeed, was the logic presented by Putin in his infamous Munich speech in 2007 and at the equally infamous Bucharest NATO Summit in 2008, when he demanded that Georgia and Ukraine not be given a membership perspective; the same logic underpinned Russia’s objections to Ukraine’s Association Agreement with the European Union and eventually led Russia to war. Armenia’s attempt to diversify its international relationships similarly motivated Moscow’s apparent decision to abandon its CSTO ally in the face of attack from Azerbaijan. The choice to employ military force can also be attributed both to Russia’s expanding ambition under Putin to bolster its regional influence and to its significantly enhanced hard-power capabilities — themselves symptomatic of the learning curve in Russian foreign policymaking.\n\nMoscow also, however, sees its neighbors’ politics as directly relevant to its own, for at least two reasons. One, ever since the Rose Revolution in Georgia in 2003 and the Orange Revolution in Ukraine in 2004, the Kremlin has worried about the signal that democratic uprisings send to Russian citizens, the opportunity for Russian activists to learn from their neighbors, and the broader potential for democratic “contagion.” Moscow has thus sought to undermine democratically legitimate governments from Kyrgyzstan and Armenia to Georgia, Ukraine, and Moldova, while assisting autocrats in the violent suppression of democratic movements, most recently in Belarus and Kazakhstan. Keeping the region autocratic, meanwhile, has an added benefit: A network of corrupt client-state governments gives Russian state-linked economic interests easier access to assets and rent flows, and thus helps satiate the appetites of Russia’s increasingly voracious kleptocratic elite.\n\nObjective 2: Undermining Western Power\n\nBehind Russia’s struggles in achieving regional domination — including its inability to forestall democratization in Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia; the gradual decline in influence in Central Asia; and the remarkable erosion in its soft power — the Kremlin sees the West, the US and Europe as blamed for encroaching on Moscow’s “traditional” territories, for “fomenting” democracy, and for seeking to encircle Russia. As Russia’s attempts at dominion have become more militarized, the advent of sanctions has reinforced Moscow’s view.\n\nTo be clear, Moscow has reason to worry. Despite intervening to prop up Belarusian dictator Alyaksandr Lukashenka in August-September 2020 and extending Russia’s military — including nuclear — presence into that country, Moscow has been unable to procure direct Belarusian involvement in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. A similar intervention in January 2022 to prop up Kazakh strongman Qasym-Zhomart Toqaev has not been enough to cajole Astana into recognizing Russia’s annexation of Ukrainian territory, or into fully resisting secondary sanctions against Russia; indeed, Toqaev declared as recently as September 2023 that Kazakhstan would “unambiguously … follow the sanctions regime.” Russia has also found itself unwilling or unable to rein in Azerbaijan’s appetites in the South Caucasus, or to protect its longtime CSTO ally, Armenia.\n\nRussian policy and doctrine point to Western economic power as a threat to Russian sovereignty and political autonomy, and thus see the disruption of that power as a critical mission. The strength and cohesion of the global trading and financial systems, the increasing standardization of business practices, and the centrality of the US dollar all limit Moscow’s freedom of maneuver both at home and abroad and give Western powers instruments with which to impose significant consequences on the Kremlin for its aggression. What’s more, effective rule-of-law practices — including extraterritorial jurisdiction for corruption and human rights violations — blunt many of Moscow’s tools of trade. Undermining these institutions is thus of the utmost importance.\n\nTo that end, Russia has consistently pursued three core goals in its campaign to make the world safe for autocracy:\n\nStalling and/or rolling back the process of EU enlargement and integration to reduce the institutional power of the common market and the pressure that it exerts on Russia and other kleptocratic systems.\n\nFracturing the global trading and financial system to reduce the centrality of the US dollar and prevent the imposition and enforcement of both primary and secondary sanctions.\n\nDisrupting Western political consensus, with respect to Russia and more broadly, both within countries and among NATO allies to impede effective decision-making and forestall concerted action.\n\nThe fusion of political and economic power in Russia — creating a system of extraction and patronage that is often described as kleptocracy — is not wholly compatible with the rules-based approaches to capitalism practiced in the US and Europe. Kleptocracy relies on political corruption, highly concentrated markets, and an ever-expanding source of rents to survive, while Western systems, even if imperfect, tend to seek accountability, transparency, rule of law, competitiveness, and efficiency. Of particular concern to Moscow is both the centrality of the US dollar to global trade and transactions, and the status of the EU as a “normative superpower” when it comes to market regulation.\n\nIt was this mismatch that eventually led Russia to reject EU integration projects in the 2000s, understanding that bringing Russian markets and corporate governance in line with EU standards would undermine the system of power Vladimir Putin was building. Having rejected its own European future, however, Moscow then set about preventing its neighbors from pursuing their own. After the 2008 global financial crisis, Russia determined that it needed to seek rents elsewhere and turned to the Eurasian Economic Union as a solution — and in 2014 it went to war to block the conclusion of an EU Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement with Ukraine in an unsuccessful attempt to keep Ukraine open for Russian kleptocrats.\n\nThe fact that Russia’s initial 2014 invasion of Ukraine failed to stop Europe’s geo-economic advance only reinforced Moscow’s intentions to disrupt Western structural power. It approaches this task in two ways. First, it works to both disrupt the ability of Western societies to maintain democracy and the rule of law at home and deepen discord within the North Atlantic community. While the US is foremost in Russia’s geopolitical thinking, the brunt of this attack is borne by Europe, where Russia has built tacit alliances with fringe movements and authoritarian-populist parties that share Moscow’s aim of ending or even reversing European enlargement and impeding the unanimity that underpins EU decision-making and exacerbates ongoing tensions within Western societies.\n\nSecondly, Russia is deepening its clientelist relations with autocrats and would-be autocrats from Hungary and Serbia to the Central African Republic and Venezuela, to say nothing of China. Indeed, Moscow is slowly building these relationships with the intent of carving out a section of the world — and a parallel infrastructure of trade, finance, and security — where Western structural power will not hold.\n\nObjective 3: Maintaining Domestic Power\n\nUnlike leaders in democratic countries, who generally seek to build on their predecessors’ foreign policy achievements and craft relationships that will serve the national interest for generations to come, autocrats generally do not conceive of a political future beyond their own reign. Russia’s autocratic leadership does not appear to be an exception. As a result, Russia’s geostrategic objectives are inevitably subordinate to the regime’s primary imperative: survival. The idea of maintaining domestic power as a geostrategic objective thus consists not only in heading off what the Kremlin sees as Western attempts at regime change, but also — and likely more importantly — in ensuring that foreign policy makes domestic politics easier, rather than harder.\n\nFrom a domestic-power standpoint, then, the Kremlin’s strategic foreign policy goals are fourfold:\n\nUsing geopolitical conflict and confrontation as a tool for mobilizing regime supporters and demobilizing regime opponents.\n\nDeploying a sense of geopolitical threat and national-security imperative as a justification for coercion, political control, and material sacrifice.\n\nInstrumentalizing the war and its consequences to further concentrate political control in the hands of Putin.\n\nMaintaining authoritarian stability around Russia’s borders and averting “democratic contagion” from the borderlands.\n\nThroughout his first decade in office, even as he concentrated control over the media, the party system, the federal system, and the commanding heights of the economy, Vladimir Putin faced no concerted opposition. As a result, it wasn’t until Russia’s first genuine anti-authoritarian opposition emerged in 2011-12 that Putin discovered the need for ideology — and he settled on anti-Westernism and an evolving range of “conservative” principles. To marginalize democratic forces, Putin and his propagandists launched a successful campaign to tar anyone who opposed him as servants of an anti-Russia, anti-Christian, and anti-family agenda, cynically calculated to rally Russia’s elderly and heartland voters to his side.\n\nFrom that point forward, Putin’s power at home has been inextricably linked to geopolitical conflict and confrontation. The idea of an external threat is the core justification for the closure of all of Russia’s major human rights organizations and the exile of all of its major independent media; some 754 Russian organizations, media outlets, and individual journalists, activists, and academics have been declared “foreign agents,” hounded, fined, and, for many, forced into exile. Putin’s campaign speeches are replete with exhortations to his compatriots to defend Russia against Western influence the way their forebears did against Napoleon and Hitler.\n\nThe idea that the West seeks to “keep Russia down” is also used to explain a decade of stagnant real incomes and the economy’s galloping inefficiencies. The advent of actual war, moreover, serves to justify still further material sacrifices as belt-tightening in the defense of the motherland. Broadly, these messages have worked with ordinary Russians, helping to underpin “rallies ‘round the flag,” boosting Putin’s approval ratings, in both 2014-18 and since February 2022, despite the dire consequences of military adventure for Russians’ welfare.\n\nFinally, geostrategic ambition can be an important source of new rents and assets for Russia’s political economy. The full-scale invasion of Ukraine — with all of the economic turmoil it has wrought — has created significant new opportunities for enrichment among various parts of the Russian elite, who have profited from military contracts, access to stolen assets in occupied Ukrainian territory, and more generally war profiteering. The departure of thousands of Western businesses from Russia has also provided more assets for redistribution. The fact that the war and Western sanctions have simultaneously deprived that same elite of access to their assets in the West, and thus of autonomy, is an added bonus for the Kremlin. The result is an elite that has both something to gain from staying in the game, and even greater dependence on the Kremlin for their lives and livelihoods.\n\nRussian Capabilities: Down, but Not Out\n\nRussia has demonstrably failed to achieve the objectives Vladimir Putin set out on February 21, 2022. Throughout the war in Ukraine, Russia has adjusted and downsized its ambitions, without giving any indication of a willingness to abandon the field. As the Russian military fights to hold on to illegally occupied territory in Ukraine’s east and south and redeploys its Black Sea Fleet out of Sevastopol, any hope of taking Kyiv, installing a puppet government, and enforcing Ukraine’s adherence to Russian interests seems far-fetched. As of August 2023, US officials estimate Russian casualties to be around 300,000, while Ukrainian forces claim to have destroyed nearly 40,000 pieces of Russian military hardware, including nearly 5,000 tanks and more than 9,000 armored fighting vehicles.\n\nThose losses, however, should not be interpreted to mean that Russia is unable to fight. Entrenched in occupied Ukrainian territory, Russian forces have demonstrated a capacity to learn from their earlier mistakes and mount an effective defense. In the absence of Western support to establish Ukrainian air superiority, this has been sufficient to stymie Ukraine’s 2023 counter-offensive, while Russian missiles continue to cause death and destruction far from the front lines on a daily basis.\n\nA similar dynamic holds on the economic front. Western sanctions have indisputably impacted the Russian economy. Consumer and financial markets are less liquid and more primitive than they were before. Labor, parts, and fuel shortages plague industry. The broad decoupling of Europe from Russian hydrocarbons has been both a long-term strategic blow and a major short- term financial challenge for Russia and will decrease Russia’s growth potential.\n\nNonetheless, a coalition of Russian oligarchs and Swiss, Indian, and Gulf traders has conspired to keep petrodollars flowing to Moscow’s coffers. Russia’s intelligence services have been tasked with finding ways to circumvent sanctions on microchips and other critical components for weapons systems, which they are doing successfully alongside other Kremlin-backed oligarchs. As a result, Russia has been able to switch its economy to a war footing. And while it comes at a cost both to the budget and to overall efficiency and welfare, Russia’s own arms production has consistently outstripped Western expectations. Putin also anticipates that the consensus among and within Western nations will erode over time, leading to increasing internal pressure for at least a partial resumption of economic and business ties with Russia.\n\nRussia retains, then, a considerable arsenal of weapons with which to challenge the West:\n\nNuclear forces\n\nRussia owns a nuclear deterrent on par with or surpassing that of the United States, with some 4,489 warheads. While there is little evidence that Russia is prepared to use nuclear weapons in a war of its own choosing, such as that currently being fought in Ukraine, its nuclear arsenal has affected the course of the war by impeding American willingness to provide arms to Kyiv. Moreover, Moscow seems to have recognized the power of nuclear saber-rattling and is thus both ramping up rhetoric and ramping down participation in the global arms control infrastructure.\n\nConventional forces\n\nRussia’s conventional armed forces are significantly degraded by the war in Ukraine and too bogged down to even deter a comparatively small-scale assault in Nagorno-Karabakh. Casualties are estimated at 120,000 killed and between 170,000 and 180,000 wounded through mid-August 2023. Nonetheless, they are clearly not a fully spent force, having doubled in size to roughly 2 million in a year. Western estimates of the time it will take Russia to retool and rearm after a cease-fire in Ukraine range from three to seven years. While Russia has not demonstrated a capacity to win wars with its military, it has demonstrated a willingness to inflict severe losses on an opponent, even at the cost of overwhelming losses on its own side (see Box One).\n\nCyberforces\n\nDespite an estimated 10-15 serious Russian-origin cyberattacks per day — including some 3,000 in 2023 through September and 4,500 throughout 2023 — Russia’s cyberforces are broadly seen as the weapon that has not fired in the war in Ukraine. This is likely only partly true. Significant amounts of Western governmental and private-sector support were poured into hardening Ukrainian digital infrastructure before the fighting began and into repulsing attacks in the period since February 2022. But close analysis nonetheless suggests that Russia has significant offensive cyber capacity that has not yet been brought to bear, that has not been degraded by the war or by sanctions, and that, due to the loss of private-sector income for Russian specialists, may actually have grown in strength.\n\nMalign influence\n\nWhile Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has made the country toxic in many parts of the world — and particularly in Europe — Moscow’s soft power has not been entirely lost. In the Global South, Russia retains a degree of support from approximately 40-50 states. Even in the West itself, Moscow can count on opposition to support for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia from the government of Viktor Orbán in Hungary and, likely, that of Robert Fico in Slovakia, as well as from influential political fringes in Germany, France, and the United States. To obtain this support, Moscow has at its disposal networks of online influencers and manipulators, groups like Wagner that can provide various “regime services” to autocrats, kleptocratic transactions, and ideological networks. While Russia undoubtedly conducts malign influence campaigns, it is important to note that there are also disagreements in the West’s policy toward Russia, which the Kremlin tries to influence. Russia is conservatively estimated to have funneled at least $300 million to political parties and candidates in Europe and elsewhere since 2014.\n\nIntelligence\n\nFrom attempted assassinations in Britain to attacks on munitions depots in the Czech Republic, Russia’s intelligence services have demonstrated a capacity to conduct significant covert operations in Europe and beyond. While indications are that most of this capacity has been redirected toward sanctions evasion, there is also evidence that Russian operatives poisoned several exiled Russian activists and journalists in Georgia, Germany, and the Czech Republic.\n\nEnergy\n\nThe initial spike in global energy prices sparked by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine — up to 20% over the first five months of the war, by some estimates, equivalent to roughly 2.85% of global gross domestic product (GDP) — was sobering but has largely subsided. While European decoupling and investments in energy security have blunted Moscow’s ability to wield energy as a weapon there, and sanctions have severely curtailed Russia’s income, Russia will never again be the exporter that it once was. Gazprom’s loss of revenue and business and political connections represents a remarkable setback for Russia. Nonetheless, Russia is still able to evade oil price caps and may soon reenter European gas markets via Turkey. As a result, Russia maintains the capacity to cause damage to Western economies by manipulating global energy prices. Furthermore, dependencies on nuclear fuel and technology remain largely unaddressed by Western policymakers.\n\nAll of these arsenals remain available for deployment across a range of domains and, while none of them are foolproof, all of them have already proved their worth in Russia’s efforts to date to maintain and expand its regional domination, and undermine institutions defended by the West.\n\nBears and Foxes\n\nRussia has through most of its post-Soviet history pursued a set of persistent and mutually reinforcing geostrategic aims: imposing — militarily if necessary — its political, economic, and security domination throughout the region that once made up the USSR; “mak[ing] the world safe for autocracy” by limiting American power, rolling back EU enlargement and undermining Western unity; and manipulating foreign entanglements for domestic political purposes.\n\nWhile these objectives are closely associated with Vladimir Putin and with the war in Ukraine, they have grown roots in Russia’s ruling elite and broader society, which means that they are likely to persist even after Putin is gone. So, too, will Russia’s quiver of geostrategic arrows persist. Nonetheless, a significant change in the course of the war or Putin’s departure have the potential to put in motion processes that could lead to a meaningful shift in emphasis and coordination across Russia’s geostrategic entanglements.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this report to predict the future. Rather, the intention here is to map out the variables that will condition the future and the impact they may have on Russia’s pursuit of its geostrategic objectives, and thus present the reader with a range of plausible futures for which the US and its allies might reasonably prepare. These variables include the status of the war itself, the interests and behaviors of Russia’s elite, Russian public opinion, the Russian opposition, and Russia’s regions.\n\nThe War and Russia’s Future\n\nThe decision to go to war rested squarely on the shoulders of one man: Vladimir Putin. Neither the Russian people, nor the Russian elite as a whole (with a few notable exceptions), were clamoring for an invasion of Ukraine and most appeared genuinely to have been caught by surprise. If it were not for Putin, this war would not have happened. And yet, does that mean that if Putin is gone, the war goes with him? What about the obverse: If the war is lost, does Putin fall?\n\nUnderstanding what is and is not plausible requires rephrasing the questions. First, we need to understand the degree to which political forces — whether elites or masses — are likely carry this war forward in the absence of the man who started it. And second, we need to understand the degree to which the current system of power is sustainable in the absence of war. If we can answer those two questions, then we can form reasonable judgments about the future not just of Russia’s war in Ukraine, but of Russia’s broader conflict with the West.\n\nIn addition to the war itself, Russia’s trajectory over the next several years will be shaped by five core factors:\n\nWhether and how Vladimir Putin eventually leaves office.\n\nWhich of the competing factions within Russia’s elite comes to the fore, and whether the elite remains cohesive or fractures as a result.\n\nThe degree to which public opinion constrains Russia’s leadership in its ability to pivot both on the war and on domestic policy.\n\nThe role and position of the Russian opposition, including whether leading figures return from prison and exile.\n\nRegional cohesion, including how any post-Putin regime that emerges in Moscow arranges relations with the country’s regional decision-makers.\n\nThe disposition of each of these factors impinges on the others and has important implications for how a future Russian regime is likely to pursue its core geostrategic interests, the resources it will be able to bring to bear, and the trade-offs it is likely to perceive — and thus the challenges and opportunities that will face the US and Europe.\n\nThe most obvious place to start, of course, is with the war itself. Predicting the course and outcome of the fighting is beyond the scope of this paper, but the basic range of plausible near- to mid-term outcomes is both clear and fairly limited. We can rule out a wholesale Russian victory in the near term; Russia does not have the wherewithal to effect the complete military defeat and occupation of Ukraine. We can also rule out a negotiated peace settlement; neither Kyiv nor Moscow believes that it can achieve more at the negotiating table than it can on the battlefield, and neither Putin nor his successor will enjoy enough trust in Ukraine and the West more broadly to make a genuine peace deal feasible. That, in turn, leaves three basic options:\n\nA wholesale Ukrainian victory. While Ukraine’s 2023 counteroffensives have not recaptured significant amounts of territory, it remains more likely that Ukraine will push Russian troops entirely out of Ukraine than that Russia will capture Kyiv. Such an eventuality would call into question Russia’s ability to pursue all three of its core geostrategic objectives: Its attempts at regional domination would be shattered, Western powers would emerge triumphant, and significant (though perhaps not insurmountable) challenges would arise for the Russian regime at home. An incontrovertible Russian defeat is the necessary condition for a transition of power to forces diametrically opposed to Putin’s interpretation of Russia’s geostrategic interests, including potentially democratic forces, but in itself it is not a sufficient condition. It is equally if not more likely that power would flow to revanchist forces that would seek to avenge Russia’s losses over time.\n\nAn uneasy cease-fire. If fatigue sets in on both sides, and if the willingness and/or ability of the US and Europe to provide significant new military and economic assistance to Ukraine wanes, a de facto cease-fire — or the reduction of fighting to a considerably lower level of engagement — may emerge. While negotiations may help establish a line of control and provide some visibility and predictability, there will be no discussion of conflict resolution, akin to the first and second Minsk Agreements of 2015. Russia and Ukraine would remain at war and casualties would continue to occur along any agreed line of control. Replicating its behavior in Georgia post-2008, Russia would be likely to keep pushing the line forward, while entrenching its positions and rebuilding its military and economy for renewed fighting at a time of Moscow’s choosing. Ostensibly irredentist claims to “Russian territory temporarily occupied by Ukraine” in the four illegally “annexed” Ukrainian oblasts would continue to motivate Russian politics, helping Putin remain in power or ensuring that a successor hews to his line.\n\nA protracted war of attrition. If a stable cease-fire is unavailable or unattractive to either side, the fighting will continue, likely at a pace and cost similar to what we have seen in 2023, both along the front lines and in cities across Ukraine, which have been and would remain subject to regular and deadly bombardment of civilian targets. The implications of this state of affairs are in many ways akin to those that would be obtained under an uneasy cease-fire, including maintaining Russia’s current geostrategic posture indefinitely and increasing the concentration of power in the hands of the Kremlin. However, a higher-temperature conflict also multiplies the stresses on the Russian system, making events such as Yevgeny Prigozhin’s mutiny in June 2023 more likely and increasing the plausibility of an eventual wholesale military defeat.\n\nPolitical Transit\n\nOne way or another, and regardless of the disposition of the war, Vladimir Putin will eventually leave office. While it does not appear likely that he will do so in the immediate future, it would be foolish to rule it out entirely, if the task is to prepare for the full range of plausible futures. As such, it is helpful to review the basic configurations of regime change in Russia.\n\nAny transition phase would bring about political instability. The absence of an established process for choosing a new leader, along with the sway of informal structures over formal institutions and patronage connections within the “network state,” complicates the task of efficiently handling the transition and fostering the establishment of a successor government.\n\nThe key initial variable in any regime-change scenario is whether the change of leadership is planned. In some cases, this might happen because a leader cultivates a successor, as Nursultan Nazarbayev did in Kazakhstan. In others, it might happen because the leader is elderly and a transfer of power thus seems only a matter of time, as was the case in the Soviet Union in the early 1980s. Neither of those conditions appears plausible in Russia, however, at least in the near future; Putin has had ample opportunity to transfer power to a successor and has shown no appetite for doing so, and he appears to be in reasonably good health.\n\nAssuming, then, that regime change happens in an unplanned manner, the next key variable is whether the existing ruling elite can come to a consensus on who takes over. A consensual transition would allow the successor to maintain most or all of the levers of power currently enjoyed by Putin, including control over the media, the Duma, the coercive apparatus, and the commanding heights of the economy, although the need to seek compromise with competing groups within the elite may lead to increased autonomy for some.\n\nIf the elite cannot agree on a consensus candidate to succeed Putin, then the process becomes competitive. The contours of the competition will depend in large measure on how much the competitors think is at stake. If competitors in one camp or another are convinced that there will be no place for them in the new system, then they have every incentive to prevent the emergence of a new system unless they are in charge at all costs. If elites cannot countenance losing the battle for the Kremlin — either because they fear for their survival or that they’ll be permanently excluded from the political game — they are thus likely to fight, or at least threaten violence. For a time, at least, this will force Russia to focus more on internal conflict than on external conflict, but the end state will depend on who comes to power and the resources they have gained and lost along the way.\n\nIf the various elite factions find that they cannot arrive at a consensus but decide that they don’t want to fight it out, they are likely to decide the contest via an election. This scenario is particularly plausible if the balance of force available to the elite factions is relatively even, and thus if nobody has the certainty of victory. Instead of risking a winner-takes-all fight to the death, the elite could — as many authoritarian elites have in the past — decide to fall back on constitutional procedure.\n\nGiven the state of Russian politics and political institutions, it is difficult to imagine that such an election would be free and fair. It would, as with all of Russia’s post-Soviet elections, be subject to fraud and manipulation. But even on that basis, it would be competitive, to the extent that the winner is not a forgone conclusion. It would also fracture the regime’s monopoly on the media and on the political space more broadly, helping a plethora of new conversations to emerge out into the open. To many people, it might even feel like democracy.\n\nIn such a scenario, however, anyone trying to argue that the war was a mistake will face the inertia of public opinion. It is likely, then, that such elections would bring to power someone who in important ways sounds a lot like Putin and pursues many of the same policies. And as a result, while there may be some shifts toward opening to the West, and while the power structure itself may begin to change, there is not likely to be a short-term improvement of Russia’s international standing.\n\nBears and Foxes\n\nWestern sanctions policy has been predicated in part on the idea that the elite’s interests and those of the Putin regime are not entirely aligned in the context of this war. The war, after all, has cut elites off from their assets in the West, thus depriving them of autonomy vis-à-vis the Kremlin, and robbed Russia’s super rich of some $100 billion in wealth. There has been no appreciable elite resistance to the war, however.\n\nIn fact, to the extent we have seen a visible elite fissure, it has been around the question of whether Putin is fighting hard enough. It is impossible to know whether people like the late Yevgeny Prigozhin argued for Russia to fight harder because they were ideologically committed to the cause, or because they found the cause materially beneficial. There is no question, however, that a significant number of Russian elites have found and continue to find the war and geopolitical confrontation with the West materially beneficial, regardless of their ideological orientation. Others may have devised ways to justify what they personally view as a challenging and unwanted situation, or have come to terms with it. Consequently, these same individuals may easily adjust to significantly different circumstances and similarly offer their unwavering support to a leadership succeeding Putin.\n\nFocusing on material interests rather than ideology, however, reveals one evident dividing line among the Russian elite, running between those who believe that long-term geopolitical confrontation with the West works in their favor, and those who believe that they would be better off with a return to something approaching the status quo ante.((Ivan Fomin, “The Six Types of Putin’s Elites,” Riddle, May 13, 2022, https://ridl.io/the-six-types-of-putin-s-elites/.)) If the former group (call them the “Bears”) captures Putin’s attention or comes to power, some version of this war is likely to continue, and Russia’s configuration of interests as described earlier in this paper are also likely to remain the same.\n\nIf the latter group (call them the “Foxes”) is in ascendance, however, the improvement in Russia’s relationship with Ukraine and the West is only likely to be temporary and limited. This is because any configuration of the current Russian elite who come to power post-war or post-Putin is most likely to seek to replicate the kleptocratic and patronage relationships at the core of the Putin system, just with greater efficiency and less friction. For a time, that might lead elites to seek a kind of reconciliation — but unless Russia’s internal power structure fundamentally changes, the dynamics that brought it into conflict with the West will eventually reemerge. Only if there are substantial and enduring political transformations would it be possible for Russia’s strategic culture to undergo any modifications.\n\nIf the Bears — current Russian elites who have come to see their material interests best served by continuing large-scale geopolitical confrontation with the West — dominate the negotiating process through which the elite choose a successor, they will, in all likelihood, need to keep at least some of the Foxes in the system, as they occupy key posts and have key technocratic skills. Their overarching aim, however, will be to keep the Foxes and their interests in the financial sector and the digital economy in subordinate positions, while maintaining the extraordinary levels of defense spending — expected to hit $109 billion in 2024, which is 29.4% of Russia’s total proposed expenditures — from which the Bears have so greatly benefitted.\n\nWith the Bears ascendant, the world would witness a continuation of Russia’s current policies: Russia will remain at war in Ukraine (assuming war is ongoing at the time of transition), its structural conflict with the West will be cemented, and it will seek an ever closer relationship with China. Russia will maintain its war economy, retool, and prepare for the next war, and the war after that. Levels of political repression will increase, and the system will likely develop a more concerted political ideology to justify and explain the final abandonment of Russia’s erstwhile openness.\n\nIf, however, the Foxes — current Russian elites who see their interests best served by returning to something approaching life before the war — dominate the succession process, they will also need to keep their opponents around, less because of their skills than because trying to push them out of power would be too dangerous. Thus, while the Foxes would likely seek to push the state at least partially out of the private sector and reduce Putin’s emphasis on defense and national security spending, they would nonetheless seek to compensate the Bears for their diminished status by maintaining at least some the volume of rents available to them. They would also face significant challenges to social stability, particularly in the early phases after a change in leadership.\n\nTo serve the interests of the ascendant Foxes and placate the recalcitrant Bears, Russia in this scenario would seek to end the conflict, reduce sanctions, and reintegrate, as far as possible, with the West. Because this is still an authoritarian transition, the ruling Foxes would enjoy control over all of the things Putin currently controls, including the media, the coercive apparatus, the Duma, and so on. As a result, it is politically possible to engineer a shift in public opinion, so long as the propaganda machine projects the leader as a reflection of social consensus. Depending on how well this goes, it may even be possible to restore Ukrainian territorial integrity and make reparation payments.\n\nThe Foxes’ power in this scenario, however, is predicated on them maintaining and even improving the same kleptocratic and patronage practices that made Putin so successful in his earlier years, and that drove Russia inexorably into conflict with Europe and the US. As a result, any improvement in Russia’s relations with the leading Western powers is likely to be temporary.\n\nThus, while it is plausible that, depending on who comes to power, an elite-led regime change could result in a temporary amelioration of the Russian threat, it would be a mistake to assume that such an amelioration could be long-lasting. A genuine and permanent reorientation of Russian foreign policy toward a long-term rapprochement with the West in such a scenario is not plausible.\n\nThe Democrats\n\nRussia’s pro-democratic opposition was largely a spent force well before February 2022. Increasing repression beginning in 2017 had sent increasing numbers of activists, journalists, and ordinary dissident citizens into exile, and many to prison. A year and a half into the war, the situation has only gotten worse: Leading opposition figures Alexei Navalny, Ilya Yashin, and Vladimir Kara-Murza are serving long prison terms on political charges, while their comrades and scores of independent journalists attempt — largely in vain — to carry on the fight from abroad. While they play an important role in helping to get information in and out of Russia, supporting Ukrainian and Russian refugees, and advocating on behalf of political prisoners, as well as organizing largely futile acts of resistance on the ground, there is little sense that any of these efforts can bring about a change in the makeup or direction of the Russian regime.\n\nNonetheless, a change in the makeup or direction of the Russian regime could, in certain circumstances, lead to a significant change in the position and role of Russia’s democratic opposition. Any government that seeks to stabilize or even improve relations with the West — even if only on a temporary basis — is likely to improve the position of Russia’s political prisoners and exiles as an olive branch. If the process of political transit also involves more or less pluralist elections, as described above, the elite may find it expedient to allow members of Russia’s democratic opposition to contest those elections. The Bears, if they come to power, may make symbolic concessions to the pro-democratic opposition to placate the Foxes. The Foxes, if they come to power, may seek to co-opt the pro-democratic opposition as a hedge against the Bears and an olive branch to the West. Opposition leaders and their supporters in the West, then, should be wary of manipulation and false promises.\n\nShould the position of the opposition change, the consequences are inherently unpredictable. Russia’s current democratic opposition — which emerged as a force in the 2011-12 Bolotnaya protest movement — has never had the chance to contest an election with unimpeded access to both the ballot and the media. As a result, it is impossible to know what kind of support they might be able to garner if they are allowed to compete more or less openly. Moreover, if they are given amnesties as part of this process, it may communicate to the broader Russian public that an injustice had been done, which could help alleviate some of the skepticism with which many Russians have tended to view the democratic opposition.\n\nIf elites turn to an election to decide who should rule, it would be to select among existing establishment groups — not to bring in a new president from the outside. As a result, if the democratic opposition generates a groundswell of support, the elite are likely to push back, restricting their ability to mobilize and justifying such restrictions with reference to the support opposition activists and leaders have received from the West. Such attempts at suppression can backfire, leading to even more mobilization, but they are more likely to succeed — and so the most likely role to be played by Russia’s democratic opposition is to legitimize by their presence an election they are unlikely to win.\n\nIn the unlikely but still plausible event that the democratic opposition does enter into power after Putin’s departure, it would not guarantee the establishment of democracy in Russia. Democratically minded politicians, after all, took control of Russia in December 1991 and proceeded to sow the seeds of the present autocracy. Once in power, they would face powerful opposition from the old elite and large sections of the public, as well as a state apparatus built for corruption and conflict; the potential for failure is clear. Nevertheless, the arrival in power of the democratic opposition is the only near- to mid-term route to a genuine break from Russia’s long-standing geostrategic orientation.\n\nThe Russian Public\n\nRussians’ antipathy to the US, Europe, and Ukraine was close to an eight-year low when Putin decided to go to war. Even since the war began, while approximately 70% of Russians express support for the so-called “special military operation,” there is evidence that much of this support is passive. While most Russians will support whatever course of action Putin pursues, a majority prefer negotiations to continued fighting (even if they aren’t ready to make concessions) and favor improving relations with the West.\n\nNonetheless, this support — passive or otherwise — has been more than sufficient to allow Russia to continue fighting at increasing cost to its own citizens and with rising levels of atrocity in Ukraine. Most Russians’ reaction to the war has been not to react at all, regardless of political orientation of valence: pictures of atrocities from Ukraine, soldiers coming back in body bags, drones hitting buildings in Moscow, the arrest of nationalist figure Igor Girkin, or the death of the warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin — none of these have had any appreciable effect on Russian public opinion.\n\nThe degree to which this state of affairs is enabled by repression is difficult to ascertain, although it almost certainly plays a role. A larger role, however, seems to be played by a long-standing culture of political inertia, in which Russian citizens tend not to respond to events that occur outside the realm of their lives, and to seek individual rather than collective solutions when problems do occur in their lives. Even servicemen’s wives and mothers — who have traditionally been at the heart of anti-war mobilization in Russia — have remained largely silent. Many of those who fled the country since the war began did so not because they supported Ukraine or opposed Putin, but because they simply didn’t want to have to fight.\n\nAs a result, there is little evidence to suggest that ordinary Russians would demand that this war be carried forward, whether under Putin or anyone else, or that they would pull Putin down if he fails to obtain a victory. But there is equally little to suggest that ordinary Russians would demand — under Putin or any other leader — an end to the fighting or a restoration of the status quo ante.\n\nThe most plausible assumption, then, is that most Russians would remain largely inert and follow their leadership in virtually any direction, whether on this war or the next one, so long as that leadership is understood to enjoy consensus support across society. If, however, there is a scenario in which that sense of consensus breaks down, then public opinion may come into play in a more active manner, as would-be successors to Putin vie for public support. In such a scenario, the outcome would be fundamentally unpredictable — but the basic human tendency is toward consistency of expressed opinion over time. Thus, people who have spent the first years of the war expressing support are unlikely to abandon that support during a political contest.\n\nThe Regions\n\nA country as large and diverse as Russia cannot be ruled from Moscow alone. Any process of political change will provoke responses in Russia’s regions. The current relationship between the Kremlin and the regions — in which regional governors are on salary with little functional autonomy, tasked with extracting revenue and compliance from their regions for the benefit of the system — masks significant underlying cleavages and imbalances, which can return to the fore. As a result, whoever succeeds Putin will need to either rapidly reassert Putin’s prerogative in relations with the regions, or devise a new federal bargain.\n\nThe process of transit from Putin to a successor — even if that transit is carefully stage-managed by a consolidated elite — will be perceived by regional leaders as a moment of weakness. For some regional leaders, particularly those who owe their positions to Putin and who have no genuine local power base, this will be a moment of anxiety, as they seek to secure their positions with the new leadership. For others, particularly those who enjoy a strong local power base — like Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin, St. Petersburg head Georgii Poltavchenko, or Tatarstan’s Rustam Minnikhanov, to say nothing of Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov — it will look like an opportunity to renegotiate their relationships with Moscow, perhaps gaining more political and fiscal autonomy.\n\nHow those negotiations play out will depend in large measure on who comes to power in Moscow, as well as the economic situation and the new regime’s ability to buy off different political constituencies. If it is the Bears, with their emphasis on national security and geopolitical confrontation, ambitious regional leaders are likely to be replaced by more subservient suzerains. If it is the Foxes, with their emphasis on economic enrichment, more flexible bargains may be struck. The center-periphery relationship will also depend significantly on the popularity and perceived strength of Putin’s successor. A successor who is seen as strong and who enjoys broad nationwide popularity (even if only thanks to propaganda) will be able to use regional publics to hem in governors. By contrast, a successor who is seen as weak and unpopular will be vulnerable to attack and disobedience from governors whose powerbases may be comparatively stronger.\n\nRussia’s regions, of course, are not created equal, and that, too, will be a source of challenge for the new regime. Many regions — including ethnic republics such as Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, and Chechnya, as well as Russian-majority regions in Siberia and the Far East — have a strong sense of local identity and a residual resentment of rule from Moscow. Others, especially the Muslim-majority republics of the North Caucasus, have fresh memories of brutalization. And still others, such as Sakha-Yakutia or the Komi Republic, continue to see their tremendous natural resource endowments shipped away, with little of that wealth reinvested in the region. The resulting friction has historically been difficult for Moscow to manage, and it has been ameliorated only under a flood of liquidity from Russia’s post-1999 oil boom. It is thus possible that the post-Putin federal bargain will not suit all regions, and fragmentation — particularly at the country’s edges — may result.\n\nSecuring Ukraine\n\nDefeating Russia in Ukraine is the crux of successful containment. With respect to both the current crisis and to the defense and promotion of the West’s long-term strategic interests, allowing Russia to win communicates both to Putin and to governments around the region and the world that Russia is incontrovertibly dominant in the post-Soviet space, leaving Russia’s other neighbors little choice but to fall into line. With Ukraine subjugated, Moscow would conclude that it enjoys free rein as well in Belarus and Moldova, the South Caucasus and Central Asia — and would likely seek to exercise that self-claimed prerogative. By contrast, a Russian defeat in Ukraine clearly communicates that the US and Europe are not inclined to let Russia limit the sovereignty and autonomy of its neighbors.\n\nThe first task in containing Russia, then, is to prevent its military — and then its political and economic — domination of Ukraine. That means more than simply helping Ukraine win the war, though that is where it starts. Containment also requires ensuring that Ukraine wins the peace through successful long-term reconstruction and recovery, and through reforms that will harden the country’s soft targets by reducing the role of oligarchs, strengthening civil society and democracy, and ensuring that Russia pays a just price for its crimes.\n\nRussia as a Threat and a Neighbor\n\nIt is common to note that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine did not begin in February 2022. From a Ukrainian perspective, however, Russian aggression also did not really begin in February 2014, with the occupation of Crimea and intervention in the Donbas. Russia has historically viewed Ukraine as a territory rightly subject to Moscow’s influence and control. From the Pereyaslav Agreement of 1654 to Ukraine’s independence in 1991 and thereafter, Russia’s responses have been marked by attempts to exert political, economic, cultural, and military dominion. The justification for such behavior is so deeply rooted in decades and centuries of Russian internal doctrine and propaganda and continues to be peddled through Putin’s claim of a common destiny that, even if Russia undergoes profound political change, it is likely to remain a threat to Ukraine for generations to come.\n\nIn principle, the surest guarantee of Ukrainian security would be a Russia that no longer harbors any imperialist ambitions. In reality, however, such a Russia is only likely to emerge decades into the future, if at all. As explained later in this report, most plausible vectors of Russia’s near- and mid-term political development point to continued aggression. The key to successful containment thus hinges on the sustained deterrence of Russia in the long run.\n\nFrom Kyiv’s point of view, then, the enduring threat posed by Russia not just to Ukraine’s territory, but to its very independence and nationhood, cannot be underestimated, ignored, or wished away. To be secure, Ukraine must be prepared for the possibility that Russia will remain an ongoing and existential threat. Moreover, even an outright victory in the current war will not alter the essentially asymmetric nature of the conflict. Russia will always possess superior human and financial resources and can regroup, over time, for a second strike. The persistent Russian threat, meanwhile, need not be of a military nature to be critical. There remains the potential for significant action to Ukraine’s progress toward recovery, reconstruction, and EU and NATO integration. The post-conflict landscapes in Crimea and the Donbas region, in particular, may present ample chances for Russian intervention.\n\nTheoretically, there are multiple routes to reliable security for Ukraine. One is to militarize, with Western technological backing, along the lines of Israel, South Korea, or Taiwan. Another is to build a suite of unilateral arrangements that would allow Ukraine to rely on the deterrent capacity of the US, the UK, Poland, or others. In practice, though, while arguments exist about how and when it should happen, there is only one effective solution: NATO membership.\n\nUkraine does not have the wherewithal to pursue independent militarization on the scale needed to withstand indefinite Russian aggression, nor can it afford the requisite investment while also trying to rebuild from the current war. Flexible unilateral arrangements may be a necessary stop-gap solution, but they lead to diffuse decision-making and invite further provocations and aggression from Russia, while also sending a signal to international investors that Ukraine’s long-term future may be precarious. Only full membership in the core Western defensive alliance can provide solid deterrence against Russian attack.\n\nOnce in place, multilateral security arrangements will provide the deterrence Ukraine needs to focus on reconstruction and recovery, and on the development of Ukraine’s own defensive capabilities, such that Ukraine can transition away from being a subject of the Euro-Atlantic security order toward being an active constituent of that order. Ukraine will need to invest in increased military forces and in an expanded and modernized defense manufacturing sector, giving it ownership over its own security within the alliance.\n\nConstraining Russia from Renewed Aggression\n\nAlong all of the vectors described above — from the war itself, through reconstruction, the hardening of Ukraine’s soft targets, and the establishment of post-war justice — Russia can be expected to resist. Even if Russia is militarily defeated, Ukraine and the West must be prepared for Russia to revert to the soft-power and hybrid methods it has pursued against Ukraine since the early 2000s, and for those tactics to be a prelude for a new invasion.\n\nAfter the current war is won, the US and Europe would thus find it more cost effective to prevent re-escalation by constraining Russia’s ability to return to its habitual trajectory in Ukraine. In the first instance, this would mean resisting the temptation to see a return to non-kinetic aggression as progress. While deterrence against military attack is essential, it is equally important for Western powers to establish robust deterrence against “softer” forms of interference and disruption.\n\nTo this end, the US and Europe will need to maintain an ongoing targeted sanctions regime well beyond the end of the current hostilities. These sanctions would target the following:\n\nRussian state and nonstate actors — including Russian actors domiciled outside Russia itself — that attempt to interfere in the Ukrainian media space and/or electoral politics.\n\nRussian state and nonstate economic actors that attempt to interfere in the governance and productivity of the Ukrainian economy, including its international trading relations.\n\nUkrainian oligarchs and oligarch-linked assets that attempt to undermine de-oligarchization, anti-corruption, and the strengthening of the rule of law in Russia.\n\nRussian and other defendants in internationally recognized tribunals for war crimes, crimes of aggression, and other offenses, regardless of jurisdiction, as well as Russian and non-Russian actors that provide shelter and succor to defendants attempting to avoid justice.\n\nRussian state and nonstate actors that have profited from the occupation and the theft of Ukrainian property.\n\nRussian state and nonstate entities that attempt to avoid performance of reparations obligations, as well as non-Russian entities that provide shelter and cover for reparations avoidance and sanctions avoidance.\n\nEffective implementation of these sanctions will require close coordination among Kyiv, Washington, and Brussels to ensure that sanctions targeting and enforcement are responsive to the governance challenges faced by Ukraine, and that targeted actors are not able to exploit differences in Ukrainian, American, and European law and jurisprudence.\n\nIn addition to these measures, the US and Europe may find it expedient to suspend Russia’s participation in international organizations and political formats until Moscow can demonstrate a consistently constructive approach to the restoration of Ukrainian sovereignty, territorial integrity, and national security. Clear benchmarks should be established, in consultation with Kyiv, to ensure that both Russia and Ukraine have predictability and confidence in both the rewards for good behavior and the consequences of continued malfeasance.\n\nWinning the Peace\n\nAs the Marshall Plan was after World War II, so too is Ukrainian reconstruction much more than just an economic project. Ukraine’s post-war success equates to Russia’s strategic failure. It is also an investment in a more secure and prosperous world, and thus in vital American and European interests. Whether Ukraine emerges from the war successful will set the precedent for future conflicts and determine American and Western credibility. Moreover, Ukraine is a key player in global energy, agricultural, and other commodity markets, without whom markets will remain unstable.\n\nThe US and Europe are already playing an important role in Ukrainian wartime resilience, and the rebuilding of critical infrastructure — particularly in the energy and transportation sectors — is well underway.((Kiel Institute, “Ukraine Support Tracker – A Database of Military, Financial and Humanitarian Aid to Ukraine,” February 2023, https://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/.)) Looking further ahead, the US and Europe will need to provide a consistent and predictable level of support; assistance with public-sector capacity building; a clear pathway to EU integration, ensuring robust conditionality; and, of course, security. Critically, reconstruction and recovery should focus on more than just rebuilding what was destroyed, but on building a more efficient, productive, and secure Ukraine for the future. This includes hardening not only the governance of the Ukrainian economy, but also its physical security, through investment in distributed infrastructures that are harder to target and robust anti-aircraft defense systems (see Box One).\n\nReconstruction and Recovery\n\nThe destruction wrought by Russia’s invasion varies from region to region, with areas closer to the front line and those having experienced occupation suffering the most damage. These regions in particular may encounter difficulties in attracting investment, causing them to lag in their recoveries and creating new regional imbalances, as well as opportunities for Russia to destabilize Ukraine. To mitigate this, the US should integrate the development and implementation of local projects into its support efforts, building on Ukraine’s successful decentralization reforms and local authorities’ role in managing wartime crises.\n\nTerritories that were under occupation will require particular care and support from the US in the restoration of Ukrainian power and the facilitation of reintegration. While such discussions have largely focused on Crimea, initiating discussions about the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts with Ukrainian civil society and Ukraine’s international partners is equally important. Such discussions can also help elaborate recovery projects that impede Russia’s ability to sow and capitalize on discord within and among Ukrainian communities. Another formidable obstacle will involve addressing domestic political and social reconciliation, which entails the unification of communities that have been torn apart, disrupted, and fractured by war and the significant population shifts since 2014.\n\nThere is also a critical role for the US and other Western governments to play in facilitating war insurance mechanisms to encourage private capital to invest in Ukraine, stimulating economic recovery and growth. Having helped to channel post-war investment to recovery projects around the world, US experience and expertise can be vital here.\n\nSimilarly vital is the US role in the establishment of a Project Implementation Unit in Ukraine. The challenge Ukraine faces now and will face in the future is not so much a shortage of funds, but the effective use of existing resources. The task of undertaking thousands of projects simultaneously across the country is daunting and will require Western technical assistance. The ineffective use of funds, or perceived ineffectiveness, will sap Western willingness to support Ukraine and provide an opening for renewed Russian military and/or hybrid intervention.\n\nFinally, a successful Ukrainian recovery effort will require clear political leadership from Washington. While impressive in their scope and ambition, the projects currently addressing recovery — including those at the US Agency for International Development, the EU’s Multi-agency Donor Coordination Platform, the World Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development — are technocratic in nature and lack the leverage to unlock new sources of funding.\n\nThe appointment of former Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker as the US special envoy for Ukraine’s recovery is an important step in this direction, which will need to be matched on the European side. Critically, only concerted political leadership will resolve the problem of how to access the $320+ billion in frozen Russian assets.\n\nBox One: Ukrainian Reconstruction and Recovery\n\nFor a full analysis of the near-, mid- and long-term challenges of Ukrainian reconstruction, see CEPA’s upcoming report, Resilience, Reconstruction, Recovery: The Path Ahead for Ukraine. The following passage is an excerpt from that report.\n\nThe damage wrought by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is difficult to overestimate. Dollar terms — which put the scale of rebuilding at anywhere between $400 billion and $1 trillion — do not fully reflect the reality of what is at stake. Beyond winning the war itself, restoring and reinforcing Ukraine’s prosperity, stability, and security after nearly a decade of sustained Russian attack will reduce the likelihood of further conflicts in Ukraine and around the world, reestablish American and Western credibility on the world stage, rebalance global energy and commodity markets, and ensure the future of the European project. Failure to restore Ukraine’s prosperity, stability, and security, by contrast, will usher in a world of more war, less development, and broken leadership.\n\nThe agenda for Ukrainian recovery is clear. Western governments must:\n\nMaximize Ukraine’s wartime resilience in the face of continued Russian aggression.\n\nInvest in the economy and infrastructure of Ukraine’s future, rather than its past.\n\nPrepare for Ukraine’s rapid integration into the European Union and NATO.\n\nHarden Ukraine’s state, economy, and infrastructure against future threats.\n\nWhile full-scale reconstruction will take place only after the fighting ends, the work of recovery begins now. Waiting for the war to end will only push success further into the future and increase costs to all involved. Instead, a phased approach to recovery and reconstruction — with clearly defined objectives and logically sequenced tasks at each stage — can underpin consistency of planning and implementation. This approach would involve three phases: wartime resilience, rapid rebuilding, and durable development (see Table Three).\n\nDe-Oligarchization\n\nThe removal from Ukrainian economic and political life of oligarchs — people with outsized degrees of political and economic influence, able to operate outside the normal strictures of the rule of law — is a prerequisite for Ukraine’s accession to the EU. It is also a prerequisite for Ukrainian security.\n\nUkraine’s oligarchs have long been both a direct and indirect channel for Russian interference. Some, such as Viktor Medvedchuk, have put their assets at the service of the Kremlin, using their media holdings and political networks to push Russian messaging and further Russian interests. But even where such relationships do not exist, the corruption associated with the oligarchs gives rise to political disaffection, as well as chronic political fragmentation and potential for policy stalemate, which in turn creates an opening for Moscow to meddle. It is thus clearly in US and European interests to see Ukraine succeed in this endeavor.\n\nThe war itself has already solved part of this problem. The Russian seizure and/or destruction of industrial assets in the country’s east and south, and the nationalization of stakes in strategic enterprises, has already and likely irrevocably altered the balance of economic power in the country. Significant strides, however, have also been made on the reform front. The passage in September 2021 of the so-called Oligarch Law was designed to identify oligarchs and restrict their activities. Many inside and outside Ukraine, however, worry that the law is too focused on targeting individuals, rather than undertaking systemic reforms, and thus that its enforcement is likely to be counterproductive.\n\nThe Venice Commission of the Council of Europe has thus called for the law’s implementation to be deferred. Suggested amendments span judicial reform and antitrust regulations to lobbying controls and tax law. Equally important is the enhancement of transparency in public procurement, the reinforcement of media pluralism, and tighter anti-money laundering measures.\n\nTo ensure that an amended law is effective, Ukraine’s Western partners will need to assist with monitoring and oversight, setting clear and consistent expectations for implementation and reporting, producing a focused action plan, and conducting regular impact assessments. Ukrainian citizens and civil society — and, indeed, the country’s civil servants — will rely on Western leaders to hold the feet of Ukraine’s political leadership to the fire on this.\n\nThere is homework for Western governments to do, too, however. Numerous Ukrainian oligarchs — including the gas magnate Dmytro Firtash, who is wanted on charges in Ukraine — continue to have significant assets in Western Europe and North America. The West’s failure to act in these cases allows these oligarchs to escape justice and prevents the Ukrainian state from achieving de-oligarchization. Similarly, the failure of international lenders to stick to strict conditionality has repeatedly undermined the leverage of reform-minded Ukrainian governments vis-à-vis recalcitrant oligarchic interests. Unless both of these Western failures are addressed, the risk will remain of reemerging avenues of Russian influence.\n\nSupporting Civil Society and Democracy\n\nIn Ukraine, civil society has long stood as a vital bulwark in support of sovereignty and in resistance to Russian aggression, as well as a critical source of pressure for domestic reform, particularly since 2014. Since Russia’s initial aggression in 2014, civil society has played an integral role both in providing much-needed support to Ukraine’s military, and in holding successive governments to their word on reform, particularly in the areas of anti-corruption, decentralization, and transparency. If Ukraine is to remain resilient and free, Ukrainian civil society will have to do even more.\n\nUkrainian civil society is the throughline in the country’s democracy. As elected leaders come and go and as ideas shift, it is the country’s vibrant landscape of civic organizations, analytical centers, universities, and independent media that have ensured that the country remains firmly pluralistic and respects citizens’ civil and democratic rights. When Ukrainian leaders have sought to overstep their bounds, it has been Ukrainian civil society that’s brought them down.\n\nUkraine, however, has never faced a test akin to what lies ahead. While the war rages, consolidation is more or less a given. The longer the war lasts, however, the more pressure there will be for a return to democratic accountability and the more difficult conversations Ukrainians will have about how to pursue the fight. Once the fighting stops and attention turns to winning the peace, the task becomes even harder. Reconstruction, the return of refugees, and the reintegration of occupied territories will require civic oversight, nuanced debate, and social trust — all things civil society will need to deliver.\n\nWestern governments, then, will need to ensure that, as part of their support for Ukrainian security and recovery, they include both material and political support for Ukrainian civil society. This should include both funding for civil society capacity building and an insistence that all major governmental, intergovernmental, and public-private initiatives include civil society representation. This will help ensure that ordinary Ukrainian citizens have a say in how their country is secured and rebuilt, thus once again reducing opportunities for Russian interference.\n\nIn particular, Ukrainian civil society has a critical role to play in a number of key sectors:\n\nTransforming the country’s military landscape. Initiatives range from providing essential items that the armed forces lack to advocating for changes in everything from import regulations to the treatment of troops. Civil society groups continue to streamline support for wounded and disabled veterans, monitor defense procurement, and ensure the efficacy and transparency of defense expenditures.\n\nOverseeing state and regional budgets. Civil society scrutiny ensures fiscal transparency and public sector efficiency, making certain that resources are allocated to projects and programs that benefit the broader population. This watchdog function contributes to the country’s economic stability and political accountability.\n\nDocumenting Russian war crimes and addressing wartime humanitarian challenges. This work extends to critical issues including maintaining bomb shelters, identifying and rescuing prisoners of war and kidnapped civilians, and supporting international tribunals seeking to bring Russia to justice.\n\nSupporting veterans and military families. Civil society and charitable initiatives help provide a crucial safety net and assistance to those who have themselves been injured in combat or who have lost loved ones.\n\nJustice and Accountability\n\nHowever it is or is not resolved, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine demands a comprehensive framework for accountability and justice. While some organizations are attempting to hold Russian leadership accountable for their crimes, such as the International Criminal Court issuing arrest warrants for Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova for the deportation of Ukrainian children, more venues and jurisdictions are needed. Establishing a tribunal for Russian leadership, irrespective of jurisdiction and the presence of the accused, and without an inherent link to the disposition of the conflict, is an imperative step toward restoring justice and a rules-based order.\n\nThe international call for a tribunal to hold Russia’s leadership to account is resolute. This pursuit is not contingent on the war’s termination, but should rather be seen as a matter of urgency, given the gravity and ongoing escalation of the accusations. A trial held in absentia of the accused would not only signify the international community’s commitment to justice, but also allow the world to address ongoing wrongdoings in a more concerted manner.\n\nContending with the injustices of the war, however, requires more than just symbolic gestures. The first order of business is establishing and enforcing responsibility, along three dimensions:\n\nPersonal responsibility. War criminals must be held individually accountable for their actions. Justice must prevail regardless of an individual’s position or geographic location.\n\nState responsibility. Russia bears responsibility for the war and its consequences at the state level. This includes accountability both to the Ukrainian state as such and to private actors affected by the fighting.\n\nCollective responsibility. A true resolution of the war requires a profound recognition of the collective responsibility of Russian citizens for the crimes committed in their name. Such introspection is an essential step toward healing and reconciliation.\n\nFinally, justice must involve reparations. These may begin with the transfer of frozen Russian assets to Ukraine, but should extend beyond this. Russia might, for example, be required in a settlement to provide some volume of energy free of charge to Ukraine and other countries that have suffered as a result of Russia’s aggression.\n\nDeterrence and Denial in Europe\n\nIn Russia’s struggle to make the world safe for its brand of autocracy, the United States is the target. The battleground, however, is Europe. Rightly or wrongly, Moscow perceives Europe as the bleeding edge of Washington’s attempt to reinforce democracy as “the only game in town” globally, and it is from the expansion of the European Union that Vladimir Putin feels most threatened. To blunt American power and give itself free rein to act both regionally and globally, Moscow feels it must not only block the eastward expansion of the European project, but contribute directly to the EU’s destabilization.\n\nContaining Russia, then, requires strengthening the political, diplomatic, and security ties that bind the transatlantic community together, making Europe robust enough to support its own defense in the framework of NATO, and removing the policy gaps between Brussels and Washington into which Moscow might otherwise be tempted to insert itself. Further, as in Ukraine, Europe will need to address its own soft targets, including pressures from authoritarian-populist governments and movements on EU and NATO cohesion, and Europe’s permeability to Russian and other kleptocratic money. Finally, even as it seeks victory for Ukraine, Europe will need to gear up for further geopolitical confrontation with Russia over Belarus, Moldova, and the Black Sea, and to counteract Russian dominance in the South Caucasus and Central Asia.\n\nTransatlantic Strategic Alignment\n\nRussia’s full-scale war on Ukraine has brought the United States and Europe closer than at any point since the end of the Cold War. Transatlantic alignment has been in evidence since the earliest days of the war, with nearly lockstep responses on sanctions and military support, which, while insufficient thus far to secure a clear Ukrainian victory, has nonetheless far outstripped what many believed was possible. Europe and the US share a clear political vision on the need to defeat Russia in Ukraine, isolate Moscow regionally and globally, and prevent it from destabilizing Europe and the world in the future.\n\nThis unity, however, is fragile. Strategic alignment is vulnerable to factors including electoral cycles, “Ukraine fatigue” and “war fatigue,” and the greater willingness in some capitals and political circles to countenance a near-term return to the status quo ante in commercial relations with Moscow. As a result, the challenge lies in maintaining this alignment on Russia and extending that alignment to weather the dual challenge of adversarial relations with both Moscow and Beijing.\n\nAlignment is not easy. Russia remains a complex issue, where the lack of defensive muscle memory and connective tissue is exacerbated by the presence of residual reflexes toward collaboration and ostensibly productive engagement. There are important constituencies on both sides of the Atlantic who are likely to seek compromise with Moscow, extend olive branches, accommodate Moscow’s revanchist demands, or even attempt another “reset” of relations.\n\nThe cost of unity increases still further when Russia and China are addressed simultaneously. The fact that it took two invasions of Ukraine, the downing of MH-17, a chemical weapons attack on British soil, and countless crimes against humanity to achieve even the current degree of support for Ukraine and unity versus Russia suggests that the threshold for achieving alignment remains high.\n\nBecause the key front lines in the conflict with Russia run through the European continent, much of the analysis and recommendations that follow focus on Europe. Indeed, if it is in America’s strategic interest to contain Russia, then Europe is the indispensable ally, without which that objective cannot be achieved. Equally, however, Europe cannot attain that aim without America. European unity in support of Ukraine and in resistance to Russia has been made possible in large measure due to astute and sensitive American leadership, recognizing and accommodating Europe’s complex interests while maintaining a resolute commitment to the security of every inch of NATO territory. Maintaining unity in the future — without which Russia cannot be contained — will thus require continued American commitment not only to America’s interests, but to the security of Europe itself.\n\nUltimately, defeating and constraining Russia while deterring China will require sensitive but resolute leadership from Washington. Short-sighted focuses on bones of political contention, such as the framing of the current transatlantic power imbalance, the optics of burden sharing, and the distribution of procurement contracts, should take a back seat to the strategic realization that the US and EU are locked into adversarial relations with Moscow and Beijing for the short, medium, and long terms. Only a unified transatlantic community can prevail.\n\nEuropean Strategic Sufficiency\n\nThe invasion of U"
