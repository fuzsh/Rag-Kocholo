        "text": "Highway Going Nowhere\n\nRublevka guide, the main road of Russia\n\nMaria Zholobova, Daniil Sotnikov, Roman Badanin\n\nPutin’s Family\n\nRublevo-Uspenskoe highway, or simply Rublevka, is the most expensive place to live in the country. Having studied thousands of statements on the ownership of ruble real estate, “Project” came to an important conclusion about Russian society and economy: a huge part of the richest landowners in the country are people in one way or another connected with the state, working for it, receiving contracts from it, leading friendship and love with officials.\n\nPUTIN’S PSYCHOLOGICAL MAKEUP\n\nSee the map of the settlement of Rublevka inhabitants and read a special project dedicated to the 100th anniversary of Rublevka in its current form.\n\nhttps://cybershafarat.com/2022/08/16/cognitive-warfare-training/\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev both reportedly have homes in the area.\n\nThe history of Rublevka as we know it began with Joseph Stalin, with his decision in 1919, when the victorious Bolsheviks set out to look for summer residences for themselves. Stalin’s choice fell on an estate that before the revolution belonged to the richest Moscow oil industrialist and philanthropist Lev Zubalov, who, like Dzhugashvili, came from Georgia. Lev Zubalov was afraid of an assassination attempt. The industrialist fenced off his phobias with blank fences atypical for the nobility, which came in handy for the future leader, who also feared for his life. This fence has survived on Rublevka to this day – now the head of the Russian Guard, Viktor Zolotov, lives behind it.\n\nRublevka is a group of elite residential towns (Barvikha, Razdory, Zhukovka, Usovka, Gorki) located 10 km west of Moscow. It’s home to politicians, oligarchs, generals, celebrities and even some not-just spiritually wealthy officials of the Russian Orthodox Church. Rublevka is an unofficial name, so you won’t find it on any map, but thanks to journalists, realtors and comedy sketch writers the word has stuck in the national consciousness.\n\nhttps://cybershafarat.com/2018/10/04/russian-parastatal-entities/\n\nList of names and a brief job description:\n\nHadith Abazehov\n\nThe owner of the Rial distiller\n\nRenat Abdullin\n\nDeputy General Director of Interfax\n\nСодержание:\n\nШоссе в никуда\n\nМир — дворцам\n\nВойна — хижинам\n\nОт Ильича до Ильича\n\nПочетные ссыльные\n\nПервый и последний президенты\n\nТайна частной жизни\n\nПионеры Рублевки\n\nЭлитный район, хорошие соседи\n\nДорога роскоши\n\nКриминальная рублевка\n\nДорога ярости\n\nПитерская рублевка\n\nНовая номенклатура\n\nКто все эти люди?\n\nКонец эпохи\n\nКак мы искали и считали\n\nНад проектом работали\n\nСписок персон\n\nAlexander Abramov\n\nShareholder of Evraz Group\n\nAlsu Abramova\n\nDaughter of the former Lukoil shareholder Ralif Safin\n\nCompany associated with Roman Abramovich\n\nSite owner – Parcel company, beneficiary – Roman Abramovich\n\nRoman Abramovich\n\nOligarch\n\nIrina Abramovich\n\nEx-wife of businessman Roman Abramovich\n\nVladislav Abrahamyan\n\nThe son of businessman Ara Abrahamyan\n\nNatalia Abrahamyan\n\nThe wife of businessman Ara Abrahamyan\n\nMikhail Abyzov\n\nFormer “minister without portfolio”\n\nWho lives off Rublevka?\n\nAll state structures\n\nKremlin and government\n\nDeputies and senators\n\nSiloviki Judges\n\nBudgetary employees\n\nRegional officials\n\nOil and gas State companies\n\nGovernment contractors\n\nCIS elite\n\nPutin’s entourage\n\nState residences\n\nSoviet nomenclature\n\nSoviet infrastructure\n\nBusiness Billionaires\n\nBankers\n\nRublev realtors\n\nCulture\n\nWho are these people?\n\nCrime\n\nFormer spies of the US (past and present)\n\nKamo Avagumyan\n\nCo-owner of the Avilon automobile company\n\nLira Avagumyan\n\nA relative of Kamo Avagumyan – co-owner of the Avilon automobile company\n\nSergey Avanesov\n\nPresumably, the son of Avanesov Aghajan, a former shareholder of Starbank who fled abroad\n\nMikhail Avdyukov\n\nFormer prosecutor of the Moscow region and Moscow\n\nPetr Aven\n\nFormer Minister of Foreign Economic Relations of the Russian Federation in the Gaidar government, co-owner of Alfa-Bank\n\nPavel Averin\n\nNamesake of the former executive director of the Pension Fund, the former head of the State Duma apparatus\n\nVladimir Avetisyan\n\nNamesake of the Deputy Chairman of the Board of Rusnano\n\nBekkhan Agayev\n\nFormer State Duma deputy\n\n“Agrocomplex Gorki-2”\n\nBeneficiaries – Gavril Yushvaev, David Yakobashvili, Timofey Klinovsky\n\nNadezhda Advokatova\n\nThe wife of restaurateur Arkady Novikov\n\nGagik Adibekyan\n\nFounder of the development company RD Group, “the king of Russian real estate” according to Forbes\n\nFamily of Marat Azhimov\n\nMarat Azhimov – Deputy Head of the Experimental Development Department\n\nMykola Azarov\n\nFormer Prime Minister of Ukraine\n\nLilia Azarova\n\nNamesake of the daughter-in-law of the former Prime Minister of Ukraine Mykola Azarov\n\nLyudmila Azarova\n\nThe wife of the former Prime Minister of Ukraine Mykola Azarov\n\nElena Azimova\n\nRakhim Azimov’s wife – State Duma deputy\n\nAidar Akayev\n\nSon of the former President of Kyrgyzstan Askar Akayev\n\nRustam Akiniyazov\n\nNamesake of the commercial director of the Aeroexpress company\n\nMikhail Axelrod\n\nFormer member of the Management Board of Gazprom, ex-head of Gazprom Invest Yug\n\nDmitry Aksenov\n\nFounder of the development company RDI Group\n\nHeydar Aliyev\n\nSon of the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev\n\nLeyla Aliyeva\n\nDaughter of the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev\n\nNailya Allakhverdova\n\nThe wife of the former high-ranking customs officer Elchin Safarov\n\nSergey Almazov\n\nFormer head of the Federal Tax Police Service\n\nIrina Ambartsumyan\n\nDaughter of Sergei Ambartsumyan, founder of the Monarch concern, former deputy head of the Moscow City Planning Policy Department\n\nLazzat Amzeeva\n\nSister of Shakizat Amzeev.
