        "text": "Mark J. Terrill/Associated Press\n\nThe Golden State Warriors officially announced the addition of Steve Nash, a two-time NBA Most Valuable Player, as a part-time player development consultant Friday.\n\nThe team confirmed the hire on its official site, noting the longtime point guard will do on-court work with the reigning champions \"periodically throughout the season.\" Head coach Steve Kerr explained the decision to bring Nash aboard:\n\nSteve Nash was one of the best guards to ever play in this league and we are so happy to add him to our staff and have him working with our players. Even though he possessed incredible individual skills and abilities, Steve always played the game with a team-first mentality, which is something that we emphasize greatly within our group. Steve and I have a great relationship from our time together in Phoenix while I was general manager, and we share a lot of beliefs about how the game should be played and about the work ethic that goes in to being great. I canâ€™t wait to work with him again and have him around our team.\n\nThe release also included a statement from Nash, who expressed enthusiasm about working with such a talented roster and within a system he understands. His overall goal is to \"pass along some of the lessons that I learned during my career.\"\n\nHe previously discussed getting the opportunity to work with Warriors superstar Stephen Curry, who led the charge as the Warriors captured their first title since 1975 in June. Nash admitted during an interview with Sportsnet on Thursday that there might not be much to teach him, per Diamond Leung of the San Jose Mercury News.\n\n\"As I've told Steph, his skill level is so high that although we'll be on the court together, I don't know how much I can help him on the court,\" Nash said. \"But through watching a little bit of film and talking, maybe I can help him with situations. But his skill level is incredible, and hopefully I'll learn as much from him as he will from me.\"\n\nThe Warriors weren't the only team interested in Nash. Both the Lakers and Suns tried to hire the former guard in a similar position to what the Warriors ultimately gave him, according to Marc J. Spears of Yahoo Sports. However, Nash later clarified the offers came after he had already agreed with the Warriors.\n\nNash's career ended on a low note, as he struggled to stay on the court because of back problems. At his peak, however, few players could match his ability to run an offense. He combined an efficient shooting skill set with high-end passing ability.\n\nAll told, Nash scored more than 17,300 points and dished out more than 10,300 assists across in 1,217 career regular-season games. Along with his pair of MVP awards, he also was named to eight All-Star teams. A spot in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame awaits him in a handful of years.\n\nFor now, he'll focus on his new role with the Warriors. While Nash may not be able to elevate Curry's game much more, he should be a tremendous resource for the rest of the roster. That's particularly true in terms of better understanding how to read the floor and play strong team basketball."
