        "text": "Steve Nash was hired this week as the head coach of the Brooklyn Nets, which have two of the greatest All-Stars in the NBA, Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irvin. Commentators have shared that the hiring of Nash, a white male with no coaching experience is a great example of white privilege. The view is in retrospect to how black coaches continue to get passed over with more experience and success in the NBA.\n\nI would like to share a new perspective that I call the Fredericken Paradigm. It is the perspective that there are white people in their lowly positions that helps catapult people of color into the limelight of success and some day in the near future those deeds are not forgotten and rewarded.\n\nFrederick Douglas in his autobiography shares, “I adopted a plan [of making friends] of all the little white boys whom I met in the street. I converted them into [my teachers and finally succeeded in learning to read]. I always took a book and bread, because I was most welcome to many of the poor white children in our neighborhood. I bestow upon the hungry children bread and they would give me that more valuable bread of knowledge.”\n\nSteve Nash may be white with little coaching experience, but has done nothing but give bread of knowledge and opportunity to people of color. He is one of those individuals that spent the majority of his life in a profession where he was the minority and yet humbly utilized his skills and talents to assist other players to score and become super stars. Nash is one of the greatest point guards in the sport, but he never won an NBA Championship. Most do not know that he was overlooked by recruiters and had to grind his way into college and the NBA. He retired and spent most of his days behind the scenes with the Golden State Warriors as a consultant and never accepting a championship ring, though he was a contributing factor to their success. He befriended Kevin Durant (KD) as a mentor, so I am not surprised that KD advocated and is thrilled to have Nash as his Coach. KD is an example of a modern day Frederick Douglass giving alms to the little poor boys on Philpot Street. Of course KD is going to assist to catapult someone instrumental in his life like Nash, regardless of color. Nash's children are biracial, thus his sensitivity to the subject. The players in the NBA is Nash’s extended family and I am certain that the decision of him becoming a coach had more to do with how he has helped people of color excel in the sport more so than him leveraging his white privilege. White privilege? Really? Let’s reward this man for humbling himself to embrace and propel the lives of many young people of color.\n\nIn the spirit of Frederick Douglass, what if we people of color adopted a plan to \"befriend all the little white boys on the street?\" How much would we advance them and how much would they enrich us?"
