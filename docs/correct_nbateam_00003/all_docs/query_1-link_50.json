        "text": "Former Brooklyn Nets head coach Steve Nash has met with the Toronto Raptors to discuss their vacant head-coaching position, according to Shams Charania of The Athletic. Nash was hired by the Nets in September of 2020 to be the head coach for Brooklyn after reportedly being preferred by Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving.\n\nNash coached the Nets from the 2020-21 season to the 2022-23 season, but was fired seven games into his third season after guiding Brooklyn to a 2-5 start despite being considered title contenders prior to the season starting. Before the 2022-23 season began, Durant requested to be traded in part because of how Nash conducted practices.\n\nNash coached the Nets for 161 games and in that span, he amassed a 94-67 record (58.4%), including a 7-13 mark (35%) in the playoffs. During Nash’s tenure in Brooklyn, he won Eastern Conference Coach of the Month in February of the 2020-21 season and received the sixth-most votes for Coach of the Year that season."
