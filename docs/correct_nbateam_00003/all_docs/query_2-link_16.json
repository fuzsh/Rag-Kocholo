        "text": "Bruce Fraser was enjoying his vacation in Mexico when Steve Nash called him on Sept. 2.\n\nFriends since their days in Phoenix when Fraser was a scout and Nash the franchise player, the Warriors assistant coach thought Nash, who was calling from Brooklyn, was about to deliver some bad news to him.\n\n“I have something to tell you,” Fraser recalled Nash saying.\n\n“Uh oh,” Fraser replied.\n\nIt turned out that Nash had pulled one of the more surprising moves in basketball in a year full of the unexpected. Nash was leaving his part-time position as a player development consultant for Golden State to become the Nets’ next head coach.\n\n“I was caught off guard by the call,” Fraser told The Athletic a few days later. “I acted as anyone would act.”\n\nNash was officially introduced as Brooklyn’s head coach on Wednesday, which ceremoniously ended his post-playing career as he knew it. In landing Nash, the Nets accomplished a feat that many NBA teams had tried after the Hall of Fame point guard retired in 2015: Getting him to coach. Even though Nash has no previous head coaching experience and he edged out a fully qualified coach in Jacque Vaughn for the job, the gigs he held over the last five years have helped lay some of the groundwork for his upcoming stint in Brooklyn.\n\nWhen Nash joined the Lakers on a three-year, $27.9 million dollar contract in 2012, he passed up offers from the Knicks and Raptors partly because he wanted to stay close to his family on the West Coast. Nash’s family stayed in Los Angeles after he retired and he made them his priority, even as teams approached him about joining them in a coaching capacity. Nash’s longtime agent, Bill Duffy, said investors and entrepreneurs pursued Nash as they constructed bidding groups for team ownership, but Nash declined those inquiries early and told Duffy he wasn’t interested.\n\n“Since he’s been finished playing, his No. 1 priority was for him to get organized with his family and to be present for his family,” Duffy said. “Since the moment he retired, steadily there was interest for him to coach. Everybody’s wanted him.”\n\nInstead, Nash joined the Warriors on a part-time basis in 2015, which allowed him to take short trips to Northern California to work with Stephen Curry and the rest of Golden State’s roster.\n\nEvery time Nash came through Oakland, he worked with Durant. He also made sure to train with the team’s younger players and kept tabs on each one when he was away from the team. Warriors coach Steve Kerr, who was Nash’s general manager in Phoenix, would occasionally have Nash run parts of practice and inserted Nash into drills when Kerr thought his former point guard could speak to the action or situation better than he could.\n\nAs beloved as Nash was in Golden State, those who knew him best wanted to see him do more. Fraser said Nash was crucial during the Warriors’ playoff runs and gave insightful suggestions in meetings when adjustments were required to advance in the postseason. Nash helped Curry’s approach offensively as he picked up how teams were defending Curry before a ball screen and discussed ways to adjust as he came off the screen. But for all his accolades as a player, Nash would hesitate to make himself heard. When the Warriors wanted to give Nash a championship ring in 2017, he wanted to decline it until friends urged him to accept it.\n\n“I had to prod him at times to speak up more, because he’s a humble guy that doesn’t want to be the smartest guy in the room,” Fraser said. “But he is the smartest guy in the room.”\n\nNash’s time in Golden State saw him grow particularly close with Durant, who he was already friends with dating back to the star forward’s rookie season in Seattle. But Nash’s setup with the Warriors allowed him to now give advice from the perspective of an 18-year veteran who had been through it all. Durant was in the middle stages of his career when he joined Golden State and Nash offered suggestions to help his body hold up better over the course of a season. The final few years of Nash’s career were riddled with injuries and over time he thought about things he could have done differently, that could have kept him healthier and maybe extended his career a few more seasons. He didn’t want to see the same thing happen to Durant.\n\nFraser said Nash emphasized less work between games at a higher effort and told Durant to scrap his pregame routine of being one of the first guys out on the court. Instead, Nash told Durant to warm up closer to the start of the game. Durant heeded Nash’s advice. Now, they’re reunited in Brooklyn for what will be the most important season in franchise history.\n\n“Kevin is such a tireless worker and unbelievable talent, and it wasn’t like Nash had to help improve Kevin’s skill, but I think he helped his mindset in knowing that as Kevin’s years started to go, less was more and working efficiently is more important,” Fraser said. “So Nash was critical because Nash is innovative in the way he approaches his own work with the game, and so he’s developing things that helped him that most other players don’t do.\n\n“So he was really valuable with Kevin not just with his mindset, but his innovative approaches to play lower and stronger. Kevin really respects Nash as a person and as a basketball mind, too. That was important.”\n\nAs much as Nash enjoyed the Warriors job, it didn’t change his answer when teams would call Duffy asking him if his longtime client was interested in something bigger.\n\n“He’d shoot it down early,” Duffy said. “Wouldn’t even entertain it. He didn’t want to disrupt (his family). There was a whole plethora of opportunities all the time. I just told them, ‘No he won’t do that.’”\n\nIn his retirement, Nash did remain on as general manager of Canada Basketball before handing over the reins to his close friend Rowan Barrett, the father of Knicks forward RJ Barrett, last year. Nash evaluated every top player in Canada, which is expected to make its first Olympics since 2002 next summer and have a chance to medal. He didn’t preach or emphasize a particular style of play for each team to play. Instead, he encouraged his coaches to see what best served the players’ skill sets and then determine the X’s and O’s.\n\nThose close to him think his time running Team Canada will be helpful as he adjusts to the evaluation part of the job in Brooklyn.\n\n“He was big on player development,” said Michael Meeks, Nash’s friend, former Canadian teammate and colleague at Canada Basketball. “Steve’s not a dictator. What makes a good leader? You’re able to step into a situation, access what’s going on and put together a gameplan. Steve gets to the bullseye a lot more effectively than a lot of people.”\n\nIn addition to working with the Warriors and Canada Basketball, Nash regularly played with NBA players who were passing through Southern California, including Nets guard Caris LeVert. Nash has long enjoyed New York City before Brooklyn hired him and has kept an apartment in the Meatpacking District for years. In 2015, Nash worked out with Kyrie Irving in the city. During his introductory news conference on Wednesday, he called Irving one of his all-time favorite players. Irving and Durant have had rocky relationships with coaches during their careers, but Nash seems to have the respect of both star players at the outset. And if both star players buy into Nash and his vision early, the rest of the job should come easier.\n\nNash said on Wednesday that the idea of coaching frequently crossed his mind, but he did not have a specific moment that compelled him to call Nets general manager Sean Marks, his former teammate in Phoenix, to express his interest in the job.\n\n“It was just something that after a lot of thought, a lot of thinking and strategizing, I felt like I had a lot to offer and this was a unique situation that could suit my skill set,” Nash said.\n\nFraser and Kerr were two of only a handful of people Nash called before Brooklyn announced his hiring. Nash said on Wednesday that he didn’t call Marks until the summer despite the job being available for months after Kenny Atkinson and the organization parted ways in March. Even Duffy didn’t know the gravity of the situation until Nash called him a few weeks ago.\n\n“This is something I’m serious about, what do you think?” Duffy recalled Nash asking.\n\n“Well, if you want to have a serene lifestyle I wouldn’t recommend this,” Duffy replied.\n\nAs stunned as Fraser and Duffy were to have Nash call them about coaching the Nets, neither is surprised to see him wind up on an NBA bench. Duffy compared Nash’s move to the coaching careers of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, two all-time greats who transitioned from being in control of the game on the court to conducting the players.\n\n“In my heart I always felt like (coaching)’s where he would end up,” Fraser said.\n\nMeeks likes to think Nash handled his retirement the way Kerr did. He tried a bunch of different hobbies, including broadcasting, before getting back into basketball.\n\n“It’s right at that sweet spot where he’s left the game and he’s got the itch to be competitive again,” Meeks said.\n\nOr as Duffy put it, “He had all these years to sit back and bask in the glory of being Steve Nash. Now he’s ready to get back out there.”\n\n(Top photo of Nash ahead of a Warriors game in 2018: Noah Graham / NBAE via Getty Images)"
