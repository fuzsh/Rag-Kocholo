        "text": "Steve Nash enjoyed one of the finer careers in basketball history, but he wants you to know that he’s moved on from that now. Nash has five children, ranging from three to 18 years old, which keeps him plenty busy. After his coaching tenure with the Brooklyn Nets came to an end in November 2022, Nash and his family stuck around, and they still reside in Cobble Hill. As he gets further and further removed from his life in the NBA and more involved in his children’s lives, Nash has found other ventures as well. The most recent—a collaboration with the apparel brand Legends on a clothing line that includes father-son matching outfits—was years in the making.\n\nAptly named Little Legends, the collection includes T-shirts, swim trunks, and athletic shorts for both children and adults. Nash has been involved with Legends in some capacity for a decade now, but he told GQ that he never really envisioned himself being a fashion guy. Knowing that his playing career spanned multiple eras—not just on the hardwood, but in clothing, as well—Nash has accepted that some of his old looks haven’t aged super well. But true to fatherly form, he’s more concerned with making sure the people in his life are happy than he is with looking hip.\n\nBefore celebrating Father’s Day with his gaggle of children, Nash got on Zoom to discuss fatherhood, clothes, and the 2006 club banger that he calls “a huge honor.”\n\nGQ Sports: How did this collaboration with Legends come together?\n\nNash: I invested in the brand maybe ten years ago. So, it’s been a long time, but I’m also just a fan of the brand and Scott [Hochstadt], who founded it. They do a great job of that crossover between function and fashion. Functional streetwear, as someone who is really active, is right up my alley. [smirks] I’m not up on all the terms. Functional streetwear came right off the top.\n\nI invested in Legends when it was just a sock company. They’ve just continued to add products, more sportswear, it’s been a fun journey to watch them grow from an early stage. They do a great job with the design and the aesthetic. I love how functional it is. It’s been a great investment for me.\n\nAre you particular about socks?\n\nI like socks. I wouldn’t say super particular at all, but I do like socks.\n\nAs a dad, do you take pride in having something like this that you can share with your kids?\n\nYeah, it’s cool! You also can, like, mix and match. We’re not totally twinning every day, although that’s fun too. I like that the pieces are pretty interchangeable. There’s playful colors for summer and all that stuff. It’s cool that we have some of the same pieces in our wardrobe, though. When I’m wearing them, he can be like, “You’re wearing our shorts!” It’s cool for dads to be able to connect with their kids in that way.\n\nWhat do your kids think of your fashion sense?\n\nUhh, I think they’d probably be like, “Meh.” You know? They probably think I’m just hanging in there. Some days are better than others, and there’s definitely some days where they’d say I could do better. I think they’d give me a passing grade, but certainly not with flying colors. I don’t think my daughters are wearing the latest garb for their age anyways, so I’m in the safe zone. I’m not exactly known for my fashion, but I’m not embarrassing!\n\nI assume being a dad is basically your full-time job at this point? Are there things you’ve started doing for the first time?\n\nYou know, I’ve always been a real hands-on dad. I really enjoy being a parent, obviously it’s the hardest job in the world, but I’ve always enjoyed it. We have a close-knit family. Nothing has really changed in that respect. I have a little more time, but I’m working hard every day as well. We’re on the go. But it’s a blessing to be at all my kids’ practices, take them to the school bus, pick them up, all that stuff. That’s been a reward as well.\n\nThat Cobble Hill school scene is competitive!\n\n[chuckles] My kids have really enjoyed it. New York is tough for schools, but we were lucky to get into a good school, which has been low stress. Other things are quite stressful! But the school situation has been good.\n\nWere you involved in the Little Legends design process?\n\nNot a lot. I was just excited that they were going to design a father-son line around Father’s Day. Scott asked if I wanted to be involved in some of the [marketing] material, that was a fun thing to do for me and my son. They talked to me about it pretty early. When I took a look at the stuff, I thought it was really cool, and it could be cool for fathers and sons to nerd out with some crossover outfits. Like I said, I love the brand and love to support it. When you have young kids, it’s always fun to have a playful part of your wardrobe and something you can share with your kids. I think it’s a great idea. I’m excited for it.\n\nPart of that marketing material was a Little Legends photoshoot with your son, Luca. How was that?\n\nHe’s at that age—five years old—where it’s like, “Okay, you ready? We’re gonna start shooting now.” Cheeeeeese. [laughing] He can’t produce a smile, he just produces some weird face. That made it hilarious.\n\nPart of the goal for this collection is “to give insight into your upbringing, how sports and childhood lessons shaped you, and what you’re passing down to the next generation.” Can you shed a little light on that? What was your relationship like with your father?\n\nMy dad had a huge impact on me. I had two great parents and was fortunate to grow up in a kind of idyllic house and community. My dad was really into sports, so he definitely helped foster that passion, especially the creative side of sports. That was his nature. He was a soccer player who definitely appreciated the subtleties. He really only coached us on behavior. Were we good teammates? Did we listen to our coach? Did we compete? I think he instilled really good values in us.\n\nMy mom was the same. She’s super competitive, but also was more interested in the way we behaved. It was a great upbringing. I think I learned a tremendous amount. I had a great support system in my parents, whether it was just observing the way they treated people, or the way they wanted us to approach things. There’s definitely that pressure not to humiliate the family name.\n\nDo you notice little bits of them in your own parenting style?\n\nI hope so. When I watch my kids play sports, I’m definitely less apt to be worried about the outcome than I am their effort and body language. That’s definitely rubbed off on me. Frankly, I think those values were really important pieces of me as a player. I wanted to make everyone feel comfortable and create a great environment.\n\nOne of my daughters is going to play volleyball in college. My 12-year-old son just picked up basketball. The little ones are kind of doing everything. The five-year-old is playing soccer, basketball, tennis, martial arts, seeing if he can develop a love for sports. My wife and I love sports, so we want them to be athletes, but we also understand that they don’t have to be. They can get involved in whatever they want, as long as they find something they’re passionate about.\n\nDo you ever have the urge to break out the old Phoenix highlights and show your kids how good you were?\n\nNot really. I like looking forward, I’m not averse to the past, but I’m busy living! I always want to learn, grow, and experience new things. That’s a part of my life that’s behind me now. I obviously feel proud about it, but it’s kind of…not important? That stage of my life is over. I want to constantly evolve and enjoy the rest of my life in a meaningful way.\n\nWhen you look back on some of those old outfits you wore during your career, what are your thoughts?\n\nThere’s definitely some horrific images out there. It was a different era of fashion, which always allows people to laugh at you later, but I’m seeing some of that stuff come back around now, some of it wasn’t even super fashionable at the time. I’ll see a certain silhouette that reminds me of back then, and it’s high fashion now! It’s always interesting to see the cycles. But, oh, for sure, there are some hideous pictures out there. It wasn’t just fashion choices, but also choices of stylists for photoshoots, my hair, I definitely have a greatest hits of fashion faux pas.\n\nSome of that stuff you were wearing in 2003 is what the kids think is cool now!\n\nIt might be. There’s still hideous photographs, though. We have to suffer our choices from years ago. I guess that’s part of being an aging father.\n\nWhat were your thoughts when you noticed NBA fashion start to blow up?\n\nI always had an appreciation for it, but I never wanted to get involved or become a participant, so to speak. I didn’t really like to stand out in that respect. But I like it—the whole world has become more fashionable. Manufacturing, optionality, being able to shop online, there’s just so much more choice now. When I started my career [in 1996], there were so few choices comparatively, not only for how to dress but also for how to acquire a wardrobe. Now it’s so easy! There’s so much choice and expressionism, it’s not even the same kind of world. My career went from that world into this new modern world. I was on my way out when guys really started trying new things fashion-wise.\n\nWere there any guys you played with whose fashion you admired?\n\nWell, one of my close friends I played with, Michael Finley, had a tailor and would wear a different suit for every game of the year. So professional and buttoned-up! Immaculate, right? Then there’d be me in jeans and a T-shirt, or sweats. I always respected his hustle, but I remember thinking, “Man, that’s a lot of extra work.”\n\nI loved Michael Finley. I remember vividly when you and him made a cameo in Like Mike.\n\nThat’s right!\n\nI have to ask this before we go. Do you remember where you were when you first heard Nelly Furtado name drop you in “Promiscuous”?\n\nMmm, I don’t remember where I was. But, you know, we grew up in the same neighborhood on the west coast of Canada! I didn’t know Nelly, she was about four years younger than me. I didn’t realize she was a fan of the game and was following my career. But I think it was a little home cooking, looking out for her compatriot. It was a huge honor to be in the song. We’re all super proud of her career. She seemingly came out of nowhere to global success. I feel a sense of pride that she was able to put me in such an iconic song.\n\nI’m guessing it was just someone asking me, “Hey, did you hear that new Nelly Furtado song? You’re in it!” Probably within that day I heard it, because that song was everywhere.\n\nIt truly was everywhere. That had to have an impact on your life.\n\nFor sure. My name was mostly in rap songs before that, but I think that’s because it rhymes with cash."
