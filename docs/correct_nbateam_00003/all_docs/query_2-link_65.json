        "text": "Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak said last week he hoped to hit a home run as he sought to improve the team’s roster after consecutive second-round playoff exits.\n\nHe certainly knocked one out of the park Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe Lakers acquired veteran point guard Steve Nash in a sign-and-trade deal with the Pacific Division rival Phoenix Suns and solved one of their most pressing needs over the past few seasons while giving up four draft picks and about $3 million in cash.\n\nRadio station KTAR 620-AM in Phoenix first reported the trade.\n\nThe picks will be first-rounders in 2013 and ’15 and second-round selections in 2013 and ’14. The 38-year-old Nash, a two-time NBA most valuable player, will make about $25 million over the next three seasons.\n\nThe Lakers can add Nash’s salary by slotting him under the salary cap by sending the Suns the $8.9 million trade exception they acquired from the Dallas Mavericks in the Lamar Odom deal last December.\n\nA Lakers spokesman did not immediately return phone calls seeking confirmation of the trade. The deal can’t be completed until July 11, when the NBA’s summer dead period is lifted and players can be traded officially and also sign new contracts.\n\n“After talking with (Suns owner) Robert (Sarver) and (president of basketball operations) Lon (Babby), we’ve agreed that it’s time for both of us to move in new directions,” Nash said in a statement released via ESPN.com.\n\n“I approached them and asked if they would be willing to do a sign and trade deal with L.A. because it is very important to me to stay near my children and family. They were very apprehensive and didn’t want to do it. Fortunately for me, they reconsidered.\n\n“They saw that they were able to get assets for their team that will make them better, assets they would not have otherwise had and it made sense for them to do a deal that helps their team get better.”\n\nNash, one of the league’s finest playmakers and a likely Hall of Fame selection upon retirement, joins a team that was in flux in Mike Brown’s first season as coach. Brown replaced Phil Jackson’s triangle offense with one more focused on low post play.\n\nNash averaged 12.5 points and 10.7 assists in 2011-12.\n\nThe Lakers thought they secured their point guard of the future when they acquired Ramon Sessions from the Cleveland Cavaliers and then dealt Derek Fisher to the Houston Rockets last March 15.\n\nSessions, however, opted out of his $4.55 million contract for next season to become an unrestricted free agent when the window opened last Saturday. It’s believed the Lakers have ended their attempts to re-sign Sessions.\n\nAs it stands today, Steve Blake will serve as Nash’s backup, with Kobe Bryant starting as the Lakers’ shooting guard, Metta World Peace at small forward, Pau Gasol at power forward and Andrew Bynum at center.\n\nIt’s also likely the Lakers will cease any attempts to trade Gasol, who figures to work extremely well with Nash. It remains unclear whether the Lakers will continue talks with the Orlando Magic on a Bynum-for-Dwight Howard swap, however.\n\nThe Lakers reportedly are one of a number of teams interested in trading for Howard. The Atlanta Hawks, Brooklyn Nets and Houston Rockets are said to be the others, with Howard earlier this week saying the Nets were his preferred destination.\n\nThe addition of Nash could make the Lakers more attractive to Howard.\n\nInitial reports indicated the Lakers were a longshot to acquire Nash.\n\nThe Toronto Raptors offered him $36 million over three seasons and recruited hockey great Wayne Gretzky to help lure Nash to his native Canada earlier in the week.\n\nWord leaked Wednesday that Nash would not be heading to the Great White North, however, and it was assumed the New York Knicks would have the inside track on acquiring him in a sign-and-trade deal, but that didn’t happen either.\n\nIt’s now possible veteran small forward Grant Hill, Nash’s former teammate with the Suns, could join him with the Lakers. Hill, 39, recently underwent the same knee procedure Bryant had last summer that allowed him to play with more explosiveness.\n\nNash and Hill are good friends off the court as well.\n\nThe Suns initially were believed to be unwilling to ship the face of their franchise for the past eight seasons to their hated rivals, the Lakers. Nash sounded equally skeptical when recently interviewed by a New York radio affiliate of ESPN.\n\n“The truth is I am a bit old-school,” Nash said. “I think for me it would hard to put on a Lakers jersey. That’s just what it is. You play against them so many times in the playoffs and I just use them as an example with the utmost respect fro them and their organization I think it was a Larry Bird-like he-wouldn’t-play-for-them-type of thing.\n\n“I kind of have that tendency. It is strange, but as a free agent, you are free to go wherever you want and I have to consider everything regardless of the past or future. You have to evaluate that moment.”\n\nNash and the Suns defeated Bryant and the Lakers in consecutive first-round playoff series in 2006 and ’07, with the Lakers then eliminating the Suns in six hard-fought games in the Western Conference finals in 2010.\n\nBryant reached out to Nash on Monday, according to a report on Yahoo! Sports and delivered a sales pitch he could not refuse."
