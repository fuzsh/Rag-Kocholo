        "text": "The Athletic's Shams Charania reported on Monday that the Toronto Raptors have met with NBA Hall of Famer and former Brooklyn Nets head coach Steve Nash to discuss their head coaching vacancy.\n\nNash owned a 94-67 record over two-plus seasons as head coach of the Nets between 2020 and 2022. The 49-year-old stepped away from the Nets just seven games into the 2022-23 season after a 2-5 start.\n\nNash's tenure in Brooklyn — his first experience as a head coach at any level of basketball — was rocky, having to strike a healthy balance between a superstar trio of Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and James Harden. Durant called for Nash to be fired in the previous offseason, while Irving missed significant chunks of time due to injuries and off-court issues.\n\nTaken with 15th overall pick of the 1996 NBA Draft, the Victoria, B.C., native played 1,217 NBA games over his 18-year career, appearing for the Phoenix Suns, Dallas Mavericks and Los Angeles Lakers. Nash won the NBA MVP award in back-to-back years in 2005 and 2006, was named to seven All-NBA teams and made eight NBA All-Star Games. He was also named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.\n\nNash never got the chance to play for Canada's only remaining NBA franchise, but almost signed for the Raptors in 2012 before a sign-and-trade sent him to the Lakers.\n\nToronto is knee-deep in its search for a new head coach after firing Nick Nurse in late April. The front office has reportedly cast a very wide net, interviewing candidates that range from long-time assistant Adrian Griffin, to reigning WNBA Coach of the Year Becky Hammon, to ESPN analyst and former NBA sharpshooter JJ Redick. Ime Udoka was also a prime candidate for the job before accepting an offer from the Houston Rockets instead."
