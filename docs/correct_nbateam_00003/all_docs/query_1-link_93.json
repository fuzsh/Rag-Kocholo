        "text": "Ben Simmons is about to have another NBA coach, after Steve Nash was fired from his position with the Brooklyn Nets just seven games into the season.\n\nDespite having the star power of former league MVP and two-time finals MVP Kevin Durant, plus offensive superstar Kyrie Irving and three-time All Star Simmons, the Nets have started the 2022-23 season with a 2-5 win-loss record.\n\nThey are fifth of five teams in their division, 12th of 15 in the eastern conference, and 25th of 30 teams across the league, prompting the Nets front office to shake things up.\n\n\"We both felt this was time,\" general manager Sean Marks said of the decision to axe Nash less than one-tenth of the way into his third season as head coach.\n\nAside from the on-court difficulties, the Nets' enigmatic superstars have caused them issues off it.\n\nIrving was accused of promoting anti-Semitic views after tweeting a link to a book and film titled Hebrews to Negroes: Wake Up Black America, which is reportedly littered with disinformation, including accusations of large numbers of Jewish people worshipping Satan.\n\nIrving has previously urged people to do their own research into whether the Earth is flat, and has also had to miss Brooklyn home games because of his refusal to get vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nIrving rejected claims of anti-Semitism and tweeted that he \"meant no disrespect to anyone's religious beliefs\", but he also said he was \"not going to stand down on anything I believe in\" after Nets owner Joe Tsai publicly condemned Irving for promoting the book.\n\nTsai alluded to the constant turbulence around the team in his statement thanking Nash.\n\n\"My admiration and respect for him grew over time as he brought hard work and positive attitude to our organisation every day, even in periods of exceptional storm surrounding the team,\" Tsai said.\n\nDurant reportedly called for Nash's head in the off-season, after the Nets won 92 of 154 regular-season games and failed to get out of the second round of the playoffs during his first two seasons.\n\nThe team traded disgruntled 2018 MVP James Harden for Simmons before the 2022 trade deadline, but he did not play a game for them until the start of this season.\n\nNash's schemes have been criticised as the Nets have struggled defensively throughout his tenure and often did not show the ball-moving style of play on offence that his Suns teams did during his playing years, instead relying on Durant, Irving or Harden to isolate.\n\nThere was some hope that Simmons's defensive prowess and pass-first mentality on offence could unlock the attacking potential of the team, but the team's floundering start to the year has not inspired confidence.\n\nIt was also hoped that Nash, one of the best passing and shooting point guards the league has seen, could help Simmons develop more options with ball in hand, which obviously will not happen now.\n\nThe Nets are elevating assistant Jacque Vaughn to interim head coach, making him the fourth mentor Simmons has had across two teams in less than five seasons on court.\n\nVaughn is not expected to take over the role full time, with suspended Boston coach Ime Udoka reportedly the frontrunner to become Simmons's fifth head coach.\n\nUdoka was a Brooklyn assistant under Nash before moving to Boston, but he is not with the Celtics this season because he was found to have violated team rules by having a relationship with a female staffer within the organisation.\n\nSimmons was coached by Brett Brown and Doc Rivers in Philadelphia."
