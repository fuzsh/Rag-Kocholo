        "text": "Even some of Steve Nash’s closest associates in the NBA, yes, even his employer for the past five years, had no idea what was about to happen until the moment Nash called to break the news, person to person.\n\nHall of Fame player, Hall of Fame surprise.\n\nIt does say something about the speed and discipline of Nash and the Brooklyn Nets that nobody — not the top reporters, not the gossiping agents, team executives or gadflies — saw this coming and the world didn’t get a glimmer of it until the Nets and Nash were ready to announce that he was signing on as Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving’s new coach.\n\n“I had no idea until yesterday afternoon and he called me just out of courtesy since he technically worked for us,” Steve Kerr said Thursday morning, about an hour after the Nash hire was announced. “He didn’t need to ask permission, obviously, but he just respectfully called me. And I think (Brooklyn GM) Sean Marks called Bob (Myers) last night, so he gave us the heads up. But I didn’t see it coming.\n\n“I think it’s great, though. It’s an incredible hire. And Sean Marks and Steve and I were all in Phoenix together. I was GM and Sean and Steve were both on the team and they were really, really tight. So that part I think is really, really important. That connection. So I’m happy for both of them.”\n\nOf course, Nash served as a player-development consultant with the Warriors for the past five seasons starting in 2015-16 after finishing his two-time NBA MVP career in 2014. One of the most vivid scenes of Durant’s time with the Warriors always featured Nash working with Durant after a practice or before a game, going through intricate and fluid drills with full concentration, often in slow motion.\n\nIt always looked like a form of basketball tai chi, two superstars trying to tap into some calmer, higher level of hoop consciousness together.\n\nAnd Nash’s connection to Durant — which was initiated when Durant started working out with Nash at the end of Nash’s Suns tenure — clearly is a huge part of why he wanted this new job and why Brooklyn wanted him.\n\n“There was an existing relationship before we even signed Kevin,” Kerr said. “And you can even look online, I wouldn’t call it a documentary, but some kind of TV show where he interviewed Kevin and you could tell they really hit it off in this interview. I think Kevin has great respect for Steve because he watched him growing up and then played against him late in Steve’s career. There’s an inherent respect. Mutual respect.”\n\nThe Durant-Nash relationship is so strong that Nash, then working for the Warriors, was one of the last people Durant consulted with before he made his fateful decision to leave the Oklahoma City Thunder and sign with the Warriors as a free agent in July 2016.\n\n“I trust his judgment on stuff,” Durant told me in January 2017. “He’s always kept it real with me. He wasn’t recruiting me or anything, he just let me know how it is here. …\n\n“I asked him how the guys would feel if I came here. He just said everybody’s selfless, no egos. … Well, everybody has to have a ego, but you know what I mean. Guys don’t really take themselves too seriously. I wouldn’t say he made the decision for me, but he made me feel good about it.”\n\nNash also worked with Stephen Curry over the last several years and Kerr noted that, with Durant gone and Curry hurt for most of last season, Nash worked with Jordan Poole, Ky Bowman and some other younger players last season.\n\n“His communication skills are off the charts because of his humility and confidence and his knowledge,” Kerr said. “He just has a really unique approach to training that he developed over the course of his career. And (current Warriors director of sports medicine and performance and longtime Nash associate) Rick Celebrini sort of developed their philosophy as they went, as Steve was playing and they kind of built this whole program together.\n\n“It’s all connected, the weight room and the training room and the court. And Steve is living proof of how important a program like that can be, where your body is really in tune with your mind, your balance, your coordination. You’re working on some things that maybe aren’t traditional basketball practices.\n\n“They did some really unique stuff. I’m sure you saw it at practice when Nashy would work with Steph or KD, some of the interesting stuff they’d do. He’s really got a sharp mind.”\n\nNash has no previous coaching experience but obviously has all those years playing at the highest level and a few years with the Warriors as a consultant. This isn’t the exact same way Kerr came into coaching, since he had three years as a GM before he started coaching the Warriors in 2014, but Kerr said he has no doubt that Nash will have little trouble as an NBA coach even without coming up through the assistant-coaching ranks.\n\n“Yeah, he’ll be fine,” Kerr said. “He knows the drill. He’s been in the league forever and he knows the game as well as anybody and he understands people. And I think he’s very wise, so he’ll hire a good staff. And everything that he needs to learn, he’ll learn quickly. It’ll happen so quickly for him just to get the rhythm and the feel and I’m sure he’ll hire a great staff to help him along.”\n\n(Photo: Noah Graham / NBAE via Getty Images)"
