        "text": "This is the second of a two-part feature for the 10th anniversary of the Suns' 62-20 team that reached the 2005 Western Conference finals and started a franchise revival.\n\nOn Nov. 3, 2004, the Suns' orange jerseys were not the only bright things being unveiled.\n\nThe Suns were about to change the NBA for the next decade and nary a hardwood soul saw it coming. The 2004 Suns preseason hinted at a franchise breakthrough but mixed opinions remained about whether adding 30-year-old Steve Nash made the Suns even a playoff team. That team, however, posted the third best one-year turnaround in NBA history (29-53 to 62-20), reached the Western Conference finals and became perhaps the Nash era's best team.\n\nA sleek big man, Amar'e Stoudemire, was versatile enough to pick-and-roll and pick-and-pop with Nash, the point guard conductor of a high-scoring symphony. Three traditional wings whizzed downcourt off opponents' made — and missed —shots, racing to the 3-point line or fast-break lanes to keep up with Nash's pace and passing. The mastermind, coach Mike D'Antoni, watched the Suns play \"small ball\" in the 1990s during the wee hours of his coaching years in Italy and installed a similar look during his first training camp as a NBA head coach.\n\nOn Nov. 3, 2004, opening night, the Suns made only 5 of 19 3-point shot attempts. Nash had only four assists.\n\nAnd the Suns won by 30 points.\n\nThen they won by 10, then 32, then 20 in the first week.\n\nOpponents were overwhelmed with shock and awe as the Suns rolled to a 31-4 start.\n\n\"It was as fun as hell,\" Nash said. \"It was a big surprise and a lot of fun. All of a sudden, you're a lap ahead. It's like, 'Wait a minute. We can't be this much better than the rest of the league.' You knew we had to come back to Earth but you're also thinking, 'Holy (expletive)!' It was like, 'Is this real?' We came into the season as nobodies as a team. Here we are, we could only beat ourselves halfway through the year.\"\n\n'Magical' start surprises\n\nRather than calling for the team to run plays during games, D'Antoni just ordered them to run. He gave a green light to shoot, instilling confidence across the lineup. But because they were playing differently, early success was essential to gain the players' trust.\n\n\"Otherwise, the noise around them would've beat them down and it would've been tough to convince Shawn (Marion) to play the four and Amar'e to play the five,\" D'Antoni said. \"During that 31-4 run, I remember walking into (Suns General Manager) Bryan Colangelo's office and sitting across from him and we just started laughing. 'Can you believe this?' We thought we could slip into the eighth spot.\n\n\"I remember standing at halftime with the coaches in the hall and going, 'We're up 20 every halftime. What are we going to tell them? Don't talk too much because we'll mess it up.' It was amazing. It exploded.\"\n\nD'Antoni experimented in the season's second game with starting rookie Jackson Vroman at center (\"Are you serious? I did that,\" D'Antoni said). Otherwise, he was putting the best five players on the floor for a frontline of Stoudemire, 6-foot-7 Marion and 6-6 Quentin Richardson.\n\nThe Suns ripped off a 20-1 stretch. Nash posted 18 assists in his first return to Dallas, the team that fueled his fire by not competing with Phoenix's free agency offer. Stoudemire, only 22 years old, had not scored 40 in an NBA game when he turned unstoppable for 50 and warned that it was \"the tip of the iceberg.\"\n\nBy Jan. 8, the Suns matched the previous season's win total.\n\n\"It was something magical,\" Stoudemire said. \"When you're playing in the moment, sometimes you don't realize how special that moment truly is until it's over. That was a time in the game of basketball when we were at an all-time high, not as the Phoenix Suns, but as individual players.\n\n\"Just that refuse-to-lose. Playing with such a free but competitive mentality. That was remarkable.\"\n\nMarion was in the prime of his career, using unique skills and pogo-stick hops to defend power forwards or point guards, make 3-pointers and rebound. Joe Johnson made a Suns-record 47.8 percent of his 3s and closed the season at an All-Star level. Richardson, with Nash, a key free-agent addition, epitomized the 3-for-all by trying 19 3s in a game — twice over four days — long before analytics told teams it was a wise shot.\n\n\"We had no expectations coming in,\" Richardson said. \"For us to come out like gangbusters, it was, 'OK, they're just having a hot start.' After so long, it was like, 'Oh, we're really killing everybody.' We were looking around like almost every fourth quarter we're getting iced up on our knees and it's a blowout.\"\n\nUnmatched chemistry\n\nIt was not just the winning and basketball that was enjoyable. The team clicked without cliques. In retrospect, many of the players and coaches said that it was hard to recapture that season's spirit, especially for Johnson and Richardson because it was their last Phoenix season.\n\n\"My best memory was the camaraderie we had,\" Johnson said. \"We all hung out off the court. We went out to eat. We went to each other's houses and played cards all the time. That was the first time I'd ever experienced something like that. We were a tight group.\n\n\"It was never the same. When I went to Atlanta, I was the old guy trying to show the young guys the way. It was so different. I blossomed into a different player but it was never the same. When you're on a great team like we had, you don't realize how good you've got it until you go elsewhere and it's not so easy.\"\n\nThe only bench regulars for the entire season were Leandro Barbosa, then 22, and center Steven Hunter. The Suns traded Casey Jacobsen and Vroman during the season to get Jim Jackson, a sign of how expectations were changing as the Suns also added veteran Walter McCarty.\n\n\"A lot of that chemistry was Steve,\" D'Antoni said. \"We'd lose a game and he'd stand up in the locker room and say, 'Guys I screwed up. I won't do it often but I did.' Taking responsibility. That's what a leader does and he was the best at it.\"\n\nThe Suns followed the 31-4 start with a six-game losing streak, mostly because of a Nash thigh injury. During the second half of the season, they lost consecutive games only once — thrilling fans who sold out Suns home games and helped set record TV ratings.\n\nThe Suns put Nash, Marion and Stoudemire in the All-Star Game and went from averaging 94.2 points the previous season to 110.4, the NBA's best clip in a decade. They took a NBA record 796 3-point attempts, which has been topped 13 times since then, including this season by each NBA Finals team. Stoudemire averaged 26 points. Nash averaged a league-high 11.5 assists with 15.5 points per game.\n\nPlayoff ready?\n\nQuestions dogged the Suns heading into the postseason with a franchise record-tying 62 wins, going 31-10 at home and away. Were they too inexperienced? Would their style work in the slower-tempo playoffs?\n\n\"We were going for broke from Day 1 to see how good we were and found ourselves in an unbelievable position,\" Nash said.\n\nThe Suns rolled Memphis in the first round, averaging 113.8 points after the Grizzlies had gone 2-2 by holding the Suns to 95.5 points per game during the regular season. That set up second-round revenge for Nash against Dallas, whose owner, Mark Cuban, had doubted his durability and offered $25 million less than Phoenix the prior summer.\n\nNash destroyed the Mavericks, closing the series with 48 points in Game 4 and a 34-point, 12-assist, 13-rebound performance in the closeout Game 5.\n\n\"Sometimes, I watch (Stephen) Curry and think, 'Oh my gosh, this guy is incredible,' but in that Dallas series, it was kind of similar,\" Nash said. \"It was obviously personal for me, not in a vindictive way, but in a pride way.\n\n\"Someone forwarded me a tweet about one of my stat lines from 10 years ago. At this stage of life, I'm like, 'Man, I used to do that? What?' You forget. Those types of nights happened quite a lot.\"\n\nWhat if?\n\nThat Dallas series also was the worst thing to happen to the Suns because Johnson suffered a displaced orbital fracture over his left eye in Game 2. Johnson was slamming on a breakaway when Jerry Stackhouse fouled him, causing a frightening face-first fall to the floor.\n\nBy the time Johnson could return while wearing a mask in the conference finals, San Antonio already had won Games 1 and 2 in Phoenix.\n\n\"We should've won it all that year,\" Marion said. \"If it wasn't for that (Johnson's injury), I think we would have.\"\n\nThe controversial suspensions to Stoudemire and Boris Diaw during the 2007 conference semifinals are the most cited bad breaks of that Suns era, but the Suns think Johnson's bad break was worse, especially to lose his defensive option on Tony Parker.\n\n\"There's no way you can tell me we wouldn't have been NBA champions if I hadn't got hurt,\" Johnson said.\n\nAfter 2005, two Suns starters returned because Stoudemire had microfracture knee surgery, Johnson had an ugly free agency departure to Atlanta and Richardson was traded to New York after a scoreless final Suns game.\n\n\"It got broken up prematurely,\" Richardson said.\n\n\"We should've fought harder to say this was special and not mess it up,\" D'Antoni said.\n\nThe Suns reached the conference finals in 2006 and again in 2010 but neither trip was as exhilarating as the original thrill ride of 10 years ago.\n\n\"Those were the good ol' days,\" Johnson said."
