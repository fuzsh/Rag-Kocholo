The subject of the book \"Long Shot: Steve Nash's Journey to the NBA,\" by Jeff Rudd. Excelled at lacrosse, soccer and hockey as a child. His father, John, and his brother, Martin, both played professional soccer in England.\n\nSteve Nash Profile pg 2\n\nName: Steven John Nash\n\nPostion: Point Guard\n\nNickname: Nasty (USA)\n\nBorn: 02/07/1974\n\nStatus: Active\n\nOrigin: Victoria, British Columbia, Canada\n\nHeight: 6-3/1m,91cm\n\nWeight: 195lbs./88,5kg.\n\nSchools: Santa Clara University (California)\n\nDrafted: 1996, 1st round, 15th pick by Suns\n\nLanguages: Canadian, English :)\n\nWebsite: SteveNash.net & InterBasket\n\nTeams (jersey): Canadian National Team (7), Santa Clara Broncos, Phoenix Suns (13), Dallas Mavericks (13), Phoenix Suns (13)\n\nIBN Notes: Who would have thought that that young Canadian Point Guard with the clean-cut hair sitting at the end of the Phoenix Suns' bench in the late 1990s, (behind Jason Kidd and Kevin Johnson) would return almost a decade later as a floppy-haired, finger-licking, herky-jerky floor leader, 2004-05 and 2005-06 NBA MVP? Me neither. He joins Magic Johnson, Bob Cousy, Allen Iverson, Oscar Robertson and Michael Jordan as the only guards to ever win the NBA MVP... and joins even a more elite group of players to have won MVP in consecutive years... amazing.\n\nIBN Facts: Prior to the 2005-06 NBA Season, Steve Nash was voted the league's best point guard in a survey of NBA General Managers, breaking Jason Kidd's four-year stranglehold on that title (since the beginning of the survey). Nash was voted the 2006 Interbasket NBA Player of the Year, as well as a member (and second-leading vote-getter) of the 2006 Interbasket All-World First Team along with Dirk Nowitzki, Kobe Bryant, Yao Ming, and Pau Gasol"
