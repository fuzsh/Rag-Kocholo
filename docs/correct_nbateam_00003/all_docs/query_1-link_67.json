        "text": "Steve Nash, the former Santa Clara star turned NBA Hall of Famer, was the surprise choice as the Brooklyn Nets’ new head coach, the team announced Thursday.\n\nNash, who has been a Warriors consultant since 2015, has never coached at any level despite reportedly being courted for coaching positions over the years. He signed a four-year contract with no terms being announced.\n\nNets general manager Sean Marks, a former Cal standout who was a teammate of Nash’s with Phoenix, was instrumental in helping convince the 46-year-old to coach the Nets.\n\n“I am honored to have this opportunity with such a first-class organization and would like to thank Sean, (owner Joe Tsai) and his wife, Clara, for having faith in my ability to lead this team forward,” Nash said in a statement released by the Nets. “Coaching is something I knew I wanted to pursue when the time was right, and I am humbled to be able to work with the outstanding group of players and staff we have here in Brooklyn.\n\n“I am as excited about the prospects of the team on the court as I am about moving to Brooklyn with my family and becoming impactful members of this community.”\n\nMarks said Nash is someone who shouldn’t have much trouble in his transition to coaching.\n\n“In Steve we see a leader, communicator and mentor who will garner the respect of our players,” Marks said in a statement. “I have had the privilege to know Steve for many years. One of the great on-court leaders in our game, I have witnessed firsthand his basketball acumen and selfless approach to prioritize team success. His instincts for the game, combined with an inherent ability to communicate with and unite players towards a common goal, will prepare us to compete at the highest levels of the league.”\n\nNash hopes to join Warriors coach Steve Kerr as a successful head coach despite going into the job with no experience, although three NBA titles may be tough to duplicate, even with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving in New York.\n\nPart of the allure of Nash for Brooklyn was his relationship with Durant, forged while they were both with the Warriors. Durant helped the Warriors win two titles before leaving for Brooklyn after last season. The 6-foot-10 Durant sat out this season after tearing his Achilles tendon with the Warriors in last year’s NBA Finals loss to Toronto.\n\nDurant credited Nash with being a big help to him while the two were with the Warriors.\n\n“He’s someone I can talk to about anything and somebody I really respect. His basketball mind is probably the best I’ve been around,” Durant told this organization in 2018. “He tries to simplify the game and keep me conscious of those things as well. It’s simplifying and keeping it as easy for yourself. I’ve learned so much. So many people taught me how to play. He’s continued to teach me different things I can put in my game. I’m very grateful for him and happy for him.”\n\nNash spent time with the Warriors during this past 15-50 season, and attended a handful of practices to coach fellow-Canadian Andrew Wiggins after the 25-year-old forward was acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves at the February trade deadline.\n\n“Congratulations to Steve Nash and thank you for all your work over the years with the Warriors,” Kerr tweeted. “You are going to crush it in Brooklyn!”\n\nNash is the third member of the Warriors organization to leave for an NBA head coaching job in the past five seasons, following former assistant coaches Alvin Gentry (Pelicans) and Luke Walton (Lakers, Kings).\n\nBrooklyn also announced that Jacque Vaughn, who served as the Nets head coach since taking over in February for the fired Kenny Atkinson, will remain as Nash’s lead assistant coach.\n\nNash, who went to high school in Victoria, British Columbia, began his basketball career in the United States at Santa Clara in 1992. He would win two West Coast Conference Player of the Year awards but he first helped put the Broncos on the map in 1993 when they upset second-seeded Arizona in the first round of the NCAA tournament.\n\nThe dazzling point guard was even better in the NBA, where he was an eight-time All-Star and a two-time Most Valuable Player with the Suns in 2005 and 2006.\n\nWarriors beat reporter Wes Goldberg contributed to this report."
