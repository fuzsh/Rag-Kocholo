        "text": "The list of former Phoenix Suns players in the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame isn’t long. It consists of six names, and three of those players burnished their credentials elsewhere.\n\nThe threesome of Shaquille O’Neal, Dennis Johnson and Gus Johnson, who played all of one season (1972-73) for Phoenix, is joined by Charles Barkley, Gail Goodrich and Connie Hawkins as the only former Suns players to receive basketball’s highest honor.\n\nThat list could increase by 50 percent, however, when the 2018 Hall of Fame Class is announced Saturday during Final Four weekend in San Antonio. Three former Suns – Steve Nash, Grant Hill and Jason Kidd – are finalists, along with former NBA players Maurice Cheeks and Chris Webber; former men’s college coach Lefty Driesell; former NBA referee Hugh Evans; former college and WNBA stars Tina Thompson and Katie Smith; former NBA coach Rudy Tomjanovich; Baylor women’s coach Kim Mulkey; and the 1956-58 Wayland Baptist University women’s basketball teams.\n\nThe 24-person Hall of Fame honor committee will vote on the finalists; 18 of 24 votes are required for induction.\n\n“This is a really good class from top to bottom,” Hall of Fame chairman Jerry Colangelo said. “When you look at this depth there are going to be very difficult decisions made.”\n\nSteve Nash\n\nNash’s credentials are impeccable. He won back-to-back Most Valuable Player awards while with the Suns (2004-05, 2005-06), becoming, along with Magic Johnson, the only point guards to win multiple MVP awards.\n\nHe led the NBA in assists five seasons and ranks as one of the top 10 players in league history in total assists, assists per game and 3-point field goals made. Finally, Nash and Larry Bird are the only players to have multiple seasons in which they shot better than 50 percent from the field, 40 percent from 3-point range and 90 percent from the free-throw line.\n\nAnd to think, Santa Clara was the only school to offer Nash a scholarship out of high school.\n\nSuns interim coach Jay Triano, who was Nash’s coach on the Canadian National team, credits Nash’s uncompromising work ethic for his unlikely rise.\n\n“We were practicing at the old Vancouver Grizzlies facility in 1999, we finished practice and we were on our way back to the hotel and everyone is on the bus and we’re like, ‘We don’t have everybody,’ ” Triano recalled. “This was like the first practice and we’re like, ‘Who are we missing? Let’s go.’\n\n“The managers take roll and it’s Nash. I said, ‘Well, go find him.’ The manager goes back to the gym, comes out and says, ‘He’s still shooting.’ So we waited. We waited 45 minutes for him to finish shooting. The next day we couldn’t get anybody on the bus. They all stayed and waited until he left. It kind of changed the whole thing with Team Canada as far as what it took to be great and it taught the young players that weren’t NBA players, ‘This is what it takes.’ ”\n\nMike D’Antoni’s “Seven Seconds or Less” offense, with Nash as the conductor, is widely credited for the up-tempo, small-ball, 3-point shooting offense that has revolutionized the NBA. But Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr, who was the Suns’ general manager from 2007-10, said Nash forever changed the way point guards play.\n\n“You’re seeing these young guys coming up who have been inspired by Nash, by the spread pick-and-roll stuff, by being dual threats, with the ability to shoot from 3 and penetrate and find people,” Kerr said. “Sometimes in our locker room we call Steph (Curry) ‘Steve Nash on steroids.’ &mldr; Steve is a consultant with us and he kind of laughs and he agrees with us.\n\n“Steve kind of set the bar for a lot of these guys and it’s remarkable to think about his influence.”\n\nGrant Hill\n\nHill was 35 years old when he signed with the Suns before the 2007-08 season. His career, which started spectacularly in Detroit, had been derailed by ankle and groin injuries. But Jared Dudley, who joined Phoenix the following season, doesn’t remember playing with an old, battered athlete who had seen his best days.\n\n“People don’t realize it but he was the fastest and most athletic player we had here on the roster,” Dudley said of Hill, who played 362 games in five seasons with the Suns.\n\nHill averaged 16.7 points, six rebounds and 4.1 assists per game over 18 NBA seasons. He was a seven-time All-Star and an all-NBA first team selection in 2007. In his six seasons with Detroit, he was one of the league’s better players, averaging 21.9 points, 7.6 rebounds and 6.3 assists per game.\n\n“The sky was the limit with him,” Dudley said. “He and Penny (Hardaway) were once-in-a-generation-type players. I think he was someone who would have helped changed the game. Maybe not someone of LeBron's stature, but he was perfect for how the game was transitioning. He could cover one through four, he could play a stretch four offensively and dominate. He was getting ready to be a 10- to 12-time All-Star.”\n\nHill, of course, isn’t a finalist based solely on his NBA career. He was a two-time NCAA champion at Duke and part of arguably the most famous play in college basketball history: his 75-foot pass to Christian Laettner with Duke down 103-102 with 2.1 seconds left in the 1992 NCAA regional final against Kentucky.\n\n“That play captures and embodies the spirit of the tournament,” Hill told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution last year, on the 25-year anniversary of the play. “Buzzer-beater. Tight game. Extreme celebration on one hand. Total misery and dejection on the other. The generation following that play, it’s become the iconic moment. I’m so overwhelmed that it connects and resonates with fans.”\n\nJason Kidd\n\nThe five seasons Kidd played for the Suns – 1996-97 through 2000-01 – weren’t particularly fruitful as Phoenix lost in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs four of the five years.\n\nBut they served as a precursor for a 21-year career that included two NBA Finals appearances with the New Jersey Nets and, at the age of 38, an NBA championship with the Dallas Mavericks in 2011.\n\nKidd still ranks third all-time in triple-doubles with 107 – only Oscar Robertson and Magic Johnson have more – and he ranks second in NBA history in assists and steals.\n\nKidd’s athletic prowess was accompanied by an insatiable desire for knowledge, which was used as a weapon on the court. In 2008, U.S. Olympic coach Mike Krzyzewski asked Triano to join the team as an assistant so he could help the coaching staff and players better understand the international game.\n\nNo one paid attention so closely as Kidd.\n\n“They asked me to come in and speak,” Tirano said. \"When I went in to do that Jason Kidd was like, ‘Don’t hold back on this stuff. We need to learn. We’re the best basketball players in the world but we’re not the best international players in the world right now. And we want to be that.’\n\n“He was the kind of sounding board for Coach K and a guy who was an extension of him, I thought.”\n\nSuns center Tyson Chandler, a teammate of Kidd’s on the Mavericks championship team, called Kidd “one of the best basketball players I’ve ever played with in my life.”\n\n“He had a brilliant, brilliant mind,” Chandler added. “One of the smartest basketball players I’ve ever known. Fierce competitor. Leader. He was a coach on the sidelines before he was a coach.”\n\nChandler remains amazed that Kidd, at the age of 38, was covering James and/or Miami’s Dwyane Wade in that NBA Finals.\n\n“For him to be able to do that, to guard the young studs?” Chandler said. “To me, that says a lot.”\n\nPhoenix Suns at 50: Steve Nash-Jason Kidd duel was one for the memory books\n\nQ&A with Grant Hill: Final Four, Phoenix Suns and more\n\nSuns coach candidates: Jason Kidd among a handful of possibilities\n\nMonday's game\n\nCeltics at Suns\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Talking Stick Resort Arena.\n\nTV/radio: FSAZ/KTAR 98.7 FM."
