        "text": "The Phoenix Suns franchise has had many playoff runs throughout its history. They have been thorns in the side for many Western Conference teams for almost every decade in their existence. Historically, players like Steve Nash, Charles Barkley, and Amar’e Stoudemire only help push this franchise to the top of the West. Although the team has struggled to make it deep into the playoffs, they have made two appearances in the NBA Finals. In 1975-76, led by Rookie of the Year, Alvan Adams, Paul Westphal, and Pat Riley at point guard, now GM of the Miami Heat. This team lost to the Boston Celtics. They made another run in 1992-93, led by Barkley only to be caught by the buzzsaw of the ’90s, the Chicago Bulls.\n\nAll-Time Phoenix Suns\n\nStarting Five\n\nPoint Guard – Steve Nash\n\nNash is often the player that comes to mind first when thinking of the Suns. His style of play, the way he runs an offense, and the genuine fun he had on the court made him a must-watch anytime he touched the ball. His play flourished in his “Seven Seconds or Less” offense, by head coach Mike D’Antoni. Which led him to be the Most Valuable Player in back-to-back years, 2004-05 and 2005-06.\n\nHe was originally drafted by the Suns, who traded him two years later to the Dallas Mavericks. When the 2003-04 free agency started, Nash signed back with the Suns. He is third all-time in assist. He led the league for 6 of 8 seasons he was in a Suns uniform. The 2005-06 season was his best statistical season. His percentage of ”50-40-90” was amazing. 50 percent from the field, 40 from the three-point line, and 90 from the free-throw line.\n\nShooting Guard – Devin Booker\n\nDevin Booker is one of the up and coming shooting guards in the NBA today. His shot and determination to get the ball in the hoop are outstanding. He has literally taken his team and put them on his back to win games. The Suns haven’t won much with Booker in the lineup, that shouldn’t deter his standing of being the best shooting guard ever in a Suns’ uniform.\n\nBeing drafted out of the University of Kentucky, he was 13th in the 2015 draft. He’s averaged 21.4 points per game, 3.5 rebounds, and 4.2 assists over his short career. Booker has had some impressive point totals in two separate seasons. He put up 70 points, in a loss, to the Boston Celtics on March 24, 2017. The next year, 59 against the Utah Jazz, in a loss, on March 25, 2019.\n\nSmall Forward – Shawn Marion\n\nIf there was a list of the ugliest jump shots, Shawn Marion would be near the top! Being a starter for most of his Suns career led to his ability to work with Nash. He was the third option for most of the ’00s on the Suns’ roster. Although he never won a title with the Suns. Marion was a four-time All-Star and rebounding machine the Suns needed during those playoff runs.\n\nPower Forward – Charles Barkley\n\nEven though, Barkley only played for the Suns for four seasons. It was some of his most dominate years in Barkley’s career. His first season there, the Suns had an amazing league record of 62-20. Barkley led the team with 25.6 points per game that season. He would also finish that season as the league’s Most Valuable Player.\n\nThroughout his career, Barkley was one of the best players on the court. His competition always had better accolades and the Chicago Bulls dominated most of the prime of his career. However, the four years in Phoenix was his best scoring seasons. He only made it to the Finals the one time with the Suns.\n\nCenter – Amar’e Stoudamire\n\nStoudamire had the fortune of being drafted to the right team, at the right time. Having Stephon Marbury and Nash as your point guard is a gift from the NBA gods. One of the best pick-and-roll tandems in league history, Stoudamire and Nash were able to freeze defenses and take advantage. In the “Seven Seconds or Less” offense, they wouldn’t let the defense even set before they did their damage.\n\nStoudamire was a six-time All-Star, five of those were with the Suns. He was the 2002-03 Rookie of the Year. His stats were 21.4 points and 8.9 rebounds over his career in Phoenix. His game was perfect for his era. He wasn’t a stretch five by any means. He was able to bring out the center and let his team slash to the basket. If the defender sluffed off of him, Stoudamire could bury a 15-foot jump shot.\n\nBackups\n\nPoint Guard – Kevin Johnson\n\nKevin Johnson is one of the most underrated point guards in NBA history. After being drafted to the Cleveland Cavaliers, he was traded to the Suns in his rookie year. He was one of the most explosive players, he also was the most injury-prone. In the 1992-93 season, he was plagued with a hernia injury. He missed most of the first season Barkley was there.\n\nJohnson averaged 18.7 points and 9.5 assists per game. The injuries cut his career short. He only played 82 games once in his career, his rookie year. Three-point shooting was not is his bag of tricks, averaging one a game. Slashing and passing was the main part of his game. He won the Most Improved Player in the 1988-89 season. Johnson also had one of the nastiest posters ever, on Hakeem Olajuwon.\n\nShooting Guard – Jeff Hornacek\n\nJeff Hornacek’s best season may not be his year in Phoenix, he was still one of the best sharpshooters in a Suns uniform. The future coach had a great statistical line for his years in a Suns’ uniform. During his stint in Phoenix, Hornacek averaged 51 percent from the field, 39 percent from three-point land, and 85 percent from the free point line.\n\nFor six of the eight seasons, Hornacek was the starting shooting guard with a great explosive point guard (Johnson) next to him. Hornacek’s career was always defined by the point guards he played with. His career with the Suns ended when he was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers in a package that included Barkley coming to the Suns.\n\nSmall Forward – Grant Hill\n\nGrant Hill was one of the most promising players in NBA history coming out of Duke. When he was drafted to the Detroit Pistons, they thought they were going to be getting one of the best small forwards in the league for the next 15 years, injuries derailed him.\n\nAfter his stints with Detriot and the Orlando Magic. He had his most productive seasons in the NBA with the Suns. Hill also was also able to stay on the court. Playing with Nash and Stoudamire, Hil was able to be the third option on some very fast teams. His career shooting line for the Suns was 49/35/82. In his last season, injuries derailed his season and he wasn’t able to overcome them. He retired a year later.\n\nPower Forward – Larry Nance\n\nLarry Nance was a defensive juggernaut in his first couple of years out of Clemson. Nance made the All-NBA Defensive team three times in his first four seasons. He averaged 2 blocks a game and pulled down 8 rebounds a game.\n\nWhile people may think the name seems familiar. He is the father to Larry Nance Jr. Watching Nance Jr. is a shell of his dad’s play-style. Nance has the length and ability to attack the rim. Nance career with the Suns ended when he was traded in a package to Cleveland that brought back picks. They used one of those picks to draft Johnson.\n\nCenter – Alvan Adams\n\nAdams was drafted fourth overall in the 1975 season. Coming from Oklahoma, Adams was a dominant force in the frontcourt. That season, he would go on to win Rookie of the Year, almost unanimously. Using all 6’9”, Adams was able to hold down the center of the paint.\n\nWith 988 career games, all with the Suns, he was a 14 point, 7 rebound player. He was the starting center for the first eight years. James Edwards was brought in to start and moved Adams to the bench. His minutes may have gone down, but his production stayed the same. His last season in the league was the 1987-88 season."
