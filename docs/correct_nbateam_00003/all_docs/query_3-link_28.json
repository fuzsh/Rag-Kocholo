        "text": "Bart GadburyContributor III\n\nPhoenix Suns: Nicknames for the NBA's Best Point Guard Steve Nash\n\n0 of 7\n\nSteve Nash isn't the most athletic person on the court. He's not the tallest, strongest, fastest or even best looking. But enough about what Steve isn't.\n\nLet's talk about what he is.\n\nPlease fill in the blank with words or phrases to complete this sentence: \"Steve Nash is _________.\"\n\nThe hardest working. The most consistent. Automatic. The toughest. The most creative. Absolutely brilliant.\n\nNash is a lot of things to a lot of people. But everyone knows him as plain old \"Steve Nash.\"\n\nEvery good basketball player needs a good nickname. But how do you condense all that is Steve Nash into a singular name? Those words/phrases above just don't do him justice. He's more than \"all that and a bag of chips.\"\n\nOf all the things that Steve has been called in his life, these are our favorites.\n\nCaptain Canada\n\n1 of 7\n\nJasper Juinen/Getty Images\n\nThe most famous Canadian to ever come out of the Great White North, Steve Nash is more popular than Wayne Gretzky or the Queen. 1) Who watches hockey, anyways? 2) Who?\n\nIn 2007, Nash received the Order of Canada. In 2008, Steve was awarded a star on Canada's Walk of Fame. (I'm not sure what those things are, but hey...let Canada do stuff.)\n\nDuring the Winter Olympics held in Vancouver in 2010, Steve Nash became the first NBA player to carry the torch and light the cauldron.\n\nSteve is also a part owner of the Vancouver Whitecaps FC, which became an MLS expansion team located in Vancouver in 2011.\n\nThat's all not to mention the countless charities, foundations and donations given from Steve to those in need.\n\nI'm sure Canada wouldn't mind if we changed their Royal Anthem to \"God Save the Steve.\" Oh yeah, they don't know this...but we already did that. We're America. We do what we want.\n\nOther related nicknames: Kid Canada, Nashional Treasure\n\nNashty\n\n2 of 7\n\nNo blood, no foul...right?\n\nWith under three minutes left in the fourth quarter of Game 1 of the 2007 Western Conference semifinals, Steve Nash and Tony Parker collided. Parker collapsed to the ground and Nash stood on the court, unsure of what had happened.\n\nThen the blood started flowing.\n\nAfter several minutes of failed attempts to stop the bleeding, Nash entered the game with a bandaged nose, blood still squirting out the edges.\n\nHe nailed one of his patented pull-up three-pointers, then drove to the basket for a right-handed layup. He was single-handedly keeping his team in the game.\n\nThe bandages couldn't stop the blood. The blood couldn't stop Steve Nash. But Nash couldn't stop the Spurs.\n\nEven though the Suns lost, Nash showed the toughness and grittiness that made him a two-time MVP.\n\nOther related nicknames: Nash Bridges, Nash's Bridge\n\nMVSteve\n\n3 of 7\n\nSteve won two straight Most Valuable Player awards. He probably deserved a third.\n\nSteve Nash was selected as the NBA's MVP in 2005 and 2006. He finished second in 2007 behind Dallas’ Dirk Nowitzki. He is now talked about in the same breath as the greatest point guards of all-time with Magic Johnson, Bob Cousy and Oscar Robertson.\n\nIn 2005, Nash led the Phoenix Suns to 62 wins, most in the NBA. Nash averaged 11.5 assists per game while making 50.2% of his field goals and 43.1% of his three-pointers in the regular season. He edged Shaquille O'Neal to win the 2004–05 NBA MVP award, becoming the first Canadian to earn the honor, as well as the third point guard ever to be named MVP.\n\nIn 2006, the Suns lost Amare Stoudemire to injury and traded away Joe Johnson and Quentin Richardson. Having recorded career highs in points (18.8), rebounds (4.2), field goal percentage (.512) and free-throw percentage (a league-leading .921), and leading the league with 10.5 assists per game, Nash was named the league MVP for the second year in a row.\n\nSteve joined elite company when he won consecutive MVP awards. Others are: Tim Duncan, Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Moses Malone, Kareem-Abdul Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Russell. Karl Malone and Bob Pettit also won it twice, but not in consecutive years.\n\nOther related nicknames: Two-Time\n\nMp3\n\n4 of 7\n\n\"I can't understand what you're saying...you're speaking in Canada.\"\n\nJust as mp3s revolutionized the music industry, Mp3 revolutionized the game of basketball.\n\nSteve Nash brought flair and excitement to the NBA with his no-look, behind-the-back passes and pull-up three pointers and he made the Phoenix Suns the most entertaining team to watch.\n\nBut fans aren't the only one's who enjoy watching Steve on the basketball court. The entertainment business is fascinated with the two-time MVP. They consider him as being his own medium.\n\nIn fact, Steve has joined music and movies as the most enjoyed media of today.\n\nOther related nicknames: Crosby, Stills and Steve Nash, PG-13\n\nNash Gash\n\n5 of 7\n\nFacing their arch-nemesis, the San Antonio Spurs, in the second round of the 2010 playoffs and holding a 3-0 series lead, the Suns knew it would take something special to sweep. Something incredible. Something amazing.\n\nSomething Nashty.\n\nAfter getting elbowed in the eye in the third quarter, Nash returned in the fourth with his right eye swollen shut. He went on to score 10 points, dished five assists and killed multiple Spurs rallies with one-eyed runners and literal no-look passes.\n\nThis is one of the most impressive playoff performances in recent memory. Just watch the video.\n\nOther related nicknames: One-eyed Stevie Wonder\n\nHair Canada\n\n6 of 7\n\nMore from BleacherReport\n\n7 of 7\n\nChristian Petersen/Getty Images\n\nTell us which nickname you like best!
