        "text": "March Madness is one of the greatest sporting events of the year, but despite the late-game drama and radical upsets of the NCAA Men's College Basketball Tournament, the pageant makes a NBA fan appreciative of the level of play at the pros. The average NBA game, assuming it's not one between, say, the Toronto Raptors and the Sacramento Kings, features fewer scoring droughts, smarter plays and an exponentially higher level of athletic competition. Also, NBA players tend to be paid more than their college equivalents (depending on the particular school of course). With that in mind, here's what was happening while your brackets devolved into birdcage lining.\n\n1. The trade deadline was boringly eventful\n\nMarch 15 came and went, and, behold, Dwight Howard remained with the Orlando Magic. In fact, after countless changes of heart, Howard also eventually agreed to not exercise the opt-out of his contract that would make him a free agent this summer. As feared, this means that next deadline, trade talk speculation might loom again around the Orlando center and he could subject us all to The Indecision Round II. This year they almost gave Dwight Howard full rights to fire the manager if he agreed to stay, I assume next go-around, they will give him the opportunity to be Orlando's mayor for life. In any case, better luck next year to the soon-to-be Brooklyn Nets.\n\nNow just because Dwight Howard ended up remaining with his team, as did the Boston Celtics' Rajon Rondo and the Los Angeles Lakers' Pau Gasol, doesn't mean that the trade deadline was completely uneventful. Here we'll list some of the more impactful deals that came in before the 3PM deadline. Although none of these moves were blockbusters, or even block-nudgers, they do hint at the future of their respective clubs.\n\nIn a season where several of their players broke down on their watch, it's no surprise that the Portland Trail Blazers decided it was time to break down the team itself. The Blazers parted ways with Gerald Wallace (who went to the New Jersey Nets) and Marcus Camby (shipped to the Houston Rockets). The Blazers also cut team mascot Greg Oden, whose ability to look fantastic while wearing a suit on the sidelines will always be a lasting memory for Portland basketball fans.\n\nThe Washington Wizards traded way JaVale McGee (the Human Lowlight Reel) in a deal to get power forward Nenê and his hefty contract from the Denver Nuggets.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers shipped off long time mainstay Derek Fisher, trading him to the Houston Rockets (who promptly waived the veteran), leaving Kobe Bryant to find another best friend on the team who will never visit his house. The Lakers also traded Jason Kapono, Luke Walton and a first-round pick to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Ramon Sessions, Christian Eyenga and the Relief of Not Carrying Luke Walton on the Roster Anymore.\n\nIn a fairly badass move, the Oklahoma City Thunder did absolutely nothing on the deadline because they believed they had the roster to win it all this year. At least the Thunder believed this until Wednesday, when they picked up the waived Derek Fisher (which, in some technical sense of the word, counts as something more than \"nothing\").\n\nIn the words of Jason Kirk of SB Nation, the Atlanta Hawks made the most Atlanta Hawks trade ever.\n\nOkay, so it wasn't the most exciting trade deadline for all but diehard NBA fans, in the end the biggest move that happened near the deadline involved a coach (the Knicks' Mike D'Antoni). Still, it will be interesting to see how the Portland Trail Blazers rebuild or what exactly the Wizards are trying to accomplish with a core of John Wall and Nenê. Well, at least marginally interesting.\n\n2. An open letter to NYC regarding Tim Tebow and Jeremy Lin\n\nDear New York City,\n\nI know that I've spent a lot of time making fun of your sports teams in the past, but since I just visited you and had quite a good time, I decided to return the favor and help out two of your teams. I just learned that the Denver Broncos have traded young quarterback Tim Tebow to your Jets, and was somewhat confused: Don't the Jets already have a better lousy quarterback who can somehow pull off fourth quarter victories in Mark Sanchez? This seems like a bit of an overlap.\n\nIt sounds like I'm knocking one of your teams again, New York City, but it's not like that. I'm just saying that this is why the New York Jets, who are used to missing out on the playoffs by one or two games, should use Tim Tebow as a trading chip to get someone who has been proven to provide a much needed temporary spark for a few games. Obviously I'm referring to New York Knicks' point guard Jeremy Lin.\n\nNow the rules don't officially allow trades between the NBA and the NFL, but I'm not entirely sure that they explicitly disallow it. Whatever, I'm sure something can be worked out underneath the table. It would be a win-win for both of the leagues: The NFL would spread its brand to China/Taiwan and the NBA would spread its brand to devout Americans turned off by the NBA's \"urban\" appeal.\n\nAs far as the teams involved go? Well, Jeremy Lin certainly would have a better completion ratio than Tebow, even if he doesn't have his deep ball. Yes, Lin's tendency to turn over the ball in the NBA could carry over into the NFL, but the Jets are already okay with Sanchez's interception rates, Lin couldn't be much worse. Meanwhile, Tebow could provide the Knicks with the high-quality leadership the team needs to keep Carmelo Anthony and Amar'e Stoudemire on the same page, or at least in the same section of the library.\n\nAs far as drawbacks, I will admit this: Despite his obvious leadership qualities, I'm not sure if Tim Tebow is a natural point guard, he seems to be more of a forward quite honestly. Would he be open for a position change? Just think my proposal over for a bit.\n\nSincerely,\n\nHunter Felt\n\nP.S. – If Tebow to the Knicks doesn't work out, the New York Mets are certainly looking to dump outfielder Jason Bay's salary and Tebow is cheaper. (Save that idea until the baseball season - ed)\n\n3. The Suns rise in the West\n\nThe \"Free Steve Nash\" moment has hit a snag, namely that, out of nowhere, the Phoenix Suns are (as of this writing) just two games out of a playoff spot. When it seemed that Steve Nash, accompanied by fellow elder statesman Grant Hill, was doomed to play out the end of his career for a fading former contender, fans and media commentators alike were openly hoping that the loyal Nash would demand a trade to a playoff team or that the Suns ownership were able to grow the stones to take the PR hit and actively shop him themselves. Instead Nash and the Suns stayed together and the Suns are this close to one more shot at playoff glory.\n\nSteve Nash is a first ballot Hall of Famer, one of the most enjoyable players to watch in modern times, as well as a model citizen off the court. The worst that can be said about Nash is that he's too preachy about nutrition. Couple that with the fact that he probably has about two years left of above-average play and provides the leadership intangibles that NBA coaches drool over, it's no wonder that other teams covet Steve Nash even during his twilight campaign.\n\nPart of the \"Free Steve Nash\" movement is the not-so-secret desire for fans to see him on their postseason-bound team.\n\nGrant Hill is also an easy player to root for. The former Pistons forward was one of the best players of the '90s, and the greatest Sprite pitchman who ever lived, until his HOF-bound career was seemingly ended by a non-stop barrage of injuries. After making a comeback in his late thirties, Hill has revealed few regrets about how his career has turned out: \"If I had played those years\", he told Dan Patrick, \"I would have [lost the desire]… I still have that itch and I'm running around after guys half my age.\" With these two likeable veterans at their core, this Suns team is difficult to root against, unless you're a San Antonio Spurs fan.\n\n4. Kobe Bryant has been having a rough few days\n\nOn Sunday, Los Angeles Lakers superstar Kobe Bryant had a bad night. As often happens when Kobe has a bad night, the Lakers lost, this time to the Utah Jazz to the tune of 103-99. The Lakers losing is not news, but the Lakers losing due to a 3-20 shooting performance by Kobe Bryant, the league's scoring leader, is worrisome. The Lakers went on to lose their next game, against the Houston Rockets who overcame a late 12 point deficit to steal a 107-104 win.\n\nGet ready to hear the rumors, I'm sure they're already out there, that Bryant is still adjusting to the loss of longtime teammate Derek Fisher. When guard Ramon Sessions, basically Fisher's replacement, began taking over the game late, scoring on four straight possessions, Bryant responded by going into \"game takeover\" mode. The move backfired on the Lakers, as Bryant ended up missing three straight shots and allowing a steal during two minutes of game time, effectively handing Houston the victory.\n\nKeep in mind that these back to back losses came after a five game winning streak and nobody, not even his biggest critics, expect Kobe's scoring to be a long-term problem. Kobe Bryant's attitude towards his team, on the other hand, is always a major wild card when it comes to the success of the Lakers. The Lakers have a slim enough opportunity to reach the NBA Finals this year as it is, the team doesn't need another burst of Kobe petulance. Previous Lakers teams have risen above this sort of drama to make championship runs, but those teams were better run and younger than this older team adapting to a new coach in Mike Brown. Right now the Lakers are more equipped to shop a reality show than win a title.\n\n5. Other things we've learned\n\nAn article by Sports Illustrated sheds some light in Antoine Walker's depressing attempt to return to the big leagues.\n\nBlake Griffin continues to be a goldmine for viral video. First he memorably airballs two straight free throw attempts and then, a week later, he knocks over a fan's concessions. The Los Angeles Clippers need to seriously look into drafting Michigan State's Draymond Green just to clean up after their star forward.\n\n* The Golden State Warriors fanbase really doesn't like their owner. I mean really doesn't. Monta Ellis has a posse it seems.\n\nThe Memphis Grizzlies have signed former Washington Wizard Gilbert Arenas, presumably he will primarily be used as a shooting guard. No, I will never stop using this gag until Arenas is out of basketball.\n\nThis is my vote for Dunk of the Week, courtesy of the New jersey Nets' Deron Williams, although feel free to nominate your own favorite in the comments below."
