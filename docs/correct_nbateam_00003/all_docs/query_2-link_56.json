        "text": "When you think about the odds, the “Steve Nash story” probably shouldn’t have ever happened.\n\nHonestly, it’s mind-blowing. A skinny Canadian boy, born in South Africa, who pursued soccer and lacrosse religiously — and likely would have made it to some professional level — made friends in the eighth grade who introduced him to basketball. He then decided to pursue the NBA dream even though no scouts were interested in watching him play. He was rejected by 30 American colleges before being accepted into a mediocre Div-1 NCAA program, the Santa Clara Broncos. There, he stunned the nation enough to be picked 15th overall in 1996 NBA Draft by the Phoenix Suns. The rest is history, as he went on to win back-to-back MVP awards in 2005 and 2006 — cementing him as a surefire Hall of Famer.\n\nEven though it was a time bomb waiting to go off, the news of Steve Nash’s retirement was heartbreaking. As a kid growing up in British Columbia, I was enrolled in the Steve Nash Youth Basketball program. At the time, I couldn’t care less who Steve Nash was. As I fell more in love with the game, I started to look up to the 6’3” underdog who grew up close to home.\n\nWatching him play was thrilling. The no-look and behind-the-back passes, quick ball-handling, seven-seconds-or-less scoring — it was a style of play that didn’t let you keep still. Basketball players everywhere tried to keep up with Nash’s fast-paced game.\n\nWhile succeeding on the court, Nash also managed to be a winner off of the court. Most are familiar with his stats: two-time Most Valuable Player, eight-time NBA All-Star, best free throw shooter, etc. However, only a few are aware of Nash’s humble nature and humanitarian achievements. Nash has invested his time in advocating for renewable energy, improving health and education for underprivileged children through the Steve Nash Foundation, managing the Vancouver Whitecaps Major League Soccer club, and maintaining a filmmaking hobby on the side. Seriously, coolest guy ever.\n\nIt’s hard to describe the impact Steve Nash has had on me. Whether it was his home arena of 19,000 in Vancouver booing him in his rookie years when the Suns took on the Grizzlies, playing with a bloody nose, hitting three pointers with a swollen shut eye, or having permanent nerve damage that he felt with every dribble, Nash never wavered away from his goals."
