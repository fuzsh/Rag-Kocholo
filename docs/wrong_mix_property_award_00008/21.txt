Biography

Abstract

Baron John William Strutt Rayleigh, better known as Lord Rayleigh, was awarded the 1904 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his investigations of the densities of the most important gases and for his discovery of argon in connection with these studies." Although he held positions at Cambridge University, much of his research was conducted in his own personal laboratory on his family estate in Terling, England. He is best known for his part in the discovery of the element Argon, but his work covered a wide range of subjects within the field, including acoustics and the theory of sound, electromagnetism, and even the theory of color and optics.
