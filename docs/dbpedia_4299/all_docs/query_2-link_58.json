        "text": "Another month has passed us by, and August brings us closer to the end of the season. However, several new tracks and albums have dropped to lift our spirits. With brand new projects like Khalid's Sincere, Maren Morris' Intermission, and 49 Winchester's Leavin' This Holler, the beginning of August promises bright things ahead.\n\nA slew of singles dropped, too, from exciting collaborations like Charli XCX's \"Guess\" remix with Billie Eilish and Jessie Murph's new track with Teddy Swims to new offerings from Big Sean, Jhené Aiko, Jelly Roll, Suki Waterhouse, and more. Whether you're looking for full projects or a few new playlist additions, you will not be disappointed.\n\nAs you prepare to close out summer, be sure to check out these 10 new songs and albums.\n\nCharli XCX & Billie Eilish — \"Guess\"\n\nJust 24 hours after Charli XCX set the internet ablaze with a tease of her next collaboration, she not only unveiled the special guest, but she also dropped the track as a New Music Friday-eve gift: a remix of \"Guess\" with her fellow pop queen, Billie Eilish.\n\nThe pulsating song keeps the same club-ready aesthetic of the original from Charli XCX's brat, but taps into the sexual fluidity of Eilish's HIT ME HARD AND SOFT with the \"LUNCH\" singer adding a new verse (fans particularly went into a frenzy over Eilish's line \"Charli likes boys but she knows I'd hit it\"). The track offers a raunchy brand of girl power, further emphasized by the underwear-strewn video, as the unworn undergarments will be donated to survivors of domestic violence through I Support the Girls.\n\nKacey Musgraves — 'Deeper into the Well'\n\nSeven-time GRAMMY-winner Kacey Musgraves is expanding the well she first introduced in March. With the release of Deeper Well, Musgraves showcased a softer side of herself that she discovered during periods of self-introspection following significant changes in her life.\n\nNow, with Deeper into the Well, she takes us further along on her journey. Musgraves gave a taste of the additional seven songs with the release of her single \"Irish Goodbye,\" which narrates the tale of someone struggling to find forgiveness for someone who abruptly left. The extended edition also includes two new features, \"Perfection\" with Tiny Habits and \"Superbloom\" with Leon Bridges.\n\nThe release comes one month before Musgraves is set to kick off her Deeper Well World Tour in Pennsylvania; she'll hit cities on both coasts, and conclude in Nashville in December.\n\nRead More: For The Record: Why Kacey Musgraves' Timeless Album Golden Hour Still Shines 5 Years Later\n\nSaweetie — \"My Best\"\n\nMaintaining her message of confidence and self-worth, Saweetie releases \"My Best,\" an unapologetic anthem that emphasizes knowing your worth and surrounding yourself with people who prioritize your best interests.\n\nThe music video visually represents Saweetie's personal growth, both as an individual and as an artist. Shot at hometown landmarks like her high school and childhood neighborhood, she invites fans on a nostalgic journey of introspection — while also reminding them to stay true to themselves.\n\nLearn More: Meet The First-Time GRAMMY Nominee: Saweetie On Her Long-Awaited Album Pretty B^^^^ Music & Why Women Rappers \"No Longer Need A Co-Sign\"\n\nTones and I — 'Beautifully Ordinary'\n\nFour years after her smash \"Dance Monkey\" took over the world, Tones and I releases her second studio album, Beautifully Ordinary. The follow-up to 2021's Welcome to the Madhouse, the 16-song project reflects the artist's growth, exploring themes of nostalgia, love, and self-acceptance. Each song invites listeners to embark on an emotional, personal journey with Tones and I, offering a source of catharsis for those who relate to her experiences.\n\nTones and I first gave listeners a taste of the project in June with lead single \"Dance With Me,\" a track that delves into themes of heartbreak and desperation. Despite its underlying message of loneliness, the track retains Tones and I's signature upbeat rhythms and vibrant instrumentals — and the rest of Beautifully Ordinary follows suit, offering intimate and heartfelt narratives through her radiant musicality.\n\nSam Smith — 'In The Lonely Hour (10th Anniversary Edition)'\n\nCelebrating the six-times-platinum debut album that catapulted them to stardom, Sam Smith is releasing the 10th anniversary edition of In The Lonely Hour. This special edition features a reimagined version of their classic \"Stay With Me,\" and a brand new track, \"Little Sailor.\"\n\nThe original project launched Smith's career into the stratosphere, receiving critical acclaim and earning them four golden gramophones at the 2015 GRAMMYs, including Best New Artist.\n\n\"I feel so incredibly lucky to be celebrating this milestone with you,\" Smith wrote on Instagram. \"My team and I have created this beautiful anniversary edition for us all, and for the last 10 years.\"\n\nLearn More: 9 Times Queer Artists Made History At The GRAMMYs: From Elton John's Collab With BSB To Kim & Sam's \"Unholy\" Union\n\nKiller Mike — 'Michael & The Mighty Midnight Revival, Songs For Sinners & Saints'\n\nFresh off going three-for-three at the 2024 GRAMMYs, Killer Mike delivers another potent project, Michael & The Mighty Midnight Revival, Songs For Sinners & Saints. A follow-up to his autobiographical album 'MICHAEL', the 10-song collection dives deeper into his personal narrative, offering an epilogue filled with introspection and celebration — including the poignant track \"HUMBLE ME,\" which reflects on his arrest after winning his GRAMMYs in February.\n\nKiller Mike provided fans with a gift, releasing the album as a free download for the first 48 hours. In support of the release, Killer Mike electrified audiences with six performances over three nights at the legendary Blue Note jazz club in NYC, including a live-streamed show that attracted nearly 100,000 viewers. This project is a testament to Killer Mike's ongoing dialogue with his audience, addressing both tribulations and triumphs. As the tour continues with a stop at Lollapalooza just one day after the album's release, fans can engage further with tracks like \"NOBODY KNOWS\" and \"HIGHER LEVEL,\" which offer a glimpse into the rapper’s evolving journey and continued impact on hip-hop.\n\nTiera Kennedy — \"Cry\"\n\nStill riding high from her vocals featured on Beyoncé's COWBOY CARTER, country star Tiera Kennedy releases her latest single, \"Cry,\" which samples Justin Timberlake's 2002 Timbaland-produced hit \"Cry Me A River.\" It's another taste of Kennedy's forthcoming debut album, which she dubs \"R&B/country.\"\n\n\"I've been really inspired by the music I grew up listening to,\" Kennedy shared in an Instagram video. \"Timbaland had a hand in a lot of those songs.\"\n\nKnown for her distinctive approach to blending genres, Kennedy invites listeners to immerse themselves in her world of creative storytelling with her latest track. \"Cry\" explores the narrative of someone who has made their bed and has to lie in it, while Kennedy has already moved on.\n\nExplore More: A Brief History Of Black Country Music: 11 Important Tracks From DeFord Bailey, Kane Brown & More\n\nGryffin — 'PULSE'\n\nReturning with his third studio album, electronic artist Gryffin embarks on a new era and unveils a fresh side of his artistry with PULSE. The 14-track album features collaborations with a range of artists, including Rita Ora, Disco Lines, MAX, and more.\n\n\"PULSE is a return to why I fell in love with dance music in the first place, and this is the most creatively inspired I've felt in years,\" said Gryffin on Instagram. \"I can't wait for you all to hear the new sound and feel the passion I've put into these tracks.\"\n\nJohn K — \"Lost\"\n\nAfter more than a year of not releasing music, John K is back with a new single, \"Lost.\" It's a song that vulnerably reveals feelings of completeness after finding the right person — a fitting narrative for the happily married singer, who is expecting his second child with his wife, Lenée. . Becoming a father is one of the several major life changes John K has experienced in the past few years, all of which have shaped his upcoming music and brought his musical artistry to the next stage.\n\n\"I was writing with the aim of challenging myself to do something I hadn't done before,\" John K said in a press statement. \"I shattered the box of what I thought I had to be, and it allowed me to get to deeper levels of honesty and really gain even more confidence. I took risks, and I honestly expressed myself.\n\nJack White — 'No Name'\n\nAfter releasing two albums within four months in 2022, Jack White has essentially gone silent since — until now. Just two days after announcing his sixth studio album, No Name, the rock icon unveils his latest masterpiece.\n\nThe 13-track album stays true to White's DIY philosophy, with the recording, production, and mixing all handled by the artist himself at his own Third Man Studio. Even before the album dropped on Aug. 2, reviews were already glowing, with Variety calling it the album \"fans have been lusting for\" due to its parallels to the rip-roaring rock of his former band the White Stripes — but \"without seeming retro or leaning too heavily on nostalgia.\"\n\nExplore More: Songbook: A Guide To Jack White's Musical Outlets, From The White Stripes To The Dead Weather & Beyond\n\nBootsy Collins — \"Pure Perfection\"\n\nAhead of his forthcoming album, Album of the Year #1 Funkateer, Bootsy Collins has released \"Pure Perfection,\" a smooth, sultry track featuring German rapper FANTAAZMA and rapper Giz. The track also features one of the funk icon's legendary alter-egos, \"Bedroom Bootsy,\" who brings a sultry tone to the tune.\n\nDue Oct. 25 (the day before Collins' 73rd birthday), Album of the Year #1 Funkateer includes an 18-song track list with contributions from Snoop Dogg, Wiz Khalifa and more. And if the smooth, thumping vibe of \"Pure Perfection\" is any indication, the funk vet is ready to take fans on a trippy musical journey — one that only Bootsy Collins can moderate.\n\nLatest News & Exclusive Videos\n\nThe first New Music Friday of the summer delivers us fresh jams packed with exciting collaborations and debuts.\n\nThis week features releases from big name, genre-crossing collaborations, including Ariana Grande's remix of \"the boy is mine\" with Brandy and Monica, and Post Malone teaming up with Blake Shelton on their new track \"Pour Me a Drink.\" As you build your new summer playlist, make sure you don't miss out on these ten must-hear tunes.\n\nIce Spice — \"Phat Butt\"\n\nAfter a massive year with the release of her EP Like..? and four nominations at the 2024 GRAMMYs, Ice Spice is ready to level up once again with her newest single, \"Phat Butt.\" With self-assured lyricism on top of a classic drill beat that is true to her sound, the track serves as the second single to be released from her debut album, Y2K!. \"Phat Butt\" comes as both a message to those who lacked belief in Ice Spice’s music career, but also as a quintessential summer anthem.\n\nIn the self-directed music video, the rapper is shown performing in front of a wall of graffiti with grainy video filters, emphasizing the Y2K feel. Ice Spice is set to take on her Y2K World Tour next month and it's no doubt that this \"Phat Butt\" will be a highlight on her setlist.\n\nExplore More: The Rise Of Ice Spice: How The \"Barbie World\" Rapper Turned Viral Moments Into A Full-On Franchise\n\nAriana Grande, Brandy, & Monica — \"the boy is mine (remix)\"\n\nWhen asking different groups who sings the song \"the boy is mine,\" you're likely to get two answers. Some will say pop star Ariana Grande, while others will think of the original 1998 R&B hit by Brandy and Monica, which won the GRAMMY for Best R&B Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal in 1999. Doubling down on the shared name of the track and bridging the generational gap among music lovers, Grande, Brandy, and Monica have come together for a fresh remix of \"the boy is mine,\" and the internet couldn't be more ecstatic.\n\n\"My deepest and sincerest thank you to Brandy and Monica, not only for joining me for this moment, but for your generosity, your kindness, and for the countless ways in which you have inspired me,\" said Grande in an Instagram post announcing the collaboration. \"This is in celebration of you both and the impact that you have had on every vocalist, vocal producer, musician, artist that is creating today.\"\n\nRead More: 5 Takeaways From Ariana Grande's New Album Eternal Sunshine\n\nPost Malone & Blake Shelton — \"Pour Me a Drink\"\n\nPost Malone has been dipping his toes into the country genre for some time now and fans have been anxiously awaiting his promised western era post Cowboy Carter.\n\nMalone and Shelton first ignited excitement with a sneak peek of their song, \"Pour Me a Drink\" at the CMA Fest earlier this month. Since Posty announced the official release on Instagram, fans have eagerly awaited its arrival on streaming services. The track serves as a tantalizing preview of Post Malone's upcoming country album, F-1 Trillion, coming August 16.\n\nRead More: Post Malone's Country Roots: 8 Key Moments In Covers and Collaborations\n\nColdplay — \"feelslikeimfallinginlove\"\n\nColdplay has been generating excitement as they embark on their next chapter, with the release of their latest single, \"feelslikeimfallinginlove.\" Over the past few weeks, they've been feeding fans with sneak peeks on social media and performing the song live on their world tour.\n\nThe track sets the stage for the release of Coldplay's highly anticipated tenth studio album, Moon Music, set to land in early October. True to their brand, this song is geared to uplift your spirits, making it the perfect anthem for carefree summer car rides with the windows down.\n\nRead More: How Coldplay's Parachutes Ushered In A New Wave Of Mild-Mannered Guitar Bands\n\nKygo — 'Kygo'\n\nTen years into his career, Norwegian DJ Kygo is dropping his self-titled album, Kygo, which he teased last week with the single \"Me Before You\" featuring Plested. The song, backed by a thumping mid-tempo instrumental, vividly narrates the transformative experience of being deeply influenced by someone in a relationship and not wanting to return to who you were before. The 18-track project features diverse and vibrant collaborations with unexpected guests like the Jonas Brothers and Ava Max.\n\nMaren Morris & Julia Michaels — \"cut!\"\n\nMaren Morris and Julia Michaels, GRAMMY-winners both independently renowned for their iconic music collaborations, are now joining forces to release their electrifying new track, \"cut!\" The duo has been working together for a few years, with Michaels' co-writing Morris' \"Circles Around Town,\" which received a nomination for Best Country Song at the 2023 GRAMMYs. So, while this collaboration might not come as a surprise, it is still certainly a welcomed one.\n\nAfter a two-year hiatus from releasing music, pop enthusiasts have been eagerly anticipating Morris' return to the spotlight. \"Can't wait to cathartically scream f*ck at the top of our lungs together,\" Morris said in an Instagram post announcing the track.\n\nLearn More: Behind Julia Michaels' Hits: From Working With Britney & Bieber To Writing For Wish\n\nGracie Abrams — 'The Secret of Us'\n\nBuilding on the success of her debut album, Good Riddance, and the skyrocketing momentum of her career after opening The Eras Tour, California-native Gracie Abrams has unveiled her much-anticipated sophomore album, The Secret of Us.\n\nThe album includes the track, \"Close to You,\" which was released ahead of the album drop as the full realization of a 20-second snippet that Abrams posted on Instagram back in 2018. After sitting on the track for six years and relentless pleas from fans, the pop artist finally delivered the full song — a mesmerizing blend of Abrams’ vocal prowess and heartfelt lyricism.\n\nLearn More: How Making Good Riddance Helped Gracie Abrams Surrender To Change And Lean Into The Present\n\n6LACK — \"F**k The Rap Game\"\n\n6LACK is rebranding himself and making sure everyone knows. The release of his newest track, \"F**k The Rap Game\" addresses the phenomenon of getting caught up in the glitz and glamor of the entertainment business, tying in the importance of staying true to one's roots. The Atlanta-raised artist is currently on tour with rapper Russ, with whom he recently released the single \"Workin On Me,” another nod to 6LACK's ongoing mission of self-reflection and deep introspection.\n\n“A better me equals a better you equals a better us. That’s been the formula of my life. I can’t thrive unless I’m around people who are constantly trying to better themselves as individuals,” 6LACK said in an interview with GRAMMY.com last year. “It took a second of me really looking at myself in the mirror, being honest and saying: I am not doing as much work on myself as I claim to be doing and want to be doing on myself.”\n\nRead More: 6lack On His Comeback Album SIHAL: \"I’m Playing A Different Game\"\n\nThe Joy — 'The Joy'\n\nMonths after their buzzworthy performance with Doja Cat at Coachella, South African quintet The Joy has released their self-titled album through Transgressive Records. The album was recorded live, in real time, at Church Studios in London and features no instruments or overdubs — just pure, raw vocals that capture the group's authentic sound.\n\nThe Joy came together through a serendipitous twist of fate. Years back, five boys arrived early to their school choir practice and decided to have an impromptu jam session. Realizing their undeniable musical chemistry, The Joy was born, quickly garnering global acclaim. \"They are, like, my favorite group,\" Jennifer Hudson exclaimed on her talk show.\n\nSurfaces — 'good morning'\n\nKnown for their feel-good tunes that took over TikTok in 2019, Surfaces presents their sixth album, Good Morning. In tracks like, “Real Estate,” the band chronicles the idea of exploring one’s mind and thoughts, above all other features, backed by a tropical lo-fi instrumental, as well as a steady thump of a bass, and trilling trumpets.\n\n“’Real Estate’ is about the infatuation with that place in someone’s mind that you can’t get enough of,” Surfaces explained in a press statement. “It’s a familiar place to call home that feels safe and deserves all the love in the world. We wanted to capture the bliss of finding that space and reveling in it.”\n\nLauren Watkins — 'The Heartbroken Record'\n\nLauren Watkins has a packed summer schedule, which includes opening for country artist Morgan Wallen and releasing her second studio album, The Heartbroken Record. This project draws inspiration from music industry veterans like Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings, while also infusing influences from contemporary artists like Kacey Musgraves and Miranda Lambert. Each track from the album underscores stories of love and loss, woven together by the overarching theme of heartbreak.\n\n\"I didn't want to just put an album out — I wanted it to be purposeful,\" Watkins said in a press statement. \"It's the past several years of my life, and that was just so much heartbreak and dramatic girl-feelings, but I think in a really deep and relatable way… and it just needs to get off my chest.\"\n\nWhy 2024 Is The Year Women In Country Music Will Finally Have Their Moment\n\nBeloved by fans around the globe, yet increasingly unaffordable for many artists, concert tours are central to the world of entertainment and local economies. After the pandemic-era global shuttering of concert venues large and small, tours are back, and bigger than ever.\n\nTaylor Swift’s Eras Tour issmashing records, selling more than four million tickets and earning more than $1 billion. But that tour made headlines for another reason: as reported inBusiness Insider and other outlets, for a six-month period in 2023, Swift’s two jets spent a combined 166 hours in the air between concerts, shuttling at most a total of 28 passengers.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, heightened concerns about the global environmental cost of concert touring have led a number of prominent artists to launch initiatives. Those efforts seek both to mitigate the negative effects of touring and communicate messages about sustainability to concertgoers.\n\nA 2023 study sponsored by Texas-based electricity provider Payless Power found that the carbon footprint of many touring bands was massive. In 2022, concert tours in five genres — country, classic rock, hip-hop/rap, metal and pop — were responsible for CO2 emissions totaling nearly 45,000 metric tons. A so-called greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide contributes to climate change by radiative forcing; increased levels of CO2 also contribute to health problems.\n\nNo serious discussion of climate issues suggests a worldwide halt to live music touring, but there exists much room for improvement. Both on their own and with the help of dedicated nonprofit organizations, many artists are taking positive steps toward mitigating the deleterious effects that touring exerts upon the environment.\n\nSmart tour planning is one way to lessen an artist’s carbon footprint. Ed Sheeran’s 2022 European run minimized flights between concert venues, making that leg of his tour the year's most environmentally efficient. Total carbon dioxide emissions (from flights and driving) on Sheeran’s tour came to less than 150 metric tons. In contrast, Dua Lipa’s tour during the same period generated 12 times as much — more than 1800 metric tons — of CO2.\n\nIn July, singer/songwriter and four-time GRAMMY nominee Jewel will embark on her first major tour in several years, alongside GRAMMY winner Melissa Etheridge. During the planning stage for the 28-city tour, Jewel suggested an idea that could reduce the tour’s carbon footprint.\n\n\"I always thought it was so silly and so wasteful — and so carbon footprint-negative — to have separate trucks, separate lighting, separate crews, separate hotel rooms, separate costs,\" Jewel says. She pitched the idea of sharing a backing band with Etheridge. \"I’ve been trying to do this for 25 years,\" Jewel says with a laugh. \"Melissa is the first person who took me up on it!\"\n\nThe changes will not only reduce the tour’s carbon footprint, but they’ll also lessen the cost of taking the shows on the road. Acknowledging that there are many opportunities to meet the challenges of touring’s negative impact upon the environment, Jewel emphasizes that “you have to find [solutions] that work for you.”\n\nSheeran and Jewel aren’t the only popular artists trying to make a difference. A number of high profile artists have become actively involved in creating the momentum for positive change. Those artists believe that their work on sustainability issues goes hand in hand with their role as public figures. Their efforts take two primary forms: making changes themselves, andadvocating for action among their fans.\n\nThe Climate Machine\n\nNorhan Bayomi is an Egypt-born environmental scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a key member of theEnvironmental Solutions Initiative, a program launched to address sustainable climate action. She’s also a recording artist in the trance genre, working under the nameNourey.\n\nThe ESI collaborates with industry heavyweights Live Nation, Warner Music Group and others as well with touring/recording acts likeColdplay to examine the carbon footprint of the music industry. A key component of the ESI is theClimate Machine, a collaborative research group that seeks to help the live music industry reduce carbon emissions. \"As a research institution, we bring technologies and analytics to understand, in the best way possible, the actual impact of the music industry upon climate change,\" says John Fernández, Director of the ESI.\n\n\"I’m very interested in exploring ways that we can bridge between environmental science, climate change and music fans,\" Bayomi says. She explains that the tools at the ESI’s disposal include \"virtual reality, augmented reality and generative AI,\" media forms that can communicate messages to music fans and concertgoers. Fernández says that those endeavors are aimed at \"enlisting, enabling and inspiring people to get engaged in climate change.\"\n\nThe Environmental Solutions Initiative cites Coldplay as a high-profile success. The band and its management issued an \"Emissions Update\" documentin June 2024, outlining its success at achieving their goal of reducing direct carbon emissions from show production, freight, band and crew travel. The established target was a 50 percent cut in emissions compared to Coldplay’s previous tour; the final result was a 59 percent reduction between their 2022-23 tour and 2016-17 tour.\n\nA significant part of that reduction came as a result of a renewable-energy based battery system that powers audio and lights. The emissions data in the update was reviewed and independently validated by MIT’s Fernández.\n\nChange Is Reverberating\n\nGuitarist Adam Gardner is a founding member of Massachusetts-based indie rockersGuster, but he's more than just a singer in a rock band. Gardner is also the co-founder ofREVERB, one of the organizations at the forefront of developing and implementing climate-focused sustainability initiatives.\n\nFounded in 2004 by Gardner and his wife, environmental activist Lauren Sullivan, REVERB began with a goal of making touring more sustainable; over the years its focus has expanded to promote industry-wide changes. Today, the organization promotes sustainability throughout the industry in partnership with music artists, concert venues and festivals.\n\nREVERB initiatives have included efforts to eliminate single-use plastics at the California Roots Music & Arts Festival, clean energy projects in cooperation with Willie Nelson and Billie Eilish, and efforts with other major artists. Gardner has seen sustainability efforts grow over two decades\n\n\"It’s really amazing to see the [change] with artists, with venues, with fans,\" Gardner says. \"Today, people are not just giving lip service to sustainable efforts; they really want to do things that are real and measurable.\"\n\nTheMusic Decarbonization Project is one tangible example of REVERB’s successes. \"Diesel power is one of the dirtiest sources of power,\" Gardner explains. \"And it’s an industry standard to power festival stages with diesel generators.\" Working withWillie Nelson, the organization helped switch the power sources at his annual Luck Reunion to clean energy. At last year’s festival, Nelson’s headlining stage drew 100 percent of its power from solar-powered batteries. \"We set up a temporary solar farm,\" Gardner says, \"and the main stage didn’t have to use any diesel power.\"\n\nBillie Eilish was another early supporter of the initiative. \"She helped us launch the program,\" Gardner says. Eilish’s set at Lollapallooza 2023 drew power from solar batteries, too.\n\nWith such high-profile successes as a backdrop, Gardner believes that REVERB is poised to do even more to foster sustainable concerts and touring. \"Our role now,\" he says, \"isn’t just, ‘Hey, think about this stuff.’ It’s more how do we push farther, faster?\"\n\nAdam Gardner believes that musicians are uniquely positioned to help make a difference where issues of sustainability are concerned. \"When you’re a musician, you’re connecting with fans heart-to-heart. That’s what moves people. And that’s where the good stuff happens.\"\n\nSmall-scale, individual changes can make a difference — especially when they’re coordinated and amplified among other concertgoers. Gardner provides real-world examples. \"Instead of buying a plastic bottle, I brought my reusable and filled it up. Maybe I carpooled to the show.\" Conceding that such steps might seem like drops of water in a giant pool, he emphasizes the power of scale. \"When you actually multiply [those things for] just one summer tour, it adds up,\" he says. \"And it reminds people, ‘You’re not alone in this; you’re part of a community that’s taking action.\"\n\nGardner understands that REVERB’s arguments have to be framed the right way to reach concertgoers. \"Look,\" he admits, \"It’s a concert. We’re not here to be a buzzkill. Our [aim] now is making sure people don’t lose hope.\" He says that REVERB and its partners seek to demonstrate that, with collective action and cultural change, there is reason for optimism.\n\n\"There’s a wonderful feedback loop between hope and action,\" Gardner says with a smile. \"You can’t really have one without the other.\"\n\nSustainable Partnerships\n\nTanner Watt is Director of Partnerships at REVERB; he works directly with touring artists to develop, coordinate and implement initiatives that bring together his organization’s objectives and the specific personal concerns of the artists. \"I get to come up with all the fun, big ideas,\" he says with a wide smile.\n\nWatt acknowledges that like every concertgoer, each touring artist has a certain level of responsibility where sustainability is concerned. \"And everyone can be doing something,\" he says, noting a number of straightforward actions that artists can put in place while on tour. \"They can eliminate single-use waste. They can donate hotel toiletries that [would otherwise] hit the landfill.\"\n\nWatt stresses that artists can lead by example. \"Nobody wants to listen to an artist telling them what to do if they’re not doing it themselves,\" he says. \"But we believe that everybody cares about something.\" He suggests that if an artist has cultivated a following, \"Why not use [that platform] to be that change you want to see in the world?\"\n\nEach artist has his or her own specific areas of concern, but Watt says that there’s a base level of \"greening\" that takes place on every REVERB-affiliated tour. Where things go from there is up to the artist, in coordination with REVERB. Watt mentions Billie Eilish and her tour’s sustainability commitment. \"The Venn diagram of food security, community health, access to healthy food, and the impact on the planet is a big cause for her,\" he says. \"So there’s plant-based catering for her entire crew, across the entire tour.\"\n\nSpeaking toBillboard, Eilish's mother Maggie Baird said championing sustainability starts with artists. \"If artists are interested, it does really start with them telling their teams that they care and that it’s foremost in their thoughts.\" In the same conversation, Eilish called the battle for sustainability \"a never-ending f–king fight.\"\n\nWatt acknowledges that with so many challenges, it’s important for a concerned artist to focus on the issues that move them the most, and where they can make the biggest difference. \"Jack Johnson is a great example,\" he says. While Johnson is a vocal advocate for many environmental issues, on tour he focuses on two (in Watt’s words) \"cause umbrellas\": single-use plastics solutions and sustainable community food systems. Each show on the tour hosts tables representing local nonprofit organizations, presenting concertgoers with real-world, human-scale solutions to those specific challenges.\n\nFour-time GRAMMY winnerBrittany Howard is another passionate REVERB partner. \"Knowing that I wanted to make my tours more sustainable was a start,\" she tells GRAMMY.com, \"but working with REVERB really helped me bring it to life on the road. REVERB has helped us with guidelines and a green rider to keep our stage, greenrooms and buses more sustainable.\"\n\nAfter listing several other specific ways that her tour supports sustainability, Howard notes, \"By supporting these efforts, I am helping ensure future generations have access to clean water, fish, and all that I love about the outdoors.\" A dollar from every ticket sold to a Brittany Howard concert goes toward support of REVERB’s Music Decarbonization project. \"I’m also excited to see industry-wide efforts that are reducing the carbon pollution of live music,\" Howard continues. \"Because it’s not just [about] a single tour, it’s every tour.\"\n\nThere’s a popular aphorism: \"You can’t manage what you can’t measure.\" From its start, REVERB has sought not only to promote change, but to measure its success. \"As long as I’ve been at REVERB, we’ve issuedimpact reports,\" says Tanner Watt. \"We include data points, and give the report to the artists so they understand what we’ve done together.\" He admits that some successes are more tangible than others, but that it’s helpful to focus on the ones that can be quantified. \"We’re very excited that our artists share those with their fans.\"\n\nWatt is clear-eyed at the challenges that remain. \"Even the word ‘sustainable’ can be misleading,\" he concedes, suggesting that the only truly sustainable tour is the one that doesn’t happen. \"But if folks don’t step it up and change the way we do business in every industry — not just ours — we’re going to get to a place where we’re forced to make sacrifices that aren’t painless.\" Getting that message across is REVERB’s aim. \"We can’t stop the world,\" Watt says. \"So we find ways to approach these things positively.\"\n\nWatt says that the fans at concerts featuring Jack Johnson and theDave Matthews Band — both longtime REVERB partners — are already on board with many of the sustainability-focused initiatives which those artists promote. \"But there are lots of artists — and lots of fan bases — out there that aren’t messaged to, or have been mis-messaged to,\" he says. \"I’m really excited to find more ways to expand our reach to them, beyond mainstream pop music. Because these are conversations that are meaningful for everyone, regardless of political affiliation or other beliefs.\"\n\nReimagining The Planet’s Future\n\nSinger, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Adam Met does more than frontAJR, the indie pop trio he founded in 2005 with brothers Jack and Ryan. Met has a PhD in sustainable development and is a climate activist; he's also the founder/Executive Director ofPlanet Reimagined, a nonprofit that promotes sustainability and activism through its work with businesses, other organizations and musicians.\n\n\"I’ve spent years traveling around the world, seeing the direct impact of climate change,\" Met says. He cites two recent and stark examples. \"When we pulled up to a venue in San Francisco, the band had to wear gas masks going from the bus into the venue, because of forest fires,\" he says. AJR’s road crew had to contend with a flash flood in Athens, Greece that washed out their hotel. \"And in Rome, some of our crew members fainted because of the heat.\"\n\nEncouraged by representatives from the United Nations, Met launched Planet Reimagined. Met’s approach focuses on tailored, city-specific actions to empower fans and amplify diverse voices in the climate movement. Through social media and live shows, Met strives to galvanize climate activism among AJR fans. And the methods he has developed can be implemented by other touring artists.\n\nMet points out that one of the most climate-unfriendly parts of the entire concert tour enterprise is fans traveling to and from the concerts. And that’s something over which the artist has little or no control. What they can do, he says, is try to educate and influence. Working closely with Ticketmaster and other stakeholders, Met’s nonprofit initiated a study — conducted from July to December 2023, with results published in April 2024 — to explore the energy that happens at concerts. \"In sociology,\" he explains, \"that energy is called collective effervescence.\" The study’s goal is to find ways to channel that energy toward advocacy and action.\n\nPolling a quarter million concertgoers across musical genres, the study collected data on attitudes about climate change. \"Seventy-three percent of fans who attend concerts believe that climate change is real, and that we need to be doing more about it,\" Met says. \"Seventy-eight percent have already taken some sort of action in their lives.\" He believes that if his organization can activate even a fraction of the estimated 250 million people annually who attend concerts around the globe, \"that’s the ballgame.\"\n\nMet’s goal is to do more than, say, get concertgoers to switch from plastic to paper drinking straws. \"At scale those things make a difference. But people want to see actions where there’s a track record,\" he says; a return on investment.\n\nAJR will be putting a plan into action on the second half of their upcoming arena tour. Part of the initiative is encouraging concertgoers to register to vote, and then actually vote. Beyond that, Met has specific actions in mind. \"At every single stop, we’re putting together materials around specific policies that are being debated at the local level,\" he explains. \"We give people a script right there, so they can call their elected representative and say, ‘I want you to vote [a certain way on this issue].’\"\n\nHe believes the initiative will lead to thousands of people contacting – and hopefully influencing – their representatives. With regard to sustainability issues, Met is convinced that \"the most impact that you can have as an artist is when you give fans ways to pick up the mantle themselves.\"\n\nArtists Who Are Going On Tour In 2024: The Rolling Stones, Drake, Olivia Rodrigo & More"
