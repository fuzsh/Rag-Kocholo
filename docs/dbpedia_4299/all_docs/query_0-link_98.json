        "text": "The distinguished Canadian actor Christopher Plummer (December 13, 1929 - February 5, 2021) has died at age 91.\n\nGuest contributor Bob DiMucci has provided this extensive tribute to his performing career:\n\nThe Films of Christopher Plummer\n\nAfter five years of doing television guest shots, Christopher Plummer made his feature film debut opposite Susan Strasberg and Henry Fonda in 1958’s STAGE STRUCK. The film was an adaptation of Zoë Atkins' play, which had earlier been filmed in 1933 by RKO under the title MORNING GLORY, starring Katharine Hepburn, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and Adolphe Menjou.\n\nIn the film, young “Eva” (Strasberg) arrives in New York City determined to become a great theatrical star, but discovers that her goal may not be as easily attainable as she had hoped. At the office of producer “Lewis Easton” (Fonda), Eva waits patiently while Lewis meets with young writer “Joseph Sheridan” (Plummer), who is adapting Lewis’ latest play.\n\nPlummer was amazed at the lavishness and no-expense-spared aspect of the production. A Rolls-Royce was at his disposal for the entire duration of the shooting. This was a far cry from producer Samuel Bronston's previous KING OF KINGS (1961), where Jeffrey Hunter and Robert Ryan's car broke down on the way to the \"Sermon on the Mount\" scene, and they had to push it to get it started, in costume as Jesus Christ and John the Baptist.\n\nAnthony Mann directed the film, which premiered in March 1964. Dimitri Tiomkin’s score was nominated for both Academy and Golden Globe Awards. He won the Golden Globe but lost the Oscar to the Sherman brothers for MARY POPPINS. Selections from the lengthy score were released on a Columbia LP. It was reissued on CD by Varese Sarabande in 1989 and by PEG in 1998. In 1991, Cloud Nine released an expanded (but still incomplete) version, augmented with mono cues from the only surviving soundtrack elements, but leaving off some of the album tracks. This was re-issued in 2012 by La-La Land, who restored all of the album tracks. In 2011, Prometheus re-recorded the complete score with the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Nic Raine.\n\nBecause of the expensive cast, large-scale effects, and extravagant sets, the original $6 million budget for the film ballooned to an estimated $14 million to $16 million by the end of production. Because of the film’s length, Paramount could only get 10 showings per week of the roadshow version of the film onto screens. That, and the fact that box office returns were slack, prompted a decision to send the film into continuous showings earlier than expected. In the end, the film grossed only $4.8 million in the U.S. By the summer of 1964, Samuel Bronston had filed for bankruptcy, and his company ceased all business activities that same year. Because of the losses on both THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE and the earlier CIRCUS WORLD, it was estimated that Bronston was $24 million in debt.\n\nVery little background information on the real Captain Von Trapp was known or available to Plummer, so he took to the Salzburg mountains with an interpreter. There, they met with Georg's nephew and asked him what the real man was like. The nephew told them that he was the most boring man he'd ever met. The real Maria, long a widow by the time of filming, complimented Plummer, saying that he was much more handsome than her husband was.\n\nChristopher Plummer intensely disliked working on the film. He was known to refer to it as \"The Sound of Mucus\" or \"S&M\". Plummer admitted that he found Julie Andrews insufferable and annoying during filming, referring to her as “Miss Disney” to the other cast and crew, and he likened working with Andrews to \"being hit over the head with a big Valentine's Day card, every day.\" Later, he admitted to being immature in his feelings and that Andrews was a great actress who behaved like a true professional. Andrews claimed that Plummer's cynicism probably helped his performance and the film, keeping it from being too sentimental. The two ultimately became good friends.\n\nChristopher Plummer had opted out of the Harry Palmer role in THE IPCRESS FILE (1965) in favor of the Captain von Trapp part, a decision he later regretted. Plummer admitted that he ate and drank heavily during filming to drown out his unhappiness with making the movie, and found plenty of opportunities to do both in Austria. His costume eventually had to be refitted for his extra weight. Plummer stated that he was drunk during the shooting of the music festival sequence.\n\nGiven his dislike for the role, Plummer's biggest challenge was resisting the temptation to send it up. Director Robert Wise kept him in check, telling him to play it straight.\n\nPlummer, whose singing voice was dubbed by Bill Lee (of the singing group The Mellomen), reportedly performed his own vocals on set during production. Plummer also learned to play the guitar for his part, but his guitar playing was also dubbed for the film.\n\nIn speaking of co-star Eleanor Parker (Baroness Elsa Schraeder) Christopher Plummer told People magazine in 2015 that “Eleanor had great fun because she fell in love with the cameraman and they had a marvelous time together. He was an awfully nice guy and she deserved a nice guy. She was the most delicious woman, and, my god, what a beauty, so I loved them both and they were such lovebirds always holding hands everywhere. I think their story is much more romantic than THE SOUND OF MUSIC.”\n\nThe New York Times critic Bosley Crowther thoroughly trashed Christopher Plummer in his review of the film: \"The adults are fairly horrendous, especially Christopher Plummer as Captain Von Trapp. Looking as handsome and phony as a store-window Alpine guide, Mr. Plummer acts the hard-jawed, stiff-backed fellow with equal artificiality. And when he puts his expressions and his gestures to somebody else's singing of the wistful \"Eidelweiss\", it is just a bit too painfully mawkish for the simple sentiments of that nice song.\"\n\nChristopher Plummer softened his criticism of the film over the decades, stating that he had come to respect the picture's place in history and its great affection from audiences. However, he maintained that he didn’t care much for it as a movie, and the role of Captain von Trapp was the most difficult of his career due to his dislike of sentiment and working with children. He also was greatly frustrated being typecast as von Trapp in the years following, and strived hard to regain his status as a character actor.\n\nRobert Wise directed the film. Among the film’s five Oscars (including “Best Picture”) was one for “Music (Scoring of Music—adaption or treatment).” The most recent release of the RCA soundtrack for the film was its 50th Anniversary Edition in 2015. THE SOUND OF MUSIC was the number one film at the box office in 1965, with a U.S. gross of $149 million. As late as 2014, the film was ranked the fifth highest-grossing film in history (with earnings adjusted for inflation), bringing in over $2.3 billion worldwide.\n\nProducer Sam Spiegel reunited Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, and composer Maurice Jarre from LAWRENCE OF ARABIA for the World War II thriller THE NIGHT OF THE GENERALS. Sharif played Major Grau of German Intelligence who investigates three top-ranking Nazi generals who may be involved in a murder. Christopher Plummer played Field Marshal Rommel in the film.\n\nBoth O'Toole and Sharif were being held to the Spiegel contracts they had signed several years earlier, when they were less famous, and consequently they both had to accept smaller fees than one would expect, given how famous they were by 1967. Neither was very happy with this situation, but they took care to claim the lavish living expenses to which they were entitled. Location scenes were filmed in Warsaw and Paris.\n\nMaurice Jarre’s score was released on a Colgems LP, which was re-issued on CD in an expanded version by Intrada in 1990. THE NIGHT OF THE GENERALS fought its way into the top 50 films of the year, with a $6 million gross.\n\nOne of the rarely discussed plays of author Peter Shaffer was his 1964 effort THE ROYAL HUNT OF THE SUN, which was turned into a 1969 screenplay by Philip Yordan. Set in 1532, the film follows Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro (Robert Shaw) as he leads an expedition into the heart of the Inca Empire and captures the Incan Emperor Atahualpa (Christopher Plummer) and claims Peru for Spain.\n\nChristopher Plummer had played Pizarro in the 1965 Broadway production of the play, but at the request of Robert Shaw, he signed on to portray the Incan king, Atahualpa, in the film. He drew inspiration for his own performance from David Carradine's stage depiction of the Inca. Plummer also swung a spear about for fifteen minutes a day in physical preparation for his role.\n\nPlummer’s brown body makeup took more than two hours to apply each morning, and the actor studied with an Incan dialect coach to prepare for the part. Plummer reportedly suggested that some of his character’s speeches be translated into the ancient language for the final film.\n\nThe picture closely follows Kipling’s original short story, although Huston enhanced the Masonic theme for the film. Another change made by Huston and Hill was the character played by Plummer, who in the short story was not given a name, but, like the real Kipling during his early career, worked for a small newspaper in Lahore.\n\nThe lyrics to the hymn by Reginald Heber, “The Son of God Goes Forth To War,” are sung by Daniel several times in the film and also appear in Kipling’s story. In the film, the words are sung to the tune of a traditional Irish melody, “The Moreen,” which is better known as “The Minstrel Boy.” The tune is a major theme in the soundtrack and is heard intermittently throughout the film.\n\nTHE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING was nominated for four Academy Awards (Art Direction-Set Decoration, Costume Design, Film Editing and Writing-Screenplay Adapted from Other Materials). Maurice Jarre was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Original Score-Motion Picture, losing to John Williams for JAWS. Jarre’s score was released on a Capitol Records LP, which has been re-issued on CD by Bay Cities in 1990, Milan in 1992, and Kritzerland in 2010.\n\nTHE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING was among the top 20 films of 1975, with a $33.3 million U.S. gross.\n\nJESUS OF NAZARETH was an epic re-telling of the story of Jesus Christ, made as a television mini-series. Robert Powell starred in the title role, and the film featured nearly two dozen well-known actors and actresses in other roles. Director Franco Zeffirelli had considered Dustin Hoffman and Al Pacino for the part of Jesus, and Robert Powell to play Judas. Tom Courtenay was offered the role, but declined. Once Powell got the lead role, Peter O'Toole was cast as Judas, but had to back out of the project, due to illness. Ian McShane ultimately played the part.\n\nZeffirelli wanted Marcello Mastroianni for the role of Pontius Pilate, but they couldn't agree on financial terms. Zeffirelli was happy in the end, as he felt that Rod Steiger was a \"magnificent Pilate\". Maria Schneider was originally offered the role of the Virgin Mary, but declined, and later regretted the decision. Olivia Hussey played the part. Elizabeth Taylor was interested in playing Mary Magdalene, but the role went to Anne Bancroft. Christopher Plummer played the part of Herod Antipas. Ian Holm played the scribe \"Zerah,” an entirely fictional character created purely for dramatic reasons.\n\nAt a cost estimated between twelve and twenty million dollars, this mini-series had a budget equivalent to many feature films of the time, and was by far the most expensive made-for-television movie at the time of production, a record it would hold for several years.\n\nThe mini-series premiered on NBC as \"The Big Event\" in two three-hour installments with limited commercials on Palm Sunday and Easter Sunday (April 3 and April 10, 1977). Additional footage was added for a 1979 re-run, which was broadcast in four two-hour installments. The film has been released on VHS and DVD as one complete presentation with one set of credits.\n\nThe film received Emmy Nominations for Outstanding Special and for James Farentino as Outstanding Supporting Actor, for playing Simon Peter. Zeffirelli received a BAFTA nomination for Best Direction of a Single Play. Maurice Jarre’s score for the film was released on an RCA LP in the U.S., and on Pye Records in the UK. The first CD release came from RCA Italy in 1996. An expanded release was issued in Italy by Legend in 2010.\n\nIn an interview with Variety, director Luigi Cozzi stated that although people assume STARCRASH was an attempt to capitalize on the popularity of STAR WARS, the design of the picture and its script were developed before the release of STAR WARS. Cozzi said that the film's producer and screenwriter, Nat Wachsberger, and his son, producer Patrick Wachsberger, who had just developed the American production company Film Enterprises Productions, signed on to the film in May 1977 during the Cannes Film Festival after viewing sample work created by Cozzi for investors. Nevertheless, other reports claim that the Wachsbergers specifically asked Cozzi to make a space opera like STAR WARS, and that although Cozzi had never seen the film, he had the novelization of the film in his library. So he read it and began working on his own version.\n\nReportedly, Ennio Morricone was first offered the opportunity to compose the film's score, which he turned down. The filmmakers were highly reluctant to allow John Barry to see the film, in case he decided to quit the project. But ultimately, he agreed to score the film. His score was released on a Polydor LP, which was re-issued on CD by BSX in 2014. STARCRASH took in $5 million at the U.S. box office.\n\nThis was the fifth and final film on which Plummer and fellow Canadian Donald Sutherland worked together. Desmond Davis and Alan Birkinshaw directed this 1984 Agatha Christie adaptation.\n\nPino Donaggio was engaged to provide the film’s score. But after Donaggio turned in his score, the film went through major revisions, with a lot of re-editing and some new footage. A scene with Christopher Plummer shooting a rabbit in the woods was filmed in New Jersey and not Devon, England where the rest of the film was shot. This was a scene added after principal photography had been completed--and Plummer could not return to work in England for tax reasons.\n\nAt that point, the film required rescoring, but Donaggio was already working on another project and was not available. So, jazz great Dave Brubeck was hired to score the film. He was told by the producers that he'd have two weeks to write an original score. He said no. They then agreed that they'd use already existing Brubeck tunes, newly record them, and lay them into the picture. Kritzerland released Donaggio’s unused score in 2011. Released in the U.S. in 1985, ORDEAL BY INNOCENCE earned less than $150,000 at the box office.\n\nIn addition to acting, Leonard Nimoy was the Executive Producer of 1991's STAR TREK VI: THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY. Nothing from the original story draft by Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal was used in the final film. But the two went to the Writers Guild and demanded story credit. The Guild originally removed Leonard Nimoy's story credit, but Nimoy threatened to sue the Guild and Paramount if his credit was not restored. Finally, all three of them received story credit.\n\nIn the film, on the eve of retirement, “Kirk” (William Shatner) and “McCoy” (DeForest Kelly) are accused of assassinating the Klingon “High Chancellor Gorkon” (David Warner) and are imprisoned. The Enterprise crew must help them escape to thwart a conspiracy aimed at sabotaging the last best hope for peace. Christopher Plummer plays Gorkon’s Chief of Staff, “General Chang.”\n\nGeneral Chang was originally to have had hair, but as his make-up was being applied for the first time, Plummer liked the bald look, and had the make-up technician omit the hair. Plummer also asked that he be allowed to wear less \"severe\" Klingon make-up for his role.\n\nAt one point in the film, at the dinner with the Klingons, the characters quote from \"Hamlet\" by William Shakespeare. At that table are two notable Hamlets (Christopher Plummer in 1957 and 1964, and David Warner in 1965), as well as William Shatner, who began his career in Canada, understudying Plummer in Shakespearian plays. Early in their careers, Shatner understudied Plummer in \"King Lear\". Invited to the Edinburgh Festival, Plummer could not appear due to a kidney stone, and Shatner replaced him with no rehearsals and with only four hours notice. The two had been having a friendly rivalry and, hearing rave reviews of Shatner's Lear, Plummer's performance the following night was what he described as being the best of his career - and he later acknowledged Shatner as providing the impetus for this.\n\nDirector Nicholas Meyer and Nimoy disagreed as to who came up with the concept of using the film as an allegory for the fall of Soviet Communism, with both men claiming credit for the idea. Cliff Eidelman’s score was released by MCA. Intrada released an expanded edition in 2012. The $26 million production was the #15 film of the year at the U.S. box office, with a $74.9 million gross.\n\nChristopher Plummer's character sports a prominent scar on the bridge of his nose. According to director Taylor Hackford, he wanted Mackey to look disheveled and careworn, so he asked his costume designer to put Mackey in the worst suits she could find, but without success. Plummer quietly approached Hackford and said, \"Taylor, it's impossible for me to look bad in a suit, that's just the way I'm built. But let me do something that will change all that. I'll break my nose.\" Plummer took an eye-brow pencil and drew a line across the bridge of his nose, and then shaded it to create the illusion of an ugly, permanent scar. Upon seeing the result, Hackford was astounded by Plummer's transformed appearance: \"My desired image of John Mackey suddenly materialized before my eyes.\"\n\nDanny Elfman’s score for the 1995 crime drama was released by Varese Sarabande, who also released a Deluxe Edition in 2020. The film had modest box office receipts of $25 million in the U.S.\n\nChristopher Plummer was infuriated after watching the final cut of the movie and discovering that key scenes had been cut and one of his important speeches had been reduced to background noise. Plummer revealed in a 2012 Newsweek interview that he went to the lengths of writing a letter to director Terrence Malick after his experience. \"He insists on writing, and overwriting, and overwriting, until it sounds terribly pretentious,” he told Newsweek. “You have to work terribly hard to make it sound real. And then he edits his films in such a way where he cuts everybody out of the story.\" In the letter, he told Malick that he was boring and he had to get a writer. Plummer vowed never to work with Malick again.\n\nIt’s likely that Plummer’s cut scenes have been restored in the extended home video version of the film, which runs nearly 40 minutes longer than the general theatrical release version. James Horner’s score was released by New Line Records in the U.S. and Silva Screen in the UK. The $30 million production was not popular in the U.S., grossing just $13 million at the domestic box office, but it earned nearly three times as much overseas, adding another $37 million to its take.\n\nIn the Pixar animated film UP, we first meet “Carl Fredricksen” (Edward Asner) as a young boy who dreams of being an explorer, much as his idol “Charles Muntz” (Christopher Plummer). Then Carl meets young “Ellie” (Elie Docter) who is just as much an explorer at heart as Carl is. The two hit it off. They eventually fall in love and have a long, loving marriage.\n\nBut then things change, and Carl – now a retired balloon salesman -- suffers from depression and becomes a recluse. When he’s forced to move to an old folks’ home, he decides to tie a thousand helium balloons to his house and fly off. His plan works out well until he discovers a stowaway – boy scout “Russell” (Jordan Nagai), who is determined to earn his merit badge by offering his assistance to Carl. Together, they set off to find Paradise Falls, a place where Ellie had always wanted to visit with Carl before real life interfered. On their way, they come across an exotic bird, talking dogs, and eventually Charles Muntz himself.\n\nIn the fantasy adventure THE IMAGINARIUM OF DOCTOR PARNASSUS, the London sideshow troupe of \"Doctor Parnassus\" (Christopher Plummer) promises audiences a journey to the \"Imaginarium\", an imaginary world commanded by the mind of Parnassus where dreams come true. In the stories that Parnassus tells to his daughter \"Valentina\" (Lily Cole), to his long-time assistant \"Percy\" (Verne Troyer), and to his new assistant \"Anton\" (Andrew Garfield), he claims to have lived more than one thousand years.\n\nPercy and Anton save the life of a man hanging from a bridge. The man on the rope is \"Tony\" (Heath Ledger). He joins the traveling wagon performance, is repulsed by its primitive style, and recommends making it more state-of-the-art. Heath Ledger died during the production of the film, and production was shut down for a few months. Then it was re-started when Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell agreed to complete Ledger's role. The film's fantasy premise, and some clever re-writes, let the actors play a man whose appearance changes as he travels between imaginary worlds. After Ledger's passing, Verne Troyer and Lily Cole both got heart tattoos in memory of him.\n\nBEGINNERS focuses on “Oliver” (Ewan McGregor), who is at the crossroads of his life with the death of his mom “Georgia” (Mary Page Keller), and with his dad “Hal” (Christopher Plummer) revealing that he's gay. In a way, it's one depressing blow after another, especially when his mother's death seemed like a release for his dad to finally lead the remaining years of his life in as honest a fashion as possible. Oliver is also concerned about caring for his father in his twilight years, while at the same time he is falling for a French actress, “Anna” (Melanie Laurent), who also has issues of her own to contend with.\n\nThe role of Hal was intended for Max von Sydow, who declined due to the nature of the subject in favor of appearing as a mute in EXTREMELY LOUD & INCREDIBLY CLOSE. Plummer was attracted to the role because he liked the fact there was no self-pity regarding his character.\n\nThe original production of the (essentially) one-man play “Barrymore” opened at the Music Box Theatre on Broadway on March 14, 1997 and ran for 236 performance, closing on November 2, 1997. The original cast consisted of Christopher Plummer as John Barrymore and Michael Mastro as Frank. Plummer won Tony and Drama Desk awards for best actor. The production then toured the United States with Plummer as Barrymore from July 6, 1998 to December 6, 1998.\n\nMore than a dozen years later, Christopher Plummer appeared in the film BARRYMORE, reprising the role he originated on Broadway. Plummer again portrays John Barrymore, the youngest of the legendary acting family's accomplished first generation, who gained fame for Shakespearean drama on Broadway and London stages, before graduating to silent films and early talkies. The film’s opening titles establish 1925 as the peak of this Barrymore's stage success, then followed by a slow descent into alcoholism, which would ultimately claim his life at age 60 in May of 1942.\n\nThe show, conceived by William Luce and adapted and directed by Erik Canuel, is set two months before the actor's death. He is dropped off at Broadway's old Majestic Theatre, which he has rented for the night to go over his lines for an audition and potential comeback. The play is Shakespeare's Richard III, the title role of which Barrymore once performed to some acclaim. But that seems ages ago to this cynical, old alcoholic.\n\nIn David Fincher’s remake of the 2009 Swedish art-house hit THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, Rooney Mara is “Lisbeth Salander,” the eponymous girl who bears the psychological scars of a harsh upbringing, and is now a ward of the state due to being declared legally incompetent as a child. When her existing ward suffers a stroke, she is assigned to “Nils Bjurman” (Yorick van Wageningen), who uses his position to sexually abuse her. Although Lisbeth is reserved and withdrawn – and possibly psychotic – she possesses a knack for research and computer hacking which makes her invaluable to the security company that employs her. One of her assignments is an investigation into the background of “Mikael Blomkvist” (Daniel Craig), a reporter whose finances have been wiped out in a libel case brought against him by a ruthless businessman.\n\nThe report on Blomkvist has been commissioned by “Henrik Vanger” (Christopher Plummer), a wealthy industrialist whose extended family live in separate houses overlooking one another on an island. Vanger’s family members are not only largely estranged from one another but also include neo-Nazis amongst their number. Forty years ago, Vanger’s niece Harriet disappeared during a family gathering on the island. Vanger and the police believe she is dead, but a body was never found, and each year he receives a pressed flower as an anonymous birthday present – as he used to get from Harriet when she was alive. Haunted by her disappearance, Vanger has amassed a wealth of documentary evidence and hires Blomkvist to search it for any clues he may have missed.\n\nALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD told the story of the kidnapping of 16-year-old John Paul Getty III (Charlie Plummer) and the desperate attempt by his devoted mother (Michelle Williams) to convince his billionaire grandfather J. Paul Getty (Christopher Plummer) to pay the ransom. (Charlie Plummer and Christopher Plummer are not related.)\n\nOriginally, Jack Nicholson was offered the role of J. Paul Getty, but he declined the offer. Kevin Spacey eventually signed on for the role. Principal photography began in March 2017 and was completed in August 2017. In late October, numerous sexual misconduct allegations were made against Kevin Spacey. Fearing that the film would be unmarketable with Spacey as its star, on November 8, the producers announced that although the film was otherwise ready for release, reshoots had been commissioned with Christopher Plummer replacing Spacey in the role of Getty.\n\nPlummer claimed he was prepared to replace Spacey as J. Paul Getty on short notice because he had previously been considered for the role and had read the script. He had less than two weeks to memorize his lines, but did have the advantage of having met Getty in London at a couple of his parties during the 1960s. J. Paul Getty was eighty years old when his grandson was kidnapped. Kevin Spacey, at age 58, had to be prosthetically aged to resemble Getty, whereas Plummer, at age 88, needed no special makeup applications.\n\nDirector Ridley Scott decided not to show Plummer any footage of Spacey in character, or even tell him how Spacey played the scenes. Scott noted that Spacey played J. Paul Getty as a more explicitly cold and unfeeling character, while Plummer's take on the role showed a warmer side to the billionaire, but the same unflinching refusal to simply pay off his grandson's kidnappers. When finished, Scott found both performances to be quite different but equally effective in their own particular styles.\n\nAfterwards, Plummer said, “I was just hopeful that at my age my memory would serve me. Because I had to learn my lines very quickly and I thought, ‘Oh, Christ, am I going to be able to hang on to this?’ But that's because of years in the theatre. You're trained to be in an emergency like that. The whole theatrical experience is an emergency.”\n\nThe re-shoots (22 scenes) took eight days to film at a cost of $10 million. They also involved co-stars Mark Wahlberg and Michelle Williams having to return to the Rome set during the Thanksgiving holiday of 2017.\n\nDaniel Pemberton’s score was released by Sony Classical. With the re-shoots, the film ended up costing $50 million to produce. It essentially broke even at the world-wide box office, with a total gross of $57 million. Christopher Plummer received an Academy Award nomination for “Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role,” making him the oldest Academy Award nominee for acting. He also received a Golden Globe nomination for “Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture.” Plummer lost both awards to Sam Rockwell for THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI.\n\nLike another great stage actor, Richard Burton, early in his career Christopher Plummer failed to connect with the screen in a way that would make him a star. Dynamic on stage, he didn't succeed as a younger leading man in films. Perhaps if he had been born earlier, and acted in the studio system of Hollywood's golden age, he could have been carefully groomed for stardom. As it was, he shared the English stage actors' disdain for the movies, which did not help him in that medium, as he confessed. But he was equally at home in London as he was on the boards of Broadway or on-stage in his native Canada.\n\nPlummer once said, “The theatre is not for sissies. It separates the men from the boys.” For his stage work, Plummer racked up two Tony Awards on six nominations, the first in 1974 as Best Actor (Musical) for the title role in \"Cyrano\" and the second in 1997, as Best Actor (Play), in \"Barrymore\". Plummer won two Emmy Awards out of seven nominations stretching over 46 years from 1959 and 2011, and one Genie Award in six nominations from 1980 to 2009.\n\nPlummer is one of nine actors to have won the “Triple Crown of Acting” (an Oscar, Emmy and Tony); the others in chronological order are Thomas Mitchell, Melvyn Douglas, Paul Scofield, Jack Albertson, Jason Robards, Jeremy Irons, Al Pacino and Geoffrey Rush.\n\nPlummer eventually made peace with his place in film history as part of THE SOUND OF MUSIC. In 2011, he observed “People were unnaturally sentimental about the film. So, I always gave it a tough time. But a few years ago, I went to an Easter party and had to watch the damn thing with these kids. I was a prisoner! And then I thought, it's got everything - the lovely songs, the Nazis and the nuns and the kids. It's timeless and I'm grateful for it.”\n\nRegarding the arc of his career, Christopher Plummer said “My type of roles [early on were] sort of uptight, urbane, sophisticated young men ... sort of boring and dull. People don't have any imagination in this business, do they? I can do comedy. I can do all sorts of things. Why are they giving me this uptight crap? So, I was so happy when I arrived at a certain age and I could become a character actor and be free of all that nonsense.”\n\nThat’s where Plummer shined—in dozens of great character roles. He wasn’t an action star or a genre actor. But in dramatic roles large and small he delivered solid performances on screen for well over 60 years, and leaves a film legacy worth exploring in depth. Farewell, Chris."
