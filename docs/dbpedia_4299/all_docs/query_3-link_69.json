        "text": "WaterTower Theatre Announces Single Tickets are On Sale!\n\n28th Season: October 2023-September 2024\n\nAddison (TX) – Shane Peterman, Producing Artistic Director has announced details of the 2023-2024 Season. This season marks the 28th for WaterTower Theatre, and the fourth season programmed by Producing Artistic Director Shane Peterman & Associate Producer Elizabeth Kensek.\n\nFrom Shane, “It occurred to me while choosing this season with Elizabeth, that we were focusing on both fictional and non-fictional characters that have shaped the last 100 years in many ways. I think this season reveals the truth of what WTT theatre makers do- sharing human stories as told through the eyes of incredible playwrights and by the artists here in North Texas. I am particularly proud of the people of WaterTower Theatre; the staff, board, and our many friends that support us. I am proud of our town and the many North Texas professional theatre artists and designers who have worked with WaterTower over the last four years since I arrived here as the Producing Artistic Director. I suppose that is what resonated with me the most, is our greatest assets: the people, community, relationships, and stories that connect us all. I hope you will enjoy this, our twenty eighth season as we share these stories together.”\n\nThis season focuses on the stories of fascinating, inspirational, complex, and intriguing characters- both real and fictional. We will explore the complex characters created by the conflicted artist Charlie Chaplin, the fascinating legacy of Texas’ first and only female Governor Ann Richards, the barrier breaking conflicted musician Louis Armstrong, and the iconic character of fictional Mary Poppins made an indelible figure during all our childhoods in literature and film. We hope that you will join us at WaterTower for this ambitious 28th Season!\n\nSeason ticket packages will remain on sale until mid-November for only $149 for all three shows. Subscribers save nearly 20% on each ticket and have access to add-on tickets at a discount, invitations to exclusive subscriber-only events, and discounted concessions for the season with the new WaterTower member perk card.\n\nSingle tickets for all four shows are on sale at the WaterTower box office and on www.watertowertheatre.org as of Monday August 21st, 2023.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSEASON 28: 2023-2024\n\nRegional Premiere Musical\n\nCHAPLIN: THE MUSICAL\n\nMusic and Lyrics By: Christopher Curtis\n\nBook By: Christopher Curtis & Thomas Meehan\n\nDirected By: Shane Peterman\n\nMusic Directed By: Vonda K. Bowling\n\nChoreographed By: Ann Nieman\n\nPerformances: 11/8/23-11/19/23\n\nCHAPLIN is based on the real-life story of Charlie Chaplin, the iconic film actor, writer, producer, and director. The new musical spans the comic’s entire career, from Chaplin’s first performance as a child in 19th-century London to his tearful acceptance of an honorary Academy Award in 1972. The show documents the beloved actor’s rise to fame and the people who shaped his life, including his mother Hannah, his older brother Sydney, his fourth wife Oona O’Neill and gossip columnist Hedda Hopper. The musical dramatizes the making of Chaplin’s legendary films, including The Kid, The Circus, Modern Times and The Great Dictator as well as his turbulent childhood, frenzied love life and political beliefs. Featuring an original score by Christopher Curtis, including “Look at All the People,” “Just Another Day in Hollywood” and “This Man,” CHAPLIN tells the touching story of the man who makes the world laugh as his legendary screen persona, the Tramp, but struggles to find happiness in his own life.\n\nContains adult themes.

It takes place in 1971 in a dressing room backstage at the Empire Room of New York’s Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, where Armstrong performed in public for the last time, just four months before his death. Reminiscing into a tape recorder about his life and work, Armstrong seeks to come to terms with his longstanding relationship with Glaser, whom he once loved like a father but now believes to have betrayed him, and Davis’ criticisms of him as a fellow Black artist.\n\nContains adult themes & strong language. Recommended for ages 18 and above.\n\nA Blockbuster Musical\n\nDisney and Cameron Mackintosh’s\n\nMARY POPPINS\n\nA Musical Based on the stories of P.L.
