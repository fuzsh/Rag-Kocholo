        "text": "Ashton Balch’s favorite memory of Addison Duncan as a high school soccer player has nothing to do with scoring a goal or making an assist. It was not a play at all.\n\nThe most cherished moment Balch, Bishop Chatard girls soccer coach, takes with her came after a particularly emotional loss to rival and top-ranked Guerin Catholic, a team that would go on to win the Class 2A state championship. Chatard was playing without its starting goalkeeper, senior Olivia Hill, who was out sick. In stepped inexperienced sophomore Maggie Ellis, who kept her team in the game in a 1-1 tie through regulation and overtime.\n\nThen came the penalty kicks. When Guerin clinched the victory, Duncan made a beeline toward Ellis.\n\nMarion County: North Central's Maddie Rocchio wins county Female Athlete of Year\n\n'He's definitely fearless.' Chatard's Sam Feeney named City Male Athlete of Year\n\n“The first thing Addy did was instantly run to Maggie,” Balch said. “She didn’t want Maggie to feel upset about it. She sat with her about 10 to 15 minutes after the game to let her know it was OK. It was one of the best things I’ve seen from a teammate.”\n\nDuncan, a three-sport athlete with 11 varsity letters in soccer, basketball and track and field, used those leadership skills to earn the City Female Athlete of the Year by a by a vote of the athletic directors in Marion County. The honor dates to 1950 (it grew to include female athletes in 1979) and is regarded as one of the top recognition awards for Indianapolis-area senior high school athletes.\n\nOther finalists for the award were Cardinal Ritter three-sport standout Evelyn Buck and Cathedral volleyball, basketball and tennis standout Taylor Lewis. The award is geared toward athletic achievement, but the winners also exhibit impressive credentials in academics and in their personal lives. Generally, multi-sport athletes are given consideration over single-sport athletes, though that is not always the case.\n\n“I love competing,” Duncan said. “That’s all I really do. If I get honors that come with it, that’s great. There are athletes that I compete against that are much more talented than I am. I’m just honored that I get to be recognized for that. Not only me but my team in general because I’m just one player.”\n\nDuncan grew up competing against her older brother, Aiden, who was named the Blake Ress Mental Attitude Award winner for Class 3A after Chatard won the football state championship in 2022. They competed in everything. Chores. Games of “p-i-g.” Riding bikes.\n\n“We joke even now about how competitive we are with each other,” she said. “He’s always been my idol, always pushing me hard in school and in sports.”\n\nDuncan’s introduction to becoming a multi-sport athlete started at First Baptist Church, where she tried everything. She was the only girl on her baseball team. “I loved the atmosphere and community of sports,” she said. “It was always a nice getaway from actual life to sports life. Any sport, I tried it.”\n\nHer most competitive sport was soccer. She got into travel soccer, playing for highly-competitive programs Dynamo FC and FC Pride. Duncan played club soccer for 10-plus years and would have had opportunities to play in college. But when she was a sophomore, she made the decision to step away from club soccer.\n\n“That took a lot of maturity,” said Balch, who coached club soccer with Dynamo. “To still love the sport, she had to step away. She was still able to excel in basketball and track and maintain her GPA. I think leaving club soccer aside made her embrace five months of soccer as much as she could. If she changed her mind tomorrow, she could still play college soccer.”\n\nAs much as she loves to compete, Duncan made up her mind that she wanted to focus on high school sports and then close that door when she got to college. That went into her decision to leave the club soccer scene.\n\n“I just wanted to focus on high school — academics and sports,” she said. “And just really to be there for my teams here and not focus on the other team over there. Even though I loved every year of doing club soccer, I just thought if I focused on this (at Chatard), I’d be able to thrive and succeed.”\n\nMission accomplished. Duncan was named all-City soccer all four years of high school and was a three-time selection to the all-Circle City Conference team. For her high school career, she had 35 goals and 21 assists.\n\n“Addy is one of the most coachable kids I’ve had the privilege of coaching,” Balch said. “We put her in so many different positions and you can put her anywhere and she will embrace it. The great thing about Addy is she’s always looking out for everybody on the team, whether that is a JV player, a freshman, whatever. She’s always reaching out and trying to make sure they feel like they are part of the program.”\n\nDuncan did not expect to compete in basketball when she started high school but ended up playing on two Class 3A regional title teams, averaging 5.9 points and 2.9 rebounds over two seasons.\n\n“I’m not really an offensive player, but I can always bring the defense,” she said. “I think if you ask any coach, they would say that. That’s kind of always been my role. I can go get rebounds and just focus on my role. I think if you focus on your role and what you bring to the table, your teammates will trust you. It’s all about trust in any sport.”\n\nDuncan did not run track until high school but fit in seamlessly as a four-year state finalist. She could have excelled in individual events, but prefers the team aspect of the relays. Her 4x400 team and 4x100 team will both compete in the state meet on Friday in Bloomington. The 4x400 team of herself, Lena Stickel, Reese McKinney and Mary Kate Felts put up the fifth-best time in the state and won the regional.\n\n“I love the relays,” she said. “I’ve done some open events but they aren’t as rewarding as the team events.”\n\nJohn Schaffner, who coaches the Chatard sprinters, said Duncan’s “consistency, work ethic and dedication” are qualities that shine in all areas of her life.\n\n“She’s been a source of excellence and joy these last four years,” Schaffner said. “Not only as a track coach but as a teacher in the classroom.”\n\nDuncan, who carries a 4.35 GPA and academic all-state in three sports, will follow her brother to Purdue, where she plans to study veterinarian medicine. Since her freshman year she has worked part-time at a veterinarian clinic in Broad Ripple.\n\nHer goal, eventually, is to start her own veterinary practice.\n\n“It’s always been a childhood dream of mine,” she said of becoming a veterinarian. “My aunt is a vet tech, so I’ve been able to help out a couple of times a week and get introduced into the field, which is really cool.”\n\nDuncan said she already has plans to come back and see her soccer, basketball and track teammates next year at Chatard. She hopes to get involved in club sports at Purdue but is leaving Chatard with no regrets.\n\n“I love the community here,” she said. “I love my friends here, coming to school every day to see them. There are ups and downs but ultimately it’s always fun to look back on it and have a laugh or cry about it.”\n\nCall Star reporter Kyle Neddenriep at (317) 444-6649."
