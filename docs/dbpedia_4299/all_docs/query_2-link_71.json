        "text": "by Sheldon Rocha Leal\n\nEvery year I look forward to awards’ season to see who is going to rock up to the various ceremonies, what they are going to wear and who is going to perform. My favorite awards ceremony is The Grammies, possibly because I’m a musician and also because I love the collaborations that are organised every year. In a three hour period one gets to see some of the most iconic performers in the industry perform on the world’s greatest musical stage, on “music’s biggest night”. Ordinarily one would need to buy many tickets and dedicate various nights to see all these performers, do their thing, live on stage, but at the Grammies it all happens in the space of one night. The Emmy Awards, Critics Choice, BAFTA, SAG, People’s Choice, NAACP, Saturn, Juno, Screen Actors Guild, Oscars, Golden Globes, Grammy and Brit Awards all occur within the space of 3 months every year, hence “Awards Season”.\n\nPersonally I think the timing is great as it injects some much needed activity into an industry, which is notoriously dormant in the first months of the year. This is possibly something South African awards ceremonies should consider, instead of clustering awards towards the end of the year, which is our industries busiest time. Every year I write an article about the Grammy Awards, but this year I decided to interrogate soundtrack songs that have not only won a Grammy but also an Oscar and Golden Globe, two of the motion picture industry’s biggest awards. I love the idea that a musician can possess an Oscar and Golden Globe, which are often associated with actors and movie makers. The truth is music is an integral part of movie making and, therefore, these ceremonies have also included categories honouring the people that contribute music to movies.\n\nIn order to conduct my research I needed to establish when each one of the ceremonies were founded and when the Original Song from a Motion Picture category were introduced at each of the awards. Although the Oscars are the oldest of the three, being first introduced in 1929 (94 years ago), they only launched the Best Original Song written for a Motion Picture category in 1934. The truth is, I wasn’t going to need to go that far back. Whilst the Grammies were introduced in 1959 (64 years ago) and the Golden Globes in 1944 (79 years ago), the Globes only founded the Best Original Song category in 1961. I, therefore, only needed to trawl through 62 years of history to compile this article. To be eligible for the Best Original Song category a song needs to be written specifically for a motion picture, which means contenders cannot be covers or old songs included in a movie.\n\nThe Grammy Awards only introduced a Best Song Written for Visual Media category in 1988. Therefore, when compiling the content for this article I decided not to limit it to songs that only won the award in the Best Original Song Written for a Motion Picture category at the three different ceremonies. Consequently, the focus of this article is any song from a motion picture that has won a Golden Globe, Academy Award and Grammy. Reviewing the lists from the three different ceremonies I can report that since 1962, when the Globes introduced the Best Original Song category, it has only happened 22 times. If one drills down further, since the Grammy Awards launched the Best Song Written for Visual Media in 1988 it has happened 14 times that a song has won the Grammy as well as Golden Globe and Oscar.\n\nIn this article I will focus on 6 songwriters who have won the awards season Trifactor (Oscar, Golden Globe and Grammy Award). Some of these songs have taken it one step further with victories in the Best Song Written for Visual Media Grammy, Best Original Song Golden Globe and Academy Award. Disclaimer: these awards are awarded to the songwriter and not performer, unless the performer is also the songwriter. I will, therefore, also highlight the performer as their interpretation is part of a song’s success and as a result their input is an integral part of the creative process. Anyway here we go…\n\nBarbra Streisand\n\nBarbra Streisand has achieved the Trifactor with two of her songs, once as a songwriter and once as a performer. In actual fact, after the introduction of the Golden Globe for Best Original Song in 1961 a Barbra Streisand song was the first to receive a Grammy, Golden Globe and Academy Award. “The Way We Were”, is also the title of the movie from which it derives and was released in 1973, starring Streisand and Robert Redford and directed by Sydney Pollack. The movie is based on a book with the same title. The song was written by Marvin Hamlisch (who also wrote the score), Alan and Marilyn Bergman and was produced by Marty Paich. “The Way We Were” was originally commissioned by Streisand, but she wanted it written in a minor key. Marvin Hamlisch, however, wrote it in a major key not wanting to give away the message of the song.\n\nThe song was a commercial success peaking at No1 in the USA, No31 UK and shipping over 1million units in the USA alone. In 1974 (13 years after the category was introduced) the song won the Golden Globe, Academy Award and in 1975 completed the Trifactor by winning the Song of the Year Grammy. In 1977 Barbra repeated the performance with a song she co-wrote with Paul Williams. The song is titled “Evergreen (Love Theme From “A Star Is Born”)” and was featured in “A Star Is Born” co-starring Streisand and Kris Kristofferson. It peaked at No1 in the USA, No3 U.K. and shipped over 1,3million units worldwide. In 1977 it won the Golden Globe and Academy Award for Best Original Song and a year later shared the Song of the Year Grammy with “You Light Up My Life” written by Joe Brooks and performed by Debby Boone.\n\n“You Light Up My Life” was the theme song from a movie with the same title, released in 1977, and slated by critics. The only recognition it got was for the magnificently composed “You Light Up My Life” which went on to win the Oscar, Golden Globe and Grammy in 1978. The original vocal was recorded by Kasey Cisyk, but the version everyone knows is by Debby Boone released on her debut album, and not associated to the movie. Debby Boone, Pat Boone’s daughter, took the song to No1 in the USA for a record 10 weeks, making it the longest running No1 in US history. The record was broken when Boyz II Men’s “End of the Road” spent 13 weeks at No1 in 1992.\n\nIncidentally, Lady Gaga achieved the Trifactor in 2019 for the theme song of the fourth cinematic adaptation of “A Star Is Born”, which was originally released in 1937. That makes Barbra Streisand’s release in 1977 the third iteration of the story. “Shallow” was co-written by Gaga, Andrew Wyatt, Anthony Rossomando and Mark Ronson and produced by Benjamin Rice and Gaga. Lady Gaga and her team won the Golden Globe, Oscar and two Grammy Awards, one for Best Song Written for Visual Media and the other for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance, shared with Bradley Cooper.\n\nPaul Jabara\n\nPaul Jabara started his career as a theater actor, cast in the original production of “Hair” and originated the role of King Herod in “Jesus Christ Superstar”. He later appeared in a few movies and started writing music for other motion pictures. In 1977 he signed to Disco label Casablanca Records and released a solo album. This is when he met Queen of Disco, Donna Summer, which led to his accomplishment of the Trifactor. In 1978 Neil Bogart, owner of Casablanca, decided to get involved in movie making and produced a seminal movie in motion picture and music history, “Thank God It’s Friday”. The rise and success of Disco is attributed to two movies “Saturday Night Fever” (1977) and the former mentioned movie.\n\n“Thank God It’s Friday” featured Donna Summer and The Commodores in leading roles and although not a commercial or critical success was a Popular cult favorite. The theme song for the movie, “Last Dance”, was written by Paul Jabara, performed by Donna Summer and co-produced by Giorgio Moroder, Jabara and Bob Etsy. Giorgio, Donna’s mentor, didn’t want her to record the song, but Jabara locked Donna Summer in her Puerto Rican hotel room and forced her to listen to the demo. She fell in love with the song and recorded it. The iconic David Foster features on the track. The song went on to peak at No3 in the USA, No53 UK and in 1979 won the Golden Globe, Oscar and two Grammy Awards, one for Best R&B Song and the other for Best R&B Vocal by a Female Artist.\n\nGiorgio Moroder went on to win his own Trifactor in 1984 when his 1983 release “Flashdance…What A Feeling” won the Oscar, Golden Globe and the Grammy for Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Female Artist. The soundtrack for the movie “Flashdance” also won the Grammy Award for Best Album of Original Score Written for a Motion Picture. The song was written by Irene Cara, Keith Forsey and Giorgio Moroder and was a massive commercial success. It peaked at No1 USA, No2 UK and shipped nearly 4million units worldwide. Although the movie was critically slated it was a massive commercial success generating over $200million at the box office off a $7million budget.\n\nWill Jennings\n\nWill Jennings has written some amazing music, including “Tears In Heaven” with Eric Clapton, “Street Life” with Joe Sample for Randy Crawford and “I’ll Never Love This Way Again” for Dionne Warwick. He has achieved the Trifactor twice, the first time in 1983. “An Office And A Gentleman” starring Richard Gere and Debra Winger was released in 1982 to critical and commercial acclaim, generating $190million off a $7million budget. The theme song “Up Where We Belong”, was performed by Joe Cocker and Jennifer Warnes. Warnes had originally been approached to perform the theme by people representing the movie’s director, Taylor Hackford. Without anyone at the movie company knowing, he decided he wanted a song to cross-promote the movie. Jennifer, who had been a long time fan of Joe Cocker, since seeing him at the Woodstock Festival in 1969, recommended the singer as a duet partner.\n\nThe song written by Will Jennings, Jack Nitzche (the movie’s score composer) and Buffy Sainte-Marie, was a major commercial success, peaking at No1 USA, No 7 U.K. and shipping over 1,5million units internationally. In January 1983 it won the Golden Globe, followed by a Grammy for Best Pop Performance by a Duo of Group in February and the Oscar in April. Another Jennifer Warnes song, “(I’ve Had) The Time Of My Life” from “Dirty Dancing” starring Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey, won the Trifactor in 1988. That song was written by John DeNicola, Donald Markowitz and Franke Previte and was produced by Michael Lloyd. Jennifer Warnes’ duet partner on this song was Bill Medley of The Righteous Brothers. Because neither Bill or Jennifer wrote the song, they were not eligible for the awards. “(I’ve Had) The Time Of My Life” peaked at No1 USA, No6 UK and shipped over 1,7million units globally. The soundtrack is one of the biggest selling of all time, shipping over 32million units internationally. The song won the Oscar, Golden Globe and Grammy for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group.\n\nIn 1998 another Jennings song won the Trifactor. The movie was “Titanic”, the director was James Cameron and he did not want a theme song. He wanted the audience’s focus to be on his cinematic masterpiece. James Horner, co-songwriter of “My Heart Will Go On”, felt James Cameron would change his mind if he heard it. He approached Céline Dion to record it, but she wasn’t interested as James Horner had let her down 1991 when he’d approached her to record the theme for the “American Tail: Fieval Goes West” movie. At that stage she had been rejected by the movie’s producer, Steven Spielberg, because she wasn’t famous enough. Eventually René Angélil convinced Céline to record the song.\n\nThe movie went on to become the highest grossing movie of all time and the first to generate over a billion dollars. The soundtrack is considered one of the biggest selling of all time, having shipped over 27million units globally. The song was also an unmitigated commercial success. “My Heart Will Go On” peaked at No1 USA, UK and 25 other countries, shipping over 18million units worldwide. In 1998 it won the Golden Globe and Academy Award and in 1999 took home 4 Grammy Awards: Record and Song of the Year, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Best Song Written for Visual Media. This makes it one of the most comprehensive Trifactors as it won the Original Song Written for Visual Media category at all the ceremonies.\n\nCarly Simon\n\nWhen the Best Song Written for Visual Media was introduced at the Grammy Awards in 1988, Carly Simon was the first songwriter to win the Trifactor in all the visual song categories. Carly Simon started her career in the 1960s with her sister, Lucy Simon, in an act called The Simon Sisters. In the 1970s she went solo and that is when he star shon the brightest. When she was approached to write the theme song for “The Working Girl” soundtrack in 1988, she used the script and poems by the iconic American poet Walt Whitman as inspiration. She states that she wanted to write a hymn to New York, hence lyrics like “The New Jerusalem”. This hymn like quality is supported by her use of a choir in the song and the dynamic musical changes in the music. Furthermore there is a choral version of the song featuring The St Thomas Choir of Men and Boys of New York City.\n\nThe movie which starred Harrison Ford, Melanie Griffith and Sigourney Weaver was a commercial and critical success, generating $103million off a $28million budget. Although “Let The River Run” was a critical success, it did not burn up the charts, only peaking at No49 in the USA and No79 in the U.K. The song went on to win the 1989 Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Original Song written for a Motion Picture. In 1990 it won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media. Carly Simon holds the distinction of being one of a very few number of artists to win the Trifactor as an artist and solo songwriter. This is one of my all-time favorite songs. The message and music are so powerful and emotionally evocative. In the history of the Oscars only 10 artists have written and performed the song that has won the award.\n\nAlan Menken\n\nAlan Menken is of the most iconic songwriters and composers of all time. He was born on July 22, 1949, to a dentist father, who also played the piano, and an actress, dancer mother of Jewish descent. He showed an interest in music from a young age, composing and taking piano and violin lessons. His dream was to become the next Bob Dylan. Once he completed school he studied at New York University, graduating from the University College of Arts and Sciences in 1972. He originally wanted to be a recording artist or Rock star, but started his career at the BMI Musical Theatre Workshop, mentored by Lehman Engel, which is when he was inspired to start writing for musicals. He went on to meet Howard Ashman and wrote music for various musicals including “The Little Shop of Horrors”. Based on the success of the latter musical the two songwriters were hired in 1988 by Disney to write the music for “The Little Mermaid”.\n\nThe theme song for the movie, “Under The Sea” (performed by Samuel E Wright) garnered Ashman and Menken a Golden Globe, Academy Award in 1989 and in 1990 a Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media. The soundtrack for the movie also won the Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Original Score. This was the first time since 1964’s “Chim Chim Cher-ee” from “Mary Poppins”, that a Disney movie won an Oscar for Best Song and is the first of four Trifactors won by Alan Menken. Although the song did not chart it landed up shipping over 2.6million units in the USA and U.K. Two years later the men wrote the music for another Disney movie, “Beauty And The Beast”. The song was performed by Dame Angela Lansbury (who voiced the role of Mrs Potts in the movie), who initially did not want to perform the song as she felt she didn’t have the voice to carry some of the notes.\n\nFor the commercial release of the single Céline Dion was approached, but after being rejected for the “American Tail” movie, she was reluctant to put herself in the same position again. After hearing Dame Lansbury’s rendition she was inspired to record the song, which helped propel her to international stardom. The song and movie were a commercial and critical success. The movie generated over $400million off a $25million budget and the song, a duet with R&B singer Peabo Bryson, peaked at No9 USA and U.K. shipping over 1million units worldwide. In 1992 the Song and Score won the Oscar and Golden Globe and in 1993 two Grammy Awards for Best Song Written for Visual Media and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group. This song was the last Menken/Ashman collaboration, as Ashman passed away from AIDS related complications in 1991, which meant his family accepted the two Oscars, Golden Globes and Grammies on his behalf.\n\nA year later Alan Menken won the Trifactor for a third time, this time with a new songwriting partner, Tim Rice. The theme song for Disney’s “Aladdin”, “A Whole New World”, won the Oscars and Golden Globes for Best Original Song and Score Music in 1993. At the Grammy Awards the song, performed by R&B duo Regina Belle and Peabo Bryson, won two Grammy Awards: Song of the Year and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. The score music won an additional two Grammy Awards for Best Album for Children and Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media. The soundtrack version of the song was performed by Brad Kane and Lea Salonga. “A Whole New World” peaked at No1 USA, No12 UK and shipped over 3million units worldwide. The movie generated over $500million off a $28million budget.\n\nSir Tim Rice, also only one of 19 EGOTs in history, went on to add another Trifactor to his collection in 1995, when a song he co-wrote with Sir Elton John for another Disney movie, “The Lion King”, took the prize. Sir Elton became an EGOT in 2024. “Can You Feel The Love Tonight” peaked at No4 USA, No14 UK and shipped nearly 2,5million units worldwide. The soundtrack was a phenomenal success shipping nearly 20million units worldwide, with the movie generating $968million at the box office, off a $45million budget. “The Lion King” spin offs have earned Disney billions of dollars. In 1995 the song won the Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Original Song and Grammy for Best Pop Male Pop Vocal Performance. “Circle of Life” and “Hakuna Matata” from the movie were also nominated for Best Original Song at the Oscars. “Circle of Life” was additionally nominated for two Grammy Awards in 1995: Best Song Written for Visual Media and Song of the Year.\n\nAlan Menken attained the Trifactor for a fourth, and up to now final time, in 1996 for another Disney movie, “Pocahontas”. The movie was released in 1995 and documents the story of a Powhatan woman and the arrival of English settlers from the Virginia Company. The theme “Colours of the Wind” was originally performed by Judy Kuhn, who voiced the lead role, with the commercial release performed by former Miss USA, Vanessa Williams. After the passing of Howard Ashman, Disney were in the market to replace the composer with another partner for Alan Menken, so they reached out to Stephen Schwartz who had composed music for musicals on Broadway. The song peaked at No4 USA, No21 UK and shipped over 1million units globally. In 1996 it won the Oscar, Golden Globe and Grammy for Best Original Song Written for Visual Media/Motion Picture. The score music also won the Academy Award for Best Original Score.\n\nBillie Eilish\n\nBillie Eilish is only one of 29 acts who have written and performed a song that has won the Oscar and 32 who have won the Globe for Best Original Song and one of 22 to win the Grammy for Best Song Written for Visual Media. In 2019 after completing a concert at Ireland’s “Electric Picnic” they met the James Bond producer, Barbra Broccoli, who invited Billie and her brother, Finneas, to write the theme song for the upcoming Bond movie. The movie was the 25th in the James Bond franchise and after some writer’s block a demo was recorded, which was submitted to Hans Zimmer’s office, the movie’s score composer. The song was his favorite of the submissions and the siblings were invited to London to work with the maestro at Sir George Martin’s AIR studios with a 70 piece orchestra. The song is written by Billie Eilish, Finneas O’Connell, co-produced by Stephen Lipson and orchestrated by Hans Zimmer.\n\nOriginally I wasn’t a big fan of the song, but its minimalism started to grow on me. “No Time To Die” from “No Time To Die” peaked at No1 UK and No16 UK, shipping over 2.3million units worldwide. The movie, which was released in 2021, generated over $700million at the box office. In 2022 it won the Trifactor, amongst seven other awards, including the Critics’ Choice Award for Best Song. The movie in its entirety won 24 awards off 64 nominations including a BAFTA for Best Editing and Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Stunt Ensemble in a Motion Picture. For the 2024 season Billie and her brother won the Trifactor for a second time with the “Barbie Movie” theme song “What Was I Made For”.\n\nOther winner of the Trifactor include:\n\nBruce Springsteen: Streets of Philadelphia (1994), from “Philadelphia” the movie\n\nAnnie Lennox, Howard Shore and Fran Walsh: “Into The West” (2004), from “Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King”\n\nRyan Bingham and T Bone Burnett: “The Weary Kind, (Theme from “Crazy Heart”)” (2010/11)\n\nAdele and Paul Epworth: “Skyfall” (2013/14) from James Bond’s “Skyfall”\n\nJohn Legend, Common and Che Smith: “Glory” (2015/16) from “Selma”\n\nIn the 63 years history of the establishment of the Trifactor it has only been achieved 22 times, with the most recent win having taken place in the 2024 awards’ season, taken home by Billie Eilish and her brother Finneaa. The Trifactor has only ever been won more than once by six people. Those six individuals are Will Jennings, Alan Menken, Howard Ashman, Sir Tim Rice, Billie Eilish and Finneas. Alan Menken is clearly the king of the Trifactor having won it four times and even bettering it by winning the Best Original Score category at the Golden Globes and Academy Awards in three of those four occasions.\n\nIn total Alan Menken has won eight Oscars, seven Golden Globes and 11 Grammy Awards. Regarding the Best Original Song category at the Oscars the most wins in the category is 4 and it’s a four-way tie with Sammy Kahn, Johnny Mercer, Jimmy van Heusen and Alan Menken. At the Golden Globes Alan Menken rules the roost with four wins, his nearest competitor, with three wins, is Sir Tim Rice. Finally at the Grammy Awards Alan Menken is dominant in the Best Song Written for Visual Media category having won the award five times. Winning awards such as these is inspiring, alerting people to the vast array of career possibilities in the music industry and highlighting the fact that one does not to be a star to be a success in the music business. Happy viewing!!!"
