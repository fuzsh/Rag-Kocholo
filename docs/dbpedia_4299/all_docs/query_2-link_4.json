Chariots of Fire\n\nAcademy Award for Best Score Winners • Chariots of Fire Theme\n\nOnly one word comes to mind when I think of the Chariots of Fire soundtrack and that word is iconic. Over the years, Vangelis’ music from Chariots of Fire has become a mainstay at the Olympic games.\n\nAlthough the soundtrack as a whole hasn’t aged as gracefully as some of its contemporaries, it still remains a fixture during moments of sports excellence and times of enduring achievement.\n\nOscar Original Score Winners\n\n19. Lawrence of Arabia\n\nBest Score Oscar Winners • Lawrence of Arabia Wins a Music Oscar\n\nLawrence of Arabia is a big, sweeping movie, and Maurice Jarre’s score plays an integral role in conveying its epic scope. Jarre won three Academy Awards for Best Original Score; for Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago, and Passage to India — but his work on Lawrence of Arabia remains his most iconic work.\n\nAcademy Award Winning Scores • Lawrence of Arabia Theme, Performed by the BBC Concert Orchestra\n\nAfter listening to Jarre’s score, you’ll never think about traversing the desert sands the same way again.\n\nAcademy Award for Best Original Score Winners\n\n18. The Devil and Daniel Webster\n\nBest Score Oscar Winners • The Devil and Daniel Webster, Performed by the London Symphonic\n\nYou’d be hard pressed to find many modern film composers who don’t cite Bernard Hermann among their greatest influencers. Hermann composed the scores to many of the greatest movies of all-time, like Citizen Kane, Vertigo and Taxi Driver.\n\nBut although Hermann received a lot of critical acclaim in his lifetime, he only won the Academy Award for Best Original Score once. He did receive four other nominations in the category: for Citizen Kane, Obsession, Anna and the King of Siam, and Taxi Driver.\n\nBest Original Score Oscar Winners\n\n17. The Hateful Eight\n\nAcademy Award for Best Score Winners • Ennio Morricone Wins Best Original Score\n\nEnnio Morricone’s Oscar win for Best Original Score was more than 70 years in the making. Someway, somehow, Morricone didn’t win for The Good the Bad and the Ugly, Cinema Paradiso, or The Untouchables — but he finally did for The Hateful Eight.\n\nAcademy Award Winning Scores • The Hateful Eight Soundtrack\n\nWe often wonder why certain individuals, like Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, were snubbed at the Oscars, but I’d argue that nobody has been snubbed more than Morricone. It was great to see him win the Academy Award for Best Original Score in 2016, four years prior to his death in 2020.\n\nOscar Original Score Winners\n\n16. The Lion King\n\nAcademy Award for Best Original Music Score • Hans Zimmer Wins Best Original Score\n\nDid you know that Hans Zimmer composed the score for The Lion King? Like the Hans Zimmer? Is it just me or is that completely insane?\n\nBest Score Oscar Winners • The Lion King Original Score\n\nThe Lion King soundtrack isn’t just awesome because of Zimmer’s compositions — Elton John and Jeremy Irons offer great performances as well.\n\nAcademy Award for Best Original Score Winners\n\n15. The Wizard of Oz\n\nAcademy Award Winning Scores • The Wizard of Oz Soundtrack Suite\n\nThe Wizard of Oz was responsible for a lot of innovation in the industry of movie-making — visually, narratively, and acoustically. Perhaps the most obvious groundbreaking facet of the film was its eye-catching use of Technicolor, but there’s a lot more to The Wizard of Oz than just that.\n\nHerbert Stothart’s score for The Wizard of Oz complimented Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg’s songs, such as “Over the Rainbow,” which also took home an Academy Award.\n\nOscar Original Score Winners\n\n14. The Best Years of Our Lives\n\nAcademy Award for Best Score Winners • The Best Years of Our Lives Soundtrack\n\nHugo Friedhofer’s score for The Best Years of Our Lives really added a needed layer of emotional resonance to the picture. That’s not to say that The Best Years of Our Lives was bad by any means. Quite the contrary, many critics regard it as one of legendary director William Wyler’s best.\n\nThe Best Years of Our Lives is a story about personal intimacy in the face of sweeping change. Friedhofer’s score communicates this mood to a tee.\n\nBest Original Score Oscar Winners\n\n13. The Adventures of Robin Hood\n\nBest Score Oscar Winners • The Adventures of Robin Hood, Performed by the John Wilson Orchestra\n\nErich Wolfgang Korngold is widely regarded by contemporary critics as one of the greatest film composers of all-time. Korngold wasn’t quite as prolific as the other titans of his era, like Alfred Newman and Max Steiner, but one could argue he’s been just as influential.\n\nThe Adventures of Robin Hood soundtrack created an adventurous and whimsical mood that’s come to be synonymous with its title character.\n\nAcademy Award for Best Original Score Winners\n\n12. Jaws\n\nAcademy Award Winning Scores • John Williams Wins Best Original Score for Jaws\n\nJohn Williams is going to appear more than once on this list, simply because his body of work is so good. Williams won his second Oscar for Best Original Score for Jaws four years after he won for Fiddler on the Roof.\n\nAcademy Award for Best Score Winners • Jaws Theme Song\n\nIf you want to learn more about leitmotifs, look no further than the iconic, low-hum Jaws theme song. Everytime we hear that theme, we know there’s a shark lurking in the water.\n\nOscar Original Score Winners\n\n11. Titanic\n\nBest Score Winners • James Horner Wins the Academy Award for Best Original Score\n\nPeople love the Titanic soundtrack. And when I say love, I mean really, really love the Titanic soundtrack. The appropriately titled “Titanic: Music from the Motion Picture” soundtrack sold over 30 million units worldwide!\n\nBest Score Oscar Winners • Titanic ‘Hymn to the Sea’\n\nThe Titanic soundtrack wasn’t just a hit with the public either — critics adored it as well. Horner also won the Oscar for Best Original Song for the film's most enduring theme “My Heart Will Go On.”\n\nAcademy Award for Best Original Score Winners\n\n10. Breakfast at Tiffany’s\n\nBest Score Winners • Henry Mancini Wins Best Song\n\nHenry Mancini won the Academy Award for Best Original Score, as well as the Academy Award for Best Song for his work on Breakfast at Tiffany’s.

Let it Be\n\nBest Original Score Oscar Winners • The Beatles Win the Academy Award for Best Original Score\n\nHow could we not put The Beatles on the list?

How the West Was Won\n\nBest Score Oscar Winners • How the West Was Won Soundtrack\n\nAlfred Newman was like the Mozart of film composers. At the age of 13, he travelled the world as part of a vaudeville act. By 30, he had conquered Broadway and moved to Hollywood.\n\nWe often say that an artist is prolific if they put out a “full-length” work each year — Alfred Newman gave new meaning to the word prolific. In less than 40 years in Hollywood, Newman composed more than 200 original scores! He was nominated for 45 Academy Awards and won nine.\n\nAcademy Award for Best Original Score Winners\n\n7. Up\n\nBest Score Winners • Up Soundtrack\n\nMichael Giacchino has quite the resumé, having created iconic scores for projects like Lost, Ratatouille, The Incredibles, Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, Star Trek, Rogue One… We could go on. Giacchino won the top award in his field, however, for Up, and deservedly so.\n\nThink of the oft-cited opening montage of the Pixar film. It’s a tear-jerker for many reasons, but for our money, the biggest reason is because of “Married Life,” the utterly heartbreaking piece by Giacchino.\n\nGiacchino’s score nails the wistful, nostalgic, innocent, and melancholy emotions present throughout Up. It’s a masterful work, and it’s not even his best– that award goes to The Incredibles.\n\nOscar Best Film Scores\n\n6. La La Land\n\nOscar Best Film Scores • La La Land Opening Number\n\nThe 2010’s were a great decade for the Best Original Score category at the Oscars — and perhaps no score is more emblematic of this period’s boundless creativity than Justin Hurwitz’ La La Land.\n\nDirector Damien Chazelle deserves a lot of credit for the excellent La La Land soundtrack as well. Hurwitz and Chazelle have worked together since they made Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench in 2009. It’s safe to say that the duo bring out the best creative aspects of each other.\n\nAcademy Award for Best Original Score Winners\n\n5. The Godfather Part II\n\nBest Original Score Oscar Winners • Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola Win Best Original Score for The Godfather Part II\n\nNino Rota is one of the most underappreciated film composers of all-time. Although he produced a lot of acclaimed scores, especially for his friend and collaborator Federico Fellini, he was only nominated for two Academy Awards. Actually, he was only nominated for one — his nomination for The Godfather was rescinded because it included previously produced material.\n\nAcademy Award for Best Score • The Godfather Part II Soundtrack Suite\n\nNonetheless, Rota finally received the recognition he deserved for composing the score to The Godfather Part II — which was conducted by Francis Ford Coppola’s father Carmine Coppola.\n\nBest Original Score Oscar Winners\n\n4. The Shape of Water\n\nBest Score Oscar Winners • You’ll Never Know ft. Renee Fleming\n\nFull disclosure: I don’t like The Shape of Water. The whole monster love allegory just doesn’t sit right with me. Is the fish-man really sentient? Seems like a stretch to me. That said, I love The Shape of Water soundtrack from Alexandre Desplat — I mean, how could you not?\n\nDesplat is one of the greatest composers in the world. Over his career, Desplat has been nominated for nine Oscars and won two; one for The Shape of Water, and one for The Grand Budapest Hotel.\n\nAcademy Award for Best Original Score Winners\n\n3. Star Wars\n\nBest Original Score Oscar Winners • John Williams Wins Best Original Score for Star Wars\n\nJohn Williams had to beat out some tough competition in 1978 to win the Academy Award for Best Original Score, including… himself? Ah, yes Williams was so acclaimed in ‘78 that he was nominated twice, for Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\n\nAcademy Award for Best Score • Star Wars Theme Song\n\nThe importance and influence of Williams’ score for Star Wars can’t be quantified. Had it been released a year earlier, it probably would’ve been included in the Voyager Golden Record, floating into galaxies far, far away.\n\nAcademy Award for Best Original Score Winners\n\n1. Schindler’s List\n\nOscar Best Film Scores • John Williams Wins Best Original Score for Schindler’s List\n\nIf you ever need a good cry, just turn on John Williams soundtrack to Schindler’s List and let the waterworks flow. There’s simply no denying that Williams' score for the film is akin to the great works of Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven.\n\nBest Original Score Oscar Winners • Schindler’s List Theme Song\n\nNo adjective can do the score justice — but I will say that it’s intoxicating, arresting, haunting, and defyingly resolute.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nAcademy Award for Best Original Song\n\nThe Academy Award for Best Original Score is a great honor — but did you know there’s a separate Academy Award for Best Original Song too?
