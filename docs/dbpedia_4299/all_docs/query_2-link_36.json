        "text": "As I was watching the 2010 Academy Awards show last night, I always look forward to the award presentation for the Original Score. Michael Giacchino won the Oscar for the movie Up. One thing I noticed as I was comparing the various works was that the music from Up had a stronger melodic presence. The piece they played was in 3/4 and reminded me of something I would hear performed in Vienna.\n\nLately, as I watch various movie trailers, it seems, at least to me, that they all are sounding the same. Mainly some strings with a bunch of large drum hits and cymbal crashes. Maybe I'm being too critical here, but it seems that one score could be used across many movies -- they are all starting to sound the same. The score from Up seemed more unique and lyrical.\n\nI was wondering how the rest of you felt.........\n\n@aural said:\n\nin my opinion the awards for best score have developed in the last couple of years to a travesty.\n\nI started to loose faith back in 2005 when John Williams had two nominations, one for Munich and one for Memoirs of a Geisha. Both I felt were good but Memoirs featuring Yo-Yo Ma on Cello and Itzhak Perlman on Violin was fabulous -- only to loose to Broke Back Mountain.\n\nGo figure.......\n\nAnd the winner for Best Original Song was... \"It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp.\" I couldn't think of a more brilliant intellectual contribution to western civilized culture then, \"it's Hard Out Here for a Pimp.\"\n\nBut seriously, I think perhaps the academy has finally realized that nobody's watching anymore, so they started nominating works that don't offend particular groups of people through radical activism or insult the intelligence of the masses like they did in the past.\n\n@aural said:\n\nthe \"ordinary\" audience has not the slightest clue about music. they don´t even recognize there is one.\n\nand i wonder how good writing can be offensive...\n\nInteresting point Aural,\n\nI know from personal experience that what your saying about the audience (we'll say general) has not the slightest clue about the music. I believe many take it for granted and the truth be known, many emotions that may be felt while watching a movie, are many times, the result of the music more so than the story line itself.\n\nYou might find this a bit strange, but while watching the Titanic with my wife at the theater when it was first released, I found myself getting emotional during some of the scenes. I'd look over at her while wiping the tear from my eyes, and she was motionless. I thought \"what's up with me?\". A few weeks later I purchased the soundtrack and while listening to it in the car on the way to work, the tears began again.\n\nI now believe that it was certain passages of the score being played had more influence on bringing out my emotions than the storyline itself. Ever since then, I find myself paying more attention to the score many times than the storyline itself. I've also noticed that if a particular trailer has a great track playing, I will be more likely to watch the movie than something that is cheesy. But that's just me......\n\n@jasensmith said:\n\nBut seriously, I think perhaps the academy has finally realized that nobody's watching anymore...\n\nI hear people make comments like this a lot. I assume you're probably being hyperbolic, but it should still be pointed out that over 30 million people watched this year. Sure, that's down a fair amount from the peak years (and up a bit from last year), but it will still be one of the top rated shows of the year.\n\nPersonally, I think people tend to romanticize Oscar's past. The show has almost always been pretty dull, and the awards have often missed the mark in all categories.\n\nI'm glad Giacchino won and thought his score was way more interesting and original than the other nominees I've heard. I can't think of many that can match his versatility.\n\n@aural said:\n\nand i wonder how good writing can be offensive...\n\nSurely you're not referring to, \"It's Hard Out There for a Pimp?\" Let me be clear, I have nothing against Hip Hop music, in fact I think artists like Alicea Keys and Beyonce are very talented and deserve recognition, but IMO the Academy chose this song purely for political reasons. It was a case of, 'we don't have enough Hip Hop music on our winner's list and we want to be more diverse.' In reality, it should never have been nominated.\n\nThis is the problem I've had with the Academy Awards in the past and I think that's why the ratings for the show have dropped so much. What I meant when I said, \"insult the intelligence of the masses\" is I think the masses are smart enough to know that the Academy was acknowledging works that filled some kind of political correctness void instead of recognizing the best talent so the masses just got tired of the same ol' same ol.'\n\nAnd what was with all of the political activism in the past? People who live and work in fantasyland getting up on a stage and bagging their political drums about the war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan, the fight against the big greedy corporations, gay rights, Save the Shrimp, etc. Whether one agrees or disagrees with these positions they have no place at an Academy Awards Show. Now I don't know how Europeans feel about it but the Academy Awards Show is as much an integral part of Americana as the Superbowl, apple pie and the World Series. It's an American cultural icon and this proud card carrying member of the usual Joetheplumbermovie goer doesn't want to see the show tarnished with political correctness and political commentary. There is a time and place for that and it's not at the Academy Awards Show.\n\nFor the record, I did watch some of this year's show but only because my wife is Peruvian and The Academy Awards is a big deal in Peru especially since one of their own was nominated for Best Foriegn Film. It's ironic how the show is huge in other parts of the world but kind of just hum drum here in the states. I'm wondering how many of those 30 million viewers were international. Also, for the record, I did enjoy the parts of the show that I saw. It looks like the academy is at a turning point. Maybe I'll start watching again.\n\nI know this thread has moved on, but I just wanted to toss my agreement in with Chuck Green that the \"Titanic\" score was memorable. It seemed to go perfectly with the sea, with just the right amount of melancholy to produce that emotional response.\n\nI kind of miss the soundtracks from the nineties. John Williams--\"Angelas Ashes\" Hans Zimmer--\"Beyond Rangoon\" John Barry \"Dances with Wolves\" James Newton Howard-- \"Snow Falling on Cedars.\" There was a fresh lyricism & vibrancy then. These days there seems more reliance on the big hit chase scene cues, which often do sound the same, at least to my ears. I've bought a lot of soundtracks in the past five or six years that I only listen to a few times. I realize you can't really appreciate one's work if you don't really give it a fair listen, but so often there seems nothing that pulls me in and gets me to keep playing.\n\nI'll take a listen to \"Up.\" Any other recommendations out there?\n\nAll best, Tom"
