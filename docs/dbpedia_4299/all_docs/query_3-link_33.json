        "text": "Academic Civic Engagement\n\nDr. Tyshaneka Saffold (assistant professor, nursing)\n\nDr. Saffold is a passionate advocate for improving the health of residents in Camden, NJ, and surrounding communities. She has established significant relationships with community partners, working collaboratively to ensure adequate care for residents, which provides her students with invaluable opportunities to learn how to provide culturally sensitive care for underserved communities. She volunteers her time providing a range of health education workshops focused on unplanned pregnancy prevention and contraception use, healthy eating, physical activity, cancer screenings, and self-management of chronic diseases. Her work in Camden, which has deeply connected her to The Branches and Ablett Village apartment complexes, provides her with an opportunity to connect with residents directly about their cares and concerns. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Saffold was influential in educating minority communities about the virus and the importance of vaccinations. She made it her personal mission to debunk myths and provide accurate information, volunteering at vaccination clinics, making appointments for community members, and presenting at local events for Q and A sessions.\n\nNew Jersey Innocence Project\n\nNakea Barksdale SAS’16, CLAW’21\n\nProf. Laura Cohen (distinguished clinical professor, law)\n\nMariel Delacruz, GSC’18\n\nProf. Jill Friedman (associate dean, law school)\n\nProf. Kimberlee Moran (associate teaching professor, chemistry)\n\nDr. Sara Beth Plummer (assistant teaching professor)\n\nDr. Jane Siegel (associate dean for undergraduate education)\n\nNyssa Taylor (managing staff attorney, law school)\n\nA multidisciplinary project embedded in the Law School’s Criminal and Youth Justice Clinic, the mission of NJ Innocence Project (NJIP) is to seek exoneration, release from imprisonment, and restoration to society of innocent people who were wrongly convicted. Realizing that New Jersey was the only state without an innocence organization affiliated with the national Innocence network in New York, a cross collaboration of faculty and students from law, social work, and criminal justice led by Professor Kimberlee Moran, an associate professor who studies forensics, came together in 2017 to map out a strategy to develop a project at Rutgers, which came to fruition in September 2022. With racial justice at the core of the project, the team, led by managing attorney Nyssa Taylor, provides practical training and experience to students in the fields of law, criminal justice, forensic science, and social work, engages in research, and advocates, when needed, to address systemic causes of wrongful convictions. With an advisory committee comprised of diverse stakeholders, including exonerees, NJIP also offers public programming to increase awareness and further support the exoneree community.\n\nSNC–CARES\n\nCarlie Ale (assistant director)\n\nRobin Lundell (administrative assistant)\n\nPenny Mancini (administrative assistant)\n\nMelanie Palm (assistant dean III/advisor)\n\nJonathan Smith (assistant dean III/advisor)\n\nDr. Margo Wallace (director)\n\nThe SNC-CARES team works collaboratively to build relationships with a wide variety of clinical partners to provide undergraduate and graduate nursing students with hands-on learning experiences across the state and Delaware Valley. Sites include city health departments, public school districts, hospital systems, hospice care, rehabilitative centers, YMCAs, places of worship, food pantries, and homeless shelters. The SNC-CARES team works to secure and place students in clinical experiences where access to healthcare is most needed. The SNC-CARES unit worked to create the Rutgers School of Nursing Camden Health Clinic at St. Paul’s Church, a partnership with St. Paul’s to serve Camden’s most vulnerable unhoused neighbors. This clinic provides nursing services for the guests of the church that come for a meal on Sunday mornings. Recently, the SNC-CARES team partnered with Vineland Public School District to have nursing students perform wellness physicals for the students each school year. This is in addition to the health education and annual wellness assessments conducted for the Camden, Cherry Hill, and West Deptford school systems. The team maintains a partnership with the Camden Department of Health to place students in clinics responsible for vaccinations and screening for sexually transmitted infections. All these partnerships would not be possible without the clinical instructors hired by the SNC-CARES team to oversee the students in each experience.\n\nCommunity-Engaged Scholarship\n\nDr. Kendra Boyd (assistant professor, history)\n\nDr. Kendra Boyd is being awarded for her research with the Black Camden Oral History Project. Dr. Boyd has been deeply involved with efforts to diversify the historical narratives of Rutgers University and New Jersey. She co-edited Scarlet and Black, Volume Two: Making Race and Gender at Rutgers, 1865-1945 (Rutgers University Press, 2020), which won the 2022 Author Award from the New Jersey Studies Academic Alliance (NJSAA). She also co-authored two chapters of Scarlet and Black, Volume 1: Slavery and Dispossession in Rutgers History. Building on her expertise of Black New Jersey history, she established the Black Camden Oral History Project in 2021. The Black Camden Oral History Project aims to preserve the history of African American life, activism, and entrepreneurship in Camden, NJ. This project is inspired by Black Power-era student activists at Rutgers–Camden, whose courageous protest actions in 1969 changed the course of history at the university. In addition to recording interviews with these student activists, the project works to preserve a broader range of memories about Camden’s African American community. By engaging community-based knowledge, the Black Camden Oral History Project is helping to preserve the under documented and understudied history of Camden, an important community in New Jersey and the nation.\n\nDr. Nathan Link (assistant professor, criminal justice)\n\nDr. Nathan Link is being awarded for research that exemplifies and reflects the concerns about the ramifications of justice system involvement on individuals. His work on the burdens of court fines and fees on individuals on probation or parole is considered seminal and paradigm shifting. Two current projects in Camden and Philadelphia stand out as particularly noteworthy examples of his engaged scholarship. In the first, Dr Link secured a $1.5 million dollar grant from Arnold Ventures to study the impacts that eliminating court fines and fees have on disadvantaged populations going through Philadelphia’s key criminal diversion program. In the second project, Dr. Link and colleagues secured funding from the William T. Grant Foundation to investigate the impacts of the recent cannabis legalization on Camden area youth and young adults. The project specifically examines how the new law changes (or, hopefully, ameliorates) racial disparities in arrest, with a particular focus on young Black men and women. A portion of the funding will be used to support a new local non-profit called The Hub that will aim to provide a welcoming space for youth to receive wraparound services, with an emphasis on employment training and facilitating educational and employment applications for young men and women.\n\nStudent Civic Engagement\n\nMatthew Brodsky (political science)\n\nMathew is the student lead of the RUC Votes Coalition, a nonpartisan student organization focused on promoting civic engagement on campus. The coalition participated in the NJ Ballot bowl, a competition where colleges compete to get the most voter registrations and pledges to vote. Thanks to the efforts of the coalition, Rutgers–Camden won the Ballot Bowl for 2022. He is also a leader in the Bonner Civic Scholars program, where he partners with the District Council Collaborative Board (DCCB) to assist them with their public safety efforts. Matthew is the executive representative of Student Government Association (SGA), where he actively advocates for student issues on campus. He also sits on student advisory committees for Associate Dean Jane Siegel and President Jonathan Holloway.\n\nE Lev Feinman (childhood studies)\n\nFor the past four years, E Lev Feinman, a Ph.D. student in Childhood Studies, has been an integral part of creating a safe, inclusive, and intentional community as a volunteer with Camp Brave Trails, a sleepaway camp for LGBTQ+ youth. More than a camp, this safe space provides youth and their families with services and community-building programming throughout the year. As a queer and trans person whose academic research centers on queer and trans youth, E is passionate about their work with Brave Trails and the LGBTQ+ youth and families they serve. Recently, E has brought their academic interests in queer and trans childhoods to their service work by developing and leading workshops on trans youth history, adapting important trans studies research into lesson plans that are accessible and appropriate for 12 through 18-year-olds. In addition to their volunteer work with Brave Trails, E has independently fundraised over $625,000 to support Brave Trails programming. This funding supports scholarships for kids of color who need assistance to attend camp, stipends for volunteers and staff of color, arts programming, and the construction of an accessible swimming pool with gender-neutral changing areas.\n\nZaniya Lewis (law)\n\nZaniya Lewis is a second-year law student, Social Justice Scholar, and founder, CEO, and executive director of YesSheCanCampaign, a non-profit organization that has helped students win over $700,000 in funding for their education. In 2021, YesSheCanCampaign launched DISSCHOLARED, an award-winning ed-technology platform that spreads awareness about scholarship award displacement. Scholarship award displacement is when one form of student financial aid (i.e., a private scholarship, external scholarship, or outside scholarship) replaces another form of student financial aid (for example, an institutional scholarship or institutional grant). Scholarship award displacement is one of the root causes contributing to the student loan debt crisis. Zaniya has used her personal story to spread awareness about scholarship award displacement through YesSheCanCampaign. Inspired by her story, the New Jersey legislature created S985 legislation to restrict scholarship award displacement. In September 2021, Governor Murphy signed S985 into law, making New Jersey the second state in the nation to outlaw this practice. Her advocacy inspired The Helping Students Plan for College Act 2021, the first-ever federal bill to address scholarship award displacement nationwide. Her organization's advocacy inspired four states to outlaw this practice, and NJ recently introduced an amendment bill to expand the ban on scholarship award displacement to all institutions of higher education and proprietary institutions.\n\nAiman Nadeem (biology)\n\nAiman Nadeem is a student leader who has developed multiple initiatives while at Rutgers-Camden to encourage student learning and connection. STEM Olympiad was launched in fall 2022 with the goal of having an annual event where Rutgers–Camden students gather with students from other colleges and universities to gain exposure to different STEM subjects in a fun environment outside of the classroom. Additionally, Aiman created the Intramural Sports Advisory Board to bring casual sports to campus to help not only foster a healthy lifestyle but also to help reconnect students when they returned to campus after the COVID-19 pandemic. Aiman is a senator of CCAS in the Student Governing Association (SGA) and is also working on two research projects currently. With Dr. Andrey Grigoriev, Aiman is studying multiple myeloma, a form of cancer, and the genes involved in its tumor development. With Dr. Angélica González, Aiman is studying how global change factors are affecting diseases in wild plants.\n\nKeyann’a Watkins (business)\n\nKeyann’a serves as coordinator of volunteers for Camden Mayor Victor Carstarphen. From community clean ups to Thanksgiving food drives and Christmas toy drives, to finding volunteers for Camden’s first STEM Fest, bringing all-day STEM fun and exploration to Camden youth, Keyann’a has made sure that Rutgers–Camden is a partner in all Mayor Carstarphen’s volunteer activities. She works hard to connect the corporations, businesses, and non-profit leaders in Camden, as well as residents and community leaders, to volunteer opportunities to help change the perception of Camden. She is very active in connecting Rutgers students with the Camden community and goes out of her way to connect students who are looking for positive ways to get involved in Camden. Keyann’a is vice president of the Student Government Association (SGA) and is deeply committed to civic engagement.\n\nFaculty/Staff Community Service\n\nDenise Higgins Bonifanti (staff attorney, law school)\n\nOver many years, Denise Higgins Bonifanti has served as an adjunct professor, staff attorney, and program director at Rutgers Law School, teaching clinical law students how to represent survivors of domestic violence and running the Domestic Violence pro bono project, whereby law students volunteer their time at the courthouse and on a hotline to explain the process of getting a restraining order. Most recently, in addition to running the DV Project, Denise took tremendous and energetic leadership in seeking justice for women who had been sexually harassed, abused, assaulted, and raped in custody at New Jersey’s women’s prison, Edna Mahan Correctional Facility. Conservatively Denise provided close to 400 hours of support, training law students to assist the women who had been incarcerated at EMCFW and were seeking civil damages and supervising law students who interviewed and counseled the scores of women who were still in custody at EMCFW and eligible for compensation. Demonstrating the significance of the work, Denise’s own words in a recent Rutgers Targum article are illuminating: “What I fear is that [the settlement’s completion] means everyone’s going to stop talking about it,\" Higgins said. \"It's not over if there are still things that are happening in the prison, [and] it's still not safe for the women that are there … We need to keep talking about it, we really need to keep pushing for more oversight and shining a light.\"\n\nMichael D’Italia (director, experiential learning)\n\nMichael embodies what it means to be dedicated to the work of community service and civic engagement, both within and outside the campus. From his time when he was the Director of Community Outreach at the Neighborhood Center, to when he was Engaged Civic Learning Program Coordinator in the Office of Civic Engagement, to now being the Director of Experiential Learning and Chancellor's Experiential Learning Fund, Michael has been deeply rooted in and connected to the city of Camden, its grassroots leaders, and the nonprofit community. Beyond his work hours, Michael makes himself available to community leaders to learn about their work and their goals, providing his expertise and support when he can, and ensures that the voices of residents and community leaders are sought, valued, and heard in all aspects of Rutgers-Camden civic and community engagement initiatives. He works hard to educate students and faculty on best practices in engagement so they are prepared to work alongside leaders within Camden to enact positive change. Michael is a dedicated public servant focused on making a meaningful change in the students he engages with, the community partnerships he builds, and the relationships he fosters across his day-to-day work, both on and off campus.\n\nAlumni Civic Engagement\n\nAtnre Alleyne CCAS’06, GSC’07 and Tatiana Poladko Alleyne GSC’07\n\nTatiana and Atnre met at Rutgers–Camden in 2005 while working at the Senator Walter Rand Institute for Public Affairs. They married at Rutgers Gardens in New Brunswick in 2007 and, in 2009, co-founded TeenSHARP, a nonprofit organization that helps Black and Latino students from underserved communities in New Jersey and Delaware get accepted to and succeed at top universities. In January 2021, Tatiana and Atnre relocated their family of five to Ukraine, Tatiana’s home country, and continued to operate their nonprofit from abroad. Life was good until February 27, 2022, when Atnre and Tatiana left their home outside Kyiv, heading west with their three children and Tatiana’s father, due to Russia’s military siege of Ukraine. Even while the family made the risky week-long trek to Poland for safety, the couple continued to lead. Atnre hosted a virtual workshop from a hotel bathroom for more than 100 U.S. high school students who are part of TeenSHARP. Tatiana and Atnre’s devotion to leadership and service also extends to the Ukraine as the war continues. To date, the couple has raised $40,000 for humanitarian aid. They continue to run TeenSHARP and spread awareness about the war from their new home in Poland.\n\nCommunity partner Civic Engagement\n\nCampaign for Working Families\n\nThe Campaign for Working Families, Inc. (CWF) is a non-profit organization committed to helping working families and individuals achieve economic empowerment by providing free tax preparation, resource building, and asset development. Each year, CWF partners with Rutgers Law School in Camden and the Nilsa I. Cruz-Perez Downtown Branch of the Camden County Library System to provide tax return assistance to residents of Camden city and the surrounding communities. Prior to the partnership with CWF, the Rutgers Law VITA (Volunteers in Tax Assistance) Pro Bono Project was dependent on the varying levels of expertise and capabilities of changing student leadership. CWF’s continued presence and expert training and support are constants that keep VITA operational on an annual basis. The partnership with CWF and the library extends and strengthens the law school’s ability to provide tax services to low-income residents, both citizens and non-citizens.\n\nFood Bank of South Jersey\n\nThe Food Bank of South Jersey (FBSJ) exists to provide an immediate solution to the urgent problem of hunger by providing food to people in need, teaching them to eat nutritiously, and helping them to find sustainable ways to improve their lives. The FBSJ’s partnership with the Walter Rand Institute (WRI)has developed from evaluating the efficacy of the various food education and food security programs offered by the Food Bank to a multi-year partnership where WRI is working with FBSJ and Camden Coalition of Healthcare Partners to examine their efforts to address the complex factors that contribute to food security in Camden as part of the Camden Food Security Collective. The Collective, which engages faculty and staff from Rutgers–Camden and Rutgers–New Brunswick, was organized to address food security and the social determinants of health that affect and are affected by food insecurity. The goal is to develop shared measurements and metrics that will evaluate the success of initiatives and other actions by the Collective to improve the lives of Camden residents.\n\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion Leadership\n\nRoshauna Follett (public health AmeriCorps member)\n\nRoshauna Follett is a full-time Public Health Americorp Member who works within the Office of Social Justice and Belonging (OSJB). In Roshauna's role, she is dedicated to creating space for Rutgers–Camden students to feel heard and connected to the Camden community. Roshauna has created a mentorship program with several Camden area non-profits that connects Rutgers students to local youth in a mentorship setting. Roshauna has also worked hard to create opportunities for LGBTQ+ and BIPOC students to feel safe, welcomed, and heard on campus. During her time at Rutgers–Camden, Roshauna also developed multiple career networking opportunities for BIPOC students and alumni in various industries.\n\nProf. Stacy Hawkins (vice dean and professor, law)\n\nSince joining Rutgers, Professor Stacy Hawkins has been continuously engaged in efforts, through her service, teaching, and scholarship, to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion within our campus community and within the larger Rutgers community. Upon joining the faculty in 2010, she was asked by then Chancellor Wendell Pritchett to serve on the Chancellor’s Committee for Institutional Equity & Diversity (CIED), a committee dedicated to ensuring and promoting faculty diversity. She has served continuously on the CIED (and its successor committee). As co-chair, she led efforts to improve the processes for tracking faculty diversity by unit/department, helped secure a campus membership with the National Council on Faculty Development & Diversity, and advocated for the funding of “mini-grants” to support the retention and promotion of underrepresented faculty. Professor Hawkins is widely sought after as a professional diversity trainer, and in service to the university, has conducted training sessions for the Office of General Counsel and, most recently, for the Rutgers Board of Trustees. Finally, Professor Hawkins works to create and support an inclusive and equitable learning environment for students. Since 2010, she has offered an original seminar on diversity and the law, which has enrolled graduate students from across the campus. In 2021, Professor Hawkins was named a Senior Faculty Fellow of the Institute for the Study of Global Racial Justice and a Special Assistant for Academic Equity with the Division of Diversity, Inclusion, and Community Engagement for her role in leading an applied research project that brought a living-learning community for Black students to the campus (the first resource of its kind) that seeks to study its effects on student persistence and academic success.\n\nAcademic Diversity and Inclusion\n\nDr. Andrew Abeyta (assistant professor, psychology)\n\nDr. Andrew Abeyta, an assistant professor in the College of Arts and Sciences, developed a graduate cultural psychology course, currently teaches a cultural psychology undergraduate course, and helped revise the psychology curriculum to include a diversity course requirement. Dr. Abeyta has a strong record of mentoring students and has advised several students who presented at the Celebration for Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities (CURCA) and other professional conferences. He also helped students write and submit first-author papers for publication. One of his students won a diversity award to present his research at the 2023 International Society for the Science of Existential Psychology conference. His students have won competitive internal Rutgers research funding to conduct research on topics relevant to DEI, promoting belonging among first-generation students, encouraging meaning and purpose in life to promote student success. In addition, he frequently serves on faculty panels for first-generation and/or minority students for groups including EOF and TRiO and makes presentations to new students to promote belonging and to teach empirically supported strategies to help students adjust to college.\n\nDr. Silvia Perez-Cortes (assistant professor, Spanish)\n\nThe course “Multilingualism and Linguistic Minorities in the U.S.” was taught for the first time in fall 2022 by Dr. Silvia Perez-Cortes, an assistant professor in the World Languages and Cultures Department. Throughout the semester, students examined and discussed the political, social, and educational issues that relate to cultural and linguistic diversity in the U.S. Topics ranged from the (mis)representation of multiculturality and multilingualism in the media to the nature of past and present linguistic policies enacted in the country. The main goals of this course were to provide students with the tools to analyze how immigration has shaped the cultural and linguistic landscape of the United States over time and to reflect upon ideologies that foster (or deter) social and linguistic discrimination and inequalities. Students were encouraged to respectfully engage in critical conversations about language and race with their peers and examine controversial issues by taking an evidence-based and sociohistorical approach. By the end of the semester, students produced a project that resulted from their investigative work, connecting the topics of the course with current issues. Some examples included a study on the appropriation and commodification of African American English and Latino English by members outside these ethnolinguistic communities, linguistic discrimination in the justice system, and a proposal to introduce social justice issues in the K-12 curriculum.\n\nFaculty Research Award for Contributions Towards Diversity and Inclusion\n\nDr. Emily Marker (assistant professor, history)\n\nDr. Marker's latest book, Black France, White Europe: Youth, Race, and Belonging in the Postwar Era (Cornell UP, 2022), offers an historical and transnational perspective on contemporary debates about DEI and higher education across the Global North. The book shows that many hallmarks of DEI discourse today—as well as the backlash against it—date to the immediate postwar years. After the Second World War, France ostensibly embarked on not one, but two, unprecedented efforts to build new kinds of multicultural polities: the democratization of its African empire and the unification of Western Europe. Although these were radically different kinds of political projects, the architects of both looked to youth as the lynchpin of their visions, and they proposed strikingly similar initiatives: curricular and pedagogical reforms; youth and student exchanges; new textbooks; and specialized teacher-training programs. Based on extensive archival research in France, Belgium, Italy, and Senegal, Black France, White Europe explores how efforts to promote solidarity between French and African youth collided with efforts to make young Europeans feel more “European” after World War II. Dr. Marker argues that the way diversity and pluralism was construed in Europe fatally undermined the project to transform France and its empire into a new kind of multiracial democracy. She connects the vision of Europe that coalesced in postwar campaigns for European unity—which coded Europe as white and raceless—Christian and secular, to crucial decisions about what should be taught in African classrooms and how many scholarships should be provided for young Africans to study and train in France. That vision of Europe also informed French responses to African student activism for racial and religious equality, which ultimately turned many young francophone Africans away from France irrevocably. In these and other ways, Black France, White Europe shows that the entangled history of colonial and European youth initiatives is key to explaining why, despite France’s efforts to strengthen ties with its African colonies in the 1940s and 1950s, France became more European during precisely those years.\n\nDr. Briance Mascarenhas (professor, business) and Dr. S. Karti Puranam (assistant professor, business)\n\nProfessors Mascarenhas and Puranam have developed a multidisciplinary research program on algorithms in health care that will improve access and benefit more diverse stakeholders in many fields. Organizations are increasingly using algorithms to run their operations with the rise of computing and digitization. Algorithms, unfortunately, may have biases that favor privileged stakeholders at the expense of other stakeholders. These algorithms are typically adopted without external validation that they meet their intended purpose. The non-privileged stakeholders are unable to examine and remedy the algorithms because of data inaccessibility, opaque algorithm procedures, and their complexity. The researchers examined this widespread, intractable algorithm problem in the growing health care sector. Specifically, they examined the algorithm used to match more than 60,000 medical graduates to 30,000 residency positions in 4,000 programs annually. The intended purpose of the algorithm was to match students to residency positions based on student-prioritized preferences. Students, however, have long complained that the algorithm favors programs over students, but have not been able to prove it. Their study found that the algorithm’s matches utilized program inputs but not student inputs, contrary to its intended purpose. Their research also developed a new algorithm that better utilizes student preferences, matches more students to their most preferred programs, and provides a balance of influence across diverse stakeholders. They also developed a framework for assessing and improving an algorithm’s responsiveness to multiple stakeholders. In summary, the researchers disproved and revised the current algorithm, which will increase student access to their preferred programs, improve student-position fit, reduce resident stress and burnout, and deliver better health care to the public. More generally, their novel methods will help to verify and correct algorithms to improve diversity, inclusion, and equity among stakeholders in many settings.\n\nKelly Francis Prize"
