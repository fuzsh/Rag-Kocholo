        "text": "As of 2024, Disney has won a total of 150 Academy Awards, but the impressive number is that of these, 32 were won by Walt Disney personally. This is by far the record, and Walt Disney is listed in the Guinness World Records book for this distinction. (Second in line is Cedric Gibbons, the MGM art director, with 11 awards.) Most of Walt Disney’s awards came to him as producer of a film. He also won the prestigious Irving Thalberg Award, given by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Animated Disney characters have occasionally appeared on the Academy Awards show. While Minnie, Donald, and Daisy watched from the audience, Mickey Mouse interacted with Tom Selleck in 1988, an animated Belle and Beast appeared in 1992, Snow White was a guest in 1993, and Woody and Buzz Lightyear from Toy Story helped present an award in 1996. Mickey Mouse appeared again in 2003, as did Woody and Buzz in 2016. C-3PO, R2-D2, and BB-8 also appeared onstage in 2016. The use of a live Snow White in an uncomplimentary musical number with Rob Lowe in 1989 led to an immediate lawsuit by Disney, which was dropped after the Academy offered an apology.\n\nThe awards, listed by the year in which they were presented, are as follows:\n\n1932\n\n1)* Flowers and Trees (Cartoon Short Subject, 1931-32)\n\n2)* Special Award to Walt Disney for the creation of Mickey Mouse\n\n1934\n\n3)* Three Little Pigs (Cartoon Short Subject, 1932-33)\n\n1935\n\n4)* The Tortoise and the Hare (Cartoon Production, 1934)\n\n1936\n\n5)* Three Orphan Kittens (Cartoon Production, 1935)\n\n1937\n\n6)* The Country Cousin (Cartoon Short Subject, 1936)\n\n1938\n\n7)* The Old Mill (Cartoon Short Subject, 1937)\n\n8)* Top Technical Award to Walt Disney Productions for the design and application to production of the Multi-Plane Camera, 1937\n\n1939\n\n9)* Ferdinand the Bull (Cartoon Short Subject, 1938)\n\n10)* Special Award to Walt Disney for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs–recognized as a significant screen innovation which has charmed millions and pioneered a great new entertainment field for the motion picture cartoon\n\n1940\n\n11)* The Ugly Duckling (Cartoon Short Subject, 1939)\n\n1941\n\n12) Pinocchio (Song, 1940: “When You Wish Upon A Star” by Leigh Harline and Ned Washington)\n\n13) Pinocchio (Original Score, 1940, by Leigh Harline, Paul J.
