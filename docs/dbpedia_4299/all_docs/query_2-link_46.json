Additionally, George is the first member of the Osage Nation to be nominated for an Academy Award. Scorsese also makes history as he becomes the most-nominated living director, bringing his total to 10 total lifetime Academy Award nominations for Best Director.\n\nApple Original Films’ epic feature Napoleon, from Ridley Scott, earned three Academy Award nominations for Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, and Best Visual Effects.\n\n“Thank you to the Academy for these nominations that celebrate both Killers of the Flower Moon, Martin Scorsese’s powerful film that has moved and inspired audiences across the globe, and Ridley Scott’s spectacular epic Napoleon, two stories that illuminate the human experience,” said Zack Van Amburg, Apple’s head of Worldwide Video. “From the dynamic and complex performances of Lily Gladstone and Robert De Niro, and the gorgeous cinematography, design, editing, and soundscape that immersed viewers in the world of the Osage Nation, to the majestic costumes, sets, and visual effects that brought Napoleonic France to vibrant life on screen, it is wonderful to see so many members of these brilliant creative teams recognized today. We applaud you all.”\n\n“It has been such a rewarding experience to see the exceptional work of so many incredibly gifted artists from Killers of the Flower Moon and Napoleon nominated this morning,” said Jamie Erlicht, Apple’s head of Worldwide Video. “We are greatly appreciative to the Academy for these honors. At Apple, we are passionate about bringing stories to the screen that push creative boundaries and make a difference in our world, and we are thrilled for the recognition that has been given to these two special films with these nominations.”\n\nWith 13 nominations in total, Apple more than doubles its record for Academy Award nominations in a single year, and is among this year’s most-nominated studios since its launch just over four years ago.\n\nThis year’s historic Academy Award nominations for Killers of the Flower Moon follow Apple’s history-making wins at the 2022 Academy Awards, as CODA became the first motion picture starring a predominantly Deaf cast in leading roles to win Best Picture, and the first-ever film from a streaming service to land Best Picture. CODA star Troy Kotsur was the first Deaf male actor to win Best Supporting Actor, and writer-director Siân Heder landed her first-ever Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. In 2023, beloved Apple Original Film The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse won the Oscar for Best Animated Short Film.\n\nBroadly hailed as a “masterpiece,” Killers of the Flower Moon recently received nine BAFTA Film Award nominations, including Best Picture, and has been honored as the Best Film of the Year by the National Board of Review, which named star Lily Gladstone as Best Actress, Martin Scorsese as Best Director, and Rodrigo Prieto for Outstanding Achievement in Cinematography, as well as being named to the American Film Institute’s list of Motion Pictures of the Year. The film has also received over 200 accolades, in addition to recognition from over 30 critics groups globally, and has been named the No. 1 Best Film of 2023 by The New York Times and The New Yorker, and Best Film by the New York Film Critics Circle. Gladstone recently made history as the first Indigenous actress to win Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Motion Picture — Drama at the 81st Annual Golden Globe Awards. Killers of the Flower Moon is now streaming globally on Apple TV+ following its worldwide theatrical run.\n\nFollowing its debut in theaters, Napoleon has landed nominations from the BAFTA Film Awards, including Outstanding British Film, Costume Designers Guild Awards for Excellence in Period Film, Art Directors Guild for Excellence in Production Design for Period Film, and VES Award for Outstanding Supporting Visual Effects, among others.\n\nThe winners will be revealed at the 96th Academy Awards ceremony on Sunday, March 10, 2024.\n\nApple Original Films were nominated for 13 Academy Award nominations in total:\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon\n\nBest Picture\n\nBest Director: Martin Scorsese\n\nBest Actress in a Leading Role: Lily Gladstone\n\nBest Actor in a Supporting Role: Robert De Niro\n\nBest Costume Design: Jacqueline West\n\nBest Production Design: Jack Fisk, Adam Willis\n\nBest Original Score: Robbie Robertson\n\nBest Original Song: “Wahzhazhe (A Song for My People)” — Scott George\n\nBest Film Editing: Thelma Schoonmaker\n\nBest Cinematography: Rodrigo Prieto\n\nNapoleon\n\nBest Costume Design: Janty Yates, David Crossman\n\nBest Production Design: Arthur Max, Elli Griff\n\nBest Visual Effects: Charley Henley, Luc-Ewen Martin-Fenouillet, Simone Coco, and Neil Corbould\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon is set at the turn of the 20th century, when oil brought a fortune to the Osage Nation, who became some of the richest people in the world overnight. The wealth of these Native Americans immediately attracted white interlopers, who manipulated, extorted, and stole as much Osage money as they could before resorting to murder. Based on a true story and told through the improbable romance of Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Mollie Kyle (Lily Gladstone), Killers of the Flower Moon is an epic western crime saga, where real love crosses paths with unspeakable betrayal. Also starring Robert De Niro and Jesse Plemons, Killers of the Flower Moon is directed by Scorsese from a screenplay by Eric Roth and Scorsese, based on David Grann’s bestselling book.\n\nNapoleon\n\nNapoleon is a spectacle-filled action epic that details the checkered rise and fall of the iconic French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, played by Oscar winner Joaquin Phoenix. Against a stunning backdrop of large-scale filmmaking orchestrated by legendary director Ridley Scott, the film captures Bonaparte’s relentless journey to power through the prism of his addictive, volatile relationship with his one true love, Josephine, showcasing his visionary military and political tactics against some of the most dynamic practical battle sequences ever filmed.\n\nApple Original Films\n\nMomentum around the Apple Original Films slate continues to grow since the debut of Apple TV+ four years ago. In addition to Apple making history as the first streaming service to land the Academy Award for Best Picture with CODA, Apple Original Film The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse also recently earned the Academy Award for Best Animated Short, and recently debuted Napoleon, from director Ridley Scott, and The Family Plan starring Mark Wahlberg and Michelle Monaghan.\n\nUpcoming Apple Original Films include the star-studded spy thriller Argylle, with Henry Cavill, Sam Rockwell, Bryce Dallas Howard, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O’Hara, John Cena, Dua Lipa, Ariana DeBose, and Samuel L.
