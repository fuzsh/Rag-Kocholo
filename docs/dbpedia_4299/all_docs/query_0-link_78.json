        "text": "It’s The Recorder’s annual Oscar picks! We’ve divided up the categories and will be making our picks for in three different categories: Will Win, Should Win, Nightmare Win. As always, the Oscars are pretty silly at their base and we probably care more than we should. But that’s part of the fun!\n\nAlex\n\nOriginal Screenplay\n\nWill/Should Win – Spotlight\n\nThis category is all but tied up with a bow. Spotlight has been the front-runner for this award for months and will win it with ease. Good thing it’s a richly deserved award! Director Tom McCarthy and his co-writer Josh Singer created an exemplary piece of screenwriting. The script manages to tackle the topic of molestation with emotional force without ever falling into easy exploitation or sappy emotional manipulation. I was especially impressed with how the reporters’ personalities were revealed through their work and how a fact established early in the movie becomes devastating in the closing minutes. This screenplay will be used as a teaching tool for a long time.\n\nNightmare Win – ….None of These?\n\nWell, this is a first. I badly want Spotlight to win this category, but none of the nominated scripts would be an awful winner. I’m as surprised as you are.\n\nFilm Editing\n\nWill Win/Dream Win – Mad Max: Fury Road\n\nThis category is stacked with strong competition. The only movie that has no chance to win is Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Because of that, I am not terribly confident in this prediction. Spotlight is a exemplary piece of effectiveness, despite lacking any sort of flash. The journalists’ interviews with the victims do a particularly good job of landing gut-wrenching emotion without ever reveling in it. If you ever doubt how well-made this film is, just imagine David O. Russell directing it. The comparison should be jaw-dropping. The Revenant is a bad movie, but its production values are very strong. While its running time certainly could have been trimmed, its big action set-pieces are all edited impressively. The Big Short is heavily reliant on its frenetic editing for pace and tone. Without such showy work the humor and narrative would grind to a halt. If any of these last three should prevail it would be a strong sign that it’s winning Best Picture. Despite all of those qualified contenders, I have a hunch that the showiest entry will win. Normally, that would make me roll my eyes, but not for Mad Max. Its editing is par excellence and should take the gold.\n\nNightmare Win – Star Wars: The Force Awakens\n\nNothing against the editing in Star Wars, which is full of energy and had a few “awesome!” transitions. But it’s just not in the same class as the rest of this field.\n\nProduction Design\n\nWill Win – Mad Max: Fury Road\n\nHi, my name is Alex. I am apparently a huge Mad Max homer this year. Not that I’m complaining! The natural scenery, props, vehicles, and sets coalesce into a stunning and unified world. The aesthetic is some sort of post-apocalyptic punk rock, I guess. Feels outside the Academy’s wheel house, but it also feels undeniable.\n\nDream Win – The Revenant\n\nDespite hating this movie, this is a bit of a sentimental pick for me. Jack Fisk has been a world-class Production Designer since the 1970’s. He’s worked on iconic films like Carrie, Days of Heaven, The Thin Red Line, Mulholland Drive, The New World, There Will Be Blood, and The Master. Much of his work here is landscape selection and preparation, but the scattered villages and forts are impressive sets. Plus, The Revenant seems likely to win at least one tech awards besides Cinematography. Let is be here.\n\nNightmare Win – The Danish Girl\n\nThis movie is the very model of a modern major meh. No Oscars for it!\n\nCostume Design\n\nWill Win – The Revenant\n\nI’ll just call it a hunch. Those vast, bulky fur trapper outfits must have been a bear (zing!) to create, store, and transport to the remote shooting locations. They’re not as cosmetically flashy as the other nominees, but I can see filmmakers appreciating them.\n\nDream Win – Mad Max: Fury Road/Carol\n\nQuelle Surprise! These costumes were instantly iconic. You will see them at parties and parades for years. They’re obviously Oscar-worthy. That being said, the meticulously gorgeous costumes from Carol were instrumental to the film’s aesthetic and symbolic power. I’ll cheer for any Carol win, so why not here?\n\nNightmare Win – The Danish Girl\n\nSee the above about Production Design. It applies here.\n\nAndrew\n\nBest Director\n\nWill Win – …?\n\nI’m genuinely not sure who’s coming out on top in this category but I want to talk about something regarding directing with this year’s movies. One of the primary jobs of a director is to establish a tone and style that fits the movie both in terms of storytelling and of theme. All five of these directors fulfill the first part of the equation. Thomas McCarthy directed Spotlight in an invisible, realistic style that suits the step-by-step work of the storytelling and brings home the power of the subject matter by reminding us this really happened. Adam McKay’s hyper-edited, French New Wave/Tom Jones-esque work played up the frenzy of The Big Short. Lenny Abrahamson’s intimacy and close-framing until the final minutes perfectly fit the physically and mentally trapped characters of Room. And George Miller used grandiosity and sweeping takes with perfectly choreographed editing to make Mad Max: Fury Road full of action and a smart, cathartic commentary on how the world can be destroyed and redeemed.\n\nNightmare Win – Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu brought an intense style to The Revenant that played up the overwhelming power of nature…but this gigantic scale comes to naught when Inarritu decides the film is not about survival but revenge and guilt, and then makes choices in the final minutes that negate the possibility of an actual theme, leaving all of that bluster for nothing. I second Alex’s commentary above.\n\nShould Win – George Miller, who made an extraordinary film that was every bit as difficult to put together as The Revenant and succeeded everywhere Inarritu failed (including giving us lots of female characters who live and kick serious butt). But my honest answer is “anyone BUT Inarritu” because all of these films were great.\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay\n\nWill Win – The Big Short. Similar to Spotlight, Adam McKay and Charles Randolph have this one locked up for a smart, genuinely funny, delightfully fourth-wall-breaking saga that also gets surprisingly emotional. A film whose protagonists are identifiable and do plenty of despicable things is a challenge, and McKay and Randolph adapt Michael Lewis’s book with aplomb.\n\nShould Win – Room. Emma Donoghue took her own novel and put it on screen with a two-act structure, a lot of smart storytelling choices in terms of perspective and how people exit and enter the tale, and a world of characters with great dialogue and complex motivation. Especially in a year with few female nominees, Donoghue pulled off one of this year’s best pieces of work.\n\nNightmare Win – Again, None of These. This category was extremely strong. Nick Hornby’s sentimental Brooklyn, Phyllis Nagy’s understated and aching Carol, and Drew Goddard’s complex, clockwork-precise The Martian are all ideal screenplays in different ways as much as those two above.\n\nBest Original Score\n\nWill Win- Ennio Morricone, The Hateful Eight. He doesn’t have a competitive Oscar, his return to scoring both giant films and Westerns received a lot of buzz, and while the score isn’t his best (and draws on his themes from Exorcist II: The Heretic and The Thing), it is suitably menacing and full of the dark energy he brings to such projects.\n\nShould Win – Carter Burwell, Carol. Burwell wasn’t even nominated until this year despite a laudatory career ranging from his chameleon-like talent to score any Coen Brothers movie to his giant scores for The Twilight Saga. He’s one of the finest and most passionate composers in the film world (read his essays on his website for deep looks into the art of scoring) and Carol is one of his best, a gentle, romantic chamber piece full of haunting and tender themes.\n\nNightmare Win – Thomas Newman, Bridge of Spies. Newman stepped in when illness and Episode VII forced John Williams out, and he responds with a pale imitation of Williams tropes. It occasionally hits stirring heights when paired with Spielberg’s imagery but is forgettable otherwise. (Williams, by the way, is far from a nightmare win thanks to “Rey’s Theme.”)\n\nBest Original Song\n\nWill Win/Should Win – “Til It Happens To You” from The Hunting Ground. I think it’s a terrific song from a powerful movie, with Lady Gaga delivering one of her best vocals ever. But it is also a process of elimination. “Manta Ray” and “Simple Song No. 3” won’t even be performed during the ceremony in an annoying and unfair decision that suggests a kiss of death. “Earned It” probably won’t win because the Academy is probably reluctant to honor Fifty Shades of Grey. And finally…\n\nNightmare Win – “Writing’s On the Wall” from SPECTRE. I loved SPECTRE but this song stinks. Adele, like Shirley Bassey, brought a real drama and menace to “Skyfall” but her male counterpart Sam Smith has zero bite and one hundred percent sad, melodramatic moaning.\n\nSound Mixing and Sound Editing\n\nWill Win – Mad Max: Fury Road. It has the momentum on its side and it sounds terrific, the chases, the nature, the music blending together with no let-up until the finale.\n\nNightmare Win – The Revenant. See most of the above.\n\nShould Win – This is the one category where I wish write-in votes were possible. Mad Max should win, but so should 45 Years, which had a magnificent design that sneaks up on the viewer. Throughout the tale of domestic drama, a perfect mixture of radio music, household creaking and groaning, and wind and rain form a background of white noise that increases the story’s reality.\n\nTravis\n\nBest Actor\n\nWill Win – Leonardo DiCaprio, The Revenant. Leo’s due, and while I have a problem with the idea that “he who suffered the most should win an Oscar”, this falls into the second category of “long overdue”, which is how Martin Scorscese won for The Departed all those years ago. Suffering and going to extremes isn’t always the sign of dedicated acting – if anything, it’s a sign of supreme narcissism in the name of Art with a Capital A. Great acting is often done in subtle shades, and there is little subtlety to DiCaprio’s grunting and gnashing his way through the film that is The Revenant. (Ooh, he ate bison liver! How tremendous!) That kind of dedication to a role can lead to great things, sure…but it also leads to actors destroying themselves the way Heath Ledger did following The Dark Knight. At some point, there is a line.\n\nAll of which is irrelevant, as Leo stomps up on stage to claim a trophy he probably should have won back in Aught Nine.\n\nShould Win – Michael B. Jordan, Creed. Because God Forbid a black actor should be nominated in the Year of the Leo. (Runner-Up: …nope, I’ve got nothing. This was a weak year for male actors.)\n\nNightmare Win – Eddie Redmayne, The Danish Girl. Not like this, Oscar. Not like this.\n\nBest Actress\n\nAny other year, I’d be jumping for joy at how strong Best Actress is this year. And then, when you break it down as to the roles that the women nominated below are being recognized for as opposed to the men’s roles, it gives you pause. So there’s that to consider.\n\nNevertheless, this is handily the strongest of the Acting categories, so that’s some consolation in a year where #OscarsSoWhite is a thing.\n\nWill Win – Brie Larson, Room. The most emotive performance, the strongest performance, and the most deserving of the nominees. She’ll win, and I won’t have many arguments because the actor who should win wasn’t nominated.\n\nShould Win – Charlize Theron, Mad Max: Fury Road. Imperator Furiosa was a titan of action this summer, and this was one of the more egregious oversights of the year, I felt. Theron should have collected her second trophy this night. (Runner-Up – Cate Blanchett in Carol proves once again that she is right up there with Streep as a candidate for Greatest Living Actress.)\n\nNightmare Win – Charlotte Rampling, 45 Years. I don’t want to hear her have to explain away her comments about #OscarsSoWhite. Like, ever.\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nWill Win – Sylvester Stallone, Creed. People forget that Stallone can actually act. Granted, this is because of the gap between this performance and his last great performance in 1976. (Coincidentally, the last time he played Rocky Balboa.) This is a case of the establishment rewarding itself, and in a relatively weak year for this category…whatever.\n\nShould Win – Idris Elba, Beasts of No Nation. I’ve covered elsewhere why this was a disappointment, but Elba was the best thing about that movie. His final moment by the lakeside, when everything has crumbled beneath him, should have earned him at the very least a goddamn nomination. That’s why his winning the SAG was such a wonderful slap in the face. Because #OscarsSoWhite. (Runner-Up – Mark Rylance, Bridge of Spies.)\n\nNightmare Win – That Damn Horse, The Revenant. I don’t have as big of a problem with Tom Hardy winning for The Revenant. I would, however, have a big problem with the damn palomino winning for getting cut open by Leo. That was a real horse! DOES ANIMAL CRUELTY AND MUTILATION MEAN NOTHING?!\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\nWill Win – Jennifer Jason Leigh, The Hateful Eight. She’s a combination of “due” and “best thing about that ugly-ass movie”. Whatever else you might think of the bore that was the latest Tarantino bloodbath, Leigh is the beating center and twisted heart of the film. Watching the joke play out on her face as things go to hell is almost as chilling as watching everything turn south on her at the drop of a hat. Fantastic job.\n\nShould Win – Alicia Vikander, Ex Machina. She was nominated for The Danish Girl, but she was amazing in Ex Machina. Best work of the year, hands down. Alas, she suffers from the same genre bias that Charlize Theron suffered from in the nomination process. Apparently, the only way to get nominated for sci-fi is if you go to town on the Alien queen a la Ripley in Aliens. Also, fuck The Danish Girl .\n\nNightmare Win – Alicia Vikander, The Danish Girl. Seriously, fuck The Danish Girl.\n\nBest Cinematography\n\nWill Win – Emmanuel Lubezki, The Revenant. Natural lighting + tormented production + one of the best working cinematographers = a three-peat for Chivo.\n\nShould Win – …eh. This is a really strong category this year, one that doesn’t provoke a lot of antipathy on my part. It’d be nice for Roger Deakins to finally win a fucking Oscar, but Sicario isn’t really his strongest work. Maybe he upsets? Either way, I’m not gonna be that upset about this one.\n\nNightmare Win – Whoever The Fuck Shot Fifty Shades of Gray. Hey, you asked for a nightmare win. Write-in votes could happen.\n\nBest Visual Effects\n\nWill Win/Should Win – Mad Max: Fury Road\n\nI rest my case.\n\nNightmare Win: Not Mad Max: Fury Road.\n\nBest Make-Up and Hairstyling\n\nWill Win/Should Win: Mad Max: Fury Road\n\nYes.\n\nNightmare Win: The Revenant\n\nNo.\n\nBest Picture (Group Poll)\n\nAlex\n\nWill Win/Nightmare Win – The Revenant\n\nUgh. Here we go again. For the second year in a row Alejandro G. Inarritu seems set to snatch Best Picture away from a host of better movies. The Revenant is a movie that should have been right up my alley. It’s an epic and violent Western with impeccable cinematography and production design. Despite that stacked deck, I goddamn hated this movie. The story reduces to a series of increasingly ridiculous set-pieces with some insipid emotional and thematic hooks peppered in to no effect. It’s cinematography helps save some scenes, but by the two-hour mark I was actively sighing with impatience. By the end of the damn movie, I was flipping off the screen. I hated this movie. I hate Inarritu as a filmmaker. That he will probably collect five Oscars in two years is just…unbelievably awful. Burn this movie to the ground.\n\nShould Win – Mad Max: Fury Road\n\nMaybe you missed our previous Oscar pieces, but there is only one real option here. Every Picture nominee I’ve seen except the presumptuous winner has been pretty good and those I haven’t (The Martian, Room, & Brooklyn) all sound good, but Mad Max is on a whole different level. George Miller harnessed the formal powers of cinema into a rollicking and astounding masterpiece. My words cannot do it justice. There was nothing like it in theaters last year. It should be the Best Picture winner a million times over.\n\nTravis\n\nWill Win – Spotlight\n\nI think that the recent love for The Revenant is overstated – though while I feel like a win for it wouldn’t be good, I will say that I at least liked it better than Birdman, which seems an utterly forgettable film one year later. At least The Revenant stuck with me. That being said, I think that the love for Spotlight will carry the day. #wishfulthinking\n\nShould Win – Spotlight\n\nIt’s easily the best actual film of this group, and all without being pushy in the name of art. It has a plot. It’s structured around an entire theme, and crafted to reflect that theme and to provide commentary upon an age. It’s a damn good film. So yeah. (Runner-Up: Mad Max: Fury Road – …what Bean said.\n\nNightmare Win – Brooklyn\n\nDon’t get me wrong – Brooklyn is a good movie. It’s also the most ‘by the numbers’ of the Oscar movies, and sort of exemplifies what’s wrong with Oscar. It’s a coming of age story about a white Irish immigrant making her way in America. Nothing happens. It’s the kind of movie that pops up on Lifetime every now and then and you can watch it with your (white) grandparents, who can then reflect upon their own experiences/rant against the Irish. (You know what I mean, WASP-America) This spot should have gone to Straight Outta Compton, Dope, Creed, Chi-Raq, or any of a number of other movies reflecting on another American experience. But #OscarsSoWhite so…yeah, that’s my thoughts.\n\nAndrew\n\nWill Win – Spotlight\n\nAs Richard Jenkins says in the film, “my faith is in the eternal.” The split between the guilds has left this wide open, but I have faith that Oscar voters will take a look at what is truly great and what people will look back on as the best representative of 2015. As both a masterful example of classical Hollywood filmmaking and a powerful, beautifully told story of our determination to do what is right in the face of overwhelming institutional pressure, Spotlight is a film for the ages.\n\nShould Win – Mad Max: Fury Road\n\nThis is not a knock on Spotlight. But in pondering this I was reminded of a quote Tasha Robinson had on the latest episode of Filmspotting, that Thomas McCarthy should not have been nominated for Best Director. I disagreed but I understood what lay behind her reasoning: that a director should create something new and singular in style to get that nomination. Fury Road was a cinematic triumph blending practical and digital, old-school storytelling and modern feminist themes, all done with the type of action only the movies make possible. It is the one movie this year I would call more unforgettable than Spotlight. It must be witnessed.\n\nNightmare Win – The Revenant\n\nNo director has ever made two Best Picture winners in a row. The only two men to win two Best Directors in a row are two immortals, John Ford and Joseph L. Mankiewicz. To place Inarritu in the same breath as them for an empty, soulless expanse would be an insult to the history of this art form.\n\nWhich means I’ll be waiting with bated breath when they call this award on Sunday hoping we don’t have another Crash.\n\nWe here at The Addison Recorder read stuff. We also watch stuff. And play stuff, even. Sometimes, that stuff is interesting. Sometimes we just need to talk about whatever pop culture ephemera occupies our time. Other times, we take a whole damn summer off. This is one of those times.\n\nFabeck\n\nI pretty much didn’t go outside this summer. I ventured out a few times with friends, went to a wedding, and saw a few movies. But mostly, I stayed in. I’m not building up to some sad sack story of something awful that happened which turned me into an invalid. It was the opposite, rather. Something wonderful happened that turned me into an invalid. This summer I quit smoking. Like for real quit. Not the only-on-the-weekend-only-when-I-drink-vaping quit. But by sheer willpower alone. This exultation usually gets a smile and a pat on the back by non-smokers but the reality is it’s one of the hardest addictions to kick.\n\nIt may not fit into the theme of a random pop culture indulgence this time around, but the reason I thought it made sense to write about was that it gave me a lot of time inside to think. Going out became largely a stressful endeavor as I wanted a cigarette every five minutes so I just stayed in. So, what did I do? I took advantage of all the normal things I wasn’t able to do before as a smoker. I am able to write in longer stretches, I sleep a lot better (being able to breathe is nuts!), I no longer have to ask friends to pause movies three times so we can take breaks, and I feel more motivated overall. This time inside also helped me formulate outlines for a few short stories, decide to do NaNoWriMo, and also cut the cable cord. I surprisingly watch more movies and TV shows now but it’s only dedicated viewing, not just whatever bullshit is on right now. I guess what I’m trying to say is that staying inside all summer can sometimes do a body good. Even if you’re just watching Netflix.\n\nAndrew\n\nWhen not working on my own stories and seeing the Dead and Taylor Swift in concert, I’ve devoted myself to reading, especially The Story of Civilization by Will and Ariel Durant. Comprising eleven volumes written over four decades (with a Pulitzer Prize going to volume ten), Civilization covered the history of humanity from the earliest people in Africa and India up to Napoleon’s defeat at Waterloo, and it is still today a model for any historian or storyteller. The Durants reject “great man” history—many of their books provide distinct arguments against the patriarchy—and a focus on war and politics to try to summarize the eternal rising and falling of private and public cultures. The style is clear and lucid, and they have a gift for magnificent sentences that summarize and cap off entire sections of text. Also, when I needed a break from surveying human existence, I found great enjoyment in Deborah Harkness’s A Discovery of Witches. Harkness’s style is poor, with the dialogue ranging from superb to terrible and the plotting frequently godawful, as she pulls information out of nowhere to advance the story along. But the story, about two brilliant scholars who fall in love and discover they may hold the secret to human and inhuman existence, kept me turning 550 pages. (The scholars, by the way, are a witch and a vampire. Yes, I’ve entered that territory.)\n\nAlex\n\nThree months is a lot of time to consume pop culture and I’ve had more than most since getting laid off about a month ago. Since I have to narrow it down, though, I’ll go with the video game Journey. Originally released in 2012, it was remastered and re-released for the PlayStation 4 in July and I snapped it up immediately. Either playing alone or with an unidentified and randomly connected online companion, you play as an anonymous pilgrim trying to reach the summit of a brilliant mountain in the distance. The game only lasts two or three hours and is comprised of a mere 8 “levels” that can be moved through in as little as a few moments. What makes it special, though, is the feelings of sanctity, discovery and camaraderie that developers That Game Company weave in. Your journeyer walks, climbs, chirps, and soars in an mythical movement towards something like nirvana. It’s hard to describe aptly, but Journey is an aesthetic and emotional achievement like few others and a vibrant refutation of the argument that games cannot be art.\n\n-J.\n\nI echo Alex’s sentiment, both in sentiment (three months is a lot of ground to cover) and medium (games!). But I’ll use the tabletop variety to describe my summer, as the season is loaded with the biggest conventions on the continent. (I could go the video game route — the Dragon Age: Inquisition DLC kept me enthralled when Arkham Knight so deeply disappointed me — but where’s the fun in repetition?)\n\nSummer is the season of Gen Con, where I split my time running role-playing games and teaching the beautiful and enjoyable games from Asmadi. The more I taught Mottainai, for example, the more fascinating strategies I saw unfold. Gen Con is also where I got to inflict the Stone Thief upon a bevy of awesome 13th Age players, playtest a new Trickster deck from Daniel Solis, demo Spyfall with PK Sullivan at a bar while Spaceballs played in the background, and co-GM a session of the Firefly RPG with the amazingly talented James D’Amato of the One Shot podcast. At the same time, I got hooked on the Midgard campaign setting and got all fanboy at the new offerings teased by Pelgrane (The Fall of Delta Green) and Evil Hat (Fate of Cthulhu). It was a helluva summer, and I still haven’t caught up on sleep.\n\nTravis\n\nI moved and lost my Internet connection because I felt it was more important to pay off my credit card debt. Which I’m doing, so yay me.\n\nOne day, I borrowed a book from my boss at work – The Martian by Andy Weir. He recommended it, and said I would complete it in short fashion. I held onto it for a few days, mostly because I was reading other things. One night, I picked it up around 9:30, thinking I would read a few chapters before bedtime and that would be that.\n\nAt 4:00 am, I finished the book. So, yeah, it’s pretty good.\n\nThere’s a movie version coming out this fall starring Matt Damon, directed by Ridley Scott. I’m sure that will be awesome too. However, if you haven’t already read the book (it’s been out for a while), go read this book. Just be careful about when you start reading it.\n\nAlex Bean decided to get into soccer last year and chose Chelsea for no good reason at all. Luke De Smet had chosen Arsenal a few years prior for slightly better reason. Their eternal enmity now engaged, the pair will now write a soccer column for us. How nice. Let’s hope there’s no tie-flipping.\n\nAfter a brief two-month hiatus, European club soccer came roaring back to life on August 1st. Alex and Luke have let the first few weeks play out before sitting down to write, so this first column will run rapid-fire through their thoughts, complaints, and observations about the season’s first month.\n\nChelsea start their Premier League title defense by giving up on playing defense, surrendering 7 in the 1st 3 matches\n\nAlex: This has been a deeply upsetting surprise. When I climbed about the H.M.S. Chelsea a year ago it was because I was fleeing the disaster that had become Michigan football. Now Chelsea is giving up the ghost and becoming incompetent overnight as well? I feel like my only recourse is to switch allegiance to Arsenal to carry the curse onto them. The most visible culprits have been the central defenders, Gary Cahill and John Terry. Cahill has already been removed as a starter and Terry got benched and then red-carded in consecutive weeks. That’s a very far cry from playing every minute of the League season a year ago. The best hope I have right now is for a karma thing, where Michigan rises as Chelsea sinks.\n\nLuke: I think the thin midfield is hurting them as much as anything– as in year one of Jose’s return when he lacked a credible striker, all cogs need to be functioning for the machine to work. Time to buy Pogba!\n\nAlex: Also, it was fun to joshingly cheer for an asshole manager when they won easily. Jose Mourinho is transparently a callous and vain garbage person, but a fan can love that. He was our special jerkwad, and as long as the wins rolled in there was fun to be had. I mean, my first week paying attention was the fight with Wenger! I miss those days. Now I just feel like a bad person to support Chelsea while Mourinho publicly and needlessly attacks his own medical staff for doing their jobs. Not a great look.\n\nLuke: This sort of seems to be the pattern with Jose– he certainly never leaves due to a lack of result, folks just get sick of him after three years are so. His first year back even I wanted to like him, as the master-trolling heel of the Premier League. But at this point he’s just too dreary to be funny. Though to be fair his inexplicable beef with Rafa Benítez’s wife is pretty solid.\n\nManchester City start the season by being terrifying\n\nAlex: I am loathe to bring this up, because it will make Travis yell “UP MAN CITY!” in my ear, but…holy smokes. They’ve looked unstoppable in these first few weeks. Last spring they collapsed pretty badly and failed to mount a serious title challenge after drawing even with Chelsea on January 1st. Some R&R has apparently done them wonders, though. Well, I suppose the addition of Raheem Sterling for a crazy amount of money has helped as well, but a lot of their mastery is being driven by the older hands of Silva, Toure, Kompany, and Agüero. I see them making a big racket in England and the continent this year.\n\nLuke: And now they’ve seemingly added De Bruyne for $90 million, which would be insane for any team that has to keep a budget, but nonetheless further cements City as huge title favorites. And what’s money to them, anyway. It seems like the dream of financial fair play managed to last…one season.\n\nFine, so Chelsea is bad and Man City are good. What about the little squads in the Premier League. Also, has Alex banned Luke from mentioned the Gunners?\n\nAlex: I’m rooting for both Crystal Palace or Leicester City to keep their early start going and land in the top ten. They’ve both been on a roll since the new year, since both faced relegation when 2014 ended and have gobbled up tons of points ever since. Both sit in the top 5 after 3 weeks, which obviously cannot last. But I don’t think they will fall too far. Palace could even stretch and grab a Europa League spot, leaving the Hammers (I’d guess) as the only London team to miss out on Europe these days.\n\nLuke: I think a lot of Americans are put off by the rigid class system of European football. Here we want sports to be egalitarian, with salary caps forcing parity and draft picks going to the worst teams. Europe is having none of that: the same few teams win every year and if you finish bottom three they kick you the hell out of the league. But once you dig in there’s great drama to be had up and down the table. Look at Bournemouth, who play in front of 11,000 fans in a small town and in 2009 finished 21st in England’s fourth division. This year they’ll be fighting for Premier League survival and if they finish fourth from last you can bet their fans will be partying harder than City’s celebrating the title. Palace have risen from obscurity and are one of the most exciting teams in the league under Pardew, even pulling off one of the most surprising transfers of the year in signing Yohan Cabaye. Swansea won’t win you a title, but they represent Wales with a really fun collection of international talent, highlighted so far this year by Bafétimbi Gomis and his prowling cat goal celebration. It’s impossible not to love Southampton and their inexhaustible youth academy; just over a year ago they were coming off a great season only to have Liverpool purchase approximately 37 of their starting players, Tottenham poach their manager, and then the club bizarrely hire the fired head coach of the Edmonton Oilers (who play hockey, poorly) as the new Chairman. They then had an even better year.\n\nAnd yeah, we can’t forget about plucky Arsenal, who represent all that is good and pure and will not let mere details like being one of the richest and most widely supported clubs in the world,that’s owned by Stan Kroenke and a Russian oligarch even richer than Roman Abramovich stop them from being the lovable underdog that will inevitably finish fourth. (But ahead of Tottenham, which is all that really matters.)\n\nTwitter tells me there’s a thing called the Transfer Window? Explain or I’ll go back to NFL preseason games.\n\nAlex: I’m unclear as to why the bolded narrator would be so cruel to itself. No one deserves to watch preseason NFL games. To their question though, soccer clubs buy and sell players instead of trading them like we see in American leagues. The headline-grabber right now is that the reigning player of the year in Germany, Kevin DeBruyne, seems set to move over to Man City in exchange for the opening weekend grosses of Inside Out. We mentioned that before, I know, but it bears repeating because it’s hard to fathom how one team could have so much money and so many world-class players. I’d guess one of the three other big English clubs (Chelsea, Arsenal, and Manchester United) will pull a rabbit out of their hat in response to Man City stocking up, though.\n\nLuke: DeBruyne’s sale not only turns City into prohibitive favorites, but also makes the Bundesliga even less competitive. I imagine Chelsea have one more big signing in store, and probably United too, though the latter may be less inclined to panic-buy a striker after Rooney’s hat trick in Europe. (Against Brugge sure, but this is silly season so we take what we get.) Arsenal and United both want strikers, but what else is new. Questions about whether Giroud is good enough, or Rooney is still good enough are silly really because they’re both clearly very good at playing soccer, yet when people talk about who should be leading the line for the top team of the Premier League, the assumption is that it should basically be one of the very best number 9s in the world. Those players increasingly don’t seem available for purchase by anyone outside of the very top three or four superclubs. City have one, and if they can keep his hamstrings more or less strung together in the right way, so do Chelsea. But how do Arsenal and United get one, and how much would he cost? Benzema’s staying put in Madrid, but maybe if Arsenal refinance the Emirates we’ll be able to afford someone like, I dunno…Gonzalo Higuaín? Just please God don’t let us panic-buy Charlie Austin.\n\nFinally, the UEFA Champions League announced this Fall’s group pairings. The gods demand reactions!\n\nAlex: First, I’ll just leave a Wikipedia link here for those baffled by any or all of the words in the prompt. Second, these groups seem…weird? I know UEFA uses seeding and impartiality is supposed to rule the day, but the results still seem unbalanced. I’d still expect Manchester City to win through and go to the knockout stages, of course, but they got grouped with last year’s runner-up and the Europe League champs. That is a rough grab and whomever gets knocked out will have some legit gripes. Meanwhile, Group H’s is made up of teams I’d be hard-pressed to remember exist. I don’t think I understand UEFA yet.\n\nLuke: Yet amid the chaos Arsenal will still finish their group second behind some Germans. Don’t act like the consistency isn’t impressive.\n\nNo Ajax this year though, proving that the curse of my fandom is real. I had decided over the summer to burnish my hipster cred by getting into the Eredivisie and cheering for the Amsterdam giants who win championships fielding teams with an average age of somewhere around 12, and who gifted the world the madness of both Luis Suárez and Louis van Gaal. They then promptly lost their Champions League qualifier. Sorry, Ajax fans."
