        "text": "Since the beginning of the movie industry, music has always played a large role in film, and since the 1930s, the Academy Awards have been recognizing the original songs that have appeared in our favorite films.\n\nFlip through the slideshow below for 20 of the most iconic winners throughout the history of the Academy Awards's Best Original Song category, from classics like \"Moon River\" to newer favorites, like 2022's seriously catchy winner, \"Naatu Naatu.\"\n\n1 of 20\n\n\"Over The Rainbow\" (1939)\n\nSilver Screen Collection/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nIn 1939, Judy Garland delivered a legendary performance of \"Over The Rainbow\" as Dorothy, the Kansas girl whisked away to the land of Oz. It also took home the Academy Award for Best Original Song that same year.\n\n2 of 20\n\n\"Last Dance\" (1979)\n\nGAB Archive/Redferns\n\nAppearing in the 1978 film \"Thank God It's Friday,\" Donna Summer's seminal disco anthem \"Last Dance\" won the top award at both the Academy Awards and the Golden Globe Awards in 1979.\n\n3 of 20\n\n\"Streets of Philadelphia\" (1993)\n\nVinnie Zuffante/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\nIn addition to Tom Hanks's acclaimed (and award-winning) performance in \"Philadelphia,\" Bruce Springsteen earned equal praise for \"Streets of Philadelphia,\" picking up the Academy Award for Best Original Song and four Grammys.\n\n4 of 20\n\n\"Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head\" (1969)\n\nBettmann\n\nWritten by legendary songwriting duo Burt Bacharach and Hal David, \"Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head\" won the Oscar for Best Original Song in 1969 after it appeared in \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\" Bacharach also penned the film's score, and took home the Academy Award for Best Original Score.\n\n5 of 20\n\n\"When You Believe\" (1998)\n\nTIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIn 1998, the two most powerful voices of the decade, Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey, teamed up for \"When You Believe,\" an inspirational ballad that appeared in the animated DreamWorks film \"Prince of Egypt.\" It was a hit across the globe, and won Best Original Song at the 71st Academy Awards the following year.\n\n6 of 20\n\n\"I Just Called to Say I Love You\" (1984)\n\nEthan Miller/Getty Images\n\nWritten for 1984's \"The Woman In Red,\" starring Gene Wilder and Gilda Radner, \"I Just Called To Say I Love You\" was a No. 1 hit for weeks before it won the Best Original Song honor at the Academy Awards in 1985.\n\n7 of 20\n\n\"When You Wish Upon A Star\" (1940)\n\nMovieStillsDB\n\nThe first of many Disney contenders in the Best Original Song category, \"When You Wish Upon A Star\" appeared in the 1939 animated film \"Pinocchio.\" It faced some stiff competition at the 13th annual Academy Awards in 1940, including Bing Crosby's \"Only Forever,\" but ultimately took home the win.\n\n8 of 20\n\n\"Naatu Naatu\" (2022)\n\nKevin Winter/Getty Images\n\nComposed in Indian Telugu and appearing in the wildly popular film \"RRR,\" the energetic and uptempo \"Naatu Naatu\" was an obvious winner at the 2022 Academy Awards.\n\n9 of 20\n\n\"You Light Up My Life\" (1977)\n\nMichael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\nStarring Didi Conn of \"Grease\" fame, \"You Light Up My Life,\" a 1977 romantic drama, isn't nearly as well-known as its signature song, performed by Debby Boone. The song was an instant success on the Billboard charts, and won the Song of the Year Grammy Award along with Best Original Song at the Oscars that year.\n\n10 of 20\n\n\"Let It Go\" (2013)\n\nKevin Winter/Getty Images\n\nBeloved among kids and adults, \"Let It Go,\" from the animated Disney film \"Frozen\" is one of the most successful songs in the studio's history. In addition to being certified 9x Platinum, meaning sales of more than 9 million units, the ballad penned by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez also won Best Original Song at the 86th annual Academy Awards.\n\n11 of 20\n\n\"(I've Had) The Time of My Life\" (1987)\n\nMovieStillsDB\n\nThere are few songs from film more iconic than \"(I've Had) The Time of My Life,\" from director Emile Ardolino's beloved 1987 film \"Dirty Dancing.\" Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes recorded the song, which scooped up awards at the Grammys, Oscars, and Golden Globes that same year.\n\n12 of 20\n\n\"High Hopes\" (1959)\n\nFrank Edwards/Fotos International/Getty Images\n\nThis ode to eternal optimism from Frank Sinatra appears in the 1959 slapstick comedy \"A Hole In The Head,\" though it's different than the studio version that you likely remember hearing on the radio. In the film, Sinatra is joined by young actor Eddie Hodges for a performance of \"High Hopes,\" which won the Best Original Song category in 1959.\n\n13 of 20\n\n\"Lose Yourself\" (2002)\n\nJ. Shearer/WireImage\n\nInspired by Marshall \"Eminem\" Mathers's real-life upbringing as a struggling rapper in Detroit, Michigan, \"Lose Yourself\" was the first rap song to win an Academy Award. But it was an obvious victor at the 75th annual Academy Awards in 2002.\n\n14 of 20\n\n\"Que Sera, Sera\" (1956)\n\nMovieStillsDB\n\nIf you've ever been annoyed at someone saying \"que sera, sera\" to you in the event of a mishap, you've got Alfred Hitchcock to blame. The song popularized the phrase after it appeared in the director's 1955 film \"The Man Who Knew Too Much,\" performed by Doris Day. The following year, it won Best Original Song at the Oscars.\n\n15 of 20\n\n\"Moon River\" (1961)\n\nMovieStillsDB\n\nThis dreamy tune from the favorite film \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" has an allure that's lingered throughout the decades. After it appeared in the Audrey Hepburn classic, it won big at both the Academy Awards and the Grammys.\n\n16 of 20\n\n\"Beauty and the Beast\" (1991)\n\nMovieStillsDB\n\n'90s kids can't forget \"Beauty and the Beast,\" performed by Angela Lansbury, who portrayed a wise teapot in the much-beloved Disney film of the same name. A pop version of the song was also released, recorded by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson.\n\n17 of 20\n\n\"The Way You Look Tonight\" (1936)\n\nMovieStillsDB\n\n1926 was a tough year for the Best Original Song category, in which legendary composer Cole Porter's \"I've Got You Under My Skin\" was pitted against \"The Way You Look Tonight,\" now a standard of the American songbook. The latter, which appeared in the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers film \"Swing Time,\" prevailed.\n\n18 of 20\n\n\"Fame\" (1980)\n\nMovieStillsDB\n\nConsidering that two songs from this 1980 film about students at New York City's legendary performing arts high school were nominated for Best Original Song, it's perhaps not surprising that title track \"Fame\" took home the award. It even beat out Willie Nelson's \"On The Road Again,\" which appears in the film \"Honeysuckle Rose,\" that year.\n\n19 of 20\n\n\"My Heart Will Go On\" (1997)\n\nGABRIEL BOUYS/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIn addition to appearing in James Cameron's epic \"Titanic,\" Celine Dion's emotive \"My Heart Will Go On\" remains a ballad for the ages. It won the Best Original Song Academy Award, among many others, and is still one of the top-selling songs of all time.\n\n20 of 20\n\n\"Skyfall\" (2012)\n\nKevin Winter/Getty Images\n\nWhether or not you actually liked \"Skyfall,\" the 2012 James Bond film starring Daniel Craig, there's no denying that Adele's take on a Bond ballad is one of the franchise's best songs. It also won Best Original Song in 2012, and sold more than 7 million copies across the globe."
