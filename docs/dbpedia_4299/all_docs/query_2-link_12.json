        "text": "Ludwig Göransson's captivating composition for Oppenheimer has triumphed in the Best Original Score category at the 2024 Oscars.\n\nGöransson's victory represents his exceptional talent and innovative approach to film scoring, as one of the youngest composers to ever receive the Best Original Score Oscar. It marks his second win in the category — he took home his first Oscar in 2019 for Black Panther. Göransson's work on Oppenheimer also won at the 2024 GRAMMYs for Best Score Soundtrack For Visual Media (Includes Film And Television).\n\nGöransson's work stood out among the competition, going up against the scores of American Fiction, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Killers of the Flower Moon, and Poor Things. His ability to convey deep emotional narratives and complex historical contexts through his scores has established him as one of the most innovative and sought-after composers in Hollywood.\n\n2024 Oscars: Watch Performances & Highlights\n\n2024 Oscars: Watch Becky G Perform \"The Fire Inside\" From The 2023 Comedy-Drama ‘Flamin’ Hot’\n\nGöransson's composition for Oppenheimer serves as the heartbeat of the movie, underpinning the film's exploration of the moral complexities and monumental impact of J. Robert Oppenheimer's work on the atomic bomb. Through his music, Göransson invites audiences into the internal and external conflicts faced by the \"father of the atomic bomb,\" providing a sonic backdrop that is as thought-provoking as it is visceral.\n\nRead more: Watch: Ludwig Göransson Discusses His GRAMMY Win For 'Oppenheimer' At The 2024 GRAMMYs\n\nThe award was presented by fellow GRAMMY winners, Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, who will star together in the Wizard of Oz big screen adaptation of the musical Wicked as Glinda and Elphaba respectively, premiering on the silver screen later this year. Speaking to the power of music to leave an indelible mark on the viewer through film, Grande said, \"a great film score can leave a handprint on our hearts forever. It can ignite wonder and astonishment, make us feel sadness and longing and even transport us to new worlds.\"\n\nGöransson achieved just that. In his acceptance speech, Göransson thanked his colleagues, and stars of the film for contributions to his distinctive vision. \"Christopher Nolan, it was your idea to use a violin in the score and it allowed me to work and collaborate with my wonderful wife and acclaimed violinist, Serena Göransson,\" he said.\n\nGöransson ended his speech by acknowledging his parents, \"Thank you for giving me guitars and drum machines and not buying me video games.\"\n\n2024 Oscars: Billie Eilish And FINNEAS Perform A Heartrending Version Of \"What Was I Made For?\" From The 'Barbie' Soundtrack\n\nEvery June, Pride Month offers a time for the LGBTQIA+ community to reflect and raise awareness — but also, to party it up. While there were plenty of Pride anthems to pack playlists prior to this year, the past 12 months have seen some flawless new additions from a mix of fresh talent and long-standing stalwart artists that the queer community happily embraces.\n\nWhile there's no set template on how to create an undeniable Pride anthem, there are major hallmarks: high-energy tempo, candid lyrics, delicious camp, and an undeniable groove. Between pop bops and dance floor jams, no Pride party is complete without at least a couple of the songs listed below. Cheers to the cathartic power of music to usher in another season of acceptance and equality.\n\nSabrina Carpenter — \"Espresso\"\n\nYou play it when you wake up. It's on the radio on the way to the club. It's playing at the club. Heck, it's even blasting at the gym the next day. 2024's newly crowned pop princess, Sabrina Carpenter, released an instant classic when she unfurled \"Espresso\" in April — more than enough time to learn the lyrics by Pride Month.\n\nWith an infectious melody targeting your ears like a jolt of morning caffeine, its steaming dose of memorable lines (\"I'm working late/ 'cause I'm a singer\") are the handiwork of Carpenter along with three veteran lyricists, including close collaborator Steph Jones, Amy Allen (Harry Styles, Selena Gomez) and Julian Bunetta, who is perhaps best known for his plethora of work with One Direction. \"Espresso\" marks further proof that if there's one thing Carpenter knows it's how to command an audience, whether through her captivating stage shows or viral, story-telling music videos that link together (including for recent single \"Please, Please, Please\").\n\nRead More: Sabrina Carpenter Releases New Single \"Please Please Please\": Everything We Know About Her New Album 'Short N' Sweet'\n\nCharli XCX — \"360\"\n\nIt's safe to say that Charli XCX is experiencing a new phase of her decade-long career as a critically acclaimed starlet. Her sixth studio album, BRAT, marks an evolution of her sound into a batch of adult tracks tailor-made for the club. As a result, it's spawned a number of viral memes among her legions of LGBTQIA+ fans, who have also boasted lime green avatars on social media in honor of what's being dubbed \"brat summer.\"\n\nIt's no coincidence then that she'd release the project in the midst of Pride Month, led by the relentlessly pulsating single \"360.\" With lyrics that have quickly already found itselves queer canon — \"Drop down, yeah, Put the camera flash on\" — the album boasts a hyperpoop energy and unapologetic individuality, making her recent spate of shows some of the hottest tickets in town.\n\nRead More: Charli XCX's Road To 'Brat': How Her New Album Celebrates Unabashed Confidence & Eccentricity\n\nOrville Peck, Diplo & Kylie Minogue — \"Midnight Ride\"\n\nGiddy up! One of the brightest out stars in the LGBTQIA+ musical universe, the ever-masked Orville Peck has made a name for himself as a queer outlier in the country music scene. So it stands to reason that he'd partner up with none other than Kylie Minogue — who had the defining song of Pride '23 in the form of \"Padam Padam\" — for their own anthem for 2024. The result is \"Midnight Ride,\" a whistle-powered, Diplo-produced earworm that's perfect for a rainbow-tinted hoedown.\n\nThe team-up is part of Peck's forthcoming duets project, for which he recruited a cavalcade of singing partners for queer-themed country-tinged tracks in a unique two-volume album dubbed Stampede (which drops in full Aug. 2). The collaborators include Willie Nelson, who croons with Peck on the eye-raising ditty \"Cowboys Are Frequently Secretly Fond of Each Other.\"\n\nDua Lipa — \"Houdini\"\n\nWhen Dua Lipa released Future Nostalgia in 2020, it became an instant classic in the pop world and LGBTQIA+ lexicon alike, cementing Lipa (and songs like \"Don't Start Now\" and \"Physical\") into the grand pantheon of queer playlist magic. The pressure was on, then, for her follow-up to live up to its commercial success and fandom.\n\nCue \"Houdini,\" from this year's Radical Optimism, a cathartic dance floor anthem by one of the gay community's newer idols. Aside from setting the perfect tone for Pride Month with its delicious hook and refreshing confident lyrics \"(Prove you got the right to please me\"), in an interview with SiriusXM Hits 1, Lipa said the production of the track set the tone for the new project: \"I was like, \"Okay, I feel like now I know exactly what this album's gonna be and what it's gonna sound like.\"\n\nRead More: Dua Lipa's Road To 'Radical Optimism': How Finding The Joy In Every Moment Helped Her Become Pop's Dance Floor Queen\n\nThe Challengers soundtrack\n\nWho knew that a soundtrack to a tense and sultry tennis drama would yield an album fit for the dance floor? The thumping array of tunes that Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross churned out for Luca Guadagnino's Challengers has proved to be a hit beyond the film, with its synth-propelled soundtrack proving to be a unique and wild tracks, including the driving \"I Know.\"\n\nIts embrace in the LGBTQIA+ community should come as no surprise considering the single note the director gave Ross before he started work. \"The way he described 'Challengers' was in a one-sentence email,\" Ross told Variety earlier this year. \"Do you want to be on my next film? It's going to be super sexxy.' Two x's.\"\n\nAriana Grande — \"yes, and\"\n\nAriana Grande is no stranger to gay-friendly anthems; in fact, she delivered one of 2020's most iconic Pride moments with her Lady Gaga duet, \"Rain On Me.\" When her album eternal sunshine dropped earlier this year, it was no surprise that she'd offer a few more bops for a Pride playlist.\n\nAmong them is \"yes, and,\" a Max Martin-produced hit that can get even your stiffest friend moving on the dance floor. Perhaps it's no coincidence, then, that the creative team took the sonic elements of ballroom culture — a uniquely queer LGBTQIA+ experience — and fused them with lyrics perfect for a personal Pride anthem. \"Say that s— with your chest,\" she croons. We will, Ari!\n\nRead More: Listen To GRAMMY.com's 2024 Pride Month Playlist Of Rising LGBTQIA+ Artists\n\nPeggy Gou — \"(It Goes Like) Nanana\"\n\nIf you've been on a dance floor in the recent past, odds are you've grooved to nostalgic beats courtesy the South Korean producer Peggy Gou. The breakout star is known for her unique brand of throwback dance jams, which carry a distinct '90s-era flavor that has led her to be embraced in queer spaces from Fire Island to West Hollywood. The most infectious, \"(It Goes Like) Nanana\").... samples the German artist ATB's 1998 track \"9 PM (Till I Come),\" no doubt a reaction to the recent revitalization of 90s-era culture popular in the LGBTQIA+ community, which provides a thumping link to queer culture past.\n\n\"For me, the DJ is someone who teaches people the value of music and educates them,\" Gou told L'Official of her musical mission. \"It is someone who transmits a beautiful memory and is somehow responsible for it.\"\n\nChappell Roan — \"Casual\"\n\nWhile Roan has been a bubbling-under singer/songwriter for a handful of years, 2024 has proved to be decidedly her time to shine. Ever since the release of her debut album, 2023's The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, her back catalog has logged impressive streaming numbers, and she's commanded massive crowds at the likes of Governor's Ball and Bonnaroo.\n\nPart of her appeal comes from her unabashed candidness about her sexuality (Roan identifies as a lesbian) and resilience. Both are exemplified by her single \"Casual,\" which is about a relationship that doesn't seem to get all that serious, for better or worse.\n\nHowever, Roan told the Associated Press last year that normally she isn't so sexually candid. \"The songs kind of give me the opportunity to act like that, and say that, and dress like that,\" she explained. \"It's mainly to piss off — it's all a rebellion. That's what it is. It is very empowering, I think, for a lot of people. ... It's just not as empowering to me as it is living out a fantasy.\"\n\nRead More: Chappell Roan's Big Year: The 'Midwest Princess' Examines How She Became A Pop \"Feminomenon\"\n\nTroye Sivan — \"One Of Your Girls\"\n\nBy now, we've all heard Troye Sivan's infectious hit \"Rush\" or seen its viral music video — both of which earned the singer his first GRAMMY nominations this year. In the interim, his 2023 album, Something to Give Each Other, is filled with plenty of other tracks that speak intimately and eloquently about the queer experience.\n\nTake, for example, the luscious \"One Of Your Girls,\" a meditation on when a gay man has a transactional fling with an otherwise straight person. It subsequently has turned into yet another queer definitive anthem for the Australian star.\n\nAs a result, Sivan has turned into one of the musical heroes of the community: not only unabashedly talented, but an eloquent chronicler of the gay experience. Even better, as he told NPR last year, his queer-focused projects are as cathartic for him as they may be for listeners. \"There's a big element of pride in the fact that I am now so comfortably, openly gay.\"\n\nPRIDE & Black Music Month: Celebrating LGBTQIA+ & Black Voices\n\nHow Rihanna Uses Her Superstardom To Champion Diversity | Black Sounds Beautiful\n\n5 Women Essential To Rap: Cardi B, Lil' Kim, MC Lyte, Sylvia Robinson & Tierra Whack\n\nThe Rise Of The Queer Pop Star In The 2010s\n\nHow Jay-Z Became The Blueprint For Hip-Hop Success | Black Sounds Beautiful\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Became A Rap Icon | Black Sounds Beautiful\n\n6 LGBTQIA+ Latinx Artists You Need To Know: María Becerra, Blue Rojo & More\n\nQueer Christian Artists Keep The Faith: How LGBTQ+ Musicians Are Redefining Praise Music\n\nHow Whitney Houston’s Groundbreaking Legacy Has Endured | Black Sounds Beautiful\n\nBlack-Owned Music Venues To Support Now\n\n5 Artists Fighting For Social Justice Today: Megan Thee Stallion, Noname, H.E.R., Jay-Z & Alicia Keys\n\nArtists Who Define Afrofuturism In Music: Sun Ra, Flying Lotus, Janelle Monae, Shabaka Hutchings & More\n\n5 Emerging Artists Pushing Electronic Music Forward: Moore Kismet, TSHA, Doechii & Others\n\nHow Quincy Jones' Record-Setting, Multi-Faceted Career Shaped Black Music On A Global Scale | Black Sounds Beautiful\n\nBrooke Eden On Advancing LGBTQ+ Visibility In Country Music & Why She's \"Got No Choice\" But To Be Herself\n\nWomen And Gender-Expansive Jazz Musicians Face Constant Indignities.

Ice Spice is set to take on her Y2K World Tour next month and it's no doubt that this \"Phat Butt\" will be a highlight on her setlist.\n\nExplore More: The Rise Of Ice Spice: How The \"Barbie World\" Rapper Turned Viral Moments Into A Full-On Franchise\n\nAriana Grande, Brandy, & Monica — \"the boy is mine (remix)\"\n\nWhen asking different groups who sings the song \"the boy is mine,\" you're likely to get two answers. Some will say pop star Ariana Grande, while others will think of the original 1998 R&B hit by Brandy and Monica, which won the GRAMMY for Best R&B Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal in 1999.
