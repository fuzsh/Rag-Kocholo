        "text": "Keynote speaker Natasha Causton, Class of ’96 and world languages teacher at Middlebury Union High School, emphasized the importance of community and praised student and staff service to the greater community. ”You give me hope in the world. You have both the skills and the heart to go out and do good work, and you do it. You clearly have developed a strong sense of responsibility and a commitment to others. Your voice, your opinion and your perspective matter,” she said.\n\nThe following students were recognized at the 2022 Public Service Leadership Awards. The first four awards are named in honor of individuals with special relationships to Middlebury College, many of whom were in attendance over Zoom. The remaining six awards recognize students for their distinct commitment to and leadership in public service, and encourage continued pursuits of their engagement well after graduation and throughout their lives.\n\nThe Dana Morosini Reeve ’84 Memorial Public Service Award recognizes students who exemplify Dana’s spirit and determination in advocacy work.

Kevin stepped up to develop local experiences that educated students on the history and context of migration in Vermont, including the ways history impacts current immigration policies.\n\nThe John M. McCardell Jr. Public Service Leadership Award—which recognizes students that bring Middlebury, both the College and the town, closer together for public benefit—was presented to Luke Robins ’23 for his commitment to justice reform and restorative justice practices. Luke was a Privilege & Poverty Academic Cluster intern and split time between the Addison County Public Defender and Addison County Restorative Justice Services. Luke worked directly with individuals involved in the criminal justice system, supporting a restorative justice model that holds offenders accountable in a community context that relies on volunteers. Luke took initiative to connect with other Middlebury students to support this work, bringing students together with other members of the community and enhancing the courts’ ability to practice a restorative justice model.\n\nThe Bonnie McCardell Public Service Award went to a student who exemplifies outreach in youth and family services, literacy, and the special needs of young people. As Lead Student Coordinator of Community Friends, a 1:1 mentoring organization at Middlebury, Madeline “Maddie” McKean ’22 helped keep mentors and mentees connected during the pandemic, finding creative solutions to engage kids online and supporting other mentors through the challenges of virtual mentoring. Maddie helped provide continuity for local schools and families during a time when mentoring relationships were more important than ever. Under Maddie’s leadership, Community Friends was able to consistently match Middlebury students with youth across Addison County, and provide resources to mentors to support and enhance their remote activities with kids.\n\nThe Tiffany Nourse Sargent ’79 Engaged Partnership Award honors an educational partnership between Middlebury College and a community organization to address community needs. Middlebury Regional Emergency and Medical Services (MREMS) and Middlebury College were presented this award for their partnership in responding to emergency calls in our local community. MREMS staff, student leaders, and Middlebury College staff accepted the award for their efforts in training, supporting, and mentoring Middlebury College students to become MREMS responders. Since 2002, Middlebury College has provided a J-term course teaching students the skills to become an EMT, training students to respond to emergencies in the greater Middlebury area.\n\nAmanda Coccia ’22 and Linh Tran ’22 for their service as Middlebury Alternative Break program (MAlt) co-presidents, supporting MAlt trip leaders to develop justice-focused experiential learning experiences for peers.

Linh then co-lead a MAlt trip to California for an immersive learning experience into environmental justice.\n\nRostyk Yarovyk ’25 for his advocacy in responding to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Rostyk’s native country. Rostyk helped raise awareness of the conflict and support for Ukraine, working with other Ukrainian students to organize a two-week fundraiser with tables across campus as well as the United for Ukraine concert. Rostyk met with the Vermont Lieutenant Governor at the State Capital to discuss how Vermonters can support Ukraine, spoke to the Vermont State House of Representatives, and facilitated a “Seat at the Table” conference. That same day, the Vermont House passed a resolution donating $600,000 to help Ukraine. Rostyk has also provided English tutoring to Ukrainian refugees, interviews with VPR, and translated news articles to help fight misinformation. In addition to this advocacy, Rostyk volunteers with the Ukraine Global Scholars program, supporting Ukrainians applying for US colleges with applications and funding services.\n\nThe Nutrition Outreach and Mentoring (NOM) executive board, made up of Emily Bulczynski ’22, Grace Kirkpatrick ’22, Cassie Kearney ’22, Emily Hyer ’23, Emma White ’22, Emma Pagni ’23.5, and Indira Yuldasheva ’22, was recognized for their leadership in mentoring centered around nutrition and food education. The NOM executive board showed exceptional dedication to nourishing existing relationships with local community partners, in an ever-changing Covid environment, and growing new partnerships to support youth living in Addison County. This year, NOM led ongoing nutrition-based educational programming at Mary Hogan Elementary School, Middlebury Union Middle School, and Addison Central Teens. The NOM executive board exemplified the spirit of community, provided consistency for local families, and collaborated through shared responsibility and ownership.\n\nNicholas “Nick” Wagg ’22 was presented an award for his dedication to Brother to Brother, an organization that creates safe and affirming spaces for middle schoolers to foster healthy attitudes towards masculinity. Nick has been involved with Brother to Brother since his sophomore year at Middlebury, first as Treasurer and then as President. Even while Nick was studying abroad his junior year, he continued to join Brother to Brother meetings on Zoom to support the organization during Covid. In his position as President, Nick has done the hard work to create a sustainable organization that was impacted by the Covid pandemic and the inability to be in-person with middle school students. Nick intentionally built connections with new students to cultivate the next line of leaders for Brother to Brother and worked with other student organizations to collaborate on outreach and programming.\n\nAndrés Oyaga ’23 was recognized for his advocacy in economic and human rights for migrant farm workers. Andrés has organized affinity spaces for BIPOC community members at the Knoll and most recently, joined a student solidarity movement with Migrant Justice to help center human rights and environmental justice in the dairy industry and Middlebury’s own energy portfolio.
