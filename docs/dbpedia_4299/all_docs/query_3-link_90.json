        "text": "Fremont, Ohio | Psychology Major\n\nJohanna Alexander was characterized by one nominator as someone who brings joy to everyone around her, even in the most challenging situations. This is regularly the case with Miami's Threshold Choir, of which Johanna has been the president for three semesters. Miami's chapter of Threshold Choir aims to provide comfort through bedside signing to people in hospice care. Johanna not only manages the logistics of learning songs and visiting hospice locations, but also sets the tone and spirit of the organizations. She balances the seriousness of the mission of the organization with creating a positive atmosphere among members.\n\nOutside of Threshold Choir, Johanna has also served as a Conversation Cafe Partner with our American Culture and English (ACE) Program, choreographer of the Vision Dance Company on campus, helped plan a Winter Immersion Service Experience (WISE) trip to Washington DC, and worked in summer 2019 as an intern through our Urban Leadership Intern Program in Dayton. Another of Johanna's nominators called her intellectually curious, highly motivated, inclusive of diverse opinions and cultural backgrounds, and compassionate. In recognition of those characteristics and much more, Johanna is a current finalist for a Fulbright Award.\n\nHamilton, Ohio | Psychology, Public Health, and Social Work Triple Major\n\nOne nominator wrote that Hannah Caudill is one of the very rare students who stands out as an academic, has a passion for her fields, maximizes experience through involvement and volunteering, and is a genuinely kind person. She has combined her passions through her three majors: social work, public health, and psychology. For her social work field placement, Hannah worked to find a site that allowed her to practice the core components of all three. At this placement, she worked in a hospital emergency department, assisting with social and health assessments and helped refer patients to appropriate resources. Though she wasn’t the first student in this placement, Hannah immediately saw opportunities for improvement in processes. The hospital staff saw Hannah’s passion and potential and fully empowered her to implement some of her ideas. Ultimately, these changes helped shape the culture of the emergency department and Hannah’s research and presentations on the topic influenced departments across the country to prioritize psychosocial needs of patients, along with their medical needs.\n\nHannah has also served as a HAWKS Peer Health Educator for two years, educating many Miami students on important topics across all dimensions of health. She served as the HAWKS staff development coordinator, managing her peers and assisting with weekly staff development activities. Hannah conducted research about the effectiveness of the HAWKS signature program, Step Up! Bystander Intervention Training. She has also been the president of Miami’s chapter of the College Diabetes Network, involved with Opening Minds through Art, and participated in a service trip to work with imprisoned youth in Guatemala.\n\nYellow Springs, Ohio | Diplomacy & Global Politics and Individualized Studies: Poverty Studies Double Major\n\nIn Fall 2017, Cecilia Comerford approached the Office of Student Wellness with a desire to reduce the negative consequences she saw her peers experience because of the overconsumption of alcohol. She proposed a water station in Uptown Oxford. The water station both helps students stay hydrated while drinking and explicitly communicates that we care about the health and safety of our Miami community. She created partnership with the local grocery store for bulk purchases of water, worked with local businesses to incorporate their feedback, and found funding for the initiative. The following year, Cecilia led an Associated Student Government (ASG) initiative to write letters to all incoming first-year students about college alcohol use. Upperclassmen shared stories about friendships, events, and organizations that helped them transition to college life and navigate decisions about alcohol use.\n\nIn addition to these contributions, Cecilia has served as the secretary for governmental relations in ASG, participated in the Governmental Relations Network, and served on the campaign of Ohio’s current governor, Mike DeWine, where she was a special assistant to Fran DeWine. One nominator wrote that Cecilia is a student leading the way to create a healthy, safe, and supportive campus culture.\n\nSomerset, Ohio | Adolescent & Young Adult Integrated Social Studies Education and Political Science Double Major\n\nMegan assumed, as one nominator termed it, immense responsibility in serving her peers as a student member of Miami's Board of Trustees. The student trustee is not in the public's eye, but their work with the Board has a long-lasting impact on the future of Miami. Megan communicates the student voice to the Board and was one of the reasons our Board received the John W. Nason Award for Board Leadership from the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges.\n\nBut Megan's involvement and interest with the future of the University isn't limited to her involvement on the Board of Trustees. Megan has also been deeply involved with our Governmental Relations Network, where she worked closely with President Crawford and Director of Institutional Relations Randi Thomas to implement Miami's Statehouse Day, where students and faculty visited with Ohio legislators to discuss issues of importance to Miami and higher education in Ohio.\n\nMegan served on the Armstrong Student Center Board, where she led change in the board culture towards more shared leadership and representation of the student body in decision making. In addition to advocating for Miami, Megan is also a tireless advocate for K-12 students. She received the 2019 Joanna Jackson Goldman Memorial Prize to study the impact of school funding on Ohio's rural and Appalachian communities. She also created effective teacher development programs by securing a M.I.A.M.I. Women Grant. Megan has worked hard to make the most of her time at Miami, both for her own learning and to leave Miami a better place through her leadership.\n\nBexley, Ohio | Literature Major\n\nViengsamai was described by one nominator as \"the type of person who truly gives their all to whatever they commit themselves to in life\" and as the person in a group \"who constantly encourages and empowers their peers to be true to themselves.\" Their time on campus can be described by one word: advocacy. Much of the focus of Viengsamai's advocacy is on educating the campus community about the LGBTQ+ community and opportunities for allyship.\n\nViengsamai served as an intern in the Women*s Center for over 2 years, taking the lead on Femellectual, an annual publication that \"strives to center, amplify, and uplift voices of those who have been devalued because of who they are.\" They also took the lead in the annual Clothesline Project to tell the stories of survivors of sexual violence. Viengsamai has led Spectrum for the past year and served as the education chair the previous year, where they organized over 30 Pride Panels in various courses at the request of faculty members. They also served as a peer leader for MADE@Miami and presented to the full MADE conference on the topic of LGBTQ+ identity and allyship.\n\nElsewhere on campus, Viengsamai served as a Student Orientation Undergraduate Leader (SOUL), a campus tour guide, a Bridges Program host, played cello in the Miami University Symphony Orchestra, and is a member and social chair of a professional music fraternity.\n\nDublin, Ohio | Finance & Political Science\n\nAnnika Fowler isn't someone who is afraid to \"leave popular opinion behind when it is best for students,\" as one nominator wrote. During her time on campus, she has been heavily involved in Associated Student Government (ASG), serving as a senator, two years as the secretary for academic affairs, and as this year's chief of staff. In these roles, she has served as the liaison to the Board of Trustees, the Liberal Education Council, and on the Affordable Learning and Open Educational Resources Committee (AL/OERC). In her service on AL/OERC, Annika spearheaded an effort to expand the Textbook Reserve Program, which allows short term access to textbooks from Miami's top 50 classes by size. Annika was not only the student voice on AL/OERC, but also led the successful submission of a M.I.A.M.I. Women grant that resulted in an additional $10,000 for the program. Annika's efforts allowed the program to expand to serve Miami's top 100 classes by size. Those additional 50 courses annually have a combined enrollment of over 9,000 students. Annika was the only student on a panel held in conjunction with the 2018 Ohio governor's State of the State address, titled \"College textbooks and the state of affordable learning initiatives in Ohio.\"\n\nOutside of ASG and affordability, Annika has also been deeply involved in the JANUS Forum, serving as both vice president and president of the organization. She has led efforts to bring speakers to campus from opposing sides to discuss an issue currently important in society. As if that isn't enough, Annika has served on the Business Student Advisory Committee, the Honors Advisory Board, the Governmental Relations Network, the recent Provost search committee, and has conducted research and written op-eds about U.S. drone strikes.\n\nHebron, Kentucky | Political Science, Sociology, and Women's, Gender & Sexuality Studies Triple Major\n\nShelby Frye is focused on the transition and campus experience of Miami students, working to make Miami a place where all students can succeed. Shelby has worked with new student orientation in four different capacities, from leading small groups, to leading the SOULs, to working with advising during orientation, and finally creating ongoing communication to students in their first semester at Miami. Her success as an undergraduate associate for UNV 101 led to her current membership on the University's Summer Reading Program Committee, where she represents the student voice.\n\nBut Shelby's care for the student experience doesn't end there. She's also been deeply involved in Associated Student Government (ASG), serving as a senator for the College of Arts and Science for two years and focusing on diversity and inclusion. During her time in ASG, Shelby played an integral role in the development of Campus Care, short, less formal meetings with a trained mental health professional in locations around campus. One nominator wrote that Shelby asked critical questions to ensure that Campus Care would be inclusive for all students.\n\nShelby has conducted research about perceptions of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh, team-based learning, gendered language, and perceptions of mandatory reporting of campus sexual assault. She served as a member of the Dean of Students Dean's Advisory Board, a Gradu8 Learning Mentor, a campus tour guide, was recognized as the inaugural Love & Honor Story Project recipient, and received the Provost's Student Academic Achievement Award in 2019.\n\nPiqua, Ohio | Public Health and Strategic Communication Double Major\n\nCassidy quickly became involved in leadership development at Miami, working for and participating in programs offered by the Wilks Institute for Leadership and Service. In Wilks she coordinated the Leadership Certificate Program, including all scheduling and logistics for workshops and lectures in the program. She also led the logistics team for the Ohio Valley Region of the Collegiate Leadership Competition, hosted by Miami each spring. She currently works with the Wilks Miami Strengths Project. One nominator said that these projects were intentionally assigned to Cassidy in their early stages of development because it was clear she could oversee the development and improvement of each.\n\nCassidy has put her leadership skills into practice in multiple places on campus. She leads the Miami University Student Foundation (MUSF), currently serving as the executive chair of the organization. Her dedication has been recognized outside of Miami, as shown by her selection to serve on the regional board of the Council for the Advancement and Support of Education Affiliated Student Advancement Programs (CASE ASAP), where she is also currently serving as the chair of that board.\n\nCassidy has also served new members of our Panhellenic Association community, most recently as the Head Rho Gamma. In this role she guided 68 other student leaders through curriculum and training to support the 1,250 women who pursued the opportunity to join a sorority. Cassidy has also been involved in her sorority, served on the Armstrong Student Center Board, was logistics chair for the last Charter Day Ball, and is a member of the University Lecture Series Committee.\n\nSolon, Ohio | Psychology and Spanish Double Major\n\nPamela's nominator summed up her work as \"setting the foundation for future students to have a place to call and feel like home.\" Pamela has served as a resident assistant (RA) for two years and consistently goes above and beyond the expectations of the position, assisting other RAs with their programming, leading her hall's social media presence, and being a present, available resource for her residents and others throughout Presidents Hall.\n\nMoreover, Pamela's lasting impact will be felt throughout UNIDOS, Miami's Latinx student organization. She is the current president, assuming leadership of an organization still finding its identity after the merger of Miami's two previous Latinx organizations, ALAS and SOMOS. Pamela's unmatched resolve and determination has helped UNIDOS and its members surpass the accomplishments and sense of community of its predecessor organizations. She has forged new partnerships and strengthened existing ones, working with the Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion to plan faculty and student socials, and with Global Initiatives to plan the annual UniDiversity Festival in Uptown Oxford.\n\nOutside of these two roles, Pamela has conducted social psychology research, served as a PASS Mentor and an undergraduate associate, is the activities director for the Italian Club, and is a member of a sorority.\n\nHighland Park, Illinois | Speech Pathology & Audiology Major\n\nAli has a \"strong passion for education and advocacy for individuals with disabilities,\" which has been strengthened by her involvements and accomplishments at Miami. In her research on and administration of child language assessments, Ali often takes on tasks typically reserved for strong graduate students. Not satisfied with only working on her nominator's existing research project, Ali developed her own research questions about parent-child literacy engagement for families of children with Autism. The promise of her work was recognized with the Dean's Scholar Award, which provided the funding to undertake the project. Ali was slated to present her findings at Miami's Undergraduate Research Forum and the Ohio Speech-Language-Hearing Association Annual Meeting.\n\nAli's passion isn't confined to the research lab. She is currently the president of both the Miami Autism Allies Club and Miami's chapter of the National Student Speech Language Hearing Association. In these organizations, Ali works to raise advocacy on campus and research funds for national efforts. Ali has also been an active member of Best Buddies for her entire tenure at Miami, is in a social sorority, and was a member of the Miami Sign Language and Deaf Culture Awareness Club.\n\nMexico City, Mexico | Mechanical Engineering Major\n\nInés’ time at Miami literally and figuratively revolves around skating. She has earned two silver medals at the U.S. Figure Skating Intercollegiate National Novice level and, before coming to Miami, represented Mexico at the 2015 Ballet on Ice Nations Cup in Paris and was the Mexican National Figure Skating Champion for Intermedios II in 2013. However, it is her dedication to teaching skating that makes Inés an embodiment of Love + Honor. Ines has taught and mentored countless young skaters in Miami’s Learn to Skate program and is the program’s most requested instructor. “Miss Inés” is also the most sought-after coach in the Miami Skating Academy, where she currently instructs 11 skaters.\n\nInés has shined in larger roles, as well. She was the competition chair for the inaugural Red Brick Classic, a new competition that brought 300 skaters to our Goggin Ice Center from 20 different universities. She coordinated event logistics and communications across various audiences involved with the event. As if all of that isn’t enough, her nominator said that the most impressive accomplishment was serving as Assistant Show Director for Miami’s annual spring skating show. Over 300 skaters in 32 performances, with costumes, songs, and story lines united by Inés’ vision.\n\nOff the ice, Inés has conducted research in her field of mechanical engineering, is member of a social sorority, and a member of Miami’s Society of Women Engineers.\n\nBangalore, Karnataka, India | International Studies and Quantitative Economics Double Major\n\nVedha's nominator stated that, \"through all of her endeavors, there's a common thread of commitment to helping make the world a better place.\" She has enacted this commitment by starting multiple organizations both on campus and around the world. On campus, Vedha is the founder of Wonder Women, which is composed of college students who provide pro bono consulting to startups led by women from low-income communities. She is currently working to partner Wonder Women with a startup that uses crowd-sourced mapping to provide real-time safety alerts to people in conflict zones. Vedha also founded Behen, a social enterprise that empowers women in India through the sale of reusable menstrual underwear, combatting the common issue of women dropping out of school because they lack access to feminine hygiene products. Vedha worked to design and develop a prototype, conduct market research, and establish partnerships with suppliers in a different hemisphere.\n\nFor her work, Vedha won the United Nations Youth Assembly Impact Challenge, was the Cincinnati regional finalist for the Entrepreneurs' Organization Global Student Entrepreneur Award, was selected as a Forbes Under 30 Scholar, and was listed on the Her Campus 22 Under 22 Most Inspiring College Women. Vedha has also served as a Resident Assistant for her junior and senior years and conducted research in economics.\n\nElk City, Oklahoma | Sport Leadership and Management Major\n\nAddison walked into the Athletics office as a first-year student asking for ways to get involved, and has been ingrained in the fabric of ICA since. He has worked in almost all aspects of Athletics, including tickets, marketing, promotions, game operations, development, diversity & inclusion initiatives, student-athlete leadership academy, and Myaamia Center partnerships. One nominator stated that, \"though not a student-athlete, I would venture that Addison has invested as many hours in this department as they do!\"\n\nAddison is also a member of the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma and a student in the Myaamia Heritage Program, which teaches Myaamia history, language, and culture to Myaamia students from around the country. He is a leader amongst his Myaamia relatives at Miami. He has not only worked to learn the Myaamia language himself, but is a constant encouragement to his peers in the course, including driving his peers 30 minutes to their instructor's house for regular 7am Myaamia breakfasts, where only Myaamia was spoken for two hours. His senior research project, which combines his learning in his major and in the Myaamia Heritage Program, is to create a series of teaching videos that teach Myammia people to play lacrosse.\n\nAddison also regularly volunteers with the Miami Tribe's summer youth camp program, teaching other Myaamia in Indiana and Oklahoma their language and culture. On campus, he is the current president of the Sport Leadership & Management club.\n\nFishers, Indiana | Black World Studies and Psychology Double Major\n\nLauren Poythress' engagement at Miami, wide in scope, has had the common thread of inclusive excellence. She was a member of the President's Working Group for Committing to a Diverse and Inclusive Community, where she was assigned the question of \"how can we use our existing mechanisms to help the Miami family recognize and combat bigotry and intolerance.\" Her final recommendations were presented to President Crawford and many are being implemented on campus. Lauren and her peers represented Miami at the 9th Annual National Civil Rights Conference and were instrumental in securing Miami as the host site for the 10th Annual Conference. She is currently involved in the conference planning.\n\nLauren has also been deeply engaged with the Government Relations Network and Office of Institutional Relations. She led planning for the Government Relations Immersion Program, which took 24 students to Washington, D.C. to sharpen their advocacy skills in Capitol Hill meetings. Lauren enhanced the program by adding visits to area law schools for the 15 upper-class students on the trip. As a result of her success in this role, Lauren was appointed deputy chief of staff in Institutional Relations, where she assists with the planning and implementation of Miami's advocacy events with legislators in Ohio and Washington, D.C. She often served as the moderator, introducing President and Dr. Crawford and Board of Trustees members, and shared her Miami experience with lawmakers. She currently serves as the chief of staff in Institutional Relations.\n\nLauren is also a member of a social sorority and Miami's National Black Law Student Association Pre-Law Chapter, was a Student Court Justice, the inaugural president of the Bridges Scholars Organization, and a peer leader in Miami My Place. She has served as an undergraduate associate in multiple courses, conducted research in two different disciplines, and is a tutor at a community center in Hamilton.\n\nCincinnati, Ohio | Small Business Management Major\n\n\"J is one of those students who can recognize needs and acts to fulfill that need,\" wrote one nominator. He is a well-known student across both of our Regional campuses. J has been deeply involved in several roles within the Regional Office of Student Activities and Orientation (ROSA) and a theme of accessibility and inclusion runs through his accomplishments. In his role as a student ambassador this year, J coordinated one of the Regionals' largest events, Spring Fling, with a level of event planning often seen in entry-level professionals. In addition to coordinating the logistics of communicating with organizations and departments and managing RSVPs, J took ownership of ensuring an accessible layout for the event. In his responsibilities coordinating social media for ROSA, J makes sure all videos, images, and posts are accessible with alt-text and captioning.\n\nOne need J recognized and acted on was mental health. He worked with the Regional Student Counseling Services to create All About You, a student organization dedicated to raising awareness of mental health concerns and available resources. Similarly, after attending the Association for the Promotion of Campus Activities Conference, J recognized an opportunity to educate student leaders at Miami. He created a student organization officer training on implicit bias for this spring. J has also served as an orientation leader and a peer tutor, further creating an environment where all students feel welcome and have resources to succeed.\n\nYoungstown, Ohio | Anthropology and Finance Double Major\n\nDante is Miami's current Student Body Vice President. In this role, he not only collaborated with University administration to create legislation and sustainable initiatives for the campus, but also directed the annual mental health forum, and chaired committees related to student health and wellness, diversity and inclusion, and community engagement. One nominator wrote that \"Dante has been instrumental in the changes that have occurred in ASG this year, particularly around campus visibility of the organization.\"\n\nIn 2018 Dante received an Undergraduate Summer Research Scholar award and traveled to Lithuania with one nominator to research LGBTQ+ rights and meet with leaders and members of the LGBTQ+ community. However, Dante didn't confine his findings only to Lithuania. After returning to Oxford, Dante presented his findings at the Diversity Affairs Council Inclusion Forum and the Multicultural Student Leadership Conference, drawing parallels between Lithuania and issues of gender, sexuality, and stereotypes at Miami. He took his knowledge and passion further by creating a presentation in a business course for clients to advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, particularly around the mentoring of LGBTQ+ youth.\n\nDante has also served as an undergraduate associate in the Department of Anthropology and represented the department for Make It Miami, is a past president of the Honors Student Advisory Board, a member of a social fraternity, and conducted a medical mission trip to Peru with MedLife.\n\nMcLean, Virginia | Quantitative Economics and Sustainability Double Major\n\nSarah's nominator wrote that Sarah \"has sought to integrate her academic focus on economics and sustainability, her role in student government, and her efforts as a community leader in Green Oxford.\" Sarah served as a College of Arts and Science academic senate for two years, and is the current Speaker of the Senate for the Associated Student Government (ASG). Another nominator wrote that Sarah uses her role as speaker to \"connect senators to the right people\" on campus to move issues forward. She worked with the Diversity & Inclusion Committee to name residence hall lounges after the three student activists killed in the Freedom Summer murders and worked with the On-Campus Affairs committee to coordinate the meal swipe donation program to combat food insecurity.\n\nSarah also fostered collaborations to benefit Miami's Institute for Food, where she first volunteered and then completed an internship. During her internship, Sarah spent hours learning about regenerative farming and the marketing and distribution of locally grown produce. This led to her market research study about potential products that could increase demand for local produce, settling on salsa and marinara sauce. Sarah conducted taste tests, met with local farmers, and worked with a local food processor to determine costs and pricing. She created the Oxford Local branding, and ushered the products through production and distribution, all to highlight the \"triple bottom line: of people, profits, and planet.\n\nDuring her time at Miami, Sarah also conducted humanities research, was an intramural supervisor and official, completed an internship at the Federal Research Board of Governors, and serves as the current captain of the Women's Club Ultimate Frisbee team.\n\nCleveland, Ohio | Media & Culture and Fashion(Entrepreneurship) Co-Major\n\nOne nominator said that Jermaine \"has the innate ability to connect with his peers, relate to his advisors, and interact professionally with all whom he crosses paths.\" During his sophomore year, Jermaine was instrumental in the Black Action Movement 2.0, formed to address an incident of racism and general climate for students of color on campus. Jermaine and his fraternity swiftly organized the Black State of the Union which he opened and moderated, including remarks by President Crawford. Jermaine was later elected president of his fraternity and is the 2019 president of the National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC). One major accomplishment in his time as president is the collaboration with the Interfraternity Council and Panhellenic Association to implement a monthly mental health awareness training series for all chapter presidents. The 45 leaders came together for conversations about supporting each other and their members, programming ideas, and more. Jermaine was also the vision for the creation of an NPHC drive-in conference with members from schools elsewhere in the region. These are all evidence of Jermaine's ability to forge connections and turn a vision into reality.\n\nAnother example of these qualities is Jermaine's work with Miami University Fashion & Design, one of Miami's largest student organizations, where he serves as the co-modeling director. In this role Jermaine facilitated the audition process, choosing 60 models from over 200 students. He supervises the models in weekly rehearsals and conducts monthly Model & Lifestyle Committee meetings to teach members skills on social media branding and runway and commercial modeling techniques.\n\nJermaine has also served on the Presidential Working Group on Diversity & Inclusion, the recent Dean of Students search committee, as an undergraduate associate for UNV 101, secretary of the Miami University Gospel Singers, a MADE@Miami peer mentor, a Summer Scholars counselor, and completed a NASPA Undergraduate Fellowship.\n\nMentor, Ohio | Political Science Major\n\n\"Joseph is an ambassador for Miami,\" wrote one nominator, speaking about his embodiment of the Miami spirit in engagement with peers, alumni and public officials. Working in our Office of Institutional Relations as chief of staff, Joseph is often tasked with projects involving President and Doctor Crawford, Board of Trustees members, state lawmakers, and more. He oversaw the planning process for 70 participants to travel to Washington D.C. and the Ohio Statehouse through the Alternative Spring Break Advocacy and Leadership conferences. This included over 200 legislative office meetings, an hour meeting with the Governor, preparation of briefing materials, and hosting of briefings for student, faculty, and staff participants. Due to his success in planning those conferences, Joseph was asked to plan a new Statehouse Takeover Day for the President's Office, which was the largest legislative event in Miami's history. Joseph also worked with the President's Office to coordinate Convocation 2018 and coordinated Wil Haygood's signing of 5,500 copies of Tigerland. In total, Joseph has planned over 1,500 meetings and events during his time in the Office of Institutional Relations.\n\nElsewhere on campus, Joseph is involved with the First Miami University Student Federal Credit Union, currently serving as the chairman of the supervisory board for one of only three student-run federal credit unions in the U.S. He was the secretary-general for Miami's Model United Nations, co-founded Miami University Independents, and completed an internship for a U.S. Representative. Joseph is also a College of Arts and Science Dean's Scholar, researching contemporary nationalism and public policy in Europe.\n\nCamden, Ohio | Nursing Major\n\nOne nominator wrote that Tristen has an \"ability to communicate and collaborate with the care team in a way that many staff nurses can't even do.\" She is currently the president of the Miami University Nursing Student Association (MUNSA). Tristen first assumed the role of president of our Middletown campus student nursing organization and led a culture change in the group, moving it to a Red Brick Rewards Level 3. In her second year, she worked with the Hamilton campus student nursing organization to combine as our Regionals nursing program moved to one campus location. Tristen's leadership helped smooth this transition and she continues to lead the organization. Under her leadership, MUNSA has organized multiple donation drives, two 5Ks to raise funds for community organizations, and other activities that benefit the community and MUNSA members.\n\nTristen was instrumental in planning and implementing the New Nursing Student Orientation for both our Hamilton and Oxford campuses. She took initiative to work with Oxford campus nursing students to start their nursing student organization and assisted in the process. These actions contributed to a sense of collegiality between nursing students on the two campuses. Tristen was chosen as the Miami University Nursing Induction Ceremony speaker this year.\n\nIn addition to completing her degree in Nursing, Tristen works as an emergency tech at the McCullough Hyde Memorial Hospital in Oxford and is a 4-H club advisor. Tristen's work at McCullough Hyde was recognized with the TriHealth Living Our Values award, which \"honors exceptional team members who embody our values, go the extra mile, and inspire us all in the process.\""
