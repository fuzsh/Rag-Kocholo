        "text": "Billie Eilish is up for her second Oscar nomination!\n\nShortly after the nominations for the 96th annual Academy Awards were announced on Tuesday, the pop star, 22, and her collaborator/brother Finneas O'Connell opened up about how thrilled they are to have received a Best Original Song nomination for their Barbie contribution “What Was I Made For?.”\n\nThe Grammy winner shared an adorable photo of herself hugging the film’s star/producer Margot Robbie on Instagram, as well as a shot of the scene in which the tender ballad plays in the movie. On the latter, the sibling duo released a joint statement.\n\n“We are so incredibly honored to receive a nomination for 'What Was I Made For?'” the hitmakers’ statement began. “As lifelong fans of film, music in film and the Academy Awards, this means everything to us.

There was a stretch of time during which my wife Suleika was in the hospital and we weren't sure she'd make it. This song began as a lullaby, so she could have a restful aura in the hospital room.”\n\nHe continued, “Congratulations to my co-writer, Dan Wilson, and thank you to Netflix, Mercury Studios, Higher Ground, and our brilliant director, Matthew Heineman, for sharing our story with the world.
