        "text": "John Borden Evans is a Charlottesville, Virginia-based painter. Working close to his home and heart, John produces lush acrylic-on-canvas paintings of the peaceful pastoral scenes. Inspired by the process of painting itself, and by the play of light, shadow, and the seasons on the natural landscape, he alternates between building up and scraping down layers of pigment, creating richly textured surfaces that capture the physicality of his subject matter, and his memories. His subjects range from free-roaming farm animals like cows and chickens to sweeping skies over rolling hills to closely observed trees and manmade features dotting grassy expanses.\n\nOver the years, Johnâ€™s paintings have become more and more about place. That place is his immediate environment, the cattle fields, the trees, the fences and the skies."
