        "text": "Motion picture award for music\n\nAcademy Award for Best Original ScoreCountryUnited StatesPresented byAcademy of Motion Picture Arts and SciencesFirst awardedFebruary 27, 1935; 89 years ago ( )Most recent winnerLudwig Göransson\n\nOppenheimer (2023)Most awardsAlfred Newman (9)Most nominationsJohn Williams (48)Websiteoscars .org\n\nThe Academy Award for Best Original Score is an award presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) to the best substantial body of music in the form of dramatic underscoring written specifically for the film by the submitting composer.[1] Some pre-existing music is allowed, though, but a contending film must include a minimum of original music. This minimum since 2021 is established as 35% of the music, which is raised to 80% for sequels and franchise films.[2] Fifteen scores are shortlisted before nominations are announced.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Academy began awarding movies for their scores in 1935. The category was originally called Best Scoring. At the time, winners and nominees were a mix of original scores and adaptations of pre-existing material. Following the controversial win of Charles Previn for One Hundred Men and a Girl in 1938, a film without a credited composer that featured pre-existing classical music, the Academy added a Best Original Score category in 1939.[3] In 1942, the distinction between the two Scoring categories changed slightly as they were renamed to Best Music Score of a Dramatic Picture and Best Scoring of a Musical Picture.[4] This marked the first time the category was split into separate genres, a distinction that technically still lasts today, although there haven't been enough submissions for the musical category to be activated since 1985. From 1942 to 1985, musical scores had their own category, with the exception of 1958, 1981, and 1982. During that time, both categories had many name changes:\n\nFollowing the wins of four Walt Disney Feature Animation films in six years from 1990 to 1995 (The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King) during a period called the Disney Renaissance, it was decided to once again split the Best Original Score category by genres, this time by combining comedies and musicals together. As Alan Bergman, the chairman of the Academy's music branch said, \"People were voting for the songs, not the underscores. We felt that Academy members outside the music branch didn't distinguish between the two. So when a score like The Lion King is competing against a drama like Forrest Gump, it's apples and oranges – not in the quality of the score, but in the way it functions in the movie. There's a big difference.\"[5] The category was therefore split into Best Original Dramatic Score and Best Original Musical or Comedy Score in 1996. This change proved unpopular in the other branches of the Academy as Charles Bernstein, chairman of the Academy's rules committee, noted that \"no other Oscar category depended on a film's genre\" and \"the job of composing an underscore for a romantic comedy is not substantially different from working on a heavy drama.\"[5] This split was reverted in 2000.\n\nIn 2020, rules were changed to require that a film's score include a minimum of 60% original music. Franchise films and sequels must include a minimum of 80% new music.[6] In 2021, the rules were changed again, lowering the minimum percentage of original music from 60% to 35% of the total music in the film.[7]\n\nAcademy Award for Best Original Musical\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Academy Award for Best Original Musical is a category that was re-established in 2000 after the Best Original Musical or Comedy Score category was retired. It has never been awarded in its present form due to a prolonged drought of films meeting the sufficient eligibility requirements. The Music Branch Executive Committee of the Academy decides whether there are enough quality submissions to justify its activation.[8]\n\nAccording to the rules, the Best Original Musical is defined as follows:\n\nAn original musical consists of not fewer than five original songs by the same writer or team of writers, either used as voiceovers or visually performed. Each of these songs must be substantively rendered, clearly audible, intelligible, and must further the storyline of the motion picture. An arbitrary group of songs unessential to the storyline will not be considered eligible.[8]\n\nWinners and nominees\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following is the list of nominated composers organized by year, and listing both films and composers. The years shown in the following list of winners are the production years, thus a reference to 1967 means the Oscars presented in 1968 for films released in 1967.\n\n1930s\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Film Nominees 1934\n\n(7th)\n\n[note 1] One Night of Love Columbia Studio Music Department, Louis Silvers, head of department (Thematic music by Victor Schertzinger and Gus Kahn) The Gay Divorcee RKO Radio Studio Music Department, Max Steiner, head of department (Score by Kenneth Webb and Sam Hoffenstein) The Lost Patrol RKO Radio Studio Music Department, Steiner, head of department (Score by Steiner) 1935\n\n(8th) The Informer RKO Radio Studio Music Department, Max Steiner, head of department (Score by Steiner) Captain Blood (write-in)[note 2][9] Warner Bros.-First National Studio Music Department, Leo F.
