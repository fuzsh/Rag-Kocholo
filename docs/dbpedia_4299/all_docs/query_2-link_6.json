        "text": "You may have thought there were two music categories – best original song and best original score. Actually, there are three. The Academy has had a best original musical category on the books since 2000. There just haven’t been enough strong potential nominees in any year since then for the Academy to activate the category.\n\nHere’s the rule: “The category of original musical may be activated only by special request of the music branch executive committee to the board of governors in a year when the field of eligible submissions is determined to be of sufficient quantity and quality to justify award competition.”\n\nThe original musical category originated as original song score, which was one of the three music categories on the books from the 1981 awards through the 1994 awards. It was presented just three times, to Victor/Victoria (1982), Yentl (1983) and, most memorably, Purple Rain (1984).\n\nFrom the 1995 awards through the 1998 awards, the original score category was reconfigured into two scoring categories: original dramatic score and original musical or comedy score – which incorporated song score. Pocahontas was the only musical to win in those four years. (The other three winners were comedies.)\n\nFor the 1999 awards, the Oscars went back to a single original score category, ending the division between dramatic and musical or comedy scores. The award for original song score was reinstated (but not presented). In the 2000 awards, original song score was renamed original musical, though it still wasn’t presented. In the 2001 awards, a provision was added that original musical may not be presented every year. It has remained on the books on that basis ever since and has yet to be activated.\n\nHere’s how the rules define the category: “An original musical consists of not fewer than five original songs by the same writer or team of writers, either used as voiceovers or visually performed. Each of these songs must be substantively rendered, clearly audible, and intelligible, and must further the storyline of the motion picture. An arbitrary group of songs unessential to the storyline will not be considered eligible.”\n\nThis past year, Encanto, with eight songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda, would have been a strong candidate, but there weren’t enough other potential candidates of note to round out a category, in the view of the music branch executive committee.\n\nThough the category is called best original musical, the nominees would be the composer(s) and lyricist(s), not the film’s producer(s) or director(s).\n\nNow wait a minute, you may be saying, just last year Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross and Jon Batiste won best original score for Soul. Is this a new rule? No. The rule was on the books then. And those three composers all won Oscars – but they didn’t all get to take home trophies.\n\nHere’s the rule: “No more than one statuette will normally be given in the original score category. A second statuette may be awarded when two credited composers function as equal collaborators, each contributing fully to the original dramatic underscore for the film. In cases where three or more credited composers function as equal collaborators, a single statuette may be awarded to the group. Each composer must agree to the single ‘group statuette’ option by signing and returning a ‘group award form’ prior to the submission deadline. Final determination of the awardable composers in the group will be made by the music branch executive committee.”\n\nIncredibly, Reznor, Ross and Batiste share one Oscar trophy. Reznor and Ross each have an Oscar trophy from when they won 10 years earlier for The Social Network. The addition of a third collaborator (Batiste) on Soul meant that they couldn’t each take home an Oscar. That’s unfortunate, because that cross-genre collaboration is what many found most attractive about the score.\n\nThis rule seems excessively rigid, but we don’t make the rules, we just report on them. For the record, in the past, there were eight times when three-person or even four-person teams won scoring Oscars.\n\nFour-person teams have won scoring Oscars on three occasions. The Beatles won best original song score for Let It Be (1970); Saul Chaplin, Johnny Green, Irwin Kostal and Sid Ramin won best scoring of a musical picture for West Side Story (1961); and Richard Hageman, W. Franke Harling, John Leipold and Leo Shuken won best scoring for Stagecoach (1939).\n\nThere have been five other times when three-person teams won scoring awards, most recently at the 1987 Oscars when Ryuichi Sakamoto, David Byrne and Cong Su won best original score for The Last Emperor.\n\nUnder today’s rules all of these four-member and three-member teams would be out-of-luck in terms of each participant taking home an Oscar. The Academy might want to take another look at this rule. Do they really think each member of The Beatles should have had to sign and return a “group award form” agreeing that they wouldn’t each receive a trophy prior to the submission deadline?\n\nHere’s the rule: “No more than two statuettes will normally be given in the original song category. A third statuette may be awarded when there are three essentially equal writers of a song. The music branch executive committee has the right, in what it alone determines to be a very rare and extraordinary circumstance, to award a fourth statuette.\n\n“In cases where five or more credited songwriters function as collaborators, a single statuette may be awarded to the group. Each songwriter must agree to the single ‘group statuette’ option by signing and returning a ‘group award form’ prior to the submission deadline. Final determination of the awardable songwriters in the group will be made by the music branch executive committee.”\n\nThere has never been a time when a five-member songwriting team has won an Oscar. (It’s a different story at the Grammys, where an eight-member team won song of the year in January 2018 for co-writing Bruno Mars’ smash “That’s What I Like.” And this year an 11-member team was nominated for (but lost) song of the year for co-writing the Justin Bieber-led smash “Peaches.”)\n\nTwice in Oscar history, a four-member team has won best original song. Lady Gaga, Mark Ronson, Anthony Rossomando and Andrew Wyatt shared the 2018 Oscar for co-writing “Shallow” from A Star Is Born. Peter Allen, Burt Bacharach, Christopher Cross and Carole Bayer Sager shared the 1981 award for co-writing “Arthur’s Theme (Best That You Can Do)” from Arthur.\n\nBacharach and Sager co-wrote the latter song with Cross, who was coming off unprecedented sweep of the “Big Four” Grammy Awards. Sager gave Allen a co-writing credit because she took the line “caught between the moon and New York City” from an old, unpublished song that they had written together. (Allen came up with the line one night when his plane was in a holding pattern during a night arrival at JFK.) That was a classy move on Sager’s part, but then again Allen’s lyric was the best and most memorable line in “Arthur’s Theme.” Under current rules, Allen’s contribution to the song would likely have been judged unworthy of a nomination or an award.\n\nHere’s the rule: “Only the principal composer(s) or songwriter(s) responsible for the conception and execution of the work as a whole shall be eligible for an award. Expressly excluded from eligibility are…partial contributors (i.e., any writer not responsible for the overall design of the work).”\n\nAnd there’s this: “The work must be the result of a creative interaction between the filmmaker(s) and the composer(s) and/or songwriter(s) who have been engaged to work directly on the motion picture.”\n\nHere’s the rule: “Original song submissions must be accompanied by a digital video clip of no more than three minutes of each song, showing how the song is used in the motion picture.”\n\nThe submitters are allowed to make “jump cuts” in the clip if they want to showcase different portions of the film where the song plays. The Oscars won’t disqualify a song if the submitted digital video clip runs over three minutes—but the clip will be edited before it goes on the reel of best original song nominees from which the members of the music branch make their choices.\n\nThe Academy’s preference is for the submitters to make the edits before sending the clip, but if they don’t, the Oscars will ask them to shorten it and resubmit. If there is no response, the Oscars typically make the cut on their end by simply deleting everything past the three-minute mark.\n\n(You don’t mess with the Oscars.)\n\nHere’s the rule: “A score must be created specifically for the eligible feature-length motion picture and comprise a minimum of 35% of the total music in the film.” The Academy dropped the required percentage from 60% last year.\n\n“If a score does not meet the minimum 35%, the composer may submit a letter to the branch executive committee, stating reasons for the score to be accepted for consideration. All letters must be received by the due dates published by the Academy for the current awards cycle. The decision of the music branch executive committee shall be final.”\n\nThat appeal mechanism would add a degree of reasonableness to some of these other rules. (Rules are necessary, of course. But rules can be too strict, just as they can be too lenient. The trick is find the right balance.)\n\nHere’s another rule: “In cases such as sequels and franchises from any media, the score must consist of more than 80% newly composed music which does not contain any pre-existing themes borrowed from previous scores in the franchise.”\n\nHere’s a quick refresher course on how voting works: The 377 voting members of the music branch vote to determine the shortlists of 15 “semi-finalists” and, later, the five nominees for both best original song and best original score. The entire voting membership of the Academy (10,105-strong) votes to determine the winners.\n\nBut in the first two rounds of voting, voters don’t simply check off one song or score. Instead, they rank all of the contenders. When ballots are collected, a song or score advances if it was ranked first by more than 50 percent of the voters. If no entry captures a majority, whichever entry receives the fewest votes is eliminated, and those voters who ranked that eliminated song or score first have their second-place pick moved up to first-place. The elimination goes on until one entry earns more than 50 percent of the votes.\n\nThis preferential ballot voting system is used in the first two phases of voting in the music categories — and in nearly all other categories as well. But in the final round, the voting is decided the old-fashioned way (“just pick one”). It’s only in the best picture category that they use preferential ballot voting system in the final round.\n\nHere’s an explainer video the Academy prepared on the preferential voting system."
