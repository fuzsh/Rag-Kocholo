        "text": "Bexley Womenâs Club started the womenâs award in 2021 to recognize extraordinary women in the Bexley community who lead by example, live their purpose, and inspire others to act within our community. Bexley Womenâs Club would like to ignite their momentum for others and to move our mission forward by recognizing superior work by women as champions.\n\nPlease investigate your network to find women leaders who are exceptional. We want to encourage them to elevate their leadership and to recognize their achievement so that we continue to inspire the next generation of leaders.\n\nHere are the award categories:\n\nAdult\n\n- Community Service Award\n\nCommunity service is work done by a person or group of people that benefits others. This includes professionals that go beyond the boundaries of their job but can also include women that are acting as citizens to improve the community. The service is often near the area where they live, so their own community reaps the benefit of their work. Community service is broader than social service in that it can help many different groups: children, senior citizens, people with disabilities, inclusivity programs to enrich diversity, animals, and the environment, etc.\n\n- Social Service Award\n\nFor these nominees, we define social service in broader terms such that the service may affect more than one social service impact area. Social services safeguard and promote the welfare of vulnerable children and adults and can provide a wide range of services to children and their parents, groups, or organizations usually within the home environment or within the community. This may include the benefits and facilities like education, food pantry, health care, etc. Typically, a social service project focus is narrower in scope than community service. Examples are food subsidies for an organization or small community. Â The impact may be great, with a smaller focus area.\n\n- Scholastic Enrichment Award\n\nThe Scholastic Enrichment Award is provided to an adult woman who has supported other in their efforts to learn, for example, a new language, skill, improved literacy, home financial methods, and nutrition support.\n\nThis awardee shall have demonstrated leadership within the formal or non-traditional learning environments.\n\nAdult learner and how their education/learning impacts the community:\n\n- Has improved the life situation(s) of self/others because of their learning experience.\n\n- Has demonstrated leadership within formal or non-traditional learning environments.\n\n- Has been supportive of others engaged in adult learning.\n\nYouth\n\n- Community Service Award (Grades 6-8)\n\nCommunity service is work done by a person or group of people that benefits others. This includes students that go beyond the boundaries of their school but can also include girls that are acting as citizens to improve the community. This is often near the area where they live, so their own community reaps the benefit of their work. Community service is broader than social service in that it can help many different groups: children, senior citizens, people with disabilities, inclusivity programs to enrich diversity, animals, and the environment, etc.\n\n- Community Service Award (Grades 9-12)\n\nCommunity service is work done by a person or group of people that benefits others. This includes students that go beyond the boundaries of their school but can also include girls that are acting as citizens to improve the community. This is often near the area where they live, so their own community reaps the benefit of their work. Community service is broader than social service in that it can help many different groups: children, senior citizens, people with disabilities, inclusivity programs to enrich diversity, animals, and the environment, etc."
