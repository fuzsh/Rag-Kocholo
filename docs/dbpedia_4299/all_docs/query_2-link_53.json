        "text": "Indeed, Wright received his first best actor nomination for his portrayal of Thelonious Ellison, an author whose works no one reads until, in a moment of fury, he composes a story overflowing with Black clichés under a pseudonym, and it becomes a best seller. The performance has already earned him Critics Choice, Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild nominations.\n\nDid he really think he might not hear his name?\n\n“One never knows,” he said. Still, “I’m really proud of this film and the work that all of us put into it. We thought while we were making it that we might be onto something good and something interesting and topical, but also buoyant. We thought we might be making a special film, and it seems that audiences who have taken it in have appreciated the story in the ways that we did.”\n\nIn a video interview, Wright spoke about his character, known as Monk, as a dream role, and why the film’s Oscar nominations — including best picture; adapted screenplay for its director, Cord Jefferson; supporting actor for Sterling K. Brown; and original score for Laura Karpman — matter.\n\nWill he do anything special to mark this milestone?\n\n“Yeah, I’m going to celebrate by driving my daughter back to college in a few hours,” he said, chuckling. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.\n\nWhat makes these nominations important?\n\nBecause we are the little guys here. We made this film in 25 days, then an additional day after, a few cuts were completed. Our budget was probably the craft services budget for some of the other films out there. So it shines light on our film that ideally will lead audiences to it in greater numbers. And that’s why we make these things. We make them so that people will be intrigued by them and moved by them.\n\nIs it true that Cord wrote the role of Monk with you in mind?\n\nThat’s what he said. He sent me an email through the usual suspects, my agents, with the script attached and a letter. And in that letter, he described how meaningful Percival Everett’s novel “Erasure” had been for him upon reading it. And he described that when he began to adapt the screenplay, and maybe even when he was reading the book, that he read the character hearing my voice. He hoped that I would be as compelled by the material as he was, and he then said, “Because I have no Plan B.”\n\nWere you as compelled?\n\nI was intrigued on reading the first scene, which I thought was sharply drawn and smart and funny, and a wonderful framing of a conversation that we are having in America in many different rooms, but not necessarily having in a productive way. Not that the portrayal in our film is a productive conversation, but it is managed with a fluency in race and language and history and context that Cord has that was really wonderful to read. I was excited too, to have the opportunity to play that scene.\n\nThat scene is the beginning of this journey toward the social commentary and satire within our film. But what I was drawn to on an emotional level was the more kind of plainly human side that focuses on a man and his relationship to love and to his family. There were so many overlaps for Cord in reading the book, and likewise, there were overlaps for me, particularly because of experiences that I had had just prior to receiving the script.\n\nOverlaps?\n\nMy son saw the film — he’s in his early 20s — and he said, “I identified a lot with the journey of your character.” And then he said, “And it’s also a beautiful homage to Grandma,” and I said to him, “You got it.” His grandmother, my mother, passed away about a little over a year before I got the email from Cord. And so there were resonances for me that were really striking.\n\nWere you and Cord on the same page with Monk?\n\nOne of the things that he and I discussed many times was that this not be a kind of classist celebration of the Black bourgeoisie, but that he be flawed and that there be a balance to our story to avoid that. We talked about that at length, that Monk not necessarily be seen as preaching the gospel, but that he be frustrated and somewhat misanthropic, caring and funny, but also a bit frustrating and arrogant at times. We wanted to make sure that his dimensions were human and that there was room within him for criticism, and as a result for transformation and growth.\n\nWhat I love about the character’s journey is that he’s not the same man at the end of the film that he is in the beginning. I think there’s something in the human condition that wants to repeat the same mistakes over and over again as individuals and generationally. And so the opportunity to show someone who maybe by force goes through a process of self-examination and evolution is a useful one.\n\nSo this was a kind of dream role?\n\nIt felt, while this was one of the most enjoyable experiences that I’ve had working on a film, there was a growing momentum while we were filming that we were onto something that could have meaning beyond ourselves. It was just one of those kinds of special ones that you experience, if you’re fortunate, from time to time in which everyone is working in a wonderfully harmonious way toward the common end of realizing the vision making a good film. So in that regard, yeah, it was kind of a dream to work on this one.\n\nWhat does the nomination mean for your career?\n\nThere’s such wonderful work out there this year. I know as well that this isn’t necessarily entirely about the work. I know that we’re not in this position without the tremendous amount of support that we’ve received from our producers and the studio. I’ve never experienced the level of support for a project that I’ve been so central to in my career. And the awards obviously have pragmatic value that they put butts in seats potentially, as is said. I try not to focus on these things at all when I’m working on these possibilities. [Laughs] That said, sure — if they’re handing these things out, we’ll take them.\n\nHave you seen “American Fiction” yourself and, if so, what did you think?\n\nI saw it once here in Brooklyn at BAM, and it was useful because there’s a real detachment from the audience when you work on film. You don’t really have a resolution to the process until it’s delivered to an audience, and so it was helpful to me.\n\nThe thing I think that I was most moved by was just this collection of people that made up this family. It’s a family I think that we don’t often see on screens in cinemas. And I looked up at one point and I just said to myself, “Wow, what beautiful people.”\n\nNominated for: Best picture, director, actor, supporting actor, supporting actress, adapted screenplay, production design, costume design, cinematography, editing, makeup and hairstyling, sound, original score.\n\nHow to watch: Stream it on Peacock. Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube.\n\nConjuring the dark wizardry of the Manhattan Project, the director Christopher Nolan turned the Trinity test into a seat-rumbling summer spectacle, placing it at the center of “Oppenheimer” like the nuclear core of 20th-century history. But there’s a disturbing intimacy to the film as well, with Cillian Murphy’s tremulous J. Robert Oppenheimer leading an unstable band of scientists while nearly drowning in uncharted political and ethical waters. In exploring the origins of a technological boogeyman that continues to haunt mankind, Nolan embraces the contradictions of the flawed, brilliant man whose spirit seems to embody it.\n\n‘Barbie’\n\nNominated for: Best picture, supporting actor, supporting actress, adapted screenplay, production design, costume design, original song (two nominees).\n\nHow to watch: Stream it on Max. Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube.\n\nPerhaps “Barbie” was destined to become the year’s biggest box-office phenomenon, but Greta Gerwig had to thread a very thin needle in creating a pop entertainment of buoyancy and substance. While playing off the fizzy appeal of the fashionable plastic doll that has lined toy shelves for over half a century, Gerwig seizes the opportunity to reflect on the distance between Barbie’s vision of womanhood and the troubling messiness of reality. As Gerwig’s bruised idealist, Margot Robbie’s Barbie keeps the tone light as she journeys from the matriarchal paradise of Barbieland to the real world, which isn’t the utopia she might have imagined.\n\n‘Killers of the Flower Moon’\n\nNominated for: Best picture, director, actress, supporting actor, production design, costume design, cinematography, editing, original score, original song.\n\nHow to watch: Stream it on Apple TV+. Buy it on Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.\n\nThe nativist skirmishes and corruption that have defined so many of Martin Scorsese’s gangster (and non-gangster) dramas surface again in this sprawling epic of American greed and violence, based on David Grann’s historical nonfiction book. Set in the oil-rich Osage territory of 1920s Oklahoma, “Killers of the Flower Moon” looks into a murderous conspiracy to wrest claim rights away from the native population. At the film’s center is the toxic love story between an Osage woman (Lily Gladstone) and an impressionable war veteran (Leonardo DiCaprio) whose affection for her is clouded by his relationship to his scheming uncle (Robert De Niro) and a taste for the finer things.\n\n‘The Holdovers’\n\nNominated for: Best picture, actor, supporting actress, original screenplay, editing.\n\nHow to watch: Stream it on Peacock. Buy it on Apple TV, Google Play, YouTube, Vudu and Amazon.\n\nReuniting for the first time since “Sideways” nearly 20 years ago, the director Alexander Payne and his lovably cantankerous star, Paul Giamatti, have made a film (destined to become a future holiday staple) about the relationship between three people left to themselves over Christmas in 1970. Giamatti stars as the least-liked teacher at an elite New England boarding school, assigned to babysit the small handful of students whose parents didn’t pick them up for the break. After a good deal of friction, he starts to forge a warmer relationship with one troubled student (Dominic Sessa) and the school’s head cook (Da’Vine Joy Randolph), who’s facing her first Christmas since losing her son in Vietnam.\n\n‘Maestro’\n\nNominated for: Best picture, actor, actress, original screenplay, cinematography, makeup and hairstyling, sound.\n\nHow to watch: Stream it on Netflix.\n\nIn his follow-up to “A Star Is Born,” the director/actor Bradley Cooper again turns to the emotionally turbulent life of a musician, casting himself as Leonard Bernstein, the famed American conductor and composer who lived a double life in full. Starting in lustrous black-and-white, “Maestro” depicts the young Bernstein’s intoxicating rise through the New York Philharmonic and his romance with the stage actress Felicia Montealegre (Carey Mulligan) in the 1940s. The film then shifts to color in later decades, as Bernstein’s sexual dalliances and substance abuse take their toll on a marriage that’s under sharp public scrutiny.\n\n‘Anatomy of a Fall’\n\nNominated for: Best picture, director, actress, original screenplay, editing.\n\nHow to watch: Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube.\n\nThe winner of the Palme d’Or at last year’s Cannes Film Festival, Justine Triet’s penetrating drama sounds like a routine did-she-or-didn’t-she courtroom procedural, as a novelist (Sandra Hüller) stands trial for murdering her husband at their Alpine chalet. Yet the courtroom theatrics open up a deeper investigation into a difficult marriage and the toll it exacts on the couple’s legally blind son (Milo Machado Graner), who discovers the body. Though the woman’s innocence is at stake, Triet is more compelled by the domestic tensions leading up to the death and the fallout from the trial.\n\n‘Past Lives’\n\nNominated for: Best picture, original screenplay.\n\nHow to watch: Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube.\n\nIn her heart-rending feature debut as a writer-director, the playwright Celine Song offers a what-if romantic scenario that pulls at the identity of a happily married woman in New York, even decades after she and her family moved from South Korea. Once extremely close childhood friends, Nora (Greta Lee) and Hae Sung (Teo Yoo) reconnect as adults on social media, and meet again in America, where they reminisce and inevitably begin to wonder about the path not taken. Comparisons to Richard Linklater’s “Sunrise” trilogy may be inevitable, but the temptation and longing in “Past Lives” is uniquely complicated by the cultural crosswinds that affect Nora, Hae Sung and Nora’s American husband (John Magaro), who waits patiently in the wings.\n\n‘Nyad’\n\nNominated for: Best actress, supporting actress.\n\nHow to watch: Stream it on Netflix.\n\nAfter directing a series of documentaries about seemingly impossible physical feats, like scaling the 3,000-foot El Capitan rock wall without ropes (“Free Solo”) or pulling off the Thailand cave rescue (“The Rescue”), Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin make a natural transition to features with this biopic about the distance swimmer Diana Nyad. Nyad (Annette Bening) had set several distance records in the 1970s, but the film focuses on her effort to swim from Cuba to Florida at the age of 64, with help from her close friend Bonnie Stoll (Jodie Foster). Vasarhelyi and Chin once again tap into the indomitable spirit of an athlete willing to court death to push the limits.\n\n‘May December’\n\nNominated for: Original screenplay.\n\nHow to watch: Stream it on Netflix.\n\nWith their prismatic take on a tabloid scandal that echoes the Mary Kay Letourneau case, the director Todd Haynes and the screenwriter, Samy Burch, adopt a serio-comic tone that echoes high art like “Persona” one minute and early 2000s USA Network fodder the next. Natalie Portman stars as a semifamous actress who travels to Savannah, Ga., to study for the role of a Letourneau-like woman (Julianne Moore) who was caught having sex with a seventh-grade boy, but wound up marrying him and having children after a prison stint. The actress’s presence, asking simple questions that the couple has been studiously avoiding, destabilizes their relationship, particularly the much-younger husband (Charles Melton), who starts to reflect on what happened to him.\n\n‘Rustin’\n\nNominated for: Best actor.\n\nHow to watch: Stream it on Netflix.\n\nIn championing a less-heralded yet fascinatingly multidimensional figure in the civil rights movement, “Rustin” gains much of its power from Colman Domingo’s electrifying lead performance as Bayard Rustin, a gay activist and socialist who had the ear of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The action leads up to Rustin’s greatest triumph as an organizer, the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, where King delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech in front of an estimated 250,000 people. But “Rustin” digs into the intense internal divisions within the movement over holding the march as a message to the Democratic front-runner John F. Kennedy. It also explores the depth of Rustin’s personal passion for economic justice.\n\nOther Major Nominees\n\n‘Society of the Snow’\n\nNominated for: Best international feature. Makeup and hairstyling.\n\nHow to watch: Stream it on Netflix.\n\n‘Elemental’\n\nNominated for: Best animated feature.\n\nHow to watch: Stream it on Disney+. Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube.\n\n‘Nimona’\n\nNominated for: Best animated feature.\n\nHow to watch: Stream it on Netflix.\n\n‘Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse’\n\nNominated for: Best animated feature.\n\nHow to watch: Stream it on Netflix.

Buy it on Google Play, Vudu, YouTube and Apple TV.\n\n‘Four Daughters’\n\nNominated for: Best documentary feature.\n\nHow to watch: Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube.\n\n‘20 Days in Mariupol’\n\nNominated for: Best documentary feature.\n\nHow to watch: Rent it on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube.\n\nFor Giamatti, 56, the news caps a busy awards season in which he has already received nominations from the BAFTAs and the Screen Actors Guild and won a Golden Globe. In a phone interview from his home in Brooklyn hours after it was announced, the actor shared how he was processing the news. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.\n\nHow do you feel?\n\nI don’t know! I’m not quite sure what to think. It’s a strange thing. It’s very, very nice. I’m very happy, but I’m also just sort of flabbergasted.\n\nWhat’s strange about it? What makes you flabbergasted?\n\nI don’t know, I just never imagined this kind of thing. I just didn’t really ever imagine it. I think it’s a great movie; it’s a wonderful movie. But I didn’t imagine, for me, this being something that people would take to so much. It’s great. It’s really nice.\n\nWhat was your game plan this morning?\n\n[Laughs] I didn’t really have one! I’m a bit of a night owl, and I thought, “I’m just going to sleep in tomorrow. Someone will tell me what happened. I just don’t even want to look.” My manager called and woke me up and told me.\n\nYou were nominated almost 20 years ago for best supporting actor for your role in “Cinderella Man.” Now you’re nominated in the lead category. I think you might have future in this town.\n\nMaybe! Maybe! [Laughs] There’s a little bit of that feeling of like, “OK, maybe I’ve done the right thing with my life. Maybe I’ve done OK.” It’s an affirmation that is really kind of taking me a second to absorb.\n\nHow different was this experience the last time around?\n\nIt was very different. I don’t remember doing anywhere near this much stuff, or the intensity of it. I remember it being much more low key-seeming last time. There’s just much more now than there used to be with all this sort of social media stuff. There’s so many places to make contact with and to be deployed for people to do publicity, I think.\n\nYou’ve already won the Golden Globe. What does it mean to you to have all this happening now, at this stage of your career?\n\nIt’s a very interesting question. And I think it’s one of the things that’s making me sort of flabbergasted. What does this mean for my life? I don’t know. It’s super gratifying. I’m not young anymore and there’s a certain sense of, “Oh, maybe I can take it easy a little bit.”\n\nThe other thing that gives me a thrill about it is the sense of history to it. It’s a link in a chain of this American tradition that goes back to the early days of filmmaking. As a history buff, it’s a really cool thing to be a part of.\n\nBrooks, a past Emmy nominee, Tony nominee and Grammy winner who broke out in “Orange Is the New Black,” is nominated for her supporting actress work in the movie musical “The Color Purple.” Hers is the film’s sole nomination. She plays Sofia, an outspoken woman who knows her own worth and insists on her own autonomy, qualities that make her a target of racialized violence. She first played the part on Broadway in 2015, in a defiant, exuberant turn that The New York Times likened to a “homemade steamroller.” Her film work is perhaps even more irresistible.\n\nSwathed in zebra-print sleepwear, Brooks, 34, discussed, with occasional tears, the joy of the nomination, the differences between theater and film and how she learned to say “Hell, No,” in her own life. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.\n\nHow does it feel to be an Oscar nominee?\n\nIt’s like getting the M.V.P. at the Super Bowl. Crazy. It’s what I always just hoped and dreamed would happen, but for it to actually happen, I’m in shock! It’s like what it says in “The Color Purple”: “Look what God has done.”\n\nWhat did you learn from playing Sofia on Broadway?\n\nThere was such an electricity in the theater, people just had to come see the show. I felt so much pressure. It was playing Sofia, this strong woman who was so sure of herself, that gave me the confidence, every night when I sang “Hell, No,” to say hell, no to my fears. She taught me how to live in my power. Getting to do it on the screen, that’s when I learned how to own my power. People assume that actors have all this confidence and are just brave people, which we are, but we get to hide behind characters. Now I can stand 10 toes down and believe in my heart that I’m worthy of moments like this.\n\nYou were a Tony nominee for that Broadway performance. You won a Grammy. But I’ve read that your audition process for the film took six months. Did you have to fight for the role?\n\nI did. But I came in with no ego, because as much as I wanted to scream from the rooftops, scream all those accolades, there was no reason for that. Because part of our job is to audition. I didn’t want anyone to say that I was handed a role. I wasn’t handed anything. I worked my butt off for that role for six months doing chemistry reads, recording songs, having meetings. I did whatever they asked me to do. And it didn’t miss me. The blessing didn’t miss me. I’m grateful that I did remove ego. Because here we are today.\n\nHow did making the film feel different?\n\nWhen I was doing it in theater, all we had were wooden chairs and a wooden stage. So I used my imagination. But with this I got all the elements I could ever want. I’m actually in the Georgian sun on a plantation. That sets me right where I need to be. It was the biggest gift as an actor. And now today, to be standing in this position, the only one from this movie to get nominated, I’m very humbled. I just feel like there are so many people I’m standing in for who are so deserving and have worked so hard, every cast and crew member who was out there in the beating 90-degree weather, this is for them.\n\nSince you played Sofia in 2015, there’s been a greater cultural focus on racialized violence. Did that influence your work?\n\nSofia’s a radical woman, she’s trying to break generational curses. She’s trying to build her family. She’s trying to build a home and get out of these norms we set for gender roles. That, to me, is a woman ahead of her time. To have so much gumption to say, I’m not going to take no mess from anybody, no matter what shape, size, color, creed you are, I’m going to walk how I want to walk. That is so powerful. And that’s what we need as women. We need examples of that in our storytelling, for people to lean on.\n\nSince you first played the role, you’ve become a mother, a wife. Did that inform this Sofia?\n\nIt deepens the work. I now know truly what sacrifices it takes to be married and hold on to a relationship when the world is just fighting against Black love. I also know the sacrifice of bringing a child in this world. It takes a lot of work! When I played Beatrice [in “Much Ado About Nothing,” 2019] at Shakespeare in the Park, I was five months pregnant with my child, and that was the most freedom I’ve ever had. Having her in my womb reminded me that I’m not alone. And I can do this because now I have someone to do this for. When she was on [“The Color Purple”] set with me, it was the same: I’m not alone and I have someone to do this for.\n\nYour big number is “Hell, No.” Speaking as a woman who apologizes preemptively for everything, I loved it so much. I should apply its lesson more. Do you apply it in your own life?\n\nHell, yeah! It’s the greatest gift to honor what you want as a human being. As women, we apologize for everything. We walk by somebody in the elevator, and we’re like, Oops, sorry. And we have no reason to say sorry! We are trained to be apologetic, to shrink ourselves, to say, oh, my presence shouldn’t be in the room. That’s so not true. We should be strutting around just like Sofia and her sisters, speak up for ourselves and stop apologizing. That’s why I’m so grateful for Sofia. Every character gives you a gift when you play them. And that’s what she taught me. All I need is to validate myself. I don’t need validation from anyone else. I am so grateful for that. But it has to come from me first.\n\n“It’s just a real honor to be involved in a film that has connected so powerfully with people in a way that we never expected,” he added.\n\nIn “Oppenheimer,” a stunning biopic by the director Christopher Nolan, Murphy plays the American theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, a brilliant, enigmatic figure known as the father of the atomic bomb, a man consumed with ambition and haunted by his past. After opening alongside “Barbie” on July 21, “Oppenheimer” quickly became beloved by critics and fans alike, grossing just over $950 million at the worldwide box office.\n\nMurphy had collaborated with Nolan before, taking supporting roles in movies like “Batman Begins” and “Inception,” but his latest work for the director became a breakthrough moment, with Murphy winning praise for the intensity and emotional complexity he brought to the role. At the Golden Globes, he won best actor in a drama; he also was up for a Critic’s Choice Award (losing out to his fellow Oscar nominee Paul Giamatti); and he’s in the running for a Screen Actors Guild Award, punctuating what has been an exceptionally busy awards season for Murphy.\n\n“It’s been new enough for me, but I gotta say, I think I’m getting good at it,” he said, chuckling. He marveled about a recent ceremony where he was stuck in a line with Meryl Streep.\n\n“That may never happen to me again in my life, and it’s just a wonderful feeling,” he said.\n\nIn a phone interview, Murphy also discussed what fascinated him about Oppenheimer the man, how he prepared for the role and the cast’s group chat. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.\n\nWere you watching the Oscars announcement?\n\nNo, I was at home in Cork with my mom and dad and my wife. And my phone started popping, so I figured it was good news. Everybody started texting. You know, you can’t really avoid good news or bad news, but it’s better when it’s good news.\n\nOppenheimer is a different role than what you’ve done in the past. What drew you to this character?\n\nWell, he is, in Chris’s words, the most important man that ever lived. He changed the course of the 20th century, and we are all living in Oppenheimer’s world. He was complex and contradictory and flawed and vain and arrogant, but he was still immensely charismatic and fascinating. It was a huge responsibility. But the sorts of roles I enjoy are the ones where you think, I have no idea how I’m going to play this.\n\nWhat steps did you take to prepare?\n\nOh man, I had six months. From the moment Chris called me, I just started working — from the inside out and from the outside in. I did an awful lot of reading and research and watched every single archival footage about him. Then I immediately started conditioning my body because he was very interesting how he carried himself physically and how slight his frame was. But a lot of it was just walking around my basement in Dublin talking to myself and practicing, practicing and practicing.\n\nAs you did that research, was there anything surprising to you about Oppenheimer?\n\nHe was an absolute contradiction in so many ways. He could have been an artist or a writer or a poet. But he was also this freakishly bright human being. A lot of his contemporaries would say he was the brightest man in the room at all times. But he was also very temperamental and fragile emotionally and mentally, particularly in his youth. If you were writing a fictional character, it wouldn’t add up to a character people could identify with. But in fact, he was just like the rest of us. He was just a human being. So that’s what I really identified with — his humanity.\n\nWhat was it like for you to work with such an all-star cast?\n\nA total gift. Every single cast member was fearless in the film, like they had done so much research and could improvise on the spot about their character and the real-life events. I felt really held and carried by everybody on the movie. We’re still all really close. There was a really good bond on this film, and it remains very very strong.\n\nIs it true there’s an “Oppenhomies” group chat?\n\nThat is true, yes. Olivia Thirlby came up with that moniker.\n\nYou and Nolan have a long history of working together. How did that impact your work with this film?\n\nOh, it’s crucial for me. I don’t think I could have made this film with anyone else, without that level of trust that goes back six movies and 20 years. He really, really pushed me and I wanted to be pushed. He expects excellence from you because that’s what he delivers himself every single day.\n\nIs there something distinctive about a Nolan set or film that’s different from other projects you’ve been involved in?\n\nI think it’s the level of focus. It’s quite remarkable. It’s laserlike, the way he uses time, because time, I’ve realized, is your most valuable commodity when you’re on a film set. So much of it gets wasted. When you come on a Chris Nolan set, you come on to work. There’s no phones, there’s no chatting. There’s no video footage, there’s no monitors. That’s not to say it’s not a pleasant environment. It’s a private, focused environment. That’s how you get the best out of people.\n\nIn terms of time, you didn’t have much of that at all right?\n\nNo, we filmed in 57 days, and three of them were a preshoot. So it was insane, the pace of it, but it never felt rushed. We never left a scene behind.\n\nSome people have criticized the film for the inclusion of nude scenes. What do you make of that critique?\n\nWell, I think those things are essential for the story. If you’re familiar with the story, it was his relationship with Jean Tatlock which was the thing that really made him lose his security clearance and ultimately kind of cost his career. I think it was vital to highlight the intimacy and closeness of their relationship.\n\nBesides the Academy Awards ceremony, what else is in the future for you?\n\nI have a film called “Small Things Like These,” which I produced and acted in and that’s opening at the Berlin Film Festival in February. I’m really proud of the movie. It’s produced by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. They paid for it and we produced it together. So I’m juggling that and attending all these events at the same time.\n\nA correction was made on\n\nMarch 20, 2024\n\n:\n\nAn earlier version of this article misstated Cillian Murphy’s age. He is 47, not 48.\n\nHow we handle corrections\n\nWith her billion-dollar blockbuster, “Barbie,” Greta Gerwig set a Hollywood record for the highest-grossing movie ever directed by a woman. Still, even that major milestone wasn’t enough to earn her a spot in the Oscars’ best director lineup: Though “Barbie” managed eight nominations, including best picture, Gerwig was snubbed by the directors branch that nominated her six years ago for “Lady Bird.” It was a mixed showing overall for the hit comedy, which missed some other hoped-for nominations for cinematography, editing and best actress for Margot Robbie. But it did at least pull off a dark-horse supporting actress nod for America Ferrera alongside an expected supporting-actor nomination for Ryan Gosling.\n\nAn otherwise strong showing for female filmmakers.\n\nFor the first time in Oscar history, three of the best-picture nominees were directed by women: “Barbie,” Celine Song’s “Past Lives” and Justine Triet’s “Anatomy of a Fall.” Still, that landmark moment could have been lost in the furor if the directors branch had put forth a lineup made up entirely of men, as many pundits feared it might. Though Gerwig and Song were both snubbed for best director, at least the category found room for Triet, who’d previously won the prestigious Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival for her twisty legal drama.\n\nYoung male actors still can’t break through.\n\nThe academy has never had a problem nominating young actresses: In fact, seven of the 10 actresses recognized this year are 40 or under. That same interest in ingénues does not apply to the male categories, however. Despite worthy contenders in the mix like Charles Melton (“May December”) and Dominic Sessa (“The Holdovers”), all 10 of the actors nominated were over 40, further proof that the Oscars prefer their men more grizzled if they’re meant to be taken seriously.\n\nNobody pulled a Riseborough.\n\nLast year, the actress Andrea Riseborough employed a new kind of Oscar bid: Instead of waging a costly, monthslong awards campaign for her performance in the microbudget indie “To Leslie,” her team waited until the weeklong Oscar-voting window opened, then leveraged a group of famous friends that included Edward Norton, Gwyneth Paltrow and Sarah Paulson to tout the movie en masse on social media. It worked, earning Riseborough a surprise best actress nomination, and though she sought to pay it forward last week by throwing her muscle behind Ava DuVernay’s underseen “Origin,” the film was snubbed by the academy, while all 20 acting slots went to performers who had campaigned the old-fashioned way.\n\nRomance was in the air.\n\nHey, was this Oscar-nomination morning or Valentine’s Day? At least six couples scored his-and-hers nominations today, including the “Oppenheimer” director Christopher Nolan and his producer wife, Emma Thomas; the “Anatomy of a Fall” director Justine Triet and her partner and co-writer, Arthur Harari; the “May December” co-writers Samy Burch and Alex Mechanik; and Jared and Jerusha Hess, the directors of the animated short “Ninety-Five Senses.” “Barbie” was responsible for the other two pairs of lovebirds, with Gerwig and her husband, Noah Baumbach, nominated in the adapted-screenplay category and Margot Robbie and her husband, Tom Ackerley, earning nominations as the film’s producers.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio gets snubbed\n\nAs the nominations were read, “Killers of the Flower Moon” waxed and waned: Martin Scorsese’s period drama earned key nods for picture, director, actress (Lily Gladstone) and supporting actor (Robert De Niro), but missed an expected nomination for adapted screenplay and extended a continuing snub of lead actor Leonardo DiCaprio that began with the Screen Actors Guild. Still, the film did make Oscar history in several categories, as Gladstone became the first Native American nominated for best actress and Scorsese’s 10th directing nomination helped him pull ahead of Steven Spielberg as the most-nominated living director of all time.\n\nWes Anderson in, Pedro Almodóvar out.\n\nMembers of the short-film branch can often be hostile to directors they perceive as dilettantes, doling out snubs in recent years to big names like Taylor Swift (for “All Too Well: The Short Film”) and Pedro Almodóvar (for his Tilda Swinton short “The Human Voice”) in favor of lesser-known filmmakers struggling to break through. This year, voters from other branches were allowed to volunteer their services to nominate films for best live-action short, and this expanded group allowed in Wes Anderson, whose miniature “The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar” bowed on Netflix in the fall. Almodóvar was not so lucky, snubbed once again for his western “Strange Way of Life,” starring Pedro Pascal and Ethan Hawke.\n\nA last dance for ‘Barbie.’\n\n“Barbie” might have scored one more nomination if it weren’t for a rule change introduced in 2008 that forbade any film from placing more than two nominees in the original-song category. Though three of the tunes from “Barbie” qualified for the original-song shortlist announced in December — Dua Lipa’s disco-infused “Dance the Night,” the Ryan Gosling-sung “I’m Just Ken” and Billie Eilish’s ballad “What Was I Made For?” — only the latter two made it in. At least Lipa can console herself with the tune’s recent Grammy nomination for song of the year.\n\nGodzilla stomps into visual effects\n\nThe visual-effects category is typically dominated by mega-budget Hollywood productions, but the hit Japanese import “Godzilla Minus One” made it into the race this year alongside big-studio fare like “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,” “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” and “Napoleon.” Not bad for a foreign-language film with a budget rumored to be under $15 million. When Godzilla roars, even the academy has to listen."
