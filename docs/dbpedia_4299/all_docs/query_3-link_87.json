He pitched Richard to his filmmaking class last winter. The story concerns a stolen tool kit that creates a bond between two adversaries.

The short will be followed by Q & A with the filmmakers. It will be shown at a members-only screening of the new 3D nature documentary,Amazon Adventure, but IMAX hasreserved 75 seats for the Ballard filmmakers and their entourage.\n\nThe project is the result of the IMAX “In Focus” program. In partnership with the United Nations Environment, IMAX consulted with the All American High School Film Festival to select five “exemplary” filmmaking programs from across the US to address the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals #13-15: Climate Action, Life Below Water, and Life on Land. Each participating program received a $5,000 grant. The goal was to encourage students interested in filmmaking to use their talents to develop films that promote change.\n\nOn the Backs of Salmon tells the encouraging story behind the largest dam removal in world history – the Elwha on the Olympic Peninsula. The students were inspired by this story because it shows the power of people to change things, and the power of nature to bounce back. It premiered online last spring during the UN’s World Environment Day.\n\nand was screened this fall at the All American High School Film Festival in New York City.\n\nFor more information, visit bhsvideo.blogspot.com and don’t miss the\n\nKing-5 news interview of “Ballard High School Students Create Documentary On the Backs of Salmon “.\n\nThree short films produced by students in the Ballard High School Digital Filmmaking Program are winners at Fresh Film Northwest.

This is the thirteenth year in a row that students from Ballard’s Digital Filmmaking Program have been among the winners.\n\nThe winning films include a documentary, an animation piece, and a short comedy.

Proceeds will benefit students in the Digital Filmmaking Program at Ballard High School.\n\nIf you live in Ballard, chances are you frequent the Majestic Bay Theatres. And if you’ve seen a film at the Bay, chances are you’ve seen A Trip to the Groovies, the policy trailer produced by students in the Ballard High School Digital Filmmaking Program.\n\nFor years, the Majestic Bay showed A Trip to the Movies to inform audiences of theater rules and etiquette. A mock instructional film set in what appears to be 1960, the trailer follows two children, Russ and Ellen, as they navigate the process of movie-going. When the Bay went digital in 2014, they needed a policy trailer in a digital format. Rather than purchasing a ready-made trailer, the Bay invited the Digital Filmmaking Program at BHS to produce one. The film students were thrilled! After considering various ideas, Ballard’s filmmakers decided to follow Russ and Ellen to the movies again – this time in 1977. The challenging concept required period vehicles, costumes, hair, make-up, and actors who might possibly be the original Russ and Ellen – seventeen years later.\n\nThe Majestic Bay was so pleased with the new trailer that they made an immediate donation and also pledged to host an annual fundraiser for the Digital Filmmaking Program. The screening of Coraline on October 28 is the third annualand will be preceded by A Trip to the Groovies . So future audiences will continue to appreciate the parody elements in the new trailer, the Bay also had the former trailer digitized to show from time to time. Ballard’s Digital Filmmaking Program provides state-of-the-art equipment and professional experiences for students and has a well-established record of preparing students for college and careers in media-related fields. It is funded largely by support from the Ballard community, thanks to partners such as The Majestic Bay.\n\nBallard Film Students Win National Award From Academy | October 2017\n\nWhen the envelopes were opened at Emerson College in Los Angeles on Oct. 3, the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (NATAS) announced Comeback , a dramatic short by Skala Leake, Aaron Miller, Cameron Miller\n\nAvery Davis, as winnier of a National Student Production Award for best Audio/Sound.

Ballard’s DFP was one of only five “exemplary” high school film programs across the nation chosen by IMAX and the All American High School Film Festival (AAHSFF) in New York City to produce environmental documentaries. “We identified programs that… consistently submitted quality work,” said Tom Oliva, AAHSFF Executive Director. IMAX awarded $5,000 to each program. “The In Focus program aligns seamlessly with what we strive toachieve” Oliva said, “cultivating young filmmakers and recognizing their talented work.”\n\nOn the Backs of Salmon tells the encouraging story behind the largest dam removal in world history – the Elwha on the Olympic Peninsula. The students were inspired by this story because it shows the power of people to change things, and the power of nature to bounce back. It premiered online last spring during the UN’s World Environment and was screened this fall at the All American High School Film Festival in New York City.\n\n“The release of these documentaries on World Environment Day is a fitting testament to the importance of empowering our youth to use their voices to drive change for a better tomorrow,” said UN Environment Chief Erik Solheim. “We support IMAX’s commitment to helping young filmmakers share these stories with a larger audience, hopefully resulting in changes that create a healthier environment.” Don’t miss the King-5 news interview of “Ballard High School Students Create Documentary“.\n\nBHS Filmmakers Win Big at the Emmy Awards | May/June 2017\n\nStudents in the Ballard High School Digital Filmmaking Program won five High School Awards of Excellence at the Northwest Emmy Awards on June 3.Best Long Form Non-Fiction film went to 9066 , a documentary about the internment of US citizens of Japanese ancestry during WWII by Maya Konz, Bailey Wall, Kajsa Woolford & Nolan Baker.Best Short Form Fiction film,best Writer, best Photographer/Editor andbest Audio/Sound went to Comeback by Skala Leake, Aaron Miller, Cameron Miller & Avery Davis.
