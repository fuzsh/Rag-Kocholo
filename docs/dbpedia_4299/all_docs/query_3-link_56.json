He devoted most of his attention to students learning to write - among them George V. Higgins and Ed Hannibal - or those who were troubled emotionally. Oddly, he never wrote for publication, for although devoted to the written word, he found creative writing, even the composing of a memo, to be devilishly difficult. \"He was so acutely aware of the weight of each word and the need to craft it,\" said a friend, Dr. David John Smith, \"that he was sometimes not able to sit down and write a letter.\"\n\nHe loved literature, conversation, political cartoons, Noel Coward and E.B. White. He enjoyed the funny pages, vacations at Boothbay Harbor, browsing in bookstores or antique shops, and puns, which he considered a clever use of the language. He was a swimmer, sailor and sports fan, with season tickets to BC football, basketball and hockey. He was partial to Rob Roys, backyard barbecues and Athens Olympia restaurant.\n\nIn clothing, he was traditional, and, at Symphony Hall or a Celtics game, favored suits. In the '60s, when neckties were thought of as politically hostile, Sandy resisted a temptation to win the favor of students by dressing down, and it was common, even in rebellious years, to see him in a three-piece suit in conversation with a campus radical in hippie dress. Sandy was not a man to blow with the wind, and students buffeted by confusion and contradiction saw him as an anchor, particularly during the social hurricanes of the '60s.\n\nHe was never on time, and students who saw him racing across campus would laugh in knowledge Sandy was late again. Alumni who invited him home learned it was imprudent to begin cooking until he arrived. He lived longer than doctors expected, not as long as his friends hoped. He was a man of deep faith, and from diagnosis until death in May, he went through the denial, anger, and finally an acceptance of death, although never resignation. Told there was no point in further treatment, that it was time to go home and die, he said he was prepared, but not in a hurry, and when it came, it would be OK, because he had lived a full life.\n\nNext September, students will have to find someone else to ease homesickness, interpret Yeats, explain Vivaldi, define gerunds and teach Midwesterners how to eat lobster. Someone else will have to straighten out resumes and applications for grad school, and students on drugs will have to look elsewhere for help, which is too bad, for Sandy Jenks would have made it easier."
