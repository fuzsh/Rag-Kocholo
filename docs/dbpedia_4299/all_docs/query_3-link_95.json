Tying in with the national “Find Your Park” campaign, the Agency created “Found Our Park” for the CCNS. Included were plein air days, exhibitions in Truro, Wellfleet and Orleans, and talks in Provincetown, Truro and Eastham. These endeavors are also supported by Friends of the Cape Cod National Seashore and Eastern National."
