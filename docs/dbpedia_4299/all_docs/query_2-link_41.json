        "text": "As one of the best known, awarded, and financially successful composers in US history, John Williams is as easy to recall as John Philip Sousa, Aaron Copland or Leonard Bernstein, illustrating why he is \"America's composer\" time and again. With a massive list of awards that includes over 52 Oscar nominations (five wins), twenty-odd Gold and Platinum Records, and a slew of Emmy (two wins), Golden Globe (three wins), Grammy (25 wins), National Board of Review (including a Career Achievement Award), Saturn (six wins), American Film Institute (including a Lifetime Achievement Award) and BAFTA (seven wins) citations, along with honorary doctorate degrees numbering in the teens, Williams is undoubtedly one of the most respected composers for Cinema. He's led countless national and international orchestras, most notably as the nineteenth conductor of the Boston Pops Orchestra from 1980-1993, helming three Pops tours of the US and Japan during his tenure. He currently serves as the Pop's Conductor Laureate. Also to his credit is a parallel career as an author of serious, and some not-so-serious, concert works - performed by the likes of Mstislav Rostropovich, André Previn, Itzhak Perlman, Yo-Yo Ma, Gil Shaham, Leonard Slatkin, James Ingram, Dale Clevenger, and Joshua Bell. Of particular interests are his Essay for Strings, a jazzy Prelude & Fugue, the multimedia presentation American Journey (aka The Unfinished Journey (1999)), a Sinfonietta for Winds, a song cycle featuring poems by Rita Dove, concerti for flute, violin, clarinet, trumpet, tuba, cello, bassoon and horn, fanfares for the 1984, 1988 and 1996 Summer Olympics, the 2002 Winter Olympics, and a song co-written with Alan Bergman and Marilyn Bergman for the Special Olympics! But such a list probably warrants a more detailed background...\n\nBorn in Flushing, New York on February 8, 1932, John Towner Williams discovered music almost immediately, due in no small measure to being the son of a percussionist for CBS Radio and the Raymond Scott Quintet. After moving to Los Angeles in 1948, the young pianist and leader of his own jazz band started experimenting with arranging tunes; at age 15, he determined he was going to become a concert pianist; at 19, he premiered his first original composition, a piano sonata.\n\nHe attended both UCLA and the Los Angeles City College, studying orchestration under MGM musical associate Robert Van Eps and being privately tutored by composer Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco, until conducting for the first time during three years with the U.S. Air Force. His return to the states brought him to Julliard, where renowned piano pedagogue Madame Rosina Lhevinne helped Williams hone his performance skills. He played in jazz clubs to pay his way; still, she encouraged him to focus on composing. So it was back to L.A., with the future maestro ready to break into the Hollywood scene.\n\nWilliams found work with the Hollywood studios as a piano player, eventually accompanying such fare such as the TV series Peter Gunn (1958), Süd Pazifik (1958), Manche mögen's heiß (1959), Das Appartement (1960), and Wer die Nachtigall stört (1962), as well as forming a surprising friendship with Bernard Herrmann. At age 24, \"Johnny Williams\" became a staff arranger at Columbia and then at 20th Century-Fox, orchestrating for Alfred Newman and Lionel Newman, Dimitri Tiomkin, Franz Waxman, and other Golden Age notables. In the field of popular music, he performed and arranged for the likes of Vic Damone, Doris Day, and Mahalia Jackson... all while courting actress/singer Barbara Ruick, who became his wife until her death in 1974. John & Barbara had three children; their daughter is now a doctor, and their two sons, Joseph Williams and Mark Towner Williams, are rock musicians.\n\nThe orchestrating gigs led to serious composing jobs for television, notably Alcoa Premiere (1961), Checkmate (1960), Gilligans Insel (1964), Verschollen zwischen fremden Welten (1965), Planet der Giganten (1968), and his Emmy-winning scores for Heidi kehrt heim (1968) and Das Geheimnis von Schloß Thornfield (1970). Daddy-O (1958) and Because They're Young (1960) brought his original music to the big theatres, but he was soon typecast doing comedies. His efforts in the genre helped guarantee his work on William Wyler's Wie klaut man eine Million? (1966), however, a major picture that immediately led to larger projects. Of course, his arrangements continued to garner attention, and he won his first Oscar for adapting Anatevka (1971).\n\nDuring the '70s, he was King of Disaster Scores with Die Höllenfahrt der Poseidon (1972), Erdbeben (1974) and Flammendes Inferno (1974). His psychological score for Spiegelbilder (1972) remains one of the most innovative works in soundtrack history. But his Americana - particularly Der Gauner (1969) - is what caught the ear of director Steven Spielberg, then preparing for his first feature, Sugarland Express (1974). When Spielberg reunited with Williams on Der weiße Hai (1975), they established themselves as a blockbuster team, the composer gained his first Academy Award for Original Score, and Spielberg promptly recommended Williams to a friend, George Lucas. In 1977, John Williams re-popularized the epic cinema sound of Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Franz Waxman and other composers from the Hollywood Golden Age: Star Wars: Episode IV - Eine neue Hoffnung (1977) became the best selling score-only soundtrack of all time, and spawned countless musical imitators. For the next five years, though the music in Hollywood changed, John Williams wrote big, brassy scores for big, brassy films - Teufelskreis Alpha (1978), Superman - Der Film (1978), 1941 - Wo bitte geht's nach Hollywood (1979), Jäger des verlorenen Schatzes (1981) ... An experiment during this period, Herzquietschen (1981), flopped. There was a long-term change of pace, nonetheless, as Williams fell in love with an interior designer and married once more.\n\nE.T. - Der Außerirdische (1982) brought about his third Oscar, and Menschen am Fluss (1984), Das Reich der Sonne (1987), Die Reisen des Mr. Leary (1988) and Geboren am 4. Juli (1989) added variety to the 1980s, as he returned to television with work on Unglaubliche Geschichten (1985) and themes for NBC, including NBC Nightly News (1970). The '80s also brought the only exceptions to the composer's collaboration with Steven Spielberg - others scored both Spielberg's segment of Unheimliche Schattenlichter (1983) and Die Farbe Lila (1985).\n\nIntending to retire, the composer's output became sporadic during the 1990s, particularly after the exciting Jurassic Park (1993) and the masterful, Oscar-winning Schindlers Liste (1993). This lighter workload, coupled with a number of hilarious references on Die Simpsons (1989) actually seemed to renew interest in his music. Two Home Alone films (1990, 1992), JFK: Tatort Dallas (1991), Nixon - Der Untergang eines Präsidenten (1995), Sleepers (1996), Sieben Jahre in Tibet (1997), Der Soldat James Ryan (1998), Die Asche meiner Mutter (1999), and a return to familiar territory with Star Wars: Episode I - Die dunkle Bedrohung (1999) recalled his creative diversity of the '70s.\n\nIn this millennium, the artist shows no interest in slowing down. His relationships with Spielberg and Lucas continue in A.I.: Künstliche Intelligenz (2001), the remaining Star Wars prequels (2002, 2005), Minority Report (2002), Catch Me If You Can (2002), and a promised fourth Indiana Jones film. There is a more focused effort on concert works, as well, including a theme for the new Walt Disney Concert Hall and a rumored light opera. But one certain highlight is his musical magic for the world of Harry Potter (2001, 2002, 2004, etc.), which he also arranged into a concert suite geared toward teaching children about the symphony orchestra. His music remains on the whistling lips of people around the globe, in the concert halls, on the promenades, in album collections, sports arenas, and parades, and, this writer hopes, touching some place in ourselves. So keep those ears ready wherever you go, 'cause you will likely hear a bit of John Williams on your way.\n\nComposer and conductor Alexandre Desplat, Oscar winner and seven-time Academy Award nominated, for his prolific filmography and his collaborations with Stephen Frears, Terrence Malick, Ang Lee, Kathryn Bigelow, Jacques Audiard, Wes Anderson, Roman Polanski, George Clooney or Matteo Garrone is one of the most worthy heirs of the French masters of film music.\n\nBrought up in a cultural and musical mix thanks to his Greek mother and his French father who studied and got married in California, he grew up listening to French symphonists, Ravel or Debussy , world music and jazz.\n\nHe studied piano and trumpet before choosing the flute as the main instrument. As a free auditor in Claude Ballif's analysis class at the CNSM, he enriches his classical musical education by studying Brazilian and African music. He will record later with Carlinhos Brown or Ray Lema.\n\nPassionate about film music, it's as much his musical sensitivity as his intimate approach to cinematographic language that will allow his privileged relationship with filmmakers. Inspired by the scores of Maurice Jarre, Bernard Herrmann, Nino Rota or Georges Delerue, it is after hearing the score of John Williams for Star Wars: Episode IV - Eine neue Hoffnung (1977) that he decides to compose exclusively for the big screen.\n\nDuring the recording of his first feature film he meets violinist Dominique Lemonnier. This is the beginning of an exceptional artistic exchange as she becomes her favorite soloist, artistic director and wife. With his strong sense of interpretation, his creative spirit and his singular violin playing, Solré inspired Alexandre's compositions, influencing his music in depth, initiating a new way of writing for the strings in the cinema.\n\nCollaborator of Jacques Audiard since his first film, he creates for his works strong and singular compositions and he won in 2005 for Der wilde Schlag meines Herzens (2005) the Silver Bear of the Berlinale, and his first Caesar. He works in France with Philippe de Broca and Francis Girod but Das Mädchen mit dem Perlenohrring (2003) of Peter Webber, his 50th score for the film, he gets a first Golden Globe nomination and BAFTA and began his rise in Hollywood. Leading American career and European collaborations and remaining faithful to his directors, he composes among others Syriana (2005)'s scores of Stephen Gaghan, Birth (2004) of Jonathan Glazer, Coco Chanel: Der Beginn einer Leidenschaft (2009) by Anne Fontaine, L'armée du crime (2009) by Robert Guédiguian, Largo Winch (2008) by Jérôme Salle, Der Feind in den eigenen Reihen - Intimate Enemies (2007) or Hostage - Entführt (2005) by Florent-Emilio Siri.\n\nPrizes and collaborations with the greatest directors follow one another. In 2007, he received his first Oscar nomination for Stephen Frears's Die Queen (2006) and won his first European Film Award. The same year, he won the Golden Globe, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award, and the World Soundtrack Award for John Curran's score Der bunte Schleier (2006), performed by pianist Láng Lang. He composed in 2008 for Gefahr und Begierde (2007) by Ang Lee and Der seltsame Fall des Benjamin Button (2008) by David Fincher which will earn him a second Oscar nomination and a fourth Golden Globes and BAFTA nomination.\n\nWith his score for Der Ghostwriter (2010) by Roman Polanski, he won in 2010 a second César and a second European Film Award. The same year he wrote the music of New Moon - Biss zur Mittagsstunde (2009) by Chris Weitz, whose album was a platinum record, and Tom Hooper's The King's Speech - Die Rede des Königs (2010) for which he won the BAFTA, the Grammy Award, and was nominated for the fourth time at the Oscars and for the fifth time at the Golden Globes.\n\nIn 2010-2011 he wrote the music of Harry Potter und die Heiligtümer des Todes - Teil 1 (2010) and Harry Potter und die Heiligtümer des Todes - Teil 2 (2011) which became the third greatest success of all time. He composed in 2011 nine partitions, The Tree of Life (2011) of Terrence Malick, Der Gott des Gemetzels (2011) by Roman Polanski, Der fantastische Mr. Fox (2009) by George Clooney , which earned him another Oscar nomination, La fille du puisatier (2011) by Daniel Auteuil and The Ides of March - Tage des Verrats (2011) by George Clooney.\n\nIn 2012 he worked with Kathryn Bigelow for Zero Dark Thirty (2012), Matteo Garrone for Reality (2012), Gilles Bourdos for Renoir (2012), Jérôme Salle for Zulu - Blutiges Erbe (2013), George Clooney for Moonrise Kingdom (2012) and Jacques Audiard for Der Geschmack von Rost und Knochen (2012) for which he won a third Cesar. For his score of Argo (2012) of Ben Affleck, Oscar for Best Picture, it is named for the sixth time BAFTA, and for the fifth time at the Golden Globes and the Oscars.\n\nHe signed in 2013 the partition Monuments Men: Ungewöhnliche Helden (2014) from George Clooney, Venus im Pelz (2013) of Roman Polanski, and was appointed to the BAFTAs and the Oscars for Philomena: Eine Mutter sucht ihren Sohn (2013) of Stephen Frears.\n\nIn 2014 he composed the music Godzilla (2014) of Gareth Edwards, and receives exceptional fact, two Oscar nominations for The Imitation Game - Ein streng geheimes Leben (2014) of Morten Tyldum and Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) by George Clooney, for which he won a BAFTA, Grammy and Oscar.\n\nMember of the jury of the Cannes Film Festival in 2012, he became in 2014 the first composer President of the jury of the Venice Film Festival. Crowning long years of collaboration, he directed the London Symphony Orchestra in December 2014 for a concert of his works at the Barbican Theater in London.\n\nIn 2018, Alexandre Desplat received a second Oscar, a Golden Globe and a BAFTA for Shape of Water: Das Flüstern des Wassers (2017) of Guillermo del Toro.\n\nGerman-born composer Hans Zimmer is recognized as one of Hollywood's most innovative musical talents. He featured in the music video for The Buggles' single \"Video Killed the Radio Star\", which became a worldwide hit and helped usher in a new era of global entertainment as the first music video to be aired on MTV (August 1, 1981).\n\nHans Florian Zimmer was born in Frankfurt am Main, then in West Germany, the son of Brigitte (Weil) and Hans Joachim Zimmer. He entered the world of film music in London during a long collaboration with famed composer and mentor Stanley Myers, which included the film Mein wunderbarer Waschsalon (1985). He soon began work on several successful solo projects, including the critically acclaimed A World Apart, and during these years Zimmer pioneered the use of combining old and new musical technologies. Today, this work has earned him the reputation of being the father of integrating the electronic musical world with traditional orchestral arrangements.\n\nA turning point in Zimmer's career came in 1988 when he was asked to score Rain Man for director Barry Levinson. The film went on to win the Oscar for Best Picture of the Year and earned Zimmer his first Academy Award Nomination for Best Original Score. The next year, Zimmer composed the score for another Best Picture Oscar recipient, Miss Daisy und ihr Chauffeur (1989), starring Jessica Tandy, and Morgan Freeman.\n\nHaving already scored two Best Picture winners, in the early 1990s, Zimmer cemented his position as a preeminent talent with the award-winning score for Der König der Löwen (1994). The soundtrack has sold over 15 million copies to date and earned him an Academy Award for Best Original Score, a Golden Globe, an American Music Award, a Tony, and two Grammy Awards. In total, Zimmer's work has been nominated for 7 Golden Globes, 7 Grammys and seven Oscars for Rain Man (1988), Gladiator (2000), Der König der Löwen (1994), Besser geht's nicht (1997), The Rendezvous mit einem Engel (1996), Der schmale Grat (1998), Der Prinz von Ägypten (1998), and Last Samurai (2003).\n\nWith his career in full swing, Zimmer was anxious to replicate the mentoring experience he had benefited from under Stanley Myers' guidance. With state-of-the-art technology and a supportive creative environment, Zimmer was able to offer film-scoring opportunities to young composers at his Santa Monica-based musical \"think tank.\" This approach helped launch the careers of such notable composers as Mark Mancina, John Powell, Harry Gregson-Williams, Nick Glennie-Smith, and Klaus Badelt.\n\nIn 2000, Zimmer scored the music for Gladiator (2000), for which he received an Oscar nomination, in addition to Golden Globe and Broadcast Film Critics Awards for his epic score. It sold more than three million copies worldwide and spawned a second album Gladiator: More Music From The Motion Picture, released on the Universal Classics/Decca label. Zimmer's other scores that year included Mission: Impossible II (2000), Der Weg nach El Dorado (2000), and Mit oder ohne - Was Männer haben sollten (2000), directed by Barry Levinson.\n\nSome of his other impressive scores include Pearl Harbor (2001), Ring (2002), four films directed by Ridley Scott; Tricks (2003), Hannibal (2001), Black Hawk Down (2001), and Thelma & Louise (1991), Penny Marshall's Unterwegs mit Jungs (2001), and Eine Klasse für sich (1992), Tony Scott's True Romance (1993), Tränen der Sonne (2003), Ron Howard's Backdraft - Männer, die durchs Feuer gehen (1991), Tage des Donners (1990), Fräulein Smillas Gespür für Schnee (1997), and the animated Spirit - Der wilde Mustang (2002) for which he also co-wrote four of the songs with Bryan Adams, including the Golden Globe nominated Here I Am.\n\nAt the 27th annual Flanders International Film Festival, Zimmer performed live for the first time in concert with a 100-piece orchestra and a 100-voice choir. Choosing selections from his impressive body of work, Zimmer performed newly orchestrated concert versions of Gladiator, Mission: Impossible II (2000), Rain Man (1988), Der König der Löwen (1994), and Der schmale Grat (1998). The concert was recorded by Decca and released as a concert album entitled \"The Wings Of A Film: The Music Of Hans Zimmer.\"\n\nIn 2003, Zimmer completed his 100th film score for the film The Last Samurai, starring Tom Cruise, for which he received both a Golden Globe and a Broadcast Film Critics nomination. Zimmer then scored Nancy Meyers' comedy Was das Herz begehrt (2003), the animated Dreamworks film, Große Haie - Kleine Fische (2004) (featuring voices of Will Smith, Renée Zellweger, Robert De Niro, Jack Black, and Martin Scorsese), and Jim Brooks' Spanglish (2004) starring Adam Sandler and Téa Leoni (for which he also received a Golden Globe nomination). His 2005 projects include Paramount's The Weather Man (2005) starring Nicolas Cage, Dreamworks' Madagascar (2005), and the Warner Bros. summer release, Batman Begins (2005).\n\nZimmer's additional honors and awards include the prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award in Film Composition from the National Board of Review, and the Frederick Loewe Award in 2003 at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. He has also received ASCAP's Henry Mancini Award for Lifetime Achievement. Hans and his wife live in Los Angeles and he is the father of four children.\n\nBorn in Baltimore, Maryland, Glass worked in his father's radio store and discovered music listening to the offbeat Western classical records customers didn't seem to want. He studied the violin and flute, and obtained early admission to the University of Chicago. After graduating in mathematics and philosophy, he went to New York's Juilliard school, drove a cab, and studied composition with Darius Milhaud and others.\n\nAt 23, he moved to Paris to study under the legendary Nadia Boulanger, who taught almost all of the major Western classical composers of the 20th century. While there, he discovered Indian classical music while transcribing the works of Ravi Shankar into Western musical notation for a French filmmaker. A creative turning point, Glass researched non-Western music in India and parts of Africa, and applied the techniques to his own composition.\n\nBack in the United States, Glass spent the late 1960s and early 1970s driving a taxi cab in New York and creating a major collection of new music. In 1976, his landmark opera \"Einstein on the Beach\" was staged by Robert Wilson to a baffling variety of reviews. His compositions were so avant-garde that he had to form the Philip Glass Ensemble to give them a venue for performance. Although called a minimalist by the Western classical mainstream, he denies this categorization. His major works include opera, theater pieces, dance, and song.\n\nHis work in film, beginning with Koyaanisqatsi - Prophezeiung (1982), gave filmmakers such as Godfrey Reggio and Errol Morris a new venue of expression through the documentary form. His many recordings have also widened his audience. He was commissioned by the Metropolitan Opera to compose \"The Voyage\" for the Columbus quinquacentennial in 1992. In 1996, he composed original music for the Atlanta Olympic Games, which, perhaps, made Glass almost mainstream. Glass remains one of the most important American composers. His music is distinctive, haunting, and evocative. Either performed by itself or in collaboration with other media, his compositions move the listener to unexplored places. More recently, a major reexamination of Glass's oeuvre has led him to be labeled the Last Romantic by the musical press.\n\nBorn on February 10, 1929, Jerry Goldsmith studied piano with Jakob Gimpel and composition, theory, and counterpoint with Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco. He also attended classes in film composition given by Miklós Rózsa at the Univeristy of Southern California. In 1950, he was employed as a clerk typist in the music department at CBS. There, he was given his first embryonic assignments as a composer for radio shows such as \"Romance\" and \"CBS Radio Workshop\". He wrote one score a week for these shows, which were performed live on transmission. He stayed with CBS until 1960, having already scored Unwahrscheinliche Geschichten (1959). He was hired by Revue Studios to score their series Thriller (1960). It was here that he met the influential film composer Alfred Newman who hired Goldsmith to score the film Einsam sind die Tapferen (1962), his first major feature film score. An experimentalist, Goldsmith constantly pushed forward the bounds of film music: Planet der Affen (1968) included horns blown without mouthpieces and a bass clarinetist fingering the notes but not blowing. He was unafraid to use the wide variety of electronic sounds and instruments which had become available, although he did not use them for their own sake.\n\nHe rose rapidly to the top of his profession in the early to mid-1960s, with scores such as Freud (1962), Träumende Lippen (1965) and Kanonenboot am Yangtse-Kiang (1966). In fact, he received Oscar nominations for all three and another in the 1960s for Planet der Affen (1968). From then onwards, his career and reputation was secure and he scored an astonishing variety of films during the next 30 years or so, from Patton: Rebell in Uniform (1970) to Star Trek - Der Film (1979) and from Chinatown (1974) to The Boys from Brazil - Geheimakte Viertes Reich (1978). He received 17 Oscar nominations but won only once, for Das Omen (1976) in 1977 (Goldsmith himself dismissed the thought of even getting a nomination for work on a \"horror show\"). He enjoyed giving concerts of his music and performed all over the world, notably in London, where he built up a strong relationship with London Symphony Orchestra.\n\nJerry Goldsmith died at age 75 on July 21, 2004 after a long battle with cancer.\n\nIn his 25 year career, David Newman has scored over 100 films, ranging from War of the Roses, Matilda, Bowfinger and Heathers, to the more recent The Spirit, Serenity, and Alvin and the Chipmonks: The Squeakuel. Newman's music has brought to life the critically acclaimed dramas Brokedown Palace and Hoffa; top-grossing comedies Norbit, Scooby-Doo, Galaxy Quest, The Nutty Professor, The Flinstones, Throw Mama From the Train; and award-winning animated films Ice Age, The Brave Little Toaster and Anastasia. The recipient of top honors from the music and motion picture industries, he holds an Academy Award nomination for his score to the animated feature, Anastasia, and was the first composer to have his piece, 1001 Nights, performed in the Los Angeles Philharmonic's FILMHARMONIC Series, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.\n\nNewman is also a highly sought-after conductor and appears with leading orchestras throughout the world, including the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Berlin Score Orchestra, National Orchestra of Belgium, New Japan Philharmonic, Utah Symphony, and the American Symphony. He has led subscription week with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at Walt Disney Concert Hall and regularly conducts the Hollywood Bowl.\n\nAlso an active composer for the concert hall, his works have been performed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Indianapolis Symphony, Long Beach Symphony, and at the Ravinia Festival, Spoleto Festival USA, and Chicago's Grant Park Music Festival.\n\nNewman has spent considerable time unearthing and restoring film music classics for the concert hall, and headed the Sundance Institute's music preservation program in the late 1980s. During his tenure at Sundance he wrote an original score and conducted the Utah Symphony for the classic silent motion picture, Sunrise, which opened the Sundance Film Festival in 1989. As a tribute to his work in film music preservation, he was elected President of the Film Music Society in 2007, a nonprofit organization formed by entertainment industry professionals to preserve and restore motion picture and television music. Passionate about nurturing the next generation of musicians, Newman services as President of the Board of the American Youth Symphony, a forty-three year-old pre-professional orchestra based in Los Angeles, where he launched the three-year \"Jerry Goldsmith Project.\" In 2007 he wrote the children't melodrama Yoko and the Tooth Fairy for Crossroads School in Santa Monica, CA, and in 2010 he served on the faculty of the Aspen Music Festival in the Film Scoring Program. When his schedule permits, he visit Los Angeles area high schools to speak about film scoring and mentor young composers.\n\nThe son of nine-time Oscar-winning composer, Alfred Newman, David Newman was born in Los Angeles in 1954. He trained in violin and piano from an early age and earned degrees in orchestral conducting and violin from the University of Southern California.\n\nThree-time Academy Award-nominated composer and pianist Nicholas Britell is known for his critically acclaimed scores on feature films with Academy Award winning writer-directors Barry Jenkins and Adam McKay.

Britell won an Emmy for Outstanding Original Main Title Theme as well as the 2018 Hollywood Music in Media Award for Best Original Score (TV Show/Limited Series) for Succession Season 1. Britell's score and main title theme have become some of the most talked about music for television on social media, with audience demand leading Britell to produce a remix of the main title theme with lyrics from legendary hip-hop artist Pusha-T (their remix ''Puppets\" was released in October 2019 by Def Jam Recordings).\n\nBritell's upcoming projects include writing the score for Amazon's Underground Railroad series, directed and adapted by Barry Jenkins from Colson Whitehead's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel.

His father was notable film score composer Alfred Newman (1900-1970). The Newman family is of Russian-Jewish descent, and includes several other well-known musicians. Thomas' mother Martha Louis Montgomery (1920-2005) wanted her sons to have a musical education. Thomas attended regular lessons in violin as a child. An older Thomas received his musical education while attending the University of Southern California and Yale University. Thomas Newman graduated as Bachelor of Arts in 1977, and a Master of Music in 1978.\n\nThomas originally composed music for theatrical productions in Broadway, working with his mentor Stephen Sondheim. His uncle Lionel Newman asked him to compose music for the television series \"The Paper Chase\" (1978-1979, 1986), which was Thomas' first credit in a television production.\n\nIn the 1980s, Thomas first worked in film. Composer John Williams, a close family friend, hired Thomas to work in the music department for space opera film \"Return of the Jedi\" (1983). Thomas' main work in the film was orchestrating the music in a scene where character Darth Vader dies. Afterwards, Thomas was approached by film producer Scott Rudin and hired to work as a film score composer in his own right. His first work in the field was the film score of romantic drama \"Reckless\" (1984).\n\nWhile he worked regularly as a film score composer during the 1980s, Thomas reportedly felt he had to retrain himself for a hard and demanding job. It reportedly took him 8 years to not feel fraudulent in his efforts. In 1994, Thomas received his first Academy Award nominations, for the film scores of \"The Shawshank Redemption\" (1994) and \"Little Women\" (1994). He lost the Award to rival composer Hans Zimmer, who had been nominated for the film score of the animated film \"The Lion King\" (1994).\n\nNewman was an established and increasingly famous composer in the 1990s. He received further Academy Award nominations, although he never actually won. Among his more notable works was the film score of the drama film \"American Beauty\" (1999), which earned Thomas both a Grammy and a BAFTA award. Newman had a good working relationship with the film's director Sam Mendes. Mendes has kept hiring Thomas as the composer for most of his films. The main exception being the comedy-drama film \"Away We Go\" (2009), which did not have a film score.\n\nIn the 2000s, Thomas continued working in high-profile films, such as \"Road to Perdition\" (2002), \"Finding Nemo\" (2003), and \"Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events\". By 2006, he had been nominated eight times for an Academy Award, while never winning it. He started joking about his lack of victories in public.\n\nIn 2008, Thomas was nominated for two Academy Awards, for both the film score and an original song for the animated film \"WALL-E\" (2008). He won neither, though the hit song \"Down to Earth\" earned him a Grammy Award. He continues to work regularly in the 2010s. Among his more acclaimed works were the film scores for spy film \"Skyfall\" (2012) and period drama \"Saving Mr. Banks\" (2013). He has continued being nominated for Academy Awards. As of 2020, he has been nominated 15 times for the Academy Award. He is the most nominated living composer to have never actually won an Academy Award, tied with Alex North. He has won a total of 5 Grammy awards."
