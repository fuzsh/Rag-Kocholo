The family runs a maple sugaring operation and an excavating business as well, so bulk materials, trucking and planting are offered and the market for additional local products is being considered. Headed up by January Stearns, along with her daughters Carrie Stearns Rainville and Katelyn, husband Sean and son Joshua, the seasonal greenhouse business is revitalizing the family farm through diversification.\n\nA Cornwall, VT native, January has long had a strong commitment to community service and her enthusiasm for gardening is infectious. Having an interest in horticulture since high school, she took classes at the Hannaford Career Center and went on to work for landscaping, retail greenhouse/garden center and florist portions of the industry in Addison County. After raising a family and establishing herself as a successful real estate agent, while running the family excavating business with her husband, she finally returned to the irresistible pull of her love for flowers and plants. January, Carrie and Katelyn particularly enjoy offering a wide variety of annuals, often in limited quantities, to engage customers in the excitement of discovering new plants. Often these are old favorites that have fallen out of fashion but are none the less fabulous, such as annual vinca. Peet Farm Greenhouses has a warm, welcoming atmosphere where customers will find family participation from four generations at any given time during the busy season. In addition to meeting a demand for local jobs and keeping the rural landscape alive, Peet Farm Greenhouses is deeply rooted in Vermont with the family dating back nine generations.
