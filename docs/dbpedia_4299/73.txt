The Academy Awards, also known as the Oscars, are one of the most prestigious and well-known awards you can receive in film.

Audiences love memorable acting, cinematography, and iconic scenes. However, the film music can also make a powerful impact by setting the tone, creating emotion, and enhancing the overall feeling of the movie.

Today, film music continues to have a profound influence on American culture, providing an emotional backdrop to some of the most iconic moments in our nation’s history. That’s why the Academy has featured a “Best Original Score” category since 1935 (the 7th Academy Awards)!

Something else I’ve noticed is that the Oscars are also a very popular trivia topic. I can’t tell you how many times a question about “the Academy Award for Best Original Score” has come up, and suddenly all eyes are on me, ‘the guitarist friend’, as if I’m supposed to have all the answers.

I actually blew it the other night at my favorite bar when a question came up asking “What was the first Disney film to win Best Original Score?”.

“Well, Jonathan?” my girlfriend Becca asked.

“It’s gotta be Dumbo!” I exclaimed with confidence, not giving much of an afterthought.

You can imagine my embarrassment when the correct answer was announced through the crackling bar speaker: “The correct answer is Pinocchio”. 😳

My friends were nice about it, but I could feel the disappointment looming around the table. I thought to myself, “that’s it, I need to create my own resource that has ALL of the Academy Awards for Best Original Score”.

And that’s exactly what you’ll find in this article: a massive collection of every film that’s won the Best Original Score Oscar since 1934.

So if you’re the resident musician in your friend group, please make sure to give this article a glance before you head out to your next trivia event. Who knows? It just might save your team, and earn you a few free drinks in the process!

Chart of Academy Award for Best Original Score Winners

Ever since the 72nd Academy Award ceremony in the year 2000, there’s just been one winner for best “Original Score”. However, the category and award title has gone through many changes over time, and it wasn’t always this simple.

For instance, there are many years where one film won the award for “Scoring of a Musical Picture”, and another film won the award for “Music Score of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture”. Today, we consider both films winners in the category of best “Original Score”.

That said, you’ll see multiple “winners” for the same year in the chart below.

Also, note that the year in the left column is the year the film was released, not the year it won the award. For example, the 1934 film One Night of Love won the Oscar in the subsequent year 1935.

Lastly, please note that the release date below is for a film’s U.S. release date. For example, Life is Beautiful was released in Europe in 1997. However, it wasn’t released in the U.S. until 1998.

You can click on any of the film names below to jump to a description of the film score, including a link to download the soundtrack on Amazon Music, or in some cases, stream it on YouTube.
