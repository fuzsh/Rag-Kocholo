Our History

The IWIN Foundation was founded as a 501(c)(3) organization in 2000 with a vision “to be an innovative organization built on passion, dedication and integrity, where communities feel called to support our mission and to grow and be recognized as the ‘neighbor next door’ to all women and men enduring treatment for breast cancer.”

The basis of the IWIN Program is to give these courageous individuals the strength to endure treatment, empower them to continue their fight against breast cancer, and place them on the path to survivorship.

Having assisted 3 women in our first year and 20 men since our inception, IWIN has served over 8,200 women and men.
