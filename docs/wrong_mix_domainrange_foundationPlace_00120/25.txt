iWin develops a photovoltaic venetian-blind shading device. The window can produce renewable energy while also shading sunlight, making it an ideal solution for highly glazed buildings. The company is currently participating in two Horizon Europe projects: INPERSO (INdustrialised and PErsonalised Renovation for Sustainable SOcieties) and MC2.0 (Mass Customization 2.0 for Integrated Photovoltaics), which involve numerous academic partners, researchers, and companies and have a combined budget of nearly 20 million euros.

“Such projects allow us to address specific phases of our product development roadmap while contributing to the overall goals of the call”, explains Ruben. For instance, through its involvement in INPERSO, iWin will provide its ground-breaking window technology to three different use cases in Greece, the Netherlands, and Spain. By participating in such diverse implementation areas, iWin can receive valuable feedback on its product development.

Projects such as INPERSO and MC2.0 are helping iWin consolidate its manufacturing processes to create a minimum viable product for early customer adoption. The challenge that the startup is currently facing concerns system validation, including initial production batches.

CEO Rubén Roldán Molinero notes that “Joining these consortiums poses considerable challenges in terms of planning and coordination, as these are very competitive projects in which the quality of the proposal and the expertise of the partners involved are key for a successful project evaluation.” However, iWin's longstanding partnership with SUPSI, especially with the Institute of Applied Sustainability to the Built Environment from which the startup originated, helped the company gain access to these prestigious initiatives.
