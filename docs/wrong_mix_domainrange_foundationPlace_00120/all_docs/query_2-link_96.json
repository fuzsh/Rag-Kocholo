        "text": "iWIN – the Insurance Women’s Inclusivity Network – celebrated its 10th Anniversary in style on Tuesday evening at The Old Bailey.\n\n200 guests joined Master Claire Burrell, Past Master and Sheriff Alderman Bronek Masojada and Sheriff Alderwoman Dame Sue Langley in the historic setting of the Central Criminal Court to toast the many achievements of iWIN over the last decade and the important part it has played in promoting the role of women in the insurance market, as well as being an influential advocate of inclusion.\n\nMaster Claire Burrell welcomed everyone and thanked Past Master Masojada for taking the initiative to establish iWIN during his year as Master of the Company. She said the impact of iWIN has been enormous:\n\n“I want to share a few stats that will help you understand our journey and why we are here tonight to celebrate. When the WCI formed iWIN back 2014 we had about 15 women members and just two women on the Court. Today we have 123 women members and six associate members with 45% – almost half – our Court being women.\n\n“While there is always more to do, I am thankful for the foresight of my predecessors to drive inclusion. As you know we continue to work hard to have a livery that is diverse, equitable and inclusive. I want to believe that we aren’t just saying that but demonstrating it.”\n\nShe introduced the guest speaker, Her Honour Judge Anuja Dhir KC, who picked up the Master’s theme for the year – Accessibility and Life-long Learning – as she told her remarkable journey from an immigrant Asian family in Dundee to becoming an Old Bailey judge. She spoke passionately about the many obstacles she had to overcome, how she often felt out of place and the importance of supporters, advocates and mentors. For her, many of them had been men who saw her as an individual with ability and potential and opened doors for her.\n\nShe said that the world has changed so much in her lifetime – from a childhood when discrimination was not only commonplace but legal – so that today the majority of permanent judges at The Old Bailey are women.\n\nSheriff Masojada spoke about how he and a group of others due to become Master over a decade ago knew that the WCI had to change and that reaching out and engaging with the growing number of women working in the insurance industry was an essential element of that process of change.\n\n“I sat down with Barbara Merry, who took on the role as the first chair of iWIN, and said we have the money to run this for three years so let’s see where we can take it. Barbara and her successors and everyone who has served iWIN have put iWIN at the heart of the Livery.”\n\nThe current iWIN chair Claire McDonald said that iWIN was determined to keep building the female presence in the WCI: “We are about 23% of the WCI’s membership now so let’s make it our objective to lift that to 30%.”\n\nShe said this year would see iWIN holding ten events to mark its ten years: “Tonight’s wonderful celebration is the first and the next one will be our Imposter Syndrome – Me Too event on 13 February.\"\n\nShe invited everyone to raise a glass and toast ten years of iWIN.\n\nVideo highlights of the evening"
