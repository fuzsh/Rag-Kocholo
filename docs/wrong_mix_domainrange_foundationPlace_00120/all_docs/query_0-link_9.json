        "text": "Next week the ballots for the 2022 European Society of Intensive Care Medicine - ESICM elections will open, and I am standing as a candidate for the position of President-Elect. All Ordinary, International and Dual-membership ESICM Members, Members-in-training and N&AHP Plus members have a vote, and I would encourage all ESICM members to use their vote as with this, you will help sculpt the future of the society. Let it be clear that I stand for a society that is inclusive and transparent, that cherishes teamwork, that is guided by science and that helps shaping the future of intensive care medicine. My keywords for ESICM are Excellence, Science, Identity, Collaboration and Member. Still, I want to focus on what we, together, can do for the society. Rather than valuing my activities in and achievements for our society, I ask you to look at my plans for ESICM. Rather than looking at the past, I will ask you to look at the future. In my manifesto that you can find on the ESICM website soon, you can find more about my motivation, vision, and program for ESICM. For this, I count on your support. I am confident that together with all ESICM members, we can further strengthen our society. ðŸ«µ Use your vote.
