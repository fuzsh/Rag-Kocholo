        "text": "Co-Founder and Managing Partner\n\nMargot has worked in search and executive recruiting for over twenty years, with a focus on diversity search within financial services since 2004. She co-founded Broad Street with the mission of continuing to help clients increase diversity across their leadership ranks and advancing the opportunities available for underrepresented groups.\n\nAttending Boston Latin School, America’s first public school, gave Margot a deep appreciation of different cultures, a passion for equality, and a drive for excellence in all her endeavors. Margot is a graduate of Boston University. While at BU, her dedication to advancing opportunities for underrepresented and marginalized groups, and particular advocacy for women, was further propelled by her Women’s Studies coursework.\n\nMargot is an active member of AIMSE, IWIN, WIPN, 100 Women in Finance, and the CFA Society, where she leads DE&I seminars and executive career workshops. She lives in Charlestown, MA with her husband Matt, daughters Bohan and Fiona, and son Lewis. She enjoys being active and exploring the diversity of the city.\n\nCo-Founder and Managing Partner\n\nMilena brings nineteen years of executive search experience to the firm, specializing in leadership roles across investments and client facing functions. Prior to co-founding Broad Street, she spent a decade with a Boston-based executive search firm where she ran a national investment management practice.\n\nMilena is a graduate of University of Lynchburg in Virginia where she earned a dual BA in International Relations and German. She earned her MA at Central European University in Budapest, Hungary. She is an active industry advisor with DIME and participates in IWIN, 100 Women in Finance, and Women in Fintech.\n\nIn 1983, seven-year-old Milena and her family escaped from the former Communist Czechoslovakia. Her family spent the next three years living in Switzerland until receiving asylum to come the United States in 1987. Her formative experience as a young immigrant child instilled in Milena an entrepreneurial spirit, a drive to give back, and a deep sense of gratitude to call the United States of America home.\n\nMilena lives in Charleston, SC and enjoys international travel, exploring nature, and walks on the beach with family. She lives with her husband David, their children Robbie and Petra, and a Golden Retriever named Brady."
