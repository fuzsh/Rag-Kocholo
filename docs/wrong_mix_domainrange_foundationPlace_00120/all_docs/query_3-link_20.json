        "text": "When most of your waking hours is working… wouldn’t it be fantastic to have a community to help support you?! Community is crucial. I found mine on the investment side. Had an inspiring evening with a group of remarkable women investment insurance #leaders, hosted by #IWIN (Insurance Women Investment Network) and sponsored by Lucid Capital Management LLC and PAG. We delved into #authenticconversations about #advocacy, #impostersyndrome, #hardships, #dreams, and #aspirations. It's in these #genuineconnections that we truly define who we are and who we aspire to be. A highlight of the evening was witnessing how we lift one another up, even in networking settings, and fiercely advocate for equal work and equal pay. If you're seeking a supportive community of women champions, consider joining us. Together, we can empower and uplift each other on our journeys. Sincere thank you to Carolina Estefania Siles and Nadia Patel, CFA who have been avid sponsors of #women and IWIN!
