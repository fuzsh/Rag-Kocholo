Great for\n\nsmall biz and tech-savvy offers.\n\nContact Bethesda List Center info@bethesda-list.com\n\nVoice: 301.986.1455\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n* iWin.com Uses 100% Online Marketing to Attract 3.2 Million\n\nFemale Visitors a Month\n\nThis April free game site iWin.com launched a new site\n\nsection entitled “For Her.” Within a month their visitor\n\ncounts had jumped 30%, with 3.2 million female total\n\nvisitors and a Top 40 spot in MediaMetrix’s rankings.\n\nSenior VP Sales & Marketing Mark Stroman told us, “we just\n\ndid our homework with strategically-placed, smartly-priced\n\nmedia buys.” 100% of which were online! iWin.com tested\n\nads on more than 1,000 sites, finally settling for a regular\n\npresence on more than 100, including LifeMinders, e-\n\nGreetings.com, SmartReminders and iVillage.com. Although\n\nStoham says, “I don’t think you’re going to see a lot of\n\nSuperBowl spots coming out of us,” he does admit the site is\n\nnegotiating “significant” partnerships with brick-and-\n\nmortars at this time, as well as partnerships with major\n\nentertainment brands. Interested in co-branded or\n\npartnering with iWin.com? email buzdev@iwin.com.\n\nIn the meantime, we’d like to applaud the site for\n\nrecognizing a general-interest consumer site can grow\n\nsubstantially when they specifically target women.\n\nhttp://www.iwin.com\n\n* Women and Kids Sites in Trouble with the FTC\n\nRecently, the FTC slapped seven Internet retailers,\n\nincluding ToysRUs.com, BabiesRUs.com, KBkids.com and\n\nMacys.com, with hefty fines for failing to warn customers\n\nabout shipping delays during last year's holiday season. Now\n\nToysRUs.com, Toysmart.com and several other\n\neretailers are rumored to be in violation of a federal\n\nonline privacy policy about customer data sharing. There's\n\nonly so much that marketing can do to build and maintain a\n\nreputable online image. After that, word-of-mouth does its\n\ndamage. Consumer complaints fuel these investigations by the\n\nFeds, so you make the call.\n\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/opa/2000/07/toolate.htm\n\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/opa/2000/07/toysmart2.htm\n\n* WomensNewsLink.com Launches Syndicated Content Feeds for\n\nSites Targeting Women & Girls\n\nColor us impressed. WomensNewsLink.com just launched their\n\nbeta site detailing the news content feeds they’ll be\n\noffering Web sites on a syndicated basis in a few weeks.\n\nThis is no same old, same old beauty-and-parenting news for\n\nwomen. Contributors, rounded up by Chris Copeland, former\n\nNightly Business Report producer, include high-profile\n\nfemale journalists from NPR, Sports Illustrated and the LA\n\nTimes. This is truly a global news feed, with correspondents\n\nfrom Iceland, India and even a dorm room at Brown\n\nUniversity. If you’re looking for really sticky site\n\ncontent, we recommend you check this out today.\n\nhttp://www.womensnewslink.com\n\n* Campaign Review: OldNavy.com's Random Banner Placements\n\nWe were psyched to see Old Navy online as we are big fans of\n\ntheir brick-and-mortar stores; and more convenient shopping\n\nis always a good thing. But, what’s up with their media\n\nplacement?\n\nWhen we searched Yahoo.com, Go.com and AltaVista for “old\n\nnavy” while logged in as a female persona, we noticed Old\n\nNavy banners were served without regard to visitor sex. For\n\nexample, the first offer we got was for a “denim fit tool”\n\nfor men. Something that sounds kinda interesting, but we\n\nalways hoped the guys would bring it to the party … not us!\n\nLater we were served an ad for OldNavy.com’s Uniform shop.\n\nAgain something we applaud (gotta love a man in uniform) but\n\nnot exactly a hot button for female purchases.\n\nOldNavy.com, we know you are relatively new to the Web but\n\nsurely your media buyer isn’t. Come on, serve us up\n\nsomething we’d like!\n\nhttp://www.oldnavy.com\n\n* Media Buy of the Week: L90’s Women’s Channel\n\nWe like the L90 online ad network because their team take a\n\nconsultative role when they’re selling you media. L90’s\n\nLauren Kaye explained to us, “When it comes to media\n\nplanning, people are overwhelmed with information these\n\ndays. So we are there to help as a one-on-one personal\n\nconsultant. We also help you take your online campaign\n\nbeyond the banner to sponsorships, microsites, integrated\n\ncontent, and other things that make sense.”\n\nL90’s women’s channel includes sites of interest to women at\n\nall stages of life, from pregnancy through active\n\nretirement. You can slice by site, interest or to some\n\nextent by demographic.

L90’s Allyson Davis VP Corporate\n\nMarketing shared the details with us.\n\nCAMPAIGN\n\nOnline advertising network L90 suggested that\n\niVillage work with premiere entertainment Web site\n\nHollywood.com’s Women in Film site section. Instead of just\n\nplacing banners, they decided to turn the media buy into a\n\ncontent partnership.\n\nWomen love iVillage’s Astrology.net content. So,\n\nHollywood.com proposed that iVillage add a “Celebrity\n\nHoroscope” section to the Women in Film area. The new\n\nsection featured astrologically-based celebrity profiles.\n\nBanners and other in-site links offered visitors the chance\n\nto visit iVillage to read their own horoscopes.\n\nHollywood.com supported the Celebrity Horoscope section by\n\nrunning banners for it throughout its entire site, as well\n\nas promoting it in their weekly, member, email newsletter.\n\nRESPONSE: The campaign achieved clickthrough rates as high\n\nas 52%!\n\nNOTES: L90’s Davis says, “This campaign illustrates the\n\nbenefits of developing relevant content and using\n\ntechnologies that are consistent with your marketing\n\nobjectives (customer acquisition, reminder medium, driving\n\ntraffic) in a way that doesn't interfere with the consumer's\n\nreason for being on the Internet.”\n\nCheck out samples for yourself at:\n\nhttp://www.l90.com/email_stationery/images/dot.gif\n\nhttp://www.l90.com/email_stationery/images/sig_logo.gif\n\nhttp://www.l90.com\n\n------\n\nPRACTICAL KNOW HOW: ADVERTAINMENT\n\n------\n\n)))))))))))))))))) Free Direct Mail Report ))))))))))\n\nGet Your FREE Copy of “Website Marketing: How to Drive\n\nTraffic Using Direct Mail.”\n\nYou’ll learn how to use DM to drive qualified traffic to\n\nyour website and the top 12 facts to avoid wasting money.\n\nPlus see lots of useful live samples.\n\nFor your free copy: http://www.jamagency.com/wmg\n\n)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))\n\n* Advertain.com on Creating and Measuring Rich Media Ads\n\nThat \"Don't Suck!\"\n\n\"Interactive and entertaining commercial messages encourage\n\nwomen to engage longer with a brand,\" says Amy Ng, Director\n\nof Marketing and Sales for Advertain On-Line Inc.\n\nAdvertain On-Line is a company specializing in market\n\nresearch for the many advertisers and agencies investing in\n\nrich media ads these days. Tens of thousands of female\n\nconsumers from a startling wide range of ages, voluntarily\n\nvisit the site each week just to interact with and give\n\ntheir personal impressions of the latest advertainments from\n\nsuch advertisers as Hersheys, Chrysler and Paramount/Sony.\n\nWomen’s average site visit-time is 16 minutes -- proving\n\nthis ultra-busy demographic will take the time to really\n\nexamine a rich media ad they like.\n\nAnd here’s the fascinating fact: the ads site visitors rank\n\nas their top 10 favorites almost never match the ads agency\n\ncreatives rank as their top 10 favorites! For example,\n\nsite visitors loved rich media ads from “Who Wants to Be a\n\nMillionaire” and Ford that ad industry insiders didn’t think\n\nwere all that special.\n\nSince the customer is always right, and production costs for\n\nthe average advertainment ad start around $50,000, it’s\n\nprobably smart for you to do some audience testing research\n\nwhen investing in this medium. Which, Advertain On-Line\n\nInc. will be more than happy to do for you. They suggest\n\nyou have your ad rated by at least 200-300 respondents for\n\nan accurate statistical pool using a 10-or-so question long\n\nsurvey. The cost? Around $2,000.\n\nWe at eMarketingtoHer.com would also like to suggest you go\n\nwith an agency heavily experienced in advertainments your\n\nfirst time round. We’ll bet most agencies will claim they\n\ncan do it for you, but for the amount of money you’re\n\nspending why not go for an acknowledged expert? Blast\n\nStudios, Red Sky Interactive, Black Hammer and Flashy Ideas\n\nare among the leaders.\n\nIn the meantime to wet your imagination, here’s a link to\n\nKodak’s DC280 Camera ad which women visiting the\n\nAdvertain.com site voted #1 for July 2000. We like it too\n\nbecause it feels like the camera is “right in your hands.”\n\n(But we think the copywriting could use a little work.)\n\nhttp://www.kodak.com/US/en/digital/cameras/dc280/demo/dc280HowShockwave.shtm\n\nl\n\nFor your free copy of their newsletter with the monthly Top\n\n10 rankings, become an industry insider member at:\n\nhttp://www.advertain.com/ad_insider/index.html\n\n----------\n\neMarketingToHer.com INFO\n\n----------\n\nEditorial Contact:\n\nKim M.
