        "text": "Barcelona.- Over the course of the last year most of the major international media groups have restructured their online operations. In some cases, such as with Disney and News Corporation, this restructuring has meant either disappearance or else integration of online divisions with their “traditional” counterparts within the company, in an attempt to cut costs. That is what, for example, News Corporation did some months back in transferring production of FoxNews.com, FoxSports.com and Fox.com to the old teams at the Fox television group.\n\nVivendi Universal, however, has chosen a different strategy. This week it announced the creation of a new company, Vivendi Universal Net USA Group, based in Los Angeles, which will bring together the online entertainment companies owned by this powerful media conglomerate.\n\nThe list of properties making up the new unit includes the music sites MP3.com, EMusic.com, GetMusic.com and RollingStone.com; the games sites Flipside.com and Uproar.com; and the betting and promotions sites Iwin.com and VirtualVegas.com. In all, in the US alone, the Vivendi Universal sites have over 36 million unique users.\n\nVivendi Universal’s strategy, apart from the strictly organizational changes, involves a major rethink of its online business model which, in fact, could affect the whole of the entertainment industry. Business is not so much in having users subscribe to particular content as in the applications that permit access to that content.\n\nIn this way, Vivendi Universal hopes to create a “centralized infrastructure” for all its content (music, movies, games, education) that will allow for a completely personalized relationship with each user. That is how CEO of the new company Robin Richards, up until now chairman and CEO of MP3.com, explained it in his press release.\n\nThe idea, which is similar to that being pursued by other major groups, such as AOL Time Warner and Bertelsmann, involves aggregating all their users within a single network that provides them with everything they need for news and entertainment. With such networks, the key will be Napster style applications – which are not going to be free.\n\nMore broadband access\n\nWhere the future certainly does lie is in broadband access. Data on the growth of this sort of access in the countries belonging to it is provided in a recent report by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (PDF file). At the end of 1999 there were only 3.1 million webusers with high-speed connections. A year later there were already 14 million and by the end of June this year the number had risen to 22 million.\n\nAccess via ADSL lines is what it is growing most quickly, to the point that they are catching up with cable. At the end of 1999 the proportion was very much in favor of cable (84% vs. 16%), but by June this year the figures were practically identical (51% cable, 49% ADSL).\n\nBy country, Korea remains the world leader in broadband Internet penetration, with nearly 14% of users enjoying high speed access. Next we have Canada (6.2%), Sweden (4.5%) and the US (3.2%). Spain comes in at 19, with 0.47% penetration, behind such countries as Belgium, France, Australia and Portugal.\n\nNew online: Film, Olympics, chess and philanthropy\n\nPeople not losing faith in the possibilities the Internet has to offer as an entertainment medium include the organizers of the Sundance Film Festival, who have decided to hold a second edition of their Sundance Online Film Festival, from December 20th to January 20th.\n\nTurning to other things, the official Salt Lake City 2002 Winter Olympics site, produced by MSNBC.com has been launched. Also warming up we have the Online World Chess Event, a chess tournament to be held online from January to June 2002, with $1.4 million in prize money, in which cyberplayers making it beyond the first round could find themselves up against Grand Masters like Garry Kasparov, Viswanathan Anand, Anatoly Karpov, Vladimir Kramnik and Judit Polgar.\n\nThe final mention in this Chronicle is for the non-profit Network for Good project, created by AOL Time Warner, Yahoo! and Cisco in collaboration with more than 20 non-profit organizations. The aim is to increase both the number of donations made via the Internet and the number of volunteers.\n\nWebsites mentioned in this Chronicle\n\nDisney: www.disney.com\n\nNews Corporation: www.newscorp.com\n\nFoxNews.com: www.foxnews.com\n\nFoxSports.com: www.foxsports.com\n\nFox.com: www.fox.com\n\nVivendi Universal: www.vivendiuniversal.com\n\nMP3.com: www.mp3.com\n\nEMusic.com: www.emusic.com\n\nGetMusic.com: www.getmusic.com\n\nRollingStone.com: www.rollingstone.com\n\nFlipside.com: www.flipside.com\n\nUproar.com: www.uproar.com\n\nIwin.com: www.iwin.com\n\nVirtualVegas.com: www.virtualvegas.com\n\nAOL Time Warner: www.aoltimewarner.com\n\nBertelsmann: www.bertelsmann.com\n\nOCDE: www.oecd.org\n\nSundance: www.sundance.org\n\nSalt Lake City 2002: www.olympics.com\n\nMSNBC.com: www.msnbc.com\n\nOnline World Chess: www.onlineworldchess.com\n\nNetwork for Good: www.networkforgood.com\n\nYahoo!: www.yahoo.com"
