        "text": "Privacy Policy\n\nYour privacy is important to iWin. IWin operates various websites with game-related products and services (our \"Sites\") and provides applications for the provision of various online and mobile services, such as search and gaming (collectively, \"Applications\") through which personal information may be collected. This privacy policy (the \"Privacy Policy\") applies to all personal information collected by iWin through our Sites and Applications.\n\nIf iWin is operating the Sites or Applications under an agreement with a specific partner, the branding of the Site or the Application will indicate the specific partner with which iWin operates the Site or Application (\"Identified Partners\"). In such an event, iWin may share the data collected with that particular identified Partner. Accordingly, iWin's use of your data is subject to our Privacy Policy - and our Identified Partner's use of your data is subject to its privacy policy. You should familiarize yourself with such Identified Partner's privacy policy. Some of iWin's Identified Partners serve their own ads or use other ad-serving networks. To opt out of data collection by an Identified Partner's ad-serving network, please see that Identified Partner's privacy policy.\n\nThis Privacy Policy describes our practices regarding the information collected online through Sites and Applications maintained by iWin, and not to websites or services offered and operated by other companies or organizations to which we link. Additionally, this Privacy Policy does not cover information that we collect through other methods, such as mail-in sweepstakes.\n\nIWin is headquartered in the United States and the collected data is stored in the United States. Although we operate Sites and maintain some operations outside the United States, when you become a member of one of our online communities or programs, make a purchase from iWin or register for one of the Applications, your account is with a United States company and your data will be stored in the United States. By registering and using this Site, Members acknowledge that the processing of their personally identifying information for the purposes described above may involve the transfer of such personally identifying information from within the European Economic Area (\"EEA\") to countries outside the EEA whose data protection regulation may not be as stringent as that within the European Union.\n\nIn accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), this Privacy Policy contains information about the personal and usage data iWin collects about each user, and how that information is collected, stored and managed.\n\nTo request your personal and product usage data, or have your data/account removed, please email support@iwin.com.\n\nBY USING THIS SITE, APPLICATION, OR USING ANY OF THE RELATED SERVICES, YOU SIGNIFY YOUR ASSENT TO IWIN'S PRIVACY POLICY AND YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT IWIN MAY PROCESS YOUR DATA IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE FOREGOING, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SITE OR APPLICATION OR IF ALREADY A MEMBER YOU MUST TERMINATE YOUR ACCOUNT.\n\nTHE INFORMATION WE COLLECT\n\nIf you are a visitor to a Site or a user of an Application, you may provide us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly provide us with on an individual basis (\"Personal Information\") and statistical and usage information collected using cookies and other technologies as you browse the Site or use an Application (\"Usage Information\").\n\n1.

In all instances, iWin has made a substantial investment in server, database, backup, and firewall technologies to protect the assets of the Site, including the confidentiality of information collected about Members. These technologies are deployed as part of a sophisticated security architecture and protocol.\n\nEmail Information\n\nIn addition to providing us with your email address as part of registration, if you choose to correspond with us via email or by using a web interface to reach customer support, we may retain the content of your messages together with your email address and our responses.\n\n2. Usage Information\n\nSimilar to other commercial websites, we utilize standard technologies such as \"cookies,\" clear GIFs (also known as \"web beacons\" or \"action tags\") and web server logs to collect information about how the Sites and Applications are used. Additionally, when you connect to or download an Application, we may retrieve information from the computer used to log onto the Application. The information we collect may include technical information about your computer, system and application software, and peripherals, and any data related to the use and operation of the software used in connection with the Application.\n\nCookies\n\nAs an important and necessary part of providing customizable and personalized services to our Members, iWin sites or its advertisers may use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to store and sometimes track non-personal information about Members while on the Website. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to a Member's browser from a Web server and stored on a Member's computer hard drive. Areas of iWin sites where Members are prompted to log in or that are customizable require acceptance of cookies. These technologies are also used to help iWin track the response to messages sent to Members on the part of marketers so that iWin can monitor and report campaign results to the marketer and track response history and campaign effectiveness. In addition, banner advertisements are displayed on our websites which may contain certain cookies. While iWin uses cookies in other parts of our websites, the cookies received with banner ads are collected by our advertising partners, and iWin does not have access to this information. Members may opt out of the advertising that they see on our sites targeted specifically to them by going to the respective sites' privacy policy(ies) and following directions. To opt out of Google's \"interest-based ads\" and to learn more about Google's collection of personal information to serve ads in connection with iWin, please go to www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/. With respect to cookies, users have a choice. By modifying their browser preferences, they have the choice to accept all cookies; they will be unable to use those iWin services that require the use of cookies in order to participate.\n\nClear GIFs\n\nClear GIFs are small, invisible graphic images (usually only one pixel) placed on a web page or email message to capture statistical usage information. They are not used to collect personal information about you.\n\nIP Addresses\n\nAn IP address is a number assigned to your computer every time you are connected to the internet. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data known as \"traffic data\" so that appropriate data (such as the web pages you request) and geographically relevant content can be sent to you.\n\nHARDWARE ID\n\niWin stores the hardware id, a unique identifier associated with the PC computer you use to access our websites and Applications, to determine a unique user within our systems. The hardware ID allows iWin to determine if multiple accounts have been created on the same PC, and to prevent attempts by a single user or household to receive introductory offers to our subscription program(s) multiple times by using different email addresses or credit cards during registration and checkout. multiple accounts or using multiple credit cards.\n\nThe hardware ID may also be associated with any activity the user has taken in the context of a marketing campaign, such as viewed a promotional page, installed the Download Games Manager Application, initiated a game download, created an account or created a subscription, or canceled the a subscription.\n\nCUSTOMER ID\n\nWhen a user creates an account on the iWin system, that user is assigned a Customer ID, which is displayed in the Personal Information section of My Account. The Customer ID gives the user a fixed non changing identifier that stays with their account from point of creation.\n\nWhen a user registers on the iWin system, a single sign on account is created, and a unique user identity (uuid) is generated at this point in time and saved in the user’s database record. This uuid does not change over time, unlike other personal data such as email address, postal code and credit card information. The Customer Id is thus connected to an end user’s account, and by extension can be used to find the user’s current:\n\nEmail address.\n\nHardware ID\n\nAll other data related to the end user in the iWin system.\n\nIf a user has multiple accounts within a single website or multiple websites operated by iWin, each account has a unique Customer ID.\n\nADVERTISING\n\nOur Advertisers\n\nIWin's advertisers and advertising vendors display targeted advertisements. Although we do not provide any personal information to the advertiser or advertising vendor, by interacting with or clicking on an ad you acknowledge the possibility that the advertiser may assume you meet the targeting criteria used.\n\nIn addition to cookies placed by iWin or its agents as described above, advertisers and advertising vendors that serve ads onto our Sites may use their own cookies or other tracking technologies. We cannot be responsible for the privacy policies or practices of any such advertisers and vendors.\n\nHOW WE USE THE INFORMATION\n\nUses of your Personal Information\n\nIWin will use your information primarily to provide you with our products and services and to receive payment from you.

You may opt out of some of these uses.\n\nIWin may also provide Personal Information to companies we engage as contractors or agents to perform services for us, such as maintaining software, providing email marketing, or administering a sweepstakes or contest. Information will be shared with contractors only to the extent reasonably necessary for them to perform these services on our behalf, and pursuant to confidentiality obligations.
