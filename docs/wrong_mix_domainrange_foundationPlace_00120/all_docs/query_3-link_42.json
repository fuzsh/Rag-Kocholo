        "text": "Diversity Woman pays tribute to Black women who are disrupting the status quo in executive leadership across industries both inside and beyond Corporate America\n\nBy Carolyn M. Brown\n\nBlack women continue to defiantly chip away at Corporate America’s concrete ceiling. For the third time in the past three years, a Black woman has taken the helm at a major US corporation, with the appointment of Toni Townes-Whitley as CEO of Science Applications International Corp. (SAIC), which provides tech and engineering services primarily to the US government. This makes her one of two Black women running Fortune 500 companies, joining TIAA’s Thasunda Brown Duckett. (Rosalind Brewer left her CEO post at Walgreens Boots Alliance in 2023.)\n\nDiversity Woman is proud to present its fourth annual Elite 100, honoring the achievements of Black women. The Class of 2024 highlights 100 extraordinary Black women in the C-suite and as executive leaders at some of the largest US and multinational corporations, major national nonprofit organizations, and leading business enterprises. They represent fields as varied as finance, tech, energy, health care, retail, food, beverage, sports, and entertainment. Without a doubt, these 100 executive all-stars are making their mark.\n\nThe story of women rising to leadership positions is both encouraging and exasperating. According to the latest Women in the Workplace report from McKinsey, in partnership with LeanIn.org, since 2015 the number of women in the C-suite has increased from 17 percent to 28 percent, and the representation of women at the VP and SVP levels has also improved significantly. However, progress is lagging in the middle of the pipeline, and women are leaving at a higher rate than in past years. Across the corporate pipeline, women of color (Black, Asian, and Latinx) are especially underrepresented. They make up 6 percent of leadership in the C-suite and 7 percent at the VP level. That number drops to 1.4 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively, for Black women.\n\nYet progress is slowly being made. A view from the top of the chief executive landscape shows that many Black women are disrupting the status quo in leadership across sectors and industries. Many are running multi-\n\nmillion-dollar enterprises under the dual role of founder and CEO, giving them even greater clout and a higher stake in the success of their companies. The fastest-growing group of entrepreneurs in the United States is still composed of Black women.\n\nThe 2024 Elite 100 class amply demonstrates that Black women are transforming obstacles into opportunities and blazing new trails. For anyone who claims it’s too challenging to find qualified Black women leaders to promote into the C-suite or onto boards, look no further than our list. Please join us in honoring this year’s Elite 100.\n\n—————\n\nMethodology: How the Elite 100 Were Chosen\n\nThe Diversity Woman Elite 100, Class of 2024, highlights extraordinary Black women leaders. Our roster comprises some of the most powerful women executives in C-suite and senior level roles at Fortune 500, Fortune 1000, Fortune Global 500, S&P 500, and S&P 400 companies, as well as other leading business enterprises and national nonprofits.
