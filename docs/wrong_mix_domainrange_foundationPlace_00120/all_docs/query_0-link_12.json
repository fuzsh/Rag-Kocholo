The inscription has been a powerful incentive for a more active movement, as indicated by a growing number of Papuan Noken sanggar (traditional art studios) and increased involvement of communities, companies, and individuals in the efforts to conserve Noken Papua. Previously, there were no well-coordinated sanggar. At present, sanggars have sprung up in Jayapura and Manokwari cities as well as regencies of Papua and West Papua provinces.\n\nAgencies, sanggar and communities carry out trainings not only to advance knowledge of Noken practitioners and craftswomen on Noken cultural values, meanings and functions, but also to refine skills to create Noken products that are more attractive and have higher economic value. Practitioners and handcrafters of Noken are expected to be able to provide essential information of Noken as cultural heritage to Noken enthusiasts, tourists, and wider societies.\n\nMultistakeholders collaboration between central and local governments together with communities, sanggar, and individuals, have been carried out actively in promoting Noken through festivals, exhibitions, and art shows at the national and global level, including at the London Fashion Week in 2019.\n\nThe advancement of technology has facilitated the promotion and dissemination of Noken Papua into broader market, particularly through e-commerce platform.\n\nAs part of the efforts to preserve raw materials for Noken, the Papuan Noken Community has pioneered the inauguration of Papua Noken Plant Arboretum (ANP) in 2020. Cultivating Arboretum as essential plant species used for Noken weaving is also important to increase awareness and promote Noken craft-making in an environmentally-friendly manner.\n\nThe overall activities mentioned-above are aimed to enhance the elements of sustainability, safeguarding, and transmission of knowledge of Noken to wider communities, in particular younger generation.\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has indeed created challenges in the implementation of Noken action plan of 2017-2020, in particular the Noken inventory. Nevertheless, safeguarding Noken as a living culture has well resonated in the minds and hearts of the stakeholders, including the necessity to continuously update Noken inventory, despite social, environmental, and technological dynamics.\n\nOverall, since its inscription on UNESCO's ICH List, Noken is increasingly recognised by people outside Papua, even the world. A growing number of Noken communities and sanggars have contributed to this positive development. For this reason, Noken conservation efforts in the future will be further enhanced through strengthening capacity of sanggars, communities, and individuals who are Noken enthusiasts.\n\nA.7.\n\nContact person for correspondence\n\nProvide the name, address and other contact information of the person responsible for correspondence concerning the report.\n\nTitle (Ms/Mr, etc.)\n\nMr\n\nFamily name\n\nFarid\n\nGiven name\n\nHilmar\n\nInstitution/position\n\nDirectorate General of Culture\n\nAddress\n\nKompleks Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan, Gedung E lantai 4, Jalan Jenderal Sudirman, Senayan, Jakarta\n\nTelephone number\n\n+62 21 572 5053\n\nE-mail address\n\ndirjenbud@kemdikbud.go.id\n\nOther relevant information\n\nditlinbud.dirjenbud@kemdikbud.go.id\n\npenetapan.ditlinbud@kemdikbud.go.id\n\nB\n\nMs\n\nB. Status of element inscribed on the Urgent Safeguarding List\n\nRefer to the nomination file or to previous reports, if any, as the basis for reporting on the current status of the element, and report only on relevant changes since the date of inscription on the List or since the previous report. Nomination files, specific timetables and earlier reports, if any, are available at https://ich.unesco.org or from the Secretariat, upon request.\n\nThe State Party shall pay special attention to the role of gender and shall endeavour to ensure the widest possible participation of the communities, groups and, where applicable, individuals concerned as well as relevant non-governmental organizations during the process of preparing this report, and is asked to describe how it has done so in point D below.\n\nB.1.\n\nSocial and cultural functions\n\nPlease explain the social and cultural functions and meanings of the element today, within and for its community, the characteristics of the bearers and practitioners, and any specific roles or categories of persons with special responsibilities towards the element, among others. Attention should be given to any relevant changes related to inscription criterion U.1 (‘the element constitutes intangible cultural heritage as defined in Article 2 of the Convention’).\n\nSocial and cultural functions\n\nNoken is a knitted net or hand-woven bag made of wood, tree bark, screw pine fibres, pandanus leaves, bamboo reeds, swamp grass, sago palm leaves, and orchid stem fibres. Today, Noken materials are sourced from water hyacinth plants and pineapple leaf fibre. Sometimes it uses natural dyes (fruit, tree barks, and leaves) and decorated with ornaments.\n\nNoken is used to carry everyday items. Larger Noken is used to hold babies, food supply, hosehold items, and to cover heads and/or backs. Sometimes, it is used as a substitute for fishing nets when fishing in lakes or rivers. Smaller sized Noken carries personal items such as money, areca nut, food, books and others.\n\nNoken is an important element used in many traditional ceremonies; as a symbol in female puberty ceremony, part of dowry at wedding ceremony, and in coronation ceremony of local leaders. When there is a dispute between ethnic groups, Noken becomes part of the peace offering, alongside with pigs and bia or Triton's clamshells.\n\nFor Papuan mothers, Noken is their emergency \"savings\" that could be used a means of exchange or barter. It has high economic value and can be sold at any time. Today, the number Noken-crafters are increasing as Noken market demand rises. Growing interest of Noken has further promoted the development of Papua’s creative economy.\n\nNoken represents individual ownership, bond, kinship, and cooperation. Noken with tight, closed knots is a personal or individual keepsake for dowries or heirlooms. The people of Papuan respect individual property rights and recognises private property of others. Noken with loose knots is more communal and symbolises mutual respect between individuals. Noken as a gift or award symbolises respect and gratitude to someone considered important and held in high esteem.\n\nNoken also inspires the creation of art and other cultural expressions; Konopa (Papuan Noken Community) creates Noken Dance and perform it at cultural performances. Pathfinder Source Indonesia proposes Noken weaving knowledge and skills as a requirement to move up the next social stage/rank. Scouts use the Noken-specific merit badge in Papua and West Papua, which is now recognised in international forums.\n\nNoken unites more than 250 ethnic groups in Papua. Higher complication on the Noken craft-making is used to distinguish one’s social status. Noken worn by leaders is different from those worn by ordinary people. The interest of people outside Papua to Noken has increased after Noken inscription on UNESCO's ICH List in 2012.\n\nB.2.\n\nAssessment of its viability and current risks\n\nPlease describe the current level of viability of the element, particularly the frequency and extent of its practice, the strength of traditional modes of transmission, the demographics of practitioners and audiences and its sustainability. Please also identify and describe the threats, if any, to the element's continued transmission and enactment and describe the severity and immediacy of such threats, giving particular attention to any strengthening or weakening of the element’s viability subsequent to inscription.\n\nAssessment of its viability and current risks\n\nThe transmission model of Noken's intangible cultural heritage knowledge from parents to their children is still practised today, such as in Arfak and Manokwari, West Papua. The development of Noken, especially after the inscription in the UNESCO ICH list, has escalated numbers of sanggars and communities who care about the preservation of Noken. In Jayapura, for example, although existing sanggars are not focused explicitly on Noken, certain times are dedicated explicitly to Noken. Meanwhile, in Sarni, there are six sanggars dedicated for Noken, which in practice, a Noken master teaches facilitators who then transfer the knowledge to the tutors. Meanwhile, in Biak, there is Noken training which represents different coastal areas.. Currently, there is a tendency that the inheritance of Noken values is starting to shift from parents to their children to sanggars or communities to the younger generation in Papua and West Papua.\n\nNoken handcrafts are the work of adult/middle age-women in Papua. Women engage in weaving or knitting as well as selling the product. All women's activities in order to produce Noken are done as a good distraction in their life cycle. The facts show that women can weave or knit Noken while breastfeeding and holding their children, selling merchandise, as well as selling their garden produces. Moreover, weaving or knitting Noken can be done without leaving domestic responsibilities, such as cooking, caring for children, and ensuring family members are in good health\n\nNowadays, proliferation of land function in Papua has threatened the availability of natural raw materials for Noken production. To anticipate this, the Papua Noken Community (Konopa) took the initiative to plant and create a plant nursery for the raw material for Noken production. The difficulty of getting natural raw materials has made many Noken crafters use wool yarn and sell Noken below the selling price of Noken from natural fibre. In addition to that, in the online markets, there are many Noken products that are made from non-authentic material. This misleading information will be detrimental for people who are interested in original Papuan Noken but do not have the knowledge to distinguish between authentic and non-authentic Noken.\n\nB.3.\n\nImplementation of safeguarding measures\n\nPlease report on the safeguarding measures described in the nomination file, and previous report, if any. Describe how they have been implemented and how they have substantially contributed to the safeguarding of the element during the reporting period, taking note of external or internal constraints such as limited resources. Include, in particular, information on the measures taken to ensure the viability of the element by enabling the community to continue to practise and transmit it. Include the following detailed information concerning the implementation of the set of safeguarding measures or safeguarding plan:\n\nB.3.a.\n\nObjectives and results\n\nIndicate what primary objective(s) were addressed and what concrete results were attained during the reporting period.\n\nObjectives and results\n\nThe main objective of the implementation of the action plan as stated in the Noken nomination dossier is to safeguard and ensure sustainable development of Noken as intangible cultural heritage. A number of efforts and activities have been carried as follows:\n\n1. Capacity building programs for Noken practitioners and craftwomen in order to obtain, retain, and enhance their knowledge and skills on the values, meaning, and functionality of Noken. Workshops and training are provided not limited to members of sanggars but also wider communities in Papua.\n\n2. The inclusion of Noken enthusiasts, trained Sanggar members and wider communities in the efforts of Noken preservation. In the past, the transition of knowledge and skills of Noken is mainly conducted in the smallest unit of the community, (mothers to children).\n\n3. Noken product design workshop for wider communities, creative associations, and universities in Jayapura municipality is organized by Konopa in collaboration with the Indonesian Agency for Creative Economy.\n\n4.The Papuan Noken Community has pioneered the establishment of Papua Noken Plant Arboretum (ANP) to ensure the availability of natural raw materials for Noken. It is also aimed to promote Noken craft-making in an environmentally-friendly manner.\n\n5. Multistakeholders collaboration (government, sanggars, communities, and individuals) in introducing and promoting Noken culture at the national and global level (including at the London Fashion Week in 2019). Various activities are conducted in the format of exhibitions, festivals, information disseminations, talk shows and art shows\n\nB.3.b.\n\nSafeguarding activities\n\nList the key activities that were carried out during this reporting period in order to achieve these expected results. Please describe the activities in detail and note their effectiveness or any problems encountered in implementing them.\n\nSafeguarding activities\n\nThe implementation of the Noken Safeguarding Action Plan for the 2017-2020 reporting period is as follows:\n\nInventory of Noken cultural heritage\n\nThe purpose of the inventory activity is to attain data on noken from various communities in Papua and West Papua provinces. The results are in the form of written notes and documentaries such as photos, videos, books/essays and other types of documentation so that Noken data can be appropriately filed.\n\nActivities: compiling research results/notes on every aspect of Noken, its meaning, values and function, natural raw materials (natural dyes), local names, the production process, etc. Noken Inventory has been carried out based on the ICH Inventory Writing and Nomination Guidelines issued by the Directorate General of Culture of the Ministry of Education and Culture. The Noken inventory has not been implemented as planned due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nRevision of Noken teaching materials\n\nThe purpose of this activity is to simplify the content and visual layout so students can easily understand and apply knowledge and skills they learn about traditional Noken. By understanding values, meaning and function of Noken, students are expected not only to appreciate Noken as part of their cultural identity, but also to safeguard and promote Noken as intangible cultural heritage.\n\nThis activity has not been completed during the reporting period as it is still being worked on.\n\nRefine craftsmanship and knowledge transmission\n\nThe objective of this activity is to enhance Noken’s knowledge, creativity, skills, and to ensure sustainable transmission of Noken-making knowledge to young handcrafters. In the past, the process of transmitting Noken-making knowledge and skills were passed on from mothers to their children. However, nowadays, the role of the said family tradition is gradually replaced by the Noken communities and sanggars.\n\nUpgrading knowledge and skills of Noken craftswomen through trainings and workshos in sanggars and communities have been carried out in Papua and West Papua provinces, in partnership between local government and communities.\n\nIncreasing knowledge and capacity of other practitioners such as entrepreneurs in the tourism sector is also part of the efforts to transmit values, meanings and functions of Noken to broader community. Once practitioners and crafters understand, they can further disseminate the values, meaning, and function of Noken to the wider communities.\n\nEnsure the availability of natural materials for Noken\n\nThe purpose of the following activities are to ensure the availability of natural fibre for Noken production\n\n• Tree-planting activities for Noken natural fibres. The cultivation of the natural fibers are adjusted to spefici landscape and conditions of urban areas in Papua.\n\n• Initiated the establishment of Arboretum Noken Papua Cultivation Plant, that serves as both as a place for training and education of Noken as well as a source for Noken-natural materials.\n\n• Identifying tree species and providing land for tree planting, which are carried out in collaboration communities and the provincial government.\n\nPromote Noken as intagible cultural heritage\n\nThis activity aims to introduce and promote Noken as a cultural heritage of Papua and Indonesia to a wider global communities. The activities carried out are exhibitions, festivals, talk shows, fashion shows incorporating noken materials, and so on.\n\nAs a significant part of promoting noken cultural heritage, the activities above are carried out by the national and local governments, sanggars, communities, and individuals.\n\nB.3.c.\n\nParticipation of communities, groups or individuals in the safeguarding activities\n\nDescribe how communities, groups or, if appropriate, individuals as well as relevant non-governmental organizations have effectively participated, including in terms of gender roles, in the safeguarding measures. Describe the role of the implementing organization or body (name, background, etc.) and the human resources that were available for implementing safeguarding activities.\n\nParticipation of communities, groups or individuals in the safeguarding activities\n\nKomunitas Noken Papua (Konopa) is a group of people who have common goals of conserving cultural heritage and creating a prosperous society through local values and wisdom embedded in the Papuan Noken crafts. Several activities are carried out through information dissemination, training and evaluation of Noken-knitting/weaving competence of members of the Adventist Church in Indonesia. Participants in this activity were members of Pathfinder Indonesia, Jayapura area which was held on 8 May 2016.\n\nOn 17 September 2017, a hundred participants from the Jayapura Scout Movement participated in the Seventh Regional Cultural Camp are introduced to various plants species used as raw material for Noken as well as experience firsthand the technique of Noken weaving.\n\nIn 2017, Kirab Pemuda Indonesia (Indonesian National Youth Parade) is organized in collaboration between Ministry of Education and Culture with the Ministry of Youth and Sports, with 72 youth participated from various regions of Indonesia. For general public, activities were also held in collaboration with the Hirosi Nature Lovers Club of Papua, called the Papua Sago Festival II on 21 June 2018, to demonstrate the making of Noken from sago leaves.\n\nNoken-weaving tradition is an integral part of Papuan women who carry multiple domestic and social roles. Noken craftswomen have the ability to generate additional income hence improve the welfare of the family. Traditionally, for the Papuan people, Noken is also regarded as a symbol of protection. It is reflected by the tradition of Papuan inland women who use Noken as a baby carrier while doing daily activities, or to carry food supplies or other things on the front, the back or side of their bodies.\n\nB.3.d.\n\nTimetable\n\nIndicate in a timetable when each activity was implemented.\n\nTimetable\n\nActivity schedules for implementations of Noken action plan of the 2017-2020 reporting period is as follows:\n\nIncrease the capacity of practitioners and craftswomen by transmitting knowledge of the values, meanings and functions of noken\n\nIn 2017, Directorate of Cultural Heritage and Diplomacy, Ministry of Education and Culture, collaborating with the West Papua Province Culture and Tourism Office, Industry and Trade Office, and Forestry Office, carried out “Duduk Para-Para Mana-Mana” for Noken Craftswomen in Manokwari municipality.\n\nEnsure the availability of natural materials for Noken production.\n\nIn 2016, Konopa initiated a pilot forest project to grow plants that can be used as raw materials for Noken.

This activity provides learning opportunities for Noken craftswomen, aiming to transmit Noken-making knowledge.\n\nIn 2019, Ministry of Education and Culture organised activities to promote Noken at Sarinah, one of the biggest shopping centre in Jakarta, aiming to promote Noken to urban communities.\n\nIn 2020, BPNB Papua held Traditional Craft Exhibition in Jayapura municipality. This provides Papuan Noken craftswomen from Jayapura municipality, Jayapura regency, and Keerom regency opportunities during the COVID-19 pandemic to display and sell their products.\n\nB.3.e.\n\nBudget expenditures\n\nProvide the detailed amounts of the funds used for the implementation of each activity (if possible, in US dollars), identifying the funding source for each (governmental sources, in-kind community inputs, etc.).\n\nBudget\n\nDuring the implementation of the 2017-2020 Noken action plan, the budget disbursed for the implementation of the action plan is as follows:\n\nActivities to increase the capacity of practitioners and craftswomen (knowledge of values, meanings and functions), are carried out as training and workshops for craftswomen. This activity spent approximately Rp. 500.000.000. Funds come from the national budget (Ministry of Education and Culture), as well as the provincial government budget (West Papua Province Culture and Tourism Office)\n\nActivities to ensure the availability of natural materials for Noken as carried out by the Konopa, is by the pilot garden project opening in 2016 up to the inauguration of the Arboretum for the Noken plant garden in 2020, which serves as a place for training and education. The total budget of this project is Rp. 240.000.000, which comes from crowd-funded and self-funded by Konopa.\n\nThe activity of improving craftsmanship is one of the essential activities in order to produce better quality of Noken products so that they can have higher economic value and expanding market. The budget used in this activity is Rp. 1.343.500000, which comes from provincial government budget (Papua Province and West Papua Province).\n\nThe Noken Cultural Heritage Promotion Activity is one of the most critical activities to introduce and promote Papuan Noken at the local, national, and global level. Many parties are involved in the promotion of Noken cultural heritage, including the central government, regional government, communities, sanggars and individuals. The budget used in this promotion activity is Rp. 1.693.302.000, which comes from both national and provincial government budget.\n\nB.3.f.\n\nOverall effectiveness of the safeguarding activities\n\nProvide an overall assessment of the effectiveness of the activities undertaken to achieve the expected results and of the efficiency of the use of funds for implementing the activities. Please indicate how the activities contributed to achieving the results and whether other activities could have contributed better to achieving the same results. Also indicate whether the same results could have been achieved with less funding, whether the human resources available were appropriate and whether communities, groups and individuals could have been better involved.\n\nOverall effectiveness of the safeguarding activities\n\nThe implementation of the safeguarding measures since the inscription of Noken Papua has contributed to raise the awareness of Noken to wider population.\n\nThe Noken Community, in collaboration with the Indonesian government, both central and regional, have organised capacity building activities to increase the capacity and skills of practitioners and craftswomen of Noken, especially the knowledge. values, meaning and function of Noken. These activities have resulted in a growing number of new Noken communities, especially at the Regency/City level. These new communities can further facilitate the dissemination of information on through formal, as well as informal platforms.\n\nThe craftsmanship refinement activities have resulted in increased Noken production. The emergence of new Noken craftswomen is a good indicator of the successful transmission of noken-making knowledge. The market for the distribution of Noken is expected be widened while crafters will also have more new platforms to sell their Noken.\n\nDatabase regarding the preservation of Noken is registered in the form of an inventory of the Noken Cultural heritage. Through this inventory, knowledge about the variety of Noken in various regions and various plants that can be sourced as the raw material for Noken-making is recorded and it can serve as a data reference for anyone who needs it. This database can also be used to develop teaching materials on Noken for teachers to deliver in schools at various levels.\n\nThe role of Konopa in ensuring the availability of natural raw materials for Noken is one of the safeguarding measures, which can be beneficial for Noken handicraft makers and practitioners. Some plant species require several years of cultivation before they can be used as raw material for Noken-making, but several types of plants are fast-growing and can be used to make Noken in a shorter period of time, and can be used without having to cut down the whole tree. The variety of plants cultivated on an area of 1 hectare are quite useful in meeting the need for natural raw materials for Noken in some areas. However, to be able to fully solve this raw material problem, more communities need to do the same, supported by the government in terms of funding and similar activities.\n\nNoken's participation in cultural promotion activities in Indonesia and at the international stage has raised the popularity of Noken. Through participation in these promotional activities, public and artists alike are becoming more enthusiastic about finding and owning Noken crafts\n\nC\n\nSekar Ayu\n\nC. Update of the safeguarding measures\n\nC.1.\n\nUpdated safeguarding plan\n\nPlease provide an update of the safeguarding plan included in the nomination file or in the previous report. In particular provide detailed information as follows:\n\na. What primary objective(s) will be addressed and what concrete results will be expected?\n\nb. What are the key activities to be carried out in order to achieve these expected results? Describe the activities in detail and in their best sequence, addressing their feasibility.\n\nc. How will the State(s) Party(ies) concerned support the implementation of the updated safeguarding plan?\n\nUpdated safeguarding plan\n\n1. Name of Activity: Ensuring the availability of natural raw materials for making Noken\n\n2. Name of Activity: Dissemination of the Important Values of Noken\n\n3. Name of Activity: Cultural Award for the Conservation of Noken\n\n4. Activity Name: Noken Inventory\n\n5. Name of Activity: Noken-related Social Entrepreneurship\n\nNoken is made from natural raw materials, and it is vital to pay attention to the sustainability of these raw materials. In some areas, Noken is made from natural materials such as tree bark fibres and fibres from forest orchids. Likewise, the natural dyes used to colour the noken come from plants available locally. Currently, Noken is made of other alternative natural materials, such as pineapple fibre and marsh grass fibre which are woven in such a way as to become a noken knotted bag. By conserving the natural resources of the material and colouring for making Noken, it helps to conserve nature and culture at the same time.To ensure the availability of natural raw materials for noken, Konopa has initiated the establishment of the Noken Arboretum for education and research purposes. This initiative receives support from the government through the Forestry Office and universities.\n\nThe Noken used by the Papuan has an essential value. This simple bag is a symbol of maturity for Papuan women and has an important position in resolving customary conflicts and in marriage rituals. These important values will be disseminated including through publication of books or materials on Noken and disseminated through exhibitions, discussions involving Noken communities and the making of documentary films, which is in line with inventory activities on Noken.\n\nAfter eight years Noken on the UNESCO's ICH list, Indonesia has identified Noken maestros who have long devoted themselves to preserve the Papuan Noken culture. To appreciate their efforts, the government will present the Noken maestros through a Cultural Award. The ideas that come from this community is considered necessary and in line with the objectives of developing human resources.\n\nPapua is famous for its vast territories and diversity of languages and cultures. The production and use of Noken itself are different between mountain communities and coastal communities, with different natural resources. Therefore, the Noken Enthusiasts Community proposes to make an inventory of Noken raw materials, and the government will support this activity through research and studies. This inventory activity is a follow-up to the recommendations in the first periodic report. This activity aims at creating an initial inventory or reference for those who need data related to Noken. In this case, the government will facilitate and support proposals from the community. This support aims to respect the values inherent in Noken and apply to people in Papua.\n\nC.2.\n\nTimetable for future actitivies\n\nProvide a timetable for the updated safeguarding plan (within a time-frame of approximately four years).\n\n00509\n\nTimetable\n\nThe Plant Arboretum which initiated by Konopa in an arboretum since 2016. The government will continue to support Konopa's efforts to ensure the availability of natural Noken raw materials through research and education, including through the Arboretum Plan, which is designed to run from 2021 to 2024.\n\nThe dissemination of the important value of Noken will begin in 2021 with an agenda of collecting materials or research related to the important values of Noken. Research acitivites involving Noken community will begin in mid-2021. After data collection, it is expected that from 2022 to 2024, the dissemination hese values can take place every year.\n\nCultural Award is a flagship and routine program organised by the Ministry of Education and Culture. From 2022 to 2024, the government and the community will identify people with important contribution to the development and use of Noken, for the award.\n\nThe vast area of distribution of Noken in Papua has its challenges for Noken Inventory activities, starting from the area distribution, raw materials, to the handcrafting process. The research will be carried out by the Papuan Noken Community, academics and local governments related to completing noken inventories. Activities will be carried out starting in 2021 by holding a Focus Group Discussion with stakeholders, followed by a field study in 2022 and it is hoped that in the following year, 2023, an e-inventory will be created which will be the primary source of reference for noken information.\n\nC.3.\n\nBudget for future activities\n\nProvide the estimates of the funds required for implementing the updated safeguarding plan (if possible, in US dollars), identifying any available resources (governmental sources, in-kind community inputs, etc.).\n\nBudget\n\nIn ensuring the availability of natural raw materials for noken, Konopa has provided land that is used as an arboretum for educational and research purposes. Efforts to develop the Arboretum will continue for the next four years by allocating Rp 350 million budget annually for four years. The budget is sourced from related Ministries and Government Agencies such as the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, the Ministry of Education and Culture, the Papua and West Papua Provincial Forestry Office, the Wamena Biological Botanical Garden and other stakeholders. The budget will also be used for policy formulation needed in protecting the natural raw materials of Noken.\n\nDissemination of important values about Noken will be carried out starting with research and field studies related to the distribution area, raw materials and techniques for making Noken. The results of these activities will be recorded and documented in a film which can be a medium for the dissemination of values related to Noken. The government will support this initiative by budgeting 400 million rupiahs annually throughout 2021-2024, totalling to 1.6 billion rupiahs. The budget is obtained from the budget of the Cultural Value Conservation Office as one of the Technical Implementing Units of the Ministry of Education and Culture in Papua. Another budget comes from the Directorate of Films, Music and New Media. The Directorate of Cultural Development and Utilisation will work with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to disseminate the values inherent in noken through films and books that have been made.\n\nRegarding the Cultural Award, it is the Ministry of Education and Culture's Award program in the Cultural Sector given to people who have perseverance in specific cultural fields. The local government and the Noken community will propose the name of a Noken maestro who is eligible for the award. The maestro of noken will be given a budget of 25 million every year (100 million rupiahs in 4 years) and will be used for the sake of preserving Noken.\n\nIn the Noken inventory activity, the Konopa has started an effort by collecting data material to be included in the Noken inventory. Konopa will collaborate with universities in Papua in research and development of Noken inventories. The estimated budget for each year is 400 million rupiahs, which is allocated from the Central Government and Local Government budgets. The Noken museum will also be used as a place to collect Noken inventory data from which contains research books related to Noken.\n\nC.4.\n\nCommunity participation\n\nPlease describe how communities, groups and individuals, as well as relevant non-governmental organizations have been involved, including in terms of gender roles, in updating the safeguarding plan, and how they will be involved in its implementation.\n\n00104\n\nCommunity participation\n\nEfforts to update the safeguarding plan are carried out by mapping the latest issues and collecting ideas from various stakeholders. These activities were carried out through Focus Group Discussions carried out by the community, local government and central government. Papuan Noken craftswomen are always actively involved in every meeting, by bringing the latest issues faced, as well as offering solutions, that are always communicated in many forums and Focus Group Discussions.\n\nIn ensuring the availability of natural Noken raw materials, the Arboretum that has been established by Konopa always involves women’s role with a clear division of tasks. The Arboretum is a tribute to Papuan women because Noken was initially handcrafted by women.\n\nAcademics will be involved in research related to the values inherent in Noken, the area of distribution, raw materials for the making, colouring, to inventory-making related to Noken.\n\nTraditional institutions, museums and other stakeholders will be involved in efforts to preserve Noken along with respect for the values embedded in Noken.\n\nThe government, through related ministries and institutions, as well as local governments and technical implementing units in Papua and West Papua, will continue to facilitate Noken by providing sufficient budget to assist Noken conservation efforts.\n\nC.5.\n\nInstitutional context\n\nPlease report on the institutional context for the local management and safeguarding of the element inscribed on the Urgent Safeguarding List, including:\n\na. the competent body(ies) involved in its management and/or safeguarding;\n\nb. the organization(s) of the community or group concerned with the element and its safeguarding.\n\n2007-10-15\n\nInstitutional context\n\n1.

There are two methods of making Noken, namely weaving and knotting. Both of these techniques are closely depended upon the area where the maker lives. The weaving is the ideal method for Noken makers living on coastal areas due to the type of materials available such as coastal pandanus/screw pines. Meanwhile, the knitting method is ideal for the makers living in the mountains due to the type of materials available such as bark, wood, and roots of trees that are abundant inland. Noken community comprises of people who wear Noken, of all age groups, male and female, Noken makers who are mostly women, and Noken enthusiasts.\n\nIn 2012, Noken inscribed on the UNESCO List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding. As mentioned in Noken nomination file point 2, the traditional know-how related to Noken is in need of urgent safeguarding because of risks of a gap in transmission to younger generations, competition from modern and imported products, and the scarcity of traditional materials that are being replaced by synthetic materials.\n\nAfter the inscription, the State Party responsible undertakes plan of activities/actions as referred to in the nomination file. The threats affecting Noken, immediately anticipated by the government by involving Noken communities in Papua and West Papua. Government, both central and local perform various activities in an effort to preserve the Noken culture. Central government, in this case Ministry of Education and Culture has compiled teaching materials on how to make Noken for early-childhood to high school/vocational school students. This was done the best way possible to ease transmission of Noken culture and making techniques to the students, to ensure Noken ICH sustainability. The teaching materials on Noken has been distributed in Papua and West Papua. In 2014, the local government encourage Noken-wearing for civil servants every Thursdays and Fridays. This is ideally effective to boost the production of Noken by craftperson (who are generally women known as “mama-mama Papua”). Sanggar (traditional arts training centres) revitalised, productivity improved to meet demands from general public, tourists, private, and government. The Noken inscription on the UNESCO ICH List, also impacted the Noken sellers at Hamadi souvenir market in Jayapura. Today, the demand of buyers and tourists, both foreign and domestic of natural materials Noken are increasing. According to one of the sellers, it is easier to sell natural materials Noken compared to the synthetic materials made.\n\nNatural-materials Noken gain popularity, especially among the younger generation. Through sanggar, young girls started to learn about weaving and knitting Noken. Today, the people of Papua have gain more pride to use Noken. This was due to the increase of socialisation and information about Noken by both government and communities, which has been inscribed on the UNESCO ICH list.\n\nThree activity measures are effective for safeguarding Noken. The first measure is the transmission of the culture to the younger generation, especially students. The second is facilitation, which means to provide facilities to the craftperson to develop and demonstrate their skills in a variety of events, such as trainings, festivals, and exhibitions. The third is the revitalization of Noken sanggar, both in Jayapura and Manokwari, capital of the provinces, as well as in all districts/municipalities.\n\nA.7.\n\nContact person for correspondence\n\nProvide the name, address and other contact information of the person responsible for correspondence concerning the report.\n\nTitle (Ms/Mr, etc.)\n\nMr\n\nFamily name\n\nFarid\n\nGiven name\n\nHilmar\n\nInstitution/position\n\nDirector General of Culture Ministry of Education and Culture\n\nAddress\n\nKementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan\n\nGedung E Lantai 4\n\nJalan Jenderal Sudirman\n\nSenayan\n\nJakarta 10270\n\nTelephone number\n\n+62 21 572 5035; +62 21 572 5578\n\nE-mail address\n\nhilmarfarid@kemdikbud.go.id\n\nOther relevant information\n\nB\n\nMr\n\nB. Status of element inscribed on the Urgent Safeguarding List\n\nRefer to the nomination file or to previous reports, if any, as the basis for reporting on the current status of the element, and report only on relevant changes since the date of inscription on the List or since the previous report. Nomination files, specific timetables and earlier reports, if any, are available at https://ich.unesco.org or from the Secretariat, upon request.\n\nThe State Party shall pay special attention to the role of gender and shall endeavour to ensure the widest possible participation of the communities, groups and, where applicable, individuals concerned as well as relevant non-governmental organizations during the process of preparing this report, and is asked to describe how it has done so in point D below.\n\nB.1.\n\nSocial and cultural functions\n\nPlease explain the social and cultural functions and meanings of the element today, within and for its community, the characteristics of the bearers and practitioners, and any specific roles or categories of persons with special responsibilities towards the element, among others. Attention should be given to any relevant changes related to inscription criterion U.1 (‘the element constitutes intangible cultural heritage as defined in Article 2 of the Convention’).\n\nSocial and cultural functions\n\nIn everyday life, Noken serves as a bag, clothing, or a head cover (cap). Noken is knotted net or woven bag handmade from wood, bark, roots of screw pine fibres. Sometimes Noken are colored and embellished with ornaments.\n\nBig size Noken carries garden produce, seafood, stems, babies, small animals, groceries, etc. Noken is also used to store goods like a food cupboard. Small size Noken carries personal items, such as money, betel nuts, food, books and others. Moreover, Noken can be used as clothing. The women of Papua, especially in rural areas wear Noken as clothes, either as a shirt or a skirt.\n\nIn addition to its daily functions, Noken has social, cultural, and economic functions.\n\nSocially, Noken serve as social identity of indigenous community of Papua; Noken unifies the indigenous communities in Papua. Noken is a unification symbol that unites more than 250 ethnic groups in Papua; Noken can distinguish one’s social status in society. The Noken worn by the leaders is different from that worn by ordinary people; Noken is also a symbol of togetherness, brotherhood and mutual help; Noken is also a recognition of property rights of individuals. The Papuan appreciate a person's property and careful with any object owns by others; Noken also interpreted as a token of appreciation from one person to another. Noken serves as gifts or as a memento to someone special and important to the giver.\n\nCulturally, Noken in an important part of dowry, in traditional ceremonies of marriage proposals and ceremonies; signs of maturity of a woman, Noken become a symbol of maturity in the initiation ceremony, a traditional ceremony of the coming of age in the human life cycle; coronation of traditional/customary leaders, Noken is a customary object required in the coronation ceremony of the leaders; one of the objects required for peace, required for the peace ceremony, customary objects that should be available are Noken, pig, and bia shell/sea shell. Once the three things collected the peace ceremony is considered legitimate and both warring ethnic groups reconciled; Noken is a family heritage that must be preserved. Noken is equal to any inherit objects, such as lands, houses, animals, Timor cloth, etc; a storage for treasures and heirlooms, such as bia shell/sea shell, Timor cloth, beads, etc.\n\nEconomically, Noken functions as a storage for family food supplies, when the food supplies stored in Noken is thinning it is time to refill. Thus, Noken is an \"early warning system\" of food stock; Noken also has a high economic value and can be sold at anytime. For mama-mama Papua, Noken is considered as their emergency \"savings\", for example for sending children to school; Noken serves as a currency of exchange or barter, for those who need a particular item can obtain the item by exchange it with a Noken; Noken can also function as a substitute for fishing tackle/net. Noken shape that resembles net is suitable for fishing.\n\nB.2.\n\nAssessment of its viability and current risks\n\nPlease describe the current level of viability of the element, particularly the frequency and extent of its practice, the strength of traditional modes of transmission, the demographics of practitioners and audiences and its sustainability. Please also identify and describe the threats, if any, to the element's continued transmission and enactment and describe the severity and immediacy of such threats, giving particular attention to any strengthening or weakening of the element’s viability subsequent to inscription.\n\nAssessment of its viability and current risks\n\nThe impact of Noken inscription on the UNESCO ICH List is positive for its sustainability. Noken stakeholders and community work together to revitalise it. Traditional Noken made of natural not synthetic materials regain its popularity among Papuan. The awareness of Noken as the identity and pride of the Papuan has gradually revived.\n\nVarious government regulations issued, such as designation of 4 December as Noken Day to celebrate every year and the encouragement by to wear Noken on Thursdays and Fridays for civil servants in Papua initiated by the provincial government. These have revitalised Noken. Mama-mama Papua are weaving and knotting Nokens to meet the demands from the public, civil servants and private institutions. A draft regulation on Noken as official souvenir of Papua replacing Cenderawasih (the birds of paradise) formulated.\n\nSanggar are growing both in rural and capital of the province, namely Jayapura and Manokwari. Every day, mama-mama gather in sanggar for Noken weaving and knotting with a new spirit to create. When asked about the reason, the mama-mama said that the current demands of Noken made of traditional materials are growing, from the public, tourists, and private sectors for various activities such as seminars or meetings. Besides, traditional Noken made of natural materials are also increasingly favored by both foreign and domestic tourists according to souvenir sellers in Jayapura’s Hamadi Market. The sellers mentioned that current selling of Noken made of natural materials are easier than synthetic materials. Tourists who come to the market are more interested in buying the traditional Noken souvenirs than synthetic materials. This is due to a stream of information disseminated by the Noken community and local government, which mentions that the traditional Noken is the one inscribed on the UNESCO ICH List.\n\nVarious safeguarding efforts have been made by stakeholders, such as regulations, the transmission of values and skills by formal and non-formal education through sanggar, craftsperson capacity building, etc. However, despite efforts conducted to safeguard Noken, threats to Noken sustainability still exist.\n\nInternal threats come from the scarcity of Noken natural materials from fibers, bark, sticks, leaves of coastal pandanus trees/screw pines. Another threat is the process of making raw material into ready to weave or knotted yarn, which requires a long and intricate process from raw materials seeking, spinning, and weaving/knotting as one activity that can integrate the community and foster mutual cooperation among mama-mama.\n\nAnother real threat to the living Noken culture is the increasing number of factory-made bags offered in many outlets, especially in the city of Jayapura and Manokwari. The younger generation prefers to use the factory-made bags because they are relatively cheaper than Noken and modern-looking, which is more appealing to them. The fast pace of development and modernization, the influence of modern media, such as television, video, Internet, video games, etc. affects almost all regions of Papua. Interest of the younger generation to cultural heritage, in particular Noken is fading.\n\nB.3.\n\nImplementation of safeguarding measures\n\nPlease report on the safeguarding measures described in the nomination file, and previous report, if any. Describe how they have been implemented and how they have substantially contributed to the safeguarding of the element during the reporting period, taking note of external or internal constraints such as limited resources. Include, in particular, information on the measures taken to ensure the viability of the element by enabling the community to continue to practise and transmit it. Include the following detailed information concerning the implementation of the set of safeguarding measures or safeguarding plan:\n\nB.3.a.\n\nObjectives and results\n\nIndicate what primary objective(s) were addressed and what concrete results were attained during the reporting period.\n\nObjectives and results\n\nThe Noken Nomination file (file nomination point 3.a. paragraph 1) mentions the safeguarding measures made by the provincial and district/municipal governments to safeguard Noken cultural heritage, such as:\n\n- to provide guidance and assistance as incentives to the craftspersons of Noken\n\n- to include Noken as a local content subject\n\n- to find solutions to ensure availability of natural raw materials\n\nSince its inscription on the List, Noken have been revitalised. Printed teaching materials module on Noken have been distributed to various places, but not all areas can be covered and the modules are limited compare to the areas of coverage. Thus, the provincial governments of Papua and West Papua, in this case represented by the Offices of Education and Culture in the two provinces, plan to reprint the modules to meet the demands.\n\nIn 2016, the Offices of Education and Culture of the Province of Papua and the Office of Education of West Papua put Noken in the local content curriculum. In cooperation with the mama-mama in the city of Jayapura, the trainings of teachers who will teach Noken culture have been conducted. This year (2016), trainings of teachers have been conducted in ten (10) junior and senior high schools. The teachers were trained by mama-mama.\n\nBefore Noken inscription on UNESCO ICH list (2012), it was very difficult to find a sanggar in Jayapura city. Noken craftspersons could only be found around Lake Sentani, done by individuals but not by sanggar. The Office of Culture and Tourism of the Province of Papua in 2013 began its support assistance to sanggar in the city of Jayapura. The result is an increasing number of sanggar in Jayapura. The mama-mama originated from various districts/municipalities in the provinces of Papua and West Papua, who live in the city of Jayapura join with the existing sanggar. The joyful spirit of the mama-mama linked closely to the increasing number of people wearing Noken, as well as the increasing orders for Noken to be used as seminar kits or souvenirs from private parties.\n\nData from the Office of Tourism and Creative Economy has shown that the numbers of Noken craftspersons in the sanggar are growing each year:\n\n1. Sanggar Nabua Kabua has 10 craftpersons in 2013. By 2016 the number increased to 68. This sanggar is originated from Wamena Mountain Rangers.\n\n2. Sanggar Iwin Kurudu has 5 craftpersons in 2014, currently the number increased to 82. The craftpersons who joined in the sanggar came from Serui district.\n\n3. Sanggar Anim has 10 craftpersons in 2013. In 2016 this number increased to 37. The craftpersons who joined in the sanggar came from Paniai district.\n\n4. Sanggar Kuin has 7 craftpersons in 2015, but by 2016 this number had increased to 15. The craftpersons who joined in the sanggar came from the Dogiyai district.\n\n5. Sanggar Onomi in Jayapura has 5 craftpersons in 2014, but today the number of craftpersons had increased to 25.\n\nB.3.b.\n\nSafeguarding activities\n\nList the key activities that were carried out during this reporting period in order to achieve these expected results. Please describe the activities in detail and note their effectiveness or any problems encountered in implementing them.\n\nSafeguarding activities\n\nSince Noken inscription on the UNESCO ICH list in 2012, various activities have been carried out by both government and community. Within the reporting period of 2012-2016, various activities have been carried out to maintain sustainability of Noken. These activities refer to the action plan that has been submitted in the Noken Nomination Form, as follows:\n\nA. Inventory of Noken Cultural Heritage\n\nInventory of Noken Cultural Heritage needs to be done to enrich information about Noken in seven customary areas in both provinces of Papua and West Papua. Accurate information related to various activities associated with Noken is important to be used as a database for further Noken safeguarding activities. Inventory shall be carried out gradually and periodically given the vastness of the areas of Papua and West Papua. Noken communities can also be empowered and trained to participate in the collection of data concerning their own cultural heritage. In July 2016, the inventory activity has been carried out by the Office of Education and Culture of the province of Papua, and the Office of Education and Culture of the province of West Papua.\n\nB. Formulating Teaching Materials on Noken, by books, interactive CD/DVD and posters\n\nOne of the media to transmit knowledge concerning cultural values, meanings, and functions and how to make Noken is through the book of teaching materials. In June 2013, the Ministry of Education and Culture in collaboration with Noken communities has published a Module on for early childhood education, junior, and high school/vocational schools.\n\nA book about Noken once was published by Lembaga Ekologi Papua (Papua Ecological Institute) in 2011. The book examines a wide range of information about Noken as a Cultural Heritage of the people of Papua. The Book entitled \"Noken Cermin Papua\" is about Noken as a culture that is closely attached to the Papuans. In addition to publishing the book, in 2015, Lembaga Ekologi Papua also published Noken Calendar.\n\nC. Inclusion of Noken in school curricula as Local Content\n\nThis year, 2016, Noken have been used in formal education as the local content in Papua province. The Office of Education and Culture is currently working on the Papua Special Autonomy Fund partly used for the safeguarding of culture, especially for Noken. With this fund Noken galleries will be built in 5 customary land areas of the Papuans. The pilot project is in Mepago customary land area in Nabire district. These Noken galleries constructions are expected to be in line with the inclusion of Noken into local content.\n\nTraditionally, in the transmission process of Noken parents introduced it to children when a mother carrying her baby with Noken. When the child is able to walk, mama-mama put Noken on her daughters or sons, both man and woman. Nowadays, the tradition especially in urban areas has begun to fade. Thus, efforts to introduce Noken through local content in a curriculum is necessary for the younger generation who are not familiar with the tradition. Some of the students said that they knew Noken from school. Cultural transmission through formal education thus play a huge role in accelerating the process of Noken cultural transmission.\n\nD. Noken Trainings in Sanggar (Pilot Projects)\n\nSanggar are the vanguard of Noken safeguard efforts and keep Noken from diminishing. One of the protection efforts mentioned on the Noken nomination file is to start providing guidance and assistance to the craftperson of Noken. The assistance shall be given through the sanggar. There are several small sanggar in West Sentani, Epouto (Paniai), Biak, Wamena, Mokwam (nomination file point 2 paragraph 2). The sanggar in various areas become the strategic points in revitalisation of Noken that was previously endangered.\n\nIn the city of Jayapura, the number of sanggar is growing rapidly. The mama-mama coming from various regions and currently live in the city of Jayapura have established sanggar. Currently the number of crafterperson in the sanggar increasing by the day (see B3.a). In May 2016, the Ministry of Industry in collaboration with the Office of Industry and Trade of Papua province held a technical capacity building training for the Papuan craftpersons. Moreover, in the same year, the Agency of Creative Economy in cooperation with the Office of Tourism and Creative Economy of Papua province organized product innovation and Noken making trainings as handcraft from Papua.\n\nE. Revitalization of Noken Culture in Society (in cooperation with Customary Institutions of Papua)\n\nCustomary Institutions in Papua society still hold a strategic role in the cultural safeguarding efforts. Noken culture safeguarding efforts become more effective if supported by traditional/customary institutions. In Jayapura, there are at least 14 sanggar that affiliated with the traditional/customary institutions in their areas of origin. For example, Sanggar Iwin Karudu where the craftspersons was originated from Serui district.\n\nRegional Customary Council of Hubula in Wamena district gave considerable attention to the development of Noken in Papua. Through this traditional institution, Papuans originating from Wamena staying in Jayapura can keep good relations with crafters of Noken in the district of Wamena. Often the raw materials are sent from the Wamena mountain ranges, given the raw materials are hard to find in the city of Jayapura. This is where the traditional/customary institutions play their role in reviving the Noken culture.\n\nF. Promotion of Noken as a cultural work by local governments through exhibitions, festivals and others\n\nRegional governments, both in the provinces of Papua and West Papua have been actively promoting Noken through exhibitions, festivals, and so forth. The Office of Tourism and Creative Economy and the Office of Industry and Trade provide assistance to the craftperson by showcasing their Noken crafts in a variety of activities, both in Papua or in various regions throughout Indonesia, even abroad.\n\nB.3.c.\n\nParticipation of communities, groups or individuals in the safeguarding activities\n\nDescribe how communities, groups or, if appropriate, individuals as well as relevant non-governmental organizations have effectively participated, including in terms of gender roles, in the safeguarding measures. Describe the role of the implementing organization or body (name, background, etc.) and the human resources that were available for implementing safeguarding activities.\n\nParticipation of communities, groups or individuals in the safeguarding activities\n\nIndividuals, groups, communities, academicians, Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) has a great contribution to the safeguard efforts of Noken.

Today, these sanggar are often found in the cities of Jayapura and Manokwari, customary communities established the sanggar to provide facilities for mama-mama to create Noken.
