        "meta_description": "Abstract. Increasing temperatures due to global warming will influence\nbuilding, heating, and cooling practices. Therefore, this data set aims to\nprovide formatted and adapted meteorological data for specific users who\nwork in building design, architecture, building energy management\nsystems, modelling renewable energy conversion systems, or others\ninterested in this kind of projected weather data. These meteorological data\nare produced from the regional climate model MAR (ModÃ¨le\nAtmosphÃ©rique RÃ©gional in French) simulations. This regional model,\nadapted and validated over Belgium, is forced firstly, by the ERA5 reanalysis,\nwhich represents the closest climate to reality and secondly, by three Earth system models (ESMs) from\nthe Sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project database, namely,\nBCC-CSM2-MR, MPI-ESM.1.2, and MIROC6. The main advantage of using the MAR\nmodel is that the generated weather data have a high resolution (hourly data\nand 5âkm) and are spatially and temporally homogeneous. The generated weather\ndata follow two protocols. On the one hand, the Typical Meteorological Year\n(TMY) and eXtreme Meteorological Year (XMY) files are generated largely\ninspired by the method proposed by the standard ISO15927-4, allowing the\nreconstruction of typical and extreme years, while keeping a plausible\nvariability of the meteorological data. On the other hand, the heatwave\nevent (HWE) meteorological data are generated according to a method used to\ndetect the heatwave events and to classify them according to three criteria\nof the heatwave (the most intense, the longest duration, and the highest\ntemperature). All generated weather data are freely available on the open\nonline repository Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5606983,\nDoutreloup and Fettweis, 2021) and these data are produced within\nthe framework of the research project OCCuPANt\n(https://www.occupant.uliege.be/ (last access: 24Â JuneÂ 2022)âââââââ â ULiÃ¨ge).",

In addition to reducing global warming, these solar geoengineering measures also dampen the well-known positive melt–albedo feedback over the ice sheet by 6 %. However, only stronger reductions in solar radiation could maintain a stable ice sheet in 2100.\n\nDiverging future surface mass balance between the Antarctic ice shelves and grounded ice sheet\n\nChristoph Kittel, Charles Amory, CÃ©cile Agosta, Nicolas C. Jourdain, Stefan Hofer, Alison Delhasse, SÃ©bastien Doutreloup, Pierre-Vincent Huot, Charlotte Lang, Thierry Fichefet, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 1215–1236, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1215-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1215-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe future surface mass balance (SMB) of the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) will influence the ice dynamics and the contribution of the ice sheet to the sea level rise. We investigate the AIS sensitivity to different warmings using physical and statistical downscaling of CMIP5 and CMIP6 models. Our results highlight a contrasting effect between the grounded ice sheet (where the SMB is projected to increase) and ice shelves (where the future SMB depends on the emission scenario).\n\nSensitivity of the current Antarctic surface mass balance to sea surface conditions using MAR\n\nChristoph Kittel, Charles Amory, CÃ©cile Agosta, Alison Delhasse, SÃ©bastien Doutreloup, Pierre-Vincent Huot, Coraline Wyard, Thierry Fichefet, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 3827–3839, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3827-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3827-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRegional climate models (RCMs) used to estimate the surface mass balance (SMB) of Antarctica depend on boundary forcing fields including sea surface conditions. Here, we assess the sensitivity of the Antarctic SMB to perturbations in sea surface conditions with the RCM MAR using unchanged atmospheric conditions. Significant SMB anomalies are found for SSC perturbations in the range of CMIP5 global climate model biases.\n\nModelling snowpack on ice surfaces with the ORCHIDEE land surface model: Application to the Greenland ice sheet\n\nSylvie Charbit, Christophe Dumas, Fabienne Maignan, Catherine OttlÃ©, Nina Raoult, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-285,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-285, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe evolution of the Greenland ice sheet is highly dependent on surface melting and therefore on the processes operating at the snow-atmosphere interface and within the snow cover. Here we present new developments to apply a snow model to the Greenland ice sheet. The performance of this model is analysed in terms of its ability to simulate ablation processes. Our analysis shows that the model performs well when compared with the MAR regional polar atmospheric model.\n\nCoupling MAR (ModÃ¨le AtmosphÃ©rique RÃ©gional) with PISM (Parallel Ice Sheet Model) mitigates the positive meltâelevation feedback\n\nAlison Delhasse, Johanna Beckmann, Christoph Kittel, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 633–651, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-633-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-633-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAiming to study the long-term influence of an extremely warm climate in the Greenland Ice Sheet contribution to sea level rise, a new regional atmosphere–ice sheet model setup was established. The coupling, explicitly considering the melt–elevation feedback, is compared to an offline method to consider this feedback. We highlight mitigation of the feedback due to local changes in atmospheric circulation with changes in surface topography, making the offline correction invalid on the margins.\n\nRecent warming trends of the Greenland ice sheet documented by historical firn and ice temperature observations and machine learning\n\nBaptiste Vandecrux, Robert S.

Smeets, Peter Kuipers Munneke, Michiel R. van den Broeke, Max Brils, Peter L. Langen, Ruth Mottram, and Andreas P. AhlstrÃ¸m\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 609–631, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-609-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-609-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHow fast is the Greenland ice sheet warming? In this study, we compiled 4500+ temperature measurements at 10 m below the ice sheet surface (T10m) from 1912 to 2022. We trained a machine learning model on these data and reconstructed T10m for the ice sheet during 1950–2022. After a slight cooling during 1950–1985, the ice sheet warmed at a rate of 0.7 °C per decade until 2022. Climate models showed mixed results compared to our observations and underestimated the warming in key regions.\n\nCloud- and ice-albedo feedbacks drive greater Greenland Ice Sheet sensitivity to warming in CMIP6 than in CMIP5\n\nIdunn Aamnes Mostue, Stefan Hofer, Trude Storelvmo, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 475–488, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-475-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-475-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe latest generation of climate models (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 – CMIP6) warm more over Greenland and the Arctic and thus also project a larger mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) compared to the previous generation of climate models (CMIP5). Our work suggests for the first time that part of the greater mass loss in CMIP6 over the GrIS is driven by a difference in the surface mass balance sensitivity from a change in cloud representation in the CMIP6 models.\n\nOn the importance of the humidity flux for the surface mass balance in the accumulation zone of the Greenland Ice Sheet\n\nLaura J. Dietrich, Hans Christian Steen-Larsen, Sonja Wahl, Anne-Katrine Faber, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 289–305, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-289-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-289-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe contribution of the humidity flux to the surface mass balance in the accumulation zone of the Greenland Ice Sheet is uncertain. Here, we evaluate the regional climate model MAR using a multi-annual dataset of eddy covariance measurements and bulk estimates of the humidity flux. The humidity flux largely contributes to the summer surface mass balance (SMB) in the accumulation zone, indicating its potential importance for the annual SMB in a warming climate.\n\nA computationally efficient statistically downscaled 100 m resolution Greenland product from the regional climate model MAR\n\nMarco Tedesco, Paolo Colosio, Xavier Fettweis, and Guido Cervone\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 5061–5074, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5061-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5061-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe developed a technique to improve the outputs of a model that calculates the gain and loss of Greenland and consequently its contribution to sea level rise. Our technique generates “sharper” images of the maps generated by the model to better understand and quantify where losses occur. This has implications for improving models, understanding what drives the contributions of Greenland to sea level rise, and more.\n\nSpatially heterogeneous effect of climate warming on the Arctic land ice\n\nDamien Maure, Christoph Kittel, Clara Lambin, Alison Delhasse, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4645–4659, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4645-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4645-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Arctic is warming faster than the rest of the Earth. Studies have already shown that Greenland and the Canadian Arctic are experiencing a record increase in melting rates, while Svalbard has been relatively less impacted. Looking at those regions but also extending the study to Iceland and the Russian Arctic archipelagoes, we see a heterogeneity in the melting-rate response to the Arctic warming, with the Russian archipelagoes experiencing lower melting rates than other regions.\n\nA new model for supraglacial hydrology evolution and drainage for the Greenland Ice Sheet (SHED v1.0)\n\nPrateek Gantayat, Alison F. Banwell, Amber A. Leeson, James M. Lea, Dorthe Petersen, Noel Gourmelen, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 5803–5823, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-5803-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-5803-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe developed a new supraglacial hydrology model for the Greenland Ice Sheet. This model simulates surface meltwater routing, meltwater drainage, supraglacial lake (SGL) overflow, and formation of lake ice. The model was able to reproduce 80 % of observed lake locations and provides a good match between the observed and modelled temporal evolution of SGLs.\n\nSensitivity of the MAR regional climate model snowpack to the parameterization of the assimilation of satellite-derived wet-snow masks on the Antarctic Peninsula\n\nThomas Dethinne, Quentin Glaude, Ghislain Picard, Christoph Kittel, Patrick Alexander, Anne Orban, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4267–4288, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4267-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4267-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate the sensitivity of the regional climate model Modèle Atmosphérique Régional (MAR) to the assimilation of wet-snow occurrence estimated by remote sensing datasets. The assimilation is performed by nudging the MAR snowpack temperature. The data assimilation is performed over the Antarctic Peninsula for the 2019–2021 period. The results show an increase in the melt production (+66.7 %) and a decrease in surface mass balance (−4.5 %) of the model for the 2019–2020 melt season.\n\nMass balance of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets from 1992 to 2020\n\nInÃ¨s N.

Sutterley, Bramha Dutt Vishwakarma, Jan Melchior van Wessem, David Wiese, Wouter van der Wal, and Bert Wouters\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 15, 1597–1616, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-1597-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-1597-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBy measuring changes in the volume, gravitational attraction, and ice flow of Greenland and Antarctica from space, we can monitor their mass gain and loss over time. Here, we present a new record of the Earthâs polar ice sheet mass balance produced by aggregating 50 satellite-based estimates of ice sheet mass change. This new assessment shows that the ice sheets have lost (7.5 x 1012) t of ice between 1992 and 2020, contributing 21 mm to sea level rise.\n\nEvaluating Greenland surface-mass-balance and firn-densification data using ICESat-2 altimetry\n\nBenjamin E. Smith, Brooke Medley, Xavier Fettweis, Tyler Sutterley, Patrick Alexander, David Porter, and Marco Tedesco\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 789–808, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-789-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-789-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use repeated satellite measurements of the height of the Greenland ice sheet to learn about how three computational models of snowfall, melt, and snow compaction represent actual changes in the ice sheet. We find that the models do a good job of estimating how the parts of the ice sheet near the coast have changed but that two of the models have trouble representing surface melt for the highest part of the ice sheet. This work provides suggestions for how to better model snowmelt.\n\nSnow stratigraphy observations from Operation IceBridge surveys in Alaska using S and C band airborne ultra-wideband FMCW (frequency-modulated continuous wave) radar\n\nJilu Li, Fernando Rodriguez-Morales, Xavier Fettweis, Oluwanisola Ibikunle, Carl Leuschen, John Paden, Daniel Gomez-Garcia, and Emily Arnold\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 175–193, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-175-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-175-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAlaskan glaciers' loss of ice mass contributes significantly to ocean surface rise. It is important to know how deeply and how much snow accumulates on these glaciers to comprehend and analyze the glacial mass loss process. We reported the observed seasonal snow depth distribution from our radar data taken in Alaska in 2018 and 2021, developed a method to estimate the annual snow accumulation rate at Mt. Wrangell caldera, and identified transition zones from wet-snow zones to ablation zones.\n\nAssessing bare-ice albedo simulated by MAR over the Greenland ice sheet (2000â2021) and implications for meltwater production estimates\n\nRaf M. Antwerpen, Marco Tedesco, Xavier Fettweis, Patrick Alexander, and Willem Jan van de Berg\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 4185–4199, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4185-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4185-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe ice on Greenland has been melting more rapidly over the last few years. Most of this melt comes from the exposure of ice when the overlying snow melts. This ice is darker than snow and absorbs more sunlight, leading to more melt. It remains challenging to accurately simulate the brightness of the ice. We show that the color of ice simulated by ModÃ¨le AtmosphÃ©rique RÃ©gional (MAR) is too bright. We then show that this means that MAR may underestimate how fast the Greenland ice is melting.\n\nClouds drive differences in future surface melt over the Antarctic ice shelves\n\nChristoph Kittel, Charles Amory, Stefan Hofer, CÃ©cile Agosta, Nicolas C. Jourdain, Ella Gilbert, Louis Le Toumelin, Ãtienne Vignon, Hubert GallÃ©e, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 2655–2669, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2655-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2655-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nModel projections suggest large differences in future Antarctic surface melting even for similar greenhouse gas scenarios and warming rates. We show that clouds containing a larger amount of liquid water lead to stronger melt. As surface melt can trigger the collapse of the ice shelves (the safety band of the Antarctic Ice Sheet), clouds could be a major source of uncertainties in projections of sea level rise.\n\nGreenland ice sheet mass balance from 1840 through next week\n\nKenneth D. Mankoff, Xavier Fettweis, Peter L. Langen, Martin Stendel, Kristian K. Kjeldsen, Nanna B. Karlsson, Brice NoÃ«l, Michiel R. van den Broeke, Anne Solgaard, William Colgan, Jason E. Box, Sebastian B. Simonsen, Michalea D. King, Andreas P. AhlstrÃ¸m, Signe Bech Andersen, and Robert S. Fausto\n\nEarth Syst. Sci.

Our time series begins in 1840 and has annual resolution through 1985 and then daily from 1986 through next week. Results are operational (updated daily) and provided for the entire ice sheet or by commonly used regions or sectors. This is the first input–output mass balance estimate to include the basal mass balance.\n\nWhat is the surface mass balance of Antarctica? An intercomparison of regional climate model estimates\n\nRuth Mottram, Nicolaj Hansen, Christoph Kittel, J. Melchior van Wessem, CÃ©cile Agosta, Charles Amory, Fredrik Boberg, Willem Jan van de Berg, Xavier Fettweis, Alexandra Gossart, Nicole P. M. van Lipzig, Erik van Meijgaard, Andrew Orr, Tony Phillips, Stuart Webster, Sebastian B. Simonsen, and Niels Souverijns\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 3751–3784, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3751-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3751-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe compare the calculated surface mass budget (SMB) of Antarctica in five different regional climate models. On average ~ 2000 Gt of snow accumulates annually, but different models vary by ~ 10 %, a difference equivalent to Â± 0.5 mm of global sea level rise. All models reproduce observed weather, but there are large differences in regional patterns of snowfall, especially in areas with very few observations, giving greater uncertainty in Antarctic mass budget than previously identified.\n\nSensitivity of the surface energy budget to drifting snow as simulated by MAR in coastal Adelie Land, Antarctica\n\nLouis Le Toumelin, Charles Amory, Vincent Favier, Christoph Kittel, Stefan Hofer, Xavier Fettweis, Hubert GallÃ©e, and Vinay Kayetha\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 3595–3614, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3595-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3595-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSnow is frequently eroded from the surface by the wind in Adelie Land (Antarctica) and suspended in the lower atmosphere. By performing model simulations, we show firstly that suspended snow layers interact with incoming radiation similarly to a near-surface cloud. Secondly, suspended snow modifies the atmosphere's thermodynamic structure and energy exchanges with the surface. Our results suggest snow transport by the wind should be taken into account in future model studies over the region.\n\nBrief communication: Reduction in the future Greenland ice sheet surface melt with the help of solar geoengineering\n\nXavier Fettweis, Stefan Hofer, Roland SÃ©fÃ©rian, Charles Amory, Alison Delhasse, SÃ©bastien Doutreloup, Christoph Kittel, Charlotte Lang, Joris Van Bever, Florent Veillon, and Peter Irvine\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 3013–3019, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3013-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3013-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWithout any reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions, the Greenland ice sheet surface mass loss can be brought in line with a medium-mitigation emissions scenario by reducing the solar downward flux at the top of the atmosphere by 1.5 %. In addition to reducing global warming, these solar geoengineering measures also dampen the well-known positive melt–albedo feedback over the ice sheet by 6 %. However, only stronger reductions in solar radiation could maintain a stable ice sheet in 2100.\n\nSurface melting over the Greenland ice sheet derived from enhanced resolution passive microwave brightness temperatures (1979â2019)\n\nPaolo Colosio, Marco Tedesco, Roberto Ranzi, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 2623–2646, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-2623-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-2623-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use a new satellite dataset to study the spatiotemporal evolution of surface melting over Greenland at an enhanced resolution of 3.125 km. Using meteorological data and the MAR model, we observe that a dynamic algorithm can best detect surface melting. We found that the melting season is elongating, the melt extent is increasing and that high-resolution data better describe the spatiotemporal evolution of the melting season, which is crucial to improve estimates of sea level rise.\n\nPerformance of MAR (v3.11) in simulating the drifting-snow climate and surface mass balance of AdÃ©lie Land, East Antarctica\n\nCharles Amory, Christoph Kittel, Louis Le Toumelin, CÃ©cile Agosta, Alison Delhasse, Vincent Favier, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 3487–3510, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-3487-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-3487-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents recent developments in the drifting-snow scheme of the regional climate model MAR and its application to simulate drifting snow and the surface mass balance of AdÃ©lie Land in East Antarctica. The model is extensively described and evaluated against a multi-year drifting-snow dataset and surface mass balance estimates available in the area. The model sensitivity to input parameters and improvements over a previously published version are also assessed.\n\nDiverging future surface mass balance between the Antarctic ice shelves and grounded ice sheet\n\nChristoph Kittel, Charles Amory, CÃ©cile Agosta, Nicolas C. Jourdain, Stefan Hofer, Alison Delhasse, SÃ©bastien Doutreloup, Pierre-Vincent Huot, Charlotte Lang, Thierry Fichefet, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 1215–1236, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1215-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1215-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe future surface mass balance (SMB) of the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) will influence the ice dynamics and the contribution of the ice sheet to the sea level rise. We investigate the AIS sensitivity to different warmings using physical and statistical downscaling of CMIP5 and CMIP6 models. Our results highlight a contrasting effect between the grounded ice sheet (where the SMB is projected to increase) and ice shelves (where the future SMB depends on the emission scenario).\n\nContrasting seasonal changes in total and intense precipitation in the European Alps fromÂ 1903 toÂ 2010\n\nMartin MÃ©nÃ©goz, Evgenia Valla, Nicolas C. Jourdain, Juliette Blanchet, Julien Beaumet, Bruno Wilhelm, Hubert GallÃ©e, Xavier Fettweis, Samuel Morin, and Sandrine Anquetin\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 5355–5377, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-5355-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-5355-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe study investigates precipitation changes in the Alps, using observations and a 7 km resolution climate simulation over 1900–2010. An increase in mean precipitation is found in winter over the Alps, whereas a drying occurred in summer in the surrounding plains. A general increase in the daily annual maximum of precipitation is evidenced (20 to 40 % per century), suggesting an increase in extreme events that is significant only when considering long time series, typically 50 to 80 years.\n\nGreenland liquid water discharge from 1958 through 2019\n\nKenneth D. Mankoff, Brice NoÃ«l, Xavier Fettweis, Andreas P. AhlstrÃ¸m, William Colgan, Ken Kondo, Kirsty Langley, Shin Sugiyama, Dirk van As, and Robert S. Fausto\n\nEarth Syst. Sci.

Temporal resolution is daily from 1959 through 2019. Spatial grid is ~ 100 m, resolving individual streams. In addition to discharge at outlets, we also provide the streams, outlets, and basin geospatial data, as well as a script to query and access the geospatial or time series discharge data from the data files.\n\nGrSMBMIP: intercomparison of the modelled 1980â2012 surface mass balance over the Greenland Ice Sheet\n\nXavier Fettweis, Stefan Hofer, Uta Krebs-Kanzow, Charles Amory, Teruo Aoki, Constantijn J.

W. van de Wal, Leo van Kampenhout, David Wilton, Bert Wouters, Florian Ziemen, and Tobias Zolles\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 3935–3958, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3935-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3935-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe evaluated simulated Greenland Ice Sheet surface mass balance from 5 kinds of models. While the most complex (but expensive to compute) models remain the best, the faster/simpler models also compare reliably with observations and have biases of the same order as the regional models. Discrepancies in the trend over 2000–2012, however, suggest that large uncertainties remain in the modelled future SMB changes as they are highly impacted by the meltwater runoff biases over the current climate.\n\nIntercomparison of surface meltwater routing models for the Greenland ice sheet and influence on subglacial effective pressures\n\nKang Yang, Aleah Sommers, Lauren C. Andrews, Laurence C. Smith, Xin Lu, Xavier Fettweis, and Manchun Li\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 3349–3365, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3349-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3349-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study compares hourly supraglacial moulin discharge simulations from three surface meltwater routing models. Results show that these models are superior to simply using regional climate model runoff without routing, but different routing models, different-spatial-resolution DEMs, and parameterized seasonal evolution of supraglacial stream and river networks induce significant variability in diurnal moulin discharges and corresponding subglacial effective pressures.\n\nThe future sea-level contribution of the Greenland ice sheet: a multi-model ensemble study of ISMIP6\n\nHeiko Goelzer, Sophie Nowicki, Anthony Payne, Eric Larour, Helene Seroussi, William H.

The results for two different greenhouse gas concentration scenarios indicate that the Greenland ice sheet will continue to lose mass until 2100, with contributions to sea-level rise of 90 Â± 50 mm and 32 Â± 17 mm for the high (RCP8.5) and low (RCP2.6) scenario, respectively.\n\nQuantifying spatiotemporal variability of glacier algal blooms and the impact on surface albedo in southwestern Greenland\n\nShujie Wang, Marco Tedesco, Patrick Alexander, Min Xu, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 2687–2713, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2687-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2687-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGlacial algal blooms play a significant role in darkening the Greenland Ice Sheet during summertime. The dark pigments generated by glacial algae could substantially reduce the bare ice albedo and thereby enhance surface melt. We used satellite data to map the spatial distribution of glacial algae and characterized the seasonal growth pattern and interannual trends of glacial algae in southwestern Greenland. Our study is important for bridging microbial activities with ice sheet mass balance.\n\nExperimental protocol for sea level projections from ISMIP6 stand-alone ice sheet models\n\nSophie Nowicki, Heiko Goelzer, HÃ©lÃ¨ne Seroussi, Anthony J.

The ISMIP6 framework allows for exploring the uncertainty in 21st century sea level change from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets.\n\nRemapping of Greenland ice sheet surface mass balance anomalies for large ensemble sea-level change projections\n\nHeiko Goelzer, Brice P. Y. NoÃ«l, Tamsin L. Edwards, Xavier Fettweis, Jonathan M. Gregory, William H. Lipscomb, Roderik S. W. van de Wal, and Michiel R. van den Broeke\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 1747–1762, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1747-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1747-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFuture sea-level change projections with process-based ice sheet models are typically driven with surface mass balance forcing derived from climate models. In this work we address the problems arising from a mismatch of the modelled ice sheet geometry with the one used by the climate model. The proposed remapping method reproduces the original forcing data closely when applied to the original geometry and produces a physically meaningful forcing when applied to different modelled geometries.\n\nUnprecedented atmospheric conditions (1948â2019) drive the 2019 exceptional melting season over the Greenland ice sheet\n\nMarco Tedesco and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 1209–1223, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1209-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1209-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUnprecedented atmospheric conditions occurring in the summer of 2019 over Greenland promoted new record or close-to-record values of mass loss. Summer of 2019 was characterized by an exceptional persistence of anticyclonic conditions that enhanced melting.\n\nTwenty-first century ocean forcing of the Greenland ice sheet for modelling of sea level contribution\n\nDonald A. Slater, Denis Felikson, Fiamma Straneo, Heiko Goelzer, Christopher M. Little, Mathieu Morlighem, Xavier Fettweis, and Sophie Nowicki\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 985–1008, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-985-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-985-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nChanges in the ocean around Greenland play an important role in determining how much the ice sheet will contribute to global sea level over the coming century. However, capturing these links in models is very challenging. This paper presents a strategy enabling an ensemble of ice sheet models to feel the effect of the ocean for the first time and should therefore result in a significant improvement in projections of the Greenland ice sheet's contribution to future sea level change.\n\nBrief communication: Evaluation of the near-surface climate in ERA5 over the Greenland Ice Sheet\n\nAlison Delhasse, Christoph Kittel, Charles Amory, Stefan Hofer, Dirk van As, Robert S.

The aim was to evaluate the performance of ERA5 to simulate the near-surface climate of the Greenland Ice sheet (GrIS) against ERA-Interim and regional climate models with the help of in situ observations from the PROMICE dataset. We also highlighted that polar regional climate models are still a useful tool to study the GrIS climate compared to ERA5.\n\nBrief communication: CMIP6 does not suggest any circulation change over Greenland in summer by 2100\n\nAlison Delhasse, Edward Hanna, Christoph Kittel, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2019-332,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2019-332, 2020\n\nPreprint withdrawn\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSignificant melting events over Greenland ice sheet related to unusual atmospheric pattern in summer, as observed this summer 2019, are still not considered by the new generation of Earth-system models (CMIP6) and therefore the projected surface melt increase of the ice sheet is likely to be underestimated if such changes persist in the next decades.\n\nInterannual variability of summer surface mass balance and surface melting in the Amundsen sector, West Antarctica\n\nMarion Donat-Magnin, Nicolas C. Jourdain, Hubert GallÃ©e, Charles Amory, Christoph Kittel, Xavier Fettweis, Jonathan D. Wille, Vincent Favier, Amine Drira, and CÃ©cile Agosta\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 229–249, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-229-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-229-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nModeling the interannual variability of the surface conditions over Antarctic glaciers is important for the identification of climate trends and climate predictions and to assess models. We simulate snow accumulation and surface melting in the Amundsen sector (West Antarctica) over 1979–2017. For all the glaciers, the interannual variability of summer snow accumulation and surface melting is driven by two distinct mechanisms related to variations in the Amundsen Sea Low strength and position.\n\nEstimating Greenland tidewater glacier retreat driven by submarine melting\n\nDonald A. Slater, Fiamma Straneo, Denis Felikson, Christopher M. Little, Heiko Goelzer, Xavier Fettweis, and James Holte\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 2489–2509, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-2489-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-2489-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe ocean's influence on the retreat of Greenland's tidewater glaciers is a key factor determining future sea level. By considering observations of ~200 glaciers from 1960, we find a significant relationship between retreat and melting in the ocean. Projected forwards, this relationship estimates the future evolution of Greenland's tidewater glaciers and provides a practical and empirically validated way of representing ice–ocean interaction in large-scale models used to estimate sea level rise.\n\nGreenland Ice Sheet late-season melt: investigating multiscale drivers of K-transect events\n\nThomas J.

Through analyses of weather station, climate model, and reanalysis data, physical links are evaluated between Baffin Bay open water duration and western GrIS melt conditions. We show that sub-Arctic air mass movement across this portion of the GrIS strongly influences late summer and autumn melt, while near-surface, off-ice winds inhibit westerly atmospheric heat transfer from Baffin Bay.\n\nAssessment of the Greenland ice sheetâatmosphere feedbacks for the next century with a regional atmospheric model coupled to an ice sheet model\n\nSÃ©bastien Le clec'h, Sylvie Charbit, AurÃ©lien Quiquet, Xavier Fettweis, Christophe Dumas, Masa Kageyama, Coraline Wyard, and Catherine Ritz\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 373–395, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-373-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-373-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nQuantifying the future contribution of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) to sea-level rise in response to atmospheric changes is important but remains challenging. For the first time a full representation of the feedbacks between a GrIS model and a regional atmospheric model was implemented. The authors highlight the fundamental need for representing the GrIS topography change feedbacks with respect to the atmospheric component face to the strong impact on the projected sea-level rise.\n\nEstimation of the Antarctic surface mass balance using the regional climate model MAR (1979â2015) and identification of dominant processes\n\nCÃ©cile Agosta, Charles Amory, Christoph Kittel, Anais Orsi, Vincent Favier, Hubert GallÃ©e, Michiel R. van den Broeke, Jan T. M. Lenaerts, Jan Melchior van Wessem, Willem Jan van de Berg, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 281–296, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-281-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-281-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAntarctic surface mass balance (ASMB), a component of the sea level budget, is commonly estimated through modelling as observations are scarce. The polar-oriented regional climate model MAR performs well in simulating the observed ASMB. MAR and RACMO2 share common biases we relate to drifting snow transport, with a 3 times larger magnitude than in previous estimates. Sublimation of precipitation in the katabatic layer modelled by MAR is of a magnitude similar to an observation-based estimate.\n\nSensitivity of the current Antarctic surface mass balance to sea surface conditions using MAR\n\nChristoph Kittel, Charles Amory, CÃ©cile Agosta, Alison Delhasse, SÃ©bastien Doutreloup, Pierre-Vincent Huot, Coraline Wyard, Thierry Fichefet, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 3827–3839, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3827-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3827-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRegional climate models (RCMs) used to estimate the surface mass balance (SMB) of Antarctica depend on boundary forcing fields including sea surface conditions. Here, we assess the sensitivity of the Antarctic SMB to perturbations in sea surface conditions with the RCM MAR using unchanged atmospheric conditions. Significant SMB anomalies are found for SSC perturbations in the range of CMIP5 global climate model biases.\n\nBrief communication: Impact of the recent atmospheric circulation change in summer on the future surface mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet\n\nAlison Delhasse, Xavier Fettweis, Christoph Kittel, Charles Amory, and CÃ©cile Agosta\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 3409–3418, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3409-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3409-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSince the 2000s, an atmospheric circulation change (CC) gauged by a negative summer shift in the North Atlantic Oscillation has been observed, enhancing surface melt over the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS). Future GrIS surface mass balance (SMB) projections are based on global climate models that do not represent this CC. The modelÂ MARÂ has been used to show that previous estimates of these projections could have been significantly overestimated if this current circulation pattern persists.\n\nBrief communication: Recent changes in summer Greenland blocking captured by none of the CMIP5 models\n\nEdward Hanna, Xavier Fettweis, and Richard J. Hall\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 3287–3292, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3287-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3287-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe latest/recent generations of global climate models do not simulate the recent (last 30 years) increase in atmospheric high pressure over Greenland in summer but rather projects decreasing pressure. This difference between climate models and observations raises serious questions about the ability of the models to accurately represent future changes in Greenland climate and ice-sheet mass balance. There are also likely effects on climate predictions downstream, e.g. over Europe.\n\nSeasonal mass variations show timing and magnitude of meltwater storage in the Greenland Ice Sheet\n\nJiangjun Ran, Miren Vizcaino, Pavel Ditmar, Michiel R. van den Broeke, Twila Moon, Christian R. Steger, Ellyn M. Enderlin, Bert Wouters, Brice NoÃ«l, Catharina H. Reijmer, Roland Klees, Min Zhong, Lin Liu, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 2981–2999, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-2981-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-2981-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo accurately predict future sea level rise, the mechanisms driving the observed mass loss must be better understood. Here, we combine data from the satellite gravimetry, surface mass balance, and ice discharge to analyze the mass budget of Greenland at various temporal scales. This study, for the first time, suggests the existence of a substantial meltwater storage during summer, with a peak value of 80–120 Gt in July. We highlight its importance for understanding ice sheet mass variability\n\nMelting over the northeast Antarctic Peninsula (1999â2009): evaluation of a high-resolution regional climate model\n\nRajashree Tri Datta, Marco Tedesco, Cecile Agosta, Xavier Fettweis, Peter Kuipers Munneke, and Michiel R. van den Broeke\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 2901–2922, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-2901-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-2901-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSurface melting on the East Antarctic Peninsula (East AP) has been linked to ice shelf collapse, including the Larsen A (1995) and Larsen B (2002) ice shelves. Regional climate models (RCMs) are a valuable tool to understand how wind patterns and general warming can impact the stability of ice shelves through surface melt. Here, we evaluate one such RCM (ModÃ¨le AtmosphÃ©rique RÃ©gionale) over the East AP, including the remaining Larsen C ice shelf, by comparing it to satellite and ground data.\n\nSeasonal monitoring of melt and accumulation within the deep percolation zone of the Greenland Ice Sheet and comparison with simulations of regional climate modeling\n\nAchim Heilig, Olaf Eisen, Michael MacFerrin, Marco Tedesco, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 1851–1866, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-1851-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-1851-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents data on temporal changes in snow and firn, which were not available before. We present data on water infiltration in the percolation zone of the Greenland Ice Sheet that improve our understanding of liquid water retention in snow and firn and mass transfer. We compare those findings with model simulations. It appears that simulated accumulation in terms of SWE is fairly accurate, while modeling of the individual parameters density and liquid water content is incorrect.\n\nExtreme temperature events on Greenland in observations and the MAR regional climate model\n\nAmber A. Leeson, Emma Eastoe, and Xavier Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 1091–1102, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-1091-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-1091-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFuture melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet is predicted using regional climate models (RCMs). Here, we assess the ability of the MAR RCM to reproduce observed extreme temperature events and the melt energy produced during these times at 14 locations. We find that MAR underestimates temperatures by >0.5 °C during extreme events, which leads to an underestimate in melt energy by up to 41 %. This is potentially an artefact of the data used to drive the MAR simulation and needs to be corrected for.\n\nDark ice dynamics of the south-west Greenland Ice Sheet\n\nAndrew J. Tedstone, Jonathan L. Bamber, Joseph M. Cook, Christopher J. Williamson, Xavier Fettweis, Andrew J. Hodson, and Martyn Tranter\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 2491–2506, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2491-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2491-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe bare ice albedo of the south-west Greenland ice sheet varies dramatically between years. The reasons are unclear but likely involve darkening by inorganic particulates, cryoconite and ice algae. We use satellite imagery to examine dark ice dynamics and climate model outputs to find likely climatological controls. Outcropping particulates can explain the spatial extent of dark ice, but the darkening itself is likely due to ice algae growth controlled by meltwater and light availability.\n\nApplication of a two-step approach for mapping ice thickness to various glacier types on Svalbard\n\nJohannes Jakob FÃ¼rst, Fabien Gillet-Chaulet, Toby J. Benham, Julian A. Dowdeswell, Mariusz Grabiec, Francisco Navarro, Rickard Pettersson, Geir Moholdt, Christopher Nuth, BjÃ¶rn Sass, Kjetil Aas, Xavier Fettweis, Charlotte Lang, Thorsten Seehaus, and Matthias Braun\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 2003–2032, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2003-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2003-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFor the large majority of glaciers and ice caps, there is no information on the thickness of the ice cover. Any attempt to predict glacier demise under climatic warming and to estimate the future contribution to sea-level rise is limited as long as the glacier thickness is not well constrained. Here, we present a two-step mass-conservation approach for mapping ice thickness. Measurements are naturally reproduced. The reliability is readily assessible from a complementary map of error estimates.\n\nReconstructions of the 1900â2015 Greenland ice sheet surface mass balance using the regional climate MAR model\n\nXavier Fettweis, Jason E. Box, CÃ©cile Agosta, Charles Amory, Christoph Kittel, Charlotte Lang, Dirk van As, Horst Machguth, and Hubert GallÃ©e\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 1015–1033, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-1015-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-1015-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper shows that the surface melt increase over the Greenland ice sheet since the end of the 1990s has been unprecedented, with respect to the last 120 years, using a regional climate model. These simulations also suggest an increase of the snowfall accumulation through the last century before a surface mass decrease in the 2000s. Such a mass gain could have impacted the ice sheet's dynamic stability and could explain the recent observed increase of the glaciers' velocity.\n\nAÂ daily, 1â¯km resolution data set of downscaled Greenland ice sheet surface mass balance (1958â2015)\n\nBrice NoÃ«l, Willem Jan van de Berg, Horst Machguth, Stef Lhermitte, Ian Howat, Xavier Fettweis, and Michiel R. van den Broeke\n\nThe Cryosphere, 10, 2361–2377, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-2361-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-2361-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a 1 km resolution data set (1958–2015) of daily Greenland ice sheet surface mass balance (SMB), statistically downscaled from the data of RACMO2.3 at 11 km using elevation dependence, precipitation and bare ice albedo corrections. The data set resolves Greenland narrow ablation zones and local outlet glaciers, and shows more realistic SMB patterns, owing to enhanced runoff at the ice sheet margins. An evaluation of the product against SMB measurements shows improved agreement.\n\nApplication of GRACE to the assessment of model-based estimates of monthly Greenland Ice Sheet mass balanceÂ (2003–2012)\n\nNicole-Jeanne Schlegel, David N. Wiese, Eric Y. Larour, Michael M. Watkins, Jason E. Box, Xavier Fettweis, and Michiel R. van den Broeke\n\nThe Cryosphere, 10, 1965–1989, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-1965-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-1965-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate Greenland Ice Sheet mass change from 2003–2012 by comparing observations from GRACE with state-of-the-art atmospheric and ice sheet model simulations. We find that the largest discrepancies (in the northwest and southeast) are likely controlled by errors in modeled surface climate as well as ice–ocean interaction and hydrological processes (not included in the models). Models should consider such processes at monthly to seasonal resolutions in order to improve future projections.\n\nAnnual Greenland accumulation rates (2009â2012) from airborne snow radar\n\nLora S. Koenig, Alvaro Ivanoff, Patrick M. Alexander, Joseph A. MacGregor, Xavier Fettweis, Ben Panzer, John D. Paden, Richard R. Forster, Indrani Das, Joesph R. McConnell, Marco Tedesco, Carl Leuschen, and Prasad Gogineni\n\nThe Cryosphere, 10, 1739–1752, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-1739-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-1739-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nContemporary climate warming over the Arctic is accelerating mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet through increasing surface melt, emphasizing the need to closely monitor surface mass balance in order to improve sea-level rise predictions. Here, we quantify the net annual accumulation over the Greenland Ice Sheet, which comprises the largest component of surface mass balance, at a higher spatial resolution than currently available using high-resolution, airborne-radar data.\n\nGreenland Ice Sheet seasonal and spatial mass variability from model simulations and GRACE (2003â2012)\n\nPatrick M. Alexander, Marco Tedesco, Nicole-Jeanne Schlegel, Scott B. Luthcke, Xavier Fettweis, and Eric Larour\n\nThe Cryosphere, 10, 1259–1277, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-1259-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-1259-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe compared satellite-derived estimates of spatial and seasonal variations in Greenland Ice Sheet mass with a set of model simulations, revealing an agreement between models and satellite estimates for the ice-sheet-wide seasonal fluctuations in mass, but disagreement at finer spatial scales. The model simulations underestimate low-elevation mass loss. Improving the ability of models to capture variations and trends in Greenland Ice Sheet mass is important for estimating future sea level rise.\n\nThe darkening of the Greenland ice sheet: trends, drivers, and projections (1981–2100)\n\nMarco Tedesco, Sarah Doherty, Xavier Fettweis, Patrick Alexander, Jeyavinoth Jeyaratnam, and Julienne Stroeve\n\nThe Cryosphere, 10, 477–496, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-477-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-477-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSummer surface albedo over Greenland decreased at a rate of 0.02 per decade between 1996 and 2012. The decrease is due to snow grain growth, the expansion of bare ice areas, and trends in light-absorbing impurities on snow and ice surfaces. Neither aerosol models nor in situ observations indicate increasing trends in impurities in the atmosphere over Greenland. Albedo projections through to the end of the century under different warming scenarios consistently point to continued darkening.\n\nFeasibility of improving a priori regional climate model estimates of Greenland ice sheet surface mass loss through assimilation of measured ice surface temperatures\n\nM. Navari, S. A. Margulis, S. M. Bateni, M. Tedesco, P. Alexander, and X. Fettweis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 10, 103–120, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-103-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-103-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAn ensemble batch smoother was used to assess the feasibility of generating a reanalysis estimate of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) surface mass fluxes (SMF) via integrating measured ice surface temperatures with a regional climate model estimate. The results showed that assimilation of IST were able to overcome uncertainties in meteorological forcings that drive the GrIS surface processes. We showed that the proposed methodology is able to generate posterior reanalysis estimates of the SMF.\n\nEvaluation of the CMIP5 models in the aim of regional modelling of the Antarctic surface mass balance\n\nC. Agosta, X. Fettweis, and R.

Most of the models are biased compared to ERA-Interim, ACCESS1-3 being the best choice for forcing RCMs. Climate change is less sensitive to global warming than it is to the present-day simulated sea ice and to the feedback between sea-ice decrease and temperature increase around Antarctica.\n\nRecent changes in north-west Greenland climate documented by NEEM shallow ice core data and simulations, and implications for past-temperature reconstructions\n\nV.

Here, we focus on shallow ice cores providing a stack record of accumulation and water-stable isotopes spanning the past centuries. For the first time, we document the ongoing warming in a Greenland ice core. By combining our data with other Greenland ice cores and model results, we characterise the spatio-temporal patterns of variability.\n\nFuture climate and surface mass balance of Svalbard glaciers in an RCP8.5 climate scenario: a study with the regional climate model MAR forced by MIROC5\n\nC. Lang, X. Fettweis, and M. Erpicum\n\nThe Cryosphere, 9, 945–956, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-945-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-945-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe simulated the 21st century Svalbard SMB with the regional model MAR (RCP8.5 scenario). Melt is projected to increase gently up to 2050 and then dramatically increase, with a larger increase in the south of the archipelago. This difference is due to larger ice albedo decrease in the south causing larger increase of absorbed solar radiation. The ablation area is projected to disappear over the entire Svalbard by 2085. The SMB decrease compared to present is projected to contribute 7mm to SLR.\n\nStable climate and surface mass balance in Svalbard over 1979–2013 despite the Arctic warming\n\nC. Lang, X. Fettweis, and M. Erpicum\n\nThe Cryosphere, 9, 83–101, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-83-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-83-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe have modelled the surface mass balance (SMB) of Svalbard with the model MAR over 1979--2013. The mean SMB is slightly negative and the Svalbard glaciers are losing mass through surface processes (mainly precipitation and runoff), but there has been no acceleration of the surface melt, contrary to Greenland where melt records have been broken since 2006. We attributed it to a change in atmospheric circulation, resulting in northerly cold flows over Svalbard damping Arctic warming.\n\nRecent summer Arctic atmospheric circulation anomalies in a historical perspective\n\nA. Belleflamme, X. Fettweis, and M. Erpicum\n\nThe Cryosphere, 9, 53–64, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-53-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-53-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe 2007-2012 summertime circulation anomaly over the Arctic region (i.e. more high pressure systems over the Beaufort Sea, the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, and Greenland) is put in a historical perspective. While the 2007-2012 anomaly seems to be exceptional, similar circulation conditions have occurred since 1871, on the basis of five reanalyses (ERA-Interim, ERA-40, NCEP/NCAR, ERA-20C, 20CRv2). The attribution of this anomaly (natural variability or global warming) remains debatable.\n\nAssessing spatio-temporal variability and trends in modelled and measured Greenland Ice Sheet albedo (2000â2013)\n\nP.

We found that the warm and clear weather conditions in the 2015, 2019, and 2020 summers caused the snowmelt and the decline in surface reflectance of solar radiation at a low-elevated site (SIGMA-B; 944 m), but those were not seen at the high-elevated site (SIGMA-A; 1490 m). We hope that our data management method and findings will help climate scientists.\n\nA dataset of energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange observations in oasisâdesert areas from 2012 to 2021 in a typical endorheic basin\n\nShaomin Liu, Ziwei Xu, Tao Che, Xin Li, Tongren Xu, Zhiguo Ren, Yang Zhang, Junlei Tan, Lisheng Song, Ji Zhou, Zhongli Zhu, Xiaofan Yang, Rui Liu, and Yanfei Ma\n\nEarth Syst.

This paper describes the methods used to develop this lower-atmospheric properties dataset.\n\nCLARA-A3: The third edition of the AVHRR-based CM SAF climate data record on clouds, radiation and surface albedo covering the period 1979 to 2023\n\nKarl-GÃ¶ran Karlsson, Martin Stengel, Jan Fokke Meirink, Aku RiihelÃ¤, JÃ¶rg Trentmann, Tom Akkermans, Diana Stein, Abhay Devasthale, Salomon Eliasson, Erik Johansson, Nina HÃ¥kansson, Irina Solodovnik, Nikos Benas, Nicolas Clerbaux, Nathalie Selbach, Marc SchrÃ¶der, and Rainer Hollmann\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 15, 4901–4926, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-4901-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-4901-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents a global climate data record on cloud parameters, radiation at the surface and at the top of atmosphere, and surface albedo. The temporal coverage is 1979–2020 (42 years) and the data record is also continuously updated until present time. Thus, more than four decades of climate parameters are provided. Based on CLARA-A3, studies on distribution of clouds and radiation parameters can be made and, especially, investigations of climate trends and evaluation of climate models.\n\nET-WB: water-balance-based estimations of terrestrial evaporation over global land and major global basins\n\nJinghua Xiong, Abhishek, Li Xu, Hrishikesh A. Chandanpurkar, James S. Famiglietti, Chong Zhang, Gionata Ghiggi, Shenglian Guo, Yun Pan, and Bramha Dutt Vishwakarma\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 15, 4571–4597, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-4571-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-4571-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo overcome the shortcomings associated with limited spatiotemporal coverage, input data quality, and model simplifications in prevailing evaporation (ET) estimates, we developed an ensemble of 4669 unique terrestrial ET subsets using an independent mass balance approach. Long-term mean annual ET is within 500–600 mm yr−1 with a unimodal seasonal cycle and several piecewise trends during 2002–2021. The uncertainty-constrained results underpin the notion of increasing ET in a warming climate.\n\nAn integrated and homogenized global surface solar radiation dataset and its reconstruction based on a convolutional neural network approach\n\nBoyang Jiao, Yucheng Su, Qingxiang Li, Veronica Manara, and Martin Wild\n\nEarth Syst.

This is interpolated into a 5° × 5° SSRIH grid and reconstructed into a long-term (1955–2018) global land (except for Antarctica) 5° × 2.5° SSR anomaly dataset (SSRIH20CR) by an improved partial convolutional neural network deep-learning method. SSRIH20CR yields trends of −1.276 W m−2 per decade over the dimming period and 0.697 W m−2 per decade over the brightening period.\n\nIWIN: the Isfjorden Weather Information Network\n\nLukas Frank, Marius Opsanger Jonassen, Teresa Remes, Florina Roana Schalamon, and Agnes Stenlund\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 15, 4219–4234, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-4219-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-4219-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Isfjorden Weather Information Network (IWIN) provides continuous meteorological near-surface observations from Isfjorden in Svalbard. The network combines permanent automatic weather stations on lighthouses along the coast line with mobile stations on board small tourist cruise ships regularly trafficking the fjord during spring to autumn. All data are available online in near-real time. Besides their scientific value, IWIN data crucially enhance the safety of field activities in the region.\n\nA new daily gridded precipitation dataset for the Chinese mainland based on gauge observations\n\nJingya Han, Chiyuan Miao, Jiaojiao Gou, Haiyan Zheng, Qi Zhang, and Xiaoying Guo\n\nEarth Syst.

Sci. Data, 15, 2329–2346, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-2329-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-2329-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA collection of regional reanalysis datasets has been produced. However, little attention has been paid to East Asia, and there are no long-term, physically consistent regional reanalysis data available. The East Asia Reanalysis System was developed using the WRF model and GSI data assimilation system. A 39-year (1980–2018) reanalysis dataset is available for the East Asia region, at a high temporal (of 3 h) and spatial resolution (of 12 km), for mesoscale weather and regional climate studies.\n\nData rescue of historical wind observations in Sweden since the 1920s\n\nJohn Erik EngstrÃ¶m, Lennart Wern, Sverker HellstrÃ¶m, Erik KjellstrÃ¶m, ChunlÃ¼e Zhou, Deliang Chen, and Cesar Azorin-Molina\n\nEarth Syst.
