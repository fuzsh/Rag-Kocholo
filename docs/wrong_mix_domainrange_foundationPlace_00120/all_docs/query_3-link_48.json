        "text": "If you’ve decided to pursue a career as an esthetician and are evaluating your options for your schooling in this realm, there are a number of avenues you might take. One of these is a tour of one or more of the facilities you’re considering — if you go this route, it’s vital to be prepared for your visit.\n\nAt Skin Science Institute, we’re proud to offer a variety of esthetician programs throughout Utah, from the 600-hour basic esthetician course up through Master esthetician courses and much more. We welcome tours or visits to our facilities from prospective students, and are happy to answer all your questions while showcasing our incredible campus and resources. What are some of the most important themes to be inquiring about while touring an esthetician school? Here are several.\n\nAsk About Available Programs\n\nFirst and foremost, you want to be sure that any esthetician school you’re considering has the programs you’re looking for. Some students will require only basic training to earn a state license, while others may want to specialize in a specific area of the industry, such as permanent cosmetics or tattoo removal. It’s crucial to know ahead of time what types of courses can be taken so that you don’t go through the entire tour only to realize they don’t have your desired program.\n\nGenerally speaking, here are the programs most esthetician schools will offer (terms or course names may differ, of course):\n\nBasic esthetician: For new estheticians just looking to get started and obtain their license, this is the most common program. It will include basic training on themes like makeup, hair removal, skin care, and more.\n\nMaster esthetician: A more in-depth and specialized program that builds on the basic education, this may be a better fit for those who want to pursue a career in esthetics. It will often cover topics such as salon management, business skills, advanced skin care treatments, and more.\n\nComprehensive esthetician: Finally, there’s often what’s known as a comprehensive program, one that allows the trainee to eventually earn their Master esthetician license. Essentially, it’s a combination of the basic and Master programs, giving the student more flexibility and options.\n\nHowever, not all esthetician schools will necessarily offer all these programs. It’s important to confirm this before you even book a tour.\n\nHow Long Does the Program Take to Complete?\n\nEach state has different requirements for esthetician licensure, as well as different regulations on how long a program must be in order to qualify. For this reason, it’s important to ask the school you’re considering what the shortest and longest possible program lengths are. This will help you gauge how much time you’ll need to invest in your education.\n\nKeep in mind that most programs are not designed to be completed in a hurry; most will require dedication and hard work over the course of several months or even a year. So, if you’re looking for something that can be completed quickly, you may want to explore other options.\n\nIn Utah, total hour requirements for esthetician school range from 600 to 1,200 hours depending on the program being completed.\n\nAre Evening or Weekend Classes Available?\n\nMany of us have busy schedules, and it’s important to know whether the esthetician school you’re considering offers classes that fit with your lifestyle. Some schools may only offer day classes, while others have evening and weekend options. It’s definitely worth asking about this before making a decision.\n\nReal-Life Experience\n\nOne major area to ask about as you’re touring a given option: Whether or not students are put in a real-life salon situation during their training. You’ll want to know if you can expect to be working on real clients or not, as this will give you a better idea of what to expect after graduation.\n\nGenerally speaking, most esthetician schools will have their students work with mannequins in the early stages of their education, and then move on to working with real clients as they progress. However, it’s still a good idea to ask and get a sense of what the school’s policy is.\n\nFinancial Aid\n\nFor many who might require it, there’s no shame whatsoever in taking some time to ask about what sorts of financial aid might be available to them. Whether it’s scholarships, grants, or loans, most schools will have some sort of financial assistance program in place.\n\nDon’t be afraid to ask about this as you tour a given school; after all, the last thing anybody wants is to start their education and then not be able to continue because of money problems.\n\nWhat’s Student Life Like?\n\nA tour of an esthetician school campus, just like many other types of campus tours, is a great opportunity to ask your tour guide or even other students you encounter about the student life. Find out what it’s like, as well as what’s popular on campus and what kinds of extracurricular activities are offered.\n\nIt will give you a much better sense of whether or not this school is the right fit for you long-term, and can also help you determine if this is a place where you’re likely to feel at home. Do your best to talk to several different students and get an idea of what sets this school apart from others."
