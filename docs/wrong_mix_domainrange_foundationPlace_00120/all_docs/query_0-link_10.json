Introduction\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1. By an Applicationdated 26 April 1999 filed with the Registry of the Court\n\non 29 April 1999, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (\"FRY\") instituted\n\nproceedings againstthe Kingdomof Belgium (\"Belgium\") alleging the violationof\n\nvarious obligations arising from the use of force by the North Atlantic Treaty\n\nOrganisation (\"NATO\") in the FRY. The Application charges that \"Belgium,\n\ntogether with the Governrnentsof other Member Statesof NATO, took part in the\n\nacts of use of force against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia by taking part in\n\nbombing targets in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\". It further charges that\n\n\"Belgium is taking part in the training, arming, financing, equippingand supplying\n\nthe so-called 'KosovoLiberatian Amy\"'. The legal grounds for the jurisdiction of\n\nthe Court invoked by the FRY in its Application wereArticle 36(2) of the Court's\n\nStatute and Article IX of the Convention onthe Preventionand Punishmentof the\n\nCrimeof Genocide of 1948(\"the GenocideConvention\"). ' The Declaration filedby\n\nthe FRY which forms the basisof its claimto jurisdiction under Article 36(2) of the\n\nStatute was dated 25 April 199g2and was deposited with theSecretary-Generalof\n\nthe United Nationson 26 April 1999. The BelgianDeclaration under Article 36(2)\n\nof the Statuteis dated 17June 1958.~\n\n2. At the same time as the filing of its Application instituting proceedings\n\nagainst Belgium, theFRY filed separateApplicationsinstituting proceedingson the\n\nbasis of the same factual and legal allegations against the United States, the United\n\nKingdom,France, Germany,Italy, the Netherlands, Canada, Portugaland Spain.\n\n3. Contemporaneously with its Application instituting proceedings against\n\nBelgium, the FRY also filed ciRequest for the Indication of Provisional Measures\n\ndated 28 April 1999by which it requested the Court to order Belgium to \"cease\n\nimrnediately itsacts of use of force and [to]refrain from any act of threat or use of\n\nforce againstthe Federal Republicof Yugoslavia\" .4 Corresponding requests for the\n\nindication of provisional measures were submittedby the FRY in the parallel\n\nproceedings againstthe other nineRespondents.\n\n'78 UNTS277 (Annex1).\n\nAnnex2.\n\nAnnex3.\n\nRequest for the Indication of ProvisionalMeasures, 28 April 1999 (\"Provisional Measures\n\nRequest\"or \"Request\"), p.17. Introduction\n\n4. The Court held hearings on the FRY'S requests for the indication of\n\nprovisional measures on 10-12 May 1999. In the course of those hearings, by a\n\nletter of 12 May 1999, the FRY sought to supplement its Application instituting\n\nproceedings against Belgium by invoking Article 4 of the Convention of\n\nConciliation,Judicial Settlement anA drbitration of 1930 (\"the 1930 Con~ention\")~\n\nbetween Belgium and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia as an additional basis of the\n\nCourt'sjurisdiction.\n\n5. By an Order of 2 June 1999, the Court rejected the FRY'Srequest for the\n\nindication of provisional measures in respect of its proceedings against Belgium.\n\nThe basis of the Order was the Court's determination that the relevant declarations\n\nof the Parties did not constitute a prima facie basis of jurisdiction under Article\n\n36(2) of the StatuteYt6hat Article IX of the GenocideConventioncould not constitute\n\na prima facie basis of jurisdiction7 and that, in consequence of the late stage at\n\nwhich the 1930 Conventionwas invokedas a basis of jurisdiction, the Court could\n\nnot consider that Conventionfor the purpose of deciding whether it could indicate\n\nprovisional measures. *\n\n6. Similar Orders were made by the Court in respect of the requests for the\n\nindication of provisional measuresby the FRY in its proceedings against Canada,\n\nFrance, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugaland the United Kingdom. In the\n\nproceedings against both Spain and the United States, the Court ordered that the\n\ncases be removed from the List on the grounds that the Court \"manifestly lack[ed]\n\njurisdiction to entertainYugoslavia'sApplication\"and that it \"would mostassuredly\n\nnot contribute to the soundadministrationof justice\" for the Court to maintain on\n\nthe General List a case upon which it appears certain that it would not be able to\n\nadjudicateon the me rit^.^\n\n7. By an Order of 30 June 1999, the Court fixed 5 January 2000 for the filing\n\nof the Memorial of the FRY and5 July 2000 for the filingof the Counter-Memorial\n\nof Belgium. Pursuant to this Order, the FRY filed its Memorial, dated 5 January\n\n2000, together with annexes,under cover of letters dated4 January 2000.\n\n106LNTS(1930-1931) 343,No.2455.

UnitedStatesof America):Requestfor the Indicationof\n\nProvisionalMeasures,Orderof 2 June1999,atparagrap29. Introduction\n\n8. By Article 79 of the Rules of Court (\"Rules\"), any objection by the\n\nrespondent inter alia to the jurisdiction of the Court or the admissibility of the\n\napplication is to be made in writing within the time-limit for the delivery of the\n\nCounter-Memorial. In accordance with this requirement, Belgium submits these\n\nPreliminary Objections to thejurisdiction of the Court and the admissibility of the\n\napplication inthe present case.\n\n9. The underlying issues of substance in this case involve allegations by the\n\nFRY against Belgium that, by \"taking part in\" action by NATO in the FRY,\n\nBelgiurnhas violated various obligationsof international law. Given the nature of\n\nthe present phase of the case, and as Belgiumobjectsto the jurisdiction of the Court\n\nand the admissibility of the application, Belgium makes no comment here on the\n\nsubstanceof the FRY'Sallegationsof fact and argumentsof law or on the evidential\n\npropriety of and weight to be attributed to the material annexed to the FRY'S\n\nMemorial in purported support of these allegations and arguments. For the\n\navoidance of doubt, however, it may be noted that Belgiumrejects the allegations\n\nraised against it by the FRY and that, were the Court to decide, contrary to\n\nBelgium's submissionsherein, that it has jurisdiction to hear the case and that the\n\napplicationis admissible,Belgium wouldcontestthe allegationsfully.\n\n10. Neither this stateme~t,nor any reference herein to the underlying factual\n\ncontext of this case or any other statement herein can be taken in any way as\n\nimplying the submissionby Belgiumto the jurisdiction of the Court in this matter.\n\nBelgium does not here join argument with the FRY on the substance of its\n\nallegations.\n\n11. Belgium's positionon the jurisdiction of the Court and the admissibility of\n\nthe application may be surnmarisedas follows. As a prelirninary matter, Belgium\n\ncontends that the Court lacksjurisdiction in respectof claims advancedfor the first\n\ntime the FRY'SMemorial but not in its Applicationinstituting proceedings andior\n\nthat such claims are inadmissible.\n\n12. On the issue of jurisdiction more generally, Belgium contends that the\n\nCourt lacksjurisdiction to considerthis case on the following grounds:\n\n(a) the Court is not open to theFRY. The FRY is not a member of theUnited\n\nNations. The FRY is not otherwise a party to the Statute of the Court Introduction\n\npursuant to Article 93(2) of the UN Charter. The Court is not otherwise\n\nopen to the FRY pursuant to Article 35(2) of the Statute. Absent standing\n\nto appear, the FRY cannot foundjurisdiction on its Declaration of 25 April\n\n1999,on Article IX of the GenocideConventionor on Article 4 of the 1930\n\nConvention;\n\n(b) in the alternative, Belgium contends that the Court lacks jurisdiction under\n\nthe FRY'S Declaration of 25 April 1999, Article IX of the Genocide\n\nConvention andArticle 4 of the 1930 Conventionon the followinggrounds:\n\n(i) as regards the FRY's Declarationof 25 April 1999 - that the dispute\n\nandior the situationsor facts allegedarose prior to the \"crucial date\"\n\nindicatedin the temporal limitationof the FRY's Declaration;\n\n(ii) as regards Article IX of the Genocide Convention - that the action\n\nalleged does not come within the scope ratione materiae of the\n\nGenocide Convention;\n\n(iii) as regards Article 4 of the 1930 Convention - in addition or in the\n\nalternative, that the FRY is not a party to the Court's Statute for the\n\npurposes of Article 37 of the Statute; that the 1930 Conventionis no\n\nlonger in force; that. the FRY has not succeeded to the 1930\n\nConvention; and that the conditions of Article 4 of the 1930\n\nConventionhave not beenobserved.\n\n13. In additionor in the alternativeto these contentionsgoing to thejurisdiction\n\nof the Court, Belgium contends that the FRY'Sapplication is inadmissible on the\n\ngrounds:\n\n(a) that the FRY does not identifyany actions specifically allegedto have been\n\ncommittedby Belgiumwith which it takes issue;\n\n(b) that the FRY hasacted in bad faith; and\n\n(c) of the absence of the United States and other \"Respondents\" from the\n\nparallel proceedings. Introduction\n\n14. In paragraph 11 of its Memorial, the FRY notes that it \"has prepared an\n\nidenticaltext of the Memorialin al1eight pending cases\" and that the \"substance of\n\nthe dispute in al1eight casesis identical\". Itgoes on to noteas follows:\n\n\"Whereas al1Respondentsare in the same interest, according to\n\nArticle 31, para.5, of the Statuteof the Court, they should, for the\n\n' purpose of the nomination of ad hoc judge, be reckoned as one\n\nparty only. Alternatively, for said purpose, Belgium and the\n\nNetherlands are in the same interest; Canada, Portugal and the\n\nUnited Kingdom are in the same interest; and France, Germany\n\nand Italy are in the sameinterest.\"\n\n15. Belgium rejects the contentionthat it is a party in the same interest as any\n\nof the Respondents in the parallel cases initiated by the FRY, whether for the\n\npurpose of Article 31(5) of the Statute or of any other provision of the Court's\n\nStatuteor Rules.\n\n16. By a letter to theCourtdated 5 May 1999,Belgiumnotified the Court of its\n\nintentionto choose a Judgead hoc pursuantto the termsof Article 31 of the Statute\n\nand nominated Mr Patrick Duinslaeger for this purpose. The FRY, referring to\n\nArticle 31(5) of the Statute, objected to this nomination. The Court, \"after due\n\ndeliberation, found that nominationof a judge ad hoc by Belgium was justified in\n\nthe present phase of the case\".1°\n\n17. In the light of this decision,and in accordance withArticle 31 of the Statute\n\nand Article 35 of the Rules, Belgium, by a letter dated 13 April 2000 addressed to\n\nthe Registrar of the Court, confirmed its appointmentof and nominatedMr Patrick\n\nDuinslaegeras Judgead hoc for purposesof this case.\n\n18. In so doing, Belgium considers that the circumstances that warranted its\n\nnominationof a Judgead hoc for the provisionalmeasures phaseof the caseremain,\n\nand indeed are accentuated, in respect of the present phase of the case. Although\n\nthe factual and legal allegationsraised by the FRY against eachof the Respondents\n\nin the parallel proceedingsare the sarne, Belgium'sinterest in the matter is not the\n\nsame as that of the other Respondentsand should not be presumed to beso. As is\n\nalso evident, the FRY has relied on jurisdictional bases in its proceedings against\n\nBelgium that are particular to Belgium alone - namely, in the context of Article\n\n36(2) of the Statute, the Belgian Declaration of 17 June 1958 and, separately,\n\n- -\n\n\"Provisional MeasureOrder,atparagraph 12. Introduction\n\nArticle 4 of the 1930 Convention. Belgium contends, therefore, that it cannot be\n\nconsidered to be a party in the same interest as any of the Respondents in the\n\nparallel proceedings. ChapterOne\n\nPART1: BACKGROUNDANDPRELIMINARYISSUES\n\nCHAPTERONE: THEFRY'S CASE\n\n19. The FRY filed its Applicationinstitutingproceedings on 29 April 1999. At\n\nthe same tirne, it filed Request for the Indicationof ProvisionalMeasures. Oral\n\nargumenton this Request washeard on 10-12May 1999. The FRY's Memorialwas\n\nfiled on 5 January 2000. Although the Provisional Measures Reques tnd the oral\n\nargument thereon were concerned with matters that are not now before Court,\n\nimportant elements of the FRY's case wereaddressed during this phase of the\n\nproceedings.\n\n20. As will be describedmore fully below, it is Belgium's contention that the\n\nFRY's case has undergone a metamorphosis over the course of its submissions to\n\nthe Court since its Application. The implicitpurpose of this metamorphosiswas to\n\ndevelop and adjust the FRY's case inan attempt to cure fundamental defects in the\n\noriginal formulation of the case, and in the jurisdictional bases relied upon by the\n\nFRY, that became apparent during the course of the provisional measures\n\nproceedings. As is addressed in Chapter Two below, Belgium also contends that,\n\ninsofar as the FRY's case has evolved over time to includematters that were not\n\nspecified in its Application, the Court lacks jurisdiction overhese new elements\n\nandfor that these new elementsare inadmissible. It is against this background, and\n\nfor purposes of its argument on jurisdiction and admissibility only, that Belgium\n\nnow turns to identify the essential elementsof the FRY's case.\n\n1. The FRY'SApplicationinstitutingproceedings\n\n21. Article 40(1) of the Court'sStatuteprovides inter aliathat cases brought\n\nbefore the Court by written application shall indicate the subject of the dispute.\n\nThis is reiterated in Article 38(1) of the Court'sRules and is expanded upon in\n\nparagraph 2 of that Article inthe followingterrns:\n\n\"The application shall specify as far as possible the legal grounds\n\nupon which thejurisdiction of the Court isaid to be based; it shall\n\nalso specify the precise nature of the claim, together with a\n\nsuccinct statementof the facts and grounds on which the claim is\n\nbased.\" ChapterOne\n\n22. In respect of this provision, Belgium draws particular attention to the\n\nrequirement that an application instituting proceedings shall specify\"the precise\n\nnature of the claim\".\n\n23. Addressingthe \"Subject of the dispute\", the FRY, in its Application, States\n\nas follows:\n\n\"The subject-matter of the dispute are acts of The Kingdom of\n\nBelgium by which it has violated its international obligation\n\nbanning the use of force against another State, the obligationnot to\n\nintervene in the interna1affairs of another State, the obligation not\n\ntoviolate the sovereigntyof another State, the obligationto protect\n\nthe civilian population and civilian objects in wartime, the\n\nobligation to protect the environment, the obligation relating to\n\nfree navigation on international rivers, the obligation regarding\n\nfundamental human rights and freedoms, the obligation not to use\n\nprohibited weapons, the obligation not to deliberately inflict\n\nconditions of life calculated to cause the physical destruction of a\n\nnationalgroup.\"\n\n24. Under the heading \"Claim\", the FRY goes on to request the Court to\n\nadjudge and declare that, \"by taking part in\" various specified acts, Belgium is in\n\nbreach of the aforementionedobligations. The acts in which Belgium issaid to have\n\nparticipatedare:\n\nthe bombingof the territory of the FRY;\n\nthe training, arming, financing, equipping and supplying the Kosovo\n\nLiberation Amy (\"KLA\");\n\nattackson civiliantargets;\n\ndestroyingor damaging monasteriesand monumentsof culture;\n\nthe use of cluster bombs;\n\nthe bombingof oil refineries andchemical plants;\n\nthe use of weaponscontainingdepleteduranium;\n\nthe killing of civilians, destroying enterprises, communications, health and\n\ncultural institutions;and\n\nthe destructionof bridges on internationalrivers.\n\n25. The allegationconcerningtheviolationof \"the obligationnot to deliberately\n\ninflict conditions of life calculated to cause the physical destruction of a national\n\ngroup\" is based on the claim that Belgium tookpart in the \"activities listed above, ChapterOne\n\nand in particular by causing enormousenvironmentaldamage and by using depleted\n\nuranium\".\n\n26. Under the heading \"Facts upon which the claim is based\", the FRY alleges\n\nthat\n\n\"Belgium, together with theother Governments of other Member\n\nStates of NATO, took part in the acts of use of force against the\n\nFederal Republic of Yugoslaviaby taking part in bombing targets\n\nin the Federal Republicof Yugoslavia ...[and]is taking part in the\n\ntraining, arming ,financing ,equipping and supplying the so-called\n\n'Kosovo Liberation Amy ' .\"\n\n27. The jurisdictional bases invokedby the FRY in its Applicationin respect of\n\nthese allegations of substance are simply stated to be Article 36(2) of the Court's\n\nStatuteand Article IX of the GenocideConvention.\n\n28. Three observations are warranted in respect of these elements. First, the\n\nallegations levelled againstBelgium are that, \"by taking part in\" various specified\n\nacts, Belgium is in breach of the various legal obligations. Beyond this, the\n\nallegations do not identify with any particularity the acts said to have been\n\nundertaken by Belgium whichare alleged to constitute violations of law. It is not,\n\nfor example, allegedthat Belgiumused weaponscontainingdepleted uranium or that\n\nBelgium was engaged in the training, arming, financingequipping and supplying of\n\nthe KLA.\n\n29. Second, the Applicationcontains no indication of the dates on which the\n\nalleged acts are said to have been cornrnitted. In other words, the Application does\n\nnot identify any point at which the allegeddispute could be said to have crystallised\n\nor the period within which the acts constituting the dispute could be said to have\n\ntaken place. The full extent of FRY specificity on this point is to be found in that\n\npart of the Applicationaddressingthe \"facts upon which the claim is based\" where\n\nit is alleged that Belgium, \"together with the otherGovernments of other Member\n\nStatesof NATO, took part in the acts of use of force againstthe Federal Republic of\n\nYugoslavia by taking part in bombing targets in the Federal Republic of\n\nYugoslavia\" and \"is taking part in the training, arming, financing, equipping and\n\nsupplyingthe so-called'KosovoLiberationArmy'\".\n\n30. By reference to this statement, insofar as it ispossible to identifyfrom the\n\nApplication the period within which the allegationsfall, this would seem to be the Chapter One\n\nperiod within which (a) NATO used force against the FRY(b) by bombing targets\n\nin the FRY. On this test, the relevant period is that of 24 March 1999, ie, the date\n\non which the NATO bombing commenced, to 10 June 1999, ie, the date on which\n\nthe NATO bombingceased.\n\n31. In this regard, it may be noted that 10 June 1999was also the date on\n\nwhich the Security Council, acting under Chapter VI1 of the Charter, adopted\n\nResolution 1244(1999) laying down the principles thatwere to apply to a political\n\nsolution of the \"Kosovo crisis\" and deciding upon \"the deployment in Kosovo,\n\nunder UnitedNations auspices, of internationalciviland security presences\" .ll\n\n32. Third, no indicationis given in the Applicationof any linkage between the\n\nacts alleged and the bases of jurisdiction invoked. In other words, it is not clear\n\nfrom the Applicationwhether the FRY relies on each allegedbasis of jurisdiction in\n\nrespect of every act alleged or whether one or other basis of jurisdiction is relevant\n\nonly to certain of the acts alleged. It is however settledlaw that, while Declarations\n\nunder Article 36(2) of the Statute may, subject to such limitations as may be\n\ncontained therein, give the Court jurisdiction in disputes of a wide-ranging and\n\ngeneral nature, Article IX of the Genocide Conventioncan only give the Court\n\njurisdiction in \"[dlisputes between the Contracting Parties relating to the\n\ninterpretation, applicationor fulfilment of the present Convention\". Article IX of\n\nthe GenocideConventioncan therefore only establishjurisdiction in respect of acts\n\nfalling within the scope of the Convention ratione materiae. It cannot provide a\n\nbasis of jurisdiction in respect of acts more generally. Notwithstandingthe lack of\n\nclarity on thismatter in the Application, Article IX of the GenocideConventioncan\n\ntherefore only give the Court jurisdiction insofar as any of the acts alleged come\n\nwithin the scope of the Conventionand in respect of those acts only. This matter is\n\naddressed further in Chapter Six below.\n\n2. The provisional measures phase\n\n(a) TheFRY'SProvisional MeasuresRequest\n\n33. Filed at the same time as its Application,the FRY's Provisional Measures\n\nRequest did notaddress the substanceof the FRY'scase in detail or in a manner that\n\nwas at variance with its Application. It did, however, list at some length various\n\nacts of destructionalleged to havebeen causedby NATObombing.\n\n- -\n\n\"SIRES1124 (1999)of 10June 1999, at paragraphs 1and 5 (emphasisadded). (Annex5)\n\n1O Chapter One\n\n34. Two observations are warranted in respectof this Request. First, as in the\n\ncase of the Application, the Request does not particularise any acts specifically\n\nallegedto have been committedby Belgium. The allegationsin question are cast in\n\ngeneral terms. Second, as in the case of the Application, the Request gives no\n\nindicationof the dates on which the alleged actsare said to have been committed.\n\nIn other words, as with the Application,the Request does not identify anypoint at\n\nwhich the alleged dispute could be said to have crystallised or the period within\n\nwhichthe acts constitutingthe disputecould be saidto havetaken place.\n\n35. This omission notwithstanding,some indication of the point at which the\n\nalleged disputemight be said to have crystallised is implicit from the terms of the\n\nRequest. Three elements in particularare relevant in thisregard. First, theRequest\n\nis dated 28 April 1999. By necessary implication,any disputemust therefore have\n\narisen prior to this point. Second, the FRY's allegations are placed in a broad\n\ntemporal context, namely,\"[flrom the onset of the bombingof the Federal Republic\n\nof Yugoslavia ...\"12 Implicitly, therefore, the dispute with which the FRY is\n\nconcerned crystallisedon 24 March 1999,ie, the point at whichthe NATO bombing\n\ncornrnenced. This is consistent with the FRY's Application. Third, the specific\n\nallegationsof destructionmade by the FRY are also consistentwith an appreciation\n\non the part of the FRY that the dispute with which the FRY was concerned\n\ncrystallisedwith the commencementof bombingby NATO on 24 March 1999.\n\n36. For example, under the heading \"Bridges\", the FRY alleged that the\n\n\"Varadin Bridge on the Danube\" was destroyed.I3 While no date is given in the\n\nRequest for this allegedact of destruction, material subsequently filedby the FRY\n\nputs the date of the allegeddestructionof this bridge as 1 April 1999.14By way of\n\nfurther example, under the heading \"Industry and Trade\", the FRY alleged an\n\nattack on the \"'Lola Utva'agriculturalaircraft factory in Pancevo\".lS While no date\n\nis given in the Request for the alleged act, material subsequently filedby the FRY\n\nStatesas follows:\n\n\"The Lola Utva factory in Pancevo was exposed several times to\n\nNATO missile attacks:on 24 March 1999, at 9.00 p.m., by four\n\nProvisionalMeasuresRequest,app.1-2, fourparagraph.\n\nProvisionalMeasuresRequest,at p.4, \"Bridges\",at (a)(l).\n\nSee NATOCrimesin Yugoslavia,Volume1:DocumentaryEvidence(24March - 24 April 1999)\n\nfiled as an annexto the FRY'sMernorialof 5 January2000, at p.233.\n\n'ProvisionalMeasuresRequest,ap.8,\"Industryand Trade\", at item6. Chapter One\n\nmissiles; on 27 March 1999, at 8.05 p.m., by one missile and on\n\n29 March 1999,at 8.30 p.m., by one mi~sile.\"'~\n\n37. Although theFRY makesno express observationsto this effect, it is clear\n\nthat the allegeddispute with which theFRY is concerned arose, in the view of the\n\nFRY,at the point at which theNATO bombingcommenced,ie, on 24 March 1999.\n\n(b) Theoral phase of the requestfor provisional measures\n\n38. The oral phase of the provisionalmeasuresproceedingstook placeon 10-12\n\nMay 1999. In keeping with thenature and characterof those proceedings, the FRY\n\ndeveloped various aspectsof its case-both in respectofjurisdiction and merits - at\n\nsome length during the course of its submis~ions.'~Without reopening or entering\n\ninto debateon the detail of these submissions,a numberof observationspertinent to\n\nthe questionsofjurisdiction and admissibilityare warranted. First, as in the case of\n\nits previous submissions, the FRY's oral submissions during the provisional\n\nmeasuresphasemade no attemptto particulariseany acts specifically allegedto have\n\nbeen comrnittedby Belgium. Second, insofar as the FRY identified any NATO\n\nmember in the context of its allegations, it pointedto the UnitedStates alleging that\n\n\"the Kosovo crisis was a crisis selectedand developedby the UnitedStatesas a part\n\nof a long-term anti-Serb campaign. The objectives werepolitical and ~trategic.\"'~\n\n39. Third, as in its Applicationand ProvisionalMeasuresRequest, the FRY did\n\nnot expressly place the alleged dispute withwhich it was concerned within a\n\ntemporal framework. Once again, however, by reference to the detail of its\n\nsubmissions, it is possibleto deducethe relevantperiod. Thus, for example, in the\n\ncourse of the FRY's opening round of ara1 argument, the Agent for the FRY\n\nreferred variously, and generically, to \"[tlhe acts of bombing of the Yugoslav\n\nterritory\", \"[tlhe acts of bombing of the territory of Yugoslavia\", \"[bly bombing\n\nthe territory of Yugoslavia\", \"[c]ontinued bombing of the whole territory of the\n\nState\".I9 Similarly, Counsel for the FRY, Mr Mitic, opened his statement by\n\nreferring to \"the consequences whichNATO aggression againstYugoslavia caused\n\nso far and continues to cause\". In the course of his statement, he went on to\n\nl6See NATO Crimesin Yugoslavia,Volume1:DocumentatyEvidence (24March - 24 April 1999)\n\nfiled asaannexto theFRY'sMernoriaoi 5January2000,atp.351.\n\nl7See CR 99/141,0May 1999 andCR 99/251 ,2May 1999.\n\nl8StatementbyMrBrownlie,CR 99/251,2May 1999 ,tp.16.\n\nl9Statementby MrEtinski,CR99/141 ,0May 1999 ,tpp.23and30. ChapterOne\n\ndevelop various argumentsby reference to \"the beginning of the aggression on 24\n\nMarch 1999\".20\n\n40. In the light of these statements, and given the generic nature of the\n\nreferences to the \"acts of bombing\", it is clear that the alleged dispute withwhich\n\nthe FRY was concerned crystallised, in the view of the FRY, at the point at which\n\nthe bombing commenced, ie, on 24 March 1999. This, indeed, is confirrned\n\nunambiguouslyby the statementby Mr Miticjust noted.\n\n41. Fourth, while it is abundantlyclear that the allegeddispute with which the\n\nFRY wasconcerned arosewith the commencementof the bombing, it is alsoclear\n\nthat the FRY itselfsawthis \"dispute\" asan intimatepart of a wider series of events.\n\nThus, while taking care to preface his remarks by the comment that they were\n\n\"without prejudice to the jurisdiction of the Court defined by the Yugoslav\n\ndeclaration of the acceptance of the compulsoryjurisdiction of the Court\", the\n\nAgent for the FRY neverthelesswent on to state that, \"for a full comprehension of\n\nthe case, it could be useful to shed light on facts surrounding the case\".21 He\n\nproceeded to place the \"dispute\" in the context of the wider events in the former\n\nYugoslavia and, in particular, of the wider events concerning Kosovo. Thus,\n\nreference was made, amongst other things, to the deteriorating situation in Kosovo\n\nduring 1998, the establishment of the Kosovo Verification Mission and the\n\nRambouillet Conference of February-March 1999 .22 Counsel for the FRY,\n\nProfessor de Waart, similarlyplaced the \"dispute\" which the FRY sought to bring\n\nbefore the Court within its wider context, noting that \"[tlhe threat or use of force\n\nagainst the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in order to compel it to sign the\n\nRambouilletdraft Agreementwas unjustified\".23\n\n42. Fifth, in the light of arguments advanced by Belgium and by the\n\nRespondentsin the parallelproceedingsbefore the Court, a number of statements of\n\ninterest to the present phase of the proceedingswere madeby the representatives of\n\nthe FRY during the second round of oral hearings on 12 May 1999. Particularly\n\nimportant amongst these was the statementby Counsel for the FRY, Mr Corten,\n\nwho addressedat somelengththe temporaldimensionof the \"dispute\" raised by the\n\nFRY in the context of the terms of the Declaration filed by the FRY purportedly\n\nunder Article 36(2) of the Court's Statute. This provides inter alia that the Court\n\n-- - - -\n\n'OStatementby Mr Mitic,CR99/14, 10May 1999,atp.59.\n\n\" StatementbyMrEtinski,CR99/14, 10May1999,atp.25.\n\n'?Statementby MrEtinski,CR99/14, 10May1999,atpp.25-29.\n\n'StatementbyMrdeWaart,CR99/14, 10May 1999,atp.41. ChapterOne\n\nwill havejurisdiction \"in al1disputes arisingor whichmay arise after the signature\n\nof the present Declaration,with regard to the situationsor facts subsequentto this\n\nsignature\". TheFRY Declarationwas signedon 25 April 1999.\n\n43. Addressingthe argumentthat the dispute betweenthe Parties predated the\n\nsignature of the FRY's Declaration,and that in consequence, by the express terms\n\nof the Declaration, the Courtcould not have jurisdiction on the basis thereof, Mr\n\nCorten contended that the Declaration had to be interpreted on the basis of the\n\nintention of its author. He went on to argue that \"Yugoslavia desired, from 25\n\nApril 1999 onwards, to recognise the Court's jurisdiction over awide range of\n\ndisputes\".24 Each act of bombing, on this contention, \"led to 'a disagreementon a\n\npoint of law or fa~t\"'.~~In keeping with thisanalysis, the disputewith which the\n\nFRY was concerned was not, therefore - contrary to the language of the FRY's\n\nApplication, ProvisionalMeasures Request and first round oral statements - a\n\ndispute thathad arisen with the commencementof the NATO bombingon 24 March\n\n1999. Rather, there were \"a largenumber of separate disputes arising between\n\nYugoslavia and the NATO Member countries since 25 April concerning events\n\noccurring afterthat date\" .26\n\n44. Expressly eschewingany notion of a \"continuing situation\" arising from\n\n\"repeated separate military attacks\", Counsel for the FRY described these acts as\n\n\"instantaneous wrongful acts\"which \"can be precisely dated, including those after\n\n25 A~ril\".~~ The Court, on this contention, had jurisdiction on the basis of the\n\nFRY's Declaration, overthe \"dispute\" that aroseafter 25 April 1999 as a result of\n\nindividual, separate,instantaneous wrongful acts.\n\n45. The interpretationand applicationof the temporal limitationin the FRY's\n\nDeclaration is addressed in Chapter Fivebelow. For present purposes, Belgium\n\nsiinply notes these statementsof Counsel for the FRY and the evident discordance\n\nbetween these statements and theclear thrust of the earlier submissionsof the FRY\n\non the matter. For completeness, itmay be notedthat, even within the attemptby\n\nCounsel for the FRY to circumventthe limitationsof the FRY's Declaration, some\n\nambiguity was evident. Thus, Counsel for the FRY, continuing the statement\n\nreferred to above, noted that\n\n'4Statementby MrCorten,CR99/25, 12May 1999,Translation,atp.13.\n\n'5Statementby MrCorten,CR99/25, 12May 1999,Translationa , tp.10\n\nI6Statementby MrCorten,CR99/25, 12May 1999,Translation,atp.11.\n\n\" Statementby MrCorten,CR99/25, 12May 1999,Translationa , tp.11. ChapterOne\n\n\"[wlhat is in any event clear is that, initially, Yugoslavia wishedto\n\nsecure a judicial settlement of the disputes relating to the armed\n\nconflict then - and indeedstill - in progress between Yugoslavia\n\nand the respondent States. It goes without saying - and the\n\ndrafters of the declaration could personally testify to this - that\n\nYugoslaviadid indeed wish toinclude, and not to exclude, al1the\n\ndisagreements relating to the bombing to which it has been\n\nsubjected. \"28\n\n46. Notwithstanding the instantaneouswrongful acts argument previously\n\nadvanced, this statement suggests that the\"dispute\" which constituted the subject-\n\nmatter of the FRY'S case was the dispute \"relating to the armed conflict ... in\n\nprogress between Yugoslaviaand the respondent States\", ie, the use of force by\n\nNATO that had comrnencedon 24 March 1999.\n\n(c) TheCourt'sProvisionalMeasuresOrder\n\n47. The Court gave its Order on the ProvisionalMeasures Requeston 2 June\n\n1999. Rejecting theFRY'Srequest, the Court made a number of observations that\n\nare material to the present phase of the proceedings. First, the Court affirmed that\n\nit can \"exercise jurisdiction only between Statesparties to a dispute who not only\n\nhave access to the Court but also have accepted thejurisdiction of the Court, either\n\nin general form or for the individualdispute ~oncerned\".~~As Belgium willcontend\n\nin Chapter Four of these Preliminary Objections, thistwofold test to the Court's\n\njurisdiction - (a) access to theCourt, and (b) acceptanceof the jurisdiction of the\n\nCourt - is fundamental to the schemeof the UN Charterand theCourt's Statute.\n\n48. Second, noting that \"the Application is directed, in essence, against the\n\n'bombingof the territory of the Federal Republicof Yugoslavia'\" ,30the Court stated\n\nthat it had \"no doubt\" that a legal dispute arose between the FRY and Belgium\n\n\"well before 25 April 1999concerningthe legalityof those bombingsas such, taken\n\nas a ~hole\".~' Having noted the FRY argument that \"there exist 'a number of\n\nseparate disputeswhich havearisen' between theparties 'since25 April relating to\n\nevents subsequentto that date\"',32the Court went on to state:\n\n''StatementbyMrCorten,CR99/25, 12 May1999,Translationa ,tp.13.\n\nI9ProvisionalMeasuresOrder,atparagraph 20.\n\n30ProvisionalMeasuresOrder,atparagraph 27.\n\n31ProvisionalMeasuresOrder,atparagraph 28.\n\n32ProvisionalMeasuresOrder,atparagraph 25. Chapter One\n\n\"Whereas the factthat the bombingshave continued after 25 April\n\n1999 and that the dispute concerning themhas persisted since that\n\ndate is not such as Io alter the date on whichthe dispute arose;\n\nwhereas each individualair attack could not have given rise to a\n\nseparate subsequent dispute; and whereas, at this stage of the\n\nproceedings, Yugoslavia has not established that new disputes,\n\ndistinct from the initial one, have arisen between the Parties since\n\n25 April 1999 in respect of subsequent situations or facts\n\nattributableto Belgium. \"33\n\n49. On the basis of this analysis, the Court concluded that the Declarations of\n\nthe Parties \"do not constitute a basis on which the jurisdiction of the Court could\n\nprima faciebe founded in this case\".34\n\n50. Third, in the light of this finding, the Court concluded that it did not need\n\nto consider the question of the status of the FRY vis-à-vismembership of the United\n\nNations and accessto the Co~rt.~' It had been Belgium's contention in the oral\n\nphase of the provisional measures proceedings that theCourt lacks jurisdiction in\n\nthis matter as the FRY is not a member of the United Nations andthat the Court is\n\nnot otherwise open to the FRY on the basis of other arrangements contemplatedby\n\nthe Charterand the Statute. Belgiummaintains thiscontention in these Preliminary\n\nObjections.\n\n51. Fourth, as regards the FRY'Sclaim to jurisdiction on the basis of Article\n\nIX of the Genocide Conventiont,he Court observedthat, as it was \"not disputed that\n\nboth Yugoslavia and Belgium are parties to the Genocide Convention without\n\nreservation\", Article IX of the Convention\n\n\"accordingly appears to constitutea basis on which the jurisdiction\n\nof the Court might be foundedto the extentthat the subject-matter\n\nof the dispute relates to 'interpretation,application or filfilment'\n\nof the Convention,including disputes'relatingto the responsibility\n\nof a State for genocide or for any of the other acts enumerated in\n\nArticle III' of thesaid Convention\".36\n\n52. Addressing the allegations advanced by the FRY, the Court nevertheless\n\nwent on to concludethat\n\n\" Provisional MeasuresOrder,atparagraph29.\n\n34ProvisionalMeasuresOrder,atparagraph 30.\n\n35Provisional MeasuresOrder,atparagraph33.\n\n36ProvisionalMeasuresOrder,atparagraph 37 (emphasisadded). ChapterOne\n\n\"the threat or use of force against a State cannotin itself constitute\n\nan actof genocidewithinthe meaningof Article IIof the Genocide\n\nConvention; and [that], in the opinion of the Court, it does not\n\nappear at the present stage of the proceedingsthat the bombings\n\nwhich form the subject of the Yugoslav Application'indeed entai1\n\nthe element of intent, towards a group as such, required by\n\n[Article II of the Convention]' (Legality of the Threat or Useof\n\n' Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (1) ,\n\np.240, para.26)\" .37\n\n53. On the basis of this analysis, the Court concluded that Article IX of the\n\nGenocide Conventioncould not constitute \"a basis on which thejurisdiction of the\n\nCourt couldprima faciebe foundedin this case\".38\n\n54. Fifth, as regards the FRY's invocationof Article 4 of the 1930 Convention\n\nas an additionalbasis of jurisdiction vis-à-visBelgium, theCourt concludedthat, in\n\nconsequenceof the late stage at which the Conventionhad been invoked, it could\n\nnot consider the Conventionfor the purpose of deciding whetherit could indicate\n\nprovisionalmeasures .39\n\n55. Finally, the Court noted that the findings reached at the provisional\n\nmeasure stage inno way prejudged thequestion of the jurisdiction of the Court to\n\ndeal with the merits or any questions relating to the admissibility of the\n\n~pplication.~~This observation notwithstanding,it is evidentthat certain aspects of\n\nthe Court's findingsamountto settledconclusionsof law. While, for example, the\n\nissueofjurisdictionunder the FRY'sDeclarationwasleft open, as a matter properly\n\nto be determined in the present phase of the case, the Court's conclusion that \"the\n\nfact that the bombingshave continuedafter 25 April 1999 ...is not such as to alter\n\nthe date on which the dispute aroseW4w ' as cast in conclusiveterms. Similarly,\n\nwhile the issueofjurisdictionunder ArticleIXof the GenocideConventionwas also\n\nleft open, the Court's conclusion that \"the threat or use of force against a State\n\ncannot itself constitute an act of genocide within the meaningof Article II of the\n\nGenocide C~nvention\"~~ was also conclusive.\n\n37ProvisionalMeasuresOrder,atparagraph 40.\n\n3\"rovi~ional MeasuresOrder,atparagraph 41.\n\n39Provisional MeasureOrder,atparagraph 44.\n\n40Provisional MeasureOrder,atparagraph 46.\n\n4'Seeparagraph 48 above.\n\n4'Seeparagraph 52 above. ChapterOne\n\n56. The Court is not, of course, bound by its earlier decisions and Belgium\n\ndoes not here suggest that these findings cannotbe reopened. These matters are\n\naccordingly addressedby Belgium fully elsewhere in these Preliminary Objections.\n\nBelgium nevertheless observesthat the Court's findings on these points are cast in\n\nconclusiveterms.\n\n3. The FRY'SMemorial\n\n57. The FRY filed its Memorialand annexeson 5 January 2000. Of the four\n\nvolumesof annexes, thefirst, marked \"Annexes\", contains 178documents, Nos.1 -\n\n160 of which are in Serbo-Croat. No translationof these documents is provided in\n\nthis volume although translations are provided elsewherein the annexed material\n\nfiled by the FRY. The remaining 18 documents in this collection are filed in\n\nEnglish or French with the exceptionof Annex No.165 which is filed in German\n\nonly. No translationof this document is providedby the FRY.\n\n58. The second and third volumes of annexed material are entitled NATO\n\nCrimes in Yugoslavia:DocumentaryEvidence. These are divided into Volumes 1\n\nand II; the first relating to period 24 March - 24 April 1999; the second to the\n\nperiod 25 April - 10 June 1999. These dates are material. Volume1 covers the\n\nperiod from the start of the NATO bombingto the point imrnediatelyprior to the\n\nsigning of the FRY's Declaration purportedly under Article 36(2) of the Court's\n\nStatute. Volume II covers the period from the signature of the FRY's Declaration\n\nto the suspensionof the NATObombing. None of the material annexedby the FRY\n\naddresses acts alleged to have been comrnitted after 10 June 1999. The material\n\nincluded in these volumes is filed in English and includes translations of Annexes\n\nNo. 1 - 160filedby the FRY in Serbo-Croatinits first volumeof annexes.\n\n59. The final volume of annexes is entitled \"Documents Diplomatiques:\n\nCorrespondanceconcernant lesactes de violenceet de brigandage des Albanais\n\ndans la Vieille-Serbie (Vilayetde Kossovo)1898-1899\"and is filed in both Serbo-\n\nCroat and French.\n\n60. As regards its Memorial, the FRY opens with arestatement of its case as\n\nformulated in its ~~~lication~a~nd goes on to note that it has prepared an identical\n\n43FRY Memorial, paragraph5. ChapterOne\n\nMemorialin respect of al1eightpendingcases arising out of the NATO action in the\n\nFRY as c[tlhe substanceof dispute inal1eight casesis identical\" .44\n\n61. Noting that the Court, in its Provisional Measures Order, had concluded\n\nthat it wasprima facie without juri~diction,~~the FRY then contendsthat\n\n\"[s]ince the Orders of the Court, dated 2 June 1999, the dispute\n\naggravatedand extended. It got new elernentsconcerningfailures\n\nof the Respondents to fulfil their obligations established by\n\nSecurity Council resolution1244 and by the 1948Convention on\n\nthe Prevention and Funishrnent of the Crime of Genocide.\n\nNegating the allegedhumanitarianmotivesof the Respondents,the\n\nnew elements are of crucial importance for the substance of the\n\ndispute.\n\nDue to the fact that thedispute matured, throughnew elements, the\n\nApplicant considers that the circumstances related to the\n\njurisdiction of the Court have thus changed so that the Court has\n\nthejurisdictionto resolvethe dispute. \"46\n\n62. As these paragraphs make plain, an important feature of the FRY's\n\nMemorial is that it seeks to develop the caseoriginally stated in the FRY's\n\nApplication bothtemporallyand substantively. In Belgium'scontention, insofar as\n\nthe FRY case has evolved to include matters that were not specified in its\n\nApplication, the Courtlacksjurisdiction over these new elements andlor that these\n\nnew elements are inadmissible. This matter is addressed fully in Chapter Two\n\nbelow .\n\n63. Approximatelythree-quarters (some 300 pages) of the FRY's Memorialis\n\ngiven over to allegations of fact. About half of this material sets out a\n\nchronological,day-by-day series of allegations concerning\"facts related to bombing\n\nof the territory of the FR ofYug~slavia\".~~This begins on 24 March 1999and goes\n\nthrough to 9 June 1999. The allegations run seamlessly , day-by-day , throughout\n\nthis period making no distinctionbetween acts alleged to haveoccurred prior to 25\n\nApril 1999 (ie, the date of signature of the FRY's Declaration purportedly under\n\nArticle 36(2) of the Court's Statute)and acts allegedto have occurred subsequently.\n\n44FRY Memorial,paragraph 11.\n\n45FRY Memorial,paragraph 8.\n\n49RY Memorial,paragraphs 12and16. Seealsopp.339-340.\n\n47FRY Memorial,Part1.1, pp.11-137. ChapterOne\n\nOf the annexed material referred to in this part, Annexes No.1 - 74 correspond to\n\nallegations in respectof the period24 March - 24 April 1999.\n\nPart 1.5 of the FRY's Memorial, under the title \"Facts Related toKillings,\n\n64.\n\nWounding and Ethnic Cleansing of Serbs and Other Non-Albanian Gro~ps\",~~\n\naddresses acts alleged to have occurred in the period after 10 June 1999, ie, after\n\nthe suspension of the NATO bombing and the adoption, by the Security Council\n\nacting under Chapter VI1of the Charter, of Resolution 1244 (1999). This Part of\n\nthe Memorial thus addresses those elements which,in the FRY's contention, caused\n\nthe dispute to be \"aggravated and extended\" in the period following the Court's\n\nProvisional Measures Order. None of the allegations made in this Part are\n\nsupported by any annexed documentarymaterial. The allegationsare thus entirely\n\nunsubstantiated.\n\n65. The allegationsin this Part constitutethe only material cited by the FRY in\n\nsupport of its contention that \"the dispute aggravatedand extended\" in the period\n\nafter 10June 1999.\n\n66. Beyond its allegatioru of fact, the FRY Memorial includes short sections\n\naddressing issuesof law4'and thejurisdiction of the Court.\"\n\n67. As regards the jurisdiction of the Court, insofar as is material to the\n\nproceedings involvingBelgium,the FRY case can be sumrnarisedas follows:\n\n(a) the FRY is a Member of the United Nations;\"\n\n(b) the Court has jurisdiction under Article 36(2) of its Statute pursuant to the\n\nBelgian Declaration of 17 June 1958and the FRY Declaration of 25 April\n\n1999;~~\n\n(c) in this regard, a dispute arises when al1its elements come into existence.53\n\nAs the post-10 June 1999 \"elements are part and parce1 of the dispute\n\nrelated to the bombing of the territory of the Appli~ant\",'~the Court has\n\n48FRYMernorial,pp.201-282.\n\n49FRYMernorial,PartTwo,pp.301-328.\n\nFRYMernorial,PartThree,pp.329-349.\n\n51FRYMernorial,pp.329-335.\n\n52FRYMernorial,pp.335-343.\n\n53FRYMernorial,p.339, paragraph 3.2.13.\n\n54FRYMernorial,p.339, paragraph 3.2.11.

Chapter One\n\njurisdiction notwithstanding the temporal limitation in the FRY's\n\nDeclaration asthe dispute \"has arisen in full after 10June 1999\";55\n\n(d) the Court has jurisdiction vis-à-vis Belgium pursuant to Article 4 of the\n\n1930 Conventi~n;~~\n\n(el in this regard, the FRY contends that the 1930 Conventionis in force57and\n\nthat the procedural obstaclesthat led to the Court decliningto consider the\n\nConventionduring the provisionalmeasures phase havedi~appeared;~~\n\n(0 the Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Article IX of the Genocide\n\nonv vent ion;^^\n\n(g) in this regard, the FRY contends that, by its Memorial, it has submitted\n\nevidence of intent to commit genocide - namely, acts of bombing and acts\n\nof killing and woundingof Serbs and other non-Albanianpopulation after\n\n10 June 1999 - such as to establish jurisdiction under Article IX of the\n\nGenocide Convention .60\n\n68. Each of these elementsof the FRY'Scase is addressedin detail below in the\n\ncontextof Belgium'ssubstantiveobjectionstojurisdiction and admissibility.\n\nA number of observations on the FRY's Memorial more generally are\n\n69.\n\nwarranted at this point. First, as regards the annexesto the FRY's Memorial, much\n\nof the material contained in the two volume collection entitled NATO Crimes in\n\nYugoslavia:Documentary Evidence is not referred to in the FRY's Memorial.\n\nSimilarly, no reference is made in the FRY's Memorial to the fourth volume of\n\nannexes containingDocuments Diplomatiquesfrom the period 1898-1899. In both\n\ncases, the FRY's purpose in attaching this material is unclear although it may be\n\npresumed to have been put before the Court with prejudicial intent vis-à-vis\n\nBelgium.\n\nSecond, as was the case in its earlier submissions, the FRY makes no\n\n70.\n\nattempt in its Memorial to particularise any acts specificallyalleged to have been\n\ncomrnittedby Belgium. Indeed, with the sole exception of that part of the FRY's\n\nMemorial that addresses the 1930 Conventionas an additional basis of jurisdiction\n\nvis-à-visBelgium, theMemorial makes no reference to Belgiumat al1in respect of\n\nany of the allegationstherein.\n\n55FRYMernorial,p.340, paragraph3.2.14.\n\n56FRYMernorial,pp.343-346.\n\n57FRYMernorial,p.346, paragraph3.3.10.\n\nFRYMernorial,p.346, paragraph3.3.9.\n\n59FRYMernorial,pp.346-349.\n\n60FRYMernorial,p.349, paragraph3.4.3. ChapterOne\n\n71. Third, the FRY's contention that \"the dispute aggravated and extended\" to\n\nincludenew elements inthe period after 10June 1999is of central importanceto the\n\npresent phase of the case. Referring to \"failures of the Respondents\" to fulfil their\n\nobligations under Security Council Resolution 1244 (1999) and the Genocide\n\nC~nvention,~t 'he FRY contendsthat\n\n\"these new disputed elementsare part and parce1 of the dispute\n\nrelated to the bombing of the territory of the Applicant. The\n\ndispute arising from the bombing matured throughout the new\n\ndisputed elementsrelated to responsibility of the Respondentsfor\n\nthe crime of genocide comrnittedto Serbs and other non-Albanian\n\ngroups in the areaunder control of KFOR. ...\n\nWhereas some of the constituentelements of the dispute appeared\n\nafter 10 June 1999, the dispute, which started to arise before 25\n\nApril 1999, has arisen in full after 10 June 1999. So, it iswithin\n\nthe compulsory jurisdiction of the Court, established by the\n\nYugoslavdeclarationof 25 April 1999. \"62\n\n72. As Belgiumhas already observed, the only material contained in the FRY's\n\nMemorial relating to the alleged aggravation and extension of the dispute after 10\n\nJune 1999 is to be foundin Part 1.5. Belgium reiterates that this material consists\n\nof entirely unsubstantiated allegations, unsupported by any evidence whatever. In\n\nkeeping with the strictly preliminarycharacter of these proceedings, Belgiurnmakes\n\nno comment on the substance of these allegations. As a purely forma1 matter,\n\nhowever, and one which is appropriate for determination by the Court in\n\nproceedings addressing jurisdiction and admissibility, Belgium contends that the\n\nmaterial filed by the FRY in respect of its post-10 June 1999 allegations does not\n\nallow for any meaningful appraisal and response by Belgium and is likewise\n\nfundamentally incapableof any meaningfuljuridical appraisalby the Court.\n\n4. Conclusions\n\n73. A number of general conclusionsemerge from the preceding review of the\n\nFRY's case:\n\n61See paragraph61 above.\n\n\" FRY Memorial,pp.339-340,paragraph3.2.12 and3.2.14. ChapterOne\n\nin none of the documents filedso far by the FRY is any attempt made to\n\nparticularise allegationsagainst Belgium in respect of specific acts alleged\n\nto havebeen committedby Belgium;\n\ninsofar as the actions of any specific NATO Member are identified\n\nthroughout its various submissions,the FRY alleged that the Kosovo crisis\n\nwas \"selectedand developedby the UnitedStates\" ;\n\nboth in its Applicationand throughout the provisional measures phase of\n\nthe case until the second round of oral argument, the FRY gave no\n\nindicationof the temporal dimensionof the dispute it soughtto bring before\n\nthe Court;\n\nin this regard, however, it is evidentfrom the detailed allegationsadvanced\n\nby the FRY that thedisputewith which theFRY is concerned is thedispute\n\nthat crystallised with the commencementof the NATO action in the FRY\n\non 24 March 1999;\n\nthe FRY also, however, acknowledged that the NATO action was an\n\nintegralpart of a wider seriesof events concerningKosovo;\n\nwith the objectiveof avoiding the difficultiesthat became apparent as a\n\nresult of the temporallimitationin the FRY'sDeclarationof 25 April 1999,\n\nCounsel for the FRY, in the second round of the oral hearings in the\n\nprovisionalmeasuresphase, sought tocharacterisethe \"dispute\" before the\n\nCourt as a series of instantaneous wrongful actssubsequent to 25 April\n\n1999each of which gave rise to a separatedisagreementon a point of fact\n\nor law ;\n\nin a further attempt to avoid thepitfalls of the temporal restriction in the\n\nFRY's Declarationof 25 April 1999, the FRY, in its Memorial, alleged\n\nthat the dispute was \"aggravatedand extended\"in the period after 10 June\n\n1999 soas to bring a disputeinto existenceonlyafter 25 April 1999;\n\nthis allegation notwithstanding, thefactual allegations at the heart of the\n\nFRY's Memorial consistently treat the \"dispute\" as running from the\n\ncommencementof the NATObombingon 24 March 1999; and ChapterOne\n\n(il as regards the FRY'S allegation that the dispute was \"aggravated and\n\nextended\" in the period after 10 June 1999, the only material cited by the\n\nFRY in support of this allegationis that set out in Part 1.5 of its Memorial.\n\nIn not a single instance, however, are these allegations supported by\n\nevidence. Purely as a matter of form, these allegations could not therefore\n\nadmit of any meaningful appraisal and response by Belgium and wouldbe\n\nfundarnentally incapableof any meaningfulappraisalby the Court.\n\n74. These elementswill be addressedfurther below in the context of Belgium's\n\nsubstantive argumentsonjurisdiction and admissibility. ChapterTwo\n\nCHAPTERTWO: THECOURTLACKSJURISDICTIONIN RESPECTOF\n\nCLAIMSMADEFOR THEFIRSTTIMEIN THEFRY'SMEMORIAL\n\nANDIORSUCHCLAIMSARE INADMISSIBLE\n\n75. In Chapter One, Belgium contended that theFRY's casehas undergone a\n\nmetamorphosisover the course of its various submissionsto the Court. Belgium\n\nfurther contendedthat, insofar as theY'Scase has evolved over time to include\n\nmatters that were not specifiedin its Application,the Court lacks jurisdiction over\n\nthese new elementsandlor that these new elementsare inadmissible. As regards the\n\nfirst ofhese contentions, the metamorphosisof the FRY's case isplain. As the\n\nreview in the preceding Chapter shows,theFRY'SApplicationwas focused on the\n\nallegations regarding NATO bombing of the FRY andthe training, arming, etc of\n\nthe KLA. This focus was maintained during the proceedings on the FRY's\n\nProvisionalMeasuresRequest leavingno doubt about thetemporal dimensionof the\n\nFRY'Sclaim.\n\n76. The focus of the FRY's case was, however,expandedboth temporally and\n\nsubstantivelyin theRY'SMemorialto include allegedfailures by Belgiumto fulfil\n\nits obligations under Security Council Resolution1244 (1999) and the Genocide\n\nConvention in the period after the cessation of NATO bornbing. These new\n\nallegations are significantly and qualitatively different from those raised in the\n\nFRY'S Application as they address the interpretation and application of Security\n\nCouncil Resolution 1244(1999) and raise issues of a broader nature that are likely\n\nto be of concern to many members of the UnitedNations, including, in particular,\n\nthose which currently have forces in Kosovopursuant to the mandate laid down in\n\nSecurity Council Resolution 1244 (1999). These new claims cannot inany way be\n\nsaid to have been implicit in the original Applicationor to otherwise arise directly\n\nout of thesubject-matterof that Application.\n\n77. The evidential shortcomings of the FRY'Sallegations in respect of these\n\nmatters have already been touched upon in Chapter One. Other aspects of the\n\nmetamorphosis in the FRY'Scase will be addressedin the context of Belgium's\n\nargument concerning the temporal limitatioin the FRY's Declarationof 25 April\n\n1999. Separately from these issues, Belgium also contends that the Court lacks\n\njurisdiction in respect of the matters raisedfor the first time in the FRY's Memorial\n\nandlor thatthese new claims are inadmissible. As this question straddlesvarious ChapterTwo\n\notherwise discrete arguments which are addressed in Parts II and III of these\n\nPreliminary Objectionsbelow, it is convenient toaddress itat thispoint.\n\n78. Article 40(1) of the Court's Statute provides that the \"subject of the\n\ndispute\" must be indicated in the Application. Article38(2) of the Court's Rules\n\ngoes on to require that \"the precise natureof the claim\" must be specified in the\n\nApplication. The importance of these provisions within the scheme of the\n\nadministrationof justice by the Court cannot be overstated. As the Court observed\n\nin its Judgmentin the Naurucase,63\n\n\"[tlhese provisionsare so essential from thepoint of view of legal\n\nsecurity and the good administration of justice that they were\n\nalready, in substance, part of the text of the Statute of the\n\nPermanent Courtof International Justice,adoptedin 1920 (Art.40,\n\nfirst paragraph), and of the text of the first Rules of that Court,\n\nadoptedin 1922 (Art.35, secondparagraph), respectively \"64\n\n79. This assessmentwas echoedby the Court more recently in its Judgment in\n\nthe Fisheries Jurisdiction Case (Spainv. Canada) .65\n\nThe central importanceof a precise statementof an applicant'scase in the\n\n80.\n\ndocument initiating legal proceedings is also attested to by the inclusion of\n\nprovisions similar to those in the Court's Statuteand Rules in the corresponding\n\ndocumentsof other courtsand tribun al^.^^\n\nAs is clear from the jurisprudence of both the Permanent Court and the\n\n81.\n\nInternational Court, the requirement that an applicant must specify the precise\n\nnature of its claim is not regarded as an unimportant matter of form. Thus, the\n\nPermanent Court, in its Order of 4 February 1933 inthe case concerningthe Prince\n\nvon PlessAdministration (PreliminarO ybjection),statedthat\n\nh3CertainPhosphate LandsinNauru(Nauruv. Australia),PreliminatyObjections,Judgment1.C.J.\n\nReports1992, p.240.\n\n\"'Nauruv. Australia,ibid, at p.267, paragraph 69.\n\nh5 FislzeriesJurisdictionCase (Spv.nCanada), Jurisdiction,Judgmentof 4 December 1998, at\n\nparagraph 29.\n\nh6 See, for example, Article 19 of the Statute,and the Rulesof Procedure,of the European Court of\n\nJustice and Article 6.2 of theWTO Understandingon Rules and Procedures Governing the\n\nSettlementofDisputes. ChapterTwo\n\n\"it is the Applicationwhich sets out thesubject of the dispute, and\n\nthe Case, though it may elucidate the terms of the Application,\n\nmust not go beyond the limitsof the claimas set out therein ..\"67\n\n82. Similarly, in Société commerciald eeBelgique, the Permanent Court stated:\n\n\"It is to be observed that the liberty accorded to the parties to\n\namendtheir submissionsup to the end of the oral proceedings must\n\nbe construed reasonablyand without infringingthe terms of Article\n\n40 of the Statute and Article 32, paragraph 2, of the Rules which\n\nprovide that the Application must indicate the subject of the\n\ndispute. The Court has not hitherto had occasion to determine the\n\nlimits of this liberty, but it is clear that the Court cannot, in\n\nprinciple, allow a dispute brought before it by application to be\n\ntransformed by amendrnents in the submissions into another\n\ndispute which is different in character. A practice of this kind\n\nwould be calculated to prejudice the interests of third States to\n\nwhich, under Article 40, paragraph 2, of the Statute, al1\n\napplicationsmust be communicatedin order that they may be in a\n\nposition to avail themselves of the right of intervention provided\n\nfor in Articles 62 and 63 of the Statute. Similarly, a complete\n\nchange in the basis of the case submitted tothe Court might affect\n\nthe Court'sjurisdiction. \"\"\n\n83. The Judgment of the Court in the Nauru case is even more directly on\n\npoint. In that case, Australia contended thatNauru's claim concerningthe overseas\n\nassets of the British Phosphate Commissionerswas inadmissibleand that the Court\n\nhad nojurisdiction in relation to that claim on theground that the claim was new,\n\nhaving appeared for the first time in the Nauruan Memorial. Australia further\n\nargued that the claim would transform the disputebrought before the Court into a\n\ndisputeof a different nature. 69\n\n84. Addressing this matter, the Court noted that there was no reference to the\n\nclaim in question in Nauru'sApplicationand that, from a forma1point of view, the\n\nclaim in question was thus a new ~laim.~' On the question of whether this\n\nshortcoming of form was one to which the Court should attach importance, the\n\nCourt noted thatfor the claimin question\n\n67Prince vonPlessAdministration (Preliminarybjection),P.C.I.J., SeriesA/B, No.52, atp.14.\n\n68Sociétécommercialede Belgique,P.C.Z. ., SeriesA/B, No.78, atp.173.\n\n69Nauruv. Australia,note63 supra,atpp.264-5, paragraphs2-63.\n\n70Nauruv. Australia,note63 supra,atpp.265-6,paragraphs64-65. ChapterTwo\n\n\"to be held to have been, as a matter of substance, included in the\n\noriginal claim, it is not sufficient that there should be links\n\nbetween themof a general nature. An additional claim must have\n\nbeen implicit in the application (Templeof Preah Vihear, Merits,\n\nI.C.J. Reports 1962, p.36) or must arise 'directly out of the\n\nquestion which is the subject-matterof that Application'(Fisheries\n\nJurisdiction (FederalRepublic of Germany v. Iceland), Merits,\n\nI.C.J. Reports 1974, p.203, para.72). \"71\n\n85. The Court went on further to note that, if it had to entertain the dispute on\n\nthe new claims on the merits, \"the subject of the dispute on which it would\n\nultimately have to pass wouldbe necessarily distinctfrom the subject of the dispute\n\noriginally submitted to it in the Applicati~n\".~~ Given this to be the case, and\n\nreferring to the requirementin the Court's Statuteand Rulesthat the \"subject of the\n\ndispute\" and the \"precise nature of the claim\" had to be specified in the\n\nApplication, the Court concluded that the Nauruan claim in question was, in both\n\nform and substance, a new claim. The Court, accordingly, upheld the preliminary\n\nobjection advancedby Australia.\n\n86. In Belgium's contention,this reasoning applies equally to thecircumstances\n\nof the present case. The allegations in respectof the period after 10June 1999 raise\n\nquestions of a fundamentallydifferent nature to those in respect of the pre-10 June\n\nperiod - quite apart from any issues concerning the veracityof the substantive\n\nallegations of fact. Issues which may be relevant include the interpretation and\n\napplication of Security Council Resolution 1244(1999), the responsibility of UN\n\nmembers acting pursuant to a mandate laid down in a binding resolution of the\n\nCouncil, the law applicable to forces acting pursuant to a UN mandate, the\n\nimputability of acts to individual troop-contributing states, the application of the\n\nGenocideConventionto situations involvingUN peacekeepingor peace-enforcement\n\noperations, questions relating to theimmunity of states andlor forces engaged in\n\nsuch operations, etc. Questionssuch as these could in no way be said to have been\n\ncontemplated by the original Application or to be directly linked to the subject-\n\nmatter of the dispute originally referredto the Court. To borrow the words of the\n\nCourt in the Nauru case, if the Court had to entertain the dispute on these new\n\nclaims on the merits, the subjectof the dispute on which it would ultimately have to\n\npass would, as regards these claims, be entirely distinct from the subject of the\n\ndispute originally submitted to it in the FRY'SApplication. In Belgium's view, to\n\nentertain such a case would becontrary to principles of legal certainty and the sound\n\n''Nauruv. Australianote63 supra,atp.266, paragrap67.\n\n72Nauruv.Australia,note63 supra,atp.266, paragrap68. Chapter Two\n\nadministrationof justice andwould prejudice the interests of third States having an\n\ninterestin the matter.\n\n87. One final point mustbe added. In its Application, the FRY stated that it\n\n\"ïeserves the right to amend and supplement thisApplication\". Whatever may be\n\npermittedby way of amendmentby referenceto this statement - and it is clear from\n\nthe~ourt's jurisprudence that such a reservation cannotbe relied upon simply to\n\ngive an applicant the latitude to amend as it sees fit73 - this camt include the\n\naddition of new claims, identified for the first time in the applicant's Memorial,\n\nwhich have the effect of transformingthe dispute beforethe Court into a dispute of\n\na different character. The matter was addressed by the Court in its Judgment on\n\njurisdiction and admissibilityin the Nicaraguacase in the following terms in the\n\ncontext of its decision on whether an additional ground of jurisdiction may be\n\ninvoked during the courseof proceedings:\n\n\"An additional ground of jurisdiction may ... be brought to the\n\nCourt's attention later, and the Court may take it into account\n\nprovided that the Applicantmakes itclear that it intendsto proceed\n\nupon that basis ... and provided also that the result is not to\n\ntransform the dispute brought before theCourt by the application\n\ninto another dispute which is different in character (Société\n\ncommercialede Belgique, P.C.I.J., SeriesA/B, No.78, p.173).\n\n88. To the extent that a clause reservingto an applicant the right to amend or\n\nsupplementits applicationcannot be relied upon to invokean additionalground of\n\njurisdiction in circumstances in which this would transform the character of the\n\ndispute, it followsthat sucha clause cannotbe reliedupon as abasis for introducing\n\nnew claims whichwouldhave the sameeffect.\n\n89. In the light of the preceding analysis,Belgiumcontendsthat theCourt lacks\n\njurisdiction to consider the claims advanced for the first tirne in the FRY'S\n\nMemorialandlor that these new claims are inadmissible. These clairnsrelate to the\n\nallegations\n\n73See, for example,the Orderof the Courtin theApplicationof the Conventionon thePrevention\n\nand Punishmentof the Crime of Genocide, Provisionalasures, Order of 13 September 1993,\n\nI.C.J.

The allegations of facts which form the basis of these contentions are set\n\nout in particular in Part 1.5 of the FRYMemorial. Belgiurncontendsthat the Court\n\nlacks jurisdiction in respect of these allegations andlor that these allegations are\n\ninadmissible.\n\n75FRYMemorial,p.339,paragraph 3.2.11. Chapter Three\n\nCHAPTERTHREE: THE CONTEXTOF THE CASE\n\n91. Given the preliminary nature of the these proceedings, Belgium does not\n\njoin argument with the FRY on the substanceof its allegations. As already noted,\n\nwere the Court to decide that it has jurisdiction to hear this case and that the\n\napplication is admissible, Belgium would contest the allegations fully. While not\n\ntaking issue with the FRY's allegations, it may nevertheless assist the Court's\n\nappreciation of the matter for Belgium to set out briefly some salient contextual\n\nelementsrelevantto the case.\n\n92. As will be plain from the review of the FRY's case in Chapter One, the\n\nessence of the dispute raisedby the FRY against Belgiumconcerns the useof force\n\nby NATO in the FRY. The context within which this action occurred was the\n\nsituation in Kosovo. As was recognisedby the FRY, \"a full comprehensionof the\n\nhowever, requires an appreciation of the wider circumstances concerning\n\nevents in the former Yugoslavia. Chief amongst these are the dissolution of the\n\nSocialist Federal Republicof Yugoslavia (\"SFRY\") and the establishment of the\n\nFRY, the situation in Kosovo prior to 24 March 1999, elements concerning the\n\nNATO action in the FRY, and developments subsequentto the cessation of the\n\nNATO action on 10 June 1999. With the exceptionof the dissolutionof the SFRY\n\nand the establishmentof the FRY, which are addressed in detail in Chapter Four,\n\nthese matters are addressedbriefiy below.\n\n1. ThesituationinKosovopriorto 24 March1999\n\n93. Prior to the dissolutionof the SFRY, under its 1974Constitution, Kosovo\n\nwas defined as an autonomous province withinSerbia, one of the six republics\n\ncomprising the SFRY. This status was in recognitionof the fact that some 90 per\n\ncent of the populationof Kosovowas ethnicAlbanianin origin.\n\n94. The situation in Kosovo became a matter of urgent internationalconcern\n\nfrom at least 31 March 1998,the point at which the SecurityCouncil, acting under\n\nChapter VI1of the Charter, adoptedResolution 1160(1998) condemninginter alia\n\n\"the use of excessive force by Serbian police forces against civiliansand peaceful\n\ndemonstrators in Kosovo\".77 By this resolution, the Council imposed an arms\n\nembargo against the FRY and took various other steps designed to facilitate \"a\n\n7See paragrap41 above.\n\n7SlRESll160, 31 March1998. (Annex6) ChapterThree\n\nsolution of the Kosovoproblem\" in accordance with theproposals put forward by\n\nthe Contact Group of c~untries.~~The Council also requestedthe UN Secretary-\n\nGeneralto keep it regularly informedand to report on the situationin Kosovo.\n\n95. In adopting Resolution 1160(1998), the SecurityCouncil was responding\n\nto growing concernin the widerinternationalcommunityat the rapidly deteriorating\n\nhuman rights situation in Kosovo, a matter addressed by, amongst others, the\n\nOrganisationfor Security andCooperationin Europe (\"OSCE\").79\n\n96. Fursuantto the terms of Resolution 1160(1998), the UN Secretary-General\n\nreported regularlyon the situa.tionin Kosovo. These reports mark a steady decline\n\nin the human rights and humanitarian situationin Kosovo. Thus, in his initial\n\nReport on 30 April 1998, the Secretary-General expressed concern \"about the\n\ndeteriorating situation in Kosovo and the absence of progress in negotiations\n\nbetweenthe parties\"\n\n97. Reporting a month later, on 4 June 1998, the Secretary-Generalobserved\n\nthat\n\n\"the situation in Kosovo continuesto be extremely volatile and\n\nshows marked signsof deterioration. The armed confrontation in\n\nKosovo has led to loss of life and there is serious risk of a\n\nhumanitarian and refugee crisis in the area. In this regard, the\n\nmost recent Serbian police offensive inKosovo is particular cause\n\nfor alarm. 1 am gravely concerned that themounting violence in\n\nKosovo rnight overwhelm political efforts to prevent further\n\nescalationof the crisis. 1 deplore the excessiveuse of force by the\n\nSerbian police in Kosovo and cal1upon al1parties concerned to\n\ndemonstrate restraint and commit themselves to a peaceful\n\nsolution.\n\n98. The downwardspiral continued. Reportingon 2 July 1998, the Secretary-\n\nGeneral noted that \"the situation inKosovo has deteriorated significantly since the\n\nsubmissionof my last report\" and that \"[tlhe internationalcommunityis appalled by\n\n\" The Contact Groupwas composedof France, Germany, Italy, the Russian Federation, the United\n\nKingdomand the United States.\n\n79 See, for examplDecision218on the situationin Kosovo,adoptedut the specialsessionof the\n\nPermanent Counco ilf the Organisatior Securitand Cooperatioin Europe,on 11 March1998;\n\nS119981246,17March 1998.

In the face of these Reports, the President of the Security Council issued a\n\nStatement on 24 August 1998 in which the Council expressed its grave concern\n\n\"about the recentintense fightingin Kosovo which hashad a devastating impacton\n\nthe civilian population and has greatly increased the numbers of refugees and\n\ndisplaced persons.\"85 This was followed,on 23 September1998,by the adoption of\n\nResolution 1199(1998)in which theCouncil againnoted its grave concern\n\n\"at the recent intense fighting in Kosovo and in particular the\n\nexcessive and indiscriminate use of force by Serbian security\n\nforces and the Yugoslav armywhich have resulted in numerous\n\ncivilian casualtiesand, accordingto the estimateto the Secretary-\n\nGeneral, the displacement of over 230,000 persons from their\n\nhomes\" .86\n\n100. Expressing its alarm at the \"impending humanitarian catastrophe\", the\n\nCouncil went on to affirm \"that the deteriorationof the situation in Kosovo,Federal\n\nRepublic of Yugoslavia, constitutes a threat to peace and security in the region\".\n\nActing under Chapter VI1of the Charter, the Council demanded inter alia that the\n\nFRY \"cease al1action by the security forces affecting the civilian population and\n\norder the withdrawalof securityunitsused for civilian repression\" .87\n\n101.

In the face of some progress towards a peaceful settlementof the situation\n\nin Kosovo, the Security Council adopted Resolution1203 (1998) on 24 October\n\n1998 endorsingand supporting agreementssigned betweenthe FRY and the OSCE\n\nand the FRYand NATOconcerningthe verificationof complianceby the FRY and\n\nothers in Kosovo with the requirements of Resolution 1199 (1998). By this\n\nResolution, the Council, acting under Chapter VI1of the Charter, demanded \"the\n\nfull and prompt implementationof these agreements by the Federal Republic of\n\nYugoslavia\" .89\n\n103. By late December 1998, these initiativestowards a peaceful settlementhad\n\nal1but broken down. Reportingon Christmaseve, the Secretary-General notedthat\n\n\"the situation inKosovohas notsignificantly improvedand there are alarming signs\n\nof potential deterioration\" .gO By mid-January 1999, this \"potential deterioration\"\n\nhad become a reality. Reporting on 30 January 1999, the Secretary-General noted\n\ninter alia that \"[slince late December, more than 20,000 people have fled from\n\nsome 23 villages in the four rnunicipalitiesof Decane, Podujevo, Stirnljeand Suva\n\nReka\" .9'Addressing thebroader picture, the Secretary-Generalwenton to note that\n\n\"[alt the start of 1999, UNHCR estimated that some180,000 civilians remained\n\ndisplacedwithinKosovo,the vastmajorityof whomare KosovoAlbanians\" .92\n\n104. More troubling was the Secretary-General's assessment of the\n\ntransformationof the nature of the violencein Kosovo duringthe last weeks of 1998\n\nand thefirst weeksof 1999:\n\n\"The most disturbing new element is the spread of violence in\n\nKosovo and the transformation of the nature of that violence.\n\nPrior to the ceasefire hostilitieswere limited tocertain geographic\n\nlocations, with fluid lines of engagement, although sniperfire did\n\noccur sporadically outside the discrete areas of encounter. In\n\nmany cases, the civilian population fledfrom threatened locations\n\nto areas of perceived relative safety, some to urban areas within\n\nKosovo butmany others to exposed conditions withpoor access to\n\nshelter and food.

Calculatedacts of violence followed\n\nby retaliatory measures now occur frequently in citiesthat, until\n\nwinter, had been notably exempt from violence, even during the\n\ninflux of internally displacedpersons into urbanreas whose social\n\nresources were already overtaxed. With the exceptionof some\n\nisolated incidents, the resident communities of Kosovo's large\n\nmulti-ethniccities, where most of its population resides, have not\n\nturned violently upon each other. However, targeted acts of\n\nviolence and growing expressions of public rage during the past\n\nmonthmight seriouslythreatenpeace in urban areas. \"93\n\nOne of the worst examples of the atrocities comrnittedwithin this period\n\n105.\n\nwas the massacre of 45 Kosovo Albanian civilians in the village of Racak on 15\n\nJanuary 1999.\n\n106. In response to the eventsin Racak, the President of the Security Council\n\nissueda Statementon 19January 1999 interaliain the followingterms:\n\n\"The Security Councilstrongly condemnsthe massacreof Kosovo\n\nAlbanians in the village of Racak in Southern Kosovo, Federal\n\nRepublic of Yugoslavia, on 15 January 1999, as reported by the\n\nOrganisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)\n\nKosovo Verification Mission(KVM). It notes withdeep concern\n\nthat the report of the KVM states that the victims werecivilians,\n\nincluding women andat least one child. The Council also takes\n\nnote of the statement by the Head of the KVM that the\n\nresponsibility for the massacre lay with the Federal Republic of\n\nYugoslavia security forces, and that uniformed membersof both\n\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia armed forces and Serbian\n\nspecialpolicehad been in~olved.\"~~\n\n107. In the faceof this deteriorating situation,and in a further attempt toachieve\n\na peaceful resolutionto the situation in Kosovo, the Contact Group of countries\n\nsummoned representatives of the FRY and the Kosovo Albanian community to a\n\nconference at Rambouillet, France in early February 1999.

Throughoutthe period under consideration,NATO worked closely with the\n\nUN Security Council and Secretary-General and the OSCE in respect of the\n\nsituation in Kosovo. Thisinvolvementwas contemplatedby the Security Council\n\nfrom the outset, albeit in general terms, in Resolution 1160 (1998) insofar as it\n\nrequested \"the Secretary-General, in consultation with appropriate regional\n\norganisations\" to include in his first report on the situation in Kosovo\n\n\"recomrnendationsfor the establishmentof a comprehensive regimeto monitor the\n\niinplementationof the prohibitionsimposedby this resolution\" .96\n\n110.

In the light of the sharply deteriorating situation in Kosovo and continued\n\nnon-complianceby the FRY with the requirements of Security Council Resolution\n\n1199 (1998)and other relevantresolutions, NATO notifiedthe FRY on a number of\n\noccasionsof its resolve to take militaryactionto addressthe situationin the event of\n\na continued failure by the FRY to fulfil its internationalcommitments. Thus, for\n\nexample, in a letter dated 30January 1999from the NATO Secretary-Generalto the\n\nPresident of the FRY, NATO identified various steps required of the FRY to\n\naddress the situationin Kosovoand continued:\n\n\"Ifthese steps are not taken, NATO is ready to take whatever\n\nmeasures are necessary in the light of both parties' compliance\n\nwith international commitmentsand requirements, including in\n\nparticular assessmentby the Contact Group of the response to its\n\ndemands, to avert a humanitarian catastrophe, by compelling\n\ncompliance with the demandsof the international communityand\n\nthe achievement of a political settlement. The Council has\n\ntherefore agreed today that the NATO Secretary-General may\n\nauthorise air strikes against targets on territory of the Federal\n\nRepublicof Yugoslavia. 'y99\n\n113. In the light of the continuedfailure by the FRY to take steps to address the\n\nsituation in Kosovo, NATO commenced military action in the FRY on 24 March\n\n1999.

NATO, a politicaland military alliance establishedin accordance with the\n\nprinciples of the UN Charter, was created by the North Atlantic Treaty of April\n\n1949. It is currently composed of 19 members - Belgium, Canada, the Czech\n\nRepublic, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy,\n\nLuxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, the\n\nUnited Kingdomandthe UnitedStates.\n\n99S/1999/107*,3February 1999, atp.4, paragraph 5.

In its Provisional Measures Order, the Court observed that it can exercise\n\njurisdiction \"only between Statesparties to a dispute who not only have access to\n\nthe Court but also have accepted thejurisdiction of the Court, either in general form\n\nor for the individual disputeconcerned 7.113 As this recognises,access to the Court,\n\nor an entitlementto appear, is a condition precedentto any question arising as to the\n\nCourt'sjurisdiction in a particular case.\n\n122. Access to the Court is controlledby the UN Charter and the Statute of the\n\nCourt. Pursuant to Article 93(1) of the Charter, \"[al11Members of the United\n\nNationsare ipsofacto parties to the Statute\" of the Court. Pursuant to Article 93(2)\n\nof the Charter,\n\n\"[a] State which is not a member of the United Nations may\n\nbecome a party to thc Statute of the InternationalCourt of Justice\n\non conditions to be determined in each case by the General\n\nAssemblyupon the recornrnendationof the SecurityCouncil. \"\n\n123. In the lightof these provisions, the Statute lays down thecircumstances in\n\nwhich the Court \"shall be open\" to States. Pursuant to Article 35(1) of the Statute,\n\nthe Court is open to \"the Statesparties to the present Statute\". Pursuant to Article\n\n35(2), \"[tlhe conditionsunder which the Court shall be open to other States shall,\n\nsubject to the special provisions containedin treaties in force, be laid down by the\n\nSecurity Council\" .\n\n124. Acting pursuant to the powers conferred upon it by Article 35(2) of the\n\nStatute, the Security Council adopted Resolution9 on 15 October 1946. This\n\nrequires thedepositof a declarationaccepting thejurisdictionof the Court as well as\n\ncompliancewithother specifiedconditions.\n\n125. The institutionof proceedings by a state which is not party to the Statute\n\nbut which has accepted the jurisdiction of the Court by a declaration made \"in\n\naccordance with any resolution adopted by the Security Council\" under Article\n\n35(2) of the Statute is addressedby Article 41 of the Court's Rules. This provides\n\nIlProvisionalMeasuresOrder,atparagraph20.\n\n41 ChapterFour\n\nthat the institution of proceedings \"shall be accompanied by a deposit of the\n\ndeclaration in question, unless the latter has previously been deposited with the\n\nRegistrar\" .\n\n126. As these provisions make plain, accessto the Court by a state is dependent\n\nupon (a) membership of the United Nations, or (b) the state in question being\n\notherwise a party to the Statute on conditions determinedby the General Assembly\n\nupon the recommendationof rhe Security Council, or (c) in the case of a state not\n\nparty to theStatute, compliance with the termsof Article 35(2) of the Statute.\n\n127. Of these bases of access to the Court, the FRY contends sirnplythat it is a\n\nmemberof the UnitedNations.\n\n128. In Belgium's contention, the Court is not open to the FRY on any of the\n\nbases just enurnerated. The FRY is not a memberof the United Nations. The FRY\n\nis not otherwise a partyto the Statuteof the Court pursuant to Article 93(2) of the\n\nCharter. The FRY has not depositeda declaration acceptingthe jurisdiction of the\n\nCourt pursuant to the terms of Article 35(2) of the Statute, Security Council\n\nResolution 9 (1946) andArticle 41 of the Court's Rules. Nor does the reference to\n\n\"treaties in force\" in Article 35(2) of the Statute provide a basis of access to the\n\nCourt by the FRY in this case. Each of these elementsis addressedfurther below.\n\n129. Absent an entitlement to appear, the Court lacks jurisdiction ratione\n\npersonae. As this is a condition precedentto any question arising as to the Court's\n\njurisdiction in a particular case, the questionof whether the Court has jurisdiction\n\nrationemateriaeor rationetemporisdoesnot arise.\n\n1. TheFRYis not a memberof the United Nations\n\n130. The FRY asserts that it is a party to theStatuteof the Court.ll4 The basis\n\nfor this assertion is the contention that the FRY is a member of the United\n\n~ations.\"' Although this is not expressly stated in the FRY'S pleadings, this\n\ncontention rests on the"
