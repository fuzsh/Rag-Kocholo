        "text": "By BOB FLAHERTY\n\nSpecial to The Republican\n\nHATFIELD - “Whoa!” said art director Tom Gale, who was seeing a spinning, spewing Fire Cactus on his monitor for the first time. The creature nearly consumed the characters he was trying to navigate through a plethora of computer-generated peril.\n\n“That’s pretty cool.”\n\nGale was “shoveling content” into a down loadable version of the video game” Fate: The Cursed King,” processing disparate elements from remotely loaded digital files into the game to see how effectively they’d interact.\n\n“When you sit down, you might see lots of new items,” he said, “new monsters, new abilities, new spells and animator’s effects. I spent hours last week listening to screams and howls.”\n\nMention games in bucolic Hatfield and one might think of legendary coach Sherry Webb and her Smith Academy field hockey teams, or maybe pitch at the senior center. But the agrarian community is home to a major player in the $3 billion-and-climbing video game industry.\n\nHitPoint Studios, headquartered since October 2009 in a converted farmhouse on a quiet residential street, surrounded on three sides by trees, fields and farms, was founded in 2008, a merger of Aaron St. John’s Golden Goose Games of Amherst and paul hake productions of Greenfield. Hake, 28, majored in computer science and art at the University of Massachusetts, with a concentration on 3D animation and modeling.\n\n“I knew I wanted to start my own production company after school,” he said. “I needed the skills to do that.”\n\nAfter a few months working at Hasbro, Hake launched his company in 2006. “Just me and couple of contractors.”\n\nCompany growth was rapid, at roughly the same pace as St. John’s.\n\n“We were doing the same sort of thing - multimedia game production,” said Hake. “Aaron and I knew each other at UMass and had done a couple of projects together. But the size and quantity got so big, we pooled our resources.”\n\nAfter the two agreed to merge, they met at the Blue Heron Restaurant in Sunderland to come up with a name. “We both brought 20 different names,” said Hake, but HitPoint, an old Dungeons and Dragons term, stuck.\n\nThe HitPoint team has designed, developed and produced more than 30 games, ranging from Flash-based viral marketing games to traditional retail-distributed games, and has skilled team members in all aspects of game and web design, 3D graphics, animation, programming and music and sound production.\n\nGiant dry-erase whiteboards hang in offices all over the building for brainstorming purposes. If an idea shows promise, they draw a square around it, meaning: Don’t erase!\n\nA sign on the wall outside St. John’s office says: “Make the first 30 minutes sexy.” A few feet away, another reads: “Make the first 2 minutes DAMN sexy.”\n\n“When we’re building our games, this is the hot zone,” said St. John. “The idea is that people will be hooked on the game in the first two minutes and reaching for their credit card by the 30-minute mark. It’s the rule for any game.”\n\nSt. John then spontaneously picked up an iPad and began playing a recently converted version of “Gun Bros.”\n\nSt. John, 33, also runs his own company from the Hatfield office, Immortal, which specializes in Facebook games.\n\n“These are casual, female-friendly games,” he said. “Most fantasy games are geared to teen buys. This is a crossover audience and not as violent.”\n\nSt. John is the younger brother of Alex St. John, who co-developed DirectX, which evolved into XBox, so he knows a lot of heavy hitters in the field. A lot of the work HitPoint gets is a direct result of St. John’s pitching to major producers at conventions.\n\nAdvergames, interactive games developed specifically for corporate clients to raise product awareness on websites or on Facebook, make up a lot of HitPoint’s business.\n\nSenior designer Pat King is working on a segment of the studio’s newest advergame, “World’s Manliest Rituals,” which shows some guy engaging in “the running of the ostriches.”\n\nAt King’s left is a keyboard and microphone; he will incorporate his own music and voices into the mix, sparing the firm, in this instance, from having to contract outside talent.\n\n“It makes for an interesting project and a lot of fun,” said King. “People engage with these games a lot longer than the average TV spot.”\n\n“World’s Manliest Rituals” recently won a MIXX Award for the AXE/Unilever “Double Pits to Chesty” campaign, which received more than 20 million gameplays worldwide last year.\n\nOne of HitPoint’s major clients is HipSoft, the firm that licenses the Build-a-lot series.\n\n“We approached them in Seattle with a variety of pitches,” said Hake, “underwater versions, outer space versions, even a Monopoly version of Build-a-lot. Then we pitched the concept of an Elizabethan-era game. It required a bit of research - the geography of Great Britain of the times. Pat King and Tom Gale made some sketches, and we were on our way.”\n\nTheir “Build-a-lot: The Elizabethan Era” download game was in the top 10 on iWin.com and Gamehouse.com for more than a month, and it held the number-one sales spot for nearly a month on iWin.\n\n“It’s an enormous hit with women,” said St. John.\n\n“We pitched them a concept and created everything from the ground up,” said King. “Coming up with dialogue for Mr. Monopoly was some of the most fun I’ve ever had.”\n\nProject manager Dorinda Bell-Upp often serves as arbiter to artists and programmers. “They don’t always talk,” she said, “that left/right brain thing.”\n\nWith ideas constantly coming to life and Rage Against The Machine throbbing from speakers, being in the middle of this beehive of imagination is never boring. But the future is upon you before you can even process the present.\n\n“It’s such a changing industry,” said Bell-Upp. “It’s been said that six of the 10 most popular careers 10 years from now don’t even exist. I might be fetching coffee for robots.”\n\nHitPoint chose Hatfield for many reasons: They needed room to expand, the rent was reasonable, and they knew they’d have plenty of local, college-educated people for the hiring pool. The surroundings serve as inspiration. Employees stuck on a concept often need only to take a stroll around the nearby meadow, and they’re good to go.\n\n“Our publishers and partners are all in big cities, so our rural setting has distinguished our company from the development crowd,” said Hake. “They always ask us what’s growing outside our window, or how the free-range chickens are getting along.”\n\nEmployees couldn’t even enter the parking lot one day a couple months back. A very large turtle (Bell-Upp spreading her arms wide to show how big it was) blocked the way.\n\nThe ever-expanding firm has 17 full-time employees and 20 contractors and figures to double that in a year’s time. “Some projects come in, and we don’t have enough people,” said Hake.\n\nHitPoint is seeking new junior and senior Flash developers and digital-scene painters, and also needs developers for the mobile iOs and Android platforms.\n\nIts dream employee? “An engineer with a computer science degree and strong math skills,” said Hake, but stressed that there are intangibles that matter. “We socialize together, so you’ve got to be a person who fits in. Most importantly, you gotta like games!”\n\nThey’ve got plenty of space for growth, some 5,000 square feet of it. A ballroom-sized area downstairs, which is presently home to nothing more than a couple of couches and a Christmas tree, was put to good use the Friday before last at the company holiday party.\n\nSt. John went out and bought 30 state-of-the-art Nerf machine guns, and the employees, some meeting each other for the first time, spent a good many hours diving through the air and blowing each other away with spongy projectiles.\n\n“People who had the cool guns thought they were all hot until they ran out of batteries,” said designer Kevin Kohler, “so we beat up on ‘em.” Kohler’s brother Paul also works for the company.\n\nHake’s first full-time hire when he ran his own company was Christopher Gendron in 2006. Gendron is still with him.\n\nWith long black hair and kindly, dazzling, dark eyes, Gendron gives off the relaxed vibe of someone doing exactly what he was meant to do. When he’s not applying deft Photoshop strokes to a landscape or resizing artwork to fit into an iPhone, he’s working on his own invention for HitPoint, “Words inSpace,” a sort-of Tetris meets Boggle challenge.\n\n“I’ve been wanting to make games since I was a kid and get paid for it,” he said.\n\n“You’re not getting paid,” joked Hake.\n\n“I told my babysitter in second grade, ‘I’m gonna dream up games,’” said Gendron. “I only remember that because she was a real nice lady and she believed me.”\n\nAt a terminal across from “elder statesman” Gendron sits the company’s newest employee, Jerry Chan, who graduated from UMass in May and has been with the firm three weeks. He’s working on an advergame for diaper giant Huggies.\n\n“My assignment was to find a picture of a baby, cut up the baby - which seems so morbid - and animate it to a potty dance,” said Chan. If he’s laughing and his bosses are laughing, the client is sure to bust a gut, goes the theory.\n\n“We found a good rhythm to create these games,” said Hake. “We do it by staying on top of trends.”"
