All 3G and older devices must be upgraded to a 4G device to avoid loss of service. Please contact the IWIN Order Desk for assistance with equipment options at 866 791 2772 or IWIN.transition@illinois.gov.\n\nDoIT owns and manages the Illinois Wireless Information Network (IWIN) through a unique contractual partnership between the State of Illinois, Verizon Wireless, and Motorola. This network provides a fast, reliable and secure wide area data network to Federal, State, County and local government wireless users within Illinois who require mobile communications. With well over 5,000 units and 12,000 users spanning more than 400 communities, IWIN has grown to be the largest mobile data network in the country.\n\nEquipped with a laptop, portable computer or handheld device, a Verizon modem and Motorola's Premier MDC™ mobile data communications software, users can transmit and receive data using standard Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). Through Premier MDC™ software, data from the mobile users is digitized, encrypted and compressed. The data is then transmitted in \"packets\" using cellular towers to a Motorola message switch server maintained by the State of Illinois. This server links the remote user to the Law Enforcement Agencies Data System (LEADS) and other desired agency databases. The user receives real-time data in an easy-to-use Microsoft-Windows screen.\n\nImproved field operations, management effectiveness and secure interagency communications are just a few of the benefits of using IWIN. Using IWIN as a secondary means of communication also reduces radio channel congestion and enhances personal safety.\n\nService Levels and Metrics\n\nService Levels and Metrics\n\nService Fulfillment/Provisioning\n\nStaff will respond to service requests during the published business hours.
