        "text": "There has been a lot of discussion over the last couple of years regarding Disparate Impact and Fair Lending Testing, specifically in regard to the NCUA requiring credit unions to prove they are not treating members differently based upon being a member of one of the protected classes.\n\nWASHINGTON—Both credit union trade associations have made a list of top association lobbyists in Washington as published by The Hill, which covers politics.\n\nListed were NAFCU’s Dan Berger, CEO, and Brad Thaler, VP of Legislative Affairs (the 12th and seventh year in a row for each, respectively), as well as new CUNA CEO Jim Nussle.\n\nThe Hill described Nussle as a “former House Budget Committee chairman and Office of Management and Budget director” taking the reins at CUNA “where he’ll continue to fight against banks to save credit unions’ tax exemption.”"
