This can double, triple, or even quadruple your contribution! Our partial list of Bay Area corporations and foundations with matching gift programs is below.

If you find that your unlisted employer does offer a matching gift program, please let us know so that we can add them to our list.\n\nThank you!\n\n*Our list was compiled from other lists found online and may not be comprehensive or up to date, so please check with your employer.

Ask any of our grateful service dog recipients (See Testimonials), they will tell you it has been a LIFE CHANGER!\n\nHere are 9 reasons why donating is good-\n\n1. Experience More Pleasure\n\nDonating money simply makes you feel better, which is something we can all benefit from.\n\n2. Help Others in Need\n\nWhen you donate your money, you help others who need it.\n\n3. Get a Tax Deduction\n\nIf you give to an IRS-approved charity, you can write off donations on your tax return. Donating your cash is a great way to reduce the amount of money you send off to Uncle Sam, and for a good cause, to boot.\n\n4. Bring More Meaning to Your Life\n\nAny donation makes an impact! and can infuse your everyday life with more meaning. If you've been stuck in a rut, whether personally or professionally, sometimes the simple act of donating cash can do the trick and reinvigorate your life.\n\n5. Promote Generosity in Your Children\n\nWhen your kids see you donating money, they're much more likely to adopt a giving mindset as they grow up.\n\n6. Motivate Friends and Family\n\nBy giving, you can stroke passions in the folks around you, which is a very positive and tangible effect of your own giving.\n\n7. Realize that Every Little Bit Helps\n\nDollars add up and they all make a difference!\n\n8. Improve Personal Money Management\n\nIf you set a scheduled $100 donation each month , that can motivate you to be more attentive to your own finances. AND, see next section below to see if your company will match your donation!\n\n9. Give, If You Can't Volunteer\n\nThis might not necessarily be a positive effect of charitable giving, but if you're too busy to volunteer or can’t imagine being a puppy parent, then giving money is the perfect workaround. Writing out a check is a simple way to show you're willing to help others in any way you can."
