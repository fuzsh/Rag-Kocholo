        "text": "(FORTUNE Magazine) â€“ If you think of the Dow Jones industrial index as 20th-century and stodgy, you could well find yourself welcoming FORTUNE's e-50 index as millennial and fly. We want this assembly of companies to serve dependably as Wall Street's barometer of e-commerce, so we've chosen the constituents with utmost care. The list encompasses wildly ambitious startups like Global Crossing, which hopes its transatlantic network will serve as the backbone for entire e-industries, and old-timers like AT&T, which was founded in 1875, began trading publicly in 1900, and today gets about 20% of its revenue from data services. We've picked Internet auctioneer eBay, which operates with a skeletal staff of just 138 employees, and behemoth IBM, which has almost 300,000.\n\nDozens of dot-coms failed to make the cut. We eliminated companies that we deemed passing fads (the rejects shall remain nameless) in favor of promising startups like Razorfish, a new-generation consulting firm in Manhattan that eked out a $2 million profit in the past four quarters. In fact, more than half the companies here are profitable--remarkable, given that this is an e-list.\n\nThe most important shared attribute of the companies on these pages has nothing to do with margins or size. These companies get it: They understand the profundity of the Internet and its power to change business. We're confident you'll see interesting performance from them. So check 'em out.\n\n--Christine Chen\n\n[A]Revenue Four qtrs. ended 6/30 [B]Profits Four qtrs. ended 6/30 [C]Market cap As of 11/4/99 [D]Employees[1] [E]IPO date Year founded[2] [F]What makes it a FORTUNe-50 company\n\nALL FIGURES IN MILLIONS\n\nE-COMPANIES\n\n[A] [B] [C] [D] [E] America Online[3] $4,777 $762 $164,308 12,100 3/19/92 www.aol.com 1985 [F]With 19 million subscribers, AOL's the No. 1 online service and a Net predator, having gobbled CompuServe and Netscape.
