If you choose to participate in these promotions, we may ask you for information such as your name, email address, postal address and telephone number.\n\nSign up to receive electronic newsletters and promotional emails from us and our Affiliates (as such term is defined below), including new ideas, special offers and event information.

Â Such information may include, but is not limited to, network routing information (where you came from), equipment information (browser type), your IP address (which may identify your general geographic location or company), and date and time, clickstream information (when each ENDSTATE Web page was visited and how much time was spent on the page), product use and application data, or general geo-location data.

During setup, the ENDSTATE product will ask for your Wi-Fi network name (SSID) and password to connect to the Internet. It will save this information on the device, along with your IP address, so that you can access it and control it from your computer, smartphone or tablet, and so that it can communicate with our servers and download software updates. Once connected to your Wi-Fi network, your ENDSTATE product regularly sends the data described in this Privacy Statement (excluding your Wi-Fi password) to ENDSTATE to provide you with the applicable services.\n\nBluetooth data: Bluetooth-enabled ENDSTATE Products may broadcast an identifying signal wirelessly. This is used to connect with your Bluetooth-enabled devices (such as a smartphone or tablet) in order to deliver certain product features.\n\nQR Codes: We may use QR codes in connection with certain products, promotions, contests and special events. If you scan our QR code, you may get an invitation on your mobile device to join our mailing list.

The use of cookies and other tracking technologies is standard within Web sites and apps through which information is collected about your online activities across applications, Web sites, or other services (âSiteâ). More information about how we use cookies and similar technologies and how you can control and manage them is below. By continuing to use our Site, you acknowledge that you have seen our notification requesting your consent to use cookies and similar technologies as set forth in this Cookie Notice and that you have indicated your cookie and similar technologies preferences through our notification tool. By continuing to browse the Site, you are agreeing to our use of these cookies and similar technologies. This Cookie Notice should be read in conjunction with our Online Privacy Statement and Terms of Use which govern access to our Site in general.\n\nWhat is a cookie?\n\nA cookie is a small text file that is placed on a computer or other device and is used to identify the user or device and to collect information. Cookies are typically assigned to one of four categories, depending on their function and intended purpose: absolutely necessary cookies, performance cookies, functional cookies, and cookies for marketing purposes.\n\nTypes of cookies and why we use them\n\nAbsolutely necessary cookies: These cookies are essential to enable you to move around a Website and use its features. Without these cookies, services you have asked for, like completing forms on our Site, cannot be provided.\n\nPerformance cookies: These cookies collect information about how you use our Site. Information collected includes, for example, the Internet browsers and operating systems used, the domain name of the Website previously visited, the number of visits, average duration of visit, and pages viewed. These cookies only collect information in an aggregated format. Performance cookies are used to improve the user-friendliness of the Website and enhance your experience.\n\nFunctionality cookies: These cookies allow the Website to remember choices you make (such as your username or ID, language preference, or the area or region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts, and other customizable parts of Web pages. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for, such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. These cookies cannot track your browsing activity on other Websites.\n\nTargeting and advertising cookies: These cookies track browsing habits and are used to deliver targeted (interest-based) advertising. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an ad and to measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. They remember that you have visited the Website and this information is shared with other organizations, such as advertisers.\n\nManaging cookies\n\nYou can manage Website cookies in your browser settings, and you always have the choice to change these settings by accepting, rejecting, or deleting cookies. If you choose to change your settings, you may find that certain functions and features will not work as intended on our Site. All browser settings are slightly different, so to manage cookies, you should refer to the relevant settings within your browser.\n\nWe understand that you may want to know more about cookies. Here are some useful resources that provide detailed information about types of cookies, how they are used, and how you can manage your cookie preferences: www.aboutcookies.org Â or www.allaboutcookies.org. Please click below for detailed information on how to disable and delete cookies in some commonly used browsers:\n\nWe may use certain other tracking technologies in addition to cookies\n\nLocal shared objects/Flash cookies: Flash cookies, also known as local shared objects, are designed to support browser content supported by AdobeÂ® Flash. They are usually used to enable ads and video content on Websites. Like other cookies, they will store information on your device, some of which will be specific to the Flash-enabled content. Flash cookies can only be deleted within Adobe Flash rather than via your browser. Please refer to the following help page for information on how to manage your privacy settings and deletion of Flash cookies:\n\nWeb beacons: Our Site may contain electronic images known as web beacons (also called single-pixel gifs and transparent graphic images) that we use to help deliver cookies on our Site, count users who have visited our Site, deliver services, and analyze the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns, for example. We may also include web beacons in our marketing email messages to determine whether an email is opened or if links are clicked. Web beacons are also used to deliver you interest based advertising (discussed in more detail at the end of this Cookie Notice).\n\nâ\n\nWeb server & application logs: Our servers automatically collect certain information to help us administer and protect the Site, analyze usage, and improve usersâ experience. The information collected includes:\n\nIP address and browser type\n\nDevice information including Unique Device Identifier (UDID), MAC address, Identifier For Advertisers (IFA), and similar identifiers we or others may assign\n\nDevice operating system and other technical facts\n\nThe city, state, and country from which you access our Site\n\nPages visited and content viewed, stored, and ordered\n\nInformation or text entered\n\nLinks and buttons clicked\n\nURLs visited before and after you use our Site\n\nWeb Analytics Services\n\nThis Site uses the Google Analytics web analysis service and enters into an agreement with Google as the data processor. Google Analytics stores a persistent cookie on your hard drive. The information in this cookie (including your IP address) is transmitted to Google and stored on Google servers. Google uses this information to anonymously analyze your use of the Site, compile reports on your Site activity for Site operators, and provide other services related to your Site activity and Internet usage. Google may transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law or where those third parties process the information on Google's behalf. To our knowledge, Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. By using this Site, you consent to Google's processing of data about you. For a review of Googleâs Privacy Policy please see https://policies.google.com/privacy. You can opt out of aggregation and analysis of data collected by Google Analytics at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.\n\nLocation Based Services\n\nWe and our service providers may collect, use, and share the physical location of your device and use it to provide you with personalized location-based services or content. Where available, location-based services may use GPS, Bluetooth, and your IP Address, along with crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower locations, and other technologies to determine your deviceâs approximate location. In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such use of your device's location, but if you choose to deny such use, we may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services or content.\n\nâDo Not Trackâ Signals\n\nSome browsers transmit Do Not Track (DNT) signals to Websites. Due to the lack of a common interpretation of DNT signals throughout the industry, we do not currently alter, change, or respond to DNT requests or signals from these browsers."
