        "text": "No wonder tech customers are in hiding. They are under assault from hordes of software companies that don't deserve to exist. It's time for a shakeout--but who's gonna do the shaking?\n\nDavid Guzm치n buys software for a living. He likes the stuff, but even he can't stand how many makers are trying to sell it to him these days. As chief information officer for medical supply distributor Owens & Minor, he spends millions on software, making him a prime target for hordes of desperate salesmen.\n\nHe gets hundreds of pitches every week from a mind-boggling array of vendors. Some 549 publicly held software makers market their wares, plus hundreds more private shops that few people ever hear of. In the past year Guzm치n has quadrupled the size of his voice-mail in-box to 140 calls--and still it jams up with unsolicited come-ons. He gets another 500 e-mails a day, mostly from software outfits that are unknown to him. His assistant spends most of her time clearing out the clutter.\n\nGuzm치n doesn't even bother scanning the piles that arrive by messenger and mail, shunning the letters and brochures and even the gifts--chessboards with pieces intentionally withheld, golf clubs with a missing putter, a free cruise. \"My idea of the ideal cruise,\" he says, with obvious sarcasm, \"is being cloistered out on the ocean with hundreds of vendors, a long swim away from shore.\" He adds: \"Nothing will get through to me. It's a stack every day--I ignore it every day.\"\n\nIn a normal world, it would not be this bad. The software business should be a field of corpses by now, buried by a long downturn in business spending, and freeing the David Guzm치ns of the world to choose among the thinning ranks of healthy and relevant survivors. Yet two years into the biggest bust in high-tech history, an estimated 10,000 public and private software firms still do business. They all want a piece of a shrinking pie. Software spending is in decline after years of fervid growth, down 6% this year to $75 billion globally, according to research firm Meta Group.\n\n*Earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation. **Cash divided by operating income, times 12. Sources: Market Guide via FactSet Research Systems; company reports.\n\nBuilt to Last?\n\nThese software firms have enough cash to last a while, but will anyone care? They're losing money, growth for most is iffy, and corporate buyers are numbed by lookalike sales pitches.\n\nCompany\n\nLATEST 12 MONTHS\n\nBurn\n\nPrice/\n\nMarket\n\noperating\n\nsales\n\nsales\n\nrate**\n\ncash\n\nvalue\n\nincome*\n\n($mil)\n\ngrowth\n\n(months)\n\n($mil)\n\nAltiris\n\n$-5.6\n\n$48\n\n243%\n\n149\n\n3.0\n\n$212\n\nCompuware\n\n-132.8\n\n1,625\n\n-14\n\n24\n\n5.5\n\n1,485\n\nDigimarc\n\n-10.2\n\n46\n\n26\n\n46\n\n5.0\n\n199\n\nEpiphany\n\n-39.2\n\n96\n\n-1\n\n50\n\n1.6\n\n266\n\nEntrust\n\n-8.7\n\n110\n\n-20\n\n52\n\n5.3\n\n197\n\nI2 Technologies\n\n-261.0\n\n660\n\n-12\n\n20\n\n0.5\n\n216\n\nLegato Systems\n\n-25.5\n\n236\n\n5\n\n14\n\n14.2\n\n416\n\nMacromedia\n\n-34.3\n\n320\n\n-17\n\n34\n\n4.5\n\n438\n\nManugistics Group\n\n-35.4\n\n292\n\n16\n\n71\n\n0.8\n\n157\n\nRed Hat\n\n-21.6\n\n77\n\n-2\n\n160\n\n2.4\n\n705\n\nTibco Software\n\n-21.6\n\n280\n\n27\n\n64\n\n9.1\n\n1,040\n\nVignette\n\n-37.7\n\n297\n\n-19\n\n113\n\n0.7\n\n250\n\nWhat's needed is a good old-fashioned shakeout, a nasty but necessary part of a free market. But who is strong enough to do the shaking? Most stocks are so depressed that they're useless as currency. The only real software player--Microsoft, who else?--has $36 billion in cash but little inclination to go shopping. \"We're not on a buying spree,\" says Jeffrey Raikes, the Microsoft group vice president who runs the $9-billion-a-year business applications and services group.\n\nEven the professional dealmakers are loath to take a gamble on buying trouble. \"Can you spot value in this morass of carnage? The truth is, most of these companies should die,\" says James Davidson of Silver Lake Partners, a private equity firm in Silicon Valley.\n\nYet many teetering software houses are unlikely to simply go away and expire. Many of these firms hit it big during the boom, raising massive piles of venture money or hitting a homerun in an initial public offering. They have too much cash on hand to allow a quick and healthy consolidation, despite lagging sales and persistent losses (see table, above).\n\nThe overpopulation problem could continue for a while. It is bad for suppliers and a huge hassle for customers, who end up struggling with a kind of corporate incoherence. Motorola recently compiled an inventory of its in-house tech systems and found that the company had eight separate deals in the works with six rival vendors of corporate search engines. Yet headquarters had a standing deal with Inktomi for almost unlimited use of its version of the same thing. \"We killed the other eight, fast,\" says Toby Redshaw, Motorola's head of information technology strategy. \"I don't want any more software licenses we can't use.\"\n\nPaul Gaffney, chief information officer at the 1,440-store Staples chain, says almost half of the 30 to 40 calls he gets each day come from software hawkers pitching him products that have no clear connection to his business. \"It's like we don't have an agenda and are sitting around waiting for an opportunity,\" he says. \"So on blind pitches, I'm more likely to go with the larger technology providers.\"\n\nOther customers use the glut to grab better deals. At Putnam Lovell NBF, owned by National Bank of Canada, Chief Technology Officer Rodric O'Connor says, \"We've managed to save 30% on our software services costs,\" or $150,000 a year at the 150-person securities firm. Good for him, but bad for software sellers-and their shareholders.\n\nUpstart software makers, however, vow to keep scratching for survival. Interwoven, of Sunnyvale, Calif., has almost $200 million in the bank. \"Our cash can last a decade or longer,\" boasts John Van Siclen, chief executive. Interwoven sells document management software that lets companies troll through and categorize files and Web pages. Nice, but Interwoven hasn't been profitable in two years and similar stuff is peddled by at least two dozen rivals, including Microsoft and Oracle; five smaller direct entrants have a total of $776 million in cash.\n\nVan Siclen has laid off a quarter of his staff to combat losses that currently total 53% of revenues. Yet he would rather hold on to cash than try to absorb his competitors. \"You would make an acquisition if you think you can get a new technology. But no one cares; no one is buying,\" he says. \"You size the company appropriately to be able to run for many years.\"\n\nAt Nuance Communications, which makes \"voice-to-machine\" software that lets computers recognize or generate spoken words, Chief Executive Ronald Croen ticks off a partial list of other players: Tellme, SpeechWorks, BeVocal, HeyAnita, plus research arms and spinoffs from the likes of Lucent and Bt Group. \"I could give a list of 50 companies in the same business, but I can't follow them all,\" he says. But he is undaunted: Nuance has $150 million in cash from its two public offerings. \"Without market development or doing anything intelligent, we can still last four more years,\" says Croen, who recently announced he is looking for a successor.\n\nBut if everyone hangs on, nobody profits. Many in high tech fret over how long these firms will wait for each other to die-akin to a game of musical chairs or the last stand at the Alamo, depending on whether you are a watcher or a participant. \"This bottleneck has to get rationalized,\" says Terence Garnett, who invests in software for venture firm Venrock. \"How many do we need? One hundred software companies? Maybe--and a few small ones to feed things into them.\"\n\nThe weaklings are long on never-say-die attitude. Despite all the high-tech turmoil, a mere 63 publicly held software outfits have been acquired within the past two years. \"We've been going to the smaller companies to see if they'd consider putting themselves up for sale, but there's no sense of urgency,\" says Revell Horsey, managing director at Banc of America Securities.\n\nAt Convera, a Vienna, Va. provider of document search software, sales fell to $5 million last quarter and losses totaled $9 million. Seeking new business from government customers, the firm is trying to survive in a field cluttered with names like Inktomi, Divine and Autonomy, not to mention search giant Google. Still, Convera is holding out. \"We've been approached by buyers,\" says President Patrick Condo. \"It's a nice conversation, but valuations are much too low.\"\n\nBlame that on a dearth of buyers. Several software outfits have stock prices lower than the cash-per-share they have on hand--and even those firms don't incite much interest. \"The fact that they have cash doesn't help,\" says Bernard Liautaud, chief executive of Business Objects, a software shop with annual sales of $416 million. \"If they're losing a lot of money, they're virtually unacquirable. We don't want to ruin our profitability.\"\n\n*Earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation. NA: Not available, private company.
