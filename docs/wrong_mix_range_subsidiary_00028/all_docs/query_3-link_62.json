        "text": "Manhattan Associates (MANH) has 1 split in our MANH split history database. The split for MANH took place on January 13, 2014. This was a 4 for 1 split, meaning for each share of MANH owned pre-split, the shareholder now owned 4 shares. For example, a 1000 share position pre-split, became a 4000 share position following the split.\n\nWhen a company such as Manhattan Associates splits its shares, the market capitalization before and after the split takes place remains stable, meaning the shareholder now owns more shares but each are valued at a lower price per share. Often, however, a lower priced stock on a per-share basis can attract a wider range of buyers. If that increased demand causes the share price to appreciate, then the total market capitalization rises post-split. This does not always happen, however, often depending on the underlying fundamentals of the business.\n\nLooking at the MANH split history from start to finish, an original position size of 1000 shares would have turned into 4000 today. Below, we examine the compound annual growth rate — CAGR for short — of an investment into Manhattan Associates shares, starting with a $10,000 purchase of MANH, presented on a split-history-adjusted basis factoring in the complete MANH split history."
