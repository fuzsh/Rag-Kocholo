For more information about what cookies and pixel tags are, what they do, and how you can opt out of, manage, or delete them, please review this Cookie Policy.\n\nWhat Are Cookies and Pixel Tags?\n\n“Cookies” are small strings of text or computer code stored locally on your device that allow us and our service providers to identify your browser and/or device as you browse the Internet. Cookies can be placed, read, and/or written to by our Services, or other websites or services that recognize a particular cookie, which allows the website to “remember” or “recognize” a particular browser or device and, in some cases, store information about that browser or device.\n\nCertain types of cookies or cookie-like functionality may be placed or activated through browser add-ons, including, but not limited to, Adobe Flash. While these cookies are stored differently, their functionality and purpose is generally similar to other cookies.\n\nCookies are often used in conjunction with “pixel tags” (also known as “web beacons” or “clear gifs”). Pixel tags are small images that we, our analytics providers, and other third parties can use to interact with cookies and other tracking technologies. For example, we use pixel tags to evaluate the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns by determining whether you open and interact with the content in our promotional emails.\n\nHow Long Are Cookies Stored On My System?\n\nSession Cookies. “Session cookies” are stored for the duration of a browser session; when you close the browser, the cookie is deleted.\n\nPersistent Cookies. “Persistent cookies” are stored for a preset amount of time (often between 90 days and two years, depending on the application) and are typically not deleted when a browser session is closed.\n\nWhat Cookies Do We Use, and Why?\n\nEssential Cookies. Some cookies are essential to allow you to browse the Services and access certain pages. Essential cookies are required for the Services (or certain functionality on the Services) to work properly, and to remember information that you have provided or choices you have made on the Services, such as saving your logged-in status, site preferences, or the contents of your shopping cart.\n\nDisabling or removing these cookies may prevent the Services, or certain functionality(such as the shopping cart or store) on the Services, from working correctly or at all.\n\nAnalytics Cookies. We use performance and analytics cookies to collect information about how our users use and interact with the Services, such as what pages are visited most often, how the Services are used and function, or how users navigate the Services. We use this information to improve the Services and their content. Examples include:\n\nDisabling or removing these cookies generally does not interfere with the functionality or performance of the Services.\n\nThird-Party Functionality. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that third-party websites and services may use, and the information practices of those third-party website and services are not covered by our Privacy Statement or this Cookie Policy.\n\nFor example, we provide social media buttons on the Services that allow users to visit and share web pages through third-party social media platforms. We do not control how those platforms collect information about you, nor whether or how they may track you or may place and/or activate their own cookies and tracking technologies on your device.\n\nFor more information about how third parties collect and use information about your activities, please review their applicable terms of use and privacy policies.\n\nHow Do I Control or Make Choices About Cookies and Tracking Technologies?\n\nManaging Cookies. Most browsers automatically accept cookies by default, but you can adjust your device and/or browser settings to delete and/or block some or all cookies, or provide notifications when you receive a new cookie. Consult the “Help,” “Tools,” or “Preferences” menus on your browser, or the documentation for your device, for more information about how to do this. Please note, however, that blocking or deleting certain cookies may negatively affect your user experience.\n\nAdditionally, you can generally disable or delete cookies placed and used by browser add-ons, such as Adobe Flash cookies, by changing the add-on settings or visiting the website of its provider. Information and controls that allow you to manage Adobe Flash cookies may be found on this page:\n\nhttps://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html"
