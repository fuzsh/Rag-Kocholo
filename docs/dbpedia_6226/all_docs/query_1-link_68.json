        "text": "Police are appealing for the public’s help to identify the family of a man who died in Queen’s Park.\n\nParamedics took the man to hospital after he was found collapsed in Sixth Avenue at around 2.40am on October 6 last year. He died in hospital on October 16.\n\nOfficers were called and have carried out enquiries into the circumstances that resulted in his death. Based on these enquiries, the death is not being treated as suspicious.\n\nCCTV showed he was walking along the street when he collapsed. He was only wearing trousers and didn’t have any identification or personal belongings with him.\n\nIn the footage he is heard talking to himself in a foreign language, which investigators believe to have been Albanian.\n\nHe is described as being white, aged in his 40s, of slim build and between 5ft 7ins and 5ft 10ins tall. He had a shaved head, dark stubble and facial hair and brown eyes.\n\nDetective Sergeant Julia Morrow, from the local policing team in Westminster, said: “We have carried out a number of checks to attempt to identify the man, including checking the descriptions of any people who’ve been reported missing in the area, but we have still not been able to work out who he is.\n\n“We are working with the coroner to identify his next of kin and we releasing an image of a tattoo the man had on his inner left bicep in the hope that somebody may recognise it and come forward.\n\n“We are also releasing a computer-generated image of the man.”\n\nAnyone who can help is asked to call 101, quoting reference 23FOU006838.\n\nPictured top: An e-Fit of the unidentified man (Picture: The Met)"
