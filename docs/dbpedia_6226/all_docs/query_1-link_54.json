Police said they had been dead \"for some time\" before their bodies were discovered.\n\nHusband and father to the pair, Kuha Raj Sithamparanathan, 42, was found with stab wounds but despite treatment died at the scene.\n\nThey were found at 12.50am on Tuesday at a home in Golden Mile House, Clayponds Lane, following concerns for their welfare.\n\nNext of kin have been informed and post-mortem examinations are scheduled for Thursday.\n\nDetective Chief Inspector Simon Harding said: \"Although we are in the infancy of this investigation it appears that Poorna and Kailash had been dead for some time.\n\n\"This is a murder investigation and my team will work diligently to establish the sequence of events that led to their murders and the death of Kuha Raj Sithamparanathan.\n\n\"Our initial enquiries have established that Poorna and Kailash had not been seen or heard from for some time, perhaps since around the 21 September.\n\n\"We know the family often walked their dog, a poodle cross breed, in and around the local area and I would ask anyone who saw them at any time in the last month to contact police so we can begin to build a full picture of their lives.\"\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, resident Sheri Diba told reporters: \"I could not imagine someone is dead in this building. It's a very nice area, very nice building, I never had any problem. I'm really shocked.\"\n\nAnother resident of Golden Mile House said police had knocked on his door.\n\nThe 29-year-old, who has lived in the building for a couple of years, said he did not know the family but said the news was \"definitely shocking\".\n\n\"[Police] just said that a family had been found and wanted to check if we knew them or not.\n\n\"This kind of news is not something you expect, it's a very quiet and peaceful area,\" he said."
