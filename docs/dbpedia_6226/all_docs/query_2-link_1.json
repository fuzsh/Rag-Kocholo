        "text": "This guidance will help you decide how to check the identity of:\n\na customer\n\nan employee\n\nsomeone acting on behalf of a business\n\nYou can check someone’s identity:\n\ndigitally\n\nover the phone\n\nby post\n\nby email\n\nface to face\n\nBy successfully checking users’ identities, you can be confident that you’ll give the right people the right things.\n\nYou can also use this guidance to:\n\nunderstand how another individual or organisation checks someone’s identity\n\naudit and certify identity products or services\n\ncompare different identity checking processes with each other, for example schemes within the electronic identity and trust services (eIDAS) regulation\n\nThis guidance will not:\n\ntell you how to assess your risk of identity fraud\n\nbe relevant if you ask users for information about their identity but do not check it (also known as ‘self-assertion’)\n\nWhat is identity\n\nAn identity is a combination of ‘attributes’ (characteristics) that belong to a person.\n\nA single attribute is not usually enough to tell one person apart from another, but a combination of attributes might be.\n\nWhen to check someone’s identity\n\nYou should check someone’s identity if any services you or your organisation has will:\n\nshow a user personal information about themselves, such as their driving licence or passport details\n\ngive the user something\n\nWhy you should check someone’s identity\n\nThe number of identities being used to commit identity fraud in the UK is growing every year. Some of the most common reasons people or criminal groups commit identity fraud are to:\n\naccess services they’re not entitled to\n\nget benefits they’re not entitled to\n\nsteal personal, medical or financial information from other identities\n\nenable organised crime, like human trafficking\n\navoid being detected by the police and other authorities\n\nYou could be affected by identity fraud if you do not check someone’s identity. This includes being targeted by someone:\n\nusing a ‘synthetic’ (made up) identity\n\nwho is pretending to be someone else (an ‘impostor’)\n\nSynthetic identities can be fictional or based on a real identity. For example, someone who gives a false date of birth to access a gambling site is using a synthetic identity, even if their other details are correct.\n\nIf you follow this guidance, you’ll check identities in a way that’s consistent with other organisations or services that also follow it.\n\nChecking identities in a consistent way reduces the chances of one organisation or service doing less effective identity checks than another. This means there are fewer organisations or services that could be targeted by identity fraud.\n\nChecking identities in a consistent way means it’s also easier for you to trust and reuse an identity that’s been checked by someone else. This will mean:\n\npeople have to prove their identity less often\n\norganisations and services can share the cost of checking someone’s identity\n\nThis does not mean you have to check an identity in exactly the same way as another organisation or service. You can do different types of checks but still have the same level of confidence in someone’s identity.\n\nHow to check someone’s identity\n\nYou’ll need to know the ‘claimed identity’ of the person you’re checking. A claimed identity is a combination of information (often a name, date of birth and address) that represents the attributes of whoever a person is claiming to be.\n\nWhen you have this information, you can find out if the person is who they say they are. This process is known as ‘identity checking’ and is made up of 5 parts:\n\nget evidence of the claimed identity\n\ncheck the evidence is genuine or valid\n\ncheck the claimed identity has existed over time\n\ncheck if the claimed identity is at high risk of identity fraud\n\ncheck that the identity belongs to the person who’s claiming it\n\nYou do not have to do all parts of the identity checking process at once. You can do them over any period of time and gradually build up your confidence in an identity.\n\nYou’ll get a score for each part of the identity checking process you do. Do not add these scores up.\n\nLevels of confidence\n\nThere are 4 different levels of confidence:\n\nlow confidence\n\nmedium confidence\n\nhigh confidence\n\nvery high confidence\n\nBy reaching a level of confidence:\n\nyou’ll know how well your organisation or service is protected against identity risks\n\nyour identity checking process can be understood and reused by other organisations and services\n\nYou can reach a level of confidence by meeting an identity profile. The results of your service’s risk assessment will help you decide which level to meet. You should aim to get a higher level of confidence in someone’s identity if you or your service are at high risk of identity-related crime.\n\nYour confidence in someone’s identity can increase over time if you do extra checks or collect more evidence.\n\nIt can also decrease over time, for example if you later find out that evidence you used was lost or stolen at the time you checked that person’s identity.\n\nYou can also reuse identity checks done by another organisation if they do some or all parts of the identity checking process explained in this guidance.\n\nLow confidence in someone’s identity\n\nCompared to not doing any identity checks, having low confidence in someone’s identity will lower the risk of you accepting either:\n\nsynthetic identities\n\nimpostors who do not have a relationship with the claimed identity\n\nMedium confidence in someone’s identity\n\nHaving medium confidence in someone’s identity will protect you against the same things as low confidence. It will also lower the risk of you accepting impostors who have information about the claimed identity that’s not in the public domain.\n\nFor example, it would protect you against someone who works for the claimed identity’s employer’s HR department from using any information they have to impersonate the claimed identity.\n\nHigh confidence in someone’s identity\n\nHaving high confidence in someone’s identity will protect you against the same things as medium confidence. It will also lower the risk of you accepting impostors who:\n\nknow the claimed identity (this includes their close friends or family)\n\ndo not match the claimed identity’s photo or biometric information\n\nVery high confidence in someone’s identity\n\nHaving very high confidence in someone’s identity will protect you against the same things as high confidence. It will also lower the risk of you accepting impostors who are trying to look like the claimed identity, for example by wearing a mask or make up.\n\nAuthoritative sources\n\nYou might need to check things with an ‘authoritative’ source. To be authoritative for a particular piece of information, the source must make sure:\n\nthe integrity of the information is protected\n\nthe information is up to date\n\nThe source must also do one of the following:\n\nissue evidence, for example the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) issues evidence such as driving licences\n\nget information from an organisation that issues evidence, for example credit reference agencies can have authoritative information about bank accounts\n\nget information from another authoritative source, for example from another identity scheme\n\nGet evidence of the claimed identity\n\nYou can collect:\n\nphysical evidence of the claimed identity (such as an identity document, like a passport)\n\ndigital evidence of the claimed identity (such as information from a personal data store)\n\nYou can ask the user to provide the evidence or you can find it yourself, for example by checking a database. If you want to find the evidence yourself, you will need enough information about the claimed identity to be able to match it to their records.\n\nThis will prove that the identity exists, but it does not prove that it belongs to the person who’s claiming it. You must do a verification check to find that out.\n\nSome types of evidence are ‘stronger’ than others, which means they will be harder to:\n\nforge (when existing evidence is changed to make it look like it belongs to someone else)\n\ncounterfeit (when evidence is created from scratch)\n\nYou can check how strong evidence is by finding out:\n\nwhat security features protect it (for example a hologram or an electronic chip)\n\nwhat information it has\n\nhow the person’s identity was checked when the evidence was issued\n\nYou must make sure the evidence gives you all the information you need about the claimed identity. You might need to collect more than one piece of evidence to get this.\n\nYou must check and score one piece of evidence at a time. Do not add these scores up.\n\nThe stronger the evidence is, the higher its score will be. The highest score you can get for this part of the identity checking process is 4.\n\nWhy you should not accept a National Insurance number as proof of identity\n\nA National Insurance number is not evidence of the claimed identity. It is a reference number that can be used to match a record that relates to a claimed identity. It should not be accepted or used as proof of someone’s identity because:\n\na National Insurance number is not private and users share their National Insurance number for legitimate reasons, such as with their employer, pension provider or landlord\n\nusers cannot control what happens to their National Insurance number after it’s been shared and there are limited checks that bind the number to the claimed identity\n\nsome users get a National Insurance number automatically just before they turn 16 without needing to prove their identity first\n\nthere is a known use of National Insurance numbers as part of identity theft and fraud\n\nIf your organisation currently accepts National Insurance numbers as proof of someone’s identity, for example as part of an older system or process, you should:\n\nreview your process, assess the risks of accepting National Insurance numbers as proof of identity and make sure you comply with relevant privacy legislation\n\nevaluate the cost of changing your service to remove National Insurance numbers against the level of privacy risk, particularly if your service handles personal data\n\nconsider finding another way to confirm a user’s identity\n\nFind out more about National Insurance numbers.\n\nIf the user has changed their name\n\nThere are a number of reasons why someone’s name might be different on different pieces of evidence. For example, their surname might have changed when they got married.\n\nIf it looks like someone has changed their name, you might need to collect more evidence to make sure the evidence belongs to the same person. The combination of evidence you collect must match an identity profile for the level of confidence you need.\n\nYou should be aware that some users might have changed their name because of gender reassignment. If this happens, you must make sure you comply with section 7 of the Equality Act 2010 when you ask them for any evidence that includes their previous names.\n\nThe identity is also sometimes shown as a synonym on different pieces of evidence. For example, it might say the person’s name is Samantha on their passport, but Sam on their bank card.\n\nYou can usually accept a synonym unless you need to know the claimed identity’s ‘official name’. This is the name on any official documents they have, such as their passport.\n\nTransposition errors\n\nOther information might appear to be different on different pieces of evidence. These mistakes are known as ‘transposition errors’.\n\nThis can happen with:\n\nnames that have multiple parts, for example ‘Anna-Marie Jane’ might appear as ‘Anna Marie-Jane’\n\ndays and months in dates, for example ‘08.10.1978’ might appear as ‘10.08.1978’\n\ncenturies in dates, for example ‘1998’ might appear as ‘1898’\n\naddresses, for example ‘Flat 1a, 29 Acacia Road’ might appear as ‘Flat 29a Acacia Road’\n\nThese mistakes will not usually affect how you do this part of the identity checking process.\n\nScore 1\n\nThe evidence will have a score of 1 if it contains at least 2 of the following pieces of information:\n\nthe claimed identity’s name\n\nthe claimed identity’s date of birth\n\nthe claimed identity’s place of birth\n\nthe claimed identity’s address\n\nthe claimed identity’s biometric information (these are measurements of biological or behavioural attributes, like an iris or fingerprint)\n\na photo of the claimed identity\n\na reference number\n\nThe evidence should come from an organisation or person that you know will:\n\ncheck the claimed identity when they issue the evidence\n\nmake sure its process for issuing the evidence is not misused\n\nSome examples of evidence that will have a score of 1 include an email, PDF or letter from a local authority.\n\nScore 2\n\nThe evidence will have a score of 2 if it has everything it needs to get a score of 1 and includes information that’s unique to either:\n\nthe identity (for example the name and a photo of the claimed identity)\n\nthat piece of evidence (for example a reference number)\n\nThe organisation that issued the evidence must follow a published policy when checking the claimed identity.\n\nIf the evidence includes a name, it must show the person’s full name instead of any pseudonyms, aliases or nicknames.\n\nIf the evidence is a physical document, it must be protected by physical security features. These features will stop it from being reproduced without specialist knowledge or information.\n\nIf the evidence includes digital information, it must either be protected by:\n\ncryptographic security features that correctly identify the person or organisation that issued it\n\nprocesses that make sure only authorised users can create, update and access it\n\nSome examples of evidence that have a score of 2 include:\n\na Home Office travel document (convention travel document, stateless person’s document, one-way document or certificate of travel)\n\na birth or adoption certificate\n\nan older person’s bus pass\n\nan education certificate from a regulated and recognised educational institution (such as an NVQ, SQA, GCSE, A level or degree certificate)\n\na rental or purchase agreement for a residential property\n\na proof of age card recognised under the Proof of Age Standards Scheme (PASS)\n\na Freedom Pass\n\na marriage or civil partnership certificate\n\na gas or electric account\n\na firearm certificate\n\na ‘substantial’ electronic identity’ from a notified eIDAS scheme\n\nScore 3\n\nThe evidence will have a score of 3 if it has everything it needs to get a score of 2 and:\n\nit includes information that’s unique to both the identity and that piece of evidence\n\nwhoever issued the evidence made sure it was received by the same person who applied for it, for example it could be sent by secure delivery\n\nwhoever issued the evidence checked the claimed identity in a way that follows a standard or regulation that’s been approved or recognised by the UK government, such as the Money Laundering Regulations 2017\n\nIt must also:\n\ninclude the person’s official name instead of their initials or synonyms, for example ‘Julian’ instead of ‘Jules’ (if the evidence includes a name)\n\nbe protected by physical security features that stop it from being reproduced without specialist equipment (if the evidence is a physical document)\n\nThe evidence must also include one of the following:\n\na photo of the person\n\nbiometric information that uses cryptographic security features to protect its integrity\n\ncryptographic security features that can be used to identify the person who owns the evidence (this includes evidence with cryptographic chips and digital accounts that are protected by cryptographic methods)\n\nSome examples of evidence that will have a score of 3 include:\n\npassports that meet the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) specifications for machine-readable travel documents, such as a South African passport\n\nidentity cards from an EU or European Economic Area (EEA) country that follow the Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004 standards\n\nUK photocard driving licences\n\nEU or EEA driving licences that follow the European Directive 2006/126/EC\n\na Northern Ireland electoral identity card\n\na US passport card\n\na bank, building society or credit union current account (which the claimed identity can show by giving you a bank card)\n\na student loan account\n\na credit account\n\na mortgage account (including buy to let mortgage accounts)\n\na digital tachograph driver smart card\n\nan armed forces identity card\n\na proof of age card recognised under PASS with a unique reference number\n\na loan account (including hire purchase accounts)\n\na ‘high’ electronic identity from a notified eIDAS scheme\n\nScore 4\n\nThe evidence will have a score of 4 if it has everything it needs to get a score of 3 and:\n\nit includes biometric information\n\nall digital information (including biometric information) is protected by cryptographic security features\n\nthe cryptographic security features can prove which organisation issued the evidence\n\nwhoever issued the evidence proved the claimed identity by comparing and matching the person to an image of the claimed identity from an authoritative source\n\nSome examples of evidence that will have a score of 4 include:\n\nbiometric passports that meet the ICAO specifications for e-passports, such as a UK passport\n\nidentity cards from an EU or EEA country that follow the Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004 standards and contain biometric information\n\na UK biometric residence permit\n\nCheck the evidence is genuine or valid\n\nIf you want to prove someone’s identity using information that’s based on physical evidence, you must check it’s genuine. This means that the evidence is unlikely to be forged or counterfeit.\n\nIf you’re using digital evidence, you must check the cryptographic security features instead.\n\nYou can also check if the evidence:\n\nis valid (this means you can find records that show the evidence has been issued)\n\nhas been cancelled or reported as lost or stolen\n\nhas expired\n\nYou can check the evidence in person or remotely.\n\nThe highest score you can get for this part of the identity checking process is 4.\n\nSome evidence may:\n\nhave expired, but still be acceptable as identity evidence\n\nhave expired and will not be acceptable as identity evidence\n\nnot have an expiry date\n\nIf you accept expired documents or evidence that does not have an expiry date, you should complete and score the validity checks in the same way as described for a document that has not expired.\n\nBefore accepting expired identity evidence, you must consider:\n\nwhether it is lawful for a user to have and use it (for example, an expired UK driving licence cannot be used for any purpose)\n\nany legislation or guidance relevant to the purpose of the identity check\n\nYou should complete a risk assessment to assess:\n\nhow long you should accept an expired document after its expiry date\n\nthe likelihood of the expired document being lost, stolen or used by someone else\n\nthe strength of the expired identity evidence, for example whether the security features are sufficient to protect it from being forged or counterfeited\n\nScore 1\n\nThe evidence will have a score of 1 if it appears to be genuine.\n\nThe person checking the evidence must be able to confirm:\n\nthey’re checking an original, certified copy or scan of the evidence\n\nthere are no errors on the evidence, like wrong paper type, spelling mistakes, irregular use of fonts or missing pages\n\nthe details, layout or alignment of the evidence look the way they should\n\nany logos look the way they should\n\nany references to information are the same across the evidence (for example if the body text of a letter references an address, this should match the address shown at the top of the letter)\n\nScore 2\n\nThe evidence will have a score of 2 if you make sure it has not expired and you can confirm any of the following:\n\nthe evidence is valid\n\nthe visible security features are genuine (these are security features that can be seen without using specialist light sources)\n\nthe ultraviolet (UV) or infrared (IR) security features are genuine\n\nConfirm the evidence is valid\n\nThe person or system doing the check can confirm the evidence is valid by making sure the details on it match those held by an authoritative source.\n\nConfirm the visible security features are genuine\n\nIf the evidence is being checked in person, whoever is doing the check must make sure:\n\nthe original evidence has been shown\n\nthey do not accept scans, photos, or photocopies of the evidence (this is because it can be difficult to tell if these have been forged or counterfeit)\n\nThe evidence must always be shared in a way that protects it from being tampered with. For example, it could be sent by secure delivery if it’s being checked in person.\n\nIf the check is being done remotely, the image or video of the evidence must be clear enough for the system to examine its security features.\n\nThe image or video must be taken at the same time the check is being done. The user cannot upload an image or video of the evidence that they’ve taken before.\n\nThey should check this using non-specialist light sources such as natural sunlight, indoor lights or desk lamps.\n\nThe person or system will need to use official templates to check any of the following features on the evidence look the way they should:\n\nbackground printing\n\nfonts and alignment\n\nholograms and positioning\n\nthe way it’s been laminated\n\ndesigns printed with optical variable ink (and check they look the way they should at certain angles)\n\nthe format of any ‘compound identifiers’, such as a Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) driver number or a machine-readable zone (MRZ)\n\nthe position of any photographs on the evidence (they should not have been replaced or edited)\n\nSome places where you can find official templates are:\n\nthe Public Register of Authentic travel and identity Documents Online (PRADO)\n\nthe EU and EEA driving licence handbook\n\nEdisonTD\n\nIf the evidence is being checked by a person, they must:\n\nbe trained in how to detect false documents by a specialist trainer, such as the Home Office, National Document Fraud Unit, Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) or any other company that follows the Home Office’s best practice guidance\n\nrefresh their training at least every 3 years\n\nIf the evidence is being checked by a system, it must:\n\nhave been built following good practice, such as the Home Office’s guidance on identification document validation technology\n\nupdate the templates it checks the evidence against at least every 3 years\n\nConfirm the UV or IR security features are genuine\n\nThe person or system doing the check will need to use a UV or IR light to make sure:\n\nthe paper the evidence is printed on looks the way it should\n\nthe alignment of the evidence looks the way it should\n\nany fluorescent features (such as fluorescent inks or fibres) look the way they should\n\nthe evidence has not been tampered with (for example a UV light will show where UV features have been covered by glue if something has been stuck on the evidence)\n\nThe person or system will need to use official templates to check any of the following features on the evidence look the way they should:\n\nbackground printing\n\nfonts and alignment\n\nholograms and positioning\n\nthe way it’s been laminated\n\ndesigns printed with optical variable ink (and check they look the way they should at certain angles)\n\nthe format of any ‘compound identifiers’, such as a DVLA driver number or MRZ\n\nthe position of any photographs on the evidence (they should not have been replaced or edited)\n\nSome places where you can find official templates are:\n\nPRADO\n\nthe EU and EEA driving licence handbook\n\nEdisonTD\n\nIf the evidence is being checked by a person, they must:\n\nbe trained in how to detect false documents by a specialist trainer, such as the Home Office, National Document Fraud Unit, CPNI or any other company that follows the Home Office’s best practice guidance\n\nrefresh their training at least every 3 years\n\nIf the evidence is being checked by a system, it must:\n\nhave been built following good practice, such as the Home Office’s guidance on identification document validation technology\n\nupdate the templates it checks the evidence against at least every 3 years\n\nScore 3\n\nAny evidence protected by cryptographic security features will have a score of 3. You must make sure these security features are genuine.\n\nThe evidence can also have a score of 3 if you do all of the following:\n\nconfirm the evidence is valid or check the evidence has not been cancelled, lost or stolen\n\nconfirm any physical security features are genuine\n\ncheck the evidence has not expired\n\nConfirm the cryptographic security features are genuine\n\nTo make sure the cryptographic security features are genuine, the system that checks the evidence will need to:\n\nread the cryptographically protected information\n\nprovide any required cryptographic keys\n\ncheck the evidence has not expired\n\ncheck the digital signature is correct\n\nIt will also need to check the signing key:\n\nbelongs to the organisation that issued the evidence\n\nis the correct type for that evidence\n\nhas not been revoked\n\nConfirm the evidence is valid\n\nThe person or system will need to do the same checks to confirm the evidence is valid that are needed at score 2.\n\nCheck the evidence has not been cancelled, lost or stolen\n\nThe person or system doing the check will need to make sure the evidence has not been:\n\ncancelled by the organisation that issued it\n\nreported as lost or stolen\n\nThey can do this by checking an authoritative database of cancelled evidence, for example Interpol for passports or a mobile phone operator for mobile phone contracts.\n\nConfirm any physical security features are genuine\n\nThe person or system must do the same things needed at score 2 to confirm any visible security features are genuine. They must also confirm that any UV or IR security features are genuine.\n\nThey’ll also need to:\n\nuse evidence that has not been intercepted and reused (known as a ‘replay attack’)\n\nmake sure any shadows or glare do not stop the security features on the evidence from being examined\n\nupdate any official templates that are used (such as those from PRADO) every year\n\nrefresh their training in how to detect false documents every year (if the checks are being done by a person)\n\nThey must also confirm any:\n\ndesigns printed using intaglio (raised) ink look the way they should\n\ndesigns that have been laser etched look the way they should\n\nfeatures are consistent and correct across sections of the evidence\n\nTo check this, they must use one of the following:\n\na magnification tool, such as a magnifier\n\nother inspection equipment used to identify forged or counterfeit documents, such as a UV light\n\nScore 4\n\nThe evidence will have a score of 4 if you do all of the following:\n\nconfirm the visible security features are genuine\n\nconfirm the UV or IR security features are genuine\n\nconfirm the cryptographic security features on the evidence are genuine\n\ncheck the evidence has not been cancelled, lost or stolen\n\ncheck the evidence has not expired\n\nThe evidence will likely need to be checked in person to get a score of 4.\n\nConfirm the visible security features are genuine\n\nThe person or system must do the same things needed at score 3 to confirm the visible security features are genuine.\n\nThey’ll also need to:\n\nbe supervised when they capture and examine the evidence by someone who’s also been trained by a specialist trainer, such as the Home Office, National Document Fraud Unit, CPNI or any other company that follows the Home Office’s best practice guidance\n\nexamine the evidence under ‘controlled’ light conditions (this means the lighting in the room creates the best possible environment for examining the security features on the evidence)\n\nexamine the evidence under ‘controlled’ security conditions (this means there are ways to prevent systems from being fooled or people from being manipulated)\n\nThey’ll need to check the following features of the evidence look correct:\n\nwatermarks\n\nsecurity fibres\n\nconsistency throughout the evidence\n\nsecondary background (‘ghost’) images\n\nTo check this, they must use one of the following:\n\na magnification tool (such as a magnifier)\n\na low angle (‘oblique’) light\n\nother inspection equipment to identify forged or counterfeit documents\n\nConfirm the UV or IR security features are genuine\n\nThe person or system must do the same things needed at score 3 to confirm any UV or IR security features are genuine.\n\nConfirm the cryptographic security features are genuine\n\nThe person or system must do the same things needed at score 3 to confirm the cryptographic security features are genuine.\n\nCheck the evidence has not been cancelled, lost or stolen\n\nThe person or system must do the same things needed at score 3 to confirm the evidence has not been cancelled, lost or stolen.\n\nCheck the claimed identity has existed over time\n\nYou should check the claimed identity has existed over time. This will lower the risk of you accepting either:\n\na synthetic identity\n\nan identity that belongs to someone who’s died\n\nYou do not need to do this part of the identity checking process to meet all the identity profiles.\n\nThe highest score you can get for this part of the identity checking process is 4.\n\nYou should check if there are records that show the claimed identity has regularly interacted with other organisations or people. How many interactions you need to find will depend on if the organisation or person did an identity check during the interaction.\n\nSome examples of interactions include:\n\ncredit card transactions\n\ngas or electricity account payments\n\nsomeone signing in to an online bank or retail account\n\nsomeone travelling to another country\n\nhealth records\n\nemployment records\n\nschool records\n\nHow confident you can be that the claimed identity was involved in these interactions depends on if their identity was checked by the organisation or person they interacted with.\n\nFind out what identity checks have been done\n\nDifferent types of organisations and people will check identities in different ways.\n\nNot everyone will check someone’s identity when they interact with them. If you cannot find out what sort of identity checks they do, you can assume they do not do any. This means you will need to look for more interactions over a longer period of time.\n\nYou’re likely to find records of interactions between claimed identities and the following types of organisations. They might interact with other organisations that do identity checks in a different way.\n\nEducational organisations\n\nYou might find interactions between the claimed identity and an educational organisation, such as a school or college. You can be sure these types of organisations will have done some basic identity checks.\n\nFinancial organisations\n\nYou might find interactions between the claimed identity and a financial organisation, such as a bank or credit agency. You can be sure these types of organisations will have checked identity in a way that meets the requirements of the Money Laundering Regulations 2017.\n\nTravel companies or border or immigration authorities\n\nYou might find interactions that show the claimed identity has travelled to another country. Their identity will have either been checked by the company they travelled with, such as an airline, or by a border or immigration authority. The claimed identity’s physical appearance or biometric information would have been compared to an official identity document, such as a passport.\n\nScores\n\nThe score you’ll get will depend on:\n\nwhat type of identity checks the organisation or person did\n\nwhen the interactions you found took place\n\nYou’ll get a higher score if the identity has existed for a long time or it has been checked more thoroughly.\n\nInteractions over the last 3 months Interactions over the last 6 months Interactions over the last year Interactions over the last 2 years Interactions over the last 3 years Identity was not checked N/A N/A Score 1 Score 2 Score 3 Identity was checked following a published policy Score 1 Score 2 Score 3 Score 4 Score 4 Identity was checked following the Money Laundering Regulations Score 2 Score 3 Score 4 Score 4 Score 4 Physical appearance or biometric information was checked against an official source Score 3 Score 4 Score 4 Score 4 Score 4\n\nCheck if the claimed identity is at high risk of identity fraud\n\nYou should make sure the claimed identity is not:\n\nat a higher than usual risk of identity fraud\n\nsuspected to be a synthetic identity\n\nYou can do this by checking the details of the claimed identity with authoritative counter-fraud data sources, such as a national fraud database or databases managed by any other authoritative organisations.\n\nYou do not need to do this part of the identity checking process to meet all the identity profiles.\n\nThe highest score you can get for this part of the identity checking process is 3.\n\nScore 1\n\nYou’ll get a score of 1 if you use an authoritative source to check if the claimed identity:\n\nhas had its details stolen (even if those details have not been used fraudulently yet)\n\nhas been reported as stolen\n\nis suspected to be a synthetic identity\n\nYou must improve the way you do the ‘verification’ check if you find out any of these things have happened. If you suspect the claimed identity is a synthetic identity, you might also need to:\n\ndo more checks to get a higher ‘validity’ score for the evidence you have\n\ncollect more evidence of the claimed identity\n\nScore 2\n\nTo get a score of 2 you must do all the checks needed to get a score of 1. You must also use an authoritative source to check that the claimed identity:\n\nbelongs to someone who’s still alive\n\nis known by an organisation that should have a record of that person (for example an Electoral Registration Office in a local authority)\n\nis at a usual risk of being impersonated (for example a ‘politically exposed person’ like a politician or judge is at a higher than usual risk of being impersonated)\n\nYou must improve the way you do the ‘verification’ check if you get any information from the authoritative source that suggests these things are not true.\n\nScore 3\n\nYou’ll get a score of 3 if you use more than one authoritative source to do all the checks needed to get a score of 2.\n\nThe sources must also be ‘independent’, which means they’re either:\n\nseparate from the part of your organisation that checks the person’s identity\n\npart of a different organisation\n\nCheck that the identity belongs to the person who’s claiming it\n\nYou must prove that the person who’s going through your identity checking process is the claimed identity. You might let someone access your service using a claimed identity that belongs to someone else if you do not do this.\n\nThe highest score you can get for this part of the identity checking process is 4.\n\nScore 1\n\nThe person will get a score of 1 if they can prove they know information that does not change over time (‘static’ information) that only the claimed identity should know.\n\nYou should check this by asking the person to complete ‘knowledge-based verification’ (KBV) challenges.\n\nYou can do this using:\n\na free text response, where they can answer in any way they like\n\nmultiple choice, where they can choose an option from a set of possible answers that you provide\n\nIt’s usually more difficult for an impostor to complete a free text challenge than a multiple choice challenge. This is because they might be able to guess the right answer when completing a multiple choice challenge.\n\nIf you decide to accept free text responses to KBV challenges, be aware that they might include spelling mistakes or other errors. This can sometimes make it harder to match the responses to a record.\n\nHow many KBV challenges you ask the person to complete depends on:\n\nif the challenges are low, medium or high quality\n\nthe way the person completes the challenge\n\nYou should ask the person to complete one of the following:\n\n2 low quality free text KBV challenges\n\n4 low quality multiple choice KBV challenges\n\n1 medium quality free text KBV challenge\n\n2 medium quality multiple choice KBV challenges\n\n1 high quality free text KBV challenge\n\n1 high quality multiple choice KBV challenge\n\nQuality rules for KBV challenges\n\nKBV challenges should be specific enough to be able to prove that that person is who they say they are.\n\nSomeone who has stolen a claimed identity’s wallet, purse or phone should not be able to complete all of the KBV challenges you ask them to.\n\nLow quality KBV challenges must be:\n\nabout the claimed identity\n\nclear and simple so the person knows exactly what you’re asking them\n\nabout something the claimed identity can reasonably be expected to know\n\nfrom a source that maintains the integrity of the information the question is based on\n\nfrom a source that makes sure the information cannot be misused by the claimed identity (for example the claimed identity should not be able to create false records)\n\nLow quality KBV challenges must not:\n\nbe able to be answered with information that’s available in the public domain (for example in an open dataset or on a website that anyone can access)\n\nbe able to be answered using information the person has submitted at another point in the identity checking process\n\nbe predictable (the questions and answers should change each time someone goes through your identity checking process)\n\nhave answers that can be easily guessed if you’re asking multiple choice questions\n\ninclude information that will give the person the answer to another question\n\nshow personal information (unless the person has already submitted it at another point during the identity checking process)\n\nMedium quality KBV challenges must meet all the requirements for low quality challenges, as well as:\n\nbe based on information from a source that did its own identity checks on the claimed identity\n\nshare codes, like a one-time password sent to the claimed identity’s phone, in a way that means you can be sure they were given to the claimed identity (if you use them)\n\nHigh quality KBV challenges must meet all the requirements for low and medium quality challenges. They must also be based on information:\n\nfrom a source that checked the claimed identity was who they said they were in a way that follows the Money Laundering Regulations 2017\n\nfrom a source that makes sure the information cannot be accessed, modified or created by its employees\n\nfrom a source that’s separate from your organisation\n\nfrom a source that’s regulated by a statutory or independent body\n\nthat cannot be known or accessed by anyone apart from the claimed identity and their immediate family without breaking the law (for example you should not use information that you know is available on the dark web)\n\nScore 2\n\nThe person will get a score of 2 if you do one of the following:\n\nmake sure the person physically matches the photo on or associated with the strongest piece of genuine evidence you have of the claimed identity (you can do this in person or remotely)\n\nmake sure the person’s biometric information matches biometric information from the strongest piece of genuine evidence you have or an authoritative source\n\nask the person to complete multiple ‘dynamic’ KBV challenges that only the claimed identity should be able to do\n\nMake sure someone matches the photo in person\n\nThe person doing the match must:\n\nhave been trained in how to detect impostors by a specialist trainer, such as the Home Office, National Document Fraud Unit, CPNI or any other company that follows the Home Office’s best practice guidance\n\nrefresh their training at least every 3 years\n\nhave good enough eyesight (with or without prescription lenses) to effectively compare the person to the image\n\nWhen doing the match, you must make sure:\n\nthe person whose identity is being checked is present\n\nthe light conditions are good enough to clearly see the person and the image on the evidence (for example there should be no glare or shadows)\n\nyou are comparing the person to a photo from genuine evidence\n\nthe photo has not been tampered with\n\nThe person whose identity is being checked must not:\n\nbe wearing a head covering (unless it’s for religious or medical reasons)\n\nhave their eyes closed\n\nhave anything covering their face or eyes (such as shadows or their hair)\n\nMake sure someone matches the photo remotely\n\nWhen doing the match, you must make sure:\n\nthe person whose identity is being checked is present when their image or video is captured (you should not use a scan or an upload from a photo or video feed)\n\nthe image or video has not been intercepted and reused (‘replayed’)\n\nyou are comparing an image or video of the person to an image or video of genuine evidence\n\nthe image or video has been shared in a way that prevents it from being tampered with (for example by using a ‘man-in-the-middle’ attack)\n\nIf a person is doing the match, they must:\n\nhave been trained in how to detect impostors by a specialist trainer, such as the Home Office, National Document Fraud Unit, CPNI or any other company that follows the Home Office’s best practice guidance\n\nrefresh their training at least every 3 years\n\nhave good enough eyesight (with or without prescription lenses) to effectively compare the person to the image\n\nThe image or video of the person must be:\n\nclear and in focus\n\nin colour\n\nIn the image or video, the person must:\n\nbe in clear contrast to the background\n\nnot have ‘red eye’\n\nnot wear a head covering (unless it’s for religious or medical reasons)\n\nnot have their eyes closed\n\nnot have anything covering their face or eyes (such as shadows or their hair)\n\nMake sure someone matches biometric information\n\nWhen doing the biometric comparison, you must make sure:\n\nthe number of ‘false matches’ and ‘false non-matches’ in your system are appropriate for your security and usability needs\n\nyour system matches the person to biometric information that’s known to belong to the claimed identity (this is known as ‘one-to-one verification’)\n\nthe biometric information has not been tampered with (if it was taken from a piece of evidence)\n\nyour system can identify if the person’s biometric information has been intercepted and reused (‘replayed’)\n\nthe biometric information has been shared in a way that prevents it from being tampered with\n\nyour system can tell if someone’s using an artefact to convince the system they’re someone else (known as ‘spoofing’) - this could mean making sure they’re not holding up a photo or playing a recording of someone’s else’s voice if you’re checking a facial or vocal type (‘modality’) of biometric\n\nyour system confirms that the person is real (known as a ‘liveness’ test)\n\nAsking the person to complete dynamic KBV challenges\n\nTo be ‘dynamic’, the answers to a KBV challenge must change over time. This will make it harder for impostors using information from things like data breaches to successfully complete the challenge.\n\nThe KBV challenges must follow the same quality rules that need to be followed to get a score of 1.\n\nYou can ask a combination of different quality KBV challenges to get a score of 2.\n\nThe KBV challenges should be based on information from at least 2 different sources or systems. For example, some challenges could be based on information from a credit reference agency while others could use information from a mobile phone network operator.\n\nSome of the following combinations require you to ask the person to complete multiple choice challenges. Wherever this is an option, you can choose to ask the person to complete free text challenges instead. This is because free text challenges are better at catching out impostors who might pretend to be the claimed identity.\n\nIf you ask 1 high quality free text challenge, you must also ask at least one of the following:\n\n2 low quality multiple choice challenges\n\n1 low quality free text challenge\n\n1 medium quality multiple choice challenge\n\nIf you ask 1 high quality multiple choice challenge, you must also ask at least one of the following:\n\n3 low quality multiple choice challenges\n\n2 low quality free text challenges\n\n1 low quality free text challenge and 1 low quality multiple choice challenge\n\n1 medium quality multiple choice challenge\n\nIf you ask 1 medium quality free text challenge, you must also ask at least one of the following:\n\n4 low quality multiple choice challenges\n\n2 low quality free text challenges\n\n1 low quality free text challenge and 2 low quality multiple choice challenges\n\n1 medium quality multiple choice challenge and 1 low quality multiple choice challenge\n\n2 medium quality multiple choice challenges\n\n1 medium quality free text challenge\n\nIf you ask 1 medium quality multiple choice challenge, you must also ask at least one of the following:\n\n5 low quality multiple choice challenges\n\n3 low quality free text multiple choice challenges\n\n1 low quality free text challenge and 3 low quality multiple choice challenges\n\n2 low quality free text challenges and 1 low quality multiple choice challenges\n\nIf you ask 2 medium quality multiple choice challenges, you must also ask at least one of the following:\n\n1 low quality free text challenge\n\n1 medium quality multiple choice challenge\n\nScore 3\n\nThe person will get a score of 3 if you do either of the following in person or remotely:\n\nmake sure they physically match the photo on (or associated with) the strongest piece of genuine evidence you have of the claimed identity\n\nmake sure their biometric information matches biometric information from the strongest piece of genuine evidence you have or an authoritative source of the claimed identity\n\nMake sure someone matches a photo in person or remotely\n\nThe person doing the match must have all the skills and training needed to get a score of 2. They must refresh their training in how to detect impostors every year.\n\nThe person or system doing the match must do everything needed to check someone matches a photo (in person or remotely) at score 2. You must also make sure:\n\nyour process has a way to identify if someone is wearing a mask, makeup or prosthetics to look like someone else\n\ntheir eyes are visible without any glare or reflections (if the person is wearing glasses)\n\nMake sure someone matches biometric information\n\nYou must do everything needed to check someone matches biometric information at score 2. You must also make sure:\n\nthe number of ‘false matches’ and ‘false non-matches’ in your system are appropriate for your security and usability needs and are based on industry best practice (for example ISO/IEC TR 29156:2015)\n\nyour system uses a biometric algorithm that’s been proven to be effective against a recognised benchmark, like the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST’s) face recognition vendor test guidance\n\nthe person’s biometric information is captured under conditions that do not reduce the accuracy of the type of biometric check being used (things like light, noise, and humidity impact the success rates for different biometric modalities and should be adjusted if needed)\n\nyour system can tell when someone is spoofing the system using an artefact that’s taken time, money and effort to create, for example detecting if someone is changing the pitch and adding background noise to a recording of a vocal biometric\n\nyour system uses multiple processes or measures to confirm that the person is real (known as an ‘enhanced liveness’ test)\n\nScore 4\n\nThe person will get a score of 4 if you make sure their biometric information matches biometric information from the strongest piece of genuine evidence you have or an authoritative source.\n\nThe system doing the match must do everything needed to check if someone matches biometric information at score 3.\n\nIt must also be able to tell when someone is spoofing the system using a sophisticated artefact that’s taken a lot of time, money, effort or criminal activity to create. If you’re checking a facial biometric modality, this could mean making sure the person is not showing a 3D animated avatar on a hijacked computer or device.\n\nThe biometric information on the evidence and the biometric information of the person must also be captured under ‘controlled conditions’. This means:\n\nany equipment has been designed in a way that makes it difficult to be tampered with\n\nsomeone who was trained in how to compare people to their identity evidence by a specialist trainer (such as the Home Office, National Document Fraud Unit, CPNI or any other company that follows the Home Office’s best practice guidance) supervises how the biometric information is captured\n\nthe supervisor refreshes their training every year\n\nthe supervisor monitors the behaviour of the person whose biometric information is being captured to make sure it’s not suspicious\n\nthe area and equipment used to capture the biometric information has been designed in a way that reduces the likelihood of incorrect matches for the type of biometric information being used\n\nThe area where the check is being done should also be monitored by trained personnel who make sure people are not trying to fool the system.\n\nImproving your checks if the claimed identity is at high risk of identity fraud\n\nYou do not always need to get a higher score to improve your checks.\n\nIf you ask a user to complete KBV challenges, you can improve your check by doing one of the following:\n\nasking the user to complete more challenges based on information from another source\n\nmaking sure the person physically matches the photo on evidence of the claimed identity\n\nmaking sure the person’s biometric information matches what’s on evidence of the claimed identity\n\nIf you’re already doing a physical match, you can either:\n\ncheck more security features on the evidence\n\nmake sure checks are supervised by another member of staff who has completed the appropriate training\n\nIf you’re already matching someone’s biometric information, you can lower your false match rate. This will help make sure your system does not match biometric information to the wrong person."
