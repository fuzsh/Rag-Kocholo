He knows first hand what it’s like to pretend to be someone you are not. He’s also only too aware of how easy it is to lose your own identity when you’ve lived a lie for the previous 15 years as a Dublin money launderer and bagman for the Turkish mafia and the past will not go away.\n\nCompleting the team are Tessa Stein, IT expert in everything from trawling databases to cracking security codes, DS Anthony Wareing, who has his eye on promotion and a stance on cases that can err on the self-righteous, and DC José Rodriguez - cocky, self-assured, yet with a seriousness and sensitivity that gives him insight into cases.\n\nAs the series unfolds, DS Wareing becomes more and more concerned about Bloom’s methods and frustrated by what he sees as Martha’s blind and foolish indulgence of him.\n\nAidan Gillen as DI John Bloom\n\nKeeley Hawes as DSI Martha Lawson\n\nHolly Aird as Tessa Stein\n\nElyes Gabel as DC Jose Rodriguez\n\nShaun Parkes as DS Anthony Wareing\n\nPatrick Baladi as AC Hugh Wainwright\n\nEpisode # Title Directed by Written by Original airdate Viewers (millions)[2] 1\"Second Life\"Brendan MaherEd Whitmore5 July 2010 ( )6.37\n\nJustin Curtis claims to have had his identity stolen when he stands accused of a hit and run accident.
