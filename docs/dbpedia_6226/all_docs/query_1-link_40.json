She loved her son so much and supported him in everything he wanted to do,” said Trista Curtis, who grew up with Wiebe in Aylmer and has a son who played hockey with Wiebe’s son.\n\nVideos posted to Facebook show Talbot Street lined with hundreds of people who turned up to show their support for Wiebe and her family.\n\nPeople wearing hockey jerseys and holding hockey sticks tapped the sticks on the ground in unison, in a tribute to the hockey mom.\n\n“At Tanya’s tribute, it was amazing to see the support from our community and Chase’s past hockey teams,” Curtis said.\n\nA visitation for Savage, who worked for Ferguson Family Beans, will be held Wednesday morning at Williams Funeral Home in St. Thomas followed by a private family service, his obituary said.\n\nbwilliams@postmedia.com\n\n@BrianWatLFPress\n\nThe Local Journalism Initiative is funded by the Government of Canada\n\nArticle content\n\nLondon Free Press is part of the Local Journalism Initiative and reporters are funded by the Government of Canada to produce civic journalism for underserved communities.
