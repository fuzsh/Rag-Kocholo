        "text": "A Borough woman who lay dead in her ‘dirty swamp’ council flat for several months has finally had her identity revealed.\n\nCaroline McCrossan, born September 3, 1960, was named at a coroner’s inquest opening on Friday, January 12.\n\nMcCrossan’s decomposed body was discovered by a council worker who forced entry into her Tabard Gardens Estate flat, on January 6, 2023.\n\nExclusive: Woman living in “swamp” conditions found dead in Borough flat\n\nHer discovery led to accusations that Southwark Council has “missed opportunities to prevent these tragic circumstances”.\n\nFollowing a post-mortem examination, the cause of death is unascertained due to the body’s state of decomposition.\n\nHe said the body was discovered in a “significant state of decomposition” and led on the bathroom floor with the flat in “disarray”.\n\nOfficial identification had been complicated by the fact that documentation found in the flat indicated Caroline was using different aliases.\n\nBut DCI Thomson said “it’s our working hypothesis it’s Caroline McCrossan”.\n\nIn March 2022, nine months before the body was found, neighbour Jeffrey Boachie-Frimpong had visited Caroline to discuss a leak dripping into his flat.\n\nHe said the woman was “extremely distraught” and “living in what seemed to be a dirty swamp”.\n\nJeffrey and his wife contacted the council, begging them to “rehouse this poor woman”.\n\nSouthwark Council says it visited the property and fixed the leak but the woman did not say she needed help.\n\nWith leaks reappearing in September 2022, Jeffrey urged the council to check on Caroline’s welfare.\n\nInstead of being checked on, the woman is believed to have lain dead for several months.\n\nA source close to the case previously told the News it was believed she’d lain dead for roughly four months.\n\nIn court, DCI Thomson said Caroline’s last rent installment was paid on May 17, 2022.\n\nThe discovery sparked outrage among local politicians who slammed the council.\n\nIn February 2023, Bermondsey and Old Southwark MP Neil Coyle said: “They need to work out if they could have done more to fix those jobs sooner and whether they’re aware of any other opportunities to prevent these tragic circumstances.”\n\nSouthwark MP accuses council of “burying its head in the sand” over discovery of dead woman in ‘swamp’ flat\n\nSouthwark Council said its enquiries found “no fault in terms of practice nor breaches of council policies”.\n\nCllr Darren Merrill, Cabinet Member for Council Homes, said: “We take the death of every resident seriously and it is always very sad when someone is found in this way.\n\n“Residents can live independent lives for many reasons and we are taking this opportunity to enhance training across council departments on how to spot if someone is isolated and what we can do to help.\n\n“Our enquiries into this case found no fault in terms of practice nor breaches of council policies – the resident of the flat was not listed as vulnerable or on a system for regular welfare checks.”\n\nPolice said identification was complicated after officers found documents suggesting Caroline used “multiple aliases”.\n\nThey discovered a passport under the name Annie Kenmur and letters also bearing that name, among others.\n\nScotland’s birth registry shows McCrossan’s mother was called Annie Kenmur who married a George McCrossan in 1954.\n\nCoroner Dr Julian Morris opened the inquest on Friday, January 12.\n\nA date for the full inquest will be announced in due course."
