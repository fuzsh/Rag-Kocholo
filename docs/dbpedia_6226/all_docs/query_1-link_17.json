        "text": "In 2021, Pure Imagination Studios broke new ground in taking the phenomenally successful Netflix franchise, Army of the Dead, from the screen into real life with Viva Las Vengeance, an immersive, virtual reality experience set in a zombie-infested Las Vegas. Described by Forbes as a “next-level immersive experience”, it takes Netflix into location-based entertainment in a first for the company and an industry-leading move. As owner and operator of the experience in the USA, Pure Imagination selected Identity as their design, build and logistical partner for the Viva Las Vengeance VR tour across the UK and Europe, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n\nDeliverables\n\nIdentity worked closely with Pure Imagination, Netflix and their partners, global ticketing and marketing partner, Fever, US project managers, Experiential Supply Company, 310 Merchandise and UK staffing company, Continuum Attractions, from initial strategy and planning through to design and delivery. Identity undertook full venue liaison with Westfield to create a peerless experience for this exciting physical and virtual activation, set in a 360-degree environment with VR headset, hand trackers, full-body capture and simulated weapons.\n\nWith the client and major partners based in the US, Identity translated and augmented a complex brief, based on US specifications and geography, to establish a seamless transition to the UK, deploying an inventive approach and significant adaptations to create a living, breathing, immersive and apocalyptic Las Vegas in central London.\n\nIdentity created and constructed all elements of the entire physical environment, including the front of house, the Quarantine Zone, shipping container-style briefing rooms, warehouse, photo opportunity and retail spaces, scenically treated with life-sized, bespoke replica props. We reprogrammed all measurements to ensure absolute precision in the relationship between the VR and physical environment. Our highly-creative design achieved a Hollywood-grade look and feel throughout the experience from check-in to merchandising, including the bespoke design and build for the central heart of the immersive experience – a suite of motorised taco trucks with motion flooring – from scratch.\n\nThe activation is designed to be used by anyone and can be deployed anywhere. Built for touring and adaptable to any environment, the experience is fully modular and mobile, easily and efficiently built up and down, with all scenic elements pre-built and packaged to maximise speed and efficiency for onsite installation. All technical elements were pre-designed and tested to a tour grade level, with plug-and-play installation and minimal onsite calibration. Accessibility was at the forefront of this immersive and physical experience, with access to the taco trucks being wheelchair friendly."
