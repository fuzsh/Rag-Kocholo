        "text": "Thirty-four years since the body of an unidentified young man was found in west London, a new image is being released to trace him.\n\nOn 10 July, 1990, the body of the man was found hanging under Kew Railway Bridge, which spans the River Thames between Kew and Strand-on-the-Green, Chiswick.\n\nHe is believed to have been about 25 years old.\n\nDespite extensive investigations and appeals, the man's identity remains unknown.\n\nOver the past three years, volunteer investigators with Locate International, a charity that looks into cold cases of missing and unidentified people, have been working to try and reunite him with his name.\n\nA new living depiction of the man, created by forensic artist Hew Morrison, is now being released to the public.\n\nKew Bridge Man, as the charity calls him, was white, 175cm (5'8\") tall, and of thin build. He had very short brown hair with a ponytail, facial stubble and blue eyes.\n\nHe also had a mole on his lip and a mole on his scalp.\n\nSubsequent newspaper articles indicated he had a pierced right ear and irregular teeth with a retained deciduous canine tooth. It was also reported his clothing smelt of engine oil.\n\nHe was wearing a green jumper with an eagle motif, worn inside out, a white T-shirt, blue jeans, black Dr Martens boots and a blue and black woolly hat.\n\nPerhaps most notable is his distinctive haircut: a crew cut on the top and sides, but long hair at the back.\n\nInvestigators with Locate International are exploring a number of leads, but are keen to hear from the public:\n\nDo you recognise the man from a garage or any other workshop in the late 1980s or early 1990s?\n\nIt is possible that the man was a part of the gay community in London in 1990: does he look familiar to you?\n\nHave a look at his haircut: do you remember anyone who had their hair cut in this style?\n\nDid you know anyone who matches this description, but lost contact with them around 1990, and never heard from them again?\n\nMark Greenhalgh, Locate International's CEO, said: \"It's been 34 years since Kew Bridge Man was found, but we believe it is not too late to identify him. Someone out there must have known him, encountered him, worked with him, or seen him on the street. And someone may well have missed him.\n\n\"No clue is too small for our investigators, so if you think you know anything at all, please get in touch.\"\n\nKew Bridge Man is one of a number of unidentified deaths on the railways that Locate International are investigating.\n\nThese include Mile End Man, who died in east London in 1975, and Sowerby Bridge Man, who died in Yorkshire in 2012.\n\nMembers of the public can participate in Locate International's forum to discuss Kew Bridge Man â€“ sign up here.\n\nWe want to provide Ealing with more and more clickbait-free local news.
