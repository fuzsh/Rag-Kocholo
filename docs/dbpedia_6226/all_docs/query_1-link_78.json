        "text": "Police hailed a \"significant development\" in the Clifton Suspension Bridge human remains case last week as officers arrested a 34-year-old man, but questions remain about the identities of the men found inside two blood-soaked suitcases.\n\nAvon and Somerset armed police said in an update on Saturday that officers had arrested a suspect on Friday night in connection with the discovery of two suitcases containing human remains next to the famed Bristol landmark. Additional remains found at a property in Shepherd's Bush, west London, are believed to be from the same people, which police have said are both men.\n\nIn a statement, the London Metropolitan Police said the service believes the remains were of \"two male victims\" and that inquiries are ongoing, but that formal identification is yet to take place. With their identities still up in the air, several questions remain about the gruesome series of events that led to their discovery.\n\nWho are the men found in the suitcases?\n\nPolice were unusually forthcoming early on in their enquiries, as they took the rare step of naming their suspect during a manhunt on Thursday. There are few details about many other particulars of the case, however, with neither of the men identified as of yet.\n\nInvestigators have said formal identification is underway, and the only detail about what was found inside the suitcases has come from witnesses. One witness described the cases as \"tatty\" while another said they were \"leaking blood\".\n\nWhy were the remains moved?\n\nThe case is a multi-service investigation, with officers involved from both Avon and Somerset Police and their London Metropolitan colleagues. They were found in suitcases by police investigating the bridge following a call from a member of the public who saw a man acting suspiciously.\n\nAdditional remains were found at a home in London, which are believed to belong to the same people found in Bristol. There is no explanation as to why the remains appear to have been split up.\n\nWhy were the remains deposited at the Clifton Suspension Bridge?\n\nPolice have confirmed the remains were found in two places, but they are several hundred miles apart. The distance from Shepherd's Bush to the Clifton Suspension Bridge is roughly 116 miles, and the trip there takes around two-and-a-half hours, involving walking, buses and trains. There is no confirmation as to why the remains were spread across hundreds of miles, or why some were placed at the suspension bridge."
