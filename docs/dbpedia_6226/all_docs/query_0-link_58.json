Just about every area of the town is impacted.\n\n\"There are no words of relief. There's nothing I can say to make anything better.\"\n\nNear the Harrow home on Friday, someone had tied flowers to a utility pole and flags flew at half-staff at local municipal buildings.\n\nBondy said the Harrow Health Centre is offering free counselling to members of the community experiencing grief and distress.\n\nPost-mortem examinations will be conducted in London.\n\nPolice said residents can expect to see a large police presence for the next several days.\n\nHarrow is a small southwestern Ontario town near Lake Erie. It's about a 45-minute drive south of Windsor."
