        "text": "WASHINGTON – During today’s Senate Judiciary Committee nominations hearing, U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, questioned Judge Mustafa Kasubhai, nominated to be United States District Judge for the District of Oregon; Judge John Kazen, nominated to be United States District Judge for the Southern District of Texas; and Judge Shanlyn Park, nominated to be United States District Judge for the District of Hawaii.\n\nDurbin began by asking Judge Kazen about the several naturalization ceremonies he has presided over in his role as a magistrate judge, including two ceremonies this year.\n\n“In one of your addresses to our new citizens, you said, ‘[Y]our journey is not over. America is a country of immigrants. America has been made great by immigrants. We are all children of immigrants.’ That was a very poignant and profound statement,” Durbin said. “Are there any other observations you’d like to make about your naturalization experiences?”\n\nJudge Kazen noted that he too is a product of immigrants—his great-grandparents emigrated from Lebanon. “Presiding over those naturalization ceremonies is one of the most rewarding things I do as a judge. Because after they take that oath of citizenship, they are glowing with pride to become citizens of this country and it is something that you can tell is a life accomplishment for them. It is extremely rewarding to share that accomplishment with them,” Judge Kazen said.\n\nDurbin then asked Judge Park about her time as an Assistant Federal Public Defender and later as a Senior Litigator in the District of Hawaii’s Office of the Federal Public Defender.\n\n“I’ve taken a look at some of the cases that you were called on to defend criminal defendants before the Court,” Durbin said. “Some of the crimes that were charged were absolutely horrible against those defendants. What did you view as your responsibility as a public defender and an attorney when it came to the defense of these individuals?”\n\nJudge Park responded, “I felt that it was my responsibility pursuant to the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution to provide these individuals with zealous representation. That is what the Constitution demands and that is what I provided to these individuals.”\n\nDurbin then asked Judge Kasubhai about his 15 years of judicial experience—the past five years as a federal magistrate judge, and before that, a State Circuit Court judge for over a decade.\n\n“I know the temperament of the judge and the environment of the courtroom itself has such an impact on whether people feel that they are being treated justly and fairly. What is your experience?” Durbin asked.\n\nJudge Kasubhai responded that “temperament and demeanor absolutely impact how access to the courts might really turn into accessing the courts… the foundation of that is humility… so what I try to do when I sit on the bench is to ensure that I extend to people graciousness and patience… whether somebody prevails or doesn’t prevail, I want that ruling to be conveyed in a way that helps them think of the court as a place in which decisions can be decided impartially, without regard to who they are, and that they were heard.”\n\nVideo of Durbin’s questions in Committee is available here.\n\nAudio of Durbin’s questions in Committee is available here.\n\nFootage of Durbin’s questions in Committee is available here for TV Stations.\n\nJamel Semper, nominated to be United States District Judge for the District of New Jersey; and Micah Smith, nominated to be United States District Judge for the District of Hawaii, were also part of today’s nominations hearing.\n\nThe hearing continues the Committee’s work filling judicial vacancies with highly qualified, diverse candidates who help ensure the fair and impartial administration of the American justice system. Under the leadership of Chair Durbin, the Senate has confirmed 143 judges to lifetime appointments on the federal bench during the Biden administration.\n\n-30-"
