Haas, a noted trial lawyer who enjoyed a long and distinguished career serving the people of Multnomah County and the state of Oregon in all three branches of government, died peacefully in his home surrounded by loved ones on Sept. 21, 2013. He was 80.\n\nHaas was born on Dec. 24, 1932 in Cape Girardeau, Mo. He called Oregon home beginning in 1958 when he came west to attend law school. After military service and undergraduate study at the University of Montana and South East Missouri State, Haas graduated with honors from Willamette University Law School in 1961. He was proud to be a 52-year member of the Oregon State Bar.\n\nHis occupation was trial lawyer; his avocation was public service. He was able to combine the two in a long and distinguished career serving the people of Multnomah County and the state of Oregon in all three branches of government as a legislator, district attorney and circuit court judge.\n\nHaas’s motivation to enter public service was a true desire to improve the lives of the people he represented. He was most proud of the programs that he pioneered that made real differences in the lives of thousands of people in Oregon and across the nation. In 1974, as district attorney, his office created the first Rape Victim Advocate Program to ease the trauma and protect the dignity of rape victims as they assisted the prosecution of the accused. In 1975, he implemented the first Victim’s Assistance Program to require restitution and protect the rights of crime victims. In 1991, as circuit court judge, he started the S.T.O.P. Drug Court to recognize and minimize the impact of drug addiction in the administration of justice. These programs became models for the nation and he went on to promote them nationally, speaking at legislative and judicial conferences in nearly every state and in Congress.\n\nHe was an invited guest of President Clinton in 1994 at the signing of the National Crime Bill at the White House. Haas was a proud Democrat and skilled politician who practiced his craft in a time where differences of opinion created opportunities for compromise and progress.\n\nAlong with his public service came public notoriety. Haas knew how to differentiate the two. He made appearances on “60 Minutes,” “The Phil Donahue Show” and Court TV and was covered by many local and national publications. Famous trial lawyer Gerry Spence tried a case in front of Judge Haas in 1987 that became the subject of Spence’s book “The Smoking Gun”. Speaking of Haas, Spence said, “He was patient. He was a loving judge. He ruled with love not power. He created a court in which the atmosphere was one of caring and redemption. These are inadequate words I write for a great man who has made immeasurable contributions to my life over the years.”\n\nHaas is survived by his wife, Mary Lou, a daughter, three stepchildren and three grandchildren.\n\nRetired labor lawyer Monica A. Smith died Oct. 09, 2013 at the age of 62.\n\nShe was born March 16, 1951, in Tacoma and grew up as the fifth of eight siblings. She graduated from the University of Chicago with a bachelor’s degree in English language and literature. Following college, Smith worked at a variety of jobs, including packing crabs in Alaska, waiting tables, keeping bees, counseling migrant workers and teaching English as a second language. She also studied Spanish and traveled extensively in Latin America.\n\nA bad employer eventually convinced Smith to overcome her resistance to her father’s advice to become a lawyer. She graduated from Lewis & Clark Law School in 1982. Smith worked as a labor lawyer for 26 years, forming the firm of Smith, Gamson, Diamond & Olney. She had the opportunity to represent unions of all sizes and employees in a wide range of fields, including education employees, fire fighters, state and county employees, stagehands, patternmakers and restaurant workers, as well as the Oregon AFL-CIO.\n\nAfter retiring from her practice of law in 2008, she continued to work for the Oregon Education Association, proudly supporting public education through the empowerment of education employees. Smith was a singer, gardener, swimmer and bicyclist. She was always active in her community, as a volunteer at Franklin High School, IRCO (the Immigration and Refugee Community Organization) and especially with the Willamette Valley Law Project, which supports the work of PCUN, the Northwest Farmworkers Union.\n\nSmith lived well with cancer for four years. She is survived by her husband of 28 years, Jeremy Sarant, her two children, seven siblings and many others."
