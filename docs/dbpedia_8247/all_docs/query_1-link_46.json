        "text": "Welcome to the Oregon State Bar's Judicial Candidate Voting Guide. This guide has been created to provide Oregon voters with detailed backgrounds and professional histories on judicial candidates throughout Oregon. The site includes background on almost every judicial candidate in a contested race this year, as well as many candidates running unopposed in the primary.\n\nBecause of the unique nature of judicial races, candidates are prohibited from discussing controversial community matters in order to maintain their ability to be impartial on future cases. These prohibitions exist to ensure a fair and impartial judicial system. Voters, however, need enough information to make informed choices. This Voter's Guide is designed to provide that level of detail.\n\nIt is also designed as a research tool for news reporters and editorial researchers. In addition to extensive professional histories, candidates are asked to provide their perspectives on the judicial role, why they want to be a judge, and issues of particular concern to them in Oregon's justice system.\n\nAdditional information about Oregon's court system can be found at the Oregon Judicial Department web site."
