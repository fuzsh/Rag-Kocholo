        "text": "Prentiss Mellen was born on October 11, 1764 in Sterling, Massachusetts to Rev. John Mellen and Rebecca Prentiss Mellen. He graduated from Harvard College in 1784. After college, he spent a year as a private tutor in Barnstable, Massachusetts and read law under the tutelage of Shearjashub Bourne. Mellen was admitted to the bar in Taunton, Massachusetts in 1788.\n\nMellen moved to Biddeford (in what later would be Maine) in 1792 and then to Portland in 1806. In 1818, he was elected to the United States Senate from Massachusetts to fill the vacancy left by the death of Eli P. Ashmun. However, he served for less than two years, resigning in 1820 upon the admission of the State of Maine into the United States.\n\nOn July 1, 1820, Mellen was appointed the first Chief Justice of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court. He served as Chief until October 11, 1834, when at the age of 70 he was constitutionally disqualified from the bench and forced to resign. Mellen died in Portland on December 31, 1840, at the age of 76.\n\nSources: In Memoriam Prentiss Mellen, 17 ME 467; William Willis, A History of the Law, the Courts, and the Lawyers of Maine, Bailey and Noyes, Portland, Maine, 1863, pg. 163-173; Biographical Directory of the United States Congress (www.bioguide.congress.gov/ scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=M000636).\n\nWilliam Pitt Preble was born on November 27, 1783 in York. His father was Esaias Preble. He graduated from Harvard College in 1806. After reading law under the tutelage of Benjamin Hasey of Topsham, Preble was appointed County Attorney for York in 1811.\n\nPreble was appointed the United States Attorney for the District of Maine by President Madison on 1814 and served until 1820. He moved to Portland and was the citys representative to Maines 1819 Constitutional Convention. Preble was appointed one of the inaugural Associate Justices of the Supreme Judicial Court on July 1, 1820 when the State of Maine was admitted into the Union. He served on the Court until his resignation on June 18, 1828.\n\nIn 1828, President Jackson appointed Preble Minister to The Hague to represent the United States in its dispute with Great Britain over the Northeastern boundary, which was ultimately settled by the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842. Preble was named the first president of the Atlantic and St. Lawrence Railroad Company in 1847. He died on October 11, 1857, at the age of 73.\n\nSources: William Willis, A History of the Law, the Courts, and the Lawyers of Maine, Bailey & Noyes, Portland, Maine, 1863, pg. 597-614; Virtual American Biographies (http://www.famousamericans.net/williampittpreble/).\n\nNathan Weston was born on July 27, 1782 in Hallowell (part of present day Augusta) to Nathan and Elizabeth (Bancroft) Weston. He was educated at Hallowell Academy, and graduated from Dartmouth College in 1803. He read law in the offices of Benjamin Whitwell in Augusta, and George Blake in Boston, Massachusetts. He was admitted to the Suffolk County, Massachusetts Bar in July 1806, and soon after returned to Augusta to open his practice.\n\nWeston served as New Gloucesters representative to the Massachusetts Legislature in 1808. He also served as a delegate to the Brunswick Convention of 1816, which addressed the issue of statehood for Maine. With the restructuring of the Massachusetts court system in 1811, Weston was appointed by Governor Strong as Chief Justice of the Second Eastern Circuit Court for the District of Maine. At the time of his appointment, Weston was 29 years old.\n\nWeston was appointed an Associate Justice of the first Maine Supreme Judicial Court by Governor William King on July 1, 1820, upon the admission of the State of Maine into the Union and was appointed Chief Justice on October 22, 1834. He served as Chief until his retirement on October 22, 1841. Weston died in Augusta on June 4, 1872, at the age of 90. His grandson, Melville Weston Fuller, was Chief Justice of the United States.\n\nSources: In Memoriam Nathan Weston, Jr., 33 ME 593; Willis, Lawyers and Courts of Maine (1863).\n\nAlbion K. Parris was born on January 19, 1788 in Hebron to Samuel and Sarah (Pratt) Parris. He was educated locally before graduating from Dartmouth College in 1806. Parris read law with the future Chief Justice Ezekial Whitman, first in New Gloucester, then in Portland. He was admitted to the Cumberland County Bar in 1809, but immediately established his office in Paris, Oxford County.\n\nIn 1811, Parris was appointed County Attorney for Oxford; in 1813 he was elected to the General Court in Massachusetts; and was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1815. He served in Congress until February 1818 when he was appointed Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Maine by President Monroe. He sat on the District Court until 1820.\n\nParris was a staunch supporter of Maines separation from Massachusetts. He was the Treasurer of the Maine Constitutional Convention. Following Maines statehood in 1820, Parris was appointed the Probate Judge of Cumberland County by Governor King. Parris himself was elected Governor of Maine and held that office from 1822 until 1827. Afterward, he was elected to the United States Senate, replacing John Holmes, and served from 1827 until 1828.\n\nParris was appointed an Associate Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court by Governor Lincoln on June 25, 1828, and served until his resignation on August 20, 1836. He served as Second Comptroller of the United States Treasury from 1836 until 1850. He was elected Mayor of Portland in 1852 and waged an unsuccessful campaign for Governor in 1854. He died on February 11, 1857, at the age of 69.\n\nSources: William Willis, A History of the Law, the Courts, and the Lawyers of Maine, Bailey & Noyes, Portland, Maine, 1863, pg. 565-572; Biographical Directory of the United States Congress (http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=P000079).\n\nNicholas Emery was born on September 4, 1776 in Exeter, New Hampshire to Noah and Jane (Hale) Emery. He was educated at Exeter Academy, and graduated from Dartmouth College at the age of nineteen. After college, Emery prepared for a legal career by reading law in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.\n\nEmery returned to Exeter Academy as an assistant instructor in 1797, and was later admitted to the York County Bar in 1798. Emery began his legal practice in Parsonsfield but moved to Portland in 1807. Emery was an active participant in the debate over the separation of the District of Maine from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, serving on the Brunswick Convention of 1816. He also served as a delegate from Portland to the convention that drafted the Maine Constitution.\n\nEmery was appointed an Associate Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court by Governor Dunlap on October 22, 1834.
