        "text": "The OSB's Federal Practice & Procedure Committee helps attorneys and the federal courts share information and work together to provide legal services to the public. Information about federal practice, federal courts, pro bono opportunities in federal courts, and training designed to help prepare attorneys to work in federal court is available from a number of sources, accessible via the following links:\n\nUnited States Courts\n\nPrimary website for the federal Judiciary with links to court rules and forms as well as websites for each Federal Circuit and District Court.\n\nThe U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon\n\nThe court's website includes information about local rules, proposed new local rules, court calendar, the judges, court policies, forms, and pacer/e-filing case-related information. There are separate tabs for attorneys, jurors, members of the public, and educators. Attorneys are encouraged to participate in the court's pro bono program, and additional information about that program is available on the court's website.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals\n\nThe Ninth Circuit makes a host of information available to attorneys and members of the public that includes: published and unpublished opinions, oral argument calendars, case information, local and federal rules of appellate practice, guides and legal outlines (including civil and criminal model Ninth Circuit jury instructions), links to current and past oral argument recordings, and general news updates. Mentorship opportunities are available by contacting the Appellate Lawyer Representatives.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court\n\nThe Court's current docket, oral argument schedule, copies of merit briefs, opinions, and general information about the Court are all available free of charge on this website.\n\nThe Oregon Chapter of the Federal Bar Association\n\nComprised of approximately 400 members, this organization hosts a monthly luncheon with the federal judges, it produces a federal court handbook that provides specific information and advice from the local district court bench, and it holds a number of continuing legal education programs throughout the year that specifically address federal court practice and procedures. The local chapter also offers a mentorship program.\n\nInns of Court\n\nInns of Court work to improve advocacy skills by teaming up experienced judges and practitioners with new lawyers to improve civil and criminal litigation practice. Information on local chapters is found below.\n\nU.S. District Court Historical Society/The Pioneer Courthouse Historical Society\n\nThese organizations track the history of federal courts in Oregon and host legal education programs that focus on cases, judges, and practitioners of particular historical interest. These groups also host an annual summer picnic open to all members of the Oregon Bar:\n\nThe Government Printing Office - Federal Digital System\n\nFrom this page you can access official versions of federal documents including the United States Code, Code of Federal Regulations, Federal Register, Federal Court Opinions, Congressional Bills, and Presidential Documents.\n\nFederal Agency Directory\n\nHosted by the Louisiana State University Libraries in partnership with the Federal Depository Library Program, this website provides links to all current/active/existing U.
