        "text": "The USDCHS Oral History Program\n\nSince 1988, the District Court Historical Society’s Oral History Program has collected biographical interviews of judges, lawyers, and lay persons who have played a significant role in Oregon legal history. At present, the Oral History collection includes more than 170 individual interviews and eight law firm histories. Oral histories have been collected by professional interviewers and trained volunteers. These oral histories are preserved by the Oregon Historical Society and are available to USDCHS members, the public, and researchers.\n\nAll of the USDCHS interviews are preserved as original recordings and transcribed interviews. Both formats can be accessed at the Oregon Historical Society Davies Family Research Library. Early audio recordings were captured on magnetic cassette tape, but since 2006 all interviews have been recorded digitally and include video recorded sessions in addition to the audio format.\n\nThe U.S. District Court Historical Society, with substantial support from the Attorney Admissions Fund, adds to the Oral History Collection annually. If you have a suggestion of someone who should be considered for an interview or if you would be interested in participating in a volunteer training workshop please contact us.\n\nTo learn more about the Oral History Project, contact Oral History Committee Chair Joseph Carlisle or visit Our Collection.\n\nPlease visit our current online Oral Histories:\n\nDonald Ashmanskas\n\nFrank A.
