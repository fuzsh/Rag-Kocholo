        "text": "For seven years, PETER earned just $1.50 per hour. But now he earns ten times that amount, working for the state of Rhode Island as a custodian at a hospital. He gets along very well with his supervisors, who trust him with significant responsibility to accomplish his work independently. For the first time in his life, at age 37, Peter was able to purchase a new mattress. Before, he slept on a couch and a 30-year-old mattress he inherited from his mother. Peter also received his driver’s license and saved up enough money to buy a car. Peter and his fiancée Lori, who met at the workshop, have also gotten married and are living in an apartment in the Providence area.\n\nFor 10 years, JOE couldn’t make online mortgage payments on Wells Fargo’s website because he was blind and the site was inaccessible to him. Each month, Wells Fargo directed him to submit his payment by telephone, which required a $25 service fee. Today, because of the Justice Department’s settlement, all customers – including Joe and others with disabilities – can pay their bills and manage their finances without facing discrimination."
