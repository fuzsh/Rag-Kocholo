        "text": "​Oregon’s State Court Administrator supports and assists the Chief Justice in performing administrative authority and supervision over the budget and resources of a statewide, state-funded court system that includes the appellate, circuit, and tax courts; establishes and manages statewide administrative programs, policies, and procedures for OJD; supervises administration of OJD’s central business and infrastructure services for the court system, such as budget, accounting, procurement, human resources, legal, audit, education and outreach, self-represented services, information technology infrastructure, and the ongoing development of Oregon eCourt technology.\n\nThese responsibilities are carried out principally through the functions of eleven divisions and programs, including Executive Services; Appellate Court Services; Business and Fiscal Services; Court Language Access Services; Enterprise Technology Services; Human Resource Services; Juvenile and Family Court Programs; Legal Counsel; Office of Policy and Education; Marshals Office​; and the Internal Audit Program.\n\nThe State Court Administrator’s Office also coordinates OJD’s response to legislative bills affecting the Judicial Branch or OJD as a state entity, prepares fiscal impact statements, serves as secretary to the Judicial Conference, and provides other support to OJD as required.\n\n​​\n\n​\n\n​The Oregon Court of Appeals decides civil and criminal appeals from the circuit courts (except death penalty cases and Tax Court appeals) and cases involving challenges to administrative agency actions and rules. Thirteen elected judges sit on the court and are divided into four panels that consider matters and cases assigned to them by the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals. The Chief Judge participates in each panel as a nonvoting judge and also substitutes as a voting judge in the place of a judge who is not available or has a conflict of interest (such as any connection to the parties; knowledge of the facts of the case; financial interest; or relationship with one of the case attorneys). An additional two-judge panel can be formed to include the Chief Judge and one judge selected from any of the four panels for review of certain substantive motions (motions that concern the rules and laws that determine the rights and responsibilities of individuals and groups) filed in appeals or judicial reviews cases.\n\nAfter reviewing an appeal, a panel may decide to agree with the circuit court decision or draft an opinion on the appeal that explains the panel’s reasoning – and if any panel member disagrees, that member writes a dissenting opinion. The panel reviews the opinion and any dissents with the Chief Judge before deciding to adopt or revise the decision. Once the panel adopts an opinion, it is circulated to all thirteen appeals court judges for comment, who may then agree with the reviewing panel's opinion or decide that the appeal should be considered en banc (reviewed by the full thirteen-judge court).​\n\n​Municipal Courts function as city government's \"judicial branch.\" Municipal courts are not part of the state government courts in Oregon. Not all Oregon cities have a Municipal Court, but those that do, hear cases involving violations of city laws (ordinances) and some state statutes that regulate animal control, fire control, parking, and traffic violations with city limits.\n\nCounty Courts exist in seven eastern Oregon counties. The Board of Commissioners in those counties acts as the County Court, each with a county judge who also chairs the county commission and has limited judicial functions. The county judge, whose primary job involves non-judicial administrative responsibilities as chair of the county commission, may handle either probate and juvenile cases, or both, within the county.\n\nJustice Courts are limited jurisdiction courts established by a county government and are not part of the Oregon Judicial Department. The judge of a justice court is called a Justice of the Peace and is elected to serve for six years. Justice Courts have jurisdiction over misdemeanors (crimes that carry potential penalty of up to one year of incarceration); violations (offenses that can result in a monetary fine, but not incarceration, like most traffic tickets); civil claims valued at $10,000 or less (either in small claims or in the regular civil division); and eviction cases. The Justice of the Peace is the decision-maker for most cases in Justice Court, but the Justice can also empanel juries. Justices can also perform weddings. Appeals of justice court decisions are heard in the circuit court.​​\n\nTribal Courts are an important part of tribal self-government in Oregon’s Indian Nations. Most tribes have their own constitutions and justice codes that determine how tribal courts resolve civil and criminal matters that occur on reservation lands and property. Some tribes choose to use native customs and traditional forms of dispute resolution and other tribes use an adversarial process (involving a plaintiff and defendant) to settle disputes.\n\nFederal Courts (United States district courts) are the \"trial courts\" of the United States federal court system. The United States District Court for the District of Oregon has four courthouses – located in Eugene, Medford, Pendleton, and Portland. Federal district courts hear cases related to federal law, administrative actions of federal agencies, or the United States Constitution. The federal appellate court, called the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, is based in San Francisco. It has offices in and hears appeals from lower federal courts in states belonging to the “Ninth Circuit” including Alaska, Arizona, California, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Northern Marianas Islands, Oregon, and Washington. Decisions of the federal appellate courts may be appealed to the United States Supreme Court.\n\nFederal courts also handle all bankruptcy cases. The Federal Bankruptcy Court for the District of Oregon hears cases in two locations – Portland and Eugene.\n\n​"
