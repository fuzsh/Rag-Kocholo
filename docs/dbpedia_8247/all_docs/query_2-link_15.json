The federal district court for the District of Oregon denied the federal government’s motion to stay proceedings while the Ninth Circuit considered the government’s petition for writ of mandamus. The district court found that the federal defendants did not meet their burden of showing a likelihood that their petition for writ of mandamus would succeed on the merits. The court also rejected the defendants’ contentions that litigation costs and “potential, intrusive discovery that treads on separation of powers grounds” would result in irreparable injury if a stay was not granted to resolve threshold jurisdictional issues. The court further found that the plaintiffs had provided “substantial evidence of tangible, irreparable injury brought about the defendants’ repeated delays,” with “[e]xpert and plaintiff declarations … establish[ing] an ever-worsening climate crisis and with it, risks to plaintiffs’ health, their future, and their constitutional due process rights.” The court also stated that it could not discern any public interest in further delaying the case from reaching the evidentiary phase. 04/19/2024 Order Download Supplemental order addressing petition for writ of mandamus issued. In a supplemental order, the district court responded to the Ninth Circuit’s invitation to address the petition for writ of mandamus. The district court stated that although the case raised “legal issues of first impression,” the matters the district court had addressed were “the bread-and-butter of daily trial court work: injury, causation, and redressability under Article III; justiciability; viability of claims under Federal Rules of Procedure 12(b); standards for injunctive and declaratory relief—foundational inquiries necessary to proceed to any factfinding phase reaching the heart of plaintiffs’ novel claims.” The district court maintained that the issues raised in the mandamus petition (whether the district court violated the writ of mandate, and the district court’s findings that the plaintiffs had standing and had stated plausible due process and public trust doctrine claims) were “better addressed through the ordinary course of litigation” than in a petition for writ of mandamus. 02/27/2024 Answer Download Defendants filed answer to second amended complaint. 02/15/2024 Reply Download Reply filed by defendants in support of motion for a stay. 02/01/2024 Opposition Download Plaintiffs filed opposition to defendants' motion to stay pending a petition for a writ of mandamus. 01/18/2024 Motion Download Motion filed by defendants for a stay pending a petition for a writ of mandamus. Federal Defendants Sought Stay in Juliana While They Ask Ninth Circuit to Order Dismissal of Case. After the federal district court for the District of Oregon allowed the youth plaintiffs in Juliana to proceed with some claims in their amended complaint, the federal defendants filed a motion to stay district court proceedings pending the Ninth Circuit’s review of a forthcoming petition for writ of mandamus asking the Ninth Circuit to enforce its mandate issued in March 2021 and to direct the district court to dismiss the case in its entirety. 12/29/2023 Opinion and Order Download Motion to dismiss denied, motion to certify prior order for interlocutory appeal denied, motion to stay litigation denied, and motion to set pretrial conference granted. Oregon Federal Court Said Youth Plaintiffs Could Proceed with Due Process and Public Trust Claims in Climate Suit. The federal district court for the District of Oregon denied in part the federal government’s motion to dismiss youth plaintiffs’ amended complaint asserting that federal defendants violated the plaintiffs’ constitutional rights to a stable climate system. The plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that they did not have standing because courts could not redress the plaintiffs’ alleged injuries. The district court first reconsidered its June 2023 determination that the Ninth Circuit’s mandate did not foreclose allowing the plaintiffs an opportunity to amend their complaint; the district court again concluded that allowing the plaintiffs to amend did not contravene the rule of mandate. Regarding the plaintiffs’ standing, the district court first adopted the Ninth Circuit’s determination that the plaintiffs established an injury in fact arising from climate change impacts that was fairly traceable to defendants. Regarding redressability, the district court noted that the plaintiffs had “scaled back” their request for injunctive relief by removing a request for a directive requiring the defendants to “prepare a remedial plan” and instead seeking to restrain the defendants “from carrying out policies, practices, and affirmative actions that render the national energy system unconstitutional in a manner that harms [p]laintiffs.” The court found that such relief was substantially likely to redress the plaintiffs’ harm but that even this narrower request for injunctive relief “still treads on ground over which [the] Ninth Circuit cautioned the Court not to step” because the relief was sought “against a host of governmental defendants” and “would be more expansive than any case of which the Court is aware.” The court concluded, however, that the plaintiffs’ requested declaratory relief—i.e., a declaration that “the national energy system” violates the Constitution and public trust doctrine—“may be enough to bring about relief by changed conduct” and that the defendants failed to show that such relief was outside the court’s authority. The court also found that “the political question doctrine does not impede plaintiffs’ claims.” Regarding the defendants’ motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ due process claim for failure to state a claim, the district court found “that the right to a climate system that can sustain human life is fundamental to a free and ordered society” and that the allegations that governmental action was damaging the climate system in a way that would result in harm to humans stated a claim for a due process violation. The district court also found that the plaintiffs stated a “danger creation” due process claim with their allegations that the defendants failed to adequately regulate the carbon dioxide emissions of third parties. The court also incorporated its earlier analysis concluding that plaintiffs alleged violations of the public trust doctrine in connection with the territorial sea. The court also rejected the defendants’ argument that the plaintiffs were required to bring their claims under the Administrative Procedure Act. The district court dismissed, however, the plaintiffs’ equal protection claim, finding it to be foreclosed by precedent holding that age is not a suspect class. The court also held that the plaintiffs’ claim under the Ninth Amendment was not viable. The court denied the defendants’ requests to certify for interlocutory appellate review this decision and its earlier decision allowing the plaintiffs to amend their complaint. The court also denied the defendants’ motion to stay the litigation and granted the plaintiffs’ motion to set a pretrial conference. 09/05/2023 Response Download Response filed by defendants to plaintiffs' August 21, 2023 notice of supplemental authority. 08/21/2023 Notice Download Notice of supplemental authority filed by plaintiffs (Held v.

The defendants opposed the motion to set a pretrial conference, contending that the court should first resolve the motion to dismiss and alternative motion for interlocutory appeal, as well as a forthcoming motion requesting that the court certify for interlocutory appeal its order granting leave to file an amended complaint. 06/22/2023 Motion to Dismiss Download Defendants filed motion to dismiss second amended complaint and motion to certify. Federal Defendants Asked Oregon Federal Court to Dismiss Juliana Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint, Said They Would Request Interlocutory Appeal of Order Granting Leave to Amend. After the federal district court for the District of Oregon granted the Juliana youth plaintiffs’ motion to amend their complaint to attempt to remedy standing deficiencies identified by the Ninth Circuit, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The defendants argued that the amended complaint was “not different in any relevant sense” from the complaint rejected by the Ninth Circuit and that the court therefore should comply with the Ninth Circuit’s mandate and dismiss the amended complaint. In addition, the defendants argued that the plaintiffs did not allege a redressable claim, that the action was not a case or controversy over which a federal court would have jurisdiction, and that the plaintiffs’ claims based on constitutional violations and an alleged public trust failed on the merits because the Constitution does not provide a fundamental right to a “stable climate system” and no federal public trust doctrine applies. The defendants asked that, in the event the court denies the motion to dismiss, that it certify its order for interlocutory appeal. 06/13/2023 Declaration Download Declaration of Julia A. Olson filed in support of motion to set pretrial conference. 06/13/2023 Motion Download Motion to set pretrial conference filed. Plaintiffs filed a motion to set a pretrial conference or to enter a pretrial order setting an expedited trial date no later than Spring 2024. 06/08/2023 Complaint Download Second amended complaint filed. 06/01/2023 Opinion and Order Download Motion for leave to file a second amended complaint granted. Oregon Federal Court Allowed Juliana Plaintiffs to Amend Complaint to Rectify Deficiency Identified by Ninth Circuit. More than three years after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the plaintiffs in Juliana v. United States lacked standing for their claims that federal defendants violated their constitutionally protected rights to a stable climate system capable of sustaining human life, the federal district court for the District of Oregon granted the plaintiffs’ motion to amend their complaint to attempt to cure what the district court characterized as “a narrow deficiency with plaintiffs’ pleadings on redressability.” The district court concluded that the Ninth Circuit’s mandate did not require the court “to shut the courthouse doors” on the plaintiffs where the plaintiffs cited intervening precedent and made new factual allegations. In particular, the plaintiffs cited a 2021 Supreme Court decision that held that judicial ability to “to effectuate a partial remedy” satisfies the redressability requirement for standing. The plaintiffs contended that their amended allegations demonstrated that relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act would provide sufficient partial redress of their climate change-related injuries. The plaintiffs also omitted relief that the Ninth Circuit found to be outside the scope of judicial authority, including a request for an order requiring the defendants to develop and implement a remedial plan. The district court found that the proposed amendments were not futile, concluding that “a declaration that federal defendants’ energy policies violate plaintiffs’ constitutional rights would itself be significant relief” and that such relief was “squarely within the constitutional and statutory power of Article III courts to grant.” The court therefore found “that the complaint can be saved by amendment.” 06/01/2023 Opinion and Order Download Earth Guardians dropped from action as named plaintiff and its claims dismissed without prejudice. In a separate opinion and order, the court dropped the plaintiff Earth Guardians from the action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21 and dismissed its claims without prejudice, as Earth Guardians requested. The court denied the federal defendants’ motion for entry of final judgment against Earth Guardians pursuant to Rule 54(b). The court found that judgment under Rule 54(b) would not be proper because the claims of Earth Guardians and the youth plaintiffs were “logically related, both from a factual and legal standpoint.” 05/10/2023 Response Download Response filed by defendants to plaintiffs' notice of supplemental authority. 05/05/2023 Notice Download Notice of supplemental authority filed by the plaintiffs. 03/14/2023 Order Download Motion to intervene denied with leave to refile and motions for leave to file amicus briefs granted. Oregon Federal Court Denied States’ Motion to Intervene to Oppose Youth Plaintiffs’ Motion to Amend in Juliana. On March 14, 2023, the federal district court for the District of Oregon denied motions by 18 states, led by Alabama, to intervene as defendants in young people’s constitutional climate change case against the United States and other federal defendants. The states sought to intervene in 2021 to oppose the plaintiffs’ motion for leave to amend their complaint after the Ninth Circuit ruled that they did not have standing. The court granted the states leave to refile their motions to intervene after the court rules on the pending motion to amend. On the same day, the court granted New York and five other states’ motion for leave to file a brief as amici curiae to “correct” the proposed state intervenors’ “erroneous assertions” about collusion between plaintiffs and federal defendants in other cases and the proposed intervenors’ “incomplete picture” of the impacts on states of federal action to address climate change. The court also granted Natural Resources Defense Council’s motion for leave to file an amicus brief opposing the states’ motion to intervene. 03/04/2022 Response Download Response filed by defendants to plaintiffs' notice of supplemental authority (Barke v. Banks). 02/17/2022 Notice Download Notice of supplemental authority filed by plaintiffs (Barke v. Banks). 11/29/2021 Notice Download Notice of supplemental authority filed by plaintiffs. Juliana Plaintiffs Said Supreme Court Water Rights Decision Supported Their Request to Amend Complaint. The plaintiffs filed a notice of supplemental authority in which they argued that the Supreme Court’s November opinion in Mississippi v. Tennessee—which concerned rights to groundwater underlying eight states—supported “the broad principle that even after a case is dismissed for failing to plead a viable remedy, a motion to amend could be brought to cure the pleading deficiency.” The plaintiffs contended that the opinion therefore supported their motion for leave to file an amended complaint to address the Ninth Circuit’s determination that they did not have standing. 11/01/2021 Press Release Download Press release issued by plaintiffs regarding conclusion of settlement talks. Juliana Plaintiffs Announced End of Settlement Talks. On November 1, 2021, the law firm representing the youth plaintiffs in Juliana v. United States, announced that settlement talks with the U.S. Department of Justice had ended the previous week without resolution. The announcement said the plaintiffs and their attorneys had concluded that there was no reason to continue the settlement discussions “until decision-makers for the federal defendants come to the settlement table.” The plaintiffs’ attorney said the plaintiffs would await a ruling from the district court on their motion to amend their complaint. 10/07/2021 Reply Download Reply filed by defendants in support of motion for entry of judgment. 09/23/2021 Declaration Download Declaration of Julia A. Olson filed in support of plaintiffs' opposition to motion for entry of judgment. 09/23/2021 Opposition Download Opposition filed by plaintiffs to defendants' motion for entry of judgment. The plaintiffs opposed the defendants' motion for entry of judgment, arguing that instead Earth Guardians should be dropped as a plaintiff, at its request, pursuant to Rule 21. The plaintiffs asserted that the defendants’ motion “appears to be part of a broader strategy to set up another early appeal or review by way of mandamus in connection with the pending Motion to Amend.” They contended that the court should issue “one final judgment at the conclusion of the case to avoid any further unnecessary early appeals.” 09/09/2021 Motion Download Motion for entry of judgment filed by defendants. Federal Government Sought Final Judgment Against Organizational Plaintiff in Juliana. After the organization Earth Guardians declined to join other plaintiffs in a motion to file an amended complaint in Juliana v. United States, the federal government filed a motion requesting entry of judgment against Earth Guardians. The government argued that because the Ninth Circuit had ordered that claims of all plaintiffs be dismissed and because Earth Guardians no longer was part of the plaintiffs’ efforts to amend the complaint, Earth Guardians’ claims should be dismissed for lack of standing. 07/20/2021 Reply Download Reply memorandum filed by Alabama and other states in support of motion for limited intervention. In Juliana v. United States, briefing was completed on the motion by states led by Alabama to intervene as defendants for the limited purpose of contesting the district court’s jurisdiction and to prevent a potential “collusive settlement” between the plaintiffs and the federal defendants. 07/16/2021 Response Download Response filed by defendants to plaintiffs' notice of supplemental authorities regarding motion for leave to file a second amended complaint and to lift stay. On July 16, 2021, the federal defendants filed a response to plaintiffs’ notice of supplemental authority regarding four recent Supreme Court decisions that the plaintiffs argued supported their standing; the defendants said the decisions did not affect the Ninth Circuit’s determination that declaratory relief could not on its own redress an injury, and that the court therefore should deny the plaintiffs’ motion for leave to amend. 07/16/2021 Supplement Download Plaintiffs filed supplement to their motion for leave to amend and file second amended complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief. The plaintiffs filed a supplement to their motion for leave to file an amended complaint. The modifications removed a plaintiff and substituted Biden administration officials as defendants. The plaintiffs also informed the court in the motion that they had decided not to seek to add nominal damages to their request for relief. 07/13/2021 Amicus Motion Download Motion for leave to file amicus curiae brief filed by Natural Resources Defense Council. Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) sought to file an amicus brief that argued that the court should deny the intervention motion without prejudice. NRDC reasoned that the states would not be prejudiced if intervention were deferred until the time of any proposed consent decree that might affect the states’ interests. 07/06/2021 Amicus Motion Download Motion filed by New York and other states for leave to file brief as amici curiae. Six states, led by New York, filed a motion for leave to file a brief as amici in support of the plaintiffs; they asserted an “interest in correcting proposed intervenors’ erroneous assertions about purported collusion between the parties” in two lawsuits referenced in the motion to intervene, as well as an interest in correcting the proposed intervenor states’ “incomplete picture of the effects that federal action to address climate change will have on States and state residents.” 07/06/2021 Declaration Download Declaration of Julia A. Olson filed in support of plaintiffs' response in opposition to motion for limited intervention. 07/06/2021 Opposition Download Response filed by plaintiffs in opposition to motion for limited intervention. 07/06/2021 Reply Download Reply memorandum filed by Alabama and other states in support of motion for limited intervention. 07/01/2021 Notice Download Notice of supplemental authorities filed in support of plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend and file second amended complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief. 06/25/2021 Transcript Download Oral argument held. 03/05/2021 Motion Download Unopposed motion filed by plaintiffs-appellees to withdraw the motion to stay the mandate. The plaintiffs withdrew their motion to stay the mandate “[b]ecause Defendants’ position is clear that the issuance of the mandate does not preclude settlement or Plaintiffs’ ability to seek future relief from the issuance of the mandate.” 03/05/2021 Not Available Download Mandate issued. 03/01/2021 Opposition Download Opposition to motion to stay the mandate filed by appellants. The federal defendants filed their opposition to the motion to stay the mandate, arguing that the Supreme Court was unlikely to grant the petition, “much less reverse this Court’s judgment,” because the Ninth Circuit had applied settled precedent. The U.S. defendants also contended that the plaintiffs would not suffer irreparable harm, given that they would be able to obtain relief if the Supreme Court ruled in their favor. The defendants also noted that issuance of the mandate “is no impediment to settlement” since settlement remained possible so long as a case was pending, even if pending before the Supreme Court. 02/17/2021 Motion Download Motion to stay the mandate filed by plaintiffs. The plaintiffs filed a motion to stay the mandate pending the filing and disposition of a petition for writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court. The plaintiffs contended that their certiorari petition would present substantial questions meriting Supreme Court review regarding the rights of children, and that there was good cause to stay the mandate due to the irreparable harm that would result from dismissal of the case. The plaintiffs’ arguments included that the Biden-Harris administration should be allowed the opportunity to decide whether to engage in settlement negotiations. 02/10/2021 Order Download Petition for rehearing en banc denied. Ninth Circuit Denied Rehearing in Youth Plaintiffs’ Constitutional Climate Case Against Federal Defendants. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied youth plaintiffs’ petition for rehearing en banc of the court’s January 2020 ruling that the plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue their constitutional claims against the United States and other federal defendants for infringing on the plaintiffs’ right to a life-sustaining climate system. 06/22/2020 Letter Download Letter filed by plaintiffs regarding supplemental authority (Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia). 06/22/2020 Letter Download Letter filed by plaintiffs-appellees regarding supplemental authority (Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia). 06/03/2020 Letter Download Letter filed by plaintiffs-appellees regarding supplemental authority (In re: Flint Water Cases). 03/24/2020 Opposition Download Appellants filed opposition to petition for rehearing en banc. Federal Government Filed Brief Opposing Rehearing Request in Juliana. On March 24, 2020, the federal defendants filed their opposition to the rehearing petition. They argued that the panel had properly concluded that the plaintiffs sought no relief that the courts had the power to grant and that the plaintiffs failed to establish that the relief sought would “substantially redress” their injuries. The defendants also contended that there was no legal question of exceptional importance that warranted rehearing. 03/12/2020 Amicus Brief Download Brief filed by amici curiae children's rights advocates in support of plaintiffs-appellees' petition for rehearing en banc. Children’s rights advocates filed a brief contending that the majority overlooked precedent recognizing “a special judicial role in protecting children where children are explicitly excluded from influencing policies detrimental to them.” 03/12/2020 Amicus Brief Download Amicus curiae brief filed in support of plaintiffs-appellees' petition for rehearing en banc by environmental and climate advocacy groups. Environmental groups argued that the majority improperly “infused political question principles into redressability analysis” and “failed to recognize that partial redressability is sufficient to establish standing,” which could create obstacles for the groups to obtain relief in the future. 03/12/2020 Amicus Brief Download Brief filed by amici curiae former surgeons general in support of plaintiffs-appellees' petition for rehearing en banc. Two former Surgeons General argued that where the health and lives of children are at stake courts should intervene since children have no remedy at the “ballot box.” 03/12/2020 Amicus Brief Download Brief filed by academic centers in support of appellees' petition for rehearing en banc. Academic centers focused on issues of race, racial justice, and environmental justice said they supported rehearing because they were “deeply concerned that the majority’s decision will make it more difficult for individuals and groups to safeguard their civil rights in the courts.” 03/12/2020 Amicus Brief Download Amicus curiae brief filed by international organizations lawyers in support of plaintiffs-appellants' petition for rehearing en banc. International organizations and lawyers submitted a brief describing foreign jurisprudence that supported the redressability of the plaintiffs’ claims and judicial ability to review climate policies. 03/12/2020 Amicus Brief Download Brief filed by League of Women Voters of the U.S., League of Women Voters of Oregon, and National Children's Campaign as amici curiae in support of appellees' petition for rehearing en banc. Two League of Women Voters organizations and the National Children’s Campaign contended that the majority opinion “contravenes longstanding precedent and abdicates the judiciary’s duty to safeguard fundamental rights, particularly those of children without voting power.” 03/12/2020 Amicus Brief Download Brief filed by amici curiae members of Congress in support of plaintiffs-appellees. Members of Congress asserted that the courts had the power and the duty to remedy the plaintiffs’ constitutional injuries. 03/12/2020 Amicus Brief Download Brief filed by amici curiae public health experts, public health organizations, and doctors in support of plaintiffs-appellees' petition for rehearing en banc. Public health experts and organizations and doctors submitted a brief describing the risks climate change poses to children’s health. 03/12/2020 Amicus Brief Download Amicus curiae brief filed by youth experts in support of plaintiffs-appellees. Seventeen of the experts who had prepared expert opinions in the Juliana case said their opinions went “to the salient issues in this case, including the ability of the federal government to redress the youth plaintiffs’ injuries.” 03/11/2020 Amicus Brief Download Brief filed by amici curiae law professors in support of plaintiffs-appellees' petition for rehearing en banc. Law professors argued both that “the panel’s majority incorrectly invoked the political question doctrine in determining whether youth plaintiffs possess standing” and that there were “well-established judicially discoverable and manageable constitutional standards” to evaluate and remedy the plaintiffs’ claims. 03/02/2020 Petition for Rehearing Download Petition for rehearing en banc filed by plaintiffs-appellees. Juliana Plaintiffs Sought En Banc Rehearing of Ninth Circuit Determination that They Lacked Standing. The plaintiffs in Juliana v. United States sought en banc reconsideration of the Ninth Circuit’s ruling that they did not have standing to pursue their claims against the federal government for alleged violations of their constitutional rights, including a substantive due process right to a “climate system capable of sustaining human life.” The plaintiffs argued that the Ninth Circuit majority made “significant errors of law,” including by finding that declaratory relief was not sufficient to establish the redressability prong of standing. The plaintiffs also argued that the Ninth Circuit majority erroneously rejected partial redress of injury as a basis for standing, incorrectly concluded that Article III courts lacked power to institute a remedial plan to redress the plaintiffs’ injuries, and improperly “created a new redressability test infused with the political question analysis” from Supreme Court precedent. The plaintiffs contended that the Ninth Circuit’s decision therefore met every test for en banc reconsideration since it implicated “profoundly important issues” of catastrophic climate change harms to children; conflicted with Supreme Court, Ninth Circuit, and sister circuit law; and affected the national uniformity of the application of the law of redressability. The plaintiffs asserted that an en banc rehearing was particularly appropriate in this case because it involved children’s constitutional rights. They said that over the past decade, the Ninth Circuit had “consistently granted rehearing in cases where children’s constitutional rights were denied by the 3-judge panel, only denying rehearing in such cases where the 3-judge panel originally upheld the children’s rights or allowed them to pursue their claims in another tribunal.” 01/17/2020 Opinion Download District court's certified orders reversed and case remanded to the district court with instructions to dismiss for lack of Article III standing; plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction pending appeal denied; plaintiffs' motions for judicial notice granted. Divided Ninth Circuit Said Juliana Plaintiffs Lacked Standing to Press Constitutional Climate Claims Against Federal Government. In a split decision, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that young people and other plaintiffs asserting a claim against the federal government for infringement of a Fifth Amendment due process right to a “climate system capable of sustaining human life” did not have Article III standing. The Ninth Circuit therefore reversed the orders of the federal district court for the District of Oregon denying the government’s motions to dismiss and for summary judgment and judgment on the pleadings. The Ninth Circuit rejected the government’s argument that the plaintiffs’ constitutional claims had to be brought pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act and agreed with the district court that the plaintiffs met the injury and causation requirements for Article III standing because at least some plaintiffs had alleged concrete and particularized injuries caused by fossil fuel carbon emissions that were increased by federal subsidies and leases. The Ninth Circuit found, however, that the plaintiffs had not established the redressability requirement for standing. The court said it was “skeptical” that even the first prong of redressability—that the relief sought be substantially likely to redress the plaintiffs’ injuries—was satisfied, noting that the plaintiffs conceded “that their requested relief will not alone solve global climate change.” The Ninth Circuit further concluded that even if the first prong was satisfied, the plaintiffs did not “surmount the remaining hurdle” of establishing that the relief they sought was within the power of Article III courts. The majority wrote that “[t]here is much to recommend the adoption of a comprehensive scheme to decrease fossil fuel emissions and combat climate change, both as a policy matter in general and a matter of national survival in particular,” but said it was beyond judicial power “to order, design, supervise, or implement the plaintiffs’ requested remedial plan.” The majority said it “reluctantly” concluded that “the plaintiffs’ case must be made to the political branches or to the electorate at large” and “[t]hat the other branches may have abdicated their responsibility to remediate the problem does not confer on Article III courts, no matter how well-intentioned, the ability to step into their shoes.” The dissenting judge would have held that the plaintiffs had standing and that they had asserted claims under the Constitution and presented sufficient evidence to proceed to a trial. The dissent contended that “a federal court need not manage all of the delicate foreign relations and regulatory minutiae implicated by climate change to offer real relief, and the mere fact that this suit cannot alone halt climate change does not mean that it presents no claim suitable for judicial resolution.” 12/27/2019 Response Download Response filed by appellants to appellees' supplemental motion seeking judicial notice. 12/20/2019 Motion Download Supplemental motion filed by plaintiffs seeking judicial notice in support of plaintiffs' urgent motion under Circuit Rule 27-3(b) for preliminary injunction. 09/16/2019 Letter Download Letter filed by federal government in response to plaintiffs-appellees' September 6, 2019 notice of supplemental authority. 09/06/2019 Letter Download Letter filed by plaintiffs-appellees regarding supplemental authority. 08/09/2019 Letter Download Letter filed by plaintiffs-appellants in response to the federal government's August 6, 2019 letter regarding supplemental authority. 08/06/2019 Letter Download Letter regarding supplemental authority filed by the federal government. 08/06/2019 Letter Download Letter filed by plaintiffs-appellees in response to August 1, 2019 notice of supplemental authority. 08/01/2019 Letter Download Letter filed by federal government regarding supplemental authority. 07/24/2019 Letter Download Letter filed by the federal government regarding supplemental authority. 07/12/2019 Letter Download Letter filed by federal government in response to the plaintiffs-appellees' July 5, 2019 letter regarding supplemental authority. 07/10/2019 Letter Download Letter filed by plaintiffs-appellees regarding supplemental authority. 07/05/2019 Letter Download Letter filed by plaintiffs-appellees regarding supplemental authority. 06/04/2019 Not Available Oral argument held.

The plaintiffs asserted that the documents both “provide additional evidence of Defendants’ systemic practices that serve to intensify and lock in Plaintiffs’ irreparable harms” and also “confirm the severity of Plaintiffs’ irreparable injuries by presenting additional evidence that the U.S. fossil fuel-based energy system is further expanding.” 05/20/2019 Notice Download Notice of supplemental authority submitted by plaintiffs-appellees.

On May 8, the plaintiffs wrote that the Ninth Circuit’s recent decision in an action challenging statewide policies and practices in Arizona’s foster care system was pertinent to the Juliana plaintiffs’ standing, as well as to the issues of judicial authority to hear systemic due process cases and the plaintiffs’ state-created danger claim. 03/08/2019 Reply Download Reply brief filed by appellants. Briefing Completed, Oral Argument Scheduled for June 4 in Juliana v. United States. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals scheduled oral argument for the federal government’s appeal in Juliana v. United States to take place in Portland, Oregon, on Tuesday, June 4, 2019, at 9:30 AM. Briefing was completed on March 8 when the federal government filed its reply brief. The government rearticulated its arguments that the plaintiffs lacked standing and that their lawsuit was not a cognizable case or controversy under Article III of the Constitution. The government contended that a “quick look at the climate change issues and actions pending before Congress and the Executive Branch”—including the Green New Deal, carbon tax legislation, and the replacement for the Clean Power Plan—“confirms that Plaintiffs have petitioned the wrong branch.” The government also argued that the plaintiffs were required to proceed under the Administrative Procedure Act and that their constitutional claims failed on the merits. In addition, the government countered the plaintiffs’ argument that the Ninth Circuit should reconsider its decision to permit the appeal. 03/01/2019 Amicus Brief Download Brief of business amici curiae filed in support of plaintiffs-appellees. 03/01/2019 Amicus Brief Download Amicus brief filed by Center for International Environmental Law and Environmental Law Alliance Worldwide—US in support of plaintiffs-appellees. 03/01/2019 Amicus Brief Download Amicus brief filed by EarthRights International, Center for Biological Diversity, Defenders of Wildlife, and Union of Concerned Scientists in support of plaintiffs-appellees. 03/01/2019 Amicus Brief Download Brief of amici curiae environmental history professors filed in support of plaintiffs-appellees' answering brief. 03/01/2019 Amicus Brief Download Brief of amici curiae Food & Water Watch, Inc., Friends of the Earth - US, and Greenpeace, Inc. in support of plaintiffs-appellees. 03/01/2019 Amicus Brief Download Brief filed by amicus curiae law professors. 03/01/2019 Amicus Brief Download Amici curiae brief of Leagues of Women Voters filed in support of plaintiffs-appellees. 03/01/2019 Amicus Brief Download Amici curiae brief of members of the United States Congress filed in support of plaintiffs-appellees. 03/01/2019 Amicus Brief Download Brief of amicus curiae Niskanen Center filed in support of plaintiffs-appellees. 03/01/2019 Amicus Brief Download Brief of amici curiae public health experts, public health organizations, and doctors filed in support of plaintiffs-appellees seeking affirmance. 03/01/2019 Amicus Brief Download Brief of amicus curiae Sierra Club filed in support of plaintiffs-appellees. 03/01/2019 Amicus Brief Download Brief of amicus curiae Sunrise Movement Education Fund filed. 03/01/2019 Amicus Brief Download Brief of amicus curiae Zero Hour on behalf of approximately 32,340 children and young people filed in support of plaintiffs-appellees. 02/28/2019 Amicus Brief Download Brief of amicus curiae International Lawyers for International Law filed in support of plaintiffs-appellees.

Plaintiffs Filed Answering Brief. On February 22, 2019, the plaintiffs filed their answering brief on the merits of the appeal. The brief began by asking the Ninth Circuit to reconsider its certification of the interlocutory appeal. The plaintiffs argued that the district court orders did not address most of the plaintiffs’ claims, meaning that—except for the issues relating to standing and whether the lawsuit was required to be brought under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)—the case would go forward regardless of how the Ninth Circuit ruled. The plaintiffs further argued that the APA and standing issues did not meet the test for interlocutory review. The plaintiffs then proceeded to argue that the district court had jurisdiction of the case, that the district court had not erred in allowing the case to proceed directly under the Constitution, and that they had asserted valid substantive due process, state-created danger, and public trust claims. 02/19/2019 Opposition Download Opposition filed by appellants to motion for injunction pending appeal. Government Opposed Request for Preliminary Injunctive Relief. On February 19, 2019, the government filed its opposition to the plaintiffs’ motion, asserting that it should be denied both because of the plaintiffs’ “long delay” in seeking preliminary relief and also because the plaintiffs did not satisfy any of the four factors for preliminary injunctive relief. The government argued that the timing of the plaintiffs’ motion exposed their strategy of delaying appellate review since interlocutory appellate review would have been automatic had the plaintiffs sought and received preliminary injunctive relief. On the merits of the motion, the government contended that the plaintiffs were required to meet a heightened standard since they sought relief that went “well beyond simply maintaining the status quo.” Reiterating the arguments made in its opening brief, the government said the plaintiffs were unlikely to prevail on their claims. The government also argued that the plaintiffs had not met their burden of showing that they would be irreparably harmed in the absence of the relief during the pendency of the appeal. Finally, the government asserted that the balance of harms and the public interest both weighed against granting injunctive relief. The government again cited the plaintiffs’ delay in seeking preliminary relief and contested the plaintiffs’ “blithe assertion” that the injunction would not result in harm to employment, the economy, energy security, or the treasury. 02/07/2019 Amicus Brief Download Brief of amici curiae Nuckels Oil Co. et al. filed in support of defendants-appellants United States of America. 02/07/2019 Declaration Download Declaration of Dr. James E.

Juliana Plaintiffs Asked Ninth Circuit to Bar Federal Authorizations of Fossil Fuel Development and Infrastructure During Government’s Appeal. On February 7, 2019, the youth plaintiffs in the climate change-based constitutional case against the federal government filed an “urgent motion” in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals seeking a preliminary injunction pending the resolution of the government’s appeal of the Oregon district court’s denial of the governments’ motions to end the case. The plaintiffs asked the court to bar the government from authorizing the following activities “in the absence of a national plan that ensures the … authorizations are consistent with preventing further danger” to the plaintiffs: (1) mining or extraction of coal on federal public lands; (2) offshore oil and gas exploration, development, or extraction on the Outer Continental Shelf; and (3) development of new fossil fuel infrastructure such as pipelines and fossil fuel export facilities. The plaintiffs argued that the immediate relief was necessary to preserve their ability to obtain a remedy that would address their injuries and protect the public interest. The plaintiffs filed 16 declarations in support of their motion, including the declarations of several individual plaintiffs attesting to “intense impacts to their mental and emotional wellbeing” and declarations of the plaintiffs’ experts on climate science, climate change impacts, and the connection between climate change and the government’s decisions and actions. 02/04/2019 Order Download Calendaring order issued. On February 4, 2019, the Ninth Circuit announced that oral argument in the Juliana v. United States appeal would be calendared during the week of June 3-7, 2019 in Portland, Oregon. The court later also sought information on the parties’ availability during the weeks of July 8 and October 21. 02/01/2019 Brief Download Opening brief filed by appellants. Government Filed Opening Ninth Circuit Brief in Juliana. The government filed its opening brief in the appeal on February 1. The government argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing and that the lawsuit “is categorically not a case or controversy within the meaning of Article III” because it would require courts to “review and assess the entirety of Congress’s and the Executive Branch’s programs and regulatory decisions relating to climate change and then to pass on the comprehensive constitutionality of all of those policies, programs, and inaction in the aggregate.” The government also contended that the plaintiffs were required to proceed under the Administrative Procedure Act and that their constitutional claims were without merit. In addition, the government asserted that there was no federal public trust doctrine and that, even if there were, the Clean Air Act had displaced it. The government further argued that even if the federal public trust doctrine existed and had not been displaced, it would not cover the “climate system” or atmosphere. 02/01/2019 Not Available Download Government filed excerpts of record (Volume 1). 02/01/2019 Not Available Download Government filed excerpts of record (Volume 2). 02/01/2019 Not Available Download Government filed excerpts of record (Volume 3). 01/07/2019 Order Download Motion to expedite granted in part. Expedited Briefing Schedule Set.

The government must file its opening brief by February 1, a response brief is due February 22, and an optional reply brief would be due March 8. The court denied as moot the government’s request that its obligation to respond to the motion to expedite be postponed due to the government shutdown. 01/04/2019 Response Download Response filed by plaintiffs-appellees to the request of defendants-appellants to postpone their obligation to respond to motion to expedite appeal. 01/03/2019 Request Download Request filed by defendants-appellants to postpone their obligation to respond to plaintiffs-appellees' motion to expedite appeal. 01/02/2019 Motion Download Motion filed by plaintiffs-appellees to expedite appeal and to set schedule for briefing and oral argument."
