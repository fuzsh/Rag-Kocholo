Catch the latest updates here\n\nBS Web Team New Delhi\n\nInterim Budget 2024: FM Nirmala Sitharaman addressing a post-Budget press conference (Photo: ANI)\n\nInterim Budget 2024 LIVE news updates: Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her Interim Budget, raised the Centre’s capital expenditure (capex) target by 16.9 per cent for financial year 2024-25 (FY25) to Rs 11.1 trillion over the Revised Estimates (RE) for FY24.

The opposition Congress, on the other hand, said the budget was useless as it did not give any relief to the people from high taxes. \"The union interim budget presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the aspirations of crores of people in the country. It has all elements for taking care of every section of society,\" CM said in a post on X. \"The budget will give direction and energy to achieve the prime minister's goal of Viksit Bharat by 2047,\" he said.

Reacting to the interim Budget which was presented in Parliament on Thursday, Union Minister Rajnath Singh said it outlines the vision for a \"confident, strong and self-reliant Viksit Bharat\".

In a post on X, he said there is something in this Budget for \"every section of the society\".

But this interim Budget that she has presented is very encouraging and raises hope for the way ahead also. And the size of India's economy at this time... I am assured that whatever indications we have received from this Budget, the size of our economy, which is in top five counties right now, will grow to more than $5 trillion by 2027. By 2030, it will grow to more than $7 trillion,\" Singh told reporters outside Parliament. Union Home Minister Amit Shah said the interim Budget 2024-25 draws the roadmap to achieve Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of a developed Bharat by 2047.\n\nAddressing a press conference, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the Centre is on track to meet the glide path set in 2021-22 and that the government was well on track to meet the 4.5 per cent or below fiscal deficit by FY26.

The most pleasing words from the budget: \"No changes in taxation. It's a budget that focuses on the continuation of policy and doesn't introduce any surprises. It's a budget prepared keeping in mind that global fiscal expenditure may decrease this year, and the global monetary policy may tighten. The government has assumed an increase in total expenditure of 6.1% YoY in FY25. This is the lowest growth in 8 years, and less than half of the 8-year average of 12.4%. The budget has a negative fiscal impulse, with the gross fiscal deficit contracting by Rs. 49,000 crores and the primary deficit reducing by Rs. 1.8 lakh crores. The bond market has rejoiced with a drop in yields, and rightfully so. Gross and net borrowing for FY25 are lower than FY24. The fiscal deficit is expected at 5.1% for FY25, a reduction of 0.7%. With India getting included in global bond indices and the supply of Govt. Securities estimated to be lower, it will lift a major hurdle for the RBI to exercise a more neutral to easy monetary policy - advantage duration funds,\" Sahil Kapoor, Head - Products and Market Strategist at DSP Mutual Fund on Budget.\n\nUnion budget: Rs 8.5k cr allocated for WR's Gujarat works, Rs 25k given to NHSRCL\n\nThe Mumbai-headquartered Western Railway said Rs 8,587 crore has been allocated for railway works on its network in Gujarat in the interim budget presented on Thursday, which is 14 times the Rs 580 crore average annual outlay between 2009 and 2014.\n\nThe WR release quoted Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw.\n\nThe release further said the outlay for Madhya Pradesh is Rs 15,143 crore, which is 24 times the average outlay of Rs. 632 crore from 2009 to 2014.\n\nTotal investment of Rs 30,789 crore is being made in Gujarat, where 97 per cent of the route has been electrified and 856 road overbridges and road underbridges have been constructed in the last 10 years, the WR release quoted Vaishnaw as saying.\n\n\"Twenty-eight 'one station one product' stalls are functional in Gujarat, while 87 stations in the state are being re-developed under Amrit Bharat Station Scheme.
