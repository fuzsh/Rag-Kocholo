One of the best resources is the AWS documentation. The #AWS documentation is comprehensive and well-written, and it covers all aspects of AWS ML. Found a similar good post from AWS on ML. Worth watching... https://lnkd.in/d_Vc4EfY #aws #awscloud #cloudcomputing #awscommunity\n\nView my verified achievement from Amazon Web Services (AWS). Takeaways: 1) It was useful to see how AWS \"officially\" approached solving ML/AI problems I already encounter. 2) I am now much more confident about the breadth of my knowledge in ML/AI, and I know what tools to reach for in a much wider range of tasks.\n\n🎉 AWS brings choice to the Foundation Model world, diversity is the right-most focus as not one GenAI model works for all situation (right tool, right task). Bedrocks supports LLAMA 2, Claude, Titan (AWS trained models), and many more. Their ease of use and breadth of catalog enables organizations to explore, innovate, and do so with low risk.
