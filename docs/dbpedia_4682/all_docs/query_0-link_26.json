Edited excerpts from an interview with ET:\n\nMarkets have seen sharp swings and extreme volatility since the beginning of the calendar year. The Nifty was down 12% in the first couple of months, only to recover 11% subsequently. What’s your view on the valuations now?\n\nThe markets in India have behaved similar to the global markets. Locally, companies have reported weak earnings, while globally things have been volatile. Our domestic economy is very much in early stages of a recovery and the economy is well positioned for next 3-5 years, to that extent the market outlook would be supportive.\n\nTo me what is more important is when traction is coming back to corporate earnings, which at this point is not clear. Hence, from a valuations stand point this is more of a challenge. Last year in March the Sensex was at a 30% premium to long-term average. While this year at Budget time it was at par with long-term average multiple. Today, it is back to 15-17% premium to its long-term average.\n\nSo we have a combination of valuations are slightly at premium and earnings behind, so not a very happy situation. I see this market bouncing around till it can get clearer confidence from the economy.\n\nMany believe that a good monsoon could act as a catalyst to earnings revival. When do you think earnings could revive?\n\nThe monsoon by itself cannot have a dramatic effect on earnings. We are at a point where after two bad monsoons, the issue is not just about the loss of economic output due to poor monsoons, it is also about the extent of human suffering because of there being a shortage of water in large parts of the country. Hopefully, a good monsoon will address that issue.\n\nAs far as improving health of the farm sector is concerned, a good monsoon cannot dramatically change things, it could impact consumer sentiment which will be positive, but I am not sure it can move the needle in terms of the agriculture sector where other reforms may be needed.\n\nGiven the challenge to earnings growth, which part of the market do you find comfort in?\n\nEarnings have been a challenge. Commodity companies and exporters have experienced problems, several companies have low capacity utilisation, and many have deep financial issues. All these factors are feeding into lack of profit growth. Over the next 3-5 years, businesses like financials, industrials, consumer discretionary with very core domestic plays will benefit as growth revives, as capacity utilisation and consumer sentiment improve. These are sectors where profit can go up.\n\nThe challenge is how much of this is reflected in valuations. Some of the valuations already reflect the potential for bounce back in profits.\n\nThe challenge is in identifying stocks which we are willing to back, where there is comfort, because these companies have gone through difficult times and are well placed to benefit from growth as and when it happens. Credit growth in banking is in low double digits or high single digit, but some institutions are growing credit at 20%-plus. Here valuations may not be cheap but are not exorbitant.\n\nWill you play contrarian bets like metals and PSU banks?\n\nWe want to see stocks that are actually derated in terms of valuations not just because the prices have fallen. The question is whether the company under consideration still has a fundamentally good business model? Is the balance sheet strong enough to absorb the pressures that the business is experiencing. When I look at it from that view point, we find some companies with strong balance sheets but weak P&L account because the environment is difficult.\n\nWe don’t mind backing those companies. But if the company is in a situation where not only the P&L is weak but balance sheet is fundamentally being challenged and capital adequacy, debt to equity is in deep distress then we are not comfortable. On those entities you have to prove survival is guaranteed and then worry where growth will come.\n\nWhat is the outlook for global growth? Does it look better now?\n\nThe challenge from post global financial crisis has been that the world has not got that kind of acceleration coming out of a difficult period as we have got in the past. The US is doing well but not able to accelerate, in the past coming out of recession, it accelerated to 4-5% GDP growth, now it is stuck to 2-3%.\n\nThe global environment in terms of growth is not very supportive at this time. Central banks have done what they could, but in a world which has too much debt, we are perhaps experiencing the point that further liquidity infusion is not having too much of a positive impact. Hence from global growth perspective, some new prescription needs to be tried.\n\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2024 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
