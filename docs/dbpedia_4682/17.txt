Latest reviews of Sri Lanka Radio Player + Alarm Clock app for iPhone and iPad

Excellent. From California

Living in the United States, I had always wanted to remain connected to Sri Lankan media. Now that I got this excellent app. on my phone I can listen to my favorite channels while on the go, even in a remote cowboy town in America. Thanks.

Does not work

There is no difference between thins app and the free ones that are available on app store. Just like the free versions few work, most does not. Dont waste your money. Buy a small burger for tht 99c. :-)

Worst app

May be because mine is a bad review it did not let me submit it with just no star or one star. So i am giving more stars to get this published. This is for money but only 4-5 stations work. Have listed all radio stations in Sri Lanka but non of them work except for the fist 4 or 5. I had this app for about 5 moths now still it is only those few stations at work for all this time. I keep it because it has the one station I wanted running. There are free apps with more working stations. Dont buy this one. Its a fraud.
