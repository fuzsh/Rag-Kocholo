The lad introduces himself as Sukeban, and a classmate, Michiko, takes him to after-school activities. Lessons on humility turn violent when a masked hatchet-wielding woman turns up. Jealousy, syringes of hormones, bare breasts, a blood bath, and more figure in the resolution.",

        "text": "I just need my trans friends to know that in this movie the lead character, who is a cis man played by a cis woman, is transformed into a cis woman by a magical estrogen hormone syringe. This is done by the leader of the evil gang, who is a cis woman, and in love with our lead character, but is a lesbian, and thus, forced the character to be transformed to meet the criteria of her sexuality. Then the evil cis woman gang leader is accidentally stabbed with a magical testosterone hormone syringe and she grows a penis, transforming her into a trans woman (?). Obviously, our lead character who is now a cis woman wants the testosterone shot…\n\nI may need to reassess how I feel about Noboru Iguchi. I first saw Machine Girl at the height of that particular brand of Japanese film. Loud squelchy sounds, goofy effects, that digital mid-2000s look—the first couple of films like this were okay, but then I found it exhausting as they bombarded DVD shelves across the world, drowning out any other cinematic efforts from the East. Long past the saturation of that kind of film, watching Iguchi's Sukeban Boy, I felt none of the exhaustion. In fact, I thoroughly enjoyed every endearingly stupid moment. From the get go, this is deliriously ridiculous. Dumb fights, freeze frames, rampant vomiting, every line shouted or growled. From there, it only gets more wild…\n\nOur lovely Gun Woman Asami stars as a boy with a feminine face who gets transferred to an all-girl school so he doesn’t get teased about his looks anymore in this early feature from director Noboru Iguchi of The Machine Girl and Dead Sushi fame.\n\nWhile this probably sounds tame compared to Iguchi’s later films this one might just be his most insane.\n\nThere’s a bunch of strangely themed girl clubs, like the no bra one or one that teaches humility and feminine behaviour (what the fuck?) where the girls have to strip in front of each other and there’s a masked supervillain with a whip and girls shooting bullets with their mouths and others parrying those bullets with table…\n\ni was sold on this film by willow maclay's review which describes how in this film our cis man protagonist (played by a cis woman) is force-femmed by a cis woman lesbian love interest with magic estrogen but then the love interest is injected with magic testosterone so each become trans women (?) who love each other thus this film is mtftf/ftf/t4t. the problem is that thinking about this premise is far better than anything this film actually offers. this post-gender \"our love is all that matters\" message would be lovely if it were earned at all rather than bookending what is effectively an hour of mediocre improv filled with trademark japanese absurdist humor, light erotic body horror (isn't that…\n\nevery second that passes, somewhere out in the universe an asteroid obliterates some planet w/ sentient life just harnessed nuclear power, and also some group of people who were once friends vows to murder each other due to re-iterating some conversation about \"are asexuals queer\" or he/him lesbians as if any of it matters\n\nim in a demographic of people that prominently Cares about gender and ive been in it for nearing a decade now and theres literally nothing left to say. all conversations about it are instilled by the cia or capital-maximizing algorithms or something. who gives a fuck? sukeban boy is the representation i always wanted. everything is already a giant degenerate game and once you accept it…"
