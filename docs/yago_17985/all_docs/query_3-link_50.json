        "text": "Prison School, a manga and anime based around the sexual and ridiculous escapades of students from Hachimitsu Academy, has been slated to receive a live-action drama for some time. Today, the official website debuted the costumes for the cast.\n\nThe new series will be directed by Noboru Iguchi, an over the top director who started by directing adult videos. Known for his bombastic and disgusting films such as Machine Girl and Zombie Ass, Iguchi is the perfect pick for an already ridiculous and sexualized series such as Prison School. An example of Iguchi’s outrageous directing can be found in the following trailer for his film, Robo Geisha:\n\nHere is the official description for Prison School by Yen Press, the publisher for the English release for Prison School:\n\nHachimitsu Private Academy was a revered and elite all-girls’ boarding school on the outskirts of Tokyo…once upon a time. But with the new school year comes a revision to school policy: Boys are to be admitted into the student body for the first time ever. But on his first day at Hachimitsu, Kiyoshi Fujino discovers that he’s one of only five boys enrolled at the school. Their numbers overwhelmed by the thousand girls in the student body, is it heaven or hell that awaits these five (un)fortunates?\n\nThe live-action drama is slated to debut in Japan on MBS October 25th."
