        "text": "(c) 2011 Karate-Robo Zaborgar Film Partners\n\nDon’t take it seriously. A real tokusatsu (special-effects film)\n\nwhich focuses on the fun of ridiculous effects.\n\nThe hero with his racing engine that can take on all kinds of\n\nrobotic forms fights against even more ridiculous robot monsters.\n\nOnce a cult TV series.—from IFFR official catalogue 2011\n\nI read in the news that the world premiere showing of director\n\nNoboru Iguchi’s KARATE-ROBO ZABORGER was livened up\n\nby his on-stage antics. He appeared on stage wearing\n\nonly a sumo style loincloth, and engaged in a performance\n\nof the bean-throwing ceremony, which is the traditional\n\nJapanese event known as “Setsubun”.\n\nAbout Director Noboru Iguchi\n\nDirector Noboru Iguchi is a cult figure in Europe and New York.\n\nHe is the secret weapon of Otona-keikaku\n\n(pure translation is “Adult Plan”,\n\npopular theater performing group headed by Kankuro Kudo).\n\nHe makes films like….\n\nA beautiful girl, who is in fact a mutant bred to fight, and….\n\nan Ancient Dogoo girl who arrives in modern times to help a bumpkin,\n\nand…\n\nthe story of a fighting Geisha Robot girl,\n\nand…\n\nthe story of a girl with a machine gun arm,\n\nand so on. These films have won great popularity.\n\nAnyway, he is an extraordinary director,\n\nwho is making films for the overseas market mostly under\n\nSUSHI TYPHOON label from Nikkatsu.\n\nI thinkm he is an unusual director, with an inner fortitude,\n\nthat has garnered him regular fans – afficianados of his world.\n\nAt the moment it is not a stretch of the truth to say that\n\nboth Takeshi Kitano and Mr Iguchi are the only Japanese directors\n\nwho have a large fan-base throughout the world.\n\nKitano is artistic and Iguchi is fantastic.\n\nThey are both extremes, but on closer examination their world view\n\nmight be getting closer as “quantity” changes into “quality”.\n\nBy the way, director Iguchi’s fantastic relates to\n\nthe fantasy, horror and psychological film festivals and\n\nfans of these sort of films.\n\nThere are many festivals throughout the world\n\ncatering for these sort of films,\n\nso I imagine that director Iguchi is always\n\non tour overseas to meet with his fans.\n\nI do not think it is too much to say that\n\nthe Japanese are now proud to be called a “freak culture”.\n\nHowever, the fans of “fantastic” films are fussy\n\nabout what is their favourite films, their likes and dislikes,\n\nand of course, the market for such films is small.\n\nHis website proclaims in its title:\n\n“I am sure only boys will see my film,\n\nso I challenge the girls to come as well!”\n\nHis films are taking a firm hold on a specific strata for film fans.\n\nIt is great point in his favour, and assures that a lot of people are\n\nlooking forward to his next film.\n\nI just wonder why Japanese theatrical release is not yet fixed?!?!\n\nBecause industry people don’t take this seriously? LOL !!\n\nNext, I’ll talk about this traditional a sumo style loincloth."
