Enter Noboru Iguchi, a Japanese film director with an impressive 48 titles under his belt, each one as fucked up and ridiculous as the last.\n\nIguchi started out directing adult movies in the early nineties, with iconic titles such as Doctor’s Enema and Double Horny, but has moved on to making horror/gore flicks as porno was a bit tame for his tastes. If you took Hostel or SAW, removed all the realistic special effects and CGI, asked a group of 13 year old boys what their favourite body parts, functions and fluids were, added as many stereotypical Japanese things as you could think of and poured an oil tanker of corn syrup and red food colouring on top of it all you would have one of Noboru Iguchi’s films.\n\nâ˜› More Fucked Up Movies: 10 Films That Will Make you Lose Faith In Life Itself\n\nHere are a few trailers for his movies on the following pages (NSFW):"
