        "text": "Noboru Iguchi (井口昇, Iguchi Noboru?) is a Japanese film director, screenwriter and actor. He has worked as a director in adult video (AV) as well as in the horror and gore genres.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life and career\n\n1.1 Adult videos\n\n1.2 Mainstream film\n\n2 Selected filmography\n\n2.1 Adult Videos (AV) - Director\n\n2.2 Theatrical films - Director\n\n3 Notes\n\n4 Sources\n\nLife and career\n\nIguchi was born on June 28, 1969.[1] In an interview he said he was influenced in his work by the ghost houses and freak shows he went to as a child in Japanese play lands and that his aim in his films is to both entertain and surprise.[2]\n\nAdult videos\n\nIn his extensive career as an AV director, Iguchi has worked for a number of studios including CineMagic, Big Morkal, Try-Heart, h.m.p and Soft On Demand (SOD). Nana Natsume and Risa Coda have been among the AV Idols featured in his videos.[3] His videos have explored several of the typical Japanese AV genres, from incest for SOD[4] to \"nakadashi\",[5] bondage,[6] group sex[7] and some enema fetish videos for CineMagic.[8][9]\n\nHis video Final Pussy starring Nana Natsume won the Best Rental Video Award at the 2005 SOD Awards.[10] In this January 2005 video, Natsume's character (as the result of a military experiment gone wrong) has guns burst from her breasts when sexually aroused. The special makeup effects were by Yoshihiro Nishimura.[11][12]\n\nMainstream film\n\nOne of Iguchi's early movies was Kurushime-san (クルシメさん) which was first released in 1997. Iguchi was screenwriter, editor, cinematographer and director of the black comedy-horror film which won the Encouragement Prize at the 1998 Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival and starred Aki Arai, Miako Tadano and Tomoko Matsunashi.[13][14]\n\nIn 2003, Iguchi wrote and directed the horror comedy A Larva to Love (恋する幼虫, Koi-suru Yōchū?) (with effects by Yoshihiro Nishimura) about a strange relationship involving a boy, a girl, and a parasite.[15][16] Iguchi also wrote and directed the February 2006 film Sukeban Boy or Oira Sukeban (おいら女蛮 スケバン, Oira sukeban?) with AV star Asami.[17][18] At an interview at the New York Asian Film Festival, Iguchi told of an incident where one of the actresses in the movie, completely unaware of her role, balked at doing action scenes totally naked. According to Iguchi \"We had to calm her down, capture her, and convince her to do the job ... We made it so she could not leave the set ... [in] America we would have been sued.\"[19]\n\nLater in 2006, Iguchi directed Cat-Eyed Boy (猫目小僧, Nekome kozō?) based on the manga by Kazuo Umezu.[20][21] The movie, with gravure idol Miku Ishida, Asami Kumakiri, Hiromasa Taguchi, Naoto Takenaka and Kanji Tsuda, was released theatrically in Japan in June 2006, and on DVD in October of the same year.[22]\n\nIguchi was also both the screenwriter and director for the 2008 action and gore cult film The Machine Girl (片腕マシンガール, Kataude mashin gāru?) where he once again teamed up with Yoshihiro Nishimura who did the special effects and makeup effects.[23][24] Iguchi said he wanted to make an action movie with a woman fighting and it started with just an idea of a girl losing her arm and going out for revenge and was originally called \"One Armed Big Busty Girl\" - the machine gun came later.[2] Iguchi was a special guest at the 2009 and 2010 New York Asian Film Festival.[25]\n\nIn 2010, Iguchi directed his largest-budgeted feature, the action film Karate-Robo Zaborgar, based on the popular 1970s television series Denjin Zaborger. He followed it with the scatological horror/comedy Zombie Ass in 2011.[26]\n\nSelected filmography\n\nVideo title[27] Release date Studio Cast Notes\n\nAdult Videos (AV) - Director\n\nBest of Immoral Angel 7\n\nベスト・オブ・インモラル天使７ 1999-01-15 CineMagic\n\nVS-545 Aika Miura & Miyu Natsuki The Neighbor's Sister Has F-Cup\n\nとなりのお姉さんはＦカップ 1999-06-26 Big Morkal\n\nSBM-38 Rie Asaoka Busty Costume Play Investigator\n\n美乳コスプレ捜査官 2000-01-21 V&R Planning Vogue\n\nVO-201 Seira Kirishima Forbidden Private Garden - Kurumi Lesbian Hell\n\n禁断の花園～くるみレズ地獄～ 2000-03-05 SOD\n\nSDDL-085 Mariko Kawana, Kurumi Morishita & Mei Sawaga Pretty Wife 13\n\nプリティワイフ13 2000-10-20 Try-Heart/Sexia\n\nSEA-189 Konomi Katori I Wanna Suck\n\nタマにはしゃぶりたい 2000-11-23 Try-Heart Sexia\n\nSEA-193 Marin Kobayakawa Wives Are Often Liable To Be Done ENEMA[28]\n\n人妻・エネマのよろめき 2001-07-06 CineMagic Memorial\n\nCS-284 Mariko Kawana Pink Pudding\n\nプリンは桃色 2001-07-21 Cosmos Plan\n\nIG-21 Shizuka Ichii Real Beautiful Young Lady Stools - Lolita Lavatory[29]\n\n真・美少女ｳﾝﾁﾛﾘｰﾀ便器 2001-12-20 SOD\n\nSDDO-003 Anna Kuramoto, Nancy, Ai Mizue, Mariko Kawana, Konomi Ohtomo and Kaoru Shimazu Scatology Enema Shame Zone 13[30]\n\n浣腸コレクション エネマ痴帯１３ 2002-11-08 CineMagic Memorial\n\nCS-323 Mariko Kawana, Rie Nitta & Momo Kawai Beautiful Girl Excretion School[31]\n\n美少女排泄学園 2003-07-19 SOD ON\n\nSDDO-025 Scatology Miracle Duo\n\nミラクル☆デュオ 2003-10-18 SOD\n\nSDDM-338 Chisaki Aihara & Miki Amatsuka Japanese Beauty Girl + Bukkake Vol.2\n\n日本的美少女+ぶっかけ 第二章 2003-11-20 SOD\n\nSDDM-362 Mio Sakura Beautiful Girl on The Toilet 2 - Secret Excrement\n\n美少女便器II ～秘密のウンチ～ 2003-12-04 SOD ON\n\nSDDO-032 Meron, Miki Amatsuka & Reina Kawahara Scatology Beautiful Girl Excretion Club[32]\n\n美少女排泄倶楽部 2004-03-04 SOD ON\n\nSDDO-040 Scatology Forbidden Relation\n\n禁断の関係 2004-07-08 SOD ON\n\nSDDO-048 Nana Natsume & Rei Himegawa Final Pussy!\n\n最終性器！ 2005-01-06 SOD\n\nSDDM-541 Nana Natsume Younger Sister Really Lewd Speech Persecution\n\n妹ドスケベ言葉責め 2006-09-25 h.m.p.\n\nHRDV-00461 Risa Coda Ultra Kozenwaisetsu\n\n《超》口全ワイセツ 2006-10-21 h.m.p.\n\nHRDV-00468 Risa Coda Celebrity Signorina, Take Your Shorts Off!\n\nセレブお嬢様「パンツをお脱ぎ！」 2007-02-25 h.m.p.\n\nHRDV-00507 Risa Coda Everyone Makes Me In Ecstasy!![7]\n\nみ～んなに犯られ連続絶頂！！ 2007-07-21 h.m.p.\n\nHRDV-00560 Ai Takeuchi First Cum-Inside!
