        "text": "Walker Pictures and Nishimura Eizo’s Dead Sushi, the latest horror/comedy from acclaimed Japanese director Noboru Iguchi, will World Premiere at Montreal’s prestigious Fantasia International Film Festival on July 22nd, followed shortly thereafter by its Asian Premiere at the Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival (PiFan). Iguchi, best-known for his high-octane 2008 action/comedy The Machine Girl, has become an international sensation with jaw-dropping, boundary-pushing films such as RoboGeisha, Karate-Robo Zaborgar, and Zombie Ass: Toilet of the Dead.\n\nWe’ve scored and exclusive new clip from the film called “Flying Squid”, and it’s got a pretty high body count for only being a minute or so long. If you have yet to see a decapitation today, we’ve got you covered.\n\nDead Sushi, which stars 21-year-old martial arts prodigy Rina Takeda, “tells the tale of Keiko, the daughter of a legendary sushi chef, who runs away from home when his kung fu-like regimen becomes too severe. Finding work at a rural hot springs inn, she is ridiculed by the eccentric staff and guests, including the employees of a pharmaceutical firm there on a work vacation. But little do they know that a disgruntled former researcher has also come to the inn with a plan for revenge, using a serum he developed that can awaken the murderous instincts of ordinary sushi, turning it into bloodthirsty monsters! Keiko must use both her sushi training and her martial arts skills to save the others and defeat the flying killers.”\n\nFor more on the film you can check out the official website or its Facebook. Head inside for the clip!\n\nActor Bill Skarsgård (IT) will unleash “outlandish, brutal, and bloody” violence this week with the release of Lionsgate’s The Crow in theaters, a new take on the iconic tale. Ahead of the film’s release, we’ve got an exclusive image highlighting the bloodshed in store.\n\nThe Crow releases in theaters on August 23.\n\nIn the new movie, “Soulmates Eric (Skarsgård) and Shelly (FKA twigs) are brutally murdered when the demons of her dark past catch up with them. Given the chance to save his true love by sacrificing himself, Eric sets out to seek merciless revenge on their killers, traversing the worlds of the living and the dead to put the wrong things right.”\n\nThe new image above hails from the “Opera House” clip released last week and included below, featuring Skarsgård in full vengeance mode.\n\nDirector Rupert Sanders said of the sequence, “We relish in the majesty of the opera being performed while experiencing the violence and actions of Eric, who kills an endless stream of Vincent’s people to get Shelly back. It’s an opera within a movie, but it’s really about high culture smashing into low culture. There’s a ballet to the violence. The action is outlandish, brutal, and bloody, and it’s a little bit pushed. With the action cut with the opera and set to the opera’s score, the violence becomes its own ballet.”\n\nStunt coordinator Adam Horton (Mission Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, The Dark Knight Rises) shared his approach to choreographing the standout action sequence at the Opera house, calling it a “blood opera” and what inspired him was “dark, painful torture, and to feel the emotional torment when designing the action within Eric’s journey.”\n\nZach Baylin (King Richard) and Will Schneider wrote the script, with the new movie of course based on James O’Barr’s original graphic novel that spawned a previous film franchise.\n\nDanny Huston (30 Days of Night) also stars alongside Laura Birn (Foundation), Sami Bouajila (A Son), and Jordan Bolger (The Woman King).\n\nThe new movie is rated “R” for…\n\n“Strong bloody violence, gore, language, sexuality/nudity, and drug use.”"
