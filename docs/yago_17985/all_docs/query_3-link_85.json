        "text": "Post Thumb:\n\n/may11/fantasiathumb.jpg\n\nAn exclusive image has come our way from the hot wasabi action flick Dead Sushi from acclaimed Japanese director Noboru Iguchi, which will have its world premiere at Montreal’s prestigious Fantasia International Film Festival on July 22nd.\n\nSynopsis:\n\nThe film, which stars 21-year-old martial arts prodigy Rina Takeda, tells the tale of Keiko, the daughter of a legendary sushi chef, who runs away from home when his kung fu-like regimen becomes too severe. Finding work at a rural hot springs inn, she is ridiculed by the eccentric staff and guests, including the employees of a pharmaceutical firm there on a work vacation. But little do they know that a disgruntled former researcher has also come to the inn with a plan for revenge, using a serum he developed that can awaken the murderous instincts of ordinary sushi, turning it into bloodthirsty monsters! Keiko must use both her sushi training and her martial arts skills to save the others and defeat the flying killers.\n\nFollowing the eclectic style of the director’s previous work, Dead Sushi is a tasty mix of action, comedy, and splatter as only Iguchi can do. With special effects by Yoshihiro Nishimura (Tokyo Gore Police) and appearances from The Machine Girl and Sukeban Boy’s Kentaro Shimazu, Asami, and Demo Tanaka, this lethal sushi is well worth a nibble!\n\nThe new image features Demo Tanaka and Hiroaki Murakami as hungry sushi-rice zombies. For more visit the official Dead Sushi website, “like” Dead Sushi on Facebook, and follow Dead Sushi on Twitter.\n\nFor more on the film fest itself, visit the official Fantasia International Film Festival website.\n\nVISIT THE EVILSHOP @ AMAZON!\n\nGot news?
