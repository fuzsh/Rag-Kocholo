The photographs in this album were taken in June 2019, when I spent four nights in Entebbe. From there, I visited the Ugandan capital, Kampala, on a day trip by minibus. Entebbe is situated on a small peninsula jutting into Lake Victoria, the world's second largest freshwater lake in terms of surface area (the largest being Lake Superior). It has a population of around 63,000. Before Uganda gained its independence in 1962, Entebbe was the seat of government of the Protectorate of Uganda. The country's largest airport is located in Entebbe. It gained notoriety when a hundred or so Israeli air passengers and Air France crew members were taken hostage there by a Palestinian group in 1976; they were subsequently rescued by Israeli Defence Force commandos. The city's name means 'seat' in the local Luganda language. I very much enjoyed its laid-back atmosphere and beautiful lakeside setting. The name of the Ugandan capital, Kampala, means 'the place where impala (a type of antelope) meet'. It has an estimated population of around 1.7 million. The main sights of the city can easily be seen within the space of a couple of days. I'm glad that I went there but am not sure that I'd return, although the leafy suburbs and hills are undoubtedly attractive.
