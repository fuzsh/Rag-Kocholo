        "text": "Entebbe is a small quiet town located on a peninsula of the shores of Lake Victoria in central Uganda, 21 miles (34 km) south of Kampala city, the capital of Uganda. It is characterized by a charming town center and is a haven of tranquility. Its elevation (3,760 feet -1,146 meters above sea level) gives it a perpetually moderate summer climate.\n\nThe word Entebbe means ‘seat or chair’ in the Luganda language. It was named this because that was where the Baganda chief sat to arbitrate legal cases in the early 1900s. It is the location of State House, the official office and residence of the President of Uganda, which dictates that Entebbe is the chief seat of power in the country.\n\nEntebbe is the main point of entry into Uganda for international arrivals, renowned for the country’s largest commercial and military airport – Entebbe International Airport. The four-lane Entebbe-Kampala Expressway or Highway is the fastest road link between the two cities.\n\nEntebbe is one of the most pleasant towns in Uganda famous for its parks, beaches, islands and the Uganda Wildlife Education Centre (formerly the National Zoo). It is the location of the oldest golf course in East Africa – Entebbe Golf Club which was established in 1900.\n\nBeing the gateway for international flights into Uganda, Entebbe offers a good choice of large hotels and guesthouses – catering to both business and leisure visitors."
