        "text": "As part of the Serena portfolio chain, this lodge is very large in size and has an abundance of facilities. As it has its own golf course, it is an obvious choice for those who like golf and would like to have a round or two before or after their Uganda itinerary. Aside from golf, it has comfortable rooms, a large pool, a spa, curio shop and more.\n\nThis lodge is one of most luxurious in all of Bwindi (we would say on par with Bwindi Lodge). The property feels more ‘safari-like’ as the main area is all open-plan, with a fire pit and a bar area tempting you in before dinner. The rooms are spacious and cosy, made from canvas and build in en-suite bathrooms and an outdoor bath. Overall a very nice property!\n\nKyanginga Lodge is sat on the edge of an extinct volcanic crater lake looking out to the Rwenzori Mountains in south-western Uganda. The lodge sits high up with beautiful views offered from the main area and your private veranda on your bedroom, but with the high altitude, expect a lot of stairs!\n\nBack in the 1920’s, the lodge and its estate was part of a large-scale tea plantation. Today, Ndali Lodge sits on a huge area of stunning landscapes, views, banana plantations, coffee terraces and of course, tea plantations.\n\nDuring the early years of the British protectorate, the city of Entebbe was the capital of Uganda. Kampala has now taken its place as capital but that isn’t to say that Entebbe is not worth a visit, especially as it works well logistically, passing from one destination to another.\n\nFounded in 1952, the Queen Elizabeth National Park is located in western Uganda and is formed of a variety of ecosystems homes just under 100 mammal species and over 600 bird species. As a result, for obvious reasons, is often included in a Uganda itinerary. Vast savannahs, lush forests, glistening lakes and fertile wetlands make it the perfect home for elephant, buffalo, lion, chimpanzees and hippo in particular.\n\nUganda has several forests and national parks in which chimpanzees can be found and the park you visit will depend on the experience you are wanting – whether that is a chimpanzee tracking experience, or a chimpanzee habituation experience. Habituated chimpanzees mean that they are accustomed to human presence and will not run off when they sense or see humans.\n\nIn the southwestern corner of Uganda sits the most biologically diverse forests in Africa - Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. The forest is part of the Rift Valley Mountains that stretch over three countries – Uganda, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo – and the most famous reason to visit this group of forests is to see the mountain gorillas."
