        "text": "At the invitation of Cardno, IFC’s Richard Bellingham and Robert Rogerson presented today at a workshop exploring ‘a smart city approach to the Jinja-Kampala-Entebbe corridor’ held in Kampala, Uganda.\n\nThe focus of the session was on spatial data and the prosperous city, and was part of a larger programme of development being funded by the UK Department for International Development. The meeting was opened by the Minister for Lands, Housing and Urban Development from the Ugandan national government, with the audience formed of professionals from the National Planning Authority, UN-Habitat and the city council of Kampala as well as academic colleagues from the University of Makerere.\n\nIFC has been invited to work alongside Cardno, the parter developing the £20m programme for DfID, to help attract new funding to support the development of an integrated data platform that will assist policy making in future."
