Uganda Wildlife Conservation Education Centre\n\nAlso known as the Entebbe Zoo, the Wildlife Conservation Education Centre is an awesome way to spend a day in Entebbe, Uganda.\n\nStroll through the education center to check out some of the animals you couldn’t spot on your other wilderness adventures in Uganda. The staff is incredibly knowledgeable about the animals and love to share about their work and the conservation efforts they are doing.\n\nIf you want to get up close and personal with the animals, we highly recommend a Behind the Scenes tour. We were able to get inside to feed or pet a baby elephant, a giraffe, rhino, and cheetah.\n\n2. Ngamba Island Chimpanzee Sanctuary\n\nIf you can’t make it to western Uganda to do chimpanzee trekking, Ngamba Island is the next best thing. Affectionately known as Chimp Island, Ngamba is a short boat ride off the shores of Entebbe.\n\nIt is home to orphaned and confiscated chimps, rescued from the illegal pet and bushmeat trade. The 100 acre sanctuary provides a safe and semi-natural home for their rehabilitation.\n\nNgamba Island has many options for touring, including half day, full day, overnight, and long stay experiences. You will be able to learn all about their conservation efforts and get to interact with some of the chimpanzees living here.\n\n3. Equator Sign\n\nMost people are familiar with the equator sign seen on the way to the southwestern part of Uganda. Did you know there’s also an equator sign in Entebbe?\n\nGrab a motorized boat and head out to Lwaji Island on Lake Victoria to see the “other” equator sign.\n\n4. Botanical Gardens\n\nThe Botanical Gardens in Entebbe, Uganda is a lovely spot to take a relaxing stroll. Under the lush canopy of trees, you can see a number of plants and make your way to the shores of Lake Victoria.\n\nKeep an eye out for monkeys and the many birds that live here.\n\nWe recommend grabbing a guide at the gate who can help you to navigate the expansive gardens. The guide will also be able to share a lot of knowledge and point out the different species of trees, plants, and birds on your walk. It will make the experience much more pleasurable.\n\n5. Reptile Village\n\nIf you’re looking to see some of the most incredible animals in Entebbe, Uganda, look no further than Reptile Village.

You can also arrange a guided tour of the Kiganda shrines.\n\nIf you’d like to spend more than an afternoon at Mpanga Central Forest Reserve, there is basic accommodation that can be arranged or you can bring camping gear for a self-catered stay.\n\n7. Ssese Islands\n\nA hidden paradise with white sand beaches, the Ssese Islands are one of the most incredible things to do in Entebbe, Uganda!\n\nSwimming in Lake Victoria is not recommended while staying at the Ssese Islands because of Bilharzia. Some of the outlying islands also have hippos and crocodiles in the water. You can still get in the water and enjoy boating activities and fishing.\n\nThe largest island of the 84 island archipelago is Bugala. Bugala and Kalangala are the most popular areas for accommodation. If you want to swim, check out some of the hotels with pools.\n\nHow To Get To Ssese Islands From Entebbe:\n\nHead to Nakiwogo Landing site near Entebbe town. You will take a 3 hour ferry ride to Kalangala. The ferry departs from Nakiwogo every day at 2:00 pm.\n\nWe recommend getting to the landing site at least one hour early to get your tickets. You can also reach out to the ferry booking site to reserve your ticket.\n\n8. Uganda Buddhist Centre\n\nEntebbe, Uganda is home to the first and only Buddhist Centre in the country, and the first Buddhist temple in Africa introduced by an African.\n\nThe Buddhist Centre hosts a number of programs free to the public including mindfulness meditation for adults and children, as well community programs aimed to address water access and women and youth empowerment.\n\n9. Anderita Beach\n\nIf you’re looking for a relaxing place to grab some delicious food and a cold drink, Anderita Beach is definitely where you’ll want to check out.\n\nOur favorite places to dine at Anderita Beach are Goretti’s Beachside Pizzaria, 2 Friends Beach Restaurant, and across the street from the beach is Thai Garden.\n\nThe warm breeze and waves crashing onto the beach will have you feeling like you’re on a secluded ocean island rather than a lakeside peninsula. You won’t want to skip Anderita Beach on your visit to Entebbe, Uganda.\n\n10. Aero Beach\n\nOne of the most interesting things to do in Entebbe, Uganda is a visit to Aero Beach.\n\nAt Aero Beach, you will find an array of old planes that inspired the beach’s name. There are also a number of statues of famous figures like Nelson Mandela, Queen Elizabeth II, the Obamas, and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni.\n\nThis spot is much more lively and crowded than Anderita Beach, but it makes an interesting spot to take some photos.\n\n11.
