        "text": "Uganda is only the 81st largest country by area in the world, but it has the 36th largest population. With a population exceeding 37 million, it may come as a surprise that this country has just one city with a population that exceeds one million. However, there are many cities and towns that contribute to these rising numbers. As mentioned, Uganda has just one city that has a population of over a million. Kampala has a population of 1.35 million as of 2016. The next two largest cities have populations that are right above 100,000. Sixty cities within the country have populations that exceed 10,000.\n\nWhile these major cities' populations may not seem to add up to the high overall population, it is simply because many residents of Uganda reside in the country's rural areas. In fact, 84% of residents live in rural areas instead of the developing urban areas, according to 2015 data from The World Bank. This is not a significant decrease from the 96% rural population in 1960. This shows that while the population continues to grow, cities are not developing and expanding at such a fast rate. This could lead to future problems as additional residents immigrating to the country or that are a result of natural growth could put a strain on the resources and infrastructure of this developing country."
