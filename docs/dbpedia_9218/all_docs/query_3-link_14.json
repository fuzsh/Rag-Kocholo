        "text": "By Brenda Kamulegeya\n\nTHERE are hopes of Uganda getting a second city. On May 7, 2006, Parliament passed a resolution urging the Government to support Entebbeâ€™s aspiration of to achieve a fully-fledged city status in a period not exceeding 10 years.\n\nA motion to pay tribute and in appreciation for the contribution of Stephen Kabuye, the mayor of Entebbe, was also moved by the former Rwampara Member of Parliament, Amon Muzoora, and seconded by the Wakiso district woman MP Rosemary Sseninde.\n\nâ€œHaving Kabuye elected vice-president of the International Council of Local Environment Initiative and president of the Africa section, government should put in a policy to support such gallant Ugandans who bring fame to this country,â€ Muzoora said.\n\nThis may see a repeat of Ugandaâ€™s history of 1894 when Entebbe became the capital city of Uganda, following a decision in 1893 by the then colonial Governor Sir Gerald Portal. However, in 1962 at Independence, the capital was moved to Kampala, leaving Entebbe with the State House, the International Airport and a few ministry headquarters and government departments.\n\nAccording to the Local Government Act Cap 243 as at February 15, 2006, except for those areas which are already gazetted, before declaring an area to be a town, municipality or city, the following requirements should generally exist: the population must be in case of a town above 25,000 inhabitants, a municipality above 100,000 inhabitants and a city above 500,000; the area must have the capacity to meet its costs of service delivery, have its offices, have a master plan for land use and have water sources.\n\nMr. John Behangaana, the secretary general of the Urban Authorities Association of Uganda (UAAU), says for over 30 years, Uganda has had one capital city â€“â€“ Kampala, and no other town yet qualifies to become a city. The closest to these are the municipal councils. The towns which would have qualified for city status have not been upgraded. â€œOur urbanisation has stagnated, one capital city for such a long time does not indicate urban growth,â€ Behangaana says.\n\nThe UAAU is the umbrella association for urban authorities in Uganda. It works with the Government, non governmental organisations, the private sector and other development partners.\n\nDespite the resolution for consideration of Entebbe for city status, Behangaana says there are other towns to consider.\n\nâ€œGoing by the criteria of population, Entebbeâ€™s population is not growing as fast as other municipal councils like Mbarara, Jinja and Masaka,â€ he notes.\n\nThe 2002 census carried out by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics, shows that the population of Kampala city is 1,189,142, that of Entebbe is 55,086, Masaka has 67,768, Mbarara 69,363, and Jinja 71,213.\n\nCities should be strategically placed to ensure people access services, Behangaana says.\n\nâ€œLocating another city in Entebbe only concentrates the services available,â€ he observes. The options of Masaka, Mbarara or Mbale, which are far off areas, will ensure equitable distribution of services and servicing of a greater population.\n\nA city has a unique function and provides more departments than a municipality, Behangaana explains.\n\nBenefits of a city include a bigger elaborate engineering department, elaborate medical function, a well developed cemetery and cold room mechanism, elaborate veterinary system and more extensive sports function with more manpower tools and logistics. He affirms that when a town is upgraded, more of these services are developed to adequately service the needs of the people.\n\nDan Lutaaya, the assistant town clerk of Entebbe municipality has been instrumental in preparing â€˜The road map to city status of Entebbe.â€™ This is a draft document showing a situation analysis of the municipality.\n\nThe immediate task for the local council was to own the resolution (by Parliament passed on May 7). After achieving this, it was presented to council for further adoption,â€ Lutaaya explains.\n\nIn this draft, in a bid to deal with the population challenge of which a population of 500,000 people is required for city status, it is proposed that the sub counties of Katabi, Kasanje and Sissa, currently under Wakiso district are included.\n\nA review of the existing physical plan is required.\n\nâ€œExtension of new boundaries implies acquiring a fresh area that requires physical planning.\n\nSimilarly, the planned area of Entebbe has a master plan that was made 50 years. City status thus requires a harmonised physical plan that will review the existing planned area and area under the extended boundaries,â€ the draft reads.\n\nOther milestones to be overcome include the upgrading of the social and physical infrastructure. This can be achieved through rapid assessment and appraisal of the current social and physical infrastructure in the city.\n\nInstitutional capacity building in terms of organisational and human resources.\n\nFinancial planning and effective management is another milestone to be overcome. Lutaaya calls for support from government if Entebbe is to transform to city status. This support is key in enabling the municipality carry out infrastructural projects and access support from the World Bank, European Union and other donors.\n\nHe is optimistic that if these challenges are overcome, Entebbe will be a fully fledged city in 10 years to come.\n\nIan Kyeyune, from Wakiso district on the other hand emphasises that we should be focusing on development rather than cities.\n\nGiven the level of poverty in the country, our emphasis should be on a metropolitan kind of development.\n\nâ€œWe should first look at developing the mega polis surrounding area then the city will eventually result,â€ Kyeyune explains. He, however, clarifies that his goal is to see places developing and if this includes Entebbe, then it is welcome."
