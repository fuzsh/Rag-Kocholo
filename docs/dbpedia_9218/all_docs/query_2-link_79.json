He stressed the necessity of developing human resources locally, stating, “We must focus on building our own capacity to train thousands of scientists and technicians. Sending them abroad is not sustainable.”\n\nMinister Opolot called on Makerere University to lead these efforts by establishing energy laboratories and training programs. “Makerere University should be at the forefront of localizing technology, establishing laboratories, and training personnel in energy systems,” he said. He also highlighted the importance of research and collaboration with other universities to transform Uganda’s energy sector.\n\nProf. Barnabas Nawangwe Pledges Makerere University‘s Support to Government Initiatives\n\nIn his opening and welcome remarks, Makerere University’s Vice Chancellor Prof. Barnabas Nawangwe expressed gratitude to the Minister for making time to attend the event, indicating the Minister’s appreciation of the university’s collaborative efforts with the government. Prof. Nawangwe emphasized that Makerere University, being a large institution with substantial resources, is underutilized by the government. He pointed out that the government spends significant funds on foreign consultancy for tasks that could be efficiently handled by the university’s lecturers and students.\n\nProf. Nawangwe highlighted Makerere University‘s commitment to supporting government programs, stating, “We are here for you. We are a government institution, and the people of Uganda have invested heavily in Makerere University, so we must reap from that investment.” He assured the Minister that the university is available to support government initiatives and emphasized that the funds provided for research and innovations should be used to address the government’s development challenges.\n\nHe specifically mentioned the university’s capability to conduct mineral testing, which could prevent the need to send samples abroad, thereby saving costs. Prof. Nawangwe expressed excitement about the invitation to collaborate and pledged Makerere University‘s full support for government programs. He also congratulated the Ministry of Energy on its successes, particularly the commissioning of the West Nile plant, which he described as a game-changer for the country’s energy sector.\n\nProf. Nawangwe acknowledged the importance of the Inclusive Green Economy (IGE) Capacity Building Program, highlighting that the issues addressed by the fellows are crucial for Uganda’s future. He recounted his childhood experience of passing through a green forest while studying in his village home , contrasting it with the current state of deforestation and urban slums. He stressed the urgency of addressing environmental issues as the population continues to grow, predicting severe consequences if action is not taken.\n\nHe commended the government for its active involvement in the IGE program and its collaboration with Makerere University through various initiatives, such as the Climate Resilient Infrastructure Development Facility (CRIC). Prof. Nawangwe congratulated the graduating fellows for their year-long engagement and encouraged incoming participants to take the training seriously, emphasizing that it would empower them and enhance their professional capabilities.\n\nSwedish Ambassador Emphasizes the Importance of Universal Access to Sustainable Energy\n\nClosing the event, Swedish Ambassador to Uganda, Maria Håkansson, highlighted the critical role of universal access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). She stressed that energy is essential for economic growth and the provision of social and public services.\n\nAmbassador Håkansson noted Sweden’s ambitious goal to become the world’s first fossil-free welfare state by 2045, aiming for net zero emissions. “We strongly believe this is important for us to keep the planet and life safe,” she said. This transformation requires a profound shift in systems and technology to ensure cleaner air, better urban environments, and safer energy supplies. Sweden has successfully decoupled carbon dioxide emissions from GDP growth since 1997, thanks to a significant reliance on renewable energy, without compromising public welfare or prosperity.\n\nSweden’s partnership with Uganda in promoting energy access and efficiency is strong. In 2019, the ambassador said, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed with the Ugandan government for energy sector cooperation, which has been extended. Various capacity-building programs have trained energy sector staff in renewable energy and energy efficiency. A partnership with SNV, Makerere University, and the Private Sector Foundation Uganda, supported by Sweden with USD 8.8 million, aims to engage the private sector in designing impactful energy efficiency solutions.\n\nSweden also reported that supports the Power Africa initiative to double electricity access in sub-Saharan Africa and collaborates with UEGCL and Swedfund on a feasibility study for floating solar panels on water reservoirs. This project aims to enhance the electricity generation capacity of Ugandan hydro power dams.\n\nAdditionally, Sweden’s support for the UNCDF Renewable Energy Challenge Fund has resulted in the avoidance of approximately 1,514,787 tons of carbon dioxide emissions through clean cooking initiatives. “The use of effective and clean cooking solutions has clear positive impacts on the daily lives of not least women and children by reducing indoor air pollution and easing the workload of collecting firewood,” Håkansson explained. “At the same time, it reduces deforestation and soil degradation.”\n\nThe Inclusive Green Economy (IGE) in Practice program, funded by the Swedish Development Cooperation and conducted in collaboration with Makerere University, focuses on sustainable energy transitions, particularly promoting clean cooking solutions. These solutions according to the ambassador have significant positive impacts, such as reducing indoor air pollution, easing the workload of collecting firewood, and mitigating deforestation and soil degradation.\n\nAmbassador Håkansson concluded by commending the IGE Fellows for their efforts to raise awareness and increase the uptake of cleaner energy sources, congratulating them on their graduation from the program. “Let me conclude by commending the IGE Fellows for their work to raise awareness and increase the uptake of cleaner energy sources as well as congratulate them as they today graduate from the program,” she said.\n\nJane Anyango is the Communication Officer EfD Uganda"
