        "text": "A Chinese worker (R) works closely with an Ugandan worker at the construction site of the Entebbe-Kampala Expressway Project at an area along the Entebbe Express highway in Uganda, Nov. 17, 2017. The Entebbe-Kampala Expressway, which is under construction by China Communications Construction Company Ltd (CCCC), is a 350 million U.S. dollars project linking Uganda's capital Kampala to Entebbe International Airport. (Xinhua/Zhang Gaiping)\n\nWAKISO, Uganda, Nov. 22 (Xinhua) -- When war broke out in neighboring South Sudan in 2013, Gabriel Omiat became jobless and had to return to Uganda, with nothing much left.\n\nThe 27-year-old told Xinhua in a recent interview that after several months of trying to get serious employment, he finally landed a job at a Chinese company contracted to build Uganda's first ever expressway.\n\nThe 350 million U.S. dollar project linking Uganda's capital Kampala to Entebbe International Airport has been a blessing to Omiat and thousands of other semi skilled youths in the east African country.\n\nStep by step, after following instructions from his Chinese supervisors, Omiat has grown to be one of the best welders at the expressway project of China Communications Construction Company (CCCC).\n\n\"The Chinese are not selfish people in terms of transferring knowledge and skills. When they give you an assignment, they first show you how to do it,\" said Omiat.\n\nAn Aerial view of the longest bridge in East Africa along Entebbe express highway in Uganda, November 15, 2017.(Xinhua/Joseph Kiggundu)\n\nThousands of locals who work on the expressway project had similar experiences.\n\nMicheal Adipa, 24, dropped out of school when his parents could no longer afford the tuition fees. He did not possess any skills for a decent job apart from being a casual laborer. Through a friend, Adipa managed to travel to the capital Kampala, over 300 km from his hometown.\n\nSince Adipa got a job at CCCC about five years ago, life has not been the same again. Thanks to the training received and his own diligence, he has quickly risen through the ranks to become a laboratory assistant.\n\nAdipa's Chinese supervisors are proud of him, saying he is exceptionally good at learning.\n\nCCCC Senior welder Omiat Gabriel (L) shows his junior how to make fabrication while at their workshop in Kajjansi along Kampala-Entebbe road, about 16 kilometers south of Kampala, capital of Uganda, November 15, 2017. Omiat said Chinese have helped to teach him all the fabrication work at CCCC using high-tech machines.(Xinhua/Joseph Kiggundu)\n\n\"I have learnt mostly about material work on road construction. I have learnt how to control materials in road construction according to the design and specification of the project,\" Adipa said.\n\nChinese companies, especially those in the infrastructure sector, are employing thousands of Ugandan youths and helping the country to tackle unemployment.\n\nAt the peak of the ongoing construction of the expressway, CCCC employed more than 2,000 locals. Other major Chinese infrastructure development projects such as the construction of Karuma Hydro Power project and Isimba Hydropower project also have huge number of locals on its payroll.\n\nFigures from the World Bank show Uganda has one of the youngest and most rapidly growing populations in the world. About 53 percent of Uganda's population is younger than 15 years, well above Sub-Saharan Africa's average of 43.2 percent.\n\nAbout 500,000 people are expected to enter the labor market every year. Currently, 64 percent of the unemployed are aged 24 and under.\n\nChinese Engineer (R) works closely with Ugandan Engineer during the construction of some of the areas along Entebbe Express highway in Uganda, Nov. 17, 2017. (Xinhua/Zhang Gaiping)\n\nFor the lucky ones who are employed like Omiat and Adipa, they have something to smile about.\n\n\"Some of the money I earn from here I use it to pay school fees for my sisters and brothers in the village,\" Adipa said.\n\nAnother plus for Adipa, according to him, is that even when the Chinese project comes to completion, he will still have his skills that he can use elsewhere to earn a living.\n\nWith the skills acquired when working with the Chinese, Omiat plans to set up his own welding workshop."
