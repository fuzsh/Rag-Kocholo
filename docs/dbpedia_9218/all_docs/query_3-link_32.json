        "text": "Ugandaâ€™s only international airport is Entebbe, which is situated on the northern shores of Lake Victoria. Several International flights land at Entebbe, which lies near the capital city of Kampala. Domestic light aircraft flights depart from Entebbe or the nearby Kajjansi Airport, providing access to airstrips situated adjacent to all major parks. It is also possible to travel by road but, due to poor road conditions, this may take considerably longer.\n\nMain roads are generally good but travel is much slower than on European or American roads. Secondary roads are of variable quality and often slow and bumpy especially around the gorilla parks.\n\nFlights\n\nSCHEDULED FLIGHTS\n\nInternational flights land at Entebbe, near the capital city of Kampala.\n\nSHUTTLE/CHARTER FLIGHTS\n\nNetworks of domestic light aircraft flights provide access to airstrips adjacent to all major parks.\n\nTransfers\n\nBY ROAD\n\nRoad transfers are available but due to poor road conditions, this may take considerably longer.\n\nSELF-DRIVE\n\nDue to the nature and condition of the roads we do not recommend this as a self-drive destination.\n\nWhat to remember when traveling around Uganda\n\nAll international flights land at Entebbe, and guests often choose to overnight here on arrival. Scheduled internal flights in light aircraft connect to safari destinations. From most airstrips a short road transfer will be needed to get to the lodge.\n\nMain roads are generally good but travel is much slower than on European or American roads. Secondary roads are of variable quality and often slow and bumpy especially around the gorilla parks."
