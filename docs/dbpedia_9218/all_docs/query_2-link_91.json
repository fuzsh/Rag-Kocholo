This is a common question asked by many travelers. By figuring out which city has activities that align with your interests along with knowing which is more affordable, you'll understand where you can get more bang for your buck. So, let's dive into the details and the data, which all comes from actual travelers.\n\nWhere Should I go: Kampala or Entebbe?\n\nKampala\n\nKampala is the capital of Uganda in the South part of the country near Lake Victoria. It is the largest city in Uganda, with a population of over two million people. This city is very safe and the locals are known to be very kind and approachable.\n\nEntebbe\n\nEntebbe is a large city located in Central Uganda. It is about thirty kilometers from the capital city of Uganda, which is Kampala. Lake Victoria, a prominent body of water, is very close to Entebbe as well. Today, the population of Entebbe is over 69,000 people. In Europe, Entebbe is known for its airport, which was once the site of a major hostage situation led by the German and Palestinian militia, back in 1976. Soldiers from the Israeli army freed the hostages in a massive rescue mission. Alternatively, when Queen Elizabeth II heard of her father's death and that she had become the queen, she was at this airport and had to fly from there back to England at once.\n\nFor some great organized tour ideas, see The Best Overlanding Trips in Uganda, The Best Adventure Tours to Uganda, The Best Camping Tours in Uganda, and The Best Safaris in Uganda.\n\nWhich place is cheaper, Entebbe or Kampala?\n\nThese are the overall average travel costs for the two destinations.\n\nAverage Daily Cost Per person, per day\n\nKampala $71\n\nEntebbe $95\n\nThe average daily cost (per person) in Kampala is $71, while the average daily cost in Entebbe is $95.

And not only is Kampala much less expensive, but it is actually a significantly cheaper destination. So, traveling to Kampala would let you spend less money overall. Or, you could decide to spend more money in Kampala and be able to afford a more luxurious travel style by staying in nicer hotels, eating at more expensive restaurants, taking tours, and experiencing more activities. The same level of travel in Entebbe would naturally cost you much more money, so you would probably want to keep your budget a little tighter in Entebbe than you might in Kampala.\n\nIf you're trying to decide if either of these two destinations are within your price range, also see Is Kampala Expensive? and Is Entebbe Expensive?.\n\nWhich is Bigger, Kampala or Entebbe?\n\nKampala has a larger population, and is about 20 times larger than the population of Entebbe. When comparing the sizes of Kampala and Entebbe, keep in mind that a larger population does not always imply the destination has more attractions or better activities. So, always research the type of place that you want to visit along with the activities and attractions that interest you."
