The facility was opened in 1952 as a center for rescued animals before turning into a zoo later. The facility is still used as a rehabilitation center for rescued animals before being released back into the wild when possible. The Centre has an amazing collection of wildlife and beautiful scenery. It is a quick place to go if you cannot visit Uganda’s national parks. Here you will see DeBraza monkeys, baboons, hyenas, pythons, lions, ostriches, antelopes, leopards, buffaloes and chimpanzee among many other creatures.

Visiting the center costs $15 for international visitors and about 10,000 for Ugandans. Those interested in a more comprehensive visit can opt for the Keeper for a Day Experience, the behind the Scenes Tour and the Chimpanzee Close-up experience. Tour operators in Uganda can organize trips to the Entebbe zoo but at an extra cost.

The sanctuary takes care of all kinds of reptiles including crocodiles, turtles, tortoises, lizards, chameleons and snakes (vipers, cobras, mambas and puff adders). Most of these reptiles where rescued and rehabilitated after being found in people’s homes and gardens. After they receive a call from someone who spotted a reptile in their compound, staff are sent to pick it up. When the number of reptiles increase, some are released back into the wild.\n\nThe staff at the sanctuary are always eager to educate visitors about these often misunderstood creatures. The Reptiles village is located a short drive away from Entebbe town. You stop at a small town called Abaita-ababiri as you head towards Kampala. From Abaita, you leave the main highway and follow the 4km dusty road to the Reptile village. Entrance to the Reptile sanctuary is 15,000 Uganda Shillings at the time of writing this article.
