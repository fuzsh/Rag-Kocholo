        "text": "The main airport in Uganda, Entebbe International Airport, located roughly 40km from Uganda’s capital city Kampala, is undergoing expansion in a phased manner to accommodate the country’s rising passenger and cargo traffic.\n\nThe airport was officially inaugurated in 1951. The upgrade and expansion project was unveiled by the Civil Aviation Authority of Uganda (CAA) in January 2015, which forms a part of a 20-year National Aviation Master Plan (2014-2033).\n\nThe expansion project aims to increase the passenger terminal’s capacity from the current 410 arriving and 320 departing passengers to 930 arriving and 820 departing passengers during peak hours. The renovation will also enable the airport to increase the availability and frequency of international flights.\n\nEntebbe International Airport is anticipated to handle 6.1 million passengers and 172,000t of cargo a year by 2033.\n\nConstruction and financing for Entebbe airport expansion\n\nThe upgrade and expansion work for Entebbe International Airport are set to be carried out in three phases until 2033 by China Communication Construction Company.\n\nThe first phase’s groundbreaking ceremony was held in August 2015 while the construction of the new cargo building began in May 2016. Phase one is scheduled to be completed in 2023.\n\nCAA received approval from the Parliament of Uganda to secure $200m of loan from the Export-Import Bank of China for phase one of the project in July 2015.\n\nAdditionally, the Government of South Korea agreed to provide a $9.5m grant to improve air navigation services and the automation of facilities at Entebbe airport as part of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed with the Ugandan Government in November 2014.\n\nThe second phase of works will be carried out at an estimated cost of $120m, while the final phase will involve an investment of $160m.\n\nDetails of Entebbe International Airport expansion and upgrade\n\nPhase one of the project will see the construction of a new international passenger terminal building with a capacity of three million passengers, a new cargo centre that can handle 100,000t of cargo a year and a fuel centre.\n\nThe passenger terminal building will feature three levels and comprise a total floor area of 20,000m².\n\nThe building’s ground level will be allocated for an automated baggage sort system and goods delivery facility, while the second level will house new check-in and boarding areas. The top level of the terminal building will accommodate offices.\n\nNew arrivals and departure blocks will be built to handle the increased level of passenger traffic, while the cargo building will house various facilities required for the import and export cargo.\n\nCold-storage modules will be constructed for the storage of perishable export cargo such as fish from Lake Victoria, fruits, and flowers.\n\nThe existing 3.65km-long main runway (17/35), the 2.4km-long secondary runway (12/30) and the associated taxiways F, G and H will be expanded and strengthened to accommodate aircraft such as Boing 77-300 and Airbus 340-600.\n\nSix more parking stands will be added to the existing apron 1 to serve IATA code C aircraft.\n\nThe first phase will also cover the rehabilitation and overlay of aprons 1, 2 and 4, while a new apron will be built to handle dedicated cargo aircraft.\n\nFirewater and on-site water supply systems will also be included as part of the expansion project.\n\nIn addition, a multi-storey car parking will be built as part of the development’s second phase in order to increase the parking capacity from the current 100 to 360 cars.\n\nOther developments at Entebbe International Airport\n\nAn Automation of the Aeronautical Information Management System has been implemented at the airport to allow for automated flight planning management.\n\nA total of 42 new aviation police units have been built in Kigungu in order to relocate the current units at the cargo centre site.\n\nA new baggage handling system featuring X-ray monitors has been placed in the check-in area to improve the baggage handling capacity from the current 500-700 bags an hour to approximately 1,200 to 1,800 bags an hour.\n\nAn additional six check-in counters have also been installed to enhance security at the facility.\n\nContractors involved\n\nChina Construction Communications Company (CCCC) is the prime contractor for the project and is responsible for the design, construction and management of the Entebbe International Airport expansion.\n\nCOWI was selected to provide planning and design for the first phase of the airport’s rehabilitation.\n\nVanderlande Industries supplied and installed a baggage handling system at the airport in September 2016 under a $4.8m contract with CCCC.\n\nDar Al-Handasah Shair & Partners and Orion Associates were selected by CCCC to supervise the works in May 2017.\n\nKorea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) agreed to provide a computerised maintenance management system (CMMS), an airport operational database (AODB) system and an air traffic services message handling system (AMHS) on behalf of the South Korean government."
