        "text": "In 1873, Sir Fredrick Treves, coming from Mwanza and Kisumu ports, described Entebbe as the prettiest and most charming town of the lake. Sprawling along the Lake Victoria shores some 35Kms south of Kampala, it exudes an atmosphere of tropical languor, and particularly those with a strong interest in natural history, and it makes for an altogether more appealing introduction to Uganda than the capital.\n\n- BIRDING: The area in and around Kampala and Entebbe offers a variety of exciting birding opportunities.\n\nBotanical gardens: Established in 1902, Entebbe’s botanical garden is an attractively laid-out mix of indigenous forest, cultivation and horticulture, and a highly attractive destinations for birdwatchers. Tropical trees, plants, flowers, birds, monkeys, butterflies in abundance along Lake Victoria. Take a picnic lunch and spend the most beautiful day in Entebbe.\n\nEntebbe Sewage Pond: The sewage treatment pond is an excellent spot for waders and well worth visiting during migration period.\n\nKajansi Fish farm: Situated half way between Kampala and Entebbe the Kajansi fish farm attracks a variety of waterbirds. Large numbers of migrants are present on passage.\n\nLutembe bay: Listed among the eight IBA in the Lake Victoria Basin and it is a Ramsar site no. 1637 since 15th Sep 2006.\n\nIt is an important habitat for migratory birds and seven globally threatened bird species including Papyrus Yellow Warbler (Chloropeta gracilirostris), Papyrus Gonolek (Laniarius mufumbiri),\n\nShoebill (Balaeniceps rex), African Skimmer (Rhynchops flavirostris), Pallid Harrier (Circus macrouros), Great Snipe (Gallinago media) and Madagascar Squacco Heron (Ardeola idea).\n\nMabamba wetlands: Mabamba Bay Wetland is one of the vast swamps found in Lake Victoria. It is located close to Entebbe town (40km) and Kampala city in a small village in Kasanje. The main economic activities among the communities living close to the wetland are hunting, fishing and mining. The Mabamba Swamp is more renowned for its amazing bird collection (Over 260 species recorded). It is one of the top tourist attractions in Entebbe town. In 2006, the swamp was chosen as a Ramsar Site and wetland of international importance because of the rare and attractive bird species like the Papyrus Yellow Warbler, Shoebill Stork (Balaeniceps rex), Blue Swallow (Hirundo atrocaerulea) and Sitatunga (swamp antelope) among others.\n\nMpanga Forest: An Ecotourism Site located at about 37 kilometers southwest of Kampala. It hosts abundant forest species: home to over 500 tree species and shrubs, 300 birds, 97 butterflies and 112 moths.\n\n3 monkey species that are protected within this small forest: the vervet, the red tailed and the black and white colobus monkeys.\n\nThe banded mongoose and the squirrel are also spotted there and if manage to have a night walk you may view the nocturnal pottos, pangolins and bush babies.\n\n- NGAMBA ISLAND VISIT: Ngamba Island Chimpanzee Sanctuary is home to 49 orphaned and confiscated chimps, rescued from the illegal pet and bushmeat trade. Despite their initial trauma, chimps living at Ngamba have a safe and semi-natural environment in which to recover and eventually thrive over their long lives of up to 60 years.\n\nFounded in 1998, the island offers 95 acres of natural forest where the chimps roam and forage daily. Their diet is supplemented multiple times per day much to the delight of visiting tourists who are able to observe the feeding from a viewing platform. The chimps also have the freedom to stay in the forest at night or return to nighttime enclosures where they can build nests and receive an evening meal.\n\nA visit will require one to take a speedboat from Entebbe to the Island. On arrival, you will observe the chimpanzees during feeding time. In addition, you may also have a sight of monitor lizards, birds and have some great photo opportunities.\n\nUpon arrival at the sanctuary, you will be directed to the Visitor’s Centre where you will be introduced to the project, its history, our residents and their plight. You will receive a personal orientation by a chimpanzee caregiver and view a feeding of the chimpanzees from the visitors’ raised platform area along the edge of the sanctuary fence.\n\n- RAFTING THE RIVER NILE (Jinja): The full day rafting trip with 5kms of white-water from Bujagali Falls with all the big grade 5 rapids is the most popular one! Early pick-up from Kampala up by one of the best rafting companies and return in the early eveneing.\n\n- NDERE TROUPE (Traditional dance & Music): In efforts to save and conserve African heritage, Ndere Troupe performs a repertoire of more the 40 authentic Ugandan dances and songs accompanied by various indigenous instruments.\n\n- KAMPALA CITY TOUR: Kampala is the capital city and the economic hub of Uganda. Originally built across seven hills but has now widened and spread to over twenty two hills. It is a good place to explore with so much to see and experience."
