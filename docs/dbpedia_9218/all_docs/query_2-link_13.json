        "text": "International airport in Uganda\n\nEntebbe International Airport (IATA: EBB, ICAO: HUEN) is the only international airport in Uganda. It is located about 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) southwest of the town of Entebbe, on the northern shores of Lake Victoria.[5] This is approximately 40 kilometres (25 mi) by road south-west of the central business district of Kampala, the capital city of Uganda.[6]\n\nThe headquarters of the Civil Aviation Authority of Uganda have been relocated to a new block off the airport highway (Entebbe–Kampala Expressway and Tunnel Road), but adjacent to the airport terminals.[7]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe airport was opened by the British Colonial authorities. According to the website of the Uganda Civil Aviation Authority, due to the airport's location on Lake Victoria and the existing facilities, the colonial government decided that the most optimal location for aviation traffic was Entebbe.[8]\n\nOn 10 November 1951, the airport was formally reopened after its facilities had been extended. Runway 12/30 was now 9,900 feet (3,000 m), in preparation for services by the de Havilland Comet.[9] The new main terminal building of the airport was designed by Yugoslav Montenegrin architect Aleksandar Keković and built by Energoprojekt holding in 1972-1973 period.[1]\n\nThe Old Entebbe airport is used by Uganda's military forces. It was the scene of a hostage rescue operation by Israeli Sayeret Matkal, dubbed Operation Entebbe, in 1976 after an Arab-German hijacking of Air France Flight 139 following a stopover in Athens, Greece, en route to Paris from Tel Aviv. The scene of that rescue was the old terminal, which has been demolished, except for its control tower and airport hall. According to a 2006 published report, plans were made to construct a domestic passenger terminal at the site of the old airport.[10] The airport was partially destroyed in April 1979 when it was captured by Tanzanian forces during the Uganda–Tanzania War.[11]\n\nAccording to ThePrint in November 2021, reports in African media suggest that China could take over the airport over the default of a loan, which was denied by China's foreign ministry and Government of Uganda.[12] Bloomberg News reported that the Ugandan government is seeking to amend a $200m loan agreement it signed with the Export-Import Bank of China in 2015, to ensure it doesn't lose control of the airport, citing a report from the Daily Monitor, an independent Ugandan daily newspaper.[13] On 1 December 2021, the Attorney General of Uganda stated they had seen the story regarding the airport in media and that it was reportedly fake news.[14]\n\nModernization plans: 2015–2033\n\n[edit]\n\nIn February 2015, the Government of South Korea, through the Korea International Cooperation Agency, gave the Government of Uganda (GOU) a grant of USh 27 billion towards modernization of the airport.[15] In the same month, the GOU began a three phase upgrade and expansion of the airport to last from 2015 until 2035.[16][17][18] The entire renovation budget is approximately US$586 million.[19]\n\nPhase I – 2015 to 2018\n\n[edit]\n\nEstimated cost of US$200 million, borrowed from Exim Bank of China.\n\nRelocation and expansion of the cargo terminal.\n\nConstruction of new passenger terminal building.\n\nModernizing and improving existing passenger terminal building.[19][20]\n\nRenovation and rehabilitation of \"Runway 12/30\" (the main runway), is expected to conclude in February 2019.[21]\n\nIn March 2022, online and print media reported that the Chinese-built cargo center, capable of handling 100,000 metric tonnes of cargo, had begun commercial operations. This had replaced the old cargo facility with capacity of 50,000 metric tonnes, originally converted from an old aircraft hangar.[22][23] It is expected that later in 2024, upon completion of the ongoing Phase I upgrades, the airport will increase its passenger-handling capacity from 2 million to 3.5 million annually.[24][25]\n\nPhase II – 2019 to 2023\n\n[edit]\n\nEstimated cost of US$125 million.\n\nExpected delays due to Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nRelocation and expansion of fuel storage facilities.[19]\n\nIn July 2024, the Nile Post reported that Tristar Energy Limited, an aviation fuel supply-company, based in the United Arab Emirates and active in 31 countries, had completed the construction of underground storage tanks with storage capacity of 12,000,000 litres (12,000 m3) of aviation fuel and pipelines measuring 7 kilometres (4 mi), which were ready for commercial commissioning. Over the next five years, the capacity of the underground storage tanks is expected to be expanded by another 11,000,000 liters (11,000 m3). As of 2029, the aviation fuel storage capacity at this airport is planned to be 23,000,000 liters (23,000 m3). Construction of the fuel storage tanks has been ongoing since 2017.[26]\n\nPhase III – After 2024\n\n[edit]\n\nEstimated cost of US$160.5 million, not yet sourced.\n\nBuilding new multi-story car park.\n\nConstruction of new control tower\n\nStrengthen and reseal current runways.[19][27]\n\nExpansion of departure and arrival lounges\n\n[edit]\n\nIn April 2016, Minister of Works John Byabagambi launched a USh 42.6 billion (US$11.4 million) project to expand the departure and arrival lounges. The work will be carried out by Seyani Brothers Limited and will be fully funded by the Civil Aviation Authority of Uganda. Construction is scheduled to commence on 1 June 2016 with completion expected in December 2017. This work is separate from the large expansion partially funded by the government of South Korea and People's Republic of China.[28]\n\nFacilities\n\n[edit]\n\nPassenger facilities include a left-luggage office, banks, automated teller machines, foreign exchange bureaux, restaurants, and duty-free shops.[29]\n\nThe Old Tower\n\nThe old terminal building of the Entebbe International Airport as seen from the air\n\nAerial photo of the city of Entebbe and the Entebbe International Airport at sunset\n\nRemains of 1976 raid\n\nClose up of the control tower\n\nOld terminal building as seen from the front\n\nThe old terminal building as it appeared in 2009\n\nAirlines and destinations\n\n[edit]\n\nPassenger\n\n[edit]\n\nAirlinesDestinations Aerolink Uganda Bugungu, Chobe, Kasese, Kidepo, Kihihi, Kisoro, Kisumu, Masai Mara, Mweya, Pakuba, Semliki[30] Air ArabiaSharjah[31] Air Tanzania Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro[32] Auric Air Seronera Badr Airlines Juba, Khartoum[33] BAR Aviation Uganda Kasese, Kidepo, Kihihi, Kisoro, Mbarara, Pakuba[34] Brussels Airlines Brussels Eagle Air Arua, Yei\n\nCharter: Apoka, Ishasha, Kasese, Kisoro, Mweya, Pakuba, Semliki, Soroti Egyptair Cairo Emirates Dubai–International Ethiopian Airlines Addis Ababa, Juba flydubai Dubai–International Fly-SAX Nairobi–Jomo Kenyatta Golden Wings Aviation Juba Jambojet Nairobi–Jomo Kenyatta[35] Kenya Airways Kigali, Nairobi–Jomo Kenyatta KLM Amsterdam Qatar Airways Doha[36] RwandAir Juba,[37] Kigali, Nairobi–Jomo Kenyatta[38] Tarco Aviation Juba, Khartoum[39][40] Turkish Airlines Istanbul[41] Uganda Airlines Abuja (begins 12 September 2024),[42] Bujumbura,[43] Dar es Salaam,[43] Dubai–International,[44] Harare (begins 25 September 2024),[42] Johannesburg–O.R.

However, the cargo carrier deleted the tweet for unknown reasons and it created doubts about the transparency of Sri Lankan Airlines and speculations arose about the transfer of \"printed papers\" cargo charter flights which departed to Uganda in February 2021.[80] Sri Lankan Airlines later issued a statement clarifying that the printed material which was deported to Uganda included only the Ugandan currency notes and it further revealed that due to security reasons with bordering Kenya, Ugandan government preferred to obtain printed Ugandan shilling currency notes from a global security printer.[81][82] The Biyagama branch of the De La Rue company is responsible for printing currency notes to countries including Uganda.[83] Sri Lankan Airlines insisted that the consignment was purely commercial in nature and brought much needed foreign revenue for the airlines and Sri Lanka.[84]\n\nIncidents\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1976, Air France Flight 139 from Tel Aviv to Paris via Athens (where the hijackers boarded) was hijacked and taken to Entebbe, and Israeli commandos rescued the hostages in Operation Entebbe.\n\nOn 9 March 2009, Aerolift Ilyushin Il-76 S9-SAB crashed into Lake Victoria just after takeoff from Entebbe airport. Two of the engines caught fire on take-off and the resulting crash resulted in the deaths of all 11 people on board. The aircraft had been chartered by Dynacorp on behalf of the African Union Mission to Somalia. The accident was investigated by Uganda's Ministry of Transport, which concluded that all four engines were time-expired and that Aerolift's claim that maintenance had been performed to extend their service life or that the work had been certified could not be substantiated.[85]\n\nOn 14 March 2018, an Emirates flight attendant opened a door onboard an Emirates Airlines plane and committed suicide by jumping. The plane was due to fly to Dubai. She was a 47 year old Bulgarian citizen.[86][87]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of airports in Uganda\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nMedia related to Entebbe International Airport at Wikimedia Commons"
