The city enjoys good climate, and the people in Kampala are friendly. Kampala is the commercial and administrative capital of Uganda and is fondly known as the “Green City in the Sun”. This city is spread over twenty hills with its architecture being a blend of modern, colonial and Indian cultures. It lies to the south the world’s second largest fresh water Lake Victoria. History of Kampala.\n\nWhere Does Kampala Get Its Name?\n\nThe history of this beautiful African city is wrapped in both historical facts and folklore. On the basis of the folklore this city was dominated by swamps and hills which form natural breeding grounds for Impala and other members of the antelope family. The Kabaka or King of Buganda ruled this place and turned the hills into his hunting grounds.\n\nWhen the British arrived here at the end of the 19th century, they named this place as the “Hill of the Impala” because this place was frequented by large numbers of Impala’s which belongs to the antelope family. Due to the blending of the names this place got its current name called Kampala.\n\nHistory\n\nThe origins of the Kampala city go back to 1891 when Kabaka of Buganda had his court on Rubaga and Mengo hills. The town that grew from colonial and royal resting place achieved municipal status in 1950 and became a city’ in 1962. Today, as you stand on the hills of Kampala, the City provides magnificent evergreen trees, gently disrupted by red-tiled villas, green iron-roofed bungalows, as well as taller modern city profiles that give way to attractive views of the surrounding country side and nearby Lake Victoria.\n\nIn 1890, Frederick Lugard constructed a fort for the British East Africa Company. Kampala grew up around that fort. In 1962, Kampala replaced Entebbe as the national capital. Much of the city was destroyed after the 1979 overthrow of Idi Amin’s dictatorship and the subsequent civil war. The city grew as the capital of Buganda, from which several buildings survive, including the Kasubi Tombs (built in 1881), the Buganda Parliament, the Buganda Court of Justice and the Naggalabi Buddo Coronation Site. Severely damaged in the Ugandan-Tanzanian War, the city has since been rebuilt. Manufactures include furniture and machine parts. Agricultural exports include coffee, cotton, tea, and sugar.\n\nKampala is Uganda’s largest urban center, a city surrounded by seven hills. It is the capital city of Uganda involved with different tribes who always come from far distant places of Uganda for business activities. The seven hills include Rubaga, Old Kampla, Mulago, Kololo, Kibuli, Namirembe and Makerere. Although Kampala seems to have out grown its title of the city of seven hills the original seven summits remain important topped by distinctive landmarks of religious, cultural and colonial significance.\n\nThe history of Kampala has both folkore and historical facts. According to the folklore, swamps and hills dominated much of the area where it presently stands. This made it an ideal habitat for impala and other members of the antelope family. The animals grazed on the slopes of the hills and came down to the swamps for water. The palace of the kabaka of Buganda, located on the landscape rich in impala herds. The king thus turned it into his hunting grounds. Folklore merged with history when the British referred to the area as the ‘hill of impala’ which was translated in Luganda as ‘kasozi k’empala. So whenever the king left the palace to go hunting his favorite game, royal people could say “the kabaka has gone to kampala to hunt thus the name was born. It is on this Old Kampala hill that Fredrick Lugard established and put up his fort.\n\nKampala city has gone through a series of changes – many of which have been more of destruction than development. This has been due to our unfortunate history of civil wars and mismanagement. However, in the past years a number of changes have been taking place in Kampala and we are glad to present you a glimpse of how Kampala city looks like today.\n\nKampala lies at an altitude of 1,155 meters from Lake Victoria. Kampala was founded in the 19th Century, when the king of Buganda had his seat in the hills.
