        "text": "The city has an international airport which serves flights from other African destinations and Europe, so for many, it is the chosen city to fly into and out of for their Uganda itinerary. The city today has several natural attractions and architecture that give it such charm and authenticity.\n\nThe Uganda Wildlife Education Centre (UWEC) is a recommended visit whilst in Entebbe. Here, you can take part in a ‘behind the scenes experience’. It is a 2-3-hour adventure and you can learn how to take care of the resident animals. This is more of an educational experience, rather than a ‘zoo’ experience, and the main draw is to learn about the animal’s habitat, current threats and ways to protect them.\n\nMabamba Swamps\n\nA great day trip from Entebbe would be to visit the Mabamba Swamps. This is only a few hours’ drive from Entebbe so it works well to head out early morning and then be back for late afternoon. The Mabamba Swamp is regarded one of the best places to see the infamous shoebill stork.\n\nOn route to Mabamba Swamps, you can look out for papyrus specialities such as the Papyrus Gonolek, White Winged Warbler, Northern Brown Throated, Weyns, Golden Backed and the Orange Weaver to name a few.\n\nMost of the birding in the Mabamba Swamps is done by canoe and cruising through the swamps and waterways is a great way to look for the rare Shoebill Stork. The guides are exceptionally knowledgeable in the flora, fauna and bird life, and we keep an eye out for other specialist birds in the Mabamba Swamps, including the African Water Rail, Allen’s and Purple Gallinule, Squacco, Goliath, Purple and Grey Herons, and a variety of Egrets."
