        "text": "Entebbe, city located in south-central Uganda. Entebbe is situated 21 miles (34 km) south of Kampala, at the end of a peninsula that juts into Lake Victoria. It was founded as a garrison post in 1893 and served as the British administrative centre of Uganda until 1958. Its elevation (3,760 feet [1,146 metres] above sea level) gives it a perpetually moderate summer climate. Entebbe has noted botanical gardens, a veterinary research laboratory, and a virus research institute. Basically a residential centre for government employees, the city has no industry. It is, however, a transportation crossroads for eastern Africa, with an international airport and steamship connections via Lake Victoria to the countries of Kenya and Tanzania and to other parts of Uganda. The airport was the site of an Israeli airborne commando raid on the night of July 3/4, 1976, that freed 103 hostages from a jet hijacked by Palestinian and West German militants. (See Entebbe raid.) The population is African, with small minorities of Europeans. The Asian minority was largely expelled in 1972 upon orders from Idi Amin, Ugandaâ€™s president at the time. Pop. (2008 est.) 70,200."
