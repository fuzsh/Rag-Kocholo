        "text": "Entebbe International Airport is the only international airports found in Uganda. This is Uganda’s major airport that receives all guests that enter to Uganda from all corners of the world through international and domestic flights. The airport is registered with IATA Code: EBB, ICAO Code HUEN. Located on the shores of Lake Victoria the African largest fresh water body in Entebbe town.\n\nThe Entebbe International Airport is 40.5 kilometers away from the capital city Kampala on the South-west. It is operated by the Civil Aviation Authority of Uganda which has its headquarter offices found on the new block along the Airport highway just adjacent to the airport. Entebbe International Airport was opened by the Ugandan colonial masters the British under their Authority called British Colonial Authorities.\n\nA brief history of Entebbe International Airport\n\nThe airport was opened on 10th November 1951 after the expansion of the runways facilities. The main aim of enlarging the runways was to receive large aircraft like the De Havilland Comet. This was the first world commercial aircraft which was manufactured by the de Havilland in the United Kingdom. After the expansion of the airport, the old path remained as a military base which was used by the Isreali Sayeret Matkal as a rescue point. Currently, it’s also the UN base where all their equipment and cargo is received. In 1976 air France was hijacked by Arab-German operation which was rescued and on its way to Paris from Tel Aviv. After the rescue, it was diverted to land into Entebbe Airport.\n\nIn 2006 the plans to construct the domestic passenger terminal was brought which would be situated on the side of the old airport. The old airport was partially demolished in 1979 April after the capture by the Tanzanian forces during Tanzania –Uganda war.\n\nIn 2015 Entebbe Airport plans of expansion were started with the donation from South Korean government through its Agency the Korean International Cooperation Agency. The government of Uganda was given a grant of 27 billion Uganda shillings for the modernization of the Entebbe International Airport. At the same time, the government of Uganda starts the 3 phase upgrade and expansion of the airport which will take so a year from 2015 to 2035 taking approximate $586 million. The first phase which started from 2015 till 2018. The second phase from 2019 to 2023, phase 3 starts from 2024 to 2033\n\nPassenger traffic has been on increase from 2002 till to date, the airport has realized a good increase annually except in 2009 when there was a slight decrease. Currently, there are 18 airlines that operate at Entebbe International Airport. Some operate domestically and others go internationally. The domestic airlines fly across most of the airstrips that are found in national parks of Uganda. While those that fly internationally connect Uganda to different parts of the world. Uganda celebrated its revival of the national carrier called Uganda airline which took decades when it was off. The airlines that service Entebbe international Airport includes Uganda airlines, Rwanda Air, KLM, Precision Air, Qatar Airways, Turkish Airlines, Kenya Airways, Jambojet, Flydubai, Fly-Sax, Ethiopian Airlines, Egypt Air, Emirates, Eagle Air, Brussels Airlines, Air Tanzania, Airlink and Aerolink Uganda.\n\nUganda is constructing a new international airport in Hoima which will soon be launched after its completion. This will open great gates to the Uganda tourism as the airport is located on the tourism reach area near to most of the important national parks. This will reduce driving time as compared to the current situation from Entebbe international airport through great traffic of the capital city Kampala.\n\nAs per March 2019, there are only 2 ground handling companies that operate at Entebbe International Airport. These companies include National Aviation Services Uganda and Dairo Air Services Handling Limited (DAS Handling Limited)."
