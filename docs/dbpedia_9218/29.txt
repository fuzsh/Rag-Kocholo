The Uganda Protectorate was a protectorate of the British Empire from 1894 to 1962, with Entebbe serving as its capital. In 1894, following a religious civil war in Buganda, the United Kingdom made Buganda a protectorate with limited internal autonomy, and the largely Protestant Bakungu client-chiefs were responsible for administration. In the following years, the British would annex other small African kingdoms and add them to the Uganda Protectorate, which became the size of modern Uganda. Uganda was effectively self-governed due to the autonomy of the Buganda people and the limited number of British colonial officials. In 1949, Buganda protesters burned the homes of pro-government chiefs and demanded greater local representation. This led to reforms such as a greater role for Africans in governing the protectorate, and it ultimately led to Ugandan independence on 9 October 1962.
