ยง MR. HERBERT SAMUEL (Yorkshire, Cleveland)

To ask the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, whether he is aware that the town of Entebbe, the administrative capital of the Uganda Protectorate, has no water supply other than water carried by porters from the lake, and that this water is contaminated by sewage; whether the local medical officers have made any recommendations on this subject; and if so, whether their recommendations will be carried into effect.
