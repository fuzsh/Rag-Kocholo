MARINE OBSERVATION SQUADRON 1

VMO-1

VMO-1 began life as a fixed-wing squadron in World War 2, earning battle stars for service at Guam and Iwo Jima. After the war, VMO-1 was based at Cherry Point, and then New River. In 1952, the squadron received its first helicopters, Kaman HOK-1s. From this date, until 1971, the squadron would operate both fixed-wing and helos together. During this period, VMO-1 was the first squadron to operate the HO5S, HOK, UH-1E, UH-1N, and the AH-1J. During the Korean War, VMO-1 trained personnel headed for combat, as well as supporting the 2d Marine Division at home.

In March 1964, VMO-1 became the first USMC squadron to operate the turbine-powered UH-1E "Huey". Later that month two VMO-1 Hueys rescued a party of road engineers from hostile Indians in Peru. In 1965, VMO-1 supported the US intervention in the Dominican Republic. Later that year, the squadron transferred out all of its O-1C "Birdogs", and became an all-helicopter squadron.

In July 1968, VMO-1 began operating the OV-10A "Bronco". VMO-1 transferred all its helicopters in February 1971 and became a fixed-wing squadron again. During the late 1970s, the squadron began rotating detachments with VMO-2 to Okinawa to support Marines in the Far East. In 1980 the first OV-10D arrived, giving the squadron increased reconaissance capabilities. Throughout the 1980s VMO-1 continued to support exercises in the Caribbean, Northern Europe, and the Mediterranean. VMO-1 was awarded a Navy Unit Commendation during this period for supporting drug interdiction missions.

In December 1990, VMO-1 embarked its OV-10s aboard USS America and USS Theodore Roosevelt to deploy to Kuwait in support of Operation Desert Shield/Storm. The squadron flew over 1000 combat sorties, losing one crew to enemy action (1 KIA, 1 POW). VMO-1 was deactivated 28 July 1993.
