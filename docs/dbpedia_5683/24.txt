In 1960 a cadre system was established by which VMO-6 trained new pilots and ground crews for duty with VVMO-2 on Okinawa. After the personnel were trained they were pooled into a rotational draft from which three increments were sent overseas yearly. It usually worked out that being assigned to VMO-6 meant spending about a year with the squadron at Camp Pendleton and another year on Okinawa with VMO-2. Throughout 1960, VMO-6 remained at the Camp Pendleton Auxiliary Landing Field, where the squadron averaged about 900 flying hours each month. VMO-6 maintained a medical evacuation helicopter and crew on constant alert. (#1)

On 30 April 1961, Capt Richard E. Skinner and Sgt Hern again teamed up and rescued two injured civilians whose light plane crashed in the desert 60 miles east of Twentynine Palms. Capt Skinner had to fly 162 miles to reach the injured party, making a 5-minute fuel stop enroute. After reaching the crash site, the injured men were loaded on board the HOK and flown to the Twentynine Palms hospital for medical aid. (#1)

A VMO-6 HOK-1 (Ragay : BuNo. 138098) passed the 2,000 flight-hour mark in March 1962, becoming the first aircraft of this type to obtain this goal.

The HOK-1 was accepted from the manufacturer at Bloomfield, Conn in July 1956. During the past five and one-half years it has twice seen service with VMO-6 at Camp Pendleton and with HMR-363, MCAS Santa Anna, CA. (MAG-36).

The HOK-1 , used for reconnaissance and observation missions, will soon retrace the route it took in February 1959 - to the Navy's Overhaul and Repair Facility at Naval Air Station, Jacksonville, FL. (Kaman Rotor Tips April 1962 - p7 ; and RTips Apr63 - p6)

The 5th Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB) was activated because of the Cuban Missile Crisis and on 27 October it sailed for the Panama Canal. Passing through the canal on 05 November, the MEB sailed into Caribbean waters, where it became part of the 11 Marine Expeditionary Force. The VMO-6 detachment was on board the USS Iwo Jima (LHP 2). By 15 December the crisis had passed and the 5th MEB returned home. Two days later the VMO-6 detachment returned to Camp Pendleton. (#1)

Also HMM-361 "The Flying Tigers" were deployed for the Cuban Missile Crisis on 27 October on board the USS Iwo Jima. Two former VMO-6 OH-43D aircraft (139993 and 139998) were assigned to HMM-361 as of 25 Oct 62 and until 21 Dec 62, after which date the aircraft returned to VMO-6 (# Indiv.Aircraft History Cards).

On 06 March 1963 marines stormed ashore at Camp Pendleton's beaches during Operation Steel Gate. VMO-6 provided spotting for naval gunfire and artillery fire missions.

On 12 March Operation Desert Winds started at Twentynine Palms. VMO-6 provided OE spotter aircraft and HOK helicopter support until 17 March (#1)
