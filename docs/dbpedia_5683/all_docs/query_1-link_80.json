        "text": "Do you want to know why Boeing ðŸ›¬ 737 Max crashed twice (When fuel efficiency and the Engineering design ( A big engine, as done for the Airbus A320 neo) lead to a big crisis. When the battle for business and market share lead to a big catastrophy. When engineers have to follow blind commercial decisions... The issue with 737 Max is that the Engine is above the wings. Which can cause the aircraft to stall if incidence is high. To prevent this, a system composed of sensors and software, called MCAS, literally push aircraft nose down to stay in the flight safe zone. This is done from engineering point of view, software decision, to keep the aircraft safe. Estimating humans, pilots, are doing wrong and software is more accurate and his decision must be executed. The issue with Ethiopian and Indonesian flights is that sensors were giving wrong information. Sensors Data was wrong concerning aircraft incidence. And the aircraft decided, to stay in flight envelop, without any possible deactivation from pilots, to push down the nose. Pilots were fighting to have nose up for a dozen of minutes. No way to avoid the crash. All engineers involved in Avionics & aircraft manufacturing discovered that all what was used as safety rules (DO178B, GANA, Human centered decision ...) was a pure illusion. Moreover, the American Aviation Authority, FAA, acting as Aviation certification authority, like a CCB, with its word to say regarding each aircraft modification, New program, was influenced by Boeing. A part of Boeing staff was involved in the certification. It's like being a thief and Ã  detective in the same time. This is an exemple of engineering decisions taken on the basis of business critical decisions (Do it now, if not the competitor will do it and we will loose the market share). We don't have enough time to build a new product. New design. New production line. New manufacturing process ... Let's choose an existing one and do some cosmetics. https://lnkd.in/ef2fwUQd\n\nCreating an aircraft for every customer mission The #G700 will likely receive final #FAAapproval by the end of the year, & the first 20 to roll off the production line would be delivered soon thereafter. Among those reported to have ordered the luxury business jet is #ElonMusk. The #G400 will be #Gulfstream's first foray into smaller #jets in 20 years, which will begin flight tests during the second quarter of 2024. It is targeted toward small companies & high wealth individuals, joining but not supplanting the #G280 in the market. Gulfstream wanted to make sure they created an #aircraft for every customer, a new aircraft is typically seven years in the making from design, production, #testing, #certification to delivery. The new precision manufacturing facility produces the Gulfstream #G400, #G500 & #G600, even the #G650 got a boost in production when the G700 was announced with a #backlog of $20 billion in orders. The #G800, unveiled in 2021 along with the G400, was designed to replace the G650, but it has been popular, & it seems that Gulfstream will build it a little longer than originally anticipated. #Businessjets are awesome!\n\nThe Boeing-Airbus duopoly in commercial aviation, marked by intense rivalry and technological innovation, has shaped the industry for decades. Boeing's historical leadership, from the pioneering 707 to the innovative 787 Dreamliner, contrasts with Airbus's emergence in the 1970s with the A300, challenging Boeing's dominance. Both giants leverage economies of scale, strong relationships, and vast resources, making entry barriers formidable. While new entrants face daunting R&D and regulatory hurdles, the duopoly's resilience is evident. However, ongoing innovation, strategic partnerships, and addressing environmental concerns will be critical as Boeing and Airbus continue to shape the future of air travel. Way ahead The Boeing-Airbus duopoly faces challenges from a few different fronts: Emerging Competitors: Regional players: Companies like COMAC (China) and Embraer (Brazil) are making inroads in the smaller single-aisle aircraft market, traditionally dominated by Boeing and Airbus's A320 and 737 models. New Technologies: The rise of electric and hybrid-powered aircraft could disrupt the market, with new players potentially entering the scene. Shifting Market Dynamics: Cost Pressures: Airlines are constantly looking for ways to reduce costs, putting pressure on Boeing and Airbus to offer ever-more fuel-efficient aircraft. Geopolitical Issues:Trade disputes and government subsidies can create an uneven playing field for the two giants. Here are some strategies Boeing and Airbus can consider to counter these challenges and promote growth: Product Development: Focus on Innovation: Investing in next-generation technologies like electric and hybrid propulsion systems to stay ahead of the curve. Diversification: Developing new aircraft models to cater to different market segments, like smaller and more fuel-efficient regional jets. Strategic Alliances: Partnerships: Collaborating with other manufacturers or suppliers to share costs and expertise. Joint Ventures:Exploring opportunities to develop new technologies or enter new markets together. Market Strategies: Customer Focus: Tailoring offerings and services to meet the specific needs of different airlines. Focus on Efficiency:Continuously improving production processes and aircraft designs to reduce costs and environmental impact. Overall, Boeing and Airbus will need to adapt and innovate to maintain their dominance in the commercial aviation market. This may involve embracing new technologies, forging strategic partnerships, and remaining responsive to the evolving needs of their customers. https://lnkd.in/dDxMnsjK"
