        "text": "Guadalcanal — 1942\n\nSome Background\n\nAfter the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, Hawaii on 7 December 1941 (an event that crippled the United States Pacific Fleet), Japan intended to seize a number of Pacific atolls for their own use. Doing so would increase their access to natural resources and locations suitable as advanced military and naval bases. Advanced Pacific Rim bases would extend the defensive perimeter of the Japanese home islands. In addition to their successful attack against the US Fleet, the Japanese also seized control of Hong Kong, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, Malaya, Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, Wake Island, New Britain, and Guam.\n\nThe Battle of the Coral Sea (May 1942) and the Battle for Midway Island (June 1942) thwarted additional Japanese efforts to seize advance bases. Both battles were significant because (1) the Allied forces [Note 1] demonstrated to the world that the Empire of Japan was not invincible, and (2) the battles enabled the Allies to seize the initiative and launch a counter-offensive against the Japanese. The United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand chose the Solomon Islands as their place, and August 1942 as their time.\n\nAllied intelligence learned that the Japanese Imperial Navy (JIN) occupied Tulagi in May 1942 and had established a seaplane base in the Solomons. They also discovered that the Japanese had embarked on the construction of an air base suitable for long-range bombers at Lunga Point on the island of Guadalcanal. If the Allies failed to interdict Japan’s efforts, Japanese air forces would be in a position to disrupt allied lines of communication between Australia/New Zealand, and the United States. Only one month earlier, in July, Australian reserve (territorial) battalions fought a stubborn action against Japanese advances in New Guinea. Although victorious, Australian reserves were seriously depleted. The arrival of the Second Imperial Force (Australia) in August (returning from the Mediterranean) allowed Australian forces to deny Japan’s seizure of Port Moresby, and Milne Bay. The Australian victory, with supporting American forces, was Japan’s first land defeat in World War II.\n\nThe author of the plan to attack the Solomon Islands was Admiral Ernest J. King, Commander-in-Chief, U. S. Fleet. The US Marines invaded Tulagi and Guadalcanal on 7 August 1942 [Note 2], capturing the partially completed airfield at Lunga Point, although the airfield required additional work before the allied forces could use it.\n\nAssembling Air Forces\n\nThe Americans renamed the field after Major Lofton R. Henderson, USMC [Note 3], who lost his life during the Battle of Midway while in command of VMSB-241. The first allied aircraft to land on Henderson Field was a patrol bomber (designation PBY) on 12 August. Eight days later, 31 Marine Corps Wildcat (F4F) fighters and Dauntless (SBD) dive bombers landed from the fast carrier USS Long Island. Following them on 22 August was a squadron of U. S. Army Air-Cobra (P-39). Additionally, B-17s began operations from Henderson Field (although the large bombers had an abysmal record against Japanese targets) [Note 4].\n\nThis ensemble of multi-service personnel and their dwindling collection of outdated, dilapidated, and inferior combat aircraft became known as the Cactus Air Force — “Cactus” being the Allied code name for Guadalcanal. Henderson Field barely qualified as an airfield. The Japanese designed it in an irregular shape, half of it sitting within a coconut grove, and its runway length was inadequate the wide range of for Allied aircraft. Even after combat engineers began their work to improve the field, it remained in such poor condition that it caused as many losses to aircraft as those lost in air combat. Rain, which was ever present on Guadalcanal, transformed the field into muddy swamp. Some of the allied aircraft were too heavy for the matting used for expeditionary airfields; takeoffs and landing also damaged the field. Despite these on-going problems, Henderson Field was essential to the U.S. effort of confronting the Japanese, distributing critical combat resupply, and evacuating wounded personnel. Henderson Field was also vital as an alternate airfield for Navy pilots whose carriers were too badly damaged to recover them.\n\nIn mid-August 1942, Guadalcanal was very likely one of the most dangerous places on earth. Allied naval forces were under constant threat of attack by Japanese air and naval forces. To safeguard carriers and their air groups from possible submarine or enemy carrier aircraft, once the amphibious force disembarked at Guadalcanal, the U. S. Navy withdrew its carriers, transports, and resupply ships from the Solomon Islands. This placed Allied ground forces at risk from Japanese naval artillery and air attack. The Allies needed aircraft—badly. Marine Fighter Squadron (VMF)-123 (flying F4Fs) began its operations at Henderson Field in mid-August. One squadron was insufficient to demand, however. The Allies needed more aircraft —sooner rather than later. Higher headquarters scheduled the arrival VMF-223 and VMTB-232 on Guadalcanal around 16 August. The pilots and aircraft arrived on 20 August, but because the demand for shipping exceeded available transport, ground crews became stranded in Hawaii; ground crews would not arrive on Guadalcanal until early September. The formula was simple —no ground crews, no operational aircraft.\n\nThe delay of ground crew at a critical period prompted Admiral John S. McCain, Sr. [Note 5] to order Major Charles H. “Fog” Hayes, serving as the Executive Officer, Marine Observation Squadron (VMO)-251 to proceed to Guadalcanal with 120 Seabees of the advance base force (operationally known as CUB-1) [Note 6] to assist the 1st Marine Division combat engineers in completing Henderson Field and then serve as ground crewmen for the Marine fighters and bombers presently en route. Ensign George W. Polk, USN [Note 7] commanded the Seabee detachment.\n\nThe men from CUB-1 embarked aboard ship and departed Espiritu Santo on the evening of 13 August, taking with them 400 55-gallon drums of aviation fuel, 32 55-gallon drums of lubricant, 282 bombs (100 to 500 pounds), belted ammunition, tools, and critically needed aviation spare parts. They arrived on Guadalcanal on 15 August and began assisting Marine engineers with their task of enlarging the airstrip. Despite daily assaults by Japanese aircraft, Marine engineers and Seabees completed the field on 19 August. CUB-1 technicians installed, tested, and operated an air-raid warning system in the Japanese-built field control tower.\n\nVMF-223 with 19-aircraft and VMSB-232 with 12 planes arrived on 20 August; all aircraft arrived safely at Henderson Field and the pilots immediately began combat operations against Japanese aircraft over Guadalcanal. As immediately, the Sailors of CUB-1 began servicing these aircraft with the tools and equipment at their disposal. Aircraft refueling was by hand crank pumps when they were available but otherwise tipped over on the wings and funneled into the gasoline tanks. Loading bombs was particularly difficult because hoists were rare; bombs had to be raised by hand … 100-500-pound bombs. Belting ammunition was also accomplished by hand. The gunners on the dive bombers loaded their ammunition by the same laborious method.\n\nCUB-1 personnel performed these tasks for twelve days before the arrival of Marine ground crews. As with all military personnel on Guadalcanal, CUB-1 crews suffered from malaria, dengue fever, fungus infections, sleepless nights, shortages of food, clothing, and supplies. Living conditions on Guadalcanal were some of the most difficult ever faced by Marines. Pilots and ground crews lived in mud-floored tents in a flooded coconut plantation called Mosquito Grove. Everyone on Guadalcanal was subjected to mortal danger. Japanese aircraft and artillery bombarded the airfield nearly every day. On the night of 13-14 October 1942, two Japanese battleships fired more than 700 heavy shells into Henderson Field. Ensign Polk’s men remained on the island until 15 February 1943.\n\nFor the first five days after the arrival of the Marine aviators, there was no “commander” of the air component; instead, the senior aviator reported directly to Major General Alexander A. Vandegrift, Commanding General, 1st Marine Division. Technically, the Cactus Air Force was under the authority of Rear Admiral McCain, but as the local senior-most commander, Vandegrift and his operational staff exercised direct authority over all air assets, whether Army, Navy, or Marine.\n\nColonel William W. Wallace served temporarily as the first air group commander. On 3 September, Brigadier General Roy S. Geiger [Note 8] arrived to assume command as Commander, Aircraft, Guadalcanal (also, COMAIRCACTUS) and of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing. By the time of Geiger’s arrival, air squadrons had already suffered significant losses. The pilots were sick, undernourished, and demoralized. Geiger changed that. By his personality, energy, and positive attitude, General Geiger raised the collective spirits of squadron survivors. The cost to Geiger, in the short-term, was that within a few months, the 57-year-old Geiger became seriously fatigued. Eventually, General Vandegrift relieved Geiger of his duties and replaced him with Geiger’s Chief of Staff, Brigadier General Louis E. Woods [Note 9], who was one of the Marine Corps’ outstanding aviators.\n\nGround Combat Interface\n\nAs previously mentioned, the Japanese started construction of the airfield at Lunga Point in May 1942. The landings of 11,000 Allied forces on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and the Florida Islands on 7-8 August 1942 was a complete surprise to the Japanese—and they weren’t too happy about it. As a response to the Allied landings, the Imperial General Headquarters ordered the Imperial Japanese Army’s (IJA) 17th Army (a corps-sized command under Lieutenant General Harukichi Hyakutake), to retake Guadalcanal. His advance force began to arrive on Guadalcanal on 19 August. Allied planes operating from Henderson Field challenged Japan’s slow-moving transport ships, which had the effect of impeding Hyakutake’s efforts. On 21 August, General Hyakutake ordered a force of just under a thousand men to seize the airfield. Known as the Battle of Tenaru, Marines soundly defeated the IJA’s first attempt.\n\nThe IJA made a second attempt on 12-14 September, this time with a brigade-size force of 6,000 men. Known as the Battle of Edson’s Ridge, the Marines repelled that attack, as well. Convinced that the Japanese were not through with their attempts to reclaim Lunga Point, Major General Alexander A. Vandegrift, commanding all Allied land forces in the Solomon Islands [Note 10], ordered the strengthening of defenses at Henderson Field. He additionally ordered his Marines to increase combat patrolling in the area between Lunga Point and the Matanikau River. IJA forces repulsed three different company-sized patrols operating near the Matanikau River between 23-27 September. Between 6-9 October, a battalion of Marines crossed the Matanikau and inflicted heavy losses on the IJA 4th Infantry Regiment, forcing a Japanese withdrawal [Note 11].\n\nBy 17 October, IJA forces on Guadalcanal numbered 17,000 troops, which included the 2nd Infantry Division (under Lieutenant General Masao Maruyama), one regiment of the 38th Infantry Division, and artillery and tank units. The IJN ordered heavy and light cruisers to support Hyakutake and conduct bombardments of Allied positions, including Henderson Field, warranted because the Cactus Air Force posed significant threats to Japanese transports ferrying replacements and supplies from Rabaul [Note 12]. On 13 October, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto dispatched a naval force under Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita to bombard Henderson Field. Kurita’s force included two battleships, one light cruiser, and nine destroyers. Beginning at 01:33, the Japanese Navy fired just under 1,000 rounds into the Lunga Point perimeter. The Japanese attack destroyed most of the aviation fuel, 48 of the Cactus Air Force’s 90 aircraft, and killed 41 men —of which were six CAF ground crewmen. As devastating as this attack was, Seabees restored the airfield to operating conditions within a few hours.\n\nAs Japanese infantry under Lieutenant General Maruyama began their march toward Lunga Point, aircraft of the 11th Air Fleet at Rabaul attacked Henderson Field with 11 G4M2 bombers and 28 A6M2 Zero fighters. The Cactus Air Force responded with 24 F4F Wildcats and 4 P-39s. A large and complex air battle ensured. Allied aviators could not determine how many losses they imposed on the Japanese, but on F4F received extensive battle damage with no loss of its pilot.\n\nJust after nightfall on 23 October, two battalions of Japanese infantry (supported by tanks) attacked Marine positions behind a barrage of artillery. Marines quickly destroyed all nine tanks and responded with devastating artillery fire. Forty Marine howitzers fired 6,000 rounds into the attacking Japanese. The Japanese broke off their attack shortly after 01:00 hours. Partly in response to this attack, 2/7 (under LtCol Hanneken) redeployed to the Matanikau and assumed advanced defensive positions. LtCol Louis B. “Chesty” Puller’s 1/7 (with around 700 men) was the only battalion left to defend Henderson Field, a 2,500-yard perimeter on the southern face of Lunga Point. Puller’s outposts reported enemy movement at around 21:00 hours.\n\nHeavy rain began falling an hour or so before, the torrential downpour inhibiting the advance of a Japanese infantry regiment. In the dark of night under a pouring rain, a Japanese battalion more or less stumbled into Puller’s defensive line at around 22:00. The Marines repulsed the Japanese advance, but the Japanese commander believed that his battalion had taken Lunga Point. At around 00:15, the IJA’s 11th Company of the 3rd Battalion assaulted the perimeter held by Marines from Alpha Company. Within thirty minutes, the Marines destroyed the 11th Company.\n\nFurther west, at around 01:15, the 9th Company charged into positions held by Charlie 1/7. Within around five minutes, a machine-gun section led by Sergeant John A. Basilone, killed nearly every member of the 9th Company. Ten minutes after that, Marine artillery had a murderous effect on the IJA regiment’s assembly area. Puller requested reinforcement at 03:30. The 3rd Battalion, 164th US Infantry rushed forward and quickly reinforced Puller’s perimeter. Just before dawn, the Japanese 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry penetrated Allied artillery and assaulted the Marine position. 1/7 Marines killed most of these men, but about one-hundred Japanese broke through the American defense and created a bulging salient in the center of Puller’s line.\n\nWith daybreak on 24 October, the Japanese 2nd Battalion joined the assault, but the Marines soon defeated them, and they withdrew almost as quickly as they had appeared. Puller ordered his Marines to attack and eradicate the 100-or-so enemy soldiers within the salient, and to search and destroy any Japanese remaining alive forward of the battalion’s perimeter. Marines performing these tasks ended up killing around 400 additional enemy troops. But the battle was far from over. IJN platforms began to pummel the Marines just after midnight. A destroyer assault force chased away to US minesweepers, destroyed the US tugboat Seminole and an American Patrol Torpedo Boat. Just after 10:00, Marine shore batteries hit and damaged one Japanese destroyer. Cactus Air Force dive bombers attacked a second Japanese navy assault force which caused the sinking of a Japanese cruiser. While this was going on, 82 Japanese bombers and fighters from the 11th Air Fleet attacked Henderson Field in six separate waves throughout the day. The Cactus Air Force also attacked Japanese Aircraft, inflicting the loss of 11 fighters, 2 bombers, and one reconnaissance aircraft. The Allies lost two aircraft, but recovered the crews.\n\nAfter completing mop-up operations, ground Marines began improving their defense works and redeploying troops to strengthen the line. In the West, Colonel Hanneken tied in with the 5th Marines; Puller’s Marines and the soldiers of 3/164 disentangled and repositioned themselves to form unit cohesive defenses. The 1st Marine Division reserve force, 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marines (3/2) moved in behind 1/7 and 3/164. The IJA still had more to say to the Allied forces at Lunga Point.\n\nGeneral Maruyama regrouped his beleaguered forces, adding the 16th Infantry Regiment from his force reserve. At around 20:00 on 25 October and extending into the early morning hours of the 26th, the Japanese made numerous frontal assaults against the Marine/Army line (Puller/Colonel Hall). The Marines employed well-aimed small arms, automatic weapons, artillery, and canister fire from 37-mm guns directly into the attacking force with devastating effect. Marines completely wiped out the headquarters element of the 16th Infantry Regiment, including the regimental commander and four of the regiment’s battalion commanders. Another attack came at 03:00 on 26 October. Colonel Akinosuke Oka’s 124th Infantry Regiment hit the Matanikau defenses manned by LtCol Hanneken’s 2/7. Fox Company received the brunt of Oka’s attack. Machine-gun section leader Mitchell Paige destroyed many of his attackers, but the Japanese managed to kill all of the Marines except for Paige and an assistant gunner in their assault. By 05:00, Oka’s 3rd Battalion managed to push the remains of Fox Company out of their defensive positions. Major Odell M. Conoley, Hanneken’s executive officer, quickly organized a counter-attack, leading the survivors of Fox Company and elements of Golf and Charlie companies to retake the ridge line. Within an hour, the Japanese pushed the Japanese back, which ended Colonel Oka’s assault. 2/7’s casualties included 14 killed and 32 wounded. Oka’s losses exceeded 300 dead.\n\nAftermath\n\nSix Marine aviators in the Cactus Air Force received the Medal of Honor: Major John L. Smith, USMC, CO VMF-223; Major Robert E. Galer, USMC, CO VMF-224; Captain Joseph J. Foss, USMC, XO VMF-121 (Former Governor of South Dakota); Lieutenant Colonel Harold W. Bauer, USMC, CO VMF-212; First Lieutenant Jefferson J. DeBlanc, USMC, VMF-112; and First Lieutenant James E. Swett, USMC, VMF-221.\n\nMedals of honor awarded other personnel included Major Kenneth D. Bailey, USMC (KIA), Sergeant John Basilone, USMC, Corporal Anthony Casamento, USMC, Platoon Sergeant Mitchell Paige, USMC [Note 13], Major Charles W. Davis, USA, Colonel Merritt A. Edson, USMC, Sergeant William G. Fournier, USA, Specialist Lewis Hall, USA (KIA), Signalman First Class Douglas A. Munro, USCG, (KIA), Rear Admiral Normal Scott, USN (KIA), and Major General Alexander A. Vandegrift, USMC.\n\nIn all, 20 Marine Corps aviation squadrons served on Guadalcanal. Joining them, at various times, were ten U. S. Navy air squadrons (5 operating from USS Enterprise), two USAAF squadrons, and one Royal New Zealand air squadron.\n\nSources:\n\n1.Braun, S. M.

As a practical matter, given the requirements of global war at other locations in the world, and limitations of certain Allied countries to participate in the conflict, the US played the largest role in the Pacific War.\n\n[2] The Guadalcanal campaign lasted through 9 February 1943.\n\n[3] Initially identified by the Japanese as simply Code RXI, the incomplete airfield became the focus of one of the great battles of the Pacific war in World War II. Major Henderson (1903-1942) was a graduate of the U. S. Naval Academy (Class of 1926) and served in China, various Caribbean stations, and aboard the carriers Langley, Ranger, and Saratoga.\n\n[4] B-17 aircraft were unsuitable for use against Japanese ships at sea. High altitude bombing of moving targets could hardly yield the results of Torpedo/Dive Bomber aircraft. Moreover, B-17 crews were young, inexperienced airmen who, while doing their level best, could not engage enemy ships with precision.\n\n[5] At the time, Admiral McCain served as Commander, Aircraft South Pacific (1941-42). He was the grandfather of John S. McCain III, former Navy aviator POW and US Senator from Arizona.\n\n[6] See also: Building the Hive.\n\n[7] George W. Polk enlisted with the Naval Construction Battalion at the beginning of World War II. He also served as a “volunteer” dive bomber and reconnaissance pilot, receiving combat wounds and suffering from malaria, which required nearly a year of hospitalization. After the war, Polk joined CBS news as a journalist. Communist insurgents murdered him while he was covering the Greek Civil War in 1948.\n\n[8] Roy Stanley Geiger (1885-1947) was a native of Florida who completed university and law school before enlisting in the US Marine Corps. While serving as a corporal in 1909, Geiger completed a series of professional examinations to obtain a commission to second lieutenant on 5 February 1909. After ten years of ground service, Geiger reported for aviation training in 1917 and subsequently became Naval Aviator #49 on 9 June. Geiger was variously described as curt, cold, ruthless, and determined. Geiger became the first Marine Corps general to command a United States Army during the Battle of Okinawa.\n\n[9] Lieutenant General Woods later commanded the tactical air forces under the 10th U.S. Army during the Battle of Okinawa.\n\n[10] The 7th Marine Regiment arrived on Guadalcanal on 18 September, adding an additional 4,157 men to Vandegrift’s ground combat element.\n\n[11] Meanwhile, Major General Millard F. Harmon, Commander, U. S. Army Forces, South Pacific, convinced Admiral Robert L. Ghormley, Commander, Allied Forces, South Pacific, to reinforce the Marines immediately; one division of Marines, he argued, was insufficient to defend an island the size of Guadalcanal. Subsequently, the U. S. 164th Infantry Regiment (North Dakota Army National Guard) arrived on Guadalcanal on 13 October 1942.\n\n[12] Allied naval forces intercepted one of these Japanese bombardment missions on the night of 11 October, resulting in a Japanese defeat at the Battle of Cape Esperance.\n\n[13] Colonel Paige died on 15 November 2003, aged 85 years. He was the last surviving Medal of Honor recipient of the Guadalcanal campaign.\n\nCaptain George W. Sachtleben, 2nd Battalion, 9th Marines\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn January 1969, responsibility for combat operations in the I Corps Tactical Zone (I CTZ) (Also, I Corps), which included the five northern-most provinces of the Republic of Vietnam (RVN) rested with the Commanding General, III Marine Amphibious Force (III MAF), who was then Lieutenant General Robert E. Cushman, Jr. Cushman commanded 81,000 Marine and Army combat troops situated throughout the Quang Tri, Thua Thien, Quang Nam, Quang Tin, and Quang Ngai.\n\n(a) Major General Charles J. Quilter commanded 15,500 Marines of the First Marine Aircraft Wing (1stMAW), which included 500 fixed and rotary wing aircraft at Chu Lai, Da Nang, Phu Bai, and Quang Tri.\n\n(b) Major General Ormond R. Simpson commanded the 1st Marine Division (1stMarDiv) just outside Da Nang, a force of 24,000 ground-combat Marines primarily assigned to Quang Nam Province.\n\n(c) Major General Raymond G. Davis commanded the 3rd Marine Division (3rdMarDiv), 21,000 ground-combat Marines from Dong Ha, whose primary responsibility was Quang Tri Province.\n\n(d) An additional 10,000 Marines provided combat logistics support to the MAW and two infantry divisions under Brigadier General James A. Feely, Jr., at Da Nang.\n\n(e) An additional 1,900 Marines served in the Combined Action Program under Colonel Edward F. Danowitz — tasked with providing local area security to local villages and hamlets.\n\n(f) In addition to these Marines, III MAF controlled combat operations involving a force of 50,000 U. S. Army troops involving elements of the 1st Brigade, 5th Infantry Division (Mechanized), Colonel James M. Gibson, Commanding, the 101st Airborne Division (Airmobile) under Major General Melvin Zais, both Army units serving under the US XXIV Corps, Lieutenant General Richard G. Stilwell, U. S. Army, based at Phu Bai.\n\n(g) An additional 23,800 soldiers of Major General Charles M. Getty’s 23rd Infantry (Americal) Division operated in Quang Tin and Quang Ngai Provinces.\n\n(h) General Cushman also exercised operational control over the United States Army Advisory Group (USAAG), who advised and assisted RVN military units operating in the I CTZ.\n\nEnemy forces operating in RVN’s I CTZ included 123 North Vietnamese Army (NVA) battalions and 18 Viet Cong (irregular) (VC) battalions involving 90,000 troops. There were additionally around 23,500 guerrillas and 16,000 political and quasi-military cadres and another 30,000 North Vietnamese regulars operating in Laos but within striking distance of the I CTZ. These forces were controlled by five separate headquarters elements.\n\nIn January 1969, the communist forces were still reeling from their massive defeat during the Tet 68 campaign [Note 1]; it forced NVA and VC commands to reconsider their strategy for I CTZ. Rather than attempting to defeat the American and RVN forces through massive assault, they adopted the policy of prolonging the conflict through small unit hit and run tactics, sapper attacks, harassment, terrorism, and sabotage. Their focus became severing lines of communications, attacking rear area support bases, storage facilities, and defeating RVN’s pacification efforts. Driving these strategies and tactics was the differences in terrain from II CTZ to the northwestern areas of I CTZ. NVA regular units concentrated their forces in the uninhabited jungle-covered mountainous areas, close to border sanctuaries.\n\nThe Fight\n\nIn the Marine Corps mindset, defense is a temporary tactic used to dig in for the night, or rest, regroup, and resupply their combat forces before continuing the attack. Locating the enemy, viciously attacking him, and destroying him is how wars are won. But this wasn’t the national policy of the United States. The mission in Vietnam was to defend South Vietnam — which gave up initiative to the enemy. Marine and Army commanders hated this with a passion, but those were their orders. But Major General Raymond G. Davis, commanding the 3rdMarDiv wasn’t about to sit around waiting for the enemy to attack him. Soon after assuming command of his division, he ordered his regimental commanders to go find the enemy, and kill him. General Cushman completely agreed with Davis’ thinking — as did Lieutenant General Herman Nickerson, Jr., when he replaced Cushman as CG III MAF on 26 March 1969.\n\nGeneral Davis’ idea of mobile operations depended on the helicopter, of course, but Ray Davis was no one trick pony. He also sought to exploit intelligence gathered by small sized reconnaissance patrols, which were continuously employed throughout the 3rdMarDiv TAOR, which supplemented electronic and other human intelligence sources. The recon patrols were called StingRay operations, who mission was to find, fix, and destroy the enemy with all available supporting arms. StingRay operations were augmented by even smaller “snoop and poop” patrols, known as Key Hole forays. Their mission was to “observe,” not engage.\n\nOn 9 April, Colonel Edward F. Danowitz [Note 2] relieved Colonel Robert H. Barrow as Commanding Officer, 9th Marines. Danowitz was determined to continue the aggressive operations planned and executed by Colonel Barrow under General Davis’ policy of finding the enemy and killing him.\n\nDespite the success of the 9th Marines in Operation Dewey Canyon and the 3rd Marines in the Vietnam Salient, intelligence reports indicated that several regimental size enemy units were again infiltrating into the northern area of their Base Area 611, south of the salient, specifically elements of the 6th and 9th NVA regiments, the 675th Artillery Regiment, and various support elements. Air reconnaissance indicated as well that the NVA were repairing Route 922 and that significant numbers of enemy were returning to the A Shau Valley and eastward into Base Area 101, which was located astride the Quang Tri/Thua Thien political boundary.\n\nTo counter these enemy infiltrations, elements of the 3rdMarDiv and 101st Airborne were ordered to execute Operation Apache Snow in the northern A Shau Valley and southern Da Krong River Valley, cut the enemy supply and infiltration routes at the Laotian border, locate and destroy enemy forces, base camps, and supply caches. Operating under Lieutenant General Stilwell, XXIV commander, 1st Battalion and 2nd Battalion, 9th Marines (1/9 and 2/9) were assigned the task of occupying the southern Da Krong and blocking enemy escape routes into Laos along Route 922.\n\nMovement to Contact\n\nThe 2/9 Commanding Officer was Lieutenant Colonel George C. Fox. Apache Snow began on 10 May when Lieutenant Colonel Thomas J. Culkin’s 1/9 leap-frogged over 2/9 and assaulted Fire Support Base Erskine, which overlooked the upper Da Krong and Route 922. For the Marines, the timing was perfect because the enemy units had yet to reconstitute infantry regiments following their defeat in Dewey Canyon. Culkin’s aggressive patrolling resulted in several skirmishes with enemy forces in transit, but each time the enemy refused the Marine’s invitation to dance. Fox’s 2/9, located 5 miles north, patrolled FSB Razor and LZ Dallas in an area north-northeast of Erskine. They too encountered numerous small sized enemy units, who were also quick to fade into the jungle.\n\nWhile the Da Krong remained relatively quiet, the same could not be said for the A Shau Valley, where four US Army battalions and an ARVN battalion encountered a well-defended hut and bunker complex on Hill 937 and commenced operations to clear it of elements of the 9th and 29th NVA regiments. The battle lasted a week, concluding on 20 May 1969 with 500 enemy dead on the; Army casualties were 44 killed, 297 wounded. Soldiers from the 187th renamed this hill complex “Hamburger Hill.” Subsequently, surviving elements of the NVA regiments withdrew into Laos and avoided further contact with US and ARVN forces operating in the A Shau Valley.\n\nThe 3rdMarDiv continued to maneuver its battalions in western Quang Tri, which reduced the enemy’s threat. During June, the 9th Marines initiated two simultaneous operations, named Cameron Falls and Utah Mesa, which targeted the 304th NVA Division attempting to establish a presence south of Route 9. Evidence from reconnaissance missions indicated that elements of the NVA division had infiltrated into the lower Da Krong Valley, and were moving east and north along Route 616 and the river. A series of rocket attacks on combat base Vandegrift signaled the start of planned NVA pressure on allied positions by the 57th NVA Regiment. Colonel Danowitz’s Marines were assigned the mission of searching for and destroying enemy forces within an area bordered in the North by Song Quang Tri, in the South by the Da Krong River, on the East by FSB Shepherd, and on the West by FSB Henderson. This area was considered critical to the security of Vandegrift and the Ba Long Valley, which led to the population centers of Quang Tri and Dong Ha.\n\nCameron Falls began on 29 May. 2/9 moved unopposed toward FSB Whisman, which the battalion occupied; 3/9 under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Oral R. Swigart, Jr., occupied FSB Shepherd. At Whisman, 2/9 Marines began to shore up their defensives with obstacles, fighting holes, claymore mines, and trip flares. At 0215 on 1 June, a small enemy force began probing 2/9’s defenses and ran up against a listening post manned by Golf Company. Two Marines were killed, but he FSB was alerted. Aggressive reaction by Golf 2/9 resulted in 19 enemy killed with two taken prisoner.\n\nFrom information provided by the prisoners, Colonel Fox learned that the 57th NVA Regiment’s command post (CP) was located to the southwest of Whisman. The 2/9 commander issued a warning order to Fox and Golf companies to prepare for a sweep of the suspected location of the enemy CP; additional intelligence indicated that a large enemy force was moving northeast toward Hill 824. Danowitz redirected the attack toward Hill 824 with two companies from 2/9 in a sweep northeast along the Da Krong River, and two companies of 3/9 advancing east from FSB Shepherd. Swigart reported the terrain and vegetation exceedingly difficult — the twelve foot high elephant grass restricted air movement, making the advance exceedingly hot. As elements of 2/9 and 3/9 converged on Hill 824, both battalion commanders reported that the enemy force was deployed around the hill in considerable strength.\n\nContact\n\nOn 5 June, Hotel Company 2/9 encountered a well-fortified NVA battalion on the southern bank of the Da Krong. The initial engagement was a fight that lasted 12 hours. The best description of this fight comes from the Silver Star award citation issued to Captain George W. Sachtleben, of Chicago, Illinois:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in awarding the Silver Star to Captain George W. Sachtleben, United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action while serving as Commanding Officer, Company H, 2nd Battalion, 9th Marines, 3rd Marine Division in connection with operations against the enemy in the Republic of Vietnam.\n\nOn the afternoon of 5 June 1969, during operation Cameron Falls, two platoons of Company H advanced on a trail along the Da Krong River eight miles southwest of the Vandegrift Combat Base when they initiated contact with a company-sized North Vietnamese Army force occupying well camouflaged positions on a cliff overlooking the trail. Due to their location, the Marines were extremely vulnerable to the heavy volume of enemy rocket-propelled grenade, small arms, and automatic weapons fire, but continued to fight from a narrow ledge with their backs against the river.\n\nDespite suffering serious wounds sustained during the initial moments of the fire-fight, Captain Sachtleben skillfully deployed his forces to counter the hostile attacks, directed the accurate delivery of supporting arms fire, and organized the movement of casualties to a relatively safe area.\n\nThroughout the fight, he completely disregarded his own safety as he boldly moved about the hazardous area shouting instructions and encouragement to his men. After establishing an initial perimeter, he directed a limited assault which secured a toe-hold on a portion of one cliff looming over his position.\n\nThroughout the night and the following morning, he directed both offensive and defensive actions which thwarted or repulsed repeated North Vietnamese Army attacks. Although aware that the enemy was reinforcing and faced by the fact that his company was running dangerously low on ammunition, that his key officers and noncommissioned officers were wounded, and that his men were nearing exhaustion, Captain Sachtleben fearlessly deployed his men, directed their fire, and fought with such tenacity that the North Vietnamese force broke contact late in the afternoon of the second day and retreated away from the Marines.\n\nCaptain Sachtleben’s’ dynamic leadership and valiant actions inspired all who observed him and were instrumental in his company accounting for 54 enemy killed as his company decisively defeated the North Vietnamese Army force. By his courage, bold initiative, and unwavering devotion to duty in the face of great personal danger, Captain Sachtleben upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.\n\nA subsequent sweep of the area revealed a dozen more enemy remains, enemy bunkers, caves, and senior officer’s living quarters.\n\nFinal Tribute\n\nThe United States Marine Corps paid tribute to Captain Sachtleben at Arlington National Cemetery, shown below:\n\nSources:\n\nSergeant Stanley R. Richard, United States Marine Corps.\n\nSmith, C. R. U. S. Marines in Vietnam: High Mobility and Standdown, 1969. Washington: Headquarters, U. S. Marine Corps, 1988.\n\nEndnotes:\n\n[1] The number of enemy battalions went from around 94 in mid-1968 to around 23 in early 1969.\n\n[2] Born in Chicago and raised in New Jersey, Edward Danowitz entered the Marine Corps in 1942 and served in World War II, Korea, the Dominican Republic, and in Vietnam. He retired in 1972. After his military service, he joined the faculty at Rollins College where he taught the Russian and Spanish languages. He passed away in 2013 at the age of 92 years.\n\nYou can place everything civilians know about the military into a thimble. It isn’t entirely their fault, of course. So, it comes as no surprise that civilians are likely to ask such questions as, What is the difference between a Green Beret and an Army Ranger? Or they might ask, Who’s the best, the Green Berets, Rangers, or Marines?\n\nThe answers to such deeply insightful questions will always depend upon who’s been asked. How would one expect a soldier or sailor to answer? A Marine, for example, might offer the questioner a contemptible stare and then just walk off without answering. Marines do have a sense of humor, but it has its limits. One of the best-ever answers originates with a former Green Beret sergeant major by the name of David Kirschbaum:\n\nYou tell the Marines to take a hill and they’ll frown, mutter, and bitch about it, but they’ll eventually salute, organize a platoon, and they’ll head straight for that hill. They’ll fight and kill whoever gets in their way of taking that hill, and even if there is only one PFC left in the bunch, he’ll seize that hill and organize himself for keeping it.\n\nIf you tell the Rangers to take a hill, they’ll salute and then go plan for a few days, write a lot of operation orders, develop patrol plans, argue about the scheme of maneuver, and finally decide who ought to be in charge. And then in the execution of taking that hill, they’ll find the absolutely worst terrain available for their route of march, which will preferably include swamps overrun with poisonous snakes and steep cliffs protected by predatory birds, and they’ll wait for the worst weather imaginable, but they’ll finally go through the swamps and climb the cliffs, and they won’t feel right unless they’ve lost half their force due to exhaustion or snake bite. But if there’s even one Ranger remaining, he’ll take the hill.\n\nIf you tell the Special Forces to take that hill, the first thing they’ll do is ask you why. So, you have to explain why. And then they’ll offer a disrespectful stare which is called silent contempt, and then they’ll just go away. In a few days, they might take that hill. Or they might take another hill that they liked better because the evidence was so blatantly obvious that their hill was the better choice that you can never argue with them about it. Or they might pull some sort of a deal and persuade the Marines to do it. Or, after a few days you might find them at the club completely ignoring the order to take the hill. And if challenged about their failure to take the hill, they’ll soon convince you that the order was a stupid idea and in not taking the hill, they very likely saved you from a court-martial —for which you are in their debt.”\n\nMost people know the Special Forces soldier by his headgear: the Green Beret. They probably do not know that the US Army Special Forces traces its roots in unconventional warfare to the Alamo Scouts of the Sixth US Army in the Pacific during World War II, the Philippine Guerrillas [Note 1], the First Special Service Force [Note 2], and several operational groups within the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Note: the OSS was not a US Army command, but a large number of officers and enlisted men were assigned to the OSS and later used their experience in forming the US Army Special Forces. During the Korean War, men like Colonel Wendell Fertig and Lieutenant Colonel Russell W. Volckmann (former Philippine Scouts) used their wartime experiences to formulate the doctrine of unconventional warfare that became the foundation of the Special Forces.\n\nIn February 1950, the US government recognized a quasi-independent Vietnam within the French Union. The US was considering granting aid to the French forces opposing the communist insurgency of Ho Chi Minh. The US agreed to provide military and economic aid, and with this decision, American involvement in Indochina had begun.\n\nIn 1951, Major General Robert A. McClure selected Colonel Aaron Bank (formerly of the OSS) to serve as Operations Branch Chief of the Special Operations Division, Psychological Warfare Staff at Fort Brag, North Carolina. Within a year, the 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) was formed under Colonel Bank at the Psychological Warfare School (later designated the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center). In 1953, the 10th SFG was split, with the 10th deploying to Germany, and the remaining men forming the 77th Special Force Group, which in May 1960 was re-designated as the 7th Special Forces Group.\n\nOn 7 May 1954, the French were overwhelmingly defeated by the Viet Minh (Communist supported Viet Nam Independence League) at Dien Bien Phu. Under the Geneva Armistice Agreement, Vietnam was divided into North Vietnam and South Vietnam. Between 1950-54, US officials had an opportunity to observe the struggle of France with the Vietnamese insurgency and become familiar with the political and military situation … but one has to wonder, what did these officials do with all that familiarization?\n\nIn July 1954, the US Military Assistance Advisory Group, Vietnam (USMAAGV) numbered 342 officers and men. Three months later, President Dwight D. Eisenhower promised direct aid to the provisional government of South Vietnam, which at the time was led by Premier Ngo Dinh Diem. Between 1954-56, Viet Minh cadres were busy forming action committees to spread communist propaganda and organize South Vietnamese citizens to oppose their own government [Note 3]. In 1955, both the People’s Republic of China and the Soviet Union announced that they would provide direct aid to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (also, DRV or North Vietnam). In August 1955, Premier Diem rejected for the third time Hanoi’s demand for a general election throughout both North Vietnam and South Vietnam to settle the matter of unification. In October 1955, Diem proclaimed the Republic of Vietnam (RVN), which became the official government of South Vietnam.\n\nOn 24 June 1957, the 1st Special Forces Group was activated on Okinawa; within a year, a team from this unit trained fifty-eight soldiers of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) at a commando training center located at Nha Trang. These trainees would later become the nucleus for the first Vietnamese Special Forces units.\n\nIn 1959-60, communist insurgents (known as Vietnamese Communists (also, VC) grew in number and began terrorizing innocent civilians. Clashes between government forces and VC units increased from around 180 in January 1960 to nearly 550 in September. Thirty Special Forces instructors were sent from Fort Bragg to Vietnam in May to set up an ARVN training program.\n\nOn 21 September 1961, President John F. Kennedy announced a program to provide additional military and economic aid to the RVN. On that same day, the 5th Special Forces Group was activated at Fort Bragg. It was at this point in 1961 that President Kennedy took an interest in special forces operations and he became the patron of the Special Forces program within the Army.\n\nUp until 1961, the RVN and US mission in Saigon focused their attention on developing regular ground forces, which for the most part had excluded ethnic and religious minority groups. Late in that year, the US initiated several programs that would broaden the counterinsurgency effort by developing paramilitary forces within these minority groups. The development of these groups became a primary mission of Special Forces teams in Vietnam. It was a difficult mission; one that required an understanding of Vietnamese culture, the culture of minority groups (i.e., Montagnards), and a great deal of patience.\n\nIn 1961, the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas undertook an examination of the responsibility of the US Army in the cold war and the so-called “wars of liberation” as practiced by communists around the world. One focus that evolved from this examination was doctrine needed to counter subversive insurgencies, particularly in RVN. When asked to identify units and numbers of forces needed and best prepared to deal with counterinsurgency operations, the Army selected as its vanguard unit the Special Forces, which at the time numbered around 2,000 troops.\n\nThroughout the Vietnam War, the US Army Special Forces excelled in every aspect of unconventional warfare. As with the other American armed forces in Vietnam, however, the deck was stacked against them from the start [Note 4]. At the conclusion of the war, after Democrats in Congress reneged on America’s deal with Vietnam in the post Vietnamization phase, many veteran special forces soldiers left active service in disgust. We won all the battles, but the politicians back home handed a victory to the North Vietnamese from the jaws of their resounding defeat. The utter shame of American history was not the men who stepped up to serve during the Vietnam War, it was the Congress of the United States who not only turned its back on our South Vietnamese ally, but on the men and women who served in Vietnam as well.\n\nThe Green Berets do not refer to themselves as such. They either refer to themselves as “Special Forces” or SF. Sometimes they are known as “Sneaky Pete,” and “Snake Eaters.” They do know how to eat snakes, but I have it pretty good authority that it’s not a preferred or regular diet (although it’s probably better tasting than the current government faire of Meals Ready to Eat (MRE’s) (also, Meals rejected by Ethiopians).\n\nThe John Wayne film, The Green Berets, wasn’t really about the Special Forces soldier; it was more of a composite picture of soldiers one might find in the Special Forces. According to the retired special forces soldiers I know, the SFG of the 1960s is a far cry from the modern organization.\n\nIn the early days, the SF soldier was an individual we might call a natural woodsman. They were men to volunteered for duty with Special Forces because they preferred being in the boonies to being in garrison and having to take part in weekly parades, repetitious routines, and the chicken shit associated with regular army life. There was some formal training, of course, and it is true that these fellows had a knack for learning foreign languages, but most of the men received on-the-job training (OJT) in special forces operations teams. One former Green Beret described it as working hard when it was time to work and playing hard when it was time to play. Perhaps too much drinking and chasing skirts while on liberty, but these men were, indeed, the quiet professionals who never lost their focus on their mission.\n\nThe primary element of a Special Forces company is an operational detachment, commonly referred to as an A Team. It consists of 12 soldiers: 2 officers, and ten sergeants. All members of the A Team are Special Forces qualified and cross trained in different skills. The team is almost unlimited in its ability to operate in hostile or “denied” areas, able to infiltrate and exfiltrate by air, land, or sea. It can operate for indefinite periods of time in remote locations without any outside help or support—self-sustaining, independent teams who regularly train, advise, and assist US and allied forces and agencies and capable of performing a myriad of special operations. Every member of the A Team is lethal.\n\nBesides the A Team commander (a captain), the second in command is a Chief Warrant Officer. The captain is responsible for ensuring and maintaining the operational readiness of the team; he may also command or advise an indigenous combat force up to battalion size units. His executive officer (second in command) serves as the tactical and technical expert. He is multi-lingual, supervises plans and operations, and is capable of recruiting, organizing, training, and supervising indigenous combat forces up to the battalion level.\n\nThe A Team Sergeant is a Master Sergeant, the senior enlisted man, responsible for overseeing all Team operations, supervising subordinate enlisted men, and the person who runs the show on a daily basis. Because of his interaction with the team enlisted men, he is sometimes referred to as the Den Daddy. He is capable of stepping up to second in command should the need arise, or assuming command should the team commander and XO become incapacitated.\n\nThe Operations Sergeant is a Sergeant First Class (E-7) who coordinates the team’s intelligence, including field interrogations. He is capable of training, advising, or leading indigenous combat forces up to a company size unit.\n\nThe team has two (2) weapons sergeants. One of these is usually a sergeant first class and he is assisted by a staff sergeant. These are the weapons experts who are capable of employing every small arm and crew served weapon in the world. They are responsible for training other team members in the use of a wide range of weapons. As tactical mission leaders, they are capable of employing conventional and unconventional tactics and techniques. They are responsible for the tactical security of the A Team.\n\nThe team has two (2) engineer sergeants. One of these is usually a sergeant first class, and he is assisted by a staff sergeant. These men are experts in demolitions. They are lethal with a capital L. They are the builders and destroyers of structures and serve as key players in civic action missions.\n\nThere are two (2) medical sergeants. One of these is usually a sergeant first class, and he is assisted by a staff sergeant. The SF medic employs the latest in field medical technology and limited surgical procedures, capable of managing any battlefield trauma injury, supervising preventative medicine, and as such is an integral part of civic action programs. Upon completion of the SF training, they are certified “paramedical” personnel, which includes advance trauma life support, limited surgery and dentistry, and even veterinarian procedures.\n\nThere are two (2) communications sergeants. One of these is usually a sergeant first class, and he is assisted by a staff sergeant. These are the Comm Guys, or sometimes referred to as “Sparks.” They are the lifeline of the team, able to establish and maintain sophisticated communications via FM, multi-channel, and satellite devices. Theirs is unquestionably the heaviest rucksack on the team.\n\nIn addition to their primary responsibilities, team members are often assigned other duties. The best scrounger very often acts as the supply sergeant. A scrounger is someone who can steal from other units without getting caught. One member with peculiar culinary skills might serve as the team cook.\n\nIn the 1960s, before the Special Forces were recognized as a branch of the army, they were regarded as “unassigned.” Another word for this was “bastard.” In joining the special forces, a solder became part of a bastard unit. The veteran soldiers preferred being bastards because it meant that they were generally ignored by the geniuses in Washington whose tactical skill set was operating a pencil sharpener. Today, the conventional army has taken over the special forces … which means that pencil pushers now dictate to the field soldier how he must go about his business. If you ask a veteran SF soldier, he’ll probably tell you that today’s SF is little different from the regular conventional army … but they do get to wear service insignia.\n\nOne of my favorites:\n\nStaff Sergeant Schwartz had volunteered for the Special Forces. His request was approved contingent on successfully passing a psychological examination. On the date of his interview, Schwartz entered the medical officer’s office, removed his hat, and took a seat. The doctor, who had been reviewing Schwartz’s medical record, looked up and observed a frog sitting on Schwartz’s head. Having interviewed several Special Forces candidates that day, the doctor was unfazed. He asked Schwartz, “So, what’s your problem?” The frog answered, saying, “I don’t know, doc. It started off as a wart on my ass.”\n\nEndnotes:\n\n[1] After the invasion of the Philippines by the Japanese in 1941, there were sixty American military and civilian commanders of forces throughout the Philippines who evaded capture or escaped Japanese imprisonment on the archipelago’s several islands. With the help and assistance of the Filipino people, the Philippine Scouts formed resistance groups, which were eventually recognized by the American military and eventually supported and supplied by the USN submarine service.\n\n[2] The First Special Service Force, also known as the Devil’s Brigade, was an elite American-Canadian commando unit in World War II under the command of the Fifth US Army, organized in 1942 under Colonel Robert T. Frederick, who commanded the brigade until 1944.\n\n[3] At this time, the average Vietnamese citizen was not overly patriotic. Occurrences outside of their immediate family, or outside their village of domicile, was of no great concern to them.\n\n[4] For a discussion about the United States’ involvement in Vietnam, see (1) Viet Nam: The Beginning; (2) Viet Nam: The Marines Head North; (3) The Laotian Problem; (4) Counterinsurgency and Pacification, and (5) The War Begins in Earnest.

Numerous waterways and man made canals criss cross this area and these are separated by thick tufts of five-foot high elephant grass. In 1968 it was an area ideal for concealing two battalions of enemy infantry, which at the time included the 1st Battalion, 36th Regiment of regular North Vietnamese Army (NVA) and the Viet Cong (VC) R-20 Battalion. The area was extremely dangerous to US and Republic of Vietnam (RVN) forces; firefights and ambuscades were frighteningly common. The Marines called this area Dodge City.\n\nOPERATION MEADE RIVER was planned as part of the RVN’s Le Loi (Accelerated Pacification) Campaign [Note 1] — a series of operations designed to search for and destroy enemy forces. On the morning of 20 November 1968, seven Marine battalions moved overland and by helicopter to establish a cordon around Dodge City. While moving into initial staging areas, even before the sweeps began, Marines lost one KIA, suffered 25 WIA, and lost two helicopters. It was not a good omen. The 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines (2/7) jumped off at midday. Their mission was to sweep from the western side of the cordon toward the rail lines. At around 1630, Company G (Golf 2/7) encountered an NVA bunker complex in an area the Marines nicknamed The Horseshoe. Enemy fire from these bunkers was intense and the Marines withdrew with six additional KIA.\n\nOn 21 November, Delta 1/1 and Lima 3/26 resumed the assault on The Horseshoe. Heavy enemy fire stalled the advance. The enemy had decided they weren’t leaving without a fight and the Marines were equally determined to give them one. The Marines resumed their assault on 22 November. Enemy machine gun fire devastated Echo 2/7 at close range as it began to cross a small stream; Marine losses were 7 KIA and 23 WIA. It took the company ten minutes to disengage. Concurrently, Delta 1/1 began its sweep from the North but they too were hit by intensive enemy fire with loses of 2 KIA and 17 wounded.\n\nOn 23 November, 3/26 moved from the Southwest toward the Horseshoe and joined up with 2/7. Hotel 2/7 overran several enemy positions and was able to recover the remains of six Marines lost on 20 November. Early on 24 November, Marines directed air and artillery against the Horseshoe; 2/7 reinforced by Kilo 3/26 renewed its attack. Again, strong enemy fire halted the Marine advance.\n\nBefore jumping off on 25 November, 2/7 directed artillery fire into suspected enemy positions before continuing the attack. There was no enemy resistance because the enemy had withdrawn during the night. Over the next four days, the Marines continued to exert pressure on the enemy within the cordon. It was grueling work for the Marines as they advanced through thick grass that concealed enemy defensive positions. Meanwhile, 3/5 initiated an assault along Route 4 which necessitated the destruction of several bunker complexes. As they approached a section called “The Hook,” the battalion encountered stiff enemy resistance. The battalion lost 2 KIA and 28 wounded before pulling back to allow for air and artillery fire.\n\n3/5 reinitiated offensive operations on 2 December but made no progress. After additional air and artillery bombardments, 3/26 joined 3/5’s advance on 3 December and the Marines succeeded in penetrating the enemy’s intricate defensive positions during the next day. After air dropping napalm on the enemy’s defenses on 5 December, Marines overran the bunker complex and discovered the remains of 87 enemy dead.\n\nOn 6 December, Echo 2/26 encountered a stubborn NVA bunker complex just south of the La Tho River. Hotel 2/5 and Alpha 1/7 attacked the complex on the morning of 7 December but were quickly pinned down and suffered heavy casualties. As forward observers called in for additional air and artillery support, the grunts withdrew to set up night defensive positions. At around 1130 on 8 December, 3/26 supported by several armored personnel carriers from the ARVN 2nd Troop, 4th ARVN Cavalry aggressively attacked the complex finding 79 enemy dead from the previous day’s engagement. For a time, Hotel 2/5 was pinned down by a final line of bunkers spewing hot lead through the Marine’s line of advance, but the equally stubborn Marines used explosives to destroy the bunkers one at a time, which killed an additional 39 NVA/VC defenders.\n\nThe highly pissed-off Marines of Alpha 1/7 viciously assaulted a series of 12 bunkers killing 47 NVA. As the Marines pushed through the foliage to the bank of the river, they engaged another enemy unit attempting to escape into river killing an additional twenty NVA/VC. Alpha gave up six of their men KIA.\n\nOn the night of 8 December, Lima 3/26 engaged an NVA unit, killing fifteen enemy with the loss of 5 Marines. At sundown, India 3/26’s lead platoon found itself cut off from the rest of the company by intense enemy fire. Staff Sergeant Karl G. Taylor, serving as the Company Gunnery Sergeant, led a rescue team to recover and evacuate the platoon’s more seriously wounded Marines. After Taylor’s Marines had moved several wounded to safety, he returned with four volunteers to reach another group of wounded Marines who were laying exposed to enemy fire. Finding the position too strong, Taylor instructed his volunteers to move back to the company line, and then arming himself with a grenade launcher, charged across the rice paddy while firing 40-mm grenades into the enemy position. Although wounded several times, Taylor silenced the weapon.\n\nMedal of Honor Citation Summary\n\nWhile serving as Company Gunnery Sergeant on the night of 8 December 1968, Taylor was informed that the platoon commander of the lead platoon had been mortally wounded and that the platoon was pinned down by intense enemy machine gun fire. Staff Sergeant Taylor with another Marine in support, crawled forward to the beleaguered unit through a hail of hostile fire, shouted encouragement and instructions to the men, directing them to covered positions.\n\nWith his companion, Taylor repeatedly maneuvered across an open area to rescue those Marines who were too seriously wounded to move themselves. Upon learning that there were additional seriously wounded men lying in open area, exposed to the fire of an enemy machine gun position, Staff Sergeant Taylor led four Marines across the fire-swept terrain in an attempt to rescue the cut off Marines. When Taylor’s advance was halted by devastating enemy fire, Taylor directed his Marines to return to the company command post. He then took his grenade launcher and, in full view of the enemy, charged across the open rice paddy toward the enemy machine gun position, firing his weapon as he ran.\n\nAlthough wounded several times, he succeeded in reaching the machine gun bunker and destroying it. By this time, Staff Sergeant Taylor was mortally wounded, but his actions saved the lives of the isolated Marines. By his indomitable courage, inspiring leadership, and selfless dedication, Staff Sergeant Karl G. Taylor upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.\n\nRichard M. Nixon\n\nPresident of the United States\n\nWho was Staff Sergeant Karl Taylor?\n\nHe was born on 14 July 1939 in Laurel, Maryland. After leaving high school, Karl worked for a construction company as a scraper operator. On 15 January 1959, twenty-year old Karl and his brother Walter enlisted in the U. S. Marine Corps at the recruiting station in Baltimore. After recruit training at Parris Island, South Carolina, Karl completed combat training with the 1st Infantry Training Regiment at Camp Geiger [Note 2], North Carolina. Taylor’s first tour of duty was as a rifleman with the 1st Battalion, 6th Marines. After promotion to corporal, which made him eligible for duty as a Marine Corps Drill Instructor, Karl applied for and was accepted to attend DI School at Parris Island. He served as a drill instructor until 1963.\n\nIn 1964, Taylor joined the 3rd Marine Division on Okinawa where he was assigned to Company G, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines. Taylor served his first combat tour when the division was sent to Vietnam in 1965. Upon rotation back to the United States, Taylor served as a sergeant-instructor at Company A, Officer’s Candidate School, Quantico, Virginia. He was promoted to staff sergeant on 1 September 1966.\n\nIn 1968, Taylor returned to Vietnam for his second combat tour of duty. He was assigned as the Company Gunnery Sergeant, Company I, 3rd Battalion, 26th Marines.\n\nTaylor’s remains were returned to his family and he was interred at the Independence Cemetery, Washington County, Pennsylvania. In addition to receiving the nation’s highest award for conspicuous gallantry, Taylor’s family was awarded his Purple Heart medal. He was also entitled to wear the Combat Action Ribbon (two awards), the Presidential Unit Citation (two awards) [Note 3], and three awards of the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal.\n\nOperation Meade River Terminated\n\nOn the evening of 8 December, the enemy still retained a narrow strip of ground between 3/26 and the Song La Tho. Another push was ordered to eliminate these communists. Along with Marine Corps artillery, the USS New Jersey directed its sixteen-inch guns on these remaining positions throughout the night and into the morning. 3/26 launched its final assault at 1100 on 9 December. Despite the assault of overwhelming field and naval artillery during the night, remaining enemy forces tenaciously resisted the ground attack, but the Marines methodically and thoroughly eliminated the enemy wherever found.\n\nOperation Meade River officially ended at 1800 on 9 December. The battle was a major event pitting determined Marines against equally resolved North Vietnamese and Viet Cong defenders. The operation ended with 1,023 enemy dead, 123 prisoners taken, and an additional 71 VC were captured when discovered hiding among local populations. Marines also destroyed 360 enemy bunkers and captured 120 tons of rice stores — but the cost was high. 108 Marines lost their lives with 510 wounded in action. ARVN casualties were 2 KIA and 37 WIA. Although initially vanquished, the persistent enemy soon began infiltrating snipers and before the end of December, Marines observed that communist forces were again preparing to launch assaults against Da Nang and Hoi An from Dodge City. By that time, the Marines had turned their attention to another problem area which they called “Arizona Territory.”\n\nSources:\n\nHunt, R.

The objective of CORDS was to gain support for the government of RVN from its rural populations influenced or controlled by insurgent communist forces (VC) and regular NVA. One of CORDS successes was the integration of civilian and military efforts to combat the communist insurgency.\n\n[2] Named in honor of General Roy S.
