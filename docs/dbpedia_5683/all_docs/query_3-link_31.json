        "text": "VMO 6 (Marine Observation Squadron Six)\n\nNote: our Dad's unit during the war - Ted and Hal - we would love to hear\n\nfrom anyone that ever served with our father, Edward L. Barker, Lt. Col USMC\n\n(ret).\n\nDad never said much about his service during WWII and Korea, except for vague references. We know that most men who served under combat situations do not talk much, but it is important for younger generations to know what their family members experienced.\n\nEd note: from Hal Barker, Director KWP;\n\nOur father was operations officer of VMO-6 in the fall of 1951, arrived there on September 25, shot down in an HTL-4 on September 26, Silver Star in an HO3-S1 at Heartbreak Ridge on October 7 while attempting a rescue of a downed F4-U pilot hit by friendly fire.\n\nLater he handled operations in the HMR 161 move to the west in 1952. At the time, he was Major Edward L. Barker, and went by \"Lee\"."
