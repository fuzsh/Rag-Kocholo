        "text": "The first Wildcats to fly from Henderson Field on Guadalcanal were hand-me-down F4F-3s.\n\nTo follow up on the location of the F4F-3s during the Guadalcanal campaign: Check out this web site from the naval history command:\n\nLocation of U.S. Naval Aircraft, World War II\n\nand look at the entries for August 27, 1942. While this document is not totally reliable (the Yorktown, sunk at Midway is still carried as \"out of action in the central Pacific,\" I guess accurate as far as it goes but failing to mention that it lay under a few miles of rather salty H2O.\n\nThe list of aircraft locations shows: essentially all significant naval fighter squadrons equipped with F4F-4s, that includes land based support commands. For Marine units the results are mixed as follows:\n\nMarine units based at:\n\nSamoa: VMF-111, 21 F4F-3\n\nNumea: VMO-251, 15 F4F-3\n\nPalmyra: VMF-211, 15 F2A-3\n\nEfate: VMF-212, 16 F4F-3A\n\nHawaii: VMF-221, 30 F4F-3\n\nHawaii: VMF-222, 10 F4F-4\n\nGuadalcanal: VMF-223, 19 F4F-4\n\nGuadalcanal: VMF-224, 19 F4F (no variant identifier) but flown in from newly operational Espiritu Santo. Some modeling sites suggest VMF-224 flew -3s but a photo on a VMF-224 site shows what appears to be an F4F-4 distinguishable by its three wing gun ports. but in the photo its difficult to tell for sure.\n\nVMF-224-4243GuadalcanalTourMainPage\n\nBottom line, The second group of 19 may have been 19 F4F-3... (late entry) but weren't (after checking the record).\n\nAlso late entry: VMO-251 apparently was using a mix of F4F-3 and F4F-3P photo birds. This squadron did ultimately deploy to Cactus but to provide recon, not air defense, although its pilots did fly such AD missions.. (Tillman: WA) AFAIK.\n\nDisplacement roll ok, vector roll, lol, the gamers like to spice their terminology up, I guess.\n\nI know this much, you boys are rolling all over my little head.\n\nThere was a pilot in my Dad's club they referred to as, \"Pappy.\" He's probably the one whom I heard this from. The \"roll\" I heard of was like a \"peel off\" except you completed the rotation until you were, in a manner of speaking, \"back up on your feet.\" The Wildcat would resort to this tactic not only to try to shake a Zero that was hot on its tail but to actually wind up behind it. The Zero couldn't follow the Wildcat in the roll because it couldn't perform the maneuver as adeptly as the Wildcat could. This was a very fast roll, as opposed to a slow roll. The net result, though, was, you'd lose altitude, the Zero would go down after you to try to keep you in its sights, and, in no time, at that speed, it would overrun you. If the tactic worked, you'd be shooting up into the Zero's belly.\n\nLate for the party as usual.\n\nMy opinion, Zeroes were critical to the success of the Japanese offensive to the beginning of May. That an aircraft could be carrier borne and outclass its land based opponents was unheard of before the Zero (though the Wildcat and the Sea Hurricanes did give it a bit of a nudge, they just werent as good as the Zero and still fell short of outclassing their opposition). That such an aircraft was Japanese was viewed with absolute consternation. Zeroes were probably more instrumental in achieving victory for the Japanese than any other single weapon system.\n\nThe Zeroe's rise to fame was rapid, but its fall was almost as rapid. Zeroes were the supreme dogfighter, and packed an impressive range, and a fair amount of firepower on a very limited engine output. Its legendary abilities did come at the price of structural strength and protection. Ammunition supply was very limited, and the counications equipment virtually useless. Pilots also seldom carried parachutes during the early part of the war at least. And the dive characterisitics of the type were very limited. At high speed the controls froze up and became very heavy and unresponsive. The ammunition carried oin the cannon were impact type so did not have much armour penetration capability\n\nThe allies were beginning to realize these weaknesses by October '42, tghough it took some time longer for the correct lessons to be accepted and leant. Basic rule was....dont get into a turning fight with a zero...attack from height, make a high speed diving pass and then use your speed to climb and get into position again for another pass.\n\nA minor detail, and I acknowledge that I have previously had disagreements with buffnut about this (and dont want to go around again...its just that he and I dont agfree even on the basic facts on this issue) . So this should be viewed as my opinion, not necessarily facts....Over malaya, the two Sentais listed as being equipped with Ki 43s were, in my opinion, not fully equipped. At the outbreak of hostilities they had about 45 Ki-43s on strength. There was a fairly rapid re-equipment of these two Sentais with Ki-43s, but until that happened, and the airfields captured brought up to operational status (something not really completed until just before Christmas 1941), the IJAAF very much was outnumbered by the defending Allied fighters. But the the japanese had the proiceless advantage of holding the initiative, and also appear to have suffered low servicieability rates....\n\nKi27s never were never used used for fleet defence, this being reserved for the 25 Zeroes of the \"Yawata Detachment\". They may have been used for beachhead defence (ie the defence of the landward side of the beachhead, though I am unaware of that role ever being assigned to them.\n\nThe Oscar may be, in its own right, an under-valued IJAAF asset. Whether there were 45 or twice that number, its impact appears to me indisputable. I doubt the RAF, RAAF and RNZAF could have been so quickly overwhelmed without its service.\n\nPars, The IJAAF mechs told me they believe you meant to say \"....enjoyed low serviceability rates.\" I don't know Buffnut's objection and feel it would be presumptuous to interject an opinion but Shores et al. (Bloody Shambles) seems to be in agreement with you. They list the 54th Sentai as having 24 Ki-43s in service while the while the 64th had 35 Ki-43 assigned as well as 6 Ki-27 (page 52-53). (With the total Ki-27 available approaching 200 throughout SE asia, including Formosa.) Two normal sized (24 Ki-43) Sentai would suggest 48 A/C, but such 'normal' numbers deviate frequently in any aviation arm regardless of country. The presence of 6 Ki-27 in the 64th suggest mixed types within an organization was as common in the IJAAF as it was in other air forces. It seems to me the USN and RN FAA was frequently in such straights but I don't know to what extent USAAF squadrons did that. I have to say, I've found minor inconsistencies in Shores numbers on occasion although in general I think he is an excellent source.\n\nThe Oscar may be, in its own right, an under-valued IJAAF asset.

I have to say, I've found minor inconsistencies in Shores numbers on occasion although in general I think he is an excellent source.\n\nGreat post and really brings some good information forward IMO. I also believe that frontline numbers for the Japanesewould have been affected by the \"newness of the Ki-43. It was a brand new type, and was still being accepted in the IJAAF generally, and the two Sentais fighting in Malaya. Doubtless there were numbers of those ostensibly on strength and available that would not be available for a range of reasons.\n\nOne of the reasons I believe the Spitfires and Hurricanes of the Commonwealth Air Forces and the RAF enjoyed less success than one would expect was the lessons learned in Europe and then mis-applied in the Pacific. Luftwaffe fighters were best countered by the RAF fighters by enticing them into a tight turning fight. At least thats what the RAF thought they should do. Ill bet the farm that knowledge came out with the pilots when transferred to the pacific, which of course is precisely what you dont do against an a/c like the A6M, or the Oscar.\n\nThat's what I get for posting late at night. I remembered the hand-me-down F4F-3 correctly to the extent that some Marine units received hand-me-down F4F-3s when they Navy squadrons converted to F4F-4. For example, VMF221 at Midway. I could not see confirmation that any of the Marine units initially went to battle on Guadalcanal with Dash-3s, so I was wrong on that. As far as I thought it was Lundstrom where I read about F4F-3 being first in at Guadalcanal. I did a Google book search and that was not confirmed. My apology. I did get confirmation that Joe Bauer's VMF-212 had F4F3As at Efete, but may have been replaced by dash-4 by the time of deployment at Guadalcanal. VMF-212 was deployed to Guadalcanal in detachments. During the dark days of October 1942, they sent in whatever they could to Guadalcanal. There were probably some old repaired planes thrown into the mix."
