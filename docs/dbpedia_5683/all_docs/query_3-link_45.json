        "text": "This Naval Helicopter History Timeline is sourced using historical data and pictures from “THE NAVAL HELICOPTER-HIGHLIGHTS IN NAVAL HELICOPTER HISTORY,” written by CAPT Vincent C. Secades USN (Ret), Published by Naval Helicopter Association, Coronado, California, 2nd Edition June 2012.\n\n400BC |1940 | 1950 | 1960 | 1970 | 1980 | 1990 | 2000 | 2010\n\nNAVAL HELICOPTER HISTORY TIMELINE 1960\n\nThe Department of Defense Announced Two New Developments in Airborne Mine Countermeasures\n\nFebruary 29, 1960. – The Department of Defense announced that two new developments in airborne mine countermeasures had been successfully demonstrated to Navy and Defense officials by the Navy Mine Defense Laboratory and the Navy Air Mine Defense Development Unit at Panama City, FL. The first was an air-portable mine sweeping gear that enabled a helicopter to become a self-sufficient aerial minesweeper. The second was equipment for transferring the minesweeping gear towline from a surface minesweeper to a helicopter, from one helicopter to another, or from a helicopter to a surface minesweeper.\n\nBullpup Air to Air Missile Fired from Marine Corps Helicopter\n\nJune 3, 1960–Test launchings of Bullpup air-to-surface missiles from a Marine Corps HUS-1 helicopter were successfully completed at the Naval Air Test Center, Patuxent River.\n\nHS-4 Rescued 53 Merchant Seamen\n\nJune 10,1960–Seven helicopters of HS-4 from Yorktown rescued 53 merchant seamen from the British freighter Shun Lee which was breaking up on Pratas Reef, 500 miles northwest of Manila. Under storm conditions in the wake of typhoon Mary, the helicopter took 25 men from the wreck and 28 more from Pratas Island inside the reef.\n\nHU-4 Established\n\nJuly 1, 1960—HU-4 was established at Lakehurst, New Jersey.\n\nHS-10 Established\n\nJuly 1, 1960–HS-10 was established at NALF Imperial Beach, Ca.\n\nQH-50A (DASH) was Flown by Remote Control from a Shore Base to USS Mitscher (DL-2)\n\nJuly 1, 1960. – A QH-50A was flown by remote control from a shore base to USS Mitscher (DL-2), underway in the Long Island Sound. The QH-50A was maneuvered about the ship and to a position over the flight deck before the safety pilot in the aircraft took control and landed. On 12 August, at the Naval Air Test Center, Patuxent River, an unmanned QH-50A made its first free flight. On 7 December a QH-50A made the first unmanned landing aboard USS Hazelwood (DD-531) at sea off Key West, FL. A sequence of 38 flights, including 22 simulated ASW missions, followed. Hazelwood became the trial ship for DASH development.\n\nNavy HRS-3 Helicopter made First Recovery of an Object from Orbit\n\nAugust 11, 1960–In the first recovery of an object after it had been in orbit, a Navy HRS-3 helicopter, operating from the Haiti Victory of the Pacific Missile Range, recovered the instrumented capsule discharged by Discoverer XIII on its 17th pass around the earth. The capsule was located about 330 miles northwest of Honolulu by Air Force planes which directed the ship toward the spot. Recovery was made less than three hours after the capsule hit the water.\n\nFirst Free Flight of a Drone Helicopter\n\nAugust 12, 1960–A QH-50A drone made the world’s first free flight of an unmanned helicopter [DASH]\n\nHelicopters from HS-3 and HU-2 Rescue 27 Men\n\nDecember 22, 1960–Helicopters of HS-3 and HU-2 from Valley Forge rescued 27 men from the oiler SS Pine Ridge as she was breaking up in heavy seas 100 miles off Cape Hatteras.\n\nNAVAL HELICOPTER HISTORY TIMELINE 1960 till 1970\n\nThe Department of Defense Announced Two New Developments in Airborne Mine Countermeasures\n\nFebruary 29, 1960. – The Department of Defense announced that two new developments in airborne mine countermeasures had been successfully demonstrated to Navy and Defense officials by the Navy Mine Defense Laboratory and the Navy Air Mine Defense Development Unit at Panama City, FL. The first was an air-portable mine sweeping gear that enabled a helicopter to become a self-sufficient aerial minesweeper. The second was equipment for transferring the minesweeping gear towline from a surface minesweeper to a helicopter, from one helicopter to another, or from a helicopter to a surface minesweeper.\n\nQH-50A (DASH) was Flown by Remote Control from a Shore Base to USS Mitscher (DL-2)\n\nJuly 1, 1960. – A QH-50A was flown by remote control from a shore base to USS Mitscher (DL-2), underway in the Long Island Sound. The QH-50A was maneuvered about the ship and to a position over the flight deck before the safety pilot in the aircraft took control and landed.

On 7 December a QH-50A made the first unmanned landing aboard USS Hazelwood (DD-531) at sea off Key West, FL. A sequence of 38 flights, including 22 simulated ASW missions, followed. Hazelwood became the trial ship for DASH development.\n\nUSS Iwo Jima (LPH-2) was Commissioned\n\nAugust 26, 1961. – USS Iwo Jima (LPH-2) was commissioned at Bremerton, WA. This was the first of a series of Navy ships built from the keel up as Helicopter Combat Assault carriers. Over the years, twelve LPHs were put into service, seven Iwo Jima class new-construction ships and five converted aircraft carriers. Six Tarawa class LHAs and eight Wasp class LHDs have replaced the aged LPHs, with more LHAs and LHDs in the planning stage.\n\nImproved QH-50C (DSN-3) Completed its Maiden Flight\n\nJanuary 15, 1962. – The improved QH-50C (DSN-3) completed its maiden flight. It was powered by a Boeing T50-BO-8, 300 shp turbine engine, and could carry two torpedoes. Large-scale production was approved in late 1963. Three units were authorized for each of 240 FRAM-I and FRAM-II destroyers.\n\nNavy SH3A Seaking Helicopter Establishes a New Speed Record\n\nFebruary 5, 1962. – An SH3A piloted by LT R. W. Crafton, USN, and CAPT L. K. Keck, USMC, established a new speed record of 210.6 mph (183 knots) on a measured track in Long Island sound.\n\nContract Signed for Two Sikorsky YCH-53A Helicopter Prototypes\n\nMarch 1962. –BuWeps issued a request for proposals for the Heavy Helicopter Experimental, HH(X), Marine Corps heavy lift helicopter for the transportation of equipment, supplies, and personnel during the assault phase of amphibious operations. After an intense competition with Boeing’s Chinook, Sikorsky won the contract in July of that year. In September 1962 the contract was signed for two YCH-53A prototypes, powered by two GE-T64-6, 2850 shp engines driving the six-bladed main rotor, four-bladed tail rotor, and gear boxes used in the S-64 Skycrane helicopter. The first prototype maiden flight occurred on 14 October 1964.\n\nCNO Directs Conversion of a Few SH-3A Helicopters for the Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM) mission.\n\nOctober 1962. – The CNO directed the conversion of a number of helicopters for the Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM) mission. These helicopters would be used for AMCM development and training, and eventually would be deployed in fleet squadrons. The Navy selected the SH-3A for this program.\n\nSikorsky Began Conversion of Nine SH-3As to the RH-3A Minesweeper Configuration\n\n1964. – Sikorsky began the conversion of nine SH-3As to the RH-3A minesweeper configuration. The conversion included a pivoting towboom and towhook, tension and yaw angle indicators, and other airframe modifications.\n\nProduction Began of the Bell UH-1E Helicopters for the Marine Corps\n\n1964. – Production began of the Bell UH-1E helicopters for the Marine Corps. 192 units were built between 1964 and 1966. They were used to perform airborne command and control, assault transport, medevac, and other utility missions.\n\nNavy Upgrades QH-50D (DASH) with more powerful Turbine Engine and Fiberglass Rotor Blades.\n\nApril 6, 1964. – The Navy ordered production of the QH-50D model, fitted with a more powerful T50-BO-12 turbine and fiberglass rotor blades. These and several other improvements significantly increased the drone’s payload capability. Taking advantage of this increase, during the second half of the decade, under ARPA sponsorship, the QH-50D was extensively weaponized to explore its use in the Gunship and Attack Drone roles.\n\nNavy Begins to Receive the Boeing Vertol UH-46A Tandum Rotor Helicopter\n\nNovember 1964. – The Navy began to receive the Boeing Vertol UH-46A tandem rotor helicopters. That same month, USS Bell H-71 Sacramento (AOE-1) deployed with two UH-46As embarked. This was the first deployment of the UH-46 in the modern VERTREP role. The Marine Corps also began to receive the CH-46A, which replaced the HUS in the medium lift role. The Navy retired the UH-46 from service in 2004, replacing it with the MH-60S Knighthawk. The USMC, however, plans to keep the CH-46s in service until the MV-22 is fully fielded in the 2014-2015 time-frame.\n\nNavy Uses the QH-50D as a Reconnaissance and Surveillance Vehicle in Vietnam\n\nJanuary 1965. – The Navy began to use the QH-50D as a reconnaissance and surveillance vehicle in Vietnam. Equipped with a real- time TV camera, a film camera, a transponder for better radar tracking, and a telemetry feedback link to inform the remote control operator of drone responses to his commands, the QH-50D began to fly “SNOOPY” missions from selected destroyers off the Vietnamese coast. These missions had the purpose of providing over-the-horizon target data to the destroyer’s five-inch batteries.\n\nA Navy SH-3A Seaking Helicopter establishes New Unrefueled Distance Record\n\nMarch 6, 1965. – An SH-3A piloted by CDR James R. Williford, USN, with Lt David A Beil, USN, as copilot and ADJ1 Paul J. Bert as crew chief established a new unrefueled distance record. The helicopter took off from the flight deck of USS Hornet, CVS-12, berthed at the carrier pier, NAS North Island, Coronado, California. Fifteen hours and 52 minutes later it settled down on the flight deck of USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CVA-42), berthed at the Naval Base, Mayport, Florida. The distance of 2,116 statute miles broke the prior record by 768 statute miles.\n\nA Navy SH-3A Helicopter Flew non-stop Seattle, WA, to NAAS Imperial Beach, CA, Using Helicopter In-flight Refueling (HIFR) capability\n\nJune 1965. – An SH-3A from HS-2 flew non-stop from Seattle, WA, to NAAS Imperial Beach, CA, a distance of over 1,000 nautical miles, using the newly developed Helicopter In-flight Refueling (HIFR) capability to take fuel from USS O’Brien (DD-725) about 100 miles west of San Francisco. During the spring of 1965, working under the auspices of RADM Evan P. Aurand, Commander, ASW Group One, HS-2 had developed the capability to take fuel from destroyers while hovering alongside. HIFR was used extensively in the Gulf of Tonkin to extend the endurance of helicopters operating independently from aircraft carriers. In November 1965, an SH-3A from HS-2 remained airborne 11 hours and 18 minutes during a CSAR mission in the Gulf with the help of four HIFRs, three of them at night.\n\nNATC Completed a Two-Day Shipboard Suitability Trial of the RH-3A Minesweeper Helicopter\n\nSeptember 1966. – NATC completed a two-day shipboard suitability trial of the RH-3A minesweeper helicopter aboard USS Ozark (MCS-2). In 1967 a helicopter minesweeping detachment from HC-6 embarked aboard Ozark conducted a mine countermeasure development program on the Atlantic Fleet. A similar program was conducted in the Pacific by an HC-5 detachment embarked on USS Catskill (MCS-1).\n\nHelicopter Support for SEAL Teams/River Patrol Boats Operating in the Mekong Delta VN\n\nMid-1966. – In response to the need for helicopter support for SEAL teams and River Patrol Boats operating in the Mekong Delta, HC-1 began to deploy small, two-helo detachments to four separate locations in the Delta region. The Army lent the Navy a number of UH-1B helicopter gunships and provided maintenance support for them.\n\nHMH-362 in Vietnam Begins to Receive CH-53A Helicopters\n\nJanuary 1967. – HMH-362 in Vietnam began to receive the CH-53A helicopters, a ten-ton lifter powered by two GE-T64-6, 2850 shp engines driving a six-blade main rotor. They proved to be very useful in the recovering of downed aircraft.\n\nHelicopter Attack (Light) Squadron Three (HAL-3) Was Established\n\nApril 1, 1967. – Helicopter Attack (Light) Squadron Three (HAL-3) was established at Vung Tau, CDR Robert W. Spencer commanding. A spin off HC-1, the Seawolfs took over the four HC-1 detachments. First three, and later two more detachments were added, for a total of nine. By the time the squadron was disestablished on 26 January 1972, its officers and men had been awarded 17,339 decorations and medals, making it the most decorated squadron in U.S. Navy history.\n\nCaptain Stephen W. Pless USMC Was Awarded The Medal of Honor\n\nAugust 19, 1967. – Captain Stephen W. Pless, USMC, serving with VMO-6, was flying an UH-1E patrol when he heard a radio emergency call. A damaged helicopter, under Viet Cong (VC) fire, had lifted off the beach south of Chu Lai, leaving four Americans stranded and in imminent danger of being overwhelmed by the VC forces. Captain Pless and his crew, Captain Rupert Fairfield, USMC, copilot; Gunnery Sergeant Leroy Poulson, USMC, gunner; and Lance Corporal John Phelps, USMC, crewchief, decided a rescue attempt. As Captain Pless approached the area, he saw the VC forces swarming the beach and the four Americans being overrun and attacked at close quarters. Pless ordered Poulson to open fire on the VC and maneuvered into position to fire all his fourteen rockets in the middle of the VC mob, now retreating toward the tree line. He spotted one American waving his arm and immediately flared to a landing, placing the helicopter between the wounded man and the VC. With the helicopter now on the ground, the VC force reversed its retreat and began to advance toward it. Poulson immediately jumped off the aircraft and helped the wounded man, Staff Sergeant Lawrence H. Allen, USA, aboard. The other Americans were severely wounded and would have to be carried. Both, Captain Fairfield, the copilot, and Corporal Phelps got off the aircraft to help Poulson. Captain Fairfield spotted three VCs approaching from the rear of the helicopter firing at Poulson and Phelps. He opened fire with his M-60 and killed the VCs. Sergeant Allen, in spite of his wounds, grabbed an M-60 and opened fire on the VCs approaching from the left side of the helicopter. While dragging a wounded American, Fairfield and Phelps fired their pistols to the VC, now within several feet of the aircraft. At this moment, an Army UH-1Es joined the battle and began to strafe the VC. A Vietnam Air Force UH-34 landed next to Pless’ helicopter. With three wounded Americans onboard, and the fourth clearly dead, Pless decided it was time to depart and take the wounded men to a medical facility. With the VC still firing at him with automatic weapons, he had to depart over water. Grossly overloaded, he bounced off the waves four times before gaining enough speed and building his rotor rpm up. For his actions that day, Captain Stephen W. Pless was awarded the Medal of Honor. He was the only Marine helicopter pilot to receive the Medal of Honor in Vietnam, and the first of two naval helicopter pilots to do so. Captain Rupert E. Fairfield, Gunnery Sergeant Leroy N. Poulson, and Lance Corporal John G. Phelps were awarded the Navy Cross. Captain Pless and his crew represent the highest decorated helicopter crew in the Vietnam War. Staff Sergeant Lawrence H. Allen was awarded the Silver Star.\n\nHC-1 Splits into Four Different Squadrons\n\nSeptember 1, 1967. – HC-1 was split into four different squadrons: HC-1, HC-3, HC-5, and HC-7. HC-1 retained the plane guard mission. HC-3 assumed the vertical replenishment mission. HC-5 became the Fleet Replacement Aircrew Training squadron. HC-7 took on the CSAR and minesweeping missions. In fulfilling the CSAR mission off the coast of North Vietnam, Navy helicopter crews wrote many pages of heroic history. The story of a rescue by HC-7 Detachment 104 in a dark summer night in 1968 is a stellar example.\n\nLTJG Clyde E. Lassen Was Awarded the Medal of Honor\n\nJune 19, 1968. – Shortly after midnight on 19 June 1968, LTJG Clyde E. Lassen, with copilot LTJG Leroy Cook, and gunners/rescue aircrewmen ADJ3 Donald West and AE2 Bruce Dallas, launched from USS Preble (DLG-15), on station off the coast of North Vietnam. Two aviators had ejected twenty miles inside enemy territory after their F-4J aircraft was hit by a surface-to-air missile. After locating the survivors in a heavily wooded area, Lassen set his UH-2A down on a rice paddy while urging the two survivors to come out of the thick vegetation. The UH-2A began to take small arms fire. With “Come get us” calls coming through his earphones, Lassen decided to try to get above the survivors and hoist them aboard. Using the illumination from RESCAP parachute flares, Lassen positioned the helicopter above the survivors, between two towering trees. Before the air crewmen could begin the hoisting operation the flares went out and the world went pitch black. The helicopter hit a tree and started to spin right. Lassen regained control and waved off. The UH-2A had lost a door but was still flyable. A new RESCAP arrived with more flares. Lassen determined that the survivors would have to make their way to the clearing if they had any hope of being rescued. As Lassen approached the clearing for a second landing, small arms fire erupted along the perimeter. The survivors were too far away and Lassen aborted the approach. During the third approach the last of the illumination flares went out. Lassen decided to turn the landing light on and expose the aircraft to enemy gunners rather than to abandon the survivors. For two minutes he hovered, with the landing gear just touching the mud, while Dallas and West blasted away at the tree line nearby. Finally the survivors, LCDR John Holtzclaw and LCDR John A. Burns emerged from the dark and were yanked inside the helicopter. With the aircraft vibrating abnormally, a malfunctioning compass, and a low fuel state, Lassen headed for the coast while dodging antiaircraft fire. He landed the crippled helicopter aboard the closest ship available, USS Jouett (DLG-29), with 135 pounds of fuel, five minutes of flight time, left in the tanks. For his heroic actions LTJG Clyde E. Lassen was awarded the Medal of Honor. He was the second helicopter pilot to receive the MoH in U.S. Navy history, and the only one during the Vietnam War.\n\nNavy Orders 40 Bell Jet Ranger Helicopters, TH-57A, as Primary Trainers\n\nJanuary 1968. – The Navy ordered 40 Bell Jet Ranger helicopters, Navy designation TH-57A, to be used as primary trainers. Deliveries to HT-8 began in October 1968.\n\nMarine Corps Awards Bell a Contract for 49 AH-1J Sea Cobras\n\nMay 1968. – The Marine Corps awarded Bell a contract for 49 AH-1Js. The Sea Cobra featured the 1,290 shp Pratt & Whitney T400 twin-pack engine. The new attack helicopter was armed with guided anti armor missiles, unguided rockets, 20-millimeter cannons or 7.62-millimeter machine guns. HMA-269 was the first to receive the Sea Cobra in April 1971. As an interim measure, the U.S. Army had transfered 38 AH-1Gs to the Marines in 1969. Through the 1970s, various models of the AH-1 were produced, featuring improved armament and more powerful engines. AH-1 development and deployment continues to the present, the most recently acquired model being the AH-1Z Viper, which is expected to continue in service until 2018.\n\nCH-53D Sea Stallion Completes its Maiden Flight\n\nJanuary 27, 1969. – The CH-53 D, a more powerful version of the Sea Stallion, completed its maiden flight. CH-53Ds began to arrive in Vietnam later that year.\n\nDASH Operations Ceased Fleet-Wide\n\nNovember 30, 1970. – DASH operations ceased fleet-wide. Although DASH was a sound concept, its faulty implementation sealed its fate. The Achilles heel of the system was the electronic remote control system. The lack of feedback loop from the drone to the controller, and its low radar signature and lack of transponder accounted for 80% of all drone losses. With the DASH program officially terminated and ARPA ceasing to develop new QH-50 applications in 1974 due to budgetary cuts following the end of the Vietnam conflict, the remaining QH-50C/D drones were transferred to the Naval Air Warfare Center, China Lake, and the Army White Sands Missile Test Range to be used as targets. In 1995 the Navy transferred their exiguous drone inventory to the Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO-STRI) at White Sands.\n\nNAVAL HELICOPTER HISTORY TIMELINE 1962\n\nImproved QH-50C (DSN-3) Completed its Maiden Flight\n\nJanuary 15, 1962. – The improved QH-50C (DSN-3) completed its maiden flight. It was powered by a Boeing T50-BO-8, 300 shp turbine engine, and could carry two torpedoes. Large-scale production was approved in late 1963. Three units were authorized for each of 240 FRAM-I and FRAM-II destroyers.\n\nNavy SH3A Seaking Helicopter Establishes a New Speed Record\n\nFebruary 5, 1962. – An SH3A piloted by LT R. W. Crafton, USN, and CAPT L. K. Keck, USMC, established a new speed record of 210.6 mph (183 knots) on a measured track in Long Island sound.\n\nMercury Spacecraft Recovery\n\nFebruary 20, 1962–Lieutenant Colonel John H. Glenn. USMC, in Mercury spacecraft Friendship 7, was launched from Cape Canaveral by an Atlas rocket. His three turns about the earth were the first U.S. manned orbital flights. He was recovered some 166 miles east of Grand Turk Island in the Bahamas by the destroyer Noa (DD 841) and then delivered by helicopter to the carrier Randolph.\n\nContract Signed for Two Sikorsky YCH-53A Helicopter Prototypes\n\nMarch 1962. –BuWeps issued a request for proposals for the Heavy Helicopter Experimental, HH(X), Marine Corps heavy lift helicopter for the transportation of equipment, supplies, and personnel during the assault phase of amphibious operations. After an intense competition with Boeing’s Chinook, Sikorsky won the contract in July of that year. In September 1962 the contract was signed for two YCH-53A prototypes, powered by two GE-T64-6, 2850 shp engines driving the six-bladed main rotor, four-bladed tail rotor, and gear boxes used in the S-64 Skycrane helicopter. The first prototype maiden flight occurred on 14 October 1964.\n\nAnother Mercury Spacecraft Recovered\n\nMay 24, 1962–Lieutenant Commander M. Scott Carpenter in Aurora 7 was launched into orbit from Cape Canaveral on the second U.S. manned orbital flight. Upon completing three orbits he returned to earth landing in the Atlantic 200 miles beyond the planned impact area. He was located by a Navy P2V, assisted by para-rescue men dropped from an Air Force RC-54 and, after almost 3 hours in the water, picked up by an HSS helicopter from Intrepid and returned safely to the carrier. His capsule was retrieved by the destroyer John R. Pierce.\n\nMercury Spacecraft Recovered\n\nOctober 3, 1962–Sigma 7, Commander Walter M. Schirra pilot was launched into orbit by a Mercury-Atlas rocket from Cape Canaveral and, after nearly six orbits and a flight of over 160,000 miles, landed in the Pacific, 275 miles northeast of Midway Island. Helicopters dropped UDT men near the capsule and it and Commander Schirra were hoisted aboard Kearsarge.\n\nCNO Directs Conversion of a Few SH-3A Helicopters for the Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM) mission.\n\nOctober 16, 1962. – The CNO directed the conversion of a number of helicopters for the Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM) mission. These helicopters would be used for AMCM development and training, and eventually would be deployed in fleet squadrons. The Navy selected the SH-3A for this program.\n\nMarine Corps Transition Two Fixed Wing Squadrons to Helicopters\n\nNovember 5, 1962–Two Marine Corps helicopter squadrons began, as additional duty, a transition training program in which some 500 Marine aviators qualified in fixed-wing aircraft would be trained to operate helicopters. The need for the special program arose from the increased proportion of helicopters in the Marine Corps, coupled with an overall shortage of pilots and the inability of the Naval Air Training Command to absorb the additional training load within the time schedule allotted.\n\nNAVAL HELICOPTER HISTORY TIMELINE 1963\n\nNaval Helicopters Fly Relief Missions in Morocco\n\nJanuary 7-13, 1963–Helicopters from NAS Port Lyautey, NS Rota and Springfield flew rescue and relief missions in the flooded areas of Beth and Sebou Rivers in Morocco. Over 45,000 pounds of food, medicines and emergency supplies were flown in and some 320 marooned persons were lifted to safety.\n\nHS-9 Helicopters Make Texas Towers Rescue off Cap Cod\n\nSeptember 6, 1963–Five SH-3A helicopters of HS-9 based at NAS Quonset rescued 28 workmen from two Texas Towers shaken by gales and heavy seas off Cape Cod.\n\nNAVAL HELICOPTER HISTORY TIMELINE 1964\n\nSikorsky Began Conversion of Nine SH-3As to the RH-3A Minesweeper Configuration\n\n1964. – Sikorsky began the conversion of nine SH-3As to the RH-3A minesweeper configuration. The conversion included a pivoting towboom and towhook, tension and yaw angle indicators, and other airframe modifications.\n\nProduction Began of the Bell UH-1E Helicopters for the Marine Corps\n\n1964. – Production began of the Bell UH-1E helicopters for the Marine Corps. 192 units were built between 1964 and 1966. They were used to perform airborne command and control, assault transport, medevac, and other utility missions.\n\nFirst Helicopter Landing on a Combat Store Ship Mars (AFS-1)\n\nFebruary 28, 1964–A helicopter piloted by Commander D. W. Fisher of HU-1 made the first landing on the deck of the combat store ship Mars (AFS 1) during her shakedown cruise off San Diego. Although the concept of vertical replenishment at sea had been discussed and tested as early as 1959 and helicopter platforms had been installed on certain logistics ships since then, commissioning of the Mars provided the first real opportunity to incorporate the helicopter into the fleet logistic support system.\n\nMarine Corps Helicopters Rescues 11 in Peru\n\nMarch 23, 1964–Two Marine helicopter crews of VMO-1 rescued 11 sick, injured and wounded members of a road engineering party that had survived attacks by hostile Indians in the dense jungle of the Amazon basin near Iquitos, Peru.

Pless USMC Was Awarded The Medal of Honor\n\nAugust 19, 1967. – Captain Stephen W. Pless, USMC, serving with VMO-6, was flying an UH-1E patrol when he heard a radio emergency call. A damaged helicopter, under Viet Cong (VC) fire, had lifted off the beach south of Chu Lai, leaving four Americans stranded and in imminent danger of being overwhelmed by the VC forces. Captain Pless and his crew, Captain Rupert Fairfield, USMC, copilot; Gunnery Sergeant Leroy Poulson, USMC, gunner; and Lance Corporal John Phelps, USMC, crewchief, decided a rescue attempt. As Captain Pless approached the area, he saw the VC forces swarming the beach and the four Americans being overrun and attacked at close quarters. Pless ordered Poulson to open fire on the VC and maneuvered into position to fire all his fourteen rockets in the middle of the VC mob, now retreating toward the tree line. He spotted one American waving his arm and immediately flared to a landing, placing the helicopter between the wounded man and the VC. With the helicopter now on the ground, the VC force reversed its retreat and began to advance toward it. Poulson immediately jumped off the aircraft and helped the wounded man, Staff Sergeant Lawrence H. Allen, USA, aboard. The other Americans were severely wounded and would have to be carried. Both, Captain Fairfield, the copilot, and Corporal Phelps got off the aircraft to help Poulson. Captain Fairfield spotted three VCs approaching from the rear of the helicopter firing at Poulson and Phelps. He opened fire with his M-60 and killed the VCs. Sergeant Allen, in spite of his wounds, grabbed an M-60 and opened fire on the VCs approaching from the left side of the helicopter. While dragging a wounded American, Fairfield and Phelps fired their pistols to the VC, now within several feet of the aircraft. At this moment, an Army UH-1Es joined the battle and began to strafe the VC. A Vietnam Air Force UH-34 landed next to Pless’ helicopter. With three wounded Americans onboard, and the fourth clearly dead, Pless decided it was time to depart and take the wounded men to a medical facility. With the VC still firing at him with automatic weapons, he had to depart over water. Grossly overloaded, he bounced off the waves four times before gaining enough speed and building his rotor rpm up. For his actions that day, Captain Stephen W. Pless was awarded the Medal of Honor. He was the only Marine helicopter pilot to receive the Medal of Honor in Vietnam, and the first of two naval helicopter pilots to do so. Captain Rupert E. Fairfield, Gunnery Sergeant Leroy N. Poulson, and Lance Corporal John G. Phelps were awarded the Navy Cross. Captain Pless and his crew represent the highest decorated helicopter crew in the Vietnam War. Staff Sergeant Lawrence H. Allen was awarded the Silver Star.\n\nHC-1 Splits into Four Different Squadrons\n\nSeptember 1, 1967. – HC-1 was split into four different squadrons: HC-1, HC-3, HC-5, and HC-7.

The Sea Cobra featured the 1,290 shp Pratt & Whitney T400 twin-pack engine. The new attack helicopter was armed with guided anti armor missiles, unguided rockets, 20-millimeter cannons or 7.62-millimeter machine guns. HMA-269 was the first to receive the Sea Cobra in April 1971. As an interim measure, the U.S. Army had transfered 38 AH-1Gs to the Marines in 1969. Through the 1970s, various models of the AH-1 were produced, featuring improved armament and more powerful engines. AH-1 development and deployment continues to the present, the most recently acquired model being the AH-1Z Viper, which is expected to continue in service until 2018.\n\nLTJG Clyde E. Lassen Was Awarded the Medal of Honor\n\nJune 19, 1968. – Shortly after midnight on 19 June 1968, LTJG Clyde E. Lassen, with copilot LTJG Leroy Cook, and gunners/rescue aircrewmen ADJ3 Donald West and AE2 Bruce Dallas, launched from USS Preble (DLG-15), on station off the coast of North Vietnam. Two aviators had ejected twenty miles inside enemy territory after their F-4J aircraft was hit by a surface-to-air missile. After locating the survivors in a heavily wooded area, Lassen set his UH-2A down on a rice paddy while urging the two survivors to come out of the thick vegetation. The UH-2A began to take small arms fire. With “Come get us” calls coming through his earphones, Lassen decided to try to get above the survivors and hoist them aboard. Using the illumination from RESCAP parachute flares, Lassen positioned the helicopter above the survivors, between two towering trees. Before the air crewmen could begin the hoisting operation the flares went out and the world went pitch black. The helicopter hit a tree and started to spin right. Lassen regained control and waved off. The UH-2A had lost a door but was still flyable. A new RESCAP arrived with more flares. Lassen determined that the survivors would have to make their way to the clearing if they had any hope of being rescued. As Lassen approached the clearing for a second landing, small arms fire erupted along the perimeter. The survivors were too far away and Lassen aborted the approach. During the third approach the last of the illumination flares went out. Lassen decided to turn the landing light on and expose the aircraft to enemy gunners rather than to abandon the survivors. For two minutes he hovered, with the landing gear just touching the mud, while Dallas and West blasted away at the tree line nearby. Finally the survivors, LCDR John Holtzclaw and LCDR John A. Burns emerged from the dark and were yanked inside the helicopter. With the aircraft vibrating abnormally, a malfunctioning compass, and a low fuel state, Lassen headed for the coast while dodging antiaircraft fire. He landed the crippled helicopter aboard the closest ship available, USS Jouett (DLG-29), with 135 pounds of fuel, five minutes of flight time, left in the tanks. For his heroic actions LTJG Clyde E. Lassen was awarded the Medal of Honor. He was the second helicopter pilot to receive the MoH in U.S. Navy history, and the only one during the Vietnam War.\n\nMarine Observation Squadron 2 (VMO-2) Stationed at Da Nang, South Vietnam, Received the First OV-1OA, Broncos\n\nJuly 6, 1968–Marine Observation Squadron 2 (VMO-2) stationed at Da Nang, South Vietnam, received the first OV-1OA, Broncos, to arrive in South Vietnam.
