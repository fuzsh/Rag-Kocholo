        "text": "Armament part 2\n\nBut weight was always the determining factor, and with heavy guns you couldn’t carry enough ammo for them to be more than a novelty. It was finally determined that the best trade-off between weight, ammunition capacity and firepower was a system that fired a 7.62 round. For the “B” model the gun system used two M-60’s to a side, for the more powerful “C” model, the M-21 system was adopted with a 7.62 mini-gun on each side.\n\nTo feed the mini-guns, four rows of 3 ammo cans were mounted across the aircraft, two rows for each gun connected by a cross-over feed. Each can held 600 rounds, so each gun had 6 cans plus the ammo across the top and in the chutes for a total of about 4,000 rounds per gun. The guns were slowed to about 2,500 RPM and timed to 3 second bursts, each burst emptying a can. When both guns were fired at the same time, the airspeed would drop about 3 knots in a diving gun run. If the guns were fired one at a time, the aircraft would yaw noticeably, a condition that caught new pilots by surprise.\n\nBy using jump seats for the GIB’s the ammo cans could be reloaded in flight. The guy in this shot went on to become a colonel.\n\nArmament specialist messing around with the sight for the mini-guns.\n\nWhen the mini-gun fired it sounded like a really loud zipper.\n\nHere’s lookin atcha!\n\nMini-gun firing at night.\n\nEvery gunship carried rocket pods for the FFAR (folding fin aerial rocket) developed in WW II, most commonly the 7 shot pods, however, the M-3 “Hog” system carried 24 rockets to a side. Pilots did not like it because the pilot that flew also fired, so the other pilot had nothing to do except try to control his pucker factor. Enlisted crews didn’t like it because 48 rockets was an entire pallet, and those things had to be assembled one at a time. I didn’t like them because every time you got in or out of the aircraft you were in front of the business end of the system. Three or four volts of static electricity could fire the entire salvo. We “broke” our M-3 system early on. Each rocket had a ten pound warhead, the equivalent of a 75mm howitzer round. By mid 68 we had a 17 pound warhead that was the equivalent of a 105. We also had flechettes that were really cool, but we had to use them with extra care, and proximity fuses that were awesome.\n\nArmament part 3\n\nThe M-5 40mm launcher was the next most common system, also used with the 7 shot rocket pods. The launcher was mounted on the nose, the ammo chute was on the left side of the console next to the pilot’s seat and ran back to the magazine mounted fore and aft against the cabin bulkhead. The system came with a small magazine that held 40 rounds. We immediately threw it out and went to the sheet metal shop to create a 3 foot high magazine that held 120 rounds. Cyclic rate of fire was between 2 and 3 rounds a second and reminded me of someone walking down a sidewalk spitting watermelon seeds. In the right light you could see the rounds leave the gun, arch up to the left, straighten out and head for the target. They were different rounds than the M-79 round, they had more propellant and a raised ring around the middle for the links. The ring also made the round “idiot proof” by preventing it from being loaded in an M-79, it would have taken off someone’s shoulder for sure.\n\nM-5 system set up on display somewhere. Note the itty bitty worthless ammo can.\n\nLoaded and ready for bear, except someone is going to have to take it all apart and put the covers on.\n\nThe system being installed on one of our aircraft.\n\nNow at the risk of disappointing anyone, I would like to point out that the gunship with both the M-5 system and the M-21 system on the same airframe that has been made famous by model makers never saw combat. It never left the states. The one and only aircraft armed in such a fashion was a trials aircraft that proved what everyone knew, that it would never work. Before some dedicated modeler throws stones at me, consider this: there was not room enough for ammunition for both guns unless you only carried about 40 rounds for the M-5. In a gun run the pilot flying the aircraft also fired the rockets, the other pilot fired the mini-guns, just who is going to fire the M-5, they had a completely different sighting system. But weight was the deciding factor, in order to get off the ground the aircraft could only carry about 2,000 rounds for each mini-gun.\n\nThe 1300 horsepower engine that first appeared in the “H” model made a world of difference, and of course allowed more junk to be hung on the aircraft. When the engine began appearing in rebuilt “C” models, now relabeled “M” models, the result was staggering. We could now get off the ground with a full load of fuel as well as a full load of ammunition. And in a really hairy situation we could add two additional door gunners"
