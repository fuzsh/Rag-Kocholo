PURPOSE Fleet Marine Force Reference Publications (FMFRP) 12-34-1 to 12-34-V, History of the U.S. Marine Corps Operations in World War II, Volumes I-V, are published to ensure the retention and dissem- ination of useful information learned in World War 11 by the U.S. Marine Corps. This information is not meant to be doctrinal or to be published in Fleet Marine Force manuals. FMFRPs in the 12 Series are a special category: reprints of historical works which are not available elsewhere. 2. SCOPE This set of reference publications was written by the historical branch of the U.S. Marine Corps. They provide the reader with a detailed knowledge of U.S. Marine Corps World War II operations, tactics, and organization throughout the span of World War II. From Pearl Harbor to the occupation of Ja- pan, these volumes are an excellent study of the U.S. Marine Corps during one of its finest hours. Written with appropriate historical judgement and critical analysis, many lessons observed in these volumes are still applicable to theaters of operation throughout the Orient. These publications stand as valuable sources of information for all Marines involved in contemporary warfare and for those who have an interest in World War II and U.S. Marine Corps history. 3.

I Library of Congress Catalog Card No. 58-60002 Foreword With the recent completion of our historical monograph project, the Marine Corps historical program entered a new phase. This book is the first of a projected five-volume series covering completely, and we hope definitively, the history of Marine operations in World War II. The fifteen historical monographs published over a period of eight years have served to spotlight the high points in this broad field. The basic research which underlay their preparation will be utilized again in this project. But a monograph by its very nature aims at a limited objective, and in its concentra- tion on a single battle or campaign necessarily ignores many related subjects. All too often it has been difficult to avoid conveying the impression that the specific operation under discussion was taking place in a vacuum. Thus, while much valuable history has been written, the story as a whole remains untold. This lack the present project aims to rectify. The story of individual battles or campaigns, now isolated between the covers of separate publications, will be largely rewritten and woven together in an attempt to show events in proper relation to each other and in correct perspective to the war as a whole. In addition, new material, especially from Japanese sources, which has become available since the writing of the monographs, will be integrated into the story. Only when the broad picture is available can the significance of the Marine Corps' contribution to the final victory in the Pacific be fairly evaluated. Now a word about Volume I which sketches briefly the development of the Marine Corps' amphibious mission from its inception and then carries the story of World War II through Guadalcanal. As logistical officer of the 1st Marine Division, I was privileged to take part in this, our first effort to strike back at the Japanese. Looking rearward from the vantage point of later years when our materiel superiority was overwhelming, it is difficult to visualize those lean first months in the Pacific when there was never enough of anything, and Allied strategy of giving top priority to Europe meant that there would not be for some time to come. Thus our initial offensive quickly and richly earned the nickname \"Operation Shoestring.\" But the shoestring held during those early critical days when its holding appeared highly questionable; and when it did, the ultimate outcome of the war in the Pacific ceased to remain in doubt. R. McC. PATE GENERAL, U. 8. MARINE CORPS COMMANDANT OF THE MARINE CORPS Preface This book covers Marine Corps participation through the first precarious year of World War II, when disaster piled on disaster and there seemed no way to check Japanese aggression. Advanced bases and garrisons were iso- lated and destroyed: Guam, Wake, and the Philippines. The sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, \"the day that will live in infamy,\" seriously crippled the U. S. Pacific Fleet; yet that cripple rose to turn the tide of the entire war at Midway. Shortly thereafter the U. S. Marines launched on Guadalcanal an offensive which was destined to end only on the home islands of the Empire. The country in general, and the Marine Corps in particular, entered World War II in a better state of preparedness than had been the case in any other previous conflict. But that is a comparative term and does not merit mention in the same sentence with the degree of Japanese preparedness. What the Marine Corps did bring into the war, however, was the priceless in- gredient developed during the years of peace: the amphibious doctrines and techniques that made possible the trans-Pacific advance — and, for that matter, the invasion of North Africa and the European continent. By publishing this operational history in a durable form, it is hoped to make the Marine Corps record permanently available for the study of mili- tary personnel, the edification of the general public, and the contemplation of serious scholars of military history. This initial volume was planned and outlined by Lieutenant Colonel Harry W. Edwards, former Head of the Historical Branch, G-3 Division, Head- quarters, U. S. Marine Corps. Much of the original writing was done by Lieutenant Colonel Frank O. Hough, formerly Head of the Writing Section, Historical Branch. Three historical monographs, Lieutenant Colonel Kobert D. Heinl, Jr.'s The Defense of Wake and Marines at Midway^ and Major John L. Zimmerman's The Guadalcanal Cam-paign^ were adapted to the needs of this book by Major Verle E. Ludwig, who also contributed considerable origi- nal writing of his own. Mr. Kenneth W. Condit wrote the chapter on landing craft development and shared, with Colonel Charles W. Harrison and Major Hubard D. Kuokka, the authorship of the chapter treating the evolution of amphibious doctrine. The buildup of Pacific outpost garrisons, the opening moves of the war, and the record of Marines in the defense of the Philippines were written by Mr. Henry I. Shaw, Jr. The final editing was done by Colonel Harrison, present Head of the Historical Branch. A number of the leading participants in the actions described have com- mented on preliminary drafts of pertinent portions of this manuscript. Their VI PREFACE valuable assistance is gratefully acknowledged. Special thanks are due to those people who read and commented on the entire volume : Lieutenant General Edward A. Craig, U. S. Marine Corps, Retired ; Dr. John Miller, Office of the Chief of Military History, Department of the Army; Captain Frederick K. Loomis, U. S. Navy, Naval History Division, Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, Department of the Navy; and Colonel Heinl, who initiated the original program of monographs dealing with Marine actions in World War II. Mrs. Edna Clem Kelley and her successor in the Administrative and Pro- duction Section of the Historical Branch, Miss Kay P. Sue, ably handled the exacting duties involved in processing the volume from first drafts through final printed form. The many preliminary typescripts and the painstaking task of typing the final manuscript for the printer were done by Mrs. Miriam R. Smallwood and Mrs. Billie J. Tucker. Most of the maps were prepared by the Reproduction Section, Marine Corps Schools, Quantico, Virginia. However, we are indebted to the Office of the Chief of Military History, Department of the Army, for permission to use Maps Nos. 3, 14, 15, 20, 21, and 23-27, which were originally drafted by its Cartographic Branch.

How- ever, Marines in the modern sense date to Seventeenth Century England where, in 1664, a regiment of ground troops was raised specifically for duty with the fleet as well as ashore. This unit bore the some- what ponderous title : \"Duke of York and Albany's Maritime Regiment of Foot.\" Over a period of many decades of ex- pansion and evolution, during much of which nobody knew for certain Avhether it belonged to the Army or the Navy, this basic unit developed into the corps known today as the Royal Marines. By the time of the American Revolution, the status of the British Marines had jelled firmly. Thus, when the American Colonies revolted and began setting up their own armed services, they modeled these much along the lines of the similar components of the mother country, these being the forms with which they were most familiar and which suited them best tem- peramentally. This was true of the Con- tinental Marines and to an even greater degree of the Marine Corps, reactivated under the Constitution in 1798. In the days of wooden, sail-propelled ships the functions of the Marines became well defijied. At sea they kept order and were responsible for internal security. In combat they became the ship's small-arms fighters: sniping from the fighting tops, and on deck spearheading boarding parties in close action or repelling enemy board- ers. Ashore they guarded naval installa- tions, both at home and abroad, and upon occasion fought on land beside Army com- ponents. Amphibious-wise, they were available as trained landing parties, either to seize positions on hostile shores, or to protect the lives and property of nationals in foreign countries. Both the British and U. S. Marines have seen much such service. At the time of this writing the Marine Corps is 181 years old, according to its own reckoning, though its service has not been continuous. Marines celebrate their Corps' birthday on 10 November, this being the date in the year 1775 when the Con- tinental Congress authorized the raising of two battalions of Marines for the Con- tinental service. The scanty records ex- tant show nothing to indicate that those battalions were actually raised, but many Marines were recruited for service on board the ships of the infant Navy where they performed creditably in all the major sea actions of the Revolutionary War, staged two important amphibious land- ings in the Bahamas, and ashore partici- pated in the Trenton-Princeton campaign under General Washington. The Continental Marines, like the Navy and all but a minuscule detachment of the Army, passed out of existence following the close of the Revolutionary War. How- PEARL HARBOR TO GUADALCANAL ever, foreign pressures brought the Navy back into existence in 1798 under the re- cently adopted Constitution, and on 11 July of that year the Marine Corps was reactivated as a separate service within the naval establishment. Since that date Marines have fought in every official war the United States has had — and scores of obscure affairs that lacked official blessing but in which, to quote the eminent Marine writer, John W. Thomason, Jr., \"... a man can be killed as dead as ever a chap was in the Ar- gonne.\"^ They have served as strictly naval troops, both ashore and afloat, and participated in extended land operations under Army command, notably in the Creek- Seminole Indian Wars of the 1830's, the Mexican War, both World Wars, and in Korea. All over the world, Britian's Royal Ma- rines were seeing much the same type of service. For a century or more the courses of the two corps ran parallel, and they were as functionally alike as it is possible for any two military organizations to be. Individual members of these services had so many interests in common that, as one British writer put it, they had a tendency to \"chum up\" - when ships of the two na- tions put in to the same ports. Even the present U. S. Marine emblem (adopted in 1868) derives from that of the Royal Ma- rines; thougli at a glance they appear en- tirely different, the basic motifs of both are the fouled anchor and globe : the East- ern Hemisphere for the British, the West- ern for the U. S. Much in common existed ' Capt J. W. Thomason, Jr., Fix Bayonets! (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1955 ed.), xiv. - LtCol M. Rose, RMA, A Short History of the Royal Marities ( Deal, England : Depot Royal Marines, 1911 ) , 22. at top level, as well, and over the years the two organizations developed a very close and most cordial relationship that exists to this day, despite the strange evo- lutionary divergence that set in between them.^ The transition of navies from sail to steam began evolutionary developments which profoundly altered the nature of all shipboard duties, and temporarily threatened both corps with extinction. From this the Royal Marines emerged burdened with a miscellany of often in- congruous duties never envisioned in the old days, and considerably emasculated by lack of a single mission of overriding im- portance. That the effect on the U. S. Marines was precisely the reverse resulted from the fundamental difference in the problems facing the two nations which required U. S. Marines to carve out a spe- cial mission for themselves, though they traveled a long, uneven road in bringing this to full fruition. The basic problem that confronted the early steam navies was that of obtaining fuel. Sail-propelled men-of-war, on which all naval experience and tradition up to that time was based, could operate at sea almost indefinitely, putting in only to replenish provisions and water, readily available at nearly any port of call any- where in the world. But sufficient coal to support large-scale steamship opera- tions could be obtained only from well stocked bases, and a fleet's operating radius thus became limited by the loca- tion of such bases. If an enemy lay be- yond that radius, the fleet might as well be chained to a post so far as getting at 'LtCol R. D. Heinl, Jr., \"What Happened to the Royal Marines?,\" USNI Proceedings, Febru- ary 1949, 169. ORIGINS OF A MISSION him was concerned, unless the source of supply could be projected farther in his direction. To the British Empire, on which \"the sun never sets,\" this posed no serious prob- lem ; it had, or could build, all the bases it needed without leaving its own territory. But the United States, with few outlying possessions, had genuine cause for con- cern. In order to give the fleet signifi- cant operating range in the Pacific, the Navy in 1878 set up a coaling station in Samoa, and in 1887 the government con- cluded a treaty with Hawaii permitting the establishment of another at Pearl Harbor. But the United States had no deep- seated interest in the Far East during this era, and no serious apprehension of an at- tack from that direction. The Navy's principal concern lay in the possibility of being obliged to enforce the Monroe Doctrine in the Caribbean or South At- lantic. As early as 1880, far-sighted naval officers began turning their thoughts toward this mission. The cost of main- taining permanent bases in those areas would have been prohibitive, so the prob- lem boiled down to devising a plan for seizing advanced bases when and where strategy dictated their need and develop- ing these as quickly as possible to with- stand attack. The scattered, under- strength U. S. Army of that era could not supply sufficient trained ground troops on the short notice necessary to make such operations effective, so the Navy faced the problem of developing ground troops of its own for service with the fleet.\"* It would seem, particularly with bene- fit of today's hindsight, that the Marine Corps would be the logical choice for the development of this mission. However, this was not so apparent at the time. Ma- rines had never participated in this type of operation on anything resembling the scale envisioned, and they comprised a very small unit as compared to the blue- jackets. One school of thought con- tended that the advanced base function should be performed entirely by Navy personnel under command of naval offi- cers, in the interests of unity and other considerations.'^ The controversy, strictly on the theoretical level, waxed warm and sometimes acrimonious, giving rise at length to one of those perennial efforts to eliminate the Marines altogether.\" However, the advent of the Spanish- American War found the Navy wholly unprepared to cope with the advanced base problem. It was the Marine Corps that promptly organized an expedition- ary battalion, including its own artillery component, for the seizure of Guanta- namo Bay, Cuba, in order to enable the U. S. Fleet to operate indefinitely in the Caribbean waters. At Key West this unit underwent training in minor tactics, basic weapons, and musketry, and then landed in the target area on 10 June 1898, ten days before the first Army troops ar- rived off the coast of Cuba. There the Marines quickly secured a beachhead and successfully defended it against a nu- merically superior enemy. *E. B.

( USMC 4982) ORIGINS OF A MISSION So expeditiously and efficiently was this operation conducted that its contribution to the speedy and decisive culmination of the war would be difficult to evaluate. This also greatly strengthened tlie Ma- rine Corps' claim to the Navy's amphibi- ous mission, a claim tliat gained still fur- ther strengtli by Admiral Dewey's subse- quent statement that if a similar Marine component had served with his fleet at Manila Bay, the whole painful and pro- tracted Philippine Insurrection might have been avoided. The Spanish-American War signalized emergence of the United States as a world power. Possession of the Pliilippines caused the Navy to reappraise the whole Far East situation. The USS Charles- ton, convoying Army troops to Manila, paused en route to seize the Spanish is- land of Guam to serve as an advanced coaling station,' and annexation of Ha- waii followed shortly.^ Additional ad- vanced bases were established in the Phil- ippines themselves as soon as the situation permitted. This increasing consciousness of the Navy's widespread commitments and re- sponsibilities brought about the evolu- tionary developments which culminated in the early 1940's in the amphibious as- sault doctrines and techniques \"which fi- nally made possible what Major General J. F. C. Fuller has called 'the most far- reaching tactical innovation of [World War II].'\" « ' Seizure of Guam reiiuiied no landing force. The Spanish governor had not learned about the declaration of war and mistoolj the token naval bombardment for a courtesy salute and hurried out to the Charleston to apologize for his inabil- ity to return it for lack of ammunition. He promptly surrendered the island upon being ap- prised of the facts. \" Prior to the Spanish War, the question of the annexation of Hawaii had been under ne- gotiation off and on for many years between that government and the United States. In a treaty signed in 1875, Hawaii had been de- clared \"an American sphere of influence.\" ' Quoted in V. 8. & Sea Power, 587. CHAPTER 2 Evolution of Modern Amphibious Warfare, 1920-1941 EARLY DEVELOPMENTS The success of the Guantanamo Bay operation and the very real possibility that the United States' new position in world affairs might lead to repetitions of essentially the same situation led high- level naval strategists to become inter- ested in establishing a similar force on a permanent basis : a force capable of seiz- ing and defending advanced bases which the fleet could utilize in the prosecution of naval war in distant waters — waters con- ceivably much more distant than the Ca- ribbean. This in turn led to the setting up of a class in the fundamentals of ad- vanced base work at Newport, Rhode Island in 1901. During the winter of 1902-1903 a Marine battalion engaged in advanced base defense exercises on the is- land of Culebra in the Caribbean in con- junction with the annual maneuvers of the fleet. Expeditionary services in Cuba and Panama prevented an immedi- ate follow-uj) to this early base defense instruction, but in 1910 a permanent ad- vanced base school was organized at New London, Connecticut. A year later it was moved to Philadelphia.^ By 1913 sufficient progress had been made in advanced base instruction to per- mit the formation of a permanent ad- vanced base force. Made up of two regi- ments, one of coast artillery, mines, searchlights, engineers, communicators, and other specialists for fixed defense, and the other of infantry and field ar- tillery for mobile defense, the advanced base force totalled about 1,750 officers and men. In January of 1914 it was rein- forced by a small Marine Corps aviation detachment and joined the fleet for ma- neuvers at Culebra.^ But the analogy be- tween advanced base training and the am- phibious assault techniques that emerged in World War II is easily overdrawn. Prior to World War I the primary inter- est was in defense of a base against enemy attack. There was no serious contem- plation of large-scale landings against heavily defended areas. This all but exclusive concern for the defense of bases was clearly borne out by the writing of Major Earl H. Ellis. Ellis, one of the most brilliant young Marine staff officers, was among the farsighted military thinkers who saw the prospect of war between the United States and Japan prior to World War I. Around 1913, he directed attention to the 'J. A. Isely and P. A. Crowl, The U. 8. Ma- rines and AmphiMous War (Princeton: Prince- ton University Press, 1951), 21-22, liereinafter cited as Marines and Amphibious War. 'Annual Report of the Major General Com- mandant of the Marine Corps, 19H (Washing- ton: <5P0, 1914). Hereinafter all annual re- ports from the Office of the Commandant will be cited as CMC AnRept (year). 8 EVOLUTION OF MODERN AMPHIBIOUS WARFARE, 1920-1941 problems of a future Pacific conflict. To bring military force to bear against Japan, Ellis pointed out, the United States would have to project its fleet across the Pacific. To support these operations so far from home would re- quire a system of outlying bases. Hawaii, Guam, and the Philippines, which were the most important of these, we already possessed. Their defense would be of utmost importance and would constitute the primary mission of the Marine advanced base force. Ellis discussed in considerable detail the troops which would be required and the tactics they should employ. In addition to the bases already in the possession of the United States, Ellis foresaw the need of acquiring others held by Japan. To the Marine Corps would fall the job of assaulting the enemy-held territory. Although he did not discuss the problems involved nor take up the tactics to be employed, Ellis fore- shadowed the amphibious assault which was to be the primary mission of the Marine Corps in World War 11.^ The infant Advance Base Force was di- verted to other missions almost as soon as it was created. Hardly were the Culebra maneuvers of 1914 completed when the Marines were sent to Mexico for the seizure of Vera Cruz. The next year they went ashore in Haiti, and in 1916 unsettled con- ditions in Santo Domingo required the 'Earl H. Ellis, \"Naval Bases\" (MS, n. d.).

Ex- peditionary service in these two Caribbean republics was to constitute a heavy and continuing drain on Marine Corps re- sources which might otherwise have been devoted to advanced base activities. The expansion of the Marine Corps to about 73,000 officers and men during World War I served as a temporary stimu- lant to the Advance Base Force. In spite of the demands for manpower resulting from the sending of an expeditionary force to France, the Advance Base Force was maintained at full strength throughout the war. By the Armistice it numbered 6,297 officers and men.* UPS AND DOWNS OF THE NINETEEN TWENTIES Marines returning from overseas late in 1919 picked up where they left off three years before. At Quantico the Advance Base Force, redesignated the Expedition- ary Force in 1921, stood ready to occupy and defend an advanced base or to restore law and order in a Caribbean republic. In that year it included infantry, field artillery, signal, engineer, and chemical troops, and aircraft. A similar expedi- tionary force was planned for San Diego, but perennial personnel shortages pre- vented the stationing of more than one infantry regiment and one aircraft squad- ron there during the 1920's.^ Nothing seemed changed, but delegates of the Great Powers, meeting at Versailles to write the peace treaty ending World War I, had already taken an action which was to have far-reaching consequences for * LtCol C.

In the general distribution of spoils, the former German island possessions in the central Pacific had been mandated to the Japa- nese. At one stroke the strategic balance in the Pacific was shifted radically in favor of Japan. That country now pos- sessed a deep zone of island outposts. Fortified and supported by the Japanese fleet, they would constitute a serious ob- stacle to the advance of the United States Fleet across the Pacific. Earl Ellis was one of the first to recog- nize the significance of this strategic shift. In 1921 he modified his earlier ideas and submitted them in the form of Operations Plan 712, \"Advanced Base Operations in Micronesia.\" In this plan Ellis stressed the necessity for seizing by assault the bases needed to project the Fleet across the Pacific. He envisioned the seizure of specific islands in the Marshall, Caroline, and Palau groups, some of which were actually taken by Marines in World War II. He went so far as to designate the size and type of units that would be nec- essary, the kind of landing craft they should use, the best time of day to effect the landing, and other details needed to insure the success of the plan. Twenty years later Marine Corps action was to bear the imprint of this thinking : To effect [an amphibious landing] in the face of enemy resistance requires careful training and preparation, to say the least ; and this along Marine lines. It is not enough that the troops be skilled infantry men or artillery men of high morale ; they must be skilled water men and jungle men who know it can be done — Marines with Marine training.' The Commandant, Major General John A. Lejeune, and other high ranking Marines shared Ellis' views. \"The seizure and occupation or destruction of enemy bases is another important function of the expeditionary force,\" he stated in a lecture before the Naval War College in 1923. \"On both flanks of a fleet crossing the Pacific are numerous islands suitable for submarine and air bases. All should be mopped up as progress is made. . . . The maintenance, equipping and training of its expeditionary force so that it will be in instant readiness to support the Fleet in the event of war,\" he concluded, \"I deem to be the most important Marine Corps duty in time of peace.\" ^ The 1920s, however, were not the most favorable years for training in amphibi- ous operations. Appropriations for the armed services were slim, and the Navy, whose cooperation and support was neces- sary to carry out landing exercises, was more intent on preparing for fleet surface actions of the traditional type. Still, a limited amount of amphibious training was carried out in the first half of the decade. During the winter of 1922, a reinforced regiment of Marines participated in fleet maneuvers with the Atlantic Fleet. Their problems included the attack and defense of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and the island of Culebra. In March of the following year, a detachment of Marines took part in a landing exercise at Panama, and a battalion of Marines and sailors practiced a landing on Cape Cod that summer. Panama and Culebra both witnessed landing exercises early in 1924, with a Marine regiment participating. This set of exercises was the high point of train- \" OPlan 712, AdvBOps in Micronesia, 1921.

It marked the advent of serious experimentation with adequate landing craft for troops and equipment. However, it was most notable for the great number of mistakes made in the course of the exercises, such as inadequate attacking forces, insufficient and unsuitable boats, lack of order among the landing party, superficial naval bom- bardment, and poor judgment in the stow- age of supplies and equipment aboard the single transport used.* The last landing exercise of the era was a joint Army-Navy affair held during the spring of 1925 in Hawaiian waters. It was actually an amphibious command post exercise, undertaken at the insistence of General Lejeune to prove to skeptical Army officers that the Marine Corps could plan and execute an amphibious operation of greater than brigade size. A force of 42,000 Marines was simulated, although only 1,500 actually participated. It ran more smoothly than had the previous exercise, but still was handicapped by a lack of adequate landing craf t.^ Even this meager amphibious training came to an end after 1925. New commit- ments in Nicaragua, in China, and in the United States guarding the mails served to disperse the expeditionary forces. By 1928 the Commandant announced in his annual report that barely enough pei\"Son- nel were on hand at Quantico and San Diego to keep those bases in operation.\" ^Marines and Amphibious War, 30-32. ° BriGen Dion Williams, \"Blue Marine Corps Expeditionary Force,\" MC Gazette, September 1925, 76-88 ; LtGen M.

Whatever the shortcomings of the work in amphibious doctrine and technique dur- ing the 1920's, the Marine Corps scored a major triumph when its special interest in the field became part of the official military policy of the United States. Joint Action of the Army and Navy, a directive issued by the Joint Board of the Army and Navy in 1927, stated that the Marine Corps would provide and main- tain forces \"for land operations in support of the fleet for the initial seizure and defense of advanced bases and for such limited auxiliary land operations as are essential to the prosecution of the naval campaign.\" Further, in outlining the tasks to be performed by the Army and Navy in \"Landing Attacks Against Shore Objec- tives,\" this document firmly established the landing force role of the Marine Corps: \"Marines organized as landing forces perform the same functions as above stated for the Army, and because of the constant association with naval units will be given special training in the conduct of landing operations.\" \" ACTIVATION OF THE FLEET MARINE FORCE The recognition of a mission did not create the doctrine nor the trained forces to carry it out, and, in 1927, neither was at hand. In January 1933 the last Marine had departed from Nicaragua, and with- drawal from Haiti was contemplated. Troops were now becoming available for training in landing operations, but before any real progress could be made, one pre- liminary step was essential. A substan- tial permanent force of Marines with its \" The Joint Board, Joint Action of the Army and Navy (Washington: GPO, 1927), 3, 12. 12 PEARL HARBOR TO GUADALCANAL MARINES IN FRANCE IN WORLD WAR I, part of the 4th Marine Brigade of the 2d Infantry Division, prepare to move up to the front line trenches.

No one recognized this more clearly than the Assistant Commandant, Briga- dier General John H. Russell. He as- sembled a staff at Quantico to plan the organization of a force which could be rapidly assembled for service with the Fleet. In August of 1933 he proposed to the Commandant that the old \"Expedi- tionary Force\" be replaced by a new body, to be called either \"Fleet Marine Force,\" or \"Fleet Base Defense Force.\" The new force, while an integral part of the United States Fleet, would be under the operational control of the Fleet Com- mander when embarked on vessels of the Fleet or engaged in fleet exercises afloat or ashore. When not so embarked or en- gaged it would remain under the Major General Commandant. Russell's recommendations were promptly approved by the Commandant and by the Chief of Naval Operations. The designation \"Fleet Marine Force\" (FMF) was preferred by the senior naval staffs, and the Commandant was requested to submit proposed instructions for es- tablishing \"appropriate command and administrative relations between the com- mander in Chief and the Commander of the Fleet Marine Force.\" ^^ The decision became official with the issuance of Navy Department General Order 241, dated 8 December 1933. This directive could well be called the Magna Carta of the Fleet Marine Force. It stated: 1. The force of marines maintained by the major general commandant in a state of readi- ness for operations with the fleet is hereby designated as fleet marine force (F. M. F. ), and as such shall constitute a part of the organiza- tion of the United States Fleet and be included in the operating force plan for each fiscal year. 2. The fleet marine force shall consist of such units as may be designated by the major general commandant and shall be maintained at such, strength as is warranted by the general person- nel situation of the Marine Corps. 3. The fleet marine force shall be available to the commander in chief for operations with the fleet or for exercises either afloat or ashore in connection with fleet problems. The com- mander in chief shall make timely recommenda- tions to the Chief of Naval Operations regarding such service in order that the necessary arrange- ments may be made. 4. The commander in chief shall exercise command of the fleet marine force when em- barked on board vessels of the fleet or when en- gaged in fleet exercises, either afloat or ashore. When otherwise engaged, command shall be directed by the major generel commandant. 5. The major general commandant shall de- tail the commanding general of the fleet marine force and maintain an appropriate staff for him. 6. The commanding general, fleet marine force, shall report by letter to the commander in chief. United States Fleet, for duty in con- nection with the employment of the fleet marine force. At least once each year, and at such times as may be considered desirable by the com- mander in chief, the commanding general, fleet marine force, with appropriate members of his staff, shall be ordered to report to the com- mander in chief for conference.\" However significant the creation of the FMF may have been in terms of the fu- ture, its initial form was modest enough. The Commandant was obliged to report in August 1934 that the responsibility for maintaining ship's detachments and gar- risons abroad, and performing essential 12CN0 Itr to CMC, 12Sep33; Marines and Amphibious War, 33-34. \" Navy Dept GO 241, 8Dec33. 14 PEARL HARBOR TO GUADALCANAL guard duty at naval shore stations, pre- vented the Marine Corps from assigning the component units necessary to fulfill the mission of the FMF. At this time the total number of officers and men in the FMF was about 3,000.i* ''THE BOOK'' GOMES OUT With the creation of the FMF the Ma- rine Corps had finally acquired the tacti- cal structure necessary to carry out the primary war mission assigned to it by the Joint Board in 1927. The next order of business was to train the FMF for the execution of its mission. But the training could not be very effec- tive without a textbook embodying the theory and practice of landing operations. No such manual existed in 1933. There was a general doctrine by the Joint Board issued in 1933, and, though it offered many sound definitions and suggested general solutions to problems, it lacked necessary detail. In November 1933, all classes at the Ma- rine Corps Schools were suspended, and, under the guidance of Colonel Ellis B. Miller, Assistant Commandant of the Schools, both the faculty and students set to work to write a manual setting forth in detail the doctrines and techniques to be followed in both training and actual operations. Under the title, Tentative Manual for Landing Opera,tions^ it was issued in January 1931. On 1 August 1934, the title was changed to Manual far Naval Overseas Operations and some changes were effected in the text. A few months later this publica- tion, now retitled Tentative Landings Op- erations MamMol, was approved by the Chief of Naval Operations for \"tempo- rary use ... as a guide for forces of the Navy and the Marine Corps conduct- ing a landing against opposition.\"^' In mimeographed form it was given rela- tively limited distribution within the Navy, but wide distribution within the Marine Corps. Comments were invited. The doctrine laid down in this remark- able document was destined to become the foundation of all amphibious thinking in the United States armed forces. The Navy accepted it as official doctrine in 1938 under the title of Fleet Training Publication 167, and in 1941 the War De- partment put the Navy text between Army covers and issued it as Field Man- ual 31-6. Remarkable as it was, the Marine am- phibious doctrine was largely theory when it was first promulgated at Quantico in 1934. To put the theory into practice, major landing exercises were resumed. They were held each winter from 1935 through 1941 on the islands of Culebra and Vieques in conjunction with fleet ex- ercises in the Caribbean, or on San Clem- ente off the California coast. A final ex- ercise of the prewar period on a much larger scale than any previously at- tempted was held at the newly acquired Marine Corps base at New River, North Carolina, in the summer of 1941. These fleet landing exercises provided the prac- tical experience by which details of land- ing operations were hammered out. In light of its importance, here might be as good a place as any to consider briefly the more basic aspects of this doctrine as conceived in the original manual and mod- ' CMC AnRept, 1934. \" NavDept, Tentative Landing Operations Manual, 1935, hereinafter cited as Tentative Landing Operations Manual. EVOLUTION OF MODERN AMPHIBIOUS WARFARE, 1920-1&41 15 ified by experience in fleet exercises up to the outbreak of the war. Amphibious op- erations and ordinary ground warfare share many of the same tactical principles. The basic difference between them lies in the fact that the amphibious assault is launched from the sea, and is supported by naval elements. While water-borne the landing force is completely powerless and is dependent upon the naval elements for all its support : gunfire, aviation, transpor- tation, and communication. In this ini- tial stage only the naval elements have the capability of reacting to enemy action. As the landing force, however, is projected onto the beach, its effectiveness, starting from zero at the water's edge, increases rapidly until its strength is fully estab- lished ashore. COMMAND RELATIONSHIPS This basic difference between land and amphibious operations created a problem in command relationships which has plagued amphibious operations from earli- est times. During the initial stage when only naval elements have the capability of reacting to enemy action it has been generally and logically agreed that the over-all command must be vested in the commander of the naval attack force. It has, however, not been so generally agreed in the past that once the landing force is established ashore and capable of exert- ing its combat power with primary reliance on its own weapons and tactics that the landing force commander should be freed to conduct the operations ashore as he sees fit. The authors of the Tentative Landing Operations Manual, writing in 1934, evi- dently did not foresee that this particular aspect of command relations presented a problem that required resolution.^® They simply defined the \"attack force\" as all the forces necessary to conduct a landing op- eration and added that the attack force commander was to be the senior naval of- ficer of the fleet units making up the at- tack force. His command was to consist of the landing force and several naval com- ponents, organized as task groups for the support of the landing. These included, among others, the fire support, transport, air, screening, antisubmarine, and recon- naissance groups. The commanders of the landing force and of the several naval task groups operated on the same level under the over-all command of the attack force commander throughout the opera- tion. This initial command concept was des- tined to undergo a number of modifications and interpretations which will be discussed in this history as they occur. The first im- portant change did not come about until toward the close of the Guadalcanal cam- paign.\" NAVAL GUNFIRE SUPPORT There is nothing new in the concept of using the fire of ships' guns to cover an amphibious landing of troops during its most vulnerable phase : before, during, and after the ship-to-shore movement.

S. troops in Canada during the War of 1812 (York and Niagara Peninsula, sum- mer 1813) ; General Scott's landing at Vera Cruz in 1847 during the Mexican War; several amphibious operations dur- ing the Civil War, e. g.^ Fort Fisher in 1865; and Guantanamo Bay during the Spanish-American War in 1898. However, the evolution of modern weapons posed difficult problems of a technical nature, and the much belabored Gallipoli operation seemed to indicate that these were insoluble. High- powered naval guns, with their flat tra- jectory and specialized armor-piercing ammunition, proved no true substitute for land-based field artillery, and much study and practice would be required to develop techniques which would make them even an acceptable substitute. Nevertheless, a rudimentary doctrine concerning naval gunfire support evolved during the years between 1935 and 1941. But it evolved slowly and none too clearly. Experimentation indicated that bombardment ammunition, with its sur- face burst, was better suited to fire mis- sions against most land targets, while armor-piercing shells could be employed to good effect against concrete emplace- ments and masonry walls. The types of ships and guns best adapted to perform specific fire missions — close support, deep support, ^ counterbattery, interdiction, etc. — were determined. And some prog- ress was made in fire observation tech- nique. Three types of observeis were provided for : aerial, shipboard and, once the first waves had landed, shore fire control par- ties. For the greater part of this period the latter were made up of personnel of the firing ships, inexperienced in such work, untrained, and wholly unfamiliar with the tactical maneuvers of the troops they were supporting. Not until 1941 were trained Marine artillery officers with Marine radio crews substituted, the naval officers then serving in a liaison capacity. Other considerations of a naval nature served as further limiting factors on the NGF support concept. The necessity for the support ships to have a large propor- tion of armor-piercing projectiles readily available with which to fight a surface action on short notice restricted the ac- cessibility of and limited the amount of bombardment shells carried. In turn, the probability of enemy air and submarine action once the target area became known caused much apprehension in naval minds and dictated the earliest possible depar- ture of the firing ships from the objec- tive. An example of this apprehension at work came to the fore early in tlie Guadalcanal campaign.^* Furthermore, tradition dies hard in any service. The traditional belief that warships exist for the sole purpose of fighting other warships dates far back in history, with one of its leading exponents the great Lord Nelson with his oft-quoted dictum : \"A ship's a fool to fight a fort.\" This supposed vulnerability of surface vessels to shore-based artillery remained very much alive in the minds of naval planners. So they dictated that support ships should deliver their fires at maxi- mum range while traveling at high speed and maneuvering radically — not exactly conducive to pin-point markmanship.^\" In sum, these considerations,' tiie starting con- cept of naval gunfire support with which we '^ See Part VI, Chap 2, of this history. \"Marines and Amphibious War, 38. EVOLUTION OF MODERN AMPHIBIOUS WARFARE, 1920-1^1 17 entered World War II, added up to this : a bom- bardment of very short duration, delivered by ships firing relatively limited ammunition al- lowances of types often not well suited to the purpose, from long ranges while maneuvering at high speeds. Obviously, the best that could be expected would be area neutralization of enemy defenses during troop debarkation and the ship-to-shore movement, followed by a lim- ited amount of support on a call basis, with this, too, to be withdrawn as soon as field artillery could be landed.^\" Area neutralization — that was the basic concept, with deliberate destruction fire ruled out. A blood bath would be re- quired to expunge this from \"The Book.\" AIR SUPPORT As the Marine Corps developed the var- ious techniques contributing to a smooth landing operation, it had to give more and more consideration to the fast growth of military aviation as a powerful arm. Even the original Tentative Landing Operations Manual considered the vulner- able concentrations of troops in trans- ports, landing boats, and on the beach and called for a three-to-one numerical superiority over the enemy in the air. Later, in FTP-167^ the ratio was increased to four-to-one, primarily to wipe the enemy air threat out of the skies and secondarily to shatter the enemy's beach- head defense and to cut off his reinforce- ments. Considerable emphasis was placed, how- ever, on direct assistance to the troops themselves. This included such support- ing services as guiding the landing boats to the beach, laying smoke screens, and providing reconnaissance and spotting for ™ SM-67, Naval Ounfire in Amphibious Opera- tions (Quantico: MCEC, MCS, 195.'5), 2. naval gunfire and artillery. Most impor- tantly, it included rendering direct fire support to the landing force until the artillery was ashore and ready to fire. For this air war, employment of Ma- rine squadrons on carriers was considered ideal but, due to a limited number of car- riers, was not always a practical possibil- ity. Planners even considered moving Marine planes ashore in crates and as- sembling them, after the ground troops had seized an airfield. Hence, the Tentative Landing Opera- tions Manual called for the Navy to carry most of the initial air battle. Marine pilots, however, might be employed with Navy air units. Actually, in order to exer- cise Marine air, most of the early training landings had to be scheduled within round trip flying distance of friendly air- fields. Although by 1940 Marine carrier training operations were becoming rou- tine, the heavy reliance upon Navy car- rier air over Marine landings lasted throughout the war. As noted before, close coordination of air with ground received great emphasis in the Marine Corps. Even in Santo Domingo and Haiti and later in Nicara- gua, Marine pilots reconnoitered, strafed, and bombed insurgent positions, dropped supplies to patrols, and evacuated wounded. The Tentative Landing Oper- ations Manual incorporated this team- work into its new amphibious doctrine, and the landing exercises of the late SO's developed aviation fire power as an im- portant close ground support weapon. By 1939, Colonel Roy S. Geiger advocated and other Marine Corps leaders conceded that one of the greatest potentials of Marine aviation lay in this \"close air support.\" The challenge became that of applying the fire power of Marine air, when needed, 18 PEARL HARBOR TO GUADALCANAL to destroy a specific enemy front line posi- tion without endangering nearby friendly troops. Refinement of this skilled technique as we know it today was slow because of many factors. There was so much for pilots to learn about rapidly developing military aviation that close air support had to take its place in the busy training syllabus after such basic drill as aerial tactics, air to air gunnery, strafing, bomb- ing, navigation, carrier landings, and communications, and constant study of the latest in engineering, aerodynamics, and flight safety. Also, whenever newer, faster, and higher flying airplanes trickled into the Marine Corps in the lean thirties, they were found to be less adaptable for close coordination with ground troops than the slower, open cockpit planes which sup- ported the patrol actions of Nicaragua. In Nicaragua the aviator in his open cockpit could idle his throttle so as to locate an enemy machine gun by its sound, but in the maneuvers of 1940 pilots flash- ing by in their enclosed cockpits found it difficult to see what was going on below or even to differentiate between friendly and \"enemy\" hills.^^ In Nicaragua, the Marine flier was most often an ex-infan- tryman, but 10 years later many of the new Navy-trained Marine aviators were fresh from college and knew little about ground tactics. The lack of a real enemy to look for, identify, and to shoot at hin- dered attempts at precision, especially since air-ground radio was not yet as re- liable as the old slow but sure system where pilots read code messages from cloth panels laid on the ground or swooped down with weighted lines to snatch messages suspended between two poles. The main key to development of close air support lay in reliable communications to permit quick liaison and complete un- derstanding between the pilot and the front line commander. Part of the solu- tion lay in more exercises in air-ground coordination with emphasis on standard- ized and simplied air-ground communica- tions and maps. By 1939 an aviator as an air liaison officer was assigned to the 1st Marine Brigade Staff. While both artil- lery and naval gunfire, however, employed forward observers at front line positions, air support control was still being chan- neled slowly through regimental and bri- gade command posts.^^ In the same year one squadron sent up an air liaison officer in the rear seat of a scouting or bombing plane to keep abreast of the ground situa- tion and to direct fighter or dive bomber pilots onto targets by means of radio.^' This was better but not best. Meanwhile, war flamed up in Europe. Navy and Marine planners took note as the Germans drove around the Maginot line with their special air-ground \"ar- mored packets\" in which aviation teamed up with the fast, mobile ground elements to break up resistance.\" By this time the Marines were working on the idea of plac- \"' From Culebra came the report, ''1st MAG as a whole performed in a creditable manner, al- though at one stage they were impartial in their attacks.\" 1st MarBrig Flex 6 Rept, .\"Notes from Critique for Makee Learn Problem at Culebra, 14-15Feb40.\" ^ LtGen Julian C.

But the Leathernecks were al- ready in the war before the first standard- ized Navy-Marine Corps instructions on their employment appeared.^^ Also at that time, on Guadalcanal certain infan- try officers were given additional duty as regimental \"air forward observers.\" They were coached on the spot by aviators of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing.^® THE SHIP-TO-SHORE MOVEMENT The ship-to-shore movement was vis- ualized by the Tentative Landing Opera- tions Manual in a manner which resem- bled closely a conventional attack in land warfare: artillery preparation, approach march, deployment, and assault by the in- fantry. It stressed that this movement was no simple ferrying operation but a vital and integral part of the attack itself and demanded a high order of tactical knowledge and skill. The two major problems in the ship-to- shore movement are the speedy debarka- tion of the assaulting troops and their equipment into the landing boats and the control and guiding of these craft to their assigned beaches. To facilitate the first, the Tentative Landing Operations Man- ual directed that each transport on which combat units were embarked should carry as a minimum sufficient boats to land a reinforced infantry battalion.^^ Thus \" USN, CSP-1536, 5Sep42. \"\" 1st MarDiv, Final Report on Guadalcanal Operation, ljul43. Phase V, Annex D, OPlan 2-42, 5. The directive on appointing air forward ob- servers was dated 20ct42. \" This general concept that troops and their landing craft should be transported together to the objective area remained valid through- each transport and its accompanying troops would be tactically self-sufficient for the assault landing, and the loss of one ship would not be a crippling blow. To expedite their debarkation the Marines generally went over the side via cargo nets rigged at several stations on the ship. To solve the second major problem in the ship-to-shore movement, that of con- trolling and guiding the landing craft to their proper beaches, the Tentative Land- ing Operations Manual provided for: (1) marking the line of departure with buoys or picket boats; (2) a designated control vessel to lead each boat group from the rendezvous area to the line of departure, towing the boats in fog, smoke, or dark- ness, if necessary; (3) wave and alternate wave guide boats; (4) each boat to carry a signboard with its assigned letter and number indicating its proper position in the formation; and (5) for a guide plane to lead the boat waves in. The system for the control of the ship- to-shore movement was still substan- tially the same as prescribed in the Ten- tative Landing Operations Manual when the Marines made their first amphibious landing of World War II at Guadalcanal on 7 August 1942. COMBAT UNIT LOADING \"Combat unit loading\" of transports is the key to amphibious logistics as devel- oped by the Marine Corps. This is a prac- tical process designed to make supplies and equipment immediately available to the assault troops in the order needed, dis- regarding to a large extent the waste of cargo space which results. In contrast is commercial loading which is equally out the war, although at times it was necessary to deviate from it. 20 PEARL HARBOR TO GUADALCANAL practical in utilizing every cubic foot of cargo space available but prevents access to much of the cargo until the ship is unloaded. Highest priority items for combat unit loading vary somewhat with the nature and problems of a particular operation. Relative priorities must be worked out with minute care. The responsibility for handling this was given to a Marine offi- cer designated transport quartermaster (TQM) aboard each amphibious assault ship. He had to know not only the weight and dimensions of each item of Marine gear carried but had to familiarize himself with the characteristics of the particular ship to which he was assigned : exact loca- tion and dimensions of all holds and stor- age spaces in terms of both cubic feet and deck space. This familiarity required at times accurate remeasurement of holds and loading spaces as modifications, not shown in the ship's plans, had often been made in the ship's internal structure. Ini- tially, the Tentative Landing Operations Manual directed that the TQM should be an officer of the unit embarked, but such were the variations in ships that it subse- quently proved more feasible to assign a Marine officer, thoroughly familiar with Marine gear, permanently to a paiticular ship with which he would become equally familiar through experience. Practical experience with combat load- ing between 193\"5 and 1941 generally con- firmed the soundness of the doctrines set forth in the Tentative Landing Opera- tions Manual. Application of these doc- trines in the fleet landing exercises was limited, however, by several factors, chiefly the lack of suitable transports. In addition, an uncertainty at times as to ports of embarkation and dates of avail- ability of ships sometimes entangled plan- ning procedures. As a result, there was no ideal approximation of wartime com- bat loading. SHORE PARTY One of the most serious problems en- countered in early landing exercises was congestion on the beaches as men and sup- plies piled ashore. To keep such a situa- tion reasonably in hand requires a high degree of control; control difficult to achieve under such circumstances, even when the enemy remains only simulated. Assault troops must push inland with all speed not only to expand the beachhead, but also to make room for following units and equipment to land and to provide space in which personnel assigned strictly beach functions can operate. To solve this problem the Tentative Landing Operations Manual provided for a beach party, commanded by a naval officer called a beachmaster, and a shore party, a special task organization, com- manded by an officer of the landing force. The beach party was assigned primarily naval functions, e. g.^ reconnaissance and marking of beaches, marking of hazards to navigation, control of boats, evacuation of casualties, and, in addition, the unload- ing of material of the landing force from the boats. The shore party was assigned such functions as control of stragglers and prisoners, selecting and marking of routes inland, movement of supplies and equipment off the beaches, and assignment of storage and bivouac areas in the vicin- ity of the beach. The composition and strength of the shore party were not set forth except for a statement that it would contain detachments from some or all of the following landing force units: medi- cal, supply, working details, engineers, EVOLUTION OF MODERN AMPHIBIOUS WARFARE, 1920-lMl 21 military police, communications, and chemical. The beach party and the shore party were independent of each other, but the Tentative Landing Operations Man- ual enjoined that the fullest cooperation be observed between the beachmaster and the shore party commander, and the per- sonnel of their respective parties. It was not indicated from what source \"working details\" for the shore party would come, but in practice, since there was no other source, the policy of as- signing units in reserve the responsibility for furnishing the labor details quickly developed. This in effect, however, tem- porarily deprived the commander of his reserve. No realistic test of the shore and beach party doctrine took place during the early fleet landing exercises. Although some material was landed on the beach, it gen- erally consisted of rations and small quan- tities of ammunition and gasoline. Not until 1941 were adequate supplies avail- able and the maneuvers on a large enough scale to provide a test of logistic proce- dures. The results were not encouraging. \"In January of 1941 . . . the shore party for a brigade size landing . . . consisted of one elderly major and two small piles of ammunition boxes,\" wrote a Marine of- ficer who \"suffered\" through those years. \"The ship-to-shore movement of fuel was a nightmare. We had no force level transportation, [no! engineers and no sup- porting maintenance capability worthy of the name. In short, the combination of the parsimonious years and our own apathy had left us next to helpless where logistics were concerned.\" ^® Major General H. M. Smith, the land- ing force commander at the New River exercise in the summer of 1941, reported that \"considerable delay in the debarka- tion of troops and supplies was caused by lack of personnel in the Shore and Beach Parties .... Roughly, the supplies ex- cept for subsistence it was possible to land . . . were insufficient to sustain the forces engaged for more than three days.\" 3° General Smith, who had a deep respect for logistics, was determined to correct these deficiencies. \"It is evident,\" he re- ported to Rear Admiral Ernest J. King, Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet, \"that special service troops (labor) must be provided for these duties in order to prevent reduction of the fighting strength of battalion combat teams .... The present doctrine results in divided author- ity between shore party commanders.\" He i-ecommended that \"the beach and shore party commanders be consolidated into one unit, a Shore Party, under con- trol of the landing force.\" ^^ Solution to the problem of divided au- thority came from a joint board of Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard officers appointed by Admiral King. Its recommendations closely followed those of General Smith and were accepted in toto and published on 1 August 1942 as Change 2 to FTP 167. The principal changes were: (1) joining together of the beach and shore parties under the title Shore Party, as a component of the land- ing force; (2) designating the beach party commander as the assistant to the shore party commander and his advisor on \"BriGen V.

At Guadalcanal this lack came close to having serious consequences.^* General Smith was not content merely to submit his shore party recommenda- tions to Admiral King.

Issued as Force General Order No. 7-42, SOP for Supply and Evacuation, it served as the basic guide to combat loading and shore party operations during the Guadalcanal operation.^^ By 7 December 1941 the Marine Corps had made long strides towards amphib- ious preparedness. It had a doctrine which had been tested in maneuvers and found to be basically sound. Many of the errors in implementation had been recognized and corrected ; still others were awaiting remedial action when war broke out. But the simulated conditions of the maneuver ground were now to be aban- doned. The Marines and their doctrine were now to submit to the ultimate test of war. 'Krulak, op. cit.; Twining, op. cit. CHAPTER 3 Development of Landing Craft INTRODUCTION The amphibious warfare doctrine la- boriously developed by Marines between the two World Wars could never have been successfully executed without special equipment to transport the assaulting troops and their supplies from ship to shore and to land them on an enemy- defended beach. No one was more aware of the need for such equipment than the Marines. Shortly after the end of World War I they induced the Navy to undertake de- sign studies on two landing craft, one for personnel and one for materiel. Troop Barge A, as the first of these types was called, was tried out at Culebra in the winter of 1923-24. A shallow draft, twin-engined, 50-foot craft with a rated speed of about 12 knots and a carrying capacity of 110 fully equipped Marines, it had good beaching qualities and could retract from the beach with aid of a stern anchor. Three years later the second type, a 45-foot artillery lighter, was built and tested. Equipped with two parallel hinged ramps in the stern, it could be beached successfully stern-to and 155mm guns and other pieces of heavy Marine equipment unloaded. It lacked a power plant, however, and had to be towed by another craft.^ 'LtGen K. E. Rockey Itr to ACofS, G-3, 21Jun57; 2dLt W. B. Trundle rept on experi- ments with Beetle Boat to CG, INIarCorExpedFor, 3Mar24; Senior Member, BoatCom Itr to Pres, Another item of equipment tried out in 1924 was the Christie \"amphibian tank.\" Afloat, this unusual machine was driven by twin-screw pi'opellers at a rated speed of seven knots. On short, as a tractor, it could make 15 mph ; or, where good roads were available, the demountable tracks could be removed, and on wheels it could do 35 mph. It functioned well enough on land and in the sheltered waters of rivers. But in the open sea, under conditions that must be realistically anticipated for an as- sault landing, it proved so unseaworthy that the Marine Corps directed its atten- tion to other types. The construction of these types of amphibious equipment constituted a be- ginning, however humble, towards the solution of the problem of transporting troops and equipment from ship to shore. But a shortage of funds made it impossible to follow up these developments until 1935, when appropriations became more plentiful as a result of the naval expan- sion program begun in the first Roosevelt administration. LANDING BOATS With the publication of the Tentative Landing Operations Manual in 1934 and the resumption of landing exercises the following year, work on the landing craft MCEB, 21Jul36, both in War Plans See HQMC files, folder \"Landing Boats and Barges, 1924- 1939,\" hereinafter cited as War Plans Files, 1924-39. 23 24 PEARL HARBOR TO GUADALCANAL was resumed. Three types of boats for landing operations were contemplated by Marine planners of the mid-thirties. These included fast, small, surf boats to lift the leading waves; standard Navy boats and life boats of merchant vessels for the bulk of troops; and barges and lighters for heavy material. - Steps to solve the first problem, pro- vision of special troop landing boats, were initiated in 1935. The Marine and Navy officers who tackled the problem that year had to start pretty much from scratch, for Troop Barge A, a promising early develop- ment, fell victim to the size and weight re- strictions imposed by naval ships in those days. Navy thinking and planning for the development of amphibious equipment was restricted by the types of ships then serving the fleet. Troop transports were practically nonexistent, so it was planned as an emergency measure to lift Marine landing forces in battleships and cruisers. A length of 30 feet, the size of davits on these ships, and a weight of five tons which was the maximum capacity of the davits, were therefore imposed as basic require- ments for all new landing craft. In an effort to explore the suitability of existing commercial craft for landing op- erations, the Navy, at the request of the Marine Corps, agreed to test as wide a variety of small craft from the yards of private builders as the limited funds avail- able would permit. Bids were advertised, and nine replies were received, four of which met with the approval of the Ma- rine Corps Equipment Board and were accepted.^ ' CMC to Chief BuC&R, 24Nov36, 2d endorse- ment to ComlnCh Itr to CNO, 140ct36. War Plans Files, 1924-39. ^Ibid. Tests of these approved types were con- ducted at Cape May, New Jersey, in the summer of 1936. But the experiments fell short of the original intention, \"to test as wide a variety of forms as was practicable,'' because Andrew Higgins, a New Orleans boat builder with a promising design, de- clined to submit a bid. In 1926 Higgins had designed a special shallow draft craft called the Eureka for the use of trappers and oil drillers along the lower Mississippi and Gulf coast. It had a tunnel stern to protect the propeller and a special type of bow, called by Higgins a \"spoonbill,\" which enabled it to run well up on low banks and beaches and retract easily. In 1934 the inventor had visited Quantico to interest Marines in his boat, and the Navy was now particularly anxious to test it with other comparable types of small craft.* The four boats which showed up at Cape May for the test were of two general types. The sea skiff, a boat employed by Atlantic coast fishermen, was represented by the Bay Head, Red Bank, and Freeport boats. This type appeared in theory to offer a so- lution to the landing craft problem, as it was normally launched and landed through the heavy surf of the Atlantic beaches in fishery work. The other boat, a sea sled built by the Greenport Basin and Construction Company, was a high speed craft not normally employed in surf nor landed on beaches. The test board, com- prising representatives of the Navy gen- eral line. Bureau of Construction and Re- pair, Bureau of Engineering, the Coast Guard, and the Marine Corps, reported that none of the boats were wholly satis- factory. They eliminated the sea sled en- ' Asst Chief BuC&R Itr to Higgins Industries, 210ct36, S82-3 (15) BuShips files.

These tests took place at Culebra during Flex 4 in the winter of 1938. Though superior in speed and beaching ability to standard Navy boats, the modified fishing craft still had serious drawbacks. Owing to their exposed rudders and propellers 26 PEARL HARBOR TO GUADALCANAL they tended to dig in when retracting. They were so high forward that Marines debarking had to drop 10 feet from the bow to the beach. They were, moreover, all unsuitable for lowering and hoisting.® In the light of the drawbacks revealed by tests, the Bureau of Construction and Repair undertook the construction of a boat embodying all the best features of the fishing craf t.^ This was the beginning of a long and unsuccessful effort by the Bu- reau to develop a satisfactory landing craft. The \"Bureau Boat\" in various forms showed up regularly at Fleet Land- ing Exercises from 1939 through 1941, but efforts to get the \"bugs\" out of its design were abandoned in 1940. Experiments with standard Navy ships' boats proceeded simultaneously with the development of special types. From the first they proved unsatisfactory. After five of them foundered in a four-foot surf at San Clemente during Flex 3, efforts to adapt standard Navy boats for beach landings were abandoned. The fact was that, having been designed for other pur- poses, none of them were suitable for beaching operations. As the Command- ing Officer of the 5th Marines concluded : \"Navy standard boats are totally unsuited for landing troops of the leading waves, even under moderate surf conditions. They are in no sense tactical vehicles, lacking in speed and maneuverability and are extremely difficult to handle in surf. \" CG 1st MarBrig Flex 4 Rept, 12Mar38 ; BriGen V. H.

They do not permit the rapid debarkation of troops at the water's edge.\" * By 1938 a beginning had been made towards the solution of the landing craft problem. As a result of the early experi- ments the Marines had proved to their own satisfaction what they had suspected all along — that none of the standard Navy boats could be adapted satisfactorily for the landing through surf of troops or heavy equipment. Nor were the experi- mental models based on commercial craft, though superior to Navy boats, a satis- factory means for landing of assault waves on a defended beach. These results, though negative in character, at least cleared the way for concentrating develop- ment on specially designed landing craft. The fruitful line of development came into view with the re-entrance of Andrew Higgins into the picture. In October 1936, about a year after declining to bid on the experimental landing boat contract, Higgins had written the Navy offering his Eureka as a troop landing craft. As funds for the purchase of experimental boats had been exhausted, the Navy was unable to purchase the Higgins craft at that time.^ A year later Commander Ralph S. McDowell, Avho was responsible for land- ing craft development in the Bureau of Construction and Repair, learned of the Eureka boat. He wrote Higgins inviting him to visit the Navy Department and discuss this boat if he ever came to Wash- ington.

DEVELOPMENT OF LANDING CRAFT 27 caught the first train for Washington. They spent about a week in McDowell's office working out a conversion of the standard Eurelca into a landing craft. As funds for the purchase of experimental boats had been exhausted, the Navy De- partment at first refused to purchase the Higgins craft. But after the inventor offered to build a boat for less than cost, the Department relented, found the neces- sary funds, and gave Higgins a contract for one boat. Higgins delivered it to Nor- folk in 30 days.'\" The Eureka was tested in surf at Hampton Eoads in the spring of 1938 \" and made its first maneuver appearance at Flex 5 in 1939 where it competed against several Bureau boats and the by now venerable fishing craft. Marines were en- thusiastic about its performance. \"The Higgins boat gave the best performance under all conditions.

Daggett's preference was for a modified Bureau boat built by the Welin Company. The other Bureau types and the fishing- boats he found unsatisfactory, and as the Marine Corps and the Bureau were in agreement, on this point at least, these craft were discarded. Neither the Marine Corps nor the Bu- reau of Construction and Repair was to have tlie last word at Flex 5. The Com- mander Atlantic Squadron, as represented by his Landing Boat Development Board, recommended further tests for the Bureau and Eureka craft. Accordingly at Flex 6 the following year the drama was re- enacted. Again the Marines declared the Eureka to be \"the best so far designed.\" The Atlantic Squadron, shifting slightly from dead center, decided that the Hig- gins \"was the best all-around boat for the purpose intended . . . [but] the Bureau was almost as good.\" \" By 1940 money for naval purposes was beginning to be more plentiful, and the Navy was now willing to purchase landing \" LCdr R. B.

But in view of the fact that the Fleet was unable to make a clear-cut recommendation for either the Bureau or Higgins types, the Navy let contracts for the first 64 landing craft on a fifty-fifty basis.\" The question was finally settled in Sep- tember 1940. The Navy was now con- verting large merchant ships for use as troop transports. These ships were equipped with davits capable of handling 36-foot boats, and as the Eureka of 36- foot length had twice the capacity of the 30-footer then in service and could make the same speed without an increase in horsepower, the Navy decided to adopt the larger as standard.^*' After five years of work the Marines finally had the landing craft they wanted. The one featui-e that kept the Higgins boat from fulfilling the ideal that they had built uj) in their minds was the diffi- culty of emptying it on the beach : all troops, equipment, and supplies had to be unloaded over the fairly high sides. Dur- ing a visit to Quantico in April 1941, Higgins was shown a picture of a Japa- nese landing craft with a ramp in the bow by Major Ernest E. Linsert. Higgins be- came enthusiastic about the idea and re- turned to New Orleans determined to ex- amine the possibility of installing a ramp in the bow of his 36-foot Eureka. Lin- sert, who was serving as Secretary, Ma- rine Corps Equipment Board, recom- mended to the President of the Board, Brigadiet General Emile P. Moses, that the Marine Corps procure a ramp-bow 36-foot Eureka. Upon receiving the ap- proval of Marine Corps Headquarters, Moses and Linsert went to New Orleans to assist Higgins, who had agreed to make a prototype, converting a standard 36- foot Eureka into a ramp-bow boat at his own expense. On 21 May, informal tests were con- ducted on Lake Pontchartrain. The new- craft proved to be seaworthy. She beached and retracted with ease, and while on the beach the ramp was lowered and personnel and a light truck were de- barked and reembarked. On the recom- mendation of the Navy Department Con- tinuing Board for the Development of Landing Boats,\" a special board of Ma- rine Corps and Bureau of Ships officers was appointed to conduct official accep- tance tests. With General Moses as sen- ior member the board carried out the tests during the first week in June. The ramp- bow craft passed with flying colors.\" Thus was born the precursor of the LCVP (landing craft vehicle, personnel), the craft which, in the opinion of Gen- eral H. M. Smith, '' . . . did more to win the war in the Pacific than any other single piece of equipment.'' \" ^ DeptContBd for Dev of Landing Boats Rept to CNO, 18May40, and BuShips Itr to Cdt 5th Naval Dist, 8Jul40, both C-S82-3(15) BuShips files.

DEVELOPMENT OF LANDING CRAFT 29 LIGHTERS AND BARGES The design of a successful tank lighter proved a longer and more difficult process than did the development of the person- nel landing craft. The old 45- foot ar- tillery lighter, developed in 1927, was considered to have a limited usefulness for landing heavy equipment in the later stages of an operation, but the Marine Corps hoped to obtain a lighter, self-pro- pelled craft particularly suited to landing tanks during the early stages.™ As a stop-gap measure. Marines at Quantico came up with a device to adapt the standard Navy 50-foot motor launch for landing light vehicles and artillery. \"Boat Rig A,\" this contraption was called. It consisted of a platform fitted within the hull of the boat, together with a port- able ramp by means of Which the vehicle could go ashore over the bow when the craft beached. The ramp was carried into the beach broken down, where it was assembled and hitched up for debarkation. This completed, it would be disengaged and left on the beach to accommodate the next boat coming in. The ramp could be assembled and made ready for use by eight men in about 10 minutes. On sub- sequent trips, it took about four minutes to connect the ramp to the boat. Under ideal conditions vehicles up to five tons in weight could be landed from a 50-foot motor launch using Boat Rig A. In calm water Boat Rig A worked fairly well, but when it was tried out at Culebra in 1935, it proved so top heavy that it nearly cap- sized in a moderate swell. The experi- ment was accordingly written off.\" With the failure of Boat Rig A, the Marine Corps turned its attention to de- veloping a self-propelled lighter designed specifically for landing tanks and heavy equipment through the sut-f. In Decem- ber 1935 the Commandant requested the Bureau of Construction and Repair to design such a craft. It was to be capable of landing the 9,500-pound Marmon- Herrington tank which the Marine Corps was then considering. Negotiations dragged on for more than a year, until in April both the Marine Corps and the Bureau had agreed upon a design. A 38-foot craft, it made its first appearance at a fleet landing exercise in 1938.^^ The Marines reported it to be \"a distinct improvement over previous experimental designs. It is self-propelled, has suffi- cient speed, and is sound and practicable in construction. It is equally adaptable for landing artillery and is an efficient cargo carrier.\" ^^ A 40-footer, built at the Norfolk Navy Yard in the autumn of 1938, showed up at Culebra the following winter for Flex 5. It was used successfully in transporting ashore tanks and trucks of the types then standard in the Marine Corps. Under the conditions encountered at Culebra in 1939, both the 38- and 40-foot lighters were judged to be \". . . good sea boats, handle well, have sufficient power and speed, and are capable of retracting themselves from the beach by use of their stern anchors. . . . Both types . . . proved suitable for landing tanks and motor vehicles. The new '\" CMC to Chief BuC&R, 24Nov36, 2d endorse- ment to Cominch Itr to CNO, 140ct36, War Plans Files, 1924-39.

This vehicle, adopted by the Marine Corps in 1935, had been designed to fit within the weight limitations imposed by the Navy for amphibious equipment. Light- ness was just about the only virtue pos- sessed by this tank. By 1939 the Marine Corps had given up on it and was testing the Army light tank for its suitability in amphibious operations. As the Army tank weighed about 15 tons, it could not be carried in any of the tank lighters then in existence. The Navy accordingly pro- duced a new model 45-feet in length, capa- ble of carrying one Army and two Mar- mon-Herrington tanks.^^ One of the new 45-f ooters was completed in time for a trial at Culebra during the winter of 1940 in Flex 6. The tests lacked somewhat in realism, however, because none of the Army-type tanks were avail- able. The new lighter performed ade- quately as a carrier of the Marmon- Herrington tank, for other vehicles, and miscellaneous heavy equipment. At the end of Flex 6, General Smith recom- mended to the Commandant that \". . . . 20 of the 45-foot lighters be constructed, at the earliest practicable date, for use by the Atlantic Squadron in landing opera- tions.\" ^^ In the fall of 1940 the Navy contracted for the construction of 96 45 -foot tank lighters. After the contract had been awarded, doubt arose as to the seaworthi- ness of the basic design. During a land- ing exercise in the Caribbean, one of the 45-footers capsized and sank when the Army-type tank it was carrying shifted to one side in a moderate sea.^^ In the spring of 1941 the Marine Corps found itself in urgent need of all the lighters it could lay its hands on for use in a proposed amphibious landing in the Azores.^* None of the 96 lighters ordered by the Navy had been delivered, and not more than eight or ten were expected in time for the operation. Therefore, on 27 May 1941 the Navy Department Con- tinuing Board for the Development of Landing Boats recommended that Hig- gins be given an opportunity to convert one of his 45 -foot Eureka boats into a tank lighter by installing a ramp in the bow. If this craft met service tests he would be awarded a contract for 50 tank lighters. The Secretary of the Navy gave his approval on 29 May, and Higgins re- ceived this order by telephone the next day.^ Higgins rushed through the conversion, completing it in time for testing and ac- ceptance during the first week in June by the same board of Marine Corps and Bu- \" CO 1/5 Flex 5 Rept No 14 to CG 1st Mar- Brig, 15Mar39. \"^ BuC&R Itr to Cdt Norfolk Navy Yard, 6Jul39, War Plans Files, 19J,0-U.

DEVELOPMENT OF LANDING CRAFT 31 reau of Ships officers who had come to New Orleans to test the 36-foot ramp-bow Eureka. At the New River exercises that summer the Higgins tank lighters proved to be of excellent basic design. \"They were found to be fast, subject to ready control and retraction, relatively light, and equipped with a reliable power plant,\" reported General Smith.^\" They also proved to be too hastily constructed. The ramps were so weak that several col- lapsed, and the sill was too high for effi- cient handling of vehicles. Higgins, who was present, was confident that he could correct the deficiences.^^ Before the reports of the New River exercises had been received by the Navy Department, a contract had been let for 131 additional tank lighters. These were of a 47-foot Bureau design, a prototype of which had never been built. As a re- sult of the good showing of the Higgins tank lighter at New River, this contract Avas later reduced to ten. Higgins was the low bidder, and built one craft to Bureau specifications, although he was convinced that the design was unseaworthy. His fears proved to be well founded when the tests were carried out. By this time, how- ever, the tank lighter program had again changed direction.^^ On 4 October 1941, the Auxiliary Ves- sels Board of the Navy had reported that there was no lighter capable of landing the newly developed Army 30-ton medium tank. The Secretary of the Navy directed '\"CG PhibLant Itr to CinCLant, 9Sep41, FMFLant files. \"'CNO Itr to CMC et al, 2 Jun41, . 2455-130-60 HQMC files; Daggett Intervieiv; Linsert Inter- view; CinCLant Itr to CNO, 70ct41, FMFLant files. ^Senate 10, 139-140. the Bureau of Ships to remedy this defi- ciency. Accordingly, in December exist- ing tank lighter contracts were changed to provide 50- footers in lieu of the 45-foot Higgins and 47-foot Bureau types still to be built. Both Higgins and the Bureau produced designs of 50-foot craft. Before any deliveries could be made. President Roosevelt, at a White House Conference on 4 April 1942, directed the procurement of 600 additional 50-foot tank lighters by 1 September for the North African op- eration. The Bureau of Ships, to meet this commitment, ordered 1,100 of its own design.^^ Since this order was earmarked for serv- ice in a projected Army operation, the Army showed keen interest in a test of the two types held near Norfolk on 25 April 1942. Each carried a 30-ton tank, elabo- rately lashed down in the Bureau lighter, merely blocked in place in the Higgins. Wind velocity ran 18 to 23 miles per hour, with wave heights estimated between li/^ and 2 feet. Both lighters showed a speed of 10 miles an hour over a measured li/^- mile course. What happened after that is described by the Army observer who made the trip in the Higgins type : As we neared the [antisubmarine] net it be- came apparent that the Navy Bureau-type tank lighter was in trouble. She appeared to have a tendency to dive when headed into the seas and was taking considerable water aboard. She stopped several times and members of the crew could be seen manning hand pumps and attempt- ing to better secure the tank in the lighter. Once when under way and making a wide turn, it ap- peared that the lighter was going to overturn. Some of the crew was seen straddling the higher bulwark and the coxswain had left the pilot house and was steering the vessel from the rail. While this was going on, our [Higgins] lighter was standing by, as was a picket boat and two Ibid., 157. 32 PEARL HARBOR TO GUADALCANAL Higgins 36-foot boats. None of these vessels was experiencing any difficulty. The Higgins tank lighter was maneuvering around in sharp turns into the sea, through the wave troughs. We then [after Bureau lighter turned back] opened the engines up to 1,900 r. p. m. and pro- ceeded past Little Creek to Fort Storey. The lighter took no water except a little spray. Per- formance was excellent in all respects. The lighter was beached in the surf and the tank ran off onto the beach despite poor handling by the coxswain who finally allowed the lighter to broach to. In spite of this the vessel had such power and retraction qualities [as] to get back into deep water. As far as comparison of characteristics of the types of tank lighters are concerned, it may be stated that in the May 25 tests there was no comx>arison. . . .\" As a result of these tests, the Bureau hastily notified all yards to shift to the Higgins type. Thus the Higgins 50-f ooter became the standard tank lighter of the Navy, the prototype of the LCM (landing craft, mechanized) as the Marines knew it in World War II, and as they know it to- day in enlarged form. AMPHIBIOUS VEHICLES Another vehicle which was to play a vital role in the amphibious operations of World War II was the amphibian tractor (amtrack, LVT) . It was built in 1935 by Donald Roebling, a wealthy young in- ventor living in Clearwater, Florida. The \"Alligator,\" as Roebling called his cre- ation, was a track-laying vehicle which derived its propulsion afloat from flanges fixed to the tracks, essentially the prin- ciple of early paddle-wheel steamships. Originally intended as a vehicle of mercy, for rescue work in the Everglades, the \"Al- ligator\" was destined for fame as an in- strument of war. The Marine "
