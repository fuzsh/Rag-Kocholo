This document provides a history of Quantico Marine Corps Base in Virginia from its earliest origins to the present day. It describes how the area along the Potomac River was originally inhabited by the Manahoac Native American tribe who lived off fishing and farming. During the colonial period, the area saw conflict during the French and Indian War and the Revolutionary War. In 1917, the Marine Corps established its first permanent facilities at Quantico, marking the beginning of its role as a center for education and training. Since then, Quantico has grown significantly and taken on additional responsibilities to support the Marine Corps.",
