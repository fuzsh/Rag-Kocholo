They had to react\n\nquickly to the Communist agression to prevent being pushed off\n\nthe penisula and they had to infuse more UN forces into the fight.\n\nOne of the first UN forces sent to Korea was the hastily-\n\norganized 1st Provisional Marine Brigade, a regimental combat team\n\nconsisting of the 5th Marine Regiment and Marine Air Group - 33.\n\nAs the air component of the Marine Brigade, MAG-33 provided\n\nair support for the ground Marines and for other UN forces, as\n\nneeded. While the Brigade was being rushed about the Pusan Per-\n\nimeter plugging up gaps in the UN defenses, the Corsairs of MAG-33\n\noften provided the combat strength required to win the battles.\n\nMAG-33 pilots delivered accurate and highly effective close air\n\nsupport in early Korean battles known as Chindong-ni, Kosong, and\n\nthe 1st and 2nd Battles of the Naktong Bulge.\n\nWithin four months of the outbreak of hostilities, 1st Marine\n\nDivision and 1st Marine Air Wing arrived in Korea, just in time to\n\nparticipate in the Inchon amphibious assault. At this battle also,\n\nMarine air played a pivotal role in the outcome of the assault.\n\nAfter the Inchon invasion initiated the retreat of the North\n\nKorean forces, the Marines were ordered north above the 38th Par-\n\nallel to help encircle and destroy the North Korean forces. Just\n\nwhen North Korea appeared defeated, the Chinese Communists entered\n\nthe fight and surrounded the 1st Marine Division. 1st MAW Corsairs,\n\nonce more, provided deadly close air support to enable UN ground\n\nforces to make a fighting withdrawal back to the coast and safety.\n\nIn the early campaigns at Pusan, Inchon, and the Chosin Res-\n\nervoir, the squadrons of 1st MAW provided invaluable aerial sup-\n\nport to the UN forces and often determined whether battles were\n\nwon or lost. Their performance was so impressive that numerous\n\nUN commanders commented highly on the effectiveness of Marine air\n\nsupport.\n\nWithout the presence of Marine aviation, the outcome of the\n\nKorean conflict might have been much different for the UN forces.\n\nMarine pilots truly earned their flight pay.\n\nMARINE AIR OVER KOREA:\n\nPUSAN TO THE CHOSIN BREAKOUT\n\nOUTLINE\n\nThesis Statement: During the early campaigns of the Korean\n\nconflict, U. S. Marine aviation provided reliable and highly\n\neffective air support for UN ground forces and proved to be\n\na vital key to the UN military successes.\n\nI. Pusan Perimeter\n\nA.

First Marine Division\n\nLine of March 30\n\nMARINE AIR OVER KOREA:\n\nPUSAN TO THE CHOSIN BREAKOUT\n\nAt 4 a.m. on 25 June 1950, eight divisions of the North\n\nKorean Peoples Army (NKPA) swept across the 38th Parallel and\n\nstruck into South Korea along six invasion routes (figs. 1 &\n\n2). This attack was the culmination of several years of\n\npolitical disputes and military clashes between the North\n\nand South Korean governments and began what was to be known\n\nas the Korean \"conflict\" between United Nations and Communist\n\nforces.\n\nThe speed and violence of the Communist attack stunned\n\nthe South Korean (ROK) defenders, and by mid-morning of the\n\nday of the attack, all six invading columns had broken through\n\nthe ROK outposts and were rushing to capture the capital city\n\nof Seoul. On 28 June, Seoul fell, and the South Korean gov-\n\nernment fled farther south to Taejon.\n\nOn 29 June 1950, General Douglas MacArthur, Commander\n\nof UN Forces in the Far East, was ordered by the United Nat-\n\nions to use U.S. forces in Japan to help stem the Communist\n\ninvasion. On 30 June, 2 rifle battalions of the U.S. 24th\n\nInfantry Division were placed under the temporary command of\n\nMajor General W. F. Dean and airlifted into Pusan, Korea.\n\nClick here to view image\n\nOne U. S. battalion went into position at Osan, south of Seoul,\n\nand was quickly routed by the stronger Communist force (fig. 3).\n\nThree days later, the second U. S. battalion was severely beaten\n\nat Chonan, and the Communist onslaught continued south with great\n\nspeed.1 It was already clear that the North Koreans were rush-\n\ning for Pusan and a quick ending to the war.\n\nU.S. Army reinforcements continued to arrive from Japan,\n\nand by 13 July, 2 regiments of the 24th Infantry Division had\n\nformed hasty defensive positions along the Kum river. That\n\nsame day, the 25th Infantry Division landed at Pusan, and Lt.\n\nGeneral W. H. Walker, leader of the U.S. Eighth Army, was named\n\nas commander of all UN ground forces in Korea.\n\nOn 15 July, 3 Communist divisions broke through the 20-\n\nmile American front along the Kum river. For 5 days, the\n\nAmericans attempted a stand at Taejon but were unsuccessful.\n\nOn 21 July, while trying to break out of Taejon, MajGen Dean\n\nwas cut off from his troops and was eventually taken prisoner.\n\nMajGen Dean would remain in captivity for the remainder of the\n\nwar, but his bravery in battle had won him the Medal of Honor.2\n\nThe delaying action fought by the unaided 24th Division\n\nhad cost over 1,000 American lives, but it had slowed the\n\nCommunist advance and won precious time while fresh UN forces\n\nwere being sent to Korea. One of the forces enroute by this\n\ntime was the hastily organized 1st Provisional Marine Brigade.\n\nOn 2 July 1950, General MacArthur requested a Marine Reg-\n\nClick here to view image\n\nimental Combat Team (RCT), with appropriate air support for\n\nemployment in Korea. The Joint Chiefs of Staff approved this\n\nrequest the same day, and, with the conflict only 10 days old,\n\nU.S. Marines were on their way to war once more, this time in\n\nKorea.\n\nThe 5th Marine Regiment, supported by the artillery of\n\n1st Battalion, 11th Marines, was selected as the ground unit\n\nof the Marine Brigade. Marine Air Group (MAG) - 33 was chosen\n\nas the air component. On 5 July 1950, this RCT-MAG force was\n\ndesignated as the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade. BGen E. A.\n\nCraig was appointed as Commanding General of the Brigade, and\n\nBGen T. J. Cushman was designated as Commanding General of the\n\nreinforced air group.\n\nThe Marine Brigade, including its air component, was form-\n\nally activated on 7 July 1950, and began loading for Korea on\n\nthe 9th. By 14 July, approximately 6,500 ground and air Marines\n\nset sail for the Far East and the Korean conflict.3\n\nBy late July, the situation in Korea had reached a crisis.\n\nThe Communists were threatening to break through the Pusan Per-\n\nimeter, which was held by remnants of the battered and sorely\n\noutnumbered American and ROK armies (fig. 4). The Marines were\n\nbadly needed. With the Army units falling back along all fronts,\n\nPusan, the only Korean port still in UN hands, was in danger of\n\nbeing lost. The Marine Brigade was originally scheduled to stage\n\ninto Korea through Japan, but the urgency of the military situat-\n\nion forced the Brigade to proceed directly to Pusan. The ground\n\nClick here to view image\n\nelements landed at Pusan on 2 August and began to debark. The\n\nair component proceeded to Japan by faster transportation and\n\nlanded there on 31 July (fig. 5).4\n\nWhile the ground units of the Brigade were debarking at\n\nPusan, MAG-33 quickly deployed its units and readied for combat\n\noperations. The major elements of MAG-33 included:\n\nUNITAIRCRAFT / MISSION\n\nVMF-214 F4U4B Corsairs\n\nVMF-323 F4U4B Corsairs\n\nVMF(N)-513 F4U5B Corsairs\n\nVMO-6 OY-2 spotter aircraft\n\nHO3S-1 helicopters\n\nMTACS-2 Tactical Air Control\n\nSquadron\n\nMGCIS-1 Ground-Controlled\n\nIntercept Squadron\n\nFor maximum mobility and striking power, VMF-214 and\n\nVMF-323 were based aboard \"jeep\" aircraft carriers during\n\nthe initial operations in Korea. The VMF-214 \"Blacksheep\"\n\nCorsairs were based on the USS Sicily, and the VMF-323\n\n\"Deathrattlers\" operated from the deck of the USS Badoeng\n\nStrait. VMF(N)-513, equipped with a night-fighter version\n\nof the Corsair, was initially land-based at Itazuke airfield\n\nin Japan. The helicopters and spotter aircraft of VMO-6\n\nwere staged at Chinhae, Korea, for closer coordination with\n\nthe Marine Brigade (fig. 6). MTACS-2, the Tactical Air Con-\n\ntrol squadron, set up shop at Pusan.\n\nClick here to view image\n\nIn the bitter fighting that ensued in Korea, Marine\n\naviators proved that they had trained well during the years\n\nfollowing World War II. During the early campaigns of the\n\nKorean conflict, U.S. Marine aviation provided reliable and\n\nhighly effective air support for UN ground forces and proved\n\nto be a vital key to the UN military successes.\n\nPUSAN PERIMETER\n\nWhen the Marine Brigade landed at Pusan of 2 August 1950,\n\nit was immediately assigned as part of the U.S. Eighth Army\n\nTask Force Kean. While ground elements of the Brigade were\n\npreparing for a counterattack west toward Chonju, the aviation\n\nelements of MAG-33 struck the first blow for the Marine Corps\n\nin Korea. On 3 August, Major R. P. Keller led a flight of 8\n\nVMF-214 Corsairs from the USS Sicily in the first Marine air\n\nstrike of the Korean war. Major Keller's flight bombed, rock-\n\neted, and strafed enemy positions near the towns of Sandon-ni\n\nand Chinju. Three days later, the \"Deathrattlers\" of VMF-323\n\nflew 30 sorties in support of Eighth Army units west of Pusan.\n\nOn 7 August, VMF(N)-513 added its support with a night strike\n\nlaunched from Itazuke airfield in Japan against enemy-held\n\npositions near Kumchon.5\n\nAlthough these first Marine air strikes were interdiction\n\nand deep air support missions, the two carrier-based squadrons\n\nwould quickly be tasked with that type of mission for which\n\nMarine aviators were best known -- close air support. The vet-\n\neran Marine pilots of World War II soon realized that they\n\nwould have to modify the aerial tactics they had used in\n\nthe previous war.\n\nEnemy air forces had been controlled early in the fight,\n\nand there was little heavy anti-aircraft opposition in the\n\nearly actions. However, due to the low cloud ceilings common\n\nto the summer rainy season, close air support (CAS) attacks\n\nhad to be made at low altitude, and the attacking aircraft\n\nusually encountered heavy enemy small arms fire. Numerous\n\naircraft and several pilots were lost to this crude, but\n\neffective, method of anti-aircraft fire.\n\nCHINDONG-NI\n\nOn 6 August, the Eighth Army Task Force Kean (named for\n\nits commander, MajGen W. B. Kean) launched a UN counterattack\n\nwest from Pusan to halt a Communust \"end run\" through the\n\nsouthwest portion of the perimeter (fig. 7). The 1st Prov-\n\nisional Marine Brigade was attached to the 25th Infantry\n\nDivision and ordered west to relieve U.S. Army units near\n\nChindong-ni.\n\nTask Force Kean moved out with VMF-323 and VMF-214\n\nCorsairs flying constant close air support strikes ahead of\n\nthe Marine and Army ground units. Marine aviators on the\n\nfront lines and Army artillery forward observers acted as\n\nforward air controllers, using radios to direct the aircraft\n\nto enemy trouble spots. Ground commanders quickly discovered\n\nthat air strikes were the most effective weapon against enemy\n\nClick here to view image\n\npositions dug in on the reverse slopes of the ridges.\n\nNapalm, dropped from low altitude, was recognized as\n\nthe most effective air weapon against tanks, troops in trenches,\n\nand inflammable targets. The 5-inch rockets were good against\n\nvehicles, trains, and gun positions, but 100- and 500-pound\n\nbombs proved best against bridges, buildings, and area targets.\n\nHowever, the pilots' favorite was a mix of high-explosive, in-\n\ncendiary, and armor-piercing 20mm cannon ammunition, which dis-\n\nintigrated vehicles, stopped locomotives, and mowed down enemy\n\ntroops.6\n\nTask Force Kean's attack stalled during the morning of\n\n7 August, and BGen Craig was ordered to assume control of all\n\ntroops in the Chindong-ni area. Under this new leadership,\n\nthe Task Force gained momentum, repulsed a Communist dawn\n\nattack on 8 August, and continued the attack toward the task\n\nforce objective of Chinju. By the evening of 9 August, the\n\ncore of the enemy resistance had broken, and the Brigade moved\n\nahead rapidly.\n\nKOSONG\n\nAugust 11 proved to be a very productive day for Marine\n\nair near the village of Kosong. This action, later known as\n\nthe \"Kosong turkey shoot\", began with an artillery bombard-\n\nment of the town of Kosong. The artillery was devastating\n\nand prompted major elements of the North Korean 83rd Motor-\n\nized Regiment to attempt a hasty withdrawal to the west. Too\n\nlate, they realized their mistake. Overhead, a division of\n\nVMF-323 Corsairs, led by Major A. A. Lund, spotted the road-\n\nbound enemy column of over 200 trucks, jeeps, and other veh-\n\nicles which carried the regiment's troops and supplies. As\n\nthe Corsairs began their strafing runs, the enemy column\n\nground to a halt and became totally disorganized. During\n\nthe attack, the Corsairs encountered heavy enemy ground fire,\n\nbut managed to destroy over 40 vehicles before being relieved\n\nby another flight of VMF-323 aircraft.7 However, not all went\n\nwell for the pilots of VMF-323 this day.\n\nThe original attacking flight did not escape unscathed.\n\nTwo of the four planes, piloted by Capt. V. Moses and 2Lt. D.\n\nCoyle, were damaged by enemy fire and forced to make emergency\n\nlandings in enemy territory. When his plane crash-landed,\n\nCapt. Moses was thrown clear of the aircraft but landed un-\n\nconcious in a rice paddy and drowned. He became MAG-33's\n\nfirst combat death.8\n\nLuckily, 2Lt. Coyle's experience that day had a more\n\nfortunate and even somewhat humorous ending. Within 5 minutes\n\nof his emergency landing, 2Lt Coyle was rescued by an HO3S-1\n\nhelicopter piloted by Lt G. F. Lueddeke of VMO-6. After enter-\n\ning the helicopter, Coyle slapped what he thought was an enlist-\n\ned man on the back and said, \"Thanks, Mac. I sure am glad to\n\nsee you.\" He was later somewhat embarassed to learn that he\n\nhad been addressing the Brigade commander, General Craig, who\n\nhad gone along to observe helicopter operations.9\n\n1ST BATTLE OF THE NAKTONG\n\nAt midnight on 12 August, the Brigade was ordered to\n\ndisengage from the enemy near Sanchon and to move to another\n\nthreatened portion of the Pusan Perimeter along the Naktong\n\nriver (fig. 8). During the morning of 15 August, the Marine\n\nBrigade arrived by truck at the location which would soon\n\nbecome known as the \"Naktong Bulge.\"\n\nDuring the night of 6 August, one of the most disting-\n\nuished Communist units, the NKPA 4th Division, had forced a\n\n1,000-man bridgehead across the Naktong river by wading\n\nthrough chest-deep water and pulling crude rafts loaded with\n\nvehicles, heavy weapons, and supplies.10 By 8 August, the\n\nNKPA 4th Division had engaged elements of the U.S. 24th\n\nInfantry and had a firm foothold within the UN perimeter.\n\nThus began the 1st Naktong Counteroffensive.\n\nDuring the now well-known battles of the \"1st Naktong\"\n\n(Obong-ni Ridge, Finger Ridge, etc.), MAG-33 provided in-\n\nvaluable combat strength to both U.S. Army and Marine units.\n\nOY-2 spotter aircraft from VMO-6 hovered over the battlefield\n\nthroughout the daylight hours, spotting for artillery units\n\nand providing control for the numerous airstrikes conducted\n\nby the Corsairs. At night, VMF(N)-513's \"Nightmare\" Corsairs\n\nsilenced enemy artillery and mortars by aiming at little more\n\nthan just artillery muzzle flashes. One pilot dive-bombed\n\nClick here to view image\n\nthe \"X\" formed by tracers from two widely displaced machine\n\nguns, both sighted in over the target which was in defilade.11\n\nAfter much fighting in the Naktong Bulge, the enemy\n\nforces were finally driven back across the river, and the\n\nperimeter was restored. Marine supporting arms were credited\n\nwith the final restoration of the perimeter, due to the dev-\n\nastating air and artillery barrages delivered on the withdraw-\n\ning enemy forces.\n\nOn 19 August, the Marine Brigade was detached from Task\n\nForce Kean and was ordered into Eighth Army reserve. BGen\n\nCraig ordered his units to a rear bivouac area near Masan to\n\nrest and await further orders. This bivouac area became known\n\nas the \"Bean Patch\" because it was just that -- a bean patch\n\nlarge enough to accomodate a brigade.\n\nAt the Bean Patch, the Brigade busied itself rearming\n\nand restocking with supplies trucked in from Pusan. Patrols\n\nin the rugged country around the Bean Patch were fed hot meals\n\ndelivered in special containers by the versatile helicopters\n\nof VMO-6. BGen Craig also utilized the services of VMO-6's\n\nhelicopters to fly him and his staff to and from meetings\n\nwithin the perimeter.\n\nFor the air component of the Brigade, however, the\n\nsuccessful close of the 1st Battle of the Naktong Bulge\n\nbrought little change in operations. Other UN forces were\n\nstill engaged and needed the air support which MAG-33 could\n\ndeliver. For the remainder of the month of August, the\n\nCorsairs of VMF-214 and VMF-323 ranged along the perimeter\n\nin support of U.S. Army and ROK units. During this period,\n\nMarine aircraft were largely directed by airborne Air Force\n\ncontrollers or by Army ground controllers, but they still\n\nconsistently produced the same high quality results as when\n\nworking under Marine control.\n\n2ND BATTLE OF THE NAKTONG\n\nThe end of August brought an unexpected turn of events\n\nfor the Marine Brigade. By 1 September, fresh Communist\n\nforces had again penetrated east of the Naktong river and\n\nwere seriously threatening the UN perimeter (fig. 9). Once\n\nmore the call went out for the \"fire brigade\" to plug the\n\nhole.\n\nWhen news of the projected recommitment reached Brigade\n\nheadquarters, VMF-323 was in Japan enjoying some rest and\n\nrecuperation, and VMF-214 was scheduled to follow soon after.\n\nAt 1600 on 1 September, VMF-323 received the new word while\n\nmost of its personnel were on leave in Kyoto and its planes\n\nwere at Itami airfield. By 2200, all but 12 members of the\n\nsquadron had reported in, and VMF-323 headed back into the\n\naction.12\n\nOn 3 September, the Brigade returned to the Naktong area\n\nand was placed opposite the center of the new bulge in the\n\nperimeter. As the Marine units stepped off in the attack,\n\nClick here to view image\n\nMarine air was unable to help initially due to heavy fog and\n\nlow cloud cover. This time, the Brigade found itself pitted\n\nagainst the NKPA 9th Division, which was armed with Russian-\n\nmade tanks and heavy direct fire weapons.\n\nBy 4 September, the NKPA 9th Division was attacking\n\nunder a full head of steam and was met head-on by the Marine\n\nBrigade. The weather had cleared, and the Corsairs of MAG-33\n\nranged overhead, delivering their ordnance with deadly accur-\n\nacy. Under the combined combat weight of the Marine air-\n\nground forces, the NKPA 9th Division eventually collapsed\n\nand withdrew across the Naktong river once more. After re-\n\nestablishing the perimeter, the Brigade was withdrawn to Pusan\n\nto embark aboard shipping for the anticipated amphibious land-\n\ning at Inchon.\n\nAlthough it had been in combat for only about a month,\n\nthe Marine Brigade had exceeded all expectations. An accur-\n\nate estimate of the damage inflicted upon the enemy by Marine\n\npilots is difficult to determine, but one thing was certain --\n\nthe aviators of MAG-33 had acquitted themselves well, and no\n\none knew it better than the Marines on the ground. Of MAG-33's\n\nperformance, Brigadier General Craig said:\n\nClose air support furnished by Marine airmen\n\nwas a marvel to everybody concerned, including the\n\nMarines. We had never seen anything like it, even\n\nin our practice.13\n\nINCHON / WOSAN LANDINGS\n\nAfter the 2nd Battle of the Naktong, UN and Communist\n\nforces reached a stalemate along the Pusan Perimeter. To\n\nbreak this deadlock, General MacArthur conceived a daring\n\nplan to conduct an amphibious assault at Inchon to cut the\n\nCommunist supply lines to the north and to isolate the North\n\nKorean forces in the south.\n\nFor the landing at Inchon and to facilitate future\n\noperations, two reinforced U.S. divisions, the 7th Infantry\n\nand the 1st Marine, were combined to form X Corps, under the\n\ncommand of Marine Major General E. M. Almond.\n\nBy mid-September, the major elements of the 1st Marine\n\nDivision and the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing were in place in\n\nKorea and Japan and were beginning to take part in the combat\n\noperations. Major General Field Harris commanded the Marine\n\nAir Wing, which now included MAG-12 and the elements of MAG-33\n\nwhich had taken part in the Pusan campaign. Besides the Cor-\n\nsairs of MAG-33, 1st MAW assets now included the Corsairs of\n\nVMF-312 and VMF-212, as well as the twin-engined F7F \"Tiger-\n\ncats\" from VMF(N)-542.\n\nINCHON\n\nOn 15 September, X Corps, following in the wake of a\n\nterrific naval bombardment, stormed ashore at Inchon and\n\nbegan to fight its way to the capital city of Seoul. All\n\nduring D-Day of the invasion, the carrier-based Corsairs of\n\nClick here to view image\n\nVMF-214 and VMF-323 added their bomb, napalm, and strafing\n\npower to the bombardment of Inchon and the island of Wolmi-do.\n\nThe port of Inchon fell on the first day, and Kimpo airfield\n\nwas captured shortly before midnight on the 17th by the 5th\n\nMarine Regiment.14 Less than one hour after the capture of\n\nKimpo airfield, the helicopters of VMO-6 landed and started\n\nto evacuate the dead and wounded.\n\nOn 19 September, VMF-212 and VMF(N)-542 flew into Kimpo\n\nfrom Itami airfield in Japan. VMF-312 was called forward to\n\nKimpo on 28 September, and by 1 October, MGCIS-1 and MTAS-2\n\nhad established a radar warning system and a Tactical Air\n\nDirection Center (TADC) at Kimpo to direct all aircraft in\n\nthe X Corps area.15 Now, Marine air efforts began in earnest.\n\nThe invasion at Inchon broke the back of the Communist\n\nforces in South Korea, and UN forces began to advance stead-\n\nily north from the Pusan Perimeter. Thousands of North Korean\n\nsoldiers were captured, and South Korea was soon back in friend-\n\nly hands.\n\nOn 8 October, the amphibious phase of the Inchon operat-\n\nion was declared terminated. X Corps was loaded back onto\n\nships at Inchon and transported by the Navy to the northeast-\n\nern coast of Korea for still another amphibious landing.\n\nGeneral MacArthur's overall plan called for X Corps to land\n\nat the port city of Wonsan, 80 miles above the 38th Parallel,\n\nwhile the Eighth Army continued its attack north from Seoul\n\nacross the 38th Parallel. Eventually, these two forces would\n\nencircle the enemy forces, destroy them, and end the war in\n\nKorea.\n\nWONSAN\n\nThe 1st Marine Division landed unopposed at Wonsan on\n\n26 October, and three days later, the 7th Infantry Division\n\ncame ashore at Iwon (fig. 11). All units drove quickly in-\n\nland, with the Marines striking toward the Chosin Reservoir\n\nand the 7th Infantry Division heading to the northwest.\n\nSimultaneously, two ROK divisions swept north toward the\n\nManchurian border.16\n\nA former Japanese airfield at Wosan became the first\n\nbase of operations for the 1st MAW in this new area, and on\n\n14 October, VMF-312 and VMF(N)-542 landed there to begin work.\n\nThe USS Badoeng Strait moved into the waters off Wonsan with\n\nVMF-323 embarked, and VMF-214 debarked from the USS Sicily\n\nto operate from the Wonsan airfield.\n\n1st MAW aircraft provided close air support as Marine\n\nunits fought north and as the Siberian-like winter began to\n\nclose in on the UN forces. In late October and early November,\n\nthe carrier-based pilots were confronted with new dangers from\n\nthe icy and snow-covered carrier decks. Aircraft which had\n\nstood the night on the carrier deck had to be taken below to\n\nthe hangar deck to thaw out and have the ice removed. Ashore,\n\nsimilar problems faced the aviation units. Icing conditions,\n\nlow cloud ceilings, and snow combined to make flight operations\n\nextremely hazardous. However, despite these hardships, Marine\n\nair units continued to provide timely and accurate air support.\n\nClick here to view image\n\nDuring this period, VMF-312's normal missions consisted\n\nof attacking bodies of North Korean troops attempting to es-\n\ncape the UN forces. On 19 October, a flight of VMF-312 Cor-\n\nsairs attacked 500 enemy troops near Yangdok, killing about\n\n100. On 24 October, another VMF-312 flight attacked a body\n\nof 800 enemy on the road near Kansong and caused over 200\n\ncasualties.17\n\nAs November wore on and UN forces met with continued\n\nsuccess, the North Koreans seemed pretty well beaten. There\n\nwas even some talk of \"home before Christmas,\" as the UN\n\nforces raced for the Yalu river which formed the border be-\n\ntween North Korea and China.\n\nAs the world would soon discover, the Chinese Communists\n\nhad another surprise in store for the UN forces.\n\nCHOSIN RESERVOIR\n\nOn 26 November 1950, ten divisions of the Chinese Com-\n\nmunist Army crossed the Yalu river and attacked the ROK II\n\nCorps, and the U.S. 2nd and 25th Army Divisions.18 The ROK\n\nforces were anihilated, and the 2nd Division lost over 80\n\npercent of its troops and heavy weapons. The UN forces soon\n\nrealized that they were in a \"new and different\" war, and\n\nthat they faced a fresh, new army of over 200,000. British\n\nand Turkish brigades were badly mauled as they attempted to\n\ncover the withdrawing UN forces. By 28 November, the Eighth\n\nArmy was wholly turned south with the Chinese in pursuit at\n\nthe rate of about six miles per day.19\n\nOn 20 November, the advance guard of the main Marine\n\ncolumn captured several Chinese soldiers who warned that a\n\nCommunist ambush awaited at Yudam-ni, west of the Chosin\n\nReservoir. Little heed was paid to these enlisted soldiers,\n\nand the column continued north. During the night of 28 Nov-\n\nember, a new Chinese army seemed to rise from the ground as\n\n8 Chinese divisions struck the 1st Marine Division. At the\n\ntime of this attack, the 7th and 5th Marines were in Yudam-ni,\n\nand the 1st Marines were protecting the main supply route\n\n(MSR) with single battalions at Hagaru, Koto-ri, and Chin-\n\nhung-ni (fig. 12). Within two hours after darkness fell,\n\nMarine units all along the 53-mile MSR were simultaneously\n\nengaged by the Communists.20\n\nOn 28 November, Marine Corsairs provided support for\n\nthe UN forces in numerous areas. Northeast of the Chosin\n\nReservoir, VMF-323 planes supported the withdrawing ROK forces.\n\nTo the west, VMF-312 and VMF-214 aircraft conducted their at-\n\ntacks in support of the Eighth Army, which was attempting to\n\nwithdraw to more defensible positions. VMF-212 flew all of\n\nits sorties in support of Marine units near the reservoir.\n\nThe Corsairs were most effectively used at this point\n\nto prevent the Chinese from massing their forces. Marine\n\npilots were constantly strafing enemy concentrations and\n\nbreaking up Communist attacks. On 28 November, enemy troop\n\nconcentrations were attacked 29 times; on 29 November, the\n\nnumber of similar attacks jumped to 61.21\n\nClick here to view image\n\nWith their supply routes blocked in the south, the units\n\nof X Corps attempted to regroup and to establish defensive\n\npositions, as the bitter cold and supply shortages began to\n\ntake their toll. Ammunition and medical supplies were air-\n\ndropped by Marine R4Ds and R4Q transports, while helicopters\n\nfrom VMO-6 made regular flights to evacuate the wounded.\n\nMarine R4D and R4Q transports shuttled day and night from\n\nItami airfield in Japan to Yongpo airfield, bringing in vit-\n\nally needed medical supplies and evacuating casualties to\n\nhospitals in Japan. Marine transports also flew supply and\n\nevacuation sorties into the short airstrip at Hagaru.22\n\nAfter four days of fighting the bitter cold and the\n\nfanatical Chinese Communists, 1st Marine Division's position\n\nbecame untenable. On 30 November, the decision was made for\n\nthe Marines to break out of the encirclement and to return\n\nto the coast.\n\nTHE BREAKOUT\n\nOn 1 December, the 1st Marine Division wheeled about\n\nand, led by the 7th Marines, started to fight south toward\n\nKoto-ri and Chinhung-ni (fig. 13). This Marine withdrawal\n\nwas destined to become an epic story of courage and survival,\n\nand, once again, Marine air support would play a decisive\n\nrole.\n\nNever in Marine history had so much depended on a sup-\n\nporting arm, yet never had circumstances conspired so well\n\nClick here to view image\n\nto prevent Marine air from carrying out its mission. The low\n\novercasts combined with the bitter cold and rugged terrain to\n\nrender close air support missions almost impossible. The ex-\n\ntreme cold also produced maintenance and logistic problems\n\nfor 1st MAW units, as engine oil froze and mechanics were\n\nforced to perform delicate engine work while exposed to the\n\nextreme cold. Lack of fueling and bomb-handling equipment\n\nand spare parts also plagued 1st MAW squadrons, yet these ob-\n\nstacles were eventually overcome, and air support was avail-\n\nable to cover the ground elements fighting south.\n\nDuring the breakout, Corsairs from all the Marine squad-\n\nrons participated in day-long strikes against the Chinese.\n\nOY-2 spotter aircraft flew artillery-spotting missions along\n\nthe withdrawing column, while VMO-6's helicopters continued\n\ntheir medical evacuation and rescue missions. The crowded\n\nair above the UN column was filled with cargo planes dropping\n\nmuch-needed supplies, and the Corsairs were constantly wheel-\n\ning and diving in attacks on enemy positions. Marine Corsairs\n\nranged the length of the withdrawing column providing flank\n\nsecurity, attacking enemy concentrations, and destroying enemy\n\nroadblocks and weapons.\n\n1st Marine Division received 36 close air support sorties\n\nduring the daylight hours of 1 December, but the greatest ef-\n\nfort was made in behalf of three Army battalions from the 7th\n\nInfantry Division. For three days, these Army units had fought\n\na grim battle for survival against heavy odds and were in\n\ndanger of being overrun by over 3,000 Communists troops.\n\nCaptain E. P. Stamford, a Marine forward air controller as-\n\nsigned to one of the beleagured battalions, directed the\n\nCorsairs of VMF(N)-513 against the enemy, just as the Com-\n\nmunists launched a fierce attack against the battalions.\n\nFor a few moments, the fighting was touch and go, but as\n\nthe Corsairs made repeated napalm, bomb, rocket, and straf-\n\ning attacks, the enemy broke ranks and fled for better cover.\n\nIn all, 46 Marine sorties were flown in support of these\n\nArmy units, allowing them to eventually join up with the\n\nmain withdrawing Marine force.23\n\nThroughout the breakout, the Corsairs of VMF(N)-513 and\n\nthe \"Tigercats\" of VMF(N)-542 were constantly on station at\n\nnight over the scattered fighting fronts, silencing Chinese\n\nartillery and automatic weapons fire. Gun flashes revealed\n\nthe enemy's guns, and Marine night-fighters proved that they\n\ncould knock the guns out. Ground commanders noted that the\n\nmere sound of the night-fighters' engines would often be\n\nenough to silence the enemy artillery.\n\nHAGARU\n\nBy 4 December, the Marine column had reached Hagaru and\n\nthe exhausted forces were able to enjoy a brief lull in the\n\nfighting. However, there was no respite for the Marine fliers.\n\nOn 4 and 5 December, Marine pilots flew a total of 297 sorties\n\nagainst enemy positions, vehicles, and troop concentrations\n\naround Hagaru.24\n\nOn the morning of 6 December, the 1st Marine Division\n\nbroke out of Hagaru and continued its attack toward the coast.\n\nBy 0715, 18 Corsairs of VMF-214 had reported on station and\n\nwere quickly put to work. After advancing only 2,000 yards\n\nfrom Hagaru, the column was halted by intense enemy fire. As\n\nthe Corsairs attacked the enemy positions, 81mm mortar fire\n\nwas continued, even though the mortar shell trajectories\n\nwere higher than the altitude of the attacking planes. Rather\n\nthan lose the firepower of the 81s, the mortar gunners were\n\ninstructed to aim at the tails of the attacking aircraft to\n\nensure that none of the planes were shot down. Under this\n\ncombined bombardment, the enemy guns were silenced in about\n\nan hour, and the column continued southward.\n\nOn this day also, a new innovation was introduced to help\n\ncontrol the crowded airspace over the withdrawing Marine column.\n\nA four-engine Marine R5D transport, hastily equipped with add-\n\nitional communications equipment, was provided by VMR-152 and\n\noperated as a flying Tactical Air Direction Center. From its\n\nstation above the column, this airborne TADC was in excellent\n\nposition to receive radio transmissions from ground units and\n\nto control all aircraft supporting the division.25\n\nKOTO-RI\n\nWith its arrival at Koto-ri on 7 December, the 1st Marine\n\nDivision had completed all but the last leg of its fighting\n\nwithdrawal. VMO-6 immediately continued its medical evac-\n\nuation missions by helicopter, and Marine R4D transports\n\nlanded on the short airstrip at Koto-ri to assist in the\n\nevacuation. The airstrip at Koto-ri was so short that a\n\nlanding signals officer (LSO) had to guide the large trans-\n\nport aircraft onto the field, using the same techniques em-\n\nployed on the carrier decks.\n\nOn 8 December, the Marine column resumed the attack to\n\nreach the safety of Chinhung-ni and, eventually, the port of\n\nHungnam. A raging blizzard grounded all Marine aircraft on\n\nthat day, but 9 December dawned bright and clear. By 0715,\n\nplanes from VMF-312 were over the column, attacking both\n\nsides of the road. Flights from all the other Marine squad-\n\nrons followed and kept up continuous attacks in support of\n\nthe ground forces.\n\nOn 10 December, another chapter in Marine aviation hist-\n\nory began with the arrival of VMF-311 at Yongpo airfield.\n\nVMF-311 was the first Marine jet squadron to fly in combat,\n\nand until 14 December, VMF-311's F9F \"Panther\" jets flew\n\ninterdiction sorties in support of the Marine column. The\n\nsquadron was then moved to Pusan to operate with the 5th\n\nAir Force jets to cover the withdrawal of the Eighth Army.26\n\nHUNGNAM\n\nBy 1300 on 11 December, the last units of the Marine\n\nforce reached Chinhung-ni, boarded trucks, and headed for\n\nHungnam. With the departure of the 1st Marine Division for\n\nHungnam and eventual evacuation by sea, the main task of the\n\n1st Marine Aircraft Wing was finished. VMF-312, VMF(N)-513,\n\nand VMF(N)-542 departed for Japan to join VMF-214, which had\n\nleft Korea earlier. VMR-152 continued to evacuate supplies,\n\nequipment, and personnel. By 18 December, 1st MAW had com-\n\npletely withdrawn from the Hungnam area.\n\nThe fighting withdrawal was over. A Marine division\n\nand a Marine air wing, fighting against bitter cold and seem-\n\ningly impossible odds, had severely mangled an enemy force\n\nvastly superior in strength. The courage and fighting ability\n\nof the ground Marine had been proved once more, yet the ground\n\nMarine was the first to demand that a large share of the credit\n\nfor the successful withdrawal was due to their flying counter-\n\nparts in 1st MAW. In the hour of greatest need, Marine airmen\n\nhad not faltered.\n\nMajor General O. P. Smith, Commanding General of the\n\n1st Marine Division expressed the sentiments of the ground\n\nMarines when he said:\n\nDuring the long reaches of the night and in\n\nthe snow storms, many a Marine prayed for the coming\n\nof day or clearing weather when he would again hear\n\nthe welcome roar of your planes as they dealt out\n\ndestruction to the enemy.... Never in its history\n\nhas Marine Aviation given more convincing proof of\n\nits indispensable value to the ground Marine. A\n\nbond of understanding has been estableshed that will\n\nnever be broken.27\n\nREFLECTIONS\n\nAlthough the fighting raged on for another two years\n\nbefore the Korean armistice was signed, the evacuation of\n\nthe 1st Marine Division and the 1st Marine Air Wing at Hung-\n\nnam marked the end of the initial phase of Korean combat for\n\nthe Marine air-ground team. Marine units had fought well,\n\nand lessons had been learned.\n\nDuring the early months of Korean combat, new tactical\n\ndevelopments pioneered by 1st MAW greatly advanced the UN\n\nair effort and added to the 1st MAW reputation for versatil-\n\nity.28 Marine squadrons refined close air support techniques,\n\ndeveloped an airborne tactical air control center, and proved\n\nthat night close air support missions could be safely accomp-\n\nlished.\n\nOf the new tactical air support developments in the\n\nKorean action, none had a more revolutionary effect than that\n\ncreated by the Marine helicopters of VMO-6.29 Marine heli-\n\ncopters reshaped battlefield logistics in Korea and pioneered\n\ntechniques for vertical troop envelopment, aerial wire-laying,\n\nmedical evacuation, and vertical resupply.\n\nAt the end of the Pusan Perimeter campaign, BGen Craig\n\ncommended the pilots of VMO-6 and said, \"Marine helicopters\n\nhave proven invaluable.... They have been used for every\n\nconceivable type of mission.\"30\n\nIn the early campaigns at Pusan, Inchon, and the Chosin\n\nReservoir, the squadrons of 1st MAW provided invaluable aerial\n\nsupport to the UN forces, and often determined whether battles\n\nwere won or lost. Pilots, as well as ground crews, were taxed\n\nto their limits but delivered air support for the ground units\n\nboth day and night. From 3 August to 14 December, Marine tact-\n\nical squadrons flew a total of 7,822 sorties, and evacuated\n\nover 5,000 UN casualties.31\n\n5,305 of the 1st MAW sorties were close air support mis-\n\nsions which were so accurate and deadly as to prompt UN com-\n\nmanders to comment on the effectiveness of Marine close air\n\nsupport. One such comment was made by Colonel P. L. Freeman,\n\ncommander of the U.S. Army 23rd Regiment at Pusan. He stated:\n\nThe Marines on our left were a sight to behold.\n\nNot only was their equipment superior or equal to\n\nours, but they had squadrons of air in direct support.\n\nThey used it like artillery. It was, \"Hey, Joe - this\n\nis Smitty - knock the left off that ridge in front of\n\nItem Company.\" They had it day and night.32\n\nMarine air in Korea, from Pusan to the Chosin Reservoir,\n\ncontributed significantly to the UN military successes and\n\ntruly earned its flight pay.\n\nNOTES\n\n1S.
