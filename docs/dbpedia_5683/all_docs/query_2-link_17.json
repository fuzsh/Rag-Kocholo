        "text": "Policy Homepage | Forms & Support Documents\n\nI. Introduction\n\nThe California 4-H Youth Development Program (4-H YDP) is a major educational effort that is central to the mission of the University of California Cooperative Extension (UCCE) system. This means that the University of California, Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources (UC ANR), has overall responsibility for development, efficiency and effectiveness of the 4-H YDP in California. Funds for support of 4-H YDP work come from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), UC, the California 4-H Foundation, private donors and various other sources.\n\nII. Authorization\n\nA. Scope\n\n4-H units and volunteer management organizations (VMOs; e.g., councils), when authorized by the issuance of a 4-H charter, are granted certain privileges and responsibilities related to financial activities.\n\nUC ANR expects 4-H units and VMOs to raise and manage all 4-H YDP funds in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and within the policies and procedures specified in this Handbook.\n\n4-H units and VMOs are authorized by the 4-H charter to carry out a program of youth development activities using the 4-H name and emblem. This authorization also gives them the authority to organize, account and manage the operational and fiscal concerns of the 4-H YDP, projects and units under their jurisdiction.\n\nThis policy extends to funds generated in the name of 4-H by the adult volunteers, parents/guardians and members of all 4-H units and VMOs.\n\nB. Responsibility\n\nAuthorization to use the 4-H name and emblem is the responsibility of the statewide 4-H YDP director, working in cooperation with each county director or designee. See Authorization to Use the 4-H Name and Emblem Flow Chart and Using the 4-H Name and Emblem for more information.\n\nThe county director or designee is responsible for authorizing the use of the 4-H name and emblem within her or his jurisdiction. See Application to Use 4-H Name and Emblem Single or Multiple County Use .\n\nThe State 4-H YDP Director is responsible for authorizing the use of the 4-H name and emblem for statewide or multi-county (not under the authority of one county director) use. See Application to Use 4-H Name and Emblem Statewide or Multiple County Use .\n\nIII. The Concept of Internal Controls\n\nA. Control System\n\nA successful organization must have an \"internal control system\" to coincide with privileges and responsibilities. This concept is recognized by all enterprises, both public and private, as the framework for good management. An internal control system consists of the policies and procedures designed to provide management with reasonable assurance that the goals and objectives it believes important to the entity will be met. Internal accounting controls are established to ensure that only authorized transactions are processed and recorded, to allow for the preparation of appropriate financial statements and to ensure that access to, and use of, assets is appropriate. Administrative controls provide the environment in which accounting procedures occur. This environment is characterized by three major factors.\n\nAwareness: Communication of what is expected.\n\nAttitude: Incentive to exercise control.\n\nDiscipline: Assurance that activities are controlled.\n\nB. Control Environment\n\nThe internal control system set forth in this section is designed to help 4-H YDP staff and adult volunteers create an appropriate control environment and a system of sound accounting procedures for the financial operations of all California 4-HYDP activities. The objective is to provide a framework of internal controls for 4-H activities that gives reasonable assurance regarding the following:\n\nAccomplishment of established 4-H YDP goals and objectives.\n\nEfficient and effective use of 4-H YDP resources.\n\nSafeguarding of all 4-H YDP assets.\n\nReliability and integrity of 4-H YDP financial reports and other information.\n\nCompliance with all policies, plans, procedures, laws and regulations applicable to 4-H YDP activities and programs.\n\nIV. Bank Accounts\n\nA. Authorization\n\nAll 4-H units and VMOs must be chartered to use the 4-H name and emblem to raise, allocate and disperse funds in support of the 4-H YDP, projects and groups. See also. Using the 4-H Name and Emblem (pdf)\n\nAuthorization to establish one business checking and one savings account is obtained from the county director* or designee upon approval of the unit’s charter by the State 4-H YDP Director.\n\nAdditional accounts require further approval from the county director* or designee.\n\n4-H VMOs with approval from the county director* may work with the California 4-H Foundation to establish an interest bearing fund functioning as an endowment with the UC Regents that can be used to support an annual budget. Fund minimums to establish and withdrawal restrictions apply.\n\nB. Establishment of Accounts\n\nEach 4-H YDP unit and council that manages cash is required to:\n\nHave an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Employer Identification Number (EIN).\n\nThe UCCE county office must be the address of record for all county 4-H units and VMOs.\n\nThe State 4-H Office should be the address of record for the state VMO.\n\nEstablish at a financial institution its own checking and/or savings account with at least two (2) signatures.\n\nC. Signatories\n\nThe signatures must be from two (2) unrelated individuals, of whom one can be a 4-H member and the other an adult volunteer. The signer may not be the same person as the payee. If the bank does not allow youth members to sign, then there should be two adult volunteers.\n\nAlthough many banks do not allow an account to require two (2) signatures, all 4-H YDP accounts should be set up so that two signatures are required by the 4-H unit or VMO to expend or withdraw funds.\n\nNo UCCE or 4-H YDP staff are permitted to be signatories on 4-H unit or VMO bank accounts.\n\nD. Use of ATM and Deposit Cards\n\n4-H units and VMOs are not allowed to apply for or use automatic withdrawal or credit cards. On-line banking transmissions are not permissible.\n\nDeposit cards that allow for deposit only may be used with the approval of the county director* or designee. See Deposit Cards Electronic Banking FAQ .\n\nE. Review of Monthly Statements\n\nAdult volunteer and youth treasurers are responsible for maintaining and reconciling the bank statements for each account on a monthly basis. These constitute a record of deposits, withdrawals, fees paid and interest earned on a monthly basis. See Treasurer's Manual (2014)\n\nThe county director* or designee must review all the monthly 4-H YDP unit and VMO bank statements for any discrepancies. See UCCE County Office Banking Procedures flowchart and Reviewing 4-H Unit and VMO Monthly Statements Checklist .\n\nThe bank account statement cycle date must reflect the period of the first day of the month through the last day of the month (e.g., July 1 – July 31).\n\nMonthly statements should be immediately copied and forwarded to the 4-H unit or VMO treasurer.\n\nUpon completion of the monthly review, all statements should be initialed and filed in UCCE office*. See Monthly 4-H Bank Statement Verification Form .\n\nAny discrepancies identified in the monthly bank statement review must be reported immediately to the county director*.\n\nThe county director* will investigate any discrepancies, with assistance from the State 4-H Office and (if needed) from the ANR Controller’s office. If discrepancies are identified, and depending on their nature, they may result in the removal of 4-H adult volunteer signatories from the account or closure of the account and transfer of the funds to the 4-H VMO to be held in escrow for up to three (3) years.\n\nF. Failure to follow the above policies\n\nFailure to follow the above policies can result in the revoking of the 4-H YDP unit or VMO charter. See the 4-H Banking Policy FAQ , UCCE County Office Banking Procedures flowchart for more information.\n\nG. Revocation and Dissolution of a Charter\n\nHandling of 4-H Unit Assets in a Dissolution\n\nIn the event a charted 4-H unit is disbanded, all assets (including equipment, property, bank accounts, etc.) shall be transferred to the county 4-H VMO to be held in escrow for three (3) years pending re-establishment of the unit before distributing the assets in support of the county 4-H YDP. County 4-H YDP staff will submit a Notification of 4-H Unit Dissolution Form to the State 4-H Office at the time the 4-H Unit votes to disband.\n\nHandling of County 4-H VMO Assets in a Dissolution\n\nIn the event a county 4-H VMO is dissolved, all assets (including equipment, property, bank accounts, etc.) are the responsibility of the University of California and shall be transferred to the county director or designee. The county director or designee will hold any unrestricted assets in escrow for up to three (3) years pending re-establishment of the county 4-H VMO before distributing the assets for support of the county 4-H YDP. Restricted assets would continue to be dispersed according to donor designations under the oversight of the county director or designee. The county 4-H VMO President/Chair will notify the county 4-H YDP staff who will submit a Notification of 4-H Unit Dissolution Formto the State 4-H Office at the time the 4-H VMO votes to dissolve.\n\nHandling of State 4-H VMO Assets in a Dissolution\n\nIn the event a state 4-H VMO is dissolved, all assets (including equipment, property, bank accounts, etc.) are the responsibility of the University of California and shall be transferred to the State 4-H YDP Director. The State 4-H YDP will hold the assets in escrow for up to three (3) years pending re-establishment of the state 4-H VMO before distributing the assets for support of the 4-H YDP in the state, as appropriate. Restricted assets would continue to be dispersed according to donor designations under the oversight of the State 4-H YDP Director. The state 4-H VMO President/Chair will notify the State 4-H Office staff liaison who will submit a Notification of 4-H Unit Dissolution Form to the State 4-H Office at the time the state 4-H VMO votes to dissolve.\n\nH. Federal Employer Identification Numbers (EIN)\n\nUpon review of the charter application, the State 4-H Office will assign the EIN# to the newly chartered 4-H unit or VMO. When a unit or VMO is chartered, the IRS letter granting the new EIN# will be provided to 4-H YDP staff. The UCCE county office* must maintain a record of all EIN numbers in the county. See IRS 4-H EIN FAQ .\n\nNo account held in the name of any 4-H unit or VMO may use the name of a member or adult volunteer, and a social security number of an individual must not be used in lieu of the appropriate EIN.\n\nEach 4-H unit and VMO must have their own EIN.\n\nThe UCCE county office* address must be the office of record for all 4-H units and VMOs.\n\nV. Responsibilities of 4-H YDP Staff\n\nThe purpose of this section is to describe the roles and responsibilities of the 4-H YDP staff in overseeing the management of funds for 4-H units and VMOs. The 4-H YDP staff is responsible for creating an environment that encourages proper internal controls.\n\nA. Training Member and Adult Volunteer Treasurers\n\nThe 4-H YDP staff is responsible for training the member treasurers and officer/treasurer advisor for each unit and the adult volunteer treasurers for each VMO in financial management policies, procedures and principles as appropriate to 4-H YDP operations.\n\nAt a minimum, trainings must be conducted annually and attendance is required in order to hold the position of treasurer and manage unit or VMO banking accounts.\n\nB.

In the absence of an RPC, the SPM in consultation with the CD/Advisor or designee, must approve the amount of annual carry forward funds for 4-H units and VMOs as well as determining the investment of those funds.\n\nXI. Financial Processing Procedures\n\nA. Accountability\n\nOfficers of the 4-H units and VMOs, as well as the adult volunteers involved are accountable for all funds raised. Accountability includes responsibility for how funds are used and protected from misappropriation. This includes monitoring adult volunteer and youth treasurers’ responsibilities. The Treasurer's Manual (2014) provides more detailed information.\n\nB. Handling Money\n\nThe 4-H unit or VMO treasurer has the responsibility for recording, disbursing, depositing and properly accounting for and classifying the 4-H unit or VMO funds. Individual accountability for cash must be maintained throughout all cashiering operations. 4-H funds must not be combined with other funds, such as private, business or other institutional funds. See also Banking Electronic Check Conversion FAQ .\n\nC. Receiving Money\n\nThe 4-H unit or VMO must have a record for all cash and checks received.\n\nA receipt should be issued for each individual collection of cash and checks. Pre-numbered receipts are preferred. The receipts must be turned over to the 4-H unit or VMO treasurer as soon as possible.\n\nIn some cases, it might not be practical to issue a receipt. In these cases, collection of funds must be documented by Form 8.8 Monthly Statement of Cash Collections to be filled out daily. The completed Form 8.8 Monthly Statement of Cash Collections should indicate the name of the individual who collected the money, the total money collected (attach cash register tape) and the name of the banking institution where funds will be deposited.\n\nTwo individuals, one being an unrelated adult, must sign the Form 8.8 Monthly Statement of Cash Collections .\n\nD. Depositing Money\n\nIf practical, to ensure the safe handling of currency and to protect the individuals handling cash, funds should be deposited daily or turned over each day to the 4-H unit or VMO treasurer.\n\nChecks must be made out to the 4-H unit or VMO and not to an individual. Checks, currency, cashier’s checks and money orders must be endorsed by someone authorized to do so within the 4-H unit or VMO.\n\nThe 4-H unit or VMO treasurer must deposit all funds in the 4-H unit’s or VMO's account. Treasurers are required to deposit funds received within one (1) week and are encouraged to make daily deposits. If, under certain circumstances, deposits cannot be made daily, a receipt must be written and kept in a secure place overnight.\n\nWhen Form 8.8 Monthly Statement of Cash Collections is used, the deposit receipt should be attached.\n\nA deposit receipt must be obtained from the bank and filed with the checkbook. A deposit entry should be made in the checkbook or passbook. The date, amount and source of income for each individual amount received must be entered in the ledger.\n\nE. Ledgers\n\nThe ledgers will allow separate entries for receipts and disbursements. Entries should be made in the calendar year in which they occur. Headings for funds should be established, as appropriate, in order to separately account for funds from different sources and for expenses by different categories or for different purposes. 4-H units and VMOs with procedures in conformance with the Treasurer's Manual (2014) will meet these requirements.\n\nF. Other Necessary and Supporting Records\n\nOther documentation to be retained on file include bills, receipts, canceled checks and written authorization for disbursement not covered in 4-H unit or VMO approved budgets or minutes of meetings in which budget changes or special non-budgeted items were approved.\n\nG. Petty Cash Fund\n\nOn rare occasions, a petty cash fund may be needed for miscellaneous items. However, the use of petty cash is not encouraged and it should not be used as a substitute for sound planning and budgeting. Petty cash should be reconciled, at a minimum, on a monthly basis. In petty cash allotments, the cash plus the cash receipts for expenditures should equal the initial authorized amount. All petty cash allotments should be entered in the general ledger as petty cash along with the person's name to which the cash is issued.\n\nH. Change Funds\n\nA change fund may be necessary to support substantial cash sales activities. The purpose of a change fund is to provide a reserve of small denomination currency and coins to make change. The change fund is not a petty cash fund and is not to be used to pay expenses. A change fund is established by writing a check for the balance to be kept in the change fund and obtaining the equivalent small denomination currency and coins.\n\nI. Cash Advances\n\nIn general, cash advances may not be made from the 4-H unit or VMO checking or savings account. On rare occasions, it may be necessary to provide cash in advance of an expense being incurred. The advance must be approved by the unit or VMO for a specific purpose and the amount of the advance should be no greater than anticipated costs. The recipient of the advance must provide receipts for expenses incurred and return that portion of the advance not used. The persons approving the advance and signing the check must be different from the person receiving the advance.\n\nJ. Theft or Mismanagement of Funds\n\nIf 4-H funds are stolen or mismanaged or if there is suspicion of other financial abuse, the incident must be reported immediately upon discovery to the county director*.\n\nK. Handling Funds for Project Groups\n\nProject groups should plan the total cost of project materials and supplies for the year. Project groups within 4-H units or VMOs may raise funds for special events, such as field days, project trips or community service activities. All monies received to support project groups including costs paid by members are to be deposited in the 4-H unit or VMO treasury. The 4-H unit or VMO treasurer should set up separate project accounts in the general ledger for each project group so that separate accountability can be maintained over funds and expenditures. The 4-H unit or VMO treasurer may also set up separate project accounts in the general ledger for each special event controlled by a project group so that separate accountability can be maintained over these funds and expenditures. All expenditures to support project groups must be made from established 4-H unit or VMO accounts.\n\nL. Mileage Reimbursement\n\n4-H adult volunteers will be reimbursed at the rate of $.14 per mile, when the mileage reimbursement is paid with funds held in a UC Regents account. Other rates may be set when the funds for reimbursement are paid from an externally held account by the 4-H unit or VMO.\n\nXII. Disbursements\n\nA. Procedures\n\nAll expenditures must be made from established 4-H unit or VMO accounts.\n\nDecisions concerning the disbursement of funds by a 4-H unit or VMO are to be made by the membership of the unit or VMO.\n\nFinancial commitments and expenditures must be in accordance with the policies established in this Handbook and with the 4-H unit’s or VMO’s approved budget.\n\nIf expenses are incurred for non-budgeted items, these expenses should not be paid until after the 4-H unit or VMO formally approves the non-budgeted expenditure.\n\nFor budgeted items, the treasurer should make payments only with proper documentation such as a purchase order, receipt, invoice or other supporting documentation.\n\nAll checks must bear the signatures of two unrelated persons authorized and designated as signatories by the unit or VMO. The signer may not be the same person as the payee.\n\nThe check memo must include the purpose of payment.\n\nB. Records\n\nAll money paid out must be entered in the check register or stub when the check is written.\n\nAll disbursements are to be made by check and must be substantiated by receipted bills, canceled checks and written authorization (e.g., unit or VMO meeting minutes, the annual approved budget, etc.).\n\nDisbursements should be made only from money that has already been deposited, not from anticipated deposits or from cash in hand.\n\nCheckbook stubs must be completely filled out at the time each check is drawn or a deposit is made.\n\nAt a minimum, the classification of disbursements should follow the expense accounts and definitions set up in IRS Form 990. Sub-classifications can be added to provide additional detail or clarity.\n\nXIII. Federal Taxes\n\n4-H units and VMOs are not required to file federal taxes since they are not separately incorporated legal entities and the activities conducted by the 4-H units and VMOs are treated as educational activities conducted by the UC. The UC will treat all 4-H unit and VMO income and expenses as UC income and expenses on its Form 990-T.\n\nXIV. California State Income Taxes\n\n4-H units and VMOs are not required to file with the California Franchise Tax Board since they are not separately incorporated legal entities and the activities conducted by the 4-H units and VMOs are treated as educational activities conducted by the UC. UC and its affiliated organizations are considered to be part of the state of California and its instrumentalities. As such, the UC is not subject to the Revenue and Taxation Code and, by extension, is not subject to state income tax.\n\nXV. California State Sales Tax\n\nA. Scope\n\nIn California, sales tax applies to the sale of tangible personal property unless the sale is covered by a specific legal exemption or exclusion. In most circumstances, the 4-H YDP is exempt from charging sales tax on the items it will sell because it is considered a consumer and not the retailer of specific kinds of tangible personal property under certain conditions. Specific legal exemptions or exclusions that pertain to 4-H units and VMOs engaged in fundraising projects are set forth in Section 6361 and Regulation 1597, Revenue and Taxation Code. (Also see California Department of Tax and Fee Administration Publication No. 61, Sales and Use Taxes: Exemptions and Exclusions and Publication No. 18, Tax Tips for Non-Profit Organizations.). For additional information see the California State Sales Tax FAQ . You may also consult the UC Sales Tax Manual.\n\nB. Items Not Taxable\n\nThe sale of food products, nonalcoholic beverages or other tangible personal property made or produced by members of the organization are exempt from state sales tax when those sales are made on an irregular or intermittent basis and the organization’s profits from those sales are used exclusively in furtherance of the purposes of the organization. A seller’s permit is not required for the sale of these items as 4-H is considered a consumer.\n\nC. Taxable Items\n\nIn general, the sale of items not made or produced by group participants such as t-shirts, wrapping paper, mugs, stuffed animals, etc. are subject to California sales tax. Thus, 4-H may not sell items that require collecting and reporting sales taxes.\n\nXVI. Withholding Tax\n\n4-H units and VMOs that pay California source income to nonresidents of California (i.e., payment for services) must not exceed a total amount paid of $1,500 per payee in a calendar year. This policy does not apply to services that are processed through UC as there is an established process for withholding tax and for remitting the tax withheld to the Franchise Tax Board. For further details, see accounting manual chapter UCOP Accounting Manual: D-371-77 , Disbursements: Tax Withholding on Nonwage Payments Made to Nonresidents of California.\n\nXVII. Property Tax\n\nA. Real Property\n\nAny real property donated to, or purchased by 4-H units or VMOs will generally be held by UC in the name of The Regents of the University of California and as such, is therefore exempt from payment of property taxes.\n\nThe ANR Development Services Director, in addition to the county director*, must be consulted when 4-H units or VMOs are considering purchasing or accepting donations of real property.\n\nB. Other Property\n\nAny other property (e.g., tools, equipment, vehicles, etc.) owned by 4-H units or VMOs is exempt from property tax.\n\nThe county director* must approve the purchase of any vehicles (e.g., trailers) for use in the 4-H YDP. If approved, the vehicle (e.g., trailer) shall be registered to The Regents of the University of California and is exempt from payment of property taxes. Such vehicles (e.g., trailers) shall be obtained for educational purposes only.\n\nXVIII. Financial Reporting and Completion\n\nThe purpose of this section is to describe the steps involved in preparing financial reports and completing the accounting and auditing processes. 4-H annual financial reporting follows the statewide 4-H YDP program year and covers the period of July 1 through June 30.\n\nA. Annual Financial Report\n\nA Form 6.3 Annual Financial Report must be completed for each 4-H unit or VMO account annually by the 4-H treasurer.\n\nThe balance at the end of the previous year as reported on the Annual Financial Report should match the account balance at start of the statewide 4-H YDP program year.\n\nReport total monthly reconciled income and expenses and ending monthly balance.\n\nReport year totals.\n\nB. Inventory Report\n\nA Form 6.2 Annual Inventory Report of 4-H unit or VMO property and equipment will be made by each 4-H treasurer.\n\nItems purchased will be recorded on the current inventory listing. For items disposed of during the year, record the date.\n\nDonated equipment will be posted on the inventory listing, showing the date acquired, item received and the source of the donation and its value.\n\nItems listed in the Annual Inventory Report form are to have an individual purchase price or fair market value recorded. Only those inventory items on the Inventory Report Form valued at $1,500 or more, are required to be entered in the online 4-H Annual Financial Reporting System. One exception to the $1500 value minimum is if there are a few duplicate or almost identical items of a high value that equal $1500, (e.g., three computers each worth $500). Those items are to be recorded in the online 4-H Annual Financial Reporting System as well.\n\nC. Financial Review Responsibilities and Requirements\n\nOne of the key elements of any system of internal controls is the provision for an examination and audit of financial statements, fund balances, assets and the established accounting system. This examination should be independent of the 4-H unit or VMO treasurer or others involved with the relevant finances. Independence ensures the accuracy of information, the existence of assets and the reliability of the financial data.\n\nEach 4-H unit and VMO is responsible for having their financial statements and related books and records reviewed on an annual basis after the close of the fiscal year. The peer review committee must complete Form 8.5 Year-End Club Peer Review Report and Form 8.6 Year-End Club Peer Review Checklist and submit to the 4-H unit or VMO treasurer.\n\nThe internal peer review committee should not include the 4-H unit or VMO treasurer, anyone related to the treasurer or any other adult volunteer involved in the financial matters of the VMO, such as fundraising, bookkeeping or holding signature authority.\n\nFor the 4-H unit, the review committee should be comprised of two (2) adult volunteers and two (2) members.\n\nFor the VMO, the peer review committee should be composed of at least three (3) adult volunteers.\n\nIt is desirable to have a peer review committee that is appointed by the VMO chair or president to oversee the conducting of audits for all units that are under the jurisdiction of the VMO. At the discretion of the county director* or designee this may be requested.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, a certified public accountant (CPA) must conduct an audit and/or review of a 4-H unit or VMO financial statements and related books and records. The following circumstances may indicate the need for this type of annual audit and/or review:\n\nThere are suspected irregularities related to financial activities.\n\nThe county director*, 4-H YDP staff, 4-H unit or VMO deems it desirable to have an independent audit and/or review by a certified public accountant of a treasurer's annual financial statements, fund balances, any other books or records and/or the accounting system.\n\nThe treasurer's duties are transferred from one individual to another within the unit or VMO.\n\nD. 4-H Annual Financial Reporting and Certification\n\nAnnual financial reporting forms will be prepared by the treasurer of the 4-H unit or VMO and forwarded to the county director* or designee at the close of the statewide 4-H YDP year (July 1-June 30) and submitted to the UCCE county office* no later than September 15th.\n\nA copy of the annual financial records shall be kept on file in the UCCE county office* for five (5) years in secure storage. See 4-H Record Retention Guidelines for duration required to keep copies of financial records.\n\nAnnual entry of financial reports for all 4-H units and VMOs into the 4-H Annual Financial Reporting System is required. The reporting consists of:\n\nForm 6.3 Annual Financial Report\n\nForm 6.2 Annual Inventory Report\n\nForm 8.5 Year-End Club Peer Review Report\n\nForm 8.6 Year-End Club Peer Review Checklist\n\nThe 4-H YDP staff must certify 4-H annual financial reporting for each 4-H unit and VMO under their authority in the 4-H Annual Financial Reporting System by November 1 of the reporting year. See Helpsheet: 4-H Unit Sign-In Steps for 4-H Financial Reporting System\n\nNon-compliance with this policy will result in loss of the 4-H charter and dissolution of the 4-H unit or VMO.\n\nXIX. Gifts from 4-H Units and VMOs\n\n4-H units and VMOs may not give cash gifts to individuals, business or organizations.\n\nNon-cash gifts may be presented to individuals, businesses or organizations for the purposes of appreciation, recognition, incentive or sympathy if it can be demonstrated that the gift benefits the 4-H YDP or is clearly necessary to the 4-H YDPs fulfillment of its role as a good community citizen. For specific limits and additional information see Gifts to Individuals Businesses or Organizations by 4-H Units and VMOs FAQ .\n\nAny use of the 4-H name and emblem is forbidden if it exploits the 4-H YDP, adult volunteers, members, USDA, Cooperative Extension, land-grant institutions or their employees.\n\nXX. Scholarships\n\n4-H units and VMOs may provide scholarships to 4-H members. See Guidelines for 4-H Premium Awards\n\nFunds for qualified educational expenses (e.g., books, tuition, other required fees) that are provided to scholarship awardees, are not taxable for the recipient.\n\nWhen scholarship awardees receive funds that may be used for nonqualified expenses, then the recipient is responsible for reporting to IRS the amount of funds received as taxable income.\n\n*When referring to the the state 4-H VMO UCCE county office and county director refer to the State 4-H Office and State 4-H YDP Director, respectively."
