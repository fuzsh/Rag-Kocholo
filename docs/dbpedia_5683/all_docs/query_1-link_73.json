        "text": "It’s a typical day at the clinic.\n\nWe typically treat the typical active population, who get the typical knee pain, which I had previously typically treated with typical interventions and exercises typically recommended by typical research.\n\n…well … until 2020 (the year when everything went haywire in the world) when I started treating typical knee pain, atypically.\n\nHere’s the:\n\nTypical Patellofemoral Pain Patient\n\nThe 20–40 active person comes in with tight knees and discomfort, perhaps an ache after working out, but it doesn’t stop them. It’s getting worse or they’re fed up. Perhaps their knees are noisy.\n\nThis person has a history of having a week full of one or more of the following: jumping, squatting, running (especially with hills), or playing a sport with a variety of those….they generally go “up and down” a lot.\n\nThere’s no history of direct trauma. They’ve tried stretching, foam rolling, massage guns, trigger points any anything else that was recommended by their gym-going peers or their search on the internet but to no prevail.\n\nThey may or may not have had received the usual “advice” that: “noisy knees means cartilage damage” “their patella is mistracking” or “maltracking”, “they have a weak VMO and/or a tight ITB”.\n\nThey may or may not have XR/MR imaging that reports “wear and tear/degeneration/osteoarthritic changes”.\n\nOn physical assessment there’s no deformities/abnormalities, they move normally, their foot posture is not outrageous — they are not “rolling in” significantly.\n\nThere’s mild to moderate pain with hopping, jumping and big step ups.\n\nThere’s mild to moderate pain with (usually 50–80%) isometric knee extension strength (basically kicking their leg up against an immovable object).\n\nThey have full knee range of motion, no pain along the joint line of their tibiofemoral joint (aka ‘The Main Knee Joint”), no history of instability, buckling or posterior knee pain.\n\nOn palpation (which is ‘science’ for: touching their bits) they usually have pain around the patella/kneecap.\n\nWe’ve ruled out (or don’t yet suspect) the following: patella dysplasia, recent/acute patellofemoral instability episode (subluxation/dislocation), any other recent trauma such as landing on the kneecap area, patella tendinopathy (which is actually very uncommon outside of an elite sports environment, unless they are a regular jumper of some sort). We don’t suspect fat pad involvement (also uncommon, but usually short-term if managed well) and we’re fairly sure the tibiofemoral joint (main knee joint) isn’t involved as there’s full range of motion there.\n\nPAUSE THE SCENARIO!\n\nWhat do you think? What do you tell them? What do you do to them? What do you recommend they do to themselves? What has the research told us over the past 20 years and how do we apply it?\n\nThat there, my friends, is the current challenge of Patellofemoral Pain (PFP), pain which refers from the Patellofemoral Joint (PFJ)\n\nRunners Knee, Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome, Patella Mistracking Syndrome, Anterior knee Pain, Anterior Knee Pain Syndrome, Patella OuchyWouchy Syndrome… whatever you call it, managing an overcooked patellofemoral joint (PFJ) is a challenge.\n\n11–17% of knee pain presentations to GPs relate to PFP (Van Middelkoop, Van Linschoten, Berger, Koes, & Bierma-Zeinstra, 2008; Wood, Muller, & Peat, 2011), and in a sports clinic setting roughly 1/3 of knee pain cases relate to PFP (Kannus, Aho, Järvinen, & Nttymäki, 1987; Taunton et al., 2002). When it comes to kids, 6–7% of the adolescents will get PFP (Mølgaard, Rathleff, & Simonsen, 2011; Michael Skovdal Rathleff, Roos, Olesen, & Rasmussen, 2015), but as will be outlined in this blogpost PFP occurs more often in active people, particularly those doing more jumping and ‘vertical tasks’ (hills/stairs), 16% of adolescent female basketballers for example (Myer et al., 2010).\n\nThere’s a bit more going on than “TIGHT ITB and WEAK VMO”, which is “tHe CAuSe oF aLL KneE ISsUeS!?” according to those who aren’t health professionals or those who are health professionals but lack the time to explain complex health conditions to patients and manage them well.\n\nOn a recent BJSM podcast it was raised as the “low back pain of the lower limb” as a statement on how little we still know about it and the challenges in managing PFP. There are so many potential nociceptive structures (things that can cause a nociceptive stimulus into the brain, the output of which is: pain) around the PFJ: Hoffas Fat pad, Patella tendon, Patella capsule, MPFL, VMO, ITB, Patella Bone, Tibial Tuberosity, Anterior Tibiofemoral joint referral… and much more.\n\nThere has been a lot of interest in the management of PFP in the past 10 years. We are fresh off a decade-long ‘bandwagon’ of suspecting “tight ITBs and weak VMOs” were causing a “patella tracking” issue… before we realised that there was more pain-free and happy people with “patella maltracking” on imaging than painful people, therefore it must be quite a normal variation (similar to the “ankle/foot pronation is a villain” narrative, which popular shoe stores still use to upsell expensive shoes).\n\nAfter we tracked away from maltracking and “foam rolling (or stretching) all the tight ITBs” (which was implausible to begin with) we moved onto Gluteus Medius as primary driver of PFP, because it shares a role of lower limb stability to avoid knee valgus (have a drink every time ‘valgus’ comes up in this post, I dare you!). Glute medius being an active force (70%) to resist dynamic valgus, and ITB/TFL being a passive restraint (30%.. or so we’re told).\n\nI started to suspect there was more to managing this condition than the above, and that hunch was confirmed once I read an in-depth blog on this condition at the www.painscience.com/ website by Paul Ingraham which spelt out what is assumed now to be ‘Fake News’, or put more subtly, misinformation/misunderstanding of the research. A great chat between Dr Bradley Neal and Greg Lehman on episode 48 of The NAF Physio Podcast discussing patellofemoral pain and knee biomechanics highlighted that we simply don’t know what’s cause and effect in the PFJ, particularly when it comes to hip adduction/knee valgus.\n\nFor me, management involving activity modification and education of this condition is crucial as patients can do as much foam rolling or stretching as they like however if they are still doing a high amount of ‘up and down’ activities in the week they’ll get nowhere.\n\nWho is the Typical PFP Patient?\n\n20–50 years of age\n\nFairly active throughout the week — likes to run, jump, hop, do gym glasses, do weights, play sports.\n\nHas Anterior (front of) knee pain\n\nFor the purposes of keeping this blog as short as possible, the following needs to be also considered however let’s assume the above ‘Typical Patient’ doesn’t have them:\n\nA recent history of instability (subluxation/dislocation)\n\nA recent history of landing on the kneecap (contusion)\n\nLocalised patella tendon pain (should be a regular athletic jumper if they do)\n\nPatella Dysplasia (including patella and trochlea dysplasia and patella alta etc)\n\nYounger pathology such as an active Osgood Schlatters/tibial tuberosity apophysitis pain\n\nThe PatelloFemoral Joint\n\nOh boy, this is a beautiful joint. I don’t know why I like it so much, it’s just… odd and complex…yet simple.\n\nThe role of the PFJ is to hold you up (stop the knee from buckling) by producing a knee extension force. Knee extension is pivotal in kicking and jumping sports and is especially challenged by up/down tasks such as incline running, heavy squats and jumping.\n\nThe key components of the PatelloFemoral Joint are:\n\nThe Patella bone and the Femoral bone…thus ‘patellofemoral’ (….. get it? these science boffins sometimes good at naming stuff!)\n\nThe Patella (Patello-)\n\n..is a floating bone suspended inside a tendon (quadriceps tendon), there’s even some fibres that are continuous through the bone which is amazing. It has two facets (flat surfaces), a medial facet (toward the body midline) and a lateral facet (away from the body midline). The lateral facet tends to take more load and demonstrate degenerative changes earlier in active people. The facets are covered in articular cartilage which help protect the bone of the patella. The patella, if viewed from above (caudal view) resembles a triangle, which fits nicely in the triangle groove of the Femoral Trochlea. This ‘nice fit’ is called ‘joint congruency’ and it’s really important for happy joints that are put under load regularly. This lovely colourful pic gives a nice representation of ‘spread of joint surface interaction’, which I discuss later.\n\nThe Femur (-femoral)\n\n..is the distal or far end of the biggest bone in the body forms the top part of the knee complex. The patella fits nicely in a groove called the ‘Femoral Trochlear Groove’, which sits between the two big ball shaped bits called the ‘Condyles’. As the colourful picture shows, the Patella glides up and down the Trochlear Groove depending on the position of the knee (different degrees of flexion). As we’ll find out later, the better the fit (joint congruency) of the patella into that groove and the more the two surface areas remain in touch the more comfortable patients with PFP are (in the absence of trauma and focal articular cartilage loss).\n\nThere’s a joint capsule (shown in blue above). There’s not much chat about joint capsules but they might be one a contributor to nociception around the PFJ.\n\nFinally, there’s a whole bunch of soft-tissues and ligaments which help stabilise the patella in the PFJ. Including the medial retinaculum MPFL (medial patellofemoral ligament, usually torn or ruptured during PFJ instability episodes) and the infamous VMO and VL/ITB complex.\n\nWhat does the PFJ do? What Loads it?\n\nApart from holding you up when you’re upright and stopping your knee from buckling under your body weight, as a part of the quadriceps-knee extension complex, the PFJ helps you go ‘up and down stuff’.\n\nA recent study (Hart et al., 2022) gives some does data on what loads the PFJ. This is shown in my graph adapted form the study below.\n\nThe more force (or mass… or acceleration ….. yes…. F=MA) the more the PFJ load.\n\nThe Hart study suggests that the PFJ is loaded with tasks that\n\n1. Have a high quads demand, and\n\n2. Are in deeper knee flexion\n\nThe Pain\n\nI have previous discussed the hip joint and how we often get ‘join referred pain’ into common but vague areas. The PFJ is similar in that it is often extremely difficult to be specific about what is causing the pain. However there are some studies which have a crack:\n\nA 2011 paper (Farrokhi, Keyak, & Powers, 2011) creatively and fortunately titled “individuals with patellofemoral pin exhibit greater patellofemoral joint stress” surprisingly found that … (wait for it) individuals with patellofemoral pain exhibit greater patellofemoral joint stress!\n\nHowever, … it’s chicken or the egg…. Does pain change the way people move and function, or does the way people move and function change the pain? So what causes the pain? These authors suggest the increased hydrostatic pressure of the joint fluid could stir up the bone-cartilage (osteochondral) interface.\n\nTwo Docs do something Dodgy\n\nLet’s probe further into what could cause pain in the knee by talking about one very cool study (albeit n=1 study) (Dye, Vaupel, & Dye, 1998)that might not pass an ethic committee today.\n\nA Surgeon and his Mate (also a surgeon) were sitting around drinking one night when he said to his mate:\n\n“Hey! What if you cut open (arthroscope) both of my knees and poke (with a spring loaded device with a 3mm tip) and all around the knee and kneecap joints (with 300–500g of pressure) and see what hurts and what doesn’t!”\n\nTo which his mate said:\n\n“Shit yes! Let’s do that!”\n\n(Legal disclaimer: This conversation may or may not have happened this way, I just like to think it did)\n\nSo a 46yo Dr Scott Dye had both his knees scoped by his mate Dr Geoff Vaupel and they poked all around the joint and this is what they found to be painful (scale 0: nothing, 4: very ouchy):\n\nThis is the sort of stuff that deserves a Nobel Prize ala Australian Dr Barry Marshal winning a Nobel Prize for swallowing gastic ulcer-causing Helicobacter Pylori bacteria.\n\nFor the past several years I was thinking that a distension of the joint capsule due to increased fluid inside the PFJ may contribute to that vague feeling of “tightness” around the joint, however I’ve recently pulled back from that idea in favour of the feeling of tightness and other symptoms being a ‘non-specific joint referral’, I’ve written more about ‘Non-Specific Joint Referrals’ here.\n\nSelf-Limiting\n\nUnlike the tibiofemoral joint (or the “main knee joint”), the PFP is “self-limiting” in that it resolves over time, and those who have it can (and do) push through a fair bit of discomfort and it often doesn’t stop them doing tasks until it gets really stirred up.\n\nHowever, just because it doesn’t stop the patients doesn’t mean they aren’t affected. A 2 year follow up of adolescents with PFP found that a quarter of them had PFP over that 2 years and it affected their performance in sports and also their quality of life (Michael S Rathleff, Rathleff, Olesen, Rasmussen, & Roos, 2016). Clinically, we see many adults in their 20s and 30s who suffer have suffered from PFP for years, many report they arrive reporting a “lifelong disability” affecting their knees making stairs/jumping/squats activities very uncomfortable (at best) and painful (at worst). Fortunately the majority of these have simply been mismanaged (ITB stretches and isolated VMO exercises probably) and have potential to settle.\n\nSome patients have developed a irrational fear about the sounds and feelings around their knees, especially the Crunchy or Clicky knee:\n\nThe Crunchy Knee — Patellofemoral Creptius\n\nThe Wonderful Claire Robertson, aka ‘Claire Patella’ who is a UK Physiotherapist has some fantastic resources on Cracking or Crunchy knees which we call ‘Crepitus’.\n\nThe summary is, you can have noisy knees without pain, you can have quiet knees with pain and you can be anywhere in between, but you shouldn’t let your noisy ‘crunchy’ knees worry you if you are active and not getting too much Patellofemoral Pain, it’s not necessarily a sign of joint damage. See an experienced registered healthcare professional for assessment if you have concerns.\n\nFor more on this, here is a nice blog on Tom Goom’s (Running-physio.com) webpage by Clare: https://www.running-physio.com/crepitus/\n\nWhat have we been doing about it the last 20 years\n\nPatella “Maltracking”\n\nA quick search on google will suggest you have a “tight ITB” and/or a “weak VMO” which may be causing “patella maltracking” and you need to “lengthen your ITB” with foam rolling or deep tissue massage and “strengthen your VMO” with VMO exercises.\n\nYou can use ‘McConnell Taping’ to pull the kneecap back across so it’s ‘in alignment’ (*SHUDDER*.. I hate that word). However, there may be some other reasons why McConnell’s taping works and it has nothing to do with pulling it medially… but more to do with compressing the patella back into the groove, or getting as much of the two joint surfaces in touch with each other, Mike Reinold has a nice blog on that here.\n\nAll of the above “Patella Maltracking from tight ITB and weak VMO” is simply an outdated concept (for insidious onset PFP in the absence of trauma and instability) and yes even I was doing this ‘patella maltracking’ stuff back in the mid 2010s. Everyone was on a foam roller and doing isolated VMO exercises in my clinic. Fortunately I’ve unlearned and evolved as a Clinician.\n\nSo is it just quads weakness then?\n\nSo if it isn’t VMO it must just be weakness of the Knee Extensors (quads) as a group that causes PFP, that’s just commons sense right?\n\nPerhaps.\n\nFor a while there I was testing knee extension “strength” of my PFP patients and if the affected knee was weaker I’d say:\n\n“AH HA! Weak Quads, that’s why you have PFP!”\n\nBut then one must consider two words, which can be simplified into four words.\n\nArthrogenic Inhibition, …..or “OUCHY JOINT, WEAKY MUSCLE”\n\n‘Arthr’ = joint, ‘genic’ = from there, ‘inhibition’ = unable to work normally… so the joint is causing nearby things not work normally.\n\n5 years ago I would have said the majority of PFP patients I saw had weak quads causing PFP, but now I say the majority have PFP causing weak quads, and if we reduce PFP via other means we don’t increase the strength of the knee extensors, we DIS-inhibit them… we just allow them to work normally.\n\nThere are still some less common 1-in 50–100ish cases (in my clinical experience) that have a knee extension weakness causing PFP, interestingly these are often knee extension weakness secondary to other conditions that are lumbar spine or hip joint based.\n\nPlanes and Interventions\n\nAnother way to look the last 10–20 years of patellofemoral management is to visualise the interventions and how what forces they apply to the patella in terms of whether it is Sagittal Plane or Frontal Plane forces.\n\nThe bread and butter of the PFP management up until around 2010–2015 was focused on “patella tracking” and avoiding a lateral patellar force, best achieved by taping (direction doesn’t matter), VMO strengthening (can’t isolate it) and ITB rolling (to “lengthen it” — virtually impossible).\n\nSince then the value of ‘sucking the kneecap into the groove’ with a sagital plane-compression force via quads ‘strengthening’/knee extension force production, and taping to hold the kneecap in the groove (sagital) rather than pulling it to the side (frontal) seems to have a higher value in keeping the kneecap joint happy.\n\nAnother proposed contributer to ‘adverse’ sagittal front plane patellar forces is dynamic and forceful ‘Valgus’.\n\nGluteus Medius and the Battle against Valgus\n\nHip joint adduction and internal rotation movement during running, squatting and stair tasks is suggested to increase compressive loads at the PFJ, allegedly due to “poor gluteal function”.\n\nHowever, this concept was founded from one study that focused on young female runners and the results weren’t that conclusive (Powers, 2010), further studies have shown only short-term effects only from targeting hip abductors/lateral rotators with ‘strength’ exercises (Fukuda et al., 2012) and recent reviews have even reported a lack of hip strength isn’t even predictive of developing PFP (Michael Skovdal Rathleff, Rathleff, Crossley, & Barton, 2014).\n\nSo does Hip Abductor weakness lead to pain? Or does pain lead to weakness (ie ‘Inhibition’) and hip muscle strength isn’t the magic bullet to target PFP (Thijs, Pattyn, Van Tiggelen, Rombaut, & Witvrouw, 2011).\n\nTo further debunk the “you only need to target posterolateral hip muscles for PFP reduction” concept a crafty and high quality study randomised 52 women with PFP into:\n\nA posterolateral hip strength group (the traditional abductors and external rotators) and,\n\nThe other group did the complete opposite, anteromedial hip strength (adductors and internal rotators)\n\n….and guess what?! They found that both groups showed improvement and there was no difference between the groups (Almeida, das Neves Rodrigues, Coelho, Rodrigues, & de Paula Lima, 2021).\n\nSo in summary, there is benefit to providing Hip Strength exercises for Patellofemoral pain and it doesn’t have to be specific.\n\nThe Consensus\n\nThe 2016 Patellofemoral pain consensus statement from the 4th International Patellofemoral Pain Research Retreat (Crossley et al., 2016) and more recently a living (…. on the living.. not the dead) systematic review with network meta-analysis (Winters et al., 2021) found that the most effective treatment for PFP is a combination of :\n\n1. Education\n\n2. Exercise (hip-based and knee-based)\n\n3. Patellar Taping (Winters et al. included Patella Mobilisation here, Crossley et al. didn’t recommend it), and\n\n4. Foot Orthoses (off the shelf).\n\nOne big thing missing here in my opinion: education and activity modification, which in my experience has been crucial. Even though they mention ‘education’ I dug deeper into the Winters et al 2021 article in a previous blogpost and I found that their source for ‘education’.\n\nThe education was focused on the valgus knee-postures with activities, so presumably patients can continue doing everything with less valgus? In other words, ‘internal loads’ (postures, weaknesses, flexibility, joint tracking) are the focus and ‘external loads’ (activities, load) are lost in the noise”.\n\nEven though the “education” in the above bar graph is low in effective management, sometimes education and activity modificaiton (dialling back up & downs) is all I do and they still get better.\n\nMy Thoughts\n\nPFJ Referral Patterns\n\nMost PFP I see refers around the medial side of the patella (90% of patellofemoral patients), but some get lateral sided pain (lateral to the patella, not the tibiofemoral joint). I often find that the lateral sided patellofemoral pain are the patients who’ve had a history of trauma such as PFJ instability (subluxation/dislocation) or at the other end of the spectrum they are the “very gradual loaders” (eg: long-distance runners) who’ve hit a physiological ceiling in joint metabolism (the joint simply can’t take another kilometre on an inclined treadmill on the 45year old knee). However, PFP can refer anywhere around the kneecap.\n\nPatella Tendinopathy.. or is it?\n\nI get it… everyone wants a cool Tendinopathy to rehab. We spend hours learning about them on weekend Sports Rehab courses. However, true Patella Tendinopathy is rare in the main active population.\n\nUnfortunately, many “Patella Tendinopathy” second opinions walk into my clinic and ask me for my thoughts and assessment for their “Jumpers Knee” or “Patella Tendinopathy” and the first thing I ask is “are you a professional jumper?” (volleyball, basketball) or ask if they do anything hard and fast change-of-direction tasks… usually not.\n\nUsually these “patella tendon” patients are in fact inferior referring PFJs. Superiorly referring PFJs cause a feeling of “tightness” in the distal quadriceps area (just superior to the PFJ), I have seen patients for second opinions who have been prescribed stretches for this “tightness”, of course, to no effect.\n\nWhat if it isn’t the knee?\n\nEvery knee pain patient, especially those with longer term pain, should get their hip joints cleared for hip joint referred pain, which can refer into the thigh, the ITB area and the anterior knee (and as far as the foot).\n\nThis will typically present as a deep, vague, and difficult to find ache in the area. I had it once, it felt like I had been “tapped on the balls”, a very mild kick in the nuts, but in my knee. (Testicular pain, for those grown-ups who had no idea what I was talking about).\n\nHip joints are very easy to rule out (or consider as less likely). Perform a FADIR test. Any patient with even a mildly cranky hip joint will get stirred up.\n\nFinally, I had once case where persistent patellofemoral knee pain (with a marked weakness of the quads) was from a L3 spinal nerve root stenosis/impingement. Clear the lumbar spine in long-term cases.\n\nMy Abandoned ‘Effusion Model of Pain’\n\nI used to think much of the patellofemoral pain I saw in the clinic was related to a PFJ effusion as a result of a load to an underconditioned joint surface that leads to ‘leaking’, 24–48hrs after loading.\n\nI’d educate the patient on ‘Conditioning’ using a metaphor of ‘blister vs callous’ and how we want to callous up the joint surface with gradual loading so it can tolerate load and avoid too much too son otherwise we’ll get a ‘blister’ and get too much fluid.\n\nI’d hypothesise that the Joint Capsule of the PFP would get distended with an effusion and as it is highly innervated this would be the cause of the majority of the PFP. This was a nice narrative for both myself (clinician) and my patients, it helped explain the distribution of the symptoms and also made sense with management (more fluid out vs more fluid in), but it’s not exactly correct.\n\nNon-Specific Joint Pain\n\nMore often than not we actually may not know what exact structure inside the PFJ is causing pain, thus the non-specific diagnosis of “Patellofemoral Pain” (+ syndrome….).\n\nThis is what I now give to patients to explain their PFP.\n\nEssentially, I tell them, “you have a cranky knee-cap joint and you are getting knee-cap joint referred pain and/or tightness, what exactly is causing the pain we* don’t know, however it doesn’t change the initial management”\n\n*we… as in the ‘Medical World’ or the ‘Research World’…. I like to share the blame…as well as the credit. 😊\n\nEducation and Activity Modification\n\nIt is vital that the patient fully understands what loads the joint and exercise they can continue without stirring it up further.\n\nThere has been too much focus on correcting ‘internal load’ (tissue tightness, joint maltracking) and targeting interventions to that (exercise therapy) and not enough attention on ‘external load’ or what the patient has done to themselves, with advice and education on load management/activity modification (M. Rathleff, 2016). This problem of focusing solely on managing ‘internal load’ isn’t unique to PFP, it has been to focus of treatment of low back pain (core stability, flexibility, foot/ankle overpronation) and also other tricky conditions such as Tennis Elbow for decades. Not only does this focus ignore what the patient is doing to themselves throughout the week, but it also sells a narrative of the patient being “fragile” (weak) or “deformed” (tightness).\n\nExternal Load — Managing the Ups and the Downs\n\nI spend a good chunk of the initial assessment with PFP patients identifying all the ‘up and downs’ in their life.\n\nUnless the PFP is particularly bad (see below for what I class as bad) I encourage the patient to continue all physical activities that are relatively flat, whilst temporarily reducing ‘up and down’ activities (particularly jumping and incline/decline tasks).\n\nMy Assessment\n\nI have some main assessment items that I track with PFP patients.\n\nIsolated PFP that is mild-moderate may have no loss of pain-free range of motion (ROM), the cranky PFP knees will often get 0–100 without any issues before a broad anterior knee “tightness” or pain.\n\nApart from functional items (pain with walk, squat, run, hop and jump) I pay particularly attention the following:\n\n1. Up/Down Assessment — Steps → Hopping\n\nStepping up on a small step (20–30cm), and if pain-free stepping up on a standard bench or chair (50cm), and seeing if there is pain. If there is no pain, I will then do a Step Down test, where they step down from a bench with their GOOD foot, leaving the knee with anterior knee pain behind. In my clinical experience I find that if a patient can produce 80% pain-free knee extension force compared with their good knee they can complete this test pain-free.\n\n2. Pain-free Knee Extension Force (PF-KEF)\n\nI measure the patients pain-free knee extension force at 20deg flexion (supine with foam roller under knee) and 90deg flexion (sitting on side of bed) in a ‘make’ isometric test (holding a handheld dynamometer still and getting them to “push into me as hard as is comfortable or until you feel pain”. If I have a high-needs patient (aka Athletic) I’ll also measure PF-KEF at 60deg knee flexion. The research-boffins suggest that an isometric test is valid 20deg in either direction so 20 is 0–40, 60 is 40–80, and 90 is 70–110), but I think that is a rough guide and not set in stone.\n\nI record the results as a % averaged across the testing positions\n\nEg: Left knee painful, Right knee good.\n\nL/R PF-KEF20: 40/50 (80%)\n\nL/R PF-KEF90: 30/40 (75%)\n\n75+80/2 = 77.5%\n\nYes, ideally if I had all the dollar$ I’d have an isokinetic dynamometer, however I don’t have all the dollar$ so I’ll make do with a not-as-valid-yet-good-enough-but-still-very-expensive handheld dynamometer.\n\nWhat sort of values am I looking in the patient depends on whether they’re athletic or not-athletic, and it also depends on their body weight. Here is a very rough guide to some normative values based on my experience :\n\nWhat’s nice about the table above is there’s too variables you can play with. You can increase force production or the patient can lose weight.\n\nHere is my rough guide for how to proceed based on the assessment, using the difference of PF-KEF between affected and unaffected side:\n\nWhat’s great with the above table is that ‘up/down assessment’ can be done via telehealth/online consults.. or even given as a guide to patients to help them self-manage and make good decisions about sports/exercise on a week by week basis.\n\nOver time as their PF-KEF improves I’ll gradually bring in more and more ‘up and down’ tasks depending on whatever it is the patient is getting back to.\n\nRehab — Hip and Knee Interventions\n\nAs mentioned above, the current consensus is that prescription of BOTH hip and knee based resistance exercises are effective in the management of Patellofemoral pain.\n\nWe have one study that showed that this doesn’t have to be specific around the hip, so fill your boots with your favourite hip exercises (eg: glutes), however for knee based exercises I would add the following, particularly in the rare situation when there is a knee extension weakness contributing to ongoing PFP.\n\nFor the patient in front of you, test out different “quads strength” exercises and find 2–3 that makes the patient feel it in their quads, not their knee."
