        "text": "MESSAGE BOARD\n\nElection 2000\n\n(CNN) -- Republicans will retain an even narrower majority in the next House of Representatives than their current razor-thin advantage over Democrats -- raising questions whether either side can claim a clear mandate from a divided American electorate.\n\nIncumbents of both parties fared well on Election Night. With a few House races still undecided late Wednesday, CNN projects Republicans had won 220 seats; Democrats 211 seats; and independents 2 seats.\n\nA majority in the 435-seat House requires at least 218 seats.\n\nBoth parties were closely tuned to recount efforts in New Jersey and Florida. In the Sunshine State's 22nd District, Republican Rep. Clay Shaw Jr. and Democrat Elaine Bloom remained deadlocked late Wednesday. Senior issues dominated the battle for the district, a narrow 91-strip along the Atlantic Coast from Fort Lauderdale to Palm Beach\n\nA winner has also not yet been declared in New Jersey's 12th District, where freshman Democratic Rep. Rush Holt faced a strong challenge from Republican Dick Zimmer, who gave up the seat in 1996 for a Senate run.\n\nAlthough all 435 members of the House were up for re-election, control of the lower chamber hinged on the outcome of a relatively small number of competitive races -- particularly for 26 seats vacated by retiring Republicans, and nine others left open by Democrats.\n\nRepublicans successfully defended nearly all their open seats, while most strong Democratic challenges to GOP incumbents never fully materialized. Before Tuesday, most analysts agreed that Democrats needed to pick up three or four seats heading toward California, where a handful of GOP lawmakers were deemed most vulnerable.\n\nRep. Tom Davis of Virginia, chairman of the Republican National Congressional Committee, said Democrats lost a \"once-in-a-generation\" chance to reclaim the House, citing potential retirements and the fact that state legislatures, dominated by Republicans, will oversee the redrawing of districts over the next two years.\n\nThe election outcome marks the first time since the 1920s that Republicans have held the House for four consecutive congressional sessions. But the even narrower working margin for Republicans in the 106th Congress also gave Democrats reason for hope.\n\n\"These recounts will determine how much of a pick-up that we will have,\" said Democratic National Committee Chairman Joe Andrew. \"We're going to continue to be in very good position in the United States Congress, not only in this year, but also going into the year 2002 as well.\"\n\nImpeachment manager defeated\n\nRepublicans picked up Michigan's 8th Congressional District seat, where GOP state Sen. Mike Rogers defeated Democratic state Rep. Dianne Byrum. Outside groups had spent heavily on the seat, currently held by Rep. Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat who opted to run for the U.S. Senate.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, picked up the 4th Congressional District seat in Arkansas, where incumbent Republican Rep. Jay Dickey lost to Democratic challenger Mike Ross.\n\nDemocrats managed to win competitive races in Utah and California; they picked up five seats in the Golden State. In Utah's 2nd District, Jim Matheson defeated GOP businessman Derek Smith, CNN estimates. Matheson will replace GOP Rep. Merrill Cook, who lost to Smith in the GOP primary.\n\nAnd efforts to win California's 15th District appear to have paid off with a win for Democrat labor loyalist Mike Honda over moderate GOP candidate Jim Cunneen, CNN projects. Honda will replace GOP Rep. Tom Campbell, who unsuccessfully challenged Sen. Dianne Feinstein.\n\nDemocrats savored the defeat of Rep. Jim Rogan, a California Republican who served as one of the House managers who presented the case for President Clinton's impeachment to the Senate in 1999.\n\nCNN estimates that California state Sen. Adam Schiff beat Rogan in the 27th District contest, which covers the Pasadena area. Schiff received more votes than Rogan in the state's open March primary in a district that has become increasingly Democratic as a result of recent demographic changes.\n\nHastert: 'We're in pretty good shape'\n\nDespite the late pickups, Democrats fell short of gaining the eight seats needed to regain the majority they lost in 1994.\n\n\"Overall we have not seen that many seats that changed hands one way or the other, and Republicans did surprisingly well in the East, enough to offset any late Democratic advantage in the West,\" said CNN political analyst Stuart Rothenberg.\n\nTwo of those Republican gains came in Connecticut and Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania state Sen. Melissa Hart defeated state Rep. Terry Van Horne in the 4th District. And in Connecticut, GOP candidate Rob Simmons scored an upset in the 2nd District over 10-term Rep. Sam Gejdenson, CNN projects.\n\nDemocrats also lost their bid to pick up Illinois' 10th District, where the GOP's Mark Kirk, a former aide to retiring Rep. John Porter, narrowly defeated Lauren Beth Gash, a popular state representative.\n\n\"I think we're in pretty good shape,\" said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Illinois. \"It may be a very tight majority, but it's going to be a majority.\"\n\nUnderscoring that point, Republicans picked up a Democratic seat in Missouri's 6th District, where state Rep. Steve Graves defeated Democratic candidate Steve Danner. The GOP also won New York's 1st District, where Republican nominee Felix Grucci defeated Democrat Regina Seltzer, who defeated party-switcher Rep. Mike Forbes in the primary.\n\nAnd in Virginia's 2nd District, GOP state Sen. Edward Schrock defeated Democratic lawyer Jody Wagner for another Republican gain. Conservative Democrat Owen Pickett is retiring after serving the district, centered around Virginia Beach, for 14 years.\n\nDem pickups few and far between\n\nIn addition to Democratic gains in California and Utah, the party picked up GOP Rep. Rick Lazio's 2nd District seat in New York. Democrat Steve Israel defeated Republican Joan Johnson, who was vying to become the first Republican African-American female to serve in the House.\n\nDemocrats also gained a seat in Oklahoma's 2nd Congressional District, where CNN projects that attorney Brad Carson defeated auto dealer Andy Ewing, the GOP nominee.\n\nWhen all is said and done, both political parties will have lavished tens of millions of dollars on the competitive House races. Special interest groups -- ranging from unions to pharmaceutical companies -- also dropped millions in soft money donations in a bid to sway voters.\n\nHeading into the election, Republicans held a 13-seat margin over the Democrats in the House, 223-210, and two seats were held by independents.\n\nThe reason those numbers changed only slightly can be attributed to the power of incumbency.\n\nA number of districts have voted solidly Republican or Democratic for decades. Even in suburban areas with large numbers of classic \"swing voters,\" sitting congressmen took advantage of greater name recognition and fund-raising.\n\nWith no overarching issue dominating the political agenda this year, House campaigns instead focused on a number of issues: Social Security, prescription drug coverage for Medicare seniors, education, gun laws, abortion and the environment.\n\nThe \"character\" issue has also played out in a number of races, including a handful of districts where Democrats originally set their sights on ousting the 13 impeachment managers, or prosecutors, during the 1998-99 presidential impeachment saga.\n\nIncumbents triumph in Midwest\n\nRepublicans countered strong Democratic challenges in Indiana and Ohio. In the Buckeye State's 12th District, state Rep. Pat Tiberi defeated Democrat Maryellen O'Shaughnessy. The seat is currently held by retiring Republican Rep. John Kasich, chairman of the House Budget Committee.\n\nIndiana Republican John Hostettler had faced the toughest race of his career in Indiana's 8th District, but CNN estimates he has defeated Democrat Dr. Paul Perry.\n\nVoters in the \"Bloody Eighth\" have a long history of throwing incumbents out of office, but Hostettler's positions on taxes and abortion seem to have played well to the mostly rural district.\n\nFive-term Democratic Rep. Tim Roemer is projected to stave off a challenge from GOP business executive Chris Chocolla in Indiana's 3rd District. Although the northern Indiana district has consistently voted for GOP presidential candidates, Roemer has yet to be seriously threatened on Election Day.\n\nCNN also estimates Republicans will retain the seat in Missouri's 2nd District, where state Rep. Todd Akin defeated Democratic state Sen. Ted House. Akin, a conservative best known for his opposition to legal gambling in the state, will replace Republican Rep. Jim Talent, who, CNN estimates, lost his bid for governor.\n\nDemocrats held on to a seat in Minnesota's 4th District, where Democrat state Rep. Betty McCollum defeated GOP state Sen. Linda Runbeck and independent Tom Foley.\n\nIn the state's 6th District, three-term Democratic Rep. Bill Luther held off a strong challenge from former Marine Col. John Kline, a Republican who narrowly lost to Luther in 1998.\n\nIn Kansas, freshman Democratic Rep. Dennis Moore beat back a strong challenge from conservative GOP state legislator Phill Kline in the 3rd District, CNN projects. As he did in 1998, Moore appears to have taken advantage of a bitter GOP primary between moderate and conservative factions of the party.\n\nThe East; New England\n\nIn Pennsylvania, freshman Republican Rep. Don Sherwood defeated Democrat Pat Casey in the 10th District, CNN projected. Sherwood edged Casey by just 515 votes during their 1998 contest.\n\nThe 15th District contest saw freshman Republican Rep. Patrick Toomey stave off Democrat Ed O'Brien.\n\nIn Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District, freshman Democratic Rep. Joe Hoeffel fended off a strong challenge from moderate GOP candidate Stewart Greenleaf.\n\nIn New Jersey, Republican Mike Ferguson defeated Democrat Maryanne Connelly in the 7th District. Ferguson will replace Republican Rep. Bob Franks, who was defeated in his Senate bid.\n\nThree-term incumbent GOP Rep. Charlie Bass will retain his 2nd District New Hampshire seat over Democratic challenger Barney Brannen. Bass won by slim margins in this western New Hampshire district in 1996 and 1998.\n\nIn Connecticut's 5th District, Democratic Rep. Jim Maloney defeated Republican challenger Mark Nielsen.\n\nDeep South\n\nIn Georgia, three-term Republican Rep. Saxby Chambliss held off a challenge from Democrat Jim Marshall in the 8th Congressional District. In the 7th District, former House impeachment manager Rep. Bob Barr defeated wealthy Democratic challenger Roger Kahn.\n\nMississippi freshman Democratic Rep. Ronnie Shows will retain his 4th District seat with a win over GOP challenger Dunn Lampton. In neighboring Alabama, Republican incumbent Rep. Robert Aderholt staved off a challenge from Democrat Marsha Folsom in the state's 4th District.\n\nRepublicans also held the open seat in Florida's 12th District, where 26-year-old state Rep. Adam Putnam defeated Democrat Mike Stedem. In the state's 3rd District, four-term Democratic Rep. Corrine Brown held off a challenge from Republican Jennifer Carroll.\n\nRepublican attorney Ric Keller won a hotly contested race in Florida's 8th district over Democrat Linda Chapin. Trailing his opponent after a bitter and divisive GOP primary, Keller gained momentum during the closing weeks of the campaign.\n\nIn a rematch of the 1998 showdown in North Carolina's 8th Congressional District, Republican incumbent Rep. Robin Hayes again defeated Democrat Mike Taylor. Hayes, heir to a fortune earned in the region's textile industry, edged Taylor by less than 3,500 votes in 1998.\n\nIn North Carolina's 11th District, incumbent GOP Rep. Charles Taylor beat back a strong challenge from Democrat Sam Neill. The Democrats were hoping for an upset, as Taylor had been hounded by a much-publicized row with local tax collectors and Neill had successfully pounded him on delivering for seniors.\n\nTexas, Kentucky\n\nIn Texas, Republican Rep. Ron Paul fought off a challenge from Democratic candidate Loy Sneary in the 14th District, a rural area between Houston and Austin. In the state's 5th District, Republican Rep. Pete Sessions defeated Democratic challenger Regina Montaya.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ken Bentsen held off a well-financed challenge from Republican Phil Sudan in Texas' 25th District.\n\nRepublicans also successfully defended three competitive seats in the battleground state of Kentucky. In the 1st District, three-term incumbent GOP Rep. Ed Whitfield defeated Democratic challenger Brian Roy.\n\nRepublican Rep. Anne Northup fended off Democratic challenger Eleanor Jordan, an African-American, in Kentucky's 3rd District. Northup's phenomenal fund-raising abilities and savvy political skills have helped her hold on to the Democratic-leaning district since 1996.\n\nFreshman GOP Rep. Ernie Fletcher defeated former Democratic Rep. Scotty Baesler in Kentucky's 6th District. The outcome of this race is a reversal of 1996, when Baesler defeated Fletcher.\n\nThe West\n\nIn Colorado's 6th District, freshman Republican Rep. Tom Tancredo defeated Democratic challenger Ken Tolz.\n\nIn Montana's at-large House race, former Lt. Gov. Dennis Rehbreg will hold the seat for the Republicans. He defeated Democrat Nancy Keenan, the state superintendent of education.\n\nIn Washington state's 9th District, freshman Democratic Rep. Adam Smith staved off a closely watched challenge from Republican Chris Vance. The booming area south of Seattle includes thousands of Boeing workers, who contribute to a solid Democratic base."
