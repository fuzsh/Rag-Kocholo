        "text": "When John Engler was appointed Michigan State University's interim president, it was his strong-arm tactics that helped win him the job.\n\nHis quick decisions and brash personality helped ram much-needed changes through usually slow-moving university channels as MSU faced massive fallout from ex-doctor Larry Nassar’s sexual abuse of hundreds of patients.\n\nBut those same qualities led to confrontation with survivors, stymied the university's healing process and led to what one university trustee called a \"reign of terror.\"\n\nEngler’s latest remarks, in which he indicated Nassar victims are ‘enjoying’ the spotlight,\" was the final straw. MSU Board Chairwoman Dianne Byrum obtained Engler’s resignation Wednesday and the board held an emergency meeting Thursday morning to name his replacement.\n\nWhile Engler was hired to clean up the Nassar scandal, he’s “in essence thrown gas on a fire” in his interactions with Nassar survivors, said Trustee Brian Mosallam, who called for Engler’s ouster months ago. “There’s been an utter disregard in tone when it comes to compassion and empathy.”\n\nSince Engler was named interim president on Jan. 31, he's faced outcry from several controversial statements including:\n\nAccusing survivor Rachael Denhollander of taking kickbacks in an email\n\nAllegedly offering another victim $250,000 to drop her lawsuit in a private meeting\n\n•Shutting down a ‘healing fund’ designed to pay for counseling for Nassar victims\n\nCanceling a special edition of the MSU alumni magazine dedicated to Nassar survivors.\n\nTo many, Engler’s actions are tangible evidence Michigan State is still floundering despite a multitude of promises to reform in the wake of the Nassar scandal.\n\n“Watching MSU from the beginning of this, it seems like a circular firing squad,\" said Tom Watkins, an MSU alumnus, former Michigan school superintendent during the Engler administration. \"And every time we think we’re past it, we’re not. Nobody seems to get it.”\n\nTo others, including Dianne Byrum and Dan Kelly, chair and vice chair of the MSU Board of Trustees, the situation is more complex.\n\nOn one hand, Byrum has been publicly critical of Engler. In a recent interview, she characterized some of Engler’s interactions with the Nassar survivors as “hurtful and destructive.\" She joined Mosallam in urging for Engler’s ouster in June, and she called Engler on Wednesday and told him to either resign or face being fired.\n\nBut Byrum also credits Engler for being a driving force behind changes at the university over the past year, which has included new leadership in all the departments directly impacted by the Nassar scandal and a long list of initiatives around sexual assault prevention and improving resources for victims.\n\n\"We made multiple and significant changes across the university at a very quick pace,” Byrum said. \"Policies and procedures, new directions, new departments, reorganizations, hiring for new positions, removal of certain individuals -- this has been the fastest set of changes in Michigan State University’s history, if you look at what’s happened over the past 12 months.”\n\nKelly said that a lot of the changes at MSU has occurred at Engler’s “insistence and pushing.”\n\nBut, he added, Engler’s “interactions with the survivors and what appears to be his adversarial approach to the survivors, I don’t agree with at all.”\n\nMorgan McCaul, a Nassar survivor who is now a sophomore at University of Michigan, says it’s hard to applaud MSU for the changes that it has made when the top leader has been so disparaging of Nassar survivors.\n\n“While Michigan State has made positive changes,” McCaul said, “it’s coming from a source that victims distrust.”\n\nByrum agreed.\n\n“John Engler is not the right messenger,\" she said. “The missteps on his interactions with the survivors have been very problematic and they’ve been self-inflicted, unnecessary wounds that have created more headlines, more drama that should not have happened.\n\n‘In a free fall’\n\nEngler is now the second MSU president forced out over the Nassar controversy.\n\nLack of empathy towards the Nassar survivors is what led to President Lou Anna Simon’s resignation on Jan. 24, 2018. She stepped down hours after the conclusion of a week-long sentencing hearing for Nassar, during which 156 women detailed their abuse by the former MSU doctor. Two days later, Athletic Director Mark Hollis resigned.\n\n“From a board perspective, it felt like Michigan State was in a free fall and we didn’t know where the bottom was,” Byrum said.\n\n“Lou Anna had left. The board had no confidence in Bob Noto (the university’s legal counsel). We had eight investigations staring us in the face,\" Byrum said. “That was the backdrop against which John Engler was hired.”\n\nBetween the Nassar lawsuits, the various investigations and need to make some immediate reforms, the board agreed that time was of the essence in choosing a new leader. They needed someone immediately available. They also needed someone with administrative experience, a take-charge person. Preferably, someone with political experience since MSU is a public university and state lawmakers were threatening to cut its funding as punishment for the Nassar scandal.\n\nEngler, 70, fit those qualifications. Michigan’s governor from 1991 to 2003, he had just retired from the presidency of the Business Roundtable, a national association of chief executive officers. He was a Republican, which trustees thought would be helpful in dealing with a GOP-majority Legislature and Congress.\n\n“And there’s one thing I will always say about John Engler,” said Byrum, who was a Democratic state lawmaker when Engler was governor. “Love him or hate him, he’s decisive, and he will look you in the eye and tell you the decision he has made and he will implement it.”\n\nIn interview with MLive last week, Engler said he got the call as he and his wife were preparing to move from the Washington, D.C. area to her home state of Texas, where they were building a retirement home.\n\nMoving back to Michigan “was not something we were looking to do,” Engler said. “But I made no secret of my affection for Michigan State, and I was available, so I said yes.”\n\nNew controversy\n\nFrom the start, Engler’s appointment was controversial.\n\nOne factor, no doubt, is that Engler’s 12 years as governor are not recalled fondly by Democrats, of which there are many on the Michigan State campus. But the bigger issue was the board’s haste in making the appointment without seeking outside input.\n\nIn Engler’s first days on the job, more than 200 MSU staff and students participated in a protest march, calling for Engler and the MSU board to resign; the MSU Council of Graduate Students voted “no confidence” in the board based on the Engler appointment, and the MSU Faculty Senate passed a similar resolution by a vote of 61-4.\n\nEngler wasn’t rattled. As governor, he was known for his imperviousness to criticism, and that continued at MSU.\n\n“I don’t take it personal,” he said.\n\nInstead, Engler quickly flashed his take-charge credentials.\n\nA spokesman gave interviews saying that MSU had made mistakes in handling the Nassar situation and reforms were needed to ensure such a scandal would never happen again -- the first time Michigan State administration had made such acknowledgements.\n\nIn his first week, Engler announced his intent to revoke the tenure of William Strampel, the former dean of the College of Osteopathic Medicine and Nassar’s former boss. “The fact that he was still here -- I was saying, this was unacceptable,” Engler told MLive last week. “We didn’t just let him retire quietly.”\n\nEngler also quickly pushed through other changes. By the end of February 2018, MSU’s legal counsel, its lead lobbyist and its head spokesman had all resigned. Engler also recruited Robert Young, a retired Michigan Supreme Court chief justice, to negotiate a financial settlement with the hundreds of Nassar survivors suing the university. A Relationship Violence and Sexual Misconduct Expert Advisory Workgroup was formed to advise MSU administration on how address the issue of sexual abuse.\n\n“I described Michigan State as all these burning platforms. We needed to get right to work,” Engler told MLive.\n\n“Part of that was what was going on with the lives of survivors and their families, but also the legal sense, the tremendous amount of litigation the university was facing and calls for all kind of people to be fired and all kinds of investigations to be held,” Engler said.\n\nThere also was a need for structural reform within the university, he said. It was clear that in such a scandal, \"you better learn from your mistakes and you damn well better fix them and you better build in systems and protocols so what happened before can never happen again. And you need to think hard about things that didn’t happen but could if you’re not probably prepared and holding people accountable.\n\n“So there a lot of things that I thought needed to be changed, and there’s a lot of different aspects to that,” he said.\n\n(In the interactive graphic below, you can put your cursor over a category to get more details on leadership changes as well as changes in specific departments, click the dots for more. The bottom link provides a summary of changes in sexual abuse prevention and resources for victims.)\n\nPerhaps the most noteworthy accomplishment during Engler’s tenure was coming to a $500 million settlement with the Nassar plaintiffs. Announced in May, the university financed the settlement through bonding and paid the money in early December.\n\nMissteps\n\nBut even as Engler voiced the mantra of “culture change,” he repeatedly undermined that message, particularly in his interactions with Nassar survivors.\n\nIn April, Kaylee Lorincz -- a Nassar survivor who addressed the board at their April meeting -- obtained a private meeting with Engler, in which she hoped to share her story to him and push for the survivors' involvement in reform efforts.\n\nAccording to Lorincz, Engler said that MSU couldn’t work with survivors until the lawsuits were settled.\n\n“Mr. Engler then looked directly at me and asked, ‘Right now, if I wrote you a check for $250,000 would you take it?’” Lorincz told the Detroit Free Press. “When I explained that it’s not about the money for me and that I just want to help, he said, ‘Well give me a number.’ He also said that he had met with Rachael Denhollander and that she gave him a number.”\n\nDenhollander, the first Nassar victim to go public, denied speaking with Engler about money and told the Free Press she was “horrified, absolutely disgusted” that Engler would suggest otherwise.\n\n“He lied to a sexual assault survivor to get what he wanted,” Denhollander told the Free Press. “That’s what Larry (Nassar) did.”\n\nSoon, a second controversy erupted when the Free Press and Chronicle of Higher Education obtained emails between Engler and MSU Vice President and Special Counsel to the President Carol Viventi.\n\nIn a April 15 email, Engler wrote: “The survivors now are being manipulated by trial lawyers who in the end will each get millions of dollars more than any of individual survivors with the exception of Denhollander who is likely to get kickback from Manley for her role in the trial lawyer manipulation.”\n\nDenhollander was furious, and so were her allies. In response to Engler’s accusation of “kickbacks,” more than 120 Nassar survivors signed a letter urging the MSU board to fire Engler -- a move backed by two board members, Byrum and Mosallam.\n\nOn the heels of that blowup, it was reported that Engler ordered changes to a special edition of the MSU alumni magazine that was initially intended to be dedicated to the Nassar survivors. While the final version still talked about the Nassar scandal, Engler had the focus changed from the impact of the scandal to the changes he had spearheaded.\n\nAs a result of the controversies, the board’s June meeting was packed with people calling for Engler to be fired. Yet the board majority blocked Mosallam’s attempt to put Engler’s firing on the meeting agenda.\n\n“I too was not happy with President Engler’s comments,\" Trustee Mitch Lyons told the audience. “I’ve struggled mightily with what’s the best course.”\n\nBut, Lyons said, he was worried about who would replace Engler. “Nobody in their right mind is walking into this hot mess right now,” he said.\n\nEngler had his supporters on the board. “He has given us outstanding leadership,” Ferguson told a jeering audience at the board meeting. “Let’s not just nitpick or take out things.”\n\nIn the second half of the year, Engler drew criticism again from Nassar survivors and their supporters over his handling of a $10 million “healing fund” established while Simon was still president to help with counseling and other out-of-pocket costs for Nassar victims.\n\nEngler suspended the fund in July, citing suspicions of fraudulent claims. The fund was never re-opened and in December, Engler announced the leftover money -- about $8.7 million -- would be folded into the $500 million settlement.\n\nMcCaul, one of the Nassar survivors, says those moves were a slap in the face to survivors.\n\nWhile Engler said the fund was no longer necessary because of the $500 million settlement, McCaul pointed out that money hasn’t been paid to individual plaintiffs yet, as their payments are still being calculated.\n\n“There have been months since the fund was shut down and this gap where women aren’t getting the resources they need,” McCaul said. “So you’re leaving a group of traumatized women to themselves, and rescinding the resources promised.”\n\nAt their first meeting in 2019, the board ordered MSU administration to develop a plan to re-establish the fund.\n\nEngler and the rest of MSU leadership got another round of bad publicity in late December when MSU was accused of “stonewalling” and “circling the wagons\" by William Forsyth, the special prosecutor heading a state investigation into MSU’s handling of the Nassar situation.\n\n“Any positive momentum that MSU had was hurt by the Forsyth report,” said Keith Hearit, a Western Michigan University administrator and a crisis management expert who has written books on the subject. “When you have a legal expert with subpoena powers saying that nothing has changed, it’s very hard to walk that back.”\n\nThe most recent controversy developed after the Detroit News reported Jan. 11 that Engler told its editorial board that some victims were “enjoying” the spotlight.\n\n“You’ve got people, they are hanging on and this has been … there are a lot of people who are touched by this, survivors who haven’t been in the spotlight,” Engler said. \"In some ways they have been able to deal with this better than the ones who’ve been in the spotlight who are still enjoying that moment at times, you know, the awards and recognition. And it’s ending. It’s almost done.”\n\n‘Mean-spirited’\n\nAsked by MLive last week what he wishes he could re-do over the past year, Engler said, “As governor, I wasn’t subject to FOIA so I’d email less.\"\n\nHe also suggested that part of his struggle over the past year was being in a role where counter-punching critics got him in trouble.\n\n“In the political world, one can always engage in hand-to-hand combat. You give as good as you get,” he said. \"I could at least tell my side of the story.\n\n“In this environment, with student privacy and you’re dealing with a lot of litigation, there are a lot of limits on what I can say,” Engler told MLive. “Here, I think we have a great side of the story to tell, but we often are pretty restrained in what we can say or what we can say back.\n\n“Also the university community is a bit more fragile,” he said. \"It doesn’t like the give and take. It likes when they’re giving, not when they’re getting.”\n\nBut Mosallam, who has characterized Engler’s leadership as a “reign of terror,” sees it a different way. Universities are about respectful discourse, he says, and Engler’s interactions with faculty and students often tended to be condescending and belittling, from Mosallam’s observations.\n\n“He’s mean-spirited,” Mosallam said.\n\nAnd that has been a huge problem at a university trying to create culture change around the values of respect and empathy, Mosallam said.\n\n“That tone of compassion and empathy needs to start at the top, and that’s not happening,” he said.\n\nNatalie Rogers, a MSU student who is communications coordinator for Reclaim MSU, said that changes over the past year at MSU have been offset by the sense that administration is still “antagonistic.”\n\n““There have been policy changes, but it also seems like it’s new faces, same attitude,” she said. “They’re still about keeping power for themselves and keeping everyone else out.”\n\nHearit, the WMU crisis management expert, said he’s been perplexed by some of Engler’s actions.\n\n“I thought it was a good move to bring Engler aboard. He’s not someone who cares about criticism, and it was a good idea to bring in someone with the capacity to make strong decisions,\" Hearit said. “But at times he seems to have been tone deaf.\n\n“I’m of the opinion that Michigan State failed at just about every opportunity to do the right thing,\" Hearit said. \"It’s astounding that they can’t get it right.”\n\nMoving forward\n\nThe perspective of people such as Hearit is especially frustrating for MSU trustees who feel Michigan State has made significant strides over the past 12 months, but that story has been overshadowed by the various controversies.\n\n“Every week, there’s been drama it seems,\" Byrum said. “Some of it is probably self-inflicted. A lot of is probably self-inflicted.”\n\n(Below is a look at Engler’s tenure at MSU. Click the dots for more details)\n\nBut the reality, she said, is that Michigan State is “absolutely” a different place than it was a year ago.\n\n“We have a lot of work to do, but we’re moving the right direction,” she said. “There are so many changes that I can’t even keep up.”\n\nAmong those echoing that sentiment is Amanda Thomashow, one of the more high-profile Nassar survivors. It was Thomashow who filed a 2014 complaint against Nassar, which in the university cleared the doctor and allowed him to practice for another two years.\n\nThomashow is now part of an MSU advisory panel that will oversee a new Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner program offering 24-hour-a-day, first-response medical care to sexual assault survivors on campus.\n\n“I know amazing people at the university and they’re doing amazing things every day, and I wish that got more attention,” Thomashow said. “I think we don’t get to see great things they’re doing because the messaging at the top doesn’t always match.”\n\nThomashow pointed to the Relationship Violence and Sexual Misconduct Expert Advisory Workgroup as a game-changer at MSU. The group -- which is headed by Rebecca Campbell, a MSU psychology professor and includes other MSU experts on various aspects of sex abuse -- has recommended a long list of initiatives that have been implemented by administration.\n\nThose changes include restructuring MSU’s Title IX office, creating a new Outreach, Prevention and Education Office, adding more counselors and prevention staff, overhauling staff trainings and student orientations, and making it easier to for staff to access services.\n\nKelly, the board vice chair, said he’s optimistic about the future.\n\nWhile there have been “missteps,\" he said, “there have been big changes up and down the line. Changes in policies and procedures and the culture.\"\n\nBut, he added, the Nassar controversy isn’t going away anytime soon.\n\n“I don’t think this thing will ever be over,” he said in an interview with MLive on Tuesday. “This is a matter the university needs to deal with and needs to learn from. The adversarial nature of this will be over when the survivors say it’s over, not us. We need to gain back that trust from the survivors.”\n\nByrum also said that MSU has a long road ahead.\n\n“We’re talking about transformational change here,” she said. “It doesn’t happen with one action, in one day, one week. It’s a journey that you constantly have to be aware of, and it takes time. Not something you can tie a bow on and say it’s done. It will never be done.”"
