        "text": "Instead of doing his job and addressing the pandemic that continues to surge to new records each day, Trump is stewing over his election defeat and spreading baseless claims of nonexistent voter fraud. There is nothing Trump can do to change reality: there is no voter fraud, President-elect Biden received 5 million more votes, and counting, and he is on track to secure 306 electoral college votes.\n\nThe coronavirus surged to yet another single-day record high, exceeding 150,000 cases for the first time.\n\nCNN: “The United States reported 153,496 Covid-19 cases on Thursday, according to Johns Hopkins University — the country’s highest daily caseload and the first time the number of coronavirus infections have exceeded 150,000 in a single day. It’s also the tenth consecutive day cases have topped 100,000.”\n\nAmerica’s jobs recovery is slowing down and another 1 million Americans filed new unemployment claims last week.\n\nCNN: “America’s jobs recovery is slowing down. While many have been able to return to work, millions remain unemployed. … Together, first-time claims stood at 1 million last week, not adjusted for seasonal fluctuations.”\n\nTrump is ignoring his job as president and an ongoing global crisis to instead spread lies and stew over his election defeat.\n\nWashington Post: “The contrast between the nation grappling with an ongoing global crisis and a president consumed with his own political problems highlighted a fundamental contradiction at the heart of Trump’s assault on the integrity of the U.S. election system: He is leveraging the power of his office in a long-shot bid to stay in the job while ignoring many of the public duties that come with it.”\n\nDespite Trump’s baseless claims, he has been able to provide no evidence of widespread voter fraud because there was no widespread voter fraud.\n\nNew York Times: “Election Officials Directly Contradict Trump on Voting System Fraud”\n\nCNN: “Fact check: Evidence undermines Trump campaign’s claims of dead people voting in Georgia”\n\nUSA Today Editorial Board: “Sore loser Donald Trump claims he was cheated out of reelection. Where’s the proof?”\n\nNothing Trump can do can change reality and even his good buddy Sheldon Adelson is advising him to admit he lost.\n\nWashington Post: “Sheldon Adelson’s Las Vegas Review-Journal twice endorsed Trump. Now it’s advising him to admit he lost.”\n\nThe post Trump Ignores COVID To Stew Over His Election Defeat appeared first on Democrats.\n\nUnder Chair Tom Perez, Democrats rebuilt the DNC, setting the stage to win back the White House and secure victories at every level of the ballot. Here are some of the programs that contributed to Democrats’ wins over the last four years:\n\nThe Battlegrounds Program: The DNC made early, historic investments to build the on-the-ground infrastructure needed to win key states and help our eventual nominee to grow their general election campaign as quickly as possible.\n\nIn August of 2019 we began funding communications staff to define and localize Trump in key markets, eventually growing the program to 11 states and generating thousands of local clips.\n\nIn September of 2019 we deployed organizers in 8 states.\n\nIn November of 2019 we began funding voter protection staff, a program that would eventually grow to 33 states.\n\nAnd in January of 2020, we launched the Battleground Build-Up 2020, a multi-million dollar program funding hundreds of organizing, operations and data staff that formed the core of the general election coordinated campaign organizing program. The DNC’s unprecedented training program, Organizing Corps 2020, served as the coordinated campaign’s largest single talent pipeline for diverse, local staff.\n\nData, Technology and the Voter File: The DNC completely overhauled the party’s technology and now maintains a state-of-the art, cloud-based data warehouse and national voter file. We made massive investments to improve the quality and quantity of our data so that our view of every possible voter is as accurate as possible, and that data was made available to all democratic campaigns and committees for use.\n\nIn January of 2020 the DNC purchased millions of high quality cell phone numbers, increasing the efficiency of our cell phone outreach by 35 percent, and increasing the number of cell phones on the file by 130 percent compared to 2016.\n\nWe built and integrated a new record linkage algorithm, increasing efficiency by 11 percent.\n\nThe DNC’s IWillVote.com and VoyAVotar.com websites were the main voter turnout tools for the Biden campaign as well as Democrats at every level of the ballot — and were expanded to make it easier to request and return a ballot by mail. Nearly 21 million people visited IWillVote.com in 2020, 507,703 people started their voter registration via IWillVote.com, and 636,358 people requested a vote by mail application or learned more about voting by mail in their state. Over GOTV weekend, more than 2.17 million people looked up their polling location on the site.\n\nDemocrats also reached a historic agreement with state parties to form a new Democratic Data Exchange, which was live in 41 states and worked exactly as expected.\n\nHolding Trump Accountable: The DNC’s rapid response war room began its work before Trump was even inaugurated and its 35-plus communications and research operatives worked with hundreds of media outlets, surrogates, and online influencers to shape the narrative of the Trump presidency using reporter outreach, research, extremely localized content and disruptive online content, along with placing major stories about his record.\n\nThe war room deployed 17 searing ads to define Trump and shape media narratives around key issues and used a variety of tactics — from lite brites to mobile billboards — to generate media coverage about his record.\n\nThe war room’s work was driven by the largest and most experienced research team in Democratic politics, who spent five years building the world’s most comprehensive research file on Donald Trump, including “more than 7,000 lawsuits, volumes of Freedom of Information Act requests and thousands of hours of video footage.”\n\nConstituency Organizing: Democrats deployed organizing staff focused on Latino, African-American, AAPI, Native, rural and youth voters in battleground states across the country.\n\nEarly in Tom Perez’s tenure, we also launched constituency-specific programs like Chop It Up, ¡Mujeres Mobilized! Cafecito Con Politics and Seat at The Table, facilitating cycle-long conversations with key constituencies like African-American men and Latino women.\n\nThe DNC made a six figure investment in minority-owned media, running Latino, African-American and AAPI print and radio advertising campaigns in key battleground states to help turn out voters, as well as targeted advertising in Native outlets.\n\nVoter Protection: Democrats had 33 state voter protection directors on the ground — a much earlier and more comprehensive on-the-ground voting protection infrastructure than in previous cycles, and our national voter assistance hotline served as a primary method to identify and respond to issues of voter suppression.\n\nThe DNC also launched a new voter purge protection tool that allowed voter protection, data and organizing staff to more easily identify and engage with individuals at risk of being purged from the voter rolls and take action.\n\nWhen necessary, we filed litigation to expand and protect access to voting, winning cases that expanded voting by mail, extended the time period when voters could submit their ballot, and increased the number of polling locations, amongst other areas.\n\nCybersecurity & Combating Misinformation Online: The DNC’s first ever Chief Security Officer implemented the highest security standards for all employees, and worked continuously throughout the cycle to identify disinformation, leverage monitoring tools, and implement counter-disinformation best practices in response to attacks. This work has been used to provoke hundreds of account takedowns on platforms controlled by all three major social media companies since the beginning of last year.\n\nFundraising: The DNC has raised more money under Tom Perez’s tenure than any other DNC in history, raising a total of $400 million. It was also the biggest cycle for grassroots fundraising at the DNC since 2004, and the DNC raised $133 million from our grassroots fundraising program, including $22MM from our grassroots fundraising program in September 2020 – the single highest month for grassroots fundraising since 2004. More than 2.2MM people have contributed to the DNC this year – and 30% of them are first time contributors. We also tripled our SMS program, built the biggest email list in DNC history, and set a new all time record for DNC sustaining donations.\n\nIn 2018, the DNC raised $28 million in major donor giving — the best major donor year since President Obama’s first year. 2019 surpassed 2018, and 2020 surpassed 2019. In the first quarter of 2020 the DNC raised $22 million in major donor money.\n\nRunning a fair primary process: From reforms to the nominating process, to a fair debate process and a code of conduct for employees, the DNC administered a primary process that helped unite the party behind Joe Biden. Democrats entered the general election with unprecedented unity and enthusiasm for our eventual nominee, and it showed: The Biden-Harris ticket won more votes than any other ticket in American history.\n\nDemocrats, including the DNC and our sister committees, invested big over four years and the result was wins across the board, including:\n\nFlipped the White House\n\nGained 36 House seats and retook the majority\n\nFlipped 7 Governor seats\n\nGained 6 total Democratic state legislative majorities\n\nBroke 5 Republican supermajorities\n\nGained 7 New Democratic Supermajorities\n\nFlipped 4 Attorney General seats\n\nFlipped 4 Secretary of State seats\n\nFlipped 5 Treasurer seats\n\nFlipped 4 Senate seats\n\nFlipped more than 400 state legislative seats\n\nThe post Democrats Rebuilt the DNC and Won appeared first on Democrats.\n\nIt’s embarrassing and harmful to our democracy to baselessly argue that there was voter fraud without any evidence whatsoever. That might be why major law firms representing Trump’s campaign and its allies in post-election litigation keep abandoning him. Even they know the reality that Trump refuses to accept: President-elect Biden won, and it’s long past time for Trump to concede.\n\nIn a highly unusual move, the law firm leading Trump’s post-election litigation in Pennsylvania abruptly moved to withdraw from a lawsuit.\n\nPolitico: “Another law firm has moved to drop its representation of President Donald Trump’s campaign in its flurry of lawsuits challenging the results of last week’s presidential election. … It is highly unusual for a major law firm to seek to withdraw its representation of a client in litigation so soon after it commenced.”\n\nThe largest law firm representing the Trump campaign or its allies in post-election litigation withdrew from a lawsuit in Arizona.\n\nReuters: “The largest law firm representing the Trump campaign or its allies in post-election litigation challenging votes in key states has withdrawn from an election lawsuit in Maricopa County, Arizona.”\n\nTrump’s go-to law firm is trying to distance itself from Trump’s baseless claims after coming under fire for representing Republicans in a lawsuit over Pennsylvania’s mail ballot deadline.\n\nReuters: “Jones Day, the go-to law firm for U.S. President Donald Trump’s election campaign, is under fire for representing Republicans in a lawsuit over Pennsylvania’s extended deadline to receive mail-in ballots, with law students threatening to boycott the firm and a prominent anti-Trump group targeting it online.”\n\nJones Day Statement: “Jones Day is not representing President Trump, his campaign, or any affiliated party in any litigation alleging voter fraud. Jones Day also is not representing any entity in any litigation challenging or contesting the results of the 2020 general election. Media reports to the contrary are false.”\n\nThe post Law Firms Representing Trump Keep Abandoning Him appeared first on Democrats.\n\nIn response to Trump’s Department of Homeland Security contradicting his false claims and writing that “There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised,” DNC War Room senior spokesperson and advisor Lily Adams released the following statement:\n\n“It has always been clear that this election was free, fair, and secure, and now even Trump’s own Department of Homeland Security has fact checked his lies, calling it the ‘most secure in American history.’ Trump must face reality — President-elect Biden received 5 million more votes than him, is on track to secure 306 electoral college votes, and will be inaugurated in 69 days.”\n\nThe post DNC on DHS Confirming Election Was ‘Most Secure in American History’ appeared first on Democrats.\n\nThere is nothing Trump can do to change the results of the election. Case in point, earlier today, Trump falsely tweeted that if Arizona ran an audit it would show he easily won the election. But Arizona did run audits, found no discrepancies, and Biden is still the president-elect.\n\nEarlier today, Trump said that if he could audit votes in Arizona then he would easily win.\n\nTRUMP: “From 200,000 votes to less than 10,000 votes. If we can audit the total votes cast, we will easily win Arizona also!”\n\nWell, Arizona conducted audits that comprised the majority of votes cast in the state and found no discrepancies that affected the outcome of the election, and Biden is still president-elect.\n\nCNN: “More than half of all counties in Arizona have conducted post-election audits and found either no discrepancies or microscopic issues that don’t affect the outcome, according to reports filed with the secretary of state’s office. Audits in Arizona’s four largest counties, which comprised 86% of all votes for president in the state, turned up no evidence of the systematic voter fraud that President Trump has complained about. There were no irregularities found in Maricopa County, which is home to Phoenix.”\n\nYesterday, Arizona’s Republican attorney general said there was no evidence of voter fraud and that Biden will win the state.\n\nWashington Post: “‘It does appear that Joe Biden will win Arizona,’ state Attorney General Mark Brnovich said in a Wednesday interview with Fox Business host Neil Cavuto.’There is no evidence, there are no facts that would lead anyone to believe that the election results will change.’”\n\nAnd today, a Trump campaign lawyer admitted to an Arizona judge that they knowingly submitted lies and ‘spam’ as evidence of supposed voter fraud.\n\nLaw & Crime: “A Trump campaign attorney conceded in court on Thursday morning that he tried to enter hundreds of dodgy form-filed affidavits into evidence, even though their own investigation found that a subset of the sworn statements that they received were filled with lies and ‘spam.’ ‘This is concerning,’ Judge Daniel Kiley, from Arizona’s Maricopa County, remarked with some understatement.”\n\nThe post Arizona Audits Confirm Biden Is Still President-Elect appeared first on Democrats.\n\nAs Trump continues to promote baseless conspiracy theories about the election and his campaign’s legal “strategy” is dealt blow after blow in the courts, prominent Republican officials are acknowledging his defeat and that Joe Biden will become president on January 20th.\n\nRepublican elected officials from across the country have accepted reality and congratulated President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris for their victory.\n\nOhio Governor Mike DeWine: “Look, I think that we need to consider the former vice president as the President-elect. Joe Biden is the President-elect.”\n\nMassachusetts Governor Charlie Baker: “I congratulate President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris on their victory. This has been a long and divisive campaign, but now it is critical for us all to focus on the very real and immediate challenges facing this nation.”\n\nUtah Governor-elect Spencer Cox: “Abby and I wish a heart-felt congratulations to @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris on the election call today. Thank you for your commitment to unite us all. We pray for you and promise to work with you to benefit the people of Utah.”\n\nMaryland Governor Larry Hogan: “Congratulations to President-elect Biden. Everyone should want our president to succeed because we need our country to succeed. We have great challenges ahead of us as a country. Now more than ever, we need to come together as Americans.”\n\nVermont Governor Phil Scott: “I want to congratulate President-elect Biden and Vice President-Elect Harris. I also want to recognize this historic moment as we see the first ever woman, and the first ever person of color, reach the U.S. vice presidency. It is my greatest hope they will be successful in uniting our country and leading us forward through these difficult times.”\n\nGovernor Chris Sununu: “Joe Biden is the President-Elect”\n\nSenator Mitt Romney: “Ann and I extend our congratulations to President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. We know both of them as people of good will and admirable character. We pray that God may bless them in the days and years ahead.”\n\nSenator Ben Sasse: “Melissa and I congratulate the next president, Joe Biden, and the next vice president, Kamala Harris.”\n\nSenator Pat Toomey: “We’re on a path it looks likely that Joe Biden is going to be the next president of the United States. It’s not a hundred percent certain but it is quite likely and so I think a transition process ought to begin.”\n\nSenator Susan Collins: “First, I would offer my congratulations to President-elect Biden on his apparent victory – he loves this country, and I wish him every success. Presidential transitions are important, and the President-elect and the Vice-President-elect should be given every opportunity to ensure that they are ready to govern on January 20th.”\n\nSenator Lisa Murkowski: “I congratulate President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris and will be ready to work with their administration when it takes office. While we will not always agree, I will partner with them, when possible, to do what is right for Alaska—just as I will continue to emphasize collaboration and bipartisanship with my colleagues in a narrowly divided Senate.”\n\nRepresentative Adam Kinzinger: “Sofia and I extend our Congratulations to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Our nation deserves two competing parties who can work together when possible, and compete honorably when not.”\n\nRepresentative Paul Mitchell: “Congratulations to President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris. This election was hard-fought by both candidates and ultimately the voters chose them for the job. America now looks to you to lead our country and unite us for the common good.”\n\nFormer Republican officials have also spoken out and accepted the outcome of the election.\n\nFormer President George W. Bush: “I just talked to the President-elect of the United States, Joe Biden. I extended my warm congratulations and thanked him for the patriotic message he delivered last night. I also called Kamala Harris to congratulate her on her historic election to the vice presidency. Though we have political differences, I know Joe Biden to be a good man, who has won his opportunity to lead and unify our country.”\n\nFormer Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice: “Congratulations President-elect @JoeBiden and Vice President-elect @KamalaHarris, and to the American people who voted in record numbers showing the strength and vibrancy of our democracy.”\n\nFormer Senator Jeff Flake: “Congratulations, President-Elect Biden for a hard won victory. Arizona has chosen well.”\n\nA growing number of Republicans have publicly urged the Trump administration to formally begin the transition process and allow President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris to access classified briefings.\n\nBloomberg: “Republican Senators Marco Rubio and Mitt Romney joined mounting calls for the GSA to ascertain Biden as the president-elect, warning that extended delays in the formal transition of power put the nation’s security at risk. ‘There’s a very likely prospect that there will be a change in administration,’ Romney, a senator from Utah, told reporters Monday. ‘For the purposes of smooth transition and national security, we have a national interest in the transition proceeding as rapidly as can be done.’”\n\nCNN: “Two top GOP senators told CNN on Thursday that Joe Biden should have access to classified briefings, the latest indication that Republicans acknowledge the President-elect is likely on his way to the White House despite President Donald Trump’s refusal to accept the results. ‘I would think — especially on classified briefings — answer is yes,’ said Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who as president pro tempore is the most senior Republican in the chamber. Senate Majority Whip John Thune of South Dakota also told CNN that Biden should have access to classified briefings.”\n\nCNN: Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Lankford said Wednesday that he will intervene if the Trump administration has not allowed President-elect Joe Biden access to presidential daily intelligence briefings by the end of the week, one of the first rights of a presidential candidate after winning the election. ‘There is no loss from him getting the briefings and to be able to do that,’ Lankford told radio station KRMG, noting that he sits on the Senate Oversight Committee and that he’s already started engaging on this issue.”\n\nSenator Susan Collins: “President-elect Biden should be receiving intelligence briefings right now”\n\nKansas City Star’s Bryan Lowry: “.@RoyBlunt to reporters on Capitol Hill on whether Biden should be receiving intelligence briefings: ‘Yes.’”\n\nThe post Prominent Republicans Agree: Joe Biden Won the Election and Will Become President appeared first on Democrats.\n\nTrump’s failed coronavirus response is leading to record highs for coronavirus infections and hospitalizations, and his refusal to concede to President-elect Biden could make the crisis even worse. We now have confirmation from inside Trump’s administration that Trump is undermining vaccine distribution and putting American lives at risk because of his inability to cope with his overwhelming loss.\n\nThe coronavirus is surging uncontrolled across the country, with new cases and hospitalizations hitting all-time highs yesterday.\n\nWashington Post: “Just one week after the United States reported more than 100,000 coronavirus infections in a single day for the first time, that milestone is already starting to feel quaint. Wednesday’s jaw-dropping tally of 145,835 new cases set yet another record — the sixth in just eight days — as the number of people hospitalized nationwide topped 65,000 for the first time since the pandemic began.”\n\nCNN: “That’s as the White House Task Force this week again alerted states of ‘accelerating’ coronavirus spread and recommended increased testing in its weekly report to states.”\n\nTrump’s “stunning abdication of leadership” is making the pandemic worse and is a failure even by his own low standards.\n\nCNN: “Trump’s stunning abdication of leadership comes as pandemic worsens”\n\nNew York Times: “The Surging Coronavirus Finds a Federal Leadership Vacuum”\n\nWashington Post: “When the White House first decided to forcefully address the pandemic, it set expectations that the death toll wouldn’t pass 240,000. Perhaps it wouldn’t have if the administration had continued to decide to try to limit the virus’s spread. But the White House, and Trump in particular, largely gave up on that fight. The result is that, by its own standard, its efforts have failed.”\n\nTrump is putting lives at risk by refusing to concede and blocking his administration from working with President-elect Biden’s transition—which could delay vaccine distribution.\n\nPolitico: “The Trump administration’s refusal to authorize a presidential transition is interfering with President-elect Joe Biden’s plans for a rapid scale-up of the federal coronavirus response, leaving the incoming administration locked out of key health agencies amid the spiraling pandemic.”\n\nDaily Beast: “President Donald Trump’s refusal to give in to the fact that Joe Biden has won the election is likely to prolong the pandemic and put American lives at risk, multiple current senior officials working on the federal government’s coronavirus response told The Daily Beast.”\n\nDaily Beast: “Officials in the Trump administration working the COVID vaccine process, particularly those working on Operation Warp Speed, have been unable to communicate with Biden’s new COVID-19 task force about what plans they already have in place for distribution. Without close coordination on those topics, current officials say, Biden’s team could face significant delays in getting the vaccine out to the American people.”\n\nThe post As COVID-19 Surges Across the Country, Trump Puts Lives at Risk by Refusing To Concede appeared first on Democrats.\n\nIn state after state, the Trump campaign’s legal “strategy” continues to fall flat and is suffering embarrassing rebukes in court because of one simple reality: they have no case, no evidence and no rationale to try to overturn the will of 77 million voters and counting. That hasn’t stopped them from continuing to lodge ridiculous claims, but nothing they do will change the outcome of the election.\n\nThe Trump campaign continues to suffer embarrassing rebukes from judges over its baseless claims of voter fraud because it has no evidence.\n\nWashington Post: “Trump lawyers suffer embarrassing rebukes from judges over voter fraud claims”\n\nWashington Post: “The common thread running through all of these is that Trump’s lawyers are regularly offering a significantly more watered-down version of Trump’s claims about rampant voter fraud — because they, unlike Trump, have to substantiate their claims.”\n\nThe Trump campaign apparatus hasn’t stopped its baseless claims and has now outrageously tried to argue increases in turnout in areas with many Black voters are a sign of fraud.\n\nCNN: “It has also joined Trump in using laughably weak supposed evidence to make the case. Specifically, it is baselessly arguing that increases in voter turnout are a sign that something nefarious happened. … This is, frankly, ridiculous. There is no evidence of widespread fraud anywhere in the country, including in the counties Harrington highlighted.”\n\nIn Michigan, affidavits from poll watchers the Trump campaign used to allege election misconduct showed no evidence of voter fraud.\n\nDetroit Free Press: “Trump lawsuit affidavits allege Michigan election misconduct, don’t show widespread fraud”\n\nWashington Post: “In poll watcher affidavits, Trump campaign offers no evidence of fraud in Detroit ballot-counting”\n\nIn Wisconsin, Republicans have still not been able to provide any evidence of voter fraud to support their baseless claims.\n\nWisconsin Journal Sentinel: “As in other states, Wisconsin Republicans are alleging voter fraud but so far are not providing evidence of widespread problems that would take away President-elect Joe Biden’s victory.”\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the Republican Philadelphia City Commissioner, whose office runs the vote count, confirmed that not a single dead person voted, contrary to misinformation spreading online.\n\nCNN’s Kaitlan Collins: “Republican Philadelphia City Commissioner says they looked into a list claiming dead people voted. ‘Between everything else that we’re doing, we looked it up — each one of them to see what their vote history was. Not a single one voted in Philadelphia after they died.’”\n\nIn Georgia, Republicans, including the Secretary of State, said that the statewide recount will confirm that Biden is the President-elect.\n\nCNN’s Manu Raju: “Brad Raffensperger, GOP Secretary of State, says on CNN he expects hand recount will confirm GA count that now has Biden ahead by more than 14K. ‘We believe the statewide recount will confirm that.’ He adds there hasn’t been widespread fraud – ‘nothing in the nature of 10,000’”\n\nNew Yorker’s Charles Bethea: “NEW: Georgia State Senator Chuck Hufstetler becomes first Republican in GA legislature to publicly acknowledge President Elect Biden. ‘It’s my opinion that Joe Biden has won the election and will be declared the winner,’ he tells me. ‘I don’t see anything that will change that.’”\n\nIn Nevada, a court dismissed another legal fight and Trump attempted to disenfranchise military service members with baseless claims of voter fraud.\n\nMilitary.com: “GOP List of Alleged Voter Fraud in Nevada Contains Hundreds of Military Addresses”\n\nIn Arizona, the largest law firm representing the Trump campaign in post-election litigation abandoned them and withdrew from a lawsuit.\n\nReuters: “The largest law firm representing the Trump campaign or its allies in post-election litigation challenging votes in key states has withdrawn from an election lawsuit in Maricopa County, Arizona.”\n\nThe post Trump Campaign Legal ‘Strategy’ Suffers Embarrassing Rebukes appeared first on Democrats.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden is on track to win states that total more than 300 electoral votes, already has a popular vote margin of more than five million and counting, and has leads of more than 10,000 votes in Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. With a legal “strategy” that’s falling flat, the Trump campaign now claims that recounts will change the outcome of this election. Like most of their post-election claims, this is completely without merit. The truth is that recounts almost never actually change the results of an election — especially when candidates have leads as big as President-elect Biden’s — and they barely even change the margins. The Trump campaign is only prolonging the inevitable. President-elect Biden received the most votes and won this election.\n\nIt is “exceedingly rare” for recounts to change the outcome of elections and it requires “very narrow margins of victory.”\n\nFairVote Report: “Recounts which change the outcome of an election are exceedingly rare and require very narrow margins of victory.”\n\nElection Law Professor: “History shows that it’s very, very hard to overturn a statewide result that’s above a thousand votes in a recount scenario.”\n\nNo statewide recount had changed the results of any election in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, or Arizona for at least two decades.\n\nStatewide recounts over the past 20 years typically changed the end margins of elections by at most several hundred votes — far lower than the 10,000+ vote lead Biden has right now in critical states.\n\nOn average, statewide recounts have shifted the winning margin by about 430 votes.\n\nA 2004 Georgia judicial recount changed the end margin by only 15 votes.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, a 2009 judicial recount changed the end margin by only 281 votes.\n\nA 2010 Arizona ballot initiative recount changed the end margin by only 66 votes.\n\nIn Wisconsin, a Supreme Court election recount changed the final margin by only 312 votes.\n\nIn recent recounts that changed the outcome, the shift in vote margin was fewer than 1,000 votes.\n\nIn a 2004 Washington gubernatorial race, the two candidates were separated by less than 300 votes, with the recount changing the end margin by about 400 votes.\n\nIn a 2008 Minnesota Senate race, the two candidates were separated by less than 300 votes, with the recount changing the end margin by around 500 votes.\n\nThe only two presidential recounts in the 21st century barely budged the margins, and neither changed the ultimate result.\n\nFlorida’s infamous 2000 recount only moved the margin by about 1,247 votes, which is 1/10 as large as the smallest Biden battleground state margin.\n\nFormer Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker: “After recount in 2011 race for WI Supreme Court, there was a swing of 300 votes. After recount in 2016 Presidential race in WI, @realDonaldTrump numbers went up by 131. As I said, 20,000 is a high hurdle.”\n\nThe post Recount Reality Check: Biden’s Margins in Decisive States Far Exceed Recount Changes appeared first on Democrats."
