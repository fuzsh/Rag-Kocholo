        "text": "EAST LANSING — Michigan State University Trustee Dianne Byrum confirmed Friday that she will not seek reelection in November to her position.\n\nByrum, 69, a Democrat, was elected to the Board of Trustees in 2008, and reelected in 2016. She was elected chairperson in 2019 and 2021. Byrum's term on the board will end Jan. 1, 2025.\n\n\"I ran for the Michigan State University Board of Trustees to give back to my alma mater for all the opportunities my college degree provided me during the course of my career, but it is time to step aside for a new generation of leaders, and I will not be seeking a third term. I love MSU and I am a Spartan for life — Go Green!\" Byrum said via text.\n\nHer seat will be up for election in November. Rebecca Bahar-Cook, CEO of Capital Fundraising Associates in Lansing, confirmed to the State Journal that she was seeking the Democratic nominee for the position.\n\n\"As a Michigan State University alum, as a parent of two children who went to MSU, our family has been positively impacted by the university,\" Bahar-Cook said via text. \"I am a proven consensus builder and my immediate focus as a trustee will be to help make MSU the best it can be for students, faculty, staff, alums, and the entire state of Michigan.\"\n\nBahar-Cook has previously served as a member of the Ingham County Board of Commissioners.\n\nMichael Balow, who previously sought the Republican nomination for the board of trustees, told the State Journal Friday he will run again. His daughter is a recent MSU grad.\n\n\"I have a vision of a more open MSU board, collaboration across all segments of MSU, and listening to the constituents of our state,\" Balow said via email. \"I really appreciate the great things the university has to offer, but also see very clearly the opportunities to improve it.\"\n\nIt's unclear whether any other candidates have announced plans to seek the seat. Michigan State University board candidates are nominated by their respective political parties for the general statewide election in November. Each party can nominate two candidates per election.\n\nByrum served on the Ingham County Board of Commissioners from 1983 to 1990, then was elected to the Michigan House in 1991 and to the state Senate in 1995. In 2002, she returned to the House for two terms. She served as Michigan House Democratic Leader, the first woman to lead a caucus in the state.\n\nByrum, who graduated from Michigan State's College of Agriculture and Natural Resources with a degree in agricultural economics, was a founding partner in 2006, at Byrum & Fisk Advocacy Communications, a public relations firm in East Lansing.\n\nByrum served as co-director of the Michigan Political Leadership Program, an MSU program that trains future public policy leaders. Her long career in politics earned her the title of \"top 100 most influential women\" in Michigan by Crain's Detroit Business in 2021.\n\nByrum served on the MSU board during some of the most controversial events in the school's recent history, including the Larry Nassar sexual abuse investigation. Survivors of his abuse have said the board failed them for refusing to release documents related to the investigation. On Dec. 15, the trustees agreed to release the remaining documents to Attorney General Dana Nessel's office, once the documents have been reviewed by the university's general counsel.\n\nIn June, former trustees Brian Mosallam and Pat O'Keefe called on her to resign to due to a Detroit News report on her \"failure to pay her local school millage tax, claiming homestead exemptions on two houses since 2017, shows she is unfit to govern any education institution,\" they wrote in a letter.\n\nByrum denied any wrongdoing on her part, and said it was an error on the part of local officials.\n\n\"As an elected leader and businesswoman for decades, paying taxes on time and in full has been part of my core values,\" she said in a statement to the State Journal in June. \"Recently, I was made aware of an error regarding the way our property taxes had been calculated. Upon learning of this error, I immediately notified the local assessor and re-submitted all necessary forms to ensure the calculation was accurate and all paperwork was up to date. I have also paid all property taxes owed in full.\"\n\nMSU Board Chairperson Rema Vassar declined to comment on Byrum's decision. Mark Bullion, a spokesperson for the university, said the university would not comment.\n\nContact Sarah Atwood at satwood@lsj.com. Follow her on X, formerly known as Twitter, @sarahmatwood."
