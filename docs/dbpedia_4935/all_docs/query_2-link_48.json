        "text": "Legislators Cross Aisle to Decry Gerrymandering’s ‘Weaponization of Demography’\n\nNew York—In a brief written by litigation boutique Holwell Shuster & Goldberg LLP and filed yesterday with the U.S. Supreme Court, a group of 65 current and former state legislators from both major political parties urged the Court to invalidate the practice of political gerrymandering. The bipartisan group made its argument as amici in Gill v. Whitford, a redistricting case that challenges the legitimacy of political gerrymandering, and could have a profound effect on the nation’s electoral and political future. It will be argued at the Supreme Court on October 3, 2017.\n\nA complete copy of the brief can be found here.\n\n“We are honored to represent this large group of Democratic and Republican legislators who have united to oppose a grave threat to our democratic system of governance, the destructive effects of which they have experienced firsthand,” said Vincent Levy, a Holwell Shuster & Goldberg partner and counsel of record to the legislators at the Supreme Court. “As our brief notes, political gerrymandering has ‘sounded the death knell of bipartisanship.’ In joining together, these current and former lawmakers have taken a brave stand to urge the Court to protect American democracy from erosion by unchecked partisanship and tribalism.”\n\nIn Gill v. Whitford, Wisconsin state officials are appealing a lower-court ruling that the state’s redistricting plan went to such extremes in its political gerrymandering that it violated protections given to voters by the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. Holwell Shuster & Goldberg’s brief speaks for legislators across eight states, which, like all states, will undergo redistricting following the 2020 census.\n\nDrawing on the extensive legislative and political experience of the bipartisan group, the brief paints an evocative portrait of the harms caused by political gerrymandering. Noting that “few tools for political entrenchment have corrupted our democracy more than modern-day gerrymandering,” it describes the polarization, dysfunction, and secretive legislative practices that result from political gerrymandering. It also describes how modern data analysis has made political gerrymandering terrifyingly potent. For example, the brief notes how one former Michigan House member was excised from her district with such precision that, after redistricting, she could still see her old district from her front door.\n\nUltimately, the brief asks the Court to “take this opportunity to effectuate the core principle of republican government, namely, that the voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around.” The brief speaks powerfully to other subjects, including the following:\n\nThe Power of Gerrymandering in a Data-Driven World:\n\n“The information age has supercharged partisan gerrymandering. For a long time, the practice was ad hoc and largely ineffective, generating minor effects that were unlikely to persist across election cycles. Today, powerful software and detailed, block-by-block voter data enable redistricting plans that give one party huge partisan advantages that survive shifts in voter preferences and demographics.” (p. 8–9)\n\nThe Negative Effects of Gerrymandering on Representational Government:\n\n“[M]odern-day partisan gerrymanders intend to and do subvert the ideal of fair representation. In Amici’s States, recent years have shown that partisan gerrymandering has contributed to a significant breakdown in democratic norms and governance. Legislatures have become ideologically polarized, beset by interpersonal rancor, and responsive only to a fraction of the electorate.” (p. 15)\n\nHow Gerrymandering Silences Minority Parties and their Voters:\n\n“In many States, the decline of bipartisanship means that representatives from the minority party—and, therefore, their constituents—are shut out of the legislative process. Following the redistricting in Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers enacted new rules that limit Democrats’ ability to speak on legislation and refused to consider Democrat-sponsored amendments. As Rep. Pasch puts it, ‘Not only could [Democrats] not legislate, now we could not speak.’ Similarly, Rep. Clyde reports that Democrats in Ohio are not allowed to send newsletters to their constituents until Republican leaders review them, and sometimes require the removal or content critical of Republican legislators or policies.” (p. 17)\n\nHow Gerrymandering Incentivizes Legislators to Ignore General-Election Voters:\n\n“Wisconsin legislators in safe seats entirely ignore communications from voters of the opposite party: Phone calls are disregarded, letters thrown away, emails deleted. They refuse to hold hearings where voters might challenge them, and they skip community events. Assembly leaders have gone so far as to bar citizens from bringing writing materials to the Assembly—not even ‘paper for their kids to doodle on’ . . . .” (p. 20)\n\nThe Need for Judicial Intervention to End Gerrymandering:\n\n“The nature of partisan gerrymandering indeed ensures that it cannot be undone through ordinary politics. Legislators who benefit from the practice have no incentive to halt it, despite ‘the almost universal absence of those who will defend its negative effect on our democracy.’ . . . This state of affairs is self-perpetuating: Whichever political party controls redistricting can draw maps that guarantee it retains power until the next redistricting, at which point it can again draw maps that guarantee it retains power until the next redistricting, and on and on.” (p. 28–29)\n\nThe brief was authored by HSG attorneys Vincent Levy, Gregory Dubinsky, Matthew V.H. Noller, Kevin D. Benish, and Timothy W. Grinsell.\n\nCURRENT AND FORMER STATE LEGISLATORS JOINING THE AMICUS BRIEF\n\n26 Republicans, 39 Democrats"
