The US Taxpayers Party of Michigan and the Green Party of Michigan qualified by petitioning, submitting the required 30,272 valid signatures (1 percent of the total vote cast for governor in 1998) by July 20, 2000. No Reform Party nominee appeared on the ballot because competing factions submitted two sets of papers, one for Buchanan and one for Hagelin.\n\nOverview\n\nThe battleground state of Michigan went to Gore by a plurality of 217,279 votes (5.13 percentage points). Bush carried 58 counties to 25 for Gore. Almost 40% of the total vote (39.8%) comes from the Detroit area (Wayne, Oakland and Macomb counties). Gore piled up a plurality of 307,393 votes in Wayne county and narrowly won in Oakland and Macomb. As expected, Bush did well in Western Michigan (Kent County/Grand Rapids and the surrounding counties). He underperformed in the city of Detroit, and would have had to have done better in Western Wayne county as well as in Oakland and Macomb to carry the state.\n\nA statewide school vouchers initiative, Proposal 1, was overwhelmingly defeated, 69.1% to 30.9%.\n\nGeneral Election Activity\n\n. Open primary--ballot featured three party sections: Republican, Democratic and Reform. However, Gore and Bradley did not participate in the Democratic primary leaving a choice between Lyndon LaRouche and Uncommitted. The only Reform Party choices were Donald Trump and Uncommitted.\n\n. According to news accounts, independents and Democrats accounted for more than half of those voting in the Feb. 22 primary.\n\nAll counties reporting.\n\nTotal Vote\n\nPercent\n\nGary Bauer1\n\n2,733\n\n0.21%\n\nGeorge W.
