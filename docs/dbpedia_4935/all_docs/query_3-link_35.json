        "text": "The House candidates in Michigan's Eighth Congressional District seem so committed to being nice that they have trouble explaining why people should vote for them and not the opposition.\n\nThe two state senators running for an open seat debated here on Wednesday, and while they talked a lot about their own views in general terms, they hardly ever criticized each other. Diane Byrum, the Democrat, said that ''personal negative attacks have no place in this campaign.'' Mike Rogers, the Republican, said, ''If you look at the ads I have run, there is not a negative ad there, and there won't be.''\n\nThis tossup contest, for a seat being vacated by Representative Debbie Stabenow, who is running for United States Senate, is crucial as Democrats seek the seven-seat gain that would give them a House majority. And it is no tea party, with the candidates' supporters happy to fill the void in negativity.\n\nThe Michigan Republican Party, for example, is running an all-out attack advertisement, blaming Ms. Byrum for missing a vote on education ''while she counted her campaign cash'' at a fund-raising reception. ''Byrum has taken money from casino interests,'' it says, and urges viewers: ''Call Diane Byrum. Ask why she put herself before Michigan school kids.''\n\nMs. Byrum acknowledged missing the one vote, but said she voted for the bill on several other occasions.\n\nOn the other side is Emily's List, a group that raises money for Democratic women, like Ms. Byrum, who favor abortion rights. It put out a flier here showing an old woman and asking, ''Who would take away her guaranteed future protection?'' It asked readers to tell Mr. Rogers ''not to sacrifice your Social Security to pay back his wealthy friends.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
