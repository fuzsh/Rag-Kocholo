        "text": "MESSAGE FROM THE DEAN\n\nThere are 8 billion people in the world. You are one of them. Just one. How can you possibly make sense of that many people; that many cultures; that many philosophies and theories; that much history; that much science and knowledge?\n\nYet the Lord told Jeremiah: “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.” And: “I know the plans I have for you,” declares the LORD, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.\n\nRegent University’s College of Arts & Sciences will help you discover God’s plans for your life. Whether in preparation for one of Regent’s many graduate programs, or service to Kingdom and culture around the world, we lay the foundation — to think, to write, to speak, to integrate, to understand.\n\nIn the book The Abolition of Man, C. S. Lewis contends that the meaning of life begins with one fundamental assumption — the doctrine of objective value.\n\nSome things really are true; some things really are noble; some things really are right, pure, lovely and admirable.\n\nIt is those things, says the Apostle Paul, not the countless theories and philosophies and opinions of man, that are the sure foundation.\n\nThere may be 8 billion people in the world, but you were formed. You are set apart. You have been appointed. You have plans! You have a hope and a future.\n\nRegent’s mission is: Christian Leadership to Change the World. You may be just one person, but you are destined to touch those 8 billion people.\n\nCome, let us help you discover yourself in Him at Regent’s College of Arts & Sciences."
