        "text": "Michigan and the rest of the nation are about to get a detailed, fact-based look into the role former President Trump, several members of Congress, state politicians and others played in ongoing attacks on our elections. Starting on June 9 in prime time, the bipartisan congressional committee charged with investigating the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, will […]\n\nRead more ›\n\nAs you may already know, I have a lot of fun on Twitter and in these posts bringing forth the shenanigans of Republican candidates while also educating Michigan’s voters. I know that sometimes it may come off as silly or unserious. But today, I must be serious about what is happening regarding Roe v Wade. But this is not the […]\n\nRead more ›\n\nGathering petition signatures is an act as old as democracy itself. It is direct and easy to understand: Sign the petition to show your support. Sign the petition and the person or issue will be placed on the ballot for everyone to decide on. Many of us have signed or circulated petitions for issues or candidates that we believe in. […]\n\nRead more ›\n\nJust over 13 months ago, the attempted overthrow of the democratic election of 2020 began. For those doing math in their heads right now, I am not talking about the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol Building. I am also not talking about the statements by the former President on Election Night that we should stop counting the ballots because he […]\n\nRead more ›\n\nWith Halloween right around the corner, people across the state are hunkering down with their pumpkin-spice beverages and their Halloween candy to enjoy their favorite scary movies. This is exactly the kind of escapism we need right now. But just like any good horror movie, there’s a twist: The really spooky activities are happening at Clerk’s offices in our local […]\n\nRead more ›\n\nThere are just over two months until the next election date in Michigan. The last election for some communities was a month ago. Did you vote? Do you know who the candidates were? There was also an election in May for some communities. Many people had no idea. Voter turnout in presidential years is often relatively high (in the November […]\n\nRead more ›\n\nTwo weeks ago, I attended DEFCON for the third time. DEFCON is a conference where a group of mostly white-hat hackers and experts in various fields come together to determine best practice recommendations for shoring up vulnerabilities with web security and safeguards against malicious hackers. This year, I was given the opportunity to speak at the convention in the elections […]\n\nRead more ›\n\nThe headline in the Detroit News on July 15th read “Michigan election critic says he’s running for attorney general.” Matthew DePerno is no mere election critic. He is one of the lawyers responsible for propagating the Big Lie and is suing Antrim County in an effort to overturn the election results in Michigan. Two weeks ago, the Republican-led Michigan Senate […]\n\nRead more ›\n\nUpon leaving the Constitutional Convention, Ben Franklin is quoted as saying that the constitutional delegates had chosen for America “a Republic, if you can keep it.” This came years after the founding fathers sat down and declared their independence from the British monarchy. Our democratic republic was an experiment, which had never been tried before as a form of government.

It was being held by the Islam’s Secret Agents. The is the sort of intemperate rhetoric that serves no purpose but to mislead and rile a certain group of people. For those who may […]\n\nRead more ›\n\nWith outsiders trying to politicize election administration in the United States, it is time to enshrine voter protections and access to the ballot box nationwide. The constant drumbeat of election conspiracies, prompted by the former President and perpetuated by radical Republicans has resulted in suppressive legislation being introduced in 47 states across the country. Some of these laws have even […]\n\nRead more ›"
