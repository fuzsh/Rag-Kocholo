        "text": "Who's backing the Bay Health Plan tax proposal on Nov. 4?\n\nIts supporters include a long list of Democrats and others who say they're passionate about health care, and its detractors include the Republican Party and others who say they oppose new taxes, but the plan's leaders say their only allegiance is to low-income uninsured residents.\n\n\"This is an issue that affects everyone and we certainly don't see it as a partisan issue,\" said Linda Hamacher, executive director of the Bay Health Plan, which has operated in Bay County for the last eight years.\n\nHamacher, a senior consultant with Health Management Associates Inc. of Lansing, is provided to oversee the plan through a contract between the plan and her firm.\n\nBay County voters on Nov. 4 will be asked to approve an eight-year, 0.67-mill tax that will raise $2 million a year to provide basic affordable health care programs for low-income, uninsured county residents.\n\nAug. 14, 2001: The Bay County Health Department receives a $25,000 state grant to study the feasibility of developing a county-based health care program for low-income uninsured residents. The County Board votes to contract with Health Management Associates, a Lansing-based health care consultant, to implement the program.\n\nSept. 6, 2001: Bay Health Plan, a nonprofit corporation, is started in partnership with Bay County and HMA. The plan uses existing budgeted county dollars through the Health Department to leverage additional federal funding. Linda Hamacher, a senior consultant from HMA, becomes executive director of Bay Health Plan, as well as director of health plans in Saginaw and Genesee counties that start up the same year.\n\nMay 13, 2008: Hamacher approaches Bay County commissioners seeking approval to place an eight-year, 0.67-mill tax proposal on the Nov. 4 ballot. Hamacher says federal funds are drying up and a local millage would raise $2 million a year. County Board Chairman Patrick H. Beson, D-2nd District, and Commissioner Brian K. Elder, D-7th District, have been in close talks with Hamacher and commit to supporting the plan.\n\nJune 3: The County Board votes 6-3 against placing the millage on the Nov. 4 ballot, citing a preference for a federal solution to the nation's health care problems.\n\nJune 6: Elder accuses other commissioners of opposing the plan because of election-year politics. He and Beson, along with Bob Redmond, the County Board's financial analyst, soon join Hamacher to launch a petition drive to put the issue on the ballot.\n\nJuly 18: Elder announces that East Lansing-based consultant Byrum & Fisk Advocacy Communications is going to help Friends of Bay Health Plan collect petition signatures and run a public relations campaign. Byrum & Fisk is owned by Dianne Byrum, a Democratic politician from Ingham County.\n\nAug. 7: Elder and Redmond join Friends of Bay Health Plan to turn in 6,117 voter signatures, putting the health care proposal onto the Nov. 4 ballot.\n\nOct. 24: Campaign finance reports are filed showing the Bay Health Plan millage campaign has raised about $192,000 and spent about $15,000.\n\nIn recent weeks, Bay County residents have received a series of glossy fliers in the mail promoting the message \"Yes! to Health.\" The ads are coming out of the Byrum & Fisk Advocacy Communications public relations firm of East Lansing, and they state that they're paid for by the Michigan Democratic State Central Committee in Lansing.\n\nNone of the seven ads have mentioned the words \"tax\" or \"millage\" and only one has spelled out that saying \"Yes! to Health\" would cost $33.50 per year for the owner of a $100,000 home.\n\nHamacher said it wasn't intentional to leave out information.\n\n\"I didn't even notice that, to tell you the truth,\" she said.\n\nThe professional nature of the campaign - which includes radio and TV ads, robo-calls, and ties to big-name Democrats in Lansing - has some residents wondering why it appears politics have entered the picture.\n\n\"This is Bay County, not Lansing,\" said Jerry Krause, a retired Bay City resident. \"I thought it was supposed to be a nonpartisan issue.\"\n\nBay Health Plan leaders say state Democrats aren't funding the campaign, despite what the ads have stated. According to Frederick L. Dryzga, president of the Bay Health Plan Board of Directors, the campaign committee didn't get its bulk mailing permit on time, so it asked the Democratic Party for a favor.\n\n\"They are not giving any direct dollars to this health plan,\" he said. \"They were just gracious enough to let us use their bulk mailing permit. We would have loved to use the Republican Party's mailing permit, but they've come out against the millage.\"\n\nThe GOP's stance\n\nThe Bay County Republican Party has opposed the millage, saying Bay County families are struggling and it's time to reduce taxes, not increase them.\n\n\"This millage proposal is yet another burden on the already overtaxed and hardworking families of Bay County,\" reads a resolution from the party, claiming the County Board \"has failed to budget for the costs of the proposed health care services without raising taxes - while members of the commission enjoy excessive benefits.\"\n\nThe GOP says the County Board, led by Democrats, has refused to end its own perks to at least offset some of the costs of the millage.\n\n\"Those commissioners have shown us no effort or willingness to bear some of the burden,\" said Matthew Lance, Bay County Republican Party chairman, noting that his party is not opposed to the Bay Health Plan itself. \"The health plan may be an appropriate and needed plan, but what we're opposed to is having a millage to raise additional taxes for that plan.\"\n\nLance said he thinks those who proposed the millage did so in good faith, but it appears it has turned into a political football.\n\n\"Do I think the Bay County Democratic Party has latched onto this as an issue they can use to boost their turnout on Nov. 4?\" Lance asked himself. \"Certainly.\"\n\nTony Pawelski, chairman of the Bay County Democratic Party, said his group hasn't donated money to the millage campaign, but the party has endorsed the cause.\n\n\"We're all for it,\" he said. \"There's a lot of people out there with no insurance.\"\n\nPawelski said he wasn't sure how the Democratic Party out of Lansing got involved in the campaign mailings, \"but I know Dianne Byrum spearheaded it.\"\n\nBig-name Democrats\n\nByrum & Fisk, the firm hired by Friends of Bay Health Plan to run the campaign, is owned by Dianne Byrum, a Democratic politician from the Lansing area.\n\nByrum founded the firm with Mark Fisk, the former communications director for the state House Democratic Caucus. Byrum, a former Ingham County commissioner, was a state representative until 2006, when she was term-limited and replaced by her daughter, Barb Byrum.\n\nDianne Byrum most recently was behind a Democratic Party drive called Reform Michigan Government Now, an effort to redesign the state's Constitution. A three-judge panel ordered officials to keep the \"overarching\" proposal off the Nov. 4 ballot.\n\nBay County Commissioner Brian K. Elder, D-7th District, a major supporter of the Bay Health Plan campaign, acknowledges a close relationship with the Byrums.\n\n\"They're friends of mine,\" he said. Elder and Hamacher said Friends of Bay Health Plan turned to Byrum & Fisk because of its experience, not its Democratic alliances.\n\n\"This is a life-or-death thing for the health plan,\" Hamacher said. \"If the millage doesn't pass, the health plan is definitely in jeopardy, so this is just very important.\"\n\nCampaign finance statements show Barb and Dianne Byrum have contributed $290 to Elder's campaign for re-election this year, a race in which Elder is unopposed. Jim Byrum, president of the Michigan Agri-Business Association and Dianne Byrum's husband, contributed another $500 on June 11.\n\nState campaign finance reports show that Dianne Byrum, between 1998 and 2004, accepted more than $50,000 in contributions from the health care industry as a state legislator. Health professionals were the top contributors to her campaigns in 1998 and 2002. Barb Byrum also accepted more than $12,000 from health professionals and insurance companies in 2006, as well as a $500 donation from Elder.\n\nElder says the issue is not political.\n\n\"It's not a partisan issue at all,\" he said. \"My connection to it is more grassroots. I've done some door-to-door work, collecting signatures for the petition drive.\"\n\nCampaign finance\n\nFriends of Bay Health Plan turned in a campaign finance report on Friday, showing the group has raised more than $192,000 in political contributions since late June.\n\nThat includes $20,000 from Bay Regional Medical Center and $20,000 from HealthPlus of Michigan, a Flint company with which the Bay Health Plan has a financial arrangement for some management of the plan. The Bay Health Plan board put $150,000 of its own money toward the campaign.\n\n\"The board believes the cost of running the campaign is very small compared to the cost to our community of doing nothing,\" Dryzga said in an e-mail to The Times.\n\nReported campaign expenditures through Oct. 19 totaled $14,775.\n\nThe only major expense reported is $14,719 paid to Mundy Katowitz Media Inc., a Washington, D.C., firm that calls itself a \"Democratic media planning\" agency. It was started in 2002 by Janet Katowitz, a former officer of the Ingham County Democratic Party and deputy director of political operations for the Michigan Senate Democratic Caucus, along with business partner Carole Mundy.\n\nMany of the supporters of the Bay Health Plan are behind a Saginaw County proposal that asks voters to approve a 1-mill tax to fund the Saginaw Health Plan.\n\nAuburn resident Beverly Bradley, among the estimated 11,313 uninsured residents in Bay County, has a homemade sign in her yard supporting the Bay Health Plan.\n\n\"I started out working for the UAW and had insurance and health care and all that stuff. I really thought I was going to stay at that job the rest of my life,\" she said. \"I've worked ever since, but I just haven't been able to find a job with benefits.\"\n\nHampton Township resident Steve Batts said he's against the tax, no matter how much money Friends of Bay Health Plan spends trying to convince him otherwise.\n\n\"I know there is a health issue and it needs to be addressed,\" he said, \"but we can't do it with a countywide millage. To mandate that and say I have to pay for that, I'm totally against it.\""
