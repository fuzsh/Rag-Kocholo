Y. Mayorov , President of the Military Tribunal of the North Caucasian Front, of the case of the atrocities perpetrated by the German fascist invaders and their accomplices in the area of the city of Krasnodar and the Krasnodar Territory during the period of their temporary occupation. Justiciary Major General L. 7. Yachenin acted as State Prosecutor. The defendants in the case were: 7. Kladov , 7. KotomtseVy M. Lastovina, G. Misan , Y. Naptsoky V. Pavlov , 7. Paramonov , N. Push - kareVy 7. Rechkalov, V. Tishchenko and G. Tuchkov. They were charged with committing crimes covered by Articles 58-1 a and 51-1 b of the Criminal Code of the R.S.F.S.R., i.e., treason to the country. The accused were defended by Advocates A. I. Nazarevsky, V. 7. Yakunenko and S. K. Kaznacheyev as appointed by the court. The morning session on the 14th was taken up with the pre- liminary formalities. At the afternoon session the indictment was read and before the court there was unfolded a frightful picture of the wholesale murder of innocent Soviet citizens who were killed in thousands by the German fascist invaders during their temporary occupation of the Krasnodar Territory. The preliminary investigation, the indictment stated, had revealed that all these acts of murder, outrage, violence and plunder were committed by the punitive units of the German 17th Army, com- manded by Colonel General Ruoff. The immediate supervision and execution of all these acts of brutality were vested in the Krasnodar Gestapo, headed by the German Chief of the Gestapo, Colonel Christmann. 1 8 THE PEOPLE’S VERDICT The Gestapo had under its command a special punitive unit of the Secret Police called the Sonderkommando SS-\\Q-a, which was immediately responsible for the perpetration of all the atrocities. The investigation revealed that persons under arrest were tortured and that prisoners confined in the cellar of the Krasnodar Gestapo were burnt to death; that patients in the Krasnodar Municipal Hospital, at the Berezansk Medical Colony and also in the Territory Children’s Hospital at Tretya Rechka Kochety Farm, in the Ust- Labinskaya District, were killed wholesale. Lastly, the investigation revealed that many thousands of Soviet citizens were put to death by asphyxiation by means of carbon monoxide in motor vehicles specially equipped for this purpose, known as “murder vans.” The Sonderkommando SS-\\0-a was a punitive unit of the Gestapo, numbering about 200 men. The head of this Sonder- kommando was Colonel Christmann , a German, Chief of the Gestapo. His immediate assistants in the work of exterminating Soviet citizens were the German officers: Rabbe, Boss , Sargo , Salge, Hahn , Erich Meier , Paschen, Winz and Hans Munster , the German Army Surgeons in the prison and the Gestapo, Herz and Schuster and also officials of the Gestapo, the interpreters Jakob Eicks and Scherterlan. Furthermore, the following traitors, now before the court as defendants in the case, were recruited by the Gestapo and participated in the perpetration of all the aforementioned atrocities : V. Tishchenko, G. Tuchkov, I. Rechkalov, M. Lastovina, N. Pushkarev, G. Misan, J. Naptsok , I. Paramonov , 7. Kotomtsev, V. Pavlov and 7. Kladov. The investigation revealed the following definite cases of atrocities perpetrated by the German fascist invaders in the Krasnodar Territory : Soon after the occupation of Krasnodar, the cellar of the Krasnodar Gestapo was crammed with prisoners as a result of syste- matic raids upon and the wholesale arrest of the peaceful inhabitants. No investigation whatever was made into the cases of the hundreds and thousands of innocent people thus arrested. The latter were subjected to the most brutal violence and torture. Their fate was decided arbitrarily by Colonel Christmann , Chief of the Gestapo, who personally issued the orders for their physical extermination. In the autumn of 1942, the Germans began to utilize specially equipped motor vehicles, which the population called “murder vans,” for the purpose of doing away with Soviet citizens. These “murder vans” were covered five-ton or seven-ton grey- painted motor trucks, driven by Diesel engines. The interior of these vans was lined with zinc-plated sheet iron. At the back they KRASNODAR TRIAL 9 had double doors which closed hermetically. The floor consisted of a grating, beneath which there was a pipe that was connected with the exhaust pipe of the engine. The exhaust gas from the Diesel engine, which contained a high concentration of carbon monoxide, penetrated the interior of the van, causing the rapid poisoning and death from asphyxiation of the prisoners confined in it. Several times a week, and in January, before the Germans retreated from Krasnodar, two and three times a day, the “murder vans” were filled with people confined in the cellar of the Gestapo, which was situated in 61 Orjonikidze Street. The loading of the vans was usually supervised by Captain Rabbe, Deputy Chief of the Gestapo and Governor of the Gestapo prison. Before being dragged from the cellar the prisoners were stripped of their clothing; then they were bundled into the “murder van,” 60 to 80 at a time. The doors of the van were then hermetically closed and the engine started. After standing with the engine running for several minutes, the van would drive to an anti-tank trench which had been dug outside the Measuring Instruments Factory on the outskirts of Krasnodar. As a rule, the murder vans were escorted by a convoy of police from the Sonder- kommando SS-lO-a. By the time the vans reached the anti-tank trench the people were asphyxiated by the gas. The bodies were flung into the trench and buried. Men, women and children were bundled into the van without discrimination. In the course of time, in spite of the efforts the Germans made to keep this fiendish method of exterminating Soviet citizens a secret, the inhabitants living in the neighbourhood of the Gestapo premises, and, through them, the entire population, learned of the use to which these vans were being put. The prisoners in the cellar of the Gestapo also learned of the purpose of the “murder vans,” and on being loaded into them they offered resistance. At the time of loading the courtyard of the Gestapo premises echoed with their shrieks and wailing. Owing to this they were seized and dragged into the van by force. Soon after the engine was started the shrieks of these unfortunate people gradually subsided as they succumbed to the gases. Yevdokia Fedorovna Gazhik , who, one day, witnessed the forcible loading into the “murder van” of an arrested woman and her five- year-old daughter, stated as follows : “Into this ‘motor bus’ the Gestapo men were forcibly dragging a woman about thirty years of age. The woman refused to go into the van, resisted, and all the time tried to reach a little girl behind her, four or five years old, who was crying: ‘Mummy, Mummy, I want to ride with you.’ Unable to subdue the arrested 10 THE PEOPLE’S VERDICT woman, one of the Gestapo men seized the little girl and smeared her lips and nose with a thick black liquid. The child instantly fell unconscious. The Gestapo man picked her up and threw her into the van. On seeing this, the mother uttered a wild shriek and rushed at the Gestapo man. After struggling with the woman for several seconds the Gestapo man succeeded in overpowering her and dragged her into the van.” Not only prisoners, but people indiscriminately seized in the streets during wholesale raids were also put to death in the “murder vans.” When the anti-tank trenches were dug up, among the victims of the fascist fiends were found bodies clutching baskets and other receptacles with which these unfortunate people were going to town, to the market, and so forth. When the anti-tank trench in the region of State Farm No. 1 was dug up, many corpses were found which were afterwards identified by their relatives. Thus, Nikolai Kuzmich Kolomyitsev , an inhabitant of the city of Krasnodar, identified the body of his wife, Raissa Ivanovna Kolo- myitseva, whom the Gestapo had arrested on 2nd February, 1943. Vassily Nikolayevich Petrenko , a worker employed at the Krasnolit Works, identified the bodies of his wife, Vera Zinovyevna, of his son Yuri, seven years of age, and of his daughter Inna, three years of age. Petrenko’s wife and children were also arrested on 2nd February, 1943. Father Ilyashev, priest of St. George’s Church in the city of Krasnodar, personally identified Cyril Lugansky, Vladimir Golovaty and other inhabitants of the city of Krasnodar whom he had known. In August, 1942, the Surgeon of the Gestapo, the German Herz, came to the Municipal Hospital in Krasnodar and inquired how many patients there were in the hospital. Shortly afterwards Herz visited the hospital again, accompanied by several German army officers, who inspected the hospital and then drove away again. On 22nd August, Herz presented himself to Dr. Bashlayev, the head doctor of the hospital, and informed him and the other doctors that, in conformity with the orders received from the German Com- mand, the patients were to be “removed” from the hospital. Shortly afterwards a “murder van” arrived and patients were forcibly bundled into it. On the first occasion about eighty patients were loaded in the van, which drove away and soon returned. In the course of the next two hours the van made four journeys and carted away over 300 patients, all of whom were killed by the method described above, and their bodies flung into the anti-tank trench near the Measuring Instruments Factory. KRASNODAR TRIAL 11 The above facts were established by the depositions of witnesses Makarov , Kantonistov, Mokhno , and others. Thus, the witness Mokhno stated as follows : “After making several journeys, this same machine came to the building where the male patients lay. An order was received from the German officer to undress all the men who were capable of moving about, and to take them out to the van. Here, too, the patients raised a din with their groaning and shrieking, but the Germans brutally seized them and pushed them into the van. The gravely sick patients were brought out on stretchers and the Germans flung them into the van, too.” One day Ivan Ivanovich Kotov , an inhabitant of the city of Krasnodar, who had been discharged from this hospital long ago, came for a certificate just at the time when patients were being loaded into the van. One of the German officers who was supervising the loading caught sight of Kotov, seized him and pushed him into the “murder van.” When the doors were closed and the van started off, Kotov, feeling that he was being asphyxiated, tore his shirt off his back and moistening it with his own urine put it to his mouth and nose. After a while he lost consciousness. When he came to he found himself in an anti-tank trench among dead bodies which had been haphazardly flung into the trench. He climbed out and returned home. During the preliminary investigation Kotov stated as follows : “. . . A German who was standing near the car rushed at me shouting something I could not understand, seized me by the collar of my coat and pushed me into the van. When I got in I found a lot of people there. How many I cannot say. There were men and women. The van was packed. The people were standing pressed close against each other. The van was filled with groans, shrieks and wailing. The people were in a frenzy, for they had a presentiment that the German barbarians intended to subject them to frightful torture and death. After me another five persons were pushed into the van, after which the doors were slammed to and several minutes later it moved off. While it was in motion I felt that I was beginning to choke. I tore my shirt from my back, moistened it with my urine and put it over my mouth and nose. At once I felt some relief.” After the patients at the Krasnodar Hospital had been exterminated, only one ward with twenty beds was left for new patients. As a matter of fact this ward was nothing more than a trap, for Herz, the Gestapo surgeon, made two visits to the hospital for the new patients who had been placed in this ward and took them away in a “murder van.” 12 THE PEOPLE’S VERDICT On 5th September, 1942, this same Herz, Surgeon of the Gestapo, arrived at the Berezansk Medical Colony and informed the medical superintendent, Dr. Kireyev , in the presence of Dr. Shapovalova , that the van would arrive on 7th September to take the patients away, also to be exterminated. Dr. Kireyev begged Herz to leave at least the convalescents who were working in the vegetable plot. Herz consented and gave orders that the convalescents be put into a separate building. On the morning of 7th September a “murder van” arrived at the colony and the Germans, stripping the women patients naked, loaded them into it. Many of the patients tried to resist, but they were dragged into the “murder van” by force. In all 320 patients were taken from the Berezansk Colony and put to death in this manner. Their bodies were thrown into an anti-tank trench which was situated five kilometres from the colony. Several days later, a group of Germans, headed by an officer of the Gestapo named Hans Munster , arrived at the colony and took away everything of value as well as all the stocks of provisions. In October, 1942, seventeen patients arrived at the colony from Krasnodar, and these, too, were subsequently put to death in a “murder van.” As for the convalescents who were allowed to remain by Herz’s permission, on 20th October, 1942, sixty of them were bundled into a motor truck by order of Hans Munster and taken to an anti-tank trench, where they were shot. Just before the shooting, a woman patient named Marusya cried out in frenzy: “Our men will come and avenge us!” Munster beat this sick woman about the face and head with the butt of a rifle until she was covered with blood. Another patient named Dobuntsov tried to run away, but was killed by a rifle shot. In September, 1942, the Germans in the same manner organized the massacre of sick children in the Children’s Hospital situated in Tretya Rechka Kochety Farm, Ust-Labinskaya District, Krasnodar Territory. In this hospital, Erich Meier, an officer of the Gestapo, and Jakob Eicks, an interpreter, took up their quarters. On 21st September, 1942, Surgeon Herz and several other Germans arrived at the hospital in a passenger car accompanied by a “murder van,.” Forty-two sick children, dressed only in singlets and shorts, were bundled into the “murder van” and taken away and killed in the manner described above. The bodies of these little children were flung into a large pit which had been dug specially for the purpose in the vicinity of Chernyshevka Farm by the local inhabitants by order of Meier and Eicks, ostensibly as an anti-aircraft gun position. In the course of the preliminary investigation of this case, pits containing the bodies of the victims of the German fascist monsters KRASNODAR TRIAL 13 were dug up at thirteen places. Of the vast number of bodies found in these places, 623 were examined by medical experts. Of these bodies 85 were children, 256 women and 282 men, 198 being of advanced age. On the basis of the thorough medical, chemical and spectroscopic investigation which was carried out, a Committee of Experts consisting of Dr. V. I. Prozorovsky, Chief Medico-Legal Expert of the People’s Commissariat of Public Health of the U.S.S.R. ; V. M. Smolyaninov , Chief Medico-Legal Expert of the People’s Commissariat of Public Health of the R.S.F.S.R. ; Professor M. I. Avdey ev, D. M. Sc., Chief Medico-Legal Expert of the Red Army; Dr. P. S. Semenov sky. Consulting Physician of the Moscow City Medico-Legal Experts’ Department; and S. M. Sokolov , court chemist, arrived at the con- clusion that the cause of death in 523 of the cases examined was carbon monoxide poisoning, and that in 100 cases death was due to firearm wounds inflicted, in the majority of cases, in the head. In their report the Committee of Experts stated that the carbon monoxide could undoubtedly have had lethal effect if the waste gases from the Diesel engine penetrated the closed van. The Commission stated : “If the outlet for the carbon monoxide (including waste gases) is in closed premises, the concentration of carbon monoxide in those premises increases very rapidly and may cause death even in the course of a few minutes (from five to ten).” Thus, the report of the medical investigation fully confirmed the data obtained during the preliminary investigation concerning the wholesale and brutal extermination by the Gestapo of Soviet citizens held in custody by the Krasnodar Gestapo and also of other peaceful inhabitants, adults and children, lying as patients in the Krasnodar Hospital, the Berezansk Medical Colony and in the Territory Children’s Hospital. The total number of the Soviet citizens asphyxiated in “murder vans” is 7,000. The indictment also enumerated the established circumstances of the wholesale arrest and torture of Soviet citizens at the head- quarters of the Krasnodar Gestapo. In the cellar of the Gestapo premises, the prisoners were beaten every day. The officials of the Gestapo brutally assaulted them with ramrods and clubs, kicked them, stuck pins into the quick of then- nails, and so forth. After these tortures the prisoners were flung into their cells in a state of unconsciousness, disfigured beyond recognition. Particularly ferocious in torturing the prisoners were Colonel 14 THE PEOPLE’S VERDICT Christmann, Chief of the Krasnodar Gestapo, and Herz, the Surgeon of the Gestapo. The witness Miroshnikova , who had been held at the Gestapo premises for some time, stated as follows : “While I was in cell 1-1 at the Krasnodar Gestapo I saw Vera Bronnik, Irina Yatsenko, Grunya Grigoryeva, and a number of other Soviet girls and women return to the cell after interrogation in a battered condition. They told me that the officers of the Gestapo had stripped them naked and had flogged them and kicked them. Some of them were raped while under interrogation. When they returned to the cell the girls were covered with bruises and weals crusted with dried blood. Some of them, while in this state, were thrown into solitary confinement cells, where they were kept without water, or given salt water to drink.” According to the statements of the witness Gazhik , shrieks for help were constantly heard from the cellar where the prisoners were kept. Often she heard the prisoners shouting: “Give me a drop of water, or at least a crust of bread. The children are dying!” Before their flight from the city of Krasnodar owing to the advance of the Red Army the Gestapo committed another fiendish deed. On 10th February, 1943, the premises of the Gestapo were set on fire by a detachment of the Sonderkommando SS-10-a led by an officer named Hahn. The rapid spread of the flames and the explosion of mines which had been placed in the premises prevented the saving of the prisoners from the burning building. Only one prisoner managed to escape from the flames, but it was impossible to ascertain who he was as he died soon after as a result of the tortures to which he had been subjected and of the bums he had received in the fire. This was confirmed by the statements of the witnesses Rozhkova, Dobrova and Gazhik, and by defendant Pushkarev. The total number of arrested Soviet citizens who died a painful death in the fire at the premises of the Gestapo is 300. Some of the charred bodies subsequently found in the cellar of the Gestapo premises bore traces of fiendish torture and torment. Thus, the body of an unidentified male of middle age was found with the hands lopped off. In their bmtal efforts to destroy as many Soviet citizens as possible, the German fascist gangsters did not hesitate to resort to the vilest tricks. One day, for example, the inhabitants of the city were informed that tripe would be on sale in the New Market. The inhabitants believed this announcement and gathered in the market. Instead of stalls selling tripe, they found a covered motor truck filled with police and German soldiers guarding an unidentified sailor of the Red Navy. In the presence of the crowd this sailor was hanged KRASNODAR TRIAL 15 on a post. As the noose was being put round his neck the sailor cried out to the weeping crowd : “Don’t weep! These butchers of the people will answer for this with thousands of their lives. Our men will be here soon and will avenge all this!” On another occasion the German Command announced to the inhabitants of the city that several thousand Red Army prisoners of war would be led through the city and that the inhabitants would be permitted to give them food. A large number of the inhabitants of Krasnodar came into the streets expecting to meet the prisoners and brought small parcels of food with them. But instead of Soviet prisoners of war they found motor trucks filled with German wounded soldiers and, as the trucks drew near, a German cinema operator photographed the scene to produce a picture which the German provocateurs intended to use to illustrate how Soviet citizens “wel- comed” German soldiers. Summing up the fiendish crimes established by the investigation, the indictment stated that the entire responsibility for the atrocities and crimes perpetrated during the period of the occupation of the city of Krasnodar and the Krasnodar Territory, responsibility for the torture and torment, for the wholesale shooting and fiendish exter- mination with the aid of asphyxiating gases in specially constructed vehicles, for the burning and other methods of murdering absolutely innocent Soviet citizens, including the aged, women and children, rested upon the heads of the piratical fascist Government of Germany and the German High Command, and, in particular, on the Com- mander of the 17th Army, Colonel General Ruoff, and also on the immediate executors of these fiendish deeds, viz. : Christmann — Colonel, Chief of the Krasnodar Gestapo, Rabbe — Captain, Deputy Chief of the Gestapo, Salge — Officer of the Gestapo, Sargo — Officer of the Gestapo, Paschen — Officer of the Gestapo, Boss — Officer of the Gestapo, Winz — Investigator of the Gestapo, Hahn— Officer of the Gestapo, Hans Miinster — Officer of the Gestapo, Erich Meier — Officer of the Gestapo, Herz — Surgeon of the Gestapo, Schuster — Surgeon of the Gestapo, Jakob Eicks — Official of the Gestapo, Scherterlan— Official of the Gestapo. In addition, the following were charged with complicity in all 16 THE PEOPLE’S VERDICT these atrocities and crimes and had been brought into the case as defendants: V. Tishchenko , G. Tuchkov, I. Rechkalov , M. Lastovina , N. Pushkarev , G. Misan , /. Naptsok, I. Paramonov, I. Kotomtsev, V. Pavlov and 7. Kladov. All the accused pleaded guilty to the charges brought against them. During the preliminary investigation they had given detailed evidence of their treasonable activities and of the part they had played in the atrocities committed by the German fascist invaders. The reading of the indictment was followed by a brief adjournment, after which the Military Tribunal proceeded to examine the defendants. The first to be examined was Tishchenko who, in answer to the questions put to him, admitted that he had treasonably, and of his own accord, joined the German Police Force in the occupied region and had been promoted to the rank of Police Inspector. Later he was transferred to the Gestapo, where he first served as a Sergeant- major in the Sonderkommando and then as a Gestapo investigator. The State Prosecutor, Justice Major General Yachenin, requested the defendant to describe the Gestapo’s method of operations. Tishchenko confessed that it was a method of savage and unbridled tyranny and the wholesale extermination of Soviet citizens. The State Prosecutor: “Describe this more definitely, and in greater detail.” Tishchenko : “No charges were levelled against persons arrested by the Gestapo, no witnesses were called and no confrontations were arranged. The officers who interrogated the prisoners were always drunk. They flogged the prisoners with ramrods, clubs and whips, kicked them with their hobnailed boots, and tore out their hair and their finger nails. Christmann, Rabbe, Salge, Sargo and other officers raped arrested women.” The State Prosecutor : “Was that a regular practice ?” Tishchenko : “Yes, a regular practice.” Proceeding with his evidence Tishchenko, while doing his utmost to minimize the part he had played, admitted that he had personally assaulted prisoners, and that, on reports which he had sent in, the Soviet citizens Sarkissov and Patushinsky were shot by the Gestapo, while others were sent to a concentration camp. The accused was questioned about the “murder vans,” i.e., the motor vehicles specially equipped for the purpose of brutally putting Soviet citizens to death. Tishchenko answered in great detail showing that he was quite familiar with the whole business. These vans were five-ton or seven-ton motor trucks, he said, with bodies built over them. These had double walls and false windows which gave The Hall in which the Trial was held Prominent Soviet citizens at the trial. In the centre Alexei Tolstoy KRASNODAR TRIAL 17 them the appearance of motor buses. At the rear of each vehicle there was a door which closed hermetically. The floor consisted of a grating under which ran the exhaust pipe from the Diesel engine by which the vehicle was driven. The exhaust gas penetrated the interior of the vehicle. When the vehicle was standing with the engine running, death ensued within seven minutes ; when it was in motion death ensued in ten minutes. The prisoners learned that a horrible death awaited them in these vans and, therefore, strongly resisted when they were being forced into them and shouted for help. When that happened the Gestapo officials grabbed their victims and bundled them into the vans by main force. The loading of these “murder vans” was usually supervised by Colonel Christmann, Chief of the Gestapo, Rabbe, and other German officers. Tishchenko stated that one day he was present when 67 adults and 18 children were bundled into a “murder van.” The State Prosecutor inquired about the ages of the children. Tishchenko answered: “From one to five years.” At this reply a gasp of horror went up from the public in the hall. Both the President of the Tribunal and the State Prosecutor tried to elicit from Tishchenko how he came to be promoted so rapidly to Police Inspector, Sergeant-major in the Sonderkommando and then to Investigator of the Gestapo, but he did all he could to wriggle out of these questions. At last, in reply to the question put to him by the President of the Tribunal: “We must assume that the Germans trusted you, since they promoted you so rapidly, is that not so ?” — Tishchenko answered : “Yes, they trusted me.” The accused pleaded guilty to the charge of treason to his country, of having voluntarily deserted to the enemy, of having entered the service of the German Police, and later of the Gestapo, of having participated in the work of tracking down Soviet citizens, and of having assaulted, tortured and exterminated them wholesale. This concluded the proceedings of the session of 14th July. Morning Session, 15th July At the morning session of 15th July, the examination of the accused was continued. In the course of the proceedings the fiendish crimes committed by the German fascist invaders and their accom- plices— the wholesale extermination of Soviet citizens, the torture, rapine and plunder which these Hitlerites perpetrated in the area of the city of Krasnodar and of the Krasnodar Territory — were fully brought to light. Of the eleven accused, ten had served [in the so-called Sonder- B 18 THE PEOPLE’S VERDICT kommando SS- 10-tf, the punitive unit of the Gestapo. All had voluntarily joined this body and had zealously fulfilled all their infamous duties, doing their utmost to win the approval of their German masters. The Germans had recruited for the Sonder- kommando , as well as for their Police Force, criminal elements, embezzlers and thieves, who had been sentenced by Soviet courts and had served various terms of imprisonment (such as Rechkalov, Kotomtsev and Tuchkov), and also former kulaks and other persons hostile to the Soviet regime. The morning session commenced with the continuation of the examination of Tishchenko. The latter supplemented the evidence he had given on the previous day with additional facts about the blood-curdling atrocities which the German invaders had committed against peaceful Soviet citizens. He quoted numerous cases of outrage perpetrated by Colonel Christmann, the Chief of the Gestapo, and by Rabbe, Salge, Sargo and other officers of the Gestapo against Soviet women ; he related how prisoners in the cellar of the Gestapo premises who were dying of thirst were given salt water to drink, how women were bundled into the “murder van” and their children flung in after them as if they were logs of wood. In one case which he had witnessed, a mother could no longer bear to see her child’s sufferings and rushed forward to help it, but was knocked down with the butt end of a rifle. The child, which was being forcibly dragged into the “murder van,” bit the hand of its tormentor, whereupon another German crushed its skull with the butt end of his rifle. The next to be examined was the accused Pushkarev. He too stated that he had voluntarily entered the service of the Gestapo and had been soon promoted to the post of Gruppenfuhrer (Platoon Commander). He, with other Gestapo officials, had visited the stanitsas (Cossack villages). The State Prosecutor requested Pushkarev to describe these journeys in greater detail. The accused stated the following: “We were provided with false papers and sent to the stanitsas ostensibly as Soviet prisoners of war who had been released from camp. We were instructed to track down Soviet citizens who had been publicly active, and also those who sympathized with the guerrillas. During one journey we visited Anapa where I witnessed the shooting by the Germans of twenty peaceful inhabitants. These people were stripped naked, pushed into a pit which had been dug for them, and then shot point-blank with automatic rifles.” The State Prosecutor then requested the defendant to relate what he knew about the atrocities perpetrated by the Gestapo. Pushkarev quoted a number of cases, each more frightful than the other. KRASNODAR TRIAL 19 “One day,” he said, “a family of three was brought to the Gestapo : the husband, a sick man, his wife, and a ten-year-old child. The husband was so sick that he had to be carried; nevertheless he was stripped half-naked and flung into the cellar. It was a very cold day, the temperature being far below zero. All night the sentries standing over the cellar heard groans and cries for assistance. By the morning these cries subsided. The prisoner had been frozen to death.” In answer to a question Pushkarev stated that as Gruppenfuhrer he often acted as Chief of the Guard of the Gestapo. The State Prosecutor : “That is to say, you guarded the victims of the Gestapo ?” Pushkarev : “Yes, I saw people brought to the Gestapo premises, taken for interrogation and returning to the cells. Only rarely did they walk back to the cells after interrogation. In most cases they were carried or dragged back with their faces disfigured, their bodies covered with bruises and bleeding weals, and their limbs broken. The cruellest of the German officials was Colonel Christmann, the Chief of the Gestapo, but on the whole there was not much to choose between him and the other German officers.” From his further evidence it transpired that Gruppenfuhrer Push- karev was extremely “exacting” towards his subordinates. “This is not the Soviet regime. The Germans have trained us differently,” he said to one of his subordinates one day. Once, in December, a woman who had just been brought to the Gestapo tried to escape and would have succeeded, but Gruppenfuhrer Pushkarev, desiring to win the favour of the Germans, ordered the sentry to shoot. The latter hesitated, so Pushkarev snatched the rifle from his hand and shot the woman himself. Pushkarev fully corroborated the evidence of the other accused concerning the “murder vans.” His evidence on this point was particularly valuable because he had directly participated in loading prisoners into these frightful vehicles. In reply to questions put to him Pushkarev stated: “The loading was supervised by Christmann, Rabbe, Dr. Herz, and other German officers. First women were bundled into the vans, and then men. Once, when I was present, eleven children were flung into a van; of these a number were suckling babes. The air was rent with weeping and wailing. Whoever resisted was beaten until he or she was nearly dead and then simply flung into the van. The door was then closed and the engine started.” Pushkarev stated that he was the last of the members of the Sonderkommando to leave the premises of the Gestapo when the 20 THE PEOPLE’S VERDICT Germans fled from Krasnodar on the advance of the Red Army. Here he was a participant in another fiendish crime which the German invaders committed. “Before the Germans left,” he said, “the cells were crammed with prisoners. I was on guard then and heard shots and shrieks in the cellar. A number of German officers emerged from the cellar and soon after huge flames burst from the windows. I realized that these officers had set fire to the building with these prisoners locked in. The shrieks became louder and rose to a pitch of frenzy, but gradually they subsided.” The State Prosecutor : “Why were you acting as sentry on that occasion ? Was it to prevent the unfortunate victims from escaping ?” Pushkarev : “Yes, when the people had been burnt to death the guard was removed.” In the course of his evidence Pushkarev revealed the vile tricks the German invaders resorted to. Thus, they tried to palm off the people whom the Gestapo had brutally killed as “victims of the Soviet regime.” One day, according to Pushkarev, the Germans circulated a rumour to the effect that a contingent of Soviet prisoners of war would pass through the town and that the people would be permitted to give them food. When the people assembled in the street through which the prisoners were expected to pass, a train of motor trucks carrying German wounded appeared and German cinema operators photographed the scene. The purpose of this, as Pushkarev said in his evidence, was to produce a film showing how the inhabitants of Krasnodar had come out to welcome the German wounded soldiers. In concluding his evidence Pushkarev stated that one day Winz, one of the German detectives of the Gestapo, while under the influence of drink, had confided to him that a secret order had been received from Colonel General Ruoff, the Commander of the German 17th Army, to the effect that, when retreating from Krasnodar, the Germans were not to leave a stone standing in the city, that everything was to be put to the flames, and that as many Soviet citizens as possible were to be slaughtered and the rest carried away with the retreating German forces. The successful offensive of the Red Army, however, prevented the Hitlerites from carrying out their fiendish designs to the full. The next to be examined was the accused Rechkalov. He admitted that he had been an embezzler and thief and had served two sentences of imprisonment passed upon him by Soviet courts, and that he had voluntarily joined the Gestapo. The State Prosecutor : “Why did .you do that ?” KRASNODAR TRIAL 21 Rechkalov : “I wanted a job with as little work and as much pay as possible.” Like the other defendants, Rechkalov admitted that he had taken part in rounding up Soviet citizens, had stood guard over Soviet prisoners and had zealously carried out all the orders of his German masters. One day he formed part of the convoy which escorted a “murder van” to an anti-tank trench. Concerning this incident he stated the following : “While the people were being loaded into the van they strenuously resisted. One woman shouted : ‘What are you doing ? Why, I have not been interrogated once!’ When all the people had been loaded into the van and the van had started off it was followed by twelve mounted men from the Sonderkommando, including myself. The van stopped at the anti-tank trench and we began to unload. All the people were dead. From the appearance of the bodies it was evident that they had undergone frightful suffering. One woman clasped a tuft of hair which she had tom from her head. Among the bodies I saw several children.” The accused Misan was then examined. In answer to the questions put to him by the President and the State Prosecutor he, mumbling rapidly, related how he had taken part in loading prisoners, including women and children, in the “murder van.” In particular, he related that he had voluntarily offered to shoot Constable Gubsky, whom the Germans had suspected of being secretly in sympathy with the Soviet regime, and that, after performing this executioner’s job, he had won the confidence of the officers of the Gestapo. In reply to further questions Misan tried to wriggle and deny his guilt, but Paramonov and Naptsok, Rechkalov and other accused, on being interrogated, exposed him as an agent of the Gestapo, a provocateur and a spy. Evidence was then given by Kotomtsev. He admitted that he had served in the Red Army but had voluntarily deserted to the enemy and had accepted service in the German Police Force and later in the Gestapo. He also admitted .that he had taken part in three punitive expeditions against Soviet citizens. “One of these punitive expeditions,” he stated in the course of his evidence, “was commanded by Colonel Christmann, the Chief of the Gestapo, himself. During that expedition a girl, whose identity was not ascertained, was hanged on suspicion of being in communica- tion with the guerrillas. But that was not enough. All the inhabitants of this village were driven from their homes.” “How did the German Command reward you for this ?” inquired the State Prosecutor. 22 THE PEOPLE’S VERDICT At first Kotomtsev pretended that he did not understand the question, but finally he admitted that he was officially thanked by the Chief of the Gestapo. The State Prosecutor : “What for ? For faithfully serving the German invaders ? For helping them to exterminate Soviet people ?” “Yes,” answered Kotomtsev, thus himself summing up his criminal and treasonable activities. The accused Naptsok was then summoned to give evidence. The President asked him : “Were you aware that the Sonderkommando was a punitive body of the Gestapo and that its main function was to exterminate Soviet citizens ?” “Yes,” answered the accused. The President : “Consequently, you deliberately betrayed your country and deserted to the worst enemy of your people ?” Naptsok (after a brief pause) : “Yes, deliberately.” The last to be examined at the morning session was the defendant Tuchkov , who fully admitted that on entering the service of the Gestapo he did his utmost to win the favour of the German officers and that he had taken an active part in all the terroristic and pro- vocational activities of the Gestapo in the area of the city of Krasnodar and the Krasnodar Territory. Afternoon Session, 15th July During the afternoon session the accused Kladov , Paramonov , Pavlov and Lastovina were examined. Their evidence supplemented the picture described by the previous accused. In particular, they corroborated all that had been said about the “murder vans” which the German fiends had invented for exterminating Soviet people. It transpired from their evidence that at first the “murder vans” made their appearance on definite days in the week. Later on, however, when the Red Army had passed to the offensive and the German invaders realized that they would soon be compelled to flee from Krasnodar, they began to exterminate Soviet people with feverish haste, and the “murder vans” were worked to the utmost capacity, making several journeys a day. In all, according to as yet incomplete figures, they put to death in this way as many as 7,000 people, including hundreds of children. All the accused pleaded guilty to the charges of having actively assisted the German invaders in their acts of rapine and murder against the inhabitants of Krasnodar and the Krasnodar Territory. All of them admitted that they had voluntarily taken service in the KRASNODAR TRIAL 23 Gestapo, had carried out all the fiendish orders of the German officers, and had directly participated in the wholesale extermination of Soviet citizens. The accused Lastovina, who had been employed as a male nurse at the Berezansk Medical Colony where there were hundreds of patients, stated in his evidence that after the Germans had brutally put to death the majority of the patients in their “murder vans” they rounded up the rest and carted them to an anti-tank trench in motor trucks. He, Lastovina, was ordered to escort the trucks containing these doomed people, and he gladly consented. “When the patients were being loaded on the trucks,” he con- tinued, “they struggled and begged to be spared, but the Germans bundled them in. One woman patient named Marusya struggled more than the rest, and as she was overpowered she shouted: ‘Our men will avenge all this!’ — whereupon a German officer cracked her skull and flung her into the truck. All the patients were taken to an anti-tank trench five kilometres away and there they were pulled out of the truck in batches of five. I undressed them and, after they were shot, threw their bodies into the trench.” After a brief adjournment the court proceeded to examine the witnesses. In their evidence the witnesses drew a frightful picture of the orgy of terrorism indulged in by the Hitlerites and of the incredible outrages and tortures to which they subjected the inhabitants of the towns and villages they had occupied. The first to be examined was the witness Klimova , who related what she had herself seen and experienced when she was arrested and thrown into the cellar of the Gestapo. “lie women in my cell,” she stated, “were unrecognizable when they returned from interrogation. I vividly remember the story told by a girl who came back to the cell after interrogation. The German officers had ordered her to be stripped and tied naked to a table. They then started a gramophone and while the music was playing they beat the girl almost to death. Then they began to interrogate her, but she refused to confess anything and so they started the gramophone again and beat her until the record was played out. This went on for two hours.” The public in the hall listened with bated breath to the evidence of the witness Golovaty , who said : “My son, a member of the Young Communist League, 17 years of age, was arrested and taken to the Gestapo. From that moment I did not see him alive again. I saw him only after the Germans had been driven from Krasnodar, but he was dead. I found his body frightfully mutilated in an anti-tank trench, Around him there were 24 THE PEOPLE’S VERDICT many other bodies, including those of women and little children. The bodies had been thrown into the trench in rows, one on top of the other. I was accompanied by another workman from our factory and he discovered the frightfully mutilated bodies of his wife and little child.” The witness identified the accused in the prisoners’ dock and denounced them as vile traitors to their country and active accomplices of the Hitlerites in all the foul crimes and outrages they had committed against Soviet citizens. Morning Session, 16th July At the morning session on 16th July, the examination of witnesses was continued. The Military Tribunal heard the evidence of 22 wit- nesses who had either themselves been in the clutches of the Gestapo, had lost relatives and friends, or had witnessed the frightful crimes committed by the fascist invaders. The proceedings were opened by the examination of the witness Kolomyitsev, who stated : ‘‘In the beginning of February my wife was arrested and I did not see her again until 28th February — she was dead, and lying in an anti-tank trench. Her face was marked with livid vertical streaks.” The State Prosecutor : “Were there many other bodies in the trench ?” Kolomyitsev : “Thousands! What was very noticeable was the number of little children, many of them tiny infants, also women and aged men. Many of the bodies bore obvious traces of ferocious beating and torture. The majority bore no signs of injury from firearms; it was evident that they had been asphyxiated by some poisonous substance.” The State Prosecutor : “What had you known about the German atrocities previous to that ?” Kolomyitsev : “The Germans began to exterminate Soviet citizens on the very first day they occupied the city, but at the end of January this assumed a wholesale character. Gallows were erected all over the town ; people were also hanged on telegraph poles. I remember the body of one man hanging for several days. To his chest was attached a tablet bearing the inscription: ‘He stole firewood from Germany.’ He was hanged for taking a few twigs from the cemetery.” The next to be examined was the witness Petrenko, who stated : “Shortly after the Germans arrived in Krasnodar I was summoned to the Gestapo premises and there called upon to divulge the where- abouts of Soviet citizens who, to my knowledge, had been active in KRASNODAR TRIAL 25 public life. I had no desire to be a traitor, and so I secretly left the town to hide in a stanitsa. My wife and two children did not manage to get away, and in revenge for my escape the Gestapo arrested them.” The State Prosecutor : “How old were the children ?” Petrenko : “The boy was seven years old and the girl three.” The State Prosecutor : “Please continue.” Petrenko : “After Krasnodar was liberated from the German .invaders I returned and began searching for my wife and children. Wherever I went, in all the cellars of the Gestapo, I found bodies of people whom the Hitlerites had burnt to death. At last I went to the anti-tank trench. There I found dead bodies in countless numbers. Among them I found my wife and daughter. Both were stripped naked. I found my son in the same trench two weeks later. As we learned afterwards, they had all been asphyxiated in a ‘murder van’. ” The State Prosecutor : “What did you see in the cellars of the Gestapo when you were searching for the bodies of your wife and children ?” Petrenko : “I saw the bodies of people who had been burnt to death. By their pose one could see that they had suffered frightful agony before they died, and had made desperate efforts to get out of the cellar.” Petrenko was followed in the witness stand by Agrippina Antonovna Korolchuk , an old lady who lived near the anti-tank trench into which the Germans had flung their victims. In her evidence this witness stated : “Large covered motor vans passed our house on their way to the trench every day. They were usually escorted by mounted men carrying spades. One day a van got stuck in the mud and, try as they would, the Germans could not drag it out. They drove us all into the house so that we should not see what was going on, but I peeped through the window and saw a cart ride up to the van and into this cart the Germans began to unload dead bodies from the van. They would fill the cart with as many bodies as it would hold, take it off to the trench, unload, and come back for more. This they did six or seven times, until all the bodies had been carted to the trench.” The wholesale slaughter of peaceful Soviet citizens by the German invaders was corroborated by the witness Talashchenko, who also lived near the anti-tank trench. In her evidence she stated : “Among those whom the Germans brought here to be shot every day were many women and children. I can still hear their heart- rending shrieks: ‘My God, how many of us innocents are here!’ The ‘murder van’ also came to the anti-tank trench every day. It was backed right up to the edge of the parapet, the doors were opened 26 THE PEOPLE’S VERDICT and the bodies flung out as if they were logs of wood. The Germans threw a few shovelfuls of earth over the bodies and rode away.” The next witness was Father Ilyashev, the aged priest of St. George’s Church, who, in his evidence, told of numerous Russian families whom the Germans had robbed of their bread-winners, of mothers who had been tortured to death, and of sons and daughters who had been killed. “The very next day after the Germans fled from Krasnodar,” he said, “I was invited to visit a family which had suffered a great bereavement. They had just brought home the body of their only son whom the fascist butchers had killed. The day after that I visited the family of my friend Lugansky, a photographer. I had seen him quite shortly before that, and now I was invited to perform the last rites over him. ‘Did the Germans kill him ?’ I asked. ‘Yes, Father, the Germans, may they be cursed!’ — was the answer. I could not read the prayers, for tears streamed from my eyes and I thought of the innumerable Russian people who, for no reason at all, had been put to death on their own native soil by those German monsters. My neighbour, Raissa Ivanovna, also died at their accursed hands. I knew her family very well indeed, a friendly, industrious Russian family. The Germans asphyxiated Raissa Ivanovna with some poisonous substance; her body bore no sign of wounds; only her face was lined with livid streaks.” Continuing, Father Ilyashev said : “Many of my parishioners told me that on the day before they left, the Germans put on Red Army uniforms and went from house to house saying : ‘What are you waiting for, citizens ? The Red Army is here already. Go and help it.’ Credulous people believed them and ran out into the streets, some of them taking hidden arms with them. But the German provocateurs pounced upon them and killed them out of hand. “All that the Germans have done here — their wholesale repressions, round-ups, and extermination of thousands of innocent people— utterly convinced me of what the Germans are. I testify here, before the entire Russian nation, before the whole world, that they are savage beasts, and I cannot find the words with which to express our hatred and curses for these fiends!” The witness Skrynnikova, in her evidence, corroborated the story about the vile trick the Germans played on the inhabitants of Krasnodar by circulating the rumour about Red Army prisoners passing through the town. She said : “One day the Germans announced that on such and such a date a contingent of Red Army prisoners would pass by the Cathedral, and that whoever desired to give them food would be permitted KRASNODAR TRIAL 27 to do so. Thousands of people gathered. But instead of Red Army- men we found motor trucks with German wounded. German photo- graphers climbed on the balconies of the houses near by, and on tele- graph poles, and photographed the scene in order to make pictures to illustrate how the people of Krasnodar welcomed the German army. After the motor trucks had passed the Germans began to disperse the crowd, prodding them with their rifles.” A deep impression on the court was made by the evidence of the witness Kozelsky , a physician at the Krasnodar Municipal Hospital. He stated : “A few days after the Germans occupied the town, the alleged surgeon, but actually the butcher of the Gestapo, Herz, came to our hospital and inquired how many patients were there, and who they were. Several days later he came again, accompanied by a group of German officers. On 22nd August, the corridors of the hospital again echoed with the tramp of these German jack-boots. On Herz’s orders all the doctors of the hospital were assembled in the head doctor’s office and there Herz unhitched his revolver from his belt, laid it on the desk, and in broken Russian asked: ‘Communists, Young Com- munist Leaguers, Jews, any such here ?’ He was informed that none of the doctors were either Communists or Jews. He then went on to say: ‘I am a German officer. I have received orders to remove all the patients from here. The German Command has ordered that there must be no sick persons in war time. They must be exter- minated. How they are to be exterminated is no business of yours.’ “Deathly silence reigned in the office. Everybody’s face was as pallid as chalk. Somebody asked : ‘What about the convalescents ? They are almost well.’ ‘I shall tell you what to do with them,’ answered Herz roughly, ‘but now I must proceed to business.’ “I went into the courtyard,” continued the witness, “and there I found that while Herz had been speaking to us the loading of the ‘murder vans’ had already started. At first the patients did not realize what was happening ; they were told that they were being transferred to another hospital. But later they guessed. The shrieks and groans that then went up were truly heartrending. When the ‘murder van’ was packed to its fullest capacity it went off and returned for another load. In the course of several journeys the Germans murdered over 300 patients. I must add that, after killing all the patients, the Germans left a small ward with about twenty beds for new patients. But this turned out to be a trap in which to entice fresh victims for the slaughter. The ‘murder van’ came again once or twice to take away the unfor- tunate victims who had fallen into this trap. Afterwards we learned that the same thing had happened at the Children’s Hospital at Tretya 28 THE PEOPLE S VERDICT Rechka Kochety. People who witnessed the scene there informed me that when the children had been loaded and the van had moved off, piercing shrieks and the wailing of children were heard from the interior of the van. Members of the hospital staff afterwards identified their little patients who had been brutally murdered by the German fiends. When one pit was opened, forty-two bodies of children were found wearing underclothing with the hospital’s stamp.” All these facts were corroborated by the witness Anokhina , who added that the patients who were unable to walk were carried out by the Germans on stretchers and flung into the van. The tragic scenes that occurred at the Berezansk Medical Colony were described by the witness Mokhno. She stated the following : “One day a German officer came to the colony and roughly ordered us to assemble all the patients in the courtyard. Some of the patients resisted and they had their arms twisted behind their backs. They were beaten and pushed into the van by main force. I heard a German soldier say to somebody, laughingly: ‘Russian patients kaput with gas!’ ” This witness gave details of another vile trick the Germans per- petrated on the inhabitants of Krasnodar. She said : “One day the rumour was spread that tripe would be on sale in the New Market. A large crowd gathered in the market, for since the Germans had been bossing the town everybody was starving. The crowd stood and waited. Suddenly a motor truck drove up and from it the Germans dragged a man wearing a sailor’s uniform. They put a noose round his neck and made preparations to hang him. The women were petrified with horror. Many of them began to weep. The sailor shouted: ‘Don’t weep! Our men will be here soon and will avenge all this!’ ” The next witness to be examined was Kotov, whom the Germans had seized and bundled into the “murder van,” but who had saved himself by his coolness and resourcefulness. In his evidence he stated : “On 22nd August, I went to the Third Municipal Hospital, where I had been a patient, to obtain a certificate. When I arrived in the courtyard the first thing I noticed was a large van with a dark grey body. Before I had managed to take a couple of steps a German officer seized me by the collar of my coat and pushed me into the van. The van was packed with people, some of them quite naked, others only in their underclothing. The door was slammed to and the van moved off. Several minutes later I felt bad and began to lose con- sciousness. At one time I had taken a course of anti-gas bombing drill and I soon realized what was happening — we were being poisoned with some kind of gas. I tore off my shirt, moistened it with my urine KRASNODAR TRIAL 29 and pressed it to my nose and mouth. I began to breathe more easily, but I lost consciousness all the same. When I came to I found myself in a pit among scores of dead bodies. I managed to climb out of the pit somehow and crept home with great difficulty.” A frightful picture of the extermination of children by the German invaders was drawn by the witness Inozemtseva , a member of the staff of the Children’s Hospital. In her evidence she stated : “On 13th September a group of German officers arrived at the Children’s Hospital. Among them were Erich Meier and Jakob Eicks. They stayed at the hospital several days, roaming about the wards, watching the children and the medical staff. Going on duty on 23rd September, I saw a large dark grey vehicle in the courtyard, which looked something like a furniture van. A tall German roughly asked me how many people lived in the neighbourhood of the hospital and what nationality they were. This German proved to be Doctor Herz, one of the most brutal of the Gestapo butchers. He had arrived with a number of other Germans who, on his orders, began to put the children into the van. We were not allowed to dress the children, although we were fold that they were being taken to Stavropol — and that meant a long journey. The children were dressed only in singlets and shorts. When all the children had been loaded in the van the butchers slammed the door and the van moved off, followed by a motor car in which there were several German officers. Twenty or twenty- five minutes later they returned and began drinking. ... I shall never forget those little children — some of them were only a year old. They cried and shrieked, instinctively feeling that something terrible was going to happen to them. Volodya Zuzuyev, one of our little boy patients, cried out : ‘Good-bye Comrade Stalin, good-bye nursies. I -am never coming back any more!’ I shall never forget that frightful day as long as I live.” Inozemtseva’s evidence was fully corroborated by the witness Popovich, who stated that the Germans put to death in their diabolical “murder van” no less than forty-two child patients at the Tretya Rechka Kochety Children’s Hospital. The witness Ivko, who lives on the outskirts of Krasnodar, stated in her evidence that she had been an involuntary witness of what had taken place after the “murder van” had left the gates of the Children’s Hospital. She said : “One day some Germans came to our district and compelled the inhabitants to go out and to dig a large pit, which, they said, was to serve as a position for an anti-aircraft gun. We were afraid to disobey and so we went out and dug the pit. Several days later a large grey motor van stopped outside our co-operative store. A German 30 THE PEOPLE’S VERDICT jumped down from the driver’s cabin and ran towards the collective farm office. I walked up to the machine and heard what I thought were stifled groans. I listened again ; they were indeed groans coming from inside the van. I heard footsteps and quickly skipped away from the van. I saw the German coming out of the office and heard him swearing terribly at our book-keeper, saying: ‘You — so and so — Russian swine, get me a spade, I don’t care where you get it from!’ When they got him a spade he drove the van straight to the pit which we had dug several days previously. About fifteen minutes later a motor car, with German officers in it, arrived at the pit. “We then got an inkling of what was going to happen and we began to cry. We were sure that these scoundrels had come here to kill guerrillas, or Jews. Soon, a little girl came running towards us, her face distorted with horror. It appeared that she had been at the pit raking the fresh earth with which it had been filled and had discovered a child’s dark-blue singlet. Later we learned that here the Germans had buried the child patients from the Tretya Rechka Kochety Children’s Hospital, whom they had killed with gas in their ‘murder van’.” Evidence was then given by the witness Rozhkova , who stated : “On the night before the Germans fled from Krasnodar a stranger came to our house, or rather crawled into our house. It turned out that he was a Red Armyman who had been taken prisoner by the Germans. He was an Uzbek. He told us that he had escaped from the cellar of the Gestapo premises after the Germans had set fire to the building. We gave him something to drink and put him to bed, but all our efforts were in vain. Soon after he died.” The State Prosecutor : Describe his appearance. Rozhkova : He was covered with wounds and burns. His jaw was knocked to one side. The State Prosecutor : Did he manage to tell you anything ? Rozhkova : The only thing he managed to tell us was that there had been forty men in his cell, but he was the only one to get away. All the rest were burnt to death.” The last to be examined was the witness Gazhik, who lived in the house next to the premises of the Gestapo. She stated : “When I swept the pavement outside my house I kept my eyes open to see what was going on in that place. I often heard women’s shrieks and children crying. The sounds came from the cellar of the Gestapo. Often the prisoners would beg in a feeble voice : ‘Give us at least a sip of water.’ Sometimes, when the sentry was not looking, I managed to push a cupful of water or a crust of bread through the grating and KRASNODAR TRIAL 31 then I would hear excited children’s voices saying: ‘Don’t drink it all; leave me a little drop!’ “Through the fence I saw them loading people in the ‘murder van.’ With my own ears I heard a five-year-old girl, not understanding what was going on, shout to her mother who was being dragged into the van: ‘Mummy, I want to ride with you!’ A German officer took a small tube from his pocket, squeezed it and smeared the little girl’s lips with some stuff. The little girl seemed to have been stunned. The German picked her up and threw her into the van. The mother rushed at the brute and scratched and bit his face. Other Germans rushed at her, twisted her arms behind her back and bundled her into the van. “Before leaving Krasnodar, the Germans set fire to the houses. With our own eyes we saw them set fire to the State Bank, the tobacco warehouse, and other buildings. After the explosion in the premises of the Gestapo, I went into the cellar. The first thing I saw was a dead body with the arms cut off. All around were lying charred bodies and numerous petrol tins twisted by the flames. There were so many dead bodies there that I could not count them. There were dead bodies not only in the cellar. In the spring we were given a vegetable plot near the premises where the Sonderkommando — those fellows over there [pointing to the. prisoners in the dock] — had their living quarters. When we began digging the plot we found several bodies of Soviet people who had been tortured to death.” The court then adjourned. Afternoon Session, 16th July $ The afternoon session was devoted to hearing the evidence of the Committee of Experts consisting of V. I. Prozorovsky, Chief Medico- Legal Expert of the People’s Commissariat for Public Health of the U.S.S.R., and Director of the State Medical Jurisprudence Research Institute; V. M. Smolyaninov, Chief Medico-Legal Expert of the People’s Commissariat for Public Health of the R.S.F.S.R., and Professor of Forensic Medicine at the Second Moscow Medical Institute ; Dr. P. S. Semenovsky, Consulting Physician of the Moscow City Court Medical Experts’ Department, and Court Chemist S. M. Sokolov. The Committee’s report was read by Dr. V. I. Prozorovsky, who stated that the exhumation and examination of the bodies of the victims of the German fascist invaders had established the following : “The corpses were lying in the pits in such a way as to form a jumbled tangle of human bodies. Some of the bodies lay in a hori- 32 THE PEOPLE’S VERDICT zontal position with their arms and legs stretched out, some face upwards and some face downwards. Some of the bodies were lying in a half-bent position ; others were in a sitting position and some even in an upright position. The arms, legs and heads of the bodies were so interlaced that in attempting to raise individual bodies from the pit, several were pulled out together. This proves that the bodies were not properly buried, but thrown into the pit haphazard, and just covered with earth. “As a rule the bodies — of men, women and children (including infants at the breast) were bereft of clothing and footwear. In those cases where bodies were clothed, the clothing — underwear or top cloth- ing— was mere rags. In some of the pits bodies were found with wooden crutches near them, and household utensils (such as market baskets, bottles, and so forth). “From 1st March to 26th June, 1943, the Committee exhumed and examined in all 623 bodies. “The medical, chemical and spectroscopic investigations established beyond doubt that in 523 cases the cause of death was poisoning by carbon monoxide; in 100 cases, death was due to wounds inflicted in the head and chest by firearms.” At the request of the State Prosecutor the court appended to the documents in the case the affidavit of the Krasnodar City Extra- ordinary State Commission for investigating atrocities committed by the German fascist invaders and their accomplices. The President declared the court investigation at an end and invited Justiciary Major General L. /. Yachenin to deliver the speech for the prosecution. Speech for the Prosecution The State Prosecutor said : “It is with feelings of profound grief for the innocent blood shed by thousands of martyred Soviet people, with feelings of unquenchable hatred of the German invaders for their brutalities and violence, and the sorrow and suffering they have caused our people, that I commence my speech for the prosecution. “Comrades judges, during the few days that this trial has proceeded we have followed the tracks of a wild beast. Before us yawned the dark depths of anti-tank trenches which the German fascist fiends converted into gigantic graves for over seven thousand peaceful Soviet citizens, women, children and the aged. The groans and death rattle of our brothers, sisters and children who were tortured, asphyxiated, or shot still ring in our ears. Dead bodies of Soviet citizens shot by the Germans Dr. P. S. Semenovsky, a member of the Committee of Experts, examining the body of a child which had been brutally murdered by the German fascist invaders. KRASNODAR TRIAL 33 “For six months these swarms of brown locusts devoured and devastated the bounteous Krasnodar Territory. Reeling back under the blows of our Red Army, they left a trail of blood and tears, heaps of corpses, fire, and an abyss of hopeless misery. “The Krasnodar Territory does not stand alone in this respect. Wherever the foot of the fascist beast has trod the gloom of night prevails. Life has died out. Hundreds and thousands of innocent people have been thrown into yawning graves. “Such is the nature of fascism; such is its savage programme in action. “Hitler, that vile chief of the fascist gangsters, boasted of these bloodthirsty plans with diabolic candour even before the war; and it is by his direct orders that his henchmen kill, strangle, rob and hang. “For years Hitler and his clique imbued the German people with the ethics of the jungle and eradicated from their hearts and minds every trace of conscience and honour. “Characterizing the Hitlerites in the speech he delivered on 6th November, 1941, Comrade Stalin quoted the following passages from statements made by Hitler and Goring : ‘Kill everyone who is opposed to us.’ ‘Kill, kill! It is not you that will be held responsible, but I! Therefore, kill!’ This is what Goring said. And Hitler said : ‘I emancipate man from the humiliating chimera which is called conscience. Conscience, like education, mutilates man. My advan- tage is that I am not deterred by any considerations theoretical or moral.’ “This war will end with our victory; the buildings wrecked in Krasnodar and other cities will be restored. Our gardens and orchards will flourish again, and will ring again with the laughter of our children. The wounds which the fascist hordes have inflicted on our land will heal. But the memory of the dark pits and anti-tank trenches in which they buried thousands of their human victims, of the charred walls of the Gestapo premises in the cellar of which three hundred Soviet patriots met their death in flames, and of those thousands who were asphyxiated, shot, tortured, and outraged will for ever haunt us like a frightful shadow and call for implacable vengeance and retribution. “The enemy is still trampling upon our soil ; he is still perpetrating his deeds of violence against our Soviet people in the occupied regions. At this very moment, while I am speaking, somewhere in the districts occupied by these German fascist barbarians the engines of ‘murder vans’ are droning as they convey new victims to the graves which have been dug for them. “The entire responsibility for the atrocities and crimes committed during the German occupation of the city of Krasnodar and the c 34 THE PEOPLE’S VERDICT Krasnodar Territory, responsibility for the torture and outrage, for the wholesale shooting, burning and fiendish extermination with poison gases, for the burning and hanging of innocent Soviet people — the aged, women and children — rests upon the chiefs of the predatory fascist government of Germany and on the German High Command. “Responsibility for these frightful crimes rests upon Colonel General Ruoff, Commander of the German 17th Army. Full respons- ibility for them rests upon the Butcher of Krasnodar, Colonel Chris t- mann, Chief of the Gestapo, and upon his henchmen, the officers of the Gestapo, Captain Rabbe , Salge , Paschert , Sargo, Winz , Hahn , Munster, Erich Meier , the so-called surgeon Herz, and members of the staff of the Gestapo, Jakob Eicks and ScherterlanP Proceeding to deal with the circumstances of the case, the State Prosecutor emphasized the vile and treasonable activities of The traitors Tishchenko , Rechkalov , Naptsok, Miscui and the other defendants in this case. He reminded the court of the frightful details it had heard of the torture and wholesale slaughter of innocent people practised by the Gestapo in Krasnodar, in which the traitors, now in the prisoners’ dock, had taken an active part. He dealt particularly with the exceptionally brutal torture inflicted upon his victims by Colonel Christmann, the Chief of the Gestapo. Everybody in the Gestapo knew that if a prisoner was taken to be interrogated by the chief, he or she would not come back alive. The State Prosecutor also pointed to the fact that the Gestapo in Krasnodar, and the so-called Sonderkommando , made regular visits to the stanitsas and farms in the Krasnodar Territory for the purpose of exterminating Soviet citizens. These punitive expeditions cost our Russian people a great deal of blood. Sixteen Soviet patriots hanged in the stanitsa of Krimskaya ; an innocent girl hanged at the Kurundupe Farm, wholesale assault, arrest and shooting in the district of Temny Gastagai, wholesale robbery of the population — these are only a few of the milestones on the road of blood traversed by the Gestapo in the Krasnodar Territory. In these punitive expedi- tions the defendants Pushkarev, Rechkalov , Kotomtsev, Naptsok and Pavlov had taken an active part. The State Prosecutor reminded the court of the details it had heard of the torture and outrage to which the Gestapo had subjected its victims even before the doors of the “murder van” were openedfor them. Fresh captives poured into the cellars of the Gestapo in an endless stream. Here languished people of 70, young girls, and little children captured together with their mothers. The fiends of the Gestapo massacred the Soviet population wholesale with savage ferocity and typical German thoroughness. These wild beasts who claim to be KRASNODAR TRIAL 35 the bearers of technical progress invented special machines — the “murder vans” — for the purpose of putting people to death wholesale. They invented a conveyor system of death. According to incomplete figures based on the evidence of witnesses, no less than 6,930 people were hauled out of the cellars of the Gestapo and put to death in the “murder vans.” The State Prosecutor then dealt with the extermination of Soviet people from the hospitals and medical institutions in the Krasnodar Territory, which the fascist fiends had converted into man-traps. He recounted the circumstances of the slaughter in “murder vans” of over 300 patients from the Krasnodar Municipal Hospital, 320 patients from the Berezansk Medical Colony — and of another 17 from this colony who were killed subsequently — and of the 60 con- valescents who were taken to an anti-tank trench and there shot by the German fascist butchers. He then proceeded to deal with the massacre of the forty-two sick children lying at the Krasnodar Children’s Hospital in Tretya Rechka Kochety Farm. “Here, being restored to fife and health and surrounded by the care and solicitude of the Soviet authorities were forty-two sick children,” he said. “But the ‘murder van’ found its way even here. On 21st September, the German officer Herz arrived. Several days previous to that Erich Meier and Jacob Eicks had taken up their quarters there. These Gestapo officers, with their own hands, loaded all the children into the ‘murder van’ and took them away from the hospital. A few days before that Meier and Eicks had compelled the people living in the neighbourhood to dig a pit, ostensibly for an anti- aircraft gun, and when these preparations were completed these baby- killers set to work to murder these children in cold blood! The loading of the children into the van was accompanied by tragic scenes. These half-naked children struggled, prayed for assistance and pro- tection ; their little hands clutched at the nurses and doctors. Some of them were unconscious with fright. “When the fascist fiends were driven out of Krasnodar Territory, representatives of the public dug up the places where these unfor- tunate children had been buried, and their gaze encountered a shapeless mass of little dead bodies mixed up with shorts and singlets bearing the stamp of the Children’s Hospital. Some of these articles of under- clothing have figured in the case as exhibits.” The State Prosecutor reminded the court that the Committee of Experts which had exhumed and examined 623 of the bodies found in these pits and anti-tank trenches in Krasnodar, in the Berezansk Colony, and near Tretya Rechka Kochety Farm, had established that 36 THE PEOPLE’S VERDICT in 523 cases death was due to poisoning by carbon monoxide, and in 100 cases it was due to mortal wounds inflicted by firearms. The State Prosecutor then referred to the tricks the German fascist butchers had resorted to in order to discover Soviet citizens who had been active in public life and to put them to death. “They resorted to a trick of this kind just before they left Kras- nodar,” he said. “One of their rearguard units, consisting of men who spoke Russian, put on Red Army uniforms and went from house to house calling upon the young people to arm and go in pursuit of the retreating enemy. Some of the more credulous of the young Kras- nodar patriots allowed themselves to be deceived and paid for this with their lives. Cases of this kind could be quoted without end, but this would be superfluous as the brutal features of the bloodthirsty fascist monsters stand out clearly enough as it is. “The German barbarians marked the last days of their presence in Krasnodar by a crime of the most heinous kind. At dawn, on 10th February, the sky was aglow with the flames of the burning premises of the Gestapo in which the Germans had placed numerous tins of petrol and incendiary bombs and deliberately set fire to them. While the building was burning a strong cordon of police kept guard to prevent the unfortunate prisoners in the basement from escaping. Over 300 perished in the flames. Only one Red Armyman, his body scorched and mutilated, managed to escape from this inferno, and before dying he told the witnesses Gazhik, Dubrova and Rozhkova about the last horrible moments suffered by the prisoners of the Krasnodar Gestapo. “A monstrous tidal wave of blood swept through the towns and villages of Krasnodar Territory, driving tens of thousands of human beings into their graves ; but it did not for a moment break the spirit of the Soviet people or shake their confidence in ultimate victory. When death was already leering in the face of the sailor of the Red Navy in the market place of Krasnodar, with the noose over his neck, he kicked aside the traitor standing near him and shouted to the weep- ing women : ‘Don’t weep. These butchers will answer for this with thousands of their lives. Our men will be here soon and avenge us!’ And at the Berezansk Medical Colony, Marusya, battered and bleeding, hurled in the face of her executioners as she was about to die : ‘Our men will come and avenge us!’ “The years will pass. In the finest square in regenerated Krasnodar a monument will rear its head in proud memory of that heroic sailor, and of all those nameless patriots who gave their lives for their Soviet Motherland and for their great people. “But now let us bow our heads before the ashes of our martyred KRASNODAR TRIAL 37 brothers and mothers, children and sisters, and vow to exact implacable retribution for their sufferings, for their blood, for their terrible fate. “Let us vow to carry out Comrade Stalin’s behest : “ *. . . to liberate from the yoke of the German invaders the people of our villages and towns who were free and lived like human beings before the war, but are now oppressed and suffering from rapine, ruination and famine ... to liberate our women from the outrage and violence to which they are subjected by the German fascist monsters. . . .’ ‘To take ruthless vengeance on the German invaders for the blood and tears of our wives and children, our mothers and fathers, our brothers and sisters.’ “The ruthless vengeance which our teacher and leader calls for will come ; it will inevitably strike the fascist savages who devastated Krasnodar Territory, the murderers of thousands of its peaceful inhabitants. It will strike their vile accomplices who are now standing before the present Military Tribunal!” The State Prosecutor then proceeded to weigh the individual guilt of each of the defendants, and after analysing the evidence demanded that sentence of death be passed on Pushkarev, Miscrn, Naptsok , Kotomtsev , Kladov , Rechkalov , Tishchenko and Lastovina for com- mitting crimes covered by Arts. 58-1 a and 58-1 b of the Criminal Code of the R.S.F.S.R. As regards Paramonov , Tuchkov and Pavlov , the State Prosecutor waived the demand for capital punishment on the grounds that their crimes had been less heinous than those of the other defendants. In conclusion the State Prosecutor said : “To-day Soviet law will mete out justice to the traitors, fascist hirelings and boot-lickers now in the prisoners’ dock. To-morrow the court of history, the court of the freedom-loving nations of the world, will pronounce its inexorable verdict on the bloodthirsty rulers of Hitlerite Germany and all its associates, on the enemies of mankind who have plunged the world into the welter of the present war. Not one of them will escape stem retribution! Blood for blood, death for death!” Jfc 4c * >te ♦ On the conclusion of the speech for the prosecution, the President called upon the Advocate S. K. Kaznacheyev, whom the court had appointed to defend Tishchenko, Paramonov and Lastovina. “First of all,” said counsel in opening his speech, “I would like to 38 THE PEOPLE’S VERDICT express my regret that the chief organizers and inspirers of these fiendish crimes are not in the prisoners’ dock to-day. The principal defendants in this case are Hitler and his criminal gang of generals and officers of the German army, in whose hands the persons now in the prisoners’ dock were only tools, executing their fiendish instructions and orders. Mankind was aware of the savage nature of fascism even before the war, but it saw this in all its repulsiveness and horror during the war.” Counsel went on to admit that his clients Tishchenko, Paramonov and Lastovina had committed heinous crimes, but he appealed to the court, when deciding their fate, to take into account their frank con- fession of guilt, and the fact that they were merely tools, executing the criminal will of the German fascist butchers. Advocate V. I. Yakunenko, whom the court had appointed to defend Pushkarev, Tuchkov, Kotomtsev and Kladov, rose to speak in defence of his clients. He appealed to the court to spare the life of the accused Tuchkov. On behalf of Pushkarev, he appealed to the court to take into account the fact that when Krasnodar was liberated from the German fascist invaders he voluntarily gave himself up to the Soviet authorities and made a full and frank confession of the crimes he had committed. Counsel made a similar appeal on behalf of the accused Kotomtsev and Kladov. In conclusion he said : “The main burden of responsibility for these crimes rests upon those who, like their accomplices, will not escape the hand of justice. Not the Gruppenfilhrers of the type of my client Pushkarev, but the Fiihrer who is the chief organizer of these innumerable crimes and massacres — Adolf Hitler and his gang — must be put in the prisoners’ dock to face their stern but just judges.” The court then adjourned until next morning. Morning Session, 17th July The proceedings at the morning session of 17th July were opened by the speech of the Advocate A. I. Nazarevsky, whom the court had appointed to defend Pavlov, Rechkalov and Misan. Referring to the horrors of the six months’ occupation of Krasnodar and the Krasnodar Territory by the German fascist invaders, counsel appealed to the court to bear in mind that the chief culprits in all these fiendish crimes and atrocities should bear the main responsibility for all that they have committed. Continuing, he said : “The fate of the accused Pavlov is a glaring illustration of the KRASNODAR TRIAL 39 consequences to which loss of courage, and the sense of duty to one’s country, lead. This was the original cause of Pavlov’s fall. He was caught in the blood-stained net of the Gestapo. He lost his sense of duty and his courage, and became a traitor. “As for the accused Rechkalov, he was dragged down by his criminal past ; but in the evidence he gave before the court he proved that he fully appreciated how low he had fallen, and if his life is now spared he will not hesitate to sacrifice it in order to expiate the crime he has committed against his country. “Misan, too, has sincerely confessed his guilt and realizes how heinous are the crimes he has committed.” On these grounds counsel appealed to the court to spare the lives of his clients. At the opening of the court proceedings the accused Naptsok had declined the services of counsel. The President, therefore, now invited him to speak in his own defence. Naptsok, however, declined this invitation too. The President then invited the accused to make their last statements. One after another, all the accused again fully confessed their guilt, but pleaded that the court should take into consideration the fact that they had been merely the instruments of the criminal will of the German fascists, and that they had been driven by fear to take up service with them. They begged the court to spare their lives and give them the opportunity to expiate the crimes they had committed against their country and against the Soviet people. The court then adjourned to consider its verdict. Afternoon Session, 17th July The court reassembled in the afternoon of 17th July, when the President pronounced the following verdict. VERDICT In the Name of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics On 14th to 17th July, 1943, the Military Tribunal of the North- Caucasian Front, consisting of the President, Justiciary Colonel N. Y. Mayorov , President of the Military Tribunal of the North-Caucasian Front, two members : Justiciary Colonel G. K. Zakharyants , Vice- President of the Military Tribunal of the same front, and Justice 40 THE PEOPLE’S VERDICT Major N. N.

The materials of the preliminary and court investigation of the Military Tribunal of the North-Caucasian Front established the following : On 9th August, 1942, the German fascist troops temporarily cap- The Accused ##,4l Soviet citizens demanding stern retribution KRASNODAR TRIAL 41 tured the city of Krasnodar and Krasnodar Territory and on the direct instructions of the Hitler government and by order of Colonel General RuofF, Commander of the German 17th Army, and with the most active participation of the Gestapo — the German Secret Police — operat- ing under the direction of Colonel Christmann, Chief of the Gestapo, his second in command, Captain Rabbe, and officers of the Gestapo : Paschen, Boss, Sargo, Salge, Hahn, Winz, Erich Meier and Hans Munster, Herz and Schuster, the surgeons of the prison and the Gestapo, and the Gestapo interpreters Jakob Eicks and Scherterlan, jointly with their accomplices — traitors to our Socialist Motherland — V. Tishchenko, I. Rechkalov, G. Misan, M. Lastovina, N. Pushkarev, G. Tuchkov, I. Paramonov, Y. Naptsok, I. Kotomtsev, V. Pavlov and I. Kladov, for over six months engaged in the extermination of peaceful inhabitants of the city of Krasnodar and of the Krasnodar Territory by diverse brutal methods. The Hitlerite monsters and their aforementioned accomplices shot, hanged, asphyxiated with carbon monoxide gases and tortured to death many thousands of innocent Soviet citizens, including women, the aged and little children. The German invaders and their accomplices set fire to industrial plants, public buildings and the homes of the civilian population of the city of Krasnodar and plundered and destroyed the property of state, business, cultural and public organizations in the city of Kras- nodar and in the Krasnodar Territory. They robbed the inhabitants of all their food stocks and other property, and transported a large number of Soviet citizens to Germany there to toil as slaves. In February, 1943, after the invaders were driven from the Krasnodar Territory by the Red Army, all the aforementioned fiendish crimes were fully brought to light by the Soviet authorities. The court investigation also established that the Hitlerites engaged in the systematic torture and burning to death of many Soviet citizens who had been arrested by the Gestapo and had been confined in the cellar of the Gestapo premises, and that they deliberately exterminated by poisoning with carbon monoxide gases in especially equipped motor vehicles known as “murder vans” about seven thousand innocent Soviet citizens, including over seven hundred sick persons who were receiving treatment in medical institutions in the city of Krasnodar and in the Krasnodar Territory, of whom forty-two were children between the ages of 5 and 16. Having heard the explanations of the defendants, the evidence of witnesses, the report of the Committee of Experts and also the pleas of the State Prosecution and the defence, the Military Tribunal has established the guilt of each of the defendants as follows : 1. Tishchenko, in August, 1942, voluntarily joined the German 42 THE PEOPLE’S VERDICT Police Force. In September, 1942, he was, by way of encouragement, promoted, first to the rank of Sergeant-major in the punitive body of the Gestapo known as the Sonderkommando aS-S-IO-#, and then to the post of investigator of the Gestapo, while at the same time serving as a secret agent of the latter. Holding the aforementioned posts in the service of the German invaders, Tishchenko, together with Boss and other officers of the Gestapo, often made excursions to round up guerrillas, Communists, and other Soviet citizens who were active in public life. Under the direction of the Gestapo officers Sargo and Salge, he acted as investi- gator in the cases of these citizens and flogged them in the process, and was responsible for the asphyxiation of several Soviet citizens in his custody by means of carbon monoxide in specially equipped vehicles known as “murder vans.” 2. Pushkarev, in August, 1942, voluntarily joined the Hitler Police Force and was shortly afterwards promoted to the rank of Gruppen- fiihrer , i.e., Platoon Commander, in the aforementioned Sonder- kommando. Pushkarev, jointly with the Hitlerite officers Stein, Herz, Hahn and others, and under the command of Colonel Christmann, Chief of the Gestapo, repeatedly visited the stanitsas of Gladkovskaya and Krasny Psebebs, the town of Anapa and other places, for provocative and punitive purposes, and there participated in the search for, arrest and shooting of guerrillas and other Soviet citizens active in public life. As chief of the guard of the Gestapo, Pushkarev stood guard over Soviet citizens, took part in torturing and assaulting them, and was present when they were loaded in the “murder vans” in which the German fascist butchers put people to death by poisoning them with carbon monoxide. In the beginning of February, 1943, before the Germans were driven from the city of Krasnodar, he helped the Gestapo officials to set fire to and blow up the premises of the Gestapo where arrested Soviet citizens were confined, as a result of which the latter perished. 3. Rechkalov, in August, 1942, having been released before the expiration of his term from the prison where he was undergoing sen- tence for larceny and evading service in the Red Army, deserted to the German fascist invaders and voluntarily joined the German Police Force, in which, as a reward for zealous service, he was soon transferred to the Sonderkommando SS-\\0-a of the Gestapo, where he regularly served as a sentry, guarding arrested Soviet citizens, and saw the way they were tortured. 4. Misan repeatedly helped to load arrested Soviet citizens in KRASNODAR TRIAL 43 the “murder vans” in which the Gestapo officials put them to death by means of carbon monoxide. Misan volunteered to shoot citizen Gubsky, who was carrying on anti-fascist activities. Misan shot Gubsky, thereby winning the confidence of the German invaders, and was afterwards appointed a secret agent of the Gestapo. 5. Kotomtsev, in September, 1942, voluntarily joined the German Police Force at the war prisoners’ camp, and in November, 1942, voluntarily joined the Sonderkommando SS-10-a, in the ranks of which he actively assisted the Gestapo to exterminate Soviet citizens, « and participated in punitive expeditions against partisans. In January, 1943, Kotomtsev, with a punitive unit, took part in rounding up and arresting guerrillas at Kurundupe Farm and the stanitsa of Krymskaya. At Kurundupe Farm he actively assisted in hanging a girl for being in communication with the guerrillas ; and at the stanitsa of Krymskaya he took part in hanging sixteen Soviet citizens. 6. Naptsok voluntarily joined the Sonderkommando SS-10-a of the Gestapo, where he regularly stood guard over the Soviet citizens who were confined in the dungeons of the Gestapo. On many occa- sions he went out with punitive expeditions to round up and exter- minate guerrillas and other Soviet citizens. In January, this year, he actively participated in the hanging of several Soviet citizens in the stanitsa of Gastogaevskaya, and at Kurundupe Farm. 7. Kladov, in September, 1942, during the temporary occupation of the city of Krasnodar by the Germans, voluntarily joined the Sonderkommando SS-10-a of the Gestapo, where he stood guard over arrested people and at the same time acted as secret agent in searching for guerrillas and other persons who were assisting the Red Army. 8. Lastovina, fleeing from justice as a kulak, arrived in the city of Krasnodar in 1932 and obtained a situation as a male nurse in a hospital. In December, 1942, while the German fascist invaders were in temporary occupation of the city of Krasnodar, he helped the officials of the Gestapo to shoot sixty sick Soviet citizens. 9. Tuchkov, during the temporary occupation of the city of Kras- nodar by the German invaders, voluntarily joined the German Police Force and then transferred to the Sonderkommando SS-10-a, in the ranks of which he, on three occasions, took part in rounding up and arresting persons who were in sympathy with the Soviet regime. 10 and 11. Paramonov and Pavlov voluntarily joined the Sonder- kommando SS-\\Q-a of the Gestapo and remained in the ranks until the fascists were driven from the city of Krasnodar, standing guard 44 THE PEOPLE’S VERDICT over the persons arrested and confined at the premises of the Gestapo, and taking part in the rounding up and arrest of guerrillas. Thus, the guilt of all the aforementioned accused of the crime of treason to the country is proved by their own confessions and the evidence of witnesses. In conformity with Articles 319-320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the R.S.F.S.R., and guided by the Ukase of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R., of 19th April, 1943, concerning traitors to the country, the Military Tribunal SENTENCES : Tishchenko, Vassily Petrovich; Rechkalov, Ivan Anisimovich; Lastovina, Mikhail Pavlovich; Pushkarev, Nikolai Semenovich; Misan, Grigory Nikitovich; Naptsok, Yunus Mitsukhovich; Kotom- tsev, Ivan Fedorovich and Kladov, Ignaty Fedorovich — to death by hanging. Tuchkov, Grigory Petrovich; Pavlov, Vassily Stepanovich and Paramonov, Ivan Ivanovich — being the least active of the accomplices convicted of assisting the German fascist criminals in their fiendish treatment of the Soviet civilian population and Red Army prisoners of war — to exile and penal servitude for the term of twenty years each. This verdict is final and not subject to appeal. Signed : Justiciary Colonel N. Mayorov, President. Justiciary Colonel G. Zakharyants, Justiciary Major N. Kostrov, Members of the Tribunal .
