        "text": "Kadyrov Ahmed\n\nAhmed (Akhmat since 1999. Changed his name during the occupation Russian troops CRI) Abdulkhamidovich Kadyrov (August 23, 1951, Karaganda - May 9, 2004, Grozny).\n\nBorn in the city of Karaganda, Kazakh SSR.\n\nIn April 1957, the Kadyrov family returned to the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, to the village of Tsentoroy, Shalinsky District.\n\nIn 1968 he graduated from the Bachiyurt high school. In the same year, he studied at the courses of a combine driver in the village of Kalinovskaya, Naursky district.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1971 he worked at the Novogroznensky rice-growing state farm in the Gudermes region.\n\nIn 1971 he left the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic to work, worked in construction organizations in the Non-Black Earth Region and Siberia until 1980.\n\nIn 1980, in the direction of the Gudermes Cathedral Mosque, 29-year-old Akhmat went to the Uzbek SSR, where he entered the Mir-Arab Madrasah of Bukhara.\n\nZelimkhan Yandarbiev stated: “Since 1981, when it was forbidden to pray in Chechnya, Kadyrov has been cooperating with the KGB! We found out about this in 1996, when the Shamilov brigade seized Grozny and the KGB archive, but it was not immediately dealt with. Although even then I felt: it was not without reason that he raised talk about the harm of the Wahhabis. I then scolded him and warned him.”\n\nIn 1982 he left for Tashkent, where he entered the Tashkent Islamic Institute. I studied there from 1982 to 1986.\n\nAfter the Islamic Institute, he returned to Gudermes, where he became the deputy imam of the Gudermes mosque. He worked as a deputy imam until 1988.\n\nIn 1993 he was appointed Deputy Mufti of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria.\n\nAt the same time, he took part (with calls to kill Russians) in military operations against federal troops, or rather, declared Jihad on Russia and openly speaking at rallies called on Chechens to kill Russians. \"If every Chechen kills 150 Russians, we will win this war,\" said Kadyrov. Later, he himself denied these statements, but this time he was even more dispersed: \"I did not talk about 150 Russians. I said: kill as many as you can. Without restrictions\"\n\nWith the outbreak of the Second Russian-Chechen War (started by Russia in 1999), he played a key role in the transfer of some settlements of the CRI under the control of federal forces.\n\nOn October 10, 1999, by decree of the President of the CRI, Aslan Maskhadov, Akhmat Kadyrov was removed from the post of mufti in connection with the betrayal of faith and the people.\n\nHe was killed on May 9, 2004 at the Dynamo stadium in the city of Grozny. Some sources report that the murder was committed by Russian special services.\n\nIt is important to note one detail. The Kadyrov family did not deny the fact that they were not Chechens. Such rumors have been circulating among the Chechens for a long time, later this information was confirmed by Kadyrov himself.\n\nIt's no secret that as a Cossack defector, Ramzan Kadyrov went from rags to riches. I want to tell you, dear readers, that the Kadyrov family is Cossack, they started talking about this when Akhmad Kadyrov was elected mufti in Chechen Republic Ichkeria, in the autumn of 1996 he became the head of the newly formed Muftiate of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, however, after the election of Akhmad Kadyrov as a mufti, many of the nearby settlements (Bachi-Yurt, Mayrtup, Alleroy, as well as residents of Khosi-Yurt) Chechens (old people) were outraged, that they chose Akhmad Kadyrov as the mufti of the son of Abdulkhamid Kadyrov, knowing the fact that their family is Cossack.\n\nUmar: My grandfather Adlan from the village of Bachi-Yurt told me that the late Abdulkhamid Kadyrov also did not deny that their family was Cossack, Adlan and Abdulkhamid knew each other even before they were deported to Kazakhstan in 1944.\n\nUnlike others, today many elders remember the history of some integrated Cossacks among the Chechens, today there are not many old people left alive who remember the history of the Chechen types by inheritance from their great-great-grandfathers and remember such a clan as the Don-Cossack clan of Kadyrov, a clan that merged and integrated into one of the Chechen teips.\n\nThe late Cossack Akhmad Kadyrov did not deny that he was a Cossack, Akhmad Kadyrov confirmed at the forum held on March 27, 2004, in which the terrorist Putin participated in the work of the united forum of the peoples of the Caucasus, the forum took place in the boarding house \"Rus\". From the published material on kommersant.ru, in which Kadyrov confirms that he and his family are Cossacks:\n\n“The adviser to the president of Chechnya, Ataman Pogrebnoy, stood out with growth and a uniform sparkling in the sun. He told those who wished that the ancestors of Akhmad Kadyrov were Cossacks.\n\nSo he is a Cossack, not a Chechen? - asked the ataman.\n\n- Of course, Cossack! - He joyfully answered. - His teip (.....) (Note that Kadyrov's clan is not related to the Chechen teip \"benoy\") where did it come from? They are the youngest Muslims in the world! They ate the last cauldron of pork and accepted the Muslim faith.\n\nHere Pavel Fedotov, ataman, approached Grigory Pogrebny Stavropol Territory. Atamans embraced. And suddenly the adviser to the president of Chechnya literally turned pale before his eyes:\n\n- And you, Pavel, how did you get here?\n\nThe Stavropol chieftain did not understand:\n\nSo I'm a participant!\n\nYes, how did you carry the dagger? They took mine from me. It rang when I passed through the frame.\n\nIndeed, a dagger in a sheath hung on the belt of Ataman Fedotov. Ataman seems to be well prepared for the meeting with the President of the country.\n\nRussian presidential aide Ramazan Abdulatipov approached. He was appointed to this position two months ago and the other day it was confirmed that nothing will change in his life with the reforms in the presidential administration. It was rather strange to hear this. Assistants to the president had already been appointed the day before. As a result, the status of an assistant has grown, in theory, to unprecedented proportions. Does Ramazan Abdulatipov fit these dimensions? Question. But it doesn't seem to be for him.\n\nAnd how do you work with President Kadyrov? Did everything go well with him? Before the elections, the list of your claims to him commanded respect.\n\n- We are working, - Mr. Abdulatipov sighed. - We have to work. Civil service...\n\nHe probably wanted to add \"be it wrong,\" but, as a civil servant, of course, restrained himself.\n\nHere Akhmat Kadyrov approached Ataman Pogrebny. At the request of the photographers, they hugged each other tightly twice.\n\n- So you are a Cossack? I asked Mr. Kadyrov.\n\n- Cossack! - He readily agreed. - And why?\n\n- Ataman just told about it.\n\n“Your ancestors, Akhmat-Hadji, are from the Cossacks,” Ataman Pogrebnoy said hastily.\n\n- Well, yes, - Mr. Kadyrov confirmed glumly. - I am a Cossack. It's not visible, is it?\n\nOn the path leading to the entrance to the boarding house, the new presidential envoy for the Southern Federal District, Vladimir Yakovlev, appeared. He smiled his famous, now a little embarrassed smile. The night before, Mr. Yakovlev, like ten days ago, was appointed to the post of plenipotentiary for the Southern Federal District. On this I congratulated him.\n\n- Thanks! said Mr. Yakovlev cordially.\n\nHow are you in your new position?\n\n- Very good! - he confirmed my worst assumptions. - You see, life in the Caucasus is unusually interesting! Yesterday, after the meeting, we all watched an amateur concert together. How beautiful! The dances are so... I have never seen such! If our whole life is as beautiful and cheerful as these dances on the stage, everything will be just wonderful!\n\n- But she will not be like on stage.\n\n- Will not? - he was upset. - Well, yes, probably. But we must at least strive for it.\n\nThe same fact is confirmed by many elders of the Kurchaloy district. However, today everyone is silent because of the current situation, the fear of the Kremlin's dictatorial regime in the occupied Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, as Umar said, is everyone is afraid of the massacre of the junior Don Cossack Ramzan Kadyrov.\n\nIt can be seen that this is why the Cossack Kadyrov Ramzan has no pity for the true sons of the Chechen people, who are fighting for the freedom and independence of the Chechen people from the invaders of the Russian Federation, Putin knowingly put a vabank on the Kadyrov family, while making a differentiated approach to the Chechen people. - Umar.\n\nKnown for his disrespect and attacks on the Chechen and other peoples.\n\n\"I see that the Chechens became speakers, but remained stupid. We only lacked Kazakhs, Uzbeks and Tajiks to feed them in Chechnya,\" Kadyrov summed up.\n\nLink Izvestia newspaper\n\nAfter the elimination of Akhmad Kadyrov, Aimani, Ramzan, daughters - Zargan and Zulai remained.\n\nRamzan Kadyrov\n\nRamzan Akhmatovich Kadyrov, born October 5, 1976, Tsentora-Yurt (Tsentoroy), Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, RSFSR, USSR.\n\nSon of Russian puppet Akhmat Kadyrov.\n\nHe graduated from six classes at school No. 1 in his native village of Tsentora-Yurt (Tsentaroy) of the Kurchaloevsky district.\n\nOfficially married to fellow villager Medni (b. 1980), whom he met at school. They have 2 sons - Akhmat (b. 2005, named after the deceased grandfather) and Adam, and 4 daughters - Aishat, Karina, Khedi and Tabarik.\n\nAccording to the text of an interview with Ramzan Kadyrov dated June 2004, published in Novaya Gazeta, he graduated from the branch of the Moscow Institute of Business in Gudermes, but because of his lack of knowledge of the Russian language, he found it difficult to name the topic of his diploma and the branch of law in which he specializes.\n\nWhat is your education? - Higher legal. I'm finishing. I pass exams. - What? - How is it - which ones? Exams, that's all. - What is the name of the institute you are graduating from? - A branch of the Moscow Institute of Business. in Gudermes. Legal, that is. - What is your specialization? - I am a lawyer. - A diploma in what law? Criminal? Civil? - I forgot. I wrote down the thread but forgot. There are a lot of events right now.\n\nAnna Politkovskaya. Center from Tsentoroy. Interview with Ramzan Kadyrov. Novaya Gazeta, 06/21/2004\n\nSince 2004 he has been enrolled as an academician public service under the President of the Russian Federation.\n\nSince then, people have called Kadyrov a lawyer or an academician.\n\nIn 2007 he was appointed the main puppet of Chechnya.\n\nOn April 27, 2010, the Austrian prosecutor's office stated that Kadyrov “ordered in 2009 to kidnap a Chechen in Vienna who made exposés; during the abduction, this man was mortally wounded.”\n\nAlso, in April of the same year, the Russian media published testimony to the investigation of Isa Yamadayev, in which he accused Ramzan Kadyrov of organizing an attempt on his life, as well as the murder of his brothers.\n\nAs Lev Ponomarev stated on behalf of some Russian human rights activists in February 2007, it is Kadyrov's special forces that are now the main culprit in the deaths of civilians and kidnappings in Chechnya (the militants, in his opinion, are less active). The head of the Moscow Helsinki Group, Lyudmila Alekseeva, said:\n\nI know that Kadyrov not only pursues a policy of kidnapping people who disappear without a trace, or who are later found dead with signs of torture, or are imprisoned on trumped-up charges, I know that he himself took part in both torture and murder.\n\nAccording to Human Rights Watch:\n\nAs part of the Russian policy of \"Chechenization\" of the conflict, an increasingly prominent role was assigned to the security forces of the Chechen Republic, controlled by Ramzan Kadyrov. In 2004-2005 they gradually took the place of the federal forces as the main actors in enforced disappearances. “Kadyrovtsy” have their own prisons, which are outside the jurisdiction of any relevant state structures, and where hundreds of people are detained, often subjected to ill-treatment. Republican law enforcement agencies are also responsible for the practice of forcing militant leaders to surrender by taking their relatives hostage. The Kremlin not only condones this practice, but actually encourages it.\n\nAccording to the International Federation of Human Rights in Helsinki, among the existing private prisons in Chechnya, at least two are located in Kadyrov's family village of Tsentoroy and are at his personal disposal. One of them consists of concrete bunkers or cells where the abducted relatives of militants (including the elderly, women and children) are kept in order to blackmail the latter. In particular, the father and wife of Dokka Umarov, and seven relatives of Aslan Maskhadov, who were released after his murder by Russian special forces, were held there.\n\nThe second prison is said to be located in the courtyard or in close proximity to Kadyrov's house. The third prison is supposedly located on the southeastern outskirts of the village, in the area, according to the residents, which is the base of the \"Kadyrovtsy\". It is also used to hold kidnapped militant family members.\n\nIn addition to the prisons in Tsentoroi, the report of the International Federation for Human Rights notes at least 10 illegal prisons created and controlled by formations directly subordinate to Kadyrov - the so-called \"Kadyrovites\". According to human rights activists, “one of the reasons for the existence of such a parallel system of detention is the obtaining of ‘confessions’ and ‘testimony’ through severe beatings and torture, after which it is the turn of the official detention and execution of the persons concerned. A large number of such criminal cases are fabricated.”\n\nAnna Politkovskaya described Kadyrov as a coward, armed to the teeth, “who is surrounded by guards.” Journalist Vadim Rechkalov also considers Kadyrov a coward. In addition, Rechkalov claims that the title of master of sports in boxing was awarded to Kadyrov without any sporting merit: “The athletes of the Southern federal district, including the peers of Ramzan - have not heard of the boxer Kadyrov. To get a master, you need to get to the Russian final or beat other masters. If Ramzan did it, the boxers would know\"\n\nAnna Politkovskaya: \"Why did you run like crazy on the football field after Terek's victory?\"\n\nRamzan Kadyrov: \"I didn't remember anything for joy. I swear.\"\n\nNovaya Gazeta, 06/21/2004\n\nVideo by the Kadyrovs (no comments).\n\nKadyrov's dance on money.\n\nThere are no surnames in Chechnya except for the Kadyrovs...\n\nKadyrov is trying to humiliate Abdul-Khalim Sadulaev.\n\nKadyrov is a traitor!\n\nKadyrov establishes the word of Allah in Chechnya?\n\nKadyrov in the bath.\n\nRamzan Kadyrov seems to be at the center of a scandal, just like Yury Skuratov once was. In 1999, a videotape of a naked former Russian Prosecutor General having fun in bed with two girls was shown on the state channel RTR, and Skuratov was forced to resign.\n\nNow one of the Chechen separatist websites, physically located in Canada, has circulated on the Internet a video of a man who looks like Chechen Prime Minister Ramzan Kadyrov. The people in the video are having fun in the sauna with the girls.\n\nAccording to the website Daymohk, the action took place in one of the saunas where Ramzan Kadyrov likes to bathe. The video, presumably filmed with a cell phone camera, shows two girls and several men. One of them really resembles the head of the government of Chechnya.\n\nIndeed, as NEWSru.com managed to find out, there is an extended version of this entry.\n\nPhotos of the Kadyrovs\n\nQuote: \"What, I have nothing to do, how to dance? After the death of my father, I don't dance at all.\" TVNZ\n\nThe inscription on the T-shirt \"2PSYCHO\", which means - Psycho.\n\nQuote:\n\nPoems of the Kadyrovs.\n\nI dedicate to Ramzan and the Kefirov family\n\nEveryone knows the ripe nit, the one that rules in the captive Chechnya.\n\nIt has long accumulated resentment, from infamy in a bloody war.\n\nIt is not for nothing that the doomed Kadyrov drove a sharpened wedge among the people.\n\nAnd he created an idol in his heart, forgetting that the Almighty is One.\n\nWhile the soldiers were fighting for freedom, the unscrupulous criminal Ramzan,\n\nIn order to increase incomes for families, he prepared zin-dan for slaves.\n\nAfter all, they tried for the Russians, and worked hard,\n\nFor the Russians to lament again, for their hearts to break.\n\nIn order for the ransom to be paid faster, everything needs to be filmed on camera.\n\nYes! Slaves bespredelschiki beat, otherwise how to tear off the ransom.\n\nIt is better for the Russians to ask Ramzan where the truth is here and where the slander is here.\n\nAnd then again they will think drunk that the negligent poet has lied.\n\nAnd probably for this the killer was finally awarded the cross,\n\nThey warmed the bloodsucker father, and put on a false crown.\n\nThey slandered the government, the soldiers. Doomed the people to torment,\n\nThey seated us with dignity, since you betrayed, you are entitled to income.\n\nWell, and those who fought without fear, who did not betray, did not get scared, did not pass.\n\nWho did not keep slaves, honored Allah, and who did not sell his conscience.\n\nThey have no place in Kadyrov's world, among forged Russian boots,\n\nWhere the innocent are pissed in the toilet, where the devil rules, not God.\n\nAddressing you like a boy, I'm trying to find words\n\nWhat has long been written down in books, it’s a pity you don’t like to read books.\n\nMaybe we'll play chess together, on the blood-drenched land,\n\nMaybe we’ll sing together, dream, not about what the Kremlin orders.\n\nMaybe we will remember the dead with dignity, for our native Chechnya, the brave,\n\nLet's sit and judge calmly, what is the fault of those unshaven youths,\n\nThat they believed the false slander of your grave father.\n\nIf their souls are warmed in paradise, where is the place for the scoundrel,\n\nThat he despised the ideals of freedom, that he put Chechnya under attack.\n\nFor the sake of personal self-interest, for the sake of the lawlessness, a fire was set on fire.\n\nYou sprinkled ashes on freedom, and Chechens and Russian soldiers,\n\nBut why do you swear by Allah, since it is not paradise that is dearer to you, but hell.\n\nHow many worthy and honest lives were destroyed by the bloody Ramzan.\n\nNot in battle, in local strife, stuffing a bottomless pocket.\n\nYour deal with the Russian office took place before the war.\n\nOr did your dad give up so soon, from what he did in his pants ???\n\nYou are a family of traitors, a tribe of outcasts, your elder brother is lazily limp from the dose.\n\nAnd your father, under the Russian heavy foot, will turn into a worn old dude.\n\nI dedicate to human meanness\n\nFreedom! cherished, hard word. Pain, coercion, longing are heard in it.\n\nA dream lives in him, one that will remove the shackles, make amends for the shame, and pass through the ages.\n\nThe desire of peoples, and the connection of generations, to dump alien power from their shoulders.\n\nBuild your own world, renouncing laziness, but not so valiantly fall for the homeland.\n\nYes! Many violent youths fell, succumbing to the temptation of Kadyrov's lies.\n\nThey did not defend Chechnya and the law, but sharpened knives in honor of lawlessness.\n\nKadyrov squealed: \"Every good Chechen must take revenge on the Russians for centuries of oppression.\"\n\nAnd the figure was appointed by a renegade mullah in order to become a mufti and a spiritual head.\n\nAppointed by Kadyrov for each war, fifty innocent heads.\n\nYes! Someone enthusiastically justified the massacre, not understanding the full value of treacherous words.\n\nNo one remembered that he had studied in a madrasah, as the KGB once claimed.\n\nSo that later Kadyrov carefully weighed everything, and with a “clean conscience” the people sold it.\n\nIn the Union, then it was the law to select people for the service of the Lord,\n\nSo that these campaigners do not become an obstacle, in the imperial game they annoy their people.\n\nThe agent of the KGB is an Orthodox patriarch, and the Mufti is a Chechen traitor doubly.\n\nTied together by an inglorious idea, not to believe in the Creator, but to serve Satan.\n\nChina, Transcaucasia, Arab countries, Europe, America, Oriental countries.\n\nNo one will tolerate such deceit. No one recognized the president as a serf.\n\nThey called him the butcher for the murders, he doesn't care about the people of the curse.\n\nBut so that his own people do not get him, like a whore, climbs into Russian arms.\n\nThings are not important in criminal Russia, at the cost of lawlessness strengthened power.\n\nThe people are frightened, and it is not strong enough for them to strive for struggle in order to fall again.\n\nThe world could not recognize the executioner as president, let alone Chechens not recognize the authorities.\n\nHe is covered by a Russian military contingent, and Putin will replace Kadyrov's mother.\n\nHis son is his junior executioner and traitor, inveterate murderer, human trafficker.\n\nCormorant is an unprincipled, cruel punisher, gives interviews through the Russian media.\n\nRamzan was awarded the Iron Cross, the desperate rogue swears by Allah,\n\nHe boasts of the cross before the guards, forgetting that his father is an imperial jester.\n\nI'll ask you Chechens, why do you need freedom, under the heel of Russian oppression?\n\nUnder the rule of a moral-criminal freak, not peace will come to you, but war will return.\n\nThe one who serves the traitor will repent, in his own soul, not finding the right.\n\nAnd again he will take up arms in his hands, he will take revenge on his enemies, and not again into the bushes.\n\nRetribution comes, it is one-faced. Behind her is only death, humiliation and fear.\n\nThe corrupt clique will crumble into ashes, and everyone will be struck by the lawlessness of scope.\n\nAt the cost of betrayal and crimes, Kadyrov climbed onto the desecrated throne.\n\nThe scoundrel forgot about the dream of generations, causing enormous damage to Chechnya.\n\nAlera. A rather numerous teip originating from Eastern Chechnya, but settled throughout the country. Aslan Alievich Maskhadov belongs to this teip. According to legend, the name of this teip was on the legendary bronze cauldron, which was brought by the ancestors to Nashkh.\n\nTogether with Alera, the teips of Bena, Sontora, Belgata, Nihala, Terla, Varanda, Peshkha, Guna and other so-called \"clean\" teips were indicated there. According to the Chechen legend, representatives of non-native, secondary teips melted this cauldron.\n\nBelgatoy. A large and well-known teip in Chechnya. Once it was a subdivision of the Beltoy teip. The legend about the origin of Belgatoi says that the Belgatoi people almost died out as a result of an epidemic that once happened, but then they multiplied again, as evidenced by the etymology of the name (\"bel\" - to die, \"gatto\" - to resurrect). They are considered very energetic people.\n\nBeltoy (Biltoy). Big and famous teip. From him came the famous politician Beibulat Taimiev, who was mentioned by A.S. Pushkin in the description of his journey to Erzerum. Now the Beltoi are settled everywhere, but their original region is located in the East of Chechnya (Nozhayyurtovsky district).\n\nBenoy. One of the most numerous Chechen teips, perhaps the largest of them. One of the most famous Chechen businessmen, Malik Saidullaev, himself a Benoite and doing a lot of business for his teip, claims that out of 1 million Chechens, Benoevs number 360,000. distributed throughout the republic. Benoevtsy are subdivided into 9 clans-gars: Jobi-nekye, Wonzhbi-nekye, Asti-nekye, Ati-nekye, Chupal-nekye, Ochi-nekye, Devshi-nekye, Edi-nekye and Gurzh-makhkahoy. took an active part in Caucasian war last century. From among them comes the national hero Baysangur Benoyevsky, who did not leave Shamil until his capture and did not surrender after Shamil surrendered to the tsarist troops.\n\nMany Benoites are in the diaspora in the countries of Western Asia. The Benoites are the heroes of many comic stories in which they make fun of the clumsy figure or the village cunning of the Benoevs. At the same time, they are known for their fearlessness, loyalty to the given word.\n\nApparently, the Benoyites formed the backbone of the democratic peasant strata, who several centuries ago threw off their own aristocratic institutions and the power of the Kabardian and Dagestan rulers in Chechnya. These strata gave rise to that same mountain democracy, which became social basis ethnic mentality of the Chechens.\n\nOn the example of Benoy, we will illustrate the appearance of a foreigner in a teip. In the original area of ​​the Benoevs on the Aksai River there is a tract called Gurzhiyn mokhk (Georgian place, possession). A. Suleymanov reports the following legend: \"During the raid on neighboring Georgia, the Benoev squad brought a Georgian boy. Growing up, the little prisoner gained great fame among his peers and adults for his strength, resourcefulness, dexterity, beauty. He became an equal member of society, they gave him a wife beautiful woman, allocated land and helped build a house, gave working oxen, a cow, a horse. Later, when the Georgian family grew, settlements stood out, a farm grew. Then the Benoevites called this place Gurzhiin mokhk \"(See: 2nd ed. Grozny, 1998. P. 317]).\n\nVaranda. One of the famous mountain teips. The author of the last century, the first Chechen ethnographer Umalat Laudaev claims that the varanda is of \"alien origin\". In Chechnya, I had to hear the statement that they are of \"Russian origin.\" Most likely, this only speaks of the acceptance by them of fugitive Russian soldiers of the era of the Caucasian War of the last century. The term varanda itself is known in historical documents of the 1st millennium. Another underlying reason for the judgment of \"Russian origin\" may be related to the fact that the Varandoi people did not accept the Muslim faith for a long time and went to the mountains in order to protect the ancient beliefs. Be that as it may, the Varandoy people still retain some ancient customs (such as female circumcision) and unique Chechen folklore.\n\nGendargenoy. Teip, to which Doku Gapurovich Zavgaev belongs. It is considered one of the most numerous teips and is therefore settled quite widely in Chechnya. Teip Gendargenoy came out of historical center Chechnya Nokhchiymokhka (Nokhchamakhk, \"Country of the Chechens\"). This \"Country of Chechens\", located in the basins of the Aksai, Michig and on the lands along the Terek, has always been the breadbasket not only of Chechnya, but also of Dagestan and even more. distant countries. Economic and military force determined the existence of the cultural-political and ritual-religious pre-Islamic center Nashkh in Nokhchimokhk. This center housed one of the early Mehk Khel (\"Council of the Country\"). From there, according to legend, all the \"clean\" teips of the Chechens came out. Among these teips is Gendargenoy.\n\nNokhchiymokhk actually coincides with the formation, which is known under the Turkic name of Ichkeria. This part of Chechnya was hardly occupied by the tsarist troops in 1852. Only this event began to be considered in the historiography of the last century as the beginning of the end of the Caucasian War. Obviously, the adoption by the government of D.M. Dudaev's name of Ichkeria as an official one should have meant both an introduction to the source of the Chechen ethnogenesis, and to the glorious page of the resistance of the last century.\n\nGendargenites in the history of Chechnya have always occupied a prominent place.\n\nIN Soviet years many leaders of the economic and party level came out of its members. In the \"peaceful\" 1991-1994. in Chechnya, one could hear complaints from the Gendargenoyites about the dominance of new, Dudayev, personnel, mainly of \"mountainous\" origin. Teip meetings that took place in those years by some persons from the government of D.M. Dudayev were interpreted as an attempt to find support among the masses from the old Soviet party nomenklatura.\n\nDeshni. Mountain Chechen teip, settled in the southeast of Chechnya. Refers to the well-known \"pure teips\" with their own mountain, the teip of Desni - Desni-lam. Some of Deshni live in Ingushetia. Deshni are known for the fact that by 1917 they had preserved surnames that were considered princely. In Chechnya, a story is told with humor how one of the representatives of such a family married a Georgian princess, passing off a teip mountain as his own.\n\nZurzakhoy. This teip is considered one of the original ones, because in its name it retained the ethnonym Dzurzuks, which in the Middle Ages the Georgians gave to the ancestors of the Chechens and Ingush. According to M. Mamakaev, the teip zurzakhoy was not included in the tukhums, occupying an independent position, as well as the teips Maystoy, Peshkhoy and Sadoy.\n\nZumsoy (Dzumsoy). Mountain Chechen teip, bearing either a totemic (\"zu\" - a hedgehog; in Chechen symbolism, it is the bearer of wisdom), or a professional name (zoom - a mountain cart). He has always been one of the politically active Chechen teips. The Zumsoevites suffered extremely from the Soviet regime.\n\nGuna. A well-known Chechen teip, settled in the northeast of Chechnya. The Gunoevtsy directly coexist with the Terek Cossacks, with whom they have family ties. It is believed that much later than other Chechen teips converted to Islam.\n\nKalhoy (Kaloi). Mountain Chechen teip, to which Zelimkhan Yandarbiev belongs. The surname Kaloev is known among the Ingush, as well as among the Ossetians.\n\nMulka. A small Chechen teip settled in the mountains (Shatoevsky district). Known for their resistance to Shamil's autocratic rule.\n\nNashkhoy. Nashkho is an area considered to be the birthplace of \"pure teips\". This is the ethnogenetic center of the medieval Nokhchimatiens, who, according to Armenian historical sources, inhabited the southeast of Chechnya. (Armenian geography VII according to R.H. St. Petersburg, 1877. P.36). Sometimes the entire population of Nashkho is assigned to one teip.\n\nSadoy. It is believed that this teip emerged from Bilta (together with Belgata and Ustrada). All of them are from Nashkho (tukhum Nokhchimokhoy).\n\nAlong with this, it is necessary to refer to the opinion of Akhmad Suleymanov that Sadoy was considered an aristocratic teip and princes (eli) came from him. A. Suleymanov (oral communication), voicing ali, derived this term from the ancient Caucasian socio-ethnic term Alans. At the same time, he believed that Sadoy is related to the teip Orsoy, since there is a merged term that refers to both groups: Sada-Orsi. In Orsy, Orsoy, this author sees the descendants of the Greeks. Let us pay attention to the fact that the Sadoi were not included in any of the tukhums, which, perhaps, indicates their foreign origin. At the same time, the aristocratic tradition of Sadoy is prestigious: it is an honor to give a name that indicates this teip.\n\nLet us recall Sado Misirbiev, a true friend of the young Leo Tolstoy. The ethnonym Ors - Aors can take us to the ethnogenetic layers of deep antiquity, associated, perhaps, with the Roksolani tribe, the possible ancestors of the Russians. Modern name Orsi sounds Russian Chechens. It is noteworthy that A. Aidamirov's \"Chronology of the History of Checheno-Ingushetia\" (p. 6) begins with an indication of the 1st century AD, when there was a union of gargareys and isadaks, consisting of gardens and hamkhits (there is an obvious typo in the text of the book - hashkit. It should be read Hamekites or Khamkhites Discussion about the origin of this ethnonym from the river Khamkhi in the book by E. L. Krupnov \"Medieval Ingushetia\" (Moscow, 1971, p. 28).\n\nTurloy. It is believed that the Terloi teip settled from the mountain tower complex of Kirda. An ancestor is a man named Terloy. According to some sources, Terloi was an independent tukhum in the 16th-17th centuries. In contrast to the non-blood kinship of all teips, Terloy (according to M. Mamakaev) together with Chanti were once a consanguineous association. Now Terloevtsy inhabit the territory along the upper reaches of the Argun. A complex of legends about their possession of special closed non-Muslim knowledge is associated with teip Terla. It is possible that Terloi were a caste of fire-worshipping priests (Assumption by S.A. Khasiev, expressed orally).\n\nTurkhoy(Turks from Gashan-chu). In the Vedeno region small group, referring itself to the \"Turkish\" teip. They also live in Roshni-chu.\n\nKharachoy. Teip of the famous Zelimkhan Kharachoevsky. This is also the teip of Ruslan Imranovich Khasbulatov. This teip found its way onto the pages of written Russian documents early on. But in the ethnographic reality of our days, the population of eastern Chechnya has a memory that \"Kharachoevites began to marry Russians earlier than others.\"\n\nThe close ties of the Kharachoevites with Russia did not prevent them from nominating at the beginning of this century one of the most prominent fighters against the injustices of tsarism - abrek Zelimkhan Kharachoevsky.\n\nIn Chechnya, they treat the Kharachoev teip with great respect and believe that its representatives are endowed with a special mind. True, they are reproached for speaking loudly. Perhaps there is not a single teip about which something like this would not be said. But this is the realm of Chechen humor, valued, by the way, once by Shamil.\n\nHindhoy. A small Chechen teip, settled in the mountains in the Galanchozh region. The Hindkhoevs by origin belong to the branch of the Orstkhoevs (Karabulaks), who became part of the Chechens. Another branch joined the Ingush. The Orstkhoys, who live on the plain, suffered the greatest losses as a result of the Caucasian War of the last century. Part of the remaining Orstkhoy settled in the countries of Western Asia, part went to the mountains, like Hindkhoy.\n\nTsontoroy (Tsentoroy). This is one of the most numerous teips. (In terms of numbers, only the Benoites compete with him). They are divided into Roots-Nekyo, Oki-Nekyo, and other groups claiming independence. The etymology of Tsontoroy goes back, perhaps, to the designation of the priestly profession. Apparently, this was reflected in the wary attitude of the Tsontoroyites towards Shamil and his supporters. There is evidence in the literature that Shamil took revenge on the Tsontoroi for the murder of one of his associates. They are considered people of a restless energetic disposition. Settled mainly in the eastern part of Chechnya.\n\nChartoy. A very interesting teip, known for the fact that the Chartoys did not fight, but were always peacekeepers and mediators in intra-Chechen affairs. There is an opinion among representatives of other teips that it is a “Chartoy of Jewish origin”.\n\nCherma. One of the famous Chechen teips, to which the famous oilman and politician Tapa Chermoev belonged. The main settlement center of the Chermoevites is the village of Mekhkety. They have an ancestral mountain Chermoy-lam. But before, according to legend, they lived in the mountainous area of ​​​​Maista.\n\nElistanzhi. This teip comes from the Vedeno district of the village of Khattuni. From there he moved to Aldy near present-day Grozny. This teip is famous for the fact that Sheikh Mansur (Ushurma) descended from it, who was apparently born in 1765.\n\nEngenoy. Settled throughout Chechnya. It is considered a teip from which come Muslim preachers and religious heads - sheikhs. Indeed, many sheikhs came out of Engenoy.\n\nErsenoy. Teip, located in eastern Chechnya in historical area Nokhchimokh (Shalinsky, Gudermes district). After the campaigns of Tamerlane, this is one of the first teips who settled again on the plain. These teips were considered aristocratic. Now their representatives are credited with high spiritual qualities. In the etymology of \"Ersenoy\", a native speaker feels a connection with the masculine principle (Compare: er bukh = uncastrated bull, Russian bull).\n\nYalhoroy. From this teip comes the surname of Dzhokhar Dudayev. There is the village of Yalkhoroy, named after the teip. According to some versions, dependent people belonged to this teip, according to others, on the contrary, it is a teip that had hired workers. Most likely, the origin of this teip is associated with a professional caste organization and Yalhora were warriors who received payment from other teips for guarding the borders. In the research of M. Mamakaev about the Chechen teips, Yalkhoroi are listed among the indigenous Chechen teips. Obviously, Yalkhoroi belongs to the Orstkhoy component in the ethnogenesis of the Chechens, which we will discuss in more detail below. In Ingushetia, I recorded a legend that some surnames are related to the surname of D.M. Dudayev. For example, the surname of the Dakiyevs, who, according to legend, have common relatives with the Dudayevs in the sixth generation. According to this version, the first Dakiyevs, together with the Aushevs and Musolgovs, founded the village of Surkhokhi in Ingushetia. The Ingush branch of the Dudaevs also lives in Ingushetia.\n\nSpecial attention should be paid to the Orstkhoy origin of Yalkhoroy, if only because the local group of Orstkhoys - the Myalkhists - are considered in Chechnya to be the most devoted supporters of D.M. Dudayev. It is the Myalkhists that make up the main population of the village of Bamut. My work among the Myalhists convinced me that they are, indeed, the descendants of the militarily strongest unit of the Vainakh ethnic group, the Orstkhoys (Karabulaks). Since ancient times, they inhabited the North Caucasian plain. Deep in the mountains, in Myalkhist, between the upper reaches of the Argun and Meshekhi, they probably ended up during the devastating campaigns of Tamerlane in the North Caucasus, and here they included the original mountain Vainakh population. The memory of the obscure division into indigenous and newcomers is still traceable among the Myalchists.\n\nIn the mountains, the Myalkhists did not lose their warlike disposition and waged periodic wars with Georgia. (Their territory borders on Khevsureti). The Myalkhists, on the other hand, hid Ordzhonikidze from capture by the tsarist secret police. The cult of militancy, along with other mountain values ​​such as honoring a woman, hospitality, according to the Myalkhists themselves, distinguishes them from other Chechens. Some of them consider themselves people of princely dignity. Other Chechens are afraid of the decisive nature of the Myalhists.\n\nIn the government bodies of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria under D.M. Dudayev turned out to be a lot of Myalkhists. This caused talk about their dominance in the republic. About the special attitude of D.M. Dudayev nothing is known about this problem. His patronage of the religious brotherhood of the Kadirians, represented by the Myalkhists, does not yet say anything, because this brotherhood is widespread in Chechnya and not only among the mountain population.\n\nThe head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, belongs to the Benoy teip, one of the most numerous and famous Chechen teips. Its representatives are brave warriors, talented leaders and true admirers of ancient customs. So what is known about Kadyrov's teip?\n\nHistorical facts\n\nTeip (genus, tribe) is a unit of organization of the Vainakh peoples (Chechens, Ingush, Batsbi), which is distinguished by the common origin of its constituent people. The Chechen teip is not a genus in the ethnographic sense. There are cases when he united people according to principles, and not by consanguinity. Each teip is subdivided into gars and nekyi (branches and surnames).\n\nLegends say that the ancient Chechens had a bronze cauldron with the names of the first twenty teips forged on it. Among them was Benoy.\n\nThe village of Benoy is mentioned in ancient Arabic-language sources of other peoples. Information about Benoy is available in the book of the first half of the 15th century by the Alanian traveler and Muslim missionary Azdin Vazar. This suggests that it is rightfully considered the oldest.\n\nOne of the leaders in number\n\nBenoy is one of the most numerous teips in Chechnya. Representatives of this clan claim that out of a million Chechens, a third belongs to their teip. They are settled throughout the republic and are divided into nine genera: Jobi-nekye, Asti-nekye, Uonzhbi-nekye, Ati-nekye, Ochi-nekye, Chupal-nekye, Devshi-nekye, Edi-nekye and Gurzh-makhkahoy.\n\nLarge communities settled in Benoy, Shelkovsky, Gudermes districts, the villages of Novye Atagi, Urus-Martan, Goity, Alkhan-Yurt, Shali and others. Most of the Benoyites are in the city of Urus-Martan. Teip natives live in the Chechen Republic, the Republic of Dagestan, other regions of the Russian Federation, the Republic of Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Kazakhstan, Turkey, Jordan, Saudi Arabia. A large number of Benoevs live in the diasporas of Western Asia.\n\nCharacteristic features of the Benoites\n\nIn the view of the Chechens, a true Benoev is a man of athletic build, tall, large, with big strong legs. A distinctive feature of people of this kind is a calm disposition, frankness, decency and gullibility. But at the same time, if they are angry, they will show everyone their militancy. People often say: \"If you piss off a Benoite, then nothing can stop him.\"\n\nAt home, they are considered cunning and clumsy. But at the same time, the Benoyites are always fearless, true to their duty and word. They are well aware of the value of such concepts as \"honor\" and \"decency\". It was they who, many centuries ago, formed the backbone of the peasant people, who were able to get rid of the oppression of the Dagestan and Kabardian authorities. Representatives of this teip are considered the founders of democracy in the mountains, on which the ethnic mentality is based.\n\nA. Berge in his book \"Chechnya and Chechens\" calls teip Benoy among the indigenous Samyz noble Chechen families. The Benoevtsy, as the largest tribe in terms of numbers, played a leading role in the social and political life of Chechnya for a long time.\n\nBeliefs and values\n\nRepresentatives of teip Benoy are considered true Chechens. They are proud of their belonging to this nation. national name\"Nokhchiy\" is pronounced with dignity, in contrast to some Chechens who are reluctant to call themselves \"Nokhchiy\", they try to put this name out of use and replace it with \"Vain\".\n\nThe people of this teip consider each other brothers and sisters. Helping a loved one is the first rule of the family. No matter how many kilometers separate them, upon learning that they are of the same teip, the Benoevs strive with all their might to help each other in case of danger or need. Protecting their honor, the honor of a brother or the entire teip is a paramount task for which they are ready to risk their lives.\n\nmilitary glory\n\nThe Benoyites have always taken the most active part in wars. In battles, they earned themselves unfading glory. They played a particularly significant role in the Russian-Chechen war of the 18th - mid-19th centuries.\n\nIt is known that only with the support of the Benoyites did imams and commanders begin their movements in Ichkeria and throughout Chechnya. When the Chechens were attacked by enemies, the saying “Va Vezan Dela, benoin ortza lolah!” was born among the people! (Oh, Great God, give the Benoyan army to help).\n\nRepresentatives of the teip showed their heroism in the Caucasian War, in the Ichkerian (1842) and Dargin (1845) defeat of the tsarist armies, in the campaign against Georgia (1854) and others.\n\nOn May 13, 1859, all of Chechnya was conquered, and the foremen of all Chechen villages expressed their obedience to the tsarist military command. Only the Benoy villages did not submit. Brave, savvy people fled to the forests, formed new communities and again confronted the enemies, calling on everyone to defend their homeland to the last breath.\n\nThe Chechen teip is a community of people related to each other by blood kinship on the paternal side. Each of them had their own communal lands and a teip mountain (from the name of which the name of the teip often came). Teips within themselves are divided into so-called. \"gars\" (branches) and \"neki\" - a term that has the meaning of a surname. Chechen teips are united in nine tukhums, a kind of territorial unions. Blood relations among the Chechens served the goals of economic and military unity.\n\nA teip organization is a cell where a personality is formed. The teip establishes and maintains ethical norms centered around the term “ozdangala”, which means modesty, good breeding, composure, sincerity, courtesy. The norms of \"ozdangala\" provide, for example, the condemnation of a person for cutting off a branch for the sake of pampering; they force a Chechen to sit without leaning back, without spreading his legs, without turning his head, not to stare at a woman, etc. A person who follows the norms of “ozdangala” must show courage and heroism in emergency circumstances. Etiquette norms of behavior prescribe the younger to stand up when the elder appears, to go to the left of the elder, to occupy a certain place in the room, to feed the guest first, etc.\n\nSince in a traditional society the proximity of territory and blood often coincide, it is more correct to call a teip a tribal-territorial community. In fact, teip are groups of several genera living on common territory and are in a relationship of social equality. A teip group is a community of closely related surnames. In the villages and auls of Chechnya, there are entire neighborhoods and streets where people from one teip have long lived and they are called by his name.\n\nThe teip group, like the family group, acts as an integral entity, each of its members strives to maintain its authority, the condemnation of a person for deviating from tribal and religious prescriptions is experienced and condemned by all its members.\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, the Chechen society consisted of 135 teips. Currently, they are divided into mountainous (about 100 teips) and plains (about 70 teips).\n\nIn the Chechen teip nomenclature, names based on territorial affiliation. For example, Kharachoy (“cave”), Khacharoy (“plum valley”), Shara (“glacier”)\n\nThere are teips, whose names are compiled according to production, according to the names of crafts. For example, Peshkhoy (“bakery”), Deshni (“goldsmith”), Khoy (“guards”).\n\nThere is also a conditional division of teips into \"pure\" and \"mixed\". Originally Chechen teips, called \"Nokhchmakhy\", who inhabited the area near Mount Nashkho, and then settled throughout Chechnya (Benoi, Tsentoroy, Kurchaloy, etc.) claim the title of \"clean\". The assimilated or “mixed” teips included foreigners (Gunoi - having a relationship with the Terek Cossacks, Dzumsa - with Georgians, Varanda - with Khevsurs, Kharacha - with Circassians, G1ezla - Tatars, Suli - Avars, G1umkhi - Kumyks, Zhutki - Jews-tatami ).\n\nTaipa representatives have long played one of the leading roles in public life region. Benoi settled widely in almost all settlements on the plains of Chechnya. Most representatives of this taip live in the city of Urus-Martan.\n\nCaucasian war\n\nThe Benoyites have always been distinguished by their inveterate hostility towards Tsarist Russia and submitted later than all the others, when the entire Eastern Caucasus was already subdued. For peace in the region, it was decided to resettle the ancestral village of taipa Benoy to a new place and therefore its inhabitants were settled in different auls of Chechnya.\n\nAs famous Chechen scientists Sh.A. Gapurov and Kh.S. Umkhaev, the Benoev settlers found themselves without land in new places, and with the onset of spring field work, in order to avoid starvation, the Benoevites decided to return to their native places. On the night of May 7-8, 50 families, resettled in the village of Dattykh and settled near oil wells, suddenly returned again to the ancestral village of Benoy.\n\nThe imperial authorities demanded that the Benoites immediately return to their former places of eviction. However, the Benoyites refused to comply with this order and tried to solve the problem by peace talks with the Russians. But the Russian authorities refused: for them, the behavior of the Benoevites was a form of protest, which had to be suppressed in any way, so that other settlers would be “disgusted” .\n\nHaving returned to their lands, the Benoyites, through intermediaries, asked the tsarist authorities not to resettle them, although they knew about the cruelty and hatred of General N.I. Evdokimov to the highlanders. Baysungur Benoyevsky knew and saw the difficult and humiliating situation of his fellow villagers, brought by the war to a beggarly state, almost to starvation. Previously, the Benoyites were among the wealthiest and wealthiest among all Chechen societies, thanks to their beautiful land and diligence.\n\nTo all the demands and requests of the Benoevites to leave them to live in their native lands, the tsarist authorities answered with a categorical refusal, they did not make any compromises with the Benoevites. The authorities deliberately provoked the Benoyites into disobedience, led the matter to armed clashes.\n\nAt the same time, the authorities began to prepare for the armed suppression of popular uprisings. In order to prevent popular unrest and prepare for a collision, the local leadership temporarily stopped engineering and Men at work and under the guise of training camps gathered two detachments in the Middle Military Department. Under these conditions, the Benoyites, led by Naib Baysungur, began to prepare to defend their aul and farms.\n\nColonel Golovachev, who at that time was the head of the Ichkerinsky district, on June 5, 1860, reported to the head of the Terek region N.I. Evdokimov that he has information that the neighboring Aukhites deliver bread to them, buying in the villages of Andreeva (now Endirey) and Tashkich (now Aksai). The Aukhites are so sympathetic to the cause of the Benoevites that they are about to follow the example of the Benoevites, if not all, then some of them."
