        "text": "Let the numbers talk.\n\nThese were the Top Ten figter aces for the R.A.F. (British & Commonwealth pilots) & the Soviet Air Forces for WW2, with their number of victories:\n\nR.A.F. :\n\nMarmaduke Pattle (South Africa) 51\n\nJames Johnson38 Brendan Finucane 32\n\nAdolphus Malan (South Africa) 32\n\nGeorge Beurling (Canada) 31\n\nWilliam Vale 31\n\nClive Caldwell (Australia) 29\n\nJohn Braham 29\n\nRobert Tuck 29\n\nJames Lacey 28\n\nTotal: 330 victories.\n\nSoviets:\n\nIvan Kozhedub 62\n\nAlexandr Pokryshkin 59\n\nNikolay Gulaev 57\n\nGrigoriy Rechkalov 56\n\nKirill Yevstigneev 53\n\nDmitriy Glinka 50\n\nArseniy Vorozheykin 46\n\nNikolay Skomorokhov 46\n\nAlexandr Koldunov 46\n\nNikolay Krasnov 44\n\nTotal: 510 victories.\n\nOf the British/Commonwealth aces, only Pattle would have ranked among the top ten Soviet aces (6th place).\n\nI'll add. The best English ace - Colonel D. Johnson - made for war 515 combat sorties, shot down but only 38 German aircraft. Best French ace - Lt. (Lt. Col. in the British Air Force) AP Klosterman - made for war 432 sorties and shot down a total of 33 German aircraft. And Ivan Nikitich Kozhedub, flying exclusively on Soviet aircraft, having made since 1943, only 330 combat sorties, shot down 62 German planes. In the UK Royal Air Force pilot shot down only 3 of 32 aircraft and more. And in the Soviet air force of 39. And to say AF Record Klubov that he personally shot down 31 aircraft, but in group fights - even 19? Or L. Shestakova, who on a personal account \"just\" 29 German planes, but in group fights - 45? Even if only a third of the 45 hit by them personally, and then L. Shestakov, who is 52-th place in the list of Soviet aces as a fighter pilot surpasses the best English ace.\n\nBritish and French pilots fought in one and a half times more time than the Soviets. In addition, until the end of 1941, the Soviet pilots did not conduct individual counts, and the aircraft shot down early in the war, nobody's personal account were not recorded. Therefore, if the British and French airmen were not so much better, at least not much worse than the Soviet, then their best fighter pilots would have had on the personal account of a lot more wins than the best Soviet pilots.\n\nBTW, the (partial) list of victories of Erich Hartmann (just the first 50; I was unable to post any more in this site)\n\nyou're not wondering what do you want fighters in the Air Force?\n\nTheir purpose to serve the bombers as they are the most valuable in the Air Force. They either have to shoot down the bombers, or maintain. Without them, they mean nothing. For example a fighter who went after a fighter escort and knocked him down and shot down by fighter bombers made a good bombing. He has not fulfilled the assignment.\n\nNow let's see how things were on the eastern front. Number of the Soviet Air Force as a percentage of about 1 / 1 fighters and bombers. But the fighters were evenly distributed across the front line while the bombers were flying in large groups. In fact, Hartman them and had to knock down. And in his statements should have been instead of 8% of bombers and about 80%. Apparently he was not very fond of the bombers.\n\nEven the Japanese airforce and Finnish did brilliantly against the Russians. Did the Japanese fight the Russians before or after the last set of purges in 36 i think they fought slightly later around 37 but i could be wrong.\n\nHere is a description of these battles:\n\nAlready the first clashes in late May showed the advantage of the Japanese airmen. So, for two days of fighting the Soviet fighter regiment lost 15 fighters, while the Japanese side has lost just one machine.\n\nThe Soviet commanders had to resort to drastic measures: May 29, from Moscow to the battle group flew pilots aces, led by deputy chief of Red Army Air Force Jacob Smushkevich. Many of them were heroes of the Soviet Union, had combat experience in the skies of Spain and China. After that, the air forces of the parties are roughly equal.\n\nAir battles resumed with renewed vigor in the last week of June. As a result, battles 22, 24 and 26 June, the Japanese lost more than 50 aircraft.\n\nEarly in the morning of June 27 Japanese aircraft could cause a surprise attack on Soviet airfields, which led to the destruction of 19 vehicles.\n\nIn total during the conflict, the Soviet Union lost 207, Japan - 162 aircraft ..\n\nWhole June the Soviets engaged in furnishing of defense on the eastern shore Khalkhyn goals and planning for a decisive counteroffensive. To ensure air superiority here were deployed new Soviet fighters modernized I-16 and The Seagull. \" So as a result of the battle on June 22, which has been gaining popularity in Japan (during the battle was shot down and captured by the famous Japanese ace pilot Takeo Fukuda, who became famous during the war in China), was provided by the superiority of the Soviet aircraft over the Japanese and managed to capture air supremacy. Total in aerial combat with 22 to 28 June, the Japanese air force lost 90 aircraft. Loss of Soviet aircraft were much smaller - 38 aircraft .\n\nErich also said the Soviets were worse than pilots on the Western front due to their lack of training, I think that's a fair assessment coming from the highest scoring ace.\n\nIMHO the best pilot was Marseilles, he shot more down in a shorter space of time than anyone else and on the Western Front/Desert too, his only shortcoming was that he didn't survive to carry on.\n\nEoR\n\nE. Hartmann (352 \"victory\"), G. Barkhorn (301), G. Rall (275), G. Graf (212), H. Linfert (203) were in one aviaeskadre JG 52, which statewide has been about 100 aircraft.\n\nIn the battle over the Prut, this squadron has caused loss of the Soviet air force and then for her restraint was transferred in September Guards Air Division AI Pokryshkina (also about 100 aircraft). After these battles H. Linnert complained \"that had never before encountered such a strong and demanding the enemy.\" Was shot down the second ace of the squadron, G. Barkhorn (301 win).\n\nSo that's typical. The Germans knew about the shelves and connections of Soviet aces, but never sent their aces to \"deal\" with the Soviets. Moreover, the widely known German signal \"Warning: In the air Pokryshkin\" warns pilots about their appearance in air fighter with the number \"100\" on board and on the need to get off from this area. Yes, the Soviet newcomers German aces beat willingly, but to engage in battle with the Soviet aces were in no hurry. But in Pokryshkina in the list \"just\" 59 downed aircraft, not 352, like Hartmann.\n\nFYI\n\nWhen the records of the Jagdflieger pilots became available after the war, they were initially greeted with incredulity - the highest claim was for 352 kills, and more than 100 pilots had recorded more than 100 victories. However, post-war research proved that these claims had in fact been made in good faith and confirmation had only been given after rigorous checking.\n\nWas it a turkey shoot on the Eastern Front?\n\n\"I was afraid in the air of the big unknown factors. Clouds and sun were hate and love in my feeling world. Today I am sure that eighty per cent of my kills never knew I was there before I opened fire. My dogfights were fast and simple on that account. But one factor always worked for me more than any other. I found I could spot enemy planes long before my comrades- sometimes minutes before them. This was not my experience or skill, but an advantage with which I was born. My rule for air fighting is this \"THE PILOT WHO SEES THE OTHER FIRST ALREADY HAS HALF THE VICTORY\"\n\nIn battling the Americans, Erich Hartmann redressed a technical disadvantage by skill and experience, and downed seven of the formidable Mustangs, whose demise was confirmed. When the odds in combat were eight to one against him and the Mustangs had him cold, he triumphed over their best efforts to outfly him and shot him down.\"\n\n- pp.173, Mustangs, The Blonde Knight of Germany. Col. Raymond F.Toliver & Trevor J. Constable 1970.\n\n\"Relatively early in his combat career, Erich Hartmann exceeded the 1939-1945 totals of the top scoring British and American fighter aces. Sketches already presented of Hartmann's fellow aces in JG-52 reveal that many German aces on the Eastern Front exceeded one hundred victories. Since the German methods of recording and verifying victories were accurate and reliable, the conclusion seems inescapable that Hartmann and other high scoring Eastern Front aces faced inferior opposition- both in planes and pilots. This conclusion can be justified only in a limited way, because many aspects of the Eastern Front air war bearing on fighter operations are but little known in the West outside Germany. If Russian inferiority in planes and pilots is accepted as a universal explanation for the success of the German aces in Russia, then notable achievements of Soviet industry and Russian fighter aces will be obscured. Dislike for an ideology or a regime must be set aside in assessing the historical facts of Soviet air power.\n\n…\n\nIn evaluating the Eastern Front air war and Erich Hartmann's achievements, an error is committed if we uncritically convince ourselves that he was shooting down ducks over the Steppes. The enemy could and did shoot back, with first-line aircraft often superior in performance to the Me-109. Some of these machines were flown by the top-scoring Allied aces of the war- Russian pilots who handily outscored the British and the Americans. A fair and unbiased view of Erich Hartmann's victory tally must therefore focus primarily on the quality of the Russian opposition, both technical and human.\n\nPublished engineering data precludes the theory of inferior Russian aircraft as a blanket explanation of high German scores. From the beginning of rhe Russo-German conflict, the Russians had at least one fighter that was superior to the Me-109 in most respects. As the war progressed, the Soviet aircraft industry not only produced other types of fighters superior to the many variants of the Me-109, but also accomplished prodigies of aircraft production, far outstripping the Germans in this sphere.\n\n…\n\nThere is a natural tendency in Western countries to regard the Anglo-American air assault on Germany as the major arena of aerial conflict. In truth, the aircraft losses sustained by the Soviet Union were approximately twice those suffered by the Anglo-American air forces. The biggest air war was fought on the Eastern Front.\n\n…\n\n\"Often there were ten of us against three hundred Russians. Those are long odds. A mid-air collision was almost as likely as being shot down, too. We had to plan our attacks against these hordes with great care of we never would have survived.\"\n\n…\n\nThe second highest scoring Soviet ace 'Pokryshkin' fought frequently against JG-52.\n\n119-131, Stalin Hawks, Ibid.\n\nFrom my Fighter Aces group.\n\nEoR\n\nInteresting facts:\n\nIn order to win the Knight's Cross on the Western Front German pilot had to win about 40 victories in the air. Say, the gentleman of all awards, including Diamonds, fought until his death solely on the Western Front, H. Lent (total of 113 victories) was awarded the Knight Cross of the 16 aircraft shot down (Polish and English). G. Jabs (50 victories) won the same award for the 19 downed French and British aircraft. H. Gollob (152 wins) - for 42 \"victory.\" F. Muller, brought down to 9 May 1945 30 aircraft, was awarded the Knight's Cross in July 1944, At the same time on the Eastern Front W. Batts (237 wins) gets the Knight's Cross of the 101 completed questionnaire.\n\nNo less striking numerical difference for the higher awards. On the Western Front H. Lent receives Oak Leaves to the Knight's Cross for 60 victories, H. Jabs, shot down during the war 50 aircraft Oak Leaves receives in March 1944 And on the Eastern Front, E. Hartmann (352 victories) gets the Oak Leaves only after 200 \"downed\" aircraft, V. Nowotny (258 victories) - after 190, G. Barkhorn (301 win) - after 175.\n\nAt the beginning of the war the German High Command was to give awards for more downed Soviet aircraft, and by the end - for a smaller number, since the progress of the war it became harder to shoot down Soviet aircraft. But in fact the opposite is true! On the Eastern Front was the beginning of the war Oak Leaves to the Knight's Cross were given to the pilot for 40 aircraft shot down, but already in 1942 - over 100 in 1943 - over 120, and by the end of 1943 - over 190. This is how to understand?"
