        "text": "Dissipation of Electrical Energy in Submerged Arc Furnaces Producing Silicomanganese and High-Carbon Ferromanganese\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSteenkamp, Joalet Dalene; Hockaday, Christopher James; Gous, Johan Petrus; Nzima, Thabo Witness\n\n2017-09-01\n\nSubmerged-arc furnace technology is applied in the primary production of ferroalloys. Electrical energy is dissipated to the process via a combination of arcing and resistive heating. In processes where a crater forms between the charge zone and the reaction zone, electrical energy is dissipated mainly through arcing, e.g., in coke-bed based processes, through resistive heating. Plant-based measurements from a device called \"Arcmon\" indicated that in silicomanganese (SiMn) production, at times up to 15% of the electrical energy used is transferred by arcing, 30% in high-carbon ferromanganese (HCFeMn) production, compared with 5% in ferrochromium and 60% in ferrosilicon production. On average, the arcing is much less at 3% in SiMn and 5% in HCFeMn production.\n\nNew algorithm for controlling electric arc furnaces using their vibrational and acoustic characteristics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCherednichenko, V. S.; Bikeev, R. A.; Serikov, V. A.; Rechkalov, A. V.; Cherednichenko, A. V.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe processes occurring in arc discharges are analyzed as the sources of acoustic radiation in an electric arc furnace (EAF). Acoustic vibrations are shown to transform into mechanical vibrations in the furnace laboratory. The shielding of the acoustic energy fluxes onto water-cooled wall panels by a charge is experimentally studied. It is shown that the rate of charge melting and the depth of submergence of arc discharges in the slag and metal melt can be monitored by measuring the vibrational characteristics of furnaces and using them in a universal industrial process-control system, which was developed for EAFs.\n\nEffect of basicity on beneficiated chromite sand smelting process using submerged arc furnace\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNurjaman, F.; Subandrio, S.; Ferdian, D.; Suharno, Bambang\n\n2018-05-01\n\nFerrochrome is an important alloy in stainless steel making due to its contribution to high strength and corrosion resistance. In this present study, ferrochrome was derived from Indonesian chromite sand with low-grade Cr/Fe ratio. In order to improve the ratio, beneficiation process such as pre-magnetic separation and reduction process at 1000Â°C for 60 minutes was required. The process followed by another magnetic separation, thus the Cr/Fe ratio was increased from 0.9 to 1.6. The reduction process used coconut shell charcoal as reductant and limestone as an additive. The beneficiated sand chromite was briquette using bentonite as a binder in 2 wt.% before it was smelted in a submerged electric arc furnace to produce ferrochrome. Basicity was controlled by the addition of limestone and it was varied from 0.4-1.6. Furthermore, the composition of ferrochrome was analyzed by using X-Ray Fluorescence. From this experiment, the result showed that chromium recovery and specific energy was decreased with the increasing of slag basicity.\n\nPragmatic analysis of the electric submerged arc furnace continuum\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKaralis, K.; Karkalos, N.; Antipas, G. S. E.; Xenidis, A.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nA transient mathematical model was developed for the description of fluid flow, heat transfer and electromagnetic phenomena involved in the production of ferronickel in electric arc furnaces. The key operating variables considered were the thermal and electrical conductivity of the slag and the shape, immersion depth and applied electric potential of the electrodes. It was established that the principal stimuli of the velocities in the slag bath were the electric potential and immersion depth of the electrodes and the thermal and electrical conductivities of the slag. Additionally, it was determined that, under the set of operating conditions examined, the maximum slag temperature ranged between 1756 and 1825 K, which is in accordance with industrial measurements. Moreover, it was affirmed that contributions to slag stirring due to Lorentz forces and momentum forces due to the release of carbon monoxide bubbles from the electrode surface were negligible.\n\nPragmatic analysis of the electric submerged arc furnace continuum\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKarkalos, N.; Xenidis, A.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nA transient mathematical model was developed for the description of fluid flow, heat transfer and electromagnetic phenomena involved in the production of ferronickel in electric arc furnaces.

Indonesian limonite ore used in this study originated from Sulawesi Island with the composition of Ni (1.26%) and Fe (43%). Metallurgical coke was applied as the reductant. This study showed that the the highest nickel and iron recovery as well as metal yield can be resulted from the basicity of 0.8 and reductant amount of 0.23 kg coke/kg limonite ore. Nickel content in the NPI produced was around 3 - 4%. It was concluded that this experiment can produce medium grade NPI.\n\nMethod for processing aluminum spent potliner in a graphite electrode ARC furnace\n\nDOEpatents\n\nO'Connor, William K.; Turner, Paul C.; Addison, Gerald W.\n\n2002-12-24\n\nA method of processing spent aluminum pot liner containing carbon, cyanide compositions, fluorides and inorganic oxides. The spent aluminum pot liner is crushed iron oxide is added to form an agglomerated material. The agglomerated material is melted in an electric arc furnace having the electrodes submerged in the molten material to provide a reducing environment during the furnace operation. In the reducing environment, pot liner is oxidized while the iron oxides are reduced to produce iron and a slag substantially free of cyanide compositions and fluorides. An off-gas including carbon oxides and fluorine is treated in an air pollution control system with an afterburner and a scrubber to produce NaF, water and a gas vented to the atmosphere free of cyanide compositions, fluorine and CO.\n\nComputational Modeling of Arc-Slag Interaction in DC Furnaces\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nReynolds, Quinn G.\n\n2017-02-01\n\nThe plasma arc is central to the operation of the direct-current arc furnace, a unit operation commonly used in high-temperature processing of both primary ores and recycled metals. The arc is a high-velocity, high-temperature jet of ionized gas created and sustained by interactions among the thermal, momentum, and electromagnetic fields resulting from the passage of electric current. In addition to being the primary source of thermal energy, the arc jet also couples mechanically with the bath of molten process material within the furnace, causing substantial splashing and stirring in the region in which it impinges. The arc's interaction with the molten bath inside the furnace is studied through use of a multiphase, multiphysics computational magnetohydrodynamic model developed in the OpenFOAMÂ® framework. Results from the computational solver are compared with empirical correlations that account for arc-slag interaction effects.\n\nMicrostructural changes of a thermally aged stainless steel submerged arc weld overlay cladding of nuclear reactor pressure vessels\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTakeuchi, T.; Kameda, J.; Nagai, Y.; Toyama, T.; Matsukawa, Y.; Nishiyama, Y.; Onizawa, K.\n\n2012-06-01\n\nThe effect of thermal aging on microstructural changes in stainless steel submerged arc weld-overlay cladding of reactor pressure vessels was investigated using atom probe tomography (APT). In as-received materials subjected to post-welding heat treatments (PWHTs), with a subsequent furnace cooling, a slight fluctuation of the Cr concentration was observed due to spinodal decomposition in the Î´-ferrite phase but not in the austenitic phase. Thermal aging at 400 Â°C for 10,000 h caused not only an increase in the amplitude of spinodal decomposition but also the precipitation of G phases with composition ratios of Ni:Si:Mn = 16:7:6 in the Î´-ferrite phase. The degree of the spinodal decomposition in the submerged arc weld sample was similar to that in the electroslag weld one reported previously. We also observed a carbide on the Î³-austenite and Î´-ferrite interface. There were no Cr depleted zones around the carbide.\n\nElements of the electric arc furnace's environmental management\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIoana, Adrian; Semenescu, Augustin; Costoiu, Mihnea; Marcu, DragoÅ\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe paper presents a theoretical and experimental analysis of the polluting generating mechanisms for steel making in the Electric Arc Furnaces (EAF). The scheme for the environment's polluting system through the EAF is designed and presented in this paper. The ecological experimenting consisted of determining by specialized measures of the dust percentage in the evacuated gases from the EAF and of thereof gas pollutants. From the point of view of reducing the impact on the environment, the main problem of the electric arc furnace (EAF) is the optimization of the powder collecting from the process gases, both from the furnace and from the work-area. The paper deals with the best dependence between the aggregate's constructive, functional and technological factors, which are necessary for the furnace's ecologization and for its energetically-technologically performances increasing.\n\nLaboratory arc furnace features interchangeable hearths\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nArmstrong, J.

It features a sight glass for observation.\n\nBehavior of an indigenously fabricated transferred arc plasma furnace for smelting studies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nA, K. MANDAL; R, K. DISHWAR; O, P. SINHA\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe utilization of industrial solid waste for metal recovery requires high-temperature tools due to the presence of silica and alumina, which is reducible at high temperature. In a plasma arc furnace, transferred arc plasma furnace (TAP) can meet all requirements, but the disadvantage of this technology is the high cost. For performing experiments in the laboratory, the TAP was fabricated indigenously in a laboratory based on the different inputs provided in the literature for the furnace design and fabrication. The observed parameters such as arc length, energy consumption, graphite electrode consumption, noise level as well as lining erosion were characterized for this fabricated furnace. The nitrogen plasma increased by around 200 K (200 Â°C) melt temperature and noise levels decreased by â¼10 dB compared to a normal arc. Hydrogen plasma offered 100 K (100 Â°C) higher melt temperature with â¼5 dB higher sound level than nitrogen plasma. Nitrogen plasma arc melting showed lower electrode and energy consumption than normal arc melting, whereas hydrogen plasma showed lower energy consumption and higher electrode consumption in comparison to nitrogen plasma. The higher plasma arc temperature resulted in a shorter meltdown time than normal arc with smoother arcing. Hydrogen plasma permitted more heats, reduced meltdown time, and lower energy consumption, but with increased graphite consumption and crucible wear. The present study showed that the fabricated arc plasma is better than the normal arc furnace with respect to temperature generation, energy consumption, and environmental friendliness. Therefore, it could be used effectively for smelting-reduction studies.\n\nCharacterization of Sintering Dust, Blast Furnace Dust and Carbon Steel Electric Arc Furnace Dust\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChang, Feng; Wu, Shengli; Zhang, Fengjie; Lu, Hua; Du, Kaiping\n\nIn order to make a complete understanding of steel plant metallurgical dusts and to realize the goal of zero-waste, a study of their properties was undertaken. For these purposes, samples of two sintering dusts (SD), two blast furnace dusts (BFD), and one electric arc furnace dust (EAFD) taken from the regular production process were subjected to a series of tests. The tests were carried out by using granulometry analysis, chemical analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy via SEM (EDS), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The dominant elements having an advantage of reuse are Fe, K, Cl, Zn, C. The dominant mineralogical phases identified in sintering dust are KCl, Fe2O3, CaCO3, CaMg(CO3)2, NaCl, SiO2. Mineralogical phases exist in blast furnace dust are Fe2O3, Fe3O4, with small amount of KCl and kaolinite coexist. While in electric arc furnace dust, Fe3O4, ZnFe2O4, CaCO3, CaO, Ca(OH)2 are detected.\n\nSubmerged arc welding of heavy plate\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWilson, R. A.\n\n1972-01-01\n\nThe submerged arc process is particularly suitable for heavy plate welding because of its ability to combine very high deposit rates along with excellent quality. It does these things without the smoke and spatter often accompanying other processes. It is available today in several forms that are pointed to the fabricators of heavy sections with long, short or round about welds. Tandem arc full automatic equipment is particularly suitable for those long heavy welds where speed and deposit rate are of the first order. An attachment called long stick-out which makes use of the IR drop on long electrode extensions can be included on this equipment to increase deposition rates 50% or more.\n\nMethod of operating a centrifugal plasma arc furnace\n\nDOEpatents\n\nKujawa, Stephan T.; Battleson, Daniel M.; Rademacher, Jr., Edward L.; Cashell, Patrick V.; Filius, Krag D.; Flannery, Philip A.; Whitworth, Clarence G.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nA centrifugal plasma arc furnace is used to vitrify contaminated soils and other waste materials. An assessment of the characteristics of the waste is performed prior to introducing the waste into the furnace. Based on the assessment, a predetermined amount of iron is added to each batch of waste. The waste is melted in an oxidizing atmosphere into a slag. The added iron is oxidized into Fe.sub.3 O.sub.4. Time of exposure to oxygen is controlled so that the iron does not oxidize into Fe.sub.2 O.sub.3. Slag in the furnace remains relatively non-viscous and consequently it pours out of the furnace readily. Cooled and solidified slag produced by the furnace is very resistant to groundwater leaching. The slag can be safely buried in the earth without fear of contaminating groundwater.\n\nMethod of operating a centrifugal plasma arc furnace\n\nDOEpatents\n\nKujawa, S.T.; Battleson, D.M.; Rademacher, E.L.

Whereas the radiative decay of thermal excitations is always taking place in high temperatures needed in steel production, one of the most promising environment for such studies are electric arc furnaces, creating plasma in excited electronic states that relax with intense characteristic emission in the optical regime. Unfortunately, large industrial scale electric arc furnaces also present a challenging environment for optical emission studies and application of the method is not straightforward. To study the usability of optical emission spectroscopy in real electric arc furnaces, we have developed a laboratory scale DC electric arc furnace presented in this paper. With the setup, optical emission spectra of Fe, Cr, Cr2O3, Ni, SiO2, Al2O3, CaO, and MgO were recorded in the wavelength range 250-600 nm and the results were analyzed with the help of reference data. The work demonstrates that using characteristic optical emission, obtaining in situ chemical information from oscillating plasma of electric arc furnaces is indeed possible. In spite of complications, the method could possibly be applied to industrial scale steel making process in order to improve its efficiency.\n\nLooking north at uing press of the submerged arc weld ...\n\nLibrary of Congress Historic Buildings Survey, Historic Engineering Record, Historic Landscapes Survey\n\nLooking north at u-ing press of the submerged arc weld (saw) line of the main pipe mill building, bay 7. - U.S. Steel National Tube Works, Main Pipe Mill Building, Along Monongahela River, McKeesport, Allegheny County, PA\n\nMethods of steel manufacturing - The electric arc furnace\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDragna, E. C.; Ioana, A.; Constantin, N.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nInitially, the carbon content was reduced by mixing âthe ironâ with metallic ingots in ceramic crucibles/melting pots, with external heat input. As time went by the puddling procedure was developed, a procedure which also assumes a mixture with oxidized iron ore. In 1856 Bessemer invented the convertor, thus demonstrating that steel can be obtained following the transition of an air stream through the liquid pig iron. The invention of Thomas, a slightly modified basic-lined converter, fostered the desulphurization of the steel and the removal of the phosphate from it. During the same period, in 1865, in Sireuil, the Frenchman Martin applies Siemensâ heat regeneration invention and brings into service the furnace with a charge composed of iron pig, scrap iron and iron ore, that produces a high quality steel [1]. An act worthy of being highlighted within the scope of steelmaking is the start-up of the converter with oxygen injection at the upper side, as there are converters that can produce 400 tons of steel in approximately 50 minutes. Currently, the share of the steel produced in electric arc furnaces with a charge composed of scrap iron has increased. Due to this aspect, the electric arc furnace was able to impose itself on the market.\n\nPower quality analysis of DC arc furnace operation using the Bowman model for electric arc\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGherman, P.

It is suggested that for operational control ratio of components of the charge must be solved the problem of determining the qualitative composition of the melt in real time. The use of 0th harmonic of phase voltage AC furnace as an indirect measure of the melt composition is proposed. Brief description of the mechanism of occurrence and nature of the non-zero 0th harmonic of the AC voltage of the arc is given. It is shown that value of 0th harmonic of the arc voltage is not function of electrical parameters but depends of the material composition of the melt. Processed industrial data are given. Hammerstein-Wiener model is used for description of the dependence of 0th harmonic of the furnace voltage from the technical parameters of melting furnace: the melt composition and current. Recommendations are given about the practical use of the model.\n\n40 CFR 63.10686 - What are the requirements for electric arc furnaces and argon-oxygen decarburization vessels?\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2011 CFR\n\n2011-07-01\n\n... arc furnaces and argon-oxygen decarburization vessels? 63.10686 Section 63.10686 Protection of...

In Greece, slags are mostly produced from steelmaking using the electric arc furnace process, and subsequently are either disposed in a random way or utilized by the cement industry. Steel slag has been recently used, worldwide, as hard aggregates in wearing courses in order to improve the skidding resistance of asphalt pavements. At the Highway Laboratory, Department of Civil Engineering of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki research has been carried out in the field of steel slags, and especially in electric arc furnace (EAF) slag, to evaluate their possible use in highway engineering.

A decrease of both impurities by a factor of 3 using purer raw materials would allow for the direct production of the upgraded metallurgical grade (UMG).This would significantly improve the efficiency of the resulting photovoltaic (PV) cells made with the refined solar grade silicon (SoG-Si) or massively decrease the costs of Si purification by shortening the number of steps needed for reaching B and P contents below 1 ppm requested for the SoG-Si used for the PV cells. A composite C/SiO2 briquette fulfilling the purity targets for the direct production of UMG-Si in the arc furnace was developed. The composite contains several carbon materials with different levels of reactivities and quartz sand. The raw materials aspects, the paste and briquette preparation, as well as the final carbonization step are discussed. The finished briquettes are free of volatiles and are mechanically and thermally very stable, thus, ensuring stable arc furnace charges with minimum losses of dust and SiO gas. Semi-industrial trials including the downstream purification steps for the production of SoG-Si by a metallurgical low-cost route are contemplated.\n\nDC graphite arc furnace, a simple system to reduce mixed waste volume\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nWittle, J.K.; Hamilton, R.A.; Trescot, J.\n\n1995-12-31\n\nThe volume of low-level radioactive waste can be reduced by the high temperature in a DC Graphite Arc Furnace. This volume reduction can take place with the additional benefit of having the solid residue being stabilized by the vitrified product produced in the process. A DC Graphite Arc Furnace is a simple system in which electricity is used to generate heat to vitrify the material and thermally decompose any organic matter in the waste stream. Examples of this type of waste are protective clothing, resins, and grit blast materials produced in the nuclear industry. The various Department of Energy (DOE)moreÂ Â» complexes produce similar low-level waste streams. Electro-Pyrolysis, Inc. and Svedala/Kennedy Van Saun are engineering and building small 50-kg batch and up to 3,000 kg/hr continuous feed DC furnaces for the remediation, pollution prevention, and decontamination and decommissioning segments of the treatment community. This process has been demonstrated under DOE sponsorship at several facilities and has been shown to produce stable waste forms from surrogate waste materials.Â«Â less\n\nCalculation of gas release from DC and AC arc furnaces in a foundry\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKrutyanskii, M. M.; Nekhamin, S. M.; Rebikov, E. M.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nA procedure for the calculation of gas release from arc furnaces is presented. The procedure is based on the stoichiometric ratios of the oxidation of carbon in liquid iron during the oxidation heat period and the oxidation of iron from a steel charge by oxygen in the period of solid charge melting during the gas exchange of the furnace cavity with the external atmosphere.\n\nDross treatment in a rotary arc furnace with graphite electrodes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDrouet, Michel G.; Handfield, My; Meunier, Jean; Laflamme, Claude B.\n\n1994-05-01\n\nAluminum baths are always covered with a layer of dross resulting from the aluminum surface oxidation. This dross represents 1-10% of the melt and may contain up to 75wt.% aluminum. Since aluminum production is highly energy intensive, dross recycling is very attractive from both energy and economic standpoints. The conventional recycling process using salt rotary furnaces is thermally inefficient and environmentally unacceptable because of the production of salt slags. Hydro-Quebec has developed a new technology using a rotary arc furnace with graphite electrodes. This process provides aluminum recovery rates of 80-90%, using a highly energy efficient, environmentally sound production method.\n\nA Heat and Mass Transfer Model of a Silicon Pilot Furnace\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSloman, Benjamin M.; Please, Colin P.; Van Gorder, Robert A.; Valderhaug, Aasgeir M.; Birkeland, Rolf G.; Wegge, Harald\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThe most common technological route for metallurgical silicon production is to feed quartz and a carbon source ( e.g., coal, coke, or charcoal) into submerged-arc furnaces, which use electrodes as electrical conductors. We develop a mathematical model of a silicon furnace. A continuum approach is taken, and we derive from first principles the equations governing the time evolution of chemical concentrations, gas partial pressures, velocity, and temperature within a one-dimensional vertical section of a furnace. Numerical simulations are obtained for this model and are shown to compare favorably with experimental results obtained using silicon pilot furnaces. A rising interface is shown to exist at the base of the charge, with motion caused by the heating of the pilot furnace. We find that more reactive carbon reduces the silicon monoxide losses, while reducing the carbon content in the raw material mixture causes greater solid and liquid material to build-up in the charge region, indicative of crust formation (which can be detrimental to the silicon production process). We also comment on how the various findings could be relevant for industrial operations.\n\nComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Investigation of Submerged Combustion Behavior in a Tuyere Blown Slag-fuming Furnace\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHuda, Nazmul; Naser, Jamal; Brooks, G. A.; Reuter, M. A.; Matusewicz, R. W.\n\n2012-10-01\n\nA thin-slice computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of a conventional tuyere blown slag-fuming furnace has been developed in Eulerian multiphase flow approach by employing a three-dimensional (3-D) hybrid unstructured orthographic grid system. The model considers a thin slice of the conventional tuyere blown slag-fuming furnace to investigate details of fluid flow, submerged coal combustion dynamics, coal use behavior, jet penetration behavior, bath interaction conditions, and generation of turbulence in the bath. The model was developed by coupling the CFD with the kinetics equations developed by Richards et al. for a zinc-fuming furnace. The model integrates submerged coal combustion at the tuyere tip and chemical reactions with the heat, mass, and momentum interfacial interaction between the phases present in the system. A commercial CFD package AVL Fire 2009.2 (AVL, Graz, Austria) coupled with several user-defined subroutines in FORTRAN programming language were used to develop the model. The model predicted the velocity, temperature field of the molten slag bath, generated turbulence and vortex, and coal use behavior from the slag bath. The tuyere jet penetration length ( l P) was compared with the equation provided by Hoefele and Brimacombe from isothermal experimental work ( {{l_{{P}} }/{d_{o }} = 10.7( {N^' }_{Fr} } )^{0.46} ( {Ï_{{g}} /Ïl } )^{0.35} } ) and found 2.26 times higher, which can be attributed to coal combustion and gas expansion at a high temperature. The jet expansion angle measured for the slag system studied is 85 deg for the specific inlet conditions during the simulation time studied. The highest coal penetration distance was found to be l/L = 0.2, where l is the distance from the tuyere tip along the center line and L is the total length (2.44 m) of the modeled furnace. The model also predicted that 10 pct of the injected coal bypasses the tuyere gas stream uncombusted and carried to the free surface by the tuyere gas stream, which\n\nRational position of a plasmatron and energy saving in a plasma-arc steel-melting furnace\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMakarov, A. N.; Zuikov, R. M.; Lugovoi, Yu. A.\n\n2009-12-01\n\nThe rational position of a plasmatron in a plasma-arc steel-melting furnace is studied analytically. The rational position by the end of melting of a charge and after its melting is found to be the position of a plasmatron at an angle of 70 Â°-75 Â° to the vertical axis. As compared to the roof position of the plasmatron, this position increases arc radiation onto the metal pool and the arc efficiency increases by 40-60%.\n\nDC Electric Arc Furnace Application for Production of Nickel-Boron Master Alloys\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAlkan, Murat; TasyÃ¼rek, Kerem Can; Bugdayci, Mehmet; Turan, Ahmet; YÃ¼cel, Onuralp\n\n2017-09-01\n\nIn this study, nickel-boron (Ni-B) alloys were produced via a carbothermic reduction starting from boric acid (H3BO3) with high-purity nickel oxide (NiO), charcoal, and wood chips in a direct current arc furnace. In electric arc furnace experiments, different starting mixtures were used, and their effects on the chemical compositions of the final Ni-B alloys were investigated. After the reduction and melting stages, Ni-B alloys were obtained by tapping from the bottom of the furnace. The samples from the designated areas were also taken and analyzed. The chemical composition of the final alloys and selected samples were measured with wet chemical analysis. The Ni-B alloys had a composition of up to 14.82 mass% B. The phase contents of the final alloys and selected samples were measured using x-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD data helped predict possible reactions and reaction mechanisms. The material and energy balance calculations were made via the XRD Rietveld and chemical compositions. Nickel boride phases started to form 600 mm below the surface. The targeted NiB phase was detected at the tapping zone of the crucible (850-900 mm depth). The energy consumption was 1.84-4.29 kWh/kg, and the electrode consumption was 10-12 g/kg of raw material charged.\n\nFormation of the ZnFe2O4 phase in an electric arc furnace off-gas treatment system.\n\nPubMed\n\nSuetens, T; Guo, M; Van Acker, K; Blanpain, B\n\n2015-04-28\n\nTo better understand the phenomena of ZnFe2O4 spinel formation in electric arc furnace dust, the dust was characterized with particle size analysis, X-ray fluorescence (XRF), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA). Different ZnFe2O4 formation reaction extents were observed for iron oxide particles with different particle sizes. ZnO particles were present as both individual particles and aggregated on the surface of larger particles. Also, the slag particles found in the off-gas were shown not to react with the zinc vapor. After confirming the presence of a ZnFe2O4 formation reaction, the thermodynamic feasibility of in-process separation - a new electric arc furnace dust treatment technology - was reevaluated. The large air intake and the presence of iron oxide particles in the off-gas were included into the thermodynamic calculations. The formation of the stable ZnFe2O4 spinel phase was shown to be thermodynamically favorable in current electric arc furnace off-gas ducts conditions even before reaching the post combustion chamber.

The most important factors of weld bead geometry are governed by the weld dilution which controls the chemical and mechanical properties. Submerged arc welding process is used generally due to its very easy control of process variables, good penetration, high weld quality, and smooth finish. Machining parameters, with suitable weld quality can be achieved with the different composition of the flux in the weld. In the present study Si02-Al2O3-CaO flux system was used. In SiO2 based flux NiO, MnO, MgO were mixed in various proportions. The paper investigates the relationship between the process parameters like voltage, % of flux constituents and dilution with the help of Taguchiâs method. The experiments were designed according to Taguchi L9 orthogonal array, while varying the voltage at two different levels in addition to alloying elements. Then the optimal results conditions were verified by confirmatory experiments.\n\n40 CFR 63.1652 - Emission standards.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2012 CFR\n\n2012-07-01\n\n... operator shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from any new or reconstructed submerged arc... to be discharged into the atmosphere from any existing open submerged arc furnace exhaust gases... or operator shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from any existing semi-sealed submerged...\n\n40 CFR 63.1652 - Emission standards.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2014 CFR\n\n2014-07-01\n\n... operator shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from any new or reconstructed submerged arc... to be discharged into the atmosphere from any existing open submerged arc furnace exhaust gases... or operator shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from any existing semi-sealed submerged...\n\n40 CFR 63.1652 - Emission standards.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2013 CFR\n\n2013-07-01\n\n... operator shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from any new or reconstructed submerged arc... to be discharged into the atmosphere from any existing open submerged arc furnace exhaust gases... or operator shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from any existing semi-sealed submerged...\n\nComputational Fluid Dynamic Modeling of Zinc Slag Fuming Process in Top-Submerged Lance Smelting Furnace\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHuda, Nazmul; Naser, Jamal; Brooks, Geoffrey; Reuter, Markus A.; Matusewicz, Robert W.\n\n2012-02-01\n\nSlag fuming is a reductive treatment process for molten zinciferous slags for extracting zinc in the form of metal vapor by injecting or adding a reductant source such as pulverized coal or lump coal and natural gas. A computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model was developed to study the zinc slag fuming process from imperial smelting furnace (ISF) slag in a top-submerged lance furnace and to investigate the details of fluid flow, reaction kinetics, and heat transfer in the furnace. The model integrates combustion phenomena and chemical reactions with the heat, mass, and momentum interfacial interaction between the phases present in the system. A commercial CFD package AVL Fire 2009.2 (AVL, Graz, Austria) coupled with a number of user-defined subroutines in FORTRAN programming language were used to develop the model. The model is based on three-dimensional (3-D) Eulerian multiphase flow approach, and it predicts the velocity and temperature field of the molten slag bath, generated turbulence, and vortex and plume shape at the lance tip. The model also predicts the mass fractions of slag and gaseous components inside the furnace. The model predicted that the percent of ZnO in the slag bath decreases linearly with time and is consistent broadly with the experimental data. The zinc fuming rate from the slag bath predicted by the model was validated through macrostep validation process against the experimental study of Waladan et al. The model results predicted that the rate of ZnO reduction is controlled by the mass transfer of ZnO from the bulk slag to slag-gas interface and rate of gas-carbon reaction for the specified simulation time studied. Although the model is based on zinc slag fuming, the basic approach could be expanded or applied for the CFD analysis of analogous systems.\n\nThermodynamic modelling of the formation of zinc-manganese ferrite spinel in electric arc furnace dust.\n\nPubMed\n\nPickles, C A\n\n2010-07-15\n\nElectric arc furnace dust is generated when automobile scrap, containing galvanized steel, is remelted in an electric arc furnace. This dust is considered as a hazardous waste in most countries. Zinc is a major component of the dust and can be of significant commercial value. Typically, the majority of the zinc exists as zinc oxide (ZnO) and as a zinc-manganese ferrite spinel ((Zn(x)Mn(y)Fe(1-x-y))Fe(2)O(4)). The recovery of the zinc from the dust in metal recycling and recovery processes, particularly in the hydrometallurgical extraction processes, is often hindered by the presence of the mixed ferrite spinel. However, there is a paucity of information available in the literature on the formation of this spinel. Therefore, in the present research, the equilibrium module of HSC Chemistry 6.1 was utilized to investigate the thermodynamics of the formation of the spinel and the effect of variables on the amount and the composition of the mixed ferrite spinel. It is proposed that the mixed ferrite spinel forms due to the reaction of iron-manganese particulates with both gaseous oxygen and zinc, at the high temperatures in the freeboard of the furnace above the steel melt. Based on the thermodynamic predictions, methods are proposed for minimizing the formation of the mixed ferrite spinel. 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Steady trend of last years is an increase of steel production in electric arc furnaces (EAF) with a very high consumption of electricity up to 750 kWh/ton. The intention to reduce so much energy consumption they can reach by many ways. One of such way is a transforming heat energy of liquid steel to electricity and destine it to steel electric arc process. Under certain conditions, it may lead to âzeroâ consumption of electric power in the process. The development of these conditions leads to the formation of energy-efficient heat schemes, with a minimum electricity consumption from the external network.\n\nHigh temperature furnace modeling and performance verifications\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSmith, James E., Jr.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nAnalytical, numerical, and experimental studies were performed on two classes of high temperature materials processing sources for their potential use as directional solidification furnaces. The research concentrated on a commercially available high temperature furnace using a zirconia ceramic tube as the heating element and an Arc Furnace based on a tube welder. The first objective was to assemble the zirconia furnace and construct parts needed to successfully perform experiments. The 2nd objective was to evaluate the zirconia furnace performance as a directional solidification furnace element. The 3rd objective was to establish a data base on materials used in the furnace construction, with particular emphasis on emissivities, transmissivities, and absorptivities as functions of wavelength and temperature. A 1-D and 2-D spectral radiation heat transfer model was developed for comparison with standard modeling techniques, and were used to predict wall and crucible temperatures. The 4th objective addressed the development of a SINDA model for the Arc Furnace and was used to design sample holders and to estimate cooling media temperatures for the steady state operation of the furnace. And, the 5th objective addressed the initial performance evaluation of the Arc Furnace and associated equipment for directional solidification. Results of these objectives are presented.\n\nDiagnostics for a waste processing plasma arc furnace (invited) (abstract)a)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWoskov, P. P.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nMaintaining the quality of our environment has become an important goal of society. As part of this goal new technologies are being sought to clean up hazardous waste sites and to treat ongoing waste streams. A 1 MW pilot scale dc graphite electrode plasma arc furnace (Mark II) has been constructed at MIT under a joint program among Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL), MIT, and Electro-Pyrolysis, Inc. (EPI)c) for the remediation of buried wastes in the DOE complex. A key part of this program is the development of new and improved diagnostics to study, monitor, and control the entire waste remediation process for the optimization of this technology and to safeguard the environment. Continuous, real time diagnostics are needed for a variety of the waste process parameters. These parameters include internal furnace temperatures, slag fill levels, trace metals content in the off-gas stream, off-gas molecular content, feed and slag characterization, and off-gas particulate size, density, and velocity distributions. Diagnostics are currently being tested at MIT for the first three parameters. An active millimeter-wave radiometer with a novel, rotatable graphite waveguide/mirror antenna system has been implemented on Mark II for the measurement of surface emission and emissivity which can be used to determine internal furnace temperatures and fill levels. A microwave torch plasma is being evaluated for use as a excitation source in the furnace off-gas stream for continuous atomic emission spectroscopy of trace metals. These diagnostics should find applicability not only to waste remediation, but also to other high temperature processes such as incinerators, power plants, and steel plants.\n\nOPTIMAL OPERATION OF ELECTRIC ARC FURNACES (EAF) TO MINIMIZE THE GENERATION OF AIR POLLUTANTS AT THE SOURCE\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nThe manufacture of steel by electric arc furnaces (EAF) is continuing to increase in usage in the United States with current production estimated to be over 63 million tons per year.

It gives details of the quality and quantity of the sensible and chemical waste heat in typical EAF off gases, energy savings potential by recovering part of this heat, a comprehensive review of currently used waste heat recovery methods and potential for use of advanced designs to achieve a much higher level of heat recovery including scrap preheating, steam production and electric power generation. Based on our preliminary analysis, currently, for all electricmoreÂ Â» arc furnaces used in the US steel industry, the energy savings potential is equivalent to approximately 31 trillion Btu per year or 32.7 peta Joules per year (approximately $182 million US dollars/year). This article describes the EAF off-gas enthalpy model developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to calculate available and recoverable heat energy for a given stream of exhaust gases coming out of one or multiple EAF furnaces. This Excel based model calculates sensible and chemical enthalpy of the EAF off-gases during tap to tap time accounting for variation in quantity and quality of off gases. The model can be used to estimate energy saved through scrap preheating and other possible uses such as steam generation and electric power generation using off gas waste heat. This article includes a review of the historical development of existing waste heat recovery methods, their operations, and advantages/limitations of these methods. This paper also describes a program to develop and test advanced concepts for scrap preheating, steam production and electricity generation through use of waste heat recovery from the chemical and sensible heat contained in the EAF off gases with addition of minimum amount of dilution or cooling air upstream of pollution control equipment such as bag houses.Â«Â less\n\nHydrogen mitigation in submerged arc welding\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKlimowicz, Steven\n\nWith the role of hydrogen in weld metal well understood in its relation to cold cracking, there has been a push to produce welds with lower and lower diffusible hydrogen contents. The push for lower diffusible hydrogen contents has placed pressure on consumables manufactures to create consumables that can achieve the requirements for lower diffusible hydrogen content. Currently EM12K flux is produced so that it can achieve below 4 ml of diffusible hydrogen for every 100g of weld metal deposited (ml/100g) for submerged arc welding (SAW). The recent trend for industry is to preferentially achieve diffusible hydrogen contents below 3 ml/100g. Making it necessary to find a way to modify the flux to achieve a lower diffusible hydrogen content for the welds it produces. To achieve this goal a two phase plan was developed. The first phase was to characterize the entire welding system for hydrogen. Since the goal of the project is hydrogen mitigation, any amount of hydrogen that could be reduced is helpful and therefore must first be discovered. Sources of hydrogen may be found by analyzing the welding wire and base metal, as well as breaking the flux down into its components and production steps. The wire was analyzed for total hydrogen content as was the base metal. The flux and its components were analyzed using differential thermal analysis-simultaneous thermal analysis (DTA-STA) and later vacuum degassing for moisture content. The analysis of the wire showed that the copper coating on the wire was the largest contributor of hydrogen. There was lubricant present on the wire surface as well, but it did not contribute as much as the copper coating. It was found that a simple low temperature baking of the wire was enough to remove the lubricant and coating moisture. The base metal was found to have a similar total hydrogen content to that of the wire. The breakdown of the flux and production process for moisture content analysis revealed that the production process\n\nMetals purification by improved vacuum arc remelting\n\nDOEpatents\n\nZanner, Frank J.; Williamson, Rodney L.; Smith, Mark F.\n\n1994-12-13\n\nThe invention relates to improved apparatuses and methods for remelting metal alloys in furnaces, particularly consumable electrode vacuum arc furnaces. Excited reactive gas is injected into a stationary furnace arc zone, thus accelerating the reduction reactions which purify the metal being melted. Additionally, a cooled condensation surface is disposed within the furnace to reduce the partial pressure of water in the furnace, which also fosters the reduction reactions which result in a purer produced ingot. Methods and means are provided for maintaining the stationary arc zone, thereby reducing the opportunity for contaminants evaporated from the arc zone to be reintroduced into the produced ingot.\n\nStudy on mechanical and microstructure behavior of submerged arc welding flux using red mud\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDewangan, Rishi; Pandey, Pankaj K.; Upadhyay, Renu\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThis paper emphasis on utilization of Red Mud for preparing submerged arc welding flux and study its mechanical and microstructure behavior. Among the six fluxes prepared in the laboratory, Flux no. 1 (basicity 1.106) found to be best due to its running performance, micro hardness and Brinell hardness. The hardness value (HV) of the fluxes was varying from 165.70 to 217.15 at a load of 1000gm respectively. From the micrograph of welded metal, acicular ferrite found to be optimum which helps in increasing the ductility and hardness of the welded material.\n\nIn vitro assessment of genotoxic effects of electric arc furnace dust on human lymphocytes using the alkaline comet assay.\n\nPubMed\n\nGaraj-Vrhovac, Vera; Orescanin, Visnja; Ruk, Damir; Gajski, Goran\n\n2009-02-15\n\nIn vitro genotoxic effects of leachates of electric arc furnace dust (EAFD) on human peripheral lymphocytes, assessed prior and following the treatment with a strong alkaline solution were investigated using the alkaline comet assay. Prior and following the treatment, lymphocytes were incubated with leachate of EAFD for 6 and 24 hours at 37 degrees C. Negative controls were also included. Mean values of the tail lengths established in the samples treated with the leachate stemming from the original dust for 6 and 24 hours, were 15.70 microm and 16.78 microm, respectively, as compared to 12.33 microm found in the control sample. Slight, but significant increase in the tail length was also found with the dust treated with a strong alkaline solution (13.37 microm and 13.60 microm). In case of high heavy metal concentrations (the extract of the original furnace dust), the incubation period was revealed to be of significance as well. The obtained results lead to the conclusion that alkaline comet assay could be used as a rapid, sensitive and low-cost tool when assessing genotoxicity of various waste materials, such as leachates of the electric arc furnace dust.\n\nCombinatorial synthesis of phosphors using arc-imaging furnace\n\nPubMed Central\n\nIshigaki, Tadashi; Toda, Kenji; Yoshimura, Masahiro; Uematsu, Kazuyoshi; Sato, Mineo\n\n2011-01-01\n\nWe have applied a novel âmelt synthesis techniqueâ rather than a conventional solid-state reaction to rapidly synthesize phosphor materials. During a synthesis, the mixture of oxides or their precursors is melted by light pulses (10â60 s) in an arc-imaging furnace on a water-cooled copper hearth to form a globule of 1â5 mm diameter, which is then rapidly cooled by turning off the light. Using this method, we synthesized several phosphor compounds including Y3Al5O12:Ce(YAG) and SrAl2O4:Eu,Dy. Complex phosphor oxides are difficult to produce by conventional solid-state reaction techniques because of the slow reaction rates among solid oxides; as a result, the oxides form homogeneous compounds or solid solutions. On the other hand, melt reactions are very fast (10â60 s) and result in homogeneous compounds owing to rapid diffusion and mixing in the liquid phase. Therefore, melt synthesis techniques are suitable for preparing multi component homogeneous compounds and solid solutions.

To gain insight into the complex processes of heat transfer inside the EAF vessel, not only radiation from the surfaces but also emission and absorption of the gas phase and the dust cloud need to be considered. Furthermore, the radiative heat exchange depends on the geometrical configuration which is continuously changing throughout the process. The present paper introduces a system model of the EAF which takes into account the radiative heat transfer between the surfaces and the participating medium. This is attained by the development of a simplified geometrical model, the use of a weighted-sum-of-gray-gases model, and a simplified consideration of dust radiation. The simulation results were compared with the data of real EAF plants available in literature.\n\nNuclear Technology. Course 28: Welding Inspection.

Dioxins in flue gas from stack and bag-filter ash (BFA) were detected. The distribution of heavy metals of Pb, Cd, As, and Cr along the flue gas process system was analyzed. Through a comparison of the results for dioxins and heavy metals in this study and previous work, carrying-over of fly ash particles with the flue gas stream can be deduced. Based on the magnetic induction equation and Navier-Stokes equations, a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model for the plasma arc was developed to describe the particle-carrying effect. The results indicate that, a. when melted, the feed forms of MSWI fly ash affect the results significantly; b. it is not preferable to melt MSWI fly ash directly, and efforts should be made to limit the mass transfer of OFA from the plasma furnace.\n\nFatigue crack growth behavior of pressure vessel steels and submerged arc weldments in a high-temperature pressurized water environment\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLiaw, P.K.; Logsdon, W.A.; Begley, J.A.\n\n1989-10-01\n\nThe fatigue crack growth rate (FCGR) properties of SA508 Cl 2a and SA533 Gr A Cl 2 pressure vessel steels and the corresponding automatic submerged arc weldments were developed in a high-temperature pressurized water (HPW) environment at 288{degrees} C (550{degrees} F) and 7.2 MPa (1044 psi) at load ratios of 0.20 and 0.50. The properties were generally conservative compared to American Society of Mechanical Engineers Section XI water environment reference curve. The growth rate of fatigue cracks in the base materials, however, was faster in the HPW environment than in a 288{degrees} C (550{degrees} F) base line air environment.

A liquid hydrocarbon composition is initially provided. An electrical arc is generated directly within the hydrocarbon composition so that the arc is entirely submerged in the composition. Arc generation is preferably accomplished using a primary and secondary electrode each having a first end submerged in the composition. The first ends of the electrodes are separated from each other to form a gap therebetween. An electrical potential is then applied to the electrodes to generate the arc within the gap. A reactive gas is thereafter delivered to the arc which forms a bubble around the arc. Gas delivery may be accomplished by providing a passageway through each electrode and delivering the gas through the passageways. The arc and gas cooperate to produce a plasma which efficiently cracks the hydrocarbon composition.\n\nA combined arc-melting and tilt-casting furnace for the manufacture of high-purity bulk metallic glass materials.\n\nPubMed\n\nSoinila, E; PihlajamÃ¤ki, T; Bossuyt, S; HÃ¤nninen, H\n\n2011-07-01\n\nAn arc-melting furnace which includes a tilt-casting facility was designed and built, for the purpose of producing bulk metallic glass specimens. Tilt-casting was chosen because reportedly, in combination with high-purity processing, it produces the best fatigue endurance in Zr-based bulk metallic glasses. Incorporating the alloying and casting facilities in a single piece of equipment reduces the amount of laboratory space and capital investment needed. Eliminating the sample transfer step from the production process also saves time and reduces sample contamination. This is important because the glass forming ability in many alloy systems, such as Zr-based glass-forming alloys, deteriorates rapidly with increasing oxygen content of the specimen. The challenge was to create a versatile instrument, in which high purity conditions can be maintained throughout the process, even when melting alloys with high affinity for oxygen. Therefore, the design provides a high-vacuum chamber to be filled with a low-oxygen inert atmosphere, and takes special care to keep the system hermetically sealed throughout the process. In particular, movements of the arc-melting electrode and sample manipulator arm are accommodated by deformable metal bellows, rather than sliding O-ring seals, and the whole furnace is tilted for tilt-casting. This performance of the furnace is demonstrated by alloying and casting Zr(55)Cu(30)Al(10)Ni(5) directly into rods up to Ã¸ 10 mm which are verified to be amorphous by x-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry, and to exhibit locally ductile fracture at liquid nitrogen temperature.\n\nImproved Casting Furnace Conceptual Design\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nFielding, Randall Sidney; Tolman, David Donald\n\nIn an attempt to ensure more consistent casting results and remove some schedule variance associated with casting, an improved casting furnace concept has been developed. The improved furnace uses the existing arc melter hardware and glovebox utilities. The furnace concept was designed around physical and operational requirements such as; a charge sized of less than 30 grams, high heating rates and minimal additional footprint. The conceptual model is shown in the report as well as a summary of how the requirements were met.\n\nHigh temperature aircraft research furnace facilities\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSmith, James E., Jr.; Cashon, John L.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nFocus is on the design, fabrication, and development of the High Temperature Aircraft Research Furnace Facilities (HTARFF). The HTARFF was developed to process electrically conductive materials with high melting points in a low gravity environment. The basic principle of operation is to accurately translate a high temperature arc-plasma gas front as it orbits around a cylindrical sample, thereby making it possible to precisely traverse the entire surface of a sample. The furnace utilizes the gas-tungsten-arc-welding (GTAW) process, also commonly referred to as Tungsten-Inert-Gas (TIG). The HTARFF was developed to further research efforts in the areas of directional solidification, float-zone processing, welding in a low-gravity environment, and segregation effects in metals. The furnace is intended for use aboard the NASA-JSC Reduced Gravity Program KC-135A Aircraft.\n\nMethod for cracking hydrocarbon compositions using a submerged reactive plasma system\n\nDOEpatents\n\nKong, P.C.\n\n1997-05-06\n\nA method is described for cracking a liquid hydrocarbon composition (e.g. crude oil) to produce a cracked hydrocarbon product.

The effects of processing parameters such as welding current, voltage, welding speed and groove angle on welding quality were investigated by Taguchi method. The optimal welding parameters were predicted and the individual importance of each parameter on welding quality was evaluated by examining the signal-to-noise ratio and analysis of variance (ANOVA) results. The importance order of the welding parameters for the welding quality of weld bead was: welding current > welding speed > groove angle > welding voltage. The welding quality of weld bead increased gradually with increasing welding current and welding speed and decreasing groove angle. The optimum values of the welding current, welding speed, groove angle and welding voltage were found to be 1050 A, 27 cm/min, 40â and 34 V, respectively.\n\nRecycling of an electric arc furnace flue dust to obtain high grade ZnO.\n\nPubMed\n\nRuiz, Oscar; Clemente, Carmen; Alonso, Manuel; Alguacil, Francisco Jose\n\n2007-03-06\n\nThe production of steel in electric arc furnace (EAF) generates a by-product called EAF dusts. These steelmaking flue dusts are classified in most industrialized countries as hazardous residues because the heavy metals contained in them, tend to leach under slightly acidic rainfall conditions. However, and at the same time they contain zinc species which can be used as a source to obtain valuable by-products. The present investigation shows results on the processing of an EAF flue dust using ammonium carbonate solutions. Once zinc is dissolved: ZnO + 4NH3 + H2O --> Zn(NH3)4(2+) + 2OH- with other impurities (i.e. cadmium and copper), these are eliminated from the zinc solution via cementation with metallic zinc. The purified zinc solution was evaporated (distilled) until precipitation of a zinc carbonate species, which then was calcined to yield a zinc oxide of a high grade. For the unattacked dust residue from the leaching operation, mainly composed of zinc ferrite, several options can be considered: back-recycling to the furnace, further treatment by sodium hydroxide processing or a more safely dumping due to its relatively inertness.\n\nMethod and Mechanisms of Soil Stabilization Using Electric Arc Furnace Dust\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAl-Amoudi, Omar S.

The soil-cement-EAFD mixtures were used to determine their unconfined compressive strength (UCS), soaked California Bearing Ratio (CBR) and durability. The risk of leaching of toxic heavy metals, such as lead and cadmium, from the stabilized soils to the groundwater was also investigated. The mechanisms of stabilization of the selected soils due to the use of EAFD along with a small quantity of cement are also elucidated. The usage of 20 to 30% EAFD with 2% cement was noted to considerably improve the mechanical properties and durability of both marl and sand.

K.; Logsdon, W. A.; Begley, J. A.\n\n1989-10-01\n\nThe fatigue crack growth rate (FCGR) properties of SA508 C1 2a and SA533 Gr A C1 2 pressure vessel steels and the corresponding automatic submerged are weldments were developed in a high-temperature pressurized water (HPW) environment at 288 Â°C (550Â°F) and 7.2 MPa (1044 psi) at load ratios of 0.02 and 0.50. The HPW enviromment FCGR properties of these pressure vessel steels and submerged arc weldments were generally conservative, compared with the approrpriate American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Section XI water environmental reference curve. The growth rate of fatigue cracks in the base materials, however, was considerably faster in the HPW environment than in a corresponding 288Â°C (550Â°F) base line air environment. The growth rate of fatigue cracks in the two submerged are weldments was also accelerated in the HPW environment but to a significantly lesser degree than that demonstrated by the corresponding base materials. In the air environment, fatigue striations were observed, independent of material and load ratio, while in the HPW environment, some intergranular facets were present.

The tests were carried out in a laboratory arc-resistance electric furnace. The obtained results showed that the fibrous structure of asbestos contained in cement-asbestos waste was completely destroyed. This led to the formation of new mineral phases without dangerous properties. The melting test was conducted on raw cement-asbestos samples without any additives and with a content of mineral compounds, the aim of which was to support the melting process. The additives were selected among others on the basis of the computer simulation results carried out using FactSage database computing system. The research results indicate that the melting process of asbestos wastes is a potential and interesting method of neutralizing hazardous asbestos waste, which allows for further treatment and material recycling.

Due to its energy intensive operation, the EAF process has always been subject to optimization efforts. For these reasons, several models have been proposed in literature to analyze and predict different modes of operation. Most of these models focused on the processes inside the vessel itself. The present paper introduces a dynamic, physics-based model of a complete EAF plant which consists of the four subsystems vessel, electric system, electrode regulation, and off-gas system. Furthermore the solid phase is not treated to be homogenous but a simple spatial discretization is employed. Hence it is possible to simulate the energy input by electric arcs and fossil fuel burners depending on the state of the melting progress. The model is implemented in object-oriented, equation-based language Modelica. The simulation results are compared to literature data.\n\n5. Photocopied August 1978.

The objective of this study was to identify most suitable mathematical model in description of adsorption by using traditional batch experiment and to investigate the effect on Phosphorus removal efficiency and Phosphorus removal capacity by EAFS adsorption through variation of parameters such as pH, size of slag and initial concentration of Phosphorus. Result demonstrated that, Langmuir is suitable in describing Phosphorus removal mechanisms with the Maximum Adsorption Capacity, Q m of 0.166 mg/g and Langmuir Constant, KL of 0.03519 L/mg. As for effect studies, smaller size of adsorbent shows higher percentage (up to 37.8%) of Phosphorus removal compared to the larger size. Besides that, the experiment indicated a more acidic environment is favourable for Phosphorus removal and the amount of Phosphorus adsorbed at pH 3.0 was the highest. In addition, the adsorption capacity increases steadily as the initial Phosphorus concentration increases but it remained steady at 100mg P/L. Eventually, this study serves as better understanding on preliminary studies of P removal mechanisms by EAFS.\n\nStructural ceramics containing electric arc furnace dust.\n\nPubMed\n\nStathopoulos, V N; Papandreou, A; Kanellopoulou, D; Stournaras, C J\n\n2013-11-15\n\nIn the present work the stabilization of electric arc furnace dust EAFD waste in structural clay ceramics was investigated. EAFD was collected over eleven production days. The collected waste was characterized for its chemical composition by Flame Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. By powder XRD the crystal structure was studied while the fineness of the material was determined by a laser particle size analyzer. The environmental characterization was carried out by testing the dust according to EN12457 standard. Zn, Pb and Cd were leaching from the sample in significant amounts. The objective of this study is to investigate the stabilization properties of EAFD/clay ceramic structures and the potential of EAFD utilization into structural ceramics production (blocks). Mixtures of clay with 2.5% and 5% EAFD content were studied by TG/DTA, XRD, SEM, EN12457 standard leaching and mechanical properties as a function of firing temperature at 850, 900 and 950 Â°C. All laboratory facilities maintained 20 Â± 1 Â°C. Consequently, a pilot-scale experiment was conducted with an addition of 2.5% and 5% EAFD to the extrusion mixture for the production of blocks. During blocks manufacturing, the firing step reached 950 Â°C in a tunnel kiln. Laboratory heating/cooling gradients were similar to pilot scale production firing. The as produced blocks were then subjected to quality control tests, i.e. dimensions according to EN772-17, water absorbance according to EN772-6, and compressive strength according to EN772-1 standard, in laboratory facilities certified under EN17025. The data obtained showed that the incorporation of EAFD resulted in an increase of mechanical strength. Moreover, leaching tests performed according to the Europeans standards on the EAFD-block samples showed that the quantities of heavy metals leached from crushed blocks were within the regulatory limits. Thus the EAFD-blocks can be regarded as material of no environmental concern.

A.; Nasuha, N.; Alrozi, R.\n\n2018-06-01\n\nSulphated electric arc furnace slag (S-EAFS) was obtained through a facile chemical and thermal treatment method. The S-EAFS was evaluated as a Fenton-like catalyst for the oxidative degradation of reactive black 5 (RB5). The S-EAFS was characterized by XRD, SEM-EDX and nitrogen adsorption analysis. The highest RB5 degradation efficiency obtained in this study was above 90% which was maintained across seven successive cycles with minimum iron leaching. This was achieved at a RB5 concentration of 0.15 gL-1 (50 ppm) with 8 mM of H2O2 and a pH of 4.5. Characterization revealed that the presence of sulphated groups (SO4 2-) within the EAFS improved the surface acidity of the material and corresponded to an increase in the catalytic activity for the degradation of RB5 at mild pH.\n\nMechanical Characteristics of Submerged Arc Weldment in API Gas Pipeline Steel of Grade X65\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHashemi, S.

This steel is produced by thermo mechanical control rolled (TMC), and is largely used in Iran gas piping systems and networks. The results from laboratory study on three different regions; i.e. base metal (BM), fusion zone (FZ) and heat affected zone (HAZ) were used to compare weldment mechanical characteristics with those specified by API 5L (revision 2004) standard code. Different laboratory experiments were conducted on test specimens taken from 48 inch outside diameter and 14.3 mm wallmoreÂ Â» thickness gas pipeline. The test results showed a gradient of microstructure and Vickers hardness data from the centerline of FZ towards the unaffected MB.

The microstructure and property of welded joint are closely related to the thermal field of FAB-SAW process. In this research, the feature of thermal field for single-wire FAB-SAW was investigated. Based on the heat transfer mechanism, a three-dimensional transient model for thermal field was developed based on the influence of steel thickness, groove angle and ceramic backing. The temperature profile in single-wire FAB-SAW of D36 steel under different welding conditions was simulated by ANSYS. The characteristic of thermal field was analyzed and the influences of groove angle on temperature field for different plate thicknesses were discussed. The calculated geometries and dimensions of weld cross-section under different conditions show a good agreement with the experimental results. This newly built model can describe the thermal field accurately, which would be helpful to understanding the thermophysical mechanism of FAB-SAW and optimizing the welding process.\n\n40 CFR 63.1653 - Opacity standards.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2014 CFR\n\n2014-07-01\n\n...

Environmental problem such as pollution will occur when dumping the steel slag waste into the landfill. These steel slags have properties that are suitable for various applications such as water treatment and wastewater. The objective of this study is to develop efficient and economical chlorination route for EAFS extraction by using leaching process. Various parameters such as concentration of hydrochloric acid, particle size of steel slag, reaction time and reaction temperature are investigated to determine the optimum conditions. As a result, the dissolution rate can be determined by changing the parameters, such as concentration of hydrochloric acid, particle size of steel slag, reaction time and reaction temperature. The optimum conditions for dissolution rates for the leaching process is at 3.0 M hydrochloric acid, particle size of 1.18 mm, reaction time of 2.5 hour and the temperature of 90Â°C.\n\nThe efficiency of quartz addition on electric arc furnace (EAF) carbon steel slag stability.\n\nPubMed\n\nMombelli, D; Mapelli, C; Barella, S; Gruttadauria, A; Le Saout, G; Garcia-Diaz, E\n\n2014-08-30\n\nElectric arc furnace slag (EAF) has the potential to be re-utilized as an alternative to stone material, however, only if it remains chemically stable on contact with water. The presence of hydraulic phases such as larnite (2CaO SiO2) could cause dangerous elements to be released into the environment, i.e. Ba, V, Cr. Chemical treatment appears to be the only way to guarantee a completely stable structure, especially for long-term applications. This study presents the efficiency of silica addition during the deslagging period. Microstructural characterization of modified slag was performed by SEM and XRD analysis. Elution tests were performed according to the EN 12457-2 standard, with the addition of silica and without, and the obtained results were compared. These results demonstrate the efficiency of the inertization process: the added silica induces the formation of gehlenite, which, even in caustic environments, does not exhibit hydraulic behaviour.
