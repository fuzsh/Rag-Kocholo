One o f the few certainties at this time is the reappearance of a nationalist movement firmly believing that Russia can only be saved by a strong, authoritarian government that restores law and order and pursues a con­ servative policy. The present book deals with the origins o f this movement, its strengths, its inner contradictions, and its likely consequences for Russia and the world. Russian politics, generally speaking, have become more “ national,” and this trend is bound to continue. It is the inevitable consequence o f the breakup of the old Soviet Union. Many millions of Russians have found themselves outside the new Russia, and on the other hand, separatist groups inside Russia, such as the Tatars, insist on autonomy, if not full independence. If given free rein this tendency would put into question the survival o f the Russian Republic. These problems could perhaps be solved or at least eased and defused if moderation and common sense prevailed. But such attitudes are always in short supply at a time o f crisis, and since a strongly nationalist mood has prevailed among all the non-Russia repub­ lics and nationalities, the stage is set for a collision. The age of nationalist conflict that ended in Europe in 1945 has reopened in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. For many years students of Russia have focused their attention on the O n c e a g a in\n\nVW\n\nIN TR O D U C TIO N\n\nleft. There seemed to be good reason to do so: The right had been decisively defeated in 1917; the dissemination of right-wing ideas after this date was limited to small sectarian groups among the Russian and even smaller circles among Soviet dissenters. Politically they did not count; ideologically they had nothing of interest to offer. Why, in the circum­ stances, waste attention on the manifestos o f small groups o f eccentrics whose future prospects seemed nil? True, this impression was not entirely correct. Nationalism and rightwing ideas, even if submerged, were by no means entirely dead. Ever since Stalin had opted by necessity for “ socialism in one country,” the Soviet Union had become increasingly nationalist socialist. While communism claimed to be internationalist in inspiration, many observers realized that Russia had become as nationalist as it had been under the tsars. There had been some such prophets even in the early 1920s, mainly among the émigrés, who had predicted that the Soviet regime would become increas­ ingly nationalist and Russian-traditionalist and that the left-wing element would gradually wither away. This was the Smena Vekh (“ Change o f the Landmarks” ) group in Berlin and Paris; some of its leading members subsequently chose to return to Russia, where most of them perished. They had correcdy diagnosed a certain trend, but their timetable was mistaken. They were prophetic in some respects— and very wrong in others. The first article I wrote on Russian history was on the Smena Vekh phenomenon, which taught me that it is relatively easy to spot a new intellectual and political trend early on. But in the real world, some o f these trends never ripen, and, in any case, the ripening usually takes long, because there are always retarding factors. It took the greatest political earthquake of our time, the collapse of communism and the Soviet Union to enable the Russian right to make a comeback. As long as the Soviet regime existed, the most that a Russian nationalist could hope for was something akin to National Bolshevism— a movement that still has many followers even now: One should not under­ rate the strong Communist elements in the new Russian right. Only after the disintegration of official Soviet ideology could traditionally right-wing thoughts and slogans openly be propagated. It could be argued that the difference between official anti-Zionism before the age of reform, and present-day anti-Semitism is not enormous. Everyone knew that “ antiZionism” was a code word; its true meaning was clear to even the least sophisticated. Or, to give another example: “ Russophobia” has been o f late the great watchword o f the Russian right; but the concept did exist before 1987, under other names such as “ anti-Sovietism.” There is some truth in these arguments, but it is also correct that the official ideology could not\n\nIN TRO D U CTIO N\n\nIX\n\nbe frontally attacked before ¿jlasnost, and it would have been unthinkable to praise monarchism or the White armies o f the civil war. The breakdown o f Soviet communism caused an ideological as well as a political void, and nature abhors a vacuum in Russia even more than elsewhere. Some saw the breakdown o f the dictatorship as the great oppor­ tunity for the return of freedom to Russia, part o f a worldwide trend toward democratic institutions, the realization of the dream o f generations of the Russian intelligentsia. But the odds were heavily stacked against it. Democratic traditions have not been deeply rooted in Russian history. Furthermore, the breakdown of Soviet rule was bound to result in severe crises, political, social, and economic. Such periods are not conducive to the consolidation of democratic institutions. Thus, the right-wing-nationalist forces had a good chance in the struggle both for the soul o f Russia and for its political future. The present study deals with the Russian far right and the extreme nationalists. But aggressive chauvinism and xenophobia can be found in all the former Soviet republics. As a result, the prospects for democracy in most o f these republics cannot be rated high, even not in the most devel­ oped o f them, certainly not in the near future. The odds would have been better if a modus vivendi would have been found enabling the ex-republics to coexist and collaborate peacefully. But this was not to be, and as a result nationalist tensions have been exacerbated everywhere. If democracy should fail in Russia, the list of those responsible will be long, including both tsars and Communist rulers who failed to transform in time their empire into a commonwealth o f free nations. But the list o f gravediggers will also include the separatists who used their newly won freedom not for reconciliation and compromise but to turn against each other and against Russia, who almost overnight turned from oppressed to oppressors. Let us summarize the case o f the Russian nationalists. The right argues that a gradual, slower transformation o f the Soviet Union would have been greatly preferable. The price to be paid for dismantling the old system— the loss of all the non-Russian republics, including the Ukraine—was too high. Three centuries o f Russian history were undone in a few days in August 1991 as the result o f the weakness o f the center. To save the remnant, a spiritual as well as a political renaissance is needed, a return to the national and religious values o f the Russian people. It is poindess to embrace Western values and to copy Western insdtutions. Russia had always fol­ lowed a road o f its own; political systems that functioned elsewhere were unsuitable for Russia. So was parliamentary democracy—for, as Solzhenit­ syn has written, party rivalry distorted the national will. In this time o f troubles the country needed not only a strong leadership\n\nX\n\nINTRO D U CTIO N\n\nbut a set of national and religious beliefs that would sustain it through the hard years (or decades) ahead. These beliefs existed, they had only to be disinterred from underneath the rubble and brought again to the con­ sciousness of the people. The only alternative is nihilism, further decline, the descent to anarchy, perhaps the eventual disappearance o f the Russian people. This, in briefest oudine, is the case of the “ Russian party” against the “Westerners.” 1 It is agreed in, at least to a certain extent, by some liberals, who agree that nowhere (except perhaps after total defeat in war and military occupation) has a society ever transformed itself from a totalitarian system to a democracy. A transition period was needed in which a strong, authoritarian central power provided leadership. The worse the situation became, the more persuasive appeared the slogans o f the Russian party. But its case suffered from some basic weak­ nesses and inconsistencies. The Russian nationalists always argued that the former (Communist) regime had been one o f “ nationalist nihilism”— which was unfair to Stalin and his heirs, whose anticosmopolitan fervor had been second to none. The Communist regime had claimed, inter alia, that all important inventions had been made by Russians. Ever since the 1930s the traditional heroes o f Russian history, from Alexander Nevsky to the nineteenth-century generals, had been paid due reverence. Following the demise o f communism, Dmitri Donskoi, the hero o f the battle o f Kulikovo (1380), and Sergei of Radonezh, the priest who had blessed Dmitri and his soldiers on the eve o f the battle, also became national heroes. This was certainly a change in emphasis, but it did not amount to a spiritual revolu­ tion. The immediate difficulties facing Russia are largely economic and so­ cial. Yet nationalism pur sang does not have a specific economic and social doctrine. The Russian nationalists have been vocal insofar as their anticapi­ talist dislikes and complaints are concerned. But they have not offered specific alternatives other than some generalities concerning national inter­ est and national solidarity. Nationalism can still be a powerful force for the mobilization o f dissat­ isfied and disadvantaged elements, and o f all those whose patriotic senti­ ments were deeply offended and who believe that radical, possibly violent action has to be taken to save the fatherland. There is the time-honored Russian tendency toward radicalism and extremism, toward pursuing an idea or ideal relentlessly, well beyond the confines o f good sense. The1 1. “Westerners” is the incorrect term used by their political foes. Today’s Russian Westerners are not uncritical admirers of the West, nor were the zapadniki o f the nineteenth century.\n\nIN TRO D U CTIO N\n\nXI\n\nRussians did take socialism, a political doctrine that elsewhere led to social democracy and the welfare state, and turned it into a nightmare. There is the danger that nationalism, an explosive force at the best o f times, might fare similarly, fueled by hatred and selfishness and pursued at the expense of all other values, and become yet another monster. Communism and nationalism were always my main fields o f interest; in the 1960s my research into the ideological origins of Nazism led me to the Black Hundred and the Protocols o f the Elders o f Zion.2 The fact that I grew up under a totalitarian regime at a time when nationalist passions were running high in Europe helped me, I am inclined to believe, to understand other nationalisms. But it also led me to the conclusion that historical parallels are of limited validity only. Some Western and Russian writers have stressed the similarities between Russia’s present situation and the last years of the Weimar Republic, with the rise of the Nazi movement. There are some striking ideological similarities (about which more below), but there is also much that is totally different. The political constellation in postcom­ munist Russia is altogether different from the state o f affairs in Germany in 1932. At a time o f political polarization and radicalization in Russia, foreign­ ers writing about the Russian right are bound to be charged with “ Russophobia” unless they display uncritical support. This book has not been written in a polemical spirit. The presence of a right-wing extremist move­ ment in Russia should not be a particularly shocking discovery. Such parties exist in virtually every European country as well as in America and else­ where. It would have been a miracle if Russia alone among all nations were an exception. I am not a Russian, and Russians’ pain cannot be my pain. But I can understand their feelings in the face of the disaster and feel sympathy. I am sufficiendy familiar with things Russian to know that the history o f Russia is not only one of servitude, backwardness, and missed opportunities. There is much I admire in Russian culture, and much in the Russian people appeals to me. I am firmly convinced that the Russian people have deserved a better fate. There are ebbs and flows in the history o f nations, and it seems more likely than not that Russia will eventually recover from its present plight. I can well understand the resentment and humiliation felt by many Russians at this time of trial. It was probably inevitable that the old Soviet 2. Russia and Germany (New York, 1963 and New Brunswick, N .J., 1987; a Russian edition appeared in 1991).\n\nxii\n\nINTRO D U CTIO N\n\n(Russian) empire should have crumbled. But the way it did unravel was a disaster, which is bound to have dire consequences for a long time to come. To expect Russia to accept all the demands of the new republics, to give in to all separatist aspirations, oblivious of its own national interest, would involve a degree of self-abnegation without precedent in history. On these issues there cannot be radical differences o f opinion between Russian patriots of the “ left” and of the “ right.” There is no moral or historical law that commands peoples or societies to commit suicide. But patriotism is not a monopoly o f the right. In a famous article on the occasion of Konstantin Aksakov’s death, Alexander Herzen wrote: Yes, we were their opponents, but very strange ones. We had the same love but not the same way o f loving— and like Janus or the two-headed eagle, we looked in different directions, though the heart that beat within us was but one.\n\nIn that more civilized age, the conflict between Slavophiles and Westerners was an in-house quarrel among the Russian intelligentsia. To which side, in retrospect, did Peter I belong? He was the greatest Westemizer o f all but he also said that “we shall need Europe for a few decades; later we must turn our backs on it.” Cha’adayev wrote that he saw nothing in Russian history but barbarism and crude superstition— no enchanting memories, no edifying examples. But he was still not drummed out o f the ranks of Russian patriots for arrant Russophobia. Even his critics knew that he was not motivated by hate, but by love o f his country coupled with deep despair. They were even willing to understand, though not to forgive, an eccentric like Pecherin who left Russia, converted to Roman Catholicism, and wrote: “ How sweet it is to hate one’s native land and eagerly await its utter ruin.” True, the split deepened with the second generation of Slavo­ philes, “ men repelled by reality, escaping into historical fantasy.” Pogodin discovered that Russia was totally different from Europe in every respect, beginning with climate and physiognomy, and that it embodied all human achievements in one great synthesis and brought to harmony all civiliza­ tions, reconciling heart and reason. The idea o f the “ putrid West” spread— but then, after the victory o f the reactionary forces in 1849, not a few left-wing Westerners came to share it. I have referred to nineteenth-century “Westerners” and Slavophiles to put into perspective the attitude o f present-day rightwing nationalists to­ ward the Russian intelligentsia. As the right sees it, the democrats (or “ demofascists,” as they sometimes call them) do not have the same love of their country; they are intruders who hate Russia’s heritage, and their baneful influence has to be stamped out. If there is a historical paradigm, it is the attitude of the far right toward the German intellectuals in the last\n\nIN TRO D U CTIO N\n\nXUl\n\nyears of the Weimar Republic. They saw soulless materialism and spiritual decay wherever they looked. National values were openly undermined; crime and perverted sex were glorified. Rootless cosmopolitans derided all manifestations o f healthy patriotism. Such moral disintegration was no accident; it was a deliberate conspir­ acy by world Jewry to undermine everything that was still healthy so that the country could never recover and rise to greatness. While arguing that he represented the great majority, the intellectual o f the extreme right felt himself acutely isolated. The enemy was omnipresent, he dominated the scene, he always sat in the front row and awarded knighthoods o f the spirit and Europeanism. The enemy’s commodity was commended, whether it was the theory o f relativity or modem art, democracy or bolshevism, propaganda for abortion or against the legal system, rotten Negro music or dancing in the nude. In brief, there was never a more shameless dictator­ ship than that of the democratic intelligentsia.3* These lines were written in 1933 referring to Germany; they could have appeared, without changing a word, in yesterday’s Den or Russkii vestnik, expressing the views o f the Russian right. A time of deep spiritual and political crisis like the present in Russia taxes the mental equilibrium of people, and there is the danger o f taking refuge in all kind of fantasies— and worse. In a quieter age some prophets announced Russia’s historical mission to bring salvation to all mankind. Such a belief in the global mission of one’s nation and its superiority is not particularly dangerous unless supported by force o f arms, nor is it specifi­ cally Russian. A Frenchman wrote that everyone had two fatherlands, “ le sien et plus la France.” For decades German schoolchildren learned by heart the verse o f the poet Geibel u n d es m ag am deutschen Wesen einm al noch die W elt genesen.\n\nAddison wrote about the fundamental beliefs common to all true English­ men—that each one of them could beat three Frenchmen, that the River Thames was the noblest in Europe, and that there was no greater work of art than London Bridge. In Russia the belief in an eternal mission is not now on the historical agenda. But there is another aspect of the mentality o f the Russian far right that does constitute a threat, and this is its paranoid streak. I shall deal in the present book with various manifestations o f persecu3. F. Hussong, quoted in W. Laqueur, Weimar: A Cultural History (New York, 1974), chap­ ter 3, passim.\n\nXIV\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ntion mania and the belief in conspiracy theories. A relatively harmless one is the assumption that whenever a ruler died—from Ivan IV’s son Dmitri, to Alexander I, to Stalin— either there had been foul play or the ruler had not died in the first place but had been spirited away.4 The same is true, a fortiori, with regard to the death of the idols of the right. In a mild form such delusions are propagated in many countries by thriller writers, movie­ makers, and also the lunatic fringe. A certain part o f the public always has a weakness for stories based on plots and conspiracies; that is the lure of the detective story. In Russia this inclination has a time-honored history. One hundred years ago Vladimir Solovyov, the great Russian philosopher gave a nearly perfect description: Let us imagine a person [he wrote] healthy in body and strong, talented and not unkind— for such is, quite justly, the general view o f the Russian people. We know that this person (or people) is now in a very sorry state. If we want to help him, we have first to understand what is wrong with him. Thus we learn that he is not really mad, his mind is merely afflicted to a considerable extent by false ideas approaching folie degrandeur and a hostility toward everyone and everything. Indifferent to his real advantage, indifferent to damage likely to be caused, he imagines dangers that do not exist, and builds upon this the most absurd propositions. It seems to him that all his neighbors offend him, that they insufficiently bow to his greatness and in every way want to harm him. He accuses everyone in his family o f damaging and deserting him, o f crossing over to the enemy camp. He imagines that his neighbors want to under­ mine his house and even to launch an armed attack. Therefore he will spend enormous sums on the purchase o f guns, revolvers, and iron locks. If he has any time left, he will turn against his family. We shall not, o f course, give him money, even though we are eager to help him, but will try to persuade him that his ideas are wrong and unjustified. If he will still not be convinced and if he perseveres in his mania, neither money nor drugs will help.5\n\nSolovyov believed that the Russian people had the inner strength to cure themselves. But he also conceded that hallucinations had caused the ruin of nations. This uncannily accurate description o f the specific affliction o f the Russian extreme right was written exacdy one hundred years ago, well before the emergence of modern psychiatry. The general situation in Russia 4. One of my ancestors was among the doctors who signed the death certificate o f Alexander I in Taganrog in 1825. But a great many Russians still believed that the tsar had not died but went on to live as a hermit in the Urals. 5. VI. Solovyov, Sobrante sochineniya (St. Petersburg 1902—1907), vol. 5, pp. 430-31. This essay was written in 1892. Another intriguing feature of some contemporary groups o f the extreme right is the frequent preoccupation with pathological sexual practices, always attributed to their democratic enemies. While claiming to constitute the “ spiritual opposition” to the present ,decadent regime and upholding high moral standards, they obviously seem to enjoy these topics. For an illustration, see Russkii puls, 5 (1992).\n\nIN TRO D U CTIO N\n\nXV\n\nwas stable at the time; the Revolution o f 1905 had not yet occurred, the “ Black Hundred” had not appeared on the scene, the concept of Russophobia had not yet been invented. Yet there was even then a firm belief in imaginary conspiracies. This has been an essential part o f the mental makeup o f the extreme right ever since. If some were willing to accept manifesdy absurd ideas in a calm era, how much greater the danger o f a descent into collective madness at a time o f real disaster. This point has to be stressed because it will recur time and time again in the sections that follow. It does not imply that everyone on the right of the political spectrum shares these fantasies. Liberal, moderate nationalists dismiss them with contempt. How to draw the dividing line between the moderates and the extreme right? There is a simple rule of thumb. A basic difference exists between! those who seek the cause o f Russia’s misfortunes entirely in the machina­ tions and intrigues o f foreign and domestic enemies— and the others, who are willing to engage in introspection, self-criticism, and, where called for, penitence. It has been said earlier on that political paranoia is not a disorder confined to one country. It can be found virtually everywhere, more frequently (and more intensely) in some places than in others. And it has been more prevalent in Russian history than in other countries. Why has this been the case? Even if we knew much more about group dynamics, about what stimulates suspicion and rage, about the displacement o f anger and the projection o f guilt, we still would not have a satisfactory reply. Xenophobic hostility is as old as the hills. It can be found among populist movements and groups o f the extreme right in many countries, and it was one o f the prominent features o f Stalinism. But it is not quite the same as the phenomenon we have tried to describe— that o f fighters with chimeras and phantoms, a collective Don Quixote fighting with windmills, seeing everywhere outrageous giants, who nurse inveterate malice against our hero, who use pernicious wiles and stratagems. This Don Quixote is neither funny nor tragic; he is without any redeeming features, motivated only by hatred, a menace to himself and others. Psychopathology is o f some help in understanding phenomena such as Hitler and Stalin and their followers. But it is not the master key; there is an element o f evil outside the normal parameters o f mental health and disease. The same is true with regard to the fanatics of the Russian right; their main motivation is resentment and burning hatred, a “ hatred which leads to the extinction o f all values.” 6 To understand the depth o f these passions, perhaps nothing is more instructive than the contempt with which 6. The phrase is Ortega y Gasset’s, from Meditations on Quixote, 1914.\n\nXVI\n\nIN TRO D U CTIO N\n\nthe journals of the extreme right so frequently refer to the “ human values” allegedly common to all mankind. A few remarks about the structure of this book. The present-day “ Russian idea,” as interpreted by the extreme right, contains not very much that is essentially new. The mixture may be novel, not the ingredients. To trace its origins, it is necessary to go back into history. The first part o f the present book deals, therefore, with prerevolutionary doctrines that provide the inspiration and the background o f present-day ideologies. I have had to discuss Dostoyevsky, the Slavophiles, and the Orthodox church even though they are no more responsible for Pamyat than Fichte and Nietzsche were for Adolf Hitler. The ideological resemblance between the Black Hundred (and their émigré disciples) and present-day far-right-wing thought is much closer and it is discussed in detail. But a “ Russian party” evolved not only among the emigrants; there were also precursors inside the Soviet Union after the Second World War, and they cannot be ignored in this context. Later on I shall discuss present-day manifestations of far-right thought and practice. One argument will almost certainly be made in criticism of this study: Why concentrate on various fringe groups, thus creating the impression that all Russian patriots are chauvinists, villains, and madmen? This is misreading my intentions. Russian patriotism is as natural and legitimate as any other. My concern has been with the extremist views and their propo­ nents. Some of these groups are small sects, others are not. A political­ literary journal circulated in hundreds o f thousands o f copies is not a fringe phenomenon; there are now scores o f groups and publications o f this kind. The influence o f the extremists may not grow in the years to come; perhaps time does not work for them, as they believe. But there is a substantial reservoir of support for their ideas at a time o f grave crisis. It is foolish to ignore the possibility. The chances that a group such as Pamyat will ever come to power in Russia are nil. However, “ Black Hundredism” refers not just to a specific political group but to “ a matter o f morals and character which has deeper roots: It is rooted in the primordial darkness o f the Russian soul, its unenlightened deposits.” 7 The watershed is not between left and right, but between those who believe in freedom and humanistic values, in a state ruled by law, and those who reject these values with contempt. Semyon Frank, who wrote about the moral-political watershed between the first and second revolutions of 1917, predicted that at a time o f chaos, when society 7. S.

The same is true today. In the first section o f this book I had to go, by necessity, over ground familiar to experts. There are some fine studies on right-wing thought among Russian dissidents before ¿jlasnost ánd on national bolshevism. I benefited from them; they are mentioned in the bibliographical note at the end o f this book. On the contemporary extreme right, whose history begins with the Gorbachev era, there is no comprehensive work so far and I entered uncharted waters. I was most fortunate to have the support o f my colleague Valeri Solovei; as a result the problem that faced me was one of drowning, not o f drought. I refer to the abundance of printed material. Much o f this source material is exceedingly rare; for many o f the journals, not to mention the booklets and leaflets, students will look in vain even in specialized archives and collections. My debt to Mr. Solovei is very heavy indeed, and it is not limited to keeping me supplied with sources: He answered innumerable queries and provided a detailed critique o f my manuscript. Certain sections o f this book (notably the chapter on the nationalist establishment) are almost as much his as they are mine. How­ ever, the ultimate draft was written by me. I believe that while he agrees with many of my formulations, he does not necessarily accept all of them. Others who have given me the benefit o f their advice with regard to specific questions in the historical section are Josef Frank, Gregori Freeze, Abraham Ascher, Hans Rogger, Robert O tto, Mikhail Epstein, Leonard Stanton, and Michael Hagemeister. I always have difficulties with the transliteration since there is no unified system that makes sense to me; if there is some consistency in this book I owe it to the unrivaled expertise o f my neighbor Ken Katzner. Kari Ander­ son, the librarian at the Center for Strategic & International Studies, kindly helped to obtain some rare books by way o f various library loan schemes, and I also had the suppprt o f my friends Larissa and Frantisek Silnicki in the same context. I was helped by my assistants Aimee Breslow and Anne Truslow, and a litde group o f intelligent and industrious interns at CSIS— Sarah Despres, Marek Michalewski, Dimitri Osipov, Jon Kenny, and Nancy Oslo.\n\nBEFORE THE REVOLUTION\n\nTHE RUSSIAN IDEA AND MANIFEST DESTINV\n\n— has existed since time im­ memorial, whereas nationalism as a doctrine, a system o f values and beliefs, has its origins in the Romantic age. A Russian identity developed over many centuries; the early Russian literature, such as the Nestor Chronicle ( Povest vremennikh let), and the Tale o f Igor’s Campaigns are works sui generis, not imitations of another culture; so is early Russian painting, so were the teachings of the Russian church. Russians defended their land against the Teutonic Knights in the thirteenth century and, less successfully, against Mongols and Tatars in the centuries after. Ideology hardly played a role in all this. The famous pro­ nouncement of the monk Filofei of Pskov (a monastery) in a “ letter against the astronomers” that Mpscow was the “ third Rome” made only a limited impression on the rulers of the day and on public opinion, such as it was. It became only gradually, among some, an article of faith.1 A little later the same century the idea of “ Holy Russia” emerged. O f all European countries Russia was the most isolated. According to reports by countless travelers, political, cultural, and social developments in other parts of Europe had largely bypassed it. Radical change came with the advent of Peter I; his policies o f modernization and Westernization have1 P a t r i o t i s m — t h e l o v e o f o n e ’s h o m e l a n d\n\n1. For the history of the idea of Moscow as the third Rome, see Leon Poliakov, Moscou— Troisième Rome (Paris, 1989).\n\n4\n\nBEFORE\n\nTHE\n\nREVOLUTION\n\nbeen a bone of contention to this very day. From this date on, state and nation developed in Russia on different lines. National consciousness has always evolved in opposition to foreign influences, and Russia, quite naturally, was no exception. The Old Believers regarded Peter as an agent of Satan in view o f his reforms banning so many of the old customs and beliefs; being forced to cut their beards was only the ultimate indignity. But resentment was by no means restricted to the more backward classes. The political establishment was angry about the key role played by so many Germans at court, and in ruling the country as well as the army and the diplomatic service. Among the upper classes there was the fashion of imitating all things French, but this provoked a violent reaction among some patriots. Many Russians resented that the history o f their country was written— often in a detached and unpatriotic spirit— by Germans, that in their new Academy of Sciences foreigners dominated. Thus, in deliberate opposition to alien influences, a Russian school o f literature developed, mainly in the theater, and the first Russian histories were written. Their authors were well-meaning men o f no great talent, nor could they base themselves on rich and unbroken national traditions, as the French or the British and the Germans could. Thus, the patriotic playwrights were quickly forgotten. But the underlying sentiment—that the Russian people could make an impor­ tant cultural contribution o f their own— persisted, and there were even claims that “we are better and greater people than the Germans.” Fonvizin (himself, as his name indicates, a Russian o f recent origin) wrote that the Russians had more feeling, more heart, a greater capacity for love than most foreigners.2 On what evidence were such claims based? Partly on instinct, partly on the newly awakened interest in the Russian language, in the folk and folklore, in the habits, the sayings, and the songs o f the people. Thus, the search for a national character got under way well before the Romantic age, as it did in Germany under the influence o f Herder. This new spirit found its most eloquent expression in the writings o f Nikolai Karamzin. While some of his contemporaries, such as Plavilshchikov went very far indeed in claiming that Russians were in almost every respect superior to all other peoples (“ The Russian is capable o f understanding everything.. . . Can any other people boast of such qualities?” ), Karamzin in his great history and his famous memoir on Ancient and Modem Russia recognized that these were myths— but successful myths. Peter’s predecessors had never lost the 2. Hans Rogger, National Consciousness in Eighteenth-Century Russia (Cambridge, Mass, 1960), p. 83.\n\nTHE\n\nRUSSIAN\n\nIDEA AND\n\nM ANIFEST\n\nDESTINY\n\n5\n\nconviction that an Orthodox Russian was the most perfect citizen and Holy Russia the foremost state in the world. It was a delusion, but it greatly contributed to strengthening patriotism and the moral fiber of the country. The Petrine reforms, as Karamzin saw the matter, had deprived Russia of its Russianness and destroyed the unity o f the nation. Peter had not realized that the national spirit constituted the moral strength o f the people. Still, he had not succeeded altogether; the Russian spirit had not been eradicated and thus there was great hope for a national revival. After Karamzin, nationalism became part o f the official doctrine o f the Russian state, but his writings also influenced the Slavophiles. Bureaucratic, conservative nationalism was the prevailing fashion at the beginning and again at the end o f the nineteenth century, whereas the middle was domi­ nated by the Slavophiles. The conservative, bureaucratic nationalists be­ lieved in slow, gradual, organic development. But since they took a pessi­ mistic view o f human nature and o f the Russian people in general, they wanted as little development as possible. The bureaucratic nationalists took a dim view o f the producers o f panegyrics on the unspoiled national character, the purity and virtue of the Russian peasant past and present. As far as they were concerned the common people could not be trusted unless they obeyed God and the tsar. Love for the fatherland was fine, but autocracy was absolutely essential. Russians had to be protected from foreign (European) influences, not so much because they were foreign, but because they undermined belief in religion and the monarchy. Thus the famous formula o f “Autocracy, Orthodoxy, and Narodnosf’ came into being, and it was surely no coincidence that narodnost came last in this list and was the most ambiguous o f the three pillars o f the regime. These bureaucratic nationalists were not cynics who believed, without personally sharing these sentiments, that nationalism (like religion) was good for the people. They were realists, and there was therefore little room for messianism and dreams in their view o f the world. Many o f them (including Konstantin Pobedonostsev, the procurator o f the Holy Synod) admired England, but they also knew that the average Russian was less mature, less law-abiding than the average Briton, and that an English-style political system was therefore quite unsuitable for Russia and would be for a long time to come. The firm belief that the Russian people was not interested in politics was shared by democratic Slavophiles like Ivan Aksakov, in whose thought “ the people” was as important as the tsar. But Aksakov also believed that democracy had no place in Russia’s life and history. All the Russian people wanted was rural autonomy; they did not have the desire to govern.\n\n6\n\nBEFORE\n\nTHE\n\nREVOLUTION\n\nAt the same time Aksakov was a firm believer in the freedom of expression, and this was bound to bring him into conflict with the bureau­ cratic nationalists, who were not even sure whether the Russian people could be trusted to read the Bible in Russian; they insisted therefore in keeping the religious services in Church Slavonic, which hardly anyone understood. Such a nationalism was perhaps closer to the real world than were the Romantic dreams o f the Slavophiles. But it was unlikely to generate much enthusiasm among the educated classes, let alone among the “ sons of the kitchen maids”— that is to say, the emerging intelligentsia. To generalize about Slavophilism is difficult and potentially misleading; its leading proponents were few but strongly individualist. There was no Slavophile manifesto or program or party line. They disagreed about the proper attitude toward other nations, about their appraisal o f Russia’s past and present, about the aims o f Russian foreign policy, about censorship, about the impact o f capitalism on Russia, about the role o f Peter I, and about a great many other topics. They were in broad agreement that the Russian people had a great future whereas the West was sinking, and that the West was up to no good as far as Russia was concerned; they were also convinced that over the past century and more, the Russian state had become too strong, whereas the people (and above all, the peasants) had been suppressed. While they were not fighting for greater political liberty, they thought there was not enough social justice and spiritual freedom. This brought them into occasional conflict with the authorities; a few of them were detained for short periods, and they had frequent disagreements with censors. Some Slavophiles were (or became) conservatives or even reactionaries pur sang, but others did not. While Slavophilism had strong political overtones, it was not primarily a political but a cultural movement; Slavophiles regarded Russia as a religious and metaphysical rather than a political problem. In the writings o f the leading Slavophiles one can find arguments for and against the important questions o f the day and this explains, at least in part, why the debate about the historical role of Slavophilism continues to this day and, for all one knows, may go on for a long time. The Slavophiles were highly educated people; most o f them knew Europe well— better, in fact, than some contemporary Russian democrats such as, for instance, Nikolai Chemychevsky. They were steeped in French and German culture; the poet and diplomat Fyodor Tyutchev wrote in a famous poem that Russia’s boundaries extended from the Nile to the Neva, from the Elbe to China, from the Volga to the Euphrates, from the Ganges to the Danube. But at home he spoke French more often than Russian, and most o f his correspondence was not in Russian either. Konstantin Aksakov\n\nTHE\n\nRUSSIAN\n\nIDEA AND\n\nM ANIFEST\n\nDESTINY\n\n7\n\nwas the most single-minded Slavophile, the one most given to glorifying Russia’s past. His colleague Pogodin would agree with him— the Russian people were indeed marvelous, but only potentially. In reality they were at present quite horrid and beasdy. Slavophilism was, as the philosopher Njkolai Berdyaev once wrote, the first truly independent Russian ideology. But at the same time, at least among the first generation o f Slavophiles, the emphasis on religion was even stronger than on the nation; the philosopher Aleksei Khomyakov was primarily a religious rather than a national thinker. “Autocracy” for these Slavophiles was litde better than a necessary evil, and to “ purge” Slavophil­ ism o f its religious-messianic content (as some latter-day Russian national­ ists did) was to take away its very essence. Even the negative attitude o f the Slavophiles to the West (or rather to contemporary Western civilization) was predominandy religious in nature. They rejected the West first because Protestantism and, a fortiori, Catholi­ cism were inferior to Orthodoxy and second because the West had become materialist and atheist. Orthodoxy alone had preserved its spiritual purity, its organic values; the Russian people were Christian not only in their church service but in their way o f life. Therefore they had preserved their youth, whereas Europe was old, ill, and in a state o f advanced decay.3 There was a populist element in Slavophilism which made its exponents view the domestic policies o f the bureaucratic nationalists with grave fore­ bodings. It is perhaps exaggerated to regard them, as some latter-day historians did, as the precursors o f the narodnik (“ populist” ) movement. For Ivan Aksakov the idea o f a zemski sobor—that is to say, political reform by means o f popular representation and a constitution—was absolutely essential. Toward the end o f his life he regarded it as the last chance on the road to peaceful change in Russia and he wrote that Pobedonostsev and Katkov, the bureaucratic nationalists who opposed it, would ruin the country. In later years the surviving Slavophiles, and also the second generation, became preoccupied with questions o f foreign policy. This meant primarily support for the Southern Slavs in their struggle against the Ottoman Empire. There had never been sympathy for the Northern Slavs, notably the Poles, who belonged to the wrong religion and were considered ingrates in view o f their lack o f appreciation for the blessings o f Russian rule and their constant struggle for self-determination. But if the Slavophiles showed much patriotism during the Crimean war, so did Westerners such 3. The literature on the Slavophiles is enormous. The most recent authoritative work is A. Walicki, The Slavophile Controversy (Oxford, England, 1975).\n\n8\n\nBEFORE\n\nTHE\n\nREVOLUTION\n\nas Turgenev. In the First World War Pavel Milyukov, the great liberal critic of Slavophilism, was as ardent an advocate o f seizing Tsargrad (Constanti­ nople) as the Slavophiles. The Slavophiles supported Russian expansion in Central Asia, and some of their leaders came to believe that Germany and Austria were their main enemies in Europe. This was in contrast to their earlier conviction that they had most to fear from Catholic France, the main agent of revolutionary ferment in the West. Almost without exception the Slavophiles were firmly convinced (as Tyutchev wrote his sister) “ that there is no single trend in the West which would not conspire against Russia, especially against its future, and would not try to harm us.” Or Dos­ toyevsky: “ Europe has a remarkable dislike for us and has never liked us. She has never considered us as one o f her own . . . but only as vexatious newcomers.” The idea of Western Russophobia goes far back in history and it was one o f the chief motives o f Slavophilism— the suspicion that the West was plotting against Russia and holding it in contempt, openly or secredy. This was certainly unjust with regard to the German right, which throughout the nineteenth century thought o f the alliance with Russia as the base o f its foreign policy, and which, on an ideological level, always favored an an­ tirevolutionary alliance with tsarist autocracy. These issues are not of purely antiquarian interest, for they were to resurface in the thinking o f the Russian right toward the end o f the twentieth century. O f the latter-day Slavophiles, Konstantin Leontiev and Nikolai Dani­ levsky are usually mentioned in the same breath, though they had little in common. Both were scientists by training; Leontiev later on entered the diplomatic service and became passionately involved in religion. He spent a year in the famous M ount Athos monastery and eventually took vows and settled in a monastery near Moscow, where he died. He differed in many respects from the earlier Slavophiles; while sharing the fear that Russia would be infected by European decay he saw the answer in a harsh, autocratic regime, based on the Byzantine tradition and fervent religious faith. He had no time for idealizing either the Russian peasantry or the other Slav peoples. Leontiev was no nationalist in the customary sense, because national­ ism, as he saw it, was Western in inspiration, modernist, and even liberal— and thus in contradiction to the religious and autocratic Russian tradition. For the same reason he opposed the aggressive foreign policy o f the Slavophiles in the Balkans and the domestic Russification in the Baltic countries and elsewhere. As long as the ruling stratum in the Baltic prov­ inces had been loyal to the tsar, why compel them to conform as far as their language and culture were concerned?\n\nTHE\n\nRUSSIAN\n\nIDEA AND\n\nM ANIFEST\n\nDESTINY\n\n9\n\nLeontiev’s views were frequently dismissed as obscurantist by his fellow Slavophiles, but they were so obscurantist as to be almost modern. Toward the end of his life he seems to have reached the conclusion that since Western capitalism and liberalism had no future in Russia and since the Eastern Orthodox (Byzantine) civilization could not be revived either, the only future for Russia was in some form o f state socialism, which would provide the necessary measure o f discipline (and repression) without which the whole fabric o f society would come apart. Leontiev was a deeply pessimistic thinker; he thought the glorification o f Russia’s past a mere delusion and the dreams about Russia’s future a mere chimera. The best one could hope for was to preserve the status quo with all its imperfections. His literary and political views are interesting, often in contradiction to mainstream Slavophilism; he preferred Tolstoy to Dostoyevsky both as a writer and as a patriot. As a conservative he despised Slavophilism, because it was modernist, democratic, vulgar, and potentially dangerous. But Leon­ tiev’s influence in his lifetime was very limited; after his death his teachings were mainly o f interest to theologians and historians o f ideas.4* Danilevsky, on the other hand, was widely read and enthusiastically welcomed in his time; his magnum opus, Russia and Europe, was translated into various Western languages and reappeared, albeit in an abridged version, under glasnost. Like Dostoyevsky, Danilevsky began life as a politi­ cal radical, and in some ways he always remained one; he became the most eloquent spokesman of the believers in a Russian imperial mission. He has been compared with Spengler as well as with Stalin, but the grain o f truth in these parallels should not be exaggerated. Like Spengler he believed in the rise and decline o f civilizations; like Stalin he envisaged a totalitarian system o f sorts, but it was, o f course, quite remote from the practices of twentieth-century totalitarians. He was united with the Slavophiles in the belief in the decay of the West, the conviction that there would be a long and bloody struggle with Europe, out o f which Russia would emerge victorious, and also a certain populist agrarian socialism. H e was more modem in approach than most other Slavophiles; thus, he had no hesitation introducing to Russia Western advances in technologies and science. He was only opposed to copying alien cultural and political models— such as parliamentary democracy, the class struggle, Western plutocratic imperial­ ism—in contrast to the Russian tradition o f political and spiritual unity. His 4. But in the general renaissance of Slavophilism in the nineties Leontiev was not forgotten. In 1991, on the occasion o f the hundredth anniversary o f his death, articles about and by Leontiev were published by Nash Sovremennik, 12 (1991), in Russkii Vestnik, 31 (1991), and in other organs of the conservatives.\n\n10\n\nBEFORE\n\nTHE\n\nREVOLUTION\n\nadvocacy of expansion was motivated by a feeling o f a world-historical mission.5 The concept of a historical mission leads by necessity to Dostoyevsky, by far the most influential of the Slavophiles and also the most difficult to fathom. In the Russophile renaissance in the 1980s Dostoyevsky plays a crucial role, and his influence has by no means been restricted to the right. Besy (“ The Possessed” ), the great anti-utopian novel o f 1871 on the likely consequences of socialism, has been equally often invoked by the liberals. Western students of Dostoyevsky have been fascinated by his great novels and have endlessly commented on them. But they have never quite known what to make of his political journalism, specifically The Diary o f a Writer. In his political writings Dostoyevsky all too often appears a war­ monger, a rabid chauvinist, a blind supporter o f autocracy, a bitter hater of Poles, Jews, and foreigners in general. True, the more outrageous state­ ments are often accompanied by all kinds o f reservations—references to Russia’s pan-human mission, to the fraternal love o f mankind in general. But these did not always sound convincing even at their most tolerant, as in the famous speech on Pushkin’s anniversary (1880), when Dostoyevsky tried to bring about a reconciliation between Westerners and Slavophiles. Dostoyevsky’s ideas have been regarded by some Western commentators as little more than exalted rubbish, vague phrases that brought about unprecedented scenes o f emotional fraternization (as at the Pushkin festi­ val) but had no lasting effect whatsoever. It is tempting to regard Dostoyevsky’s political journalism as a tempo­ rary aberration, just as the journalistic efforts o f other great writers should not be taken too seriously. But it is useful to recall that this journalism was very influential at the time. In the words o f one o f his friends, Dostoyevsky’s fame was not caused by his prison sentence, not by The House o f the Dead, not even by his novels— at least not primarily by them— but by The Diary o f a Writer. It was the Diary that made his name known to all o f Russia, made him the teacher and idol o f youth, yes, and not only o f youth but o f all those tortured by the questions that Heine called “ accursed.” 6\n\nDostoyevsky’s nationalist thought developed through his association with the pochvenniki, the native-soil conservatives, sometimes in conso­ nance with, at other times in contradiction to mainstream Slavophilism. 5. Danilevsky’s book was banned after 1917, but an abridged version was republished in Moscow in 1991. 6. Elena Stakenshneider, F. M.

Religion, to give but one example, figured much less prominendy in Dostoyevsky’s thought in the 1860s than in later years. The pochvenniki (the very term was to reappear in the 1970s) were an andradonalist group o f believers in organic growth rather than in revolu­ tionary change. They were anticapitalist and felt that Russia’s innate sense o f fraternity guaranteed inner unity and social harmony.7 In this respect the Russian nation was an “ extraordinary phenomenon” (Dostoyevsky’s words), and its character did not resemble the character o f any other European people. One of Dostoyevsky’s ever recurring themes was that every people believed that the salvation o f mankind depended on it, that it existed in order to stand at the head of the peoples. It ceased to be a great people the moment it lost the belief that it alone was the repository o f truth. Dostoyevsky believed that the Russians were the only God-bearing people and would save the world—they were the body o f God. Only Orthodoxy had preserved the divine image o f Christ in all its purity, and it could therefore act as a guide for other peoples in a world that had lost its way. Unlike some o f the Slavophiles, the pochvenniki did not believe that the Petrine reforms had been an unmitigated disaster, nor did they claim that the educated classes had betrayed the common people, who had remained the only bearer o f the national traditions. With the pochvenniki and the Slavophiles, Dostoyevsky believed in the union o f the tsar with the people as the most effective bulwark against the bourgeois West which also made Russia virtually immune to revolutionary temptations. He predicted that all the great European powers would be destroyed because they would be undermined from within by the unsatis­ fied democratic aspirations of their lower classes. In Russia, on the other hand, this could not happen because the people were happy and were becoming even more so. as time passed by. Thus, only one colossus— Russia—would remain in Europe, and this might come to pass even much earlier than people thought. But at the same time there was Dostoyevsky’s great fear of revolution—which was, after all, what Besy— The Possessed— was all about. The inner contradictions in Dostoyevsky’s thinking are more striking than the consistency in his views. He frequently invoked the universal, all-embracing humanity o f the Russian people and maintained that true Russianness was the capacity to absorb all precious European values. But 7. Wayne Dowler, Dostoyevsky, Grigorev and Native Soil Conservatism (Toronto, 1982), p. 80.\n\n12\n\nBEFORE\n\nTHE\n\nREVOLUTION\n\nthe constant chauvinistic drumbeating, the calls to make war against the Turks and to conquer Constantinople, the attacks on the Catholic church were not in line with this humanitarian ideal. Dostoyevsky wrote in his notebook in 1863 that nationality was not the final goal o f mankind and that only in universal humanity could it lead a full and harmonious life. But this could be attained only through emphasis on the unique natsionalnost of every people. The universal human values were a distant ideal, and in the meantime it seemed permissible to go rather far in stressing national exclusivity (samobytnost) and attacking the enemies, real and imaginary, of the nation. Dostoyevsky’s anti-Semitism is of interest in this context. At times he denied it, and it could indeed be argued (as Joseph Frank has done) that Dostoyevsky hated Poles even more than he did Jews and that in any case anti-Semitism was a logical component o f his general xenophobia. (He hated and feared the kulaks as much as the “Yids.” ) But there still remains a riddle: The Poles, the Jesuits, the Turks were real antagonists and could perhaps be considered potential threats by watchful Russian patriots. But in the 1870s the Jews were neither among the leaders o f the Russian revolutionary movement, nor had they any significant influence on Russian social and cultural life, nor were they in the front rank o f politics or economic life. Very few Jews lived outside the Pale o f Settlement. It is not certain whether Dostoyevsky (or Ivan Aksakov, the most anti-Semitic of the Slavophiles) ever met a Jew in the flesh or talked to one; they certainly did not know any Jews well. There are no Jews among the leading characters in Dostoyevsky’s novels. Why should a weak, oppressed, and relatively small minority have provoked such fears and violent feelings, as bloodsuck­ ers and vampires? There is no obvious answer; perhaps the Jews were an abstraction or a potential competitor o f the Russians for the role of the Chosen People. But taken the real conditions in which the “ Chosen People” lived at the time it is not easy to be satisfied with an explanation of this kind. The same syndrome was to recur on the Russian right one hundred years later. At a time when ethnic Russians were persecuted and expelled from many parts of the Soviet Union, from Lithuania to Central Asia, from Moldova to the Caucasus, the spokesmen and thinkers o f the Russian right were preoccupied not with the real dangers facing their compatriots but with the single-minded concentration on “ Zionists,” many o f whom had no dearer wish than to leave Russia. Dostoyevsky’s views on religion have attracted several generations of thinkers, Russian and non-Russian; they have been o f interest to the existentialists and generally speaking to all those preoccupied with faith and\n\nTHE\n\nRUSSIAN\n\nIDEA AND\n\nM ANIFEST\n\nDESTINY\n\n13\n\nevil. Dostoyevsky has fascinated the contemporary right because o f his obiter dicta on foreigners, bourgeois, Westerners, socialists. Catholics, and Jews. But this cult is based, at least in part, on a misunderstanding and it is o f limited political efficacy. With all his doubts and self-torment, Dos­ toyevsky was essentially a religious writer, more occupied with sin and goodness, with faith, madness, and mystery, than with the future o f the Russian empire. Nor is the “ Russian idea,” as Dostoyevsky envisaged it, o f much use to the Russian right. True, it implies opposition to futile attempts to copy Europe, to live according to national principles developed by other peoples and alien to the Russian tradition. But it also meant that Russia’s worldhistorical role was “ pan-humanism,” a synthesis o f all the ideas developed by the West, reconciling otherwise antagonistic elements with an admixture of the Russian spirit. Dostoyevsky envisaged, in other words, a Westernism purified and raised to a higher level. Such ideas were far too complicated for the Russian right, just as Dostoyevsky’s all-pervasive insistence on Russia’s infinite capacity for harsh self-criticism was o f no political help to them. The Slavophiles had no lasting influence on the intelligentsia, which found it not even necessary to confront their ideas which they thought mere “ police religion.” The fact that the latter-day Slavophiles dropped many of their erstwhile radical ideas and moved closer to bureaucratic, state nationalism seemed to bear out the negative attitude o f the left. But the reception o f Slavophile ideas was not too friendly even among those close to them by background. The most famous early criticism came from Cha’adayev, Pushkin’s friend and mentor, with his stem warnings about the Slavophiles’ arrogant apotheosis o f the Russian people, who were in fact backward and self-isolated, lacking both past and future. At the end of Slavophilism there was Vladimir Solovyov, religious philosopher and poet, who bitterly criticized them for idealizing the Russian people. He attacked them for “ zoological patriotism,” for their gradual loss o f religious and humanist content, which had been replaced by national egoism. Com­ menting on Danilevsky’s Russia and Europe, he wrote: O ur nationalism desires to destroy Turkey and Austria, to divide Germany, to annex Constantinople and, should an opportunity arise, even India. If, however, we are asked what we have to offer mankind as compensation for what we take and destroy, what cultural and spiritual principles we have contributed to world history, then we must either be silent or indulge in meaningless phrases.\n\nBy the end o f the nineteenth century Slavophilism had faded away as an intellectual current. There were strong pan-Slavic feelings in the bureau-\n\n14\n\nBEFORE\n\nTHE\n\nREVOLUTION\n\ncracy and the army, and there were right-wing monarchist writers such as Menshikov and Lev Tikhomirov, who had begun their political career with the terrorists o f Narodnaya Volya. But it is difficult to think o f a Russian Maurice Barrés or Charles Maurras. Berdyaev wrote in 1907 that “ a conservative man of letters today is almost a contradiction in terms. . . . ” The nearest to a national revival on the philosophical level was the publication of Landmarks (Vekhi) in 1909. However, this volume was primarily concerned with the alienation (“ dissociation,” according to the vocabulary o f 1909) between the state and the people. It dealt only in passing with the intellectuals’ lack o f patriotism. There were some harsh words, notably by Sergei Bulgakov, about the cosmopolitanism of the Russian intelligentsia, the absence of healthy national feeling. But this was merely regarded as one component among several o f the intelligentsia’s isolation from the people; less important than the fact that the intelligentsia had spurned Christ and embraced atheism. The ideas of Russian nationalist thinkers throughout the nineteenth century are in most ways part o f a worldwide phenomenon that began with political Romanticism. It was more marked in Germany than in France and Britain, because Germany was a latecomer among nations and felt a greater urge to prove to itself and others that it had a major contribution to make to world civilization. For Britain and France such a role was self-evident; Italy became nationalist after the turn o f the century but set itself more modest aims prior to the advent o f fascism. America, too, had its propo­ nents of Manifest Destiny. If an extreme nationalist doctrine emerged in France toward the end o f the century, this was probably a reaction to a lost war and the ensuing mood of defeatism. The pan-German leagues and similar groups were a specific manifestation o f the Zeitgeist and also were rooted in the feeling that, alone among the great powers, Germany had neither an empire comparable to Britain’s and France’s (or even Belgium’s and Holland’s) nor enough lebensraum in Europe. The specific ingredient o f the Russian idea was its religious content. The extreme nationalists in Germany and France would invoke the support o f the deity, but more often than not stood in opposition to the church. In Russia, on the other hand, even extreme nationalism, as will be shown presendy, developed largely under the umbrella o f the church and with the blessings o f the monarchy. How to explain the relative weakness o f the “ Russian idea” among the intelligentsia? To ask the question is to answer it: If the Russian intelli­ gentsia was in opposition to the existing order, that was not because the educated classes were innately more negative, destructive, antipatriotic than in other countries; in hours of danger they would still rally around the flag.\n\nTHE RUSSIAN IDEA AND MANIFEST DESTINY\n\n15\n\nIt was mainly rooted in the incapacity o f the Russian political establishment to effect political and social change, in its reluctance to surrender any o f its privileges, to broaden its base, and to integrate the intelligentsia. Thus, government and opposition became ever more polarized. The Russian armies did fight for three years in the First World War, despite heavy losses. But eventually the breaking point was reached, and this led to the downfall o f the system. Such a disaster could not possibly have occurred by accident. To this extent the Russian right was quite correct in its assessment. But it could not accept the obvious—that the debacle had been predominandy the responsibility o f the tsar, his ministers, the whole state apparatus, and their policies over many years, which had Russia involved in a war for which it was not prepared and that it could not win. And so the search got under way, as it did in defeated Germany one year later, for the “ sinister forces,” the “ hidden hand,” that had adminis­ tered the “ stab in the back” that had led to the catastrophe.\n\nTHE BLOCH HUNDRED AND THE EMERGENCE OF THE RUSSIAN RIGHT\n\nA R u s s i a n c o n s e r v a t i v e - n a t i o n a l i s t p a r t y in Russia emerged only around the turn o f the last century. The reasons seem obvious: In an autocratically ruled state there were no political parties. The government traditionally argued that it had a monopoly of political acdon and looked with suspicion on independent activities, which were considered divisive and were, as a result, discouraged or even banned by the authorities.1There were nevertheless a few such attempts on a small scale, such as the “ Holy Brotherhood” of the early 1880s. But they did not amount to much and were considered, rightly or wrongly, as mere manifestations o f “ police patriotism.” This changed only with the appearance o f the “ Black H un­ dred” at the time of tsarism’s acute crisis in 1904—1905. The Black Hundred are a unique phenomenon in the history o f twen­ tieth-century politics. Like the Action Française, it was a halfway house between the old-fashioned reactionary movements o f the nineteenth cen­ tury and the right-wing populist (fascist) parties o f the twentieth. With their strong ties to monarchy and church they largely belonged to the past, but unlike the earlier conservative groups they were no longer elitist. Having understood the crucial importance of mobilizing the masses, they were the harbingers of political parties of a new type. One of the most influential1* 1. Hans Rogger, “The Formation of the Russian Right 1906-1909,” in Californian Slavic Studies, vol. 3, (1964), p. 66fF.\n\nTHE BLACK HUNDRED\n\n17\n\nleaders o f the movement wrote years later that in spirit this Russian move­ ment was almost similar to national socialism.2 However, the Black Hundred are by no means o f historical interest only. Their message was not forgotten among Russian right-wing émigrés after 1917, and when, under Gorbachev, freedom o f political expression returned to Russia, the Black Hundred were among the first to benefit from glasnost.3 The message that Russia could be saved only by the formation o f an organization on the lines o f the Union o f Russian People (“ SRN,” to use its Russian initials) was voiced after 1987 often and on various levels o f political sophistication.4 Black Hundred is a somewhat vague catchall term for various extreme right-wing groups that existed between, roughly speaking, the turn o f the century and 1917. Even before that there had been influential writers— such as V. A. Gringmut, Pavel Bulatsel, Mikhail Menshikov, and Sergei Sharapov—who had bitterly attacked not only the rising tide o f revolution but liberalism and capitalism, the disloyal minorities, such as the Poles, the Finns, the Baltic Germans, and above all the Jews. The names o f these publicists had been wholly forgotten during the Soviet period, except perhaps by a few specialists in the history o f late tsarism. No one bothered to discuss or refute them. After 1987 most of them were rediscovered by a new generation o f writers on the extreme right.5 True, they by no means constituted a common front. Thus, to give but one example, Sharapov, who was strongly anti-German, openly accused Menshikov o f being an Austrian agent. Menshikov is o f interest in this context because he was the first to preach racial anti-Semitism, in contrast to the earlier, mainly religious species.6 As he saw it, the race problem was the most crucial facing Russia 2.

At the same time, a highbrow spokesman for the extreme right, Vadim Kozhinov, expressed support (Moskovskaya pravda, October 4, 1991); earlier on, the Black Hundred label had been generally rejected by the right, because it had acquired a negative connotation over time. 5.

His ideas were mainly derived from Houston Stewart Chamberlain, whom he frequently quoted. There was the usual problem: While Chamberlain was a racist, he did not think highly of the non-Germanic races. . . .\n\n18\n\nBEFORE THE REVOLUTION\n\nat the time. He seems not to have been quite aware of the implications of his message. For to preach racial exclusivity in a multinational empire was, at the very least, asking for serious trouble. The first major organized group to emerge from among these far-right circles was the Russkoye Sobranie (“ Russian Association” ) which came into being in late 1900 and was initially wholly preoccupied with Russian history and art, but gradually became politicized. Among its leaders were well-known members of the aristocracy such as Princes Golitsyn, Apraksin, and Shakhovskoi, as well as bishops such as Serafim, university professors, and publicists, as well as a sprinkling of generals and high government officials. Russkoye Sobranie opened branches in the following years in major cities, mainly in southern Russia but also in Warsaw and Kazan. It was relatively weakly represented in the universities and had few followers among students. Nor was it strong among the middle class; most landown­ ers had not much interest in it, either. When in October 1905 a tsarist manifesto gave the country a measure o f political freedom, Russkoye Sobra­ nie appeared in public with a political manifesto that expressed fervent belief in monarchy and church and demanded special anti-Jewish laws “ in view of the Jewish hostility to Christianity and the non-Jewish nationals as well as their [Jews’] aspirations to world power.” Such an elitist group of like-minded personalities, well known and well connected in society, seemed quite powerless to stem the rising revolution­ ary tide; it ought to be recalled that these were the years o f the RussoJapanese War and the first Russian revolution. The country became more and more polarized, and on the right there was much fear that the whole system would collapse. Hence a greater readiness to support all kinds of extreme right-wing ideas and groups that had been rejected in the past. In this critical period two new parties were founded, first the Union of Russian People (“ Lyudei” ) in March 1906, and in October o f that year the Soyuz Russkovo Naroda (or SRN). They were almost identical in the composition of their leadership, except that the leadership o f the SRN from the beginning was in the hands o f a man who had not been politically active earlier on, the physician Dubrovin, who showed greater energy and tactical flair than any of his precursors. He established direct contact with top government and administrative figures, explaining that the old system could be saved only by a patriotic mass movement; that for this purpose both financial resources and political and police support were needed; and that his movement would engage in both mass action and individual terrorism. These proposals met with the approval o f certain key members o f the bureaucracy and the extreme right-wingers among the ministers. The tsar himself gave the SRN (to whom he had been introduced by Grand\n\nTHE BLACK HUNDRED\n\n19\n\nDuke Nikolai Nikolayevich) his blessing; he had quite independently reached the conclusion that international Jewry, through its two wings, Jewish capitalism and Jewish socialism— the Marx-Rothschild alliance— was fomenting revolution aiming to overthrow his regime. This campaign, he knew, was orchestrated by the Alliance Israelite Universelle, and its immediate aim was the introduction o f universal, equal, direct and secret suffrage, which would by necessity lead to revolution. The tsar was bitterly disappointed with the helplessness and inactivity of the other right-wing organizations; hence his sympathy for the SRN. As Georges Louis, the French ambassador to Russia, was later to write: “ The Black Hundred are ruling the country and the government obeys them because it knows the emperor is inclined to sympathize with them .” Orders were given to print the SRN’s appeals for pogroms on the state printing presses, and millions o f rubles were passed on to the group. In late 1905 Dubrovin began to mobilize mass support through sympathizers in the clergy and in patriotic organizations as well as the police and local adminis­ trations. This proved to be easier than could have been expected; the message of the SRN fell on fertile ground. Where did the SRN find its political and social base?7 The term “ Okhotny Ryad” has ffequendy been used by contemporaries to define the state o f mind that helped to spread the message o f the Black Hundred. Okhotny Ryad is a well-known quarter in the center o f Moscow which later housed Gosplan, the unfortunate Soviet state planning authority. The historical Okhotny Ryad totally disappeared in the Communist period; at the turn o f the century it housed Moscow’s game and meat market. It was inhabited by owners o f small shops, usually first-generation Muscovites, rough and not well educated, who had arrived from their villages to make the most of the opportunities there. At the same time they were bewildered and afraid because of the pace o f social change and the rapid economic ups and downs. They were- staunch believers in monarchy and church; they tended to hate the intelligentsia and the non-Russian minorities because 7. The history of the SRN has not yet been written. Hans Rogger’s essays on the subject are of importance; H. D. Löwe, Antisemitismus und reaktionäre Utopie (Hamburg, 1978), con­ tains interesting material. There are doctoral dissertations by Robert Edelmann (Columbia University, 1974) and Don Rawson (University of Washington, 1971). Most of the material in Russian can be found only in contemporary newspapers and periodicals. A first serious attempt of analysis was V. Levitsky, “ Pravya Partii,” in L. Martov et al., Obsbeshvennie dvizhenie (St. Petersburg, 1913), vol. 3. U nder glasnost many documents concerning the program of the SRN have been reprinted, as well as a brief history by V. Osetrov, Chernaya sotnya i krasnaya sotnya (Moscow, 1991). A million copies of this wholly laudatory booklet were printed by the military publishing house in 1990. A more detailed book by the same writer had been announced but publication was delayed following a lawsuit on the grounds of racial incitement.\n\n20\n\nBEFORE THE REVOLUTION\n\nthese were disturbing the peace and the social equilibrium. To say that this was the lower lower middle class would be correct, but would also be to say very little, for Okhotny Ryad was more o f a mindset than a social category. At the same time, the SRN (like its predecessors) counted among its members leading representatives o f the aristocracy; in addition to those already mentioned one comes across the names Urussov, Meshshersky, Sheremetev, and Gagarin, all well-known aristocrats. From among the higher clergy, bishops Hermogen of Saratov and Antony o f Volhynia should be mentioned. There were a few academics and intellectuals, such as the well-known historian Ilovaisky, and A. A. Maikov, the son o f the famous poet.8 Comparing the Action Française with the Black Hundred, one finds distinct differences; the former had its mainstay among the upper middle class and the universities, whereas the latter was a curious mixture o f the aristocracy, the more backward sections o f the petite bourgeoisie, and the flotsam and jetsam o f the big cities. Generalizations about the Black H un­ dred are difficult because conditions and membership varied from region to region. At the height o f its influence, in 1906-1907, it had some three thousand branches. It was stronger in southern Russia than in other parts o f the country. Membership was more or less uncontrolled: Anyone paying a fifty-kopek annual fee could join. (Only Jews could not, even if they had converted.9) Some members o f the Black Hundred were perhaps highminded idealists who had joined the movement because they saw their ideals and values threatened by the onslaught of dangerous and destructive revolutionaries. But the public image of the organization was not that o f a group o f unselfish idealists. Count Witte, the former prime minister, wrote in his memoirs that “ the Union was a body made up o f plain thieves and hooligans” : “ The aims of the Black Hundred are usually selfish and o f the lowest character. Their stomachs and pockets dictate their aspirations. They are typical murderers from the dark alleys.” O f their leaders he wrote: “ Decent people do not shake their hands and avoid their society.” Witte was one of the main bugbears o f the Black Hundred, and they had planned to assassinate him. In contrast, Stolypin, who could not possibly be sus­ pected o f liberal aberrations, was a hero o f the right. However, he too gave orders to the Odessa local administration to disarm and disband most of the Black Hundred units. The most recent Black Hundred historian com8. He was the author of a pamphlet, Revoliutsionery i chemosotentsy (St. Petersburg, 1907). 9. According to paragraph 15 of the constitution of the SRN. Ostretsov, p. 30.\n\nTHE BLACK HUNDRED\n\n21\n\nplains that even after Stolypin the ministry continued to withhold its regular subsidies from the Black Hundred and that the commander o f the Odessa M ilita ry District “ persecuted” these patriots in 1916-1917; the governors of Astrakhan and Irkutsk and other high officials are reported to have behaved in a similar unpatriotic fashion.10 The Black Hundred were not unduly bothered by receiving financial support from the government; if the revolutionaries were financed by world capitalism, it was only natural that the patriotic forces should ask for the assistance o f their own government. Since most o f the generals and governors reluctant to help the SRN were neither liberals nor radicals, what was the reason for their lack of enthusiasm? In some places the criminal element seems to have prevailed among the Black Hundred. Very few officials were inclined to take extreme measures against a short, sharp pogrom putting Jews and left-wingers in their place. But if these pogroms got out of hand, if they turned into the plundering o f shops, if general order was affected, the authorities could not tolerate it. Odessa was a prime example, for the local Black Hundred had established a reign of terror that lasted for almost two years and that affected industry, trade, and life in general. The Black Hundred have entered history mainly as the perpetrators of the anti-Jèwish pogroms o f 1905-1906. The pogroms got under way in late October 1905, as counterdemonstrations against celebrations by leftwing organizations hailing the tsar’s October manifesto, which promised a democratic constitution. There were three hundred victims o f the pogrom in Odessa; a hundred and twenty were killed in Yekaterinoslav, forty-six in Kiev, eighty in Bialystok (in 1906), not counting the thousands injured. Altogether, there were some seven hundred such pogroms, only twentyfour outside the Pale o f Settlement and none in Poland and Lithuania, where the Black Hundred were hardly represented. Various parliamentary inquiry committees found that the local authorities were frequently in­ volved; in some places where the Black Hundred did not exist (such as Ciedlec) the pogrom was carried out by the police single-handed; the same seems to be true with regard to Orsha, as well as Simferopol and Feodosiya. It was virtually impossible to establish to what extent pogroms were spon­ taneous and to what degree they were carefully planned and organized. Obviously, there would have been no pogroms but for latent, widespread, and violent anti-Semitism. Equally, the perpetrators would not have dared to take to the streets, to kill, and to burn but for the existence o f some form of organization and the belief that the tsar, the bureaucracy, and the church were, at the very least, not opposed to the attacks. 10. Ibid., pp. 30-31.\n\n22\n\nBEFORE THE REVOLUTION\n\nIt ought to be recalled, however, that there had been pogroms well before the appearance of the Black Hundred on the scene: Pogroms had taken place in the southern and eastern Ukraine in 1881 and on a major scale in Kishinev and Gomel in 1903, again before the appearance o f the Black Hundred. In these as in other cases, the immediate reason was incitement by local propagandists, which fell on fertile ground. Last, men­ tion should be made of the fact that the most murderous pogroms took place in 1919 during the civil war (for instance, in Proskurov, with seven­ teen hundred killed) long after the Black Hundred had ceased to exist.11 Two latter-day interpretations of the pogroms ought to be mentioned in passing. According to Soviet Communist historiography the attacks were as much directed against the left as against Jews; workers seldom, if ever, took part in them. In fact there were few attacks against left-wingers, and working-class elements (particularly railway workers) ffequendy played a prominent part in the pogroms. According to the Black Hundred version, the SRN “ never, under any circumstances, appealed for the murder o f anyone” ; the clashes between the Russian population and the Jews were always provoked by well-armed Jewish fighters who attacked the unarmed Russian population.1112 Seen in this light, the pogroms were mere acts o f self-defense against “ brutalized, predatory, and insatiable Judea,” in the words o f a contemporary Black Hundred periodical. But for this “ counterattack” the tsarist system would have crumbled.13 The Black Hundred also engaged in individual terror, such as the murders of the Duma deputies Gertsenstein and Jollos; they claimed in their defense that a great many more patriotic figures had been killed by left-wing terrorists. The choice o f victims is difficult to fathom: Gertsen­ stein, for instance, was not an ardent revolutionary but a right-wing Kadet (Liberal) o f Jewish origin who had converted many years earlier. He was one of the country’s leading experts on agricultural problems. However, he was one of the representatives o f the capital in Parliament, and the idea that a Jew, even a convert, should represent Moscow seems to have been intolerable to the Black Hundred. The revolutionary ferment abated toward the end o f 1906; so did counter-revolutionary activities. Among the Black Hundred differences o f opinion arose, not so much on ideological lines but as the result of 11. For a thoughtful investigation of the origins and circumstances o f the pogroms o f 1905 and 1919, see J. D. Klier and S. Lambroza, eds.. Pogroms (Cambridge, Mass., 1992). 12. Ostretsov, pp. 22-23. 13. Ibid., p. 24.\n\nTHE BLACK HUNDRED\n\n23\n\nindividual leaders’ conflicting ambitions. The Moscow branch o f the SRN became independent; Vladimir Mitrofanovich Purishkevich, a Bessarabian landowner, founded his “ Union o f the Archangel Michael,” with its main backing in Odessa, Bessarabia and other southern Russian cities. The rest of the SNR split between followers o f Dr. Dubrovin and Markov II. They denounced each other to the government for lack o f patriotism and even philosemitism as emerged when the state archives were opened after 1917. The authorities, by and large, reduced their allocations, and the attempts of the SNR to engage in socioeconomic ventures (such as the establishment of schools, agricultural cooperatives, and savings-and-loan institutions) were unsuccessful. An anti-alcohol campaign got under way, but if it had any effect this was not reflected in statistics concerning the consumption of alcohol. O f the leaders o f the SRN, Dubrovin and Purishkevich died soon after the Revolution. Dubrovin had been the better organizer, but he was strongly disliked even by his collaborators. Boris Nikolsky, a St. Petersburg law professor and a mainstay o f the SRN at the university, called him a “vile parasite” and a “ coarse, repulsive animal.” Nevertheless, Dubrovin seems to have had his qualities as an organizer at a time when other leading figures on the extreme right just kept talking about the need to do something. Purishkevich was the most flamboyant personality in this camp and nationally known as a Duma deputy. He was o f humble origin; his grandfa­ ther had been a poor village priest. But wealth had somehow come to the family; Purishkevich became a most outspoken defender o f the monarchy and aristocracy. He had graduated from university with a dissertation on oligarchic rebellions in ancient Greece. In 1900, at the age o f thirty, he became special assistant to Plehve, the minister o f the interior. There were likely to be disturbances and scandals wherever he appeared whether in Parliament, in a restaurant, or even at the theater, protesting against a performance o f Oscar Wilde’s Salomé.1* He was adept at causing commo­ tion, and there was method behind apparent madness: Being basically opposed to the parliamentary system, he wanted to discredit the Duma. The SRN as such had not participated in the elections to the first Duma, but individual leaders did. Like Dr. Goebbels he tried to break the system from within; like Goebbels he wrote poetry and novels. Millions in government money passed through Purishkevich’s hands between 1906 and 1917. In later years the bureaucracy trusted him more14 14. There is a short Soviet biography of Purishkevich by S. Lyubosh, Russkii fashist (Leningrad, 1925), which says that he set the style ten years before fascism arose in Europe (p. 29) and that he was intellectually and morally head and shoulders above the other extreme right-wingers.\n\n24\n\nBEFORE THE REVOLUTION\n\nthan it did Dr. Dubrovin. As one of his political enemies said, many right-wingers accepted bribes, but Purishkevich was the only one to deliver the goods. Purishkevich usually played the role o f the lone wolf. When war broke out he was fiercely anti-German, whereas most other Black Hundred leaders, realizing that Russia was too weak to sustain a prolonged war, wanted an alliance with Germany against Britain, France, and China. Dur­ ing the war Purishkevich seems to have realized that he was fighting for a lost cause in view of the incompetence and imbecility o f the court and of the ruling classes in general. When he returned from a visit to the front in late 1916 he made a sensational speech in the Duma that got great applause from everyone but the extreme right. Russia, he thought, could be saved only by extreme action. He participated in the murder o f Rasputin, firing the shots that eventually killed the monk. Purishkevich was arrested after the Revolution, but was released or succeeded in escaping and went to the south, where he died in 1920. The third Black Hundred leader of some stature was Markov II, also a gifted Duma orator. He was a landowner from the Kursk area and proud of allegedly resembling Peter the Great in his appearance. He lacked, however, Purishkevich’s flair and charisma as well as his political intelli­ gence. His anti-Semitism was radical; in a speech prior to 1917 he predicted that all Jews, down to the last, would be killed in the coming pogroms, whereas Purishkevich merely wanted to resettle them in the Kolyma region. Markov II played a somewhat shady part in émigré politics, setded in Germany, entered the service o f the Nazis, and was last seen toward the end of the war. All trace of him is lost after 1945. After the abdication o f the tsar and the March revolution, the Black Hundred were banned, and an official investigation into their activities clarified much that had been obscure earlier on. There had been no secret as far as SRN doctrine was concerned. It was based on traditional tsarist doctrine: “ Orthodoxy, autocracy (“samoderzhavie”) and narodnost (an untranslatable term, meaning in this context something akin to a popular monarchy). According to Black Hundred ideology the bureaucracy had somehow spoiled relations between the tsar and the people, and ways and means had to be found to reestablish direct links between the ruler and his subjects. The Black Hundred were against the very concept o f parliamenta­ rism; a parliament meant the existence o f political parties, and thus perpet­ ual conflict, whereas for the SRN the unity o f the people was the supreme value. They advocated the convocation o f a sobor (“ assembly” ) on the lines of similar such assemblies in Russian history, whose function was limited,\n\nTHE BLACK HUNDRED\n\n25\n\nhowever, to advising the tsar and which had no decisive power. Only true Russians, not inorodnye (those of foreign origin) could be members o f a sobor. Mention has been made o f the fact that according to the constitution of the SRN no one o f Jewish origin could be a member; other nonRussians could join only if their election was approved unanimously. While women could, according to the bylaws, be members, they were barred from taking any leading position (paragraph 17 o f the SRN’s constitution).15 Parts o f the SRN’s program were seemingly radical; the group ad­ vocated limiting the working week, raising the living standard o f peasants, and making cheap credits available to peasants; it even supported some kind of agrarian reform. These radical sections of the program had been adopted under pressure from workers’ and peasants’ delegates and they became, in later years, something o f an embarrassment for the SRN. Some leaders argued that they were not really needed: Russian workers were better protected than those in the capitalist world because power in the West was in the hands of Jewish exploiters, whereas in Russia it (still) was in the hands o f the tsar, the friend of the working class.16 As the leaders of the Black Hundred and other thinkers of the far right saw it, most of the damage and ferment had been caused by Russia’s urbanization and industrialization, which had entered a new, accelerated phase in the 1890s. As in other fascist movements the town symbolized roodessness, decadence, revolutionary change, whereas a true national rejuvenation o f the country could take place only in the village. At the same time, even the most extreme right-wingers realized that a strong Russia (such as they desired) needed a developed industry. In this respect, as in others, they faced a dilemma for which they had no answer. They opposed not only banking and the gold standard, but even Stolypin’s agrarian reforms, because these put an end to the traditional communes, the obshchina, and favored the emergence o f well-to-do peasants, the kulaks. While Lenin regarded the Stolypin reforms as a real socioeconomic alternative— which, if successful, might have prevented the success o f the Bolshevik revolution in 1917— and while for the right underglasnost Stolypin became the greatest hero in recent Russian history, for the Black Hundred, he was 15. In fact a significant proportion of the publicists and supporters of the Black Hundred were not of Russian origin. This is true with regard to Purishkevich (who was o f Moldovian, that is to say Romanian, origin); Gringmut (a converted Jew); Butmi de Katzman (who dedicated his edition of the Protocols to the SRN); Krushevan (a member o f the Duma and editor o f Bessambets); General Kaulbars; Levendal; Engelgard; Plehve; Pelikan; General Rand; RichterShvanebach; and others. Among those who continued the Black Hundred tradition in the emigration after 1917 one finds names such as Vinberg and Graf Leuchtenberg in prominent places. 16.

An important difference between the SRN and the traditional right was the single-minded concentration of the former on the Jewish issue. No one on the right liked the Jews and favored equal rights for them. But for the traditional right-wing parties, all of which had been anti-Semitic to some extent, the “Jewish problem” had been, just one of a number o f issues, domestic and foreign, such as Slavophilism, foreign political expansion (especially toward the south), the strengthening o f the Russian armed forces, and so on. The Black Hundred, on the other hand, had no sympa­ thy for their fellow Slavs; they were suspicious of all foreigners. (France and Britain, as they saw it, had been “Judaized.” ) The Black Hundred were isolationists and favored a reduction of the military budget, above all that of the navy. They concentrated their fire against the Jews, who were the source o f all evil in holy Russia. All Jews were revolutionaries and all revolutionaries were Jews. At the same time all Jews were capitalists and all capitalists were either Jews or tools in the hands of Jews. The Jewish revolutionaries wanted to undermine and overthrow the existing order so as to facilitate the installation o f the rule o f the Jewish capitalists. This thesis of the conformity o f interests between Jewish revolutionar­ ies and Jewish capitalists became one o f the main planks o f Nazism. There was perhaps one important difference: It is doubtful whether Hider and Goebbels, with all their anti-Semitism, truly believed in this preposterous theory, which they used simply because they thought it efficacious from a propagandists point o f view. There is no reason to doubt that the Mar­ kovs, Dubrovins, et al., truly believed in it. While the Black Hundred did attack left-wing parties physically and in their propaganda, their main campaigns were always directed against the liberal groups (such as the Kadets) and the capitalists. The militant workers were misguided but honest people, who might be led back to Black Hundred patriotism; the capitalists (as distinct from the big landowners) were the really dangerous enemy and were beyond redemption. There was an enormous distance between this image o f the all-powerful Jew and the reality of millions o f desperately poor Jews huddled together in the “ Pale of Settlement.” There were few Jewish capitalists at.the time; there was a small Jewish middle class, and the number of Jews in Moscow and St. Petersburg was tiny. (There were no pogroms in Moscow simply because there were no potential victims.) But the physical absence o f Jews did not bother the Black Hundred: The Jew was the Antichrist, absent and yet omnipresent, a powerful myth helping to mobilize ignorant masses. But with all this the SRN never became a leading force in the country. It could count on the sympathies of perhaps 10 percent, in some places up\n\nTHE BLACK HUNDRED\n\n27\n\nto 15 or 20 percent o f the people. They were militants, very much in the public eye, but they were never near to achieving a political breakthrough. The Black Hundred split after 1907 and the movement became organi­ zationally much weaker, but a reservoir o f goodwill continued to exist. Dozens o f newspapers and periodicals, mosdy of a local character, con­ tinued to appear. The Black Hundred also found support in Novoye vremya and other mainstream conservative publications, in periodicals sponsored by the army during the war, in church publications, and even in Pmvitelstvenny vestnik, the official organ o f the Russian government. The ruling classes and high society were divided from the beginning about the role o f the Black Hundred. The tsar was an almost fanatical supporter, calling them a “ shining example o f justice and order to all men” ; his wife stuck with them to the very end. If there was a political difference between tsar and tsarina it concerned the authenticity o f the Protocols. Stolypin had ordered two high police officials, Martynov and Vasiliev, to investigate the authenticity of the Protocols. The investigators had reached the conclusion that they were a forgery. Whereupon Nikolai gave an order that the Protocols were no longer to be used, “ since it was impossible to pursue a pure aim by impure means” ! Alexandra Fedorovna, his wife, continued to believe in their authenticity.17 Count Witte hated and despised the Black Hundred and was high on their list o f enemies. Stolypin’s attitude was more complicated. He re­ garded them as a cause of unrest and instability and acted decisively when they threatened public order. Kokovtsev, prime minister from 1911, fol­ lowed a similar line, whereas Makarov, minister o f the interior at the time of the Beilis trial (Kiev, 1913), supported SRN activities; so did Durnovo, one of his predecessors, as well as Trepov, who held many high positions in government.
