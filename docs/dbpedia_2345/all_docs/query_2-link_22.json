        "text": "On the energy flux in acoustic waves in the solar atmosphere .\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBello GonzÃ¡lez, N.; Flores Soriano, M.; Kneer, F.; Okunev, O.\n\nThe energy supply for the radiative losses of the quiet solar chromosphere is studied. Time sequences from quiet Sun disc centre were obtained with the ``GÃ¶ttingen'' Fabry-PÃ©rot spectrometer at the Vacuum Tower Telescope, Observatorio del Teide/Tenerife, in the non-magnetic Fe I 5576 Ã line. The data were reconstructed with speckle methods. The velocities as measured at the line minimum were subjected to Fourier and wavelet analysis. The energy fluxes were corrected for the transmission of the solar atmosphere. We find an energy flux of Ë 3 000 W m-2 at a height of h=250 km. Approximately 2/3 of it is carried by waves in the 5-10 mHz range, and 1/3 in the 10-20 mHz band. The waves occur predominantly above inter-granular areas. We speculate that the acoustic flux in waves with periods shorter than the acoustic cutoff period (Uâ190 s) can contribute to the basal heating of the solar chromosphere, in addition to atmospheric gravity waves.\n\nAcoustic energy in ducts - Further observations\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nEversman, W.\n\n1979-01-01\n\nThe transmission of acoustic energy in uniform ducts carrying uniform flow is investigated with the purpose of clarifying two points of interest. The two commonly used definitions of acoustic 'energy' flux are shown to be related by a Legendre transformation of the Lagrangian density exactly as in deriving the Hamiltonian density in mechanics. In the acoustic case the total energy density and the Hamiltonian density are not the same which accounts for two different 'energy' fluxes. When the duct has acoustically absorptive walls neither of the two flux expressions gives correct results. A reevaluation of the basis of derivation of the energy density and energy flux provides forms which yield consistent results for soft walled ducts.\n\nUpper Atmosphere Heating From Ocean-Generated Acoustic Wave Energy\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nBowman, D. C.; Lees, J. M.\n\n2018-04-27\n\nWe present that colliding sea surface waves generate the ocean microbarom, an acoustic signal that may transmit significant energy to the upper atmosphere. Previous estimates of acoustic energy flux from the ocean microbarom and mountain-wind interactions are on the order of 0.01 to 1 mW/m 2, heating the thermosphere by tens of Kelvins per day. We captured upgoing ocean microbarom waves with a balloon-borne infrasound microphone; the maximum acoustic energy flux was approximately 0.05 mW/m 2. This is about half the average value reported in previous ground-based microbarom observations spanning 8 years. The acoustic flux from the microbarom episode describedmoreÂ Â» here may have heated the thermosphere by several Kelvins per day while the source persisted. Lastly, we suggest that ocean wave models could be used to parameterize acoustically generated heating of the upper atmosphere based on sea state.Â«Â less\n\nUpper Atmosphere Heating From Ocean-Generated Acoustic Wave Energy\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBowman, D.

The fluctuating momentum flux across any control surface is first split into its rotational turbulent ((Ïu)'H) and the irrotational-isentropic acoustic ((Ïu)'A) components using momentum potential theory (MPT). The former has low spatio-temporal coherence, while the latter exhibits a persistent wavepacket form. The energy variable, specifically, total fluctuating enthalpy, is also split into its turbulent and acoustic modes, HH' and HA' respectively. Scattering of acoustic energy is then (Ïu)'HHA' , and transmission is (Ïu)'AHA' . This facilitates a quantitative comparison of scattering versus transmission in the presence of acoustic energy sources, also obtained from MPT, in any turbulent scenario. The wavepacket converts stochastic sound sources into coherent sound radiation. Turbulent eddies are not only sources of sound, but also play a strong role in scattering, particularly near the lipline. The net acoustic flux from the jet is the transport of HA' by the wavepacket, whose axisymmetric and higher azimuthal modes contribute to downstream and sideline radiation respectively.\n\nAcoustic sensors using microstructures tunable with energy other than acoustic energy\n\nDOEpatents\n\nDatskos, Panagiotis G.\n\n2003-11-25\n\nA sensor for detecting acoustic energy includes a microstructure tuned to a predetermined acoustic frequency and a device for detecting movement of the microstructure.

[acoustic propagation within rigid walls\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRostafinski, W.\n\n1974-01-01\n\nInvestigation of the ability of circular bends to transmit acoustic energy flux. A formulation of wave-energy flow is developed for motion in curved ducts. A parametric study over a range of frequencies shows the ability of circular bends to transmit energy in the case of perfectly rigid walls.\n\nAcoustic energy harvesting based on a planar acoustic metamaterial\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nQi, Shuibao; Oudich, Mourad; Li, Yong; Assouar, Badreddine\n\n2016-06-01\n\nWe theoretically report on an innovative and practical acoustic energy harvester based on a defected acoustic metamaterial (AMM) with piezoelectric material. The idea is to create suitable resonant defects in an AMM to confine the strain energy originating from an acoustic incidence. This scavenged energy is converted into electrical energy by attaching a structured piezoelectric material into the defect area of the AMM. We show an acoustic energy harvester based on a meta-structure capable of producing electrical power from an acoustic pressure. Numerical simulations are provided to analyze and elucidate the principles and the performances of the proposed system. A maximum output voltage of 1.3 V and a power density of 0.54 Î¼W/cm3 are obtained at a frequency of 2257.5 Hz. The proposed concept should have broad applications on energy harvesting as well as on low-frequency sound isolation, since this system acts as both acoustic insulator and energy harvester.\n\nOn the relationship between acoustic energy density flux near the jet axis and far field acoustic intensity\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMaestrello, L.\n\n1973-01-01\n\nBy measurement and analysis, the relationship between the distribution of the outflow of acoustic energy over the jet boundary and the far-field intensity is considered. The physical quantity used is the gradient of the pressure evaluated on a geometrical plane at the smallest possible radial distance from the jet axis, but outside the vortical region, in the area where the homogeneous wave equation is reasonably well satisfied. The numerical and experimental procedures involved have been checked out by using a known source. Results indicate that the acoustic power output per unit length of the jet, in the region from which the sound emanates, peaks at approximately 9 diameters downstream. The acoustic emission for a jet Strouhal number of about 0.3 exceeds the emission for all other Strouhal numbers nearly everywhere along the measurement plane. However, the far-field peak intensity distribution obtained from the contribution of each station was found to depend on the spatial extent of the region where sound emanates from the jet, which, in turn, depends more on the far-field angle than on the Strouhal number.\n\nEnergy Flux in the Cochlea: Evidence Against Power Amplification of the Traveling Wave.\n\nPubMed\n\nvan der Heijden, Marcel; Versteegh, Corstiaen P C\n\n2015-10-01\n\nTraveling waves in the inner ear exhibit an amplitude peak that shifts with frequency. The peaking is commonly believed to rely on motile processes that amplify the wave by inserting energy. We recorded the vibrations at adjacent positions on the basilar membrane in sensitive gerbil cochleae and tested the putative power amplification in two ways. First, we determined the energy flux of the traveling wave at its peak and compared it to the acoustic power entering the ear, thereby obtaining the net cochlear power gain. For soft sounds, the energy flux at the peak was 1âÂ±â0.6Â dB less than the middle ear input power. For more intense sounds, increasingly smaller fractions of the acoustic power actually reached the peak region. Thus, we found no net power amplification of soft sounds and a strong net attenuation of intense sounds. Second, we analyzed local wave propagation on the basilar membrane. We found that the waves slowed down abruptly when approaching their peak, causing an energy densification that quantitatively matched the amplitude peaking, similar to the growth of sea waves approaching the beach. Thus, we found no local power amplification of soft sounds and strong local attenuation of intense sounds. The most parsimonious interpretation of these findings is that cochlear sensitivity is not realized by amplifying acoustic energy, but by spatially focusing it, and that dynamic compression is realized by adjusting the amount of dissipation to sound intensity.\n\nMethod and apparatus for generating acoustic energy\n\nDOEpatents\n\nGuerrero, Hector N.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nA method and apparatus for generating and emitting amplified coherent acoustic energy. A cylindrical transducer is mounted within a housing, the transducer having an acoustically open end and an acoustically closed end. The interior of the transducer is filled with an active medium which may include scattering nuclei. Excitation of the transducer produces radially directed acoustic energy in the active medium, which is converted by the dimensions of the transducer, the acoustically closed end thereof, and the scattering nuclei, to amplified coherent acoustic energy directed longitudinally within the transducer. The energy is emitted through the acoustically open end of the transducer. The emitted energy can be used for, among other things, effecting a chemical reaction or removing scale from the interior walls of containment vessels.\n\nAMANDA Observations Constrain the Ultrahigh Energy Neutrino Flux\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHalzen, Francis; /Wisconsin U., Madison; Hooper, Dan\n\n2006-05-01\n\nA number of experimental techniques are currently being deployed in an effort to make the first detection of ultra-high energy cosmic neutrinos. To accomplish this goal, techniques using radio and acoustic detectors are being developed, which are optimally designed for studying neutrinos with energies in the PeV-EeV range and above. Data from the AMANDA experiment, in contrast, has been used to place limits on the cosmic neutrino flux at less extreme energies (up to {approx}10 PeV). In this letter, we show that by adopting a different analysis strategy, optimized for much higher energy neutrinos, the same AMANDA data can bemoreÂ Â» used to place a limit competitive with radio techniques at EeV energies. We also discuss the sensitivity of the IceCube experiment, in various stages of deployment, to ultra-high energy neutrinos.Â«Â less\n\nSynthetic gauge flux and Weyl points in acoustic systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nXiao, Meng; Chen, Wen-Jie; He, Wen-Yu; Chan, C. T.\n\nWe consider acoustic systems comprising a honeycomb lattice in the xy plane and periodic along the z direction. As kz is a good quantum number here, for each fixed kz, this system can be treated as a reduced two-dimensional system. By engineering the interlayer coupling in the z-direction, we show that we can realize effective inversion symmetry breaking and synthetic staggered gauge flux in the reduced two-dimensional system. The realizations of chiral edge states for fixed values of kz are direct consequences of the staggered gauge flux. And we then show that the synthetic gauge flux is closely related to the Weyl points in the three-dimensional band structure. This work was supported by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council (Grant No. AoE/P-02/12).\n\nAcoustic Monitoring of Ebullitive Flux from a Mire Ecosystem in Subarctic Sweden\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBurke, S. A.; Varner, R. K.; Palace, M. W.; Wik, M.; Crill, P. M.; McCalley, C. K.; Amante, J.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nMethane (CH4) is a potent green house gas with wetlands being the largest natural source to the atmosphere. Studies in the Stordalen Mire, a dynamic peatland complex 11km east of the Abisko Scientific Research Station (ANS) in northern Sweden, that focused on CH4 transport to the atmosphere from peatlands have shown increased emissions over the past decades. Ebullitive flux (bubbling) is a potentially significant pathway of CH4 from mire/lake ecosystems. Ebullitive fluxes were successfully monitored acoustically in peat and lakes in 2011. This work expands those measurements with installation of sensors in ponds and permafrost thaw margins in 2012. Eighteen acoustic sensors were installed in peat (6), pond (6), and lake (6) sites at Stordalen Mire. Recorders collected acoustic data continuously from each sensor and gas samples were collected from the traps at least once per week beginning 7 July. The CH4 concentration in the gas was measured using gas chromatography and selected samples were also analyzed for 13C-CH4 using a Quantum Cascade Laser (QCL). The acoustic data were evaluated using a MATLAB program for determine the timing and volume of each ebullition event. The CH4 ebullitive flux from the peat was greater in July 2011 than during the same period in 2012. In comparison, the ponds and thaw margins released CH4 at a faster rate in 2012 than was observed in the peat and lake sensors in 2011. Inter-annual differences in ebullitive rates suggest that weather scale differences between years may control CH4 ebullitive flux. 13C-CH4 measured in the pore waters of pond sediment suggests that not all ponds are dominated by the same production processes. However, 13C-CH4 measured in bubbles and sediments are not different, implying little or no oxidation of CH4 during transport to the water surface. Our data suggests that changes in atmospheric pressure and water table height correlated with the ebullitive release in all three sub-ecosystems.\n\nA low-frequency wave motion mechanism enables efficient energy transport in carbon nanotubes at high heat fluxes.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Xiaoliang; Hu, Ming; Poulikakos, Dimos\n\n2012-07-11\n\nThe great majority of investigations of thermal transport in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in the open literature focus on low heat fluxes, that is, in the regime of validity of the Fourier heat conduction law. In this paper, by performing nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations we investigated thermal transport in a single-walled CNT bridging two Si slabs under constant high heat flux. An anomalous wave-like kinetic energy profile was observed, and a previously unexplored, wave-dominated energy transport mechanism is identified for high heat fluxes in CNTs, originated from excited low frequency transverse acoustic waves. The transported energy, in terms of a one-dimensional low frequency mechanical wave, is quantified as a function of the total heat flux applied and is compared to the energy transported by traditional Fourier heat conduction. The results show that the low frequency wave actually overtakes traditional Fourier heat conduction and efficiently transports the energy at high heat flux. Our findings reveal an important new mechanism for high heat flux energy transport in low-dimensional nanostructures, such as one-dimensional (1-D) nanotubes and nanowires, which could be very relevant to high heat flux dissipation such as in micro/nanoelectronics applications.\n\nAcoustic waves in the solar atmosphere at high spatial resolution\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBello GonzÃ¡lez, N.; Flores Soriano, M.; Kneer, F.; Okunev, O.\n\n2009-12-01\n\nAims. The energy supply for the radiative losses of the quiet solar chromosphere is studied. On the basis of high spatial resolution data, we investigate the amount of energy flux carried by acoustic waves in the solar photosphere. Methods: Time sequences from quiet Sun disc centre were obtained with the âGÃ¶ttingenâ Fabry-Perot spectrometer at the Vacuum Tower Telescope, Observatorio del Teide/Tenerife, in the non-magnetic Fe i 5576 Ã line. The data were reconstructed with speckle methods. The velocity and intensity fluctuations at line minimum were subjected to Fourier and wavelet analyses. The energy fluxes at frequencies higher than the acoustic cutoff frequency (period U â 190 s) were corrected for the transmission of the solar atmosphere, which reduces the signal from short-period waves. Results: Both Fourier and wavelet analysis give an amount of energy flux of ~3000 W m-2 at a height h = 250 km. Approximately 2/3 of it is carried by waves in the 5-10 mHz range, and 1/3 in the 10-20 mHz band. Extrapolation of the flux spectra gives an energy flux of 230-400 W m-2 at frequencies Î½ > 20 mHz. We find that the waves occur predominantly above inter-granular areas. Conclusions: We conclude that the acoustic flux in waves with periods shorter than the acoustic cutoff period can contribute to the basal heating of the solar chromosphere, in addition to the atmospheric gravity waves found recently.\n\nAcoustic energy exchange through flow turning\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBaum, Joseph D.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nA numerical investigation of the mechanisms of acoustic energy exchange between the mean and acoustic flow fields in resonance chambers, such as rocket engines, is reported. A noniterative linearized block implicit scheme was used to solve the time-dependent compressible Navier-Stokes equations. Two test cases were investigated: acoustic wave propagation in a tube with a coexisting sheared mean flow (the refraction test) and acoustic wave propagation in a tube where the mean sheared flow was injected into the tube through its lateral boundary (the flow turning study). For flow turning, significant excitation of mean flow energy was observed at two locations: at the edge of the acoustic boundary layer and within a zone adjacent to the acoustic boundary layer extending up to 0.1 radii away from the wall. A weaker streaming effect was observed for the refraction study, and only at the edge of the acoustic boundary layer. The total dissipation for the flow turning test was twice the dissipation for refraction.\n\nCHROMOSPHERIC HEATING BY ACOUSTIC WAVES COMPARED TO RADIATIVE COOLING\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSobotka, M.; Heinzel, P.; Å vanda, M.\n\nAcoustic and magnetoacoustic waves are among the possible candidate mechanisms that heat the upper layers of the solar atmosphere. A weak chromospheric plage near the large solar pore NOAA 11005 was observed on 2008 October 15, in the Fe i 617.3 nm and Ca ii 853.2 nm lines of the Interferometric Bidimemsional Spectrometer attached to the Dunn Solar Telescope. In analyzing the Ca ii observations (with spatial and temporal resolutions of 0.â³4 and 52 s) the energy deposited by acoustic waves is compared to that released by radiative losses. The deposited acoustic flux is estimated from the power spectra ofmoreÂ Â» Doppler oscillations measured in the Ca ii line core. The radiative losses are calculated using a grid of seven one-dimensional hydrostatic semi-empirical model atmospheres. The comparison shows that the spatial correlation of the maps of radiative losses and acoustic flux is 72%. In a quiet chromosphere, the contribution of acoustic energy flux to radiative losses is small, only about 15%. In active areas with a photospheric magnetic-field strength between 300 and 1300 G and an inclination of 20Â°â60Â°, the contribution increases from 23% (chromospheric network) to 54% (a plage). However, these values have to be considered as lower limits and it might be possible that the acoustic energy flux is the main contributor to the heating of bright chromospheric network and plages.Â«Â less\n\nTraveling-wave device with mass flux suppression\n\nDOEpatents\n\nSwift, Gregory W.; Backhaus, Scott N.; Gardner, David L.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nA traveling-wave device is provided with the conventional moving pistons eliminated. Acoustic energy circulates in a direction through a fluid within a torus. A side branch may be connected to the torus for transferring acoustic energy into or out of the torus. A regenerator is located in the torus with a first heat exchanger located on a first side of the regenerator downstream of the regenerator relative to the direction of the circulating acoustic energy; and a second heat exchanger located on an upstream side of the regenerator. The improvement is a mass flux suppressor located in the torus to minimize time-averaged mass flux of the fluid. In one embodiment, the device further includes a thermal buffer column in the torus to thermally isolate the heat exchanger that is at the operating temperature of the device.\n\nHelix structure for low frequency acoustic energy harvesting\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYuan, Ming; Cao, Ziping; Luo, Jun; Pang, Zongqiang\n\n2018-05-01\n\nIn this study, a novel helix acoustic resonator is proposed to realize acoustic energy harvesting (AEH).

W.;\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe detection of acoustic signals from ultra-high energy neutrino interactions is a promising method to measure the flux of cosmogenic neutrinos expected on Earth. The energy threshold for this process depends strongly on the absolute noise level in the target material. The South Pole Acoustic Test Setup (SPATS), deployed in the upper part of four boreholes of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, has monitored the noise in Antarctic ice at the geographic South Pole for more than two years down to 500m depth. The noise is very stable and Gaussian distributed. Lacking an in-situ calibration up to now, laboratory measurements have been used to estimate the absolute noise level in the 10 to 50 kHz frequency range to be smaller than 20mPa. Using a threshold trigger, sensors of the South Pole Acoustic Test Setup registered acoustic events in the IceCube detector volume and its vicinity. Acoustic signals from refreezing IceCube holes and from anthropogenic sources have been used to test the localization of acoustic events. An upper limit on the neutrino flux at energies E > 10(exp 11) GeV is derived from acoustic data taken over eight months.\n\nBackground studies for acoustic neutrino detection at the South Pole\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAbbasi, R.; Abdou, Y.; Abu-Zayyad, T.; Adams, J.; Aguilar, J.

The energy threshold for this process depends strongly on the absolute noise level in the target material. The South Pole Acoustic Test Setup (SPATS), deployed in the upper part of four boreholes of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, has monitored the noise in Antarctic ice at the geographic South Pole for more than two years down to 500 m depth. The noise is very stable and Gaussian distributed. Lacking an in situ calibration up to now, laboratory measurements have been used to estimate the absolute noise level in the 10-50 kHz frequency range to be smaller than 20 mPa. Using a threshold trigger, sensors of the South Pole Acoustic Test Setup registered acoustic events in the IceCube detector volume and its vicinity. Acoustic signals from refreezing IceCube holes and from anthropogenic sources have been used to test the localization of acoustic events. An upper limit on the neutrino flux at energies EÎ½ > 1011 GeV is derived from acoustic data taken over eight months.\n\nAcoustic energy harvesting using an electromechanical Helmholtz resonator.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Fei; Phipps, Alex; Horowitz, Stephen; Ngo, Khai; Cattafesta, Louis; Nishida, Toshikazu; Sheplak, Mark\n\n2008-04-01\n\nThis paper presents the development of an acoustic energy harvester using an electromechanical Helmholtz resonator (EMHR). The EMHR consists of an orifice, cavity, and a piezoelectric diaphragm. Acoustic energy is converted to mechanical energy when sound incident on the orifice generates an oscillatory pressure in the cavity, which in turns causes the vibration of the diaphragm. The conversion of acoustic energy to electrical energy is achieved via piezoelectric transduction in the diaphragm of the EMHR. Moreover, the diaphragm is coupled with energy reclamation circuitry to increase the efficiency of the energy conversion. Lumped element modeling of the EMHR is used to provide physical insight into the coupled energy domain dynamics governing the energy reclamation process. The feasibility of acoustic energy reclamation using an EMHR is demonstrated in a plane wave tube for two power converter topologies. The first is comprised of only a rectifier, and the second uses a rectifier connected to a flyback converter to improve load matching. Experimental results indicate that approximately 30 mW of output power is harvested for an incident sound pressure level of 160 dB with a flyback converter. Such power level is sufficient to power a variety of low power electronic devices.\n\nEnergy density and energy flux in the focus of an optical vortex: reverse flux of light energy.\n\nPubMed\n\nKotlyar, Victor V; Kovalev, Alexey A; Nalimov, Anton G\n\n2018-06-15\n\nUsing the Richards-Wolf formulas for an arbitrary circularly polarized optical vortex with an integer topological charge m, we obtain explicit expressions for all components of the electric and magnetic field strength vectors near the focus, as well as expressions for the intensity (energy density) and for the energy flux (components of the Poynting vector) in the focal plane of an aplanatic optical system. For m=2, from the obtained expressions it follows that the energy flux near the optical axis propagates in the reversed direction, rotating along a spiral around the optical axis. On the optical axis itself, the reversed flux is maximal and decays rapidly with the distance from the axis. For m=3, in contrast, the reversed energy flux in the focal plane is minimal (zero) on the optical axis and increases (until the first ring of the light intensity) as a squared distance from the axis.\n\nTunable sub-wavelength acoustic energy harvesting with a metamaterial plate\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOudich, Mourad; Li, Yong\n\n2017-08-01\n\nWe report theoretically on sub-wavelength acoustic energy harvesting (AEH) using a thin acoustic metamaterial (AM) made of spring-mass resonators attached to the surface of a homogeneous elastic thin plate. Considering an incident acoustic wave hitting the AM plate, tunable and highly efficient AEH is achieved by introducing a sub-wavelength defect inside the AM structure to confine the elastic energy into a spot which is then electromechanically converted into electrical power using a ceramic PZT patch. Several types of sub-wavelength cavities capable of confining acoustic energy at the sonic regime are extensively investigated for the optimization of AEH. Three analytical approachesâband structure, sound transmission loss and electrical-to-mechanical energy conversionâare proposed to fully describe the system interaction with the acoustic wave and quantify the AEH performance. The computed results show that an average power of 18 Î¼W can be harvested using a specific cavity design of only 3 Ã 3 cm2 size from an incident acoustic wave with a sound pressure level of 100 dB at 520 Hz. Such a system can open up a way through the design of effective tunable sub-wavelength acoustic energy harvesters based on AM applied to scavenge energy from sound.\n\nOrigami acoustics: using principles of folding structural acoustics for simple and large focusing of sound energy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHarne, Ryan L.; Lynd, Danielle T.\n\n2016-08-01\n\nFixed in spatial distribution, arrays of planar, electromechanical acoustic transducers cannot adapt their wave energy focusing abilities unless each transducer is externally controlled, creating challenges for the implementation and portability of such beamforming systems. Recently, planar, origami-based structural tessellations are found to facilitate great versatility in system function and properties through kinematic folding. In this research we bridge the physics of acoustics and origami-based design to discover that the simple topological reconfigurations of a Miura-ori-based acoustic array yield many orders of magnitude worth of reversible change in wave energy focusing: a potential for acoustic field morphing easily obtained through deployable, tessellated architectures. Our experimental and theoretical studies directly translate the roles of folding the tessellated array to the adaptations in spectral and spatial wave propagation sensitivities for far field energy transmission. It is shown that kinematic folding rules and flat-foldable tessellated arrays collectively provide novel solutions to the long-standing challenges of conventional, electronically-steered acoustic beamformers. While our examples consider sound radiation from the foldable array in air, linear acoustic reciprocity dictates that the findings may inspire new innovations for acoustic receivers, e.g. adaptive sound absorbers and microphone arrays, as well as concepts that include water-borne waves.\n\nState of the art in acoustic energy harvesting\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nUllah Khan, Farid; Izhar\n\n2015-02-01\n\nFor portable and embedded smart, wireless electronic systems, energy harvesting from the ambient energy sources has gained immense interest in recent years. Several ambient energies exist in the environment of wireless sensor nodes (WSNs) that include thermal, solar, vibration and acoustic energy. This paper presents the recent development in the field of acoustic energy harvesters (AEHs). AEHs convert the acoustic energy into useful electrical energy for the operation of autonomous wireless sensors. Mainly, two types of AEHs (electromagnetic and piezoelectric based) have been developed and reported in literature. The power produced by the reported piezoelectric AEHs ranges from 0.68âpW to 30âmW however, the power generation of the developed electromagnetic AEHs is in the range of 1.5-1.96âmW. The overall size of most of the developed piezoelectric and electromagnetic AEHs are quite comparable and in millimeter scale. The resonant frequencies of electromagnetic AEHs are on the lower side (143-470âHz), than that of piezoelectric AEHs (146âHz-16.7âkHz).\n\nImplementation of an acoustic-based methane flux estimation methodology in the Eastern Siberian Arctic Sea\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWeidner, E. F.; Weber, T. C.; Mayer, L. A.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nQuantifying methane flux originating from marine seep systems in climatically sensitive regions is of critically importance for current and future climate studies. Yet, the methane contribution from these systems has been difficult to estimate given the broad spatial scale of the ocean and the heterogeneity of seep activity. One such region is the Eastern Siberian Arctic Sea (ESAS), where bubble release into the shallow water column (<40 meters average depth) facilitates transport of methane to the atmosphere without oxidation. Quantifying the current seep methane flux from the ESAS is necessary to understand not only the total ocean methane budget, but also to provide baseline estimates against which future climate-induced changes can be measured. At the 2016 AGU fall meeting, we presented a new acoustic-based flux methodology using a calibrated broadband split-beam echosounder. The broad (14-24 kHz) bandwidth provides a vertical resolution of 10 cm, making possible the identification of single bubbles. After calibration using 64 mm copper sphere of known backscatter, the acoustic backscatter of individual bubbles is measured and compared to analytical models to estimate bubble radius. Additionally, bubbles are precisely located and traced upwards through the water column to estimate rise velocity. The combination of radius and rise velocity allows for gas flux estimation. Here, we follow up with the completed implementation of this methodology applied to the Herald Canyon region of the western ESAS. From the 68 recognized seeps, bubble radii and rise velocity were computed for more than 550 individual bubbles. The range of bubble radii, 1-6 mm, is comparable to those published by other investigators, while the radius dependent rise velocities are consistent with published models. Methane flux for the Herald Canyon region was estimated by extrapolation from individual seep flux values.\n\nSound insulation and energy harvesting based on acoustic metamaterial plate\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAssouar, Badreddine; Oudich, Mourad; Zhou, Xiaoming\n\n2015-03-01\n\nThe emergence of artificially designed sub-wavelength acoustic materials, denoted acoustic metamaterials (AMM), has significantly broadened the range of materials responses found in nature. These engineered materials can indeed manipulate sound/vibration in surprising ways, which include vibration/sound insulation, focusing, cloaking, acoustic energy harvesting â¦. In this work, we report both on the analysis of the airborne sound transmission loss (STL) through a thin metamaterial plate and on the possibility of acoustic energy harvesting. We first provide a theoretical study of the airborne STL and confronted them to the structure-borne dispersion of a metamaterial plate. Second, we propose to investigate the acoustic energy harvesting capability of the plate-type AMM. We have developed semi-analytical and numerical methods to investigate the STL performances of a plate-type AMM with an airborne sound excitation having different incident angles. The AMM is made of silicone rubber stubs squarely arranged in a thin aluminum plate, and the STL is calculated at low-frequency range [100Hz to 3kHz] for an incoming incident sound pressure wave. The obtained analytical and numerical STL present a very good agreement confirming the reliability of developed approaches. A comparison between computed STL and the band structure of the considered AMM shows an excellent agreement and gives a physical understanding of the observed behavior. On another hand, the acoustic energy confinement in AMM with created defects with suitable geometry was investigated. The first results give a general view for assessing the acoustic energy harvesting performances making use of AMM.\n\nHigh flux solar energy transformation\n\nDOEpatents\n\nWinston, Roland; Gleckman, Philip L.; O'Gallagher, Joseph J.\n\n1991-04-09\n\nDisclosed are multi-stage systems for high flux transformation of solar energy allowing for uniform solar intensification by a factor of 60,000 suns or more. Preferred systems employ a focusing mirror as a primary concentrative device and a non-imaging concentrator as a secondary concentrative device with concentrative capacities of primary and secondary stages selected to provide for net solar flux intensification of greater than 2000 over 95 percent of the concentration area. Systems of the invention are readily applied as energy sources for laser pumping and in other photothermal energy utilization processes.\n\nEnergy balance and non-turbulent fluxes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nModerow, Uta; Feigenwinter, Christian; Bernhofer, Christian\n\n2010-05-01\n\nOften, the sum of the turbulent fluxes of sensible heat and latent heat from eddy covariance (EC) measurements does not match the available energy (sum of net radiation, ground heat flux and storage changes). This is referred to as energy balance closure gap. The reported imbalances vary between 0% and 50% (Laubach 1996). In various publications, it has been shown that the uncertainty of the available energy itself does not explain the gap (Vogt et al. 1996; Moderow et al. 2009). Among other reasons, the underestimation is attributed to an underestimation of turbulent fluxes and undetected non-turbulent transport processes, i.e. advection (e.g. Foken et al. 2006). The imbalance is typically larger during nighttime than during daytime as the EC method fails to capture non-turbulent transports that can be significant during night (e.g. Aubinet 2008). Results for the budget of CO2 showed that including non-turbulent fluxes can change the budgets considerably. Hence, it is interesting to see how the budget of energy is changed. Here, the consequences of including advective fluxes of sensible heat and latent heat in the energy balance are explored with focus on nighttime conditions. Non-turbulent fluxes will be inspected critically regarding their plausibility. Following Bernhofer et al. (2003), a ratio similar to Bowen's ratio of the turbulent fluxes are defined for the non-turbulent fluxes and compared to each other. This might have implications for the partitioning of the available energy into sensible heat and latent heat. Data of the ADVEX-campaigns (Feigenwinter et al. 2008) of three different sites across Europe are used and selected periods are inspected.

Previous discussions of the BAO dark energy test have focused on direct measurements of redshifts of as many as 10(9) individual galaxies, by observing the 21 cm line or by detecting optical emission. Here we show how the study of acoustic oscillation in the 21 cm brightness can be accomplished by economical three-dimensional intensity mapping.

The research subject was noise emission spreading into the surroundings during the passage of trains over a directly travelled steel bridge construction. Noise emissions were measured using direct measurements in the field. The measurements were performed in two measurement profiles. The noise exposures A LAE measured near the steel bridge construction were compared against the noise exposures A LAE captured on an open track. From the difference of these data, the noise level of the steel bridge structure was determined. Part of the research was to evaluate the effect of the reconstruction of the railway track superstructure on the acoustic situation in the given section of the railway track. The article describes the methodology of measurements, including the processing and evaluation of measured data. The article points out the noise levels of the steel bridge construction and assesses changes in the acoustic situation after the reconstruction.\n\nAcoustic wave-driven oxidized liquid metal-based energy harvester\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJeon, Jinpyo; Chung, Sang Kug; Lee, Jeong-Bong; Doo, Seok Joo; Kim, Daeyoung\n\n2018-06-01\n\nWe report an oxidized liquid metal droplet-based energy harvester that converts acoustic energy into electrical energy by modulating an electrical double layer that originates from the deformation of the oxidized liquid metal droplet. Gallium-based liquid metal alloy has been developed for various applications owing to the outstanding material properties, such as its high electrical conductivity (metallic property) and unlimited deformability (liquid property). In this study, we demonstrated energy harvesting using an electrical double layer between the acoustic wave-modulated liquid metal droplet and two electrodes. The proposed energy harvester consisted of top and bottom electrodes covered with the dielectric layer and a Gallium-based liquid metal droplet placed between the electrodes. When we applied an external bias voltage and acoustic wave to the proposed device, the contact area between the liquid metal droplet and the electrodes changed, leading to the variation of the capacitance in the electrical double layer and the generation of electrical output current. Using the proposed energy harvester, the maximum output current of 41.2 nA was generated with an applied acoustic wave of 30 Hz. In addition, we studied the relationships between the maximum output current and a variety of factors, such as the size of the liquid metal droplet, the thickness of the hydrophobic layer, and the distance between the top and bottom electrode plates.\n\nOSO 8 observational limits to the acoustic coronal heating mechanism\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBruner, E. C., Jr.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nAn improved analysis of time-resolved line profiles of the C IV resonance line at 1548 A has been used to test the acoustic wave hypothesis of solar coronal heating. It is shown that the observed motions and brightness fluctuations are consistent with the existence of acoustic waves. Specific account is taken of the effect of photon statistics on the observed velocities, and a test is devised to determine whether the motions represent propagating or evanescent waves. It is found that on the average about as much energy is carried upward as downward such that the net acoustic flux density is statistically consistent with zero. The statistical uncertainty in this null result is three orders of magnitue lower than the flux level needed to heat the corona.\n\nAcoustic measurement method of the volume flux of a seafloor hydrothermal plume\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nXu, G.; Jackson, D. R.; Bemis, K. G.; Rona, P. A.\n\n2011-12-01\n\nMeasuring fluxes (volume, chemical, heat, etc.) of the deep sea hydrothermal vents has been a crucial but challenging task faced by the scientific community since the discovery of the vent systems. However, the great depths and complexities of the hydrothermal vents make traditional sampling methods laborious and almost daunting missions. Furthermore, the samples, in most cases both sparse in space and sporadic in time, are hardly enough to provide a result with moderate uncertainty. In September 2010, our Cabled Observatory Vent Imaging Sonar System (COVIS, http://vizlab.rutgers.edu/AcoustImag/covis.html) was connected to the Neptune Canada underwater ocean observatory network (http://www.neptunecanada.ca) at the Main Endeavour vent field on the Endeavour segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge. During the experiment, the COVIS system produced 3D images of the buoyant plume discharged from the vent complex Grotto by measuring the back-scattering intensity of the acoustic signal. Building on the methodology developed in our previous work, the vertical flow velocity of the plume is estimated from the Doppler shift of the acoustic signal using geometric correction to compensate for the ambient horizontal currents. A Gaussian distribution curve is fitted to the horizontal back-scattering intensity profile to determine the back-scattering intensity at the boundary of the plume. Such a boundary value is used as the threshold in a window function for separating the plume from background signal. Finally, the volume flux is obtained by integrating the resulting 2D vertical velocity profile over the horizontal cross-section of the plume. In this presentation, we discuss preliminary results from the COVIS experiment. In addition, several alternative approaches are applied to determination of the accuracy of the estimated plume vertical velocity in the absence of direct measurements. First, the results from our previous experiment (conducted in 2000 at the same vent complex using a\n\nHigh flux solar energy transformation\n\nDOEpatents\n\nWinston, R.; Gleckman, P.L.; O'Gallagher, J.J.\n\n1991-04-09\n\nDisclosed are multi-stage systems for high flux transformation of solar energy allowing for uniform solar intensification by a factor of 60,000 suns or more.

The focus is placed on an underwater system that consists of a pulsating source for spherical wave generation and a harvester connected to an external resistive load for quantifying the electrical power output. An analytical electro-acoustic model is developed to relate the source strength to the electrical power output of the harvester located at a specific distance from the source. The model couples the energy harvester dynamics (piezoelectric device and electrical load) with the source strength through the acoustic-structure interaction at the harvester-fluid interface. Case studies are given for a detailed understanding of the coupled system dynamics under various conditions. Specifically the relationship between the electrical power output and system parameters, such as the distance of the harvester from the source, dimensions of the harvester, level of source strength, and electrical load resistance are explored. Sensitivity of the electrical power output to the excitation frequency in the neighborhood of the harvester's underwater resonance frequency is also reported.\n\nForaging theory predicts predator-prey energy fluxes.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrose, U; Ehnes, R B; Rall, B C; Vucic-Pestic, O; Berlow, E L; Scheu, S\n\n2008-09-01\n\n1. In natural communities, populations are linked by feeding interactions that make up complex food webs. The stability of these complex networks is critically dependent on the distribution of energy fluxes across these feeding links. 2. In laboratory experiments with predatory beetles and spiders, we studied the allometric scaling (body-mass dependence) of metabolism and per capita consumption at the level of predator individuals and per link energy fluxes at the level of feeding links. 3. Despite clear power-law scaling of the metabolic and per capita consumption rates with predator body mass, the per link predation rates on individual prey followed hump-shaped relationships with the predator-prey body mass ratios. These results contrast with the current metabolic paradigm, and find better support in foraging theory. 4. This suggests that per link energy fluxes from prey populations to predator individuals peak at intermediate body mass ratios, and total energy fluxes from prey to predator populations decrease monotonically with predator and prey mass. Surprisingly, contrary to predictions of metabolic models, this suggests that for any prey species, the per link and total energy fluxes to its largest predators are smaller than those to predators of intermediate body size. 5. An integration of metabolic and foraging theory may enable a quantitative and predictive understanding of energy flux distributions in natural food webs.\n\nHybrid acoustic energy harvesting using combined electromagnetic and piezoelectric conversion\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKhan, Farid Ullah; Izhar\n\n2016-02-01\n\nThis paper reports a novel hybrid acoustic energy harvester.

Furthermore, it would enhance the development, use, and reliability of low-power sensors in applications where changing batteries is not practical or may not be a viable option. One CET method that has recently attracted interest is the ultrasonic acoustic energy transfer, which is based on the reception of acoustic waves at ultrasonic frequencies by a piezoelectric receiver. Patterning and focusing the transmitted acoustic energy in space is one of the challenges for enhancing the power transmission and locally charging sensors or devices. We use a mathematically designed passive metamaterial-based acoustic hologram to selectively power an array of piezoelectric receivers using an unfocused transmitter. The acoustic hologram is employed to create a multifocal pressure pattern in the target plane where the receivers are located inside focal regions. We conduct multiphysics simulations in which a single transmitter is used to power multiple receivers with an arbitrary two-dimensional spatial pattern via wave controlling and manipulation, using the hologram. We show that the multi-focal pressure pattern created by the passive acoustic hologram will enhance the power transmission for most receivers.\n\nAnalysis of scattering by spheres having a negative acoustical refractive index\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMarston, Philip L.\n\n2005-04-01\n\nElectromagnetic waves having oppositely directed phase and group velocities propagate in metamaterials having a negative permeability and negative permittivity [J. B. Pendry and D. R. Smith, Phys. Today 57(6), 37-44 (2004)]. Such materials are predicted to have unusual electromagnetic scattering properties [R. Ruppin, Solid State Commun. 116, 411-415 (2000)]. If it is possible to fabricate acoustical materials having a simultaneously negative effective elastic modulus and density (in a dynamical sense), the mechanical energy flux will have the opposite direction as the wave-vector associated with phase evolution. Rays descriptive of the energy flux refracted by such hypothetical materials at interfaces with ordinary fluids would be characterized by a negative acoustical refractive index. Partial-wave-series calculations of high frequency scattering by fluid spheres having an acoustical refractive index at (or close to) 1 reveal backscattering enhancements associated with glory rays which, unlike ordinary spheres [P. L. Marston and D. S. Langley, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 73, 1464-1475 (1983)], require only a single internal chord. Generalized Lamb waves on elastic shells having opposite phase and group velocities also cause enhanced backscattering associated with unusual rays [G. Kaduchak, D. H. Hughes, and P. L. Marston, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 96, 3704-3714 (1994)].\n\nCharacterization of seismic hazard and structural response by energy flux\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nAfak, E.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nSeismic safety of structures depends on the structure's ability to absorb the seismic energy that is transmitted from ground to structure. One parameter that can be used to characterize seismic energy is the energy flux. Energy flux is defined as the amount of energy transmitted per unit time through a cross-section of a medium, and is equal to kinetic energy multiplied by the propagation velocity of seismic waves. The peak or the integral of energy flux can be used to characterize ground motions. By definition, energy flux automatically accounts for site amplification. Energy flux in a structure can be studied by formulating the problem as a wave propagation problem. For buildings founded on layered soil media and subjected to vertically incident plane shear waves, energy flux equations are derived by modeling the buildings as an extension of the layered soil medium, and considering each story as another layer. The propagation of energy flux in the layers is described in terms of the upgoing and downgoing energy flux in each layer, and the energy reflection and transmission coefficients at each interface. The formulation results in a pair of simple finite-difference equations for each layer, which can be solved recursively starting from the bedrock. The upgoing and downgoing energy flux in the layers allows calculation of the energy demand and energy dissipation in each layer. The methodology is applicable to linear, as well as nonlinear structures. ?? 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.\n\nHeat-Flux Measurements from Collective Thomson-Scattering Spectra\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHenchen, R. J.; Hu, S. X.; Katz, J.; Froula, D. H.; Rozmus, W.\n\n2015-11-01\n\nCollective Thomson scattering was used to measure heat flux in coronal plasmas. The relative amplitude of the Thomson-scattered power into the up- and downshifted electron plasma wave features was used to determine the flux of electrons moving along the temperature gradient at three to four times the electron thermal velocity. Simultaneously, the ion-acoustic wave features were measured. Their relative amplitude is used to measure the flux of the return-current electrons. The frequencies of these ion-acoustic and electron plasma wave features provide local measurements of the electron temperature and density. These spectra were obtained at five locations along the temperature gradient in a laser-produced blowoff plasma. These measurements of plasma parameters are used to infer the Spitzer -HÃ¤rm flux qSH = - ÎºâTe and are in good agreement with the values of the heat flux measured from the scattering-feature asymmetries.

We present two results. First, we compute the flux integral of energy using the symplectic current density of the covariant phase space approach on hypersurfaces of constant radial physical distance. Using this computation we show that in the tt-projection, the integrand in the energy flux expression on the cosmological horizon is same as that on the future null infinity. This suggests that propagation of energy flux in de Sitter spacetime is sharp. Second, we relate our energy flux expression in tt-projection to a previously obtained expression using the Isaacson stress-tensor approach.\n\nInvestigation of the Flame-Acoustic Wave Interaction during Axial Solid Rocket Instabilities\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1991-04-30\n\nacoustic exergy by the mean flow was neglected as small with respect to the mean flow independent energy flux.

D.; Giovane, F.; Liou, Jer-Chyi; Burtchell, M.; Pisacane, V.; Lagakos, N.; Williams, E.; Stansbery, E.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThis report examines the inherent capability of three large-area acoustic sensor systems and their applicability for micrometeoroids (MM) and lunar secondary ejecta (SE) detection and characterization for future lunar exploration activities. Discussion is limited to instruments that can be fabricated and deployed with low resource requirements. Previously deployed impact detection probes typically have instrumented capture areas less than 0.2 square meters. Since the particle flux decreases rapidly with increased particle size, such small-area sensors rarely encounter particles in the size range above 50 microns, and even their sampling the population above 10 microns is typically limited. Characterizing the sparse dust population in the size range above 50 microns requires a very large-area capture instrument. However it is also important that such an instrument simultaneously measures the population of the smaller particles, so as to provide a complete instantaneous snapshot of the population. For lunar or planetary surface studies, the system constraints are significant. The instrument must be as large as possible to sample the population of the largest MM. This is needed to reliably assess the particle impact risks and to develop cost-effective shielding designs for habitats, astronauts, and critical instrument. The instrument should also have very high sensitivity to measure the flux of small and slow SE particles. is the SE environment is currently poorly characterized, and possess a contamination risk to machinery and personnel involved in exploration. Deployment also requires that the instrument add very little additional mass to the spacecraft. Three acoustic systems are being explored for this application.\n\nCoronal Flux Rope Catastrophe Associated With Internal Energy Release\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhuang, Bin; Hu, Youqiu; Wang, Yuming; Zhang, Quanhao; Liu, Rui; Gou, Tingyu; Shen, Chenglong\n\n2018-04-01\n\nMagnetic energy during the catastrophe was predominantly studied by the previous catastrophe works since it is believed to be the main energy supplier for the solar eruptions. However, the contribution of other types of energies during the catastrophe cannot be neglected. This paper studies the catastrophe of the coronal flux rope system in the solar wind background, with emphasis on the transformation of different types of energies during the catastrophe. The coronal flux rope is characterized by its axial and poloidal magnetic fluxes and total mass. It is shown that a catastrophe can be triggered by not only an increase but also a decrease of the axial magnetic flux. Moreover, the internal energy of the rope is found to be released during the catastrophe so as to provide energy for the upward eruption of the flux rope. As far as the magnetic energy is concerned, it provides only part of the energy release, or even increases during the catastrophe, so the internal energy may act as the dominant or even the unique energy supplier during the catastrophe.\n\nAn Energy Harvesting Underwater Acoustic Transmitter for Aquatic Animals\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLi, Huidong; Tian, Chuan; Lu, Jun\n\nThis paper presents a self-powered underwater acoustic transmitter using a piezoelectric beam to harvest the mechanical energy from fish swimming. This transmitter does not require a battery and is demonstrated in live fish. It transmits an acoustic waveform as the implanted fish swims. It enables long-term monitoring of aquatic animals.\n\nBiosignatures in the Context of Low Energy Flux\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHoehler, T. M.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nMany of the features that are thought of as biosignatures - including the mediation of chemical and physical processes with speed, specificity, and selectivity - result directly or indirectly from life's unique capability to mediate and direct energy flux. As such, it is important to consider the impact that differences in energy flux may have on the quantity and quality of evidence for life. Earth differs from every other body in our solar system in the magnitude of biologically-usable energy flux into a liquid water environment. On a global basis, the capture of light energy into photosynthesis and the flux of chemical energy represented in the products of that photosynthesis (organic material + O2) are about six and four orders of magnitude larger, respectively, than the flux of energy represented in geochemical sources. Our conception of what an inhabited world \"looks like\" and our intuition about how to search for life are based in this high-energy context. Energy fluxes on worlds beyond Earth may be better approximated by the million-fold smaller flux provided to Earth's biosphere by geochemical sources. As a result, the nature, abundance, and quality of evidence for life that could be expected on an inhabited extraterrestrial world within our solar system may differ profoundly from that found on Earth. Understanding this potential difference in quantitative terms provides important context for the formulation of life detection strategies. The influence of energy flux on biosignatures can be evaluated through reference to the two basic purposes into which life partitions energy flux: (1) Life expends energy to sustain existing biomass in a metabolic steady state (metabolically functional but non-growing). The formal representation of this relationship in the traditional microbiology literature equates biomass directly with energy flux. The direct implication is that worlds having lower energy flux will have correspondingly lower potential to support biomass\n\nAcoustic waves in the solar atmosphere. VII - Non-grey, non-LTE H(-) models\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSchmitz, F.; Ulmschneider, P.; Kalkofen, W.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nThe propagation and shock formation of radiatively damped acoustic waves in the solar chromosphere are studied under the assumption that H(-) is the only absorber; the opacity is non-grey. Deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) are permitted. The results of numerical simulations show the depth dependence of the heating by the acoustic waves to be insensitive to the mean state of the atmosphere. After the waves have developed into shocks, their energy flux decays exponentially with a constant damping length of about 1.4 times the pressure scale height, independent of initial flux and wave period. Departures from LTE have a strong influence on the mean temperature structure in dynamical chromosphere models; this is even more pronounced in models with reduced particle density - simulating conditions in magnetic flux tubes - which show significantly increased temperatures in response to mechanical heating. When the energy dissipation of the waves is sufficiently large to dissociate most of the H(-) ions, a strong temperature rise is found that is reminiscent of the temperature structure in the transition zone between chromosphere and corona; the energy flux remaining in the waves then drives mass motions.\n\nGeneration of thermo-acoustic waves from pulsed solar/IR radiation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRahman, Aowabin\n\nAcoustic waves could potentially be used in a wide range of engineering applications; however, the high energy consumption in generating acoustic waves from electrical energy and the cost associated with the process limit the use of acoustic waves in industrial processes. Acoustic waves converted from solar radiation provide a feasible way of obtaining acoustic energy, without relying on conventional nonrenewable energy sources. One of the goals of this thesis project was to experimentally study the conversion of thermal to acoustic energy using pulsed radiation. The experiments were categorized into \"indoor\" and \"outdoor\" experiments, each with a separate experimental setup. The indoor experiments used an IR heater to power the thermo-acoustic lasers and were primarily aimed at studying the effect of various experimental parameters on the amplitude of sound waves in the low frequency range (below 130 Hz). The IR radiation was modulated externally using a chopper wheel and then impinged on a porous solid, which was housed inside a thermo-acoustic (TA) converter. A microphone located at a certain distance from the porous solid inside the TA converter detected the acoustic signals. The \"outdoor\" experiments, which were targeted at TA conversion at comparatively higher frequencies (in 200 Hz-3 kHz range) used solar energy to power the thermo-acoustic laser. The amplitudes (in RMS) of thermo-acoustic signals obtained in experiments using IR heater as radiation source were in the 80-100 dB range. The frequency of acoustic waves corresponded to the frequency of interceptions of the radiation beam by the chopper. The amplitudes of acoustic waves were influenced by several factors, including the chopping frequency, magnitude of radiation flux, type of porous material, length of porous material, external heating of the TA converter housing, location of microphone within the air column, and design of the TA converter. The time-dependent profile of the thermo-acoustic signals\n\nAcoustic power of a moving point source in a moving medium\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCole, J. E., III; Sarris, I. I.\n\n1976-01-01\n\nThe acoustic power output of a moving point-mass source in an acoustic medium which is in uniform motion and infinite in extent is examined. The acoustic medium is considered to be a homogeneous fluid having both zero viscosity and zero thermal conductivity. Two expressions for the acoustic power output are obtained based on a different definition cited in the literature for the average energy-flux vector in an acoustic medium in uniform motion. The acoustic power output of the source is found by integrating the component of acoustic intensity vector in the radial direction over the surface of an infinitely long cylinder which is within the medium and encloses the line of motion of the source. One of the power expressions is found to give unreasonable results even though the flow is uniform.\n\nLow energy intake plus low energy expenditure (low energy flux), not energy surfeit, predicts future body fat gain.\n\nPubMed\n\nHume, David John; Yokum, Sonja; Stice, Eric\n\n2016-06-01\n\nThere is a paucity of studies that have prospectively tested the energy surfeit theory of obesity with the use of objectively estimated energy intake and energy expenditure in humans. An alternative theory is that homeostatic regulation of body weight is more effective when energy intake and expenditure are both high (high energy flux), implying that low energy flux should predict weight gain. We aimed to examine the predictive relations of energy balance and energy flux to future weight gain and tested whether results were replicable in 2 independent samples. Adolescents (n = 154) and college-aged women (n = 75) underwent 2-wk objective doubly labeled water, resting metabolic rate, and percentage of body fat measures at baseline. Percentage of body fat was measured annually for 3 y of follow-up for the adolescent sample and for 2 y of follow-up for the young adult sample. Low energy flux, but not energy surfeit, predicted future increases in body fat in both studies. Furthermore, high energy flux appeared to prevent fat gain in part because it was associated with a higher resting metabolic rate. Counter to the energy surfeit model of obesity, results suggest that increasing energy expenditure may be more effective for reducing body fat than caloric restriction, which is currently the treatment of choice for obesity.

Yet, more recent attention to adaptive structures with unique spatial configurations has motivated mechanical signal processing (MSP) concepts that may not be subjected to the same functional and performance limitations as digital acoustic beamforming counterparts. The periodicity of repeatable structural reconfiguration enabled by origami-inspired tessellated architectures turns attention to foldable platforms as frameworks for MSP development. This research harnesses principles of MSP to study a tessellated, star-shaped acoustic transducer constituent that provides on-demand control of acoustic energy guiding via folding-induced shape reconfiguration. An analytical framework is established to probe the roles of mechanical and acoustic geometry on the far field directivity and near field focusing of sound energy. Following validation by experiments and verification by simulations, parametric studies are undertaken to uncover relations between constituent topology and acoustic energy delivery to arbitrary points in the free field. The adaptations enabled by folding of the star-shaped transducer reveal capability for restricting sound energy to angular regions in the far field while also introducing means to modulate sound energy by three orders-of-magnitude to locations near to the transducer surface. In addition, the modeling philosophy devised here provides a valuable approach to solve general sound radiation problems for foldable, tessellated acoustic transducer constituents of arbitrary geometry.\n\nEnergy Harvesting Hybrid Acoustic-Optical Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks Localization.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaeed, Nasir; Celik, Abdulkadir; Al-Naffouri, Tareq Y; Alouini, Mohamed-Slim\n\n2017-12-26\n\nUnderwater wireless technologies demand to transmit at higher data rate for ocean exploration. Currently, large coverage is achieved by acoustic sensor networks with low data rate, high cost, high latency, high power consumption, and negative impact on marine mammals. Meanwhile, optical communication for underwater networks has the advantage of the higher data rate albeit for limited communication distances. Moreover, energy consumption is another major problem for underwater sensor networks, due to limited battery power and difficulty in replacing or recharging the battery of a sensor node. The ultimate solution to this problem is to add energy harvesting capability to the acoustic-optical sensor nodes. Localization of underwater sensor networks is of utmost importance because the data collected from underwater sensor nodes is useful only if the location of the nodes is known. Therefore, a novel localization technique for energy harvesting hybrid acoustic-optical underwater wireless sensor networks (AO-UWSNs) is proposed. AO-UWSN employs optical communication for higher data rate at a short transmission distance and employs acoustic communication for low data rate and long transmission distance. A hybrid received signal strength (RSS) based localization technique is proposed to localize the nodes in AO-UWSNs. The proposed technique combines the noisy RSS based measurements from acoustic communication and optical communication and estimates the final locations of acoustic-optical sensor nodes. A weighted multiple observations paradigm is proposed for hybrid estimated distances to suppress the noisy observations and give more importance to the accurate observations. Furthermore, the closed form solution for Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived for localization accuracy of the proposed technique.\n\nEnergy Harvesting Hybrid Acoustic-Optical Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks Localization\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSaeed, Nasir; Celik, Abdulkadir; Al-Naffouri, Tareq Y.; Alouini, Mohamed-Slim\n\n2017-01-01\n\nUnderwater wireless technologies demand to transmit at higher data rate for ocean exploration.

Estimation or measurement of these energy fluxes is important for completing the water balance in terrestrial ecosystems, and therefore accurately predicting the effects of global climate and land use change. The objectives of this study were to (1) use METRICtm (Mapping Evapotranspiration at high Resolution using Internalized Calibration) model for estimating land surface energy fluxes in Nebraska (NE) by utilizing satellite remote sensing data, (2) identify model bias in energy balance components compared with measurements from Bowen Ratio Energy Balance System (BREBS) in a subsurface drip-irrigated maize field in South-central Nebraska, and (3) understand the partitioning of available energy into latent heat for corn and soybean cropping systems at large scale. A total of 15 Landsat images were processed to estimate instantaneous surface energy fluxes at Landsat overpasses with METRIC model. Results showed that the model predictions of the surface energy fluxes and daily evapotranspiration were correlated well with the BREBS measurements. There is a need, however, to test the performance of the model with in-situ observations in other locations with different dataset before utilizing it for crucial water regulatory and policy decisions. The METRICtm approach illustrated how an âoff-the-shelfâ model can be applied operationally over a significant time period and how that model behaves. The findings makes considerable contribution to our understanding of estimating land surface energy fluxes using remote sensing approach and experimentally describes the operational characteristics of METRICtm and presents its limitations.\n\nLow energy intake plus low energy expenditure (low energy flux), not energy surfeit, predicts future body fat gain12\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYokum, Sonja; Stice, Eric\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground: There is a paucity of studies that have prospectively tested the energy surfeit theory of obesity with the use of objectively estimated energy intake and energy expenditure in humans.

China's largest freshwater lake, the Poyang lake experiences tremendous water-land transitions periodically throughout the year, which provides natural experimental settings for the study of carbon and energy fluxes. In this study, we use the eddy covariance technique to explore the seasonal and diurnal variation patterns of sensible and latent heat fluxes of Poyang lake during its high-water and low-water periods, when the lake is covered by water and mudflat, respectively. We also determine the annual NEE of Poyang lake and the variations of NEE's components: Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (Re). Controlling factors of seasonal and diurnal variations of carbon and energy fluxes are analyzed, and land cover impacts on the variation patterns are also studied. Finally, the coupling between the carbon and energy fluxes are analyzed under different atmospheric, boundary stability and land cover conditions.\n\nFinite Element Study on Acoustic Energy Harvesting Using Lead-Free Piezoelectric Ceramics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKumar, Anuruddh; Sharma, Anshul; Kumar, Rajeev; Vaish, Rahul\n\n2018-02-01\n\nIn this article, a numerical investigation is performed for ambient acoustic energy harvesting at a low-frequency acoustic signal. A model of a quarter-wavelength resonator with a rectangular cross section is constructed, and piezoelectric-laminated bimorph plates are placed inside the system. Finite element modeling is implemented to numerically formulate the piezoelectric energy harvester. With the application of acoustic pressure at the open end of the resonator, amplified acoustic pressure inside the tube vibrates the piezolaminated bimorphs inside the tube, thus generating electric potential on the piezoelectric layers. To generate higher voltage and power in the acoustic harvester, multiple piezolaminated plates are positioned inside the resonator. The lead-free piezoelectric material K0.475Na0.475Li0.05 (Nb0.92Ta0.05Sb0.03)O3 (KNLNTS) is laminated on the host structure as a layer of piezoelectric material for the acoustic energy harvester. With the application of an acoustic sound pressure of 1 dB at the opening of the tube, a maximum output voltage of 16.3 V is measured at the first natural frequency, while the maximum power calculated is 0.033 mW. Maximum voltage is obtained when five piezoelectric bimorphs are place inside the resonator. At the second natural frequency, the maximum voltage measured is 8.40 V, obtained when eight piezoelectric bimorphs are placed inside the resonator, and the maximum power calculated is 0.020 mW.\n\nTheoretical Estimation of the Acoustic Energy Generation and Absorption Caused by Jet Oscillation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTakahashi, Kin'ya; Iwagami, Sho; Kobayashi, Taizo; Takami, Toshiya\n\n2016-04-01\n\nWe investigate the energy transfer between the fluid field and acoustic field caused by a jet driven by an acoustic particle velocity field across it, which is the key to understanding the aerodynamic sound generation of flue instruments, such as the recorder, flute, and organ pipe. Howe's energy corollary allows us to estimate the energy transfer between these two fields. For simplicity, we consider the situation such that a free jet is driven by a uniform acoustic particle velocity field across it. We improve the semi-empirical model of the oscillating jet, i.e., exponentially growing jet model, which has been studied in the field of musical acoustics, and introduce a polynomially growing jet model so as to apply Howe's formula to it. It is found that the relative phase between the acoustic oscillation and jet oscillation, which changes with the distance from the flue exit, determines the quantity of the energy transfer between the two fields. The acoustic energy is mainly generated in the downstream area, but it is consumed in the upstream area near the flue exit in driving the jet. This theoretical examination well explains the numerical calculation of Howe's formula for the two-dimensional flue instrument model in our previous work [http://doi.org/10.1088/0169-5983/46/6/061411, Fluid Dyn. Res. 46, 061411 (2014)] as well as the experimental result of Yoshikawa et al. [http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsv.2012.01.026, J. Sound Vib. 331, 2558 (2012)].\n\nReverberant acoustic energy in auditoria that comprise systems of coupled rooms\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSummers, Jason E.\n\n2003-11-01\n\nA frequency-dependent model for reverberant energy in coupled rooms is developed and compared with measurements for a 1:10 scale model and for Bass Hall, Ft. Worth, TX. At high frequencies, prior statistical-acoustics models are improved by geometrical-acoustics corrections for decay within sub-rooms and for energy transfer between sub-rooms. Comparisons of computational geometrical acoustics predictions based on beam-axis tracing with scale model measurements indicate errors resulting from tail-correction assuming constant quadratic growth of reflection density. Using ray tracing in the late part corrects this error. For mid-frequencies, the models are modified to account for wave effects at coupling apertures by including power transmission coefficients. Similarly, statical-acoustics models are improved through more accurate estimates of power transmission measurements. Scale model measurements are in accord with the predicted behavior. The edge-diffraction model is adapted to study transmission through apertures. Multiple-order scattering is theoretically and experimentally shown inaccurate due to neglect of slope diffraction. At low frequencies, perturbation models qualitatively explain scale model measurements. Measurements confirm relation of coupling strength to unperturbed pressure distribution on coupling surfaces. Measurements in Bass Hall exhibit effects of the coupled stage house. High frequency predictions of statistical acoustics and geometrical acoustics models and predictions of coupling apertures all agree with measurements.\n\nTransition region fluxes in A-F Dwarfs: Basal fluxes and dynamo activity\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWalter, Frederick M.; Schrijver, Carolus J.; Boyd, William\n\n1988-01-01\n\nThe transition region spectra of 87 late A and early F dwarfs and subgiants were analyzed. The emission line fluxes are uniformly strong in the early F stars, and drop off rapidly among the late A stars. The basal flux level in the F stars is consistent with an extrapolation of that observed among the G stars, while the magnetic component displays the same flux-flux relations seen among solar-like stars. Despite the steep decrease in transition region emission flux for B-V less than 0.28, C II emission is detected in alpha Aql (B-V = 0.22). The dropoff in emission is inconsistent with models of the mechanically generated acoustic flux available. It is concluded that, although the nonmagnetic basal heating is an increasingly important source of atmospheric heating among the early F stars, magnetic heating occurs in any star which has a sufficiently thick convective zone to generate acoustic heating.\n\nSolar neutrino flux at keV energies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVitagliano, Edoardo; Redondo, Javier; Raffelt, Georg\n\n2017-12-01\n\nWe calculate the solar neutrino and antineutrino flux in the keV energy range. The dominant thermal source processes are photo production (Î³ eâ e Î½bar nu), bremsstrahlung (e+Zeâ Ze+e+Î½bar nu), plasmon decay (Î³âÎ½bar nu), and Î½bar nu emission in free-bound and bound-bound transitions of partially ionized elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. These latter processes dominate in the energy range of a few keV and thus carry information about the solar metallicity. To calculate their rate we use libraries of monochromatic photon radiative opacities in analogy to a previous calculation of solar axion emission. Our overall flux spectrum and many details differ significantly from previous works. While this low-energy flux is not measurable with present-day technology, it could become a significant background for future direct searches for keV-mass sterile neutrino dark matter.\n\nEnergy relaxation mechanisms in capacitively shunted flux qubits\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCorcoles, Antonio; Rozen, Jim; Rothwell, Mary Beth; Keefe, George; di Vincenzo, David; Ketchen, Mark; Chow, Jerry; Rigetti, Chad; Rohrs, Jack; Borstelmann, Mark; Steffen, Matthias; IBM Quantum Computing Group Team\n\n2011-03-01\n\nEnergy losses in superconducting qubits remain a major object of study in the road towards scalable, highly coherent qubit devices. The current understanding of the loss mechanisms in these devices is far from being complete and it is sometimes difficult to experimentally separate the different contributions to decoherence. Here we compare a traditional three Josephson-junction flux qubit to the recently implemented capacitively shunted flux qubit, whose energy decay is thought to be limited by dielectric losses arising from native oxides in the shunting capacitor. Keeping all parameters identical except for the shunting capacitance, we obtain energy relaxation times that are comparable for both types of qubit. This suggests that the energy relaxation time is not limited by junction losses in capacitively shunted flux qubits. We discuss some other possible loss mechanisms present in these devices.\n\nSurface energy fluxes and their representation in CMIP5 models\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWild, M.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nEnergy fluxes at the Earth surface play a key role in the determination of surface climate and in the coupling of atmosphere, land and ocean components. Unlike their counterparts at the top of atmosphere (TOA), surface fluxes cannot be directly measured from satellites, but have to be inferred from the space-born observations using additional models to account for atmospheric perturbations, or from the limited number of surface observations. Uncertainties in the energy fluxes at the surface have therefore traditionally been larger than at the TOA, and have limited our knowledge on the distribution of the energy flows within the climate system. Accordingly, current climate models still largely differ in their representation of surface and atmospheric energy fluxes. Since the mid-1990s, accurate flux measurements became increasingly available from surface networks such as BSRN, which allow to better constrain the surface energy fluxes. There is, however, still a lack of flux measurements particularly over oceans. Further, the larger-scale representativeness of the station records needs to be assessed to judge their suitability as anchor sites for gridded flux products inferred from satellites, reanalyses and climate models. In addition, historic records need to be carefully quality-checked and homogeneized. In parallel, satellite-derived products of surface fluxes profit from the great advancement in space-born observations since the turn of the millennium, and from improved validation capabilities with surface observations. Ultimately, it is the combination of surface and space-born observations, reanalyses and modeling approaches that will advance our knowledge on the distribution of the surface energy fluxes. Uncertainties remain in the determination of surface albedo, skin temperatures and the"
