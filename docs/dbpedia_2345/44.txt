Kind of the whole story of the war. The germans had the biggest and best, the Allies had the most.

Men of the 1st Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment, 4th Infantry Division enjoy a tot of rum in a section of trench named 'Pudding Lane', near Roubaix, a commune in the Nord department in northern France.

The 1st Battalion was part of the 10th Infantry Brigade, 4th Infantry Division of the British Expeditionary Force in France in 1940, returning to Britain via Dunkirk. After returning to the United Kingdom, the 1st Queen's Own was transferred to the 12th Infantry Brigade, still part of the 4th Division. It remained in Britain until 1943, leaving to take part in the Tunisian Campaign, the Italian Campaign and the Greek Civil War that broke out after the German withdrawal in 1944.
