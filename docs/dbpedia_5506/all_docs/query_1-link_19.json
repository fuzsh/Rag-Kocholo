The store, a\n\ncommunity fixture for decades, closed in the mid-70s.\n\n***********************************\n\nBy DAWN SHURMAITIS\n\nTimes Leader Staff Writer he father — James Musto — was a scrapper who\n\nspent his youth in the coal mines before breaking a Republican stronghold in\n\nthe former 3rd Legislative District to take his place in the state House.\n\nThe sons — second-generation Italian-Americans, Pittston Township born and\n\nbred — all worked in the family store, butchering meat, delivering groceries,\n\nstocking shelves, before entering college.\n\nAll six became successes, in business, politics, education.\n\nRaphael Musto followed his father’s lead, and is now an influential state\n\nsenator. Biagio is an official with the state Department of Education, Gerard\n\nis a school superintendent. John is the manager of a local restaurant. And\n\nJames is a teacher in Scranton.\n\nSon number five — Joseph J., a respected attorney for 24 years — aspires\n\nto become Luzerne County’s newest judge.\n\nSome say it’s more than a hope, it’s a wrap.\n\nWith his brother’s powerful political connections, Musto, they say, has the\n\njudgeship sewn up: Gov. Robert Casey, a Democrat, will appoint him to the open\n\nspot on the bench, the Democratic-controlled Senate will vote to confirm him\n\nand the Musto legacy will continue.\n\nAnd rightly so, say Musto supporters.\n\n“It hurts me when I read he’s going to be a judge just because his brother\n\nis a senator,” says Mae McHugh, who’s known Joe Musto since he was a boy\n\ndelivering groceries to her house on Bryden Street.\n\n“Those kids came up. They didn’t have special clothes, special schools.\n\nThere were no cars at 16. That home was no castle. They were never big shots.\n\n“If there’s any justice that man will be judge. And that’s the truth as God\n\nis my judge.”\n\nEven his political opponents say Joe Musto, age 49, has the right stuff to\n\nbecome judge, brother or no brother.\n\n“A lot of people are going to cry because of Ray Musto’s position. But\n\nthat’s just politics,” says Luzerne County Commissioner Jim Phillips, who was\n\naccused of nepotism when his son was appointed county solicitor.\n\n“I think Joe Musto is a highly qualified person and would make an excellent\n\njudge.\n\n“And I’m a Republican.”\n\nThe judge lineup\n\nWhen Judge Bernard Brominski retired in October, he left a void on the\n\ncounty bench five local lawyers are vying to fill.\n\nOne of those men must get the nod from the governor and then capture a\n\ntwo-thirds majority vote of the Senate, which doesn’t reconvene until Jan. 5.\n\nWhoever is appointed would serve until January 1994. In the interim, an\n\nelection for the 10-year term would be held. Historically, the appointed judge\n\nwins the nomination in May as well as the November election.\n\nBesides Joe Musto, the Special Trial Court Nominating Commission two weeks\n\nago interviewed attorneys Charles Bufalino, Michael Conahan, Joe Giovannini\n\nand Tom Makowski for the job, which pays $80,000 and could rise to $99,500 if\n\na bill proposing a salary hike is passed.\n\nFulfilling the dream\n\nFor Musto, a partner with Rosenn, Jenkins & Greenwald, the largest law firm\n\nin Northeastern Pennsylvania, even $80,000 would mean a substantial pay cut.\n\nBut, he says, “money isn’t everything.”\n\nTo Musto, a judgeship represents the pinnacle of his profession. It would\n\nalso mean the fulfillment of his father’s dream.\n\n“My father was in awe of the legal system,” says Musto. “He looked up to\n\nthe law. He wanted me to go to law school and be a lawyer.”\n\nIn 1969, when Musto brought his soon-to-be wife home to meet the family she\n\ngained his father’s instant approval as soon as he learned she too was a\n\nlawyer.\n\n“He opened his eyes, smiled and that was it,” says Musto. “He was happy.”\n\nMusto met his wife when both worked as assistant district attorneys in the\n\nPhiladelphia D.A.’s office. Today, Fortunata Musto works part-time as a\n\ndomestic relations master in Luzerne County Court. She presides over judicial\n\nhearings to determine support payments.\n\nMusto says should he be appointed or elected, his wife will keep her job.\n\nThere is no conflict, he says, because only Orphans Court Judge Chester\n\nMuroski would preside over any of his wife’s cases.\n\nIf a conflict did arise, Musto would recuse himself from the case.\n\nThe normally soft-spoken Musto — whose many admirers often use the term\n\n“helluva nice guy” to describe him — grows visibly impassioned when\n\ndiscussing his famous brother and suggestions his nomination is a lock because\n\nof the senator’s influence.\n\n“I felt confident I could submit my qualifications to anybody: the\n\ncommittee, the governor, the Senate,” he says. “The fact that I am related to\n\na state senator is not relevant, not applicable.”\n\nThe criticism levied against him is, to Musto, “unfair. I shouldn’t be\n\ndisadvantaged because a member of my family is in an elected position.\n\n“I understand what people are saying. And I am very proud of what my\n\nbrother has done. He’s been an excellent senator and he works hard for his\n\nconstituents.\n\n“But I’m not doing this for him. I’m doing this for me, for what I’ve done,\n\nfor my qualifications.”\n\nJoe Musto’s background\n\nA distinguished law school student who graduated first in his senior class,\n\nMusto served as law clerk to a Dauphin County and a Supreme Court judge. In\n\n1969, he returned home to become an associate and later partner in the\n\nBedford, Waller, Griffith, Darling & Mitchell law firm. Before moving to his\n\npresent firm, Musto was a principal with Griffith, Aponick & Musto.\n\nMusto has appeared in court in Luzerne, Wyoming, Lackawanna, Monroe and\n\nSchuylkill counties as well as in the federal court of the Middle District. By\n\nhis own estimates he’s argued approximately 200 jury trials and appeared in\n\ncourt more than 1,000 times. His primary duties in his law firm’s litigation\n\ndepartment are in the area of insurance defense.\n\nFollowing in his father’s footsteps (James Musto’s proudest achievement was\n\npassage of the monthly Black Lung benefits for afflicted miners), Musto has\n\nhandled numerous black lung cases, as well as Social Security and workmen’s\n\ncompensation cases.\n\nSolicitor of the Pittston Area Schools since 1973, the same district where\n\nhis brother Gerard is superintendent, Musto also serves as assistant county\n\nsolicitor.\n\n“Law is so exciting,” says Musto. “I’ve had cases where I’ve had to learn\n\nabout medicine, physics, engineering. It’s fascinating to be able to put all\n\nthat information together.\n\n“It’s very challenging and very rewarding.”\n\nMusto is confident he would be a “competent, fair and impartial judge” —\n\nthe same words supporters use to describe his qualifications.\n\nEven if he isn’t appointed judge, Musto says he will “seriously consider”\n\nrunning for election. It won’t be his first taste of politics.\n\nOne way or another, Musto has been involved in politics since he was 5 —\n\nwhen his father first won election to the state House. He was heavily involved\n\nwith his brother’s first run for the state House in 1971, his congressional\n\nrace in 1980 and all of his subsequent races for senator.\n\nIn 1976, Musto himself won election to the county’s seven-member government\n\nstudy commission.\n\n“I’m not fearful of entering politics,” says Musto. “In fact, I’m excited\n\nabout it.”\n\nSenator Musto — the family patriarch since his father’s death in 1971 —\n\nsays he’s worried his relationship and his position will become a campaign\n\nissue should his brother win the appointment.\n\n“I’m a chain around his neck,” he says. “If I wasn’t a senator, he’d have\n\nsmooth sailing. He doesn’t need me to be a judge. He’s the candidate, he’s the\n\none who has to go before the people.\n\nBut no worry, says Ray Musto, “We come from good stock.”\n\nThe family history\n\nRose Frushon Musto, now 86, still lives in the Musto family home on Bryden\n\nStreet in Pittston Township, where the clan (including 30 grandchildren and\n\ngreat-grandchildren) continues to gather on holidays and weekends.\n\nA native of the Old Boston section of Exeter, she met her husband in the\n\nneighborhood between Cork Lane and Browntown where he grew up.\n\nMarried in 1921, Rose Musto has lived to see her husband and her sons all\n\nrise to prominence. It wasn’t an easy life.\n\nAfter spending his teens in the mines, James Musto battled with the mining\n\ncompanies, and lost his livelihood.\n\n“It was a very difficult time for us,” says Musto of his father’s labor\n\nefforts. “He took on the coal company and he was blackballed. But he took it\n\nto the grave with him, his concern for miners.”\n\nBanned from the mines, James Musto turned to business, opening a barbershop\n\nand a grocery store.\n\nWorking in the family store was family law. And no one broke the law.\n\n“We all did it,” says Joe Musto. “It was a way to support the family. We\n\ndidn’t have a lot of money. But that little store put food on the table.\n\n“It was an interesting job. It helped me be more outgoing. It was the\n\nschool of life.”\n\nJames Musto, first elected a Pittston Township school director in 1937,\n\nwent on to serve 10 consecutive terms in the state House of Representatives.\n\nWhen he died, the Speaker of the House said, “An effective voice,\n\nespecially for the coal unions, has been stilled.”\n\nTo visit his mom, Joe Musto needs only to drive about a mile from his\n\ntwo-story home in Pittston where he lives with his wife and two children:\n\nLaura, 18, a student at King’s College and an aspiring writer, and Robby, 12,\n\na student at Pittston Area Middle School.\n\nAs a parent, Musto hopes he’s instilled the same “good old-fashioned values\n\nof honesty and hard work” in his children that his father instilled in him.\n\nJoe was child number seven. Ray, Louise, James Jr., Antoinette, Gerard,\n\nBiagio came before and John came after. The six boys shared one bedroom, the\n\ntwo girls and the parents the other two.\n\nToday, Musto works in a seventh-floor corner office with a commanding view\n\nof the Susquehanna River and the Market Street Bridge. A large framed photo of\n\nThe Three Stooges — a favorite of Musto and his son — dominates one wall.\n\nAlong another wall hangs a framed piece of torn shirt — the same shirt\n\nMusto wore during his first solo airplane flight in 1984.\n\n“It was something I always wanted to do,” he says of his pilot’s license.\n\n“Finally, I did.”"
