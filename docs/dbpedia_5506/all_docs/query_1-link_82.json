        "text": "I'I have two buddies on the Walk of Honor, John F Ward and Michael Galea. Michael Galea enlisted in the Marines, right out of high school, was a rifleman, and was wounded in August 1968. He was send home still in a coma, and died stateside January 5th, 1969. John Ward and I were best Bronx neighborhood buddies and knew we had to go to Nam and take revenge. So we enlisted together on the Buddy System a few weeks later. It never works out the way you thought in war. We both went to basic training and AIT together, flew to Nam together. We were both assigned to the 101st Airborne, the same regiment, but a different battalion. You couldn’t be in the same combat unit on the buddy system back then. John went to the 2/327th and I to the 2/502nd. John was killed on October 6th, 1969 during a night time ambush operation.\n\nBill Nelson VVA126\n\nMy childhood friend is on the Wall of Honor. Lance Corporal Philip Brownfeld, USMC, was Killed in Action in Vietnam March 6, 1967.\n\n​\n\nDear Philip,\n\nWe were teenage friends, full of life, health, and great expectations for our futures. We always were in contact with each other even when you enlisted in Marines and I enlisted in the Navy.\n\n​\n\nBoth of us were looking forward to meeting each other again one day. That one day came, when your father asked me to part in your funeral detail. There are no words that I can express to a hero and patriotic warrior. Rest in Peace Philip, I will always remember you.\n\n​\n\nJoe\n\nJoe Kosinsky VVA126"
