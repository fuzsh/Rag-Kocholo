        "text": "Grammy Award winning soprano Ana María Martinez has been acclaimed by The New York Times as an artist who creates “theatrical magic.” She is a winner of the 15th annual Opera News Awards, and her international career sees a diverse lineup of opera’s leading ladies at the world’s most important opera houses and concert halls. The 2022/23 season saw her return to the stage of the Metropolitan Opera to sing the role of Donna Elvira in a new production of Don Giovanni by Ivo van Hove, conducted by Nathalie Stutzmann. Ms. Martinez also returned to LA Opera to sing the Countess in a new production of The Marriage of Figaro conducted by music director James Conlon. Ms. Martinez made appearances at the Toronto Summer Music Festival for a concert with pianist Craig Terry and as a guest teaching artist, as well as a recital with the Santa Fe Chamber Music Society, and as a Mosher Guest Artist with Music Academy of the West.\n\nPerformance highlights of the 2021/22 season include the title role in Florencia en el Amazonas with Lyric Opera of Chicago and a role debut as Despina in Cosi fan tutte with Washington National Opera. On stage during 2020/21 season, in the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, Ms. Martínez was thrilled to join San Diego Opera as Mimi in their production of La Bohème, in the world’s first-ever drive-in opera production! Virtual performances during the season included a “Living Room Recital” with LA Opera performed in Ana María’s home and available digitally. She curated two Spanish-themed virtual programs, the first, with pianist Craig Terry for Lyric Opera of Chicago, entitled Pasión Latina, featured a dynamic selection of music from Puerto Rico, Mexico, Cuba, Guatemala, Argentina and Spain. The second program, created by Ana María for Houston Grand Opera, entitled Suite Española, featured music of Spain, including zarzuela, and starred Ana María alongside HGO Studio artists. Additional performances during the season included her role debut as Tosca with Opera Philadelphia, which she performed again later in the season with Cincinnati Opera, as well as Nedda in Pagliacci with Palm Beach Opera.\n\nThe inaugural recipient of the Lynn Wyatt Great Artist Award from Houston Grand Opera and Lynn and Oscar Wyatt, Ms. Martinez’s relationship with HGO goes back to 1994 when she won first prize in the Eleanor McCollum Auditions and Awards Competition, and in 2015 established the Ana María Martínez Encouragement Award as part of that same competition. The scholarship is awarded annually to a young singer with great artistic promise, and is to be used towards the furthering of his or her artistic training. On the Houston Grand Opera stage Ms. Martínez continues to portray some of her most beloved characters, often under the baton of Artistic and Music Director Patrick Summers. It was there that she debuted the title role of Carmen, as well as the role of Cio-Cio-San, which she since has performed around the world. She joined them as the title role in Rusalka, Rosina in The Barber of Seville, Nedda in Pagliacci, Mimi in La Bohème, Donna Elvira in Don Giovanni, the Countess in The Marriage of Figaro, Liù in Turandot, Lucero in the world premiere of Daniel Catán’s Salsipuedes, and as both Rosalba and later the title role in Florencia en el Amazonas, both of which were recorded for commercial release.\n\nMs. Martínez is delighted to perform season after season with Lyric Opera of Chicago. Recent performances include Cio-Cio-San in Madama Butterfly, Donna Elvira in a new Robert Falls production of Don Giovanni, her role debut as Desdemona in Otello, as well as Tatyana in Eugene Onegin, Mimi in La Bohème, Nedda in Pagliacci, Fiordiligi in Cosi fan tutte and Marguerite in Faust. She made her role debut as Elisabetta in Don Carlo with San Francisco Opera, conducted by Nicola Luisotti, and also joined them as Amelia in Simon Boccanegra, Micaëla in Carmen, as Donna Elvira in Don Giovanni, and as Pamina in The Magic Flute. She made her debut with the Metropolitan Opera as Micaëla in Carmen and returned to the house as Musetta in La Bohème and Cio-Cio-San. She joined Washington National Opera as Liù in Turandot and Cio-Cio San, and she made her debut with Santa Fe Opera as Fiordiligi in Così fan tutte, returning there as Rosina in a new production of The Barber of Seville, Donna Elvira in Don Giovanni, Mimi in La Bohème, as Cio-Ci-San, and as the title role in Carmen. Additional leading roles in the United States have taken her for multiples seasons to the stages of Opera de Puerto Rico, Dallas Opera, and Florida Grand Opera, among many others.\n\nCareer highlights from stages across Europe include her critically acclaimed role and house debut as Rusalka with the Glyndebourne Festival, which was recorded live and released on the Glyndebourne label. She returned to Glyndebourne in the leading role of Paolina in the United Kingdom’s first professionally staged performances of Donizetti’s Poliuto, also recorded live and released on DVD. She made her debut at Teatro Colon in Buenos Aires as Rusalka, and her debut with the Opera National de Paris as Amelia in a new production of Simon Boccanegra, returning as the title role in a new production of Luisa Miller, as Mimi in La Bohème, and for her role debut as Antonia in The Tales of Hoffmann.
