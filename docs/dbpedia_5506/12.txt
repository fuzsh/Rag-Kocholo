WILKES-BARRE, Pa. â€” A federal judge has ruled that an ailing former northeastern Pennsylvania senator in prison on corruption charges can return home for an examination by his own doctors.

Attorneys for 85-year-old Raphael Musto say he has cancer and may have as little as two months to live.

A federal judge on Friday approved his lawyers' request that he be released from a federal medical prison in North Carolina, where he was sent in January after being declared mentally unfit to stand trial.

While there, he was diagnosed with advanced-stage lymph cell cancer.

Musto is in custody on charges he accepted cash and other perks for helping obtain taxpayer money for development projects, and took additional cash for helping a municipality get state loans.
