Wayne Albee, (1882-1937), fine-art photographer of Tacoma had also joined the McBride studio by 1919 as partner and chief photographer. Albee moved to San Diego in 1925, and McBride continued to operate a studio in various Seattle locations. Others associated with her studio included the brilliant Pictoralist, Frank Asakichi Kunishige (1878-1960) and Soichi Sunami (1885-1971), who would become a major force in the field of dance photography.\n\nHer main interest for subject matter centered on floral studies, for which she seems to have had immediate success. Her love of flowers likely stemmed from her recollection of the abundant flora in the foothills of Mt. Rainier. She later recalled, “we were just right out in the rain and picked flowers and the flowers were just gorgeous. it was just a blaze of flowers, you couldn’t step without stepping on flowers or pitch a little tent without the floor covered with flowers” (Molenaar Audio Interview). In 1932 she partnered with Richard Anderson (1908-1970); they continued to work together until she retired in 1954 due to her failing eyesight. She died at the age of 102.\n\nThis is possibly Roy and Ray McClinton or Amberson L. McClinton. Roy, Ray and Amberson were sons of James G. McClinton and moved from Aurora, Nevada to Quilcene in 1889 and later to Port Angeles, Washington. Ray and Roy were the youngest in the family and were fraternal twins who photographed mostly around Clallam County. This included Port Angeles school photographs, and the surrounding woods and outdoors. Amberson McClinton was Roy and Ray's older brother, and happened to be a twin as well with brother, Myron. Amberson was a customs and steamship official for the Seattle Port Commission and the deputy collector of customs for Port Townsend. He arrived in Seattle in 1894 and worked for the Alaska Steamship Company as a purser on the S.S. Rosalie from 1897-1900. In 1915 he was put in charge of the Bell Street Dock, Seattle. Amberson died June 5, 1920.\n\nActive at 514 9th St., Seattle, Washington. McDonald is listed only in the 1892-93 Corbett Seattle Directory. Some of his images are also stamped \"A.J. McDonald & Son.\" Perhaps the economic panic of 1893 drove him back to California. The California State Library preserves a large collection of his San Francisco subjects, but only a few Seattle scenes survive in local collections. Probably most of his Seattle subjects were taken during the photographers brief stay here.\n\nMcDonald is well known for his stereoviews of California. He is one of the few photographers who recorded a view of the 1863 Cliff House and the Cliff House to Ferry Railroad in San Francisco, California.\n\nMyers was born in Tuscarawas county, Ohio on November 4, 1857. He was one of four sons born to John and Mary Myers. He learned photography early on from his uncle, Austin Kracaw. He then moved to Chicago where he studied under various photographers including Rider's and Stefifens'. He started his own business in Peoria, Illinois, where he remained for three years. He afterward returned to his old home town of Washington, Iowa, and later to Biloxi, Mississippi, where he lived for six years. In August of 1902, he purchased the Vassar Northrup Studio at 1414 Hewitt Avenue in Everett, opening Myers Art Studio from 1902-1926.\n\nCharles Robert Pratsch (1857-1937 ) was active at F Street, between Heron and Wishkah, Aberdeen, Washington, 1888-1913.

Darling, and the two homesteaded adjacent claims on the Wishkah River in the Grays Harbor country, 1884. Pratsch had paid Tolman $300 to teach him photography techniques, and built a studio in 1890 to \"attend to all classes of work, such as portraits, views, buildings, copying, enlarging, reducing, etc., and charges very reasonable prices\". In his later years Charles Robert Pratsch was caretaker of the Laidlow Island duck preserve. He died at the age of 79 a few days after walking into a slowly moving train. His son, Fred Pratsch, acquired the negatives and made prints which he reproduced as oil paintings.\n\nPrentiss (1865-1940) was active at 45 4th St., Portland, Oregon, 1922. Prentiss joined the Weister Company in 1913, and by 1917, he joined Benjamin A. Gifford, the most famous photographer of Oregon at that time, creating Gifford-Prentiss Inc.

Bonsall. He found that the studio darkroom was not adventurous enough for him, and following some of the paths that no other white man had been, other than Lewis & Clark, he went out into Native American Indian territories disguised as a hunter on vacation. He hid his camera equipment in his custom built buggy. Some Indian nations had never seen a white man before. He quickly became known as “picture man”, (to the natives) whom he soon began to have friendships with. He is known for his work including the motion photography of the Cherokee Outlet, 1893, (also known as the Cherokee Strip) where he had a 3 story platform erected for the occasion. William made over 10,000 pictures, and is said to be responsible for creating the news photography genre.\n\nFrank La Roche was proprietor of The Rainier Studios and active at 707 Second St., Between Columbia and Cherry, Seattle, Washington, circa 1885-91.\n\nLa Roche (1853-1936), arrived in Seattle just after the great fire of June 1889 to find the city in ashes, but soon opened a gallery in the Kilgen block on 2nd Avenue. His studio, in addition to high-class portrait photography, specialized in scenic and industrial views of western Washington state. He produced extensive views of the Seattle waterfront, streets and buildings, early Everett land speculation, ships, logging activities, and American Indians. In addition, he traveled in Alaska, California, the western United States, and along the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway, taking scenic views which he produced for sale to travelers.\n\nSee also the Frank La Roche Photograph Collection.\n\nReid (1859-1944) was an American geophysicist. He was notable for his contributions to seismology, particularly his theory of elastic rebound that related faults to earthquakes. In 1890 & 1892, Harry Fielding Reid traveled to Glacier Bay, Alaska. During the expedition, Reid mapped Glacier Bay, collaborated with John Muir, measured the movement of the glaciers, created sketches and made photographs of the glaciers, and produced 24 notebooks. The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) has transcribed his expedition notebooks.\n\nThrough his mother, Harry Fielding Reid was a great-great-grandnephew of George Washington. He earned a B.A. in 1880 as part of the second graduating class of John Hopkins University. In 1885 he was granted his Ph.D. with a dissertation on the spectra of platinum. 1886 Reid accepted an appointment at the Case School of Applied Science in Cleveland, Ohio. He taught physics and mathematics there for eight years before being appointed an Associate at Johns Hopkins.\n\nCharles Roscoe Savage (1832-1909) met and partnered with painter Charles Ottinger, who tinted Savages photographs, in Great Salt Lake City, Utah, 1859-1864.\n\nCharles R. Savage and George Ottinger operated the Savage and Ottinger Studio in Salt Lake City, Utah., circa 1860s. Ottinger left and ended their short and tumultuous business partnership in 1864 to pursue acting and the photo studio was renamed Pioneer Art Gallery. Savage continued running the studio and traveled through Utah, California, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wyoming photographing landscapes and documenting Native Americans and pioneer life. In 1883 the Pioneer Art Gallery burned down, and many negatives were lost in the fire. Savage reopened the studio as the Art Bazar. Savage was also a mentor to several successful photographers including George Edward Anderson. He ran the studio until 1906 when his sons, Ralph and George Savage took over. Savage was awarded prizes for his photographs in several World Fairs including Chicago, St. Louis and San Francisco. Sadly much of Savages photographic work was destroyed when a fire struck his studio in 1883.\n\nAl Smith never considered himself a photographer, merely someone who enjoyed taking photographs. After sailing around the Pacific Rim as a steward on merchant vessels as a young man, Smith returned to Seattle with a new camera and a desire to capture his home city on film. Over the course of several decades, Smith amassed tens of thousands of prints and negatives with his On the Spot photography side business, many finding their way to the Museum of History & Industry (where he was a volunteer for more than a decade), the Northwest African American Museum and in a traveling exhibit that chronicles Seattle’s Jackson Street night scene from the 1920's to the 1960's. His love of the early nightclub scene in Seattle led to photographs of such iconic performers as Cab Calloway and Duke Ellington. Smith is considered by many to have been responsible for single-handedly chronicling African-American community life in Seattle for a half-century, a brilliantly expressive documentary photographer whose work celebrates the neighborhood and people who inspired him. Never without a camera around his neck, Smith also shot birthday parties and family reunions, pickup basketball games, boxing matches and countless weddings in his spare time. Al Smith died on August 28, 2008, at the age of 92.\n\nJ.P. Soule (1828-1904) was active at 528 Broadway, Seattle, Washington, and was a publisher in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nSoule maintained studios on Washington Street in Boston, circa 1861-1882. His subjects in Boston included buildings, the 1869 National Peace Jubilee, the great fire of 1872, and carte-de-visite portraits, and published stereoviews.

He moved to Atlin, British Columbia in 1924 where he set up a photography studio. Due to a similar photographer stamp and style, it is likely Gilbert Morris Taylor bought photographer L.C. Read's photography studio in Atlin shortly before Read's death. He stayed in Atlin until 1930 when he transferred his studio to Jasper. In 1936 he built his own studio at #630 Connaught Drive. This studio he sold to Tom Johnston of Saskatoon, SK in 1948 and moved with his wife, Helen Emelyn Hickey, to Santa Barbara, California. He had two sons, R. Loring and W. Morris Taylor.

For a while after the New Westminster studio had been destroyed by fire on September 11, 1898, he maintained a Vancouver and a New Westminster studio. Thompson was a prolific and versatile photographer equally at home in portrait and landscape work. He photographed extensively along the Canadian Pacific Railway throughout the 1890s. Thompson visited the Chicago Worlds Fair in 1893. Two years later he was commissioned to obtain views of farms around Edmonton.
