        "text": "Catholic schools possess a unique and distinct character. They are places where Christ is at the centre, where the Catholic faith and the values that Jesus taught us is integral to all that is done. They are part of the evangelising Mission of the Church; a Mission through which the person of Jesus Christ is made known and loved. Catholic schools are committed to the formation of the whole person; a formation that encompasses the spiritual, intellectual, physical, social, moral, aesthetic, emotional and religious capacity of each child and young person.\n\nThe DDfE Catholic Education work includes Religious Education policy and support, Relationships, Sex and Health Education policy and support, Catholic life and mission, Prayer and Liturgy, and Catholic School Inspection.\n\nThese are the five core principles that underpin our Diocesan Catholic schools:\n\nThe search for excellence as an integral part of the spiritual quest.\n\nThe uniqueness of the individual made in God’s image and loved by him.\n\nThe education of the whole person based on the belief that the human and divine are inseparable.\n\nThe education of all with the particular duty to care for the poor and disadvantaged.\n\nMoral principles put into practice within a Christian community.\n\nAt the heart of Catholic Education lies the Christian vision of the human person. This vision is explored in Religious Education (RE) making RE the core subject in a Catholic school. The specific contribution to the life of the Catholic school of curriculum RE is primarily educational. Its primary purpose is to draw pupils into a systematic study of Catholic Christianity and to explore the contribution of Christianity and other religions to culture, personal commitment, and action in everyday life.\n\nThe Religious Education Curriculum Directory (RECD 2012) makes the aims of Religious Education explicit:\n\nTo present a comprehensive content which is the basis of knowledge and understanding of the Catholic faith;\n\nTo enable pupils continually to deepen their religious and theological understanding and be able to communicate this effectively;\n\nTo present an authentic vision of the Church’s moral and social teaching so that pupils can make a critique of the underlying trends in contemporary culture and society;\n\nTo raise pupils’ awareness of the faith and traditions of other religious communities in order to respect and understand them;\n\nTo develop the critical faculties of pupils so that they can relate their Catholic faith to daily life;\n\nTo stimulate pupils’ imagination and provoke a desire for personal meaning as revealed in the truth of the Catholic faith;\n\nTo enable pupils to relate the knowledge gained through Religious Education to their understanding of other subjects in the curriculum;\n\nTo bring clarity to the relationship between faith and life, and between faith and culture.\n\nThe outcome of excellent Religious Education is religiously literate and engaged young people who have the knowledge, understanding and skills – appropriate to their age and capacity – to reflect spiritually, and think ethically and theologically, and who are aware of the demands of religious commitment in everyday life (RECD 2012 p6).\n\nIn the Diocese of Hexham and Newcastle, we aim for our schools to provide excellent teaching in Relationships Education, Relationships and Sex Education and Health Education. Relationships Education, Relationships and Sex Education, and Health Education is part of the mission of Catholic schools to educate the whole person. It should be carried out as part of the holistic education which seeks to form as well as inform young people in preparation for adult life.\n\nThe CES provides the following guidance:\n\nIn order for Catholic relationships education, relationships and sex education and health education to be fully effective it needs to:\n\nbe faithful to the Church’s vision of human wholeness whilst recognising the contemporary context in which we live today;\n\ninvolve parents as they are primary educators of their child;\n\nprovide a positive view of human sexuality and dignity of the human person;\n\nequip young people with the ability to make practical judgments about the right thing to do in particular circumstances;\n\nexplore and promote virtues which are essential to promoting respect and dignity;\n\nbe delivered in an age appropriate way which reflects the development of the child;\n\nbe part of the cross-curricular work in both primary and secondary schools;\n\nbe sensitive to the needs of the individual pupil and recognise the mix of pupils with different sexual orientations, genders and family backgrounds in each class\n\nResources and guidance\n\nRelationships Education, Relationships and Sex Education and Health Education Guidance for Primary Schools\n\nPrimary Curriculum Framework for Relationships Education, Relationships and Sex Education and Health Education (Updated May 2021)\n\nDFE Statutory Guidance\n\nApproved Resources\n\nLearning 2 Love – An introduction to Catholic Relationship and Sex Education (RSE) for Catholic Educators\n\nSchool Chaplains are called to be witnesses of the love and care of God and his Church for the school community. Our Catholic schools are a fundamental part of the mission of the Church and the vision of Chaplaincy held by the school must be rooted in Gospel values. The ministry of the Chaplain demands that he or she is a catalyst for action and reflection and will both enthuse and challenge the whole community to respond to God’s call to discipleship in a Catholic context. This is achieved by the witness of the Chaplain’s own life and also by his or her involvement in the spiritual, liturgical and pastoral life of the school and by being available to all members of the school community.\n\nSchool Chaplaincy is a ministry of the Catholic Church, and those who work in it require a mandate from the Diocesan Bishop. School Chaplaincy personnel are appointed by, and are employees of the Governing Body. In the school, they work with the Headteacher and are ordinarily accountable to him/her. In their work, they are guided by the policies and decisions of the Governors and the Senior Management Team. However, their fundamental mandate comes from the Church and they are in this sense ‘ministers of the Church’.\n\nLinks to CES\n\nCES National Standards for School Chaplains\n\nCES School Chaplain Job Description Secondary\n\nCES School Chaplain Job Description Primary"
