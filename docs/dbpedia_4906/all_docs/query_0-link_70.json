Weâre hitting the road to prepare you for the new science syllabus with coffee, incursions and networking (drinks on us!).\n\nBook your visit!\n\nWeâre going to the Moon!\n\nStile has an exclusive partnership with Australian space start-up, Lunaria One which aims to boost sustainable activities in space. Through this partnership, your students will have the opportunity to partake in their first mission to answer the question: Can plants grow on the Moon?\n\nStudents will explore both the living systems and data science focus areas of the new syllabus through our updated Plants unit. In 2026, students will be part of history as the Lunaria One project lands actual plant seeds, chosen by students, on the Moon, and follow along as we see if they can grow.\n\nThis research is a key step in determining whether we can grow a food supply in space that could sustain a human colony beyond planet Earth!"
