        "text": "Don Juan (1819)\n\nBy Lord George Gordon Byron\n\nDon Juan is a lengthy poem which satirizes the legend of Don Juan, storied Spanish womanizer — recasting Juan as the victim. One thing to note is the rhyming scheme, which repeatedly suggests that Byron was imposing British pronunciation (joo-wun) on the subject’s Spanish name.\n\nDEDICATION\n\nBob Southey! You’re a poet, poet laureate,\n\nAnd representative of all the race.\n\nAlthough ’tis true that you turned out a Tory at\n\nLast, yours has lately been a common case.\n\nAnd now my epic renegade, what are ye at\n\nWith all the lakers, in and out of place?\n\nA nest of tuneful persons, to my eye\n\nLike four and twenty blackbirds in a pye,\n\nWhich pye being opened they began to sing’\n\n(This old song and new simile holds good),\n\n‘A dainty dish to set before the King’\n\nOr Regent, who admires such kind of food.\n\nAnd Coleridge too has lately taken wing,\n\nBut like a hawk encumbered with his hood,\n\nExplaining metaphysics to the nation.\n\nI wish he would explain his explanation.\n\nYou, Bob, are rather insolent, you know,\n\nAt being disappointed in your wish\n\nTo supersede all warblers here below,\n\nAnd be the only blackbird in the dish.\n\nAnd then you overstrain yourself, or so,\n\nAnd tumble downward like the flying fish\n\nGasping on deck, because you soar too high,\n\nBob, And fall for lack of moisture quite a dry Bob.\n\nAnd Wordsworth in a rather long Excursion\n\n(I think the quarto holds five hundred pages)\n\nHas given a sample from the vasty version\n\nOf his new system to perplex the sages.\n\n‘Tis poetry, at least by his assertion,\n\nAnd may appear so when the Dog Star rages,\n\nAnd he who understands it would be able\n\nTo add a story to the tower of Babel.\n\nYou gentlemen, by dint of long seclusion\n\nFrom better company, have kept your own\n\nAt Keswick, and through still continued fusion\n\nOf one another’s minds at last have grown\n\nTo deem, as a most logical conclusion,\n\nThat poesy has wreaths for you alone.\n\nThere is a narrowness in such a notion,\n\nWhich makes me wish you’d change your lakes for ocean.\n\nI would not imitate the petty thought,\n\nNor coin my self-love to so base a vice,\n\nFor all the glory your conversion brought,\n\nSince gold alone should not have been its price.\n\nYou have your salary; was’t for that you wrought?\n\nAnd Wordsworth has his place in the Excise.\n\nYou’re shabby fellows–true–but poets still\n\nAnd duly seated on the immortal hill.\n\nYour bays may hide the baldness of your brows,\n\nPerhaps some virtuous blushes; let them go.\n\nTo you I envy neither fruit nor boughs,\n\nAnd for the fame you would engross below,\n\nThe field is universal and allows\n\nScope to all such as feel the inherent glow.\n\nScott, Rogers, Campbell, Moore, and Crabbe will try\n\n‘Gainst you the question with posterity.\n\nFor me, who, wandering with pedestrian Muses,\n\nContend not with you on the winged’ steed,\n\nI wish your fate may yield ye, when she chooses,\n\nThe fame you envy and the skill you need.\n\nAnd recollect a poet nothing loses\n\nIn giving to his brethren their full meed\n\nOf merit, and complaint of present days\n\nIs not the certain path to future praise.\n\nHe that reserves his laurels for posterity\n\n(Who does not often claim the bright reversion)\n\nHas generally no great crop to spare it, he\n\nBeing only injured by his own assertion.\n\nAnd although here and there some glorious rarity\n\nArise like Titan from the sea’s immersion,\n\nThe major part of such appellants go\n\nTo–God knows where–for no one else can know.\n\nIf fallen in evil days on evil tongues,\n\nMilton appealed to the avenger, Time,\n\nIf Time, the avenger, execrates his wrongs\n\nAnd makes the word Miltonic mean sublime,\n\nHe deigned not to belie his soul in songs,\n\nNor turn his very talent to a crime.\n\nHe did not loathe the sire to laud the son,\n\nBut closed the tyrant-hater he begun.\n\nThink’st thou, could he, the blind old man, arise\n\nLike Samuel from the grave to freeze once more\n\nThe blood of monarchs with his prophecies,\n\nOr be alive again–again all hoar\n\nWith time and trials, and those helpless eyes\n\nAnd heartless daughters–worn and pale and poor,\n\nWould he adore a sultan? He obey\n\nThe intellectual eunuch Castlereagh?\n\nCold-blooded, smooth-faced, placid miscreant!\n\nDabbling its sleek young hands in Erin’s gore,\n\nAnd thus for wider carnage taught to pant,\n\nTransferred to gorge upon a sister shore,\n\nThe vulgarest tool that tyranny could want,\n\nWith just enough of talent and no more,\n\nTo lengthen fetters by another fixed\n\nAnd offer poison long already mixed.\n\nAn orator of such set trash of phrase,\n\nIneffably, legitimately vile,\n\nThat even its grossest flatterers dare not praise,\n\nNor foes–all nations–condescend to smile.\n\nNot even a sprightly blunder’s spark can blaze\n\nFrom that Ixion grindstone’s ceaseless toil,\n\nThat turns and turns to give the world a notion\n\nOf endless torments and perpetual motion.\n\nA bungler even in its disgusting trade,\n\nAnd botching, patching, leaving still behind\n\nSomething of which its masters are afraid,\n\nStates to be curbed and thoughts to be confined,\n\nConspiracy or congress to be made,\n\nCobbling at manacles for all mankind,\n\nA tinkering slave-maker, who mends old chains,\n\nWith God and man’s abhorrence for its gains.\n\nIf we may judge of matter by the mind,\n\nEmasculated to the marrow, it\n\nHath but two objects, how to serve and bind,\n\nDeeming the chain it wears even men may fit,\n\nEutropius of its many masters, blind\n\nTo worth as freedom, wisdom as to wit,\n\nFearless, because no feeling dwells in ice;\n\nIts very courage stagnates to a vice.\n\nWhere shall I turn me not to view its bonds,\n\nFor I will never feel them. Italy,\n\nThy late reviving Roman soul desponds\n\nBeneath the lie this state-thing breathed o’er thee.\n\nThy clanking chain and Erin’s yet green wounds\n\nHave voices, tongues to cry aloud for me.\n\nEurope has slaves, allies, kings, armies still,\n\nAnd Southey lives to sing them very ill.\n\nMeantime, Sir Laureate, I proceed to dedicate\n\nIn honest simple verse this song to you.\n\nAnd if in flattering strains I do not predicate,\n\n‘Tis that I still retain my buff and blue;\n\nMy politics as yet are all to educate.\n\nApostasy’s so fashionable too,\n\nTo keep one creed’s a task grown quite\n\nHerculean Is it not so, my Tory, ultra-Julian?\n\nCANTO THE FIRST\n\nI want a hero: an uncommon want,\n\nWhen every year and month sends forth a new one,\n\nTill, after cloying the gazettes with cant,\n\nThe age discovers he is not the true one;\n\nOf such as these I should not care to vaunt,\n\nI ‘ll therefore take our ancient friend Don Juan–\n\nWe all have seen him, in the pantomime,\n\nSent to the devil somewhat ere his time.\n\nVernon, the butcher Cumberland, Wolfe, Hawke,\n\nPrince Ferdinand, Granby, Burgoyne, Keppel, Howe,\n\nEvil and good, have had their tithe of talk,\n\nAnd fill’d their sign posts then, like Wellesley now;\n\nEach in their turn like Banquo’s monarchs stalk,\n\nFollowers of fame, ‘nine farrow’ of that sow:\n\nFrance, too, had Buonaparte and Dumourier\n\nRecorded in the Moniteur and Courier.\n\nBarnave, Brissot, Condorcet, Mirabeau,\n\nPetion, Clootz, Danton, Marat, La Fayette,\n\nWere French, and famous people, as we know:\n\nAnd there were others, scarce forgotten yet,\n\nJoubert, Hoche, Marceau, Lannes, Desaix, Moreau,\n\nWith many of the military set,\n\nExceedingly remarkable at times,\n\nBut not at all adapted to my rhymes.\n\nNelson was once Britannia’s god of war,\n\nAnd still should be so, but the tide is turn’d;\n\nThere ‘s no more to be said of Trafalgar,\n\n‘T is with our hero quietly inurn’d;\n\nBecause the army ‘s grown more popular,\n\nAt which the naval people are concern’d;\n\nBesides, the prince is all for the land-service,\n\nForgetting Duncan, Nelson, Howe, and Jervis.\n\nBrave men were living before Agamemnon\n\nAnd since, exceeding valorous and sage,\n\nA good deal like him too, though quite the same none;\n\nBut then they shone not on the poet’s page,\n\nAnd so have been forgotten:–I condemn none,\n\nBut can’t find any in the present age\n\nFit for my poem (that is, for my new one);\n\nSo, as I said, I ‘ll take my friend Don Juan.\n\nMost epic poets plunge ‘in medias res’\n\n(Horace makes this the heroic turnpike road),\n\nAnd then your hero tells, whene’er you please,\n\nWhat went before–by way of episode,\n\nWhile seated after dinner at his ease,\n\nBeside his mistress in some soft abode,\n\nPalace, or garden, paradise, or cavern,\n\nWhich serves the happy couple for a tavern.\n\nThat is the usual method, but not mine–\n\nMy way is to begin with the beginning;\n\nThe regularity of my design\n\nForbids all wandering as the worst of sinning,\n\nAnd therefore I shall open with a line\n\n(Although it cost me half an hour in spinning)\n\nNarrating somewhat of Don Juan’s father,\n\nAnd also of his mother, if you ‘d rather.\n\nIn Seville was he born, a pleasant city,\n\nFamous for oranges and women–he\n\nWho has not seen it will be much to pity,\n\nSo says the proverb–and I quite agree;\n\nOf all the Spanish towns is none more pretty,\n\nCadiz perhaps–but that you soon may see;\n\nDon Juan’s parents lived beside the river,\n\nA noble stream, and call’d the Guadalquivir.\n\nHis father’s name was Jose–Don, of course,–\n\nA true Hidalgo, free from every stain\n\nOf Moor or Hebrew blood, he traced his source\n\nThrough the most Gothic gentlemen of Spain;\n\nA better cavalier ne’er mounted horse,\n\nOr, being mounted, e’er got down again,\n\nThan Jose, who begot our hero, who\n\nBegot–but that ‘s to come–Well, to renew:\n\nHis mother was a learned lady, famed\n\nFor every branch of every science known\n\nIn every Christian language ever named,\n\nWith virtues equall’d by her wit alone,\n\nShe made the cleverest people quite ashamed,\n\nAnd even the good with inward envy groan,\n\nFinding themselves so very much exceeded\n\nIn their own way by all the things that she did.\n\nHer memory was a mine: she knew by heart\n\nAll Calderon and greater part of Lope,\n\nSo that if any actor miss’d his part\n\nShe could have served him for the prompter’s copy;\n\nFor her Feinagle’s were an useless art,\n\nAnd he himself obliged to shut up shop–he\n\nCould never make a memory so fine as\n\nThat which adorn’d the brain of Donna Inez.\n\nHer favourite science was the mathematical,\n\nHer noblest virtue was her magnanimity,\n\nHer wit (she sometimes tried at wit) was Attic all,\n\nHer serious sayings darken’d to sublimity;\n\nIn short, in all things she was fairly what I call\n\nA prodigy–her morning dress was dimity,\n\nHer evening silk, or, in the summer, muslin,\n\nAnd other stuffs, with which I won’t stay puzzling.\n\nShe knew the Latin–that is, ‘the Lord’s prayer,’\n\nAnd Greek–the alphabet–I ‘m nearly sure;\n\nShe read some French romances here and there,\n\nAlthough her mode of speaking was not pure;\n\nFor native Spanish she had no great care,\n\nAt least her conversation was obscure;\n\nHer thoughts were theorems, her words a problem,\n\nAs if she deem’d that mystery would ennoble ’em.\n\nShe liked the English and the Hebrew tongue,\n\nAnd said there was analogy between ’em;\n\nShe proved it somehow out of sacred song,\n\nBut I must leave the proofs to those who ‘ve seen ’em;\n\nBut this I heard her say, and can’t be wrong\n\nAnd all may think which way their judgments lean ’em,\n\n”T is strange–the Hebrew noun which means “I am,”\n\nThe English always use to govern d–n.’\n\nSome women use their tongues–she look’d a lecture,\n\nEach eye a sermon, and her brow a homily,\n\nAn all-in-all sufficient self-director,\n\nLike the lamented late Sir Samuel Romilly,\n\nThe Law’s expounder, and the State’s corrector,\n\nWhose suicide was almost an anomaly–\n\nOne sad example more, that ‘All is vanity’\n\n(The jury brought their verdict in ‘Insanity’).\n\nIn short, she was a walking calculation,\n\nMiss Edgeworth’s novels stepping from their covers,\n\nOr Mrs. Trimmer’s books on education,\n\nOr ‘Coelebs’ Wife’ set out in quest of lovers,\n\nMorality’s prim personification,\n\nIn which not Envy’s self a flaw discovers;\n\nTo others’ share let ‘female errors fall,’\n\nFor she had not even one–the worst of all.\n\nO! she was perfect past all parallel–\n\nOf any modern female saint’s comparison;\n\nSo far above the cunning powers of hell,\n\nHer guardian angel had given up his garrison;\n\nEven her minutest motions went as well\n\nAs those of the best time-piece made by Harrison:\n\nIn virtues nothing earthly could surpass her,\n\nSave thine ‘incomparable oil,’ Macassar!\n\nPerfect she was, but as perfection is\n\nInsipid in this naughty world of ours,\n\nWhere our first parents never learn’d to kiss\n\nTill they were exiled from their earlier bowers,\n\nWhere all was peace, and innocence, and bliss\n\n(I wonder how they got through the twelve hours),\n\nDon Jose, like a lineal son of Eve,\n\nWent plucking various fruit without her leave.\n\nHe was a mortal of the careless kind,\n\nWith no great love for learning, or the learn’d,\n\nWho chose to go where’er he had a mind,\n\nAnd never dream’d his lady was concern’d;\n\nThe world, as usual, wickedly inclined\n\nTo see a kingdom or a house o’erturn’d,\n\nWhisper’d he had a mistress, some said two–\n\nBut for domestic quarrels one will do.\n\nNow Donna Inez had, with all her merit,\n\nA great opinion of her own good qualities;\n\nNeglect, indeed, requires a saint to bear it,\n\nAnd such, indeed, she was in her moralities;\n\nBut then she had a devil of a spirit,\n\nAnd sometimes mix’d up fancies with realities,\n\nAnd let few opportunities escape\n\nOf getting her liege lord into a scrape.\n\nThis was an easy matter with a man\n\nOft in the wrong, and never on his guard;\n\nAnd even the wisest, do the best they can,\n\nHave moments, hours, and days, so unprepared,\n\nThat you might ‘brain them with their lady’s fan;’\n\nAnd sometimes ladies hit exceeding hard,\n\nAnd fans turn into falchions in fair hands,\n\nAnd why and wherefore no one understands.\n\n‘T is pity learned virgins ever wed\n\nWith persons of no sort of education,\n\nOr gentlemen, who, though well born and bred,\n\nGrow tired of scientific conversation:\n\nI don’t choose to say much upon this head,\n\nI ‘m a plain man, and in a single station,\n\nBut–Oh! ye lords of ladies intellectual,\n\nInform us truly, have they not hen-peck’d you all?\n\nDon Jose and his lady quarrell’d–why,\n\nNot any of the many could divine,\n\nThough several thousand people chose to try,\n\n‘T was surely no concern of theirs nor mine;\n\nI loathe that low vice–curiosity;\n\nBut if there ‘s anything in which I shine,\n\n‘T is in arranging all my friends’ affairs,\n\nNot having of my own domestic cares.\n\nAnd so I interfered, and with the best\n\nIntentions, but their treatment was not kind;\n\nI think the foolish people were possess’d,\n\nFor neither of them could I ever find,\n\nAlthough their porter afterwards confess’d–\n\nBut that ‘s no matter, and the worst ‘s behind,\n\nFor little Juan o’er me threw, down stairs,\n\nA pail of housemaid’s water unawares.\n\nA little curly-headed, good-for-nothing,\n\nAnd mischief-making monkey from his birth;\n\nHis parents ne’er agreed except in doting\n\nUpon the most unquiet imp on earth;\n\nInstead of quarrelling, had they been but both in\n\nTheir senses, they ‘d have sent young master forth\n\nTo school, or had him soundly whipp’d at home,\n\nTo teach him manners for the time to come.\n\nDon Jose and the Donna Inez led\n\nFor some time an unhappy sort of life,\n\nWishing each other, not divorced, but dead;\n\nThey lived respectably as man and wife,\n\nTheir conduct was exceedingly well-bred,\n\nAnd gave no outward signs of inward strife,\n\nUntil at length the smother’d fire broke out,\n\nAnd put the business past all kind of doubt.\n\nFor Inez call’d some druggists and physicians,\n\nAnd tried to prove her loving lord was mad;\n\nBut as he had some lucid intermissions,\n\nShe next decided he was only bad;\n\nYet when they ask’d her for her depositions,\n\nNo sort of explanation could be had,\n\nSave that her duty both to man and God\n\nRequired this conduct–which seem’d very odd.\n\nShe kept a journal, where his faults were noted,\n\nAnd open’d certain trunks of books and letters,\n\nAll which might, if occasion served, be quoted;\n\nAnd then she had all Seville for abettors,\n\nBesides her good old grandmother (who doted);\n\nThe hearers of her case became repeaters,\n\nThen advocates, inquisitors, and judges,\n\nSome for amusement, others for old grudges.\n\nAnd then this best and weakest woman bore\n\nWith such serenity her husband’s woes,\n\nJust as the Spartan ladies did of yore,\n\nWho saw their spouses kill’d, and nobly chose\n\nNever to say a word about them more–\n\nCalmly she heard each calumny that rose,\n\nAnd saw his agonies with such sublimity,\n\nThat all the world exclaim’d, ‘What magnanimity!’\n\nNo doubt this patience, when the world is damning us,\n\nIs philosophic in our former friends;\n\n‘T is also pleasant to be deem’d magnanimous,\n\nThe more so in obtaining our own ends;\n\nAnd what the lawyers call a ‘malus animus’\n\nConduct like this by no means comprehends;\n\nRevenge in person ‘s certainly no virtue,\n\nBut then ‘t is not my fault, if others hurt you.\n\nAnd if your quarrels should rip up old stories,\n\nAnd help them with a lie or two additional,\n\nI ‘m not to blame, as you well know–no more is\n\nAny one else–they were become traditional;\n\nBesides, their resurrection aids our glories\n\nBy contrast, which is what we just were wishing all:\n\nAnd science profits by this resurrection–\n\nDead scandals form good subjects for dissection.\n\nTheir friends had tried at reconciliation,\n\nThen their relations, who made matters worse.\n\n(‘T were hard to tell upon a like occasion\n\nTo whom it may be best to have recourse–\n\nI can’t say much for friend or yet relation):\n\nThe lawyers did their utmost for divorce,\n\nBut scarce a fee was paid on either side\n\nBefore, unluckily, Don Jose died.\n\nHe died: and most unluckily, because,\n\nAccording to all hints I could collect\n\nFrom counsel learned in those kinds of laws\n\n(Although their talk ‘s obscure and circumspect),\n\nHis death contrived to spoil a charming cause;\n\nA thousand pities also with respect\n\nTo public feeling, which on this occasion\n\nWas manifested in a great sensation.\n\nBut, ah! he died; and buried with him lay\n\nThe public feeling and the lawyers’ fees:\n\nHis house was sold, his servants sent away,\n\nA Jew took one of his two mistresses,\n\nA priest the other–at least so they say:\n\nI ask’d the doctors after his disease–\n\nHe died of the slow fever call’d the tertian,\n\nAnd left his widow to her own aversion.\n\nYet Jose was an honourable man,\n\nThat I must say who knew him very well;\n\nTherefore his frailties I ‘ll no further scan\n\nIndeed there were not many more to tell;\n\nAnd if his passions now and then outran\n\nDiscretion, and were not so peaceable\n\nAs Numa’s (who was also named Pompilius),\n\nHe had been ill brought up, and was born bilious.\n\nWhate’er might be his worthlessness or worth,\n\nPoor fellow! he had many things to wound him.\n\nLet ‘s own–since it can do no good on earth–\n\nIt was a trying moment that which found him\n\nStanding alone beside his desolate hearth,\n\nWhere all his household gods lay shiver’d round him:\n\nNo choice was left his feelings or his pride,\n\nSave death or Doctors’ Commons–so he died.\n\nDying intestate, Juan was sole heir\n\nTo a chancery suit, and messuages, and lands,\n\nWhich, with a long minority and care,\n\nPromised to turn out well in proper hands:\n\nInez became sole guardian, which was fair,\n\nAnd answer’d but to nature’s just demands;\n\nAn only son left with an only mother\n\nIs brought up much more wisely than another.\n\nSagest of women, even of widows, she\n\nResolved that Juan should be quite a paragon,\n\nAnd worthy of the noblest pedigree\n\n(His sire was of Castile, his dam from Aragon):\n\nThen for accomplishments of chivalry,\n\nIn case our lord the king should go to war again,\n\nHe learn’d the arts of riding, fencing, gunnery,\n\nAnd how to scale a fortress–or a nunnery.\n\nBut that which Donna Inez most desired,\n\nAnd saw into herself each day before all\n\nThe learned tutors whom for him she hired,\n\nWas, that his breeding should be strictly moral;\n\nMuch into all his studies she inquired,\n\nAnd so they were submitted first to her, all,\n\nArts, sciences, no branch was made a mystery\n\nTo Juan’s eyes, excepting natural history.\n\nThe languages, especially the dead,\n\nThe sciences, and most of all the abstruse,\n\nThe arts, at least all such as could be said\n\nTo be the most remote from common use,\n\nIn all these he was much and deeply read;\n\nBut not a page of any thing that ‘s loose,\n\nOr hints continuation of the species,\n\nWas ever suffer’d, lest he should grow vicious.\n\nHis classic studies made a little puzzle,\n\nBecause of filthy loves of gods and goddesses,\n\nWho in the earlier ages raised a bustle,\n\nBut never put on pantaloons or bodices;\n\nHis reverend tutors had at times a tussle,\n\nAnd for their AEneids, Iliads, and Odysseys,\n\nWere forced to make an odd sort! of apology,\n\nFor Donna Inez dreaded the Mythology.\n\nOvid ‘s a rake, as half his verses show him,\n\nAnacreon’s morals are a still worse sample,\n\nCatullus scarcely has a decent poem,\n\nI don’t think Sappho’s Ode a good example,\n\nAlthough Longinus tells us there is no hymn\n\nWhere the sublime soars forth on wings more ample:\n\nBut Virgil’s songs are pure, except that horrid one\n\nBeginning with ‘Formosum Pastor Corydon.’\n\nLucretius’ irreligion is too strong,\n\nFor early stomachs, to prove wholesome food;\n\nI can’t help thinking Juvenal was wrong,\n\nAlthough no doubt his real intent was good,\n\nFor speaking out so plainly in his song,\n\nSo much indeed as to be downright rude;\n\nAnd then what proper person can be partial\n\nTo all those nauseous epigrams of Martial?\n\nJuan was taught from out the best edition,\n\nExpurgated by learned men, who place\n\nJudiciously, from out the schoolboy’s vision,\n\nThe grosser parts; but, fearful to deface\n\nToo much their modest bard by this omission,\n\nAnd pitying sore his mutilated case,\n\nThey only add them all in an appendix,\n\nWhich saves, in fact, the trouble of an index;\n\nFor there we have them all ‘at one fell swoop,’\n\nInstead of being scatter’d through the Pages;\n\nThey stand forth marshall’d in a handsome troop,\n\nTo meet the ingenuous youth of future ages,\n\nTill some less rigid editor shall stoop\n\nTo call them back into their separate cages,\n\nInstead of standing staring all together,\n\nLike garden gods–and not so decent either.\n\nThe Missal too (it was the family Missal)\n\nWas ornamented in a sort of way\n\nWhich ancient mass-books often are, and this all\n\nKinds of grotesques illumined; and how they,\n\nWho saw those figures on the margin kiss all,\n\nCould turn their optics to the text and pray,\n\nIs more than I know–But Don Juan’s mother\n\nKept this herself, and gave her son another.\n\nSermons he read, and lectures he endured,\n\nAnd homilies, and lives of all the saints;\n\nTo Jerome and to Chrysostom inured,\n\nHe did not take such studies for restraints;\n\nBut how faith is acquired, and then ensured,\n\nSo well not one of the aforesaid paints\n\nAs Saint Augustine in his fine Confessions,\n\nWhich make the reader envy his transgressions.\n\nThis, too, was a seal’d book to little Juan–\n\nI can’t but say that his mamma was right,\n\nIf such an education was the true one.\n\nShe scarcely trusted him from out her sight;\n\nHer maids were old, and if she took a new one,\n\nYou might be sure she was a perfect fright;\n\nShe did this during even her husband’s life–\n\nI recommend as much to every wife.\n\nYoung Juan wax’d in goodliness and grace;\n\nAt six a charming child, and at eleven\n\nWith all the promise of as fine a face\n\nAs e’er to man’s maturer growth was given:\n\nHe studied steadily, and grew apace,\n\nAnd seem’d, at least, in the right road to heaven,\n\nFor half his days were pass’d at church, the other\n\nBetween his tutors, confessor, and mother.\n\nAt six, I said, he was a charming child,\n\nAt twelve he was a fine, but quiet boy;\n\nAlthough in infancy a little wild,\n\nThey tamed him down amongst them: to destroy\n\nHis natural spirit not in vain they toil’d,\n\nAt least it seem’d so; and his mother’s joy\n\nWas to declare how sage, and still, and steady,\n\nHer young philosopher was grown already.\n\nI had my doubts, perhaps I have them still,\n\nBut what I say is neither here nor there:\n\nI knew his father well, and have some skill\n\nIn character–but it would not be fair\n\nFrom sire to son to augur good or ill:\n\nHe and his wife were an ill-sorted pair–\n\nBut scandal ‘s my aversion–I protest\n\nAgainst all evil speaking, even in jest.\n\nFor my part I say nothing–nothing–but\n\nThis I will say–my reasons are my own–\n\nThat if I had an only son to put\n\nTo school (as God be praised that I have none),\n\n‘T is not with Donna Inez I would shut\n\nHim up to learn his catechism alone,\n\nNo–no–I ‘d send him out betimes to college,\n\nFor there it was I pick’d up my own knowledge.\n\nFor there one learns–‘t is not for me to boast,\n\nThough I acquired–but I pass over that,\n\nAs well as all the Greek I since have lost:\n\nI say that there ‘s the place–but ‘Verbum sat.’\n\nI think I pick’d up too, as well as most,\n\nKnowledge of matters–but no matter what–\n\nI never married–but, I think, I know\n\nThat sons should not be educated so.\n\nYoung Juan now was sixteen years of age,\n\nTall, handsome, slender, but well knit: he seem’d\n\nActive, though not so sprightly, as a page;\n\nAnd everybody but his mother deem’d\n\nHim almost man; but she flew in a rage\n\nAnd bit her lips (for else she might have scream’d)\n\nIf any said so, for to be precocious\n\nWas in her eyes a thing the most atrocious.\n\nAmongst her numerous acquaintance, all\n\nSelected for discretion and devotion,\n\nThere was the Donna Julia, whom to call\n\nPretty were but to give a feeble notion\n\nOf many charms in her as natural\n\nAs sweetness to the flower, or salt to ocean,\n\nHer zone to Venus, or his bow to Cupid\n\n(But this last simile is trite and stupid).\n\nThe darkness of her Oriental eye\n\nAccorded with her Moorish origin\n\n(Her blood was not all Spanish, by the by;\n\nIn Spain, you know, this is a sort of sin);\n\nWhen proud Granada fell, and, forced to fly,\n\nBoabdil wept, of Donna Julia’s kin\n\nSome went to Africa, some stay’d in Spain,\n\nHer great-great-grandmamma chose to remain.\n\nShe married (I forget the pedigree)\n\nWith an Hidalgo, who transmitted down\n\nHis blood less noble than such blood should be;\n\nAt such alliances his sires would frown,\n\nIn that point so precise in each degree\n\nThat they bred in and in, as might be shown,\n\nMarrying their cousins–nay, their aunts, and nieces,\n\nWhich always spoils the breed, if it increases.\n\nThis heathenish cross restored the breed again,\n\nRuin’d its blood, but much improved its flesh;\n\nFor from a root the ugliest in Old Spain\n\nSprung up a branch as beautiful as fresh;\n\nThe sons no more were short, the daughters plain:\n\nBut there ‘s a rumour which I fain would hush,\n\n‘T is said that Donna Julia’s grandmamma\n\nProduced her Don more heirs at love than law.\n\nHowever this might be, the race went on\n\nImproving still through every generation,\n\nUntil it centred in an only son,\n\nWho left an only daughter; my narration\n\nMay have suggested that this single one\n\nCould be but Julia (whom on this occasion\n\nI shall have much to speak about), and she\n\nWas married, charming, chaste, and twenty-three.\n\nHer eye (I ‘m very fond of handsome eyes)\n\nWas large and dark, suppressing half its fire\n\nUntil she spoke, then through its soft disguise\n\nFlash’d an expression more of pride than ire,\n\nAnd love than either; and there would arise\n\nA something in them which was not desire,\n\nBut would have been, perhaps, but for the soul\n\nWhich struggled through and chasten’d down the whole.\n\nHer glossy hair was cluster’d o’er a brow\n\nBright with intelligence, and fair, and smooth;\n\nHer eyebrow’s shape was like th’ aerial bow,\n\nHer cheek all purple with the beam of youth,\n\nMounting at times to a transparent glow,\n\nAs if her veins ran lightning; she, in sooth,\n\nPossess’d an air and grace by no means common:\n\nHer stature tall–I hate a dumpy woman.\n\nWedded she was some years, and to a man\n\nOf fifty, and such husbands are in plenty;\n\nAnd yet, I think, instead of such a ONE\n\n‘T were better to have TWO of five-and-twenty,\n\nEspecially in countries near the sun:\n\nAnd now I think on ‘t, ‘mi vien in mente,’\n\nLadies even of the most uneasy virtue\n\nPrefer a spouse whose age is short of thirty.\n\n‘T is a sad thing, I cannot choose but say,\n\nAnd all the fault of that indecent sun,\n\nWho cannot leave alone our helpless clay,\n\nBut will keep baking, broiling, burning on,\n\nThat howsoever people fast and pray,\n\nThe flesh is frail, and so the soul undone:\n\nWhat men call gallantry, and gods adultery,\n\nIs much more common where the climate ‘s sultry.\n\nHappy the nations of the moral North!\n\nWhere all is virtue, and the winter season\n\nSends sin, without a rag on, shivering forth\n\n(‘T was snow that brought St. Anthony to reason);\n\nWhere juries cast up what a wife is worth,\n\nBy laying whate’er sum in mulct they please on\n\nThe lover, who must pay a handsome price,\n\nBecause it is a marketable vice.\n\nAlfonso was the name of Julia’s lord,\n\nA man well looking for his years, and who\n\nWas neither much beloved nor yet abhorr’d:\n\nThey lived together, as most people do,\n\nSuffering each other’s foibles by accord,\n\nAnd not exactly either one or two;\n\nYet he was jealous, though he did not show it,\n\nFor jealousy dislikes the world to know it.\n\nJulia was–yet I never could see why–\n\nWith Donna Inez quite a favourite friend;\n\nBetween their tastes there was small sympathy,\n\nFor not a line had Julia ever penn’d:\n\nSome people whisper but no doubt they lie,\n\nFor malice still imputes some private end,\n\nThat Inez had, ere Don Alfonso’s marriage,\n\nForgot with him her very prudent carriage;\n\nAnd that still keeping up the old connection,\n\nWhich time had lately render’d much more chaste,\n\nShe took his lady also in affection,\n\nAnd certainly this course was much the best:\n\nShe flatter’d Julia with her sage protection,\n\nAnd complimented Don Alfonso’s taste;\n\nAnd if she could not (who can?) silence scandal,\n\nAt least she left it a more slender handle.\n\nI can’t tell whether Julia saw the affair\n\nWith other people’s eyes, or if her own\n\nDiscoveries made, but none could be aware\n\nOf this, at least no symptom e’er was shown;\n\nPerhaps she did not know, or did not care,\n\nIndifferent from the first or callous grown:\n\nI ‘m really puzzled what to think or say,\n\nShe kept her counsel in so close a way.\n\nJuan she saw, and, as a pretty child,\n\nCaress’d him often–such a thing might be\n\nQuite innocently done, and harmless styled,\n\nWhen she had twenty years, and thirteen he;\n\nBut I am not so sure I should have smiled\n\nWhen he was sixteen, Julia twenty-three;\n\nThese few short years make wondrous alterations,\n\nParticularly amongst sun-burnt nations.\n\nWhate’er the cause might be, they had become\n\nChanged; for the dame grew distant, the youth shy,\n\nTheir looks cast down, their greetings almost dumb,\n\nAnd much embarrassment in either eye;\n\nThere surely will be little doubt with some\n\nThat Donna Julia knew the reason why,\n\nBut as for Juan, he had no more notion\n\nThan he who never saw the sea of ocean.\n\nYet Julia’s very coldness still was kind,\n\nAnd tremulously gentle her small hand\n\nWithdrew itself from his, but left behind\n\nA little pressure, thrilling, and so bland\n\nAnd slight, so very slight, that to the mind\n\n‘T was but a doubt; but ne’er magician’s wand\n\nWrought change with all Armida’s fairy art\n\nLike what this light touch left on Juan’s heart.\n\nAnd if she met him, though she smiled no more,\n\nShe look’d a sadness sweeter than her smile,\n\nAs if her heart had deeper thoughts in store\n\nShe must not own, but cherish’d more the while\n\nFor that compression in its burning core;\n\nEven innocence itself has many a wile,\n\nAnd will not dare to trust itself with truth,\n\nAnd love is taught hypocrisy from youth.\n\nBut passion most dissembles, yet betrays\n\nEven by its darkness; as the blackest sky\n\nForetells the heaviest tempest, it displays\n\nIts workings through the vainly guarded eye,\n\nAnd in whatever aspect it arrays\n\nItself, ‘t is still the same hypocrisy;\n\nColdness or anger, even disdain or hate,\n\nAre masks it often wears, and still too late.\n\nThen there were sighs, the deeper for suppression,\n\nAnd stolen glances, sweeter for the theft,\n\nAnd burning blushes, though for no transgression,\n\nTremblings when met, and restlessness when left;\n\nAll these are little preludes to possession,\n\nOf which young passion cannot be bereft,\n\nAnd merely tend to show how greatly love is\n\nEmbarrass’d at first starting with a novice.\n\nPoor Julia’s heart was in an awkward state;\n\nShe felt it going, and resolved to make\n\nThe noblest efforts for herself and mate,\n\nFor honour’s, pride’s, religion’s, virtue’s sake;\n\nHer resolutions were most truly great,\n\nAnd almost might have made a Tarquin quake:\n\nShe pray’d the Virgin Mary for her grace,\n\nAs being the best judge of a lady’s case.\n\nShe vow’d she never would see Juan more,\n\nAnd next day paid a visit to his mother,\n\nAnd look’d extremely at the opening door,\n\nWhich, by the Virgin’s grace, let in another;\n\nGrateful she was, and yet a little sore–\n\nAgain it opens, it can be no other,\n\n‘T is surely Juan now–No! I ‘m afraid\n\nThat night the Virgin was no further pray’d.\n\nShe now determined that a virtuous woman\n\nShould rather face and overcome temptation,\n\nThat flight was base and dastardly, and no man\n\nShould ever give her heart the least sensation;\n\nThat is to say, a thought beyond the common\n\nPreference, that we must feel upon occasion\n\nFor people who are pleasanter than others,\n\nBut then they only seem so many brothers.\n\nAnd even if by chance–and who can tell?\n\nThe devil ‘s so very sly–she should discover\n\nThat all within was not so very well,\n\nAnd, if still free, that such or such a lover\n\nMight please perhaps, a virtuous wife can quell\n\nSuch thoughts, and be the better when they ‘re over;\n\nAnd if the man should ask, ‘t is but denial:\n\nI recommend young ladies to make trial.\n\nAnd then there are such things as love divine,\n\nBright and immaculate, unmix’d and pure,\n\nSuch as the angels think so very fine,\n\nAnd matrons who would be no less secure,\n\nPlatonic, perfect, ‘just such love as mine;’\n\nThus Julia said–and thought so, to be sure;\n\nAnd so I ‘d have her think, were I the man\n\nOn whom her reveries celestial ran.\n\nSuch love is innocent, and may exist\n\nBetween young persons without any danger.\n\nA hand may first, and then a lip be kist;\n\nFor my part, to such doings I ‘m a stranger,\n\nBut hear these freedoms form the utmost list\n\nOf all o’er which such love may be a ranger:\n\nIf people go beyond, ‘t is quite a crime,\n\nBut not my fault–I tell them all in time.\n\nLove, then, but love within its proper limits,\n\nWas Julia’s innocent determination\n\nIn young Don Juan’s favour, and to him its\n\nExertion might be useful on occasion;\n\nAnd, lighted at too pure a shrine to dim its\n\nEthereal lustre, with what sweet persuasion\n\nHe might be taught, by love and her together–\n\nI really don’t know what, nor Julia either.\n\nFraught with this fine intention, and well fenced\n\nIn mail of proof–her purity of soul–\n\nShe, for the future of her strength convinced.\n\nAnd that her honour was a rock, or mole,\n\nExceeding sagely from that hour dispensed\n\nWith any kind of troublesome control;\n\nBut whether Julia to the task was equal\n\nIs that which must be mention’d in the sequel.\n\nHer plan she deem’d both innocent and feasible,\n\nAnd, surely, with a stripling of sixteen\n\nNot scandal’s fangs could fix on much that ‘s seizable,\n\nOr if they did so, satisfied to mean\n\nNothing but what was good, her breast was peaceable–\n\nA quiet conscience makes one so serene!\n\nChristians have burnt each other, quite persuaded\n\nThat all the Apostles would have done as they did.\n\nAnd if in the mean time her husband died,\n\nBut Heaven forbid that such a thought should cross\n\nHer brain, though in a dream! (and then she sigh’d)\n\nNever could she survive that common loss;\n\nBut just suppose that moment should betide,\n\nI only say suppose it–inter nos.\n\n(This should be entre nous, for Julia thought\n\nIn French, but then the rhyme would go for naught.)\n\nI only say suppose this supposition:\n\nJuan being then grown up to man’s estate\n\nWould fully suit a widow of condition,\n\nEven seven years hence it would not be too late;\n\nAnd in the interim (to pursue this vision)\n\nThe mischief, after all, could not be great,\n\nFor he would learn the rudiments of love,\n\nI mean the seraph way of those above.\n\nSo much for Julia. Now we ‘ll turn to Juan.\n\nPoor little fellow! he had no idea\n\nOf his own case, and never hit the true one;\n\nIn feelings quick as Ovid’s Miss Medea,\n\nHe puzzled over what he found a new one,\n\nBut not as yet imagined it could be\n\nThing quite in course, and not at all alarming,\n\nWhich, with a little patience, might grow charming.\n\nSilent and pensive, idle, restless, slow,\n\nHis home deserted for the lonely wood,\n\nTormented with a wound he could not know,\n\nHis, like all deep grief, plunged in solitude:\n\nI ‘m fond myself of solitude or so,\n\nBut then, I beg it may be understood,\n\nBy solitude I mean a sultan’s, not\n\nA hermit’s, with a haram for a grot.\n\n‘Oh Love! in such a wilderness as this,\n\nWhere transport and security entwine,\n\nHere is the empire of thy perfect bliss,\n\nAnd here thou art a god indeed divine.’\n\nThe bard I quote from does not sing amiss,\n\nWith the exception of the second line,\n\nFor that same twining ‘transport and security’\n\nAre twisted to a phrase of some obscurity.\n\nThe poet meant, no doubt, and thus appeals\n\nTo the good sense and senses of mankind,\n\nThe very thing which every body feels,\n\nAs all have found on trial, or may find,\n\nThat no one likes to be disturb’d at meals\n\nOr love.–I won’t say more about ‘entwined’\n\nOr ‘transport,’ as we knew all that before,\n\nBut beg ‘Security’ will bolt the door.\n\nYoung Juan wander’d by the glassy brooks,\n\nThinking unutterable things; he threw\n\nHimself at length within the leafy nooks\n\nWhere the wild branch of the cork forest grew;\n\nThere poets find materials for their books,\n\nAnd every now and then we read them through,\n\nSo that their plan and prosody are eligible,\n\nUnless, like Wordsworth, they prove unintelligible.\n\nHe, Juan (and not Wordsworth), so pursued\n\nHis self-communion with his own high soul,\n\nUntil his mighty heart, in its great mood,\n\nHad mitigated part, though not the whole\n\nOf its disease; he did the best he could\n\nWith things not very subject to control,\n\nAnd turn’d, without perceiving his condition,\n\nLike Coleridge, into a metaphysician.\n\nHe thought about himself, and the whole earth\n\nOf man the wonderful, and of the stars,\n\nAnd how the deuce they ever could have birth;\n\nAnd then he thought of earthquakes, and of wars,\n\nHow many miles the moon might have in girth,\n\nOf air-balloons, and of the many bars\n\nTo perfect knowledge of the boundless skies;–\n\nAnd then he thought of Donna Julia’s eyes.\n\nIn thoughts like these true wisdom may discern\n\nLongings sublime, and aspirations high,\n\nWhich some are born with, but the most part learn\n\nTo plague themselves withal, they know not why:\n\n‘T was strange that one so young should thus concern\n\nHis brain about the action of the sky;\n\nIf you think ‘t was philosophy that this did,\n\nI can’t help thinking puberty assisted.\n\nHe pored upon the leaves, and on the flowers,\n\nAnd heard a voice in all the winds; and then\n\nHe thought of wood-nymphs and immortal bowers,\n\nAnd how the goddesses came down to men:\n\nHe miss’d the pathway, he forgot the hours,\n\nAnd when he look’d upon his watch again,\n\nHe found how much old Time had been a winner–\n\nHe also found that he had lost his dinner.\n\nSometimes he turn’d to gaze upon his book,\n\nBoscan, or Garcilasso;–by the wind\n\nEven as the page is rustled while we look,\n\nSo by the poesy of his own mind\n\nOver the mystic leaf his soul was shook,\n\nAs if ‘t were one whereon magicians bind\n\nTheir spells, and give them to the passing gale,\n\nAccording to some good old woman’s tale.\n\nThus would he while his lonely hours away\n\nDissatisfied, nor knowing what he wanted;\n\nNor glowing reverie, nor poet’s lay,\n\nCould yield his spirit that for which it panted,\n\nA bosom whereon he his head might lay,\n\nAnd hear the heart beat with the love it granted,\n\nWith–several other things, which I forget,\n\nOr which, at least, I need not mention yet.\n\nThose lonely walks, and lengthening reveries,\n\nCould not escape the gentle Julia’s eyes;\n\nShe saw that Juan was not at his ease;\n\nBut that which chiefly may, and must surprise,\n\nIs, that the Donna Inez did not tease\n\nHer only son with question or surmise:\n\nWhether it was she did not see, or would not,\n\nOr, like all very clever people, could not.\n\nThis may seem strange, but yet ‘t is very common;\n\nFor instance–gentlemen, whose ladies take\n\nLeave to o’erstep the written rights of woman,\n\nAnd break the–Which commandment is ‘t they break?\n\n(I have forgot the number, and think no man\n\nShould rashly quote, for fear of a mistake.)\n\nI say, when these same gentlemen are jealous,\n\nThey make some blunder, which their ladies tell us.\n\nA real husband always is suspicious,\n\nBut still no less suspects in the wrong place,\n\nJealous of some one who had no such wishes,\n\nOr pandering blindly to his own disgrace,\n\nBy harbouring some dear friend extremely vicious;\n\nThe last indeed ‘s infallibly the case:\n\nAnd when the spouse and friend are gone off wholly,\n\nHe wonders at their vice, and not his folly.\n\nThus parents also are at times short-sighted;\n\nThough watchful as the lynx, they ne’er discover,\n\nThe while the wicked world beholds delighted,\n\nYoung Hopeful’s mistress, or Miss Fanny’s lover,\n\nTill some confounded escapade has blighted\n\nThe plan of twenty years, and all is over;\n\nAnd then the mother cries, the father swears,\n\nAnd wonders why the devil he got heirs.\n\nBut Inez was so anxious, and so clear\n\nOf sight, that I must think, on this occasion,\n\nShe had some other motive much more near\n\nFor leaving Juan to this new temptation;\n\nBut what that motive was, I sha’n’t say here;\n\nPerhaps to finish Juan’s education,\n\nPerhaps to open Don Alfonso’s eyes,\n\nIn case he thought his wife too great a prize.\n\nIt was upon a day, a summer’s day;-\n\nSummer’s indeed a very dangerous season,\n\nAnd so is spring about the end of May;\n\nThe sun, no doubt, is the prevailing reason;\n\nBut whatsoe’er the cause is, one may say,\n\nAnd stand convicted of more truth than treason,\n\nThat there are months which nature grows more merry in,–\n\nMarch has its hares, and May must have its heroine.\n\n‘T was on a summer’s day–the sixth of June:–\n\nI like to be particular in dates,\n\nNot only of the age, and year, but moon;\n\nThey are a sort of post-house, where the Fates\n\nChange horses, making history change its tune,\n\nThen spur away o’er empires and o’er states,\n\nLeaving at last not much besides chronology,\n\nExcepting the post-obits of theology.\n\n‘T was on the sixth of June, about the hour\n\nOf half-past six–perhaps still nearer seven–\n\nWhen Julia sate within as pretty a bower\n\nAs e’er held houri in that heathenish heaven\n\nDescribed by Mahomet, and Anacreon Moore,\n\nTo whom the lyre and laurels have been given,\n\nWith all the trophies of triumphant song–\n\nHe won them well, and may he wear them long!\n\nShe sate, but not alone; I know not well\n\nHow this same interview had taken place,\n\nAnd even if I knew, I should not tell–\n\nPeople should hold their tongues in any case;\n\nNo matter how or why the thing befell,\n\nBut there were she and Juan, face to face–\n\nWhen two such faces are so, ‘t would be wise,\n\nBut very difficult, to shut their eyes.\n\nHow beautiful she look’d! her conscious heart\n\nGlow’d in her cheek, and yet she felt no wrong.\n\nO Love! how perfect is thy mystic art,\n\nStrengthening the weak, and trampling on the strong,\n\nHow self-deceitful is the sagest part\n\nOf mortals whom thy lure hath led along–\n\nThe precipice she stood on was immense,\n\nSo was her creed in her own innocence.\n\nShe thought of her own strength, and Juan’s youth,\n\nAnd of the folly of all prudish fears,\n\nVictorious virtue, and domestic truth,\n\nAnd then of Don Alfonso’s fifty years:\n\nI wish these last had not occurr’d, in sooth,\n\nBecause that number rarely much endears,\n\nAnd through all climes, the snowy and the sunny,\n\nSounds ill in love, whate’er it may in money.\n\nWhen people say, ‘I’ve told you fifty times,’\n\nThey mean to scold, and very often do;\n\nWhen poets say, ‘I’ve written fifty rhymes,’\n\nThey make you dread that they ‘ll recite them too;\n\nIn gangs of fifty, thieves commit their crimes;\n\nAt fifty love for love is rare, ‘t is true,\n\nBut then, no doubt, it equally as true is,\n\nA good deal may be bought for fifty Louis.\n\nJulia had honour, virtue, truth, and love,\n\nFor Don Alfonso; and she inly swore,\n\nBy all the vows below to powers above,\n\nShe never would disgrace the ring she wore,\n\nNor leave a wish which wisdom might reprove;\n\nAnd while she ponder’d this, besides much more,\n\nOne hand on Juan’s carelessly was thrown,\n\nQuite by mistake–she thought it was her own;\n\nUnconsciously she lean’d upon the other,\n\nWhich play’d within the tangles of her hair:\n\nAnd to contend with thoughts she could not smother\n\nShe seem’d by the distraction of her air.\n\n‘T was surely very wrong in Juan’s mother\n\nTo leave together this imprudent pair,\n\nShe who for many years had watch’d her son so–\n\nI ‘m very certain mine would not have done so.\n\nThe hand which still held Juan’s, by degrees\n\nGently, but palpably confirm’d its grasp,\n\nAs if it said, ‘Detain me, if you please;’\n\nYet there ‘s no doubt she only meant to clasp\n\nHis fingers with a pure Platonic squeeze:\n\nShe would have shrunk as from a toad, or asp,\n\nHad she imagined such a thing could rouse\n\nA feeling dangerous to a prudent spouse.\n\nI cannot know what Juan thought of this,\n\nBut what he did, is much what you would do;\n\nHis young lip thank’d it with a grateful kiss,\n\nAnd then, abash’d at its own joy, withdrew\n\nIn deep despair, lest he had done amiss,–\n\nLove is so very timid when ‘t is new:\n\nShe blush’d, and frown’d not, but she strove to speak,\n\nAnd held her tongue, her voice was grown so weak.\n\nThe sun set, and up rose the yellow moon:\n\nThe devil ‘s in the moon for mischief; they\n\nWho call’d her CHASTE, methinks, began too soon\n\nTheir nomenclature; there is not a day,\n\nThe longest, not the twenty-first of June,\n\nSees half the business in a wicked way\n\nOn which three single hours of moonshine smile–\n\nAnd then she looks so modest all the while.\n\nThere is a dangerous silence in that hour,\n\nA stillness, which leaves room for the full soul\n\nTo open all itself, without the power\n\nOf calling wholly back its self-control;\n\nThe silver light which, hallowing tree and tower,\n\nSheds beauty and deep softness o’er the whole,\n\nBreathes also to the heart, and o’er it throws\n\nA loving languor, which is not repose.\n\nAnd Julia sate with Juan, half embraced\n\nAnd half retiring from the glowing arm,\n\nWhich trembled like the bosom where ‘t was placed;\n\nYet still she must have thought there was no harm,\n\nOr else ‘t were easy to withdraw her waist;\n\nBut then the situation had its charm,\n\nAnd then–God knows what next–I can’t go on;\n\nI ‘m almost sorry that I e’er begun.\n\nO Plato! Plato! you have paved the way,\n\nWith your confounded fantasies, to more\n\nImmoral conduct by the fancied sway\n\nYour system feigns o’er the controulless core\n\nOf human hearts, than all the long array\n\nOf poets and romancers:–You ‘re a bore,\n\nA charlatan, a coxcomb–and have been,\n\nAt best, no better than a go-between.\n\nAnd Julia’s voice was lost, except in sighs,\n\nUntil too late for useful conversation;\n\nThe tears were gushing from her gentle eyes,\n\nI wish indeed they had not had occasion,\n\nBut who, alas! can love, and then be wise?\n\nNot that remorse did not oppose temptation;\n\nA little still she strove, and much repented\n\nAnd whispering ‘I will ne’er consent’–consented.\n\n‘T is said that Xerxes offer’d a reward\n\nTo those who could invent him a new pleasure:\n\nMethinks the requisition ‘s rather hard,\n\nAnd must have cost his majesty a treasure:\n\nFor my part, I ‘m a moderate-minded bard,\n\nFond of a little love (which I call leisure);\n\nI care not for new pleasures, as the old\n\nAre quite enough for me, so they but hold.\n\nO Pleasure! you are indeed a pleasant thing,\n\nAlthough one must be damn’d for you, no doubt:\n\nI make a resolution every spring\n\nOf reformation, ere the year run out,\n\nBut somehow, this my vestal vow takes wing,\n\nYet still, I trust it may be kept throughout:\n\nI ‘m very sorry, very much ashamed,\n\nAnd mean, next winter, to be quite reclaim’d.\n\nHere my chaste Muse a liberty must take–\n\nStart not! still chaster reader–she ‘ll be nice hence–\n\nForward, and there is no great cause to quake;\n\nThis liberty is a poetic licence,\n\nWhich some irregularity may make\n\nIn the design, and as I have a high sense\n\nOf Aristotle and the Rules, ‘t is fit\n\nTo beg his pardon when I err a bit.\n\nThis licence is to hope the reader will\n\nSuppose from June the sixth (the fatal day,\n\nWithout whose epoch my poetic skill\n\nFor want of facts would all be thrown away),\n\nBut keeping Julia and Don Juan still\n\nIn sight, that several months have pass’d; we ‘ll say\n\n‘T was in November, but I ‘m not so sure\n\nAbout the day–the era ‘s more obscure.\n\nWe ‘ll talk of that anon.–‘T is sweet to hear\n\nAt midnight on the blue and moonlit deep\n\nThe song and oar of Adria’s gondolier,\n\nBy distance mellow’d, o’er the waters sweep;\n\n‘T is sweet to see the evening star appear;\n\n‘T is sweet to listen as the night-winds creep\n\nFrom leaf to leaf; ‘t is sweet to view on high\n\nThe rainbow, based on ocean, span the sky.\n\n‘T is sweet to hear the watch-dog’s honest bark\n\nBay deep-mouth’d welcome as we draw near home;\n\n‘T is sweet to know there is an eye will mark\n\nOur coming, and look brighter when we come;\n\n‘T is sweet to be awaken’d by the lark,\n\nOr lull’d by falling waters; sweet the hum\n\nOf bees, the voice of girls, the song of birds,\n\nThe lisp of children, and their earliest words.\n\nSweet is the vintage, when the showering grapes\n\nIn Bacchanal profusion reel to earth,\n\nPurple and gushing: sweet are our escapes\n\nFrom civic revelry to rural mirth;\n\nSweet to the miser are his glittering heaps,\n\nSweet to the father is his first-born’s birth,\n\nSweet is revenge–especially to women,\n\nPillage to soldiers, prize-money to seamen.\n\nSweet is a legacy, and passing sweet\n\nThe unexpected death of some old lady\n\nOr gentleman of seventy years complete,\n\nWho ‘ve made ‘us youth’ wait too–too long already\n\nFor an estate, or cash, or country seat,\n\nStill breaking, but with stamina so steady\n\nThat all the Israelites are fit to mob its\n\nNext owner for their double-damn’d post-obits.\n\n‘T is sweet to win, no matter how, one’s laurels,\n\nBy blood or ink; ‘t is sweet to put an end\n\nTo strife; ‘t is sometimes sweet to have our quarrels,\n\nParticularly with a tiresome friend:\n\nSweet is old wine in bottles, ale in barrels;\n\nDear is the helpless creature we defend\n\nAgainst the world; and dear the schoolboy spot\n\nWe ne’er forget, though there we are forgot.\n\nBut sweeter still than this, than these, than all,\n\nIs first and passionate love–it stands alone,\n\nLike Adam’s recollection of his fall;\n\nThe tree of knowledge has been pluck’d–all ‘s known–\n\nAnd life yields nothing further to recall\n\nWorthy of this ambrosial sin, so shown,\n\nNo doubt in fable, as the unforgiven\n\nFire which Prometheus filch’d for us from heaven.\n\nMan ‘s a strange animal, and makes strange use\n\nOf his own nature, and the various arts,\n\nAnd likes particularly to produce\n\nSome new experiment to show his parts;\n\nThis is the age of oddities let loose,\n\nWhere different talents find their different marts;\n\nYou ‘d best begin with truth, and when you ‘ve lost your\n\nLabour, there ‘s a sure market for imposture.\n\nWhat opposite discoveries we have seen!\n\n(Signs of true genius, and of empty pockets.)\n\nOne makes new noses, one a guillotine,\n\nOne breaks your bones, one sets them in their sockets;\n\nBut vaccination certainly has been\n\nA kind antithesis to Congreve’s rockets,\n\nWith which the Doctor paid off an old pox,\n\nBy borrowing a new one from an ox.\n\nBread has been made (indifferent) from potatoes;\n\nAnd galvanism has set some corpses grinning,\n\nBut has not answer’d like the apparatus\n\nOf the Humane Society’s beginning\n\nBy which men are unsuffocated gratis:\n\nWhat wondrous new machines have late been spinning!\n\nI said the small-pox has gone out of late;\n\nPerhaps it may be follow’d by the great.\n\n‘T is said the great came from America;\n\nPerhaps it may set out on its return,–\n\nThe population there so spreads, they say\n\n‘T is grown high time to thin it in its turn,\n\nWith war, or plague, or famine, any way,\n\nSo that civilisation they may learn;\n\nAnd which in ravage the more loathsome evil is–\n\nTheir real lues, or our pseudo-syphilis?\n\nThis is the patent-age of new inventions\n\nFor killing bodies, and for saving souls,\n\nAll propagated with the best intentions;\n\nSir Humphry Davy’s lantern, by which coals\n\nAre safely mined for in the mode he mentions,\n\nTombuctoo travels, voyages to the Poles,\n\nAre ways to benefit mankind, as true,\n\nPerhaps, as shooting them at Waterloo.\n\nMan ‘s a phenomenon, one knows not what,\n\nAnd wonderful beyond all wondrous measure;\n\n‘T is pity though, in this sublime world, that\n\nPleasure ‘s a sin, and sometimes sin ‘s a pleasure;\n\nFew mortals know what end they would be at,\n\nBut whether glory, power, or love, or treasure,\n\nThe path is through perplexing ways, and when\n\nThe goal is gain’d, we die, you know–and then–\n\nWhat then?–I do not know, no more do you–\n\nAnd so good night.–Return we to our story:\n\n‘T was in November, when fine days are few,\n\nAnd the far mountains wax a little hoary,\n\nAnd clap a white cape on their mantles blue;\n\nAnd the sea dashes round the promontory,\n\nAnd the loud breaker boils against the rock,\n\nAnd sober suns must set at five o’clock.\n\n‘T was, as the watchmen say, a cloudy night;\n\nNo moon, no stars, the wind was low or loud\n\nBy gusts, and many a sparkling hearth was bright\n\nWith the piled wood, round which the family crowd;\n\nThere ‘s something cheerful in that sort of light,\n\nEven as a summer sky ‘s without a cloud:\n\nI ‘m fond of fire, and crickets, and all that,\n\nA lobster salad, and champagne, and chat.\n\n‘T was midnight–Donna Julia was in bed,\n\nSleeping, most probably,–when at her door\n\nArose a clatter might awake the dead,\n\nIf they had never been awoke before,\n\nAnd that they have been so we all have read,\n\nAnd are to be so, at the least, once more;–\n\nThe door was fasten’d, but with voice and fist\n\nFirst knocks were heard, then ‘Madam–Madam–hist!\n\n‘For God’s sake, Madam–Madam–here ‘s my master,\n\nWith more than half the city at his back–\n\nWas ever heard of such a curst disaster!\n\n‘T is not my fault–I kept good watch–Alack!\n\nDo pray undo the bolt a little faster–\n\nThey ‘re on the stair just now, and in a crack\n\nWill all be here; perhaps he yet may fly–\n\nSurely the window ‘s not so very high!’\n\nBy this time Don Alfonso was arrived,\n\nWith torches, friends, and servants in great number;\n\nThe major part of them had long been wived,\n\nAnd therefore paused not to disturb the slumber\n\nOf any wicked woman, who contrived\n\nBy stealth her husband’s temples to encumber:\n\nExamples of this kind are so contagious,\n\nWere one not punish’d, all would be outrageous.\n\nI can’t tell how, or why, or what suspicion\n\nCould enter into Don Alfonso’s head;\n\nBut for a cavalier of his condition\n\nIt surely was exceedingly ill-bred,\n\nWithout a word of previous admonition,\n\nTo hold a levee round his lady’s bed,\n\nAnd summon lackeys, arm’d with fire and sword,\n\nTo prove himself the thing he most abhorr’d.\n\nPoor Donna Julia, starting as from sleep\n\n(Mind–that I do not say–she had not slept),\n\nBegan at once to scream, and yawn, and weep;\n\nHer maid Antonia, who was an adept,\n\nContrived to fling the bed-clothes in a heap,\n\nAs if she had just now from out them crept:\n\nI can’t tell why she should take all this trouble\n\nTo prove her mistress had been sleeping double.\n\nBut Julia mistress, and Antonia maid,\n\nAppear’d like two poor harmless women, who\n\nOf goblins, but still more of men afraid,\n\nHad thought one man might be deterr’d by two,\n\nAnd therefore side by side were gently laid,\n\nUntil the hours of absence should run through,\n\nAnd truant husband should return, and say,\n\n‘My dear, I was the first who came away.’\n\nNow Julia found at length a voice, and cried,\n\n‘In heaven’s name, Don Alfonso, what d’ ye mean?\n\nHas madness seized you? would that I had died\n\nEre such a monster’s victim I had been!\n\nWhat may this midnight violence betide,\n\nA sudden fit of drunkenness or spleen?\n\nDare you suspect me, whom the thought would kill?\n\nSearch, then, the room!’–Alfonso said, ‘I will.’\n\nHe search’d, they search’d, and rummaged everywhere,\n\nCloset and clothes’ press, chest and window-seat,\n\nAnd found much linen, lace, and several pair\n\nOf stockings, slippers, brushes, combs, complete,\n\nWith other articles of ladies fair,\n\nTo keep them beautiful, or leave them neat:\n\nArras they prick’d and curtains with their swords,\n\nAnd wounded several shutters, and some boards.\n\nUnder the bed they search’d, and there they found–\n\nNo matter what–it was not that they sought;\n\nThey open’d windows, gazing if the ground\n\nHad signs or footmarks, but the earth said nought;\n\nAnd then they stared each other’s faces round:\n\n‘T is odd, not one of all these seekers thought,\n\nAnd seems to me almost a sort of blunder,\n\nOf looking in the bed as well as under.\n\nDuring this inquisition, Julia’s tongue\n\nWas not asleep–‘Yes, search and search,’ she cried,\n\n‘Insult on insult heap, and wrong on wrong!\n\nIt was for this that I became a bride!\n\nFor this in silence I have suffer’d long\n\nA husband like Alfonso at my side;\n\nBut now I ‘ll bear no more, nor here remain,\n\nIf there be law or lawyers in all Spain.\n\n‘Yes, Don Alfonso! husband now no more,\n\nIf ever you indeed deserved the name,\n\nIs ‘t worthy of your years?–you have threescore–\n\nFifty, or sixty, it is all the same–\n\nIs ‘t wise or fitting, causeless to explore\n\nFor facts against a virtuous woman’s fame?\n\nUngrateful, perjured, barbarous Don Alfonso,\n\nHow dare you think your lady would go on so?\n\n‘Is it for this I have disdain’d to hold\n\nThe common privileges of my sex?\n\nThat I have chosen a confessor so old\n\nAnd deaf, that any other it would vex,\n\nAnd never once he has had cause to scold,\n\nBut found my very innocence perplex\n\nSo much, he always doubted I was married–\n\nHow sorry you will be when I ‘ve miscarried!\n\n‘Was it for this that no Cortejo e’er\n\nI yet have chosen from out the youth of Seville?\n\nIs it for this I scarce went anywhere,\n\nExcept to bull-fights, mass, play, rout, and revel?\n\nIs it for this, whate’er my suitors were,\n\nI favor’d none–nay, was almost uncivil?\n\nIs it for this that General Count O’Reilly,\n\nWho took Algiers, declares I used him vilely?\n\n‘Did not the Italian Musico Cazzani\n\nSing at my heart six months at least in vain?\n\nDid not his countryman, Count Corniani,\n\nCall me the only virtuous wife in Spain?\n\nWere there not also Russians, English, many?\n\nThe Count Strongstroganoff I put in pain,\n\nAnd Lord Mount Coffeehouse, the Irish peer,\n\nWho kill’d himself for love (with wine) last year.\n\n‘Have I not had two bishops at my feet,\n\nThe Duke of Ichar, and Don Fernan Nunez?\n\nAnd is it thus a faithful wife you treat?\n\nI wonder in what quarter now the moon is:\n\nI praise your vast forbearance not to beat\n\nMe also, since the time so opportune is–\n\nO, valiant man! with sword drawn and cock’d trigger,\n\nNow, tell me, don’t you cut a pretty figure?\n\n‘Was it for this you took your sudden journey.\n\nUnder pretence of business indispensable\n\nWith that sublime of rascals your attorney,\n\nWhom I see standing there, and looking sensible\n\nOf having play’d the fool? though both I spurn, he\n\nDeserves the worst, his conduct ‘s less defensible,\n\nBecause, no doubt, ‘t was for his dirty fee,\n\nAnd not from any love to you nor me.\n\n‘If he comes here to take a deposition,\n\nBy all means let the gentleman proceed;\n\nYou ‘ve made the apartment in a fit condition:\n\nThere ‘s pen and ink for you, sir, when you need–\n\nLet every thing be noted with precision,\n\nI would not you for nothing should be fee’d–\n\nBut, as my maid ‘s undrest, pray turn your spies out.’\n\n‘Oh!’ sobb’d Antonia, ‘I could tear their eyes out.’\n\n‘There is the closet, there the toilet, there\n\nThe antechamber–search them under, over;\n\nThere is the sofa, there the great arm-chair,\n\nThe chimney–which would really hold a lover.\n\nI wish to sleep, and beg you will take care\n\nAnd make no further noise, till you discover\n\nThe secret cavern of this lurking treasure–\n\nAnd when ‘t is found, let me, too, have that pleasure.\n\n‘And now, Hidalgo! now that you have thrown\n\nDoubt upon me, confusion over all,\n\nPray have the courtesy to make it known\n\nWho is the man you search for? how d’ ye cal\n\nHim? what ‘s his lineage? let him but be shown–\n\nI hope he ‘s young and handsome–is he tall?\n\nTell me–and be assured, that since you stain\n\nMy honour thus, it shall not be in vain.\n\n‘At least, perhaps, he has not sixty years,\n\nAt that age he would be too old for slaughter,\n\nOr for so young a husband’s jealous fears\n\n(Antonia! let me have a glass of water).\n\nI am ashamed of having shed these tears,\n\nThey are unworthy of my father’s daughter;\n\nMy mother dream’d not in my natal hour\n\nThat I should fall into a monster’s power.\n\n‘Perhaps ‘t is of Antonia you are jealous,\n\nYou saw that she was sleeping by my side\n\nWhen you broke in upon us with your fellows:\n\nLook where you please–we ‘ve nothing, sir, to hide;\n\nOnly another time, I trust, you ‘ll tell us,\n\nOr for the sake of decency abide\n\nA moment at the door, that we may be\n\nDrest to receive so much good company.\n\n‘And now, sir, I have done, and say no more;\n\nThe little I have said may serve to show\n\nThe guileless heart in silence may grieve o’er\n\nThe wrongs to whose exposure it is slow:\n\nI leave you to your conscience as before,\n\n‘T will one day ask you why you used me so?\n\nGod grant you feel not then the bitterest grief!-\n\nAntonia! where ‘s my pocket-handkerchief?’\n\nShe ceased, and turn’d upon her pillow; pale\n\nShe lay, her dark eyes flashing through their tears,\n\nLike skies that rain and lighten; as a veil,\n\nWaved and o’ershading her wan cheek, appears\n\nHer streaming hair; the black curls strive, but fail,\n\nTo hide the glossy shoulder, which uprears\n\nIts snow through all;–her soft lips lie apart,\n\nAnd louder than her breathing beats her heart.\n\nThe Senhor Don Alfonso stood confused;\n\nAntonia bustled round the ransack’d room,\n\nAnd, turning up her nose, with looks abused\n\nHer master and his myrmidons, of whom\n\nNot one, except the attorney, was amused;\n\nHe, like Achates, faithful to the tomb,\n\nSo there were quarrels, cared not for the cause,\n\nKnowing they must be settled by the laws.\n\nWith prying snub-nose, and small eyes, he stood,\n\nFollowing Antonia’s motions here and there,\n\nWith much suspicion in his attitude;\n\nFor reputations he had little care;\n\nSo that a suit or action were made good,\n\nSmall pity had he for the young and fair,\n\nAnd ne’er believed in negatives, till these\n\nWere proved by competent false witnesses.\n\nBut Don Alfonso stood with downcast looks,\n\nAnd, truth to say, he made a foolish figure;\n\nWhen, after searching in five hundred nooks,\n\nAnd treating a young wife with so much rigour,\n\nHe gain’d no point, except some self-rebukes,\n\nAdded to those his lady with such vigour\n\nHad pour’d upon him for the last half-hour,\n\nQuick, thick, and heavy–as a thunder-shower.\n\nAt first he tried to hammer an excuse,\n\nTo which the sole reply was tears and sobs,\n\nAnd indications of hysterics, whose\n\nPrologue is always certain throes, and throbs,\n\nGasps, and whatever else the owners choose:\n\nAlfonso saw his wife, and thought of Job’s;\n\nHe saw too, in perspective, her relations,\n\nAnd then he tried to muster all his patience.\n\nHe stood in act to speak, or rather stammer,\n\nBut sage Antonia cut him short before\n\nThe anvil of his speech received the hammer,\n\nWith ‘Pray, sir, leave the room, and say no more,\n\nOr madam dies.’–Alfonso mutter’d, ‘D–n her,’\n\nBut nothing else, the time of words was o’er;\n\nHe cast a rueful look or two, and did,\n\nHe knew not wherefore, that which he was bid.\n\nWith him retired his ‘posse comitatus,’\n\nThe attorney last, who linger’d near the door\n\nReluctantly, still tarrying there as late as\n\nAntonia let him–not a little sore\n\nAt this most strange and unexplain’d ‘hiatus’\n\nIn Don Alfonso’s facts, which just now wore\n\nAn awkward look; as he revolved the case,\n\nThe door was fasten’d in his legal face.\n\nNo sooner was it bolted, than–Oh shame!\n\nO sin! Oh sorrow! and oh womankind!\n\nHow can you do such things and keep your fame,\n\nUnless this world, and t’ other too, be blind?\n\nNothing so dear as an unfilch’d good name!\n\nBut to proceed–for there is more behind:\n\nWith much heartfelt reluctance be it said,\n\nYoung Juan slipp’d half-smother’d, from the bed.\n\nHe had been hid–I don’t pretend to say\n\nHow, nor can I indeed describe the where–\n\nYoung, slender, and pack’d easily, he lay,\n\nNo doubt, in little compass, round or square;\n\nBut pity him I neither must nor may\n\nHis suffocation by that pretty pair;\n\n‘T were better, sure, to die so, than be shut\n\nWith maudlin Clarence in his Malmsey butt.\n\nAnd, secondly, I pity not, because\n\nHe had no business to commit a sin,\n\nForbid by heavenly, fined by human laws,\n\nAt least ‘t was rather early to begin;\n\nBut at sixteen the conscience rarely gnaws\n\nSo much as when we call our old debts in\n\nAt sixty years, and draw the accompts of evil,\n\nAnd find a deuced balance with the devil.\n\nOf his position I can give no notion:\n\n‘T is written in the Hebrew Chronicle,\n\nHow the physicians, leaving pill and potion,\n\nPrescribed, by way of blister, a young belle,\n\nWhen old King David’s blood grew dull in motion,\n\nAnd that the medicine answer’d very well;\n\nPerhaps ‘t was in a different way applied,\n\nFor David lived, but Juan nearly died.\n\nWhat ‘s to be done? Alfonso will be back\n\nThe moment he has sent his fools away.\n\nAntonia’s skill was put upon the rack,\n\nBut no device could be brought into play–\n\nAnd how to parry the renew’d attack?\n\nBesides, it wanted but few hours of day:\n\nAntonia puzzled; Julia did not speak,\n\nBut press’d her bloodless lip to Juan’s cheek.\n\nHe turn’d his lip to hers, and with his hand\n\nCall’d back the tangles of her wandering hair;\n\nEven then their love they could not all command,\n\nAnd half forgot their danger and despair:\n\nAntonia’s patience now was at a stand–\n\n‘Come, come, ‘t is no time now for fooling there,’\n\nShe whisper’d, in great wrath–‘I must deposit\n\nThis pretty gentleman within the closet:\n\n‘Pray, keep your nonsense for some luckier night–\n\nWho can have put my master in this mood?\n\nWhat will become on ‘t–I ‘m in such a fright,\n\nThe devil ‘s in the urchin, and no good–\n\nIs this a time for giggling? this a plight?\n\nWhy, don’t you know that it may end in blood?\n\nYou ‘ll lose your life, and I shall lose my place,\n\nMy mistress all, for that half-girlish face.\n\n‘Had it but been for a stout cavalier\n\nOf twenty-five or thirty (come, make haste)–\n\nBut for a child, what piece of work is here!\n\nI really, madam, wonder at your taste\n\n(Come, sir, get in)–my master must be near:\n\nThere, for the present, at the least, he’s fast,\n\nAnd if we can but till the morning keep\n\nOur counsel–(Juan, mind, you must not sleep).’\n\nNow, Don Alfonso entering, but alone,\n\nClosed the oration of the trusty maid:\n\nShe loiter’d, and he told her to be gone,\n\nAn order somewhat sullenly obey’d;\n\nHowever, present remedy was none,\n\nAnd no great good seem’d answer’d if she stay’d:\n\nRegarding both with slow and sidelong view,\n\nShe snuff’d the candle, curtsied, and withdrew.\n\nAlfonso paused a minute–then begun\n\nSome strange excuses for his late proceeding;\n\nHe would not justify what he had done,\n\nTo say the best, it was extreme ill-breeding;\n\nBut there were ample reasons for it, none\n\nOf which he specified in this his pleading:\n\nHis speech was a fine sample, on the whole,\n\nOf rhetoric, which the learn’d call ‘rigmarole.’\n\nJulia said nought; though all the while there rose\n\nA ready answer, which at once enables\n\nA matron, who her husband’s foible knows,\n\nBy a few timely words to turn the tables,\n\nWhich, if it does not silence, still must pose,–\n\nEven if it should comprise a pack of fables;\n\n‘T is to retort with firmness, and when he\n\nSuspects with one, do you reproach with three.\n\nJulia, in fact, had tolerable grounds,–\n\nAlfonso’s loves with Inez were well known,\n\nBut whether ‘t was that one’s own guilt confounds–\n\nBut that can’t be, as has been often shown,\n\nA lady with apologies abounds;–\n\nIt might be that her silence sprang alone\n\nFrom delicacy to Don Juan’s ear,\n\nTo whom she knew his mother’s fame was dear.\n\nThere might be one more motive, which makes two;\n\nAlfonso ne’er to Juan had alluded,–\n\nMention’d his jealousy but never who\n\nHad been the happy lover, he concluded,\n\nConceal’d amongst his premises; ‘t is true,\n\nHis mind the more o’er this its mystery brooded;\n\nTo speak of Inez now were, one may say,\n\nLike throwing Juan in Alfonso’s way.\n\nA hint, in tender cases, is enough;\n\nSilence is best, besides there is a tact\n\n(That modern phrase appears to me sad stuff,\n\nBut it will serve to keep my verse compact)-\n\nWhich keeps, when push’d by questions rather rough,\n\nA lady always distant from the fact:\n\nThe charming creatures lie with such a grace,\n\nThere ‘s nothing so becoming to the face.\n\nThey blush, and we believe them; at least I\n\nHave always done so; ‘t is of no great use,\n\nIn any case, attempting a reply,\n\nFor then their eloquence grows quite profuse;\n\nAnd when at length they ‘re out of breath, they sigh,\n\nAnd cast their languid eyes down, and let loose\n\nA tear or two, and then we make it up;\n\nAnd then–and then–and then–sit down and sup.\n\nAlfonso closed his speech, and begg’d her pardon,\n\nWhich Julia half withheld, and then half granted,\n\nAnd laid conditions he thought very hard on,\n\nDenying several little things he wanted:\n\nHe stood like Adam lingering near his garden,\n\nWith useless penitence perplex’d and haunted,\n\nBeseeching she no further would refuse,\n\nWhen, lo! he stumbled o’er a pair of shoes.\n\nA pair of shoes!–what then? not much, if they\n\nAre such as fit with ladies’ feet, but these\n\n(No one can tell how much I grieve to say)\n\nWere masculine; to see them, and to seize,\n\nWas but a moment’s act.–Ah! well-a-day!\n\nMy teeth begin to chatter, my veins freeze–\n\nAlfonso first examined well their fashion,\n\nAnd then flew out into another passion.\n\nHe left the room for his relinquish’d sword,\n\nAnd Julia instant to the closet flew.\n\n‘Fly, Juan, fly! for heaven’s sake–not a word–\n\nThe door is open–you may yet slip through\n\nThe passage you so often have explored–\n\nHere is the garden-key–Fly–fly–Adieu!\n\nHaste–haste! I hear Alfonso’s hurrying feet–\n\nDay has not broke–there ‘s no one in the street:\n\nNone can say that this was not good advice,\n\nThe only mischief was, it came too late;\n\nOf all experience ‘t is the usual price,\n\nA sort of income-tax laid on by fate:\n\nJuan had reach’d the room-door in a. trice,\n\nAnd might have done so by the garden-gate,\n\nBut met Alfonso in his dressing-gown,\n\nWho threaten’d death–so Juan knock’d him down.\n\nDire was the scuffle, and out went the light;\n\nAntonia cried out ‘Rape!’ and Julia ‘Fire!’\n\nBut not a servant stirr’d to aid the fight.\n\nAlfonso, pommell’d to his heart’s desire,\n\nSwore lustily he’d be revenged this night;\n\nAnd Juan, too, blasphemed an octave higher;\n\nHis blood was up: though young, he was a Tartar,\n\nAnd not at all disposed to prove a martyr.\n\nAlfonso’s sword had dropp’d ere he could draw it,\n\nAnd they continued battling hand to hand,\n\nFor Juan very luckily ne’er saw it;\n\nHis temper not being under great command,\n\nIf at that moment he had chanced to claw it,\n\nAlfonso’s days had not been in the land\n\nMuch longer.–Think of husbands’, lovers’ lives!\n\nAnd how ye may be doubly widows–wives!\n\nAlfonso grappled to detain the foe,\n\nAnd Juan throttled him to get away,\n\nAnd blood (‘t was from the nose) began to flow;\n\nAt last, as they more faintly wrestling lay,\n\nJuan contrived to give an awkward blow,\n\nAnd then his only garment quite gave way;\n\nHe fled, like Joseph, leaving it; but there,\n\nI doubt, all likeness ends between the pair.\n\nLights came at length, and men, and maids, who found\n\nAn awkward spectacle their eyes before;\n\nAntonia in hysterics, Julia swoon’d,\n\nAlfonso leaning, breathless, by the door;\n\nSome half-torn drapery scatter’d on the ground,\n\nSome blood, and several footsteps, but no more:\n\nJuan the gate gain’d, turn’d the key about,\n\nAnd liking not the inside, lock’d the out.\n\nHere ends this canto.–Need I sing, or say,\n\nHow Juan naked, favour’d by the night,\n\nWho favours what she should not, found his way,\n\nAnd reach’d his home in an unseemly plight?\n\nThe pleasant scandal which arose next day,\n\nThe nine days’ wonder which was brought to light,\n\nAnd how Alfonso sued for a divorce,\n\nWere in the English newspapers, of course.\n\nIf you would like to see the whole proceedings,\n\nThe depositions, and the cause at full,\n\nThe names of all the witnesses, the pleadings\n\nOf counsel to nonsuit, or to annul,\n\nThere ‘s more than one edition, and the readings\n\nAre various, but they none of them are dull;\n\nThe best is that in short-hand ta’en by Gurney,\n\nWho to Madrid on purpose made a journey.\n\nBut Donna Inez, to divert the train\n\nOf one of the most circulating scandals\n\nThat had for centuries been known in Spain,\n\nAt least since the retirement of the Vandals,\n\nFirst vow’d (and never had she vow’d in vain)\n\nTo Virgin Mary several pounds of candles;\n\nAnd then, by the advice of some old ladies,\n\nShe sent her son to be shipp’d off from Cadiz.\n\nShe had resolved that he should travel through\n\nAll European climes, by land or sea,\n\nTo mend his former morals, and get new,\n\nEspecially in France and Italy\n\n(At least this is the thing most people do).\n\nJulia was sent into a convent: she\n\nGrieved, but, perhaps, her feelings may be better\n\nShown in the following copy of her Letter:–\n\n‘They tell me ‘t is decided; you depart:\n\n‘T is wise–‘t is well, but not the less a pain;\n\nI have no further claim on your young heart,\n\nMine is the victim, and would be again;\n\nTo love too much has been the only art\n\nI used;–I write in haste, and if a stain\n\nBe on this sheet, ‘t is not what it appears;\n\nMy eyeballs burn and throb, but have no tears.\n\n‘I loved, I love you, for this love have lost\n\nState, station, heaven, mankind’s, my own esteem,\n\nAnd yet can not regret what it hath cost,\n\nSo dear is still the memory of that dream;\n\nYet, if I name my guilt, ‘t is not to boast,\n\nNone can deem harshlier of me than I deem:\n\nI trace this scrawl because I cannot rest–\n\nI ‘ve nothing to reproach, or to request.\n\n‘Man’s love is of man’s life a thing apart,\n\n‘T is woman’s whole existence; man may range\n\nThe court, camp, church, the vessel, and the mart;\n\nSword, gown, gain, glory, offer in exchange\n\nPride, fame, ambition, to fill up his heart,\n\nAnd few there are whom these cannot estrange;\n\nMen have all these resources, we but one,\n\nTo love again, and be again undone.\n\n‘You will proceed in pleasure, and in pride,\n\nBeloved and loving many; all is o’er\n\nFor me on earth, except some years to hide\n\nMy shame and sorrow deep in my heart’s core;\n\nThese I could bear, but cannot cast aside\n\nThe passion which still rages as before–\n\nAnd so farewell–forgive me, love me–No,\n\nThat word is idle now–but let it go.\n\n‘My breast has been all weakness, is so yet;\n\nBut still I think I can collect my mind;\n\nMy blood still rushes where my spirit ‘s set,\n\nAs roll the waves before the settled wind;\n\nMy heart is feminine, nor can forget–\n\nTo all, except one image, madly blind;\n\nSo shakes the needle, and so stands the pole,\n\nAs vibrates my fond heart to my fix’d soul.\n\n‘I have no more to say, but linger still,\n\nAnd dare not set my seal upon this sheet,\n\nAnd yet I may as well the task fulfil,\n\nMy misery can scarce be more complete:\n\nI had not lived till now, could sorrow kill;\n\nDeath shuns the wretch who fain the blow would meet,\n\nAnd I must even survive this last adieu,\n\nAnd bear with life, to love and pray for you!’\n\nThis note was written upon gilt-edged paper\n\nWith a neat little crow-quill, slight and new:\n\nHer small white hand could hardly reach the taper,\n\nIt trembled as magnetic needles do,\n\nAnd yet she did not let one tear escape her;\n\nThe seal a sun-flower; ‘Elle vous suit partout,’\n\nThe motto cut upon a white cornelian;\n\nThe wax was superfine, its hue vermilion.\n\nThis was Don Juan’s earliest scrape; but whether\n\nI shall proceed with his adventures is\n\nDependent on the public altogether;\n\nWe ‘ll see, however, what they say to this:\n\nTheir favour in an author’s cap ‘s a feather,\n\nAnd no great mischief ‘s done by their caprice;\n\nAnd if their approbation we experience,\n\nPerhaps they ‘ll have some more about a year hence.\n\nMy poem ‘s epic, and is meant to be\n\nDivided in twelve books; each book containing,\n\nWith love, and war, a heavy gale at sea,\n\nA list of ships, and captains, and kings reigning,\n\nNew characters; the episodes are three:\n\nA panoramic view of hell ‘s in training,\n\nAfter the style of Virgil and of Homer,\n\nSo that my name of Epic ‘s no misnomer.\n\nAll these things will be specified in time,\n\nWith strict regard to Aristotle’s rules,\n\nThe Vade Mecum of the true sublime,\n\nWhich makes so many poets, and some fools:\n\nProse poets like blank-verse, I ‘m fond of rhyme,\n\nGood workmen never quarrel with their tools;\n\nI ‘ve got new mythological machinery,\n\nAnd very handsome supernatural scenery.\n\nThere ‘s only one slight difference between\n\nMe and my epic brethren gone before,\n\nAnd here the advantage is my own, I ween\n\n(Not that I have not several merits more,\n\nBut this will more peculiarly be seen);\n\nThey so embellish, that ‘t is quite a bore\n\nTheir labyrinth of fables to thread through,\n\nWhereas this story ‘s actually true.\n\nIf any person doubt it, I appeal\n\nTo history, tradition, and to facts,\n\nTo newspapers, whose truth all know and feel,\n\nTo plays in five, and operas in three acts;\n\nAll these confirm my statement a good deal,\n\nBut that which more completely faith exacts\n\nIs that myself, and several now in Seville,\n\nSaw Juan’s last elopement with the devil.\n\nIf ever I should condescend to prose,\n\nI ‘ll write poetical commandments, which\n\nShall supersede beyond all doubt all those\n\nThat went before; in these I shall enrich\n\nMy text with many things that no one knows,\n\nAnd carry precept to the highest pitch:\n\nI ‘ll call the work ‘Longinus o’er a Bottle,\n\nOr, Every Poet his own Aristotle.’\n\nThou shalt believe in Milton, Dryden, Pope;\n\nThou shalt not set up Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey;\n\nBecause the first is crazed beyond all hope,\n\nThe second drunk, the third so quaint and mouthy:\n\nWith Crabbe it may be difficult to cope,\n\nAnd Campbell’s Hippocrene is somewhat drouthy:\n\nThou shalt not steal from Samuel Rogers, nor\n\nCommit–flirtation with the muse of Moore.\n\nThou shalt not covet Mr. Sotheby’s Muse,\n\nHis Pegasus, nor anything that ‘s his;\n\nThou shalt not bear false witness like ‘the Blues’\n\n(There ‘s one, at least, is very fond of this);\n\nThou shalt not write, in short, but what I choose:\n\nThis is true criticism, and you may kiss–\n\nExactly as you please, or not,–the rod;\n\nIf any person should presume to assert\n\nThis story is not moral, first, I pray,\n\nThat they will not cry out before they ‘re hurt,\n\nThen that they ‘ll read it o’er again, and say\n\n(But, doubtless, nobody will be so pert)\n\nThat this is not a moral tale, though gay;\n\nBesides, in Canto Twelfth, I mean to show\n\nThe very place where wicked people go.\n\nIf, after all, there should be some so blind\n\nTo their own good this warning to despise,\n\nLed by some tortuosity of mind,\n\nNot to believe my verse and their own eyes,\n\nAnd cry that they ‘the moral cannot find,’\n\nI tell him, if a clergyman, he lies;\n\nShould captains the remark, or critics, make,\n\nThey also lie too–under a mistake.\n\nThe public approbation I expect,\n\nAnd beg they ‘ll take my word about the moral,\n\nWhich I with their amusement will connect\n\n(So children cutting teeth receive a coral);\n\nMeantime, they ‘ll doubtless please to recollect\n\nMy epical pretensions to the laurel:\n\nFor fear some prudish readers should grow skittish,\n\nI ‘ve bribed my grandmother’s review–the British.\n\nI sent it in a letter to the Editor,\n\nWho thank’d me duly by return of post–\n\nI ‘m for a handsome article his creditor;\n\nYet, if my gentle Muse he please to roast,\n\nAnd break a promise after having made it her,\n\nDenying the receipt of what it cost,\n\nAnd smear his page with gall instead of honey,\n\nAll I can say is–that he had the money.\n\nI think that with this holy new alliance\n\nI may ensure the public, and defy\n\nAll other magazines of art or science,\n\nDaily, or monthly, or three monthly; I\n\nHave not essay’d to multiply their clients,\n\nBecause they tell me ‘t were in vain to try,\n\nAnd that the Edinburgh Review and Quarterly\n\nTreat a dissenting author very martyrly.\n\n‘Non ego hoc ferrem calida juventa\n\nConsule Planco,’ Horace said, and so\n\nSay I; by which quotation there is meant a\n\nHint that some six or seven good years ago\n\n(Long ere I dreamt of dating from the Brenta)\n\nI was most ready to return a blow,\n\nAnd would not brook at all this sort of thing\n\nIn my hot youth–when George the Third was King.\n\nBut now at thirty years my hair is grey\n\n(I wonder what it will be like at forty?\n\nI thought of a peruke the other day)–\n\nMy heart is not much greener; and, in short, I\n\nHave squander’d my whole summer while ‘t was May,\n\nAnd feel no more the spirit to retort; I\n\nHave spent my life, both interest and principal,\n\nAnd deem not, what I deem’d, my soul invincible.\n\nNo more–no more–Oh! never more on me\n\nThe freshness of the heart can fall like dew,\n\nWhich out of all the lovely things we see\n\nExtracts emotions beautiful and new,\n\nHived in our bosoms like the bag o’ the bee:\n\nThink’st thou the honey with those objects grew?\n\nAlas! ‘t was not in them, but in thy power\n\nTo double even the sweetness of a flower.\n\nNo more–no more–Oh! never more, my heart,\n\nCanst thou be my sole world, my universe!\n\nOnce all in all, but now a thing apart,\n\nThou canst not be my blessing or my curse:\n\nThe illusion ‘s gone for ever, and thou art\n\nInsensible, I trust, but none the worse,\n\nAnd in thy stead I ‘ve got a deal of judgment,\n\nThough heaven knows how it ever found a lodgment.\n\nMy days of love are over; me no more\n\nThe charms of maid, wife, and still less of widow,\n\nCan make the fool of which they made before,–\n\nIn short, I must not lead the life I did do;\n\nThe credulous hope of mutual minds is o’er,\n\nThe copious use of claret is forbid too,\n\nSo for a good old-gentlemanly vice,\n\nI think I must take up with avarice.\n\nAmbition was my idol, which was broken\n\nBefore the shrines of Sorrow, and of Pleasure;\n\nAnd the two last have left me many a token\n\nO’er which reflection may be made at leisure:\n\nNow, like Friar Bacon’s brazen head, I ‘ve spoken,\n\n‘Time is, Time was, Time ‘s past:’–a chymic treasure\n\nIs glittering youth, which I have spent betimes–\n\nMy heart in passion, and my head on rhymes.\n\nWhat is the end of Fame? ‘t is but to fill\n\nA certain portion of uncertain paper:\n\nSome liken it to climbing up a hill,\n\nWhose summit, like all hills, is lost in vapour;\n\nFor this men write, speak, preach, and heroes kill,\n\nAnd bards burn what they call their ‘midnight taper,’\n\nTo have, when the original is dust,\n\nA name, a wretched picture, and worse bust.\n\nWhat are the hopes of man? Old Egypt’s King\n\nCheops erected the first pyramid\n\nAnd largest, thinking it was just the thing\n\nTo keep his memory whole, and mummy hid;\n\nBut somebody or other rummaging,\n\nBurglariously broke his coffin’s lid:\n\nLet not a monument give you or me hopes,\n\nSince not a pinch of dust remains of Cheops.\n\nBut I being fond of true philosophy,\n\nSay very often to myself, ‘Alas!\n\nAll things that have been born were born to die,\n\nAnd flesh (which Death mows down to hay) is grass;\n\nYou ‘ve pass’d your youth not so unpleasantly,\n\nAnd if you had it o’er again–‘t would pass–\n\nSo thank your stars that matters are no worse,\n\nAnd read your Bible, sir, and mind your purse.’\n\nBut for the present, gentle reader! and\n\nStill gentler purchaser! the bard–that ‘s I–\n\nMust, with permission, shake you by the hand,\n\nAnd so ‘Your humble servant, and good-b’ye!’\n\nWe meet again, if we should understand\n\nEach other; and if not, I shall not try\n\nYour patience further than by this short sample–\n\n‘T were well if others follow’d my example.\n\n‘Go, little book, from this my solitude!\n\nI cast thee on the waters–go thy ways!\n\nAnd if, as I believe, thy vein be good,\n\nThe world will find thee after many days.’\n\nWhen Southey’s read, and Wordsworth understood,\n\nI can’t help putting in my claim to praise–\n\nThe four first rhymes are Southey’s every line:\n\nFor God’s sake, reader! take them not for mine.\n\n[Illustration: Canto 2]\n\nCANTO THE SECOND.\n\nO ye! who teach the ingenuous youth of nations,\n\nHolland, France, England, Germany, or Spain,\n\nI pray ye flog them upon all occasions,\n\nIt mends their morals, never mind the pain:\n\nThe best of mothers and of educations\n\nIn Juan’s case were but employ’d in vain,\n\nSince, in a way that ‘s rather of the oddest, he\n\nBecame divested of his native modesty.\n\nHad he but been placed at a public school,\n\nIn the third form, or even in the fourth,\n\nHis daily task had kept his fancy cool,\n\nAt least, had he been nurtured in the north;\n\nSpain may prove an exception to the rule,\n\nBut then exceptions always prove its worth–\n\nA lad of sixteen causing a divorce\n\nPuzzled his tutors very much, of course.\n\nI can’t say that it puzzles me at all,\n\nIf all things be consider’d: first, there was\n\nHis lady–mother, mathematical,\n\nA–never mind; his tutor, an old ass;\n\nA pretty woman (that ‘s quite natural,\n\nOr else the thing had hardly come to pass);\n\nA husband rather old, not much in unity\n\nWith his young wife–a time, and opportunity.\n\nWell–well, the world must turn upon its axis,\n\nAnd all mankind turn with it, heads or tails,\n\nAnd live and die, make love and pay our taxes,\n\nAnd as the veering wind shifts, shift our sails;\n\nThe king commands us, and the doctor quacks us,\n\nThe priest instructs, and so our life exhales,\n\nA little breath, love, wine, ambition, fame,\n\nFighting, devotion, dust,–perhaps a name.\n\nI said that Juan had been sent to Cadiz–\n\nA pretty town, I recollect it well–\n\n‘T is there the mart of the colonial trade is\n\n(Or was, before Peru learn’d to rebel),\n\nAnd such sweet girls–I mean, such graceful ladies,\n\nTheir very walk would make your bosom swell;\n\nI can’t describe it, though so much it strike,\n\nNor liken it–I never saw the like:\n\nAn Arab horse, a stately stag, a barb\n\nNew broke, a cameleopard, a gazelle,\n\nNo–none of these will do;–and then their garb!\n\nTheir veil and petticoat–Alas! to dwell\n\nUpon such things would very near absorb\n\nA canto–then their feet and ankles,–well,\n\nThank Heaven I ‘ve got no metaphor quite ready\n\n(And so, my sober Muse–come, let ‘s be steady–\n\nChaste Muse!–well, if you must, you must)–the veil\n\nThrown back a moment with the glancing hand,\n\nWhile the o’erpowering eye, that turns you pale,\n\nFlashes into the heart:–All sunny land\n\nOf love! when I forget you, may I fail\n\nTo–say my prayers–but never was there plann’d\n\nA dress through which the eyes give such a volley,\n\nExcepting the Venetian Fazzioli.\n\nBut to our tale: the Donna Inez sent\n\nHer son to Cadiz only to embark;\n\nTo stay there had not answer’d her intent,\n\nBut why?–we leave the reader in the dark–\n\n‘T was for a voyage that the young man was meant,\n\nAs if a Spanish ship were Noah’s ark,\n\nTo wean him from the wickedness of earth,\n\nAnd send him like a dove of promise forth.\n\nDon Juan bade his valet pack his things\n\nAccording to direction, then received\n\nA lecture and some money: for four springs\n\nHe was to travel; and though Inez grieved\n\n(As every kind of parting has its stings),\n\nShe hoped he would improve–perhaps believed:\n\nA letter, too, she gave (he never read it)\n\nOf good advice–and two or three of credit.\n\nIn the mean time, to pass her hours away,\n\nBrave Inez now set up a Sunday school\n\nFor naughty children, who would rather play\n\n(Like truant rogues) the devil, or the fool;\n\nInfants of three years old were taught that day,\n\nDunces were whipt, or set upon a stool:\n\nThe great success of Juan’s education,\n\nSpurr’d her to teach another generation.\n\nJuan embark’d–the ship got under way,\n\nThe wind was fair, the water passing rough:\n\nA devil of a sea rolls in that bay,\n\nAs I, who ‘ve cross’d it oft, know well enough;\n\nAnd, standing upon deck, the dashing spray\n\nFlies in one’s face, and makes it weather-tough:\n\nAnd there he stood to take, and take again,\n\nHis first–perhaps his last–farewell of Spain.\n\nI can’t but say it is an awkward sight\n\nTo see one’s native land receding through\n\nThe growing waters; it unmans one quite,\n\nEspecially when life is rather new:\n\nI recollect Great Britain’s coast looks white,\n\nBut almost every other country ‘s blue,\n\nWhen gazing on them, mystified by distance,\n\nWe enter on our nautical existence.\n\nSo Juan stood, bewilder’d on the deck:\n\nThe wind sung, cordage strain’d, and sailors swore,\n\nAnd the ship creak’d, the town became a speck,\n\nFrom which away so fair and fast they bore.\n\nThe best of remedies is a beef-steak\n\nAgainst sea-sickness: try it, sir, before\n\nYou sneer, and I assure you this is true,\n\nFor I have found it answer–so may you.\n\nDon Juan stood, and, gazing from the stern,\n\nBeheld his native Spain receding far:\n\nFirst partings form a lesson hard to learn,\n\nEven nations feel this when they go to war;\n\nThere is a sort of unexprest concern,\n\nA kind of shock that sets one’s heart ajar:\n\nAt leaving even the most unpleasant people\n\nAnd places, one keeps looking at the steeple.\n\nBut Juan had got many things to leave,\n\nHis mother, and a mistress, and no wife,\n\nSo that he had much better cause to grieve\n\nThan many persons more advanced in life;\n\nAnd if we now and then a sigh must heave\n\nAt quitting even those we quit in strife,\n\nNo doubt we weep for those the heart endears–\n\nThat is, till deeper griefs congeal our tears.\n\nSo Juan wept, as wept the captive Jews\n\nBy Babel’s waters, still remembering Sion:\n\nI ‘d weep,–but mine is not a weeping Muse,\n\nAnd such light griefs are not a thing to die on;\n\nYoung men should travel, if but to amuse\n\nThemselves; and the next time their servants tie on\n\nBehind their carriages their new portmanteau,\n\nPerhaps it may be lined with this my canto.\n\nAnd Juan wept, and much he sigh’d and thought,\n\nWhile his salt tears dropp’d into the salt sea,\n\n‘Sweets to the sweet’ (I like so much to quote;\n\nYou must excuse this extract, ‘t is where she,\n\nThe Queen of Denmark, for Ophelia brought\n\nFlowers to the grave); and, sobbing often, he\n\nReflected on his present situation,\n\nAnd seriously resolved on reformation.\n\n‘Farewell, my Spain! a long farewell!’ he cried,\n\n‘Perhaps I may revisit thee no more,\n\nBut die, as many an exiled heart hath died,\n\nOf its own thirst to see again thy shore:\n\nFarewell, where Guadalquivir’s waters glide!\n\nFarewell, my mother! and, since all is o’er,\n\nFarewell, too, dearest Julia!–(Here he drew\n\nHer letter out again, and read it through.)\n\n‘And, oh! if e’er I should forget, I swear–\n\nBut that ‘s impossible, and cannot be–\n\nSooner shall this blue ocean melt to air,\n\nSooner shall earth resolve itself to sea,\n\nThan I resign thine image, oh, my fair!\n\nOr think of any thing excepting thee;\n\nA mind diseased no remedy can physic\n\n(Here the ship gave a lurch, and he grew sea-sick).\n\n‘Sooner shall heaven kiss earth (here he fell sicker),\n\nO, Julia! what is every other wo?\n\n(For God’s sake let me have a glass of liquor;\n\nPedro, Battista, help me down below.)\n\nJulia, my love! (you rascal, Pedro, quicker)–\n\nO, Julia! (this curst vessel pitches so)–\n\nBeloved Julia, hear me still beseeching!’\n\n(Here he grew inarticulate with retching.)\n\nHe felt that chilling heaviness of heart,\n\nOr rather stomach, which, alas! attends,\n\nBeyond the best apothecary’s art,\n\nThe loss of love, the treachery of friends,\n\nOr death of those we dote on, when a part\n\nOf us dies with them as each fond hope ends:\n\nNo doubt he would have been much more pathetic,\n\nBut the sea acted as a strong emetic. I\n\nLove ‘s a capricious power: I ‘ve known it hold\n\nOut through a fever caused by its own heat,\n\nBut be much puzzled by a cough and cold,\n\nAnd find a quincy very hard to treat;\n\nAgainst all noble maladies he ‘s bold,\n\nBut vulgar illnesses don’t like to meet,\n\nNor that a sneeze should interrupt his sigh,\n\nNor inflammations redden his blind eye.\n\nBut worst of all is nausea, or a pain\n\nAbout the lower region of the bowels;\n\nLove, who heroically breathes a vein,\n\nShrinks from the application of hot towels,\n\nAnd purgatives are dangerous to his reign,\n\nSea-sickness death: his love was perfect, how else\n\nCould Juan’s passion, while the billows roar,\n\nResist his stomach, ne’er at sea before?\n\nThe ship, call’d the most holy ‘Trinidada,’\n\nWas steering duly for the port Leghorn;\n\nFor there the Spanish family Moncada\n\nWere settled long ere Juan’s sire was born:\n\nThey were relations, and for them he had a\n\nLetter of introduction, which the morn\n\nOf his departure had been sent him by\n\nHis Spanish friends for those in Italy.\n\nHis suite consisted of three servants and\n\nA tutor, the licentiate Pedrillo,\n\nWho several languages did understand,\n\nBut now lay sick and speechless on his pillow,\n\nAnd rocking in his hammock, long’d for land,\n\nHis headache being increased by every billow;\n\nAnd the waves oozing through the port-hole made\n\nHis berth a little damp, and him afraid.\n\n‘T was not without some reason, for the wind\n\nIncreased at night, until it blew a gale;\n\nAnd though ‘t was not much to a naval mind,\n\nSome landsmen would have look’d a little pale,\n\nFor sailors are, in fact, a different kind:\n\nAt sunset they began to take in sail,\n\nFor the sky show’d it would come on to blow,\n\nAnd carry away, perhaps, a mast or so.\n\nAt one o’clock the wind with sudden shift\n\nThrew the ship right into the trough of the sea,\n\nWhich struck her aft, and made an awkward rift,\n\nStarted the stern-post, also shatter’d the\n\nWhole of her stern-frame, and, ere she could lift\n\nHerself from out her present jeopardy,\n\nThe rudder tore away: ‘t was time to sound\n\nThe pumps, and there were four feet water found.\n\nOne gang of people instantly was put\n\nUpon the pumps and the remainder set\n\nTo get up part of the cargo, and what not;\n\nBut they could not come at the leak as yet;\n\nAt last they did get at it really, but\n\nStill their salvation was an even bet:\n\nThe water rush’d through in a way quite puzzling,\n\nWhile they thrust sheets, shirts, jackets, bales of muslin,\n\nInto the opening; but all such ingredients\n\nWould have been vain, and they must have gone down,\n\nDespite of all their efforts and expedients,\n\nBut for the pumps: I ‘m glad to make them known\n\nTo all the brother tars who may have need hence,\n\nFor fifty tons of water were upthrown\n\nBy them per hour, and they had all been undone,\n\nBut for the maker, Mr. Mann, of London.\n\nAs day advanced the weather seem’d to abate,\n\nAnd then the leak they reckon’d to reduce,\n\nAnd keep the ship afloat, though three feet yet\n\nKept two hand and one chain-pump still in use.\n\nThe wind blew fresh again: as it grew late\n\nA squall came on, and while some guns broke loose,\n\nA gust–which all descriptive power transcends–\n\nLaid with one blast the ship on her beam ends.\n\nThere she lay motionless, and seem’d upset;\n\nThe water left the hold, and wash’d the decks,\n\nAnd made a scene men do not soon forget;\n\nFor they remember battles, fires, and wrecks,\n\nOr any other thing that brings regret,\n\nOr breaks their hopes, or hearts, or heads, or necks:\n\nThus drownings are much talk’d of by the divers,\n\nAnd swimmers, who may chance to be survivors.\n\nImmediately the masts were cut away,\n\nBoth main and mizen; first the mizen went,\n\nThe main-mast follow’d: but the ship still lay\n\nLike a mere log, and baffled our intent.\n\nForemast and bowsprit were cut down, and they\n\nEased her at last (although we never meant\n\nTo part with all till every hope was blighted),\n\nAnd then with violence the old ship righted.\n\nIt may be easily supposed, while this\n\nWas going on, some people were unquiet,\n\nThat passengers would find it much amiss\n\nTo lose their lives, as well as spoil their diet;\n\nThat even the able seaman, deeming his\n\nDays nearly o’er, might be disposed to riot,\n\nAs upon such occasions tars will ask\n\nFor grog, and sometimes drink rum from the cask.\n\nThere ‘s nought, no doubt, so much the spirit calms\n\nAs rum and true religion: thus it was,\n\nSome plunder’d, some drank spirits, some sung psalms,\n\nThe high wind made the treble, and as bas\n\nThe hoarse harsh waves kept time; fright cured the qualms\n\nOf all the luckless landsmen’s sea-sick maws:\n\nStrange sounds of wailing, blasphemy, devotion,\n\nClamour’d in chorus to the roaring ocean.\n\nPerhaps more mischief had been done, but for\n\nOur Juan, who, with sense beyond his years,\n\nGot to the spirit-room, and stood before\n\nIt with a pair of pistols; and their fears,\n\nAs if Death were more dreadful by his door\n\nOf fire than water, spite of oaths and tears,\n\nKept still aloof the crew, who, ere they sunk,\n\nThought it would be becoming to die drunk.\n\n‘Give us more grog,’ they cried, ‘for it will be\n\nAll one an hour hence.’ Juan answer’d, ‘No!\n\n‘T is true that death awaits both you and me,\n\nBut let us die like men, not sink below\n\nLike brutes;’–and thus his dangerous post kept he,\n\nAnd none liked to anticipate the blow;\n\nAnd even Pedrillo, his most reverend tutor,\n\nWas for some rum a disappointed suitor.\n\nThe good old gentleman was quite aghast,\n\nAnd made a loud and pious lamentation;\n\nRepented all his sins, and made a last\n\nIrrevocable vow of reformation;\n\nNothing should tempt him more (this peril past)\n\nTo quit his academic occupation,\n\nIn cloisters of the classic Salamanca,\n\nTo follow Juan’s wake, like Sancho Panca.\n\nBut now there came a flash of hope once more;\n\nDay broke, and the wind lull’d: the masts were gone,\n\nThe leak increased; shoals round her, but no shore,\n\nThe vessel swam, yet still she held her own.\n\nThey tried the pumps again, and though before\n\nTheir desperate efforts seem’d all useless grown,\n\nA glimpse of sunshine set some hands to bale–\n\nThe stronger pump’d, the weaker thrumm’d a sail.\n\nUnder the vessel’s keel the sail was past,\n\nAnd for the moment it had some effect;\n\nBut with a leak, and not a stick of mast,\n\nNor rag of canvas, what could they expect?\n\nBut still ‘t is best to struggle to the last,\n\n‘T is never too late to be wholly wreck’d:\n\nAnd though ‘t is true that man can only die once,\n\n‘T is not so pleasant in the Gulf of Lyons.\n\nThere winds and waves had hurl’d them, and from thence,\n\nWithout their will, they carried them away;\n\nFor they were forced with steering to dispense,\n\nAnd never had as yet a quiet day\n\nOn which they might repose, or even commence\n\nA jurymast or rudder, or could say\n\nThe ship would swim an hour, which, by good luck,\n\nStill swam–though not exactly like a duck.\n\nThe wind, in fact, perhaps was rather less,\n\nBut the ship labour’d so, they scarce could hope\n\nTo weather out much longer; the distress\n\nWas also great with which they had to cope\n\nFor want of water, and their solid mess\n\nWas scant enough: in vain the telescope\n\nWas used–nor sail nor shore appear’d in sight,\n\nNought but the heavy sea, and coming night.\n\nAgain the weather threaten’d,–again blew\n\nA gale, and in the fore and after hold\n\nWater appear’d; yet, though the people knew\n\nAll this, the most were patient, and some bold,\n\nUntil the chains and leathers were worn through\n\nOf all our pumps:–a wreck complete she roll’d,\n\nAt mercy of the waves, whose mercies are\n\nLike human beings during civil war.\n\nThen came the carpenter, at last, with tears\n\nIn his rough eyes, and told the captain he\n\nCould do no more: he was a man in years,\n\nAnd long had voyaged through many a stormy sea,\n\nAnd if he wept at length, they were not fears\n\nThat made his eyelids as a woman’s be,\n\nBut he, poor fellow, had a wife and children,–\n\nTwo things for dying people quite bewildering.\n\nThe ship was evidently settling now\n\nFast by the head; and, all distinction gone,\n\nSome went to prayers again, and made a vow\n\nOf candles to their saints–but there were none\n\nTo pay them with; and some look’d o’er the bow;\n\nSome hoisted out the boats; and there was one\n\nThat"
