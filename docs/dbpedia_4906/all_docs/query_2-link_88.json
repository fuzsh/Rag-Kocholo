Having started out in a van, serving coffee and snacks around music festivals, then opening a cafe in Melbourne, before moving up to Byron and starting Combi cafe, and most recently opening Vagabond at Habitat, they're true wanderers. We chatted to the couple about plant-based treats, what attracted them to Habitat, and if they could make a smoothie for anyone, living or dead, who'd it be.\n\nWhat’s Vagabond?\n\nVagabond is a plant-based cafe where we value our local community.\n\nWe're focused on creating connection and using local produce as much as we can. We really wanted to create a space that not only looked good but felt good too.\n\nYour last cafe, Combi, is hugely popular, what do you attribute that to?\n\nGood coffee, food and staff, plus good vibes.\n\nWhat attracted you to Habitat?\n\nThe neighbourhood village feel.\n\nTell us about one or two menu items you most love sharing?\n\nOur soul nourishing Kitchari (soup) and heart-warming rosemary and lemon cake, both made on site.\n\nWhat’s the most rewarding thing about the work you do?\n\nCreating a beautiful space and nourishing food where people can come and connect.\n\nWhat’s the best piece of business advice you’ve ever been given?\n\nDo everything with a smile.\n\nIf you could make a smoothie for anyone, living or dead, who would it be?\n\nWe love people with a good heart, good intentions and good vibes. Kind and creative people like Drew Barrymore, Paul McCartney and Jane Goodall. But to be honest, we love making smoothies for all of our customers!\n\nDid the decision to make Vagabond a plant-based cafe come from a health or moral stance?\n\nNeither – it’s just how we like to eat.\n\nAny exciting plans for the future of Vagabond?\n\nWe're always evolving and moving forward with what we offer. There will always be exciting things happening.\n\nWhy should people come and check you out?\n\nBecause Vagabond isn’t just a place, it’s a vibe. It was always our intention to create a space that attracted people to more than just the food and we love that we have really created a community here :)\n\nYou can visit Vagabond and soak up the vibe (and the smoothies) Mon - Sat, 6.30am - 3pm (food served until 2pm).\n\n________"
