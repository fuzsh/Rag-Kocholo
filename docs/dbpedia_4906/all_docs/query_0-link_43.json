As of 2016, the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) has established provincial requirements under the Accessibility Standard for the Design of Public Spaces.\n\nThe goal of the legislation is to make sure that new or redeveloped public spaces such as parks, pathways, parking lots and playgrounds will serve the needs of all users. This includes children, seniors, parents with strollers, as well as people with a wide variety of disabilities and those using various mobility assistance devices.\n\nMore specifically, the Accessibility Standard for the Design of Public Spaces covers:\n\nExterior paths of travel\n\nRecreational trails\n\nBeach access routes\n\nOutdoor public use eating areas\n\nOutdoor play spaces\n\nAccessible parking\n\nObtaining services in public spaces (indoor and outdoor)\n\nThe Standard also includes requirements on consulting with the public and people with disabilities as well as maintaining accessible public spaces.\n\nDesign standards\n\nThe City of London is committed to removing and preventing barriers for people with disabilities by meeting and in some cases exceeding AODA requirements when designing or upgrading parks and public spaces.\n\nThe Illustrated Technical Guide to the Accessibility Standard for the Design of Public Spaces published by Global Alliance on Accessible Technologies and Environments (GAATES) is an excellent reference document, highlighting the minimum requirements of AODA as well as suggested best practices.\n\nConsultation on current park projects\n\nUnder the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) large public sector organizations, like the City of London, are required to consult with the public and people with disabilities on the design of public spaces, more specifically on:\n\nRecreational trails;\n\nOutdoor play spaces;\n\nRest areas along exterior paths of travel, and;\n\nAccessible on-street parking.\n\nTo provide comments on parks and playground projects that are in the planning phase, please visit our current park projects page where a list of current projects with a short description and contact person for each can be found. Project names followed with “A” are open for comments regarding accessibility.\n\nAlternative formats of any documents posted are available upon request by contacting accessibility@london.ca.\n\nAccessible planters in community gardens\n\nRaised planters are available in some of our community gardens.
