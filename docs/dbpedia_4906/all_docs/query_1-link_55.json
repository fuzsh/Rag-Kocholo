        "text": "Northern offers its 7,600 students an abundance of opportunities to explore their interests in and out of the classroom. From our brand new residence halls to our groundbreaking academic programs, we invite you to start your story at a school that can offer you the world -- whatever you want that world to look like.\n\nNorthern students are deeply involved in real-world scientific and creative research, professional conferences and educational community service from the start. Present at a national conference, travel abroad, or earn a leadership role in a student organization. What will you do at NMU?\n\nNorthern's campus is right in the heart of Marquette, MI and stretches all the way to the sandy shores of Lake Superior. Northern has a distinctive sense of place â€“ some refer to it as the upper hand, but we refer to it as \"home\"."
