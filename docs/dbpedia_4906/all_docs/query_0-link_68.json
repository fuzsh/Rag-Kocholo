Bradford District Primary schools are grouped into 26 planning areas, based on where children live and which schools they are likely to attend. Note however that this does not restrict parents making preferences for any school across the District or elsewhere.\n\nAdditional information on the Schools in the 26 Planning areas are shown below:\n\nFor information on individual school forecasts, please email sufficiency@bradford.gov.uk to make the request.\n\nArea Forecast, Heat map showing pupils on roll in January 2024 and granted housing updated 30/07/2024\n\nClick on the highlighted areas in blue to open links\n\nBingley/Keighley Planning Area\n\nSchools in the planning area - Crossflatts Primary School;
