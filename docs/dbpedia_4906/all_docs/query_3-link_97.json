        "text": "Outs Above Average Leaderboard\n\nCurrent: Outs Above Average\n\n▾\n\nOuts Above Average (OAA) is the cumulative effect of all individual plays a fielder has been credited or debited with, making it a range-based metric of fielding skill that accounts for the number of plays made and the difficulty of them. For example, a fielder who catches a 25% Out Probability play gets +.75; one who fails to make the play gets -.25.\n\nRead more about how Outs Above Average (OAA) works here.\n\nRuns Prevented is the position-based translation from outs saved to runs saved.
