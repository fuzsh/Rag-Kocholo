Peter & Paul School and West Catholic High School. She made many lifelong friendships with her WC Class of 1969 classmates. Rita earned degrees from Western Michigan University and Michigan State University. After working in the Federal Building downtown for a few years, Rita began her career in education. Miss T taught typing and business courses at West Catholic from 1979 to 2011. In addition to teaching, Miss T coached the cheerleading squad, kept the scorebook for the boys and girls basketball teams, and volunteered in numerous capacities at all school events. When a permanent ticket booth was constructed at the West Catholic Falcon Stadium, the building was named the “Miss T House” in honor of her countless hours of service. In 2022, Rita was presented with the “Alumni Excellence Award” at the annual Falcon Awards Night. Rita was proud of her family and kept in close touch with her cousins and their children and grandchildren. She sent cards and presents for all occasions. She had an equally strong connection to her West Catholic “family.” From her time as a student through her teaching career, she developed close bonds with the members of the West Catholic community. She remembered what year the students graduated, who they married, and the names of their children. She was the “Basketball Mom,” with special gifts and treats for hundreds of players over the years. She traveled throughout the state to cheer on “her boys” on the football field. She had a love for her cats, Notre Dame, West Catholic basketball and football, lunches with her friends, and after-game pizza on Friday nights.\n\nRita was preceded in death by her parents, her infant sister Arlene, and her Auntie Frances. She is survived by her “cousins by the dozens” and their families, her many friends, neighbors, co-workers, and West Catholic family.

He leaves behind his wife of almost 76 years Dolores (Centilli), sons Tim (Barb) Czarnopis, Robert (Barb Haynes) Czarnopis, and Chris (Jennefer) Czarnopis. Six grandchildren; Toby (Scarlett) Czarnopis, Tina (Andy) Szleser, Tanya (Jon) Coretti, Trisha (Jon) Knox, Kristin (Alex) Pummill, Rob (Stacey) Czarnopis and 21 Great-Grandchildren whom he always snuck pieces of candy to. Bob worked for 35 years at Rapistan. He loved this country and was a proud Veteran of World War II, PFC 28th Medical Depot. His stories of the war were loved by all who were lucky to hear them. His sweet tooth started during the war when he received government-issued cigarettes; not being a smoker, he was quick to trade them for candy. Bob gave 100% in all his hobbies: fishing for bluegill and trout, tinkering in his shop, making the best popcorn, keeping a meticulous lawn, and gorgeous flower gardens, and decorating the house beautifully for Christmas…everyone is wondering who will help repair their damaged bulbs now. He looked forward to Father’s Day each year to host the annual family croquet game, although it always turned to laughter and disagreements because every Czarnopis has their own set of rules. He loved it. A faithful Catholic, who upon checking into a hotel for vacation always asked where the nearest church was so they could attend. Instilling a strong faith in his family is one of his greatest legacies. Notre Dame football season won’t be the same, but he was sure to wear the 2024 Shirt during his last few days. His family would like to thank Dr. Knol, Matt P.A., Rachel R.N., and those at Emmanuel Hospice, especially his nurse Jamie, and social worker Britt.

Her love of ice cream was born as her dad spoiled her rotten in her early years as her family worried about her health. Many nights, her sisters would beg her to ask for ice cream because they knew that pa could not say no to Julie. In 1961, she was one of the youngest patients to receive an open-heart operation, at that time a groundbreaking and risky procedure that saved her life.\n\nIn grade school, she met her best friend, Karen O’Brien (Gable) who she loved and enjoyed so many countless vacations, parties, outings over the years and right up until this last Super Bowl.\n\nOn June 9, 1957, Julie met the love of her life and soulmate, Tom Eastman, when they were sophomores in high school – true high school sweethearts. They married on August 12,1972 and had fifty-two wonderful married years together. Tom was her constant companion and faithful caregiver these last several years and is a true testament to their wedding vows. Tom was also the person that introduced Julie to the Catholic faith, which she converted to prior to their wedding, and her faith grew and guided her all her life.\n\nJulie was a dental hygienist for over 43 years at the dental practices of Dr. Smiley, Dr. Wolfe, Drs. Kanouse & Kroph, and Dr. Cilia. Often over dinners at home, she would talk about her patients and co-workers as if they were family.\n\nJulie was also a special mom to Kyle and Katey, who supported and cheered her girls on in everything they did. She loved taking the girls shopping, to movies, and out to lunch and just spending time whenever possible. She was always there to listen and provide advice. She was so excited when their family of four expanded to include her wonderful sons-in-law, Tom and Tim.\n\nShe would often say what a joy it was to be a grandma or nana to the four loves of her life, her beautiful grandchildren- Grace, Avery, Reed, and Macie. Her love and dedication to them never wavered, shown as she attended every sports game and other activities. Julie realized her true calling in life the second she met her first grandchild: to spoil them as much as she could. From thoughtful gifts to quality time, she never failed to put a smile on their faces.\n\nJulie deeply loved her extended family which included all of her friends. She lived such a full life doing the things she loved which included traveling, golfing, time at the cottage, winters in Fort Myers Beach, tailgating at GVSU football games, card game parties, and dinners out with friends. Julie embraced life and fun.\n\nJulie described her journey with PSP (Progressive Supranuclear Palsy) as her cross to bear and she fought hard to never let it define or limit her despite the fact that so little is known about the disease and the many physical difficulties it presented. She continued to live her life as she did before, and Tom made sure of it.\n\nThe family would like to thank the medical and care professionals that supported Julie in her PSP journey, especially Lea, Kerry and Tina. As well as Jen who was an angel for my mom and dad in this last year.\n\nJulie Eastman, age 72, died peacefully at home on the morning of Thursday, February 15, 2024, and was welcomed with loving arms by her God.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her parents, Anthony and Adeline (Jo) Kolehouse, her half-sister, Barb (Bernie) Judd, her father- and mother-in-law, Carl and Frances Eastman, her beloved nephew, Wesley Wolosecky Jr., and her infant granddaughter,\n\nStella Lyn Wilson.\n\nShe will be forever missed by her family including her husband, Tom; her daughters: Kyle (Tom) Wilson and Katey (Tim) Dommenick, her grandchildren: Grace Wilson, Avery Wilson, Reed Dommenick and Macie Dommenick, her three sisters: Gene Barr, Mary (Stan) Brzozowski, and Tammie (Wes) Wolosecky; and many beloved nieces and nephews.\n\nA Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated Wednesday February 21, 2024, at 11:00 am at St. Anthony of Padua Church.\n\nInterment Rosedale Memorial Park.

She met Ron Hajek and they were married on July 6, 1957.\n\nMarlene was a homemaker for many years. The family lived for the majority of their time in Arlington Heights, IL, although they moved around the country during the 1960s. In 1972, Marlene began her career at the Mount Prospect Fire Department where she was employed as the Fire Chief’s administrative assistant. During that time, she was one of the founding members of the Illinois Fire Chief Secretaries Association (IFCSA). This group made an impact by helping to standardize and coordinate procedures for fire departments in the area.\n\nAfter retirement from the fire department, Ron and Marlene were “snowbirds” for many years in the Bradenton, Florida area. They retired to Grand Rapids in 2004. Both were active at St Anthony of Padua Church. Marlene was a charter member of the sewing group which made hats for newborns, quilts and baptismal gowns.

Whether enjoying a home-cooked meal or lounging on “the world’s comfiest” couch, visitors could always count on being doted upon by Rita. This includes her six grandchildren: Lydia, 19, Ava, 15, Fiona, 13, Jorgia, 9, Jaxon, 9, and Brody, 7, and many nieces and nephews who ignited her spirit daily.\n\nFew things made the courageous Rita happier than watching the sun set over Baptist Lake, the site of her family cottage.

She was a constant source of strength, even in the most difficult of times, and she always had an encouraging word to say. Nothing brought Dolores greater joy than spending time with her loved ones, even in the simplest of times. Her faith formed the unshakeable foundation of her life, and she faced every challenge head-on with a spirit of firm determination. Forever loved, Dolores will be dearly missed by those who knew her best.\n\nThe 1930s in the United States is remembered as a decade of struggle for many. The Great Depression had a chokehold on the nation, and families demonstrated their strength and resilience as they worked to make ends meet. It was during this trying time that John and Matilda Burns of Grand Rapids, Michigan, were awaiting the birth of their sixth child. On July 8, 1934, their wait was over, and they welcomed their daughter, Dolores Ann, into the Burns family.\n\nGrowing up, Dolores was a typical young girl of her generation. She was raised in the family home on the West side of Grand Rapids alongside her six siblings, Donna, Robert, Mildred, Art, Marylou, and Barbara. The Burns family was close-knit, and the siblings were good friends to each other. From a young age, Dolores was known to be a tomboy. She loved playing sports with her friends and neighbors at Lincoln Park, and she could hit a ball into any corner of the field.\n\nThroughout her childhood, Dolores attended local schools. She went to grade school at St. James Catholic Church school, then moved on to Mount Mercy, an all-girls school, during her high school years. Dolores enjoyed socializing; she had many girlfriends and loved hanging around with them in her free time. In high school, Dolores worked at Matthew’s Drug Store, manning the soda fountain.\n\nFollowing high school, Dolores would soon meet the love of her life. She often attended events hosted for catholic singles, where she met John Parbel. There was an instant spark between Dolores and John. Her brother, Art, attended school with John, and he assured Dolores that he was a good guy. Dolores and John enjoyed going on dates every weekend. She loved going to hear him play the trumpet. It didn’t take the two long to realize that they were made for each other. With a desire to spend the rest of their lives together, Dolores and John were married on January 12, 1957, at St. James Catholic Church, then enjoyed their honeymoon in Chicago.\n\nAll who knew Dolores can surely agree that, of all the things she loved in life, she treasured her family above all else. Over the years, she and John were overjoyed to welcome their six children, Deborah, Ruth, Ginny, June, Mary Kay, and Eric, into their home. A seventh child, Elizabeth Rose, passed away at birth, but she lived on in their hearts. Dolores was devoted to the role of both a mother and a homemaker. She took pride in the upkeep of her home and enjoyed preparing home-cooked meals for her family. She valued her children and did her best to raise them into kind and hardworking individuals. Later in life, Dolores was thrilled to become a grandmother and even a great-grandmother. She was happy to watch her extended family grow to include many nieces and nephews.\n\nWhen it came to providing for herself and her loved ones, Dolores was never afraid to work hard. After getting married to John, she began working at the bank; however, once she and John started a family, she dedicated herself to raising her children. While caring for her family, Dolores was also a bookkeeper for Parbel’s Garage and Service, the family’s small business. Later, she re-entered the workforce, driving school buses. Dolores truly enjoyed her career, and it gave her the opportunity to touch the lives of countless others. She spent time serving her community by volunteering at her church as well.\n\nIn 1964, the Parbel family moved to a house they built on Blueberry Drive, and Dolores loved entertaining the neighborhood with summertime pool parties. After she lost John in 1998, she settled into her dream home and tended to her large flower garden. Dolores was a faithful member of St. Anthony Church for many years. She enjoyed listening to music, and her passion for family history led her to research and compile a record of her German and Irish ancestry for the next generations to look back on.\n\nWhen reflecting on the life of Dolores Parbel, it is easy to see both her unwavering strength and unconditional love for her family. She poured her heart and soul into all that she did. A caring wife, mother, and grandmother, Dolores was beloved by many and a friend to those around her. She devoted herself to serving her community, and she was always willing to go above and beyond to help others. Though she will be deeply missed, Dolores leaves behind a priceless legacy that her loved ones will be proud to carry in her footsteps.\n\nDolores Ann (Burns) Parbel went to be with her Lord and Savior on November 22, 2023, after a long battle with dementia. She was preceded in death by her parents, John and Matilda Burns; her husband, John Parbel; infant daughter, Elizabeth Rose Parbel; as well as her siblings, Donna (Bill) DeFouw, Robert (Chareen) Burns, Mildred (Dick) Prince and Art Burns; and in-laws, Robert Blackwell, Louise and Elmo Slater, Irene and John Dyar, Josephine and Eugene Kozak, Peter and Lorraine Parbel and Rosemary Kilmartin. Dolores is survived by her children, Deborah Cabrera, Ruth Parbel, Ginny (Tom) Fitzsimmons, June Anderson, Mary Kay (Salomon) Mancio, and Eric Parbel. Dolores was blessed to be a grandmother to Camille, Sofia, Steve, Patrick, Amanda, Andres, Alicia (Conner), Nick, and Alex, as well as her great-granddaughter, Gabriela. Dolores is also survived by her sister, Mary Lou Blackwell, Barbara Burns, sister-in-law Charlene Burns and brother-in-law Edmund Kilmartin; and many nieces and nephews.
