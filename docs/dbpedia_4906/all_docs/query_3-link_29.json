We are out of ideas and are looking for some new names to consider.\n\nWe like more traditional names (Benjamin, William, etc.). I also like names like Hudson and Elliott. My husband doesn't like names like Hayden, Bradyn, Aiden, Liam, etc.\n\nSo if you were using Bryan as a middle name for your son, what would you use as the first name? I am open to all ideas!"
