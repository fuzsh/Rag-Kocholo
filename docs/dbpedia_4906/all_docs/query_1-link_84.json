        "text": "The education and care of children is of great importance for every Australian. As Catholics we know that this includes a full human and Christian formation.\n\nToday’s children need to be given what they need to navigate the complexities and difficulties of contemporary life. Specifically, a spiritual life, or at least the openness to God is necessary. Our Catholic faith provides our children with something of what they will need to live fulfilled and happy lives.\n\nMany catholic children attend state schools, and it is our responsibility to give them the opportunity to know and love Jesus Christ. Members of the CCD give time and energy to teaching catechism to our Catholic children in the state schools. I commend their work and thank them for their generosity.\n\nBishop Greg Homeming OCD\n\nSpecial Religious Education\n\nHistory\n\nSpecial Religious Education (SRE) for Catholic students in Public Schools, is managed by the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine (CCD). CCD is a worldwide organisation concerned with faith education. It began with the work of lay people in Milan, Italy in 1556.\n\nIn 1960 when the “Motor Missions” were set up in the Lismore Diocese, Catechists were able to receive support, help and formation in the parishes where the sisters operated.\n\nIn 1993 a CCD Director for the Diocese of Lismore was appointed by Bishop John Satterthwaite. The role of the Director is to support all the Catechists in the Diocese in meeting the requirements of the Department of Education with regard to Authorisation, Training and Curriculum.\n\nMission\n\nCatechists are men and women who are committed to the Faith Development and Religious Education of Catholic children in government schools and volunteer for this ministry. They strive to ensure the inclusion of the children and their families in the local parish community.\n\n“Fan into a flame the gift that God gave you”\n\nSpecial Religious Education in Public Schools\n\nWhere possible, Catholic SRE is taught in Public Schools by Catechists, otherwise known as SRE Teachers.\n\nSRE is provided in Public Schools under Section 32 of the Education Act 1990 which requires that: ‘in every government school, time is to be allowed for the religious education of children of any religious persuasion’.\n\nThis means there is a historical and legal basis for the provision of Special Religious Education as part of the education of children and young people in New South Wales Public Schools. The following document provides additional information about how SRE is implemented:\n\nSpecial Religious Education Procedures\n\nWhat is a Catechist\n\nCatechists are parish volunteers who…\n\nHave a passion for sharing the gift of faith with young people.\n\nTeach and share their faith with children of their parish who attend government schools.\n\nHave a couple of hours per week spare to share their time and talents with young people.\n\nAre people who respond to the central mission of the Church to make Jesus known and loved.\n\nThe fundamental vocation and mission of the parish is:\n\n“to be a place in the world for the community of believers to gather together as a sign and instrument of the vocation of all to communion, in a word, to be a house of welcome and a place of service to all.” Pope Saint John Paul II\n\nFor those who cannot or do not attend Catholic Schools, SRE provides a religious dimension in state schooling which contributes to a Catholic education. The parish has a responsibility to assist parents to provide a Catholic education for their children according to circumstances.\n\nCatechists, (Catholic SRE teachers) offer the genuinely human values of the Gospel as a contribution to the personal development of students.\n\nCatechists assist the Parish Priest to fulfil his obligations in Religious Education as well as assist and support parents in their responsibility.\n\n“Modern man listens more willingly to witnesses than to teachers,and if he does listens to teachers, it is because they are witnesses.”\n\nPope Saint Paul VI\n\nCatholic SRE is managed in NSW Public Schools by the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine.\n\n“Christ our light and life” COLAL\n\nChrist our Light and Life (COLAL) is designed and approved for use as the main resource of Special Religious Education (SRE) for Catholic children attending public schools in the Lismore Diocese.\n\nThis program meets the legislative requirements of the NSW Department of Education and Training and has been specifically written for volunteer Catholic SRE teachers.\n\n“Christ Our Light and Life” explores the significance of human life experiences then relates those to the gospel message. Through a variety of strategies, students respond to what they have learned.\n\nThe programs are designed to be most appropriate for the age of the students they have been prepared for. However, it may be possible, where necessary, to use the programs with students one year younger or one year older than recommended.\n\nCatechists teaching multi-age classes should discuss their students’ needs with the CCD Co-ordinator.\n\nClick here to look at the COLAL Overview, Scope and Sequence and Lesson Topics. https://ccd.sydneycatholic.org/publications/curriculum-resources/\n\nReview and Revision\n\nThe Christ our Light and Life curriculum series is purposely reprinted each year so that updates and revisions may be made. A process of cyclic review is in place that is undertaken every five years by the Archdiocese of Sydney who supplies us with our curriculum material.\n\nVersion Control\n\nWhilst new books are printed for each new school year, the Diocesan Coordinator will be informed of revisions to advise their local-level Parish SRE Catechist Co-ordinators, so that students have the same version of the Student Activity Book or their SRE teacher is aware to make any minor changes if using up books ordered from a previous year.\n\nSupplementary Resources\n\nCatechists may from time to time bring additional resources to classes such a Holy Pictures, Religious Devotional items such as a statue or rosary beads, short stories and the like to build upon or enhance on the curriculum provided, especially in seasons such as Lent, Easter, Advent, Christmas, a Solemnity, or Feast Days of the Church.\n\nChrist our Light and Life is informed by the following practical principles:\n\nFormation in faith is a life-long journey. Life itself is the context of any religious education program;\n\nThe needs of students change over time. Therefore, a variety of teaching methods are required over time;\n\nThe students’ lives influence their expressions of faith. Thus catechists’ teaching strategies will respond to and respect the cultural diversity of students and their families;\n\nThe family is the basic community of the Church. Links between the home, parish and school are discovered and encouraged.\n\nAuthorisation Process\n\nThe Authorisation Process and Code of Conduct clarifies the standards of behaviour that is expected of all employees, volunteers, religious and lay people working on behalf of the Diocese of Lismore CCD. SRE teachers are to endorse the principles of the current Child Protection Law and follow the Department of Education Religious Education Implementation Procedures as an essential responsibility.\n\nAs part of the Authorisation Process, the following steps are required:\n\nComplete a Teacher Application Form\n\nObtain a Working With Children Check Clearance WWCC\n\nComplete an Annual Teacher Engagement Form\n\nComplete Child Protection and Mandatory Reporter Training\n\nParticipate in Mandatory Training which includes Classroom Management\n\nAdhere to the Code of Conduct\n\nAdded to Authorisation Form for school notification.\n\nSupplied with an Authorisation Card\n\nSupplied with a Parish issued Name Badge\n\nTeacher Application Form (TAF)\n\nA Teacher Application Form is to be completed and submitted to your Parish Priest with photo identification (drivers license). If accepted, an Annual Teacher Engagement Form must be completed. Copies of these Forms will be kept at the Parish Office and Chancery.\n\nThe following records are kept for each SRE teacher at the Diocese of Lismore Chancery Office:\n\nFull name\n\nContact details\n\nDate of Birth\n\nWWCC number\n\nVerification date\n\nVerification outcome\n\nExpiry date\n\nRecord of Training\n\nWorking With Children Check Clearance (WWCC)\n\nIn accordance with the Child Protection (Working with Children) Act 2012, all SRE teachers are required to apply for a WWCC and obtain a clearance number. The number and your date of birth must be provided for verification by the Diocese of Lismore Coordinator of CCD. The WWCC involves a national criminal history check and a review of findings of workplace misconduct.\n\nChild Protection and Mandatory Reporter Training\n\nSRE teachers are Mandatory Reporters and as such are required to report risk of harm concerns about children and young people, within their roles, and to provide support to children and young people.\n\nIt is a responsibility to ensure that all SRE teachers:\n\nHave participated in an initial Child Protection induction and an update during the past year\n\nAre aware of the indicators of abuse and neglect of children and young people\n\nAre aware of their obligation to advise the principal or workplace manager of concerns about the safety, welfare and wellbeing of children and young people that arise during the course of their work\n\nAre aware of their obligation to report suspected risk of significant harm and of the procedures for doing so.\n\nThe Catholic Conference of Religious Educators in State Schools (CCRESS) has developed training modules which includes Child Protection Training.

Results of the Audit are made available to the Bishop each year.\n\nCode of Conduct\n\nAll Catechists entering Public Schools as SRE teachers are representing their Parish, their Diocese, their Bishop and their Church. They are therefore expected to adhere to the Diocese of Lismore CCD Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct gives guidance in areas where staff and volunteers need to make personal and ethical decisions.\n\nThe Diocese of Lismore Code of Conduct is aligned with the Department of Education’s Code of Conduct, and SRE teachers are expected to be aware of and follow both.\n\nPlease click on the links below to view or download these Codes.\n\nDiocese of Lismore Authorisation Process & Code of Conduct\n\nDepartment of Education Code of Conduct\n\nAuthorisation Document\n\nAt the beginning of each school year, before the SRE classes have begun, the Authorisation Document will be sent to the school listing the names of the teachers, their contact details and date of birth.\n\n“The following Catholic SRE Teachers (Catechists) have been authorised to teach SRE in your school having met relevant Child Protection and Departmental requirements.
