        "text": "In The Watsons go to Birmingham, By Christopher Paul Curtis, a boy named Kenny gets to go to Birmingham, Alabama, during one of the darkest moments in America’s history. Before him and his family left to Birmingham he has to deal with other problems like dealing with the cold time in Flint, Michigan, his brother being mean and beating him up, he has to deal with people being mean to him for being black or not bringing enough food for the other people in his grade that he hangs out with. But Kenny has one friend that stays with him after some rough times and his name is Rufus.\n\nKenny is smart with school, he is smart with people, and he has insight into his parent’s relationship. Kenny is so smart in school, the other kids called him “Poindexter”. Henry tells his tale of being a more advanced reader in, “Teachers started treating me differently than other kids when I was in the first grade. At first I thought it was cool for them to think I was smart, but then I found out it made me enemies with the other kids. Back when I was in the second grade, Miss Henry used to take me to a different classroom to read stuff out of the Bible or the newspaper in front of the other kids.” (Curtis 22). Kenny also is “people smart”. He's perceptive, which means he's good at figuring out how other people are feeling by just watching them closely. For example, Kenny knows his mother repeats herself when she's mad, and he can always tell when Byron is about to get into trouble or pull a prank. He could tell that something is up when Byron is alone. “I was up in the bedroom looking at comic books when I heard Byron go into the bathroom and lock the door. I knew that something was up , since he only locked the door when he had something to hide.” (Curtis 65). Kenny knew something was happening ( Nazi Parachutes Attack America and\n\nIn order to understand the characters, or character from the movie, The Watsons Go to Birmingham, you have to first understand what the movie is about. This movie is about an African American family during the summer of 1963. This family consists of the father (Daniel), mother (Wilona), their two sons Kenny and Byron and their daughter Joetta. The Watson family lives in Flint, Michigan, but decided to take a summer trip down to Birmingham to visit Wilonas’ mother. The planned trip was to get Byron, their juvenile delinquent son, to realize that he needs to get his act together. But as the weeks pass by in Birmingham, they realize how much they love Michigan and would rather be back at home. The character I would like to dissect, is their fifteen year old son Byron. To me, Byron was the only character that went through a major change over the summer of 1963. Byron showed characteristics and actions of how the Europeans used to treat African Americans, but as the movie progresses Byron starts to change and embrace his family and race more. In the beginning Byron was rebellious, unconsciously wanted to be white, and had a nonchalant attitude but then he changes and becomes comforting to his little brother Kenny.\n\nThere are kids all over the world, and most of them slowly matures. Throughout the novella “Shattered” written by Eric Walters, the Protagonist Ian changes from a childish boy who only cares about himself into a mature and wise young man in a very short period of time. Throughout Ian’s journey of growing up, a few thing helped him on the way. In the beginning, Ian the main character has a terrible point of view of the world but by the end, he has changed his way of life. There are a few things that made him change his mind about the world.\n\nThis is the time where the Watson’s view on family really changes. A bombing at a church happened while they were down there, everyone was very worried and it brought them all close together. Kenny was frightened to be at the church, but there wasn’t a second thought going through Byron’s mind when he heard what was going on, he needed to get to Joetta. Joetta and Byron are a lot closer, and kinder to each other. Earlier in the book, Byron had been messing around with matches so Mama was going to burn his fingers. Joetta then cried and yelled “ Please Mommy he won’t… you won’t do it again.”(68) Joetta always stood up for Byron whenever it came to him\n\nPeople change and grow through their experiences and conflicts. For example, just 2 years ago I was a sixth grader. There was a lot more homework than I ever had in my non-accelerated / magnet elementary school. I had to work harder and for longer hours, but as a result, I was much more mature and knowledgeable. I improved my work habits and increased my concentration. In Judith Ortiz Cofer’s “First Love”, a 14 year old girl is in love with a high school senior. She does everything she can to try to see him more often. At the end, she thinks she learns the true meaning of love. In Richard Wright’s “The Street”, a boy has to go shopping for food, but he is constantly stopped by a gang who beats him up. At the end, he beats up the gang with a stick his mother gave him because he had to to return home. In both “The Street” by Richard Wright and “First Love” by Judith Ortiz Cofer, the characters start out as shy and naive, but end up as aware and wiser as a result of their respective conflicts.\n\nIn addition to his loving home life, Joe also experiences the dark side of toxic and abusive families. Family is the group of people closest to the individual. This can be beneficial if the family members harmonize, but it can also foster abuse if the family members do not respect each other. One example of this is how Linda’s mother acts when Linda is born. Mrs. Lark saves Linden, Linda’s twin brother, but the doctor “ask[s] if he should use extraordinary means to salvage it [Linda], the answer was no. No, let it die” (115). Linda’s mother disregards Linda’s rights as a human and her place as a daughter in the family. This scars Linda for life and ruins any chance of Linda and mother building a healthy relationship in the future. When Linda tells him her story, Joe realizes that he\n\nChange can be seen as a form of transformation or conversion. A form of change can be seen in “Victory Lap” by George Saunders, a short story written in such a way that the events that are enrolling throughout the story are being processed and told through the minds of three main characters. Having the perspective of each character allows us, the readers to get a much greater understanding about them and to make a better character analysis. Having said that, this story is simply about a girl, Alison getting kidnapped by an unnamed kidnapper. What were really captivating were the changes spotted on characters as the conflict progresses. One character in particular is very intriguing and his name is Kyle. One of our main character, Alison\n\nJohann Wolfgang said “The way you see someone is the way you treat them.” As a person progresses throughout the stages of life, their views will change; which can result in them acting differently towards the people that surround them. Furthermore, they will grow apart and distance themselves from the people that care the most about them, in a hidden attempt to gain independence and to better their life. This concept is presented throughout the novel “Great Expectations,” as Charles Dickens uses Pip’s relationships with Joe, Biddy, and Magwitch to show how a person can change their treatment towards others because of their perspectives and the goals they set for themselves."
