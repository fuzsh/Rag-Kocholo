        "text": "CHILDREN may have just returned to school after the summer holidays, but for primary pupils in year six, it is already time to start thinking about their next big step in education.\n\nWith that in mind, the Trust will hold a series of open evenings this month, for year six pupils and their families to explore the opportunities to be part of its secondary schools.\n\nSt Aidan’s Catholic Academy in Sunderland celebrated its best ever day of GCSE results this year – despite the impact of lockdown, which saw pupils learning from home during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nA total of 84% of its pupils gained a grade four or higher in English and Maths.\n\nSt Joseph’s Catholic Academy, in Hebburn, also saw 83% of pupils achieve five GCSEs or more graded nine to four, with 32% of all grades being seven or higher.\n\nSt Wilfrid’s RC College in South Shields, which is rated ‘Outstanding’ by Ofsted, also saw 24% of all its GCSE results being grade 7 or higher.\n\nSt Anthony’s Girls Catholic Academy, which is also rated as ‘Outstanding’ by Ofsted, also saw the success of students like Eve, who found she had achieved a staggering 10 grade 9s and an 8 when she opened her GCSE results. Like so many others at St Anthony’s, where 63% of the girls achieved grade 5 or above in both English and maths and 80% got grade 4 or higher, Eve will be staying on as a sixth form student.\n\nAt St Bede’s Catholic School and Byron Sixth Form College, Ben achieved five grade 9s and five grade 8s, amongst the many successes that Headteacher Frances Cessford said represented “students’ resilience and hard work”.\n\nBrendan Tapping, Trust CEO, said: “We are extremely proud of all of our GCSE students this year, which is a testament to the talented staff who instil the value and rewards of working hard within all our pupils.\n\n“We are looking forward to welcoming those students who are embarking on their last year of primary school into our secondary schools this month and demonstrating the high quality of secondary education we provide at Bishop Chadwick Catholic Education Trust.\n\n“Staff will be on hand to talk to parents and pupils about their expectations of secondary school, the curriculum we offer and the fact, of which we are very proud, that many of our secondary school pupils go on to continue their sixth form education with us.”\n\nMr Tapping added the “supportive and nurturing environment” the Trust’s schools offer plays a big part in helping its pupils achieve success and develop their talents to be the best version of themselves.\n\n“Each pupil has the opportunity to develop their particular skills and talents with the support of staff who nurture these and encourage pupils to excel.” Brendan said.\n\nOpen Evening dates and times are as follows:\n\nSt Aidan’s Catholic Academy, Sunderland – 5.00 – 7.00 pm Tuesday 20 September 2022 Visit www.staidanscatholicacademy.co.uk\n\nSt Anthony’s Girls Catholic Academy, Sunderland – 6.00 -8.00 pm Tuesday 27 September 2022.
