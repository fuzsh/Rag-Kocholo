        "text": "Helen Sohlinger, 82, of Beaumont, died Friday, June 7, 2024, at Christus Southeast Texas-St. Elizabeth, Beaumont. She was born on October 4, 1941, to Aline Mary Dekerlegand Gallier and Joseph Louis Gallier, in Beaumont.\n\nHelen was an amazing woman. Even when her children, Patrick and Christine, were very small, she was very involved with the Woman’s Club of Beaumont, and later with the Press Club of Southeast Texas and the Thyme for Herbs Society. She loved to cook and was a foodie before that was a thing. She loved trying out gourmet recipes and her collection of cookbooks numbered in the hundreds. Her kids loved her simpler foods, like her bread pudding and her onion gravy. She also loved to sew and made many clothes for daughter Christine, and then granddaughter Hannah. She loved flowers and plants and loved that James maintained her rose garden for her. She loved jewelry, collecting vintage pieces and beading many of her own necklaces. She was a voracious reader, and it was not unusual for her to be up half the night reading. It was without a doubt, her favorite pastime.\n\nHelen attended and graduated from St. Anthony’s high school in 1959. She attended Sacred Heart Dominican College in Houston where she majored in math. She returned to Beaumont and started dating James Sohlinger who she knew as he had previously gone out with her sister Earline. They married on July 4, 1963, at St. Anthony’s Catholic Church, now St. Anthony Cathedral Basilica.\n\nHelen went back to school when her kids were in grade school. She attended Lamar University where she majored in Mass Communication. She was extremely involved with the University Press and was co-editor of Cardinal magazine. After graduation, she worked for the Port Arthur News covering the Jefferson County courthouse “beat”. She quickly became well known, liked, and admired by the judges, attorneys, and courthouse staff. She continued her career at the Beaumont Enterprise where she continued to cover primarily court cases. She was liked and respected by her colleagues. Later she served as Assistant City Editor and then one of the two editors for the paper’s first web edition. She was dedicated to her career and along with husband James, and son Patrick, rode out Hurricane Rita at the Enterprise building. She was determined to provide coverage. Over the course of her long career, she won many journalistic awards.\n\nHelen was an extremely strong woman. Few ever won an argument with her. She was the first woman in Beaumont to have a credit card at the White House store, in her name only. She was a strong supporter of women’s rights and would not tolerate bigotry of any sort. Of note, she considered going to law school. She would have made a formidable attorney.\n\nHelen and James loved to travel. They took Patrick and Christine to Mexico to see the Mayan Ruins and beaches of Cozumel, long before these were large tourist attractions. But they also went on several camping trips with the kids, to Toledo Bend, Garner State Park and even primitive camping on the shore of the Neches River. After the kids were grown, they visited London, Paris, San Francisco, Washington DC, Santa Fe, Colorado, and others. They honeymooned in New Orleans and spent many anniversaries there. They also took many wonderful cruises but she always said her favorite was the one she took with Christine, Byron, Hannah and Will.\n\nWhen Christine met and married Byron, she and James welcomed him with unconditional love. Interestingly, she had met Byron and interviewed him when they were both at Lamar. They graduated together. She always said she was glad there was another media person in the family. She was so happy to have such a wonderful son-in-law.\n\nHelen was a devoted Gram to grandchildren Hannah and Will. They inherited her stubbornness and wicked sense of humor. This same devotion extended to Hannah’s wife Meagan when she joined the family. Unconditional love.\n\nHelen always loved animals and while cats where her favorite and she had many over the years, in later years her constant companion was her miniature poodle Oz. He was devoted to her as she was to him. They died a week apart.\n\nSurvivors include her daughter, Christine Balentine and her husband, Byron; granddaughter, Hannah Balentine and her wife, Meagan; and grandson, Will Balentine, all of Beaumont; sister, Earline Tullier and her husband, Joseph “Cal”, of Nederland; and brother-in-law, Bill Platzer of Windcrest.\n\nShe is preceded in death by her husband, James Patrick Sohlinger; son, Patrick Sohlinger; parents, Joseph and Aline Gallier; sister, Frances Platzer; and brother, Louis “Sonny” Gallier.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made to the Press Club of Southeast Texas, P.O. Box 1922, Beaumont, Texas 77704-1922 donate online or the Beaumont Botanical Gardens, Inc., 6088 Babe Zaharias Drive, Beaumont, Texas 77705 donate online.\n\nA gathering of Mrs. Sohlinger’s family and friends will begin at 10:00 a.m., with her memorial service to follow at 11:00 a.m., Thursday, June 13, 2024, at Broussard’s, 1605 North Major Drive, Beaumont. Her cremation arrangements were handled through Broussard’s Crematorium.\n\nThe family wishes to thank Dr. Stephen Jones, and all the doctors, nurses and staff on 6 Main at Christus St. Elizabeth who cared for her in her final weeks and Gentiva Hospice for their care and compassion. A special thank you to Sissy Teel who helped her maintain her independence and became a good friend."
