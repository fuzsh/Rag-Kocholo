It is located in Northern New South Wales, stretching from the Queensland border to Laurieton, a distance of approximately 460km. The Diocese is home to 104,581 Catholics.\n\nThe services available to our Catholic community are many and varied. To find out more about what each organisation may offer you, please contact them directly, using the contact details supplied by the organisation.\n\nIn 2020, the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference established a Plenary Council (the first since 1937) about the future of the Catholic Church in Australia focusing on the key questions: What are we called to do? Who are we called to be? How do we need to change?"
