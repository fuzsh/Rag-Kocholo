He is known around the world for his unique brand of humor, which largely revolves around his observations on life.\n\nGaffigan is a top ten comedian according to Forbes’ most recent comedy list and top ten earning comedian in Pollstar. He released his 10th comedy special, Dark Pale, last year on Amazon Prime Video, an unprecedented achievement for the comedian/actor. Dark Pale was met with critical fanfare with The New York Times calling it, ‘his best yet.” Last fall, Gaffigan co-headlined with Jerry Seinfeld for a sold-out multi-city arena tour.\n\nIn 2021 Gaffigan released his 9th special, Comedy Monster, on Netflix which was nominated for a Grammy® award. He was also recently awarded for being the first comedian to reach one billion streams on Pandora.\n\nGaffigan can currently be seen as the lead in the well-reviewed Sci-Fi dramedy, Linoleum, which was named one of Vulture.com’s best movies of 2023. He also starred as Mr. Smee in Disney’s Peter Pan and Wendy, opposite Jude Law and Yara Shahidi. He will soon co-star Jerry Seinfeld, Melissa McCarthy, James Marsden, and Hugh Grant in Netflix’s Unfrosted, and co-stars in Susie Searches which premiered at TIFF and in theaters last year. Also premiering recently, Gaffigan joined the cast of HBO Max’s Full Circle, a limited series from Steven Soderbergh and Ed Solomon which follows an investigation into a botched kidnapping, connecting multiple characters and cultures in present day NY.\n\nOn the silver screen, his many credits include Three Kings, Super Troopers 1 & 2, and Chappaquiddick. 2019 was Gaffigan’s biggest year in film to date with an astonishing eight films releasing, three which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival including Troop Zero with Viola Davis and Alison Janney, Them That Follow and Light From Light – with many festival goers and press calling Gaffigan the “King of Sundance.” Gaffigan was also recently heard in Disney/Pixar’s highly anticipated animated film, Luca, opposite Jacob Tremblay and Maya Rudolph.\n\nGaffigan had two films recently in which he debuted as the lead. The comedic film Being Frank, and American Dreamer, a dark thriller which features him as a ride share app worker who moonlights as a private driver for a drug dealer.\n\nGaffigan can also currently be seen opposite Ethan Hawke in IFC Films Tesla, as well as opposite Josh Hartnett in Saban Films’ Most Wanted.\n\nIn addition to two seasons of the critically acclaimed semi-autobiographical The Jim Gaffigan Show, which he wrote and produced with his wife Jeannie, Gaffigan has guest starred on many television comedies and dramas, ranging from Portlandia and Bob’s Burgers to the HBO cult hits Flight of the Concords to dramatic roles in Law & Order.\n\nGaffigan regularly does humorous commentaries on CBS Sunday Morning for which he has won 3 Emmys. In 2018 Jim served as master of ceremony at The Al Smith Memorial dinner. In 2015, Gaffigan had the great honor of performing for Pope Francis and over 1 million festival attendees at the Festival of Families in Philadelphia.\n\nGaffigan and his wife currently live in Manhattan with their five loud and expensive children."
