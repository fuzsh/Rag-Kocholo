        "text": "WINDOWS 101: So when you nod your head in understanding, you actually mean it.\n\nHas an all-rights offer worth taking eluded you and your film? Have you considered constructing a DIY and/or hybrid distribution strategy for your film? If your answer is “yes,” then the first thing I would recommend you do is become familiar with release windows, which folks in our business just refer to as “windows.”\n\nWindows is a term used to describe periods of time a certain type of media is allowed to screen your film. Traditionally, a feature film is first released in theatres, then on DVD and pay-per-view/video-on-demand (VOD) and finally, on broadcast TV. As the landscape of traditional distribution changes, so do the windows. If you keep windowing foremost in mind, this will help insure that you monetize your film to the best of your ability. Following is a basic breakdown of windows, using a pre-theatrical release as an example:\n\nPRE-THEATRICAL WINDOW\n\nPre-Theatrical is a transactional VOD (TVOD) window. It allows a user the ability to select and view a film for a rental fee, based on the provider’s price point for a limited period of time.\n\nTransactional VOD (TVOD) encompasses the following:\n\nCable (e.g. Comcast, Time Warner, Rogers, Cogeco)\n\nSatellite (e.g. DirecTV, Dish Network)\n\nTelco (e.g. AT&T U-Verse, Verizon Fios)\n\nInternet (e.g. Amazon Instant Video, Apple iTunes, Vudu)\n\nLength of window: approximately 30 days\n\nAverage VOD price point: $9.99 (HD & SD)\n\nAverage length of rental period: 48 hours\n\nNote: A pre-theatrical window is primarily reserved for a cast-driven narrative feature. This window is the ideal time to get your film up with hotels and/or airlines, which again is reserved primarily for cast-driven content, this time due to limited space and studio competition.\n\nREAD MORE: You Got into Sundance…Now What? Distribution Tips for Indie Filmmakers\n\nDAY & DATE THEATRICAL/VOD WINDOW\n\nA day & date theatrical/VOD release is when a film is screening in theaters and is also available via a transactional VOD (TVOD) provider at the same time.\n\nTransactional VOD (TVOD) provider examples are listed above, however the length of the window as well as the price point is different.\n\nLength of window: approximately 60 days\n\nAverage theatrical price point: $10.90\n\nAverage transactional VOD (TVOD) price point: $6.99 (HD & SD)\n\nAverage length of rental period: 24-48 hours\n\nSTANDARD VOD/DVD WINDOW\n\nIt has become industry standard to release a film simultaneously on DVD and within the standard transactional VOD (TVOD) space in order to maximize marketing efforts. So, if you’re working with two separate companies— one that is handling your VOD rights and another that is releasing your DVD— do your best to coordinate dates.\n\nLength of standard cable VOD window: anywhere from 60 days – 1 year\n\nLength of standard transactional internet VOD (IVOD) window: length of the deal term\n\nAverage DVD/Electronic Sell-Thru (EST) price: $12.99 (HD) / $9.99 (SD)\n\nAverage standard VOD price point: $4.99 (HD) / $3.99 (SD)\n\nAverage length of rental period: 24-48 hours\n\nNote: Keep in mind that you want to provide the standard transactional VOD (TVOD) providers with at least 60 days before your film becomes available on a Subscription (SVOD) window. It should also be noted that it is industry standard to release a DVD on a Tuesday.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION VOD/1st PAY TV WINDOW\n\nSubscription VOD (SVOD) is a service that allows its subscribers the opportunity to view what is available within the provider’s library. The subscriber pays a monthly fee for access.\n\nSubscription VOD (SVOD) providers include: Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu Plus and a number of others with the most notable addition in 2015 being HBO (FYI, reports state that this will happen in April, I’m guessing just in time for “Game of Thrones” season 5!)\n\nThe Subscription VOD (SVOD) service provider will offer a license fee to the underlying producer and/or licensor of the film, in order to make it available to their subscribers. This is how the film earns money within the subscription VOD window as there is no transaction to the viewer.\n\nPay TV channels e.g.: HBO, Showtime, Starz all fall within this window too & like Subscription VOD (SVOD) service providers will offer a license fee to the underlying producer and/or licensor of the film, in order to make it available to their subscribers.\n\nLength of window: Will vary based on various deal terms\n\nLicense fee paid: Will vary based on numerous factors, including exclusivity, cast, length of the deal, etc.\n\nNote: Keep in mind that exclusivity within this window should equate to more money for the license fee and if the offer requires exclusivity, then be sure you have someone determining if the deal is a good one by comparing to other offers, a combination of non-exclusive deals, etc.\n\nREAD MORE: Here Are All the VOD Numbers We Have So Far\n\n2nd PAY TV WINDOW\n\nA Pay TV channel e.g.: HBO, Showtimes, Starz, etc that did not run the film within the 1st Pay TV window may be interested in licensing the film for the 2nd Pay TV window. Or, the same channel could be interested in renewing their license, possibly at a lesser license fee, for the 2nd Pay TV window.\n\nLength of window: Will vary based on various deal terms\n\nLicense fee paid: Will vary based on numerous factors, including exclusivity, cast, length of the deal, etc.\n\nAD-SUPPORTED VOD WINDOW\n\nAd-supported VOD (AVOD) allows the viewer to watch your film at no charge, but ad breaks are interspersed throughout the film.\n\nHulu would be the prime example for ad-supported VOD (AVOD).\n\nMonies made within the ad-supported VOD (AVOD) space are determined by the AVOD service’s ability to sell advertising during a given period of time. For instance, if an AVOD service knows that customer viewership is high over a particular holiday weekend, they will be able to sell advertising space at a premium. Consequently, filmmakers who take advantage of select AVOD platforms reap a percentage of the advertising revenues, based on the number of views for their particular title and the ability of the AVOD ad sales team to command a high price for the views recorded for that content.\n\nThe model is quickly evolving and advertising dollars are following cord-cutting or cord-shaving customers as they flock to less expensive ways to consume the same content they used to find on cable. That said, the AVOD model is rapidly becoming a wonderful source of ancillary revenue.\n\nLength of window: length of the deal term\n\nBROADCAST TV WINDOW\n\nOnce you’ve navigated all of the above for your film, you will want to continue to pursue additional opportunities for your film within the broadcast TV window.\n\nLike Subscription VOD (SVOD) service providers & Pay TV channels, Broadcast TV channels will offer a license fee to the underlying producer and/or licensor of the film, in order to make the film available.\n\nLength of window: Will vary based on various deal terms\n\nLicense fee paid: Will vary based on numerous factors, including performance within other windows, audience awareness of the film, cast, length of the deal, etc.\n\nDON’T FORGET NON-THEATRICAL & EDUCATIONAL\n\nThere is a strong and viable revenue stream within the non-theatrical and educational market place for certain films – don’t discount them!\n\nNon-theatrical & educational screenings and/or DVD sales can fall within a variety of the windows above and can not only serve as a revenue stream but also means by which you as well as your film can build a fan base. I implore you to harness that fan base by collecting email addresses whenever possible so that as the film is released in the various windows above, you not only have a fan base but a social media “army” to spread the word to their contacts about your film.\n\nAs co-founder and producer of Fishbowl Films, Melanie Miller has over two decades of experience in the film industry as an acquisitions & marketing executive, casting associate, festival programmer, music supervisor & producer.
