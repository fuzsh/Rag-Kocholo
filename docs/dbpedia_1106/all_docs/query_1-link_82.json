Sony recently released \"Ghostbusters: Afterlife\" in 2021. Max debuted an animated \"Gremlins\" prequel, \"Secrets of the Mogwai,\" in May.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Spaceballs\" and \"Full Metal Jacket\" — June 26, 1987\n\n\"Spaceballs\" worldwide box office: $38,119,483\n\n\"Full Metal Jacket\" worldwide box office: $46,358,827\n\nIn the face-off between what would become two classics from filmmaking greats — Mel Brooks' \"Star Wars\" satire \"Spaceballs\" and Stanley Kubrick's Vietnam drama \"Full Metal Jacket\" — it was Brooks who got the win on opening weekend with a $6.6 million opening.\n\n\"Full Metal Jacket\" took in $2.2 million, but it was only on 212 screens versus the 1,384 \"Spaceballs\" had.\n\nBut neither was able to top the box office that weekend in 1987. That prize went to Tom Hanks and Dan Aykroyd in their movie adaptation of the classic TV show \"Dragnet.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Hocus Pocus\" and \"Free Willy\" — July 16, 1993\n\n\"Hocus Pocus\" worldwide box office: $45,395,069\n\n\"Free Willy\" worldwide box office: $153,709,806\n\nDisney's Halloween film starring Sarah Jessica Parker, Bette Midler, and Kathy Najimy may have out-grossed the family classic about an orphan befriending an Orca opening weekend with $8.1 million, but \"Free Willy\" spawned a trilogy for Warner Bros.\n\nIt took nearly 30 years for Disney to release a \"Hocus Pocus\" sequel with its original stars. It went straight to Disney+ in 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Casino\" and \"Toy Story\" — November 22, 1995\n\n\"Casino\" worldwide box office: $116,112,375\n\n\"Toy Story\" worldwide box office: $394,436,586\n\nMartin Scorsese's crime drama starring Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci was no match for Pixar's debut film about a cowboy (Tom Hanks) and space ranger (Tim Allen) toy going from frenemies to best buds.\n\nOpening weekend, \"Toy Story\" debuted to just over $29 million, nearly three times as much as \"Casino.\"\n\nSharon Stone received an Academy Award nomination for best actress for her role in \"Casino.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Jumanji\" and \"Heat\" — December 15, 1995\n\n\"Jumanji\" worldwide box office: $262,821,940\n\n\"Heat\" worldwide box office: $187,436,818\n\n\"Jumanji\" took no prisoners as it topped all at the box office this weekend with a $11 million opening.\n\n\"Heat\" came in third behind \"Toy Story\" with $8.4 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The Princess Diaries\" and \"Rush Hour 2\" — August 3, 2001\n\n\"The Princess Diaries\" worldwide box office: $165,335,153\n\n\"Rush Hour 2\" worldwide box office: $347,325,802\n\nIn a perfect example of counter-programming, both titles had strong opening weekends.\n\nBut it was Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker in \"Rush Hour 2\" that won not just this matchup but the entire weekend. It took in $67 million. Anne Hathaway's \"The Princess Diaries\" came in third with a respectable $23 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The Bourne Identity\" and \"Scooby-Doo\" — June 14, 2002\n\n\"The Bourne Identity\" worldwide box office: $214,034,224\n\n\"Scooby-Doo\" worldwide box office: $275,678,613\n\nThis might come as a shock, but it was the big-screen version of \"Scooby-Doo\" that beat out \"The Bourne Identity\" their opening weekend in theaters.\n\n\"Scooby\" brought in $54 million while \"Bourne\" earned $27 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Elf\" and \"Love Actually\" — November 7, 2003\n\n\"Elf\" worldwide box office: $227,356,156\n\n\"Love Actually\" worldwide box office: $247,933,248\n\nIn this face-off of two beloved holiday movies, Will Ferrell in \"Elf\" was simply no match.\n\nThe comedy brought in $32 million. \"Love Actually,\" despite coming out of the gates early as it had a limited theatrical release a week earlier, only brought in $6.8 million the first weekend it went wide (though it was only shown on 576 screens compared to over 3,000 for \"Elf\").\n\nBut, no one was gonna stop the winner of this weekend: \"The Matrix Revolutions.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The Dark Knight\" and \"Mamma Mia!\" — July 18, 2008\n\n\"The Dark Knight\" worldwide box office: $1,006,234,167\n\n\"Mamma Mia!\" worldwide box office: $694,478,392\n\nBoth Warner Bros. and Universal Pictures won big at the box office in summer 2008. At the time, Christopher Nolan's \"Batman Begins\" sequel had a massive opening weekend with $158.4 million.\n\n\"Mamma Mia!\" may have debuted at $27.7 million domestically, but it had a huge international audience, grossing more than $550 million overseas.\n\n\"Mamma Mia!\" was the highest-grossing movie musical until 2017 when Disney dropped its live-action \"Beauty and the Beast\" ($1.2 billion).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2\" and \"Winnie the Pooh\" – July 15, 2011\n\n\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2\" worldwide box office: $1,342,359,942\n\n\"Winnie the Pooh\" worldwide box office: $49,871,429\n\nPooh Bear was no match for Potter. Daniel Radcliffe and his powerful franchise completely obliterated the classic children's book character as the movie took in $169 million on its opening weekend compared to Pooh's $8 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Magic Mike\" and \"Ted\" — June 29, 2012\n\n\"Magic Mike\" worldwide box office: $167,282,206\n\n\"Ted\" worldwide box office: $549,368,315\n\nIn the battle between Channing Tatum with his stripper clan and Mark Wahlberg with a foul-mouthed stuffed bear, it was the latter that took the opening-weekend crown.\n\n\"Ted\" brought in $54.4 million while \"Magic Mike\" garnered $39 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows\" and \"Mission: Impossible — Ghost Protocol\" — December 16, 2011\n\n\"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows\" worldwide box office: $543,848,418\n\n\"Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol\" worldwide box office: $694,713,380\n\nIn the opening weekend, it looked like Robert Downey Jr. and his \"Holmes\" movie would get the best of Tom Cruise and his \"M:I\" franchise as RDJ's title brought in $39.6 million to win the entire weekend.\n\nBut \"Protocol\" feasted on the long game.\n\nOpening on just 425 screens (taking in an amazing $30,000 per screen), it only took in $12.7 million at first, but went on to earn over $200 million domestically; close to $700 million worldwide.\n\n\"Holmes\" would do lower figures both domestically and worldwide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Mad Max: Fury Road\" and \"Pitch Perfect 2\" — May 15, 2015\n\n\"Mad Max: Fury Road\" worldwide box office: $380,080,290\n\n\"Pitch Perfect 2\" worldwide box office: $287,144,079\n\nLike in the \"Sherlock Holmes\" vs. \"Ghost Protocol\" match-up, \"Pitch Perfect\" won the battle but not the war.\n\nThe Bellas won the opening weekend with $69.2 million in earnings versus the $45.4 million \"Fury Road\" brought in. But \"Fury Road\" ultimately won out at the global box office.\n\nRead next\n\nMovies Movie Oppenheimer\n\nMore...\n\nAdvertisement"
