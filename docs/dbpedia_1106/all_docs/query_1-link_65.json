        "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nWhen you think of theatrical animation, only one name immediately comes to mind: Pixar. For close to three decades, the Disney-acquired studio has captivated our collective imagination with highly relatable fables concerning humanity, ambition, regret, loss, resilience, bravery, acceptance and more. They single-handedly changed the game, ushering in a new era of 3D-rendered storytelling.\n\nPixar’s acclaimed library of 28 features contains a little something for everyone. Want to see what your childhood toys get up to when you’re not around? They’ve got you covered. Jonesing for a classic superhero story in the vein of Marvel’s First Family? Yep, they’ve got that too! Fancy a trip to the Italian Coast? Pack your bags!\n\nToy Story (1995)\n\nA Bug’s Life (1998)\n\nToy Story 2 (1999)\n\nMonsters, Inc. (2001)\n\nFinding Nemo (2002)\n\nThe Incredibles (2004)\n\nCars (2006)\n\nRatatouille (2007)\n\nWALL-E (2008)\n\nUp (2009)\n\nToy Story 3 (2010)\n\nCars 2 (2011)\n\nBrave (2012)\n\nMonsters University (2013)\n\nInside Out (2015)\n\nThe Good Dinosaur (2015)\n\nFinding Dory (2016)\n\nCars 3 (2017)\n\nCoco (2017)\n\nIncredibles 2 (2018)\n\nToy Story 4 (2019)\n\nOnward (2020)\n\nSoul (2020)\n\nLuca (2021)\n\nTurning Red (2022)\n\nLightyear (2022)\n\nElemental (2023)\n\nInside Out 2 (2024)\n\nPixar Movies in Chronological Order\n\nThanks to Pixar’s penchant for referencing past and upcoming movies by way of little Easter eggs (i.e. a Pizza Planet truck in A Bug’s Life or a Nemo toy in Monsters, Inc.), fans have come to wonder if all of the studio’s movies take place within the same shared universe. Pixar has never confirmed the theory, meaning you can watch the films in any order you please, save for the sequels and odd prequel. All 28 titles are currently streaming on Disney+.\n\nLightyear (2022)\n\nPreceding short: None\n\nFramed as the movie that inspired Andy’s favorite member of Space Command, Lightyear stars Chris Evans (of Captain America fame) as the intrepid Space Ranger. Despite the sizable brand recognition and positive reviews from critics (it currently holds a 74% score on Rotten Tomatoes), this grand, sci-fi prelude to the Toy Story universe failed to make a serious dent at the worldwide box office. Hell, it wasn’t even nominated for an Academy Award!\n\nToy Story (1995)\n\nPreceding short: None\n\nThe movie that started a 3D-animated revolution. What is there to say about Toy Story that hasn’t already been said? It’s an absolute classic, with iconic turns from Tom Hanks and Tim Allen as the clashing cowboy (Woody) and spaceman (Buzz Lightyear), respectively. The story — no pun intended — is so elegantly universal, masterfully answering the question of what our childhood play-things get up to when we’re not around. That’s for the kiddos. The adults, on the other hand, get to grapple with the existential question of what it means to exist. The movie was so groundbreaking, in fact, that the Academy had to give it a Special Achievement Oscar (the Best Animated Feature prize wouldn’t come into existence until the release of Shrek several years later). Toy Story nabbed critical acclaim (it holds a rare 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes) and made close to $400 million globally.\n\nA Bug’s Life (1998)\n\nPreceding short: Geri's Game\n\nAn insectoid take on Akira Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai, A Bug’s Life follows a colony of ants who decide to recruit a pack of “warrior bugs” in the hopes of repelling the swarm of locusts they’re forced to feed every summer. What the colony doesn’t know is that their scout, hapless inventor Flick (Dave Foley), has unknowingly hired a troupe of harmless circus performers. Definitely one of Pixar’s more underrated films, A Bug’s Life grossed $363 million worldwide and holds a 92% score on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nToy Story 2 (1999)\n\nPreceding short: Luxo Jr.\n\nPixar’s very first sequel, Toy Story 2 grapples with heavy theme of obsolescence and the loss of innocence. When he’s accidentally sold at a yard sale to an unscrupulous toy salesman (Wayne Knight), a damaged Woody decides that immortality as a priceless collectible in a Japanese museum is better than being discarded by your kid. Thankfully, a rescue mission led by Buzz helps the sheriff come to his senses. Grossing nearly half a billion dollars at the global box office, Toy Story 2 was another critical and financial success for the studio. The sequel also introduced fan favorite characters like Jessie (Joan Cusack) and Bullseye into the growing canon.\n\nMonsters University (2013)\n\nPreceding short: The Blue Umbrella\n\nBefore they became best friends and broke the all-time “Scare Record” in Monsters, Inc., Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) and James P. Sullivan (John Goodman) were academic rivals. While most fans of the Monsters, Inc. mythos would probably have preferred a direct sequel (one that gave us a tearful reunion between Sulley and Boo), Monsters University is still a great time (think Sky High, but with monsters) and a surefire way to make anyone a little nostalgic for their own college days. Holding an 80% score on Rotten Tomatoes, the prequel grossed $743 million worldwide.\n\nMonsters, Inc. (2001)\n\nPreceding short: For the Birds\n\nA wildly imaginative fable of friendship, ambition and not judging a book by its cover, Monsters, Inc. flips the age-old childhood fear of “there’s a monster in my closet” on its head. That beastie hiding amidst your sweaters and slithering under the bed is just as afraid of you as you are of it. Genius concept! In a parallel reality where monsters rely on the screams of children for power, two blue-collar “Scarers” — Mike and Sulley — learn that there’s nothing to fear from humans when a little girl named Boo accidentally finds her way into their world. Monsters, Inc. grossed $579 million globally and holds a 96% score on Rotten Tomatoes. It was also the first Pixar project to be nominated for the newly-created Best Animated Feature Oscar, though it lost to Hayao Miyazaki’s Spirited Away.\n\nFinding Nemo (2002)\n\nPreceding short: Knick Knack\n\nAn aquatic odyssey worthy of Steve Zissou, Finding Nemo ranks among Pixar’s greatest creations. Albert Brooks leads the voice cast as an anxiety-riddled and overprotective clownfish named Marlin, who sets off on an oceanic adventure to rescue his only child, Nemo (Alexander Gould), from an Australian scuba diver/dentist. Helping Marlin on his journey is a happy-go-lucky blue tang with severe memory loss named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres). The film grossed $940 million at the worldwide box office and holds a 99% score on Rotten Tomatoes. It was also the first Pixar released to win the Oscar for Best Animated Feature.\n\nThe Incredibles (2004)\n\nPreceding short: Boundin’\n\nA love letter to golden age comic books and ‘60s-era spy capers, The Incredibles has been described as an inspired riff on Marvel’s Fantastic Four. The second animated feature from director Brad Bird (The Iron Giant), the movie follows a family of super-powered individuals forced to conceal their abilities due to government legislation. Longing for the glory days of crime-fighting, Bob Parr (Craig T. Nelson), aka Mr. Incredible, takes on some freelance work and discovers a conspiracy to eliminate former superheroes. The film grossed $631 million at the worldwide box office, has a near-perfect score of 97% on Rotten Tomatoes, and the won Oscar for Best Animated Feature.\n\nCars (2006)\n\nPreceding short: One Man Band\n\nKa-Chow! An egotistical race car named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) gets a lesson in humility from a small community of easygoing vehicles along the famous Route 66. Cars grossed over $461 million worldwide and holds a 75% score on Rotten Tomatoes. It was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 79th Academy Awards, but ended up losing to Happy Feet.\n\nRatatouille (2007)\n\nPreceding short: Lifted\n\nA gastronomy-loving rat named Remy (Patton Oswalt) lives out of his dream of becoming a chef by teaming up with a bumbling new hire at a fancy Parisian eatery. The second Pixar effort helmed by Brad Bird, Ratatouille grossed $623 million globally and holds a near-perfect score of 96% on Rotten Tomatoes. It nabbed the Oscar for Best Animated Feature at the 80th Academy Awards.\n\nWALL-E (2008)\n\nPreceding short: Presto\n\nA lone, trash-compacting robot finds love (and a way to save the planet) on a post-apocalyptic Earth. An allegory for combatting pollution and climate change, WALL-E made $521 million at the box office and holds a 95% score on Rotten Tomatoes. It took home the Oscar for Best Animated Feature and became the first Pixar title selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.\n\nUp (2009)\n\nPreceding short: Partly Cloudy\n\nScarred by the premature death of his wife decades before, curmudgeon Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner) learns to re-embrace the world when he decides to move his entire house to South America with a large collection of balloons. The less said about the movie’s heartbreaking — and totally wordless — introduction, the better. I’m not quite ready for a good cry at the moment. Up nabbed $735 million globally, a 98% score on Rotten Tomatoes, and Best Animated Feature at the 82nd Academy Awards.\n\nToy Story 3 (2010)\n\nPreceding short: Day & Knight\n\nThe long-awaited trilogy capper in the Toy Story saga was something special. As Andy prepares to move away to college, his childhood toys are accidentally donated to a local preschool. Reinforcing the previous movie’s themes of abandonment and having to let go of the past, Toy Story 3 really hit home for longtime fans who were now coming of age themselves. The third installment grossed $1 billion worldwide and holds a 98% score on Rotten Tomatoes. It nabbed the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 83rd Oscars, beating out the likes of How to Train Your Dragon.\n\nCars 2 (2011)\n\nPreceding short: Hawaiian Vacation\n\nLightning, Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) and the rest of the wheeled Cars crew go international in this sophomore installment, which centers around the World Grand Prix, a contest to determine the fastest vehicle alive. Mater’s not racing, but he does get a chance to flex his espionage pistons alongside the suave Finn McMissile (Michael Caine). Cars 2 revved up $559 million at the box office but received a score of 39% on Rotten Tomatoes, the lowest rating of any Pixar movie to date.\n\nBrave (2012)\n\nPreceding short: La Luna\n\n“If you had the chance to change your fate... would you?” Boardwalk Empire star Kelly Macdonald leads Brave as Merida, a Scottish princess courageous enough to defy centuries of tradition. The film grossed $538 million globally and holds a 79% score on Rotten Tomatoes. It also won Best Animated Feature at the 85th Oscars.\n\nInside Out (2015)\n\nPreceding short: Lava\n\nA young girl’s emotions attempt to help her cope with a move to San Francisco. Make sure you’ve got a box of tissues nearby for this one, folks. Inside Out made $858 million globally and holds a 98% score on Rotten Tomatoes. It also took home the Oscar for Best Animated Feature at the 88th Academy Awards.\n\nThe Good Dinosaur (2015)\n\nPreceding short: Sanjay's Super Team\n\nSet in a reality where that huge asteroid never killed off the dinosaurs, The Good Dinosaur tracks the budding friendship between an Apatosaurus named Arlo (Raymond Ochoa) and a human child. Basically Pixar’s answer to The Land Before Time, the movie is often considered the black sheep of the studio’s cherished library. It grossed $332 million worldwide and holds a 75% score on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nFinding Dory (2016)\n\nPreceding short: Piper\n\nA semi-unnecessary sequel, Finding Dory follows the impaired blue tang as she sets out to find her long-lost parents. The maritime follow-up netted over $1 billion worldwide and a 94% score on Rotten Tomatoes. Interestingly, though, it was not nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 89th Academy Awards, but Disney still took home the prize with Zootopia.\n\nCars 3 (2017)\n\nPreceding short: Lou\n\nWhen a new generation of racers threatens to end his career, Lighting McQueen turns to an unconventional technician and trainer named Cruz Ramirez (Cristela Alonzo) for help. Cars 3 crossed the finish line with $383 million at the box office and a 69% score on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nCoco (2017)\n\nPreceding short: None\n\n“Remember me...” A wondrous and emotional celebration of Mexico’s Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead), Coco follows Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez), a 12-year-old boy and aspiring guitarist who embarks on an adventure through the Land of the Dead, discovering new things about his family and musical hero in the process. The film grossed $814 million globally and holds a 97% score on Rotten Tomatoes. It also won Best Animated Feature at the 90th Academy Awards.\n\nIncredibles 2 (2018)\n\nPreceding short: Bao\n\nThe long-awaited sequel picks up where the first movie left off: with the Parr family squaring off against the subterranean baddie known as The Underminer. The ensuing battle results in costly damage to the city, which only underscores why it was necessary to ban superheroes all those years ago. Their only shot at getting back into the spotlight is a PR campaign spearheaded by business tycoon, Winston Deaver (Bob Odenkirk) and his sister, Evelyn (Catherine Keener). Grossing over $1 billion globally, Incredibles 2 holds a 93% score on Rotten Tomatoes. It lost out on the Best Animated Feature Oscar to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.\n\nToy Story 4 (2019)\n\nPreceding short: None\n\nA somewhat unnecessary, yet stunningly-rendered sequel, Toy Story 4 is a prime example of how far Pixar has come over the years in terms of crafting lifelike animation. When Bonnie (Madeleine McGraw) creates a homemade toy named “Forky” (a hilarious Tony Hale), Woody begins to reevaluate his place in the world, questioning whether he needs to move from child-to-child for the rest of his immortal life. The movie, which brought back the character of Bo Peep (Annie Potts), garnered critical acclaim, over $1 billion at the box office, and an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.\n\nOnward (2020)\n\nPreceding short: None\n\nSet in a world of fantasy creatures, Onward centers around two elven brothers, Ian and Barley Lightfoot (voiced by Tom Holland and Chris Pratt respectively), who get a chance to spend one more day with their late father by way of some long-forgotten magic. Released into theaters just before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the film only grossed $141 million worldwide. It holds an 88% score on Rotten Tomatoes and was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 93rd Oscars, but lost to another Pixar title: Soul.\n\nSoul (2020)\n\nPreceding short: None\n\nWith movie theaters still closed at the time of its scheduled release date, Soul became the first Pixar film to make its debut on a streaming platform (Disney+). The studio’s most existential outing to date, the original story follows middle-school band teacher Joe Gardner (Jamie Foxx) hoping to become a professional jazz musician. Just as he’s about to get his big break, however, Joe falls down an open manhole and finds himself in The Great Before, a plane of existence where souls gain their personality traits before they’re sent to Earth to be born. Hoping to return to his body, Joe teams up with a precocious soul named 22 (Tina Fey), who doesn’t see the point in having a life. Soul received critical acclaim, $121 million at the box office, and the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.\n\nLuca (2021)\n\nPreceding short: None\n\n“Silencio Bruno!” The second Pixar movie to hit Disney+ amidst the pandemic, Luca brings audiences to the picturesque coast of Italy where two sea monsters — Luca (Jacob Tremblay) and Alberto (Jack Dylan Grazer) — attempt to pass themselves off as humans in a village full of people who would like nothing more than to spear themselves some creatures of the deep. Eventually grossing $50 million globally, Luca holds a 91% score on Rotten Tomatoes. It lost out on the Best Animated Feature at the 94th Academy Awards to another Disney release: Encanto.\n\nTurning Red (2022)\n\nPreceding short: None\n\nHelmed by Domee Shi (Oscar-winner behind the Pixar short “Bao”), Turning Red follows a dorky 13-year-old girl named Mei Lee (Rosalie Chiang) who discovers that the women in her family become giant red pandas when they get overexcited. It holds a near-perfect score of 95% on Rotten Tomatoes and was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 95th Oscars, but lost out to Guillermo del Toro and Mark Gustafson’s stop-motion Pinocchio. Given that it was initially released as a streaming exclusive on Disney+, Turning Red has only grossed $21 million to date.\n\nElemental (2023)\n\nPreceding short: Carl's Date\n\nContinuing the grand Pixar tradition of “What if this inanimate entity had feelings?” Elemental takes place in a bustling, metropolitan city populated by sentient beings made of Fire, Earth, Water and Air. An allegory for immigration and xenophobia, the film centers around a pair of star-crossed lovers from opposite sides of the tracks — Ember (Leah Lewis) and Wade (Mamoudou Athie) — who gradually fall in love, defying years of segregation and cultural ire between the communities of Fire and Water. The film grossed $496 million at the worldwide box office and currently holds a score of 73% on Rotten Tomatoes. It was also nominated for an Oscar at the 96th Academy Awards, but lost out to Hayao Miyazaki’s swan song: The Boy and the Heron.\n\nInside Out 2 (2024)\n\nThe sequel to 2015’s Inside Out catches back up with Riley (Kensington Tallman) in her early teens. This change-filled arrival at the doorstep of adolescence spells doom for our favorite band of feelings — Joy (Amy Poehler), Anger (Lewis Black), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Tony Hale taking over from Bill Hader) and Digust (Liza Lapira taking over from Mindy Kaling) — who find themselves muscled out of control by several newcomers: Anxiety (Maya Hawke), Ennui (Adèle Exarchopoulos), Embarrassment (Paul Walter Hauser) and Envy (Ayo Edebiri).\n\nUpcoming Pixar Movies To Look Out For\n\nElio (June 13, 2025)\n\nElio follows an imaginative young boy (Yonas Kibreab) who finds himself mistaken for Earth’s ambassador by an interplanetary organization known as the Communiverse. “Completely unprepared for that kind of pressure, Elio must form new bonds with eccentric alien lifeforms, survive a series of formidable trials and somehow discover who he is truly meant to be,” reads the official synopsis. America Ferrera (Olga, Elio’s mother), Jameela Jamil (Ambassador Questa), and Brad Garrett (Ambassador Grigon) round out the prinicipal voice cast.\n\nToy Story 5 (June 19, 2026)\n\nAnnounced last year during an earnings call with Disney CEO Bob Iger, Toy Story 5 is still shrouded in a great deal of mystery. All we know for certain is that A) Pixar has reached out to Tim Allen and Tom Hanks in the hopes that they will reprise Buzz and Woody and B) the sequel will open in theaters on June 19, 2026.\n\nCars 4 (TBD)\n\nWhile not officially confirmed by the studio just yet, a potential fourth chapter in the Cars franchise was teased by Jay Ward, Pixar’s Creative Director of Franchise, in 2023. “There are more Cars things brewing,” he told The Late Break Show. “I can’t quite say what yet, but Cars has a life that will keep going. I’m working on some really funny projects right now that you will see in the next couple years.”\n\nDespite the fact that Pixar’s status as the leading name in blockbuster animation has slightly waned over the years, its historic influence on the industry at large cannot be understated. Without the studio’s trailblazing innovations paving the way for close to three decades, we wouldn’t have such modern classics as The LEGO Movie or Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Not a bad legacy to have. Not bad at all."
