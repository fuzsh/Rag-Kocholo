It sounds like the Eyewitness TV show from USA Network will wrap up the story in one season. The show’s creator says that the series is an anthology program so a different story will be covered in season two. But, will the show’s ratings be good enough for it to be renewed or, will it be cancelled instead? Stay tuned.

A crime thriller, Eyewitness explores a grisly crime from the point of view of the eyewitnesses. The series begins as two teenage boys — Philip Shea (Tyler Young) and Lukas Waldenbeck (James Paxton) — secretly meet in a cabin in the forest to share a first kiss. While there, they witness a shooting and barely escape with their lives. Desperate to keep their relationship a secret and out of fear of being found by the perpetrator, they remain silent. Their lie grows when Philip’s foster mom, Sheriff Helen Torrance (Julianne Nicholson), takes the case. The rest of the cast includes Amanda Brugel, Gil Bellows, Matt Murray, Tattiawna Jones, and Warren Christie.

The ratings are typically the best indication of a show’s chances of staying on the air. The higher the ratings, the better the chances for survival. This chart will be updated as new ratings data becomes available.

Note: These ratings are collected by the Nielsen company and are the final national numbers. These are different from the fast affiliate numbers which are just estimates of the actual ratings and are reported on by most other outlets. The final nationals are typically released within 24 hours of the programming or, in the case of weekends and holidays, a couple days later.
