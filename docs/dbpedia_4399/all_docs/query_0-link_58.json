I think it's because, as you realise the value of your own life, you understand what others gave to save the country you live in. D-Day is the most remarkable story of our time. Having the Radio 2 listeners with us as we commemorate the anniversary will make for a unique broadcast, and Iâm looking forward to hearing their stories and memories.â\n\nThe Portsmouth Guildhall concert, D-Day 80: Commemorating the Normandy Landings, presented by Vernon, features the combined musical forces of the BBC Concert Orchestra and the BBC Big Band performing some of the best loved and most enduring music of that era.
