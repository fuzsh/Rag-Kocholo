The boys hide when the men enter the cabin. They see one of the men shoot the others before he turns to kill them. The boys manage to overpower him and escape into the night, hiding all evidence of the encounter and vowing not to tell anyone what happened. Helen Torrance, Philip's foster mother, and the sheriff of Tivoli, New York, goes to investigate the killings and finds that the FBI is already involved. Kamilah Davis, an FBI agent, tells Helen the three bodies are a routine gang killing linked to a drug trafficking crime family. Despite being warned to stay away, an invigorated Helen suspects there is something more going on. She and her deputy Tony begin investigating, starting with the car parked outside the cabin.\n\n2\"Bless the Beast and the Children\"Catherine HardwickeAdi HasakOctober 23, 2016 ( )0.63[9]\n\nPhilip spots the killer on the bus. Helen investigates the murder at the cabin, but comes into conflict with Kamilah, who is still trying to cover up the FBI's involvement in the murders. Meanwhile, the killer stalks Tommy, a friend of Philip's. The killer recognizes the leather jacket Tommy is wearing and believes that Tommy witnessed the shootings at the cabin; however, the jacket was actually given to Tommy by Philip. Philip and Lukas disagree about what they should do about having witnessed the shooting, especially after Tommy is found murdered and the killer is revealed to be someone close to the investigation.\n\n3\"Bella, Bella, Bella\"Scott PetersAdi Hasak & Angel Dean LopezOctober 30, 2016 ( )0.56[10]\n\nThe search for Bella, a potential witness, by both Helen and FBI agent Ryan Kane, continues as the case becomes more complex. Lukas and Philip head into the city to try to forget about what they saw and visit a gay club. Helen questions Mithat, Bella's drug-dealing father, as to the whereabouts of Bella and discovers a note Bella left for her lover. Helen makes yet another deal with Kamilah, having discovered that Kamilah's sister was responsible for a bomb at Mithat's apartment. Ryan finally catches up with Bella after she uses a stolen credit card. However, Bella's body is later found on the outskirts of Tivoli.\n\n4\"Crème Brulée\"Scott PetersAdi Hasak & Samir MehtaNovember 6, 2016 ( )0.57[11]\n\nParts of Helen's past are revealed as she tries to find out what happened to Bella.

Philip confesses to Helen and Gabe that he's gay. Kamilah tries to convince her sister to wear a wire and become an informant in return for witness protection. Lukas and Philip engineer a sex scandal in order to dispel the gay rumours surrounding Lukas. Helen uncovers more evidence of Bella's boyfriend, and Kamilah is arrested after drugs are found in her house.\n\n5\"The Lilies\"Kelly MakinAngel Dean Lopez & Samir MehtaNovember 13, 2016 ( )0.61[12]\n\nHelen and her husband go to Philip's mother's house to take her to a drug rehabilitation facility, but she is not ready. Lukas asks Philip to get him drugs from his mother since he is distraught about the shooting, but Philip refuses. Lukas confesses to Philip that he did not actually have sex with his girlfriend and that he has feelings for Philip. Ryan picks up Kamilah and she tells him her sister planted the drugs in her home. Helen uncovers evidence that supports her view that Bella was murdered and gets an autopsy warrant. Helen tells Ryan about the autopsy and the rape kit. Ryan replaces his DNA in Bella's body with Mithat's DNA. Lukas spends his allowance on fake drugs and Philip helps him get money. Lukas lies to his father and says that he needs to pay for his girlfriend to get an abortion. Despite a court order, Philip's mother goes to see him and meets Lukas. Ryan insists on not letting Helen arrest Mithat for child sex abuse yet. Philip's mother enters drug rehabilitation. Philip tells Helen that Lukas was at the cabin during the shooting and has the gun.\n\n6\"The Yellow Couch\"Kelly MakinSamir MehtaNovember 20, 2016 ( )0.62[13] 7\"They Lied\"Rob LiebermanAngel Dean LopezNovember 27, 2016 ( )0.61[14] 8\"The Larsons' Dog\"Rob LiebermanAdi Hasak & Samir MehtaDecember 4, 2016 ( )0.64[15] 9\"Savior Unknown\"Scott PetersAdi Hasak & Jennifer CotéDecember 11, 2016 ( )0.64[16] 10\"Mother's Day\"Scott PetersAdi Hasak & Kendall McKinnonDecember 18, 2016 ( )0.74[17]"
