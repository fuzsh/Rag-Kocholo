The second season picks up with Perry in the throes of the Los Angeles legal system during the height of the Great Depression. Alongside crackerjack assistant Della Street (Juliet Rylance) and hardboiled ex-cop Paul Drake (Chris Chalk), the former PI garners a reputation for taking on clients that few would dare to defend. Months after the Dodson trial shook the city, Perry is readjusting to life as a civil attorney when a high-profile murder case brings him back into the fold. As the DA homes in on a pair of brothers from a desolate Hooverville, Perry is thrust into the center of a vast conspiracy and forced to reckon with what it truly means to be guilty.\n\nSeason 2: Behind the Scenes\n\nPlay button link\n\n7:01\n\nEyewitness Account: Inside Season 2 (Part 3)\n\nThe cast and crew discuss the real meaning behind the illusion of justice, the real life person who inspired Camilla’s character, Paul’s future beyond Perry Mason and Associates and more.\n\nPlay button link\n\n7:16\n\nEyewitness Account: Inside Season 2 (Part 2)\n\nMatthew Rhys, Juliet Rylance, Chris Chalk, and more discuss Della's significant moment in the courtroom, Paul's moral compass, and the ongoing developments in Season 2.\n\nPlay button link\n\n6:56\n\nEyewitness Account: Inside Season 2 (Part 1)\n\nThe cast and crew explore what Perry, Della and Paul are navigating through in their personal lives since Season 1, the new characters we are introduced to in Season 2 and a big case that ignites a new fire in Perry.\n\nPlay button link\n\n5:13\n\nInvitation to the Set\n\nGet an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at what's coming for Perry and Associates in Season 2.\n\nScene of the Crime: Creating 1930s Los Angeles\n\nThe cast and crew reflect on the research and attention of detail that went into creating an authentic representation of the time period.\n\nFeatured Characters\n\nPerry Mason\n\nMatthew Rhys\n\nPaul Drake\n\nChris Chalk\n\nDella Street\n\nJuliet Rylance\n\nPete Strickland\n\nShea Whigham\n\nSeason 1: Behind the Scenes\n\nPlay button link\n\n4:40\n\nUnder The Fedora\n\nThe cast and creators of Perry Mason discuss how they took the legendary defense attorney character back to his gritty roots as a private investigator and recreated 1930s Los Angeles for a new kind of Perry Mason story.\n\nPlay button link\n\n2:28\n\nMeet The Characters\n\nDive deeper into Perry Mason's rich world of characters with each of the main cast members and writers Ron Fitzgerald and Rolin Jones as they explore both the new and familiar personas in Season one.\n\nPlay button link\n\n4:42\n\nA Conversation With Robert Downey Jr. and Matthew Rhys\n\nJoin Executive Producer Robert Downey Jr. and Perry Mason himself, Matthew Rhys, for an in-depth conversation about reinventing the character to create a whole new Perry Mason.\n\nPlay button link\n\n1:20\n\nThe Craft: Kat Goodson\n\nPost-Production Producer Kat Goodson takes us behind the scenes.\n\nPlay button link\n\n1:19\n\nThe Craft: Mako Kamitsuna\n\nPerry Mason editor Mako Kamitsuna discusses her journey into filmmaking.\n\nPlay button link\n\n4:18\n\nA Conversation with Susan Downey and Robert Downey Jr.\n\nExecutive Producers Robert Downey Jr. and Susan Downey discuss Perry Mason’s journey from P.I. to lawyer and why no character will come out of Season one unchanged.\n\nIt's All Here\n\nSign Up Now\n\n1 .
