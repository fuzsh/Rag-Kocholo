        "text": "I recently discovered that the average American watches two months’ worth of television per year, which would put you roughly at nine years’ worth of television-watching by the time you are 65. That’s just the average. As someone who probably spends double that time just scrolling through the void that is Netflix, I understand how easy it is to feel like you’ve watched everything that’s even worth looking at (even five seasons worth of Riverdale). I made this list for fellow TV connoisseurs who think they’ve watched everything, filled with some of the most underrated shows that you (probably) haven’t watched.\n\nThe Magicians (2015) U.S.A.\n\nThis fantasy drama is often referred to as an adult Harry Potter, but their similarities pretty much start and end in magic schools. As someone who usually isn’t a fan of fantasy-drama, The Magicians really stands out because, on top of all the crazy magic-themed plots, the story is really driven by the characters and their relationships with each other. Another reason why The Magicians is so unique is its ability to not take itself seriously all the time. It’s aware that it’s camp and it leans into those moments, which just makes the emotionally-charged and serious storylines/moments that much more important. It also possibly holds the record for the best love story told in a span of 20 minutes.\n\nBarry (2018) U.S.A\n\nGoing into this show as a fan of Saturday Night Live and Bill Hader in general, I didn’t quite know what to expect. I knew that he was a strong impressionist with incredible comedic timing, however I didn’t know how that could possibly translate into a show about a hitman turned aspiring actor. Upon watching (and re-watching it three times now) this show has quickly become one of my favourites. It has everything a TV show should have: mystery, tension, comedy, drama, all whilst the audience are constantly at the edge of their seats. Hader proves himself as not only an incredible dramatic actor but also as an incredibly solid writer and director throughout the show’s two seasons so far. I couldn’t possibly recommend this show enough.\n\nPlease Like Me (2013) Australia\n\nIf you’re a fan of Hannah Gadsby’s comedy or Josh Thomas’ recent US debut Everything’s Gonna Be Okay, you will most likely enjoy this Australian dramedy. It follows the ‘twenty-somethings trying to figure it out’ story model that we are so accustomed to, but unlike most tv dramas or sitcoms about twenty-year-olds, Please Like Me feels like you are just hanging out with friends (rather chaotic friends to be fair). The whole show has the ‘vibes’ of a web series, where you can tell that it’s very personal to the cast and crew, but with the budget of a major broadcast television channel. It’s a heart-warming show that tackles a lot of major issues affecting young people in a funny, light-hearted manner.\n\nGreat News (2017) U.S.A.\n\nI think having Tina Fey as an executive producer automatically disqualifies you from being an underrated show, however as a big fan of sitcoms I am yet to find someone else who has watched this. I love any show that has an original premise and ‘television news producer who finds out her mother is the new intern’ sold me straight away. Not to mention that the comedic performances are great. The show very much feels like a newer, updated version of 30 Rock and overcomes the major issue that most sitcoms seem to have: repetitiveness.\n\nMade in Mexico (2018) U.S.A./ Mexico\n\nI know there’s a lot of people who like to put themselves above watching reality TV, but I really think Netflix created a hidden gem with Made in Mexico (that is until they cancelled it). A good reality show captures the audience not by the situations but rather the characters, and trust me, Made in Mexico definitely has those characters…The show follows eight Mexican socialites and their luxurious lives (think Real Housewives). From comparing kidnapping stories to designing a world peace themed clothing line that looks like something straight off Redbubble, this is easily one of the most fun bingeable shows on Netflix.\n\nMerlí (2015) Spain (Catalan)\n\nThis is another one of my favourite TV shows, so I might be extremely biased when I tell people that it’s one of the best teen dramas I have watched. For starters, the characters actually have parents who seem to have a say in their lives, unlike every other teen show out there, but it extends beyond that. The characters are extremely relatable without it feeling like the writers are trying too hard to be trendy or relevant. It feels more like a drama starring teens, rather than a show desperately trying to target the teenage demographic. It tackles the everyday life problems of a philosophy class aided by their teacher and the father of one of the main characters, Merlí, in a very European manner. In case you have already watched the show. I recommend the spin-off series Merlí: Sapere Aude, a continuation of Pol’s story (aka the best character from the original show).\n\nLos Espookys (2019) U.S.A.\n\nThere is no way to explain this show except by saying that it’s as if Salvador Dalí was alive and decided to make an HBO comedy series. It follows a group of friends who create ‘horror-film-like’ situations for a living in some country in Latin America. In the nicest possible way, the whole show sort of feels like a fever dream, as it constantly crosses the line between supernatural occurrences and orchestrated events. The show is executive produced by comedy legend Lorne Michaels and stars Julio Torres and Fred amongst others. For fans of SNL’s Papyrus sketch or surrealist humour, I recommend this show.\n\nPanic (2021) U.S.A.\n\nAs one of my most recent watches, I would recommend Panic to anyone who was a fan of the novel turned film Nerve (2016). It’s a similar premise: there’s a high-stakes daring game which the protagonist enters in the hopes of getting enough money to leave her town. Unlike Nerve, however, Panic is filled with twists and turns, keeping you on the edge of your seat throughout the 10 episodes. The show slowly reveals information to us so that we are compelled to try to figure out the conspiracy for ourselves. As someone who tends to figure out the ending of shows immediately, I can say that I really didn’t see the ending coming. I also really enjoyed that the majority of the cast is relatively unknown, so I found it really interesting to see new talent in a show that had such a high budget.\n\nEyewitness (2016) U.S.A. or Øyevitne (2014) Norway\n\nBoth the American remake and the original Norwegian show are great ways to delve into the highly underrated nordic noir genre. Eyewitness follows the story of two boys who accidently witness a triple homicide. There is so much tension that builds up throughout the ten episodes, that even as an audience you don’t know who to trust or who to side with. If that doesn’t convince you of how good the show’s premise and execution is, maybe the fact that it was not only adapted in the U.S.A. but also by HBO Europe in Romania and TF1 in France will. I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of true crime or just crime dramas in general. Nordic noir is the TV/film genre that best depicts crime stories in the most realistic and capturing manner.\n\nNow Apocalypse (2019) U.S.A.\n\nThough short, Now Apocalypse is incredibly entertaining, not only because you’ll find yourself saying “oh isn’t that the guy from that show?” two to three times an episode, but also because there is never a dull moment in this show. Most likely pitched as a ‘millennial fever dream’ the show has literally everything, from aspiring actors to angels and aliens. It’s a very fast binge watch. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for something somewhat similar to Euphoria (2019)."
