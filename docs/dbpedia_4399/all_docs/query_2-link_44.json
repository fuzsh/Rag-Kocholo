        "text": "This article is updated frequently as titles leave and enter Hulu. *New additions are indicated with an asterisk.\n\nHulu is still primarily known for television as it’s the best place to watch current shows the next day. With that in mind, this guide mostly includes Hulu originals, exclusives like their deal with FX, and shows that have completed their run, but Hulu is also the place for current comedies we love like Abbott Elementary. With that FX deal and a robust original programming slate, they’re one of the best streamers out there for TV, maybe the best, so expect this list to be rotated and updated regularly. There’s a lot to choose from.\n\nThis Month’s Critic’s Pick\n\nSherlock\n\nYears: 2010-2017\n\nLength: 4 seasons, 13 episodes\n\nCreators: Mark Gatiss, Steven Moffat\n\nThe BBC hit that made Benedict Cumberbatch a star and redefined the legend of Sherlock Holmes is just sitting there on Hulu waiting to occupy your weekend. More like a series of films than a traditional American TV season, Sherlock is smart mystery television with two magnetic performances from Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman, along with the future Tom Ripley, Andrew Scott.\n\nDrama\n\n*24\n\nYear: 2001-2014\n\nLength: 9 seasons, 192 episodes\n\nCreator: Joel Surnow, Robert Cochran\n\nOften forgotten when people discuss the most influential and important shows of the Peak TV era, this massive FOX hit is still a wildly entertaining show, even if some of its politics now look even more problematic than they did in the ‘00s. If you can ignore some of the show’s stereotypes and politics, Kiefer Sutherland has never been better than he is as the iconic Jack Bauer, one of the most beloved TV characters of the modern era. The best seasons of 24 are more entertaining than any action movie released this year in theaters.\n\nThe Americans\n\nYears: 2013-2018\n\nLength: 6 seasons, 75 episodes\n\nCreator: Joe Weisberg\n\nArguably the best show of the 2010s, this FX drama stars Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys as Elizabeth and Philip Jennings, a seemingly average couple with two kids living in ‘80s suburbia. It turns out that they’re actually undercover Russian operatives, staying on step agent of the FBI agent (Noah Emmerich) who happens to be their neighbor. Smart, sexy, moving, and thrilling, this show really feels like nothing else on TV then or now. It’s such a daring, brilliantly written program, and time will be very kind to it.\n\nThe Bear\n\nYears: 2022-present\n\nLength: 3 seasons, 28 episodes\n\nCreator: Christopher Storer\n\nOne of the most critically acclaimed new shows of 2022, The Bear is the story of a sandwich shop owner in the Windy City, and the pressures of life in the food business. Jeremy Allen White is spectacular in the lead role, but he’s ably supported by great turns from Ayo Edibiri and Ebon Moss-Bacharach. Expect them all to be Emmy players again. It’s both one of the funniest and most stress-inducing shows on TV.\n\nFargo\n\nYears: 2014-present\n\nLength: 4 seasons, 41 episodes\n\nCreator: Noah Hawley\n\nAll four seasons (so far — year five is currently in production) of this twisted gem are exclusively available on Hulu, and there’s really no logical reason not to watch this show as soon as possible if you have yet to see it. Noah Hawley’s critical darling is simply brilliant, starting with a wonderfully entertaining first season anchored by Billy Bob Thornton and Martin Freeman, and then developing into an arguably-better second season. Years 3 & 4 may not live up to the first two but remains must-see TV. Just trust us on this one. Watch them all.\n\nFriday Night Lights\n\nYears: 2006-2011\n\nLength: 5 seasons, 76 episodes\n\nCreator: Peter Berg\n\n“Clear eyes, full heart, can’t lose.” TV hasn’t really been the same without Coach Taylor, the leading man of this NBC hit. There’s a remarkable array of quality highs and lows in its five-year run, but when this story of small town life and sports-centric communities was at its best, it was very, very good. Progressive in the way it handled the lives of young people without talking down to them, it feels like a re-appreciation of Friday Night Lights as one of network TV’s best modern shows is right around the corner.\n\nHannibal\n\nYears: 2013-2015\n\nLength: 3 seasons, 39 episodes\n\nCreator: Bryan Fuller\n\nIt’s hard to believe this was ever on television. Bryan Fuller did the impossible, using the Thomas Harris books about Hannibal Lecter in a way that escaped the shadow of Sir Anthony Hopkins to become its own twisted thing. Mads Mikkelsen is perfect in the title role, a forensic psychiatrist who basically plays with FBI investigator Will Graham (Hugh Dancy) like a cat would a mouse. More formally daring than anything that’s been on network TV since Twin Peaks, the only bad thing about Hannibal is that we didn’t get more of it.\n\nJustified\n\nYears: 2010-2015\n\nLength: 6 seasons, 78 episodes\n\nCreator: Graham Yost\n\nFX premiered one of the best Elmore Leonard adaptations of all time in 2010, introducing the world to the beloved Raylan Givens, perfectly embodied by Timothy Olyphant. Givens is an old-fashioned hero in a modern world, dealing with the forces of evil in his corner of Eastern Kentucky, particularly one tough guy played unforgettably by Walton Goggins. Smart, thrilling, and character-driven, one wishes there were more shows like this (and Raylan is back in the excellent limited series Justified: City Primeval, also on Hulu).\n\nMoonlighting\n\nYears: 1985-1989\n\nLength: 5 seasons, 67 episodes\n\nCreator: Glenn Gordon Caron\n\nHeld up in music rights issues for decades, this ABC hit dramedy was finally made available to Hulu subscribers in October 2023. A show so far ahead of its time that it feels like creators are still catching up to it, Moonlighting made Bruce Willis a star as David Addison, half of a couple with Cybill Shepherd that solved crimes while defining the will-they-won’t-they dynamic of the era. It fell apart too soon, but there’s still so much to love over these five seasons. Start here with a primer on the most essential episodes.\n\nThe Shield\n\nYears: 2002-2008\n\nLength: 7 seasons, 88 episodes\n\nCreator: Shawn Ryan\n\nThe only place you can watch one of the best cop shows of all time is Hulu. Shawn Ryan’s FX drama helped shape the modern TV landscape with its no-holds-barred presentation of cops who operate in a very gray area or morality. Michael Chiklis and Walton Goggins really drive the show, but the entire ensemble works, especially later season-long guest stars like Glenn Close and Forest Whitaker. This is a must-see.\n\nShōgun\n\nYear: 2024-present\n\nLength: 1 season, 10 episodes\n\nCreators: Rachel Kondo, Justin Marks\n\nForty-four years after the ratings-breaking mini-series of the same name, FX has returned to the world of Shōgun, based on the hit novel by James Clavell. This 10-episode series is a gorgeously rendered epic, the story of a British sailor named Blackthorne (Cosmo Jarvis) who lands on the Japanese shores at a time of great conflict, and completely changes history in the process. Co-starring Hiroyuki Sanada and Anna Sawai, this version if even better than the Richard Chamberlain original. It may have begun its life as a limited series, but it’s been renewed for another season.\n\nSons of Anarchy\n\nYears: 2008-2014\n\nLength: 7 seasons, 92 episodes\n\nCreator: Kurt Sutter\n\nKurt Sutter’s macho reimagining of Hamlet in the world of a California motorcycle gang often gets a bad rap as nothing more than macho posturing. This is a much smarter, daring show than you might think at first, and it’s anchored by stand-out performances from Ron Perlman and Katey Sagal, who was robbed for at least one Emmy nomination for her work here. This is another long-running drama with some rocky, sub-par seasons, but the entire trip is worth the ride overall.\n\nUnder the Bridge\n\nYear: 2024\n\nLength: 1 season, 8 episodes\n\nCreator: Quinn Shephard\n\nRebecca Godfrey’s non-fiction book of the same name gets an empathetic, moving adaptation with some of the best performances of 2024. Riley Keough plays Godfrey herself, alongside Lily Gladstone as the investigating officer and Archie Panjabi as the mother of Reena Virk, a Canadian teenager who was murdered in 1997. Nuanced without being melodramatic, it’s the rare true crime mini-series that takes its human responsibility very seriously. It’s a quest for understanding that will destroy you.\n\nComedy\n\nAbbott Elementary\n\nYears: 2021-present\n\nLength: 4 seasons, 49 episodes\n\nCreator: Quinta Brunson\n\nThis is the show that proved that there’s still life in the network TV comedy. Hysterically funny and subtle in its social commentary, it’s the tale of a Philadelphia elementary school with a great staff but few resources. Shot like a mockumentary, it has incredibly sharp writing, but Abbott Elementary’s best asset is its ensemble, one of the best of its era of comedy television.\n\nArcher\n\nYears: 2009-2023\n\nLength: 14 seasons, 142 episodes\n\nCreator: Adam Reed\n\nWhen this spoof of James Bond and other suave spy properties, who could have guessed that it would be on the air for almost 15 years? The saga of Sterling Archer has become an epic one, spinning through several dream seasons that took the voice actors in an entirely different direction. It’s a bit past its prime, but there’s stuff to enjoy through the entire fun of Archer. (If you’re looking for the best of the best, check out this list.)\n\nAtlanta\n\nYears: 2016-2022\n\nLength: 4 seasons, 41 episodes\n\nCreator: Donald Glover\n\nThe last couple of pandemic-delayed seasons of Atlanta, both of which aired in 2022, were pretty divisive, but there’s some undeniable genius in these 20 episodes, especially in the very satisfying end run of the show. Now that we can look at Donald Glover’s creation as a whole, it’s easier to appreciate its broad swings and willingness to feel like nothing else on TV. It’s also going to be fun to watch talents like Glover, Brian Tyree Henry, LaKeith Stanfield, and Zazie Beetz get more and more popular.\n\nBetter Things\n\nYears: 2016-2022\n\nLength: 5 seasons, 51 episodes\n\nCreators: Pamela Adlon, Louis C.K.\n\nOne of television’s smartest comedies is this gem created by and starring Pamela Adlon. The brilliant comedian presents a skewed version of her own life balancing parenthood with working as an actress, and the result is as confessional, hysterical, and daring as any comedy of the modern era. This show still feels a bit under the radar of where it deserves to be. Maybe time will correct that now that it’s completed its run. Be on the right side of history now.\n\nThe Great\n\nYears: 2020-present\n\nLength: 3 seasons, 30 episodes\n\nCreator: Tony McNamara\n\nMost period pieces aren’t as wickedly hysterical as this one. From the Oscar-nominated writer of The Favourite, this is a fictional reimagining of the true story of Catherine the Great, played perfectly here by Elle Fanning. When she’s thrust into a loveless marriage with Emperor Peter III (Nicholas Hoult), Catherine is forced to play political and even sexual games to get what she wants. This is such a clever, creative show, an examination of power and ego that may take place centuries ago but feels remarkably timely too.\n\nIt’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\n\nYears: 2005-present\n\nLength: 16 seasons, 170 episodes\n\nCreator: Rob McElhenney\n\nFX’s longest-running show also has one of the network’s most devoted fan bases. The dark comedy about a bunch of misanthropic lunatics in a Philadelphia bar has been surprisingly consistent over its remarkable run — season 16 is in production now. If you like shows about selfish people behaving very badly, take a look at this, and marvel at how often this program has pushed the envelope in terms of taste and somehow survived changes in TV comedy to remain as popular as ever.\n\nOnly Murders in the Building\n\nYears: 2020-present\n\nLength: 3 seasons, 30 episodes\n\nCreators: Steve Martin, John Hoffman\n\nOne of the best original shows of the streaming era stars Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez as unlikely allies in a series of murder mysteries. The first season centered on a suspicious death in their high-class apartment building that had ties back to the youth of Gomez’s character. The second season? Another murder and a few more memorable guest stars. The third season is currently in production with Paul Rudd and Meryl Streep for a premiere later this year.\n\nReservation Dogs\n\nYears: 2021-2023\n\nLength: 3 seasons, 28 episodes\n\nCreators: Sterlin Harjo, Taika Waititi\n\nOne of the best comedies on television is this phenomenal coming-of-age story about young people on a reservation. Blending cultural resonance with universally relatable themes, the writers find a way to make comedy television that feels completely fresh and new. Alternately very funny and incredibly moving, this is a must-see for all generations.\n\nSchitt’s Creek\n\nYears: 2015-2020\n\nLength: 6 seasons, 80 episodes\n\nCreators: Eugene Levy, Daniel Levy\n\nThis is one of the biggest word-of-mouth hits of all time. When it started, people barely noticed. By the time it ended? It was the biggest comedy on television, winning multiple Emmys. What happened? Well, people noticed the perfect timing between Eugene Levy, his son Daniel Levy, Catherine O’Hara, and Annie Murphy. However, the show got even better when it highlighted supporting players like Emily Hampshire and Chris Elliott. It’s hilarious even if you’re watching it for the second or third time.\n\nHorror, Sci-Fi, and Fantasy\n\nAmerican Horror Story\n\nYears: 2011-present\n\nLength: 12 seasons, 128 episodes\n\nCreators: Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk\n\nAmerican Horror Story is so popular and so long-lasting that it’s become a powerhouse brand. Sure, it’s not as culturally vibrant as it once was, but fans of this anthology series are loyal to the twisted visions of Ryan Murphy and his team of regular collaborators. Personal favorites are the original (rebranded as Murder House), the demented Asylum, and the underrated Cult.\n\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer\n\nYears: 1997-2003\n\nLength: 7 seasons, 144 episodes\n\nCreator: Joss Whedon\n\nThis show is still dismissed by some people as a “teen soap opera with fangs,” but anyone who doesn’t recognize how brilliant and important this show is to the history of television simply hasn’t seen it. Buffy helped redefine audience expectations, proving that deep, progressive social commentary could be embedded in a show about monsters and that people of all ages could get it. There is so much genre TV that followed — from Stranger Things to Westworld — that owes a debt to this show.\n\nFirefly\n\nYear: 2002\n\nLength: 1 season, 14 episodes\n\nCreator: Joss Whedon\n\nThe top of almost every list of “shows canceled too soon,” it almost feels like the brief run of this FOX sci-fi show helped to cement its legacy. Would we still be talking about it so much if it had been on for years? The fact that FOX couldn’t see what they had in Firefly actually had a greater impact — illustrating how creatively naïve the networks were at a time when companies like HBO were stealing talent away. See for yourself how big a mistake they made.\n\nGravity Falls\n\nYears: 2012-2016\n\nLength: 2 seasons, 40 episodes\n\nCreator: Alex Hirsch\n\nA lot of animated programming aimed at kids goes on for years and years. It feels like there has to be at least 4,000 episodes of SpongeBob Squarepants by now. But this Disney hit is a rare exception, running for only two phenomenal seasons, and leaving viewers wanting more. The result is a tight series run that really doesn’t have a single bad episode in it. The story of two kids whose uncle runs one of those tourist-trap mystery shops — only this one contains some actual mysteries — works for all ages.\n\nThe Handmaid’s Tale\n\nYears: 2017-present\n\nLength: 5 seasons, 56 episodes\n\nCreator: Bruce Miller\n\nHulu has lagged behind Netflix in the original drama department with one huge exception, the Emmy-winning thriller based on the Margaret Atwood novel about a dystopian future that feels increasingly and disturbingly like life in the 2020s. The show has struggled some since its universally-acclaimed first year, but the performances continue to make it worth everyone’s time, especially the leading one from Elisabeth Moss, one of the best actresses of her generation. And it’s headed into its final season soon. We’re all curious to see where this saga ends.\n\nThe Last Man on Earth\n\nYears: 2015-2018\n\nLength: 4 seasons, 67 episodes\n\nCreator: Will Forte\n\nOn the one hand, it’s amazing that something as delightfully strange as this sci-fi comedy ran for four seasons on network TV. On the other hand, we’re still angry that FOX canceled the show after a cliffhanger, denying Tandy (Will Forte) and his friends the narrative closure this show really deserved. Here’s what we need — everybody watch this on Hulu. If it’s their #1 streaming show, maybe they’ll get the gang together for a Deadwood-style closure movie.\n\nLost\n\nYears: 2004-2010\n\nLength: 6 seasons, 121 episodes\n\nCreators: Jeffrey Lieber, J.J. Abrams, Damon Lindelof\n\nOur current era of twisty TV with hits like Yellowjackets wouldn’t exist if this ABC masterpiece hadn’t built its foundation. The first season was a legitimate phenomenon, telling the story of a group of plane crash survivors who discover they have landed in a very unusual place. Brilliantly written and rivetingly directed, it holds up very well, even in the “lesser” seasons that turned fans on the show.\n\nWhat We Do in the Shadows\n\nYears: 2019-present\n\nLength: 5 seasons, 50 episodes\n\nCreator: Jemaine Clement\n\nJemaine Clement adapted his own 2014 film into a show that’s even better than its source material. Sort of “The Real World with vampires,” this is a mockumentary look at a group of immortals who just happen to be living in Staten Island. The writing is incredible, but it’s the timing of the cast here that slays, including Kayvan Novak, Matt Berry, Natasia Demetriou, Harvey Guillen, and Mark Proksch. They’re always funny.\n\nThe X-Files\n\nYears: 1993-2002, 2016-2018\n\nLength: 11 seasons, 218 episodes\n\nCreator: Chris Carter\n\nChris Carter’s show truly changed the way people looked at genre TV in the ‘90s, paving the way for the next two decades of hit sci-fi and supernatural programming. At its peak, it was one of the best shows on TV, and those episodes have held up as well as anything from the era. Pick out your faves and don’t be surprised if you get sucked back into the entire saga of Mulder, Scully, Skinner, and the Cigarette Smoking Man.\n\nIf you subscribe to a service through our links, Vulture may earn an affiliate commission."
