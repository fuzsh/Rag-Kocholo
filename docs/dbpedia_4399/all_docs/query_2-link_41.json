        "text": "#100. The Handmaid's Tale\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.4\n\n- Years on the air: 2017-present\n\nBased on the dystopian novel by Margaret Atwood, this acclaimed Hulu show stars Elisabeth Moss as a woman struggling for freedom in a misogynistic, alternate-reality version of America that religious extremists have taken over. Far more critically and commercially successful than the ill-fated 1990 feature film of the same name, \"The Handmaid's Tale\" has received critical acclaim and sufficient zeitgeist traction to warrant a \"Saturday Night Live\" parody.\n\n#99. Fringe\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.4\n\n- Years on the air: 2008-2013\n\nThe same team behind the 2009 big-screen \"Star Trek\" reboot, J.J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman, and Roberto Orci launched this Fox show about a Boston-based FBI team that explores mysteries related to the existence of parallel universes. While it didn't quite manage to seize the zeitgeist to the degree of Abrams' previous hit, \"Lost,\" the show received positive reviews that improved with each subsequent season. Additionally, the series garnered two Emmy Awards nominations.\n\n#98. Scrubs\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.4\n\n- Years on the air: 2001-2010\n\nBill Lawrence's medical drama/sitcom \"Scrubs\" ran for nine seasons over a decade. It follows, and is narrated by, J.D. (Zach Braff), as he navigates his hospital career and romantic life alongside best friend Turk (Donald Faison), on-again-off-again partner/friend Elliot (Sarah Chalke), and the intimidating, patronizing Dr. Cox (John C. McGinley). Largely praised by critics and fans in its earlier seasons, the often comedic and sometimes deeply emotional \"Scrubs\" was one of the more well-liked major network products of the 2000s. Additionally, \"Scrubs\" received 17 Emmy nominations.\n\n#97. Brooklyn Nine-Nine\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.4\n\n- Years on the air: 2013-2021\n\nThis goofy cop show stars former \"SNL\" cast member Andy Samberg as a juvenile and irreverent detective forced to shape up when a strict new commanding officer (Andre Braugher) takes over his precinct. Critics praised the show's easygoing humor along with Samberg's charming performance, and following its debut season \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" clinched Golden Globes for best series and best actor in the Musical/Comedy category. Additionally, the show received 11 Emmy nominations, bringing home two. Fox eventually canceled it, but NBC picked it up for several more seasons.\n\n#96. Supernatural\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.4\n\n- Years on the air: 2005-2020\n\nDebuting on The WB (and continuing its run on The CW when the network changed names), this sci-fi/horror series follows a pair of vigilante brothers hunting down various supernatural entities. It concluded its run in 2020 and stands as CW's longest-running show and the longest-running live-action fantasy series of all time.\n\nYou may also like: Best true crime series of all time\n\n#95. Samurai Jack\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.5\n\n- Years on the air: 2001-2017\n\nA samurai from the past gets trapped in a dystopian future by a demonic overlord who he must defeat in this unique and stylish animated action-adventure series from Genndy Tartakovsky, the visionary behind shows like \"Dexter's Laboratory.\" The series ran for four seasons in the early 2000s before being revived for a fifth and final season in 2017.\n\n#94. Bosch\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.5\n\n- Years on the air: 2014-2021\n\nThe first season of \"Bosch\" takes inspiration from the novels of author Michael Connelly. It follows Harry Bosch, played by Titus Welliver, an LAPD detective investigating a murder while also standing trial for the murder of a serial killer. The Amazon series continued for seven seasons before rebranding as \"Bosch: Legacy\" in 2022.\n\n#93. Louie\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.5\n\n- Years on the air: 2010-2015\n\nWritten, directed, created, edited, and produced by comedian Louis C.K., who also starred, this show constantly subverted expectations of television as a format. The tone oscillated unpredictably between funny and serious, the visual and editing style varied wildly between episodes, and the show played fast and loose with continuity. The show took home three of its 22 Emmy Awards nominations, including the trophy for Outstanding Casting For A Comedy Series.\n\n#92. Sacred Games\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.5\n\n- Years on the air: 2018-2019\n\nBased on the 2006 novel of the same name by author Vikram Chandra, \"Sacred Games\" was the first Netflix original series out of India. The neo-noir series ran for two seasons and follows a cop and a gang boss uniting to save Mumbai. The New York Times listed \"Sacred Games\" as one of the 30 best international TV shows of the 2010s, the only Indian series to make the list.\n\n#91. Schitt's Creek\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.5\n\n- Years on the air: 2015-2020\n\nCreated by and starring Dan Levy and his father, comedy legend Eugene Levy, \"Schitt's Creek\" is an offbeat-yet-heartwarming sitcom. It follows a family's fall from grace as they lose their fortune and resort to residing in the small town they once purchased as a joke. The show's success took off slowly and didn't fully establish a fan base until after it began streaming on Netflix. Since then, however, \"Schitt's Creek\" received widespread commercial and critical success, becoming the first show to sweep all seven comedy categories at the Primetime Emmy Awards in 2020.\n\n#90. Silicon Valley\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.5\n\n- Years on the air: 2014-2019\n\nCreated by Mike Judge (\"Beavis and Butthead,\" \"Office Space\") this HBO comedy chronicles the rise of a software startup run and staffed by geeky programmers. Critics and fans heralded the strong joke writing and a standout performance by T.J. Miller as Erlich, the world's most obnoxious business mentor. Although difficulties on set led to Miller's departure from the show at the end of the fourth season, the show continued to draw unanimously positive reviews all the way up to its finale; it finished its run on HBO in 2019. The show garnered two of its 41 Emmy Awards nominations during its five-year run.\n\n#89. The Expanse\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.5\n\n- Years on the air: 2015-2022\n\nOriginally on the Syfy channel, this show based on \"The Expanse\" series of books is set in a universe where the solar system has been colonized. An ice hauler ship named the Canterbury is involved in an accident, sending the crew into the center of a conspiracy that threatens the uneasy peace among different planetary governments. Canceled in 2018, Amazon revived the series for new seasons on Prime. Amazon began airing the show's sixth and final season in December 2021.\n\n#88. Entourage\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.5\n\n- Years on the air: 2004-2011\n\nThis HBO guilty pleasure follows the career of Vincent Chase, an actor from Queens who brings a tagalong crew of friends from the old neighborhood with him for his ride to Hollywood stardom. Reviewers enjoyed Jeremy Piven's portrayal of Vince's slimy Hollywood agent, but criticized the shallow characters and plotlines, while audiences were happy to live vicariously in Chase's hedonistic world. A 2015 movie that tied up some loose ends from the show garnered poor reviews and underperformed at the box office. The show received 26 nominations after its seven-year run, winning six awards.\n\n#87. Person of Interest\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.5\n\n- Years on the air: 2011-2016\n\nLike several shows on this list, the first season of \"Person of Interest\" received a mixed response from critics for its shallow character development, while later seasons seemed to remedy the issue. The story sees an ex-CIA operative and a scientist teaming up to try to prevent crimes before they occur. The show's creator, Jonathan Nolan, is the brother of director Christopher Nolan. In 2012, the show received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Sound Mixing For A Comedy Or Drama Series (One Hour).\n\n#86. Cobra Kai\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.5\n\n- Years on the air: 2018-present\n\nRalph Macchio and William Zabka reprise the roles that made them famous in this series that acts as a sequel to \"The Karate Kid\" films. \"Cobra Kai\" started streaming on YouTube Red before being acquired by Netflix for its third season.\n\nYou may also like: Best Emmy-nominated shows of all time\n\n#85. Big Little Lies\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.5\n\n- Years on the air: 2017-2019\n\nThis HBO drama, based on the best-selling novel by Liane Moriarty of the same name, features an A-list cast that includes Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman, and Laura Dern. The show is set in a wealthy coastal town in California where deception and murder lurk beneath the picture-perfect surface. Despite initially being billed as a miniseries HBO brought it back for a second season, adding Meryl Streep to the stacked cast. The series received 21 Emmy Awards nominations, winning eight.\n\n#84. The Punisher\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.5\n\n- Years on the air: 2017-2019\n\nJon Bernthal (\"The Walking Dead\") plays a vigilante superhero whose revenge quest brings him face to face with New York's underworld. Critics found the first season to be a slow start, but Marvel fans hungry for more content between movies were willing to jump on board. The show was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Stunt Coordination For A Drama Series, Limited Series Or Movie in 2018.\n\n#83. Futurama\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.5\n\n- Years on the air: 1999-2023\n\nFox's animated show from \"The Simpsons\" creator Matt Groening follows the adventures of an interplanetary delivery outfit, parodying movies and TV shows from all corners of science fiction along the way. Although it never rose to the level of popularity of \"The Simpsons,\" the show received almost universal critical acclaim, with 14 Emmy nominations and six wins over the course of its run. Among them included the award for Outstanding Animated Program, which the show took the Emmy for several times.\n\n#82. Spartacus\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.5\n\n- Years on the air: 2010-2013\n\nSteven S. DeKnight, who went on to develop \"Daredevil\" on Netflix and \"Pacific Rim: Uprising,\" created the Starz show based on the historical gladiator Spartacus. Initially starring Andy Whitfield as the title character, the show focuses on the slave uprising begat by Spartacus. In 2004, the show received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Sound Editing For A Miniseries, Movie Or A Special. Whitfield died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2011, and Liam McIntyre replaced him in the leading role.\n\n#81. Hannibal\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.5\n\n- Years on the air: 2013-2015\n\nBased on the Thomas Harris novels \"Red Dragon\" and \"Hannibal,\" this show sees Mads Mikkelsen stepping into the role of brilliant forensic psychologist/cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter (previously portrayed by Anthony Hopkins and Brian Cox in movie adaptations of Harris's novels). Hugh Dancy plays his protégé, a profiler who is unaware of his mentor's secret double life. The show employed José Andrés, a prominent restaurateur, to serve as a consultant in order to ensure that Lecter's culinary preparation of human flesh was realistic. During its run, \"Hannibal\" received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Special Visual Effects In A Supporting Role in 2016.\n\nYou may also like: Best 'Dick Van Dyke Show' episodes\n\n#80.

In addition to helping launch the career of Donald Glover, the show featured Chevy Chase in a supporting role.

Ozark\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.5\n\n- Years on the air: 2017-2022\n\nAn atmospheric crime drama series, \"Ozark\" follows a man and his family as they move from Chicago to Missouri so he can launder money for a drug lord.

Star Meghan Markle would go on to royal fame, marrying British Prince Harry in May 2018. The show produced a Jessica Pearson spin-off, titled \"Pearson,\" that canceled after a single season in 2019.\n\n#77.

Flight of the Conchords\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.6\n\n- Years on the air: 2007-2009\n\nNew Zealand musicians and comedy performers Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie star as fictionalized versions of themselves in \"Flight of the Conchords.\" Unlike in real life, the duo are struggling musicians, uprooted from New Zealand in an attempt to make it big in New York City. Kristen Schaal co-stars as the duo's only fan, with Rhys Darby as their incompetent manager. The show was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Original Music And Lyrics in 2008.\n\n#74. Atlanta\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.6\n\n- Years on the air: 2016-2022\n\nAfter his success in \"Community,\" Donald Glover has had multiple creative endeavors, including creating and starring in \"Atlanta.\" At times surreal and always thought-provoking, the series follows Glover and Brian Tyree Henry as cousins navigating the Atlanta rap scene.

While the premise may sound familiar, the show's sweet but strange tone sets it apart. Creator Pendleton Ward has acknowledged influences as far-ranging as \"Dungeons and Dragons,\" \"Beavis and Butthead,\" and \"Ren and Stimpy.\" Another unusual aspect of the show is its approach to voice casting. While many animated shows employ adult actors for their child characters, \"Adventure Time\" cast an actual child actor (Jeremy Shada) to voice the character of Finn. As such, Finn's voice deepened through the show's run, as Shada progressed through puberty. The beloved animated series received 15 Emmy Awards nominations, winning eight trophies in total.\n\n#71.

The character of Givens is adapted from an Elmore Leonard short story. Critics praised Olyphant's performance and the show's seedy worldbuilding. The show brought home two of the eight Emmy Awards nominations it received during its five-year run.\n\n#69. Deadwood\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.6\n\n- Years on the air: 2004-2006\n\nSeries creator David Milch initially tried to pitch HBO a show set during the Roman period. But when it turned out the network already had such a show in the works (\"Rome\"), Milch reworked the concept to a Western frontier town setting. The show features poetic, almost Shakespearean dialogue, and standout performances from Timothy Olyphant as Deadwood's sheriff and Ian McShane as a brothel owner. Its relatively short run left fans clamoring for more, and finally, they received a long-discussed \"Deadwood\" movie in May 2019. The \"Deadwood\" series won eight of its 28 Emmy Awards nominations and one Golden Globe.\n\n#68. The Newsroom\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.6\n\n- Years on the air: 2012-2014\n\nAaron Sorkin (\"The West Wing,\" \"The Social Network\") co-created this HBO news drama alongside producer Denis Biggs.

During its run, the show was honored with the 2012 Critics' Choice Television Award for Most Exciting New Series.\n\n#67. Archer\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.6\n\n- Years on the air: 2009-2023\n\nThis FX animated hit milks workplace comedy from an unlikely source: a spy agency. H. Jon Benjamin lends his distinctive voice to the main character, an arrogant and juvenile superspy, while the late Jessica Walter of \"Arrested Development\" played his overbearing mother who also happens to run the agency.\n\n#66. Boardwalk Empire\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.6\n\n- Years on the air: 2010-2014\n\nThis crime drama starred Steve Buscemi as an Atlantic City mob boss during the Prohibition era. While not a hit on the same level as HBO's contemporary Mafia series \"The Sopranos,\" the show received positive reviews. What's more, it won 20 Primetime Emmy Awards over its run, as well as a Golden Globe for Best Television Series–Drama in 2011.\n\n#65. Doctor Who\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.6\n\n- Years on the air: 2005-present\n\nListed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the longest-running science fiction program, \"Doctor Who\" has been on the air since 1963. The show has had many different actors take on the role of the show's lead character, known only as \"The Doctor.\" The Doctor travels through time, faces numerous otherworldly adversaries, and has an ever-changing companion. The series has an expansive fan base and made waves by casting Jodie Whittaker as the first woman to play The Doctor in 2017 and casting Ncuti Gatwa as the 16th Doctor, the first Black actor to take on the role.\n\n#64. The X-Files\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.6\n\n- Years on the air: 1993-2018\n\nMulder and Scully form the iconic duo portrayed by David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, respectively, in \"The X-Files.\" The pair of FBI agents investigated cases involving the paranormal, with Mulder believing in the existence of aliens and Scully remaining the skeptic. The series was a pop culture phenomenon, spawning two feature films and two seasons for a revival. The cult classic also garnered 61 Emmy Awards nominations, winning 15 trophies.\n\n#63. House of the Dragon\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.6\n\n- Years on the air: 2022-present\n\nSet long before the events of \"Game of Thrones,\" this HBO epic tells the tale of the rise and fall of the House Targaryen, spanning decades. Each episode has amassed millions of views upon airing, and the show has garnered mostly positive critical success. George R.R. Martin, the author of the \"Game of Thrones\" books and of \"Fire & Blood,\" which \"House of the Dragon\" sources from, is an executive producer on the show and is reportedly more actively involved in the production of this show than he was with \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\n#62. Shameless\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.6\n\n- Years on the air: 2011-2021\n\nA remake of a British series, this Showtime dramedy takes on the struggles of a Chicago family headed by a deadbeat patriarch (William H. Macy) whose only concerns are what his next scheme will be and where his next beer will come from. Although some critics initially thought Macy was miscast, he has racked up three Screen Actors Guild awards for his performance in the role. The show's ninth season made it the longest-running Showtime show in the network's history. Emmy Rossum, who plays Macy's eldest daughter Fiona, did not return as a regular for the 10th season, and the show concluded with its 11th and final season in 2021. During the show's decade-long run, \"Shameless\" took home four of its 16 Emmy Awards nominations.\n\n#61. Parks and Recreation\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.6\n\n- Years on the air: 2009-2015\n\nThe brainchild of the creator and the head writer of the U.S. version of \"The Office,\" this workplace comedy employed that show's same mockumentary style to depict the workings of a quirky parks and recreation department in Pawnee, Indiana. Critics initially found the show lacking compared with its predecessor, but warmed to the charms of the ensemble cast (headed up by Amy Poehler). After a shaky start, the show found its groove and became a hit for NBC. In its entire run, the show received 14 Emmy Awards nominations.\n\n#60. Mindhunter\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.6\n\n- Years on the air: 2017-2019\n\nThis Netflix crime drama follows two FBI agents who essentially write the book on criminal profiling in the late 1970s by interviewing serial killers. Leads Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany have great chemistry in the leading roles, the former playing a meticulous idealist and the latter a gruff cynic. Critics praised the show for its cerebral plotting and creepy interview scenes with some of history's most famous murderers. Groff took home the Best Actor in a Drama / Genre Series at the Satellite Awards in 2018. In January of 2020 Netflix told TVLine the show's third season had been put on indefinite hold.\n\n#59. Sons of Anarchy\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.6\n\n- Years on the air: 2008-2014\n\nThis FX crime drama revolved around a motorcycle gang based out of Central California.
