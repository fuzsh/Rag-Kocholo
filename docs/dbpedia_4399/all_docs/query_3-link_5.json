        "text": "You know the one (if you're American. Idk if they did this elsewhere). The teacher would put on the show and have you take notes or answer questions from a worksheet. It had a catchy tune. The intro was a camera zipping through a series of white, cg rooms with animals from around the globe. I think the intro ended with a picture of a dude doing a spread pose and he had like eight limbs (if you've seen the intro for cunk on earth you know what I'm talking about.).\n\nYesss that's the one! That shit was dope!! I wonder if they still play that in schools today. Hell, there are youtubers and tiktok people with similarly informative content.\n\nI'd be surprised, since the videos are from the mid to late 90's so the information may be outdated. It was based on a book series and those are still being made I think.\n\nYesss that's the one! That shit was dope!! I wonder if they still play that in schools today. Hell, there are youtubers and tiktok people with similarly informative content.\n\nI graduated HS in the mid 2010s and some of my teachers from time to time would show education-focused YT videos from Crash Course, Veritasium, etc instead of older stuff from VHS or DVDs like I was used to in elementary school in the 2000s.\n\nBack when I was in the 6th grade in the mid-80's, our teacher would take us to the Library's media room to watch a slide show on the Gal√°pagos Islands and other science stuff.\n\nThe way it worked... there were the slides and there was a tape. And whenever there was a beep on the tape, the person handling the slide machine would advance to the next one.\n\nI loved being the one that did that. And I would usually always get to do it. Except this one time. And I was pissed. The machine had a switch that would let you advance through the slides quickly, so unless you tapped the button ever so slightly, you would advanced two or three slides. So without anyone noticing, I flipped the switch.\n\nMy poor classmate kept skipping slides And having to go back. And try to get on the correct slide. Till the teacher told me to get back on the machine. I flipped the switch back to normal speed, and there were no more skipped slides.\n\nSo young and so evil.\n\nHonestly, my science teachers rarely showed movies or science TV. Sometimes they'd break out a laserdisc for the novelty, but that's it.\n\nWhen it came to distracting us with film instead of teaching us, nothing beats Music class. We watched Perfect Harmony or Newsies more than we actually learned anything about music. Otherwise, we were allowed to play around with the Macs that they had installed in the room. I remember people surfing Netscape or playing Missile Command.\n\nLooking back, it was kind of a disgrace. Obviously as a student I wanted every opportunity to phone it in, but some of these classes were absolute jokes."
