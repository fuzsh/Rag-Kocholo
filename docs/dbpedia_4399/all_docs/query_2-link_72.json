He has perfected the Oscillation Overthruster, which allows him to travel through solid matter by using the eighth dimension. However, former scientist and now complete crackpot Dr. Emilio Lizardo devises a plot to steal the device and bring an evil army back to destroy Earth.\n\nWhy you should watch: Put simply, this one is utterly bonkers and utterly brilliant. It's a classic and one of the most entertaining B-movies from the 80s. Not only did it launch the career of Peter Weller, but also Clancy Brown, Jeff Goldblum and even Jonathan Banks has a small role. Buckaroo Banzai is a cult character that is often referenced in pop-culture, most recently and most notably in \"Ready Player One\" and even \"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou\" and it's one of the biggest crimes in cinema that this franchise hasn't been developed further. A sequel was written but tragically never made it to the big, or small screen.\n\nFree on Amazon Prime\n\nBattle Beyond the Stars\n\nSynopsis: In what is to all intents and purposes \"Seven Samurai\" set in space, a young farmer, Shad (Richard Thomas) sets out to recruit a band of mercenaries to defend his peaceful planet, which is under threat of invasion by the evil tyrant Sador (John Saxon) and his army of Malmori mutants. Sador possesses a deadly \"stellar converter\" beam weapon on his formidable warship and threatens to use if the people of Akira don't surrender to his rule.\n\nWhy you should watch: This B-movie with a bigger budget than most has an important part to play in the history of sci-fi cinema. It launched the career of James Cameron, who was working in the art department and this is where he met his future production partner and wife Gale Anne Hurd, which resulted in \"The Terminator\" and \"Aliens.\" Producer and director and B-movie maestro, Roger Corman, sadly had to use much of his budget just to pay overpriced stars George Peppard and Robert Vaughn, but the end result is still good fun, plus the James Horner soundtrack is great (this was his first major motion picture score).\n\nFree with ads on Amazon Prime\n\nThe Blackout\n\nSynopsis: The Earth has been attacked by a mysterious force from space, but it's not like any attack you might imagine. The whole planet has been robbed of power and plunged into darkness; nothing works, anywhere…with the exception of a random circular area of eastern Europe, encompassing part of western Russia, southern Finland, Belarus and northern Ukraine. It turns out that the position of the Moon relative to Earth shielded this part of the world from the deadly energy weapon fired from far outside the range of lunar orbit. Now, as the actual alien invasion begins, military forces gather inside the \"circle of life\" in a desperate effort to save all life as we know it.\n\nWhy you should watch: This is a Russian indie sci-fi flick that is extremely enjoyable. It has high production values despite not having a blockbuster budget, the performances are good, and an unusual story with a good twist at the end makes this a solid sci-fi movie worth making time for.\n\nFree with with a Shout! Factory TV trial\n\nClose Encounters of The Third Kind (Theatrical Version)\n\nSynopsis: Roy Neary, an Indiana everyman, finds his quiet and ordinary daily life turned upside down after a close encounter with an unidentified flying object, spurring him to an obsessed cross-country quest for answers. But the government is also aware of strange and fantastic \"X-Files\"-worthy incidents taking place all over the world...and everything is pointing to a rendezvous with an extraterrestrial race.\n\nWhy you should watch: This is arguably one Steven Speilberg's finest movies and unquestionably the best performance from Richard Dreyfuss. The character development, dialogue and frankly, just the writing overall, is phenomenal. Moreover, a incredible cast helps makes everything in this movie believable and joining Dreyfuss is François Truffaut, Bob Balaban and Teri Garr, who also delivers a career best performance.\n\nFree with Amazon Prime\n\nEncounter\n\nSynopsis: Malik Khan, a decorated Marine (Riz Ahmed), goes on a rescue mission to save his two young sons from an strange, alien threat. As their journey takes them in increasingly dangerous directions, the boys will need to leave their childhoods behind. However, is this this threat real, or is it all in Khan's mind?\n\nWhy you should watch: If you have a thing for extreme close ups of insects, then this movie is definitely for you. If you enjoyed Invasion then you'll probably enjoy this; it's a beautifully filmed, character-driven sci-fi. OK, it has a few plot holes, and it even suffers from a few clichés, but thankfully, these can be fairly easily overlooked. You'll soon get drawn into the enthralling \"is-he, isn't-he\" plot, which is boosted further by phenomenal performances from Ahmed and Lucian-River Chauhan and Aditya Geddada, who portray his two sons.\n\nFree with Amazon Prime\n\nGood Night Oppy\n\nSynopsis: The film follows Opportunity, the Mars Exploration Rover affectionately dubbed Oppy by her creators and scientists at NASA. Oppy was originally expected to live for only 90 days, but it ultimately explored Mars for nearly 15 years.\n\nWhy you should watch: This is an inspiring documentary by Ryan White and for those that aren't aware of this fascinating story, it will almost certainly prove to be insightful. Opportunity and Spirit were identical probes and travelled for over six months to reach Mars. Spirit was launched on July 7, 2003 and Opportunity followed three weeks later. Angela Bassett provides the narration and frankly her voice is like autonomous sensory meridian response and will effectively provide any calming sensation that might be required at the end of a particularly hard day at work.\n\nFree with Amazon Prime\n\nIt Came From Outer Space (1953)\n\nSynopsis: A spaceship from another world crashes in the Arizona desert and only an amateur stargazer and a schoolteacher suspect alien influence when the local townsfolk begin to act strangely.\n\nWhy you should watch: Without a doubt this movie should much be considered among the amazing new trend of sci-fi movies that began to emerge in the 1950s as say, \"The Day The Earth Stood Still,\" \"The Thing from Another World,\" When Worlds Collide\" and \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers.\" Solid performances from the cast — who probably no one will actually know nowadays, tragically — and a super original story from Ray Bradbury, make this epic Sunday afternoon viewing.\n\nNever Surrender: A Galaxy Quest Documentary\n\nSynopsis: Filmmakers and stars discuss the filming and social effects of \"Galaxy Quest,\" a parody-of-sorts of \"Star Trek: The Original Series\" with insightful and entertaining commentary not only on science fiction, and the success of \"Star Trek\" itself, but on the real-life actors themselves.\n\nRelated: 'Galaxy Quest 2' is 'a fabulous script' according to Tim Allen\n\nWhy you should watch: Who isn't a fan of \"Galaxy Quest\"? It's often called the second best \"Star Trek\" movie ever made (after \"The Wrath of Khan\" of course) and you might think you know all the trivia connected with the making of \"Galaxy Quest,\" but this documentary made by the Screen Junkies team will still surprise you. The cast talk about their experiences making the movie and how close the TV series actually came, before the tragic, untimely departure of the great Alan Rickman. You'll laugh and you'll cry a little bit, but most of all, you'll enjoy the best movie about fandom in another, new way as a result of watching this documentary. Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Sam Rockwell, Tony Shalhoub, Justin Long, Wil Wheaton, Brent Spiner, Rainn Wilson, Missi Pyle and Dean Parisot, all share their thoughts on this epic sci-fi comedy.\n\nFree with a Paramount+ trial on Prime\n\nRoboCop (1987)\n\nSynopsis: Set more or less in the present day, a giant corporation steps in to take over the running of local law enforcement following a strike by police officers responding to worsening personal safety conditions. Meanwhile, a prototype cyborg police officer is also being developed that requires the participation of a human subject, all they need is \"some poor schmuck to volunteer.\" When it turns out that the CEO of said Evil Corporation is in cahoots with the Crime Boss of the whole city, events take a deadly turn for everyone involved.\n\nWhy you should watch: This is a contemporary classic. The over-the-top violence and less-than-subtle sub-themes are all an extremely accurate representation of the capitalist-fuelled culture that we've created for ourselves. All the while, it successfully retains a moving storyline as writer and director Paul Verhoeven masterfully intertwines action, well-written dialogue and very dark humor. Plus solid performances from Peter Weller, fresh from \"Buckaroo Banzai,\" along with Nancy Allen, Miguel Ferrer, Ronny Cox, Dan O'Herlihy and the legendary Kurtwood Smith.\n\nFree on Amazon Prime\n\nRoboCop (2014)\n\nSynopsis: In the not too distant future, multinational conglomerate OmniCorp is at the center of robot technology. Now the giant corporation wants to incorporate their controversial technology to the domestic market and they see a golden opportunity to do it. When Alex Murphy — a loving husband, father and honest cop doing — is critically injured in the line of duty, OmniCorp sees their chance for a part-man, part-robot police officer. OmniCorp envisions a RoboCop in every city and even more billions for their shareholders, but they never counted on one thing: there is still a man inside the machine pursuing justice.\n\nWhy you should watch: This movie should've been a worthwhile remake, at least as good as the original. However, ludicrous amounts of interference from Sony studio executives ensured that it would never reach its full potential, despite the best efforts of director José Padilha, who has publicly talked about the experience. He wasn't even allowed to produce an R-rated movie, this is PG-13; a far cry from the original. Even a frankly mind-blowing cast, including Joel Kinnaman, Michael Keaton, Samuel L. Jackson, Jackie Earle Haley and Gary Oldman, tragically couldn't save it. But, it's still worth a watch, not least for the interesting reinterpretations that have been woven into the fabric of story.\n\nFree with Amazon Prime\n\nThe Tomorrow War\n\nSynopsis: Set in the present day, a group of time-travelling soldiers from the future appear during the Qatar World Cup final and announce that in just 30 years in the future, all of mankind is on the brink of annihilation by race of particularly unpleasant aliens. Among those chosen to travel forward in time is former soldier (naturally) and schoolteacher Dan Forester (Chris Pratt) who teams up with both seasoned veterans and raw recruits to save the human race.\n\nRelated: 'The Tomorrow War' won't win any awards, but it's watchable\n\nWhy you should watch: This is very much a popcorn sci-fi blockbuster, equal to the likes of \"Independence Day\" or \"Battle: Los Angeles,\" and in fact you will notice the influence of other sci-fi movies like \"The Thing\" or \"Edge of Tomorrow\" and \"Millennium\" throughout. And while this won't win any awards for the story writing, it's wanton destruction on a massive scale.\n\nFree with Amazon Prime\n\nWar of the Worlds (2005)\n\nSynopsis: Tom Cruise plays a divorced dockworker and less-than-perfect father, but not long after his ex-wife and her new husband drop off his teenage son and young daughter for a weekend visit, a peculiar and powerful lightning storm suddenly starts in the skies above New Jersey. What follows is the extraordinary battle against Martian invaders seen through the eyes of a dysfunctional American family struggling to stay alive in this contemporary adaptation of H.G. Wells classic sci-fi story.\n\nWhy you should watch: Here's the thing: once you get past the absurd part of the plot that has the Martian tripod war machines having been buried on Earth, then this is actually a pretty good movie. Cruise is frankly brilliant and so is Dakota Fanning and Tim Robbins, it's just such a shame that Justin Chatwin's character is so incredibly annoying. There is a massive underlying theme reflecting on the events of 9/11, but thankfully it's not too obvious and Steven Spielberg handles the set pieces as you'd expect, with creative cinematography and masterful direction.\n\nFree with a Paramount+ trial on Prime Video\n\nWhat We Left behind: Looking Back at Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\n\nSynopsis: Showrunner Ira Steven launched the fundraising campaign a couple of years ago and what followed was an incredible tribute documentary looking at the history of \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\" that features interviews with almost every member of the cast, including Nana Visitor, Terry Farrell, Rene Auberjonois, Alexander Siddig and Andrew Robinson. Sadly though, Avery Brooks' contribution is limited to archive footage.\n\nWhy you should watch: If you're a fan of \"DS9\" than this is a must-watch; not only are the insights intriguing and often emotional, but the fictional first episode of a hypothetical new series, crafted together in a writers room packed full of the best writers in \"Star Trek\" is inspired. There's a look back at the early reviews (and how negative they were), the casting decisions and the issues faced throughout production. This documentary also marks the first time any footage from \"DS9\" has been remastered in high definition including a portion of the main battle sequence from \"Sacrifice Of Angels\" (S06, E06).\n\nFree with ads on Amazon Prime\n\nTV shows\n\nThe Expanse\n\nSynopsis: A police detective in the asteroid belt, the first officer of an interplanetary ice freighter, and an earth-bound United Nations executive slowly discover a vast conspiracy that threatens the Earth's rebellious colony on the asteroid belt. Along the way, evidence of alien life is discovered and a series of ring gates located near Uranus are unlocked that lead to totally new locations through the universe. Meanwhile, the major factions in the Solar System (Earth, Mars, the Outer Planets Authority and the Belters) fight amongst themselves and ultimately threaten all life on Earth.\n\nWhy you should watch: \"The Expanse\" has well and truly earned its place among the titans of TV sci-fi, up there along with \"Battlestar Galactica\" and \"Babylon 5.\" It's by far the most cerebral sci-fi currently on television. You can catch up on everything that happened in Season 1 to 3 here, and a lot happened. Then you can catch up with everything that happened in Season 4 here. Personally, we believe seasons 1 and 2 were ever so slightly better than 3 and 4, but that doesn't in any way mean they're not worth watching. Then along came Seasons 5 and 6 and blew everyone's socks off. It is brilliant. The plot is incredibly complex and engaging and the individual performances are exceptional.\n\nFree with Amazon Prime\n\nFallout\n\nSynopsis: Based on one of the greatest video game series of all time, \"Fallout\" is the story of haves and have-nots in a world in which there’s almost nothing left to have. 200 years after the apocalypse, the gentle denizens of luxury fallout shelters are forced to return to the irradiated hellscape their ancestors left behind — and are shocked to discover an incredibly complex, gleefully weird and highly violent universe waiting for them. From executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, the creators of \"Westworld,\" starring Ella Purnell, Aaron Moten and Walton Goggins.\n\nWhy you should watch: This is a standalone story that happens to be set in the \"Fallout\" universe...that also happens to include a ton of little Easter eggs, for those who have enjoyed the video games...but because it doesn't rely on any existing characters, you don't need to have played the games to enjoy this. And enjoy it you will. This and \"Silo\" on Apple TV are by far, the best we've ever seen in the sensational, but sparsely populated sub-genre of Post-Apocalyptic Nuclear Shelter Sci-Fi. The production value on this show is breathtaking and Walton Goggins excels.\n\nFree with Prime Video\n\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\n\nSynopsis: Arthur Dent's house has been scheduled for demolition to make way for a new bypass, but this is the least of his problems as it turns out that the planet Earth has been scheduled for demolition to make way for a new hyperspace express route. Thankfully though, it also turns out that his friend Ford Prefect isn't from Guildford after all, but in fact from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, and has been long aware of the Earth's impending demise. Together they manage to escape and along the way learn the true history of the universe.\n\nWhy you should watch: This one is a real treat and will unquestionably appeal to fans of British humor and more specifically, the epic humor of Douglas Adams. Made in 1981, this is still (tragically) the best adaptation that's been brought to either the big or small screen. The visual effects certainly haven't stood the test of time, but that's not why you're watching it; you're watching it because it shows beautifully how the relationship between Arthur Dent (Simon Jones) and Ford Prefect (David Dixon) develops.\n\nFree with a BritBox trial on Prime Video\n\nThe Man in the High Castle\n\nSynopsis: Loosely based Philip K. Dick's novel, this alt-history story looks at what the world might look like if World War II had ended differently. In this dystopian scenario, the Axis powers won the war, leading to the USA being divided into three zones: Imperial Japanese, Nazi and a buffer zone between the two. Despite the oppression, hope emerges when some mysterious cans of film turn up that seem to show a parallel world — and even more bizarrely, footage of different versions of the same people. A woman, Juliana Crain (Alexa Davalos) believes the films contain the key to freedom and is determined to find their elusive guardian — the man in the high castle.\n\nWhy you should watch: Alt-history is a difficult genre to perfect without descending into a cascade of clichés. If you're a fan however, you should definitely check out the works of Harry Turtledove, a writer who nails it every single time. This show can be hard going at times and the Juliana Crain character can be extremely frustrating. That said, Rufus Sewell, who plays Obergruppenführer John Smith, is magnificent to watch. There are four seasons, and yes, the show does dip a little bit in the middle, but it picks up in the fourth season. Stick with it.\n\nFree with Amazon Prime\n\nNight Sky\n\nSynopsis: The series centers around Franklin and Irene York, a couple who years ago discovered a chamber buried in their backyard which inexplicably leads to a strange, deserted planet. They've carefully guarded their secret ever since, but when an enigmatic young man enters their lives, the Yorks' quiet existence is quickly upended, and the mysterious chamber they thought they knew so well turns out to be much more than they could ever have imagined.\n\nWhy you should watch: It's very much a character driven story, with almost all the focus on Sissy Spacek's and J.K. Simmons' characters as they struggle with getting old. If you enjoyed \"Invasion\" on Apple+ last year, then you'll definitely enjoy this. It's slow paced, but the incredible performances easily carry this and it will be interesting to see where exactly the writers take us.\n\nFree with Amazon Prime\n\nThe Peripheral\n\nSynopsis: Sometime in the near-future in a small town in rural America and focuses on Flynne — a young woman whose only escape from the daily grind is playing advanced video games — and her older brother, Burton. Flynne (yes, it's a nod to \"Tron\") is such a good player, that her brother often lets her play for him, whenever money is at stake and they need it. But when a mysterious new prototype system, with full body sensory capability, is sent to him, he let's her use it first...and it opens up a dangerous, but exciting, new world full of adrenaline and adventure.\n\nWhy you should watch: This one has proved divisive with its audience and here's the simple truth: if you enjoyed shows like the monotonous, meaningless and utterly overrated \"Westworld\" or even \"Lost,\" then you might like this. It's based, very loosely, on the 2014 book of the same name written by William Gibson. However, the equally overrated Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy were executive producers, which explains why this is such a monumental train wreck and it's a damn shame, because Gibson's novel is excellent — as you'd expect — and the first three episodes actually showed promise. Sadly, not even Chloë Grace Moretz or Gary Carr could save it.\n\nFree with Amazon Prime\n\nSpace: 1999\n\nSynopsis: Moonbase Alpha is a research colony nestled in the Lunar crater Plato. Along with scientific study, it also monitors silos of atomic waste from Earth stored on the Moon's far side. On September 13th 1999, disaster strikes; a build up of magnetic energy causes an explosive chain-reaction of the waste, blasting the Moon out of Earth's orbit and off the plane of the ecliptic, out of the Solar System. The inhabitants of Moonbase Alpha are trapped, unable to return to Earth and wander the galaxy on their unique celestial spacecraft.\n\nRelated: Documentary about the Eagle transport launches Kickstarter campaign\n\nWhy you should watch: From the mind of Gerry Anderson, who also gave us \"Thunderbirds,\" this one benefitted from an amazing cast, including the phenomenal Martin Landau, together with Barbara Bain and Nick Tate. The first season is currently available to watch and while many of the practical effects look dated today, don't forget that this show — and especially the first season — contained some pretty horrific scenes, in particular, \"Dragon's Den\" (S01, E08), that mentally scarred many young sci-fi fans at the time.\n\nFree with ads on Amazon\n\nStargate SG1\n\nSynopsis: Set a few years after the movie and following the successful mission to the planet Abydos, the Stargate program was shut down. Or it was, until someone dials the stargate and the System Lord Apophis and two Jaffa warriors unexpectedly enter the Cheyenne Mountain complex; they kidnap a poor USAF officer and quickly retreat, suggesting there's a much bigger threat in the galaxy than was first perceived. Col. O'Neill is brought out of retirement to lead a new expedition back to Abydos to find an old friend — Dr. Jackson, a new enemy — the Goa'uld and 214 glorious episodes of Naquadah-fuelled action and adventure.\n\nWhy you should watch: This is one of the best, long-running sci-fi shows ever produced for television with an impressive 214 episodes (\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" only managed 176) plus two spin-offs, each with characters that you quickly become invested in, great plots, comedy, drama and well-written dialogue. All of which results in all-round, high-quality sci-fi entertainment. In all honesty, you should watch this to enhance your enjoyment of \"Stargate Atlantis\" (below) as that was really the peak of this franchise. \"Universe\" too was also exceptional and it took the show in a completely new direction, but it was the success of this show that enabled those two to be made.\n\nFree with Amazon Prime\n\nStargate: Atlantis\n\nSynopsis: Basically, this is a spin-off from the incredibly popular \"Stargate SG1\" and incorporates many of the same characters as it takes place concurrently with the events towards the end of the \"SG1\" series run. More stargate addresses have been found, including some now that are in a completely different galaxy. Upon exploring these, a fantastic city has been discovered at the bottom of an ocean on a planet in our nearest neighboring galaxy. Turns out that it was constructed by the \"ancients\" — the same race who originally built the stargates.\n\nWhy you should watch: If you thought Jack O'Neill was cool, just wait until you meet John Sheppard. Seriously, this guy has a composure that makes test pilots look like anxiety-ridden teenagers. This second spin-off hits the ground running and only gets better. In particular, the developing relations between Sheppard (Joe Flanigan) and his team, Ronin Dex (Jason Momoa, oh yes), Teyla Emmagan (Rachel Luttrell) and of course Dr. Rodney McKay, played by the brilliant David Hewlett. Every season of this sci-fi surpasses that last, until the very end (season 5) when you'll be left wanting more. This is probably the most rewatchable sci-fi ever made for television.\n\nFree with Amazon Prime\n\nStargate Universe\n\nSynopsis: Following a surprise attack on the Alpha Site, a group of soldiers and civilians have little choice but to use a stargate address that incorporates the \"ninth chevron\" taking them to a deserted space cruiser built by the Ancients millions of years ago that itself is billions of light-years away from Earth. With little or no control of the ship, the team encounters new races, new technology and new enemies as the runaway ship travels to the far ends of the universe.\n\nWhy you should watch: \"Battlestar Galactica\" changed sci-fi forever; suddenly dark, gritty and more mature sci-fi was all the rage — it was a renaissance — and the makers of the \"Stargate\" franchise didn't want to be left behind. The result was a new spin-off totally unlike any other \"Stargate\" show and it was brilliant. A totally new situation gave the writers the opportunity to lay the groundwork for some extremely complex and captivating relationships set onboard this ancient spacecraft hurtling through the heavens. The ongoing friction between Dr. Rush (Robert Carlyle) and Col. Young (Louis Ferreira) was just one of many well-written sub plots. Sadly \"Universe\" was cancelled after just two seasons, but it should consider itself up there with some of the best sci-fi TV has given us.\n\nFree with Amazon Prime\n\nTales From the Loop\n\nSynopsis: A small backwater town has a scientific research facility built underneath it, exactly like the Large Hadron Collider at the CERN facility that lies on the Franco-Swiss border near Geneva, Switzerland. But the people of this town experience all kinds of weird events and strange phenomena. Each episode follows one townsperson, or a particular group of townspeople, and their experiences with \"the loop.\"\n\nWhy you should watch: What an incredibly brilliant idea. Why wouldn't a super-accelerated particle smasher designed to uncover the mysteries of the universe not create super-weird events and interdimensional portals?! The premise of this show is quite possibly one of the most simple and effective we've ever seen. Using the existing notion of a sub-atomic research facility, which we're all already familiar with, as a frame for a \"Twilight Zone\"-style, \"X-Files\"-esque, episodic show featuring stories about the \"strange and unexplained\" is genius. In a senseless waste of a genuinely promising idea, this show was tragically never renewed for a second season.\n\nFree with Amazon Prime\n\nUpload\n\nSynopsis: When a computer programmer Nathan Brown (Robbie Amell) dies prematurely, his socialite girlfriend pays the expensive fee to have his consciousness uploaded to the exclusive Lake View resort for the recently deceased. However, depending on what she chooses to accept to pay for, he finds some simple elements of his life are restricted. As Nathan adjusts to digital heaven, he begins to develop feelings for with his customer service representative in the real world, Nora (Andy Allo). She is struggling with the pressures of her job, her dying father who does not want to be uploaded and her own growing feelings for Nathan while slowly coming to believe that Nathan was murdered.\n\nWhy you should watch: \"Upload\" was with a doubt one of the highlights of 2020; creator Greg Daniels (\"Parks and Recreation\" and \"The Office\") did a phenomenal job of creating a believable, dark comedy, set in the very near future, with so many worryingly realistic plot elements. Sadly though, the second season lacks the less-is-more magic that Season 1 had and takes the story into a very different place. That trend continues with the third season...and, much like Netflix's \"Lost in Space\" the show has gradually deteriorated in quality over three seasons, but since we're currently in a sci-fi drought on television, be thankful, even for this.\n\nFree with Amazon Prime\n\nSo there you have it!
