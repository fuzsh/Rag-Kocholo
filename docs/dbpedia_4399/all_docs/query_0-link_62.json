        "text": "PARIS (AP) — The mystery French street artist known only as “Invader” has struck Paris again — this time to celebrate the Olympics.\n\nInvader has been cementing his quirky mosaics to Paris walls since the 1990s, usually at night and without permission. He’s become France’s most international, invasive and intriguing contemporary street artist. His works dot all corners of the City of Light and his fans have a lot of fun hunting them down.\n\nAnd now there’s a new, Olympic-themed one for them to find.\n\nInvader cemented it to a wall on one of the River Seine’s embankments sometime between Tuesday and Wednesday. Using tiles to create the mosaic, it shows one of his signature Space Invader figures running. The work’s colors evoke the shades of blue that Paris Games organizers have used to decorate the city for the Olympics.\n\nA representative for artist — who, like him, maintains anonymity — said by email to The Associated Press that “Invader told me to say that he wanted to celebrate the Olympics in Paris with this mosaic. The space invader is running and he wears some of the colors of the Olympics signage.”\n\nThe artist’s admirers can download his app, called “Flash Invaders,” and then use it to take photos of any of his works that they find.\n\nWhen they do, the app awards them points. The more works they find and “flash,” the more points they get.\n\nIt’s addictive: The app has nearly 400,000 players.\n\nThe new mosaic is the 1,512th that Invader has glued up in Paris. Players get 50 points when they flash it with his app. Since the first catalogued mosaic of a blue Space Invader went up on a Paris street in 1998, numbered PA_01, Invader has colonized the world. There are now more than 4,000 of his mosaics in cities and towns on all continents except Antartica.\n\nOn Instagram, the artist posted a photo Wednesday of the new work and the words “Special Olympic Games Paris 2024,” with a jogger running past.\n\nThat and a video post by the artist alerted admirers that there was a new work for them to find.\n\nA small group of them quickly tracked it down, took its photo with the app, got their points, and spent time together admiring the work.\n\nSuper fan André Lavigne, a 64-year-old retired chemical engineer, was among the first to find and flash it. He is currently ranked in the top 100 players on the app, having tracked down 2,718 of the artist’s works in France and overseas.\n\nIn just the first few hours, the work was already generated buzz.\n\n“I’ve seen many people coming and flashing and asking, ‘It’s a new one?’ And I say, ‘Yes, it has been put (up) last night.’ (They reply) ‘Oh, well, that’s extraordinary,” Lavigne said.\n\nAnother admirer, Gema Calero, rolled up on her bike and celebrated with a fist pump when she got her 50 points.\n\n“It’s all fresh, it still smells of glue,” she said.\n\nShe says searching high and low across Paris for the works has taught her lots about the city and the value of looking around.\n\n“It allows you to look at life differently. You hunt around. You look up a little bit. Because normally when we walk we look at what’s in front of us,” she said. “It’s super.”\n\nLike Banksy, the British street artist he is sometimes likened to, Invader is elusive, fiercely protective of his anonymity and operating on the margins of illegality. He comes, glues, and disappears into the night, leaving behind his signature pixelated mosaics made mostly with small ceramic and glass tiles.\n\nMost resemble the aliens from the Space Invaders arcade game. Others are wonderfully elaborate, such as still lives of fruit or, in New York, portraits of Lou Reed and Andy Warhol. Some reference pop culture — Spiderman, Star Wars, Bugs Bunny, Ninja Turtles, pizza and the like.\n\n___\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.
