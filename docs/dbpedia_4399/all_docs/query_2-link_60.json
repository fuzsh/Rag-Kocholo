        "text": "How often do you think about the Roman empire? That was the question posed by a highly popular TikTok trend from last year. Women the world over were surprised to find out that, for many men, the answer is “every day”, or at least “several times a week”.\n\nA resulting social media frenzy led to wide range of commentary and op-ed pieces speculating about why this is the case.\n\nIrrespective of how often you personally think of Rome, its influence in the modern world is undeniable – and we need only look at our televisions to prove this.\n\nStorytellers have long embraced the ancient Roman world as a vessel to explore a variety of themes. Amazon Prime’s recent series Those About to Die is just the latest example. Meanwhile, cinephiles and fans of the genre are waiting to see whether Ridley Scott can recapture the magic of the Oscar-winning film Gladiator (2000) in its forthcoming sequel.\n\nThese new and upcoming productions provide the perfect opportunity to reexamine the many stories of ancient Rome that have graced our screens through the decades.\n\nThe most recent ten-episode Roman historical epic is based on Daniel P. Mannix’s 1958 novel of the same name (and which helped inspire the screenplay for Gladiator).\n\nThe series focuses on the power struggles in Imperial Rome at the time of the construction of the Flavian amphitheatre (the Colosseum) under the ailing emperor Vespasian (Anthony Hopkins) and his competing sons Titus (Tom Hughes) and Domitian (Jojo Macari).\n\nThe story is backdropped by corruption, represented by a cast of characters from lowly bookmakers through to the powerful families of the Senate who finance competing chariot-racing factions for popular support.\n\nAs viewers, we expect a degree of intrigue and corruption in Imperial Roman stories – something akin to “Succession in togas, or at least Suits in sandals” as one critic writes.\n\nThose About To Die doesn’t fail to deliver on the drama. With a reputed budget of more than US$140 million, this lavish production is filled with spectacular chariot races and arena fights.\n\nIts large cast, pacing and interweaving subplots are reminiscent of similar epics such as Game of Thrones. And despite relatively lacklustre reviews and historical inaccuracies, the show has been green-lit for a second season.\n\nFor television producers, ancient Rome provides the perfect blank canvas: it can represent pagan; decadent and deviant; Christian and honourable; corrupt and overrun; or republican and just.\n\nHollywood’s fascination was already obvious in 20th-century film, particularly from the 1950s onwards, when studios began releasing sweeping historical epics to bring people back into cinemas as television had become the predominant source of entertainment.\n\nYet, in many ways, television proved to be a more natural fit for stories set in ancient Rome.\n\nMany of the modern productions we know are based on just three bestselling 19th-century novels set in ancient Rome: Edward Bulwer-Lytton’s 1834 novel The Last Days of Pompeii, Henryk Sienkiewicz’s 1896 novel Quo Vadis, and Lew Wallace’s 1880 novel Ben Hur.\n\nEach novel is highly detailed, which is why series and miniseries adaptations – such as the 1984 miniseries The Last Days of Pompeii and the 2010 series Ben-Hur – allow for better plot development compared with the various film adaptations."
