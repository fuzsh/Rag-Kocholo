        "text": "James Paxton (Texas Rising) and Gil Bellows (Ascension) have booked lead roles alongside Julianne Nicholson and Tyler Young in USA Network’s 10-episode straight-to-series drama Eyewitness. In addition, Tattiawna Jones (19-2, Strange Empire) joins previously announced Matt Murray in a recurring role.\n\nThe project, an adaptation of the Norwegian crime thriller Øyevitne, explores a grisly crime from the point of view of the eyewitnesses. In it, two innocent teenage boys — one of them played by Tyler Young — secretly meet up in the forest where they witness a shooting and barely escape with their lives. Desperate to keep their relationship a secret and in fear of being found by the perpetrator, they remain silent but soon learn that what has been seen cannot be unseen and when you witness a horrible event it changes everything, forever.\n\nPaxton will play Lukas Hallenbeck, a young teenaged boy who seems to have it all – popularity, motocross stardom, and the hottest girl in school. But beneath the surface, he’s deeply conflicted about his sexuality. When he meets Philip (Young) – a classmate who’s more comfortable in his skin – Lukas starts a journey towards self-acceptance that is interrupted when the boys witness a quadruple murder. Bellows is Gabe, a small-town veterinarian whose decency, integrity and compassion rescued Sheriff Helen Torrance (Nicholson) from her self-destructive cycle of living. But the pressures of fostering Philip (Young) amidst Helen’s shocking homicide case threaten to tear the marriage apart. Jones will play Kamilah, an unapologetic FBI agent who suddenly finds her loyalty to her job and troubled sister at odds.When Kamilah’s own case intersects with Sheriff Helen Torrance’s, they forge a friendship that leads her to question everything she thought she wanted.\n\nPaxton, son of actor Bill Paxton, most recently starred alongside Vince Vaughn in Term Life and appeared in Texas Rising. He’s repped by UTA and Authentic. Bellows co-created, executive produced and appears in Patriot and also recurred on Ascension. He’s repped by Luber Roklin Entertainment, Don Buchwald & Associates, and Jackoway Tyerman. Jones is repped by APA and Carrier Talent Management.\n\nUniversal Cable Productions is the producer. Shades Of Blue creator Adi Hasak wrote the series and will serve as executive producer/showrunner. The series’ original creator Jarl Emsell Larsen and Scott Peters also executive produce."
