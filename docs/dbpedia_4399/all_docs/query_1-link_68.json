        "text": "Last night's episode of The Good Wife on CBS focused on a problem we know a lot about in Dallas County.\n\nThe legal drama honed in on errors in eyewitness identification as the reason for a wrongful conviction. In the episode, a man who killed a police officer wore a Chicago Bulls sweatshirt. When police showed a photo lineup to witness, there was only one person in the six pictures wearing a Chicago Bulls sweatshirt. Guess who she picked out? Yep, the man in the Bulls shirt. This is similar to one of the cases in Dallas County overturned by DNA evidence. In the Dallas County case, Wiley Fountain was picked out of a lineup when he was the only one wearing a light-colored warm up suit and a dark baseball cap. more The rape occurred in 1986 and DNA testing proved his innocence in 2002. A 2008 investigation by The Dallas Morning News found that wrongful eyewitness testimony contributed to all but one of the wrongful convictions overturned by DNA evidence. Twenty men have been proven innocent in Dallas County through DNA testing."
