        "text": "Post updated March 31st and April 2nd. See updates below.\n\nOne of my favorite shows sails onto Netflix today. The historical drama Vikings will invade the streaming giant for the first time Saturday, ready to pillage and burn its way onto your TV screen. You should watch it.\n\nI reviewed this series for years, and while it does go downhill (and has a bit of a bumpy start) it remains one of my all-time favorites. When it was at its peak, it was a truly excellent story of family, betrayal, war and politicking. I was watching it at the same time as Game Of Thrones, and at times thought Vikings was even better than HBO’s epic fantasy.\n\nVikings began its life on the History channel before moving to Amazon Prime Video. Now it’s on Netflix, and will hopefully gain even more of a following. I started reviewing this series in Season 3. I may need to do a rewatch and review the first two seasons as well—time permitting, of course.\n\nThe story follows Ragnar Lothbrok, played by Travis Fimmel in a career-defining role. I get the feeling that Fimmel inhabited Ragnar so completely that he was never quite the same afterwards. Ragnar is a warrior and a dreamer. He wants to sail West and find new lands to settle (and invade). There are many obstacles in his path, including Earl Haraldson (played by a badly miscast Gabriel Byrne—the one real casting SNAFU in the series).\n\nRagnar and his wife, Lagertha—played wonderfully by Katheryn Winnick—have a daughter, Gyda (Ruby O'Leary) and a son, Bjorn (played by Alexander Ludwig when he grows up). Ragnar’s brother, Rollo (Clive Standen) is at once a stalwart companion and somewhat jealous of the long shadow Ragnar casts. They’re joined by Floki (Gustaf Skarsgard), a mischievous ship-builder and his wife Helga (Maude Hirst) and her IRL sister Torvi (Georgia Hirst, both daughters of the showrunner). Along the way, many more characters enter—and exit—the series, including the delightful King Ecbert (Linus Roache) one of the Saxon rulers the vikings have to contend with.\n\nI don’t want to spoil more than that. It’s a tremendous series filled with incredible stories and characters, epic battles and plenty of deceit. It takes many, many liberties with historical accuracy, condensing some Norse history into a shorter timeline, but it’s all done so incredibly well that I never minded. The series does go downhill significantly toward the end, but I still watched it all the way through and I’m glad I did. The series finale, at least, was quite good. Don’t let that warning keep you away from Vikings, however. It’s definitely worth your time.\n\nNetflix created the sequel series Vikings: Valhalla which debuted back in 2022. I admit, the first episode did not impress me and I didn’t come back. I suppose I might have been a tad bit burnt out on Viking stuff at that point. I may have to give it another shot. But while critics seemed to like it, fans were much more divided. The historical inaccuracies were even more glaring (there were no black female jarls in 11th century Scandinavia; the original show managed to include some diversity without outright fabricating this kind of thing) and I personally found all the toasting to Ragnar and Lagertha and other characters a century dead to be kind of silly.\n\nGone, too, was the writer and showrunner, Michael Hirst, who I may not always have agreed with—and who I wish would have made better choices!—but who gave the series its very distinct feel.\n\nA Netflix show about vikings and saxons was The Last Kingdom, which had its flaws but was really quite good—other than the terrible sequel film that should never, ever have been made.\n\nHere’s the trailer for Season 1 of Vikings:\n\nCheck out everything else new to stream this weekend in my latest streaming guide.\n\nUpdate #1 — Norsemen\n\nSince this post blew up for some reason—hopefully turning a bunch of people onto Vikings in the process!—I thought I’d add another recommendation to your Netflix watchlist.\n\nNorsemen is another show about vikings, but unlike Vikings or The Last Kingdom, it’s actually hilarious. It’s genuinely one of the funniest shows on Netflix, and not nearly enough people know about it.\n\nBefore we go further, be warned: Netflix cancelled the show after Season 3 back in 2020. The pandemic was one reason. Netflix cancelled a lot of good shows in the Bad Days, including GLOW, and the wonderful The Dark Crystal: Age Of Resistance, which was also axed in September of 2020. (I’m still so sad about all of these).\n\nThe third season is actually referred to as Season 0 since it’s a prequel to the first two seasons. The show’s creators realized they were including so many flashback sequences that they might as well just do them as a prequel instead. This was quite clever and worked surprisingly well, but it had the unfortunate consequence of leaving us with a cliffhanger ending.\n\nI don’t think you should be dissuaded from watching Norsemen, however, despite the cancellation. It has so many funny moments, really great characters and it’s just a wonderful parody of historical shows like Vikings.\n\nThe series—known as Vikingane in Norway—was created by Jon Iver Helgaker and Jonas Torgersen and follows the exploits and misadventures of a group of vikings and one very arrogant Roman actor they’ve enslaved in the late 8th century. While it doesn’t have the “mockumentary” stuff, it reminds me a lot of The Office but with vikings instead of paper salespeople.\n\nOne of the best things about the series is that it features all Norwegian actors and they film every scene twice—once in Norwegian and once in English. It certainly makes everyone’s accents very authentic! And it’s nice to be able to watch in English (though you might still benefit from subtitles, as some characters do have much thicker accents than others).\n\nIn any case, it’s a terrific show. I’m sad it’s gone. Anyone who’s a fan of Vikings should get a kick out of Norsemen. I hope you enjoy it!\n\nHere’s a trailer:\n\nUpdate #2 — The Northman\n\nI’ve been asked by readers to come up with viking film suggestions as well as TV show suggestions, and while I think I’ll put together a Big List of movies and shows at some point, for now I want to point you toward one of my favorite films of 2022.\n\nThe Northman actually released in theaters almost exactly two years ago, and while I had a quibble or two, I was mostly enthralled. In my review of the film—titled The Northman Review: Heavy Metal Viking Berserker Rage At Its Finest—I wrote:\n\n[The Northman] is a visually stunning, breathlessly violent, bone-crushingly metal take on Viking legend. It is also the story of Shakespeare’s Hamlet, as told by director [Robert] Eggers and writer Sigurjón Birgir Sigurðsson—aka Sjón. Only in this Hamlet the main character is named Amleth, which is just ‘Hamlet’ with the ‘H’ on the end instead of the beginning.\n\nWe all know Hamlet, but I’ll throw in a spoiler warning here anyways. In Hamlet and in The Northman, a young Norse prince seeks to avenge his father who was slain by none other than his uncle. He vows to rescue his mother and take back his kingdom. Soon, he is entirely consumed by his hatred and revenge. It does not end well for anybody (though, miraculously, The Northman is just a little less bleak than Hamlet in the end).\n\nOf course, that’s not quite the case. Hamlet is actually Amleth with an H at the beginning, as the old Norse legend inspired Shakespeare’s famous play. The two follow very similar beats in terms of murder and betrayal and revenge, but The Northman is set hundreds of years earlier and Amleth is a brutal viking warrior played by the towering Alexander Skarsgård. Both versions of this story include subtle magic—a ghost in Hamlet; I won’t spoil the magic found in The Northman.\n\nHere’s the trailer:\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the critical reviews for this film were quite a bit higher than audience scores. 90% of critics liked the picture, while only 64% of audiences gave it a thumbs up.\n\nIn my review, I likened this gap to the critic/audience gap for The Green Knight:\n\nI double checked The Green Knight’s Rotten Tomatoes rating—the two films are quite different but share a focus on brooding cinematography, sparse dialogue and magical realism bordering on fantasy—and it faced much the same fate. 89% of critics liked the movie; just 50% of moviegoers agreed.\n\nI mention all this simply to note that this is a movie that is, almost by design, divisive and one that isn’t trying to please as wide a swath of viewers as possible. Even for fans of Viking stories and TV shows (think Vikings, The Last Kingdom) this movie might be too dark, too weird or too fantastical, too disturbing. But as far as I’m concerned, The Northman simply takes everything to the next level.\n\nThis is my way of saying that while I very much enjoyed The Northman and Eggers’ approach to this familiar story, it is very weird and very violent and I can understand why moviegoers, perhaps expecting something a little less grimdark, or just a little less odd, might give it a low rating. I often write about how the critics must be crazy for hating stuff that I really enjoy. This time, I think audiences are in the wrong—especially all the comments I’ve seen about it being “boring.” It’s a lot of things, but boring isn’t one of them. Sometimes, a slower-paced film works, bringing that cauldron of dread to a boil. Then again, there’s no accounting for taste! I think it earned its 2 hours and 17 minute runtime, which isn’t even particularly long by today’s standards, especially for an epic historical drama.\n\nYou can currently watch The Northman on Starz."
