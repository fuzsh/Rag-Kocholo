        "text": "Transcript\n\n[Music in]\n\nGEORGE FENNEMAN: Groucho Marx, in \"You Bet Your Life.\"\n\nCHORUS:\n\nGroucho sent me to see the new De Soto.\n\nGroucho sent me, and I love to drive this car.\n\nIt's long and low and roomier,\n\nSo handsome you can see.\n\nIt's powerful, and I'm so glad that Groucho sent me.\n\nListen to him when you hear Groucho say,\n\n\"So drive the new De Soto at De Soto/Plymouth dealers today.\"\n\n[Applause/music out]\n\nGROUCHO: Here I am, again with $2,000 for one of our couples. And they need to say the secret word, this moth-eaten duck will fly down and pay 'em a $100. The word tonight is food. Scram [laughter]. Arrivederci. George, proceed.\n\nGEORGE: Well, Groucho, we have a couple of young, single people for you tonight, and their names are Miss Barbara Schmidt and Mr. Mario DaRe. So, will you come in, please, folks and meet Groucho Marx.\n\nGROUCHO: Welcome, welcome to the De Soto/Plymouth dealers [laughter]. Say the secret word and you'll divide $100. It's a common word, something you find around the house. Barbara Schmidt and Mario do re mi . . . Which one is Barbara?\n\nBARBARA: I am.\n\nGROUCHO: You're Barbara. That's about the silliest question, I guess, I've ever asked on this show. How old are you, Barbara?\n\nBARBARA: I'm 18.\n\nGROUCHO: Eighteen, huh? A lovely age for a girl. In fact, it's the lovely age for a woman of 40 [laughter]. You're not married, are you, Barbara?\n\nBARBARA: No, I'm not.\n\nGROUCHO: You're not, huh? Are you engaged?\n\nBARBARA: No.\n\nGROUCHO: Completely free agent?\n\nBARBARA: I'm completely unattached.\n\nGROUCHO: Is that so? You mean your zipper's broken [laughter]? Well, something's holding you together, and I--I wish it was me [laughter]. Where're you from originally, heaven?\n\nBARBARA: Originally, I'm from Albany, New York.\n\nGROUCHO: Albany, uh?\n\nBARBARA: Yes. Now I live in Pasadena.\n\nGROUCHO: Oh. Well, tell me, do you go to school or do you have a job or are you self-sustaining, self-supporting, or what?\n\nBARBARA: No. I go to school. I go to UCLA, and I'm majoring in English.\n\nGROUCHO: Hm. Well, that's pretty good. Do you speak it at all [laughter]? Why did you come to California to learn English? Don't they speak English in Albany?\n\nBARBARA: Yes. Well, I prefer the climate here in California.\n\nGROUCHO: Oh. You're Mario. Is that your name?\n\nMARIO: Mario.\n\nGROUCHO: Mario, you're not Mario Lanza, are you?\n\nMARIO: No. I'm Mario DaRe.\n\nGROUCHO: Are you related to Mario Lanza?\n\nMARIO: No. But Aldo Ray's my brother.\n\nGROUCHO: He's related to Mario Lanza?\n\nMARIO: No, he's my brother.\n\nGROUCHO: Your brother is Aldo Ray? Oh, congratulations, you're very lucky [applause]. Now, then, who is Aldo Ray?\n\n[Laughter]\n\nMARIO: He's a movie star.\n\nGROUCHO: He's a movie star? A movie star.\n\nMARIO: Yes.\n\nGROUCHO: The only movie star I know is Francis X. Bushman [laughter]. You're a pretty big brute, Mario, aren't you?\n\nMARIO: I'm big, yeah.\n\nGROUCHO: Yeah. I'm surprised you don't play football. Why is that?\n\nMARIO: I do play football. I play for the University of Southern California. I play with the [applause]. . .\n\nGROUCHO: You play with USC? That's just what I said: I'm surprised you don't play football [laughter]. You hate USC, Barbara?\n\nBARBARA: I don't hate it.\n\nGROUCHO: No?\n\nBARBARA: But I'm for UCLA.\n\nGROUCHO: So am I. Well, only in the last five minutes [laughter]. Up till now I was a fan of Rutgers [laughter]. Barbara, I imagine life must be interesting for a pretty girl in college. I've never been a pretty girl in college, but I'm only guessing. Well, I wasn't even a pretty girl in high school [laughter]. Is anything exciting ever happen to you, Barbara?\n\nBARBARA: The most exciting thing that ever happened to me was I was chosen the 1954 Rose Queen, Pasadena.\n\nGROUCHO: Oh, you were Queen of the Roses, eh [applause]? That's a very high honor. Congratulations, Barbara.\n\nBARBARA: Thank you.\n\nGROUCHO: Pretty tough competition?\n\nBARBARA: Yes, there was quite a bit.\n\nGROUCHO: Well, enough. Let's get down to brass tacks. We've got enough of this historical stuff. Mario, will you marry this girl?\n\nMARIO: No, I can't.\n\nGROUCHO: You can't?\n\nMARIO: I'm going steady right now.\n\n[Laughter]\n\nGROUCHO: Well, call her up and tell her you're gonna marry Barbara. She'll understand. Women are very understanding that way [laughter]. Say, your girl must be quite a dish, Mario, if you'll turn down the Rose queen for her. How did you meet your inamorata?\n\nMARIO: Well, I met her about two years ago at a dance and I liked her. So a couple of weeks later I asked her out, and that's it. We've been going out ever since.\n\nGROUCHO: You were so crazy about her, why did you wait two weeks? Were you saving up a dime for the phone?\n\nMARIO: No, I was busy doing other things.\n\n[Laughter]\n\nGROUCHO: Other things? My boy, take it from an old hand in these matters, there are no other things [laughter]. Where is this dazzler? Is she--she out front here?\n\nMARIO: No, she's in Pinole, California. That's about 400 miles north of L.A.\n\nGROUCHO: She's 400 miles from here?\n\nMARIO: Yeah. She's a secretary for a district attorney up there.\n\nGROUCHO: Oh, that's bad [laughter]. You mean your girl is 400 miles away, and you turn down a date with probably the most beautiful girl in America, who's standing right next to you?\n\nMARIO: I have to, I guess [laughter]. No choice.\n\nGROUCHO: Yeah, that's like living in Las Vegas and going all the way to Cedar Rapids just to play bingo in a church bazaar [laughter]. Well, you're--you're an attractive couple, and Mario, if you were smart, you'd marry this girl as soon as she can support you. I forgot to ask you one question: do you have a fella?\n\nBARBARA: No.\n\nGROUCHO: Or did I ask you?\n\nBARBARA: No, you didn't.\n\nGROUCHO: Why not?\n\nBARBARA: Well, I have many fellows.\n\nGROUCHO: Oh--oh, I see. All right, let's play \"You Bet Your Life\" [laughter]. I had a fella who wanted to meet you. It was me [laughter]. You both know the rules of this swindle--this game?\n\nBARBARA: Yes.\n\nGROUCHO: You selected the musical category. These are all top tunes of the last 20 years. Hey, Fenneman, just keep looking right here. Ok, now what do you start with? Ten, 20, or all the way to a 100?\n\nBARBARA: Fifty.\n\nGROUCHO: Fifty?\n\nMARIO: Seventy, make it 70.\n\nGROUCHY: Seventy?\n\nBARBARA: Seventy.\n\nMARIO: Seventy.\n\nGROUCHO: Ok, this song is from the score of the musical \"Knickerbocker Holiday.\" Now you give me the title.\n\n[Music]\n\nMARIO: \"September Song\"? \"September Song.\" \"September Song.\"\n\nGROUCHO: \"September Song\" is absolutely right.\n\n[Applause]\n\nGEORGE: And you're off to a good start. You have $170.\n\nGROUCHO: Now, what are you gonna take a swing at?\n\nMARIO: Should we go with 75 or 80 or . . . 80? We'll go 80.\n\nBARBARA: Eighty.\n\nGROUCHO: Eighty dollars. Sammy Cahn and Jule Styne wrote this song about 10 years ago. What's the name of it? Play it.\n\n[Music]\n\nMARIO: \"Let It Snow, Let It Snow.\" Is that right? \"Let It Snow, Let It Snow.\" Is that right? \"Let It Snow, Let It Snow.\"\n\nGROUCHO: That's right. \"Let It Snow\" is right.\n\n[Applause]\n\nGEORGE: You now have $250.\n\nGROUCHO: What're ya gonna go for now?\n\nMARIO: Ninety? We'll go for 90.\n\nGROUCHO: Ninety. This song was a big hit a few years ago. Let's see if you can identify it.\n\n[Music]\n\nMARIO: \"Wish You Were Here.\" \"Wish You Were Here.\"\n\nGROUCHO: \"Wish You Were Here\" is right.\n\n[Applause]\n\nGEORGE: You now have $340.\n\nGROUCHO: Last chance to beat the other couples. What're ya gonna go for?\n\nMARIO: You wanna go a 100? We'll go $100.\n\nGROUCHO: One hundred dollars. This song was written by Rodgers and Hammerstein. What is the title of it? Play it, Jack.\n\n[Music]\n\nMARIO: \"Hello Young Lovers\"? Is that right? \"Hello Young Lovers.\"\n\nGROUCHO: That's right. Now, give him a big kiss.\n\nBARBARA: Oh!\n\n[Applause]\n\nGEORGE: And you wind up with $440.\n\nGROUCHO: There goes that girl in the district attorney and everything else [laughter]. Thank you and good luck from the De Soto/Plymouth dealers.\n\n[Music in/applause]\n\nCHORUS:\n\nGroucho sent me to see the new De Soto.\n\nGroucho sent us, and we want to drive this car.\n\nOh, what a thrill you're going to feel when you're behind the wheel.\n\nDe Soto is the smartest car, smartest of the smart cars.\n\nIt's so stylish, and now as Groucho says,\n\n\"Let's drive the new De Soto at De Soto/Plymouth dealers today.\"\n\nGEORGE: From every angle--from here, from here, or from here--De Soto is smart. De Soto is the car that makes people stop and look. The car you'll be proud to have standing in front of your house. It's smart to own the \"Smartest of the Smart\" cars. Here is De Soto's smart double cockpit instrument panel with a new flight control lever, convenient but out of your way because it's used so seldom. And outside, accenting the forward look, is the dramatic splash of color we call a color sweep. It's beautiful styling like this that makes the new De Soto the \"Smartest of the Smart\" cars. Drive a De Soto before you decide.\n\nCHORUS: Go drive the new De Soto at De Soto/Plymouth dealers today.\n\n[Music out]\n\nGEORGE: Groucho we have a man with an unusual occupation for you. He's Mr. Verne Lucius Cameron. His partner is a housewife. She is Mrs. Mariana Ehrlich. So folks, you come in, please, and meet Groucho Marx.\n\nGROUCHO: Welcome to \"You Bet Your Life.\" Say the secret word and divide a $100. It's a common word, something you find around the house. Mrs. Mariana Ehrlich and Mr. Verne Lucius Cameron, a couple of pretty fancy monikers there. Mariana, where are you from?\n\nMARIANA: I'm originally from Czechoslovakia, and I came of a friend in Portugal to the United States.\n\nGROUCHO: You came with a friend from Portugal to the United States?\n\nMARIANA: I came with my best friend, my husband.\n\nGROUCHO: Your best friend is your husband?\n\nMARIANA: Uh ha.\n\nGROUCHO: Well that may be true in Czechoslovakia, but [laughter] . . . Where abouts behind the Iron Curtain did you come from?\n\nMARIANA: Prague, Czechoslovakia.\n\nGROUCHO: Prague, huh? You were poor but Prague at the time? Could you give us some idea of your age, Mariana?\n\nMARIANA: I'd rather skip that question.\n\nGROUCHO: You'd rather skip it? Well, skip around here and then give us your age.\n\n[Laughter]\n\nMARIANA: I heard once [unintelligible] that a girl who tells her age is liable to tell anything.\n\n[Laughter]\n\nGROUCHO: Well, I expect to worm many other things out of you before we're through with you. You're Jules Verne Lucius Cameron, huh?\n\nVERNE: I was named after Jules Verne.\n\nGROUCHO: Is that right?\n\nVERNE: He was named first, and I was named after him.\n\nGROUCHO: Yeah, that's a good thing. Where you from, Verne?\n\nVERNE: I was born in Sioux City, Iowa, and . . .\n\nGROUCHO: Oh, that's where all the lawyers come from, isn't it?\n\nVERNE: Is it? I didn't know that.\n\nGROUCHO: Well, it's Sioux City. I imagined that's where they probably . . .\n\nVERNE: Oh, I see [laughter]. Well, I spent three years in Iowa, three years in Kansas, and then spent most of my boyhood in Oklahoma.\n\nGROUCHO: What sort of work do you do?\n\nVERNE: Groucho, I'm a hydrologist.\n\nGROUCHO: You mean you eat only vegetables? What's a hydrologist?\n\nVERNE: A hydrologist is a man who locates--or a woman--who locates underground liquids, oil or water.\n\nGROUCHO: You mean like a bootlegger?\n\n[Laughter]\n\nVERNE: Yes, if they're underground.\n\nGROUCHO: Well, how do ya--how do ya go about finding water?\n\nVERNE: Well, I have instruments that I've developed over a period of 32 years of locating--locating wells.\n\nGROUCHO: Well, what makes this thing work?\n\nVERNE: It takes on a charge from the electrical aura around the body, and this positive charge causes it to become attracted to the negative charge, coming up by reflection from underground water.\n\nGROUCHO: Well, you lost me quite some time ago [laughter]. Have you ever found any wells for people?\n\nVERNE: Yes, sir, I've located thousands of them. I don't know how many thousands.\n\nGROUCHO: Well, how much do you charge for finding water? A cent a gallon?\n\nVERNE: Well, the price ranges from 25 to 100 dollars per well or $100 a day flat rate.\n\nGROUCHO: A $100 a day?\n\nVERNE: Yes, sir.\n\nGROUCHO: You must be finding water because you're certainly soaking somebody [laughter]. I'd like to go on talking to you two, but the time has come to play \"You Bet Your Life.\"\n\nGEORGE: In the race for the $2,000, the first couple won $440. And the secret word is food.\n\nGROUCHO: I'm sure you're familiar with this game. I don't have to explain it to you.\n\nVERNE: Yes, sir.\n\nGROUCHO: This is a spelling quiz. This is an old-fashioned spelling bee. You get only one chance at the correct spelling and only one answer between you. I want you to spell the word and then pronounce it. Is that clear?\n\nVERNE: Yes, sir.\n\nGROUCHO: Spell it, then pronounce it. All right. What do you start with, 10, 20, 50, all the way to a 100?\n\nMARIANA: Seventy?\n\nVERNE: Seventy suits me.\n\nGROUCHO: Seventy suits me, too. All right, spell the word lieutenant, meaning an officer in military service.\n\nMARIANA: L-i-e-u-t-e-n-a-n-t.\n\nVERNE: All right.\n\nGROUCHO: This kid's from Czechoslovakia . . .\n\n[Music/applause]\n\nGEORGE: You now have $170.\n\nGROUCHO: What're ya gonna go for?\n\nMARIANA: Eighty. Eighty with you? Ok?\n\nVERNE: Fine. Sure.\n\nGROUCHO: Spell the word aluminum, meaning a light silver-white metal--metal.\n\nMARIANA: A-l-u-m-i-n . . . one moment. Aluminum, l--a-l-u-m-i-n-u-m.\n\nVERNE: That's fine.\n\nGROUCHO: Right.\n\n[Applause]\n\nGEORGE: You now have $250.\n\nGROUCHO: You went to night school, huh?\n\nMARIANA: I did. I went to night school.\n\nGROUCHO: And day school, I think.\n\nMARIANA: I know how to spell, but I don't pronounce.\n\nGROUCHO: Well, spell the word fictitious, meaning not real, counterfeit, not genuine.\n\nMARIANA: f-i-c\n\nVERNE/MARIANA: t-i-t\n\nMARIANA: o-u-s\n\nVERNE: No, i-o-u-s--f-i-c-t-i-t-i-o-u-s.\n\nMARIANA: F-i-c-t-i-t-o-u-s.\n\nVERNE: No, i-o-u-s.\n\nGROUCHO: All right, decide one answer between you now. What are you going to say?\n\nVERNE: It's i-o-u-s for sure.\n\nMARIANA: Are you sure?\n\nVERNE: Um hum.\n\nGROUCHO: All right, then you spell it.\n\nVERNE: F-i-c-t-i-t-i-o-u-s, fictitious.\n\nGROUCHO: That's right. That's right.\n\n[Applause]\n\nGEORGE: You now have $320.\n\nGROUCHO: Some illiterate in the front row was hollering you were wrong.\n\n[Laughter]\n\nMARIANA: I trust you.\n\nGROUCHO: It's your last chance to beat the other couples. What're ya gonna go for?\n\nMARIANA: Hundred. Hundred ok with you?\n\nVERNE: That's right.\n\nGROUCHO: It's all right with you? All right, spell the word penitentiary, meaning a state or federal prison.\n\nMARIANA: p\n\nMARIANA/VERNE: p-e-n\n\nVERNE: i-t\n\nMARIANA: i\n\nVERNE: t\n\nMARIANA: t\n\nVERNE: i-a-n\n\nMARIANA: No, pen-i-ten-tiary. P-e-n-i\n\nVERNE: No, p. Yes, that is right.\n\nMARIANA/VERNE: P-e-n-i-t-e-n\n\nGROUCHO: All right, come on now.\n\nMARIANA/VERNE: t-i-a-r-y, that's right.\n\nGROUCHO: Now, spell it. One of you spell it.\n\nVERNE: P-e-n-i-t-e-n-t-i-a-r-y.\n\nGROUCHO: That is right.\n\n[Music/applause]\n\nGEORGE: And you went all the way. You wind up with $440.\n\nGROUCHO: Well, thanks and good luck from the De Soto/Plymouth dealers.\n\nMARIANA: Thank you so much.\n\n[Music/applause]\n\nGEORGE: Groucho, we invited some girls who work for an aircraft plant to our factory tonight. And just before we went on the air our studio audience selected June French to be on the show. And her partner is Mr. Albert Hall. So, folks, would you come in, please, and meet Groucho Marx.\n\nGROUCHO: Welcome, welcome to the De Soto/Plymouth dealer. Say the secret word and divide a $100. It's a common word, something you find around the house. Mr. Albert Hall and June French. June, how old are you?\n\nJUNE: I'm 21.\n\nGROUCHO: Twenty-one, huh? What's your hometown?\n\nJUNE: Mineola, Texas.\n\nGROUCHO: Mineola, Texas? Is there a town named Mineola?\n\nJUNE: Yes, sir.\n\nGROUCHO: What is that near?\n\nJUNE: Oh, it's about 80 miles east of Dallas.\n\nGROUCHO: Well, how far is that from Neiman Marcus?\n\nJUNE: That is Neiman Marcus?\n\nGROUCHO: Oh. Are you married?\n\nJUNE: Yes.\n\nGROUCHO: You are?\n\nJUNE: Yes.\n\nGROUCHO: You're pretty young to be married, aren't you?\n\nJUNE: I've been married six years.\n\nGROUCHO: You were married when you were 15?\n\nJUNE: Yes.\n\nGROUCHO: Well, they catch them early down there, don't they.\n\nJUNE: No, I caught him early.\n\nGROUCHO: Oh. Well, at least you're honest enough to admit it. Most women are not. Mr. Hall, where are you from?\n\nALBERT: Originally from Kansas. Born in Kansas on a farm.\n\n[Laughter]\n\nGROUCHO: Well, you don't have to be angry about it.\n\n[Laughter]\n\nALBERT: Well, it was kinda tough out there.\n\nGROUCHO: This guy's trying to hypnotize me [laughter]. I'm afraid to ask him any more questions [laughter]. Did you grow up on a farm in Kansas? Did you grow up on a farm back there in Kansas?\n\nALBERT: No, I left when I was 10 years old.\n\nGROUCHO: Uh huh. Your name is Albert Hall?\n\nALBERT: Yes.\n\nGROUCHO: Well, that's in London, isn't it, where the musicians play in the concerts?\n\nALBERT: Oh, yes.\n\nGROUCHO: Did you know that? Were you named after that place?\n\nALBERT: Evidently. I didn't select the name.\n\nGROUCHO: Oh [laughter]. You think I have such a soft job up here, right? Last time I come down here without my blackjack [laughter]. Where did you go when you left the farm?\n\nALBERT: Lincoln, Nebraska.\n\nGROUCHO: What were you doing there?\n\nALBERT: Well, I went to school there. Then I quit school and I got a job on the \"Nebraska State Journal\" as the printer's devil. Just think about it.\n\n[Laughter]\n\nGROUCHO: Will you ask him the next question? You were a printer's devil. Well, why did you get fired? Maybe you weren't the type, huh?\n\nALBERT: I didn't get fired.\n\nGROUCHO: Oh. Al, are you married?\n\nALBERT: Oh, yes.\n\nGROUCHO: How long you've been married, Al?\n\nALBERT: Forty-two years.\n\nGROUCHO: Is your wife out here with you?\n\nALBERT: Yes, she's in the audience.\n\nGROUCHO: Oh. What sort of work you been doing lately?\n\nALBERT: Well, I came to Seattle and I got a job on the \"Seattle Times.\"\n\nGROUCHO: Imagine, if he doesn't win any money here, what's going to happen to me [laughter]? I'm leaving long before that. You say you went to Seattle and you got a job on the paper?\n\nALBERT: \"Seattle Times\" in the composing room.\n\nGROUCHO: I see. And how long were you there?\n\n[Laughter]\n\nALBERT: Ten years.\n\nGROUCHO: Maybe I can out-frighten him, huh [laughter]? Boy, would he fit in all of Dickens's stories, huh [laughter]? Well, June, what kind of work do you do?\n\nJUNE: I'm a messenger . . .\n\nGROUCHO: I feel safer in asking you. You're a messenger? Well, what do you do as a messenger? Do you deliver messages?\n\nJUNE: No, I deliver blueprints and supplies and food, or anything else the engineers want.\n\n[Music/applause]\n\nGROUCHO: You said food, so you and Gargantua each get $50.\n\n[Laughter]\n\nALBERT: Oh boy.\n\nGROUCHO: All right, all right. Beat it, duck. Now, who do you deliver these things to?\n\nJUNE: To the engineers.\n\nGROUCHO: Well, how are you dressed? Do you wear this kind of an outfit?\n\nJUNE: Ah, yes, skirts, blouses, sweaters.\n\nGROUCHO: You know, better to be careful, you know? I know something about engineers. They all have plans of their own, you know [laughter]? Do these engineers . . . Maybe I can charm him. Mr. Hall, I am reluctant to do this, but let's get back to you. What are you doing in Hollywood and who are you frightening? What are you doing here, at present, Mr. Hall?\n\nALBERT: Well, things got tough up in the mountains. No money. I came to Hollywood to find out how they make money.\n\nGROUCHO: Well, how do they make money?\n\nALBERT: I--I walked up and down Hollywood Boulevard, and I come to the conclusion that 50 percent of men're on relief, and then I think the other 40 percent are going around to these banks and loan companies--there's three or four in every block.\n\nGROUCHO: I think ya got something there. Now have you decided on the type of work that you'd like to do in Hollywood? What would you like to do, Al, long as you're out here, now you're not doing anything?\n\nALBERT: Well, what you're doing there looks kind of soft.\n\n[Laughter]\n\nGROUCHO: Well, it is, but I don't want it to get around, that's all . . . I guess the jig is up. Well, Al, the time is up for loose chatter. Now, let's play \"You Bet Your Life.\"\n\nGEORGE: In the race for the $2,000, the first two couples are tied with $440.\n\nGROUCHO: You both understand the rules of the game? Now, you selected geography, and you remember the more the question's worth the harder it is.\n\nALBERT: Whatever you say, all right.\n\nGROUCHO: How much?\n\nALBERT: She says a 100.\n\nGROUCHO: A 100? Ok. What country is separated by 1,000 miles of the Republic of India?\n\nJUNE: Pakistan.\n\nGROUCHO: Pakistan is right.\n\n[Applause]\n\nGEORGE: Well, you're off to a good start. You now have $200.\n\nGROUCHO: Now, just so we--we don't have any confusion, on the next questions, consult before you answer, because he might've said something else and you wouldn't have won the money. All right, what're ya gonna go for now?\n\n[Laughter]\n\nJUNE: Ninety.\n\nALBERT: All right.\n\nGROUCHO: Ninety dollars. Now, one answer. What great river is sacred to the Hindus? It empties into the Bay of Bengal.\n\nJUNE: Ganges.\n\nGROUCHO: Ganges is right.\n\n[Music]\n\nALBERT: She's smart.\n\nGEORGE: You now have $290.\n\nGROUCHO: Hey, you're pretty lucky to have a gal like that.\n\nALBERT: Oh, I've always been lucky all my life, Groucho.\n\nGROUCHO: I'm glad to hear that, Al. Now, what're ya gonna go for?\n\nJUNE: Eighty?\n\nALBERT: Yeah, yeah, that's fine.\n\nJUNE: Eighty.\n\nGROUCHO: The city of Buffalo, New York, is located on which of the Great Lakes?\n\nJUNE: Erie.\n\nGROUCHO: Lake Erie is right.\n\n[Applause]\n\nGROUCHO: What happened to that talk I gave you?\n\nGEORGE: You now have $370.\n\nGROUCHO: All right, what're ya gonna go for?\n\nJUNE: Seventy?\n\nGROUCHO: This is your last chance to beat the other couples.\n\nJUNE: Seventy dollars.\n\nALBERT: Yeah.\n\nGROUCHO: Seventy dollars. What is the largest city in Finland? It is also the capital. Now one answer. Talk it over, please.\n\nALBERT: Helsinki? I don't know.\n\nJUNE: Helsinki?\n\nGROUCHO: That's right. Helsinki is right. Now give him a big kiss.\n\nGEORGE: And you wind up with $440. And that means that all three of our couples tonight . . .\n\nGROUCHO: I get everybody married on this show, if they're married or not, it doesn't make any difference.\n\n[Laughter]\n\nGEORGE: And that means that all three of our couples tonight in just one minute will get the chance at the De Soto/Plymouth $2,000 question. Everybody tied.\n\nGEORGE: Now, I have a question for you. And it's a very important one. Is your car safe to drive? Can you see safely? Can you steer safely? Can you stop safely? Well, if you're not absolutely sure, take your car to your De Soto/Plymouth dealer tomorrow. He'll make certain your car is a safe car. They'll make an expert check of your brakes, tires, headlights, tail lights, steering, and all other important safety features. He'll make sure your car is safe and dependable and tell you if you need any adjustments or repairs. And, if you do, he'll make them quickly and at a reasonable cost. His technicians are specially trained, and they use the very latest equipment and factory-approved methods. They'll make your car a safe car, from headlights, that enable you to see clearly at night, to tail lights, that enable other drivers to see you. Everything that's important to your safety will be put in tip-top condition, and it won't take long. In a short time, your De Soto/Plymouth dealer will make your car a safe car and at a reasonable cost. No matter what make of car you drive visit your De Soto/Plymouth dealer tomorrow. Make sure your car is a safe car.\n\nWell, Groucho, here are the three couples all tied for the De Soto/Plymouth's $2,000 question. We've given them little slips of paper. They'll write down one answer between them. And if they all get it right, we'll split the money among all of them.\n\nGROUCHO: For $2,000, what was the name of the famous English jurist whose commentaries are fundamental in any study of English law?\n\n[Music]\n\nGROUCHO: All right, what are the answers?\n\nGEORGE: Mr. DaRe?\n\nGROUCHO: Barbara Schmidt and Mario DaRe's answer is nothing. June French and Al Hall's answer is nothing. Mariana Ehrlich and Verne Cameron's answer is also nothing. This one's got Hoyle, but that's wrong. It's Sir William Blackstone, a very famous name in the history of jurisprudence. I'm sorry you all lost. That means the big question next week will be worth $2,500. Well, they lost the big money, but they all did pretty well--well in the quiz, didn't they, George?\n\nGEORGE: Yes, all the way.\n\nGROUCHO: How much did they each win?\n\nGEORGE: Each couple won $440.\n\nGROUCHO: Well, congratulations to all of you and to all of our contestants on the show tonight and to both of you and to everybody else.\n\n[Music in]\n\nGROUCHO: Friends, go in to see your De Soto/Plymouth dealer tomorrow. And when you do, tell them Groucho sent you.\n\nGEORGE: Be sure to tune in next week, same time, same station for Groucho Marx in \"You Bet Your Life\" on television, on radio every Wednesday night, and don't miss the big Chrysler Corporation TV show each week on another network.\n\n[Applause]\n\nThis is George Fenneman signing off with a message from the National Safety Council. The month of May has been designated as National Car Safety Check Month. To check accidents, take your car in for a safety check without delay.\n\n[Music out]"
