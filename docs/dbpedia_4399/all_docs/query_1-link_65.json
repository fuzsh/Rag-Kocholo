        "text": "USA Network’s upcoming crime thriller Eyewitness has found its murderous male lead in Chicago Fire actor Warren Christie, TVLine has learned.\n\nAdapted from the Norwegian drama Øyevitne, the series explores a grisly crime from the perspective of those who saw it happen. Christie will co-star as Ryan Kane, who, after committing a series of passion-fueled murders, will do anything possible to escape detection. As he hunts for the two eyewitnesses and attempts to mislead Sheriff Helen Torrance, a sinister game of cat-and-mouse ensues.\n\nChristie — whose TV credits also include Girlfriends’ Guide to Divorce, Motive and Alphas — joins the previously cast Julianne Nicholson, James Paxton, Tyler Young and Gil Bellows.\n\nReady for more of today’s newsy nuggets? Well…\n\n* Someone get Khloe Kardashian a kocktail: FYI Network has cancelled her chatfest, Kocktails with Khloe, after just 14 episodes.\n\n* 90210 alum Trevor Donovan has been cast in Million Dollar Quartet, CMT’s upcoming drama about the birth of rock ‘n’ roll. He’ll play Eddy Arnold, the real-life country music phenomenon who had a profound influence on Elvis.\n\n* Australian actress Bella Heathcote (Neighbours) has joined The Man in the High Castle‘s second season in the series-regular role of Nicole Becker, a young, Berlin-born filmmaker who crosses paths with Luke Kleintank’s Joe.\n\n* Melissa McCarthy will receive the Comedic Genius Award at the 2016 MTV Movie Awards, airing Sunday, April 10, at 8/7c."
