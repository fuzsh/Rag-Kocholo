        "text": "Not every role is a good fit for Julianne Nicholson, but Helen Torrance, the upstate New York sheriff she plays in the USA series “Eyewitness,” is well tailored. Duty bound, methodical and possessing only a nodding acquaintance with humor, Helen is someone you would probably like to know but wouldn’t necessarily want to hang out with. She’s perfect for Ms. Nicholson, an actress who seems to keep everything inside.\n\nMs. Nicholson’s performance is also a good fit for “Eyewitness,” which was created by Adi Hasak (“Shades of Blue”) based on a Norwegian original and begins its 10-episode run on Sunday. An anthology series in which the season tells the story of a crime and its effects on those who witnessed it, the show emphasizes choked emotions and wintry cinematography — the washed-out palette ranges from near black and white to muted, blue-tinged color. Catherine Hardwicke, whose experience in achieving a mood of artful dread includes the first “Twilight” film and an episode of “Low Winter Sun,” was brought on to direct the first two episodes.\n\nRepression quickly surfaces as a theme in the story, as well. The witnesses to a drug-related slaughter are young best friends, Philip (Tyler Young) and Lukas (James Paxton), who realize that they’re more than friends just before the gunfire breaks out. So, terrified of being found by the killer and terrified of coming out, they have two secrets to keep. Staying cool is especially difficult because their cascading emotions — fear, guilt, lust — keep driving them to tear their shirts off and throw each other up against the nearest shed.\n\n“Eyewitness” has more than its share of the formulaic elements of rural crime drama and family soap opera. Helen and Philip are part of the same blended family. Helen and her deputy (he has the sense of humor she lacks) engage in a turf war with the F.B.I."
