The wedding of Prince Ferdinando of Bourbon-Two Sicilies and Chantal de Chevron-Villette

On 16 June 1950, Princess Béatrice Marie Caroline Louise Françoise of Bourbon-Two Sicilies was born at Saint-Raphaël, Var, France. The princess was the first child of Prince Ferdinando of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, Duke of Castro (1926-2008), and Princess Chantal of Bourbon-Two Sicilies (1925-2004; née de Chevron-Villette), who wed in 1949. Béatrice was joined by two younger siblings: Princess Anne (b.1957) and Prince Carlo (b.1963).

During the mid-1970s, Béatrice met the heir of the Bonaparte legacy, Prince Charles Napoléon (b.19 October 1950). The Bourbon princess and the Bonaparte prince fell in love and decided to marry. Charles and Béatrice ruffled the feathers of their respective parents, the Prince and Princess Napoléon as well as the Duke and Duchess of Castro, by contracting a civil marriage on 18 December 1978 in the 5th arrondissement of Paris. The only guests at the wedding were the couple's parents and their witnesses. The couple declined to hold a Roman Catholic ceremony; however, a benediction was held in the strictest intimacy. A reception celebrating the Bonaparte/Bourbon nuptials was hosted by the bride's sister, Princess Anne, then Madame Jacques Chochin. Charles worked for an international bank. Béatrice quit her position in a political secretariat and began a career with an airline company. Aside from their reported mutual passion for politics, the couple also were firm in desiring privacy for themselves and their children. No photographs of Béatrice and Charles together were ever released to the media.
