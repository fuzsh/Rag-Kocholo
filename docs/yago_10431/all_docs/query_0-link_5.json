        "text": "While there is no reigning emperor or king of France today, there are still descendants of the House of Bonaparte: the former imperial and royal European dynasty founded by Napoleon I in 1804, when he transformed the First French Republic into the First French Empire. 37-year-old Jean-Christophe Napoleon Bonaparte is the great-great-great nephew of Napoleon I via the Emperor’s youngest brother, Jérôme, King of Westphalia. Because Napoleon has no legitimate direct descendants, Jean-Christophe is the current disputed head of the Imperial House of France and heir of Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nIntriguingly, Jean-Christophe also has links to the very royal house that his Corsican-born great-great-great uncle helped bring down, as a descendant of King Louis XIV of France, who reigned from 1643 until 1715, via his mother’s side. He is also related to Leopold II of Belgium; William IV, Prince of Orange; Charles III of Spain; Frederick William I of Prussia and George II of Britain via his great-grandmother, Princess Clémentine of Belgium. It is through Clémentine that Jean-Christophe additionally has ties to Louis Philippe I, the last king to officially rule France; and his great-great-grandfather was Prince Napoléon Bonaparte, a cousin of the Emperor Napoleon III (the last monarch of France from the House of Bonaparte, under the Second French Empire).\n\nJean-Christophe became head of the defunct Imperial House of France at the age of just 11 after his grandfather, Louis, Prince Napoléon, a pretender to the Imperial throne of France, said in his will that he wished the succession to bypass his son, Prince Charles Napoléon. The Independent reported in 1997: ‘Louis Napoleon disapproved of the fact that his eldest son had divorced and re-married without his permission. He also detested his political views, which were, by his admission, “republican and democratic”.’ Jean-Christophe’s father was quoted, however, in Nicolas Enache’s 1999 book on the descendants of Marie-Thérèse of Habsburg, that there ‘will never be conflict’ between Charles and his son over the matter.\n\nBorn in the picturesque resort town of Saint-Raphaëla on the Côte d’Azur, Jean-Christophe is the son of Charles Napoléon and his first wife, Princess Béatrice of Bourbon-Two Sicilies (herself tied to a former royal line as daughter of the late Prince Ferdinand of Bourbon, Duke of Castro, a claimant to headship of the defunct Royal House of the Two Sicilies).\n\nFollowing his childhood and education in France, Jean-Christophe undertook an MBA at Harvard Business School from 2015 to 2017. His career to date has included stints as an investment banking analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York, and a private equity associate at Advent International and The Blackstone Group in London, before climbing to become a private equity principal at Blackstone, according to his LinkedIn page. In 2022, he co-founded Leon Capital, a private equity boutique that ‘partners with leading mid-market European tech-enabled services companies’, where he serves as managing partner."
