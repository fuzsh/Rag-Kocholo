        "text": "The royal family lived in what is now 22 (then 21) Regent Terrace in Edinburgh until 1833 when the former king chose to move to Prague as a guest of Marie-Thérèse’s cousin, Emperor Franz I of Austria.\n\nThey moved into luxurious apartments in Prague Castle. Later, the royal family left Prague and moved to the estate of Count Coronini near Gorizia, which was then Austrian but is in Italy today. Marie-Thérèse devotedly nursed her uncle through his last illness in 1836, when he died of cholera.\n\nHer husband Prince Louis Antoine de Bourbon, Duke of Angoulême died in 1844 and was buried next to his father. Marie-Thérèse then moved to Schloss Frohsdorf, a baroque castle just outside Vienna, where she spent her days taking walks, reading, sewing and praying.\n\nHer nephew, Prince Henri de Bourbon, who now styled himself as the Count of Chambord, and his sister, Princess Louise de Bourbon of Artois, wife of Charles III, Duke of Parma; joined Princess Marie-Thérèse there.\n\nIn 1848, King Louis Philippe’s reign ended in a revolution and, for the second time, France became a Republic.\n\nDeath\n\nMarie-Thérèse died of pneumonia on October 19, 1851, three days after the fifty-eighth anniversary of her mother’s execution. She was buried next to her father-in-law, King Charles X, and her husband, Prince Louis Antoine, in the crypt of the Franciscan monastery church of Castagnavizza in Görz, then in Austria, now Kostanjevica in the Slovenian city of Nova Gorica. Marie-Thérèse had remained a devout Roman Catholic.\n\nLater, her nephew Prince Henri, the Count of Chambord, last male member of the senior line of the House of Bourbon; his wife, the Countess of Chambord (formerly the Archduchess Marie-Thérèse of Austria-Este, daughter of Francis IV, Duke of Modena and his wife, Princess Maria Beatrice of Savoy); and the count’s only sister, Louise, Duchess of Parma, were also laid to rest in the crypt in Görz.\n\nThe famous antiquarian the Duke of Blacas was also buried there in honor of his dutiful years of service as a minister to Louis XVIII and Charles X.\n\nMarie-Thérèse is described on her gravestone as the “Queen Dowager of France”, a reference to her husband’s claim as King Louis XIX of France.\n\nOn Sunday 26 March 1854, around 4:00 p.m, Charles left the Riserva Palace to take a walk on the streets of Parma, as he used to do every afternoon. He was accompanied only by an aide-de-camp, Count Bacinetti. During his walk, he saw his wife, Duchess Louise, who was sitting in a carriage, listening to an open-air concert in a square of Parma. They waved to each other politely.\n\nAt 5:45 the Duke was returning to his palace; while he was passing by the Church of Santa Lucia, he stopped for a moment to ask about the identity of a pretty girl whom he had just seen in an upper window across the street. He was making the inquiry and saluting two soldiers, who walked by him, when he was attacked from behind by two men who were trailing him.\n\nOne of them knocked the Duke violently and stabbed him deep in the stomach with a triangular blade. Everything happened so fast that Charles initially did not realize what had just transpired and seconds later gasping he said, “My God, I’m done for. They have stabbed me”. In the confusion, the two assailants escaped running in opposite directions and mixing with the crowd.\n\nThe wounded Duke fell on the ground in a pool of blood with the blade still in his stomach. He was lifted up, and held by his arms and legs. He was carried back to the palace. He made no complaints as his doctors treated his wound, which was deep. He asked if they thought his life was in danger.\n\nThey lied assuring him that it was not and he passed out. In moments of lucidity, the Duke, realizing the seriousness of his condition repeated: “I am preparing myself for a long journey”. The Duke received the last rites and was able to see his wife and their children for a last time. After atrocious suffering, which he endured bravely, he died the following evening, March 27 at 5:30 p.m. He was thirty-one years old.\n\nCharles’s body was buried in the Cappella della Macchia near Viareggio. His heart was placed in an urn in the crypt of the Sanctuary of Santa Maria della Steccata in Parma.\n\nWhen her husband was murdered Louise Marie Thèrésa served as regent for their young son, the new duke, Robert I. Like the other rulers of the Central Italian states, she and her son were ousted during the Franco-Austrian War of 1859, and they retired to Austrian protection in Venice.\n\nVarious schemes following the war, either for her and her son’s restoration in Parma, or territorial swaps which might leave them ruling over Tuscany, Modena, or the Romagna, came to nothing, as the whole of central Italy was annexed by Piedmont in March 1860. Louise Marie Thèrésa lived out the remainder of her life in exile.\n\nDeath\n\nLouise died on February 1, 1864, aged 44, in the Palazzo Giustinian in Venice. She was buried in her grandfather Charles X’s crypt at the Franciscan monastery Kostanjevica in Görz, Austria (now Nova Gorica, Slovenia).\n\nOther members of the French Royal Family buried there include her brother Henri, Count of Chambord, her aunt Marie Thérèse of France, and her uncle Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoulême.\n\nLouise Marie Thèrésa had been described at that time as a pretty blonde, fair complexioned with golden hair and blue eyes, but not very tall. She was reserved, cold, insensitive and lacked charm.\n\nHer son, Robert I, Duke of Parma, (July 9, 1848 – November 16, 1907): married his cousin Princess Maria Pia of Bourbon-Two Sicilies on April 5, 1869. She was the daughter of King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies and his wife, Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria, the eldest daughter of Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen and Princess Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg.\n\nHer paternal grandparents were Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor and Maria Luisa of Spain. Her maternal grandparents were Friedrich Wilhelm of Nassau-Weilburg and his wife Burgravine Louise Isabelle of Kirchberg.\n\nRobert I, Duke of Parma, and Princess Maria Pia of Bourbon-Two Sicilies had twelve children.\n\nDuke Robert remarried Infanta Maria Antónia of Portugal on October 1884, daughter of the deposed King Miguel I of Portugal and his wife, Adelaide of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg. Maria Antonia was his second cousin once removed, as her paternal grandmother (Charlotte of Spain) and Robert’s paternal great-grandmother (Infanta Maria Luisa of Spain) were siblings, both being children of Carlos IV of Spain and Maria Luisa of Parma.\n\nDuke Robert and Infanta Maria Antónia of Portugal also had twelve children.\n\nPrincess Zita of Bourbon-Parma was the seventeenth child of Robert I, Duke of Parma, and his second wife, Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal, and thus a granddaughter of Princess Louise Marie Thèrésa d’Artois, Duchess of Parma.\n\nPrincess Zita married the then Archduke Charles of Austria in 1911. Charles became heir presumptive to Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria-Hungary in 1914 after the assassination of his uncle Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, and acceded to the throne in 1916 after the elderly emperor’s death.\n\nMarriage\n\nIn 1832, King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies, brother of Carolina of the Two Sicilies, Duchess of Berry, had proposed to marry his younger brother, Prince Antonio, Count of Lecce who was 16 years old, to Louise Marie Thérèse d’Artois who was then 13. The plans fizzled.\n\nPrince Antonio quickly became known for his restless behavior. By age sixteen in 1832, he was already a consummate womanizer. The marriage negotiation failed as Princess Carolina, the Duchess of Angoulême opposed the union.\n\nPrincess Carolina, the Duchess of Angoulême also discarded the idea of marrying her niece to any Austrian Archduke. She was adamant that Louise Marie Thèrésa should marry a Bourbon. As there were very few princes to choose from, Louise Marie Thèrésa reached twenty-five still unmarried and at an advanced age for a single Princess of her time.\n\nFinally in 1845, Princess Carolina, the Duchess of Angoulême arranged her marriage to Hereditary Prince Charles Louis of Lucca, the future Duke Charles III of Parma.\n\nA few years younger than Louise Marie Thèrésa, Charles Louis used to spend some summers near Froshdorf and they had met when they were still children.\n\nCharles III, Duke of Parma, was born at the Villa delle Pianore near Lucca on 14 January 1823, the only son of Charles Louis, Prince of Lucca, (later Duke of Lucca, and Duke Charles II of Parma) and his wife Princess Maria Teresa of Savoy (daughter of King Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia and his wife, Archduchess Maria Teresa of Austria-Este herself the daughter of the daughter of Archduke Ferdinand Charles of Austria-Este, and Maria Beatrice d’Este, Duchess of Massa.\n\nHe was given the baptismal names Ferdinand Charles Victor Joseph Maria Baldassarre. Until his accession as Duke of Parma in 1849, he was called Ferdinand Charles or Ferdinand. His family called him Danduccio.\n\nAt the death of his grandmother, Infanta Maria Luisa of Spain, Duchess of Lucca, on March 13, 1824, Ferdinand Charles became the Hereditary Prince of Lucca.\n\nHereditary Prince Ferdinand Charles of Lucca, the future Duke Charles III of Parma was a member of the House of Bourbon-Parma, a sub-branch of the House of Bourbon-Spain, itself originally a branch of the House of Bourbon, and thus of the Capetian Dynasty and earlier a descendent of the Robertians.\n\nDuke Charles III’s patriline is the line from which he is descended father to son. It follows the Dukes of Parma as well as the Kings of Spain, France, and Navarre. The line can be traced back more than 1,200 years from Robert of Hesbaye to the present day, through Kings of France & Navarre, Spain and Two-Sicilies, Dukes of Parma and Grand-Dukes of Luxembourg, Princes of Orléans and Emperors of Brazil. It is one of the oldest in Europe.\n\nOn November 10, 1845, at Schloss Frohsdorf in Austria, Louise Marie Thèrésa married Hereditary Prince Ferdinand Charles of Lucca.\n\nThe Duchy of Lucca was incorporated in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, and she and her husband became known as Hereditary Prince and Hereditary Princess of Parma.\n\nIn December 1847, at the death of Empress Marie Louise, his father became the reigning Duke Charles II of Parma. His reign in Parma as Duke Charles II was brief. He was ill-received by his new subjects and within a few months he was ousted by a revolution.\n\nEmpress Marie Louise was the eldest child of Franz II, Holy Roman Emperor and Emperor of Austria, and his second wife, Maria Theresa of Naples and Sicily. She was also the second wife of was Napoleon Bonaparte , Emperor of the French, and as such was the Empress of the French and Queen of Italy from their marriage on April 1, 1810 until his abdication on April 6, 1814.\n\nIn August 1848 the Austrian army entered Parma, and officially restored Duke Charles II. Ferdinand Charles and his wife Princess Louise Marie Thèrésa and family, however, remained in England, since hostilities continued between the Austrian and Piedmontese armies. For several years Charles II had considered abdicating in favor of Ferdinand Charles, but he delayed in the hope that when he did so things would be more secure for his son.\n\nOn April 9, the regency transformed into a provisional government. Only four months after regaining the throne of his ancestors, Charles II was forced to flee from Italy, finding refuge in the castle of Weistropp in Saxony. On April 19, 1848, Charles abdicated in favor of his son, living in exile in Great Britain.\n\nDuke Charles III owed his throne to the support of Austrian troops. He placed Parma under martial law, inflicted heavy penalties on the members of the late provisional government, closed the university, and instituted a regular policy of persecution. His authoritarian policies made him unpopular.\n\nHis arbitrary decisions destroyed the respect that his subjects had for him and his dynasty and he became unpopular. By 1853 there were rumors of plots to remove him from power.\n\nHis personal life was also in turmoil. He grew apart from his wife, Princess Louise Marie Thèrésa, Duchess of Parma who became exceedingly fat. The Duchess was a sharp-tongued woman who liked having her way through intrigues and the force of her personality.\n\nThe rift between husband and wife grew when Charles III openly began an affair with Countess Emma Guadagni (1829–1866), a sister-in-law of the Austrian general governor of Trento. They met in Florence in February 1852, while Charles III was a guest of Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany.\n\nIn a semi-official visit to Queen Isabella II of Spain in December 1853, Charles III took his mistress with him, bringing about the final breakdown of his marriage. In mid February 1854, Charles III returned to Parma."
