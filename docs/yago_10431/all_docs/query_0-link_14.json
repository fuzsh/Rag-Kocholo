        "text": "Thks warren,\n\nMaria olivia, i am afraid you are going to be dissapointed, i heard from the napoléon family, nicely but firmly, that there will be absolutely no photographs, no public appearances, no journalist, in a word, nothing around the wedding of princesse Caroline. It will take place in a private place, which, believe me, will be very hard to spy on even for the most clever paparazzi. The only reason for this, is that the bride and groom absolutely loathe publicity around what they consider a private event, they want their friends and families to be around them and that is all.\n\nI really regret this because i think it is going to be great, but on the other hand, i find it rather \"impérial\" and not lacking a certain \"panache\".\n\nBy the way, are we allowed to talk about this ?\n\nFrom a 2010 photo I have seen, Caroline appeared to be pregnant.\n\nYou are right!\n\nTheir little happiness was in fact born in 2010; it is a girl and her name is Elvire.\n\nSource: Descendants of King Louis Philippe I of the French (first part)"
