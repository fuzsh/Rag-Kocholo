        "text": "I’m sure you all remember the “bouncy” redhead who was the “breath of fresh air” for the Royal Family. Well, she’s at it again.\n\nSarah Margaret Ferguson was deemed the perfect match for the Queen’s son, Prince Andrew, whom she married in 1986. Sarah was loved by the Queen and the other members of the family for her eagerness to ride, her enthusiasm for public engagements, and her bawdy jokes.\n\nAfter a few years the laughter turned to embarrassed coughs and averted eyes. As HRH The Duchess of York, Sarah nabbed freebies, pulled rank, went on extensive holidays, and sent the bill to the Queen for the privilege of it all. She was soon branded the “Duchess of Do Little”, compared unfavorably to the hardworking Princess Anne and the stylish Diana.\n\nA blatant extramarital fling that hit the front pages was the last straw. Sarah soon found herself at a dead end in the Royal family and she had no other recourse but to divorce the Duke. Sarah was banished from Balmoral and stripped of the HRH title, fleeing to America to escape the brutal British media.\n\nSarah eventually paid back her debts to the Queen in very unconventional ways: she became a spokeswoman, a product developer, and a co-author of various royal-themed books. Sarah earned so much money from endorsements and other ventures that she eventually wiped her debts completely clean.\n\nAfter years of polishing her image, Sarah was invited back to Balmoral in August 2008. The weekend holiday was intended as a celebration of Princess Beatrice’s birthday. Fergie was finally back in the fold … or so it seemed.\n\nUnfortunately, Sarah did not remain the low-key, responsible woman she was forced to become over those years. She fooled everyone, including the Queen, who is probably now kicking herself for thinking that people change.\n\nThe Duchess of York is a title dear to Her Majesty’s heart. Her beloved mother, Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, was the previous Duchess who became the nation’s symbolic backbone during World War II as Queen.\n\nHer Majesty was once little Princess Elizabeth of York, and her sister was Margaret Rose of York. Her father, Prince Albert, referred to their happy little family as “Us Four”. The Queen spent her happiest pre-war days as a York Princess. How it must pain her to see the title squandered in such a manner by the greedy and publicity starved Sarah Ferguson.\n\nI pray endlessly that the title, now portrayed as a symbol of farce and irresponsibility, will be freed from the grasp of this woman.\n\nA Selection of Horrors:\n\nSarah launched an undercover campaign to highlight the horrific conditions in Turkish orphanages. By doing so, she broke the country’s strict privacy laws and dragged the Royal family into a highly sensitive issue with a foreign nation. While the documentary was a noble feat, she has caused considerable diplomatic tensions between the United Kingdom and Turkey.\n\nCourt papers show that Sarah is still not as good with money as previously thought: she owes thousands of pounds to an accountancy firm, a solicitor and a family-run photographic printing company.\n\nHer documentary entitled The Duchess on the Estate has critics panning her for being “patronizing” and “Victorian” in her manner, using other people’s misery to slake her thirst for publicity and making the Manchester housing estate look worse than it is.\n\nNow Sarah admits she might go on the TV shopping network QVC: “Tommy Hilfiger has a line of clothes he wants me to work with but so far the deal hasn’t been set,” she said toCindy Adams of the New York Post."
