        "text": "by Susan Flantzer\n\n© Unofficial Royalty 2020\n\nBorn on November 19, 1983, at Portland Hospital in London, England, Edoardo Alessandro Mapelli Mozzi is the younger of the two children of Count Alessandro (Alex) Mapelli Mozzi and his first wife Nicola (Nikki) Burrows. Eduardo has a sister Natalia Alice Yeomans (born 1981) and a half-brother Alby Shale (born 1991) from his mother’s second marriage to Christopher Shale, British businessman and Conservative politician, who died in 2011. Edoardo’s father made a second marriage to Ebba Eckermann and his mother made a third marriage to sculptor David Williams-Ellis.\n\nEdoardo’s father is a member of an Italian noble family, whose family seat is the Villa Mapelli Mozzi located in Ponte San Pietro, Bergamo, Italy. The title was given to his family in the nobility of Italy in 1913 by Vittorio Emanuele III, King of Italy. Count Alessandro Mapelli Mozzi’s title, which he uses as a courtesy, is not officially recognized in either Italy or the United Kingdom. He holds both Italian and British citizenship and competed in the 1972 Winter Olympics in three alpine skiing events as a member of the British Olympic team.\n\nEdoardo attended Radley College, a boys’ independent boarding school near Radley, Oxfordshire, England, which was founded in 1847. He received a master’s degree in politics at the University of Edinburgh in Edinburg, Scotland.\n\nWhen he was 23-years-old, Edoardo founded Banda Property, a property development and interior design company that focuses on designing homes for affluent clients in undervalued parts of London. He is also a co-founder of the British-Rwandan charity Cricket Builds Hope whose goal is to use cricket as a tool for positive social change in Rwanda.\n\nEdoardo had a three-year relationship and was engaged to American architect Dara Huang. The couple had a son Christopher, born in 2016, but broke up in 2018. In 2018, Edoardo started dating Princess Beatrice. Their families had been close friends for decades. In May 2019, Beatrice and Edoardo attended their first royal family event together, the wedding of Beatrice’s second cousin once removed, Lady Gabriella Windsor.\n\nOn September 26, 2019, Buckingham Palace announced the engagement of Princess Beatrice of York to Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, a multi-millionaire property tycoon. Beatrice and Edoardo’s wedding, scheduled for May 29, 2020, was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Princess Beatrice is a granddaughter of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and the elder of the two daughters of Prince Andrew, Duke of York and his former wife Sarah, Duchess of York. Edoardo and Beatrice, who had known each other since childhood, started dating in 2018.\n\nEdoardo and Beatrice were married in a private ceremony at the Royal Chapel of All Saints, on the grounds of Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park, on July 17, 2020.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Wedding of Princess Beatrice and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi\n\nBuckingham Palace announced on September 20, 2021, that Princess Beatrice and her husband Edoardo welcomed a daughter into their family. Sienna Elizabeth Mapelli Mozzi was born on Saturday, September 18, 2021, at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London, England and weighed 6 lb. 2 oz."
