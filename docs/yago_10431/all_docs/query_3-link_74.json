Well - lets look into the crystal ball\n\nI am meeting up with an old friend later today. Today 18 year the two of us and some others were in a church praying for this child and Sophie. It seems like yesterday and also a million years ago at the same time.\n\nI expect The Wessex to be moving into the role of Kents and Gloucester's soon. Their children will have the same normal lives those children and I expect more then.\n\nThey will not have royal weddings at all - not televised and I doubt that it will be announced either from the palace. They will then be the nephew and niece of the monarch - depends on Charles really. The announcement will come from Edward and Sophie's office.\n\nPlease note the next Windsor Wedding is probably going to be Peter's second - so you can start a thread on that.\n\nPlease note the next Windsor Wedding is probably going to be Peter's second - so you can start a thread on that.\n\nMaybe yes, maybe not - Peter has just recently divorced Autumn, he still should have time to reconsider why this marriage collapsed in order not to commit the same errors in the future, and the woman and his daughters must accept each other (this woman also can have children), it also requires time.\n\nFirst love, while we are still young and without obligations is always much more spontaneous\n\nAh, and one more thing - Peter's eventual second wedding will be civil only (maybe even without the blessing - Peter will never be the Head of the C of E); these weddings will not arouse such emotions as the religious ones.\n\nNow that Lady Louise has reached marriageable age, we may start to speculate how the future weddings of her and her brother will look like.\n\nThey parents are devoted to their duties and seem to protect the private lives of their children, wanting for them to leave as \"normal\" fife as possible in their situation.\n\nDo you think the glamour of their respective weddings may depend from who will be King at that moments - still their uncle Charles (more) or already their cousin William?

Expect no TV coverage. However, the invitee list could potentially be a Who's Who of British society.\n\nI suspect the wedding may well be at St George's, or perhaps, a less high profle church (All Saints?).

However, the invitee list could potentially be a Who's Who of British society.\n\nBut if William will already be King then, will he be obliged to attend?\n\nHe was not present at Peter's wedding because he preferred to be at friend's wedding, and was reportedly criticized for it - And Peter is, due to lesser age difference, closer to him than Louise, let alone James.\n\nBut in 2008 he was still not a King.\n\nAnd if Louise marries a British peer, their wedding could take place at the church that family attends to.\n\nBut if William will already be King then, will he be obliged to attend?\n\nHe was not present at Peter's wedding because he preferred to be at friend's wedding, and was reportedly criticized for it - And Peter is, due to lesser age difference, closer to him than Louise, let alone James.\n\nBut in 2008 he was still not a King.\n\nAnd if Louise marries a British peer, their wedding could take place at the church that family attends to.\n\nI don't think it has anything to do with being King or not. For example HM attended the wedding of Lady Gabriella but not Lord and Lady Frederick's and has and hasn't other other members of the Kents and Gloucesters. Depending on where and when they were and if she was busy.\n\nWilliam was at Zara's and other family weddings, why he chose to skip Peter's and send Kate is his place isn't something we've had an answer on. Right now in a purely theoretical way I don't see why he wouldn't be at Lady Louise's (probably very future) wedding unless he has something he can't get out of.\n\nMaybe yes, maybe not - Peter has just recently divorced Autumn, he still should have time to reconsider why this marriage collapsed in order not to commit the same errors in the future, and the woman and his daughters must accept each other (this woman also can have children), it also requires time.\n\nFirst love, while we are still young and without obligations is always much more spontaneous\n\nAh, and one more thing - Peter's eventual second wedding will be civil only (maybe even without the blessing - Peter will never be the Head of the C of E); these weddings will not arouse such emotions as the religious ones.\n\nWhy do you state that Peter's wedding will be a 'civil only' wedding? If he is legally divorced and no adultery was committed, as far as I know he can have a second religious marriage. He isn't Roman Catholic where an annulment would be required.\n\nI believe that we have only to look at the marriages of the Queen’s niece and nephew in this reign to be able to gauge what sort of wedding the Wessex children are likely to have if they both marry when Charles is King.\n\nTheir mother Princess Margaret was a working royal as both Edward and Sophie are likely to still be when their children wed, yet did Lady Sarah or David, the present Earl Snowden, have weddings with all the bells and whistles of St George’s and public and TV interest?\n\nWere their weddings televised, with a huge amount of hoopla and interest from the public? The answer is No, so it’s likely to be the same for Lady Louise and her brother James. The Snowdon children had what were regarded as smart society weddings, members of the Press filed a short report, took some photographs, several Royals attended, and that was that.\n\nDepending on personal taste, Louise and James’s bride may well wear family tiaras. Daughters of Dukes and Earls and future daughters in law often still do at aristocratic weddings.\n\nAs far as Peter Phillips is concerned, I don’t believe that he will have another Church wedding, though that isn’t forbidden of course. I think it will be quietly celebrated, especially if his bride is also a divorcee and we are all likely to know about any of it sometime later.\n\nAh, and one more thing - Peter's eventual second wedding will be civil only (maybe even without the blessing - Peter will never be the Head of the C of E); these weddings will not arouse such emotions as the religious ones.\n\nNot necessarily. Assuming that his second wife-to-be was also Protestant - and she may not be Protestant, or Christian at all, but obviously we don't know that yet! - he could remarry in a Scottish church, as Princess Anne did. And some Church of England vicars are happy to allow divorced people to remarry in church.\n\nIf Peter married someone who hadn't been married before, she might well want a big white wedding with all the trimmings.\n\nI think it's a bit soon to start speculating about Louise . I can't imagine that she'll want a big public wedding, but plenty of private individuals have big private weddings, so why not, if that's what she and her future partner want? As long as they're happy!\n\nMaybe yes, maybe not - Peter has just recently divorced Autumn, he still should have time to reconsider why this marriage collapsed in order not to commit the same errors in the future, and the woman and his daughters must accept each other (this woman also can have children), it also requires time.\n\nFirst love, while we are still young and without obligations is always much more spontaneous\n\nAh, and one more thing - Peter's eventual second wedding will be civil only (maybe even without the blessing - Peter will never be the Head of the C of E); these weddings will not arouse such emotions as the religious ones.\n\nWhy would Peter's eventual second wedding be 'civil only'. His mother has a church wedding for her second wedding. The CoE has also changed its rules around second marriages of divorced person's since his mother remarried. As long as a second wife wasn't the reason for the breakdown of the first marriage - and they have both said there was no third person in the marriage - the CoE will happily remarry Peter in a church in England.\n\nIn terms of location, I'm thinking St. George's Chapel or Royal Chapel of All Saints are the most likely ones, because Louise and James spent a lot time (growing up) at Windsor. If the wedding takes part in London, Queen's Chapel and Chapel Royal at St. James' Palace could be possible. However, I do see the possibility of the weddings taking place outside the Crown Estate (Windsor Castle, Kensington Palace, Buckingham Palace, St. James), like Zara and Mike Tindall's or even in the Sovereign's private estates (Sandringham or Balmoral).\n\nThe biggest/grandest scale would be like Sarah & Daniel Chatto, Peter & Autumn and Zara & Mike's weddings with no live television coverage of the ceremony, but crowds and cameras outside. I left out Viscount Linley (now 2nd Earl of Snowdon), because his wedding took place St. Margaret's Church, Westminster with 650 guests and I don't see Louise and James going that big. Assuming Louise and James will not become working royals in the future, I think they would go down the Gloucesters, Kents or even Princess Beatrice's route, if they want their wedding occasions to be very private with little press/media presence.\n\nThere's a huge difference in size between St George's and All Saints despite the similar location. That's great if she (or anyone) wanted a tiny country wedding but wouldn't fit their potential combined family and friends.\n\nI think you'd go \"I want a small wedding, let's have it at All Saints\" rather than \"I want it at Windsor which one do you think?\"\n\nYes, I'm aware that there is a big difference between St George's and All Saints. I was also thinking about the cost of security and level of press/media presence, which will be less compared to locations that are not in the Crown Estate nor private properties of the sovereign. That was the reason (along with the location of wedding reception) why I considered the location (e.g. Windsor). The security would most likely to be paid privately, especially after the controversy surrounding Princess Eugenie's wedding. Of course you can argue that St. George's would require more protection compared to All Saints.\n\nI was also trying to narrow the options down almost by process of elimination. I'm sure Louise and James would have the chapel/church in mind without going through wide range possibility.\n\nSt Margaret's is in the precincts of Westminster Abbey and there's already security around that. Also the Met and RPOs are extremely used to its lay out if necessary, so I doubt there was a huge need for extra security beyond what already happens when HM goes anywhere.\n\nI doubt every minor royal will want to be married at Windsor, although it will continue to be a personal choice for some. Unless we're talking Charlotte or Louis the choice won't have anything to do with interest from the public or not. I'd say there was arguably more potential interest in Mike and Zara's due to their sports celebrity couple status than many other minor royals who have married at Windsor (including her brother) and they chose Edinburgh.\n\nThe Linleys had a big glitzy wedding in Westminster with hundreds of guests, and some big-name celebs as well as Royals. The Chattos had a much smaller wedding, at a small church. It just depends what each particular couple want. Louise and James both seem like fairly quiet people and I can't see either of them hitting the social scene big time, but who knows what might happen in future, or what their eventual partners will be like?\n\nThen there's the issue of what else is going on! As I recall, a load of photographers turned up at Lady Sarah's wedding to see if Charles and Diana would arrive together or not, and the press tried to hang around Pippa Middleton's wedding to see if Meghan was there. Not very fair on the happy couples themselves, but that's the way it goes."
