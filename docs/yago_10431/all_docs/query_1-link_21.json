Yes, I understand that those are their primary circles. But JC has been studying and working abroad and hence has a lot of exposure to all sorts of people. I hope he will choose someone for himself, not for the dynasty.\n\nThe Buonapartes were in fact members of an old Tuscan noble family incorporated into the French nobility. Louis XV issued an edict in april 1770 \"whereby all Corsicans who can prove their possession of nobility for two hundred years are admitted into the French nobility with the enjoyment of all its privileges\". Carlo Buonaparte made the application and it was approved 13th of September of 1771.\n\nThat said Josephine was of a totally different social standing than her husband Napoleon. The former a member of an old, prominent family of courtiers and the other a member of the petty nobility.\n\nBonapartes\n\nI wouldn't define the Bonapartes, or rather in that age Buonaparte, as being \"petty\" nobility. Carlo was Corsica's representative in the court of King Louis and before Corsica was incorporated into France they were in the Italian courts and councils. They were low ranking to be sure, but not petty.\n\nJoseph would've been higher in status than Napoleon with him being the older brother, but Napoleon strove for power and succeeded. At the time of their religious marriage Napoleon's status was much higher than Josephine's.\n\nI wouldn't define the Bonapartes, or rather in that age Buonaparte, as being \"petty\" nobility.

This means that a De Lannoy often is then seen as \"more prestigious\" than a family with a higher rank, but with a Nobility Charter just from the 20th C.\n\nThe nobility of the Tascher de La Pagerie family (Joséphine) has far more anciennity than the higher ranked but brand new acquired noble titles of Napoléon Bonaparte.\n\nI hope it won't be off topic to ask about the work of Princess Beatrice - does she work? has she ever worked? where does she live? also, does the family spend a lot of time together? what are C and JC relationships with Prince Charles?\n\nI have no idea actually but she often turns up on the Instagram on the branch of the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies led by her brother The Duke of Castro. Often in curcumstances involving The Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George of which she is Grand Prefect and over which her brother claims to be sovereign.\n\nIf I remember it correctly Jean-Cristophe was the sponsor of his cousin Maria-Carolina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies at her confirmation.\n\nCharles let it be known in Point de Vue in 1997 that \"there will never be conflict between us\" and as far as I know there hasnt been any public signs of conflict so hopefully the family members is at peace with each other.\n\nIf theres anything the Bonapartes have been good at its family feuds.\n\nI hope it won't be off topic to ask about the work of Princess Beatrice - does she work? has she ever worked? where does she live? also, does the family spend a lot of time together? what are C and JC relationships with Prince Charles?\n\nWhen she was younger, she worked as a press attachée. In recent years, she co-authored a book entitled Votre Mariage Royal with Cyrille Boulay. She lived in France at Neuilly-sur-Seine...not sure if the address is current anymore.\n\nYou're welcome RoyalistforLife.\n\nI do hope that Princess Alix lives long and in good health. Her grandson may be Bonaparte by blood, but his grandmere is the true representative across the globe.\n\nHer grandson is very busy and while the legacy of Napoleon is historical it demands respect and hundreds of thousands of people are in wonder over the French emperor. Who will be the representative to the historical societies when the Princess is no longer able to?\n\nYou're welcome RoyalistforLife.\n\nI do hope that Princess Alix lives long and in good health.

Who will be the representative to the historical societies when the Princess is no longer able to?\n\nI do hope so too. She is a remarkable woman and I wish her many more years in good health.\n\nWell, JC will marry at some point so let's hope the woman will be a beautiful representative of the family, and may I add not as numbingly boring as his current girlfriend (Olympia?). I am really sorry for saying this, just my opinion, she might be the best person in the world, she just doesn't have a good presence, in my view.\n\nI am sad to see that Prince Charles's current wife is not seen at all - she seems not to be interested in being a representative for them? Or she isn't allowed?\n\nPrincess Alix is indeed truly remarkable. If she were Empress legally she would make an excellent empress.\n\nI thought JC and Olympia were broken up? Je ne sais pas.\n\nI know Prince Charles didn't attend the funeral of his father because he wasn't allowed to bring his wife. Louis apparently hated Charles' second marriage that much. Which seems harsh.\n\nHer lack of presence may be due to not being allowed or she doesn't care. It seems strange that Princess Beatrice attends the Invalides event, but not Caroline or Sophie (as far as I know).\n\nHere are some images of Prince Jean-Christophe's mother and paternal grandmother over the years: one can see that the Dowager Princess Napoléon and Princess Béatrice of Bourbon-Two Sicilies have remained close.\n\nAlthough Prince Charles Napoléon has been politically active, socially he does not seem to mix in the same circles as his mother or first wife. His siblings, especially his sisters, have also lived very discreet lives. Princess Catherine Napoléon's first marriage to a nephew of Queen Paola of Belgium was a huge Gotha event.\n\nPrincess Catherine's second husband died in 2017; they had two daughters together. Princess Laure was widowed in 2009; she and Monsieur Lecomte had one son.\n\nAttachments\n\n108387093.jpg\n\n179100543.jpg\n\n187192232.jpg\n\n453406674.jpg\n\nI did not know that about the husbands of Catherine and Laure. I really hope they are doing well. Even if tension remains between Charles and Alix, I'm glad that JC and his father have long since reconciled.\n\nLeMonde said that Charles sometimes leads tours through the 70? cities were Napoleon went through and left a mark. Sounds like an awesome vacation. I also plan to visit France for the Bicentenary of Napoelon's death. Does anyone know if France will plan anything on a grand scale in honor of the event?\n\nPrincess Alix is indeed truly remarkable. If she were Empress legally she would make an excellent empress.\n\nYes! Totally agree! She is so regal, I can hardly name any reigning royals who are!\n\nI thought JC and Olympia were broken up? Je ne sais pas.\n\nI don't know either. I think last year they were still together at some functions?\n\nI know Prince Charles didn't attend the funeral of his father because he wasn't allowed to bring his wife. Louis apparently hated Charles' second marriage that much. Which seems harsh.\n\nWonder what's to hate about that? Divorces happen and it's not just one person's fault. Is it because she doesn't belong to the nobility?\n\nHer lack of presence may be due to not being allowed or she doesn't care. It seems strange that Princess Beatrice attends the Invalides event, but not Caroline or Sophie (as far as I know)\n\nThat's interesting indeed that Princess Beatrice attends such events but she's the mother of the head of the house who works abroad and seems to be building a career so quite busy. But strange that the other members don't participate."
