        "text": "He is the son of Prince Charles Napoléon and his first wife Princess Béatrice of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, daughter of the late Prince Ferdinand of Bourbon, Duke of Castro, a claimant to the headship of the former Royal House of the Two Sicilies His parents divorced on 2 May 1989, two months before Jean-Christophe’s 3rd birthday.\n\nJean-Christophe is the great-great-great-great-nephew of Emperor Napoleon I (who has no legitimate direct descendants) through the emperor’s youngest brother, Jérôme, King of Westphalia. Through his mother, he is a descendant of King Louis XIV of France and through his great-grandmother, Princess Clémentine of Belgium, he descends from William IV, Prince of Orange, Charles III of Spain, Frederick William I of Prussia, George II of Great Britain and Louis Philippe I, King of the French, who was the last king to rule France, while his great-great-grandfather was Prince Napoléon Bonaparte, the heir of Emperor Napoleon III, France’s most recent monarch.\n\nJean-Christophe’s grandfather, Louis, Prince Napoléon, died in 1997 and stipulated in his will that he wished his 11-year-old grandson Jean-Christophe to succeed him as Head of the Imperial House of France rather than the boy’s father, Charles, who had embraced republican principles and decided to remarry without his father’s consent. Despite the dynastic dispute, Jean-Christophe’s father has stated that “there will never be conflict” between him and his son over the imperial succession."
