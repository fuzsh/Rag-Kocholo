        "text": "In March 2019, it became publicly known that Prince Jean-Christophe Napoléon, son of Prince Charles Napoléon and Princess Béatrice of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, had become engaged to Countess Olympia of Arco-Zinneberg, daughter of Count Riprand of Arco-Zinneberg and Archduchess Maria Beatrix of Autria. Jean-Christophe and Olympia have been in a relationship for some years. The prince had proposed to the countess in January 2019 in Switzerland. Jean-Christophe's grandmother, the Dowager Princess Napoléon, resides in Switzerland at Prangins.\n\nPrince Jean-Christophe succeeded his grandfather as Prince Napoleon, Head of the Imperial House France. Countess Olympia is a great-granddaughter Emperor Karl and Empress Zita.\n\nJean-Christophe was born at Saint-Raphaël, Var, on 11 July 1986 as the second child and only son of Prince Charles Napoléon (b.1950) and Princess Béatrice of Bourbon-Two Sicilies (b.1950). Jean-Christophe joined an older sister, Princess Caroline (b.1980). Charles and Béatrice ruffled the feathers of their respective parents, the Prince and Princess Napoléon as well as the Duke and Duchess of Castro, by contracting a civil marriage in 1978 and declining to hold a Roman Catholic ceremony.\n\nThe marriage of Jean-Christophe’s parents ended in 1989. When his father Charles married a divorced commoner in 1996, his father Louis (1914-1997) changed his will to make his grandson heir to the Imperial House of France. Princess Béatrice was received as the mother of the Head of the Imperial House by her former mother-in-law Princess Alix (b.1926) at the funeral of Prince Louis in 1997. Jean-Christophe is fluent in French, English, and Spanish. In 2017, he completed a MBA at the Harvard Business School. Since that time, the prince has lived in London, where he also works."
