        "text": "The name of Princess Beatrice's new baby daughter with her husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi has been unveiled. Posting on Instagram, Edo revealed that she has been named Sienna Elizabeth, nodding to both her great-grandmother, the Queen, and her Italian heritage, via her father. He wrote: 'Sienna Elizabeth Mapelli Mozzi. Our life together has just begun, and I can’t wait to see all the amazing things that await us. Feeling so much love and gratitude for my amazing wife, baby Sienna and Wolfie. These are the days I never want to forget. This week, a friend said to me the sweetest saying….that with every child you grow a whole new heart. A massive thank you to the Midwife and the amazing team at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital.’\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe happy news of the birth was announced last month via a statement from Buckingham Palace, which read: 'Her Royal Highness Princess Beatrice and Mr Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi are delighted to announce the safe arrival of their daughter on Saturday 18th September 2021, at 23.42, at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London. The baby weighs 6 pounds and 2 ounces. The new baby’s grandparents and great-grandparents have all been informed and are delighted with the news.\n\n‘The family would like to thank all the staff at the hospital for their wonderful care. Her Royal Highness and her child are both doing well, and the couple are looking forward to introducing their daughter to her big brother Christopher Woolf.'\n\nSienna is the Queen's 12th great-grandchild and is 11th in line to the throne after Princess Beatrice. The current order of succession looks like this: Prince Charles, the Duke of Cambridge, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, Prince Louis, the Duke of Sussex, Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, Lilibet Mountbatten-Windsor and Prince Andrew just above his eldest daughter.\n\nBea and Edo were married in an intimate secret ceremony at Windsor in July 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic, after being forced to postpone their original May wedding date. A handful of family and friends were in attendance, crucially including Bea's late grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh, who died in April of this year. The couple recently celebrated their first wedding anniversary.\n\nEdo is already father to five-year-old son Christopher Woolf known as 'Wolfie', as referenced in the Buckingham Palace statement, with his ex-fiancée Dara Huang, while Bea is of course a doting step-mother.\n\nSienna is the second grandchild for Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York, after their younger daughter Princess Eugenie welcomed her first child, son August Philip Hawke Brooksbank, earlier this year.\n\nIt's been a bumper year for great-grandchildren for Her Majesty, as her grandson the Duke of Sussex and his wife Meghan welcomed their second child, a daughter called Lilibet, in June, while the Queen's granddaughter Zara Tindall and her husband Mike became parents to a third child, Lucas Philip, in late March.\n\nSubscribe now for a trial offer of 3 issues for £1 plus free digital editions and home delivery.\n\nMore from Tatler"
