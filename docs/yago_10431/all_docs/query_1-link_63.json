        "text": "WHILE the British Royal family is well known around the world, there are scores of lesser-known royals whose lives are just as glamorous.\n\nAcross Europe there are dozens of unheard of princes and princesses - some with dazzling good looks and enviable lives of luxury.\n\nThis week one of them - Prince Sébastien of Luxembourg - was included in Tatler's top 200 list of the most eligible people in Britain.\n\nAnd while a few have claims to defunct royal titles, they still enjoy all the privileges of being a blue-blood.\n\nThere are even a few bachelors in the mix that could make the dream of becoming a princess possible now that Princes William and Harry are off the market.\n\nFrom a budding soap actor to a singer-songwriter whose parents were friends with Princess Diana, we introduce you to the little-known royals worth having on your radar.\n\nPrincess Maria Chiara of Bourbon Two Sicilies\n\nStunning Princess Maria Chiara, 17, is the daughter of Prince Carlo and Princess Camilla, the Duke and Duchess of Castro.\n\nThe royal regularly shares snaps of her luxury holidays from the likes of Paris, Dubai and New York.\n\nShe also enjoys family homes in Italy, Monaco, Paris and St Tropez and shows of her extensive wardrobe of designer labels.\n\nBoth she and her sister Princess Maria Carolina, 19, are fluent in English, French and Italian and spend much of their time rubbing shoulders with the European elite.\n\nTheir father has a claim to the defunct throne of the former House of Bourbon Two Sicilies, a cadet branch of the Spanish royal family.\n\nThey used to rule over Southern Italy and Sicily during the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nWhile Princess Chiara may not have any official duties as a royal, she and her family spend time doing charity work to promote the regions they once would have presided over.\n\nPrincess Beatrice Borromeo of Monaco\n\nStylish Princess Beatrice, 37, wasn't born into royalty - instead, she married Prince Pierre Casiraghi, 33, the son of Caroline, Princess of Hanover, and grandson of Grace Kelly.\n\nShe has been described by Tatler as the most stylish European royal thanks to her impeccable taste - think Valentino, Armani Prive and Chanel - and her wedding in 2015 was dubbed the \"chicest of the summer\" by Vogue.\n\nShe wore four different dresses - two by Valentino for her civil service in Monaco and two by Armani Privé for the religious service in Lake Maggiore.\n\nPrincess Beatrice is no commoner - she is the daughter of Italian aristocrat Don Carlo Ferdinando, and worked as a political journalist and author alongside her modelling.\n\nShe and Pierre share sons Stefano, five, and Francesco, four. In 2021 Beatrice became an ambassador for Dior.\n\nPrincess Mafalda of Bulgaria\n\nPrincess Mafalda of Bulgaria, 28, is the granddaughter of Bulgaria's last reigning Tsar King Simeon II, also known as Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.\n\nHer parents Kyril, Prince of Preslav, and Rosario Nadal - who have since separated - were closed friends with Princess Diana in the Nineties and were pictured together on board the designer Valentino's yacht.\n\nMafalda was raised in England before moving to America for university where she attended Berklee College of Music, in Boston.\n\nShe met her Lebanese-born British financier partner Marc Abousleiman there, while he was completing his degree at Harvard. The couple now live in New York.\n\nThe brunette beauty is a musician and released her first single, Don't Let Go, in 2015 while still studying and two years later put out her EP Daisy Chain.\n\nShe has yet to have any breakout success with her music, but she has performed at New York Fashion Week and a Valentino show in Greece.\n\nPrince Achileas-Andreas of Greece\n\nPrince Achileas-Andreas is a royal in name only as Greece voted to become a republic while his grandfather was on the throne.\n\nHis parents are Marie-Chantal and Pavlos, the Crown Prince and Princess of Greece.\n\nThe hunky royal is the third oldest of their five children and was born in America before being raised in the UK.\n\nThe 22-year-old is a fledgling actor and had a role in US soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful alongside his aunt Princess Theodora.\n\nWhile he's grown up away from the spotlight, he has enjoyed a lavish lifestyle and counts Princess Beatrice among his friends.\n\nHe often shares snaps from his travels around the globe and already has many adoring fans who constantly comment on his good looks.\n\nPrince Constantine-Alexios of Greece\n\nLike his younger brother Achileas-Andreas, Prince Constantine-Alexios grew up out of the limelight.\n\nThe Greek hunk, 24, goes by Tino and attended Wellington College in Berkshire where fees start at £9,040.\n\nHe relocated to the US in 2017 to attend Georgetown University, Washington DC.\n\nTino has connections within the British Firm - Prince William is his godfather.\n\nKing Charles also held a party at Highgrove in 2000 to mark his grandad King Constantine II's 60th birthday.\n\nAlong with his dad Prince Pavlos, Tino modelled for Dior - posing for Kate Moss' photographer boyfriend Count Nikolai von Bismarck.\n\nHeinrich Donatus, Hereditary Prince of Schaumburg-Lippe\n\nHunky Prince Donatus, 28, is a keen charity worker and recently headed to the Ukraine border to help people affected by the war.\n\nHis royal status comes from the Schaumburg-Lippe line which ruled the German state until the end of the First World War when the monarchies were abolished.\n\nLookswise he takes after his glam mum Princess Marie-Louise of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg, known as Lilly Wittegenstein - a model and Bulgari ambassador. The pair are very close and recently did an ultramarathon together.\n\nDonatus attended Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in Berkshire - where Princes William and Harry went - and became a troop leader in Her Majesty's Household Cavalry Life Guards when he graduated.\n\nHe is distantly related to Prince Philip.\n\nPrince Albert Von Thurn Und Taxis\n\nPrince Albert isn't short - he's believed to boast a $1.6billion fortune, making him probably the richest royal you've never heard of!\n\nHe too is a royal in name only as his regal status comes from the defunct Thurn und Taxis dynasty.\n\nThe 39-year-old German has been the head of the family - which owns a vast art collection and 30,000 hectares of woodland - since his dad Johannes' early death in 1990.\n\nHe had a British education, gaining a degree in degree in economics and theology from the University of Edinburgh.\n\nNow he focuses his time on his career as a racing driver and competes in the German GT Championship ADAC GT Masters.\n\nPrince Wenceslas Of Liechtenstein\n\nPrince Wenceslas of Liechtenstein, 48, has a glittering career in finance and a royal title to boot but when it comes to love, he's struggled to find the one.\n\nThe nephew of reigning Prince Hans-Adam II dated Victoria's Secret model Adriana Lima, now 41, for three years almost 20 years ago, but since then hasn't been linked seriously to anyone else.\n\nHe has, however, been photographed with a string of dazzling women including Sports Illustrated model Barbara Palvin, 28, and a mystery blonde at an event last year.\n\nHe's also rubbed shoulders with Tom Cruise and Princess Victoria of Sweden at A-list events.\n\nHis family name gives tiny country Liechtenstein its name.\n\nPrince Sébastien of Luxembourg\n\nPrince Sébastien of Luxembourg, 30, is the youngest son of Grand Duke Henri and Grand Duchess Maria Teresa - and one of the UK's most eligible men according to Tatler.\n\nLike his older brother, heir to the throne Prince Guillaume, and dad, Prince Sebastien attended Sandhurst from 2016 to 2017.\n\nSébastien is believed to be fluent in Luxembourgish, French, English, German and has some knowledge of Spanish.\n\nHe was sworn in as an officer of the Luxembourgish Army in September 2017 - but since then he's commanded a platoon of the Irish Guards.\n\nSébastien travelled to Franciscan University of Steubenville in Ohio to study his degree in Marketing and Communications.\n\nDuring his summers he worked, and in 2014 he interned at LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton Watch & Jewellery in Hong Kong.\n\nHe is currently thought to be single. Ladies, you're welcome."
