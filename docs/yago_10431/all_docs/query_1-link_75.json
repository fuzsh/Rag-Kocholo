These eight royals from around the world are single and (we think) ready to mingle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCheck out this list and pick out your new favorite.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers.

Hussein also launched the Crown Prince Foundation, which is dedicated to providing leadership and education opportunities to the youth of Jordan. You can follow Hussein's adventures on his incredibly popular Instagram, where he shares photos of himself playing soccer and rock climbing, and doing all kinds of strenuous, six-pack-building outdoor activities.\n\nHis full title: HRH Crown Prince Al-Hussein bin Abdullah II\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDanish Prince Philippos actually works at a hedge fund in New York City.\n\nThe prince: So, we don't know a ton about Philippos, but the 32-year-old prince is a graduate of Georgetown and looks damn good in a tux. What else do you need to know?\n\nHis full title: HRH Prince Philippos of Greece and Denmark\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrince Albert of Thurn and Taxis first made it onto Forbes' billionaire list when he was 8 years old.\n\nThe prince: So the German prince is actually 12th in line to the family throne, but that doesn't really matter, considering he's inherited one of the largest fortunes in Europe — something in the realm of $3.8 billion . Given that money's not really an issue, the 24-year-old spends his time racing (and crashing) cars, collecting art, and partying across the continents.\n\nHis full title: Albert, 12th Prince of Thurn and Taxis\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrince Joachim of Belgium is an officer in the Belgian navy.\n\nThe prince: The 26-year-old studied economics at Bocconi University in Milan, and at the Nautical School in Brugge, so he knows his way around a boat. He's ninth in line for the throne.\n\nHis full title: His Imperial and Royal Highness Prince Joachim of Belgium, Archduke of Austria-Este, Prince Royal of Hungary and Bohemia, Prince of Modena (phew)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrince Nikolai of Denmark is actually a model who's walked in London Fashion Week\n\nThe prince: Eighteen-year-old Nikolai is 6th in line to the royal throne, and isn't supported financially by the monarchy, so he's gone out on his own to make money. In 2017, he signed with Scoop Models, a Danish modeling agency, and has scored a few magazine covers, in addition to his runway work.\n\nHis full title: Prince Nikolai of Denmark, Count of Monpezat\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrown Prince Hamdan of Dubai is an award-winning equestrian and a philanthropist.\n\nThe prince: Though the prince is still fairly young — just 35 — he's already wildly accomplished. He's a skilled equestrian, diver, and skydiver, but he's also a philanthropist who supports autism research. Educated at the London School of Economics, Hamden is the president of a university in Dubai, and is the chairman of Dubai's executive council. And he's the founder of the Hamdan International Photo Award, which aims to support artists around the world. Is there anything this guy can't do?\n\nFull title: His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, Jean-Christophe Napoleon Bonaparte is actually a descendant of THAT Napolean.\n\nThe prince: OK, so the Imperial House of France doesn't actually exist these days (thanks to the French Revolution and all). But Napoléon's descendants live on, and they are attractive. Jean-Christophe is Harvard-educated and works in finance in London. Fun fact: His mother's name is Princess Béatrice of Bourbon-Two Sicilies. What an enchanting/weird name!\n\nHis full title: His Imperial Highness Jean-Christophe, Prince Napoléon\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis Imperial Highness The Prince Nazım Ziyaeddin Nazım Osmanoğlu has a rather unexpected day job.\n\nThe prince: The 32-year-old grew up in Britain, but is a member of the Imperial House of Osman, the former ruling dynasty of the Ottoman Empire. And, well, this is unexpected — Osmanoglu is actually a standup comedian and he's pretty frickin' funny. Don't believe me? Check out his Twitter.\n\nHis title: His Imperial Highness The Prince Nazım Ziyaeddin Nazım Osmanoğlu, Imperial Prince of the Ottoman Empire, Member of the House of Osman.\n\nRead the original article on INSIDER.
