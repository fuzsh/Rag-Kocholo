On their 4K UHD, BFI use a linear PCM mono track (24-bit) in the original English language. "Get Carter" is filled with various types of violence. They can punctuate scenes but remain authentically flat. The, much-discussed, score is by Roy Budd (Kidnapped, Soldier Blue, The Carey Treatment, Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger, The Wild Geese) and supports the film in more subtle ways. BFI include an isolated score track and an audio descriptive track option. The disc offers optional English subtitles - and is, like all 4K UHD, region FREE, playable worldwide.

There are extras on the 4K UHD disc - starting with a new 2.5-minute introduction by Michael Caine who discusses the film's acclaim, the violence and how BFI have always championed Get Carter. It includes two commentaries - the ones from 2000 featuring Michael Caine, Mike Hodges and Wolfgang Suschitzky that is also on the Warner Blu-ray. New is a commentary featuring Kim Newman and Barry Forshaw. Barry mentions Get Carter as the greatest British gangster film ever made and they bring up other examples (The Long Good Friday, It Always Rains on a Sunday, etc.) Kim sees comparisons to Jean-Pierre Melville's Le Samourai. They talk about the novel (based on Ted Lewis's 1970 novel Jack's Return Home), the prequel 'Carter' movies made after and agree not to mention much at all the poor 2000 Stallone version (that has Caine in a supporting role.) They are great at finding details that may relate to other films, the style, the score and their combined analysis are very welcome. As mentioned there is an optional isolated Roy Webb score available and an audio descriptive track.
