        "text": "Get Carter [1971] ‘Eyes Look Like…Piss-Holes In The Snow’ – Tony Klinger Reveals The Story Behind THAT Famous Line\n\nPicture above: Michael Caine [as Jack Carter] and Ian Hendry [as Eric Paice] at the races.\n\nAnother post containing some more fascinating anecdotes, this time from Tony Klinger who first met Ian Hendry during the filming of Repulsion [1965] and then again, on the set of Get Carter in 1971! Tony is a Film and TV Director and son of the late Michael Klinger, the producer and driving force behind bringing the novel ‘Jack’s Return Home‘ by Â Ted Lewis to the big screen:\n\n“An uncompromising novel of a brutal half-world of pool halls, massage parlours and teenage pornography, it was memorably adapted into the cult film Get Carter.Â Â The novel starkly portrays a subsection of society living on the borderline between crime and respectability; and was a major influence on the noir school of English crime fiction.”\n\nMuch more on Tony and Michael below, but first a little background story and some context.\n\nFilms And Famous Lines\n\nI remember one time when I was introduced to the Directors at my new company. They were a few years older than me, Two Scotsmen and a Welshman. Dave Allen could probably have told you a joke about that encounter.\n\nWhen they found out my full name they said:‘Oh, Hendry…like the actor, Ian…’\n\nTo their surprise, I mentioned that he was, or had been, my uncle. And the first thing they said to me in reply was:\n\n“Ah yes, we should have guessed….your eyes….they’re like piss holes in the snow!”\n\nThe history of film is often recalled through the famous lines and passages of dialogue that reminds us of a memorable moment or defines the essence of the story. Â They have often entered into the public’s subconscious, affectionately recalled at times when events in our own lives, seem to resonate with those that we have seen on the big screen. And perhaps that is one of the reasons that film has become so loved as a medium and remained so popular throughout it’s history. At times it can feel like a mirror is being held up to our own lives .\n\nSometimes, however, it is just a simple case of everyday language being taken and used in a film, to reflect the era and the society in which it is set.\n\nAnd Get Carter is such a case in point.\n\n______________________________________\n\nNote: This ended up being quite a Â long post, as I wanted to include some new information that I’ve recently discovered about Get Carter, as well as providing some biographical background and anecdotes about Michael Klinger and from Tony Klinger.\n\nBut some of you may want to get to the key answers straight away, so here are some quick page jump links that you can use to get to the relevant sections:\n\nClick link to go to: Tony Klinger reveals how THAT line became part of Get Carter\n\nClick link to go to: An explanation of where THAT line originated\n\n______________________________________\n\nGet Carter [1971] Â\n\nA year or so ago, I carried out a study of the racecourse scene in Get Carter [1971]. I was intrigued by the cinematography and the way that the tension gradually builds as the scene unfolds.\n\nYou can read that article here:\n\nGet Carter – The Racecourse Scene [1971]\n\nBut the other factor that drew me to this scene was undoubtedly the dialogue and THAT famous line.\n\n“Do you know, I’d almost forgotten what your eyes look like, they’re still the same, piss-holes in the snow.”\n\n– Â Jack Carter [Michael Caine] to Eric Paice [Ian Hendry]\n\nTo really appreciate it, though, I suggest you watch the whole scene to see and hear the build-up and context in which it was delivered:\n\nVideo above: The Racecourse Scene – Get Carter [1971]\n\nDialogue – Script Extract\n\nJack Carter: So you’re doing alright then Eric…you’re making good.\n\nEric Paice: Making a living.\n\nJack Carter: Good prospects for advancement is there…a pension?\n\nPicture: Eric Paice (Ian Hendry) – sunglasses removed!\n\nThen the classic line! Jack Carter slowly removes Eric’s sunglasses, hands them back to him and then stares straight into his eyes:\n\nJack Carter:Â Do you know, I’d almost forgotten what your eyes look like, they’re still the same, piss-holes in the snow.\n\nEric Paice: Still got a sense of humour.\n\nJack Carter: Yes, I retain that Eric.\n\nTony Klinger – On His Father, Michael Klinger, Repulsion, Catherine Deneuve, Get Carter And THAT Famous Line\n\nA few weeks back, Tony Klinger, ‘dropped by’ on the Ian Hendry Appreciation Society Facebook Page and shared a unique insight into the film and THAT Â famous line.\n\nTV and film seems to be synonymous with the Klinger family.\n\nHis father, Michael Klinger, was the producer and the driving force behind what many regard as the greatest British Gangster film of all time, Get Carter.\n\nPicture [l-r] Mike Hodges [Director], Michael Caine and Michael Klinger [Producer].\n\nIan Hendry had first met both Michael and Tony a few years earlier, during the filming of Repulsion [1965], directed by Roman Polanski. Tony wasÂ just 15 years old at the time.\n\nThe Michael Klinger Papers are held by the University of West England. On their website they mention that:\n\nBorn in 1920, the son of Polish Jewish immigrants who had settled in Londonâs Soho, Klingerâs entry into the film industry came via his ownership of two Soho strip clubs, the Nell Gwynne and the Gargoyle – that were used for promotional events such as the Miss Cinema competition and by film impresarios such as James Carreras – and through an alliance with a fellow Jewish entrepreneur Tony Tenser, who worked for a film distribution company, Miracle Films.\n\nKlinger and Tenser were both highly ambitious, but culturally divergent. Characteristically, when Roman Polanski arrived in London and approached the pair to obtain finance having failed elsewhere, it was Klinger who had seen Knife in the Water (1962) and therefore gave him the opportunity, and the creative freedom, to make Repulsion (1965) and the even more outrÃ© Cul-de-sac (1966). Although Repulsion in particular had been financially successful, and both films won awards at the Berlin Film Festival that conferred welcome prestige on Tekli, Tenser, always happier to stay with proven box-office material, sex films and period horror, saw Polanski as at best a distraction and at worse a liability. These differences led to the break-up of the partnership in October 1966.\n\nKlinger set up a new company, Avton Films and continued to promote young, talented but unproven directors who were capable of making fresh and challenging features: Peter Collinsonâs absurdist/surrealist thriller The Penthouse (1967); Alastair Reidâs Baby Love (1968), another film that focused on a sexually precocious young female, but with an ambitious narrative style that included flashbacks and nightmare sequences; and Mike Hodgesâs ambitious and brutal thriller Get Carter (1971). Although Get Carter is now routinely discussed as Hodgesâ directorial triumph, it was Klinger who had bought the rights to Ted Lewisâs novel Jackâs Return Home because he sensed its potential to imbue the British crime thriller with the realism and violence of its American counterparts and who had succeeded in raising the finance through MGM-British all before Hodges became involved.\n\nIn his excellent interview with Cinema Jam, Tony explained:\n\n“He [his father, Michael Klinger] learned to be a producer on theÂ job and it was this and the many productions of a huge variety of films that culminated in RepulsionÂ and Cul-de-Sac with director Roman Polanski that, as a result gave him the launch pad to become aÂ fantastic international producer, probably the most successful in the country for about fifteen years.Â My dad and I came into film making from opposite ends and for years there was a general lack ofÂ respect for each other. Iâd come from the floor of film sets and knew all the technical grades whereasÂ heâd learned the industry totally from the other end. It was only when someone suggested we workÂ together and as a result gained a lot of respect.”\n\nPicture: Tony Klinger\n\nTony KlingerÂ began his career as an Assistant Director on The AvengersÂ TV series. In his interview with Cinema Jam, Tony retells some wonderful tales about his life in show -business and gives some tremendous insights into his father, The following extract is from the interview in Cinema Jam:\n\n“I know I was working on the best and biggest budget show in the world. We were an American showÂ and often ABC executives would come over.Â The directors on the show were either the greatest coming up like rockets or the veterans on a gentleÂ slope down. People like Peter Yates, Charles Crichton, John Hough, DonÂ Chaffey andÂ Leslie Norman.\n\nMy partner, Mike Lytton and I used to borrow equipment from series we were working on at theÂ weekends, well borrow without asking but returning it all in one piece before anyone noticed. I wasÂ on The AvengersÂ and he was on Department SÂ or Randall & Hopkirk (Deceased). WithoutÂ thinking about it we created the best film school in the world. On The AvengersÂ we sometimes hadÂ five units shooting to keep up with the broadcast scheduling requirements out of New York. So whenÂ someone on staff fell ill, youâd be told to take their place and you either learned what to do really fastÂ or someone would take your slot and you went back down the ranks. It was an incredible experience.\n\nSuddenly from being a third assistant director I could do the odd day as a camera assistant or help outÂ with the sound department which proved invaluable for me later as a film maker. And at nights andÂ weekends, whenever no one was around we would be taking cameras out of the studio and shootingÂ our own tiny films and editing them overnight in the studio cutting rooms. I donât think anyone everÂ found out or maybe people just turned a blind eye to our nocturnal activities!”\n\nThe following two questions and answers come from the Cinema Jam interview:\n\nHow much has the industry changed in terms of securing the kind of deal that got a film like Get CarterÂ made?\n\n“Get CarterÂ still could happen today. It was a medium budget film for itsâ day and decisions like thatÂ could still be made by a brave executive like Bobby Litman who was then the newly appointed head ofÂ MGM Europe and we were lucky to know from his time as an agent. The timeline is impressive. FromÂ the day we first had the book, Jackâs Return Home by Ted Lewis in galleys to when the film was firstÂ released in cinemas was a total of 37 weeks. It was a classic case of the stars aligning and the perfectÂ storm.\n\nThe flat you see in the opening shot in Get Carter was found through a girl I was dating who knew aÂ British gangster who owned the place and was OK with our using it to film in.Â Euan Lloyd was not the same type of man as my father. Thatâs not meant to be a critique of Euan but ifÂ you read Andrew Spicerâs fine book about dad, The Man Who Got Carter, youâd soon discover theirÂ many differences. Michael Klinger was the best Script Editor and Producer and had a tremendousÂ ability to sell. Producers today have become more supplicant in their approach and there were only aÂ handful in my fatherâs day that had that gift, even less today. Itâs no accident that my father made soÂ many fine films when he was left to his own devices. He also could pick talent and nurture it.Â People financing films today tend to think in terms of the tax deals and soft money being the key toÂ making a film.”\n\nGet CarterÂ is the yardstick by which all subsequent British Gangster films are compared. Why do you think it has endured today?\n\n“Attitude. My old man came from Soho, which was a tough area at the time he was growing up in theÂ 1920s. It was effectively a Jewish village, next to an Italian village next to an Irish village, much likeÂ New York. Some people said that it would be fine in one area, but if you tried crossing the street to theÂ next area and you would have to fight. My father encountered a lot of gangsters between engineeringÂ and Film and at one point, when he ran a nightclub, some gangsters came along demandingÂ protection, but he chased them away.Â Real gangsters donât threaten, they just do. When I worked as a projectionist at fifteen, I was beingÂ threatened, but this one gangster came up to the guy doing it, whispered something in his ear and theÂ guyâs face turned pale and the trouble stopped.Â Scorsese has that attitude in GoodfellasÂ and itâs that attitude that has come across in Get Carter. ItÂ had never been covered in British Cinema up to that point, although there were examples likeÂ Brighton RockÂ that covered similar ground. Get CarterÂ also touched on Child Pornography andÂ other pornography.\n\nIt was shot in Newcastle and I was up there for two weeks. Part of the appeal wasÂ Newcastle and how it was, that was exciting and kind of untamed and very different from London. IÂ had the best time while filming our own locations for our documentary, Extremes. But being close toÂ the filming of Get CarterÂ confirmed me as a huge admirer of Michael Caine and a firm fan and friendÂ of director Mike Hodges.Â When it was first screened on BBC they cut it telling us they were doing the filmmakers a favour. TheÂ attitude was the big mistake with the Stallone remake, because that film was about redemption, whichÂ is the complete opposite to what the original film was.Â An interesting footnote to the film is that in the climactic scene, there is a ship in the background.Â Somebody actually tracked that ship afterwards, itâs entire history right up to four decades later whenÂ it was demolished for scrap. Thatâs what the word fan really means!”\n\nKlinger\n\nAnd THAT Famous Line From Get Carter? Tony Klinger Explains How It Came To Be Included In The Script…\n\nAs mentioned above, Tony visited the Ian Hendry Appreciation Society FacebookÂ Page and, unprompted, posted this:\n\n“The famous line from my dad’s production, “Get Carter” about Ian, “eyes like piss holes in the snow” was the way my grandmother used to describe me, which was then lent to the wonderful script written by my friend Mike Hodges.”\n\nSo there you have it from the ‘horse’s mouth’! It was Tony’s grandmother who provided the inspiration for what has become the memorable line from the film.\n\nI asked Tony if he remembered Ian and if he had any recollections from being on the set of Repulsion. His answer was candid and made me smile; it seems that he did remember meeting Ian, but at the time his main focus was elsewhere!\n\n“Ian wasn’t a good actor, he was, sadly for him, a great actor. That plus his love for a little something to drink and his penchant for speaking his mind, meant he was a triple threat. I’m pretty sure there were “stars” who didn’t want to work with him because he’d act them off the screen. But yes I knew and liked him from the set, but in Repulsion I have to admit that even as a kid I only had eyes for Catherine Deneuve!”\n\nI replied:\n\n“Thanks for sharing that, Tony – appreciate your insight. And I can understand how you might have been distracted a bit by Catherine Deneuve! Were you on location for the duration of the filming of Repulsion and Get Carter? And have you written about those experiences and, if so, could you share where? It’s quite something to have been on set for two films that both became classics I’ve come across some good pictures of your Dad on set, this is one of my favourites…”\n\nPicture [l-r]: George Sewell, Michael Klinger, Ian Hendry and Michael Caine.\n\nTony expanded a little more:\n\n“I am trying to limit my inputs about all the film set experiences I’ve had on both my own and my dad’s productions because, amongst other things, I have to keep some stuff for my own memoirs which I have recently started to write. Suffice it to say I was on the set for a week or so while I was filming my own documentary called Extremes in the same wonderful city of Newcastle. We were very busy having a great time. I was about 19 at the time and was easily distracted. Besides which our financier and distributor and executive producer thought we were in Glasgow. On Repulsion I was about 14 or 15 and was purely a visitor.”\n\nI shared a few more picture with Tony; of Ian with his father, Michael. They seemed to get on very well:\n\nPicture [l-r]: Michael Caine, Ian Hendry and Michael Klinger.\n\nPicture [l-r]: George Sewell, Michael Klinger, Ian Hendry and Michale Caine.\n\nPicture: The chairs – Get Carter [1971]\n\nAnd Tony’s closing thoughts to me were:\n\n“Great photos by the way. My dad really liked and appreciated your uncle.”\n\nOrigins\n\nAnd The Origins Of THAT Line..?\n\nPiss-holes In The Sand [and Rissoles In The Sand!]\n\nI dug a little deeper to try and find out more and it’s not quite as straight forward an answer as you might expect. But let’s start with Dylan Thomas.\n\nDylan Thomas [27 October 1914Â â 9 November 1953] spent much of his last few years reading his poetry, writing film-scripts and consuming vast quantities of alcohol on lecture tours across the United States. Just before he set off on his last trip across the Atlantic â he died in New York aged 39 â he wrote a comic, caustic account of the U.S. lecture circuit entitled âA Visit to America.â It is from a little-known collection of Thomasâ broadcasts for the BBC called âQuite Early One Morningâ and is a gem of a piece.\n\nIt was eventually broadcast by the BBC on 30th March 1954, some five months after his death.\n\nExtract:\n\n“And, in their diaries, more and more do such entries appear as, âNo way of escapeâ or âBuffalo!â or âI am beaten,â until at last they cannot write a word. And, twittering all over, old before their time, with eyes like rissoles in the sand, they are helped up the gangway of the home-bound liner by kind bosom friends (and all kinds and bosoms) who boister them on the back, pick them up again, thrust bottles, sonnets, cigars, addresses, into their pockets, have a farewell party in their cabin, pick them up again, and snickering and yelping, are gone: to wait at the dockside for another boat from Europe and another batch of fresh, green lecturers.”\n\nRissoles in the sand? I was confused.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nA rissole (from Latin russeolus, meaning reddish, via Â in which “rissoler” means “to [make] redden”) is a small croquette, enclosed in pastry or rolled in breadcrumbs, usually baked or deep fried.\n\nSo perhaps Dylan Thomas was referring to the eyes as being reddened and dry, as opposed to having any resemblance to pastry?!\n\nWhilst it works in the literary sense, it is clear that it is a euphemism for what Thomas probably wanted to say, Â to soften the words, which, after-all, were to be broadcast on the BBC.\n\nThomas had written a letter several Â years earlier [c.1932] which mentioned that:\n\n“I have the villain of a headache, my eyes two piss holes in the sand, my tongue like fish and chip paper….”\n\nSo here is a clear reference to a similar phrase, which describes feeling and looking unwell. And piss-holes was used, not rissoles!\n\nWhat is not clear is whether Thomas had created this phrase himself or whether he was merely repeating one that was in common use at that time. This theme and a theory is is returned to again below.\n\nWhat is clear, though, is that the quote he used related to sand and not snow.\n\nPiss-holes In The Snow\n\nThe first literary reference I could find for a similar phrase, that mentioned snow, was inÂ ‘Prince Bart – A Novel Of Our Times‘ written by Jay Richard Kennedy and published in 1953.\n\nKennedy writes:\n\n“Like the welcome?” Mills asked.Â “Isn’t worth a pisshole in the snow.”\n\nThis alludes to value, something being of little worth.\n\nSome have suggested that the phrase may have a military origin.Â That was certainly the view of one comment I saw on a forum online:\n\n“Piss-hole in the snow” is a negative assessment of value (around World War II) much like “rat’s ass” [which referred to ‘not giving a damn’].Â And “rat assed” also evolved to mean drunk, as did ‘piss-holes in the snow’.Â\n\nAnd that idea is further supported by a comment from Judy on the Facebook page:\n\n“Goes back at least to WW2, maybe even WW1, as a description of battle fatigue.”\n\nOthers have suggested that it was a British street-culture adaptation of a WWII expression that got picked up by writers and introduced into mainstream media. More likely, though, is that it entered into everyday use in it’s original unaltered form.\n\nWe also know that Tony Klinger’s grandmother was fond of using this expression with Tony, when he was a child growing up in London in the 50s. So whilst it was popular in the military during WWII, it is also quite possible that it’s origins predate that.\n\nPiss-holes In The Sand + Piss-holes In The Snow\n\n– Both Of Military Origin?\n\nThomas mentioned this phrase in a letter, so it seems unlikely that he created it and that it then entered into everyday use; his letters were only published many years later. It seems more likely that he took a phrase which was in everyday use at the time to describe his own condition. If it was in common use, then,Â I wonder whether it could have had a military origins too?Â Perhaps with the reference to sand, being used to describe a soldier’s battle fatigue from desert warfare?\n\nGiven that Dylan Thomas was using it c. 1932, if it’s roots were in the military, one theory is that it might have originated or been used extensively during the desert campaigns in the Middle East and North Africa in WW1. Some more ‘digging’ would be required, though, before we could be sure that that was the case.\n\nSo just to recap,Â piss holes in the snow has been used to describe something of low value, but also has the meaning of looking unwell/ suffering from battle fatigue.\n\nIt appears that it was a key phrase in the military and very similar to the expression used by Â Thomas c.1932; and quite possibly amended to refer to Â battle fatigue in colder climates.\n\nAt some point, then, it’s likely that the two expressions were both in common use:\n\n‘Piss holes in the sand‘, as used by Dylan Thomas in his letter c.1932 [when clearly referring to feeling unwell, quite possibly from drink!] was probably already in common use at that time; gradually becoming the less well-known and used version.\n\n‘Piss holes in the snow’Â alsoÂ referred toÂ feeling tired/ battle fatigued and looking unwell [as well as something of low value]; but over time, it slowly won in the ‘popularity contest’ and became the phrase of choice.\n\nAnd then later on, possibly sometime after the second world war was over, it’s usage changed again or rather evolved. It was still used to describe someone feeling unwell/ looking tired, but rather than the cause being battle fatigue, it was the result of a hangover!\n\nOne thing that we can be sure of, though, is that in the film “Get Carter” (1971), the expression finally entered into the mainstream.\n\nAnd has remained there ever since.\n\n______________________________________\n\nMichael Klinger + Tony Klinger – Golan Heights In ’73\n\nPicture:Â “This was dad and me on an old burnt out tank trying to make the biblical love story of Rachel and Jacob just after the ’73 war on the Golan Heights. Not the best choice of venue for that particular production and one day worth at least one chapter in my memoirs.”\n\nA big thanks to Tony for ‘dropping by’ and sharing some of his memories.Â His memoirs will undoubtedly be fascinating and compelling reading.
