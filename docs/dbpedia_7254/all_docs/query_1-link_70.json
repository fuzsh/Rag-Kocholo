        "text": "2.1. Design and participants\n\nWe developed a survey assessing surgeons’ behaviors during the preoperative informed consent process. The survey was initially pilot tested with five surgeons from diverse specialties who acted as key informants and provided focused feedback on each question to test proper interpretation. They provided feedback on face validity, item phrasing, and guidance on how to assess surgeons’ behaviors through LEP patient scenarios. The 32-item survey took approximately 10 min to complete and included questions related to demographics, level of medical training, non-English language skills and their clinical use, language learning experiences, and reactions to hypothetical scenarios with LEP patients (Appendix). The survey was conducted anonymously to decrease response bias because we were asking surgeons about their compliance with hospital policy. The final survey was reviewed and approved by the Partners Human Research Committee. The survey was then administered between October 2013 and January 2014 through a secure online tool, Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) [20] and made available via email to the medical staff and trainees of all surgical specialties at an academic medical center in Boston, MA.\n\nThe hospital’s policy on interpreter services states that family and friends of patients should not be asked, suggested, or encouraged to interpret for LEP patients in non–life-threatening situations, unless the patient declines a professional interpreter. The hospital strictly prohibits the use of minors as interpreters [21]. The hospital provided language services for LEP patients and has a policy in place regarding the use of interpreters. The hospital has 25 staff interpreters who cover the major languages requested by LEP patients (e.g., Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, Haitian Creole, American sign language, Somali, and Vietnamese). In addition, the hospital has a contract with a large telephone interpreting company that provides access to interpreters in over 200 languages 24 h per day, 7 d per week. This high-quality service is convenient to access throughout the hospital.\n\n2.2. Measures\n\nSurgeons were asked to rate their non-English language skills using the adapted Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR) scale for physicians, which has been described in a previous publication [22]. Participants were considered fluent if they self rated as “excellent” or “very good” and nonfluent if they self rated as “good”, “fair,” or “poor” [23].\n\nAdditionally, the method of language assistance the surgeon selected in the hypothetical scenarios presented was noted. The options included using one’s own non-English language skills, calling a professional interpreter, using an ad-hoc (untrained) staff member, and, in situations where the patient was accompanied by family, the patient’s adult family member or child.\n\nSurgeons were asked how they would obtain informed consent from a patient with no English skills who presented in three hypothetical scenarios (See for schematic). First, a patient presented alone to the emergency department with an acute surgical problem, which required surgery within 4–6 h. Second, a patient who required the same type of acute surgical intervention presented to the emergency department with a spouse who spoke some English and a fully bilingual child. Third, the patient presented with the same family members to a clinic visit needing an elective procedure.\n\nTo assess whether time constraints and interpreter availability played a role in the surgeons’ responses to the scenarios, each hypothetical scenario was presented in two ways: with a professionally trained in-person interpreter arriving in <15 min or >15 min. This time interval was based on previous studies, which measured compliance with the National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health Care (CLAS standards) [24,25].\n\nSurgeons were also asked to provide open-ended responses to describe other situations in their practice where they needed to decide between using an interpreter or their own non-English language skills.\n\n3.3. Surgeons’ reported behaviors in obtaining informed consent for LEP patients (n = 48)\n\nshows the modes of communication reported by surgeons in the three scenarios regardless of fluency. The modes of communication were professional interpreter use, use of the surgeon’s own non-English language skills, use of untrained staff or family members as interpreters, and the potential use of a child as an interpreter. In all scenarios, when a professional interpreter was available within 15 min, they were more likely to be used than other modes of communication, but when the wait was >15 min, surgeons preferred their own non-English language skills over waiting for an interpreter. Surgeons were more likely to rely on children as interpreters in the acute surgery scenarios, when interpreters were not immediately available, and also used them in the other scenarios but to a lesser extent. The use of untrained staff and family members also increased when the wait for an interpreter was >15 min. However, surgeons used untrained staff or family members more in elective surgical situations compared with acute surgical scenarios.\n\nshows the effect of fluency on the different modes of communication. Surgeons who reported fluency in non-English languages relied more heavily on their own language skills compared with nonfluent physicians, and this difference became more pronounced in scenarios where waiting for a professional interpreter would take >15 min ( ). This reliance was strongest when the patient had acute needs but persisted in nonemergent settings. Nonfluent surgeons consistently reported using their non-English language skills, even when a professional interpreter was readily available. This reliance on their own non-English language skills was most frequent (80%) when there were no bilingual family members accompanying the patient and waiting for a professional interpreter would take >15 min ( ). Nonfluent surgeons used professional interpreters (in-person or by telephone) to obtain informed consent from LEP patients more frequently than fluent surgeons, but this difference was less pronounced when there were family members (including minors) present, and in elective surgical scenarios ( ). Neither fluent nor nonfluent surgeons reported using untrained staff to obtain consent when a professional interpreter was available within 15 min in acute surgical scenarios, but untrained staff were used by nonfluent surgeons when a professional interpreter was not readily available in this scenario ( ). Fluent surgeons only used untrained staff or family members to obtain consent in elective surgery when the professional interpreter was not readily available. This scenario (elective surgery when professional interpreter not readily available) was also when nonfluent surgeons most frequently (22%) used untrained staff or family members to obtain consent; they continued to use them, but to a lesser extent (6%–12%), in other scenarios ( ). Twenty-nine percent of nonfluent surgeons reported they would use a minor to interpret the consent for an acute surgery if a professional interpreter was not available within 15 min compared with only 10% of fluent surgeons ( ). Eleven percent and 7% of nonfluent and fluent surgeons, respectively, reported that they would use a bilingual minor to obtain consent even if a professional interpreter was available in <15 min. They continued to use bilingual minors in elective surgical scenarios, but to a lesser extent.\n\nWhen asked to provide open-ended responses to describe other situations in their practice where they needed to decide between using an interpreter or their own non-English language skills, two themes emerged. The first was one of deferring to patient and family preferences. One surgeon wrote, “I always offer the patient an interpreter and very rarely do Spanish speaking patients prefer it.” Another wrote, “For some rarer languages where I do not speak the language and no interpreter is readily available a family member usually starts translating. I usually do not feel comfortable with this situation, but even offering the interpreter is difficult since the person translating the request is usually the same family member who is annoyed that you won’t use them and get the visit going.”\n\nA second theme that emerged from responses involved applying different thresholds for different clinical scenarios. Surgeons seemed to create their own thresholds for when they would request professional interpretation, instead of applying a standard policy. One surgeon wrote, “never in situations where I am obtaining consent. My Spanish is good enough to get a decent [history and physical examination] and explain simple concepts, but I want someone fluent to help me gain consent.” Another wrote, “I think [using family or staff members as interpreters] is effective, the communication seems good and the patients seem to understand and seem pleased with the personal direct communication. Same for the staff at our hospital. If it is not working I backtrack and get more qualified help.”\n\n4.1. Study limitations\n\nAlthough this study has important implications for the care of LEP patients in the surgical setting, there are some important limitations to consider. The survey had a low response rate and sample size, limiting the strength of associations that we could derive from our analysis. However, studies have shown that survey response rates among physicians are notoriously low and our results are in line with previously reported response rates for physician surveys [35,36]. Although there were no funds for incentives, future research could use monetary incentives to improve the response rate for this population. Furthermore, there may have been selection bias of the participants, favoring those with a particular interest in the LEP patient population. Participants who are interested in language barriers may have an understanding for the implications of using their non-English language skill and may have provided answers that were in line with institutional policies rather than their actual practices with patients. However, despite this potential bias, respondents still openly reported behaviors in contravention of institutional policy, such as those regarding the use of minors. Our survey did not address surgeons’ awareness of hospital policy, but it is possible that the use of minors reflects a lack of awareness of the policy. This suggests that our results may in fact be an understatement of the problem. The study participation was limited to one academic medical center in an urban setting, which may not be representative of national physician and patient demographics. However, our findings do offer insight in to the behaviors of surgeons during preoperative informed consent, and, thus, can be helpful in developing interventions for improvement."
