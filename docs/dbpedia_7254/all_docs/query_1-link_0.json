        "text": "Due to deep accents of some characters, the film was partially dubbed for the US release to allow Americans to understand what the characters on screen were saying.\n\nThe UK cinema release was cut to get an \"X\" rating by the BBFC with the stabbing of Albert edited to remove some shots of the knife. Director Mike Hodges later admitted that \"The less you see of the knife, the more effective the scene is\". The cuts were waived in 1993.\n\nThe German theatrical release in 1971 had cut 9 minutes from the movie (mainly the introductory, pre-title scenes and the scenes in the long bar when Carter arrives in Newcastle). In a restored version broadcast on Swiss TV in 2021, the restored scenes are kept in the original language, featuring german subtitles as they were not included in the original dubbing."
