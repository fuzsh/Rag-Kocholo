        "text": "Mike Hodges’ North East set thriller, starring Michael Caine in one of his most iconic roles, is a British cinema classic, and now looks and sounds better than at any time since its’ original release in 1971 thanks to this lustrous new restoration by the British Film Institute…\n\nAn iconic work of British cinema featuring many of the North East’s own cultural landmarks, Mike Hodge’s touchstone film stars Michael Caine as Jack Carter, a London gangster returning to his hometown of Newcastle in the wake of his brother’s sudden death.\n\nDetermined to bring his brother’s killer to justice, Carter sets out on a ruthless path of revenge through the murky underbelly of the city, clashing with a mysterious crime syndicate who may be responsible for his brother’s demise, and who certainly aren’t keen on Carter making it out alive.\n\nBoasting an extraordinary sense of place and a uniquely charged atmosphere, Get Carter is an often-imitated, never bettered touchstone of the crime genre.\n\nThe definitive British gangster picture, Mike Hodges’ brilliant film is every bit as thrilling, unflinching and gripping as it was on its first release some five decades ago."
