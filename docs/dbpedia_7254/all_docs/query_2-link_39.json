        "text": "The lights go down, an actor's face fills the broad screen, a monologue begins. He is an instantly winning character - he brings laughter and a mild shock and, by the time the film proper begins, a new star has been born.\n\nThirty-seven years ago, in the famous summer of 1966, it was Michael Caine, turning round in a cab to address the camera in Alfie. Today, it's Dylan Moran. Michael Caine - Sir Michael Caine - has ceded centre stage to the young Irish comic, and is waiting in the wings, for the second scene. And he plays not a spy, nor a playboy, nor a redcoat, nor any kind of hero, but an ageing English actor, a proper self-loathing thesp, needful and wheedling and beset with thwarted ambition ('Am I too old for Hamlet?'), and scornful of his life's profession ('Acting isn't real because nothing's at stake.') And he doesn't get the girl.\n\nAnd he's quite aware of the resonances. 'Do I know these old actors? Oh God, yes, still going on proudly about their shoes coming from Lobb, which they've been wearing for 35 bloody years! Know old actors? I am an old actor.'\n\nAnd he doesn't begrudge Dylan the meaty young role, not one bit. Instead he leans across eagerly to hear what I thought of the The Actors, a Conor McPherson/Neil Jordan comedy set in Dublin - particularly what I thought of Dylan ('Isn't he great? Isn't he going to be great?') And he quizzes me intently on accent, for their characters have to play various Irish, Cockney and Scots villains; how did Dylan do with the Scots yob? I tell him he had the accent bang on and he sits back in relief and spills his coffee.\n\n'It's the only one actors are really worried about. A Scots accent is the hardest to do in the English language. It's a nightmare. Unless you're Scottish. It's too easy to come out as a caricature. If I did it I'd come out sounding like Sean. I mean, sounding like a caricature of Sean. Now look at that, I've gone and spilt my fucking coffee. Excuse my language.'\n\nAll of this, of course, is delivered in one seamless cultured-Cockney monotone, dry and deadpan and famed in cinemas throughout the world, so much so that it can be a mild shock, at times, looking up from my notebook, to be reminded that I am not in the room with someone doing an impersonation of Michael Caine, but with Michael Caine.\n\nFriends have spent the preceding day giving me impressions. Not many people know that. You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off. Oi, who threw that blahddy spear at me? The middle one, from The Italian Job, was real enough and, in fact, was recently voted the greatest one-liner in the history of cinema, ahead even of 'Frankly, my dear, I don't give a dam.' The other two are fiction; the spear quote, of course, purports to come from Zulu, in which Caine shed his accent for one of the few times in his career, playing the upper-class Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead. Peter Sellers was responsible for not-a-lot-etc, having recorded his impression of his friend Michael saying this on to what must have been one of London's first ansaphones. In a way, however, the tiddling facts don't matter. As with Cagney, Wayne and his friend Sean Connery, it's not what Caine says but the delivery, and the character behind it, that builds the icon.\n\nPeachy. Harry. Jack. Alfie. Maurice Joseph Micklewhite, the mouthful from the Old Kent Road who abbreviated first to Michael Scott and then to Michael Caine, liked them all in their own ways, even though they never won him the best-actor Oscar he says he still craves.\n\nPeachy Carnahan, fighting in the wilds of Kafiristan in The Man Who Would Be King; Caine still smiles at the memory of working with Sean Connery, John Houston and, by proxy, Rudyard Kipling.\n\nHarry Palmer, anti-hero of The Ipcress File, and unlikely retro-style guru for current readers of lad mags.\n\n'It's funny, that,' says Caine, 'because one of the things I liked about Harry was that, in a way, he was the antithesis of Bond. He shuffled and he scowled and he wore specs. I was someone who had an impairment - I was short-sighted, not perfect.\n\nI've made a whole career out of playing real, imperfect people, rather than being a film star.\n\n'It's one of the reasons I took on The Actors, apart from the script, which I just loved: it's so rare to come across a good comedy script. The character is not particularly likeable. But you can do some of your best work that way, rather than always looking to play someone grand and heroic. Look at my character [sleazy Ray Say] in Little Voice. Or take About Schmidt, the character that Jack [Nicholson] plays - and I know Jack absolutely loved doing that.'\n\nLondon gangster Jack Carter was another breakthrough, showing the British gangster in a different light, although Caine now has reservations about aspects of the culture it helped spawn. He is too respectful of fellow filmies to actually mention Guy Ritchie by name, but he says, 'The thing about gangsters in films these days is that they're either funny or they're stupid. Well, I'm sorry, but I've never met a gangster that's either. And I come from something of a gangster milieu. Nor have I met someone who deals out violence for violence's sake. The violence in Get Carter was incisive, fast and over. One blow, one shot, one hit, what was necessary. No one smashed people up in a sadistic fury.\n\n'Although, to be fair, we got things wrong, too. A gangster did come up to me once and say, \"Get Carter was a lot of crap. He didn't have a family. We all have families.\" I didn't argue long with him. For the obvious reasons. But also, actually, he had a point.' Caine is also outwardly polite about the recent Get Carter remake by Sylvester Stallone, confining himself to a quiet smile and one word. Although it does help, I suppose, that the word is 'disaster'.\n\nAnd there was, of course, Alfie. A stunning, shocking, visceral and, on the surface, reekingly misogynist piece of cinema that burst on to the 60s film scene like the Stones did to the musical stage. Caine insists, now, that it wasn't as misogynist as some view it.\n\n'In fact, Alfie is the one who suffers most from himself. And one of the main lessons from it was anti-abortion, against that terrible idea of back-street abortion. Two actors turned it down because of that.\n\nI thought we should do it because of that. And yes, it caused a few problems. Apart from anything else, the film posters all said, \"Michael Caine is Alfie.\" And people became became convinced I was that character. Far from it. I mean, I have known Alfies. I have known three Alfies in my life. And none of them was me.'\n\nDespite the sweet theme song and Caine's boyish charm, it remains a hauntingly sad movie, not least for what happened later to Vivien Merchant, who played Lily, the married woman who had to abort Alfie's baby. Merchant was left distraught when her husband of 20 years, Harold Pinter, left her for Antonia Fraser. She died, a chronic alcoholic, in 1982.\n\nBut it also launched Caine on a fast-changing Britain. Lewis Gilbert, who directed Alfie, has written: 'The premiere was at the Plaza, and the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and George Best were there. Suddenly young people were the centre of the world, not 30- or 40-year-olds.' And at the centre of it all was Michael Caine.\n\n'If the 50s were black and white, the 60s were technicolour,' he says now. 'And it wasn't just music and fashion, it was also the art, the literature. Pinter, Hockney. Great times.' And the 70s? 'Drugs ran the 70s.' How much did he indulge? 'I smoked marijuana once, and laughed for five hours. I thought I was having a hernia. But I read that it affects your memory, which for an actor is a bloody disaster.'\n\nTalking of which, disasters did follow, disasters which he seems terribly happy to shrug off now rather than blindly defend. For each of his Oscar-winning and Academy-nominated performances - Hannah and Her Sisters, The Cider House Rules, The Quiet American, which incidentally sets him off on a lengthy and passionate discourse about the novels of Graham Greene - critics, mainly British critics, will point to The Swarm, or Beyond the Poseidon Adventure, or Jaws: The Revenge. Of the last, he has said simply, delightfully: 'I have never seen it but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built and it is terrific.'\n\n'I don't mind critics,' he says now, 'except when they're simply wrong. The worst are those who aren't really reviewing, they're just trying to make a name for themselves by saying \"Michael Caine can't act\" or whatever. But there are decent critics and once in a while you just have to take the criticism as it comes. Nothing terrible's happened. No one's dead.'\n\n'The public has always loved and appreciated him,' according to Barry Norman. 'But it's only now that the critics are coming around to the fact that he's a much better actor than they had given him credit for in the past.'\n\nSo what did he now think, at the age of 70 and playing a fine caricature of what he could, just possibly, have become; and with Oscars and turkeys and icons behind him in abundance; what did he think he as an actor was going to leave the film profession? What, if anything, had he been saying in his work? He pauses for a while.\n\n'I think that in The Actors, when I say it's a pointless profession... I don't really believe that at all. I think, now, it's a very important profession. Our job is to entertain you. To tell you something about events, no matter how small, and to tell you something about yourself.\n\n'But, more widely, the overall story of me is not about the films. It's about the acting. The possibility. The overall story of me is to have tried to tell every working-class kid in the country that you can do this.\n\n'Before those 60s films, all other British actors seemed Rada-trained. I know there were exceptions, but it certainly seemed that way. The first one I think that got it right, got the working-class right rather than making them jokes, was John Mills, in This Happy Breed. I mean, I know Noël Coward was fairly poncy about the working class, but at least he knew them. And then we came along with Alfie, The Italian Job and Get Carter and there was a sense of a new English guy being out there. Before they'd been neurotic, sappy: now they were winning, and getting the girl.\n\n'Also, you have to remember that when I was starting, no one I worked with wanted to be actors. They were all convinced they had the best lot, because they had a \"real\" job and they had money. I was the skint actor. I mean, it wasn't that I lost touch with people from the old days because I got famous. I lost touch because I didn't like to be the one who could never buy a bloody drink.\n\n'I had worked in a factory, too, done all the menial jobs, had the easy cash. And I could have done so for the rest of my life, but I was too intelligent for that. I'd also had the public libraries, the libraries in London. To go into these public places, for free, and realise by reading books that there was so much more - it had a massive effect on the feelings of helplessness.\n\n'Also, going to the pictures, when I realised they never had anyone playing anyone like me. Well, I thought, I could do that. And I did. And without wanting to be too grandiose, I think that did make a difference - along with everything else that was changing. Young people are far less likely now to suffer from that \"Who do you think you are?\" syndrome, constantly being pushed down because of your origins. One of the legacies of those times is that, in general, young people are much brighter than we were at that age. Not just brighter, more gutsy, willing to try new things. And I suppose I like to think, in the end, that I helped young British men to identify. I suppose I mean young English men. The Scots had Sean. I'm always like them on the screen. I'm not like some great big film star.'\n\nCaine speaks of his 'intelligence' not with arrogance but as an apparent matter of fact - he doesn't blink, or raise ironic eyebrows, or spill any more coffee, but simply asks us to believe it. Nor does it come across as snotty: it can be charming to hear someone so secure. Especially from the world of Hollywood. He has spoken before of this, tellingly, when explaining how he was almost fired from Zulu. He had copied the Duke of Edinburgh's affectation of clasping his hands behind his back, but the producers thought he just didn't know what to do with his hands. 'And I thought, \"Boy I'm in the business, I'm ahead here because I'm dealing with dummies. I'm actually smarter than the guys who are running this show!\"'\n\nHe has stayed ahead of them, most of the way, since then. Broke at 29, a millionaire by 31. Marriage in 1973 to Shakira, the former Miss Guyana whom he first saw on a coffee ad and determined to marry; they have been together ever since. 'I have a home in Surrey and that's where I love to be. I'm very into my gardening and my family. I've had about five big houses, since I made some money, and there's a flat in Chelsea Harbour, but I adore Surrey.'\n\nHe bolted to America, and raised some hackles here, when he was being taxed at 85 per cent; today he's unrepentant for the move, but happy to have returned.\n\n'I lived in Los Angeles, so eventually I got homesick for the seasons. And I still have good friends there, but I suppose I did miss the irony.'\n\nThere have been sadnesses along the way. His beloved mother Ellen's death in 1989 and the revelation in 1992 that, before she was married, she had borne an illegitimate epileptic son, David, who was put in an asylum. She had never revealed his existence and had paid him secret visits every week while pretending to shop. When he found out, Caine immediately visited his 67-year-old half-brother and arranged for him to be moved to a better home - within months he, too, was dead.\n\nTen years on from that time, and he does seem, at last, happier in his own skin than before. The legendary chippiness, which famously came to the fore at the time of his Bafta honorary fellowship in 2000, when he berated the 'establishment' - arguing, 'I never really belonged in my own country in my own profession. All the way through I felt on the outside' - is, if not gone, then rather well hidden. He oozes charm, and loves his life - 'I thank God every day, I wouldn't have chosen to do anything else' - and, if the truth be told, is probably an integral part, now, of the new British establishment, though he won't thank you for saying it.\n\nDid he see Britain as a better or worse country than that he remembers from those 60s days?\n\n'Almost undoubtedly better, because of the chances I've been speaking about, the disappearance of false boundaries, the raising of expectations. Although, strangely, one of the odd things about the country today, odd for me to say it, is the obsession with celebrity.\n\nI do regard that as a little bit dangerous. Everyone expects too much of you, too much perfection. And then you get the shock headlines when you realise they're normal, we're all normal - J-Lo's got cellulite shock, and the rest - well, frankly, who gives a shit?'\n\nHow does he cope himself with daily recognition. 'I normally have a baseball cap and that helps. I've left it in the car today.' He grins. 'Tell you what though, I don't often have to stand too long for a taxi.\n\n'And, look, one of the good things about this position, today, is that I can look for good scripts. I like work. I don't have to do it, I really don't. But I like it. So I'll look for something completely different. Something I haven't done before or, occasionally, something I haven't done for a long time. Or something, like The Actors, which is genuinely funny, because that's one of the hardest things to do; the more you try to be funny, the less you're funny. This one works, I think: I haven't seen the final version yet.\n\n'I got to work with some great people. I got the chance to do Richard III. Camping it up as a Nazi. I also got the chance to have fun. Which is much underrated.'\n\nThe Actors is something of a curate's egg of a film. It is very funny in parts. Dylan Moran is terrific, as is Michael Gambon, and Caine fills every scene he steals with his eyes, and the thoughts hooded therein, but the plot lurches and jars in places. Not his fault, and it won't be his last film. What still awaited?\n\n'I've still never won the best-actor Oscar. That would be... good. And I am thinking of doing my own film, a thriller, which I would want to produce and direct myself.\n\n'But I think I'm getting beyond that need to prove myself, prove myself to the establishment, that you talk about. Yes, the main difference between here and America is still class and I do still get a bit fed up with critics who still go, \"Cocky old Mike's not going to fool us, he can't really act,\" as a way to keep proving my place in the British class system.\n\n'But I recently won the London Film Critics' Award for best actor, which really truly means something, I promise. I will never change my accent. And...' he grows quiet, unusually so, for the first time. 'Ah well. I suppose I've also gone through a sort of barrier, now. I mean, frankly, what's the criticism going to do to me now? Ruin me? I'm happy, I do not want, and I do the best I can.'\n\nHe's come a long, long way, at last, from Alfie, last seen angry, shocked and cursing the injustice of the world when he walked in on Ruby, the blousy older woman played to perfection by Shelley Winters, to find another man in her bedroom.\n\n'What's he bleedin' got that I haven't?' he asks. 'He's younger than you are,' she says softly. 'You got it?'\n\nHe's got it. And, this time, he doesn't mind at all."
