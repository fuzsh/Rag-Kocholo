        "text": "by MIKE ORLOCK\n\n[email protected]\n\nUniversal Studios marketing execs assure us, the movie-going public, that their new summer blockbuster Twisters (PG-13) is not a âremakeâ or a âreboot.â Rather, itâs a âstandalone sequelâ to the 1996 film Twister, which sucked up half a billion dollars at the box office and delivered some of the most memorable weather movie memories since Dorothy found herself lifted off to Oz.\n\nI am not sure why the distinction is necessary; maybe it has something to do with profit-sharing among the original production team, which included Steven Spielberg. Still, adding an âSâ to the title was a stroke of genius. We know before the lights dim exactly what weâre going to get: more tornadoes, doing more of what tornadoes do.\n\nWe also get a whole new cast of characters with no relation to anybody from the first film â no grandson or daughter or brother-in-law looking to carry on the family tradition of racing recklessly into a tornado instead of away from it. Thatâs not to say that this new slate, featuring some of the most attractive actors working these days, doesnât bear a remarkable similarity to the lineup that included Helen Hunt, Bill Paxton, Jami Gertz, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Cary Elwes.\n\nItâs as if the writers, Mark L. Smith and Joseph Kosinski, reshuffled the deck of personality types and realigned their relationships. Weâre still in Oklahoma. Weâre still watching the sky for dark clouds and anything that might come crashing down from them, like a semi truck or a tractor combine. There are just different people in the pickup.\n\nThis new iteration, call it what you will, stars Daisy Edgar-Jones (Kya in Where the Crawdads Sing) as Kate Carter, who bears some resemblance to Helen Huntâs Jo from the first film. Sheâs a meteorologist personally obsessed with cracking the code of violent weather.\n\nA close encounter with an F-5 (the most powerful storm on the scale) in the filmâs prologue leads to Kate working in the relative tranquility of the National Weather Service offices in New York City five years later.\n\nThatâs until circumstances lure her back to the windswept prairies of her childhood â âcircumstancesâ being an old colleague Javi (Anthony Ramos), the only other survivor of her team. He unexpectedly shows up in Manhattan with an idea that only Kate can bring to fruition, if sheâll give him a week.\n\nJavi has moved on from âDorothyâ (the gizmo that Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton were tinkering with in Twister) to high-tech 3D radar imaging.\n\nHe thinks itâll revolutionize the art of predicting and tracking violent weather, potentially saving countless lives. He needs Kate to help with field experiments by using her preternatural knack for finding tornadoes in the drift of dandelion fluff. Little does she know that Javi has other reasons for wanting to predict the paths of violent storms in Oklahomaâs âTornado Alley.â\n\nKateâs nerves are jangled when sheâs once again in the midst of threatening weather in the field â until she meets âScience Cowboyâ/âTexas Tornado Wranglerâ Tyler Owens, a man who is to meteorology what Alex Jones is to journalism. Heâs played by current Hollywood âitâ boy Glen Powell, whoâs at least an F-4 on the charm meter.\n\nTylerâs thing is driving into the vortex of a tornado with his wild bunch of thrill-seeking associates and firing rockets into the funnel in his souped-up truck. Itâs made him a YouTube sensation but appalls Kate, until she comes to realize that thereâs more to Tyler than juvenile stunts and a thick Texas drawl. Wanna play weatherman and guess which way the winds of romance will gust?\n\nOkay, so plot and character development arenât the reasons youâre buying a ticket to Twisters. Itâs the special effects, specifically the state-of-the-art special weather effects, that $100 million will buy these days, and they are impressive.\n\nSome critics, apparently with higher standards than mine, will tell you they are vastly superior to the ones on display 28 years ago, but I wouldnât go that far. I thought those flying cows in Twister were pretty cool. What we get here, though, is so convincing itâs scary, so pay attention to the â13â in the rating if youâre considering taking little kids along for the ride. This might keep them â and you by extension â up at night with the first rumbles of thunder in the distance.\n\nOne of the more interesting twists of Twisters is its director, Lee Isaac Chung. Heâs a Korean-American filmmaker who scored a big indie hit a few years back with Minari, an arthouse sensation that went on to earn multiple Oscar nominations, including for Best Picture and Best Director.\n\nHe might seem an odd choice to pilot a $150 million budgeted juggernaut of a movie, but he has a painterâs eye for the subtle interplay of light and shadow, which he put to great use in Minari, his autobiographical memoir of a Korean family looking to make it as farmers in Arkansas. One of the strongest elements in Twisters is the quietest: the cloud formations building on the horizon and the way the wind ripples across wheat fields. Those visuals help make this film an unusual one: a summer blockbuster with a soul. Whether itâs a sequel, a remake, a reboot or some other animal, Iâll leave for you to decide.\n\nTwisters will be in theaters for a while, and if you have an interest, I encourage you to see it on the biggest screen available. Otherwise, you will eventually find it streaming on HBO Max in late November, just in time to add some tornado to your Thanksgiving turkey.In another lifetime, Mike Orlock wrote film reviews for the Reporter/Progress newspapers in the western suburbs of Chicago. He has also taught high school English, coached basketball and authored three books of poetry. He finished his two-year term as Door Countyâs poet laureate in early 2023."
