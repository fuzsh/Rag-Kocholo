Chris Riley of the Get Carter Appreciation Society put me on the track of call sheets and movement orders for the ﬁlm, and Dave Watson of the Northern Screen Commission kindly made copies of these rare documents available to me. Amy Redpath allowed me to draw on research undertaken for her BA dissertation at De Montfort University, and Alan Burton gave me access to his interview with cinematographer Wolfgang Suschitzky. Michael Brady’s remarkable website inspired me to take the Get Carter locations trail, and Dorothy Malone at Dryderdale Hall supplied opulent accommodation and fascinating conversation. As well as a constant source of support and encouragement, my partner, Kara McKechnie, was a wonderful travelling companion and patiently indulged my need to ﬁnd the exact spots on the chilly beach at Blackhall where Eric and Jack met their maker (sad, eh?). I must also acknowledge my series editor Jeffrey Richards and commissioning editor Philippa Brewster for making this book possible, and give a special thank you to Mike Hodges, who answered my questions with good humour and made time to read through my manuscript and check it for factual errors. This was no easy task more than thirty years after making the ﬁlm, and should any errors have crept through, these are mine rather than Mike ’s. This book is dedicated to the memory of the late Ted Lewis and a condemned car park in Gateshead.\n\nForeword\n\nAsked to read the manuscript of this book, I was astonished by the amount of detailed research that has gone into it. Much of what the author has uncovered is ‘news’ to me – and would have been when I was making it – but then I made the ﬁlm ﬂying by the seat of my pants, driven by some sort of intuitive white heat. From being sent the novel, Jack’s Return Home, to ﬁnishing the cut ﬁlm took just forty weeks. It is salutary to be reminded of the process of creativity. For ﬁlm makers of my age inﬂuences have often become obscured. Ghosts in the machine. Pentimento. A ﬁlm seen just once in the distant past – and I mean just ‘once’ – for this was long before videos. Then you will come across it decades later – usually on  – and recognise where some ‘moment’ in one of your ﬁlms has come from. It is always startling – fact and ﬁction occupying the same territory in one’s brain – recognising our amazing ability to collect and store slivers of time. With that comes the realisation that originality is not quite what it seems. Until I read this book I was never conscious of the inﬂuence of American ‘westerns’ on my ﬁlms. I had forgotten that, alongside musicals, they were my staple diet when I was a young man – not surprising for an articled pupil bored out of his mind in a small-town accountant’s ofﬁce – but I have not seen one since the late s. Not even on  . I simply grew out of them – as I did musicals. I suspect this went hand in hand with my growing disillusionment with America. Yet they are undoubtedly in the compost of my life – and it seems they will out. I am ﬂattered that the ﬁlm gets such considered attention in this book, and grateful I matured before the advent of videos. They make it even harder to be original.

Horatio in William Shakespeare, Hamlet (c. ), .ii.–\n\nSome truths can be held to be self-evident: bears defecate in forested areas; the Pope is uncircumcised; Get Carter () is the ﬁnest British crime ﬁlm ever made. Hold on: some truths take longer than others to become self-evident. It took almost twenty-ﬁve years for the critical orthodoxy to accept that the cult followers of Mike Hodges’ dark and downbeat tale of fear and loathing in Newcastle had some justiﬁcation for their reverence. Clearly, the ﬁlm had not changed, but something in the culture of its reception most certainly had. When Hodges spoke about his ﬁlm at a screening at the National Film Theatre on  September , he indicated that he had come to regard making a ﬁlm as ‘putting a message in a bottle ’, packing it with meaning and waiting for it to be washed up on some receptive shore.1 By the turn of the millennium, Get Carter was basking on the beach. This book will play the beachcomber. It will pick up the bottle, examine its contents and wonder about its origins. But it will also be interested in the beach and the tides that deposit its celluloid ﬂotsam and jetsam. In her  essay on the politics of ﬁlm canons, Janet Staiger pointed to a developing strand of ﬁlm studies that questioned the idea of a single ‘correct’ interpretation of any text, and ‘concentrated instead on how institutions and ideologies have established appropriate methods of\n\nGET CARTER\n\n4\n\nunderstanding a work’. This involved, she suggested, an analysis of ‘a politics that marginalises and devalues non-elite reading strategies’.2 Staiger’s concerns with reading communities, interpretive strategies and the politics of admission to institutional canons were never more relevant than in the case of Get Carter, a ﬁlm that has undergone a transformation from underground cult to overground classic. Staiger likened institutional anxieties about the dissolution or dilution of the ﬁlm canon to the fears expressed in Umberto Eco’s The Name of the Rose about ‘dwarfs with huge bellies and immense heads’ taking charge of the monastic library.3 Well, if the critical rehabilitation of Get Carter is anything to go by, the British Film Institute has recently become populated by rotund people of small stature. Its millennial poll of the great and the good of British cinema placed Carter among the top twenty treasures of the nation’s cinematic heritage. If Get Carter’s place among the pantheon of British cinema classics has only recently been established, its status as a cult movie has long been unquestionable. Anyone in doubt should visit the sumptuous Web site (www.btinternet.com/~ms.dear) that devotee Mark Dear operates as a shrine for the ﬁlm’s fans. Replete with poster reproductions from all over the world, rare stills, accounts of the ﬁlm’s shooting and critical reception, chat room, and prize awards for the winners of its trivia quiz, the site speaks eloquently of the enthusiasm of generations of Get Carter adherents. This enthusiasm is not conﬁned to the manipulation of a computer mouse. The Get Carter Appreciation Society marked the thirtieth anniversary of the ﬁlm’s location shooting by re-enacting various scenes in Newcastle and Gateshead on  July . Organised by Chris Riley, a Tyneside solicitor, the event centred on the decaying Owen Luder-designed car park on the corner of West and Ellison Streets in Gateshead, the scene of Carter’s murder of the ‘big man’ in ‘bad shape’, Cliff Brumby (Bryan Mosley). The car park had become ‘a monument to the ﬁlm’, said Riley, but was targeted for demolition to make way for new developments in the town. Now fully conversant with its cultural responsibilities, Gateshead Town Centre Regeneration announced plans to present the man who played Carter, Michael Caine, with a piece of concrete from the site once the bulldozers have done their work. A spokesman for the organisation acknowledged the solemnity of the occasion when he told the press on  August, ‘Get Carter was a great movie and there is a lot of affection for that car park.’ The growing signiﬁcance of the ﬁlm to a sense of local identity was acknowledged in January  when Newcastle radio station Century FM\n\n5\n\nCARTER IN CONTEXT\n\ndedicated a day to Get Carter, asking listeners to phone in with their memories of the making of the movie. Ultimately, cult movies are deﬁned by their appropriation by active audiences, but ﬁlms do not have an equal chance of being appropriated. Commentators have frequently noted that certain textual characteristics offer greater possibilities for cultish adoption than others. Movies that acquire a cult following are often challenging and confrontational in their style, imagery and themes. They will usually transgress genre boundaries, exhibiting an ‘unhinged’ quality, which revels in excess. Their narratives are likely to offer scope for metaphorical or allegorical interpretation, and may resonate with deep-seated cultural myths. More often than not, they will be highly self-aware, containing coded references and intertextual allusions that allow opportunities for detective work. Frequently, too, the cult ﬁlm will feature a charismatic protagonist or antagonist who becomes an unconventional object of identiﬁcation for viewers, provoking ambivalent feelings in the process.4 None of these characteristics is sufﬁcient in itself to guarantee cult status, but the accumulation of these textual aspects will increase a ﬁlm’s chances of adoption. Get Carter is a perfect example. CARTER AS TRAGEDY\n\n‘Tragedy is born in the west each time that the pendulum of civilization is halfway between a sacred society and a society built around man.’ Albert Camus, Selected Essays and Notebooks, Harmondsworth: Penguin, , p. \n\nGet Carter is a ﬁlm about crooks and, therefore, easily classiﬁed as a gangster or crime ﬁlm. Its narrative of a murder solved by a lone investigator in a city rife with corrupt practices links it to the hardboiled private eye ﬁction of Chandler and Hammett, and its nihilistic tone, amoral atmosphere and mise-en-scène of urban decay recall American ﬁlm noir. Commentators have also sometimes noted Get Carter’s afﬁnity to the western, and there are indeed close parallels in the ﬁlm’s narrative structure, mood of sombre determination, and emphasis on violent individualism.5 Its closest western genre antecedents are the personal justice sagas starring James Stewart and directed by Anthony Mann (Winchester ’ [], Bend of the River [], The Naked Spur [] and The Man from Laramie []) and continued by Budd Boetticher with Randolph Scott in the lead role (Seven Men from Now [],\n\nGET CARTER\n\n6\n\n. Caine is Carter. Publicity photograph.\n\nBuchanan Rides Alone [], and Ride Lonesome []). In Get Carter, too, the protagonist journeys to a wild place where ‘a man has to do what a man has to do’, in this case to avenge an attack on his family, even if it means his own death. In this ‘north-eastern’, the familiar iconography of the western genre is knowingly adapted to give Newcastle a frontier quality: gangsters cruising the town in Jags stand in for gunslingers on horseback, drinks are knocked back in a long saloon bar, a shotgun rests on top of a wardrobe, there is a conspicuous presence\n\nCARTER IN CONTEXT\n\n7\n\nof good-time girls and a conspicuous absence of lawmen. When a tough, taciturn loner rides into town, we know there is going to be business for the undertaker, just as we do in the ‘spaghetti’ westerns of Sergio Leone (A Fistful of Dollars [], For a Few Dollars More [], and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly []).6 To think of the terraces and back alleys of Tyneside as merely substitutes for the mean streets of Los Angeles or Dodge City, however, is to ignore the fact that the generic roots of Get Carter run deep into European soil. Its theme of family revenge goes back to Greek classical drama and the tragedies of Seneca (Thyestes, Medea and Agamemnon), but its most salient ancestry is the dark and violent theatrical tradition of revenge tragedies that begins with Jacobean plays like John Webster’s The White Devil (c. ) and The Duchess of Malfi () and continues to be revived in ﬁlms like The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover (Peter Greenaway, ) and Gangster No.  (Paul McGuigan, ). In Jacobean tragedy, the centre of violence and corruption is generally the court of the city state. Get Carter updates this trope by depicting Tyneside as a local state in which venality and the rule of force go largely unchallenged and, in Albany’s words in King Lear, ‘humanity must perforce prey upon itself ’.7 The nihilistic mood of Jacobean tragedy, and its pessimistic depiction of an anomic society being eaten away from within, transfers easily to the dawn of the s. Camus’ description of the conditions in which tragedy thrives as a dramatic genre – an era in which ‘man frees himself from an older form of civilization and ﬁnds that he has broken away from it without having found a new form which satisﬁes him’ – is as relevant to the end of the s as to the end of the sixteenth century.8 Both were periods of transition in which dominant cultures and moralities were forced to give ground to emergent forces. Get Carter’s lawlessness recalls an earlier Elizabethan age in which medieval conceptions of personal honour and private justice were being challenged by the extension of state power and a public administration of justice.9 Carter’s is a ‘blood revenge ’, the survival of a culturally sanctioned response to the murder of family members in the era before the codiﬁcation of law and the universal authority of the state. And, like the Elizabethan dramatists before him, Hodges is careful to link the theme of revenge with an attack on the corruption endemic in the local state and the sense of a society disintegrating and out of control. As he once remarked, ‘The ﬁlm is not just about the villain. It’s about observing the social structures and the deprivation of the country from which this character comes.’10\n\nGET CARTER\n\n8\n\nA similar vision of social dissolution and anomie had already been explored in Hollywood. Don Siegel had persuaded Clint Eastwood to discard his poncho to play a tough, unorthodox cop, a ﬁgure alienated from the city he visits in Coogan’s Bluff (). Eastwood would play much the same role for Siegel in Dirty Harry (), a ﬁlm made at roughly the same time as Get Carter. The closest afﬁnities with Mike Hodges’ ﬁlm, however, are to be found in an American movie made by the British director John Boorman. In Point Blank (), a coldly violent thriller adapted from a Donald Westlake novel, Lee Marvin plays Walker, a professional criminal dedicated to avenging the wrongs done to him by his wife and her gangster lover. The ﬁlm resembles Get Carter not only generally in its narrative structure, amoral atmosphere and sudden explosions of violence, but speciﬁcally in some of its textual details. Both ﬁlms, for example, have a sequence in which a man is thrown from a tall building and either lands on, or narrowly misses, a car below, and both feature the shooting of a man named Carter by a sniper. In the case of Point Blank, Carter is a crime boss who proclaims that ‘proﬁt is the only principle’, a doctrine to which Walker might also subscribe if he was not so obsessed with revenge. Since the heyday of Al Capone in the late s, American organised crime and its representation in Hollywood cinema have provided models of authenticity for British gangsters and crime ﬁlm-makers alike. In spite of the fact that the literary and theatrical deep structures of the crime story are British and European in origin, the American colonisation of the generic terrain of the gangster ﬁlm and its most authentic narrative and stylistic form – noir – have created a continuous challenge for British attempts to provide convincing representations of underworld activity. Consequently, the British crime ﬁlm has been among the most assiduous promoters of an authentic impression of place and, by extension, a strong sense of national cultural identity in ﬁlmic representation. Given the association of crime with an urban underworld, the evocation of place has been primarily focused on the city. In the late s, dramas like It Always Rains on Sunday (Robert Hamer, ), Brighton Rock (John Boulting, ), The Blue Lamp (Basil Dearden, ) and Night and the City (Jules Dassin, ) used location shooting to construct convincing portraits of the criminal milieu in London and the south of England. Ten years later, with the arrival of ‘Angry Young Man’ theatre and New Wave cinema, ﬁlm-makers began to explore north of England settings. Val Guest took his cameras to Manchester for Hell is a City () and Sidney Hayers went to Newcastle to shoot Payroll ().\n\nCARTER IN CONTEXT\n\n9\n\nTogether with more illustrious counterparts such as Room at the Top (Jack Clayton, ) and Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (Karel Reisz, ), these ﬁlms helped to direct attention to the northern conurbations as sites of both cinematic realism and social deprivation. In the emerging discourse of social progress, the cities of the north were cast as incubators of discontent, backward and puritanical enclaves that stiﬂed the spirit and frustrated cultural and sexual desire. Ambition necessitated a move south to the more libertarian environs of London. British cinema’s realignment with the capital city is neatly summed up in the two John Schlesinger ﬁlms Billy Liar () and Darling (), which effectively follow the fortunes of the characters played by Julie Christie as she ﬁrst breaks away from Bradford and then samples la dolce vita in London. British cinema’s relationship to ‘Swinging London’, however, was a problematic one.11 Left-liberal ﬁlm-makers found it difﬁcult to celebrate the wealth and hedonism London offered in the mid-s without unease and the residual feelings of guilt that are so often present in their movies. The long party that began when Julie Christie took the train to the capital in  began to ﬂag by the end of . The Beatles had split, England had relinquished football’s World Cup, and the Tories were back in power on a law-and-order ticket. One can sense a mood of desperation in Smashing Time (Desmond Davis, ), and the hangover is clearly evident in two British crime movies released in the same year as Carter: Donald Cammell and Nick Roeg’s Performance (ﬁlmed in ) and Micheal Tuchner’s Villain. Together with Carter, these ﬁlms take stock of the criminal underworld in the wake of the Kray twins’ imprisonment. But Get Carter might equally belong to a short cycle of ﬁlms that includes Cool It Carol (Pete Walker, ) and The Reckoning (Jack Gold, ), which take a jaundiced look at the relationships between metropolitan and provincial life. Although more overtly political than Get Carter, The Reckoning is strikingly similar in some of its iconography and narrative devices. An amoral northern boy, who has been successful in the city jungle of London, travels back to his home town and takes revenge for the death of a close relative, his father in this case. Like the Tyneside of Get Carter, the Merseyside of The Reckoning is presented as a wasteland of demolition sites and crumbling terraces. Stripped of a vital stimulus for progress by the migration of their brightest and best sons and daughters to the south, the once virile cities of the north have fallen into a slow decay. When the prodigal sons return, their drive to avenge the damage done to their families may be read as an attempt to\n\nGET CARTER\n\n10\n\nassuage that guilt they suffer as deserters of the communities that nurtured them. Ted Lewis, the author of the book on which Get Carter was based, was one of these errant sons, leaving his Humberside home for a bright-lights job as an art director for a London advertising agency. As a crime ﬁlm, Get Carter occupies a place in what has been critically regarded as a subordinate tradition in British cinema, but it is also linked to dominant traditions by Wolfgang Suschitzky’s naturalistic but imaginative cinematography. While the ﬁlm’s narrative approaches grand melodrama, much of its mise-en-scène is as realist as one might expect from a director and lighting cameraman with a background in documentaries. Get Carter demonstrates its classic documentary impulse in its desire for social exploration and its willingness to travel to a ‘heart of darkness’. Like the nineteenth-century instigators of urban sociology and the early followers of pioneering documentary ﬁlm-maker John Grierson’s urge to ‘tread dangerously into the jungles of Middlesbrough and the Clyde’, Hodges and producer Michael Klinger led their cast and crew into the wastelands of Tyneside.12 The poetic use of the realist style places Get Carter in a critically valorised strand of British cinema that runs from Robert Joseph Flaherty and Grierson through Reisz and Tony Richardson to Terence Davies. But, unlike much of the work in this tradition, Carter neither romanticises, celebrates nor encourages identiﬁcation with the working-class community it so convincingly depicts. Here, the documentarist’s gaze is neither pitying nor sentimental. Like J. B. Priestley’s English Journey almost forty years previously, Carter takes a hard look at the north, softened only by wry humour and an underlying resentment of injustice. In his discussion of poetic realism, Andrew Higson argues that, above all, it must have ‘emotional depth and integrity’ 13 and, in Get Carter, Hodges overrides any impulse towards the heroic depiction of ordinary people in favour of the kind of ‘imaginative truth’ championed by Humphrey Jennings.14 Forsaking the ideological certainties of ‘moral realism’, Hodges maintains the cool detachment of an anthropologist among cannibals. Rather than emphasising the warmth and good humour conventionally associated with northern urban life, he presents Newcastle as virtually a necropolis, a cheerless city of cofﬁns and hearses where the locals are suspicious and hostile. Fear, intimidation and betrayal are their staple diet. Suschitzky uses the bleak industrial landscape of Tyneside to express an oppressive sense of dereliction and a poverty of the soul, contrasting the belching chimneys and grimy terraces with the tawdry glamour of the bingo and dance hall and the uncompromising concrete slabs that pass for redevelopment.\n\nCARTER IN CONTEXT\n\n11\n\nThere is a match between the bleak and unsentimental moral universe that Carter inhabits and the world of civic corruption and neo-brutalism he visits, just as there is in American ﬁlm noir. The ﬁlm’s vision of the New Britain is one in which municipal pride has been replaced by individual greed, beauty by barren ugliness. For Hodges, his ﬁlm was sounding an alarm, warning the nation of how bad things were becoming: The country at that time had a totally hypocritical view of itself. It wasn’t what it was pretending to be. We thought the police were wonderful, that corruption was only an American phenomenon and American gangsters were horrible and ours were nice. Once I’d decided to tell the truth, I had to do it with the same ruthlessness as a surgeon opening up a cancer patient, remove every article of sickness and reveal it for what it is.15\n\nAs in the bleakest of ﬁlm noir, the world evoked by Get Carter is a predatory sea in which sharks prey on their own kind as well as the little ﬁsh. It is a cycle of death in which killers eventually become victims themselves. Michael Caine was himself conscious of how the class system under which he was brought up made it very difﬁcult for the children of the terraces and tenements to break the cycle of replication: ‘If you are born into that working-class milieu as I was and as virtually every violent criminal is, then you’re sure to want something different. And if the world hits you violently enough, then you will act in a violent way to alter your circumstances.’16 Like ﬁlm noir, too, Get Carter is fuelled by a dammed-up sexual energy that ﬁnds its release in violence and perversion. The ﬁrst line of the ﬁlm, ‘bollock naked with his socks still on’, sets the tone for its representation of sex as manipulative and consciously sordid. Carter turns the sexual libertarianism of its age on its head: ‘free love ’ is not a way of escaping repression, but rather one of its instruments. Love in Get Carter is rarely free from the taint of self-interest or commercial exploitation. Sex is a means to power, not least for Carter, the son who obsessively challenges the authority of the father by bedding the lovers of all of the ﬁlm’s crime lords. The expelling of bodily ﬂuids that takes place in Newcastle does not mean that the city should be viewed as a sexual playground but as a public convenience. The Jacobean tragedies that supplied the template for Carter’s revenging exhibited what Salgado has described as an ‘obsessive concentration on the purely animal aspects of human existence, eating, drinking, defecation and copulation’,17 and the\n\n. The gangster and the gangster’s moll. This publicity photograph of Michael Caine and Geraldine Moffat effectively connotes the film’s genre.\n\nCARTER IN CONTEXT\n\n13\n\nﬁlm shows a similar preoccupation with the basic functions of the body. Carter dismisses his home town as a ‘craphouse’, and toilets feature as much as bedrooms in the ﬁlm. Con (George Sewell), the London hood sent to retrieve Carter, is locked in an outside privy, and Albert (Glynn Edwards), the reluctant porn star, is knifed outside one. Sewers, a common metaphor for the morally tainted criminal underworld, are never far from the surface in Hodges’ vision of the city. THE CHARACTER OF CARTER\n\n‘Injuries are not revenged except where they are exceeded.’18 Seneca, Thyestes, II.\n\nLike Travis’s crusade in Taxi Driver (Martin Scorsese, ), Carter’s merciless assault on the rats of his urban sewer tackles the symptoms rather than the causes of moral decay and is inﬂected with the same hypocrisy. Carter apparently stands for the old world, the world of his childhood when family and community provided the city with a soul. His crusade is the reassertion, not of family values, but the value of family. The gangsters of Newcastle express their contempt for family relationships by murdering his brother and luring his niece/daughter into pornography. Carter sets out to make them regret this affront to his family name. But ironically, he, too, is infected with the malaise of his age. His value system is really little different from that of the men he pursues. He shows neither compassion for his victims nor much remorse for his crimes, and his hypocrisy about the value of the family is evidenced in his affair with his brother’s wife. In truth, he is less familycentred than self-centred. The abuse of his family is a personal affront, a challenge to his own reputation as a hard man. Signiﬁcantly, Hodges makes no attempt to show the event (the murder of Frank Carter) that triggers his protagonist’s drive for vengeance. In this way, the director loosens the empathic bond that ties the viewer to the revenger in most dramas of this type. Carter’s cold rage is never given the emotional support the depiction of the crime committed against his brother might draw from audiences. Moreover, Carter’s fraternal relationship to the victim suggests that his wrath indexes loyalty due to another member of a homosocial order rather than the wider heterosocial order of the family. Michael Caine saw his performance as an ethnographic exploration of the moral beliefs and social mores that underlie the gangster’s presentation of self:\n\nGET CARTER\n\n14\n\nThe problem with a lot of British gangster ﬁlms is that the gangsters are portrayed either as funny or stupid. But real gangsters are neither. I should know, ’cos I grew up with them. The razor gangs down the Elephant and Castle. They’re serious blokes. Serious and bright. And very scary. That’s how I played Carter. Of course he ’s a villain. But he doesn’t regard himself that way. He doesn’t see himself as a bad man. He might do bad things. But he feels completely justiﬁed.19\n\nCarter rails against the corrupt world but, ultimately, can transform neither the world nor himself. In this he strongly resembles the malcontent of Jacobean revenge tragedies, the ﬁgure Jonathan Dollimore labels the ‘contradictory Jacobean anti-hero’ and describes as: malcontented – often because bereaved or dispossessed – satirical and vengeful; at once agent and victim of social corruption, condemning yet simultaneously contaminated by it; made up of inconsistencies and contradictions which, because they cannot be understood in terms of individuality alone, constantly pressure attention outwards to the social contradictions of existence.20\n\nDollimore notes that the malcontent he is describing not only serves as a means of exposing a malaise at the heart of the social order, but constitutes ‘a prototype of the modern discontented subject’.21 Carter embodies Dollimore ’s contradictory revenger striding blindly out of the s: a social sanitiser infected with the germs he seeks to sterilise, his righteousness compromised by his own corrupt morality. But this is no world for the righteous. Newcastle ’s mean streets are not for knights to go. Carter, unlike Raymond Chandler’s Marlowe, is himself mean without the slightest trace of chivalry. He is more Mike Hammer than Philip Marlowe – frequently described by those he encounters (and sleeps with) as a ‘bastard’ – but Hodges likes to believe that the character retains the vestiges of a moral conscience: ‘Carter had to be callous, but he knows he is sick, that he’s not like normal people. When he sees the car [with a woman in the boot] tipped into the dock, I see regret in his face.’22 The regret may not be obvious to all viewers, but the ﬁlm’s triumph is to raise this cold sociopath, against our better judgement, to the level of tragic hero. We might not go as far as Michael Caine did in a television interview and describe Carter as ‘an upstanding citizen with the right moral values’,23 but we ﬁnd it difﬁcult not to side with this character who, after all, is the only candidate for sustained audience identiﬁcation in the ﬁlm. We ﬁnd it hard not to respect Carter, although\n\nCARTER IN CONTEXT\n\n15\n\n. A family man? Caine with Petra Markham.\n\nhe does nothing to deserve it. We are tempted to admire Carter, although there is nothing admirable in his behaviour. Our identiﬁcation with the character is made guilty by the acknowledgement that we are colluding in murder. The revelation of Get Carter is the realisation of just how vulnerable our own moral codes have become. It was a revelation experienced by Hodges, himself, when he ﬁrst viewed his creation with its intended audience: ‘I had assumed that, like me, the audience would hate Carter and would also be shocked by the ﬁlm. But what surprised and frightened me in many ways was that they actually liked him.’24 This identiﬁcation with a protagonist in a way that entails the suspension of conventional morality is a typical mechanism of cult movie appreciation.25 For the most part, Hodges scrupulously avoids standard mechanisms of identiﬁcation like the point-of-view shot, and frequently adopts a mediated view of his protagonist, but identiﬁcation is ultimately facilitated by the inevitability of the character’s fate (subtly suggested by Hodges and evident after the initial viewing), and the feelings of social estrangement he embodies. Dollimore points to the importance of this sense of estrangement in his social-psychological proﬁle of Vindice, the doomed protagonist of The Revenger’s Tragedy.26 Estrange-\n\nGET CARTER\n\n16\n\nment from society, Dollimore argues, provokes ‘an aggressive reaction; heroic or criminal it adds up to the same thing: a desperate bid for integration’. This bid is futile, however, because characters like Vindice – or Carter – are bent on destroying ‘that which they are within and which they cannot survive without’. The underworld is the air Carter breathes, and if he destroys or abandons it, he suffocates. This is why Dollimore argues that for the revenger to seek reintegration is to ‘embrace destruction’. This is the ‘vital irony’ that supplies Get Carter with much of its fascination and underlies the ‘subversive black camp’ with which revengers’ tragedies so often relieve their ‘deep pessimism’. It might be argued that the futility of Carter’s crusade positions him as a classic ﬁlm noir victim-hero. But if, in its moral bleakness and pessimism, the ﬁlm resembles much of the noir canon, Carter’s character breaks genre conventions. He is not the vulnerable man ensnared by a lethal spider woman, but a brick-hard killer who uses and abuses women as it suits him. Rather than a victim, he is a vortex that sucks all the characters he encounters into its downward spiral. His destruction conforms to the conventions of classical tragedy rather than to those of ﬁlm noir. Carter is a victim of his ‘fatal ﬂaws’, a manipulative and compassionless attitude to others, and an overbearing pride and arrogance that fuels his need to respond to any perceived affront and convinces him of his invulnerability. The faults in his character are a cipher for wider cultural ills, just as they are in Greek and Jacobean drama. As J. W. Lever wrote of the protagonists of tragedy in a book published in the same year Get Carter was released, ‘the fundamental ﬂaw is not in them but in the world they inhabit, in the political state, the social order it upholds’.27 If Carter is redeemed it is not by his willingness to give love, or even by the sentimentality he shows towards his kith and kin, but by his status as martyr for the social order he represents. Fatal though his ﬂaws may be, they continue to exert a powerful attraction for audiences, not least because in other circumstances they could so easily be construed as virtues. Carter is brave and tenacious, unshakably committed to his chosen course of action and conﬁdent in its execution, but above all he exhibits ‘a cool, ﬂip, tough arrogance ’28 that links him to contemporary protagonists like Harry Callahan (Dirty Harry), Walker (Point Blank), and Coogan (Coogan’s Bluff ) and continues to recommend him to new generations of viewers. ‘I modelled him on an actual hard case I once knew,’ Caine once revealed. ‘I watched everything the man did. I even saw him once put someone in hospital for eighteen months. Those guys are very polite, but they act right out\n\nCARTER IN CONTEXT\n\n17\n\nof the blue. They’re not conversationalists about violence, they’re professionals.’29 T H E C R E AT I O N O F C A R T E R\n\n‘You have to be ruthless. When you write you are drawing on your own emotions and relationships, your family and friends – and if this means you are exploiting people, well – it has to be done. My wife has come to terms with this now, I think – but my parents, for example, still ﬁnd it painful to be “used”.’ Ted Lewis, interviewed in .30\n\nJack Carter was the creation of Ted Lewis, a heavy-drinking commercial artist in his late twenties. Born in Manchester soon after the outbreak of World War II, he was brought up in Barton-on-Humber, where his father was a quarry manager. After attending Hull School of Art, he worked as a book illustrator, an animator and an art director at an advertising agency in London. In his spare time, he wrote stories with strongly autobiographical content. Hutchinson’s publication of his ﬁrst book, All the Way Home and All the Night Through, in , encouraged his literary ambitions, and he began to devote an increasing proportion of his time to his second novel.31 Jack’s Return Home was written in , a year of political turmoil in which the established order was subjected to a sustained attack by a young intelligentsia. But, although Lewis’s book may share some of the pent-up rage of the revolutionary left, it has none of its optimism or idealism. In spirit, it harks back two, three or even four decades to the hardboiled literary tradition of Black Mask magazine, and the radical cynicism of Dashiell Hammett and the sardonic detachment of Raymond Chandler. Lewis’s prose has something of the simplicity and directness of Hammett and the world-weariness of Chandler, but his story also resembles the criminal-centred narratives of second-generation hardboiled writers like Jim Thompson and David Goodis. The book is written in the ﬁrst person in the vernacular of Humberside, and manages to remain convincingly in character through to the end and the (probable) death of its narrator. In doing so, it conveys what Robert Murphy has called a ‘provincial authenticity’ that marries its American sensibilities to a line of British low-life thrillers by authors like James Curtis, Gerald Kersh and Arthur La Bern.32 The title Jack’s Return Home suggests the completion of a circle – the cycle of birth and death, perhaps – but the book offers little reassurance\n\nGET CARTER\n\n18\n\nin the rediscovery of the familiar. If it contrasts the unstable present with the securities of the past, it does so without much nostalgia. The past is a site of problems, the source of tensions in the present. Jack Carter’s memories of growing up in and around the (unnamed) steel town of Scunthorpe are never sentimental, although they do recall a world before disillusionment, before his moral fall. Carter is cynical enough to describe his home town as ‘a good place to say goodbye to’, and clearly has contempt for most of its inhabitants, but, beneath this local antipathy and his general misanthropy, there is a nagging sense of loss and a need to set things right ‘for the sake of past history’.33 Some of this past history is apparent in the glimpses we are given of his relationship with his brother Frank in the austere s, and the insights we gain into the reasons for their estrangement after Frank’s marriage to a woman Carter had slept with on the eve of the wedding. The family trauma around the parenthood of Frank’s daughter appears to have been at the root of Carter’s decision to move to London, where he became a professional criminal, and the emotional autism that seems to have followed. Most of the emotions Jack expresses are about his childhood. It is as if he has lost or repressed the ability to feel deeply about current acts and relationships, with the possible exception of his affair with his boss’s wife, Audrey. When he learns that his boss has been informed of the affair, he tells us that his ‘guts turned over’, but the reason may be shock as much as any amorous bond.34 Although he does not exhibit the ‘authoritarian personality’ of the classic fascist, the character with whom the ﬁrst-person narration effectively encourages us to identify has a world-view that would not have been out of place in Nazi Germany: he believes that the ends justify the means, admires bullies, despises the weak, uses people for his own purposes, regards women with misogynistic suspicion and yet valorises the idea of the family. Certainly, it is made clear that he kills without compassion or remorse as the following passage illustrates: ‘I looked down at Peter and stretched my arm out and pointed the shooter at his head. He stared up at me. His mind was almost gone with pain, but not enough not to know he was going to die. I shot him through the forehead and walked over to the TR.’35 The starkness of the prose is matched by the bleakness of the moral and behavioural world it describes. It is a parallel world of duplicity, conspiracy, egotism and sudden death that sucks in and entraps its participants, and it festers beneath the surface of even a small provincial town. In this world, the centres of power are difﬁcult to locate, and the\n\nCARTER IN CONTEXT\n\n19\n\ncourse of justice is rerouted by secret and venal relationships. Formal and legitimate authority is responsive to neither the needs of the people, nor the rule of law, but to the contradictory pressures of systemic corruption and fear of exposure. Consequently, justice is done only when it is in the spotlight and must be seen to be done. The Humberside of Jack’s Return Home – and, by implication, much of the rest of the country – harbours an undiagnosed sickness. The local state is secretly subject to the inﬂuence of ‘the governors’, a shadowy network of crime bosses, with links to London gangland, which also controls many apparently legitimate businesses. Although Lewis never names Scunthorpe, its identity is encoded in the names given to some of his characters: the cowardly (Scun)Thorpe and the ambitious Brumby (the name of the central business district of Scunthorpe). In writing his novel, Lewis was working through the unresolved conﬂicts of his own early years. In Carter, he created a fantasy alter ego to express the ruthlessness he admired in a writer but struggled to ﬁnd in himself.36 His widow has recalled that he had little discipline when it came to his work routines, and remained needful of the approval of his father.37 Although Lewis’s novel is a serious work, it was written as an ‘entertainment’, to use Graham Greene’s term, and conceived primarily as a commercial venture rather than a piece of social criticism. Lewis wanted to be a popular rather than a literary author, but he also craved critical recognition, as his distressed response to a negative reader’s report at Michael Joseph testiﬁes.38 There were few British antecedents, however, to prepare critics or readers for the unsettling journey to the dark side of Humberside provided by Jack’s Return Home. It is an uncompromising book that supplies the reader with few clues for its interpretation. With the exception of Keith the barman, there are hardly any characters who demonstrate attractive qualities and, while most may not quite deserve their fate, few earn our sympathy. Whereas Graham Greene, a novelist admired by Lewis, had used the gangster narrative to explore moral philosophy in books such as Brighton Rock (), Lewis withholds judgement on the underworld he so vividly evokes. His book generates the sort of moral vacuum that George Orwell condemned James Hadley Chase for creating in his notorious No Orchids for Miss Blandish ().39 No Orchids, however, was set in the USA, and much of the shock of Lewis’s novel comes from its location in a familiar and believable English town – not the already infamous ﬂesh pots of Brighton, but the sort of ordinary, working-class place written about by the northern realist school. The achievement of Jack’s Return Home at\n\nGET CARTER\n\n20\n\nthe end of the s was to make its readers look at a town like Scunthorpe anew, to see below the surface. It is tempting to argue that it encouraged readers to question the myth of working-class respectability propagated by Richard Hoggart’s Uses of Literacy,40 but its attitude to working-class consumerism and the social changes wrought by postwar afﬂuence is too ambivalent for that. Its middle-aged villains, however, are vivid enough to suggest that, at a time of signiﬁcant youthful dissent, young people were not the only threat to social order. The man who would bring Jack’s Return Home to the screen, independent producer Michael Klinger, was a unique ﬁgure in the British ﬁlm industry. He was a showman able to bridge the sizeable gap between commercial sexploitation and a cinema of genuine artistic experimentation. The son of a Polish tailor, Klinger was born in Soho in  and thoroughly imbibed its ethos of rule-breaking and shrewd deal-making. He started out as a disc jockey, but by the late s, he was cashing in on the Soho striptease boom by managing the Nell Gwynne club. The club’s performers supplied much of the subject matter for the epidemic of mm ‘glamour’ ﬁlms that began to be produced for the home-viewing market at the time, and would later feature in the plot of Get Carter. It was at the Nell Gwynne that Klinger met Tony Tenser, then head of publicity for Miracle Films, a UK distributor for racy continental pictures. In  they went into partnership and opened the Compton Cinema Club to show uncertiﬁcated movies to a ‘sophisticated’ membership. As Compton-Cameo Films, they quickly branched out into ﬁlm distribution and production, beginning with naturist epics like Harrison Marks’ Naked as Nature Intended (), and taking the fading British social problem cycle in a more consciously exploitative direction with cautionary tales such as That Kind of Girl (Robert Hartford-Davis, ) and The Yellow Teddybears (Hartford-Davis, ). The following year, ComptonCameo extended its portfolio by backing the mondo documentaries being made by Stanley Long and Arnold Louis Miller: London in the Raw (), Primitive London () and the docu-drama Secrets of a Windmill Girl (). Its ability to supply a niche market with titillating fare was fast making Compton-Cameo one of the most ﬁnancially successful independent companies in British ﬁlm-making, but Klinger was to demonstrate that his interest in cinema went deeper than catch-penny sensationalism by backing the talent of a promising director from his father’s homeland. The production of Roman Polanski’s Repulsion () and Cul-de-sac (), followed by Peter Collinson’s obtuse and Pinteresque The\n\nCARTER IN CONTEXT\n\n21\n\nPenthouse (), established Klinger as a cineaste and risk-taker to complement his reputation as a showman and deal-maker. The Penthouse was Klinger’s ﬁrst solo production after his split with Tenser, and was quickly followed by Baby Love (Alastair Reid, ), the controversial story of a suburban Lolita. In , with the conviction of the Kray brothers making headlines, Klinger decided that it was time to produce a tough gangster picture. His friend the producer/director Peter Walker had been quicker off the mark with his own low-budget crime ﬁlm Man of Violence (), ﬁlmed in the summer of . Klinger was invited to view the ﬁrst print of the ﬁlm with Walker later in the year and, after informing its director that it was ‘a load of old crap, son’, he announced, ‘I’m going to make a gangster ﬁlm, but it’s going to cost a lot more than this and it’s going to be better.’41 A trawl of publishers for suitable properties turned up Jack’s Return Home, and Klinger recognised its potential immediately. His creative imagination quickly linked the book to the promise shown by a new writer-director whose work Klinger had seen on Thames Television a few nights earlier, on  November . The programme was an eighty-minute ﬁlmed teleplay entitled Suspect, and its creator was Mike Hodges. The jigsaw that was to be Get Carter was beginning to fall into place. As the project germinated in Klinger’s mind, his friend Robert Littman was made head of European production at MGM. The Hollywood giant had been a signiﬁcant force in British production for decades, but, with the single exception of Blow-up (Michelangelo Antonioni, ), it had failed to cash in on the bonanza of ‘Swinging London’, maintaining a conservative policy of ﬁnancing apparently safe projects by established (and usually ageing) directors. The success of Kubrick’s : A Space Odyssey () kept the operation aﬂoat for a while, but with the failures of Goodbye Mr Chips (Herbert Ross, ) and Alfred the Great (Clive Donner, ) it was shipping water at an alarming rate.42 Littman’s appointment represented a last desperate attempt to bail out the Euroliner with cheap but commercial projects. Littman asked Klinger if he had any properties in development that might be suitable for the Hollywood ﬂeet’s sinking ship, and was quickly sold the idea of Get Carter. With a projected budget of less than £ million it looked a solid investment. The agreement was hatched in the nick of time. In February , MGM’s new managing director announced the closure of the company’s Boreham Wood Studios and its British operations. If the announcement had come two months earlier, Get Carter might never have been made. In any case, the imminent collapse of MGM’s interest\n\nGET CARTER\n\n22\n\nin British production lent the making of Get Carter a sense of urgency that would bring the project to completion in record time: nine months. With Littman’s backing, and following a discussion with Mike Hodges’ agent Barry Krost, Klinger mailed the proofs of Jack’s Return Home to his chosen director with a note inviting him to consider turning the book into a ﬁlm that he might like to handle.43 Mike Hodges came from a very different background from both Michael Klinger and Ted Lewis. He was brought up in comfortable circumstances in the west of England, qualifying as a chartered accountant at the age of twenty-two in . But after his National Service, he decided to turn his back on accountancy and try his luck in the television industry as a teleprompter operator. By the early s, Hodges had written his ﬁrst television play and, ironically for an atheist socialist, had been appointed as the editor of an ABC Television religious programme for young people. After an abortive attempt to make a documentary on Stephen Ward and the Profumo affair, Hodges successfully pitched an idea for a ﬁlm on undertakers to Granada’s World in Action, and began a two-year association with the programme. Between  and , he travelled widely, making programmes in Canada, the USA and Vietnam, before transferring to the ITV arts programme Tempo, where he made proﬁles of designers, writers and ﬁlm directors including Orson Welles and Jean-Luc Godard. The proﬁles were made in the style of their subject, and Hodges further experimented with form in his contributions to a series of ﬁlms on media culture. By the time Ted Lewis was working on Jack’s Return Home, however, Hodges was also ready to work on a thriller because, as he told Mark Adams, ‘Done well they can be like an autopsy of society. Crime is a wonderful way of really looking at what is going on.’44 The result was Suspect, the ﬁlm that brought him to Klinger’s attention. Mike Hodges received the proofs of Lewis’s novel on  January  and knew very soon after starting to read that this was a project that he wanted to take on.45 As Hodges set to work on his script, Klinger’s mind turned to the question of a star for the ﬁlm. With the conﬁdence afforded by the involvement of a Hollywood major, he approached Michael Caine’s agent Dennis Selinger. His timing was impeccable. Hodges’ second Thames Television play Rumour had been broadcast ( March ) while the proposal was being considered and had been greeted with enthusiasm by both Caine and Selinger. As Hodges has recalled, this second ﬁlm for the Playhouse series was more experimental than Suspect had been: ‘I used ﬂash-forwards (shot in the Blackwell\n\nCARTER IN CONTEXT\n\n23\n\ntunnel in London) as an image of a descent into Hell, slow motion, jump cuts, it was very much nouvelle vague style.’46 The ﬁlm, with its sardonic voiceover, captured the cynicism of the new decade, the profound loss of faith in established institutions like the press, and the gathering climate of sleaze, corruption and sadism. By early March, Caine was on board and Hodges, already beginning to earn his modest fee of £, as writer and director, had delivered the ﬁrst draft of his script. Having never attempted to adapt any text before, Hodges was inclined to stick as closely as possible to Lewis’s novel, but soon realised that he had to prioritise its cinematic possibilities. Dropping Lewis’s title and substituting Carter’s the Name, his treatment retained the essential structure of Lewis’s novel with its strong narrative drive, but introduced some minor changes to characterisation and more fundamental alterations to narratology. Most signiﬁcantly, Hodges decided to avoid the then unfashionable conventions of ﬁlm noir by dispensing with the voiceover suggested by the book’s ﬁrst-person narration, and to use any ﬂashbacks indicated by Carter’s memories of his early years as almost subliminal ﬂash edits. In this way, he streamlined and modernised the story-telling style, conﬁning the action to the long weekend Carter spends in his home town, and adopting a more detached and observational mode of reportage to replace the book’s impressionism. The immediate consequence was the loss of the insights into Carter’s motivations provided by his memories of boyhood and his relationships with brother Frank and delinquent gang leader Albert Swift. Also lost was the backstory of Carter’s dealings with Eric Paice during their time as rival gangsters in London, in particular, Eric’s violent treatment of Carter’s lover Audrey (renamed Anna in the screenplay), the memory of which fuels Carter’s hatred. In place of exposition and the development of subsidiary characters, Hodges would decide, during ﬁlming, to emphasise the cyclical and inevitable nature of the story by scattering it liberally with mementi mori, including the trope of placing the man who turns out to be Carter’s nemesis in the same carriage on the journey north.47 In fact, Hodges had to ﬁght hard for his preferred ending against his ﬁnanciers at MGM, who would have liked the protagonist to survive for a possible sequel. Hodges saw his ﬁlm as a tragedy in the tradition of Elizabethan drama and grand opera, rather than as an action thriller. It would, however, be a tragedy anchored to real contemporary social conditions, and would tap into the rage of the times. The screenplay was written in a climate of disintegrating social order. Persistent rioting in Ulster had brought British Army intervention and the formation of the Provisional\n\nGET CARTER\n\n24\n\nIRA, and in England there was widespread student unrest, including bombings and violent demonstrations. The press was gripped by a moral panic about the activities of ‘skinheads’, and ‘queer-bashing’ and ‘Pakibashing’ entered the language. As  began, Britain was experiencing a spate of bank robberies, and its ﬁrst case of abduction for gain. In the aftermath of the Kray twins’ imprisonment, it was an active time for gangland, with the killing of Eddie Coleman in March. It was this apparently accelerating descent into disorder that helped sweep the Conservative Party to power in the summer’s general election, and informed a number of contemporary ﬁlm-makers’ explorations of the morality of violence. While Hodges planned Get Carter, Kubrick was making A Clockwork Orange (), Ken Russell was working on The Devils (), and Sam Peckinpah was developing Straw Dogs ().48 Hodges’ most fundamental transformation of Lewis’s novel had nothing to do with narrative and characterisation. It was, of course, the relocation of the action from Humberside to Tyneside. In the spring of  Klinger, Hodges and driver Reg Niven set off in the producer’s Cadillac to scout east coast locations, to ﬁnd a suitable place to represent Jack’s home town, ‘the blast furnace where his hardness and anger was cast’.49 As a television auteur, Hodges had previously researched his locations alone and unobtrusively in his old Fiat. The process had allowed him time to think and to develop ideas for his production. This time, he was in an ostentatious American gas-guzzler with a producer who had his own ideas about settings and treatments. Although Lewis’s novel is set in an inland steel town, Hodges was looking for somewhere more familiar to him, and somewhere with the added cinematic appeal of the sea. He already had indelible memories of the ﬁshing ports he had visited during his national service in the Royal Navy’s Fishery Protection Fleet, but he discovered that, thirteen years on, most of them had been ‘decimated by developers’.50 He had high hopes of Hull, but like Jack returning home, he found that things had changed. In the aftermath of the post-war economic boom, much of the crumbling seediness nurtured by austerity had been swept away, replaced by glass and concrete developments. Discouraged, Hodges was about to call off the search and settle for the tried and tested Nottingham (Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, Karel Reisz, ) when he remembered docking on Tyneside in the mid-s and decided to see if its character had escaped the planners: We pressed on and came to Newcastle. The visual drama of the place\n\nCARTER IN CONTEXT\n\n25\n\ntook my breath away. Seeing the great bridges crossing the Tyne, the waterfront, the terraced houses stepped up each side of the deep valley, I knew that Jack was home. And although the developers were breathing down the Scotswood Road, they hadn’t yet gobbled it up. We’d got there in time. But only just.51\n\nSatisﬁed that they had found the right setting for the ﬁlm, Michael Klinger headed back to London in his Caddy, leaving his director to complete the ﬁne details of location spotting. Fired with fresh enthusiasm and given a free hand by his producer, Hodges set to work modifying his script to exploit the visual possibilities offered by Tyneside. Whereas Lewis’s setting had been a small town and the surrounding sprawl of impoverished countryside and pretentious suburbs, the ﬁlm’s would be the claustrophobic canyon of Newcastle, a city with one foot in the past and one in the future. Lewis’s nondescript pubs and farmsteads would be replaced as scenes of action by the more cinematic locations around the Tyne.52 With a script in place and principal locations sourced, Hodges and Klinger assembled a highly talented creative team. Hodges had been impressed by Ken Hughes’ The Small World of Sammy Lee () and knew that he wanted the cinematographer responsible for giving the ﬁlm its poetic documentary aesthetic: Wolfgang Suschitzky. The veteran Viennese cameraman had worked in continental Europe as a photographer before World War II, ﬁnally coming to England in . He had immediately struck up a partnership with Paul Rotha to make documentaries. Their work during the war included World of Plenty () and government-sponsored magazine programmes and information shorts. His introduction into feature ﬁlm-making had been in Rotha’s critically acclaimed No Resting Place (), one of the ﬁrst British features shot entirely on location. He had gone on to photograph another Colin Lesslie production, The Oracle (USA: The Horse’s Mouth, Pennington Richards, ), another Rotha ﬁlm, Cat and Mouse (), and Jack Clayton’s Oscar-winning short ﬁlm, The Bespoke Overcoat (), developing a reputation as an expert location photographer with a documentarist’s ability to extract atmosphere from naturalistic settings. In the s his commissions had ranged from Joseph Strick’s controversial Ulysses () to Hammer’s Vengeance of She (Cliff Owen, ). His last ﬁlm before Carter was Entertaining Mr. Sloane (Douglas Hickox, ). Suschitzky’s camera operator would be Dusty Miller, who would go on to be Euston Films’ leading cinematographer, endlessly\n\n26\n\nGET CARTER\n\nphotographing the landscape of Greater London for the TV series The Sweeney, Minder and The Professionals. Suschitzky and Miller’s footage would be assembled by the safe hands of John Trumper, an editor well versed in the rhythms of cutting thrillers, which constituted the majority of the thirty features he had edited in the previous twenty years. Trumper’s recent experience covered work with directors with such divergent styles as Peter Watkins (Privilege, ) and Peter Collinson (The Italian Job, ). He had just cut Suschitzky’s footage for Entertaining Mr. Sloane. Get Carter’s production design would be handled by Assheton Gorton, who had begun his career in television but was most closely associated with high s ﬁlms such as The Knack (Richard Lester, ), Blow-up, The Magic Christian (Joseph McGrath, ), and Wonderwall (Joe Massot, ). Carter would offer few of the opportunities for ﬂamboyant creativity Gorton had enjoyed on productions like these. CASTING CARTER\n\n‘… we observe in tragedies That a good actor many times is curs’d For playing a villain’s part …’ Ferdinand in John Webster, The Duchess of Malfi, IV.ii.–\n\nWhen Hodges was working on the ﬁrst draft of his script, he had Ian Hendry in mind for the role of Carter, only to discover that Michael Caine had been recruited for the part while the ink was still wet on the script. ‘Jack Carter was such a shit it never occurred to me that a star would risk his reputation playing him.’53 After a slow start to his screen acting career, Caine’s star was very much in the ascendant. He had become the male face of British cinema in the s, an icon popularised by David Bailey and a string of leading roles in successful movies. Caine had his own interpretation of Carter’s character, and would signiﬁcantly modify Hodges’ formulation of his protagonist as a seedy but tough wide boy. Caine would give him a cold authority that is implicit in Lewis’s original conception. As Hodges recalled:\n\nMichael Caine (Jack Carter)\n\nIn the script, Carter was softer and sleazier than he was in the ﬁnal ﬁlm. But Michael Caine gave him an edge – he really knew Carter and made him more ruthless. Remember when he’s in that Newcastle bar and he\n\nCARTER IN CONTEXT\n\n27\n\nasks for his drink – ‘in a thin glass’? [ … ] In the script Carter says ‘Please’. But Michael left it out and that little choice just makes Carter even more terrifying.54\n\nFor Caine, playing Carter was also something of a return home. Shortly before taking the part, he had made a nostalgic trip back to the area of south London in which he had grown up, discovering, in the process, that the Kennington Regal cinema in which he had spent so many contented hours truanting from school was being demolished. It was a time of taking stock of his roots and the trajectory of his career.55 The role of Carter was not only business, it was personal. Carter represented the path sinister he had managed to avoid taking in his adolescence. As he remarked, ‘Carter is the dead-end product of my own environment, my childhood. I know him well. He is the ghost of Michael Caine.’56 Caine’s identiﬁcation with the character would be signiﬁed by the rejection of any attempt to simulate a Geordie accent. This was entirely in keeping with Hodges’ dialogue, which paid no attention to speciﬁcally north-eastern speech patterns. Caine ’s natural London accent was perfectly acceptable to his director: ‘I thought it fair to assume that Carter had been in London long enough to master the accent.’57 The force of Caine’s performance, however, would derive, in part, from the way in which it contradicted or extended his established star persona. In contrast to the assertion of the ﬁlm’s publicity that ‘Caine is Carter’, the actor’s roles had evoked a rather more humorous and vulnerable character than the cold killer he played in this ﬁlm. His most celebrated role had probably been as the eponymous Alfie (), the working-class playboy in Lewis Gilbert’s tragi-comedy of manners, and his image as an artful dodger had been enhanced by his recent leading part in The Italian Job. Jack Carter was a very different kettle of ﬁsh. Caine once described Harry Palmer, the character he played in The Ipcress File (Sidney J. Fury, ) as ‘a winner who comes on like a loser’.58 Carter is a loser who comes on like a winner. Making Carter would prove a sufﬁciently winning experience for Caine to form a production partnership with Hodges and Klinger – ‘The Three Michaels’ – to make a second ﬁlm, Pulp (Mike Hodges, ). Almost unbelievably, Caine’s stand-in on Get Carter would be a man named Jack Carter. Thirty-nine-year-old Ian Hendry had been obliged to take up auctioneering and estate management in his native\n\nIan Hendry (Eric Paice)\n\nGET CARTER\n\n28\n\n. A forceful performance. Caine practises his phone manner.\n\nSuffolk before ﬁnally persuading his father to allow him to become an actor. After a spell in rep, he had secured parts in Simon and Laura (Muriel Box, ), The Secret Place (Clive Donner, ) and Room at the Top (Jack Clayton, ), before landing leading roles in television in Police Surgeon () and in the ﬁrst series of the legendary The Avengers (). By , Hendry had become a ‘hot property’ in British ﬁlm-making and starred in Live Now, Pay Later (Jay Lewis, ), This is My Street (Sidney Hayers, ), Girl in the Headlines (USA: The Model Murder Case, Michael Truman, ) and The Beauty Jungle (USA: Contest Girl, Val Guest, ). The ﬁlms were not the box-ofﬁce hits they had been expected to be, however, and by , as Michael Caine’s star rose, Hendry began to slip back to supporting actor status in ﬁlms like The Hill (Sidney Lumet, ), The Sandwich Man (Robert\n\nCARTER IN CONTEXT\n\n29\n\nHartford-Davis, ) and The McKenzie Break (Lamont Johnson, ). He had ﬁrst worked for Michael Klinger when he played the sexist Michael in Polanski’s Repulsion. By the time he took the part of Kinnear’s odious lieutenant, Eric, in Get Carter, Hendry’s problems with alcohol were obvious, his image was becoming more seedy, and his career was sliding faster downhill. In the s he would be largely conﬁned to character parts in exploitation movies like Intimate Games (Tudor Gates, ) and The Bitch (Gerry O’Hara, ). Just before his death in , he would accept a small role in the Channel  television soap Brookside. Swedish actress Britt Ekland was already a familiar face, both on screen and in the gossip columns, when she was offered the role of Anna, gang boss Gerald Fletcher’s adulterous wife. After leading roles in continental ﬁlms, she had come to England to work in television, and went on to appear in a string of feature ﬁlms that developed her reputation as a sex symbol. A marriage to Peter Sellers was soon followed by a divorce in , but her career continued to prosper. She won roles in American movies such as The Night They Raided Minsky’s (William Friedkin, ) and Stiletto (Bernard Kowalski, ). When it came to casting Get Carter, her familiarity to US audiences recommended her to MGM, while her pairing with Michael Caine promised some interesting sexual chemistry. Consequently, she was given a prominence in the ﬁlm’s publicity that was hardly warranted by the size of her role. Having already played two gangsters’ molls, however, Ekland was concerned about becoming typecast.59 Britt Ekland (Anna Fletcher)\n\nIn a radical piece of casting, Hodges persuaded the famous playwright John Osborne to play the Godfather of Tyneside, Cyril Kinnear. Osborne had begun his career as an actor in the early s before writing the celebrated play Look Back in Anger () and launching the ‘angry young man’ cycle of novels and plays. As a founding partner of Woodfall Films, he had adapted his own plays for the British screen, and produced the acclaimed adapted screenplay for Tom Jones (Tony Richardson, ), but Get Carter was his ﬁrst acting role in a British ﬁlm. For Osborne, his role represented an opportunity to take a break from writing and to recharge his batteries. His part as a sophisticated, middle-aged crime lord would also help to shake off his lingering image as an enfant terrible. ‘I hope people have forgotten that “angry young man” image which became rather tiresome John Osborne (Cyril Kinnear)\n\nGET CARTER\n\n30\n\nin the end.’60 His casting meant a distinct change to Lewis’s original conception of Kinnear as a squat, obese and uncultured spiv. Not only was Osborne tall, slim and bearded, he also saw his character as a fallen member of legitimate society rather than a risen member of the criminal classes: He ’s a villain, and villains are always fun to play. He ’s a big-time provincial crook. A big ﬁsh in a small pond. Kinnear has pretensions too. He’s the type of man who’s been a Warrant Ofﬁcer in the Army and then wears a Brigade of Guards Regimental tie in later years. But he has a sense of humour which makes him human.61\n\nOn location, Osborne was something of a private ﬁgure, but Hodges has commented that he really enjoyed his part: ‘he had that sort of calmness about him of the truly powerful’.62 The most challenging aspect of the role, however, turned out to be the need to give a convincing performance as a poker player. Unfamiliar with most card games, Osborne spent hours practising poker before his gambling scene.63 Hodges would later coax Osborne back before the cameras for his Flash Gordon (). Since making his feature ﬁlm debut at the age of thirty-eight in Orson Welles’ Chimes at Midnight (), Southampton-born Tony Beckley had been consistently in demand with casting directors, making something of a specialism playing criminal types. He had been disturbingly convincing as one of the sadists who terrorise a young couple in Michael Klinger’s production The Penthouse, and would shortly go on to star as the religious psychopath in The Fiend (Robert Hartford-Davis, ). His most enduring portrayal, however, would prove to be Camp Freddie in Peter Collinson’s The Italian Job, the ﬁlm on which he had ﬁrst worked with Michael Caine. In Get Carter he was given another ‘camp’ role as Peter, the unstable London hood who is more clearly characterised in Lewis’s novel as a misogynistic homosexual.\n\nTony Beckley (Peter the Dutchman)\n\nAs the man who had introduced Barbara Windsor to Charles Kray, George Sewell was a natural choice to play a London gangster. In his mid-forties in , Sewell had come to acting late. Son of a London print worker, he had begun to follow in his father’s footsteps before joining the RAF and then the Merchant Navy. By the time he jokingly tried his hand at acting in Joan Littlewood’s Theatre Workshop in , he had worked in jobs as varied as travel George Sewell (Con McCarty)\n\nCARTER IN CONTEXT\n\n31\n\ncourier, bricklayer, barman, street photographer, dance-band drummer and manager of a roller-skating team. His ﬁrst ﬁlm role was in Littlewood’s Sparrows Can’t Sing (), a ﬁlm in which the Kray brothers took a paternal interest. By the time he was cast in Get Carter, he was a veteran of crime dramas like Robbery (Peter Yates, ) and BBC’s Z Cars, and of social realist ﬁlm-making by Lindsay Anderson and Ken Loach, having acted in This Sporting Life (Anderson, ), Cathy Come Home (Loach, BBC ) and Poor Cow (Loach, ). Together with Dorothy White, Sewell had already worked with Hodges on the television play Suspect. He had recently appeared regularly on television in the space opera UFO, and would shortly take a leading part in the Special Branch series. He continues to be a familiar face on TV in the twentyﬁrst century. Geraldine Moffat (Glenda) Geraldine Moffat’s stunning looks and ability to personify the s ‘dolly bird’ have unfortunately caused observers to overlook the quality of her acting. In fact, the Nottinghamborn actress was far from being some ingenue recruited to play a goodtime girl solely because of the shapeliness of her legs in a mini-skirt. She had trained at the prestigious Old Vic Theatre School in Bristol, and had a wealth of experience in repertory and on the West End stage. She had made her ﬁlm debut in The Man Who Had Power Over Women (John Krish, ), but it was her work in television drama, particularly her leading roles in the Alun Owen teleplays Stella and Doreen, that caught the attention of Mike Hodges. Before retiring from acting to bring up her rock musician sons, Moffat would continue to make guest appearances in TV action series like Jason King and The Persuaders, ending her career as a barmaid in Coronation Street (). Dorothy White (Margaret) Apart from an uncredited appearance in a  ﬁlm Touch and Go (Michael Truman), the role of the adulterous Margaret, Frank Carter’s lover, was Dorothy White’s ﬁrst on the big screen. After studying drama in her spare time and joining Birmingham Rep, she had gone on to forge a successful career as a television actress, notably in BBC’s Z Cars. White had ﬁrst worked with Hodges on his teleplay Suspect. After Get Carter, she made one more ﬁlm appearance (Family Life, Ken Loach, ), before returning to television. Rosemarie Dunham (Edna Garfoot) Rosemarie Dunham made her (credited) ﬁlm debut as Carter’s randy landlady. Born in Scotland to a\n\nGET CARTER\n\n32\n\nGreek mother and English father, she spent much of her early life in Malta before beginning her acting career in English repertory. In the early s, she spent two years in the Old Vic Company, and one of her ﬁrst television roles was in an episode of The Avengers (). After Get Carter, she worked regularly in television, including a part in Coronation Street, until the early s. Mike Hodges would bring her back to the big screen in  in Croupier. Petra Markham (Doreen) Although she had little previous feature ﬁlm experience, Petra Markham was a mature twenty-four-year-old when she took on the role of Carter’s sixteen-year-old niece. Sister of fellow actress Kika Markham, she had appeared in productions at the Royal Court and the Roundhouse, and in television shows as varied as The Marty Feldman Show and The Wednesday Play. With only four scenes in Get Carter, she was able to juggle the requirements of location ﬁlming with her theatre work at the Royal Court and her role in the television series Victoria and Albert. She continued to work mainly on the small screen after Get Carter, and is best known for her role as Rose Chapman, the wife murdered by her gangster husband in BBC’s EastEnders. In  she was reunited with Rosemarie Dunham in Out of Depth (Simon Marshall, ), a thriller photographed by Wolfgang Suschitzky’s grandson Adam. Bryan Mosley (Cliff Brumby) Although MGM originally had Telly Savalas in mind for the part of the slot machine magnate Cliff Brumby, Coronation Street actor Bryan Mosley was cast after executives were impressed by his acting in ﬁght scenes from Far from the Madding Crowd (John Schlesinger, ).64 Mosley was an accomplished performer in stage ﬁghts, and proved ideal casting for the big man in bad shape. When offered the part, however, he reacted with a mixture of excitement and apprehension. Afraid that participating in such a violent ﬁlm might compromise his Catholic faith, Mosley took the script to his local priest and waited anxiously for his verdict:\n\nA few days later the priest returned with his conclusion. I was pretty astounded when he said he thought it was a very good morality play! The tone of the piece, although violent, did not condone such actions – indeed, even condemned them. I was relieved and at peace with the decision to go ahead.65\n\nAs well as appearing as Alf Roberts in more than , episodes of Coronation Street, and acting in hundreds of television dramas and stage\n\nCARTER IN CONTEXT\n\n33\n\nplays, Mosley had parts in a number of feature ﬁlms before making a decision to concentrate on work for the small screen. A native of Leeds, his cinema career began in the New Wave ﬁlms set in Yorkshire: A Kind of Loving (John Schlesinger, ) and This Sporting Life. Other ﬁlm appearances included The Rattle of a Simple Man (Betty Box, ), Up Jumped a Swagman (Christopher Miles, ), Privilege, and  is a Dangerous Age, Cynthia (Joe McGrath, ). Glynn Edwards (Albert Swift) Like George Sewell, Glynn Edwards entered the acting profession in his thirties through Joan Littlewood’s Theatre Workshop, and made one of his ﬁrst screen appearances in Sparrows Can’t Sing. He had subsequently become a familiar face (most often as a policeman) in British ﬁlms and television, having already acted alongside Michael Caine in Zulu and The Ipcress File. After playing Albert the part-time porn star in Get Carter, Edwards would be regularly employed as a character actor, most memorably playing Dave, the manager of the Winchester Club in the Minder television series.\n\nBradford-born Bernard Hepton had established a successful career as both an actor and television producer when Hodges persuaded him to take the part of Kinnear’s nervous messenger in Get Carter. One of Hepton’s most recent television roles had been as Caiaphas, High Priest of Jerusalem, in Dennis Potter’s controversial Son of Man (). In fact, he made something of a specialisation in playing priests, taking the role of Archbishop Cranmer in the blockbuster television series The Six Wives of Henry VIII and Elizabeth R, both screened in the year of Get Carter’s release, . He reprised the role in the ﬁlm version of The Six Wives, two years later, and went on to appear in Barry Lyndon (Stanley Kubrick, ) and Gandhi (Richard Attenborough, ), but he probably remains best known for two other roles in hit TV series: Toby Esterhase in the adaptations of John Le Carré’s Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy () and Smiley’s People (), and Albert Foiret in Secret Army () and Kessler (). Bernard Hepton (Thorpe)\n\nAlun Armstrong (Keith) Alun Armstrong would eventually play his most famous role twenty-ﬁve years after Get Carter in another Newcastleset drama, Our Friends in the North (). In that celebrated television series, he would revisit the roots of corruption in the north east of the s as the local Labour politician, Austin Donohue. When Hodges cast him as Carter’s victimised helper, he was making his screen debut.\n\nGET CARTER\n\n34\n\nTerence Rigby (Gerald Fletcher) Like so many of the actors selected by Hodges to give Get Carter an authentic feel, thirty-three-year-old Terence Rigby was best known for his work in television drama, having appeared in crime series such as Softly Softly, The Saint and Callan. His single ﬁlm credit was as a policeman in Joseph Losey’s Accident (). Since appearing brieﬂy as the crime lord Gerald Fletcher, Rigby has enjoyed a distinguished career as a character actor on stage and screen, featuring in Our Friends in the North, and British ﬁlms such as Elizabeth (Kapur, ), Plunkett and Macleane (Jake Scott, ) and Essex Boys (Terry Winsor, ).\n\nThe son of a London taxi driver, John ‘Biffo’ Bindon was ‘discovered’ by Ken Loach in a west London pub and recruited as an untried supporting actor to Carole White and Terence Stamp in Poor Cow. He went on to establish a career in ﬁlms and television playing crooks and cheeky chappies, notably in Quadrophenia (Franc Roddam, ). Although still in his twenties in , Bindon’s credentials to play the small role of the gang boss Sid Fletcher were impeccable. He had an intimate knowledge of the underworld, having spent part of his youth in Borstal and most of his adult life associating with criminals. By the end of the s, he had charmed his way into the inner circles of swinging London, hobnobbing with top models and royalty. His career would take a nose-dive in the mid-s when he became involved in protection racketeering in Fulham and was acquitted of murder at the Old Bailey. A string of convictions for violence would follow before his death in penury in .66\n\nJohn Bindon (Sid Fletcher)\n\nOther Parts For the ﬁlm’s minor supporting roles, Hodges recruited a stalwart band of character actors with plenty of experience, particularly in television. Godfrey Quigley (Eddie) and Kevin Brennan (Harry) had both made their ﬁrst screen appearances in , and had worked with Ian Hendry on The Avengers. Brennan went on to enjoy a second career behind the scenes as a gaffer and horror make-up specialist. Liz McKenzie (Mrs Brumby) and Geraldine Sherman (Albert’s girlfriend) had both worked with Ken Loach in Cathy Come Home and Poor Cow respectively. John Hussey (Architect) had played Sir Miles Bishton in The Reckoning, and Ben Aris’s (Interior Designer) credits included If (Lindsay Anderson, ), The Charge of the Light Brigade (Tony Richardson, ) and the part of Rosencrantz in Tony Richardson’s Hamlet (). Appropriately, however, the mystery man remains Carl Howard, who played\n\n35\n\nCARTER IN CONTEXT\n\nCarter’s assassin: Get Carter appears to be his only ﬁlm appearance. Hodges, however, has shed some light on the mystery: Carl was an extra – a pallbearer – in my  TV ﬁlm Rumour. I gave him a line and the wrong extra was credited. I promised I’d make it up to him, and did. Except that he got left off the credits in the ﬁrst prints of Carter. Meanwhile Rumour was repeated and we made sure the Radio Times and TV Times got it right. Unfortunately they trimmed the listings and both omitted him! Carl and credits didn’t seem destined for each other.67 SHOOTING CARTER\n\n‘Will all members of the unit please take plenty of warm clothes to Newcastle, as the weather is very much colder there than in the London area.’ Derek Gibson, Carter location manager, Movement Order,  July , MGM British Studios\n\nBryan Mosley once remarked that ‘The sun doesn’t shine once in Get Carter’,68 and to look at Michael Caine in his black raincoat striding grimly beneath leaden skies, it would be easy to believe that the ﬁlm was shot in the depths of winter. In fact, location ﬁlming in the north east took place between late July and mid-September, but photographs of the production crew suggest that the weather was closer to December. A photograph of ﬁlming on the funeral scene published in Kinematograph Weekly on  August  shows everyone well wrapped up in waterproofs and fur-trimmed parkas. Five weeks earlier, it had all been a lot more glamorous when the same publication covered the ﬁlm’s launch party hosted by MGM’s Robert Littman.69 The ﬁlm went into production under the working title Carter, and this title also appeared on the ﬁrst paperback publication of Lewis’s novel (Pan Books, ), produced to tie in with the movie’s release. Before leaving for Newcastle on  July, Hodges spent an uncomfortable day at his prop man’s house ﬁlming the faux porno movie that his protagonist would later view in a Tyneside tower block. He also shot all the scenes involving Britt Ekland, John Bindon and Terence Rigby, some of which (including a scene showing the disﬁguration of Ekland’s face at the hands of Rigby’s character) would not survive the ﬁlm’s ﬁnal cut. Ekland, Bindon and Rigby would not be required in Newcastle and, in fact, Caine was the only actor to take the train north with the production crew. Determined that his location work should capture the authentic\n\nGET CARTER\n\n36\n\nﬂavour of Tyneside, Hodges paid enormous attention to detail, carefully casting his extras and employing the real people associated with the locations whenever possible. Hence, the women who ﬁght each other in a nightclub fracas were genuine antagonists in real life, and many of the guests at Kinnear’s orgy had attended similar parties in the house in which it was ﬁlmed. MGM estimated that the ﬁlm had employed about , extras.70 As a devotee of Fellini’s cinema, Hodges was keen to enliven his crowd scenes by ﬁnding extras with interesting faces. He quickly discovered that he did not have to look too far. ‘Newcastle was ﬁlled with amazing Hogarthian faces,’ he later recalled.71 As a group of outsiders from the south arriving with a star actor closely associated with London lad culture to make a ﬁlm with Geordie ‘colour’, the ﬁlm unit was conscious of the potential for friction with local sensibilities. They knew they were walking on eggshells when, early in the shooting schedule, the unit was ﬁlming in the Scotswood Road area of the city. Hodges had chosen to show Frank Carter’s funeral cortège leaving from the back of a row of terraces because many of the fronts were boarded up awaiting demolition. Some local residents were scandalised by what they considered an insulting portrayal of northern funeral customs. One woman castigated the director, telling him in no uncertain terms that ‘I don’t care what you do down London, but up here we don’t take hearses down back lanes.’72 It was a timely reminder of the bitterness that marked Britain’s north/south divide, and of the need to mobilise local support for the movie. On the ﬁrst day of shooting, a diplomatic Michael Caine had told Newcastle ’s Evening Chronicle that, although he had not had much time to look around on his ﬁrst visit to the city, he was already very impressed with its people, adding, ‘The women are wearing the same clothes as they are in London and it’s the least provincial of all the towns I’ve been to.’73 On returning to London, however, the account he gave to his Geordie friend Ian La Frenais was rather more typically metropolitan: ‘I’ve always gone on about this working-class image I’ve got and so on; but now I’ve been to Newcastle I realize I’m middle-class.’74 Two decades later, Caine recalled his ﬁrst impressions of Tyneside in his autobiography: By now I had seen poverty in different parts of the world that had made my own childhood look quite privileged, but I had never witnessed misery like this in my own country; it was Charles Dickens meets Emily Brontë, written by Edgar Wallace. Being in the far north of England, the weather was also dark and foreboding, the perfect atmosphere for our movie.75\n\nCARTER IN CONTEXT\n\n37\n\nMichael Klinger, too, had been quite shocked by the toughness of the culture he found on Tyneside. By way of illustration, he recalled the occasion during the shoot in the Scotswood Road area when Caine had been approached by one of the urchins who hung around the production unit. The kid had presented the star with a piece of toilet paper to sign. When Caine obliged with his autograph, the boy had looked at it, inquired about the name, declared that he had never heard of it, and ripped up the paper.76 On another occasion when Caine was signing autographs, a girl had told him candidly, ‘Me mum said you were goodlooking. But I think y’er ugly.’77 Also aware of the controversial nature of the ﬁlm’s subject matter, and the local hornets’ nest stirred up in similar circumstances by the ﬁlming of Brighton Rock, a spokesperson for the Carter ﬁlm unit had assured the Chronicle that this most location-speciﬁc of movies was to be set in an anonymous city in the north, and that it was ‘extremely doubtful if many will recognize it as Newcastle’.78 A positive relationship with the city was further promoted two nights later when MGM hosted a cocktail party in the Royal Station Hotel, opposite the bar used as a location on the ﬁrst day of ﬁlming, and the base for the production.79 Like Caine, the ﬁlm’s producers tried not to miss a trick in the public relations department, also showering Newcastle’s womenfolk with compliments and declaring them ‘the prettiest girls’ in England.80 The policy of ﬂattery, largesse, good humour and the employment of local extras paid dividends, and towards the end of his eight-week stay in the north east, producer Michael Klinger felt conﬁdent enough to abandon earlier caution and emphasise his ﬁlm’s connection with the area: We love the dramatic way in which the old is mixed with the new in Newcastle. We love the river bridges, the way in which the city is built on different levels. And the people … they are incredibly nice without being phoney. Newcastle will be one of the stars of the [ﬁlm] … as much a part of the action as Paris in Rififi, San Francisco in Bullitt, Los Angeles in Harper.81\n\nWhen Ian Hendry arrived in Newcastle in August, the ﬁlm’s director and producer were immediately conscious of his alcohol problem and the animosity towards Michael Caine that his drinking exacerbated. As Hendry got stuck in to some serious drinking on the night before his ﬁrst scene, it became evident to all that he was deeply jealous of Caine ’s success. It was a situation that could easily have lowered morale and created tensions in the entire production unit, but Caine and Hodges\n\nGET CARTER\n\n38\n\nwere canny enough to channel Hendry’s negativity and use it to give an extra edge to the encounters between Carter and Eric. Location work in Newcastle and Gateshead occupied about four weeks of the ﬁlm’s shooting schedule before the unit moved on to Hamsterley, County Durham, to ﬁlm the scenes at Kinnear’s mansion, and Blackhall Rocks on the Durham coast for the ﬁlm’s ﬁnal sequence. By early September, the unit was back on Tyneside to complete the shooting schedule, ﬁnally ﬁlming parts of the titles sequence during their return to London on  September. Writer Ted Lewis attended the early ﬁlming, approving Hodges’ changes to his novel and declaring himself particularly impressed with Caine’s portrayal of the character he had created: ‘He’s ideal casting for the part, and I can’t really imagine any other actor doing it as well.’82 By the time Hodges returned to London, he had all the footage to assemble Get Carter, but one vital ingredient was missing: music. Michael Klinger, however, knew just the man for the job: Roy Budd. Hodges had seen Budd play jazz piano a number of times, but had not thought of him as a ﬁlm composer. But when he heard Budd’s ideas for the score, he was immediately struck by a few plaintive chords embedded in the title music and realised that they would make a dramatically simple theme for key passages in the picture.83 Budd’s harpsichord theme has become as evocative of the atmosphere of Get Carter as Anton Karas’s zither tune is of The Third Man (Carol Reed, ). Already a highly respected jazz musician, Budd was just twenty-three years old when he composed Get Carter. It was only his second ﬁlm score,84 and he accepted the commission on the tiny budget of £, working with the other two members of his jazz trio, Jeff Clyne (bass) and Chris Karan (percussion). Inﬂuenced by the innovative scores of Ennio Morricone, Budd approached the sessions at the Olympic Studios, Barnes in a spirit of experimentation. Both diegetic and non-diegetic music was required, and for the snatches of rock music heard in the Long Bar and at Kinnear’s party, Budd turned to the lyric-writing talent of his manager Jack Fishman. It is Budd’s haunting theme and incidental music with its bizarre instrumentation, however, that lives in the memory. It combines harpsichord, electric piano, double bass and tablas (courtesy of the percussionist’s time in India).85 The composer went on to work on over ﬁfty ﬁlm scores before his death at only forty-six in .\n\n39\n\nCARTER IN CONTEXT\n\nCARTER IN CONTEXT\n\nHigh Risers\n\n‘There’s nothing so holy but money will corrupt and putrefy it. […] You are happy in England, my lord; here they sell justice with those weights that they press men to death with.’ Flamineo in John Webster, The White Devil, III.iii.–, –\n\nOn  August , midway through the ﬁlming of Get Carter, the north east was rocked by a four-second earth tremor, causing particular distress to residents of tower blocks. This was hardly surprising, given that the disastrous collapse of a similar block at Ronan Point was a recent memory. In hindsight, it is easy to see this ominous rumble as a portent of the scandals that would shake the north east in the early s. For the previous ten years, Tyneside had been at the centre of the modernist project, which transformed Britain’s urban landscape in the post-war years. The twin principles of town planning and slum clearance, applied in the aftermath of Nazi bombing, ripped apart the historic centres of many British towns and cities, replacing roads with urban motorways and ﬂyovers, streets with shopping precincts and terrace houses with high-rise blocks of ﬂats. On Tyneside, the architect of change was the leader of Newcastle Council, the Labour radical T. Dan Smith – known to his admirers as ‘Mr Newcastle’. A ﬁrm advocate of the independence of the local state, Smith was a visionary who believed that, with the wholesale application of modern planning and building techniques, his city could rival ‘Venice, Athens, Florence and Rome’ as a European cultural centre.86 To this end, he brought in the town planning and social engineering guru Wilf Burns in . Burns was not a man to allow local customs, mores and sentiments to dilute his modernist precepts. He believed he knew what was best for people and they had better accept his brave new world. Paradoxically, his ultra-modern version of social engineering now looks suspiciously like Victorian conceptions of the disciplinary society: In a huge city, it is a fairly common observation that the dwellers in a slum are almost a separate race of people with different values, aspirations and ways of living. One result of slum clearance is that a considerable movement of people takes place over long distances with a devastating effect on the social groupings built up over the years. But, one might argue, this is a good thing when we are dealing with people\n\nGET CARTER\n\n40\n\nwho have no initiative or civic pride. The task, surely, is to break up such groupings, even though the people seem to be satisﬁed with their miserable environment and seem to enjoy an extrovert social life in their locality.87\n\nWith the devastation of the north east’s industrial infrastructure still in the future, the physical reconstruction of Tyneside blazed ahead, creating unprecedented opportunities for poorly remunerated local politicians to supplement their income in illicit ways, as the campaigning Labour MP Tom Milne made clear: Apart from a sense of importance and self-aggrandisement, MPs and Councillors could easily pick up paid directorships, fees and expenses, both from public enterprises and from companies in the private sector contracting for public works, roads, hospitals, schools and housing schemes. One could be a Labour Councillor voting on public expenditure for these schemes and, at the same time, a private contractor making extremely good proﬁts out of the contract. The safe Labour majorities made the positions of both MPs and Councillors secure.88\n\nIt was T. Dan Smith who set the standards in north-eastern public life at the time. The Trotskyist politician seemed to see no contradiction in the fact that he was also a public relations consultant for the Crudens building company who won lucrative contracts for blocks of ﬂats from the council, the Peterlee Development Corporation, and for the Labour Party. The role of Dan Smith as a power broker in the north east meant that most local MPs were protective of him. In , Smith was hired as a public relations consultant by the Leeds architect John Poulson, whose practice was closely aligned with the construction ﬁrms Bovis Holdings, the family company of the then Conservative Minister of Housing, Keith Joseph, and Marples Ridgeway, a ﬁrm predominantly owned by the Transport Minister, Ernest Marples. Smith also had a close working relationship with the corrupt County Durham alderman, Andrew Cunningham, whose many public roles included chair of the Northumbrian River Authority and Durham Police Authority, and membership of the Labour Party National Executive Committee. Smith introduced Cunningham to Poulson in . It was a system of mutual beneﬁt that bridged radical political divisions and ensured that any close inspection of its undertakings was effectively discouraged. As Milne puts it, ‘There were plenty of ofﬁcials and councillors around willing to be bought, and more important, many in high places who were willing\n\nCARTER IN CONTEXT\n\n41\n\n. Dryderdale Hall, the home of Vince Landa and Cyril Kinnear.\n\nand able to foster these activities whilst themselves remaining in the background, but being helpful in any cover-up operations that were required.’89 One of those implicated in Milne’s accusation was Reginald Maudling, the Tory Home Secretary at the time of the inquiry into Poulson’s affairs and a director of his company. Poulson quickly secured contracts all over the north east. The invulnerability of the venal system of local government contracting seemed to be conﬁrmed by Dan Smith’s appointment as chair of the Northern Economic Planning Council and to the Royal Commission on Local Government in . Before the end of , however, the greed of council ofﬁcials was to prove Poulson’s undoing. So many sweeteners had been paid that his architectural practice was declared insolvent. It was only a matter of time until the shit hit the fan. As the script for Get Carter was being written, intimations of corrupt local government practices were at last beginning to surface in the northeastern press, but the full implications would not be revealed until after the ﬁlm’s release when Poulson, Cunningham and Smith would all receive gaol sentences. The venality of these men did not, however, prevent them from believing that they had made a genuine contribution to the economic regeneration of the north. As T. Dan Smith whinged after his conviction:\n\nGET CARTER\n\n42\n\nFor all the work I have done for the community, for all the early promise of distinction and power, I am left with nothing [ … ] People like me are expected to work full-time without salaries, without staff, or even postage stamp"
