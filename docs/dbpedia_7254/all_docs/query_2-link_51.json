        "text": "Census data shows how Britain's cultural makeup has changed over a 10-year period as the prominence of certain languages shifts\n\nPolish remains the most commonly spoken language other than English and Welsh, with 1.1% of the population speaking it\n\nThe number of Romanian speakers has leapt, entering the UK's top 10 languages for the first time\n\nFigures from the Office for National Statistics reveal some of the country's barely spoken languages being kept alive by a handful of people\n\nEnglish is the world's most spoken language, with more than 1.5 billion people able to speak it as their first or additional language.\n\nIt is – unsurprisingly – the dominant language in England and Wales. The vast majority have English as their mother tongue and just 0.3% of the population are unable to speak it.\n\nEngland and Wales are however home to more than 90 languages and dialects, according to new Office for National Statistics (ONS) data.\n\nSome are more prominent than others, with a modest 16 people in the two countries speaking Ulster Scots, and just eight speaking Manx Gaelic as a main language.\n\nCensus data released today shows that the most popular language, excluding English and Welsh, is Polish, which is spoken by 1.1%, of the population, or 612,000 people.\n\nRead more: Energy companies urged to give £400 discount to households who are missing out\n\nRead more: Census 2021: Minority identify as Christian in England and Wales for the first time\n\nExcluding English, it has remained the most commonly spoken language since the 2011 census.\n\nAlmost half of the main languages spoken other than English are European, while roughly a quarter are South Asian.\n\nWatch: The Most Commonly Spoken Languages in Every US State — Other Than English and Spanish\n\nRomanian has shot up from 19th in 2011, to second place, with an estimated 0.8% of the population, or 472,000 people, speaking it, compared to 0.1%, or 68,000 people 10 years previously.\n\nIt has pushed Panjabi down to number three, and Urdu down to four. Meanwhile Bengali has dropped from four to eight, while Portuguese and Spanish have risen four places to fifth and sixth.\n\nRead more: How much tax do we pay in the UK compared to other countries?\n\nThe number of residents who speak English and Welsh as a first language has also fallen slightly, from 92.3% in 2011 to 91.1% in 2021.\n\nHowever, as the population has grown in those 10 years, this translates to 52.6 million people with English or Welsh as a main language in 2021, compared to 49.8 million in 2011.\n\nThere is now a further 7.1%, or 4.1 million people, who are proficient in English or Welsh, but don't speak it as their main language.\n\nIt comes as Britain continues to be increasingly diverse, with 81.7% (48.7 million) of usual residents in England and Wales identifying their ethnic group as white in 2021, a decrease from 86.0% (48.2 million) in the 2011 census.\n\nSome 14 areas, including Leicester and Luton, now have a white population of less than 50%.\n\nOther tongues have become far more prevalent in the last decade, with Romanian in particularly soaring in use over the past decade.\n\nA handful of people are keeping some barely-spoken languages alive in England and Wales, with around 36 people speaking Irish Traveller Cant and 567 speaking Cornish."
