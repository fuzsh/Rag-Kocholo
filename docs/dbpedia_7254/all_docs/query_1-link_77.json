        "text": "Fight! - Stallone v. Schwarzenegger: A Rivalry of Muscular Proportions\n\nSo, I watched the original film with Caine a while ago, and honestly, I wasn’t the biggest fan. I didn't hate it, but there was something about the style and pacing that bothered me. So, to some extent, I was hoping maybe the 00s of it all might have fixed that. And it sorta did…\n\nUnfortunately, much of the movie's script and performance weren’t that good. Stallone has proven to be great as a vengeful vigilante, but sadly, here it felt kind of forced. All the brooding didn’t work. I never cared about the brother, nor did the script or Stallone do anything for me to care. The relationship with…\n\nThis movie would probably have been better if Stallone had just walked around wearing sunglasses and a suit for the entire runtime, while a soundtrack between techno and rock blared around him. A really confusing and nauseous movie in its style.\n\nA remake of the original Get Carter, which I knew nothing about, so I probably made a big mistake and watched this first, or I did the best option and I will appreciate the original movie if I ever get to see it, but I can say that this is not badass but an assbad movie.\n\nIf there was something fascinating I noticed about this movie, it was the show off between Mickey Rourke and Stallone about who had…\n\nRazzies 2001\n\nNominee - Worst Actor\n\nSylvester Stallone\n\nNominee - Worst Remake or Sequel\n\nAnother somewhat overlooked Stallone feature that unreasonably earned yet more Razzie disrespect for the stable Stallion. It's raw eggs and green ham when it comes to villains, molls, and henchmen. I loved Mickey Rourke as a shady, enterprising online pornographer. He's still in beefcake boxer mode here and is fitly imposing when he knocks Sly down and around. Far less beefy--but equally hammy--is Alan Cumming as an affluenza dot.com mogul, habitually rubbing Carter the wrong way. Cumming has one of the most punchable shitgrins in cinema.\n\nMiranda Richardson, Rhona Mitra, Gretchen Moll, and Rachel Leigh Cook play the various women in Carter's complicated mob life. Cook…"
