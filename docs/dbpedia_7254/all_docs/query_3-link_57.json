        "text": "Slater Slater Schulman LLP Founding & Managing Partner Adam Slater & Clients Sit Down With NBC New York\n\n18 SSS Clients Accuse CO \"Champagne\" of Assaulting Them While Incarcerated\n\nNEW YORK, Aug. 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Slater Slater Schulman LLP Founding and Managing Partner Adam Slater appeared on NBC New York to discuss the approximately 1,800 lawsuits that the firm has filed in New York State under the Adult Survivors Act (ASA). Earlier this week, non-profit newsroom Gothamist published an investigative report documenting the rampant sexual abuse and assaults committed by the same guard at the Rose M. Singer Center on New York's Rikers Island. \"Rosie's,\" as the facility is commonly known, is a women's jail; at least 24 women filed ASA suits naming \"Champagne,\" and 18 of those survivors are represented by Slater Slater Schulman.\n\n\"The fact that 18 individuals independently identified the same Rikers Island correctional officer as their perpetrator is staggering,\" said Adam Slater, Founding and Managing Partner of Slater Slater Schulman. \"These individuals did not know each other, and many were not in custody at the same time, yet they all knew his notorious nickname: Champagne. This situation is akin to cases where a Catholic priest, Boy Scouts troop leader, or medical doctor abuses a large group of victims over an extended period. What these cases have in common is that they involve people in positions of power and authority preying on highly vulnerable individuals.\"\n\nSlater, who has been recognized in recent months by both Forbes & Lawdragon, was interviewed by NBC's Chris Glorioso alongside clients Tasha Carter Beasley and Karen Klines. As reported by NBC & Gothamist, Carter Beasley and Klines were previously incarcerated at \"Rosie's.\" Through no fault of their own, both women would experience the systemic sexual abuse that has long persisted inside prison walls.\n\nIn an interview, Klines stated that she believed Rikers Island would be a refuge as she fought against addiction. Instead, she said she was assaulted and further traumatized by a correction officer inside the jail.\n\nAccording to Carter Beasley's account in Gothamist: \"Fant used his charm — and his power as an officer who oversaw detainees on maintenance duty — to get women alone in a facility packed with people. [Carter Beasley] said Fant's role gave him the authority to choose which women would work those shifts, pluck them out of crowded housing units and take them to isolated parts of the jail.\"\n\nAt the forefront of the allegations that these brave survivors have come forward with is that both state and federal prison systems have failed to implement adequate measures to prevent the widespread sexual abuse of incarcerated women by correctional staff.\n\nSlater Slater Schulman would like to acknowledge the dedicated and highly knowledgeable attorneys and paralegals overseeing the firm's Adult Survivors Act cases, particularly, Konstantin Yelisavetskiy, Managing Attorney of Slater Slater Schulman's New York office, and Ashley Florek Miller, Senior Associate. The firm would also like to thank its courageous clients, Karen Klines and Tasha Carter Beasley, for their bravery and advocacy.\n\nNOTE: Individuals seeking to be linked to resources for sexual assault survivors can call 800.656.HOPE (4673) to be connected with a trained staff member from a sexual assault service provider in your area.
