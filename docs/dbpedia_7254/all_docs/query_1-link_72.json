She earned her bachelor’s degree in German with an emphasis in teaching from USU in 2021. Janelle’s first language is English and she has been learning other languages since elementary school. She and her husband are now passing on their love for other languages and cultures and are raising their daughter with German as her first language. Janelle loves reading, listening to music, learning new languages, traveling to Germany, and baking. She is thrilled to be part of the MSLT program and is looking forward to meeting other language teachers and everything she will learn to become a better language teacher and learner herself."
