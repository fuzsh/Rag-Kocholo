        "text": "The stereotype of how many Miamians speak involves a sing-songy rhythm with a heavy-sounding “L” and a generous sprinkling of Spanglish. But what if the conversational language of South Florida were more than a lively accent? What if it were a distinct regional dialect of American English?\n\nPhillip M. Carter, a linguistics professor at Florida International University, argues that it already is. Miami English, he calls it. And he is on a mission to destigmatize it.\n\n“This is probably the most important bilingual situation in the Americas today,” Dr. Carter said.\n\nMore than 60 years of steady immigration from Spanish-speaking countries have heavily influenced the local English’s vowel system (Miami residents often speak English with Spanish vowel sounds), grammatical structure and lexicon, he explained: “English is influencing Spanish, but Spanish is also influencing English.”\n\nThe result is a version of English that is just as worthy of recognition as other widely accepted dialects, Dr. Carter said, such as the ones spoken in New York or in the American South."
