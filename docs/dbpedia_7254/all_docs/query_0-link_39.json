Other violence includes bloody shootings and a sequence in which a man's head is smashed through a window.\n\nsex\n\nExplicit pornographic images are shown to a group of men. Other scenes of sex include a man engaging in phone sex with a bare-breasted woman, who writhes on a bed, while caressing herself. There is also frequent female nudity throughout the film.\n\nsexual violence and sexual threat\n\nThere are references to a 16-year-old girl coerced into sex for a pornographic film; parts of the film are shown and depict a girl being groomed by an adult woman, forced to drink alcohol, and touched by both adult women and men. There is no strong visual detail of abuse.\n\nThere are scenes of drug misuse. There is infrequent strong language ('f**k'), accompanied by other milder terms ('bitch', 'whore', 'screwed', 'slag', 'bollocks', 'piss', 'sod', 'bloody', 'bastard', 'shit', 'Jesus', 'Christ' and 'God')."
