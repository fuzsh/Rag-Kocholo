        "text": "Translating is one of the most important tasks when we talk about successfully conveying a message. Although many people think translation is an easy task, this is far from the truth. Read this article to know the worst translation mistakes ever.\n\nTranslating requires expertise and professionalism from the people involved. When this does not happen, many mistakes can occur. Below you will find the worst translation mistakes made throughout history - and how to avoid them!\n\n1. That time when Nikita Khrushchev interpreter almost started WW III\n\nSoviet premier Nikita Khrushchev almost started World War III after a mistranslation in 1956. At a reception at the Polish Embassy in Moscow, the politician was interpreted as saying âWe will bury youâ to the guests, many of whom were ambassadors from western countries.\n\nNeedless to say, the repercussion of his speech was catastrophic not only at the event, but also in the press afterwards. His entire phrase - translated as âIf you donât like us, donât accept our invitations and donât invite us to come see you.\n\nWhether you like it or not, history is on our side. We will bury youâ - plastered across newspapers around the world, with many Americans considering it as a threat to their country. However, taken in context, his words were more likely directed to the capitalist system than to a specific country. Some translators suggest that his statement would be better translated as âWhether you like it or not, history is on our side. We will dig you inâ - which significantly takes down the threatening part of the speech.\n\nOthers defend that he used a common Russian phrase âWe will be present when you are buried,â which essentially means, âWe will outlast you.âOver the years, Khrushchev issued many explanations for his words. In 1959, while at the National Press Club in Washington, he said: âThe words âWe will bury capitalismâ should not be taken literally, as is done by ordinary gravediggers who carry a spade and dig graves and bury the dead. What I had in mind was the outlook for the development of human society. Socialism will inevitably succeed capitalismâ.\n\n2. When Jimmy Carter suffered from a series of translation mistakes in Poland\n\nU.S. President Jimmy Carter was not immune to mistranslations. One of the most famous cases of mistranslations that happened with the politician was when he traveled to Poland in 1977 for a news conference.\n\nThat is because, according to his interpreter, he had sexual desire for the soviet country. As you can guess, those were not his exact words. What happened was that the professional responsible for translating Carterâs lines mangled his words. Hence, he used Russian terms and abused the Polish language. This led to a number of translation mistakes, such as when the desire of the U.S. President to âcome to learn your opinions and understand your desires for the futureâ turned into an erotic desire to âget to know the Poles carnallyâ.\n\nAnother example of the translation mistakes done at the event was the phrase âI left the United States this morningâ said by Carter, that was turned into âI left the United States, never to returnâ by the interpreter. After those unfortunate mistakes, another interpreter was chosen to translate Jimmy Carterâs words - which did not improve the situation. Due to Carterâs southern accent, the translator remained silent for most of his speech.\n\n3. When Justin Trudeau speech at the White House was mistakenly translated\n\nHistoryâs biggest translation fails are not all from the great past. Justin Trudeau 2016 speech at the White House is a great example that politicians of all times can suffer from a bad translation. Americans who watched Trudeau speech on ABC TV saw him praising on âNazi inningsâ, ârailroad stations in Motorolaâ and talking about âus old guysâ. But did he actually say that?Of course not. According to ABC, the mistakes were made by a computer program that automatically translated his words from French to English. Since it was a machine and not the person behind the translation, the computer was not able to understand the context of the speech nor Trudeauâs accent.\n\n4. The âDo Nothingâ HSBC Slogan\n\nNot only politicians can suffer from bad translation cases. The HSBC Bank slogan was translated worldwide from âAssume Nothingâ to âDo Nothingâ. Since then, the company spent millions of dollars in an attempt to rebrand itself. Afterwards, they used the tagline âThe world's private bankâ, leaving no room for other translation mistakes.\n\n5. Another time when Jimmy Carter suffered with translation mistakes\n\nBack in 1981, when the U.S. President Jimmy Carter was visiting Japan, he was mesmerized at the laughs he received when telling his opening anecdote at a small Methodist college in the country. Surprised by the audience response, Carter asked his translator to explain how he managed to achieve such a reaction. The answer was simple: the interpreter reluctantly revealed his exact words to the public were, âPresident Carter told a funny story. Everyone must laughâ.\n\n6. When a poor translation may have caused the first atomic bombing in the world\n\nThis is probably the most infamous case of an ill translation that caused serious consequences to the history of the world. At the verge of winning World War II, the then-called Allies sent a different number of terms about Japanâs surrender. When the press asked Japanese Premier Kantaro Suzuk about such terms, he responded with the word âMokusatsuâ. âMokusatsuâ can mean either âno commentsâ or âa treat with silent contemptâ. While most Japanese translators chose the first option of translation, which was not the meaning chosen by international news agencies. This was received as a threat to the countryâs surrender. Thus, it may have influenced the U.S. decision to drop the atomic bomb on Hiroshima.\n\nCompanies can also make translation mistakes\n\nProfessionals are not always the ones to blame after an ill-chosen translation. That is because translating is a really complex matter that involves not only proficiency in both languages.\n\n1. When Facebook celebrated an earthquake\n\nAfter a deadly earthquake happened in Indonesia back in 2018, many people used social media to talk about their status. Surprisingly, many were astonished by the fact that Facebook had added balloons and confetti to some of those posts. The cause of this misunderstanding was the usage of the Indonesian word âselamatâ, that means âto surviveâ, âbe safeâ or âcongratulationsâ. Facebook algorithm misinterpreted the context of the comments, thus adding festive animations of balloons and confetti.Afterwards, Facebookâs Spokesperson clarified the situation stating that the company âregrets that it appeared in this unfortunate contextâ.\n\n2. Netflix\n\nThe biggest streaming platform can also be in the eye of a translation controversy. This happened this year after the release of the Korean show Squid Games. After the success following the showâs premiere, many Korean speaking people have been talking about subtle translation mistakes in Squid Gamesâ English subtitles. In most parts, the translations do not take Koreaâs social and economic context in place when trying to convey the charactersâ lines.\n\nHow to avoid translation mistakes"
