        "text": "MOFAREH ALQAHTANI\n\nAbstract:\n\nVocabulary learning is an essential part in foreign language learning as the meanings of new words are very often emphasized, whether in books or in classrooms. It is also central to language teaching and is of paramount importance to a language learner. Recent research indicate that teaching vocabulary may be problematic because many teachers are not confident about best practice in vocabulary teaching and at times don’t know where to begin to form an instructional emphasis on word learning (Berne & Blachowicz, 2008) In this article, I summarizes important research on the impotence of vocabulary and explaining many techniques used by English teachers when teaching English, as well as my own personal view of these issues.\n\nKeywords:\n\nVocabulay\n\nDOI: 10.52950/TE.2015.3.3.002\n\nPDF:\n\nDownload\n\nAPA citation:\n\nMOFAREH ALQAHTANI (2015).
