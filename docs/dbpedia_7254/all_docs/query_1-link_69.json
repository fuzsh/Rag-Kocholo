Here's 3 things my best students changed to speak English fluently and confidently 🚀👇 1. STOP typing new vocabulary and phrases in apps or on your phone. Write on paper instead! New research proves this to be more effective for language learning and memory retention. Old-school methods sometimes are the best! 🖋️ 2. STOP listening to audio podcasts all the time. Take some time to sit down and watch speakers on screen instead. Pronunciation and articulation involve the physical actions of the mouth. You need to HEAR and SEE the speaker to improve in this area. 👄 3. DON'T assume that daily listening and reading will improve your English speaking skills. If you want to speak English well then you need to actually SPEAK! Speak to yourself as you go about your day in English and record yourself using WhatsApp voice messages. Find a way to speak out loud every day.📣 Change these 3 things to be great at speaking English!😊🇬🇧 Do you do any of these? #speakenglish #englishtips #englishlearning"
