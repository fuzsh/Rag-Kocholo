        "text": "Types of Language\n\nIf you read or watch different types of programming, you will probably notice that there is a difference in language use based on the environment, who you are talking to, and the reason for communicating. In this section, we will discuss the different types of language. The types of language used will impact how others view you and if they will view you positively or negatively.\n\nFormal vs. Informal Language\n\nYou probably know by now that how we communicate in different contexts can vary greatly. For example, how you compose a text to your best friend is going to use different grammatical structures and words than when you compose an email to your professor. One of the main reasons for this difference is because of formal and informal language. Table 4.1 provides a general overview of the major differences between formal and informal language.\n\nTable 4.1 Formal vs. Informal Language\n\nFormal Language\n\nWhen applying for a job, you will most likely use formal language in your cover letter and resume. Formal language is official and academic language. You want to appear intelligent and capable, so formal language helps you accomplish those goals. Formal language often occurs when we write. Formal language uses full sentences and is grammatically correct. Formal language is more objective and more complex. Most legal agreements are written in formal language.\n\nInformal Language\n\nInformal language is common, everyday language, which might include slang words. It is continuous and casual. We use informal language when we talk to other people. It is more simple. Informal language tends to use more contractions and abbreviations. If you look at your text messages, you will probably see several examples of informal language.\n\nJargon\n\nJargon is the specialized or technical language of a specific group or profession that may not be understood by outsiders.23 If you are really into cars or computers, you probably know a lot about the different parts and functions. Jargon is normally used in a specific context and may be understood outside that context. Jargon consists of a specific vocabulary that uses words that only certain people understand.\n\nThe business world is full of jargon. Joanna Cutrara created a list of 14 commonly heard jargon phrases used in the business world:24 ‌ ‌ ‌\n\nLow Hanging Fruit\n\nLeverage\n\nOpen the Kimono\n\nGiving 110%\n\nOut of Pocket\n\nDrink the Kool-Aid\n\nBio Break\n\nBlue Sky Training\n\nTiger Team\n\nIdea Shower or Thought Shower\n\nMoving the Goal Post\n\nDrill Down\n\nGain Traction\n\nIf you’re like us, chances are you’ve heard a few of these jargon phrases in your workplace. Heck, you may have even found yourself using a few of them. Your workplace may even have some specific jargon only used in your organization. Take a minute and think through all of the jargon you hear on an average day.\n\nColloquialisms\n\nColloquialisms are the use of informal words in communication.25 Colloquialism varies from region to region. Examples might be “wanna” instead of “want to” or “gonna” instead of “going to.” It shows us how a society uses language in their everyday lives. Here’s a short list of some common colloquialisms you may have used yourself:\n\nBamboozle – to deceive\n\nBe blue – to be sad\n\nBeat around the bush – to avoid a specific topic\n\nBuzz off – go away\n\nFell through the cracks – to be neglected\n\nGo bananas, or go nuts – go insane or be very angry\n\nGobsmacked – shocked\n\nGonna – going to\n\nHit a writer’s block – unable to write\n\nHit the hay – to go to sleep\n\nPop into my head – to have a new thought\n\nSticktoitiveness – to be persistent\n\nThrew me for a loop – to be surprised\n\nThrow someone under the bus – to throw the blame on another person\n\nWanna – want to\n\nY’all – you all\n\nYinz – you all\n\nSlang\n\nSlang refers to words that are employed by certain groups, such as young adults and teens.26 Slang is more common when speaking to others rather than written. Slang is often used with people who are similar and have experience with each other. Here is a list of some common slang terms you may use in your day-to-day life:\n\nBAE (baby / before all else)\n\nOn Fleek (looking perfect)\n\nBye Felica (saying goodbye to someone you don’t like)\n\nThe Tea (gossip)\n\nBro (typically a male friend)\n\nCash (money)\n\nCheesy (cheap or tacky)\n\nShip (wanting people to be in a relationship, whether real or fictional)\n\nFrenemy (someone who is both a friend and an enemy)\n\nThirsty (being overly eager or desperate)\n\nThrow Shade (to insult another person)\n\nWoke (being acutely aware of social injustice within society)\n\nHow many of these slang words do you use? What other slang words do you find yourself using? When it comes to slang, it’s important to understand that this list is constantly evolving. What is common slang today could be completely passé tomorrow. What’s common slang in the United States is not universal in English speaking countries.\n\nIdioms\n\nIdioms are expressions or figures of speech whose meaning cannot be understood by looking at the individual words and interpreting them literally. Idioms can help amplify messages. Idioms can be used to provide artistic expression. For instance, “knowledge is power!”\n\nIdioms can be hard to grasp for non-native speakers. As such, many instructors in the English as a Second Language world spend a good deal of time trying to explain idioms to non-native speakers. Table 4.2 presents a wide array of different idioms.\n\nHere is a video below of a non-native English speaker providing an example of how Figurative Language (such as an idiom) can be so confusing:\n\nTable 4.2 A wide array of different idioms Idiom Explanation\n\nish\n\nAbout.

Clichés are common and can often be heard. For instance, “light as a feather” or “happily ever after” are common clichés. They are important because they express ideas and thoughts that are popular in everyday use. They are prevalent in advertisements, television, and literature.\n\nImproper Language\n\nImproper language is not proper, correct, or applicable in certain situations.29 There are two different types of improper language: vulgarity and cursing. First, vulgarity includes language that is offensive or lacks good taste. Often, vulgar is lewd or obscene. Second, cursing is language that includes evil, doom, misfortune on a person or group. It can also include curse or profane words. People might differ in their perceptions about improper language. ‌ ‌ ‌\n\nBiased Language\n\nBiased language is language that shows preference in favor of or against a certain point-of-view, shows prejudice, or is demeaning to others. Bias in language is uneven or unbalanced. Examples of this may include “mankind” as opposed to “humanity.”\n\nTable 4.3 Biased Language\n\nAvoid\n\nConsider Using\n\nBlack Attorney\n\nAttorney\n\nBusinessman\n\nBusinessperson, Business Owner, Executive, Leader, Manager, etc.\n\nChairman\n\nChair or Chairperson\n\nCleaning Lady / Maid\n\nCleaner, Cleaning Person, Housecleaner, Housekeeper, Maintenance Worker, Office Cleaner, etc.\n\nMale Nurse\n\nNurse\n\nMale Flight Attendant or Stewardess\n\nFlight Attendant\n\nFemale Doctor\n\nPhysician or Doctor\n\nManpower\n\nPersonnel or Staff\n\nCongressman\n\nLegislator, Member of Congress, or Member of the House of Representatives\n\nPostman\n\nPostal Employee or Letter carrier\n\nForefather\n\nAncestor\n\nPoliceman\n\nPolice Officer / Law Enforcement Officer\n\nFireman\n\nFirefighter\n\nDisabled\n\nPeople with Disabilities\n\nSchizophrenic\n\nPerson Diagnosed with Schizophrenia\n\nHomosexual\n\nLesbians, Gay Men, Bisexual Men or Women\n\nOne specific type of biased language is called spin, or the manipulation of language to achieve the most positive interpretation of words, to gain political advantage, or to deceive others. In essence, people utilizing spin can make language choices that frame themselves or their clients in a positive way.\n\nAmbiguous Language\n\nAmbiguous language is language that can have various meanings. Google Jay Leno’s headlines videos. Sometimes he uses advertisements that are very abstract. For instance, there is a restaurant ad that says, “People are our best ingredient!” What comes to mind when you hear that? Are they actually using people in their food? Or do they mean their customer service is what makes their restaurant notable?\n\nWhen we are trying to communicate with others, it is important that we are clear in our language. We need others to know exactly what we mean and not imply meaning. That is why you need to make sure that you don’t use ambiguous language. ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌\n\nEuphemisms\n\nEuphemisms also make language unclear. People use euphemisms as a means of saying something more politely or less bluntly. For instance, instead of telling your parents/guardians that you failed a test, you might say that you did sub-optimal. People use euphemisms because it sounds better, and it seems like a better way to express how they feel. People use euphemisms all the time. For instance, instead of saying this person died, they might say the person passed away. Instead of saying that someone farted, you might say someone passed gas.\n\nRelative Language\n\nRelative language depends on the person communicating. People’s backgrounds vary. Hence, their perspectives will vary. I know a college professor that complains about her salary. However, other college professors would love to have a salary like hers. In other words, our language is based on our perception of our experiences. For instance, if someone asked you what would be your ideal salary, would it be based on your previous salary? Your parents? Your friends? Language is relative because of that reason. If I said, “Let’s go eat at an expensive restaurant,” what would be expensive for you? For some person, it would be $50, for another, $20, for someone else it might be $10, and yet there might be someone who would say $5 is expensive!\n\nStatic Evaluation\n\nOften times, we think that people and things do not change, but they do change. If you ever watch afternoon talk shows, you might see people who go through amazing transformations, perhaps through weight loss, a makeover, or surgery or some sort. These people changed. Static evaluation states\n\nthat things are not constant. Things vary over time, and our language should be representative of that change. For instance, Max is bad. It is important to note that Max might be bad at one time or may have displayed bad behavior, but it may not represent how Max will be in the future."
