        "text": "“Get Carter” picks up the battered bricks of noir to build a new brand of crime film.\n\nLacking a trowel - director Mike Hodges seals the structure of “Carter” with gunpowder and gumption.\n\nHodges originally set out to depict a realistic version of North East England gangland through a biopic of the infamous Kray twins. Before production started, he happened upon the novel “Jack’s Return Home,” and instead pivoted to adapt that story with inspirations from the likes of Robert Aldrich and Raymond Chandler.\n\nIf there is one moment to pinpoint when the shadowy noirs of the past exploded into the breed of bombastic criminal clashes later to be realized by the likes of Tarantino and Ritchie - it’s here. …\n\nNormally I'm not all that bothered by villainous figures in films being wrongly appropriated as more heroic figures and made icons of for the benefits of pop culture. But the appearance of a shotgun wielding Jack Carter on mugs, t-shirts, posters and much more down the years DOES bother me.\n\nI'm not even sure why. It could be because Mike Hodges, a director who distressingly went to crap just a few years after Get Carter, does such a great job of making Michael Caine's character such a contemptible piece of shit that I can hardly fathom why he has become so widely adored. He just seems to be a cut above the usual villains that are embraced as anti-heroes.\n\nCarter…\n\n\"Listen. The only reason I came back to this craphouse was to find out who did it, and I'm not leaving until I do. You understand?\"\n\nIt's already an hour into the movie when Jack Carter utters this promise to a slovenly whore as his hands tighten around her arms and his jawline extends with menace. He's had enough traversing down the seedy underbelly of non-answers to his brother's murder and is at a breaking point. From moment one, it's clear that Carter is someone you don't want to fuck with, a man who can and will take on anyone for the right reaction and he becomes more unhinged as the story progresses. This is the core joy in Get…\n\nMichael Caine stars as Jack Carter, a London gangster who returns to his hometown—a gritty northern English city—to avenge his brother's murder. Under the direction of Hodges, Caine delivers a masterfully restrained and subtle performance, one that perfectly captures the tension of the criminal underworld and the nuances of a bygone era. Hodges captures the grittiness of the environment, shooting with long takes and utilizing natural lighting to create a brooding aesthetic. He elevates the atmosphere further with his editing techniques, which add tension and create an energetic environment of corruption. The result is a gripping and unique crime drama, one that displays the talents of both Caine and Hodges in all their glory. Get Carter is a brave and…\n\nGet Carter is a movie for grown-ups. Didn’t realize ‘til halfway in that I’m unaccustomed to watching films like this that take their time, don’t pander to the audience, and assume you’ve got sufficient brains to follow convoluted plot. No hand-holding here, darling. No rush. Movies that refuse to condescend are rare these days. We’re spoon-fed easy answers & entertained to death, or else we complain.\n\nBut what about the long con? What about slow build, and characters that don’t make any sense… until they do? Can’t say I loved Get Carter, but I respect what it represents. It’s a genuine callback. A callback to a time when you had to think to understand what the hell’s going down. Three Days of…"
