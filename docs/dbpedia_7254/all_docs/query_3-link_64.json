        "text": "Get Carter\n\nTheatrical poster\n\nCountry United Kingdom Directed by Mike Hodges Release Date 1971 Language English Studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer British Studios Distributor Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)\n\nMain Cast Character Actor Jack Carter Michael Caine Eric Paice Ian Hendry Anna Britt Ekland Cyril Kinnear John Osborne Peter George Sewell Keith Alun Armstrong Peter Tony Beckley\n\nGet Carter is a 1971 crime film starring Michael Caine as Jack Carter, an enforcer for some London mobsters who seeks revenge after being set up. The film was an adaptation of author Ted Lewis' novel Jack's Return Home. A remake starring Sylvester Stallone as Carter and Michael Caine as a different character was released in 2000.\n\nThe following weapons were used in the film Get Carter (1971):\n\nWARNING! THIS PAGE CONTAINS SPOILERS!\n\nPistols\n\nSIG P210\n\nJack Carter (Michael Caine) carries a SIG P210 as his sidearm, using it mostly during the gunfight on the ferry.\n\nWalther PP\n\nCon McCarty (George Sewell) appears to pull a Walther PP. Jack Carter (Michael Caine) takes the pistol from him.\n\nShotguns\n\n12 Gauge Double Barreled Shotgun\n\nJack Carter (Michael Caine) finds a 12 Gauge Double Barreled Shotgun in his dead brother's house, and decides to take it. What's interesting is that, despite the fact he's extensively seen with the shotgun, he does not fire it in the film. In the book that inspired the film, Jack Returns Home, the shotgun is meant to symbolise Jack's memories of going hunting with his brother, but in the film this meaning is lost.\n\nRemington Model 31\n\nPeter (Tony Beckley) uses what appears to be a Remington Model 31 shotgun with a shortened barrel and buttstock during the gunfight with Carter on the ferry.\n\nIthaca 37\n\nNumerous posters for the film feature Carter with an Ithaca 37 shotgun with a shortened barrel and modified buttstock, but these images were taken from publicity photos and Jack never actually uses the shotgun in the film.\n\nRifles\n\nRemington Model 700"
