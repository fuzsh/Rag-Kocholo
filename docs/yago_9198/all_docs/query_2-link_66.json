        "text": "Hollywood, CA - The smoothly muscular, golden silhouette of an Oscar statuette wasn't just based on anyone. It was actually modeled in 1929 after the nude body of Mexican director, screenwriter, and actor Emilio Fernandez.\n\nNicknamed \"El Indio,\" Fernandez fled Mexico for Los Angeles in the 1920s, exiled after supporting a failed revolutionary uprising led by Adolfo de la Huerta.\n\nWhile working in Hollywood, Fernandez befriended Mexican actress Dolores del Rio, then wife of studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's art director and Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences member Cedric Gibbons. Del Rio introduced Fernandez to Gibbons, who was in charge of supervising the statuette's design.\n\nGibbons asked Fernandez to pose in the buff for a sketch to create the basis for the 8.5 pound trophy. Reluctantly, Fernandez did, and the design became the foundation for artist George Stanley's famous sculpture of the statuette, given out at the very first Academy Awards in Los Angeles in 1929. That design remains the same to this day.\n\nFernandez acted in dozens of movies. He directed more than 40 films, including \"Maria Candelaria,\" starring del Rio, which won the Grand Prix prize for best feature film at the 1946 Cannes International Film Festival. He passed away in 1986.\n\nThe 84th annual Academy Awards, honoring films in 24 categories, airs Feb. 26 on ABC."
