        "text": "Flamenco artist Paloma Ríos is set to premier her new work Flamexicana at the upcoming Flamenco Certamen USA! Flamexicana, honors the legacy of Juana Catarina Romero, a Tehuantepec cigarette vendor turned spy who later became a woman of wealth and political influence in an era before female empowerment.\n\nPaloma Ríos’ flamenco career commenced at age 15. Thereafter, she lived in Spain, studying under numerous legends, namely Pilar “la “ and Rosario Montoya “la Farruca”, and performed in Sevilla’s tablaos. In the past decade she has established herself amongst her peers in her home of NYC. Most recently she studied in Madrid with Belen Fernandez and Adela Campallo and has shared the stage with Grammy-winning guitarist Antonio Rey.\n\nWitness Paloma’s unique interpretation of her cultural roots through a flamenco lens––secure your tickets to the Flamenco Certamen USA!\n\nNatallia Basava shares her experience of the prize she won at last year’s Flamenco Certamen USA––a week of study at the famed Festival de Jerez:\n\n“Attending sunny Jerez de la Frontera during the Flamenco Festival in February was like finding myself in flamenco paradise. Walking through streets full of old architecture and flamenco history, seeing artists at the tables of local restaurants, dancing my way through morning flamenco classes (with the amazing Antonio El Pipa at a beautiful studio just two blocks away from my hotel), visiting flamenco peñas in the afternoons, watching evening shows at the Villamarta Theater, catching nightly bulerías singing at the bar (I was lucky to experience it in Peña Flamenca Luis de la Pica) made every day perfect!\n\nIt was very easy to make friends––after a few days I felt like I knew half of the town. Even if you’re standing in line to enter the popular La Guarida del Ángel flamenco club at night you’re bound to run into many people from уour morning class there.\n\nOf course, one week was not enough… so I’ll be back for sure!”"
