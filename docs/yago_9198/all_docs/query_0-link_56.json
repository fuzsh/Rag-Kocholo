        "text": "As the Flamenco Certamen USA approaches fast, the finalists are gearing up for a rewarding residency at Windhover Center for the Performing Arts! For five days, these rising artists will fully immerse themselves in flamenco, training closely with esteemed mentors and musicians. This year’s mentors are Emilio Ochando and Fanny Ara, who will provide unparalleled support in conjunction with musicians Guillermo Guillén (toque) and José Moreno (cante.) Learn more about each of them:\n\nEMILIO OCHANDO, from Valencia, received his professional certification from the Real Conservatorio Profesional de Madrid. He has worked internationally in tablao as well as with Domingo Ortega, Nuevo Ballet Español, Rafael Aguilar and Flamenco Vivo Carlota Santana. He directs and choreographs for his own company, and his work, CLÁSICA TRADICIÓN, was nominated for the Premio Max in 2020. Emilio choreographed and directed El Cuadregésimo, which premiered this past June at the Joyce Theater in celebration of Flamenco Vivo’s 40th Anniversary. He is a guest teacher and choreographer for companies in the UK, Europe, and North America.\n\nFANNY ARA, from the French Basque country, is an award-winning choreographer, performer and instructor. Fanny has been an invited artist in national and international festivals and has toured extensively in Canada, Central and South America, the Middle East, Africa, and throughout Europe. She received five nominations from the Isadora Duncan Dance Awards and in 2012 New York’s Vilcek Foundation awarded Fanny a prestigious finalist prize for “Creative Promise in Dance”. Fanny has been part of Flamenco vivo since 2007. Her new choreographic work, Lilith, will premiere in February of 2024.\n\nGUILLERMO GUILLÉN (Toque) is an exquisitely artful and eclectic flamenco guitarist, composer and arranger whose sensitivity and creativity make him a highly sought-after musical collaborator for live performances and studio work, from the most traditional flamenco to adventurous experimental projects. Born and raised in France, Guillén trained in Spain, and has performed and taught flamenco internationally for over 20 years. He is the founder of FlamencoMaps, the online educational and teaching resource center and YouTube channel. Thousands of flamenco lovers from around the world have benefited from his highly effective classes and instructional videos."
