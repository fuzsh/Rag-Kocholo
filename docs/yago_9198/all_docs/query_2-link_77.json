Earlier this year we presented Fernando de Fuentes's searing examination of the Revolution in his celebrated trilogy from the 1930s. The struggle of class and values was replayed throughout Mexican cinema's “Golden Age,” in the melodramas of El Indio Emilio Fernández and the raw aesthetic power of Gabriel Figueroa's cinematography, which the painter David Siqueiros called “murals that travel”; in the rumberas with their Afro-Cuban rhythms, brothel settings, and moody stars; even in the wildly clever comedies of Cantinflas and Tin Tan. Our historical survey also includes some rarities that defy categorization, such as a morphine-laced silent drama from 1927. As A. O. Scott recently wrote in the New York Times, “There is a frankness in these films that would never have passed muster with the Hays Office.”...\n\nThe Mexican Revolution was hardly over when it began to be interpreted on the screen. But did it ever end? Earlier this year we presented Fernando de Fuentes's searing examination of the Revolution in his celebrated trilogy from the 1930s. The struggle of class and values was replayed throughout Mexican cinema's “Golden Age,” in the melodramas of El Indio Emilio Fernández and the raw aesthetic power of Gabriel Figueroa's cinematography, which the painter David Siqueiros called “murals that travel”; in the rumberas with their Afro-Cuban rhythms, brothel settings, and moody stars; even in the wildly clever comedies of Cantinflas and Tin Tan. Our historical survey also includes some rarities that defy categorization, such as a morphine-laced silent drama from 1927. As A. O. Scott recently wrote in the New York Times, “There is a frankness in these films that would never have passed muster with the Hays Office.”\n\nPassionate and outspoken by anyone's standards, Mexican popular cinema shows us the way to the brilliantly subversive films of Luis Buñuel in the 1950s and the resurgence of this bold artistic tradition starting in the 1970s in the hands of Arturo Ripstein, Paul Leduc, Jorge Fons, and Felipe Cazals. As our series shows, it continues in a new generation in the films of Dana Rotberg, María Novaro, Maryse Sistach, and Gerardo Tort.\n\nWe invite you to join us for PFA's Mexican marathon throughout November and December."
