        "text": "She grows up between her grandfathers’ ranch and the former town of Real de Minas, in Álamos, distant from typical women’s games of the time: even as a little girl, she rides horses with her brothers.\n\nShe lives an anecdotal childhood that takes place between sleepwalking and stuttering.\n\nIn the film La Mujer de todos (Everyone’s Woman), she performs with Ernesto Alonso, who has a short role as her suicide lover. Dressed in an iconic dress, the actress develops a sequence that would be recorded in the history of Mexican cinema by portraying the coldness and despotism of the main character.\n\nERNESTO: My father knows everything and I am lost. I do not know what to do!\n\nMARÍA: Go home and ask for forgiveness.\n\nERNESTO: I don’t know how to ask for forgiveness.\n\nMARÍA: Then learn how.\n\nERNESTO: What about our love? María, I can barely believe you are coming to this dinner party.\n\nMARÍA: You must learn how to forget, too.\n\nERNESTO: Is that all you have to tell me?\n\nMARÍA: What else could I tell you?\n\nERNESTO: A word that helps me live.\n\nMARÍA: Forget me.\n\nThe screenwriter adapts the original screenplay to include a romantic serenade performed by Pedro Armendáriz singing La Malagueña. The beautiful shoot includes a long close up to her eyes and cuts to Pedro, and was one of the most beautiful gifts ever made to her, since it immortalized her beauty. The frame of the shoot that Figueroa chose was so charming and special, that many directors have tried to match it throughout history, although none have succeeded.\n\nHer image is immortalized in a sculpture under the name of La noche del sábado (Saturday Night). She finds in the European chisels the pretext for a plot full of aesthetic splendor, lavishness, aristocracy and obeisance. Myth and reality merge and Imperia’s voice seemed to be her own:\n\n“To do something big in life we have to destroy reality; set aside the ghosts that block our way. Follow, as the only reality, the path of our dreams towards the ideal, where souls fly on their Saturday night, some towards evil, to lose themselves in it as spirits of darkness; others towards good, to live eternally as spirits of light and love.”\n\nOn May 13, Faustina is premiered at the Gran Vía cinema in Madrid. Myth and reality merge into a 43-year-old woman, who looks as young as ever. Her portrayal of the sinister title character in the movie, allows her to incorporate in his statements and interviews the world of magic, sorcery, witches, tarot and evil beings with whom she would later nourish, in her mature age, the story about having gone down to hell and talk to the Devil.\n\nThe feature film La estrella vacía (The Empty Star), based on the homonymous novel by Luis Spota, establishes evident parallelisms between the life of the character Olga Lang and her own life. The limits blur when María Félix appears as María Félix in the role of Olga wearing her very own jewelry, gowns and furs tailored by Christian Dior Couture, as well as the wedding dress she wore to marry Alex Berger. Everything Olga does is considered to be part of the real personality of María. The press cannot help to compare both women, real and fictional. But she argues: – Empty? – Who has seen my insides?\n\nIn Juana Gallo, the revolutionary theme again allows her to play a character of high scenic strength. It seems as if screenwriters and directors were committed to use every opportunity they had to dress her as a man: as it happened in The Lieutenant Nun and in The Soldiers of Pancho Villa, and as it would happen in her last shot movie La Generala, she appears on the screen wearing a stylized variant of a beautiful man suit that gets embellished by her expressive eyes.\n\nIn La bandida (The Bandida), she displays a wide range of emotions: she cries, laughs, sings, suffers, insults and fights in what seems to be the most vigorous role of her career. Her portrayal of a prostitute that falls in love shakes once again the double moral standards of the time, even though at the end of the movie the main character loses all arguments, victim of a society that considers that a prostitute has no right to be happy.\n\nIn the maturity of both her career and life, with 49 years, when filming Amor y sexo (Love and Sex), she agrees to shoot several suggestive bed scenes and a nude one with Julio Alemán. Actually, the original screenplay did not consider such scenes: she was the one to propose them so as to improve one of the prison scenes with a more dramatic tone. Not only does the scene scandalize society by its nature, but also by the fact of raising a loving relationship between a man and a woman older than him.\n\nIn the library of a Parisian friend it is found a portrait unknown to her in which she appears with an indigenous mantle covering her head. She decides to take ownership of the painting, and with that it begins the search for the painter, to whom she will later on commission a similar painting. In this way she meets Antoine Tzapoff in October. She decides to keep both paintings, and asks Pedro Leites from prestigious silversmithing house TANE to create a rotating silver frame so as to ensemble both paintings together.\n\nShe returns to international television in the program La Movida, hosted by Verónica Castro, who interviews her extensively. For the purposes of the interview, she moves part of the home furniture and her artistic collections to a studio, with which she touches the heart of new audiences and generations. The interview is a true display of beauty and mature intelligence that is accompanied by great guests who pay tribute to her. The interview breaks all audience records and becomes a cult reference for those who follow her legacy.\n\nCartier pays the first tribute to the memory, personality and style of one of its main clients with the launch of the La Doña wrist watch. She becomes the only actress to be distinguished with the creation of a luxury goods collection (watches, bags, earrings, feathers) named after her. The presentation of the collection takes place in Mexico, where only a select group of guests has the opportunity to see, for the last time, all the artistic pieces that would surprisingly go on auction.\n\nThe sale of the artistic collections of the actress continues: now it is the turn of the pictorial exhibition of Antoine Tzapoff, Los Indios de México, which is accompanied by portraits that were in the Casa de las Tortugas, as well as in her houses in the Polanco neighborhood and Paris. In a few weeks, more than sixty paintings are sold, satisfying market demand.\n\nOn April 8, the Foundation is formally launched with the presentation of the exhibition María Félix: 100 años de esplendor (María Félix: 100 Years of Splendor), in the facilities of the Mexico City subway –the glorious outcome of that project that she considered not only as a personal gift from her husband, but also as a gift for her country. More than eight million people have the opportunity to see for the first time a selection of her film costumes and personal gowns.\n\nThe Foundation, together with the Ministry of Culture of the Government of Mexico City and the Metro Collective Transportation System, issue ten million commemorative subway tickets alluding to the centenary of her birth, as well as one hundred thousand rechargeable subway cards with the designs of Juan Alberto Flores Rojas. From this date on, a subway train decorated with her face and name will circulate daily on line 7 (Barranca del Muerto-Rosario) of the Mexican City Metro system.\n\nThanks to the initiative of the association that would later be consolidated under the name of Fomento Social María Félix, A.C., created by Walter López Rivera, is rescued an old square for which La Doña had donated a bust. The square is rehabilitated and, together with the City Council of Cuernavaca, Morelos, it is inaugurated as the first square in the country named after her.\n\nThe creation and legal-nominative establishment of the organization Estate of María Félix SA de CV, directed by Walter López Rivera, finally rectifies the legal vacuum that was generated after the death of the actress, which had allowed the indiscriminate use of her image, the use of false information that negatively impacted her cultural heritage in the history of Mexico, and other actions that morally deteriorated her figure. The organization Legado María Félix is an international authority in charge of taking the necessary actions for safeguarding the proper use of all images and information related to the professional and personal trajectory of La Doña."
