English Premier League side Sunderland AFC has officially launched its Umbro 2010/11 home kit. The launch follows Sunderlands’ late June unveiling of its 10/11 Umbro away kit.

According to the Black Cats’ website:

Like the recently revealed away kit, Sunderland’s new home strip has been crafted using the smart, stylish aesthetic that has inspired all of Umbro’s current designs for its top clubs.In the club’s traditional red and white stripes, the home shirt is constructed using lightweight and breathable fabric.

A mesh-vent seam under the arm aids this ventilation.

There’s a modern touch to the Black Cats’ classic stripes this season, with a ‘zig-zag’ warp knit design, while the shirt offers increased comfort to players and fans through a flat knit rib turn-down collar.

The level of craft involved in the new Sunderland shirt is exemplified in the magnificent crest, which is embroidered directly onto the garment.The traditional black shorts are trimmed with red and, in a change to last season, the players will sport red socks with a white turn-over.
