        "text": "Messi & Ronaldo Hat-tricks\n\nAt the peak of their powers, it seemed like Messi and Ronaldo were scoring hat-tricks every other week. They've scored a mind-boggling 123 hat-tricks between them in their glittering careers.\n\nOf those, Messi has scored 57 hat-tricks and Ronaldo has scored 66 hat-tricks.\n\nHaving played considerably fewer games, Messi has scored hat-tricks with slightly more regularity over his career. Messi scores a hat-trick every 18.8 games on average, whereas Ronaldo scores a hat-trick for every 18.7 games played.\n\n4 or 5 Goals in a Game\n\nMessi has scored more than 3 goals in a game on 8 separate occasions, scoring 4 goals six times, and 5 goals twice.\n\nMessi 4 goals in a game\n\nMessi 5 goals in a game\n\nRonaldo has scored more than 3 in a game an impressive 11 times, scoring 4 goals in a game nine times and 5 goals twice.\n\nRonaldo 4 goals in a game\n\nRonaldo 5 goals in a game\n\nHow many of their hat-tricks include penalties?\n\nOf Messi's 57 career hat-tricks, 12 of them included penalties, meaning 21.1 % of all his hat-tricks included a penalty.\n\nRonaldo scored a penalty in 32 of his 66 career hat-tricks, meaning 48.5 % of his hat-tricks have included a penalty goal.\n\nUnique Hat-tricks\n\nCristiano Ronaldo has scored an unbelievable 10 \"perfect\" hat-tricks (a hat-trick consisting of 1 right foot goal, 1 left foot goal, and 1 headed goal), clearly demonstrating his superb weak foot and heading ability.\n\nWith Messi only scoring 27 headers in his whole career, it may come as no surprise that he hasn't got any perfect hat-tricks to his name.\n\nLeo Messi does however have a weak foot hat-trick to his name, scoring 3 right footed goals in a 2014 Champions League tie against APOEL. Messi has also scored a dead ball hat-trick, consisting of a penalty and 2 direct free kick goals against Celta Vigo in 2019.\n\nAlthough Ronaldo hasn't quite managed a weak foot hat-trick, an incredible 33 of his 66 hat-tricks ( 50.0 %) have included a weak foot goal. For Messi, it's 24 out of 57 ( 42.1 %).\n\nHow do they score their hat-tricks?\n\nHat-tricks WITH...Messi (%)Ronaldo (%)Weak Foot Goal24 ( 42.1 %)33 ( 50.0 %)Headed Goal3 ( 5.3 %)28 ( 42.4 %)Free Kick Goal8 ( 14.0 %)13 ( 19.7 %)Outside Box Goal (open play)13 ( 22.8 %)18 ( 27.3 %)\n\nHat-tricks WITHOUT...Messi (%)Ronaldo (%)Penalty Goal45 ( 78.9 %)34 ( 51.5 %)Extra Time Goal57 ( 100.0 %)61 ( 92.4 %)\n\nWhere do they score their hat-tricks?\n\n19 of Messi's 57 career hat-tricks have come away from home; 33.3 %. He's scored 36 hat-tricks at home and 2 in a neutral venue.\n\n63.2 % hat-tricks scored at home\n\n33.3 % hat-tricks scored away\n\n22 of Ronaldo's 66 career hat-tricks have been scored in away matches; 33.3 %. He's scored 40 hat-tricks in home games and 1 at a neutral venue.\n\n60.6 % hat-tricks scored at home\n\n33.3 % hat-tricks scored away\n\nNotable Messi Hat-tricks\n\nMessi began his hat-trick haul with a bang, netting his first ever treble in El Clasico against arch-rivals Real Madrid at 19 years of age. When a Guti free kick flicked in off Sergio Ramos' head, Real looked likely to secure a huge victory, but Messi's superb 91st minute strike ensure the game finished 3-3. Interestingly, this is the only match in which Messi has scored a hat-trick that his side hasn't won.\n\nAnother that sticks in the memory is Messi's hat-trick in World Cup qualifying against Ecuador. Argentina had endured a turbulent campaign and required a win in their final game - away to Ecuador - to ensure qualification for Russia 2018. Ecuador scored an early goal and Argentina feared the worst, but then, Messi happened. He struck twice inside the first half an hour to turn the game around and then sealed his hat-trick, along with World Cup qualification, in the second half.\n\nMessi has 8 hat-tricks in the Champions League, which is a record he and Ronaldo currently share. His two most memorable in the competition were against Arsenal and Bayer Leverkusen. Messi produced a simply stunning performance against Arsenal at Camp Nou in 2010, hitting 4 past the English side to mark his very first Champions League hat-trick.\n\nTwo years later, he somehow bettered this by scoring FIVE against Bayer Leverkusen in a Last 16 encounter, becoming the first player in history to score 5 in a Champions League fixture (since matched by Luiz Adriano).\n\nIn a 2019 La Liga fixture, Messi scored one of his more unique hat-tricks against Celta Vigo, when an early penalty followed by 2 free kicks either side of half-time secured a dead ball hat-trick.\n\nComplete List of Messi Hat-tricks\n\nNotable Ronaldo Hat-tricks\n\nRonaldo has scored an incredible 10 hat-tricks at international level, two of which particularly stand out.\n\nThe first was a crucial World Cup qualification play-off, in which Portugal took a 1-0 first-leg lead to Sweden. After Ronaldo's opener in the second-leg, Ibrahimovic gave Sweden a 2-1 lead as they threatened to turn the tie around. Then, Ronaldo struck twice in three minutes to secure his hat-trick, and qualification for the 2014 World Cup. His third strike also took him to 47 international goals, equalling Pauleta's all time record.\n\nThe second Portugal hat-trick that sticks out is of course his World Cup treble against Spain. With Spain largely the better side, Ronaldo salvaged an unlikely draw for Portugal as he fired in a late free-kick to level the match at 3-3. In terms of quality, it's perhaps generous to rank this among his best hat-tricks (one being a penalty and another a goalkeeping howler from De Gea), but on the world stage against one of the best teams in the world, and with the pressure weighing heavy on that late free-kick, it has to be considered one of his most memorable.\n\nIn 2016, Real Madrid were in real trouble after going down 2-0 to Wolfsburg in their Champions League quarter-final first-leg. But they needn't have worried. In the second-leg, Ronaldo wiped out their lead in the space of two first half minutes, before scoring a third in the 77th minute to secure Real's semi-final spot.\n\nA year later, he was back at it again. Bayern Munich had forced their quarter-final tie with Real Madrid into extra-time. Ronaldo then struck twice in extra-time to seal his hat-trick and Real's advancement in the competition.\n\nHe wasn't finished their though. In the following round he bacme the first player to score back-to-back hat-tricks in the Champions League knockout stage, putting 3 past fierce rivals Atletico Madrid.\n\nTwo years later, Ronaldo reinforced his reputation once again for rescuing his sides in the Champions League. This time he was in Juventus colours, with his side 2-0 down after a Last 16 first-leg against Atletico Madrid. In the second-leg... you can guess what happened. Ronaldo netted 2 headers and a penalty to completely turn the tie around, scoring his first Juventus hat-trick in the process. It was also his eighth hat-trick in the Champions League, equalling Messi's competition record.\n\nComplete List of Ronaldo Hat-tricks"
