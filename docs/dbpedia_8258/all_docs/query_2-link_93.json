        "text": "Both Liverpool and Arsenal are no stranger to being slammed for a host of woeful and under-performing players over the years, particularly throughout both sides' contrasting experiences during the last decade.\n\nThe two Premier League giants will lock horns at Anfield on Wednesday in their Carabao Cup fourth round clash, with Jurgen Klopp's men flying high at the top of the division and their London opponents firmly in the midst of an identity crisis.\n\nA showdown in the same competition in 2009 had introduced a different crop of established and up-and-coming players vying for first-team spots on both sides. However, time conspired to be cruel to several of the 22 starters handed the chance to impress.\n\nHere, Sportsmail takes a look at the two teams fielded that night, which arguably remain the worst ever cobbled together by the top flight big-hitters.\n\nARSENAL\n\nLukasz Fabianski\n\nThe club's former Polish shot stopper now plays for West Ham, and had joined Arsenal in 2007. Despite Wenger believing Fabianski could become one of the best goalkeepers in the top flight, the now 34-year-old received heavy criticism for conceding soft goals far too regularly at the highest level.\n\nHowever, his form picked up for the club in later seasons, and Fabianski departed for Swansea on a high after lifting the FA Cup in 2014.\n\nPhilippe Senderos\n\nCurrently plying his trade for Swiss outfit FC Chiasso, Senderos made 116 appearances for Arsenal across a seven season spell.\n\nHe had also won the FA Cup with the North London side before moving on to Fulham and Aston Villa among others. But after reportedly snubbing Real Madrid, Senderos was plagued by injuries during his first season in England, and barely featured throughout Arsenal's 'Invincibles' campaign in 2004.\n\nMikael Silvestre\n\nSilvestre had been handed almost 250 Premier League appearances by Manchester United before moving to Arsenal in 2008, and also rejected an offer from City manager Mark Hughes.\n\nThe former French international lasted just two seasons with the Gunners, but featured in the club's Champions League semi-final defeat to former side United across two legs. Silvestre later represented Werder Bremen and Portland Timbers.\n\nKieran Gibbs\n\nFull back Gibbs had sported Arsenal's jersey for 10 years before joining current side West Brom in 2017.\n\nDespite the 30-year-old playing for the Gunners since the age of 14, he was lambasted by Roy Keane in the latter stages of his spell in London after being handed the captain's armband against Bayern Munich. 'If he's the guy who's going to bring everyone together, you're in huge trouble', Keane said.\n\nCraig Eastmond\n\nEastmond is now a semi-professional footballer with Sutton United, but made 10 appearances for Arsenal during his four years at the club.\n\nDuring the 2010-11 campaign, the former Gunners full back had been awarded his Champions League debut at Shakhtar Donetsk, but scored an own goal in the first half and was hooked shortly after the interval.\n\nKerrea Gilbert\n\nThe 32-year-old's last spell came in 2014 with St Albans City, but he departed after just one season following the non-league side's promotion to Conference South. Gilbert was drafted into Arsenal's first-team in 2005 following numerous injuries and made his maiden appearance in the Champions League against Ajax.\n\nFollowing an injury picked up against West Ham, Gilbert was shipped out on loan several times and failed to feature for the Gunners again.\n\nSamir Nasri\n\nNasri currently plays for Anderlecht and had rapidly established himself as a key performer at Arsenal across his four years at the Emirates.\n\nThe Frenchman scored 27 goals in 125 appearances in the capital, eventually moving to Manchester City for a reported Â£25million in 2011. The winger also featured for West Ham in the Premier League during the 2018/19 season.\n\nAaron Ramsey\n\nThe Welsh international joined Juventus on a free transfer in the summer after current boss Unai Emery's questionable decision to allow him to leave.\n\nAfter moving to Arsenal from Cardiff City, and rejecting Manchester United, Ramsey suffered a horror leg break against Stoke in 2010 before recovering and becoming one of the club's key performers and a firm fan favourite. He was twice voted Arsenal's player of the season by supporters.\n\nFran Merida\n\nMerida had penned professional terms with the Gunners after his 17th birthday and made his competitive debut for the club in September 2007. He was labelled an 'absolutely amazing player' by Wenger, and scored against Liverpool in the 2-1 Carling Cup victory.\n\nBut after snubbing a contract offer to remain at the club, much to the anger of the manager, Merida joined Atletico Madrid on a free transfer and now plays for fellow La Liga side Osasuna.\n\nEduardo\n\nEduardo had impressed for the Gunners since arriving in August 2007, and regularly featured in the club's domestic trophy bids. Following an injury to Robin van Persie, Eduardo was then chosen to partner Emmanuel Adebayor but sustained his own setback after breaking his leg against Birmingham a year later.\n\nThe 36-year-old later joined Legia Warsaw in 2018 as a free agent following spells with Shakhtar Donetsk and Flamengo.\n\nNicklas Bendtner\n\nEnigmatic Copenhagen front man Bendtner had scored his first Premier League goal against arch-rivals Tottenham in December 2007, just 1.8 seconds after being introduced as a substitute.\n\nBut as the seasons progressed, the Dane struggled for first-team action and publicly announcing his desire to leave. He spent loan spells with Sunderland and Juventus before signing permanently for Wolfsburg.\n\nLIVERPOOL\n\nDiego Cavalieri\n\nBrazilian shot stopper Cavalieri had signed a four-year deal with Liverpool in July 2008 for a reported fee of Â£3million.\n\nBut after struggling to displace Pepe Reina as first-choice goalkeeper and failing to make a Premier League appearance, Roy Hodgson allowed the now 36-year-old to join Cesena.\n\nSotirios Kyrgiakos\n\nKyrgiakos is now retired but had represented the current table toppers for two seasons.\n\nHis first campaign in England saw the Greek centre half earn plaudits for a string of impressive performances, and the following season he was even used as an auxiliary striker when the Reds were desperate for a goal. The now 40-year-old joined Wolfsburg in 2011 after making 49 appearances for Liverpool.\n\nEmiliano Insua\n\nThe Argentine full back's maiden goal for the club arrived against Arsenal during the two sides' Carling Cup clash in 2009, after Insua had broken into the first-team set-up following Fabio Aurelio's injury.\n\nHe later joined Galatasaray on loan before returning to Anfield, but was unable to secure regular match action. Following several spells across Europe, Insua settled with Bundesliga outfit Stuttgart.\n\nPhilipp Degen\n\nDegen joined Liverpool on a free transfer in 2008, but suffered a setback in the first few months of his Anfield career. A broken metatarsal sustained by a challenge from Tottenham's Gareth Bale reduced the versatile Swiss to tears in the dressing room.\n\nInjuries continued to plague Degen during the rest of his time with the Reds, and he departed by mutual consent in 2010 after a meeting with Hodgson. The 36-year-old retired in 2016.\n\nMartin Skrtel\n\nSkrtel was just one of a handful of Liverpool's starters who went on to become a faithful servant at Anfield. The Slovak spent eight years with the reigning European champions after joining in 2008, and was even compared to Jamie Carragher by Rafa Benitez.\n\nHe featured in every minute of Liverpool's Premier League campaign in 2010-11, and was handed the club's Player of the Year award in 2012. Skrtel later moved to Fenerbahce, and now plays for Istanbul Basaksehir.\n\nJay Spearing\n\nCurrent Blackpool club captain Spearing started his career at Anfield as a youth-team player in 1997, and remained with Liverpool for 16 years before leaving for Bolton.\n\nHe made 55 appearances overall for the club, and spent time on loan with Leicester and Bolton after struggling to regularly break into Liverpool's midfield ranks.\n\nDamien Plessis\n\nThe French midfielder joined Liverpool on the last day of the summer transfer window in 2007, and originally featured for the club's reserve team.\n\nBut despite his initial promise, Plessis was unable to make the desired impact and was farmed out on loan to several sides before moving to Panathinaikos.\n\nAndriy Voronin\n\nLiverpool snapped up Voronin on a free transfer and he penned a four-year deal. But after an initial flurry of goals, the Ukrainian injured his ankle in training and underwent surgery.\n\nHis setback reduced his opportunities in the top flight, which fuelled rumours that Benitez could sell him in order to raise funds. Voronin later spent one season on loan with Hertha Berlin before permanently signing for Dinamo Moscow.\n\nDirk Kuyt\n\nKuyt moved to Liverpool from Feyenoord in 2006 after impressing in his home nation, and scored 14 goals across all competitions in his debut season in England. A memorable, but ultimately conciliatory, strike came in the Champions League final against AC Milan.\n\nHis first Premier League hat-trick came against rivals Manchester United at Anfield, and Kuyt also contributed to Liverpool's League Cup final triumph in 2012 after netting in normal time and then from 12 yards in the penalty shootout. He later rejoined Feyenoord before retiring in 2016.\n\nRyan Babel\n\nLiverpool great Kenny Dalglish lauded Babel's ability to terrorise top flight defenders with his trickery in possession, and the Dutchman responded to the praise by netting the winner against Manchester United in September 2008.\n\nBut after 22 goals in 146 appearances for the Reds, Babel was later moved on to Hoffenheim - despite Dalglish claiming just the day before that the Dutchman would remain at Anfield. The 32-year-old returned to the Premier League with Fulham in 2019, but moved on following the London side's eventual relegation.\n\nDavid N'Gog\n\nFrench striker N'Gog currently plays for Budapest Honved in Hungary, following several stop-start seasons since leaving Liverpool in 2011. Benitez had hailed the work of the club's scouting network after N'Gog was secured, and bagged against Manchester United in a 2-0 victory in October 2009.\n\nHe departed Anfield with a record of 19 goals in 94 games, and joined Bolton for a reported Â£4million fee. He had also briefly plied his trade with Ross County after joining the Scottish side in January 2018.\n\nDespite Arsenal's narrow victory at the Emirates, the Gunners were knocked out by Manchester City in the next round after a 3-0 defeat. Goals from Carlos Tevez, Shaun Wright-Phillips and Vladimir Weiss condemned the London side to a fifth round knockout, with Manchester United eventually winning the tournament.\n\nWenger's men would record a third-place finish in the Premier League and reached the Champions League quarter-finals before being eliminated by Barcelona.\n\nTheir Merseyside opponents finished in seventh spot domestically and were demoted to the Europa League after finishing third in the group, where they lost to Atletico Madrid in the semi-finals.\n\nA week after the end of the top flight season, Benitez's contract was terminated by mutual consent."
