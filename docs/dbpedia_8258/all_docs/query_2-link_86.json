        "text": "Arsenal face a struggle to finish top of their Champions League group after they were held to a draw by Paris St-Germain at Emirates Stadium.\n\nThe Gunners were seeking the win that would put them in pole position in Group A after years of finishing second and six consecutive eliminations in the last 16 in the knockout phase.\n\nAnd it looked like Arsenal were on their way despite going behind early on to Edinson Cavani's sliding finish from Blaise Matuidi's cross.\n\nOlivier Giroud scored from a penalty just before half-time after Grzegorz Krychowiak fouled Alexis Sanchez. And Arsenal were ahead on the hour when a penalty-box rebound struck Marco Verratti and flew in.\n\nPSG were always dangerous and Lucas' header, which took a touch off Alex Iwobi, gave them a fully-deserved equaliser 13 minutes from time.\n\nCavani then missed two good chances and although Arsenal and PSG are level on points, the French champions have the advantage on head-to-head away goals with one round of games left after a 1-1 draw between the teams in Paris earlier in the group.\n\nCavani has forged a reputation as one of the world's most formidable strikers - and he was on target here again when he slid in to turn home Matuidi's cross to put PSG ahead after 18 minutes.\n\nThe Uruguayan's runs into space are magical but he could have made Arsenal's plight much worse with two glaring second half misses, one when he broke clear and went for a Hollywood chipped finish that David Ospina saved, and a point-blank header he directed wide from Lucas' cross.\n\nCavani has the record of a quality player - but he let Arsenal off the hook."
