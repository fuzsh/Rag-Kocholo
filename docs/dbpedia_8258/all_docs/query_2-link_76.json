Thanks for your company, goodnight.\n\nShare\n\nThese are the 12 teams who have already qualified for the knockout stage (those in bold could potentially draw Arsenal)\n\nArsenal\n\nAtletico Madrid\n\nBarcelona\n\nBayern Munich\n\nBorussia Dortmund\n\nInternazionale\n\nLazio\n\nManchester City\n\nPSV Eindhoven\n\nReal Madrid\n\nReal Sociedad\n\nRB Leipzig\n\nThe last four teams will be\n\nCopenhagen, Galatasaray or Man Utd\n\nNapoli or Braga\n\nPSG, Newcastle or AC Milan\n\nPorto or Shakhtar Donetsk\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 23.03 CET\n\nFull time: Arsenal 6-0 Lens\n\nPeep peep! Arsenal will play a Champions League knockout tie for the first time in seven years after walloping Lens at the Emirates Stadium. The result means they will also top their group and avoid Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Real Madrid in the last 16.\n\nThe front five all scored before half-time, with the slippery Gabriel Jesus giving Lens a torrid time, and Jorginho added a late penalty. All told, it was a perfect night for Mikel Arteta.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 23.03 CET\n\n90+1 min Gabriel makes an excellent tackle to deny Wahi a consolation tackle, then clenches his fists and growls with delight at the home supporters.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.52 CET\n\n89 min Arsenal are one of 12 teams to qualify for the knockout stages with a match to spare. Not sure what the moral of this story is.\n\nShare\n\nGOAL! Arsenal 6-0 Lens (Jorginho 86 pen)\n\nJorginho may have missed 422 penalties in a row for his country, but he knows how to score them for Arsenal. He does a little hop, sits Samba down and slides the ball into the other corner.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.58 CET\n\n86 min No second yellow for Khusanov, which is nice to see.\n\nShare\n\n86 min: Penalty to Arsenal! In fact, Khusanov stiff-armed Martinelli and then handled the ball to boot. A penalty, and probably a red card.\n\nShare\n\n85 min The substitute Khusanov catches Martinelli with a stiff arm in the face. There’s a VAR check for a penalty, and the referee is going to the monitor. Khusanov has already been booked so he’ll be off if it’s given.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.46 CET\n\n83 min: Arsenal substitution Eddie Nketiah replaces Gabriel Jesus, who was far too hot for Lens to handle in the first half.\n\nShare\n\n82 min Odegaard’s inswinging corner is headed over at the near post by White. That was a pretty good chance.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.48 CET\n\n81 min Arsenal work the ball beautifully to release White on the right. He feeds it into Martinelli, who tries to put Nelson clear with a reverse pass. It hits a defender and goes behind for a corner.\n\nShare\n\n79 min Even at 5-0, Odegaard upbraids the assistant referee after being penalised for putting hands on Haidara. He’s been closer to his best tonight, particularly without the ball. And his volley for the fifth goal was a gem.\n\nShare\n\n76 min: Lens substitution David Pereira Da Costa comes on for Nampalys Mendy.\n\nShare\n\n75 min: Arsenal substitution Jorginho replaces Declan Rice, who padlocked the back door as usual. He’s fantastic.\n\nShare\n\n74 min Odegaard combines with Nelson and pings a shot that deflects behind. Rice’s corner comes to nothing.\n\nShare\n\n73 min Arsenal’s next three games are Wolves (H) and Luton (A). Then things get really interesting: Aston Villa (A), PSV (A, dead rubber), Brighton (H, bogey team), Liverpool (A).\n\nShare\n\n70 min A corner is half cleared to White, 30 yards out. Goalkick to Lens.\n\nShare\n\n69 min It’s been a good night for Kai Havertz, who has produced his best performance for Arsenal as a left-sided No8.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.46 CET\n\n67 min Havertz gives the Emirates a knee-trembler with a lovely flick near the byline on the left. He gets into the area and cuts the ball back sharply to Odegaard, whose deflected shot is well saved to his left by Samba. The ball runs loose but Jesus is penalised, perhaps harshly, for his heavy-handed attempt to gobble up the rebound.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.54 CET\n\n66 min: Arsenal substitution Reiss Nelson replaces Bukayo Saka, who scored the third goal and survived the usual assaults on his calves.\n\nShare\n\n64 min Now Haidara is booked for wiping out Odegaard.\n\nShare\n\n63 min: Lens substitution The teenager Abdukodir Khusanov replaces Jonathan Gradit – and gets booked within 20 seconds.\n\nShare\n\n61 min Okay, it’s starting to peter out now. Goal difference is an irrelevance so there’s nothing much to play for. Lens are going out, Arsenal and PSV Eindhoven are going through to the last 16. But Lens will qualify for the Europa League if they draw at home to Sevilla in their last group game.\n\nShare\n\n58 min Arsenal’s pressing has been very good tonight, particularly from Jesus, Havertz, Odegaard and Rice. A fit, in-form Gabriel Jesus really elevates this team.\n\nShare\n\n56 min Given the scoreline, both teams are playing with impressive speed and purpose. The second half may eventually become a non-event but that hasn’t happened yet.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.35 CET\n\n53 min Lens have had more of the ball tonight, 53 per cent to Arsenal’s 47. Much of that was between the fourth and fifth goals, when Arsenal took a round off, but it’s still an interesting statistic given, you know, the 5-0 scoreline.\n\nShare\n\n51 min The intensity of Lens’ performance since half-time suggests they don’t concur with Marsellus Wallace’s views on pride. That’s all they have to play for tonight.\n\nShare\n\n49 min Jude Bellingham’s scored again.\n\nShare\n\n48 min The camera cuts to the Lens bench, where the coaching staff are giving a masterclass in the body language of the folded arms.\n\nShare\n\n47 min Arsenal’s biggest victory in Europe is 7-0: away to Standard Liege in 1993 (just after four consecutive 0-0 draws in the Premier League, and we all know which gave George Graham more pleasure) and at home to Slavia Prague in 2007.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.09 CET\n\n46 min Peep peep! Lens begin the most futile 45 minutes of their season.\n\nShare\n\nHalf-time substitutions galore\n\nArsenal Ben White and Jakub Kiwior for Takehiro Tomiyasu and Oleksandr Zinchenko.\n\nLens Deiver Machado, Adrien Thomasson and Neil El Ayanoui for Florian Sotoca, Facundo Medina and Salis Abdul Samed.\n\nShare\n\nA question When were Arsenal serious contenders to win the Champions League? 2008-09? 2010-11? Easy to forget how much of a scare they gave an awesome Barcelona that year.\n\nShare\n\nHalf-time reading\n\nHere’s our Champions League roundup, which includes the other five-goal game in this group.\n\nAnd here’s how the Group B table will look at full-time.\n\nArsenal P5 Pts12\n\nPSV P5 Pts8\n\nLens P5 Pts5\n\nSevilla P5 Pts 2\n\nShare\n\nHalf time: Arsenal 5-0 Lens\n\nArsenal are swaggering into the last 16 of the Champions League as group winners. They blew Lens away with four goals in 15 exhilarating, so last season minutes, then added a fifth on the stroke of half-time.\n\nThere were five different goalscorers and, crucially, all five needed a goal: Kai Havertz, Gabriel Jesus, Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli and Martin Odegaard will all feel a whole lot better about life as they stroll down the tunnel for their Gatorade chasers.\n\nShare\n\nSaka led a counter-attack, running 60 yards while waiting for support. He came infield to work the angle for a reverse pass to release Tomiyasu, who stood up a fine cross to the far post. Odegaard watched it onto his left foot and battered a volley past Samba. Lovely stuff.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.03 CET\n\nGOAL! Arsenal 5-0 Lens (Odegaard 45+1)\n\nA gem of a team goal on the stroke of half-time.\n\nShare\n\n45 min Saka plays in the underlapping Martinelli, who indulgently crashes a shot into the side netting. A low cross would have given Gabriel Jesus an open goal.\n\nShare\n\n44 min Fuchini shoots straight at Raya from 20 yards. Arsenal are hanging on their 4-0 lead here.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 21.45 CET\n\n43 min Wahi roasts Saliba down the left and flashes another ball across the face. It’s hard to know whether Arsenal have stopped playing, Lens have started, or both. Whatever the reason, Lens have been well on top since going, er, 4-0 down.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.13 CET\n\n42 min Mendy is booked for a foul on Jesus.\n\nShare\n\n41 min: Medina hits the post! If only Lens had started like this. Medina pings a sweet left-footed shot from 25 yards that veers away from Raya and thumps off the post. The ball rebounds to Wahi, who is offside, but the original shot would have counted. I think.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 21.43 CET\n\n40 min I did Raya a disservice. He punched the ball first and then followed through to flatten ‘player’ with a stiff right.\n\nUpdate: ‘player’ is Facundo Medina.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 21.46 CET\n\n39 min Lens are having a good and entirely futile spell. Raya comes for Fulgini’s free-kick, misses and seems to punch somebody in the face. Play continues and the aforementioned, not easily identificable ‘player’ gets to his feet.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 21.42 CET\n\n37 min Wahi runs onto a through ball in the inside-left channel and whacks a cross shot from a very tight angle that flashes across the face. At first I thought Raya got a touch but the reaction of the players – and the graphic saying Lens have had no shots on target – would suggest otherwise.\n\nShare\n\n36 min: No penalty! The referee signals that it ricocheted off Havertz’s leg onto his arm. Imagine how many remotes have just been flung across living rooms in the vicinity of St James’ Park.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 21.40 CET\n\n35 min: VAR check Lens appeal for a penalty when a free-kick hits the outstretched arm of Havertz. I think this will be given.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 21.37 CET\n\n33 min The two attacking Gabriels, Martinelli and Jesus, look particularly sharp tonight. They’ve only scored one Premier League goal apiece this season, but a first half like this should do so much for their confidence.\n\nShare"
