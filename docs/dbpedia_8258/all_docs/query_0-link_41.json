The Foxes added a second to their haul in 1997 when they bested Middlesbrough in the final courtesy of a Steve Claridge extra-time winner.\n\nThe Blues needed only three years to collect their third cup, beating out Tranmere Rovers 2-1 in the final, with Mathew Elliot the hero on the day with both of Leicester's goals.\n\nRegister you interest in Leicester City hospitality\n\n7.

However, it's impossible to forget their illustrious past, which includes an impressive tally of 10 major honours—all achieved before the turn of the millennium.\n\nWithin this esteemed collection of trophies, Nottingham Forest proudly boasts four Carabao Cup wins. The first triumph occurred in 1978 when they secured a memorable victory over Liverpool, courtesy of a decisive penalty from John Robertson.\n\nThe following year, in 1979, the Reds clinched their second Carabao Cup with a thrilling 3-2 win against Southampton, thanks to two goals from Gary Birtles and a winning strike by Anthony Woodcock.\n\nNottingham Forest's run of success didn't end there.
