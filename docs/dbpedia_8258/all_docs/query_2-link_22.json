        "text": "Mikel Arteta faces a challenge to achieve something as Arsenal boss that he never managed to do as a player tonight and get past the Champions League round of 16.\n\nThe Gunners hold the English record for most successive appearances in UEFA's top competition but infamously have never won it.\n\nBetween 1998/99 and 2016/17, Arsenal qualified for the Champions League for nineteen seasons, a feat in Europe only bettered by 14-time winners Real Madrid.\n\nHowever, that run only yielded a sole appearance in a final, with the majority of Arsenal's campaigns ending at the round of 16 stage.\n\n2017 was the last year Arsenal found themselves in the Champions League knockout rounds which also proved to be their seventh straight exit in the last-16.\n\nThe group stages initially proved to be the Gunners' undoing once they returned to the competition following its rebrand in the 1990s.\n\nFrom 1998/99 to 2002/03, the north Londoners failed to reach the knockout stages in four out of five years.\n\nThe outlier proved to be a quarter-finals exit on away goals to Valencia in 2001, the same stage the Invincibles came unstuck to Chelsea three years later.\n\nIn 2005, Arsenal suffered their first last-16 exit, losing 3-2 on aggregate to future foes Bayern Munich.\n\nArsene Wenger's men responded the following season with a storming run to the final before that defeat to Barcelona in France.\n\nDefeats to PSV, Liverpool, Manchester United and Barcelona again ensured Arsenal failed to reach the competition's finale again.\n\nBut following their quarter-finals exit to Barca in 2010, the club's round of 16 curse really started.\n\nArsenal looked to have finally secured revenge on the Catalans when they beat them 2-1 in the first leg of their 2011 last 16 showdown.\n\nA Lionel Messi-inspired performance featuring a controversial Robin van Persie red at the Nou Camp quickly snuffed out their dreams.\n\n2012 saw Arsenal fail to recover from a 4-0 hammering to AC Milan despite managing to score three unanswered goals in the return leg.\n\nTwo of the next three years saw agonising away goals exits to Bayern Munich and Monaco, with the Bavarians also adding another last-16 defeat for good measure.\n\nWengerâ€™s final two Champions League campaigns proved to be a different story altogether.\n\nMessi again returned to wreak havoc on Arsenal in a 5-1 aggregate victory in 2016, before Bayern poured salt on the open wounds.\n\nA 10-2 win across both legs was Arsenal's last showing in the Champions League, with Wenger finishing fifth in the Premier League.\n\nThus relinquishing the last arrow his fans had, consistent qualification to UEFA's top table.\n\nHis protege Arteta, who featured in many of those humbling eliminations, now has the chance to rewrite Arsenal's history."
