        "text": "The Emirates Cup was first staged in 2007 at the end of our first season at the stadium, and this year’s competition is the 13th edition in its various guises.\n\nThe first nine editions were contested between four teams in a group basis, with each team playing two matches, while the 2019 edition featured two men’s and two women’s sides in separate tournaments, before reverting to a one-off game.\n\nAs we aim to win the honour for the eighth time, here’s some of the highlights from previous tournaments.\n\n2007\n\nWinner: Arsenal\n\nAlso competing: Paris Saint-Germain, Valencia, Inter Milan\n\nJaime Gavilan scored the first-ever goal in Emirates Cup history, as Valencia saw off Inter Milan 2-0 in the opening match, and later that day we beat Paris Saint-Germain thanks to goals from Mathieu Flamini and Nicklas Bendtner.\n\nPSG recovered with a 3-0 win over Valencia but Arsène Wenger’s men took the inaugural trophy thanks to a 2-1 comeback win over Inter. Alex Hleb equalised before Robin van Persie’s late winner.\n\n2008\n\nWinner: Hamburg\n\nAlso competing: Arsenal, Juventus, Real Madrid\n\nHamburg became the first visiting side to win the trophy despite losing the first game to Real Madrid. We also lost our opener, 1-0 to a David Trezeguet goal for Juventus.\n\nWe bounced back with a 1-0 win over Real Madrid – the soon-to-be-departed Emmanuel Adebayor on target – but it wasn’t enough, as the rule of each goal being worth an extra point gave Hamburg the title, with every team having one win and one defeat each.\n\n2009\n\nWinner: Arsenal\n\nAlso competing: Rangers, Atletico Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain\n\nWe regained the trophy in 2009 – a tournament memorable mainly for the emergence of Jack Wilshere. Andrey Arshavin scored twice in the last four minutes of the first game – a 2-1 win over Atletico Madrid – before we beat Rangers 3-0 to confirm top spot.\n\nWilshere, who had already impressed against Atletico – scored twice, either side of an Eduardo goal. Afterwards, Wenger said of Wilshere: \"When he starts to go past people in the final 20 yards you can always say there is something special.”\n\n2010\n\nWinner: Arsenal\n\nAlso competing: Lyon, Celtic, Milan\n\nMarouane Chamakh scored on his home debut as we kicked off with a 1-1 draw at home to Milan, before securing the trophy with 3-2 win over Celtic.\n\nWilshere, now aged 18, was once again one of the star performers, with Carlos Vela, Bacary Sagna and Samir Nasri all on target. Lyon, featuring Alexandre Lacazette in their side, finished second after two draws.\n\n2011\n\nWinner: New York Red Bulls\n\nAlso competing: Paris Saint-Germain, Arsenal, Boca Juniors\n\nThierry Henry returned to the Emirates with New York Red Bulls, and helped his side top the group, thanks to a late own goal by Kyle Bartley in the final game of the weekend.\n\nAfter sitting out the first game, he started against the Gunners on the Sunday, and after Robin van Persie had put us ahead, the visitors’ late goal denied us the trophy. In the first Emirates Cup to feature non-European teams, we had squandered a two-goal lead in our first game against Boca Juniors.\n\n2013\n\nWinner: Galatasaray\n\nAlso competing: Porto, Arsenal, Napoli\n\nA pair of late Didier Drogba goals gave Galatasaray the Emirates Cup at our expense in the 2013 edition. There was no tournament in 2012 due to the Olympics, and we returned with a 2-2 draw over Napoli in the first game. Olivier Giroud and Laurent Koscielny scored after we trailed 2-0 at half-time.\n\nA Theo Walcott goal on the Sunday against Galatasaray looked to have wrapped up the silverware, only for Drogba’s two goals in the last 12 minutes to swing it into the Turks’ favour.\n\n2014\n\nWinner: Valencia\n\nAlso competing: Arsenal, Monaco, Benfica\n\nYaya Sanogo stole the show on the Saturday, netting four goals in a 5-1 win over Benfica. The French striker completed a first-half hat-trick, with Joel Campbell also getting in on the act.\n\nDespite the thumping win though, it wasn’t enough to secure the title, with Monaco clinching a 1-0 win over us the following day, and Valencia taking the title with a 3-1 victory over Benfica.\n\n2015\n\nWinner: Arsenal\n\nAlso competing: Villarreal, Wolfsburg, Lyon\n\nWe lifted the trophy for the first time in five years, thanks mainly to a 6-0 win over Lyon on the opening day. We had six different goalscorers, including Alex Iwobi, who would go on to enjoy a breakthrough season.\n\nWalcott became our seventh scorer of the weekend when he netted the only goal against Wolfsburg to wrap up the title, when Petr Cech made his home debut, keeping a clean sheet.\n\n2017\n\nWinner: Arsenal\n\nAlso competing: Sevilla, RB Leipzig, Benfica\n\nDue to pitch reconstruction work in 2016, the next tournament was held a year later, with Sevilla making their first Emirates Cup appearance. The Spanish outfit won both games, but we edged them to take the trophy on the goals-scored rule, mainly thanks to a 5-2 win over Benfica on the first day.\n\nSevilla beat us 2-1 on the Sunday, but Lacazette’s strike was enough to secure a third consecutive trophy.\n\n2019\n\nMen’s winner: Lyon\n\nWomen’s winner: Bayern Munich\n\nAfter another one-year hiatus, the Emirates Cup returned with a new format in 2019. Arsenal Women took on Bayern Munich in the opening game, with the Germans triumphing thanks to a Malanie Leupolz goal in the first half. It was followed later that afternoon by our men's side against Lyon - managed by former Gunner Sylvinho.\n\nUnai Emery saw his team go ahead through Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang after 35 minutes, but two Moussa Dembele goals turned things around.\n\n2022\n\nMen's winner: Arsenal\n\nFollowing a two-year gap due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Gabriel Jesus stole the show in this one-off Emirates Cup match, as we thrashed Sevilla 6-0 to prepare for the new season in style. The Brazilian striker marked his first appearance in our colours at our home by netting twice in the first 15 minutes, while a Bukayo Saka brace put us four goals ahead after just 20 minutes.\n\nJesus grabbed the matchball on 77 minutes, before Eddie Nketiah completed the rout two minutes from time to put the cap on a huge win.\n\n2023\n\nMen's winner: Arsenal\n\nIn another one-off match, Arsene Wenger was the guest of honour as two of his former clubs went head to head, and French international Youssouf Fofana opened the scoring just after the half-hour mark. However Eddie Nketiah managed to restore parity just before the break when he converted a Gabriel Martinelli corner.\n\nAnother 45 minutes failed to separate the sides, meaning a shootout was required to decide the destiny of the trophy and we managed to convert all five of our efforts, with Aaron Ramsdale saving from Takumi Minamino to ensure we lifted the trophy for the seventh time."
