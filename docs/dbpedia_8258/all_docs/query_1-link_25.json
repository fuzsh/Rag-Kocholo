        "text": "The English Premier League stands out as one of the most competitive and entertaining football leagues globally, currently rivalled only by Spain's La Liga in terms of viewing figures and collection of star players. But it is not only the Premier League which is so successful. The Championship, England's second tier division, retains a huge following every year, with a remarkable average attendance of around 20,000–22,000. As we travel through these divisions, we find a huge amount of London-based clubs. In fact, London has the most football clubs of any city in the world.\n\nSo, we've decided to take on the challenge of rankings those clubs, in order of size, considering the following ranking factors:\n\nachievements/trophies won,\n\nstadium attendance,\n\nlongevity and\n\nsize of global fanbase.\n\n1. Arsenal FC (Premier League)\n\nAchievements: 46 Premiership Titles, 14 FA Cup Titles, 2 League Cups, 17 FA Community Shields.\n\nNotable: Holds the record for the longest uninterrupted period in the English top flight and the only side to complete a Premier League season unbeaten (2004).\n\nHome: Emirates Stadium (Capacity: 60,000).\n\nArsenal has amassed an impressive total of 46 domestic cups throughout its existence, solidifying its place as the top football club in London.\n\nThe team holds a remarkable record for the lengthiest uninterrupted period in the English top flight and stands alone as the only side to have completed a Premier League season undefeated (2004).\n\nTheir impressive home, the Emirates Stadium, accommodates approximately 60,000 fans. It is the 3rd largest club stadium in London, recently overtaken by the Olympic Stadium and Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Arsenal's global fan base is vast, with estimates ranging from 80 million to over 100 million fans worldwide.\n\nArsenal have built a reputation for playing beautiful football at the highest level. Trophies have been harder to come by in recent years, but this club remains London's biggest.\n\n2. Chelsea FC (Premier League)\n\nAchievements: 6 English titles, 8 FA Cups, 5 League Cups.\n\nEuropean Triumphs: UEFA Champions League (2012, 2021), UEFA Cup (2013, 2019), UEFA Cup Winners' Cup (1971, 1998), Super Cup (1998).\n\nHome: Stamford Bridge (Capacity: 42,000)\n\nChelsea, situated in Fulham, London, has predominantly occupied a position in the upper tiers of English football. The club has clinched the English title six times, the FA Cup eight times, and the League Cup five times. Their most successful period has been in the last 20 years since the takeover of Roman Abramovich and the cash influx which followed. They have been England's most successful club in Europe in the last 10 years.\n\nStamford Bridge serves as the Blues' home ground, overseen by the affluent Russian billionaire owner, Roman Abramovich. In the 2010–11 season, Chelsea maintained an average attendance of 41,435, ranking sixth in the Premier League.\n\n3. Tottenham Hotspur (Premier League)\n\nAchievements: Two top-tier English titles (1951, 1961), eight FA Cup titles, four League Cups.\n\nEuropean Success: UEFA Cup winners in 1972 and 1984.\n\nHome: Tottenham Hotspur Stadium (Capacity: 63,000).\n\nTottenham Hotspur, or Spurs, boasts a rich history marked by several significant achievements.

In European competitions, Spurs secured the UEFA Cup in 1972 and the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1963.\n\nTheir recent success has been solely in the League Cup, which they've won a total of four times, they also reached the UEFA Champions League final in the 2018-2019 season but failed to bring the trophy home.\n\n4. West Ham United (Premier League)\n\nAchievements: FA Cup winners three times (1964, 1975, 1980), UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1965.\n\nHighest Premiership Finish: 5th in 1998-99.\n\nHome: Olympic Stadium (Capacity: 62,500).\n\nFourth in the list is West Ham United, colloquially known as the Hammers. They have a storied history marked by significant achievements and have established themselves as a consistent competitor in the English top flight, more so than clubs ranked below. The club's most notable success came in the 1965-1966 season when they won the FA Cup, memorably defeating West German champions 1860 Munich in the final. They have also claimed victory in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1965.\n\nWhile West Ham has not secured top-flight league titles, they have consistently been a competitive force in English football and have produced some of England's finest talents, including many of the World Cup winning team in 1966. The club has experienced various highs, including a fifth-place finish in the Premier League in the 1998-1999 season. Their biggest recent success came in the European Conference League, taking the trophy home in 2023.\n\n5. Fulham FC (Premier League)\n\nNotable: Oldest London team, 11th straight year in the top flight.\n\nRecent Performance: Finished eighth in the last season, reached the Europa League final in 2010.\n\nHome: Craven Cottage (Capacity: 26,000).\n\nFulham Football Club, known as the Cottagers, has yo-yo'd between the Premier League and Championship in recent years. But the club has had many great moments, including reaching the UEFA Europa League final in 2010. Despite being runners-up, it was a remarkable cup run.\n\nDomestically, Fulham's most memorable achievement is reaching the FA Cup final in 1975, where they lost to West Ham United. In the 1999-2000 season, Fulham secured promotion to the Premier League, initiating a period of consistent top-flight football.\n\nThough Fulham hasn't clinched major silverware, the club's resilience and contributions to English football have earned them a respected place in the sport's history, and ranked 5th in our London list.\n\n6. Crystal Palace FC (Championship)\n\nAchievements: Division 2 winners (1979)\n\nNotable: Spent 13 years in the top tier, 34 in the second, and 31 in the third tier.\n\nRivalries: Millwall and Charlton.\n\nHome: Selhurst Park (Capacity: 25,000).\n\nNext up is Crystal Palace, a.k.a the Eagles, has a history punctuated by memorable moments and notable achievements. The club's most significant accomplishment is reaching the FA Cup final in the 1989-1990 season, where they narrowly lost to Manchester United in a replay after a thrilling 3-3 draw.\n\nIn league competitions, Crystal Palace experienced notable success in the late 1970s and early 1990s, including a third-place finish in the top flight during the 1990-1991 season.\n\nWhile they haven't clinched major domestic trophies, Crystal Palace has consistently maintained a presence in the top tiers of English football, showcasing resilience and contributing to the vibrancy of the sport.\n\n7. Queen Park Rangers (Championship)\n\nAchievements: 2010-11 Football League Champions.\n\nRivalries: Chelsea, Fulham, Brentford.\n\nNotable: Runners-up in the 1975-76 Premiership edition.\n\nHome: Loftus Road (Capacity: 19,000).\n\nQPR's most noteworthy period came in the 1970s, where they reached the summit by winning the Football League Cup in 1967 and the Football League Second Division in 1967-1968.\n\nQPR's golden era continued into the 1975-1976 season when they narrowly missed out on winning the First Division title, finishing as runners-up. Despite not securing top-flight titles, their competitive performances garnered respect.\n\nIn the 1982-1983 season, QPR reached the FA Cup final but were defeated by Manchester United in a replay. While the club hasn't claimed major silverware in recent years, their contributions and memorable campaigns have left an indelible mark on English football history.\n\n8. Millwall FC (Championship)\n\nNotable: Reached FA Cup semifinal in 2004, qualified for UEFA Europa Cup.\n\nHistorical Rank: Considered the 40th most successful club in English history.\n\nHome: The Den (Capacity: 20,000).\n\nMillwall Football Club, often referred to as the Lions, currently competing in the Championship had it's most noteable achievement in the 2003-2004 season when they reached the FA Cup final, ultimately losing to Manchester United.\n\nIn league competitions, Millwall's notable success includes a period in the late 1980s when they gained promotions, reaching the top tier of English football.\n\n9. Charlton Athletic FC (League One)\n\nAchievements: League 2 Winners (2012), Division 2 Winners (2000)\n\nHistorical Achievement: FA Cup winners in 1947.\n\nHome: The Valley (Capacity: 27,000).\n\nCharlton Athletic Football Club, known as the Addicks, has a mixed history, with successful top division spells but mostly featuring in the lower divisions. One of their significant moments occurred in 1947 when they won the FA Cup, defeating Burnley in the final.\n\nIn terms of league success, Charlton's peak came in the late 1930s and early 1940s when they finished as runners-up in the First Division. They had another period of success in the late 1990s and early 2000s when they secured promotions and had a stint in the Premier League.\n\nWhile Charlton Athletic has not consistently remained in the top flight, their contributions to English football and historic successes, especially in the FA Cup, are etched in the club's legacy.\n\n10. Brentford F.C (Football League One)\n\nAchievements: Division 2 Winners (1935)\n\nEstablishment: Founded in 1881.\n\nHome: Gtech Community Stadium (Capacity: 17,000).\n\nBrentford F.C., claims the 10th position in our rankings. Established in 1889 in the London Borough of Hounslow, the team, affectionately known as The Bees, has had a remarkable last 10 years. In 2021, they returned to the top flight for the first time since 1947, following a failed attempt in 2020. Their recent success in the Premier League, driven by Thomas Franks' remarkable management and a clever transfer policy, has meant Brentford have flown up these rankings, but still feature below Millwall and Charlton due to historical achievements.\n\nBrentford's historical successes date back to the early 1900s when they achieved two top-five finishes in the League Championship. Griffin Park, their home venue since 1904, has witnessed their international representation and notable runs in the FA Cup, including four quarter-final appearances. Brentford is one of two teams, alongside Doncaster, to have claimed the Football League Two three times, in 1962-63, 1998-99, and most recently, 2008-09. The team has previously fluctuated between the third and fourth tiers of English football but is now looking comfy in the top tier.\n\n11.

Though not having secured major domestic trophies, the club has consistently competed in the lower tiers of English football.\n\nOne of Leyton Orient's notable moments occurred in the 1977-1978 season when they reached the FA Cup semi-finals, an achievement that showcased their resilience and competitiveness in domestic cup competitions.\n\nWhile Leyton Orient has faced challenges in the league, their role as a community-focused club and their contributions to the footballing landscape, especially in the London region, have been significant aspects of their legacy.\n\n12. AFC Wimbledon (League Two)\n\nNext on our list is AFC Wimbledon, a club rooted in Kingston upon Thames in London, despite its origins in Wimbledon. The club's intriguing narrative dates back to its founding in 2002, following Wimbledon F.C.'s relocation to Milton Keynes and subsequent transformation into MK Dons. In protest against this move, many fans, seeking to preserve their club's roots and traditions, founded AFC Wimbledon. Despite its recent establishment, the club rapidly ascended from the ninth tier in English football to League Two, achieving five promotions in nine seasons, culminating in a second-place finish in the Conference National division and promotion via playoff.\n\n13. Barnet F.C (National League)\n\nBarnet F.C., situated in North London, secures the 12th spot in our Football League Two rankings. The Bees, as they are affectionately known, clinched the title of the 2004-05 Football Conference, earning promotion to League Two, where they have maintained a continuous presence since. Founded in 1888, Barnet FC has experienced the highs and lows between the Football Conference and the Football League. Despite facing challenges in recent seasons, including a proximity to the relegation zone in the 2011-12 tables, the team's resilience prevailed. In the last fixture of the 2010-11 season, Barnet's victory and favorable outcomes for other teams secured them a one-point advantage against relegation. Underhill Stadium, also home to Arsenal FC Reserves' matches, serves as their home ground.\n\n14. Dagenham & Redbridge F.C (National League)\n\nDagenham & Redbridge F.C., commonly known as Dag & Red, emerges as the 14th team in our rankings within Football League Two.
