        "text": "Hillsborough tribute\n\n• Tuesday marks the 25th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, and as such, both teams will be showing their respect to Liverpool FC and the families of the 96 people who lost their lives on that tragic day.\n\n• Approximately five minutes before kick-off, mascots from Arsenal and West Ham United will emerge from the tunnel carrying a red wreath in the shape of 96. The mascots will then proceed to lay the wreath onto the centre spot before heading back to the tunnel.\n\n• Once the players have walked out onto the pitch and undertaken the customary pre-match handshakes, there will be a period of silence observed before kick-off. After the period of silence, the wreath will be carried off by mascots from the two clubs before being laid in-between the respective technical areas.\n\nIntroduction\n\n• West Ham United make the short trip across London to Emirates Stadium on Tuesday night for a Barclays Premier League fixture with Arsenal.\n\n• The Hammers come into the game having put up a good fight before ultimately going down to a 2-1 defeat against Liverpool at the Boleyn Ground last time out.\n\n• Sam Allardyce's side did however enjoy success on their last away league outing when they recorded a 2-1 victory against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light.\n\n• The east Londoners head into the match almost certain of their place in the Premier League for next season, having accumulated 37 points with five games left to play.\n\n• When these two sides met earlier in the season, Carlton Cole gave West Ham the lead before a Theo Walcott double and a goal from Lukas Podolski sunk the home side.\n\n• Arsenal had moved to the top of the table after the aforementioned win in December, but they now find themselves fighting for a top four finish.\n\n• The Gunners have failed to win any of their last four league outings and were soundly beaten 3-0 by Everton at Goodison Park last time out.\n\n• Arsene Wenger's team have also drawn their last two league matches at home, with a 1-1 draw against Manchester City and a 2-2 draw with Swansea City putting the buffers on their title challenge.\n\n• The Gunners did however reach the FA Cup final on Saturday after they beat Wigan Athletic on penalties .\n\nTeam news\n\nWest Ham United\n\n• Joey O'Brien is back in full training with the rest of the squad as he steps up his return to fitness following a dislocated shoulder.\n\n• Marco Borriello is still absent with a calf injury, while George McCartney tweaked a hamstring against Sunderland and will have his fitness assessed.\n\n• James Collins missed the match against Liverpool and looks likely to miss out on Tuesday night, while Kevin Nolan is a doubt with a hamstring problem.\n\nArsenal\n\n• Theo Walcott and Abou Diaby (both ACL) are Arsenal's long-term injury absentees.\n\n• Jack Wilshere (ankle), Mesut Ozil, Ryo Miyachi (both hamstring), Laurent Koscielny (calf) and Serge Gnabry (knee) are all doubts.\n\nLast time out\n\nWest Ham United 1-2 Liverpool\n\nBarclays Premier League\n\n5 April 2014\n\nWest Ham United: Adrian, Reid, Nolan (Nocerino 65), Tomkins, Armero, Carroll, Taylor (Jarvis 78), Noble, Demel, Diame (C Cole 85), Downing\n\nSubs not used: Jaaskelainen, J Cole, Potts, Johnson\n\nGoal: Demel 45\n\nArsenal: Fabianski, Sagna, Monreal (Gibbs 63), Mertesacker, Vermaelen, Ramsey (Kallstrom 113), Oxlade-Chamberlain, Arteta, Cazorla, Podolski (Giroud 68), Sanogo\n\nSubs not used: Szczesny, Jenkinson, Akpom, Eisfeld\n\nGoal: Mertesacker 82\n\nPrevious meeting\n\nArsenal scored three times in eleven second half minutes to come from behind to beat West Ham United at the Boleyn Ground on Boxing Day.

The Hammers led until the 68th minute when Theo Walcott equalised, three minutes before putting his side in front. Lukas Podolski came off the bench to put the finishing touches on the win with 79 minutes on the clock.\n\nWest Ham United 1-3 Arsenal\n\nBarclays Premier League\n\n26 December 2014\n\nWest Ham United: Adrian, O'Brien (Demel 63), Collins (Rat 38), Tomkins, McCartney, Noble, Diame, J Cole, Nolan (Taylor 75), Jarvis, C Cole\n\nSubs not used: Jaaskelainen, Collison, Maiga, Diarra\n\nGoal: C Cole 46\n\nArsenal: Sczcesny, Sagna, Mertesacker, Vermaelen, Gibbs, Ramsey (Podolski 65), Arteta, Walcott, Ozil (Flamini 81), Cazorla, Giroud (Bendtner 85)\n\nSubs not used: Fabianski, Monreal, Jenkinson, Gnabry\n\nGoals: Walcott 68, 71, Podolski 79\n\nLast six meetings\n\n(Premier League unless stated)\n\n26 December 2013 West Ham United 1-3 Arsenal\n\n23 January 2013 Arsenal 5-1 West Ham United\n\n6 October 2012 West Ham United 1-3 Arsenal\n\n15 January 2011 West Ham United 0-3 Arsenal\n\n30 October 2010 Arsenal 1-0 West Ham United\n\n20 March 2010 Arsenal 2-0 West Ham United\n\nOverall record v Arsenal (all competitions) W 33 D 38 L 57\n\nTen-year record\n\nWest Ham United\n\n2012/13 Premier League 10th (46 points)\n\n2011/12 Championship 3rd (86 points - promoted to Premier League via Play-Offs)\n\n2010/11 Premier League 20th (33 points - relegated to Championship)\n\n2009/10 Premier League 17th (35 points)\n\n2008/09 Premier League 9th (51 points)\n\n2007/08 Premier League 10th (49 points)\n\n2006/07 Premier League 15th (41 points)\n\n2005/06 Premier League 9th (55 points)\n\n2004/05 Championship 6th (73 points - promoted to Premier League via Play-Offs)\n\n2003/04 Division One 4th (74 points)\n\nArsenal\n\n2012/13 Premier League 4th (73 points)\n\n2011/12 Premier League 3rd (70 points)\n\n2010/11 Premier League 4th (68 points)\n\n2009/10 Premier League 3rd (75 points)\n\n2008/09 Premier League 4th (72 points)\n\n2007/08 Premier League 3rd (83 points)\n\n2006/07 Premier League 4th (68 points)\n\n2005/06 Premier League 4th (67 points)\n\n2004/05 Premier League 2nd (83 points)\n\n2003/04 Premier League 1st (90 points)\n\nOld boys\n\n• Guy Demel spent a season with Arsenal as a youngster, joining the Gunners as a 19-year-old in 2000.
