        "text": "Arsenal were eliminated by Bayern Munich at the quarterfinal stage of the 2023/24 UEFA Champions League.\n\nAfter a 2-2 draw in the first leg, Joshua Kimmich scored the only goal of the second leg in Germany to send Thomas Tuchel's side into the semifinals.\n\nThis was the first time in over a decade since the Gunners had reached the quarterfinal stage. They endured a miserable run at the Round of 16, suffering seven consecutive eliminations after losing to Barcelona in the 2009/10 quarterfinals.\n\nIt looked like they might suffer further disappointment in the Round of 16 when an injury-time goal from Galeno gave Porto a 1-0 win in the first leg. Leandro Trossard levelled the tie back at Emirate Stadium before a tense encounter went all the way to penalties, where David Raya was the hero. However, their Champions League campaign still ended before the semifinals, which they last reached way back in 2009.\n\nThe Sporting News tells the story of a profoundly frustrating run towards the end of Arsene Wenger's celebrated tenure, and how Mikel Arteta will need to work some magic to make things better.\n\nMORE: When is Champions League final 2024? Day, date, time\n\nArsenal's Champions League knockout stage record\n\nArsenal have never gone on to win the UEFA Champions League, but they have reached the final once: they lost to Barcelona back in 2006.\n\nTheir last semifinal appearance was back in 2008/09, when they were beaten over two legs by Manchester United.\n\nBefore 2023/24, the Gunners had suffered seven Round-of-16 eliminations in a row. This year, they got past Porto on penalties but were then defeated 3-2 on aggregate by Bayern Munich in the quarterfinals.\n\nArsenal Champions League Round of 16 exits\n\nHere's a list of Arsenal's various exits in the Champions League Round of 16, in the latter era of Arsene Wenger's stewardship. It was often a tale of near-misses, with the away goals rule knocking out the Gunners on several occasions.\n\n2010/11 — Barcelona 3 (4) Arsenal 1 (3)\n\nArsenal had an instant shot at revenge against Barca the next season and claimed a memorable first-leg win after late goals from Robin van Persie and Andrey Arshavin overturned David Villa’s first-half opener. Back at Camp Nou – as was so often the case against Premier League teams in those days – Lionel Messi took charge, scoring twice in a 3-1 win. However, Arsenal were entitled to feel aggrieved after Van Persie was controversially given a second booking for kicking the ball away after being flagged offside (he understandably claimed not to have heard the whistle) with the score 1-1 on the night.\n\n2011/12 — Arsenal 3 (3) AC Milan 0 (4)\n\nA big problem for Wenger for most of this run was finishing second in their group so facing tougher games and away second legs. However, Arsenal finished top of their section in 2011, only to be unceremoniously hammered by Milan at San Siro, where Robinho scored twice and Zlatan Ibrahimovic completed the scoring from the penalty spot. In the return at Emirates Stadium, Laurent Koscielny’s early goal made the Gunners faithful dream of the impossible. Tomas Rosicky and Van Persie made it 3-0 by halftime but the Rossoneri were able to hang on.\n\n2012/13 — Bayern Munich 0 (3) Arsenal 2 (3)\n\nAs when they drew Barcelona in 2011, Arsenal had the misfortune of being paired with the team on their way to glory. However, after a commanding 3-1 win in London, Bayern were almost undone by another attempted second-leg heist. Olivier Giroud struck in the third minute at the Allianz Arena and a nervy encounter unfolded against their illustrious hosts, who did not know whether to stick or twist. Koscielny headed home four minutes to play but Wenger’s men ran out of time to complete the job as Bayern progressed via the away goals rule.\n\n2013/14 — Bayern Munich 1 (3) Arsenal 1 (1)\n\nOnce more into the breach against Bayern and it was the same story again at the Emirates. Toni Kroos and Thomas Muller were on target in a 2-0 win, where Arsenal were their own worst enemies before halftime as Mesut Ozil missed an eighth-minute spot kick and Wojciech Szczesny was sent off. David Alaba similarly failed from 12 yards against stand-in keeper Lukasz Fabianski but Bayern’s numerical advantage duly took a toll. They avoided anything too dicey in the return leg, as Bastien Schweinsteiger and Lukas Podolski exchanged goals in quick succession. The game ended in a 1-1 draw that featured another penalty miss from Muller.\n\n2014/15 — Monaco 0 (3) Arsenal 2 (3)\n\nAfter finishing second and drawing heavyweights such as Barcelona and Bayern in the past, Arsenal were handed what looked like a favourable showdown with Group C winners Monaco in 2015. Leonardo Jardim’s side made light of their underdogs tag with a clinical performance at Emirates Stadium. A 2-0 deficit when Dimitar Berbatov scored shortly after halftime was bad enough, but Yannick Carrasco responded to Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain pulling one back with a stoppage-time goal of his own. Ultimately that proved decisive as Giroud and Aaron Ramsey secured a 2-0 win in Monaco, meaning another away goals exit.\n\n2015/16 — Barcelona 3 (5) Arsenal 1 (1)\n\nThe most dispiriting thing about Wenger’s final two Champions League campaigns was the lack of near-misses and heroically-attempted comebacks. Messi scored both goals for Barca in a 2-0 win at Emirates Stadium before his partners in crime Neymar and Luis Suiarez got in on the act. A 51st-minute equaliser from Mohamed Elneny at Camp Nou provided the briefest, tiniest silver lining.\n\n2016/17 — Arsenal 1 (2) Bayern Munich 5 (10)\n\nIt was Bayern again in 2017 and a tie that made the Barcelona games a year earlier look comparatively close. Alexis Sanchez equalised after Arjen Robben’s 11th-minute opener but Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Muller scored either side of a Thiago Alcantara brace in a rampant second half at the Allianz Arena. Theo Walcott gave Arsenal a first-half lead to keep Wenger’s men vaguely in the hunt in the second leg. However, Koscielny was sent off in the 53rd minute, Lewandowski scored from the resulting penalty and a painful ordeal ensued. Arturo Vidal’s late brace rounded off another 5-1 win, the sort of experience that could make you wish for six years away from this competition.\n\n2016/17 — Arsenal 1 (1) Porto 0(1): Arsenal won 4-2 on penalties\n\nDespite being in scintillating goalscoring form in the Premier League, Arsenal failed to muster a shot on target at Estadio do Dragao, with Galano securing the win for Sergio Conceicao's combative side. At an emotionally charged Emirates Stadium, Arsenal had to bide their time and it took a piece of creative magic from Martin Odegaard to set up Trossard for an assured finish.\n\nThere were not further goals in a high-intensity encounter, leaving Raya to be the hero as he saved from Wendell and Galano. Odegaard, Kai Havertz, Bukayo Saka and Declan Rice were immaculate from 12 yards.\n\nHave Arsenal ever won the Champions League?\n\nEarlier in the Wenger era, there were other examples of frustration in the now-defunct second group stage and early knockout rounds. The closest Arsenal have ever come to glory was in 2006, when they reached the final in Paris against Barcelona and led through Sol Campbell. This was despite goalkeeper Jens Lehmann being sent off in the 18th minute. The Gunners finally wilted as Samuel Eto’o and Juliano Belletti scored inside the final quarter of an hour.\n\nWenger's team reached the semifinals in 2009 but had the misfortune of running into a Cristiano Ronaldo-inspired Manchester United, who were beaten by Messi’s Barcelona in the final in any case."
