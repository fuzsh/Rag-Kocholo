They owed a debt to fine refereeing from Mark Clattenburg, who played a crucial advantage after Paulo Ferreira appeared to foul Fabregas to allow Song to slide a close-range finish past Cech.\n\nAncelotti made a change at the start of the second half, sending on Ramires for Jon Mikel Obi, but his plans were in shreds as Arsenal struck twice in the space of two minutes just after the break.\n\nFabregas added the second from Walcott's pass after Michael Essien inadvertently turned the ball towards his own goal. Walcott then sent the home fans at the Emirates into ecstasy by adding a third in Arsenal's next attack, racing clear to beat Cech as Fabregas returned the favour with a perfect pass to send him through.\n\nChelsea were stunned and their frustrations surfaced as Drogba and Terry were involved in a furious exchange of views near the centre circle as Arsenal's elated players celebrated.\n\nAncelotti's side needed a swift response to offer any hope of a revival and it came after 57 minutes when Ivanovic reached Drogba's angled free-kick ahead of keeper Lukasz Fabianski to head home.\n\nWenger was furious in his technical area, but Nasri should have calmed his nerves when he took advantage of more Chelsea uncertainty at the back only to fire tamely at Cech.\n\nChelsea probed in the closing stages, but Arsenal were never in serious discomfort and closed out an outstanding triumph.\n\nMatch[]\n\nDetails[]\n\n27 December 2010\n\n20:00 GMT\n\nArsenal 3–1 Chelsea Emirates Stadium, London\n\nAttendance: 60,112\n\nReferee: Mark Clattenburg Song 44'\n\nFàbregas 51'\n\nWalcott 53' HT:1–0\n\nReport Ivanović 57'\n\n21 Łukasz Fabiański 03 Bacary Sagna 06 Laurent Koscielny 20 Johan Djourou 22 Gaël Clichy 04 Cesc Fàbregas 88' 08 Samir Nasri 14 Theo Walcott 73' 17 Alex Song 19 Jack Wilshere 10 Robin van Persie 76' Substitutes: 53 Wojciech Szczęsny 18 Sébastien Squillaci 02 Abou Diaby 73' 07 Tomáš Rosický 88' 23 Andrey Arshavin 29 Marouane Chamakh 76' 52 Nicklas Bendtner Manager: Arsène Wenger\n\n01 Petr Čech 02 Branislav Ivanović 03 Ashley Cole 19 Paulo Ferreira 61' 26 John Terry 05 Michael Essien 08 Frank Lampard 12 John Obi Mikel 46' 15 Florent Malouda 56' 11 Didier Drogba 21 Salomon Kalou Substitutes: 22 Ross Turnbull 17 José Bosingwa 61' 38 Patrick van Aanholt 43 Jeffrey Bruma 07 Ramires 46' 46 Josh McEachran 44 Gaël Kakuta 56' Manager: Carlo Ancelotti\n\nMatch Stats[]\n\n[]\n\nMatch report at BBC.co.uk\n\nPremier League 2010–11\n\nArsenal · Aston Villa · Birmingham City · Blackburn Rovers · Blackpool · Bolton Wanderers · Chelsea · Everton · Fulham · Liverpool · Manchester City · Manchester United · Newcastle United · Stoke City · Sunderland · Tottenham Hotspur · West Bromwich Albion · West Ham United · Wigan Athletic · Wolverhampton Wanderers"
