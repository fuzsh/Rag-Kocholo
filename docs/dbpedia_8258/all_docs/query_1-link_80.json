        "text": "ON January 3, 2009 Eddie Howe embarked upon the biggest challenge of his football career.\n\nThe Bournemouth legend had been a Cherry through and through, spending his entire youth career and all but two years of his senior career at the club.\n\nIn fact, in 2004, Cherries fans created an 'Eddieshare' fund in order to help the club buy back their hero from Portsmouth, where Howe spent two years.\n\nKeep up to date with ALL the Bournemouth news, gossip, transfers and goals on our club page plus fixtures, results and live match commentary.\n\nHowe was promoted to a player coach role in 2006 aged just 29 and took charge of the reserve team.\n\nOn December 31, 2008 he was handed the top job following the sacking of Jimmy Quinn.\n\nAt that point, Bournemouth were struggling mightily, both financially and in the league, sitting 23rd in League 2 with a dreadful seven points from their 24 games due to a 17-point deduction imposed in the summer for financial reasons.\n\nIn fact, they sat only above Luton Town in the entire Football League...\n\nEven then, the Hatters had been docked a whopping 30 points in the summer, meaning the Cherries were essentially dead last and facing a near-certain drop to non-league football.\n\nBut now, eight years on they prepare to take on Arsenal in the Premier League, thinking less about surviving the drop and more about a push for the European places.\n\nHere's Howe the Cherries made it happen...\n\n2008-09: Heroic Howe\n\nTAKING over the ropes of a new club halfway through a season is never an easy task, let alone when said team is all but certain to be relegated.\n\nYet with under half the season to go, just 22 games, Howe pulled off the impossible, leading his side to 21st place with 46 points, including 17 wins to avoid the dreaded drop by an impressive nine points, consigning Luton and Chester to life in the non-league.\n\n2009-10: Howe is that possible?\n\nFROM a 17-point deduction and a quick flirt with relegation, Howe did the impossible just 12 months later.\n\nEight wins from their first nine games set the tone as Bournemouth went on to finish second in League 2 with 83 points to gain automatic promotion to League 1.\n\n2010-11: So close\n\nA NEW season, a new league, but the same old story as the Cherries went on a rampant run of wins under Eddie Howe, finishing the year sixth in League 1.\n\nShowing no signs of struggling with the jump in class, Bournemouth racked up 71 points to sneak into the play-off places, only to fall short as Peterborough took the third promotion place... This time, at least.\n\n2011-12: Growing pains\n\nIF 2010-11 was the sighter, then 2011-12 was meant to be the year Howe and Co made the push to the Championship after falling agonisingly short a year prior.\n\nYet it wasn't to be as the side lost their man in charge to Premier League-chasing Burnley.\n\nThey struggled for consistency under Lee Bradbury and subsequently Paul Groves, losing 18 league games as they finished just 11th on 58 points.\n\n2012-13: Howe do you like me now?\n\nAFTER one season at Turf Moor, Howe returned heroically, just like during his playing career to his home club Bournemouth.\n\n24 wins in 2012-13 saw the Cherries accrue 83 points... Enough to earn automatic promotion to the Championship, behind only Doncaster Rovers in the league.\n\n2013-14: Solid start\n\nTHE gulf in class between the second and third tier of English football is well-noted, but you would never have guessed it by watching Bournemouth.\n\nThe Cherries won 18 of their games as they racked up 66 points - good for tenth in the table, just six points behind the play-off places... A remarkable feat in their first season of Championship football.\n\n2014-15: Championship champions\n\nLEICESTER may have grabbed the headlines 12 months prior as they breached the 100-points barrier to win the league, but Bournemouth stunned the nation in 2014-15.\n\nTheir tally of 26 wins - including an 8-0 drubbing of Birmingham - just eight losses, 98 goals and 90 points saw them win the league and earn themselves a staggering promotion to the holy grail... The Premier League.\n\n2015-16: Prem or bust\n\nGETTING a flying start in your first ever season in the Premier League is a near-impossible task, one not made any easier by a host of big-name injuries to stars such as Max Gradel and Callum Wilson.\n\nYet Howe never let his side give up as they battled until the final day, ending up 16th in their debut bow, five points above the relegation zone.\n\n2016-17: European dreams\n\nHALFWAY through the new season, after 19 games, and Howe has masterminded a stunning few months.\n\nThe south coast club currently sit ninth in the league as they prepare to take on Arsenal and ahead of the now-established Premier League side - and local rivals - Southampton.\n\nWhile a European push seems ambitious, 15 points behind Manchester United in sixth - it appears the Cherries are less worried by relegation and more concerned by taking huge strides forward.\n\nThat's some feat just eight years to the day since they were staring non-league football in the face..."
