Two players competed for the U.S. at the 2011 FIFA U-17 World Cup, while another competed for New Zealand. Overall, seven players have experience playing with their respective Youth National Teams while five have earned NSCAA Youth Boys All-American honors. UCLA's 2013 class has been named the No. 1 class in the country by Top Drawer Soccer.\n\n\"Our 2013 recruiting class is comprised of very talented players,\" head coach Jorge Salcedo said. \"There is some skill and technique, athleticism and experience, but above all it is a group that has a strong desire to be the best soccer players they can be. Our staff is very excited to work with each of them. This elite recruiting class is a byproduct of a lot of work from several individuals within our Athletic Department and I would like to sincerely thank them for their assistance throughout the process.\"\n\nThis is the fourth time that Salcedo has brought in the No. 1 ranked recruiting class in his tenure as UCLA head coach, signing the top-rated classes in 2004, 2006, 2010 and now 2013. The Bruins have also won six Pac-12 titles under Salcedo's leadership, have been to two College Cups (2006 and 2011) and have reached the NCAA Quarterfinals four times (2006, 2009, 2010 and 2011).
