        "text": "Arsenal suffered a heartbreaking stoppage time goal to see them lose 1-0 to Porto in a dull affair in Portugal meaning they need to come from behind at the Emirates in the second leg to make it through to the quarter-finals.\n\nPorto have a strong record at home against Arsenal and from the off looked determined to break up the Gunners’ flow and rhythm. It was a stop-start match throughout with Porto creating the better chances as Galeno hit the post and volleyed wide of goal in the same first half attack.\n\nWith 10 minutes or so to go Arsenal looked to shut up shop and cling onto the draw - which would have been an okay result - but some sloppy play in stoppage time saw them lose possession and allowed Galeno to drive forward before whipping a wonderful finish past David Raya to earn the hosts a win.\n\nRelive the action from the Champions League tonight plus get the latest odds and tips right here:\n\nPorto vs Arsenal LIVE\n\nPorto defeat leaves Arsenal with an awkward Champions League problem to solve\n\nPorto’s late goal saw them beat Arsenal in the Champions League last-16 first leg\n\n90+4’ GOAL! - Galeno curls a scorcher into the back of the net (POR 1-0 ARS)\n\n41’ SHOT! - Evanilson’s shot is kept out but Raya (POR 0-0 ARS)\n\n22’ POST! - Galeno hits the post before volleying wide the rebound (POR 0-0 ARS)\n\nFC Porto 1 - 0 Arsenal FC\n\nPorto defeat leaves Arsenal with an awkward Champions League problem to solve\n\n22:16 , Mike Jones\n\nA twist on the night, from one glorious curling long-range effort. It really was something out of nothing. Just when Arsenal’s trip to Porto seemed to be drifting towards the most dismal of 0-0s, Wenderson Galeno took hold and let fly to suddenly leave Mikel Arteta’s side having a lot to do in the second leg of this Champions League last-16 tie. They now must overcome a 1-0 deficit, having seemed to be rather complacently settling for a draw.\n\nIt should never have got to this, but then Arsenal never got going. That is perhaps the greatest frustration, as Porto - and, admittedly, an overly officious referee - ensured this was the worst type of stop-start game.\n\nIt has certainly stopped Arsenal scoring. After having scored 21 goals in five games, to seemingly end all talk of a staleness afflicting their attack, Arteta’s team went through a blank for the first time since the turn of the year.\n\nPorto defeat leaves Arsenal with an awkward Champions League problem to solve\n\nMartin Keown speaking on TNT Sports\n\n22:25 , Mike Jones\n\n“The handbrake was on a little too much, was that inexperience? They need to hold that hurt now. Porto contained Arsenal.”\n\nFT Porto 1-0 Arsenal\n\n22:19 , Mike Jones\n\nArsenal didn’t do much wrong in that game but they’re on the end of a classic finish to a Champions League knockout game. The team seemingly in control being taken out by a surprising late goal.\n\nMost of the Arsenal squad haven’t experienced that before with this being their first taste of Champions League knockout football but they will be loath to repeat it at the Emirates.\n\nThe Gunners are still in the contest but they’ll need to play without the handbrake on if they are to overturn the deficit.\n\nFull-time! Porto 1-0 Arsenal\n\n21:56 , Mike Jones\n\nArsenal win a late free kick that Declan Rice curls into the box. Gabriel gets his head to the ball but nods it over the bar and out of play.\n\nThe full-time whistle goes and the game ends. Porto are tie heading to London with a slender lead but Arsenal will be confident about winning at the Emirates.\n\nA dull affair until the late drama but not the worst result for the Gunners though they’ll need to come from behind to reach the quarter-finals.\n\nGOAL! Porto 1-0 Arsenal (Galeno, 90+4’)\n\n21:54 , Mike Jones\n\n90+4 mins: Arsenal give possession away and Galeno drives the ball down the inside left channel. He rolls it onto his right foot and whips a superb finish into the far corner!\n\nDavid Raya leaps across but can’t get there, Porto have won this one late on.\n\nPorto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n21:49 , Mike Jones\n\n90 mins: Four minutes of added time to play. Perhaps time enough for someone to nick a win though that may be beyond both teams.\n\nPorto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n21:48 , Mike Jones\n\n87 mins: There has been one shot on target in the whole game. Arsenal have apparently created five attempts (none on target) though it’s a struggle to remember any of them.\n\nThis hasn’t been an exciting game. Call it quits now and head to the Emirates where it should be slightly more exciting.\n\nPorto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n21:44 , Mike Jones\n\n84 mins: Arsenal’s last goalless draw came in January 2023 in a 0-0 against Newcastle. That’s over a year ago but the signs are strong that this match will be following a similar route.\n\nPorto make a couple of changes with a touch over five minutes left to play.\n\nPorto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n21:41 , Mike Jones\n\n81 mins: Into the last 10 minutes and stil there isn’t much to write home about. Injuries are starting to creep into the home players as they look to keep Arsenal quiet.\n\nPorto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n21:39 , Mike Jones\n\n78 mins: Saka and Odegaard attempt to combine on the right side of the pitch but there’s no way into the box and Saka is forced to send the ball backwards.\n\nThe gunners come forward again and win their eighth corner of the match. Can they create something from this one?\n\nNo, Costa comes out again and touches the ball over Havertz before Porto are awarded a free kick.\n\nPorto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n21:34 , Mike Jones\n\n75 mins: 15 minutes to play in Portugal and neither side has the advantage. Bukayo Saka whips a corner into the penalty area but Diogo Costa leaps towards the ball and plucks it out of the air.\n\nWill we see a winner?\n\nPorto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n21:31 , Mike Jones\n\n72 mins: Otavio puts himself in a lot of trouble trying to dribble out from the back with Odegaard hunting him down. The defender feels some contact and goes down convincing the referee to blow the whistle for a free kick.\n\nPorto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n21:27 , Mike Jones\n\n69 mins: Varela approaches Havertz on his blindside and catches an elbow from the Arsenal man who didn’t even see him. The German becomes the third Arsenal player shown a yellow card in this match.\n\nPorto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n21:24 , Mike Jones\n\n66 mins: Martinelli manages to createa situation where he can run at Pepe. He goes around the defender and takes the ball into the box but Varela scurries back and wins the ball for the hosts.\n\nGreat defending.\n\nPorto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n21:22 , Mike Jones\n\n63 mins: Gonzalez yanks back Havertz after the Arsenal man wins the ball off Varela and looks to drive forward through the middle of the pitch.\n\nThe foul is committed right in front of the referee who brandishes a yellow card.\n\nPorto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n21:20 , Mike Jones\n\n60 mins: Kiwior brings Conceicao down just outside the penalty area and the home side have the chance to trouble the Arsenal goalkeeper.\n\nThe free kick is flicked in from the right by Wendell who curls it over everyone and straight out of play.\n\nPorto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n21:15 , Mike Jones\n\n57 mins: At the other end of the pitch, the younger Pepe is slipped into the right side of the area. He has the chance to shoot but tries to backheel it for Conceicao only to give possession back to Arsenal who walk it clear.\n\nPorto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n21:13 , Mike Jones\n\n54 mins: Martinelli is starting to come alive. He carries the ball into the box and curls in a cross. Pepe nods it away but Martin Odegaard recovers the ball and shoots from range.\n\nHe hits the ball well but sends it straight at Leandro Trossard who can’t get out of the way.\n\nPorto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n21:11 , Mike Jones\n\n51 mins: Martinelli manages to weave his way into a bit of space but Conceicao grabs his shirt and cynically pulls the winger to the floor.\n\nIt’s an easy decision for the referee who pulls out the yellow card.\n\nPorto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n21:07 , Mike Jones\n\n48 mins: Martinelli is caught after collecting a loose ball but Porto are awarded a free kick because of a foul previously committed by Jakub Kiwior.\n\nThe match seems as physical as it did in the first half.\n\nSecond half! Porto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n21:04 , Mike Jones\n\nArsenal get the ball rolling again for the second half.\n\nThe TNT Sports pundits, Rio Ferdinand and Martin Keown, both agree that the Gunners can leave this match with a draw but don’t want to concede in the next 45 minutes.\n\nMikel Arteta will want to win this one though.\n\nHT Porto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n21:01 , Mike Jones\n\nPorto have two players called Pepe in their side tonight.\n\nOne is a 40-year-old veteran Portugal defender who won this trophy three times with Real Madrid. The other Pepe is a 26-year-old Brazilian winger.\n\nHT Porto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n20:55 , Mike Jones\n\nWith Francisco Conceicao (21) and Otavio (21) both starting tonight, FC Porto have named two players aged 21 or under in the starting XI for a Champions League knockout stage game for the first time since March 2018 v Liverpool (Diogo Dalot and Bruno Costa).\n\nHT Porto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n20:51 , Mike Jones\n\nIt’s been a struggle for Arsenal so far though they have controlled possession effectively. Mikel Arteta will need to inspire the players at the break.\n\nPorto have been frustratingly solid.\n\nHalf-time! Porto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n20:47 , Mike Jones\n\n45+1 mins: The whistle goes to end the first half in Portugal. Arsenal dominated the ball, Porto had the best chance and hit the post.\n\nThose are the highlights. Let’s hope the second half is more exciting.\n\nPorto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n20:46 , Mike Jones\n\n45 mins: Just the one minute added on at the end of the first half. Arsenal have another corner, can they create something from this set piece?\n\nYes! Saka picks out Havertz over by the far post but his header is nodded into the deck where it bounces wide.\n\nPorto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n20:41 , Mike Jones\n\n41 mins: Porto are turning up the heat as half-time approches. Pepe, the 26-year-old winger, takes the ball into the penalty area and backheels it to Evanilson.\n\nHe shoots and drills a low effort through Declan Rice’s legs but David Raya is on hand to smother the effort.\n\nPorto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n20:38 , Mike Jones\n\n38 mins: Nico Gonzalez hits a clean strike from a long way out and David Raya is interested for few a moment before the ball rises up and over the crossbar.\n\nDecent attempt but not troubling for the Arsenal goalkeeper.\n\nPorto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n20:36 , Mike Jones\n\n35 mins: Close!\n\nArsenal whip the ball into the box from a corner once more and this time William Saliba gets on the end of it. He doesn’t catch his header quite right and the ball is sent wide of the nearest post.\n\nArsenal’s best chance so far and Saliba should arguably have done better to find the target.\n\nPorto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n20:33 , Mike Jones\n\n32 mins: Arsenal have already had 70% possession but I can’t recall a single opportunity to challenge Diogo Costa. The Gunners aren’t finding it easy at all to play through Porto.\n\nMikel Arteta needs to come up with a solution as Leandro Trossard drills a long range effort into the stands.\n\nPorto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n20:30 , Mike Jones\n\n29 mins: Gabriel Martinelli is being marked by two players whenever he gets the ball. He’s not been able to run at Joao Mario yet and hasn’t get in behind.\n\nIt’s part of a gameplan from Porto which is working very effectively indeed.\n\nPorto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n20:28 , Mike Jones\n\n26 mins: Arsenal, who have recently been very good at set pieces, are being bullied by the Porto defenders.\n\nBukayo Saka swings a cross into the middle of the six yard box but the goalkeeper claims it easily as none of the Arsenal attackers can break free of their markers.\n\nPorto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n20:23 , Mike Jones\n\n22 mins: Chance!\n\nPorto should be in front. They attack down the right again and pull the ball back into the middle. Galeno darts ahead of William Saliba before whipping a shot into the far post.\n\nThe rebound comes back to the forward who then volleys a second effort wide of the near post and jogs away in disbelief.\n\nPorto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n20:21 , Mike Jones\n\n21 mins: Joao Mario injects a bit of pace into Porto’s attack as he makes an overlapping run and collects the ball down the right flank.\n\nThe defender takes on Jakub Kiwior before looking for a cross. Kiwior gets the block in and the ball loops into the air where David Raya is left with the simplest of catches.\n\nPorto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n20:18 , Mike Jones\n\n18 mins: Declan Rice swings the free kick into the box but Diogo Costa comes off his line to punch the ball clear without too much trouble.\n\nPorto then attempt to fly forward down the left but Nico Gonzalez runs the ball out of play.\n\nPorto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n20:16 , Mike Jones\n\n15 mins: Ben White whips a lovely switch of play over to the left wing where Kai Havertz brings the ball under control. He sends it back to Martin Odegaard who is brought down by Pepe for an Arsenal free kick.\n\nThere’s a conversation as Arsenal set up the set piece.\n\nPorto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n20:13 , Mike Jones\n\n12 mins: For a team as flowy and exciting as Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal the early stages of this match have been anything but. It’s slow, steady, and without much intensity.\n\nPasses and being moved across the pitch but there’s no urgency from either team.\n\nPorto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n20:11 , Mike Jones\n\n9 mins: Francisco Conceicao receives the ball and looks to turn into space in midfield. He’s clipped by Leandro Trossard and the pressure eases up on the hosts as they win a free kick.\n\nArsenal are dominating possession but haven’t done much with it.\n\nPorto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n20:07 , Mike Jones\n\n6 mins: Arsenal are trying to shift Porto up the pitch as the home side seem wary in these opening stages. They’re sat deeper than the Gunners’ pacey wingers would like and there’s not much space in behind yet.\n\nPorto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n20:03 , Mike Jones\n\n3 mins: Declan Rice lunges into a tackle on Galeno who attempts to weave down the line. Rice catches the forward and brings him down which also earns the midfielder the first yellow card of the match.\n\nKick off! Porto 0-0 Arsenal\n\n20:01 , Mike Jones\n\nThe home side get the match underway and work the ball into the back line. A fizzing crossfield pass is drilled towards Ben White but William Saliba intercepts before the ball reaches his teammate and Arsenal take control of the ball.\n\nPorto vs Arsenal\n\n19:57 , Mike Jones\n\nHere come the players.\n\nMartin Odegaard leads out the Gunners with most of the starting XI making their debuts in the Champions League knockout rounds.\n\nHow will Mikel Arteta’s men fare tonight? Kick off is up next...\n\nPorto vs Arsenal\n\n19:55 , Mike Jones\n\nAt 40 years and 360 days Pepe is the oldest outfield player to start a knockout stage game in the Champions League, beating the previous record of Ryan Giggs for Manchester United against Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals in April 2014 (40 years 123 days).\n\nBukayo Saka sets sights on first Arsenal hat-trick amid goalscoring form\n\n19:50 , Mike Jones\n\nBukayo Saka is targeting his first Arsenal hat-trick after the in-form winger scored braces in back-to-back emphatic away wins for Mikel Arteta’s title challengers.\n\nThe 22-year-old and his team-mates are in electric form and followed up last weekend’s 6-0 win at West Ham by battering Burnley 5-0 on Saturday.\n\nSaka scored a spot-kick and a goal from an open play in each of those emphatic triumphs but the academy graduate’s wait for a first Arsenal hat-trick goes on.\n\nBukayo Saka sets sights on first Arsenal hat-trick amid goalscoring form\n\nPorto vs Arsenal\n\n19:45 , Mike Jones\n\nPorto have been eliminated from seven of their eight Champions League knockout ties against English opposition. The exception was a last-16 victory against Manchester United on their way to lifting the trophy in 2003/04.\n\nPorto vs Arsenal\n\n19:40 , Mike Jones\n\nArsenal are unbeaten in their last eight Uefa club competition matches against Portuguese teams with three wins and five draws.\n\nHowever they were eliminated on penalties by Sporting in last season’s Europa League after 2-2 and 1-1 draws between the teams.\n\nArsenal have more than recent history to rewrite in Champions League\n\n19:35 , Mike Jones\n\nOver the past few days, some of the Arsenal squad have been playing the Champions League theme to each other.\n\nThere’s a giddiness around the travelling group, that has been amplified by the team’s raucous recent form. It is a welcome reminder of how the gravitas of the competition can still bring a simple thrill, even as it faces bigger questions.\n\nThe Arsenal players feel this is where they should be every season. Instead, Mikel Arteta has actually been preparing for the club’s first Champions League knockout tie in seven years.

But they have so much energy and enthusiasm to play well and that’s our desire and how we’re going to play the game.\n\n“It’s great. We have earned the right to be here. It’s been seven years since we’ve been at the top table for these kind of matches and 14 years since we were able to go to the next stage.\n\n“That’s the challenge.
