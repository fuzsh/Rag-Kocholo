        "text": "UCLA head coach Jorge Salcedo has landed the top-ranked recruiting class in the country for the second year in a row, signing seven standouts to National Letters of Intent.\n\nFour of the seven players in this class hail from the state of California, with one player coming from Washington, another coming from Ghana, and one other hailing from Virginia. In addition, five players have either competed for or trained with the U.S. Youth National Team, with two players earning caps for the team. Also, six of the seven players in this class are ranked among the top 150 recruits in the country according to both College Soccer News and Top Drawer Soccer.\n\nThe Bruins have already added forward Larry Ndjock from Loyola University Maryland as a part of this class, as he enrolled at UCLA in the winter and has already joined the program.\n\n\"The 2014 class is one that we are very proud of,\" head coach Jorge Salcedo said. \"The group of guys that will be joining the UCLA Soccer family will have a tremendous impact both on and off the field. Throughout the recruiting process it became apparent that they were a special group because of their talents as soccer players, but also because of their desire to be the best they can be in all facets of their lives. This class absolutely addresses some of our needs for the 2014 season and we could potentially add more players down the road for this class. Each of them have a technical base that we require to play the dominant possession style we attempt to achieve game in and game out. The electric pace that will come from the attacking players in this group will add a dimension that will allow us to vary the way we attack teams. This is very exciting for us, because the 2014 class will join a team that brings back several integral players from a successful 2013 season.\"\"\n\nThis is the fifth time that Salcedo has brought in the No. 1 ranked recruiting class in his tenure as UCLA head coach, signing the top-rated classes in 2004, 2006, 2010, 2013 and now 2014. The Bruins have also won six Pac-12 titles under Salcedo's leadership, have been to two College Cups (2006 and 2011) and have reached the NCAA Quarterfinals four times (2006, 2009, 2010 and 2011). In addition, Salcedo has been named the Pac-12 Coach of the Year on four occasions and has produced 22 MLS Draft picks in his 10 years as head coach. UCLA opened its spring spring schedule this past Wednesday with a closed door scrimmage against the Los Angeles Galaxy.\n\n\"Our current group coupled with the incoming freshmen class gives us a very talented group for 2014,\" Salcedo added. \"We are positioned to continue to hunt for Pac-12 Championships and a National Championship over the next several years. I am obviously very excited about this group and look forward to integrating each of them in our system and style of play. There are so many people who contributed to making this years class very special. Nick Carlin-Voigt spent tireless hours on shaping this group. The administration, compliance office and recruiting staff were all crucial components to making this class a reality. I am thankful and grateful for each person who had a hand in bringing this tremendous group of student-athletes to our program.\"\n\n2014 UCLA Men’s Soccer Signing Class\n\nName Pos. Ht. Wt.

He is arguably the best central forward in the state of Washington and the fastest player in the Seattle Sounders Academy. Seyi is another player with tremendous raw pace who can keep teams honest with his ability to run behind and score goals while also checking underneath to combine and link play.

Will was the MVP of our UCLA summer camp and demonstrated his speed of play and ability to break down defenses through his clean passing. He is another sleeper who was off most people’s radar. We think Will has a huge upside and we couldn’t be more excited that he turned down a professional contract to become a student-athlete at UCLA.”\n\nAbu Danladi\n\nTakoradi, Ghana (Dunn HS/Santa Barbara Soccer Club)\n\nForward - 5-10, 175\n\nAttended Dunn High School (Los Olivos, Calif.) for four years (2011-14), earning three letters in soccer under head coach Mark Geriak... ranked No. 22 on College Soccer News’s list of Top 150 Recruits for 2014… also ranked as the No. 29 club player in the country by Top Drawer Soccer…earned All-CIF honors in 2012 and 2013…named the team MVP in both 2012 and 2013 and the team captain in 2013 and 2014…competed for the Santa Barbara Soccer Club under head coach Rudy Ybarra…led Santa Barbara SC to a number six national ranking…served as a guest player for the South Coast Strikers in the summer of 2012…played for the South Coast Strikers at the 2012 Milk Cup in Northern Ireland…was the second leading scorer in the tournament, scoring seven goals, including four against Tottenham Hotspur’s academy team…graduate of Ghana’s Right to Dream program, which helps young men from Ghana further their education with opportunities in the United States and other countries…also earned a letter in volleyball at Dunn High School in 2012.\n\nHead coach Jorge Salcedo: “Abu is not only a wonderful player but a great person who brings out the best in everyone around him.

He doesn’t know the meaning of entitled and always puts the team first. Abu is an electric forward who has the pace and intelligence to stretch the game with the ability pull a rabbit out of a hat to win games. Adding Abu’s raw pace to our attack will add a different dimension from our successful teams the past few years and he’s someone we are very excited to blend into our group.
