        "text": "By Tony Attwood\n\nThat question above is an important one in my view, and it is one that has been hanging around for a long time.\n\nThe general feeling in the media these days is, “nothing much”. The feeling among some fans is “protest about Wenger”.\n\nMy view is a little different, and it starts from the position that action of this type should only be taken when it has a chance of success. Taking action which is unlikely to make things better tends only to draw attention to the individual protester. Not only does it not work, it can also have the affect of significantly reducing the chance of getting the change that is wanted because it removes pressure from the real problem area and diverts it to the protesters.\n\nFor Arsenal, as for most clubs, the change that is desired is for the club to do better on the pitch. To win competitions and, if not effect a dominance of the type achieved by Bayern Munich (such that the league generally becomes a one horse race), at least be in regular contention.\n\nThere can be other things that fans like: bringing through our own youth players and keeping them at the club is something that I think quite a few Arsenal fans want. Being seen to be an organisation with a social conscience is not bad either. Offering the fans a good deal financially is often an implicit aim, sometimes explicit.\n\nBut all of these are extras: winning the trophies is the key – although even this can be modified over time.\n\nIn this decade – so counting from 2010/11 onwards – and looking at clubs that have won more than one competition in this era, and leaving out the League Cup which we know is competed (at least in the earlier rounds) by reserve teams, we find…\n\nChelsea have won the Premier League twice, the Europa league once, the FA Cup once and the Champions League once. Five trophies.\n\nManchester United have won the Premier League twice, the FA Cup once, and the Europa League once. Four trophies\n\nManchester City have won the Premier League twice, and the FA Cup once. Three trophies\n\nArsenal have won the FA Cup three times. Three trophies.\n\nFour teams is all we have in England who have won two or more trophies in this period. In fact even if we include teams that have won just one trophy we only add two more clubs to the list. Interestingly that does not include Tottenham, Liverpool or Everton, who are currently seen by the media to be major players in such matters. Arsenal as we know are often discounted because the FA Cup is the wrong trophy.\n\nSo let’s say that this is not nearly good enough for Arsenal, and some changes are needed. What to do?\n\nAmy Lawrence in today’s Guardian expresses the view that, “Social media protestations or occasional chants at the stadium, such as at the final [Arsenal] home match of last season against Everton and a bad-tempered AGM when Kroenke comes to town, have not yet had any major impact.\n\n“Ordinary fans will not have it easy trying to take it to the billionaires…”\n\nNow I agree with her in that the only way to change a club’s approach is to change the owner, not simply change the manager. Mr Wenger will go one day of course, but the notion that bringing in a new manager will automatically bring success is, I fear, doomed. It is the owner that is the key.\n\nIn the summer the clubs in the list above spent these amounts:\n\nArsenal £46m\n\nChelsea: £187m\n\nManchester City: £219m\n\nManchester United: £146m\n\nOn this basis Arsenal are punching above their weight having won three trophies in this period. Not least because trophy-less Liverpool who don’t make it into our chart spent £90m give or take, in the summer.\n\nThere simply is no way that the current owner is going to authorise that sort of expenditure by Arsenal, so simply changing the manager is not going to work. More than likely if Arsenal rush into changing the manager they will get someone who will fail to nurture youth players as Mr Wenger has done, and so that limited expenditure will really start to eat into the club. Winning the FA Cup three times since 2010/11 will start to look like a golden age.\n\nTo compete with the big money clubs noted above one either needs a change in the rules or a change in the owner. There is a rule that says that clubs’ expenditure on player wages should only go up by £7m a year excluding increases in club income. So if a club’s income from TV goes up by £30m in a year, they can increase wages by £37m that year.\n\nThat might help restrain the other three clubs in the list above a little bit, but seeing how clubs are thwarting the FFP rules anyway and flagrantly breaking academy rules I am not sure it is going to happen.\n\nSo if Arsenal want to compete with Man U, Man C and Chelsea, and do it in the way that those three clubs do it, they will need a lot more money to be spent on players. Now Man C and Chelsea have their infrastructure costs (new ground, new training facilities, new youth set up etc) paid for by their sponsors, as they are allowed to do, under FFP rules. Arsenal and Man U pay for this themselves, but Man U’s income is always far higher than Arsenal’s because of their worldwide appeal, which dates back to the start of the 1960s.\n\nThus Arsenal are out on a limb. The club needs a big money owner to take over the costs that are outside FFP, while continuing the Wenger approach of finding great youngsters and bringing them through. Indeed it could be argued that the club has only survived against the other three regular trophy winners because of the youth programme. Players such as Ramsey, Iwobi, Bellerin, Holding, Wilshere, Walcott, Coquelin… all these came through for little or no money because they were bought early. And there are Maitland Niles, Nelson, Willock, Bielik, Nketiah and McGuane coming through now. It’s a hell of a good approach.\n\nBut my fear is that after Wenger we might get a manager who doesn’t have that talent at finding young players, and we still won’t be able to compete in the transfer market.\n\nWhich means the only protest worthwhile now is against the owner, not the manager. Quite how we do that however, is another matter, and maybe I’ll tackle that another day.\n\nRecent Posts"
