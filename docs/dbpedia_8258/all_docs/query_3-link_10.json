        "text": "Today marks exactly ten years to the day since Arsenal stunned Barcelona in the first-leg of their UEFA Champions League last-16 tie at the Emirates Stadium, winning 2-1.\n\nHaving successfully navigated their way through the knockout stages, the Gunners were handed one of the sternest tests they could have wished for, locking horns with the Spanish giants.\n\nThe first-leg was penciled in to take place at the Emirates Stadium whilst the second-leg was to take place at the Nou Camp a few weeks later. Arsenal ensured they took an advantage to Spain for the return leg after coming from behind to run out 2-1 winners in north London.\n\nDavid Villa opened the scoring for the La Liga side before Arsenal scored twice inside the final 12 minutes to secure a famous win, with Dutchman Robin van Persie and Andrey Arshavin bagging the goals.\n\nUnfortunately for Arsene Wenger's men, Barcelona proved to be too strong in the second-leg, winning 3-1 on the night and 4-3 on aggregate, despite Sergio Busquests netting an own-goal.\n\nTen years on from one of the most famous nights the Emirates Stadium has ever witnessed, football.london has taken a look back on the starting XI that played that evening and what they are up to now.\n\nGK: Wojciech Szczesny\n\nThe victory over Barcelona marked Szczesny's debut in the Champions League, ensuring he had a debut in the competition that he was never likely to ever forget. He had played second fiddle to Manuel Almunia during the first half of the season in the battle to be the Gunners' No.1 goalkeeper before bagging his place in the team in mid-January.\n\nThe Poland international spent another six years on the Gunners' books before joining Italian giants Juventus in 2017. Although he has had to be patient to install himself as the Serie A giants' first choice goalkeeper, he now leads that battle ahead of Italian icon Gianluigi Buffon.\n\nDuring his time with the Italian heavyweights, the 30-year-old has won a total of six trophies, as well as being crowned Serie A's best goalkeeper for the 2019/20 campaign.\n\nRB: Emmanuel Eboue\n\nRight-back Eboue frequently battled it out with Bacary Sagna for the right-back berth during the 2010/11 season, with the latter often preferred by Wenger. However, Sagna, who was last on the books of Montreal Impact, did not feature, paving the way for Eboue to start in defence.\n\nDespite playing a key role in contributing to the win, Eboue was dropped to the bench for the return leg in Spain, with Sagna taking the right-back spot. Eboue only remained at Arsenal for a few more months before joining Turkish side Galatasaray in August 2011.\n\nHe spent four years with the Turkish club before returning to England in 2016, joining Sunderland on a short-term deal. However, less than a month after joining the club he was slapped with a one-year ban from football-related activities, for failing to pay a former agent. The defender never secured another club and retired from playing. He was offered a coaching role at Galatasaray's Under-14s back in December 2017.\n\nCB: Laurent Koscielny\n\nFrenchman Koscielny spent nine years at the Emirates Stadium and was the most recent player of the starting line-up that faced Barcelona ten years ago to leave.\n\nHe joined Bordeaux at the end of the 2018/19 season and has been a regular for the Ligue 1 side ever since. Now at the age of 35, the defender is still going strong and a regular for the French club.\n\nHis time at Arsenal saw him help the club win five trophies as well as helping them reach the 2018/19 UEFA Europa League final.\n\nCB: Johan Djourou\n\nCentre-back Djourou joined Arsenal all the way back in 2004 and had discovered first hand what it was like to be within a club that had suffered the pain of losing a Champions League final to Barcelona back in 2006. However, the defender was in the starting line-up for the Gunners' one and only victory over the Spanish giants ten years ago, starting at centre-back alongside Koscielny.\n\nThe Swiss left Arsenal in 2014, joining Hamburg on a permanent deal after a successful loan spell with the German side. Since then, Djourou has had a further five clubs, including Antalyaspor and Sion. He is now on the books of Danish club FC Nordsjaelland, who he signed for back in October on a two-year deal.\n\nHe was close to returning to England back in 2017 as Championship side Sheffield Wednesday expressed an interest in securing his signature.\n\nLB: Gael Clichy\n\nAnother player that was part of the Arsenal side that was victorious ten years ago today is left-back Clichy. The Frenchman, who arrived at Arsenal all the way back in 2003, is currently on the books of Swiss club Servette after signing for them in December.\n\nFor Clichy to have been part of the side that defeated Barcelona will have meant everything to him as he was dealt the blow of being ruled out of the 2006 Champions League final with a foot injury, meaning the chance to have played against Barcelona and help the Gunners seal a famous win will have meant everything to him, especially when he claimed an assist.\n\nThe left-back left Arsenal in 2011 to join Manchester City, as the Frenchman spent six years on the books of the Etihad Stadium club.\n\nCM: Alex Song\n\nJust over a year-and-a-half after helping Arsenal get the better of Barcelona, Song made the switch to the Spanish giants in August 2012, signing for the La Liga club on a five-year deal in a £15million move.\n\nSong had spent seven years with the Gunners, including his initial loan spell from Bastia. The Cameroon international had played a key role in helping Wenger's side topple Barcelona, with his strength and aggression proving vital in the engine room, allowing the likes of Cesc Fabregas and Jack Wilshere to show their class when going forward.\n\nSong is still playing, now on the books of Arta Solar 7, who are located in the Republic of Djibouti. Song did return to England after his time at Arsenal, joining West Ham United on loan for two seasons in succession.\n\nCM: Cesc Fabregas\n\nAt the time when Arsenal toppled Barcelona, Fabregas was blossoming into one of the very best central-midfielders on the planet. He was in the form of his life, consistently striking fear into the veins of opposing defenders with his ability to score and create goals.\n\nHe showed his class and composure in the win against Barcelona, too, playing a key role in keeping the midfield ticking and instigating attacks. His performance certainly caught the Spanish club's eye as they launched a move to sign him in the summer of 2011, ensuring he returned to his former routes.\n\nFabregas spent three years with Barcelona before returning to England to join Chelsea in 2014. He spent five years with the Blues before joining AS Monaco in 2019. He continues to apply his trade for the Ligue 1 side to this day.\n\nCM: Jack Wilshere\n\nWhilst the win over Barcelona will always be remembered by Arsenal supporters for the magnitude of the victory, it was also a night when Wilshere announced himself to the world. The Englishman produced a stunning display in the centre of the park to leave the likes of Andres Iniesta and Xavi chasing shadows.\n\nWilshere was only 19-years-old at the time and his performance was nothing short of outstanding, leaving Gunners fans purring at the potential he had within his armoury. However, although he showed flashes of his brilliance, injuries dictated the midfielder's Arsenal career before he left the club in 2018.\n\nAfter a disappointing spell at West Ham United, Wilshere recently joined AFC Bournemouth and has had an encouraging start to his second spell with the Cherries, scoring two goals and claiming one assist in his first five appearances.\n\nRW: Theo Walcott\n\nIn the build-up to Barcelona's visit to the Emirates Stadium ten years ago this evening, Lionel Messi admitted that he feared the threat of Walcott more than any other Arsenal player.\n\n\"I can only speak from experience but he was one of the most dangerous players I have ever played against,\" Messi told the Daily Telegraph on the eve of the contest. \"Barcelona players are not scared easily but I can tell you that when we played Arsenal last season he truly worried us.\"\n\nWalcott did not fail to disappoint, with his pace proving troublesome until he was substituted on 77 minutes and replaced by Nicklas Bendtner. Now at the age of 31, Walcott left Arsenal in 2018 to join Everton. He now finds himself on loan at Southampton, the club he started his career with all those years ago.\n\nST: Robin van Persie\n\nDutchman Van Persie was one of the heroes of the night against Barcelona, scoring the Gunners' equaliser to cancel out Villa's opener, sparking memorable scenes inside the Emirates Stadium. That was one just one of many goals that the striker scored during his time in north London before joining Manchester United in 2012.\n\nThe striker spent three years on the books of United before making the switch to Fenerbahce in 2015 and then onto Feyenoord in 2018. Arguably one of Arsenal's best players in recent years, the talented Dutchman, who made a living for himself by scoring goals, retiring in 2019.\n\nIn May 2020, a year after his retirement, Van Persie became an assistant-coach to Dick Advocaat at Feyenoord.\n\nLW: Samir Nasri\n\nFrench winger Nasri rounded off Wenger's starting line-up against Barcelona, starting on the left and handing support to Van Persie from the left. The winger, who scored 15 goals during the 2010/11 season, secured the assist for Arshavin's winner, sealing his place in Gunners folklore.\n\nAfter three years with Arsenal, Nasri left the club ahead of the start of the 2011/12 season, joining Manchester City. He spent six years with City, winning four trophies during that time, ahead of joining Antalyaspor in 2017. He did return to England joining West Ham United in 2019, but left at the end of the season.\n\nHe joined Anderlecht in July 2019 but currently finds himself without a club after leaving last year.\n\nSubstitutes\n\nNicklas Bendtner\n\nAlthough Bendtner's Arsenal career never produced all that many memorable moments, he still continues to be one of the most talked about players to have ever donned a Gunners shirt. He did spend nine years on the books of the Gunners, which did feature three separate loan spells away from north London.\n\nHe left in 2014 to join German club Wolfsburg and spent two years with the Bundesliga side. He sealed a sensational return to England in 2017, signing for Nottingham Forest on a two-year deal. However, he failed to see out the duration of that contract and joined Rosenborg. He now applies his trade for Tarnby FF in his native Denmark.\n\nAndrey Arshavin\n\nThe hero of the night, Arshavin stepped off the bench on 68 minutes to replace Song and lashed home the winner seven minutes from time, securing the Gunners one of their most famous results in recent times.\n\nThe Russian had already been on the Gunners' books for just over two years by the time he netted netted that goal and would leave the Emirates Stadium in 2013, returning to Zenit St Petersburg. He went onto have spells with Kuban Krasnodar and Kairat before retiring in December 2018."
