        "text": "Arsenal youngster Ethan Nwaneri has grown in stature in recent months, and has impressed in his side’s pre-season friendlies so far.\n\nThe 17-year-old is the biggest talent within the Hale End Academy, and will hope to gain a more prominent first-team role this season following the departure of Emile Smith Rowe.\n\nNwaneri is a rising star, and he is now the same age as Cesc Fabregas was when the Spaniard forced his way into the Arsenal team the season after they won the Premier League undefeated.\n\nIf Nwaneri is given opportunities in Arsenal’s final two pre-season friendlies, as they take on Bayer Leverkusen and Lyon in the Emirates Cup, then game time in the opening league game against Wolves cannot be ruled out.\n\nHowever, Nwaneri will need to follow the path laid out for him by one of the coaches that helped mould him, former Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere.\n\nJack Wilshere broke into Arsenal team after Emirates Cup masterclass\n\nJack Wilshere was one of the best talents the Hale End Academy has ever produced, and he enjoyed a stunning breakthrough into the Arsenal team.\n\nDespite competing with Fabregas, Alex Song, Tomas Rosicky, Samir Nasri, Abou Diaby and Aaron Ramsey for a midfield role, Wilshere forced his way into the side as a teenager.\n\nMORE ARSENAL STORIES\n\nThe start of the 2010-11 season saw Arsenal have to deal with uncertainty over the future of Fabregas, who was courted by Barcelona after he won the World Cup with Spain.\n\nThis meant that there was an opening in midfield, and Wilshere used the Emirates Cup to show Arsene Wenger that this should be reserved for him.\n\nArsenal faced Celtic in the 2010 Emirates Cup, and Wilshere put on a masterclass as he was named the player of the match in a 3-2 victory, with The Guardian describing his performance as “magnificent.”\n\n“The hope came in the shape of Jack Wilshere, who built on his encouraging display in the 1-1 draw with Milan yesterday with a man-of-the-match performance. During the first-half in particular, the 18-year-old was magnificent, showing a level of control and composure that defied belief given his youth. At times, Celtic’s own midfielders could not get near the teenager as he glided through them,” they stated of him.\n\nThis handed Wilshere a starting spot for Arsenal’s season opener away at Liverpool, with Rosicky and Song on the bench, and Nwaneri has a lesson to learn here.\n\nEmirates Cup masterclass could earn Ethan Nwaneri Arsenal starting spot\n\nArsenal begin their campaign at home to Wolves, and with Declan Rice returning later from the Euros after reaching the final with England, Nwaneri may have a small chance of usurping him for the first game.\n\nRice is considered undroppable by Mikel Arteta, but given his lack of pre-season minutes, he may be eased in after what was a long campaign last season."
