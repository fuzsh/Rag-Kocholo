        "text": "Sunderland AFC\n\nSunderland AFC has been a member of the Football League since 1890. They have won the league six times and the FA Cup two times. They have also been runners-up in the Football League Cup a final once. The club is also known under a few nicknames, The Black Cats are one of them.\n\nHistory\n\nSunderland was established in 1879. The “AFC” stands for Association Football Club.\n\nTogether with Preston and Aston Villa, Sunderland was among the dominant football clubs in England during the 1890s, winning the First Division in 1891â92, 1892â93 and 1894â95.\n\n1891â92 Football League table Club Points 1 Sunderland 42 2 Preston North End 37 3 Bolton 36 4 Aston Villa 30 5 Everton 28 6 Wolverhampton 26 7 Burnley 26 8 Notts County 26 9 Blackburn Rovers 26 10 Derby 16 11 Accrington 20 12 Derby 18 13 West Bromwich 14 14 Darwen 11\n\nFourteen teems was novelty, to the fourth edition, the Football League had expanded with two extra teams. The top goalscorer during the season was John Campbell, a Scot who played for Sunderland until 1897.\n\nBoth teams were reinforced by imported Scottish players and they also played a passing game which for the time was typical Scottish opposed to the dribbling game that otherwise was an English trademark.\n\nSunderland was, however, not as successful in the FA Cup, in which the participate for the first time in 1884-1885 season. After being the runners-up in 1923 they finally claim its first title in 1937.\n\nThe Roker Park stadium served Sunderland AFC for almost a century and had a 75,118 record attendance from a FA Cup match in 1933. But after the all-seater rule made by Football Association in the 1990s, the capacity was decreased to 22,500. The construction of Stadium of Light solved the problem with a capacity beyond 40,000 when it opened in 1997 (the capacity expanded already the next year to 49,000).\n\nBy Oscar Anderson"
