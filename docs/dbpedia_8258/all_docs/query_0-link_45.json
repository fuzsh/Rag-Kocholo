Per club policy, terms of the contract were not disclosed.\n\nTayou, an accomplished professional indoor soccer player, most recently spent time with the Soles de Sonora of the Major Arena Soccer League (MASL). Tayou was named the 2015-16 MASL MVP after leading the league with 47 goals while recording 15 assists in 20 games. He led the Soles to the 2016 championship game where they narrowly fell to the Baltimore Blast. The 6-2 forward has spent time with other professional indoor teams including the Las Vegas Legends and the Tulsa Revolution, while also playing on outdoor PDL sides Real Maryland and the Las Vegas Mobsters.\n\n“Franck joins us after a good season of indoor soccer,” said SAFC Head Coach Darren Powell. “He has really impressed the staff with his attitude and ability in front of goal. We look forward to having him with San Antonio FC.”\n\nOriginally from Cameroon before moving to Las Vegas with his family during childhood, Tayou recently earned his first two caps with the U.S. Futsal National Team, playing a two-legged tie against Canada in CONCACAF Futsal Championship qualifying. Tayou attended West Virginia University where he played soccer from 2010-11, leading the Mountaineers to the NCAA tournament in both seasons. Tayou led West Virginia in goals in 2010 and recorded nine in his Mountaineer career.\n\nSan Antonio FC will host Colorado Springs Switchbacks FC on Saturday, June 18 at 7:30 p.m. at Toyota Field. The match marks the second regular season meeting between the two clubs. Tickets to the match can be purchased at www.sanantoniofc.com or by calling 210-444-5MLS.\n\nSupporters can follow the club by liking San Antonio FC on Facebook, as well as following the team on Twitter (@SanAntonioFC), Instagram (@sanantoniofc) and Snapchat (@SanAntonioFC).\n\nSan Antonio FC has signed forward Franck Tayou for the 2016 USL season, the club announced today.

He pulled into Toyota Field a few hours early, and dozens of tailgaters had already beaten him to the parking lot.\n\nBy game time, almost 1,000 fans had come through the tailgate, working on their fan fitness with burgers and chant practice.\n\n“The fans have shown with the turnout alone that this is a soccer city,” Johnson said. “I’ve been around other fans in MLS cities and I can say that here in San Antonio, our support is next-level.”\n\nNext level is where SAFC hopes to be, and the team will get its first taste of the MLS on Wednesday. SAFC will travel to face the MLS’ Houston Dynamo in the fourth round of the U.S. Open Cup.\n\nJohnson, a former Dynamo forward, said San Antonio could be on the same level as MLS franchises in Houston and Dallas sooner than later.\n\n“Everything’s there,” he said. “There’s a great organization in (Spurs Sports & Entertainment), a city that’s ready for soccer, and the fans have been incredible. I like Section 118 so much; I’d love to give them a huge shoutout. Theirs and all of our fans’ support for all 90 minutes has been excellent.”\n\nMore than 33,000 fans have attended SAFC matches this season, putting the team third in USL attendance and helping the league set early attendance records for this season. The home opener was sold out with an attendance of 8,466, and the second match against Tulsa nearly sold out with 7,837, just short of the official capacity of 8,000 even though the Spurs were in a playoff game at the same time. SAFC’s average home attendance of 6,601 is behind FC Cincinnati and Sacramento Republic FC, but both teams also have larger capacity stadiums.\n\nAaron Marvel has seen the rise of San Antonio’s soccer support on social media as the man behind the Twitter account @MLSinSA. The account currently has 2,500 followers, gaining about 1,500 of them since it was announced that SAFC would be a USL expansion team in December 2015.\n\n“We’re in the upper echelon in USL attendance, and San Antonio has drawn huge crowds for big-time international matches, too,” Marvel said. “We have a great stadium, great ownership and whenever you see what MLS is looking for, San Antonio checks every box every time.”\n\nMarvel pointed to the popularity and success of MLS teams Orlando City SC, Portland Timbers and Real Salt Lake, all cities that previously had NBA teams as their only major league sports before the MLS came to town.\n\n“Mayor Ivy Taylor’s account has tweeted at us, and so have a lot of councilmen,” Marvel said. “Interest is going to be as strong as we can make it when the MLS gets to San Antonio.”\n\nSAFC has another chance to grow interest in the club on Wednesday with a strong showing against an MLS side. Coach Darren Powell said a good result could “put us on the map in year one.”\n\nAnother stride forward has been the launch of SAFC Pro Academy, a youth development program headed by San Antonio FC assistant coach Nick Evans.\n\n“Understand we’re a new club that’s setting a new culture, one that we want to make San Antonio very proud of,” Powell said. “We have a growth mindset. Not everything’s going to be perfect in year one, and we always have to keep a long-term vision in mind, but it’s a process that we have to do step-by-step.”\n\nThe long-term vision is one that attracted players to San Antonio and to the staff in place when Powell and managing director Tim Holt assembled the SAFC roster in January.\n\n“This city has everything,” said Carlos Alvarez, the first player signed to SAFC. “Fans are hungry for another major league team, and that was part of the draw to come to San Antonio. We’re on the right path, the right direction and we have the city behind our backs. You can see how big San Antonio could be for the MLS.”\n\nAnother step in that direction could take place on Wednesday.\n\nA few hours before San Antonio FC played its first home game, forward Jason Johnson said he knew the city was MLS ready. He pulled into Toyota Field a few hours early, and dozens of tailgaters had already beaten him to the parking lot.\n\nBy game time, almost 1,000 fans had come through the tailgate, working on their fan fitness with burgers and chant practice.\n\n“The fans have shown with the turnout alone that this is a soccer city,” Johnson said. “I’ve been around other fans in MLS cities and I can say that here in San Antonio, our support is next-level.”\n\nNext level is where SAFC hopes to be, and the team will get its first taste of the MLS on Wednesday. SAFC will travel to face the MLS’ Houston Dynamo in the fourth round of the U.S. Open Cup.\n\nJohnson, a former Dynamo forward, said San Antonio could be on the same level as MLS franchises in Houston and Dallas sooner than later.\n\n“Everything’s there,” he said. “There’s a great organization in (Spurs Sports & Entertainment), a city that’s ready for soccer, and the fans have been incredible. I like Section 118 so much; I’d love to give them a huge shoutout. Theirs and all of our fans’ support for all 90 minutes has been excellent.”\n\nMore than 33,000 fans have attended SAFC matches this season, putting the team third in USL attendance and helping the league set early attendance records for this season. The home opener was sold out with an attendance of 8,466, and the second match against Tulsa nearly sold out with 7,837, just short of the official capacity of 8,000 even though the Spurs were in a playoff game at the same time. SAFC’s average home attendance of 6,601 is behind FC Cincinnati and Sacramento Republic FC, but both teams also have larger capacity stadiums.\n\nAaron Marvel has seen the rise of San Antonio’s soccer support on social media as the man behind the Twitter account @MLSinSA.

The historic match for the Alamo City club will be the first time the two Texas clubs meet and the first SAFC competitive match against an MLS side.\n\nSan Antonio will head into the match after earning a point on the road against Portland Timbers 2 in USL action thanks to a late goal from defender Milton Palacios. The goal was the first in league play for SAFC since May 15, and marked the sixth goal scored by the club in the last 15 minutes of a USL match this season. The draw was impressive for San Antonio who were facing a Portland team with eight of their starting 11 being under contract with the Timbers (MLS).\n\nThe Dynamo have not played a match since they faced FC Dallas on June 2 in league play, where the team secured a draw away from home. The club will face San Antonio without leading-scorer Giles Barnes, who represented Jamaica in the Copa America Centenario.\n\nThe match will be Houston’s first in the U.S. Open Cup this year. San Antonio FC progressed to the fourth round after beating Corinthians FC SA (NPSL) 3-1 in the second round, and the Des Moines Menace (PDL) 2-1 in the third round.\n\nSAFC forward Jacques Francois leads the team in Open Cup play with three goals and one assist.
