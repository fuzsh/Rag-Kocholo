        "text": "All information is complete to and including England's last match, the thirteenth of the 2009-10 season, against Germany on 27 June 2010.\n\nDiary\n\nThursday, 27 May 2010 - England's first international of the 2010-11 season will be against Hungary at Wembley on 11 August, the FA have announced.\n\nSaturday, 7 August 2010 - Fabio Capello has named the uncapped trio of Jack Wilshere, Kieran Gibbs and Bobby Zamora in his squad to face Hungary on Wednesday. Goalkeepers Paul Robinson and Ben Foster replace David James and Robert Green as just 10 of the 23-man World Cup squad return for the friendly. Theo Walcott and Adam Johnson are both recalled but Joe Cole misses out. Strikers Jermain Defoe and Peter Crouch are dropped as Carlton Cole and Darren Bent come in for the match at Wembley. Manchester United's Wes Brown, Phil Jagielka oferton and Bolton's Gary Cahill come in to bolster the defensive ranks as Capello looks to freshen up the national set-up following a disastrous World Cup campaign which saw England crash out in the last 16. Arsenal midfielder Wilshere will become the 10th youngest England international of all time if he plays some part against Hungary. Wilshere became Arsenal's youngest league debutant two seasons ago and was only the fifth 16-year-old to feature in the Champions League.\n\nSunday, 8 August 2010 - In one of the most bizarre days in the England national team history, both Paul Robinson and Wes Brown have pulled out of the England squad for Wednesday's friendly with Hungary and have both retired from international football."
