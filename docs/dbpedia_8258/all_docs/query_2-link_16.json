        "text": "Arsenal will have the chance to gain revenge over Barcelona after the draw for the last 16 of the European Cup paired the two together.\n\nArsène Wenger's side were beaten 6-3 on aggregate in the quarter-final last season, with Lionel Messi scoring four in the second leg as Barça won 4-1 at Camp Nou.\n\nThe Gunners were also beaten 2-1 by the Catalans in the 2006 final in Paris, and have never beaten the Spanish side in a competitive game, although they have scored against them on all five occasions they have met in the Champions League.\n\nHowever the Barcelona manager, Pep Guardiola, believes that Arsenal are still one of the top sides in Europe.\n\n\"Arsenal are a classic of English football. They have been playing good for football for years now,\" said Guardiola. \"I think they will be stronger than they were last season with [Samir] Nasri now fully established in the team, plus the signing of [Marouane] Chamakh. Also there's a difference this time: Cesc [Fábregas] will be on the pitch.\"\n\nHe added: \"Arsenal frighten me, but that is true of all the clubs in the draw. I see difficulties in all of them. I will be a little calmer when I start to watch their games, if I can see any weaknesses.\"\n\nWenger had predicted yesterday that the two sides would be drawn together. \"I know who we will get,\" the Frenchman joked. \"At this level, you need connections.\"\n\nArsenal have only won two of their 12 competitive trips to Spain, at Celta Vigo and Real Madrid, losing seven and drawing three.\n\nTottenham were also handed a tough draw, against the Serie A leaders Milan, the team they defeated in the semi-final of the 1972 Uefa Cup. \"It will be a great game. I would have taken AC Milan before the draw,\" the Spurs manager Harry Redknapp claimed. \"They are leading the league in Italy but it has the makings of a great game over two legs. I'm looking forward to it.\n\n\"It is not the worst draw for me. A tough draw but it will be a great game. That's what you want. Great games.\"\n\nMilan's coach Massimiliano Allegri said that Spurs were \"in theory\" one of the easier draws for the Italians. \"Tottenham is probably a very good team but among the possible rivals we could have faced, they are in theory one of the less difficult sides. But all the sides that have made it to the knockout round are nevertheless strong teams.\"\n\nManchester United will take on Marseille and Chelsea will meet arguably the weakest side left in the competition, the Danish champions FC Copenhagen.\n\n\"Everyone thought we might get one of the Milan sides because we've faced them quite a few times in the last few years, but we got Marseille in the draw rehearsal and it proved right,\" said a satisfied Sir Alex Ferguson. \"Marseille are a handful at their own ground, their fantastic atmosphere and incredible support guarantees that. They've had a good change in fortunes in the last two or three years, after a dry spell, and think it'll be a difficult tie.\"\n\nAlthough United haven't faced Marseille for more than a decade, there are some familiar faces in the opposition camp.\n\n\"[Former Chelsea midfielder] Didier Deschamps is the coach there,\" said Ferguson. \"And they've got one of our old players in Gabriel Heinze, so it'll be nice to see him.\"\n\nChelsea's chief executive Ron Gourlay claimed there would be no complacency against Copenhagen. \"There's no easy games at this stage and we'll be very careful,\" he said. \"They've played 10 games so far in the Champions league with qualifying, and were second to Barcelona, so they're a very, very good side and well clear in their domestic league.\"\n\nGourlay insisted that Chelsea are improving despite their recent run of one win in seven games. He told the club's website: \"Last week the signs were there that we are picking up again and we've got some of our key players back, which is very important to us and we're looking forward to the game [against Manchester United] on Sunday.\n\n\"Things had been going very well, confidence was high and then we lost three or four of our key players and hit some bad results. This game has probably come at the right time for us. The guys will be looking forward to it, the fans will be looking forward to it and it's a good game to get ourselves back on the rails.\"\n\nFull draw\n\nRoma v Shakhtar Donetsk\n\nMilan v Tottenham\n\nValencia v Schalke\n\nInternzionale v Bayern Munich\n\nLyon v Real Madrid\n\nArsenal v Barcelona\n\nMarseille v Manchester United\n\nFC Copenhagen v Chelsea\n\nThe first legs will be played on February 15/16/22/23 with the second legs on March 8/9/15/16."
