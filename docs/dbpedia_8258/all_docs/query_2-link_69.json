        "text": "Group A: Inter Milan, Werder Bremen, Tottenham, FC Twente.\n\nGroup B: Lyon, Benfica, Schalke, Hapoel Tel-Aviv.\n\nGroup C: Manchester United,Valencia, Rangers, Bursaspor.\n\nGroup D: Barcelona, Panathinaikos, FC Copenhagen, Rubin Kazan.\n\nGroup E: Bayern Munich, Roma, FC Basle, Cluj.\n\nGroup F: Chelsea, Marseille, Spartak Moscow, MSK Zilina.\n\nGroup G: AC Milan, Real Madrid, Ajax, Auxerre.\n\nGroup H: Arsenal, Shakhtar Donetsk, FC Braga, FK Partizan.\n\nIt might appear a nightmare to some but Peter Crouch’s dream of meeting Inter Milan in the Champions League this season came true on Thursday. On the day that Inter’s Julio Cesar, Maicon, Wesley Sneijder and Diego Milito were named as the top four players in European club football, Crouch was granted his wish.\n\nA tie with the European champions also gives Crouch an opportunity to prove a point to Rafa Benítez.\n\nCrouch, whose hat-trick swept Spurs into the group stage, endured a horrendous start to his time under Benítez at Liverpool, taking 1,229 minutes to register his first goal (and even that was first referred to the Dubious Goals Panel). Despite spending £7 million on the forward in 2005, Benítez never seemed completely convinced by Crouch.\n\nThe nadir came when the Spaniard waited until 12 minutes from the end of the 2007 Champions League final to bring Crouch on. Liverpool were losing 1-0 to AC Milan and Benítez’s tardiness surprised many.\n\nCrouch’s desire to meet Inter will be fulfilled in the San Siro on Oct 20. If Robbie Keane remains at White Hart Lane, he also will look forward to taking on Benítez, who bought and sold him quickly at Anfield.\n\nCrouch and company must hit the ground running as their first date is Sept 14 against Werder Bremen, who have the class and confidence to trouble Tottenham. “We are ninth in the Uefa rankings so why shouldn’t we beat Spurs?’’ said Klaus Allofs, Werder’s general manager. “Is it a difficult group? Only for the others.’’\n\nAs well as Inter and Werder, Spurs must tackle FC Twente, not the most arduous of assignments but still a test. Apart from Spurs’ tough group, the draw largely smiled on the Premier League.\n\nManchester United should negotiate Group C including a Valencia side weakened by the departure of David Villa and David Silva. United also have a trip to Turkey, this time to Bursaspor, which will be no magic carpet ride. Rangers will be a physical scrap and an opportunity for auld acquaintance to be rekindled.\n\nSmith was Ferguson’s No 2 when United won the FA Cup in 2004. “We are in touch with each other all the time,’’ Smith said. “We go back a long way and obviously I worked for him at United for a short while. To go in against Sir Alex in my last season in charge is something I will relish on a personal level. Look at the pedigree United have in this competition.\n\n“It’s always going to be a massive challenge against them but it’s special to take my team Rangers there. I’ve done it with Everton but to go there on a Champions League night will be really nice, at least I hope it will be nice.\n\n“We had the 'Battle of Britain’ when we played Leeds all those years ago [1992] and we put them out but back in those days it was more of a level playing field. Financially now there is such a big gulf between Scotland and England that it’s different circumstances. All we want to do is go and give a good account of ourselves against United.’’\n\nUnited should progress from what looks a negotiable group. “You cannot complain about that,’’ Ferguson added. “It’s a good draw for us. You always look at the travelling side of it. The only one of any great distance is the trip to Turkey.’’\n\nChelsea will also be fancied to reach the knock-out stage. Their Group F games with Marseille will tug on some heart-strings. Didier Drogba’s career really accelerated at the Stade Velodrome, his name becoming familiar to English audiences with his terrorising of Newcastle United in the Uefa Cup. Marseille’s coach, Didier Deschamps, had a spell at the Bridge.\n\nSpartak Moscow offer Drogba and John Terry a shot at redemption. On visiting the Luzhniki on Oct 19, Chelsea will probably encounter locals who know the whereabouts of Drogba’s marbles, which he lost during the 2008 Champions league final, and Terry’s penalty, last seen heading to the Urals. The Slovakian minnows of Zilina, whose ground holds only 11,000, make up Group F."
