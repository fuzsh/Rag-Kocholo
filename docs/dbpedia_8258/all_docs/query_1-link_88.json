        "text": "FA Cup\n\nThe FA Cup (Football Association Challenge Cup) is the oldest existing football competition. It is the oldest among all tournaments as well as all leagues that still exist today. The first edition was played in the 1871-1872 season and the FA Cup has been held once a year since then (with exception for interruptions during the first and the second World War). In the beginning, the FA Cup also included Scottish and Welsh clubs. A Welsh club, Cardiff City won the Cup in 1927. No Scottish clubs have won the tournament with Queen's Park, reaching the final twice, nearest a victory. The competition should not be confused with semi-professional competition FA Trophy.\n\nWinners and runners-up\n\nAll the winners and runners-up trough the years of the FA Cup.\n\nSeason Winner

teams would refrain by the cause of travelling costs). The first FA Cup matches ever, four on the same day, were played on 11 November 1871. The first final was played the following spring at the Kennington Oval, in which Wanderers defeated Royal Engineers 1-0.\n\nWanderers would also win the following edition, but they were helped in the second season by the rule that stipulated that the current champions were directly qualified for the final (the rule was abandoned after that tournament).\n\nMore and more teams participated every year â over 40 teams entered the competition in 1877 and over 50 in 1879. The 1879-1880 edition also involved several clubs known by the modern audience, such as Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers and Nottingham Forest. In the 1883-1884 season, the tournament reached 100 registered teams. By this time, the professional era began and the amateur teams would soon be outpaced. A shift that would lead to the creation of the FA Amateur Cup in 1893.\n\nThe FA Cup was once upon a time the biggest sport event in the world. The final that was played at Crystal Palace in 1913 gathered 121,000 people. The attendance was a world record. In these days the stadiums were not build to hold that amount of people; therefore, many stood in rows at the field between the stands with bad overview of the action.\n\nIn 1923, when the final was played at Wembley for the first time, the attendance was even bigger. There is no official figure, but it has been estimated to around 200,000!\n\nCountries\n\nThe competition has been dominated by English teams, but other British countries have been represented as well. The Scottish Queen's Park was playing in the first editions and Rangers reached the semi-finals in 1886-1887. A few other Scottish sides has been part of the competition through its history.\n\nSeveral teams from Wales have been part of the FA Cup, including Cardiff City who became the first Welch side to win the tournament in 1927. Another Welch team that have performed great in the FA Cup is Swansea City.\n\nA few teams from Northern Ireland also participated in the 19th century. Among these, Cliftonville performed best by reaching the third round once.\n\nVenue for the final\n\nThe FA Cup final is for many football fans associated with Wembley Stadium. This is an old tradition: Wembley has been the venue for the final since 1924 (with exceptions for interruption between 2001 and 2006 when the stadium was renovated and Millenium Stadium served as venue for the final). Before Wembley came to be the choice for the final, Crystal Palace was for many years (1895-1914) the venue for the final. And before that it was Kennington Oval (with one exception in 1873 when the final took place at Lillie Bridge).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStatistics\n\nTeams with most titles\n\nA list of clubs that have won the FA Cup most times, concerning the period 1872-2023.\n\nTable 2.
