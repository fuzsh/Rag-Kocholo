Abstract The Construction industry of India is an important indicator of the development as it creates investment opportunities across various related sectors. The construction industry has contributed an estimated ₹ 6708 billion to the national GDP in 2011-12 (a share of around 9%). The industry is fragmented, with a handful of major companies involved in the construction activities across all segments; medium-sized companies specializing in niche activities; and small and medium contractors who work on the subcontractor basis and carry out the work in the field. In 2011, there were slightly over 500 construction equipment manufacturing companies in all of India. Being the capital city of India, it doesnot come asashock that NewDelhi is the most populated city in India in term of people and vehicles. The population of Delhi and vehicles onroadare ever increasing leading to problems like traffic, pollution and high fuel consumption .Considering all this ―THE DELHI METRO‖ comes as a huge relief for the people of Delhi.There are no doubts about the social benefits of the Delhi metro. It will help in reducing traffic and pollution in the capital and more important save alot of time for the daily commuters. Myproject is based onthe advantage and disadvantage ofmetro and also on the analysis ofconstruction knowledge which I got from the site.\n\n7. INDEX Contents 1.

MANAGEMENT OF SAMSUNG: 1.3 Requirement of metro infrastructure in urban area:  Urban India today, faces serious challenges of growth and its management. Across geographic, issues of urbanization manifests in the form of overcrowding,\n\n20. congestion, insufficient infrastructure, inadequate service provisioning – mainly transport, environmental degradation and pollution etc.    Infrastructure facility in the city is directly depends on the resources available to develop the infrastructure facilities.    Growing cities, growing population and growing traffic has invariably called for a shift from private modes of transport to public mode of transport.    Use of metro rail will result in prevention emission of green house gases.    Averts the accidents.    It runs on electricity so it will reduce the pollution.    Use of metro rail will result in saving fuel cost, vehicle cost etc. Save time:  International standard for metro rail with maximum speed of 80kmph and minimum 35kmph will helps in saving time.  Provide comfort:   Modern service like automatic ticket system, ultra modern coaches, security system (ATM, food, cafe)  1.3.1 Suitability of Elevatedmetro rail: Newly developing areas where city having wide roads, elevated corridors can be the choice: It would take up some of the width of the road. Advantages:  Elevated metro rail follows the existing road network, it will helps to increase conveniences of people to transport one to other place.    Disadvantages:    Elevated metro structure affects the visual character of the city.    Elevated construction needs to follows the existing road network, space etc.    Interchange between two elevated lines is much more difficult. \n\n21.   The Elevated areas may encroach some private properties. Elevated station close to the residential properties may become difficult to stay to the people. It may result into property value going down.    The Elevated corridors may face major delays and cost increases due to land acquisition issues (Physical relocation of residents and other properties)  1.3.2 Suitability of Underground metro rail: Underground corridors are adopted in the areas where there are interchanges of different metro lines and the alignment is passing through the populated area. Advantages:  Underground metro structure not affects the visual character of the city.    There are no needs to follow the existing road network, space etc.    Interchange between two Underground metro lines will be comparatively easy.  Disadvantages:  Underground construction will be 2.5 to 3 times more expensive than elevated.   Underground metro construction cost increase due to ventilation, lighting, air- conditioning, escalator system, fire safety system, maintenance etc as compare to elevated structure.  Technology and machines used in tunnel are more expensive.  Water table that raises the cost of construction.  Vibration would be a major threat posed to residents, monument etc in case of underground corridors.    The passenger evacuation in case of any emergency becomes a critical issue in case of underground metro. (not suitable for earthquake restricted areas)   1.3.3 Suitability of On gradedmetro rail:   Newly developing area where city have large space. It would take up half of the width of road.  \n\n22.  Advantages:    Require less maintenance.    Cost will reduce because of no need of lifts, stairs, air conditioning, escalator facilities.    Passengers evacuation plan will be more easy    Elevated metro rail follows the existing road network; it will help to increase conveniences of people to transport one to other place.    Interchange between two elevated lines is easier.    Disadvantages:    On grade construction needs to follows the existing road network, space etc.    Interchange between two elevated lines is much more difficult.    The areas may encroach some private properties. Elevated station close to the residential properties may become difficult to stay to the people. It may result into property value going down.    This may face major delays and cost increases due to land acquisition issues (Physical relocation of residents and other properties)   2.

Reinforcement cage lifting for diaphragm wall panel construction Once the bottom of the panel is reached (and cleaned), the reinforcement cage can be lowered into position. The reinforcement cage is typically suspended from the guide wall panels, and must have enough transverse and diagonal reinforcement to permit it to be properly lifted and lowered into place. Sufficient space must be left for at least two or three tremie pipes so that tremieing can take place. Concrete tremieing refers to the process of replacing the supporting slurry with the permanent concrete with the use of vertical pipes called tremies. With the tremies, concreting of a diaphragm wall starts from the bottom and the tremies are lifted progressively as the concrete level rises. During this process the tremies are maintained within the freshly poured concrete for a minimum depth of 2ft or (0.6m). Overpouring might be required to make sure that all slurry is\n\n37. Reinforcement cage of D-wall displaced from the panel by concrete. Poor tremieing can result in slurry pockets getting entraped within the diaphragm wall concrete.  Construction of Plunge column  o Prefabricated in advance. o Welding of plunge column. o Surveying and setting out.

Here they used 4 TBM. TBM 1 and 2 launched from Vikaspuri to Janakpuri. TBM 3 and 4 launched from Janakpuri West to Dashrathpuri. TBM 1 and 2 they used it again from Dashrathpuri to palam. 3.2.2 Cross Over: Generally cross over is provided at the last station of one route. It connects two parallel rail tracks allowing a train on one track to cross over to the other. 3.2.3 Cross passage: Cross passage is a way between two parallel tunnels. The cross passage is fitted out with electrical panels, cabling, fire deluge system which along with providing a safe access between the two tunnels in the event of an emergency. Here in specific project CC-34 it built by the simple excavation and shotcrete (steel\n\n43. and polypropylene fiber) method.  The excavation is immediately protected by a layer of sprayed concrete commonly referred to as shotcrete.    Other support measures used are steel arches, rock bolts, mesh etc. This creates a natural load bearing ring which minimize the deformation of soil. FI  3.2.4 TBM lowering:  Tunnel depth is Secant piles are used at the starting edge of Tunnel.   It is used to transfer lateral, vertical or a combination of both the loads through weak soil layers to a suitable bearing layer. They can be drilled in all types of configuration that can form an interlocking water weight wall.  It is important to install a rail track so that the lowering works can be made faster.   Survey points for TBM location on wall.   From main survey bench mark on site the points are transferred on the wall by total station, based on which TBM level is decided. Points marked as a permanent survey colors.    The main process was basically based on the lowering of TBM parts.   The parts of TBM lowered and then joined it because it’s not possible to lower it directly. o Preparation of base   o Crane assembly   o Transportation of parts o Connection of parts   o Erection frame and rail line work  \n\n44. o Base slab was made leveled and clean.   o Steel plates are laid on the surface.

Area of casting yard: 40018.86 m^2 Production scope: Theoretical Production excluding wastage is about 6234 rings Ring dimension: 2900 mm inner radius 275 mm thickness Width varying from 1380 – 1420 mm\n\n47. 3.3.1 Concrete mix Designforsegments: 3.3.2 PrecastSegments: Precast concrete segments used in tunnel construction in specific project CC-34. Production sequence of precast segments on casting yard: Production process in casting yard: The casting yard is a very important part of project though the construction activities bond to casting yard is totally different than the other construction process. The setup of casting yard is more of factory type production. We can divide the activities of segment production in main four steps.\n\n48. Types of segments: 1. Left hand tapper 2. Right hand tapper Both types of rings have 6 segments: 1 key segment + 5 segments In soft soil strata there will be a problem of wet and damp places where water will be the big issue. So, direct shotcreting is not possible. . There for they have provided rings which directly retain the soil mass and by grouting the joints will become strong.\n\n49.                  segments lifted by erecter of tunnel bore machine     Segment type 1, 6 & 2 have very special importance. The Key segment is inserted at last and while placing this it is assured that sufficient pressure will be generated between segments. \n\n50.   All the segments are joined with the galvanized bolts and black sockets are inserted during casting to make good bond and provide grip to the joint.    The circular dots at intrados are very important. The main reason of providing them is they stop amplification of sound waves by breaking them.    The periphery part of segments are with little shepherded edge and gap is provided between them to avoid collision of edges while placement that stop erection damages.    The marking of each segment will be done with mould number, types of rings, project name, and name of segment type. So that the misunderstanding and misplacements can be avoided.    It is essential to change key segment position in adjacent rings for proper load transfer and for provision of staged joints.    They used 6 pipes: Inlet water, Outlet water, Dewatering, Cement sand water, Silicate, Extra pipe.   Cement and Silicate mix with each other and it will provide strong joint.

They are also known as heavy machines, heavy trucks, construction equipment, engineering equipment, heavy vehicles, or heavy hydraulics. They usually comprise five equipment systems: implement, traction, structure, power train, control and information. Heavy equipment functions through the mechanical advantage of a simple machine, the ratio between input force applied and force exerted is multiplied. Some equipment uses hydraulic drives as a primary source of motion. Electricgeneratorandbulker These subdivisions, in this order, are the standard heavy equipment categorization. Some contractors place numbers on the side of their equipment corresponding to the category - Grader '02' - followed by a sequential number that usually corresponds to the number it was purchased, for example, 02-112, is the 112th grader a company has purchased since their founding. This allows for easy recognition of the equipment type and the relevant age.\n\n62. Poke liner and gantry crane crawler crane\n\n64. 6.

It is possible to have high quality and low cost, but at the expense of time, and conversely to have high quality and a fast project, but at a cost. If both time and money are restricted, then quality is likely to suffer. High quality is not always the primary objective for the client; time or cost may be more important. It is only realistic to specify a very high standard of quality if the budget is available to achieve that standard. When defining objectives for quality the client should consider:  Available funding and time.  Existing corporate policies (such as environmental policies).  Key requirements of the business.  Key requirements of stakeholders.  The views of external organisations such as the local planning authority,  Local and national legislation (for example local planning requirements for energy use). Test of construction materialsat site  Workabilitytestof concrete –slumptest  Compressive strengthtest  Cementtest\n\n70.
