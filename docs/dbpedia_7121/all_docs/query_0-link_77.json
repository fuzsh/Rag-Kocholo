        "text": "Post reaching to Kanpur, the sleep that gave me a slip the other day was back to haunt me and the needle on the odometer went down to 20-25Kmph. It felt like I was possessed and I was desperately looking for a Dhaba so that I could rest for some time. But couldn’t find one.\n\nA stop was inevitable as I was barely able to keep my eye lids open and control the handle bars. As far as I could see it was only farm lands all around me. Finally I decided to stop and sleep on one of those paddy fields under a tree to avoid slipping on the asphalt under some heavy moving vehicle. A farmer was working in the field and I asked him if he could look after my belongings while I take a nap and he agreed. A count to five was good enough to put me off. The bike was hidden between the bushes to avoid any unwanted circumstances. It was an amazing feeling sleeping beside a highway.\n\nIf you are a motor enthusiast you would love the idea of passing vehicles playing a humming music and putting you to sleep. The earth beneath was indeed feeling like mother’s lap and the sky above reassuring me to take a good relaxed nap.\n\nIt was a good 60 minutes sleep and I woke up completely fresh. I looked at the time it was 05:00 PM. It was time to decide whether I should stop at Allahabad for the day or should I ride till Banaras to save some time.\n\nI was cruising slowly around 40 kms before Allahabad when unexpectedly I saw a sign board. Take left for Banaras. You take a slight left turn and an entire new world opens up to you. I read about it in the travelogues. Standing at the crossroad between Allahabad and Banaras I quickly did a search for Varanasi on Google maps and it showed 140 odd kilometers. It was 6:30 PM. At 70 kmph I could do this stretch in two hours. And on top of that this was as expressway. A change in plan was evident.\n\nAnd, then a thought crossed my mind, it is better to reach late than never and I decided to stay in Allahabad that day. I took the right turn and started my journey to the Allahabad city which was around 60 kms away. It took me 2 hours to cover this 60 kms as the road conditions were very bad and very soon I started to think that choosing Allahabad was not the right decision this time.\n\nHave you ever encountered any speed breaker with a pothole on it and that too filled with dirty water? I have lost the count of them on this road.\n\nI booked a hotel in Allahabad civil lines through Oyo rooms app, had dinner and don’t know when I was asleep when I crashed on the bed and was gone for good seven and half hours.\n\nOn 15th Oct’17 Sunday, after waking up at 06:00 AM feeling completely refreshed I took a bath, had breakfast and decided to roam around the city. It was a pleasant ride through the vacant roads and alleys of Allahabad. I went to the Sangam (Meeting place of Ganga and Yamuna River).\n\nThis place is not only the Sangam of two rivers but also the Sangam of souls.\n\nThere were only police personnel and parking attendants along with some tea sellers all around the city. After roaming around for couple of hours and a kulhar tea, I left for Varanasi at 8 AM which was ~130 kms away.\n\nAs they say never try to ride hard when you are nearing your destination. Forgetting about all practicality and calculations I was finding it difficult to believe how long it was taking me to cover that 100 odd kilometers. But as mentioned I lost all logic as I was riding high on emotion and wanted to stop only at my home. Also, those who have been through this road would know how irksome this route is. It was full of Hawkers, jay walkers and wrong side drivers. Probably trying to put up a last test of my patience and riding skills. I was trying hard to escape and the more I try the more they choked me from all around. Some of them I thought were intentionally trying to drive close to me as they wanted to take a close look at the bike and more over the riding gears were also something that they were not used to. I was so done with all these that I decided to stop and take a breath. And while I was looking for a tea shop I saw a sign board: “Take left for Varanasi: 30 Kms” and it was only 10:30 AM.\n\nThrilled, excited, over joyed, I am not sure how to explain the feeling. I was completely over the moon. Four years of thinking, dreaming, planning reading hundreds of travelogues and the frustration of not being able to do it, everything was playing in a sequence in my mind. All the irritation of the last 100 odd kms was just irrational thought and the itch of reaching home. The world around me stopped for a moment. I was yet to believe that it happened to me and it was unrealistically pleasing. But wait my home was 10 kms away. Made a quick call to my parents and I was back on the saddle completely energized and happy.\n\nI was cutting through the busy traffic and small markets full of hawkers as if I was playing a video game.\n\nAnd finally I was there. Home Sweet Home!\n\nAll I saw there were some puzzled faces staring with their eyes open as wide as they could. Some long twist of the throttle to announce my arrival and there they were. Mom and Dad. It’s a small family and they were staring at me as if they just saw a ghost. It took my mom and dad a good thirty minutes to come up with the first word. And guess what it was? Are you crazy? Yes I am. And I hope this craziness stays with me forever. This is what I live for.\n\nBecause being normal is too boring!\n\nGo through our You Tube channel to check out few videos about this road trip:\n\nThe Day – The Ride:\n\nOn 13th October, 2017 I returned from office and the plan was to sleep for at least 8 hours and start the ride next day early morning at 3 AM. As you know about the sleep, you will never get it when you need it the most, and especially before the ride. It never showed up.\n\nWhen you really want to sleep, you are never sleepy and when you dont want to sleep, you are always sleepy. Why is sleep such a bitch?\n\nI woke up at around 4 and started packing my saddle bag. It took me around half an hour and my RE was ready to roar on the road, at 05:00 AM I kick started my bike. The destination was very clear in my mind (Varanasi It was!). It’s all going to happen finally. It’s amazing how all the clutter in your mind disappears once you are on the saddle. After the customary five minutes of idling and some sips of water I was feeling like Valentino Rossi waiting for that green light to turn on. I was on my way to ~850 kms of date with myself.\n\nI have always found riding to be an alternative of meditation, an activity that allows you to spend lot of time with yourself and get your thoughts together.\n\nI hit the Yamuna Expressway at 06:00 AM. It was a good shining day and I promised myself not to go beyond 100 Kmph which I was able to sustain.\n\nI mean what good is speed if the brain has oozed out on the way?\n\nWith the early start, average speed and no stops I managed to save a lot of time and the expressway was over.\n\nAt 08:30 AM I ended up on NH2/AH1 (highway that connects the states of Delhi, Haryana, UP, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal). The bike was performing well, it was smooth and subtle. By now I was in confidence and started calculating my average speed and time to reach the next planned halt at Itawah. As this was a long ride I planned to stop only at major cities (Agra, Itawah, Kanpur, Allahabad and Varanasi was my plan) and few short breaks whenever I feel like stretching my body.\n\nThe Yamuna Expressway ends at Kuberpur, and the road from there till Firozabad was a regular Indian highway with broken tarmac, hawkers and truckers all over the place and at times driving on the wrong side of the road. I decided to ride slow, 40-50 Kmph was the average speed I did till Auraiya. The ride was very uneventful till Auraiya where I stopped for lunch and then I was off to Kanpur. The road condition improved so did my average speed and I reached Kanpur by 03:00 PM. By that time, the sleep that gave me a slip the other day was back to haunt me and the needle on the odometer went down to 20-25Kmph. It felt like I was possessed and I was desperately looking for a Dhaba so that I could rest for some time. But couldn’t find one.\n\nA stop was inevitable as I was barely able to keep my eye lids open and control the handle bars. As far as I could see it was only farm lands all around me and no Dhaba or Hotel was there.\n\nTO BE CONTINUED..\n\nClick here to go the last part: Part III\n\nBefore sharing my experience about the road trip from Gurgaon to Varanasi, I would like to let you know about my reason for choosing motorcycle over any other mode of transport, itineraries and Do’s & Don’t’s while doing any road trips.\n\nMotorcycle trip: Why not give it a try?\n\nIt was the time of Diwali and everyone was in a hurry to go to their home to celebrate the festival with their families. This leads to overload of passengers booking train tickets and thus leads to unavailability of tickets even if someone is booking 4 months in advance. When one tries to book a tatkal ticket through IRCTC, it allows you to book only from 10 am on wards. So one waits for the exact time and the moment you try to book, the site will not respond. All your attempts will fail till around 20 minutes, by which time all tatkal tickets are gone, and only then are you able to access it, and you only get wait-listed tickets.\n\nNow, I was left with only one option – A Road Trip. It was actually an unfulfilled wish for me since 2013 when I migrated to Gurgaon in search of a job. And, ever since it was all about day dreaming and no concrete plans. It all started since then and till now I have ridden to some places in Rajasthan (Bhangarh, Jaipur and Ajmer), Nainital, Leh and a couple of places in Himachal and UP. However, all these were group rides. Hence, I was skeptical about a solo ride of ~1600 km and that too when you talk about riding through the roads of UP, a good feedback was difficult to find.\n\nAnd, during my long journey on the Manali – Leh highway, I became a big advocate and fan of travelling by motorcycle. I usually go on a road trip after every 3 months and every single time it was made for a unique and unforgettable experience. It is about the feeling of total freedom, of really immersing yourself in the scenery around you, about the sun warming your face, a cool breeze blowing through you and all these kind of people you met on the road. So, this time I decided to go on a motorcycle trip from Gurgaon to Varanasi and personally I think it is one of the best ways to really explore a place and I can recommend everyone to at least give it a try.\n\nItineraries:\n\nThe best route you can follow while travelling to Varanasi from Gurgaon is through Yamuna expressway:\n\nGurgaon – Delhi – Noida – Agra– Mathura– Itawah – Kanpur – Allahabad – Varanasi\n\nView on map\n\nAfter doing some research I concluded that this is the shortest and most convenient route. It is about 840 km one way (total about 1680 km).\n\nDo’s and Don’t’s:\n\nGet your bike checked and serviced by a mechanic\n\nDo not carry too much luggage. I would recommend a good quality saddle bag if travelling on a motorcycle\n\nHelmets (DOT certified), good quality gloves & riding gears (riding jacket & knee guard)\n\nAlways start your journey early in the morning (3 or may be 4 in the morning)\n\nTake regular breaks and drink lots of water to avoid dehydration\n\nAvoid eating oily food or anything which will upset your tummy\n\nDo not throw dump or plastic bottles on the road\n\nAlways keep your eyes on the road and slow down whenever you see any sign board of speed breaker, populated area etc.\n\nClick here to read the next part: Part II\n\nHey! Wanderers…\n\nLet’s continue our dil walo ki dilli exploration! In our last post we talked about the history of one of the most important heritage of Delhi “The Red Fort”. Now, we will proceed to the most important section that is….\n\nHOW TO REACH RED FORT\n\nNearest Metro Stations to the Red Fort\n\nChandni Chowk Metro Station-1.5 Kilometres from the Red fort\n\nYellow line\n\n2.Rama Krishna Ashram Marg Metro Station\n\n5 Kilometers from The Red Fort\n\nBlue line\n\n3.Welcome Metro Station\n\n6.5 Kilometers from The Red Fort\n\nRed line\n\n4.GTB Nagar Metro Station\n\n7.8.Kilometres from The Redfort\n\nYellow line\n\n5.Kirti Nagar Metro Station\n\n11.1 Kilometers from The Red Fort\n\nBlue Line\n\n6.Vaishali Metro Station\n\n14.2 Kilometers from The Red Fort\n\nBlue line\n\nSo, peeps! As you can figure out from the the nearest metro station to the Red Fort is the Chandani Chowk Metro Station. It is about 1.5 km away from the Red Fort, so just a walking distance of about 20 minutes. The other metro stations are located far from the Red Fort. There’s the Rama Krishna Ashram Marg Metro Station, which is about 5 kilometers away from the Red Fort. It can take you an hour or so just to reach the attraction by walking from this station. These two metro stations are your only best choices, the other metro stations are located far from this monument and would require a taxi ride to reach there. The former two can either be walked or you can ride an auto rickshaw from them to the Red Fort.\n\nCHANDNI CHOWK METRO DIRECTION AND FARE\n\nIf you’re coming from New Delhi, fare is minimal, INR 10 only and it takes 5 min. to reach Red Fort. If however, you’re coming from a different line, like the Blue Line of Anand Vihar, you just need to switch line at Rajiv Chowk into the Yellow Line. From there, ride a train going to the Chandni Chowk Metro Station. Fare would be around Rs. 18 and travel time would be around 30 minutes.\n\nThe Chandni Chowk Metro Station has different gates. Its two main gates are for the Old Delhi Railway Station and for the Chandni Chowk, of course. So you need to access the latter gate, also known as the Sis Ganj Gurudwara Gate or Favvara Gate, located on the way towards Chandni Chowk. From this gate, you can walk further to reach the Red Fort or take an auto rickshaw to take you there.\n\nBUSES\n\nSightseeing bus tours are organized by the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) from Scindia House on all days. Among other places, these buses also take tourists to the Red Fort. The fare is approximately INR 200 for adults and INR 100 for children. You can also choose to take the Hop On Hop Off Services that offer various sightseeing packages. Package rates are between INR 300 and 500 depending on the route that you choose. Other bus routes / numbers that can take you to the Red Fort from the Delhi Railway Station are 409, 419, 425, 429, 436,446, 461 and 502. Bus numbers 951, 164,726 and 951 operate from the Pahargunj side of the Railway Station to the Red Fort.\n\nCABS\n\nRadio cabs that can be called in on phone are reliable and convenient.\n\nTICKET RATES:\n\nFor Citizens of India and SAARC and BIMSTEC nations (Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Maldives, Afghanistan, Thailand and Myanmar) – INR 10\n\nVisitors from other COUNTRIES – INR 250\n\nChildren below the age of 15 years – Free of cost\n\nVideo filming – INR 25\n\nSound and Light Show (Tuesday to Sunday) – INR 80 for adults INR 30 for children\n\nSo,this was the whole information about reaching the Red fort.
