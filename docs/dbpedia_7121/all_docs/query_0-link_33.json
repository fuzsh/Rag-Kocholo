        "text": "In order to guarantee the safety and security of the summit, several precautionary measures have been implemented. From September 8 to 10, all educational institutions and both public and private offices, including banks, in the city will be closed. During this timeframe, the entirety of the New Delhi district will be designated as 'Controlled Zone-I,' while the area enclosed by the Ring Road (Mahatma Gandhi Marg) will be considered a 'Regulated Zone.'\n\nThese restrictions will be in effect from 5 am on Friday until midnight on Sunday. It's important to note that passengers traveling to the airport, as well as New Delhi and Old Delhi railway stations, may experience some delays due to these traffic restrictions. However, the Delhi Police has reassured the public that travel to these destinations will still be possible.\n\nFrom September 7th, 2023, to September 11th, 2023, there will be specific traffic regulations in place in and around New Delhi. The Delhi traffic police have made efforts to ensure smooth Metro services and the availability of various public transport options, all while implementing certain regulations.\n\nGovernment employees, media personnel, medical practitioners, and paramedics will have permission to use both private and government vehicles within the Controlled Zone. General traffic, including commercial vehicles and buses already present in Delhi, will be allowed on the Ring Road and the road network beyond the Ring Road towards the city's borders.\n\nPassenger transportation to the Airport, Railway Stations, and ISBTs will continue to operate during the G-20 Summit. Bonafide residents and authorized vehicles will be permitted to move within the New Delhi District. Vehicles providing services like housekeeping, catering, and waste management for hotels, hospitals, and other essential installations in the New Delhi District will be allowed after verification.\n\nTo minimize disruptions, it is recommended that commuters make extensive use of the Metro services, which will be available at all metro stations in Delhi. However, boarding or disembarking at Supreme Court Metro Station will not be allowed from 5:00 AM on September 9th, 2023, to 11:00 PM on September 10th, 2023.\n\nThere may be some limitations in public transport system depending on security requirements as certain modes of public transport and certain routes of public transportation will be modified or temporarily suspended during the G-20 Summit from 07.09.2023 to 11.09.2023. Airport, Railway, Metro services, Interstate Buses & City Buses, TSR/Taxis will be functional as usual; however, the services of the railways, airways, interstate buses, city buses, TSR/Taxis may be affected/curtailed. Metro services shall remain available for commuters at all Metro stations. However, boarding/de-boarding at Supreme Court Metro Station will not be permitted from 0500 hrs. on 09.09.2023 to 2300 hours on 10.08.2023. Interstate buses will also be allowed entry into Delhi. All such buses will have terminating points on the Ring Road as suggested in Traffic advisory. City buses will operate on Ring Road & road network beyond Ring Road towards the borders of Delhi. These buses will be allowed to exit from Delhi.\n\nHowever, City bus service will not be available in New Delhi Area. No TSR and Taxi will be allowed to enter or ply in New Delhi District from 0500 hours on 09.09.2023 to 2359 hours on 10.09.2023. However, Taxis carrying Bonafide residents and tourists having valid bookings in hotels located inside New Delhi District will be allowed to ply on road network inside New Delhi District. Bonafide residents & authorized vehicles will be allowed to move within New Delhi District.\n\nThere won't be any lockdown measures in place during the G-20 Summit in Delhi. The Delhi traffic police have worked diligently to guarantee uninterrupted Metro services and to ensure the availability of all modes of public transportation with specific regulations. All medical shops, grocery stores, milk booths, and vegetable/fruit vendors will continue to operate throughout Delhi, including New Delhi. General traffic, including all categories of commercial vehicles and buses, will be permitted to travel on the Ring Road and the road network extending beyond the Ring Road towards the outskirts of Delhi.\n\nFor those traveling to the airport, the Delhi Traffic Police suggests using the Airport Express Line of the Delhi Metro for a convenient and efficient transportation option. Moreover, from September 4 to 13, the Delhi Metro will make 'Tourist Smart Cards' available for purchase at designated counters in 36 metro stations, making travel easier for both residents and visitors.\n\nFrom New Delhi to T3 (and vice versa): Take the Yellow Line to New Delhi Station and then switch to the Airport Express Line, which provides access to IGI Airport T3. Alternatively, you can use the Orange Line from Shivaji Stadium to IGI Airport T3.\n\nFrom South Delhi to T3 (and vice versa): Utilize the Pink Line to Dhaula Kuan Station, and from there, take the Airport Express Line to IGI Airport T3. Alternatively, you can use the Magenta Line to Hauz Khas Station, then the Yellow Line to Dilli Haat-INA Station, followed by the Pink Line to Durgabhai Deshmukh South Campus Station, and finally transfer to the Airport Express Line to reach IGI Airport T3."
