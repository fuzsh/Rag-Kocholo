        "text": "New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has flagged-off the Delhi-Faridabad Metro Line that would allow hassle free travel for around two lakh daily commuters between the national capital and the industrial hub in Haryana.\n\nThe extension of the Delhi Metro connects Badarpur to Escorts Mujesar in Faridabad.\n\nThe total cost of the project from Badarpur to Escorts Mujesar is nearly Rs. 2,500 crore. Out of this, Rs. 1,557 crore was borne by the Haryana Government, the Centre contributed Rs. 537 crore, while the Delhi Metro provided Rs. 400 crore.\n\nThe nine stations in this section include, Sarai, NHPC Chowk, Mewala Maharajpur, Sector 28, Badkal Mor, Old Faridabad, Neelam Chowk Ajronda, Bata Chowk and Escorts Mujesar.\n\nbuy kamagra polo online https://lasernailtherapy.com/wp-content/themes/twentytwentytwo/inc/patterns/en/kamagra-polo.html no prescription\n\nAll these are elevated and located on either side of the Delhi-Mathura Road (NH-2).\n\n“The nine-station metro corridor which was 95 per cent indigenously built will provide people a safe, affordable, quick, comfortable, reliable, environment-friendly and sustainable transport facility,” a Haryana government spokesperson said.\n\nHaryana Chief Minister ML Khattar, addressing a press conference on Saturday, had thanked the Prime Minister for “gifting” the Metro service which would take the city to “another level of progress” with better connectivity with other NCR towns.\n\nHe had also said that the Prime Minister would be announcing the go-ahead for connecting Gurgaon with Faridabad by Metro.\n\nNEW DELHI (Metro Rail News): The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has planned the Kirti Nagar-Dwarka Sector 25 and the Rithala-Narela sections for setting up the Metrolite corridors.\n\nA DMRC spokesperson told that the Dwarka Sector 25-Kirti Nagar Metrolite project will be planned along the central verge sharing road space with vehicular traffic, similar to the scrapped bus rapid transit (BRT) corridor of South Delhi. However, the 19.09 km long Metrolite corridor will not hinder usual vehicular traffic on the roads and DMRC has addressed all such issues in this project, which earlier plagued the BRT corridor.\n\nAccording to DMRC, the BRT corridor had to be dismantled as the vehicular traffic on the road was severely affected. Taking this into consideration, DMRC has planned the Dwarka Sector 25-Kirti Nagar Metrolite along the central verge and has also planned to make it elevated wherever necessary, in order to avoid any hindrance with vehicular movement.\n\nDelhi Metro has completed the feasibility study of the Dwarka Sector 25-Kirti Nagar Metrolite and the project has also been approved by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) as well as the DMRC board. MoHUA is backing the Metrolite projects in Delhi as they are less capital intensive.\n\nThe Metrolite will ply on dedicated corridors and at major crossings or intersections, it will go underground in order to ensure the smooth movement of trains. DMRC has also planned for smooth passenger movement for reaching the Metrolite stations and subways which will connect the pavements on the roadside with its stations to the center.\n\nbuy vigora online https://myhst.com/wp-content/themes/twentytwentytwo/inc/patterns/en/vigora.html no prescription\n\nThe Metrolite project is basically a smaller metro system with three coaches and has a carrying capacity of 300 passengers. It is a cost-effective project for DMRC as it costs 30-40 percent less than the Delhi Metro trains. The Metrolite corridors are usually effective in areas where large scale metro lines are not required. The Metrolite corridors will have a simple fare collection system inside the trains.\n\nThe 19.09 km long Dwarka Sector 25-Kirti Nagar Metrolite corridor will have 21 stations, out of which 16 stations will be at-grade, while five will be elevated. This will make approximately 11.8 km long distance of the corridor to be at grade, while 6.6 km long to be elevated. The corridor will pass through densely populated areas such as Mayapuri, Dabri, Bamnoli and Dhul Siras in the capital."
