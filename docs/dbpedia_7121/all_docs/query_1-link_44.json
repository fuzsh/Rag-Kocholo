        "text": "A new interchange station at Punjabi Bagh, providing interconnectivity between the green and pink line of the Delhi Metro, was inaugurated on Tuesday, officials said.\n\nThis is for the first time that the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has built such a station which connects two operational corridors. The two lines earlier crossed each other but there was no halt facility. However, there were demands from the people to provide an interchange provision at the intersection.\n\nadvertisement\n\nINTERCHANGE STATION AT PUNJABI BAGH\n\n\"Additional Interchange Station at Punjabi Bagh Connecting Green & Pink Line Inaugurated! A new interchange station on Green Line, providing interconnectivity between Green & Pink Line at Punjabi Bagh West station (Pink Line) was inaugurated today by Dr. Mangu Singh, MD/DMRC,\" the DMRC tweeted and shared its pictures.\n\nFor the first time, the DMRC has built a station which connects two operational corridors. The platforms are connected by a foot overbridge, which connects the platforms with the Punjabi Bagh West metro station on the pink line (Majlis Park-Shiv Vihar).\n\nA senior official said this new interchange station on the Green Line is not a conventional station, and was built despite engineering challenges to help connect the two lines. The entry and exit will be done through Punjabi Bagh West station of the pink line only, he added.\n\nFOOTOVER BRIDGE CONNECTING PLATFORMS\n\nThe platforms for both up and down movement at the station have been built in steel and are located right above the Punjabi Bagh roundabout. The green line viaduct has been modified to install these prefabricated steel platforms. The platforms have come up between the Shivaji Park and Punjabi Bagh stations of the green line, the DMRC said in a statement.\n\nThere will be boarding and deboarding facilities available at this station. As a result, passengers desirous of interchanging trains between green line and pink line will be able to use the facility. The platforms are connected by a foot overbridge (FOB), which connects the platforms with the Punjabi Bagh West metro station on the pink line. The FOB is 212 metres long, the DMRC said.\n\nIMPROVING CONNECTIVITY\n\nThis has been done to provide interconnectivity between the pink and the green lines. This facility will be of great benefit to passengers travelling to and from the satellite city of Bahadurgarh and other outer Delhi areas such as Mundka and Nangloi. People will be able to travel to various locations in the 59-kilometre-long Majlis Park Shiv Vihar pink corridor.\n\nThe new platforms are 155 metres in length and are connected with the FOB by two extra-large lifts (each platform) with a capacity of 26 passengers each, as well as staircases.\n\nThe green line connects Inderlok/Kirti Nagar station to Brig. Hoshiar Singh station. This is the second interchange facility on the green Line. Inderlok station connects it to the Red Line.\n\nREAD MORE| Delhi Metroâ€™s Tughlakabad line will pass under 17 pairs of active railway tracks: Officials"
