It is also the first line to be constructed under Delhi Metro's Phase II.\n\nThe Green Line has 24 stations, covering a total length of 27.96 km. It runs between Inderlok in Delhi and Brigadier Hoshiyar Singh station in Bahadurgarh, Haryana. The line also has a branch line connecting the line's Ashok Park Main station with Kirti Nagar station.\n\nThe Green Line is a popular choice for commuters due to its convenient connectivity to major residential, commercial, and educational hubs. It also intersects with several other metro lines, making it easy for commuters to transfer to other parts of the city.\n\nLatest News On Delhi Metro Green Line\n\nJune 2024: Delhi Metro's Green Line is getting a 12.37 km extension to Indraprastha, making New Delhi metro station a triple interchange hub (Yellow, Orange & Green Lines).

The expansion is part of Delhi Metro Phase 4 which is also building 86 km of new lines across 3 other corridors.\n\nMarch 2024: Delhi Metro Phase 4 is adding two new corridors to improve traffic and connectivity in the city. The first, an 8km elevated corridor from Lajpat Nagar to Saket G Block, will connect four existing lines. The second, a 12.4km Green Line extension from Inderlok to Indraprastha, will offer interchange facilities with multiple lines and have both underground and elevated sections. These corridors are expected to be operational by 2029, reduce traffic congestion, and offer faster commutes for over 250,000 daily riders. The project will also increase the number of interchange stations from 29 to 48, making travel between different parts of the city much easier.\n\nOctober 2023:\n\nThe Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) is planning to extend the Green Line southwards from Brigadier Hoshiyar Singh to the industrial city of Rohtak, adding 24 new stations to the line.\n\nThis extension will make the Green Line one of the longest metro lines in India.\n\nThe DMRC is planning to construct an interchange station between the Green Line and the Pink Line at Punjabi Bagh to facilitate easier transfers between the two lines.\n\nThe completion of four kilometres of viaduct on the Janakpuri West - RK Ashram Marg corridor of Phase 4 will intersect the Green Line at Peeragarhi, providing commuters with a direct connection to the west, northwest, and north Delhi region.\n\nThe DMRC is planning to introduce new coaches on the Green Line to meet the increasing demand for travel, featuring air conditioning, comfortable seats, and luggage racks.\n\nThese improvements and expansions are set to enhance the convenience and efficiency of the Delhi Metro Green Line for commuters.\n\nOverview Of Delhi Metro Green Line\n\nDelhi Metro: Stations Along The Green Line\n\n#\n\nStation Name\n\nInterchange Connection\n\n1\n\nKirti Nagar\n\nBlue Line\n\n2\n\nSatguru Ram Singh Marg\n\n3\n\nInderlok\n\nRed Line\n\n4\n\nAshok Park Main\n\n5\n\nPunjabi Bagh\n\n6\n\nPunjabi Bagh West\n\nPink Line\n\n7\n\nShivaji Park\n\n8\n\nMadipur\n\n9\n\nPaschim Vihar East\n\n10\n\nPaschim Vihar West\n\n11\n\nPeeragarhi\n\nMagenta Line\n\n12\n\nUdyog Nagar\n\n13\n\nMaharaja Surajmal Stadium\n\n14\n\nNangloi\n\n15\n\nNangloi Railway Station\n\n16\n\nRajdhani Park\n\n16\n\nMundka\n\n18\n\nMundka Industrial Area (MIA)\n\n19\n\nGhevra\n\n20\n\nTikri Kalan\n\n21\n\nTikri Border\n\n22\n\nPandit Shree Ram Sharma (Modern Industrial Estate)\n\n23\n\nBahadurgarh City (Bus Stand)\n\n24\n\nBrigadier Hoshiyar Singh (Bahadurgarh City Park)\n\nDelhi Metro Green Line: Operating Timings And Frequency\n\nImage Source: X/DMRC\n\nTiming: The Delhi Metro Green Line operates from 6:00 AM to 11:00 PM, 7 days a week.\n\nFrequency:\n\nPeak Hours:\n\nSection Weekdays Saturday Sunday Mundka to Ashok Park Main 4 min 10s 5 min 5 min 40s Kirti Nagar-Inder Lok to Ashok Park Main 8 min 20s 10 min 11 min 20s Mundka to Brig.
