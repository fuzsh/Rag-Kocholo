        "text": "'A Megaproject Matrix: Ideology, Discourse and Regulation in the Delhi Metro Rail' is a case study based research project and contributes to the literature on the political economy of development, planning in developing countries and megaprojects, in particular Albert O. Hirschman's study of development projects. It examines through media discourse, the Delhi Metro Rail, a transportation megaproject being implemented in Delhi, the capital of India. The research is based on the extensive coverage that the project has received since 1996 by the prolific Indian newspapers as well as government documents, informal interviews, photos and videos. The study covers a wide range of issues- the relationship between India's political ideology and the choice of the megaproject, the implications of the foreign loan and its effect on domestic funding, the transformation in the institutional frameworks of public projects towards privatization and effects on project transparency and accountability, political opportunism for credit of the project, struggle over governance reform between the national and local governments, effect on transport policy and projects at the local and national levels, struggle between domestic and foreign industry as India liberalizes its economy, the meaning of environmental impact, lack of a social security network as well as social struggle and its affect on policy, existing class barriers and media bias and shortcomings of the project design. Going beyond the immediate transportation solution that the project seeks to fulfill or its suitability based on a cost benefit analysis, the study concludes that the detailed research of a megaproject is crucial for understanding political, economic, social and cultural changes undergoing in a nation as the megaproject affects and is affected by the changing environment over an extended period of time. Political ideology determines the choice of a megaproject but the way a nation state responds to the inherent problems of such a choice can determine the direction of future development. Therefore the examination of a megaproject as it progresses can be used to reveal problems at various levels and to influence regulation and action towards equitable social benefit."
