        "text": "Ward number 97 - Kirti nagar\n\nKirti Nagar (Hindi: कीर्ति नगर, Punjabi: ਕਿਰਤੀ ਨਗਰ, Urdu: کرتی نگار) is an area of West Delhi, India. Part of the Punjabi Bagh subzone of West Delhi, it primarily a residential colony. Kirti Nagar is home to Asia's largest furniture market housing showrooms of multi-national home remodelling and fittings companies, the most reputed interior design boutiques, imported kitchen and bath brands as well as traditional carpentry furniture makers.Considered one of the upmarket areas in Delhi, the twin localities of Mansarovar Garden and Kirti Nagar are indeed one of the posh areas in West Delhi. The colony mostly consists of private houses and so called \"Kothis\", housing rich Sikh businessmen and people who migrated from Pakistan after partition constitute a significant part of the population.The adjacent neighborhood of Rajouri Garden is a popular market, comprising the Main Market, Nehru Market and many western style indoor shopping malls including TDI Mall,Moments mall, TDI Paragon Mall, Shoppers Stop, City Square, West Gate Mall, and Paradise Mall. Together, this area is now the largest single locality shopping conglomeration in Delhi ahead of South Delhi.Kirti Nagar is well connected to the Delhi Metro via the Kirti Nagar (Delhi Metro) station, which is one of the few Metro stations with a feeder bus service. Mansarovar Garden and Kirti Nagar localities are adjacent to the Ring Road on one side and Patel Road on the other which connect to Dhaula Kuan and the Central Business District of Connaught Place, respectively.Surrounding areas to Kirti Nagar are Mansarovar Garden, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, and Patel Nagar.\n\nThe influx of refugees was mostly confined to the urban areas only which resulted into cramped settlements(camps) The villages on eastern bank of Jumna was unfavourable owing to the fact that they are flooded every year. In the south of Delhi State, again, the trend is low.and this may be attributed to the fact that the land there being predominantly rocky would not have attracted settlers and also makes the rehabilitation process lengthy. In the north-west of. Delhi, the trend is seen 'rising, may be because land there is the most,fertile in Delhi State.\n\nmale\n\nmale\n\nmale-literate\n\nmale-worker\n\nmale-main worker\n\nmale-marg worker\n\nfemale non worker\n\nThe area is among the many refugee colonies in the west Delhi planned by the government in 1947 for the migrants from west Punjab. Delhi had attracted the largest no. of displaced perons because of the economic oppertunities it offered. In1948 just after the sudden exodous, Delhi was allotted a quota of 3 lac persons to provide shelter. Out of them 1.5 lac had already occupied the evacuee properties. In order to accormmodate the rest Govt. formulated a scheme to open up colonies in the city. Within course of a year, nearly 20 colonies an area of 3000 acres were opened up. A peculiar high density low rise development is observed here, which was previously dominated by punjabi community, but gradually turning out to be mixed community. The average density per acre at that time was 67 persons. Now, the population has almost doubled here.\n\nREHABILITATION COLONIES:\n\nThese include Ramesh nagar, Kirti nagar , Moti nagar ,Punjabi Bagh East ,Subhash Nagar, Tilak Nagar etc. These have become very congested, mainly due to non- resident activities in the residential premises. It is therefore, necessary that for certain pockets where there is a heavy congestion urban renewal/ redevelopment schemes be prepared and required infrastructure be provided by the local bodies.\n\nINDUSTRIES:\n\nThe major extensive industries areas located in this zone are Najafgarh road Industrial Area, Karam pura Industrial area, Kirti nagar Industrial Area, Lakkad Mandi, Mayapuri ( Rewari line ) Ph1-2 ..etc. These are the major employment centres of the zone contibuting employment around 2/5 of the total work force of the zone.\n\nLocation and Connectivity\n\nIndustrial At the end of 19th century, Delhi was flourishing commercial city and not the industrial center. But during the course of last 60-70 years, especially after partition, it made rapid strides in the line of industries and today industries occupy an important place in its occupational structure. The partition of india gave a fresh lease of life to industries with enough labour and capital transferred from west pakistan according to 1951 census transferred from west pakistan. According to 1951 census, the large scale and small scale industries together numbered 3500 giving employment to about 50000 persons in the city. About 18% of the total population in delhi is engaged in industiral production directly while 26% id engaged in commerce and activities connected with it ."
