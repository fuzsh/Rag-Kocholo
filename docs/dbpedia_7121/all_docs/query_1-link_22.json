        "text": "New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has flagged-off the Delhi-Faridabad Metro Line that would allow hassle free travel for around two lakh daily commuters between the national capital and the industrial hub in Haryana.\n\nThe extension of the Delhi Metro connects Badarpur to Escorts Mujesar in Faridabad.\n\nThe total cost of the project from Badarpur to Escorts Mujesar is nearly Rs. 2,500 crore. Out of this, Rs. 1,557 crore was borne by the Haryana Government, the Centre contributed Rs. 537 crore, while the Delhi Metro provided Rs. 400 crore.\n\nThe nine stations in this section include, Sarai, NHPC Chowk, Mewala Maharajpur, Sector 28, Badkal Mor, Old Faridabad, Neelam Chowk Ajronda, Bata Chowk and Escorts Mujesar.\n\nbuy kamagra polo online https://lasernailtherapy.com/wp-content/themes/twentytwentytwo/inc/patterns/en/kamagra-polo.html no prescription\n\nAll these are elevated and located on either side of the Delhi-Mathura Road (NH-2).\n\n“The nine-station metro corridor which was 95 per cent indigenously built will provide people a safe, affordable, quick, comfortable, reliable, environment-friendly and sustainable transport facility,” a Haryana government spokesperson said.\n\nHaryana Chief Minister ML Khattar, addressing a press conference on Saturday, had thanked the Prime Minister for “gifting” the Metro service which would take the city to “another level of progress” with better connectivity with other NCR towns.\n\nHe had also said that the Prime Minister would be announcing the go-ahead for connecting Gurgaon with Faridabad by Metro.\n\nInformation\n\nThe Delhi Metrolite project, with two lines and 37 stations, is a 40.88 km light rail transit (LRT) system planned by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to be built in Delhi.\n\nMetrolite lines in Delhi are proposed on routes where costly heavy-rail metro lines may be overkill in terms of cost and engineering. The system has been developed in accordance with the Government of India’s July 2019 metrolite specifications, and it will be less expensive to build and operate due to its smaller size and lower capacity when compared to traditional heavy-rail metro systems.\n\nMetrolite trains will primarily operate at-grade (road level) on dedicated/fenced-in corridors and will serve as a much-required feeder to the Delhi Metro system. The DMRC board approved the Detailed Project Report (DPR) for Delhi Metrolite’s Line-1 (Kirti Nagar – Bamnoli Village) in October 2019. It is presently awaiting approval from the Delhi government.\n\nKey Figures\n\nOperational: 0 km\n\nUnder Construction: 0 km\n\nApproved: 0 km\n\nProposed: 40.88 km\n\nDMRC’s Deadline: Not Finalized (Pending Route Finalization & Approval)\n\nEstimated Completion: 2026\n\nEstimated Cost: Rs. 5,587 crore\n\nFunding Pattern: 50:50 between Govt of India (GOI) and Govt of Delhi (GNCTD)\n\nSystem Specifications\n\nTrack Gauge: Standard Gauge – 1435 mm\n\nElectrification: 25 kV, 50 Hz AC OHE\n\nSignalling: Communications-based train control (CBTC)\n\nNumber of Trains: 29 (Line-1)\n\nTotal Capacity: 425 passengers\n\nNumber of Coaches: 3\n\nLength: 45m\n\nTop Speed: 60 kmph\n\nAverage Speed: 35 kmph\n\nRoute Information\n\nLine-1: Kirti Nagar – Bamnoli Village\n\nLength: 19.15 km\n\nEstimated Cost: Rs. 2,673 cr\n\nType: At-Grade (16 stations), Elevated (5 stations, Tihar Jail – Dwarka Sector 2 section) & Underground (0 stations, underpass for main-line to be built at Mayapuri & Tihar Jail)\n\nNumber of Stops/Stations: 21\n\nStation Names: Kirti Nagar (elevated), Saraswati Garden, Mayapuri Bus Depot, Mayapuri, Hari Nagar, Mayapuri Industrial Area (MIA), Mayapuri Industrial Area 2 (MIA 2), Tihar Jail, Shivpuri (elevated), Dabri Village (elevated), Sitapuri (elavated), Mahavir Enclave (elevated), Dwarka Sector 2, Dwarka Sector 7, Dwarka Sector 6, Dwarka Court, Dwarka Sector 20, Dwarka Sector 23, Dhul Siras – Dwarka Sector 24, Dwarka Sector 25 – ECC Centre, Bamnoli Village\n\nLine-2: Rithala – Narela\n\nLength: 21.73 km\n\nEstimated Cost: Rs. 2,914 cr\n\nType: At-Grade\n\nNumber of Stops/Stations: 15\n\nStation Names: Rohini Sector 26, Rohini Sector 31, Rohini Sector 32, Rohini Sector 36, Rohini Sector 37, Barwala, Put Khurd, Bawana Industrial Area – 1, Bawana Industrial Area – 2, Bawana, Bawana JJ Colony, Sanpath, New Sanath Colony, Anaj Mandi, Narela\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has presented detailed project reports to the Delhi government for approval for two Metrolite corridors: Rithala to Narela (21.7 km) and Kirti Nagar to Dwarka ECC (Exhibition-cum-Convention Centre) in Sector 25 (19 km). After receiving approval from both the state and the central government, the Metrolite Corridor will be completed within three years. Metrolite, unlike metro corridors, will be a light rail project that will mostly run on the road surface, so the Rithala-Narela corridor is scheduled to be built first.\n\nUnlike similar projects in other cities around the world that share road space with other forms of transportation, this corridor will have dedicated corridors that are fenced on both sides because sharing road space with other vehicles would have significantly lowered the train’s average speed. The Rithala-Narela Metrolite project will cost Rs. 2914 crore, of which the DDA anticipated to contribute Rs. 200 crore. The corridor will connect the Narela sub-city and will also travel through areas such as Bawana, Puth Khurd, Sanoth, Bhorgarh, and Anaj Mandi. The Kirti Nagar-Dwarka ECC Metrolite corridor is not part of DMRC’s Phase-IV project, but it will be a standalone corridor that will link to the Blue (Dwarka-Noida City Centre) and Green (Inder Lok-Brig Hoshiar Singh) lines."
