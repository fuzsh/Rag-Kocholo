        "text": "Category: Delhi Metro\n\nDMRC update on Gokulpuri Metro Stn on Pink line\n\n*New Delhi, dated: 08.02.2024*\n\n*INCIDENT REPORT*\n\nIn an incident at the Gokulpuri Metro station on Pink Line, a portion of the station wall towards Up Platform fell on the road around 11:04 AM today, injuring five persons. They were immediately sent to the nearest hospital for medical attention. However, one of the injured has unfortunately passed away.\n\nThe road was cleared of the debris on an immediate basis within an hour of the incident to ensure seamless traffic movement. Two DMRC officials, a Manager and a Junior Engineer from the Civil department have been immediately suspended pending enquiry. The Executive Director\\Civil\\O&M is at the site for a first-hand assessment of the situation apart from officials from all concerned departments.\n\nAn ex-gratia is being given to the injured as mentioned below:\n\n• ₹ 1,00,000 for minor injury\n\n• ₹ 5 lakh for grievous injury\n\nDMRC will pay a compensation of ₹ 25 lakhs to the next of kin of the deceased.\n\nDMRC officials are at the hospital ensuring all possible assistance to the injured.\n\nAll details regarding the incident have been shared with the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety (CMRS).\n\nAs an abundant safety precaution, train services on the small stretch from Maujpur to Shiv Vihar are being run on single line to attend to the fallen portion towards Up platform on Gokulpuri station which has also been temporarily closed. However, train services on the rest of Pink Line are running normally.\n\nDMRC will be further investigating the circumstances leading to this incident to take necessary remedial measures to prevent such unfortunate occurrences in the future.\n\nTaking immediate cognizance of the unfortunate incident at Gokulpuri, DMRC’s Managing Director, Dr. Vikas Kumar has issued instructions to all the concerned departments in DMRC to conduct vigorous safety checks across the Delhi Metro network.\n\n*Anuj Dayal*\n\n*Principal Executive Director*\n\n*Corporate Communications*\n\n*DMRC*\n\nIRCTC AND DMRC COLLABORATE TO INTRODUCE “ONE INDIA-ONE TICKET INITIATIVE” FOR A SMOOTHER TRAVEL EXPERIENCE\n\nIn a significant leap towards enhancing the convenience and ease of travel for passengers, the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) and the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) have forged a strategic Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). This ground-breaking collaboration aims to introduce QR code-based ticketing for DMRC services through the IRCTC portal, as part of the revolutionary “One India-One Ticket Initiative.”\n\nUnder this innovative partnership, passengers who book online tickets through the IRCTC platform for railways, air travel, or buses will now have the added convenience of seamlessly reserving DMRC QR code-based tickets. These DMRC tickets can be reserved in sync with the Advance Reservation Period of Indian Railways. By integrating these services, passengers can now effortlessly plan their entire journey in one go. The DMRC QR code-based ticket will be seamlessly generated and printed on the Electronic Reservation Slip (ERS) of IRCTC, requiring a nominal platform fee of just Rs 5/-. This strategic integration aims to streamline travel experiences, eliminating the need for passengers to endure long queues and saving valuable time.\n\nSpeaking about this pioneering partnership, Smt. Seema Kumar, Chairman & Managing Director of IRCTC, emphasized, “The ‘One India-One Ticket Initiative’ is a manifestation of our unwavering commitment to simplifying the ticketing process and enhancing the overall travel experience for passengers in the Delhi region. Through the execution of this MoU with DMRC, we are diligently working towards bridging various modes of transportation, ultimately delivering unparalleled benefits to passengers.“\n\nDr Vikas Kumar MD DMRC, shared the sentiment, stating, “Our collaboration with IRCTC marks an exciting milestone for us, aligning perfectly with our mission to offer integrated and seamless transport solutions to our valued DMRC commuters. This initiative will not only contribute to a hassle-free experience for passengers but also significantly alleviate congestion at DMRC stations by reducing the reliance on physical ticketing.“\n\nWith this landmark MoU, IRCTC and DMRC are poised to transform the landscape of travel in the Delhi region, setting new standards for convenience, efficiency, and connectivity. This collaborative effort stands as a testament to the dedication of both organizations to serve the needs of passengers in an increasingly interconnected world.\n\nEXHIBITION ON ‘PARTITION HORRORS REMEMBRANCE DAY’ INAUGURATED AT RAJIV CHOWK METRO STATION\n\nThe Delhi Metro today unveiled an exhibition at Rajiv Chowk Metro Station, dedicated to the solemn occasion of ‘Partition Horrors Remembrance Day’.

The Delhi Metro has increased the number of train trips from 478 to 637 per day on the Qutub Minar to HUDA City Centre section of Yellow Line, which is an almost 33% increase.\n\nTwo additional trains have been inducted on the Yellow Line to accommodate more number of passengers during peak hours. With this, the total number of trains operated on this line will go up from 57 to 59. Further, the frequency of trains on Qutub Minar to HUDA City Centre section of Yellow Line has also improved from 3 minutes 27 seconds to 2 minutes 30 seconds during peak hours on Weekdays. The Delhi Metro is observing the flow of passengers and may review train frequency on other lines if required.\n\nAll the trains which earlier terminated at Qutub Minar Metro Station will continue to run up to the HUDA City Centre Metro Station, subsequently resulting in more number of trips from Qutub Minar to HUDA City Centre. This will help in easing the crowd on the section of Yellow Line towards Gurugram.

Atal Bihar Vajpayee on 24th December, 2002, was specially decorated and operated today on the Red Line. Announcements were made inside the train to inform passengers that they were travelling in the very first train which sparked a delightful reaction from the passengers inside the train.\n\nDelhi Metro utilises the space in its stations to showcase artworks and exhibitions that reflect either the rich culture of places where the stations are located or to commemorate special occasions or cover a specific theme. For instance, an exhibition installed at Rajiv Chowk Metro station in August 2022 extensively covered the tragedy of ‘Partition’. Similarly, a permanent exhibition at Rajouri Garden Metro Station pays tribute to the heroes of armed forces. Many of our stations have theme-based art works as well.\n\nThe journey of Delhi Metro operations commenced on 24th December, 2002, when the then Prime Minister, Sh. Atal Bihari Vajpayee had flagged off the first ever train on the 8.4 kilometer long Shahadara to Tis Hazari corridor of Red Line. Since then, the Delhi Metro network expanded exponentially. The expansion of the network has also been among the fastest in the world, as more than 380 kilometres of new lines have been added since 2002. Today, DMRC operates 391 kilometers of metro network with 286 stations on 12 corridors (Including Noida – Greater Noida and Rapid Metro, Gurugram) across Delhi-NCR.\n\nToday Delhi Metro is the largest metro network in India and among the largest metros in the world with some of the most advanced technologies such as driverless metro operations on two corridors. The network is further being expanded in the phase – IV project, after completion of which, another 65 kilometers of network will be added. Currently, the construction is in progress on three approved priority corridors of Phase IV. Two of them are the extension of existing Pink (Majlis Park to Maujpur) and Magenta (R K Ashram Marg to Japankpuri West) Lines, while a new Silver Line will come up connecting Tughlakabad to Delhi Aerocity.\n\nRaksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh gives away RM Awards for Excellence in defence & aerospace sector for 2021-22\n\nGandhinagar. 20th oct 2022\n\nRaksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh gave away Raksha Mantri’s Awards for Excellence in defence and aerospace sector for the year 2021-22 to Indian Defence Industries, including the private sector, at an event organised as part of 12th DefExpo in Gandhinagar, Gujarat on October 20, 2022.

DMRC has been a pioneer in India in quantifying climate change benefits from its operations. It has a number of dedicated projects to its credit oriented towards energy efficiency.\n\nIn 2007, Delhi Metro became the first Metro or Railway project in the world to be registered by the United Nations under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) which enabled Delhi Metro to claim carbon credits for its Regenerative Braking Project.The CDM is a project-based Green House Gas (GHG) offset mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol allowing the public and private sector in high-income nations the opportunity to purchase carbon credits from greenhouse gas emissions-reducing projects in low or middle-income nations as part of their efforts to meet international emissions targets under the Kyoto protocol.\n\nCDM projects generate emissions credits called Certified Emission Reductions (CERs), which are then bought and traded. One CER is equal to one ton of CO2(eq) emission reduced. The CDM helps to deliver sustainable development benefits to the host country. The CDM projects are managed by The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), an entity established to combat “dangerous human interference with the climate system”. The first CDM project of Delhi Metro was based on the regenerative braking technology. Carbon credits generated from this project till 2012 were sold for ₹ 9.55 Cr.\n\nThe 2nd CDM project is based on the principle of Modal Shift. The essence of this project is that the carbon footprint of people travelling by metro is much lesser than that of the same journeys performed by other modes of transport. Delhi Metro has so far registered four projects viz Regenerative Braking project, Modal Shift project, MRTS PoA project and Solar project with UNFCCC, all of which are the first of their kind in the world. Apart from this, in 2014, Delhi Metro also became the first ever Metro and Railway system in the world to be registered with the prestigious ‘Gold Standard Foundation’, Switzerland, which is also a globally accepted certification standard for carbon mitigation projects. So far DMRC has registered four projects with the Gold Standard Foundation.\n\nSince 2015, Delhi Metro has also been providing CDM consultancy services to other Metro systems in India,enabling them to earn carbon credits from their project. Already Gujarat Metro, Mumbai Metro and Chennai Metro etc. have registered their projects under the Delhi Metro’s Program of Activities (PoA) project enabling them to earn carbon credits and contribute to India’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) in compliance with the Paris Agreement.\n\nFor the period 2012-18, combined GHG emission reduction achieved from all the above mentioned CDM and Gold Standard projects was 3.55 million carbon credits.The sale of carbon credits accrued from CDM and Gold Standard projects in the period 2012-18 has generated a revenue of INR 19.5 Cr to DMRC. Thus, total revenue generation from CDM and Gold Standard projects since inception has been INR 29.05 Cr.\n\nThere has been a higher demand for carbon credits due to global factors such as the implementation of the Paris Agreement etc. Utilizing this opportunity, DMRC has been able to sell all its 3.55 million credits accrued during the period 2012-18 to international buyers by signing the Emission Reduction Purchase Agreement (ERPA) for transfer of credits with M/s. South Pole, Switzerland, M/s. Summit Energy Services, USA and M/s. EVI International, Singapore.\n\nMAYUR VIHAR POCKET – 1 to TRILOKPURI SECTION of DELHI METRO READY FOR OPERATIONS\n\nNew Delhi.7th Aug 2021\n\nThe connecting link between Mayur Vihar Pocket 1 and Trilokpuri – Sanjay Lake Metro stations of Pink Line was formally inaugurated today by the Union Minister for Housing and Urban Affairs, Sh. Hardeep Singh Puri and the Chief Minister of Delhi, Sh. Arvind Kejriwal on 6th August, 2021 (Friday) via video conferencing. The passenger services began at 3 PM.\n\nWith the opening of this important connection, the 59 kilometre long Pink Line will seamlessly connect the northern and eastern fringes of Delhi with important markets, hospitals, transport hubs and prominent residential areas of south and central Delhi. With the opening of this section, the Delhi Metro network will now become about 390 kilometres long with 285 stations (including the Noida – Greater Noida Metro Corridor and Rapid Metro, Gurugram).\n\nDETAILS OF MAYUR VIHAR POCKET – 1 TO TRILOKPURI SECTION\n\nThe construction happened on the missing link of a 290 metres between Trilokpuri – Sanjay Lake and Mayur Vihar Pocket 1 stations of the Pink Line.\n\nImportant transport hubs such as Nizamuddin Railway Station, Sarai Kale Khan ISBT, Anand Vihar Railway Station, Anand Vihar ISBT, Delhi Cantt. Railway Station, and prominent markets like Dilli Haat – INA, Sarojini Nagar and Lajpat Nagar will get direct connectivity through this corridor.\n\nThis corridor will further be extended from Majlis Park to Maujpur in Phase – IV, making it the longest single Metro corridor in India at approximately 70 kilometers. After completion of Phase – IV, the Pink Line will also become the only Ring Corridor of Metro in the country.\n\nThe construction of this stretch was a challenging task for DMRC as the work was repeatedly hampered by the pandemic induced lockdowns and issues such as non-availability of workforce. Completion of this work was a significant achievement because the civil construction on this stretch continued despite the hurdles and concluded within the set deadline.\n\nDMRC is also developing an internal road below the viaduct at Trilokpuri which will connect the Vasundhara Road and Trilokpuri Road. The road will be 140 metres in length. This will help in decongesting the area and will ease the traffic scenario.\n\nWhile the presently operational sections of the Pink Line were made functional in 2019, this small stretch got delayed due to the unavailability of encumbrance free land. After following the due process of law, the land was acquired and R&R (Rehabilitation and Resettlement) of Project Affected Persons was done for commencement and completion of construction work. Partial access was available in October 2019 and full access in December 2020.\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES:\n\nTo expedite the work and due to unavailability of space for casting yard near the site, a unique construction method was adopted by using steel girders instead of the conventional concrete ones. A total of 40 steel girders have been placed on 10 spans. These steel girders have been fabricated and brought from a workshop at Ambala in Haryana. The length of these girders varies from 16 to 38 metres. The height of the viaduct stands at about 8 to 9.5 metres. A curved span of radius 200 metres is also a part of this stretch. This has helped in completion of the work in record time of less than one year.\n\nTRAIN OPERATION PLAN\n\nAfter the connectivity of stretch from Mayur Vihar Pocket-1 to Trilokpuri-Sanjay Lake stations, train services on entire Pink Line (Majlis Park to Shiv Vihar) will be available as per the following operational plan:-\n\n1. Train services from Majlis Park to Sarai Kale Khan Nizamuddin and Shiv Vihar to IP Extn sections will be available with a frequency of 5 min 12 sec, with 43 trains including standby trains during peak hours.\n\n2. Services from Sarai Kale Khan Nizamuddin to IP Extn section will be available with a frequency of 10 min 24 sec with every alternate/2nd train going from Nizamuddin towards IP Extn and vice versa.\n\n3. Trains will be run with a temporary speed restriction of 25 KMPH between Mayur Vihar Pocket-1 and Trilokpuri-Sanjay Lake stations (around 1.5 KM distance) due to non-availability of automated signaling system in this stretch which is still under commissioning.\n\n4. The integration of the signaling system of this particular stretch in an already operational line is a challenging task and it is expected to get the system commissioned in about the next two months time. Thereafter, trains will move with regular speed on this stretch too, eliminating the need for speed restriction.\n\nFor Quotes of the dignitaries, may please check the YouTube Link of the event as provided below:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fB1NlBGBKZA\n\nDelhi Metro latest update .Plan your Travel\n\nNew Delhi. 6th Aug 2021\n\nDMRC STATEMENT\n\nNew Delhi, Dated: 05.08.2021\n\nAt present long queues of passengers are noticed outside the Metro Stations and passengers have to wait outside Metro stations before they are allowed to enter. Further, not all gates of stations are opened for entry. Only one gate on stations having less footfall and two gates at busy stations are opened. DMRC, from time to time, has clarified the reason for the above situation and it is once again clarified that though almost the entire fleet of DMRC trains are being put into operation by DMRC yet due to current guidelines only sitting is allowed inside the trains leading to reduced carrying capacity.\n\nWith the entire fleet of DMRC with about 2000 coaches in operation, the total sitting capacity available is only about 1 lakh (2000X50). While during peak hours every day more than 2 lakh passengers come to the Metro stations. Since the number of sitting passengers space available is not enough to permit entry to all 2 lakh passengers, they are required to be regulated and consequently number of passengers who can be accommodated for sitting are only allowed. This will obviously lead to a large number of passengers having to wait outside the stations.\n\nIn order to regulate the entry of the passengers, it is thus necessary to restrict the number of gates since if more gates are opened, it will be difficult to regulate the number of passengers inside the trains. This is the reason why limited number of gates are opened. In any case, opening of more gates will not help as the number of passengers allowed inside the train are limited to sitting only. More gates opening will only cause crowding and violations of social distancing norms inside the trains and stations.\n\nRecently, random incidents have also been reported from across the network during peak hours wherein, impatient passengers have tried to barge into the Metro stations breaking the queues, opening/damaging the gates forcibly, manhandling the DMRC and CISF personnel on duty, in abundant violation of Covid appropriate behaviour. Such acts not only cause law and order issue but also put lives of co-passengers and Metro officials at risk besides increasing the risk of Covid spread.\n\nThus, in view of the current restrictions which permit Metro to offer only limited number of passengers, DMRC once again advises and appeals to the general public to travel during peak hours only when it is absolutely essential and as far as possible plan the journey during off-peak hours to avail better capacity than peak hours, avoiding long queues.\n\nRevised Guidelines for Delhi Metro Travel\n\nDMRC STATEMENT\n\nNew Delhi, dated: 25.07.2021\n\nIn view of the revised guidelines issued by the Govt. yesterday, wherein, travel in the Delhi Metro has been permitted from existing 50% of its seating capacity to 100% with NO STANDING travel from tomorrow (26.07.2021), some news reports as observed in the print, digital and electronic media are giving the impression to the general public that from tomorrow Delhi Metro will be operating with full or 100% of its capacity.\n\nIn this regard, DMRC would like to reiterate and make it clear that from Monday, *even with these revised guidelines, a maximum 50 passengers per coach are permitted, as against 300 prior to COVID*. Entry to stations therefore continue to be regulated.\n\nAs a result, though the queues may slightly reduce but they might still be there outside stations specially during peak hours owing to the compliance and adherence to the Covid appropriate behaviour inside Metro premises as per the govt. guidelines. As and when further relaxations are announced by the Authorities, DMRC will ensure that all steps are taken from its end to provide ease of entry and convenient travel to the general public.\n\nDMRC also reiterates that despite being permitted to carry restrictions on numbers of passengers it is still running maximum trains performing over 5100 trips with highest frequency daily as was available during pre-Covid times when over 60 lakh passenger journeys were performed daily, contrary to the general belief that DMRC at present is running its services with reduced trains/trips/frequency due to travel restrictions. Also, the guidelines pronounced by the Authorities are binding on the Delhi Metro.\n\nDMRC once again appeals to the public to travel by the Metro only when it is absolutely necessary and observe all Covid related travel protocols in place for their own and everyone’s safety in this fight against pandemic.\n\nDhansa Bus Stand Delhi METRO adorned with Artwork\n\nNew Delhi. 25t July 2021\n\nThe upcoming Dhansa Bus Stand Metro station on the Dwarka – Dhansa Bus Stand Grey Line corridor has been adorned with attractive artworks and photographs, which display the rich heritage, culture, flora and fauna of this suburban locality of the national capital.\n\nThe Najafgarh – Dhansa region of south west Delhi has deep cultural roots. It is rich in historical content and is also home to a marshy ecosystem which encourages the visit of migratory birds and flourishing of local wildlife. The artworks and photographic displays have tried to capture these unique characteristics of this area.\n\n‘Jheel’, a waterbody located between Najafgarh and Dhansa is an ecological heaven for a large number of perennial local wildlife and migratory birds. Parrots, eagles, ducks, sparrows, kingfishers dot this area and are a delight for bird watchers in the winters. Photographs on printed glass panels at the station showcase the rich biodiversity of this area and is themed as “Migratory Birds”.\n\nAgriculture and animal husbandry are the main sources of income for the locals but real estate projects and event venues contribute significantly to the economic progression. The colour palette of the station has been kept earthy and bold to show the amalgamation of rural and the urban values. A hand painted artwork shows the residents coming together to honour the essence of their values and is themed as, “Fringes of rural-urban progression”. The artwork showcases the bridge that is built in order to connect the past and the future.\n\nThe surrounding villages in this area are renowned for their ancient folklores. The villages host fairs to celebrate their historical significance. The locals gather around the ancient temples to pray and connect together as a community. The myths and the fables have given this area an unique identity. Therefore, somehand painted artworks are inspired by this rich spirit and the celebration of local values and are themed as “local socio-cultural scenario”.\n\nFew artworks are also depicting scenes from the fairs, while some are just showing the spirit of celebration with a touch of local designs and motifs. The artworks will be eye catching for any passenger passing through the station and might generate interest in the place itself. The artworks are aesthetically executed to better the commuter’s experience. The artworks have been skillfully curated by DMRC’s Architecture department and have been provided by a number of young artists and photographers.\n\nThe decoration of the station has been done in line with DMRC’s efforts to utilize its premises as a platform to showcase the rich heritage and culture of the nation. A number of other stations on the DMRC network have also been decorated with eye catching artworks and displays.\n\nThe approximately one kilometre long Najafgarh – Dhansa Bus Stand corridor is now ready for operations after receiving the mandatory approval from the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety (CMRS). The exact date for opening of the corridor shall be intimated shortly. With the opening of this extension, the Delhi Metro network will become 390 kilometres long with 286 Metro stations.\n\nDMRC Awarded ‘OUTSTANDING CIVIL ENGINEERING ACHIEVEMENT AWARD’ by JAPAN SOCIETY OF CIVIL ENGINEERS\n\nNew Delhi. 27th June 2021\n\nThe Delhi Metro’s Phase I, II and III projects have been awarded with the prestigious Japan Society of Civil Engineers (JSCE)’s ‘Outstanding Civil Engineering Achievement Award’ for the year 2020. The JSCE termed the Delhi Metro’s project as ‘High-Quality Infrastructure Development Project’.\n\nThe JSCE in its award note mentioned that the Delhi Metro’s projects have brought awareness of safety and efficiency at construction sites in India and provided residents with safe, secure and comfortable transportation. This award is given to highly selective showcasing projects in the development of civil engineering technology across the world.\n\nThe Delhi Metro’s civil engineering achievements in the past two decades have received global recognition and have been appreciated by prominent international organizations. Earlier, the Delhi Metro’s implementation of Phase – I was rated ‘Excellent’ in a post evaluation study conducted by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The study rated Delhi Metro’s project execution capability at ‘3’, which is the highest possible grade indicating that the performance of DMRC was excellent.\n\nThe Delhi Metro since its inception has been closely associated with Japan. The JICA has supported Delhi Metro’s all Phases including the ongoing Phase – IV project by providing not only smoothest financial support but with excellent value-added activities such as knowledge assistance by introducing Japanese innovative technologies and mindset of safety and innovation, unique work culture, technical cooperation and capacity building of DMRC. The unstinted support from Japan, JICA including India Office has helped Delhi Metro in becoming a Shining Example globally in the field of urban mass transit.\n\nDelhi Metro adopts Unique Construction method to complete Civil Work on PINK LINE’S Trilokpuri Stretch\n\nNew Delhi. 25th June 2021\n\nTo expedite work on the Trilokpuri section of Pink Line, the Delhi Metro adopted a unique construction method by using steel girders instead of the conventional concrete ones. Construction of concrete girders would have required the establishment of a casting yard and it would not have been feasible to set up a casting yard for such a small stretch within a short duration of time. Therefore, steel girders were installed on this stretch.\n\nA total of 40 steel girders have been placed on 10 spans for the 290 metre-long section. These steel girders have been fabricated and brought from a workshop at Ambala in Haryana. This has not only saved time but also there was no need to create a separate casting yard for the concrete casting of the girders.\n\nThe length of these girders varies from 16 to 38 metres. The height of the viaduct stands at about 8 to 9.5 metres. A curved span of radius 200 metres is also a part of this stretch. Earlier, for the construction of the Chhattarpur Metro station also, DMRC had adopted a similar method of using steel structures because the construction of that station was also delayed due to land acquisition issues.\n\nThe work on installing these steel girders and casting of deck slab was completed in April just before the second surge of the Covid pandemic. This was a significant achievement because the civil construction on this stretch was started in early 2020 and was repeatedly hampered by the pandemic induced lockdowns and issues such as non-availability of workforce. Now, track laying and other ancillary works have commenced on this stretch between Mayur Vihar Pocket – 1 and Trilokpuri Sanjay Lake following the completion of civil work. In addition, Overhead Electrification work is also under progress.\n\nThe track laying work is expected to be completed by the end of June. Preliminary trials are expected to start thereafter. All efforts are being made to further expedite the progress of work on this particular stretch. The section shall be operational immediately after receiving the mandatory clearances from all concerned authorities.\n\nOnce completed, this section will connect the two ends of Pink Line and will provide seamless connectivity to a long range of localities in the National Capital Region. Important transport hubs such as Nizamuddin Railway Station, Sarai Kale Khan ISBT, Anand Vihar Railway Station, Anand Vihar ISBT, Delhi Cantt. Railway Station, and prominent markets like Dilli Haat – INA, Sarojini Nagar and Lajpat Nagar will get direct connectivity through this corridor.\n\nThis corridor will further be extended from Majlis Park to Maujpur in Phase – IV, making it the longest single Metro corridor in India at approximately 70 kilometers. After completion of the Phase – IV, the Pink Line will also become the only Ring Corridor of Metro in the country.\n\nDMRC is also developing an internal road below the viaduct at Trilokpuri which will connect the Vasundhara Road and Trilokpuri Road. The road will be 140 metres in length. This will help in decongesting the area and will ease the traffic scenario.\n\nWhile the presently operational sections of the Pink Line were made functional in 2019, this small stretch got delayed due to the unavailability of encumbrance free land. After following the due process of law, the land was acquired and R&R (Rehabilitation and Resettlement) of Project Affected Persons was done for commencement and completion of construction work.\n\nNational Academy of Indian Railways confers Distinguished Alumnus to Dr Mangu Singh\n\nSanjay Agrawal. mrspa23@gmail.com\n\nNew Delhi. 1st Feb 2021\n\nDelhi Metro Rail Corporation’s Managing Director, Dr. Mangu Singh has been conferred with the prestigious ‘Distinguished Alumnus’ Award by the National Academy of Indian Railways (NAIR) on the occasion of their 70th Foundation Day.\n\nPrior to joining (DMRC), Dr. Singh had a long stint with the Indian Railways, where he served in various capacities across the country, including in the Kolkata Metro project. The National Academy of Indian Railways (NAIR) is the premier training institute for Indian Railways’ officers. The academy, located in Vadodara, celebrated its 70th Foundation day on Sunday.\n\nDelhi Metro rules for 26 January for SELECT STATIONS, PARKING to REMAIN CLOSED\n\nSanjay Agrawal. mrspa23@gmail.com\n\n24th Jan 2021\n\nThe services on Line-2 (HUDA City Centre – Samaypur Badli) of the Delhi Metro will be partially regulated on Tuesday, the 26th of January, 2021 (Republic Day). This is being done as part of the security arrangements for the Republic Day celebrations as per the instructions of Delhi Police as per the following plan :\n\nPARKING: All Metro parking lots will also remain closed from 06.00 AM on the 25th of January to 2.00 PM on the 26th of January, 2021. This step has also been taken as part of the security arrangements.\n\nLowering work of the first ever Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) of Delhi Metro’s Phase 4 work\n\nSanjay Agrawal. mrspa23@spannews\n\nNew Delhi. 22nd Oct 2020\n\nThe lowering work of the first ever Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) of Delhi Metro’s Phase 4 work has been started at Vikaspuri on the Janakpuri West – RK Ashram Marg corridor. As part of this tunnelling drive, two tunnels (for up and down movement) of a length of 1.4 kilometres will be bored between Vikaspuri and Krishna Park Extension.\n\nThe tunnelling work with the TBM is expected to start next month, after the lowering and assembling of the giant 73 metre long machine is completed. These tunnels will be located between the Janakpuri West and Krishna Park Extension stations of the corridor. The tunnelling will start from Vikaspuri area in continuation of the Magenta line tunnel that has been already constructed for the presently operational Botanical Garden – Janakpuri West corridor.\n\nThe tunnel will be constructed approximately at a depth of 14 to 16 metres. About 2,040 concrete rings will be installed in these tunnels. Each tunnel will have an inner diameter of 5.8 metres. The entire tunnelling work on this stretch is expected to be completed in about 15 month’s time. The alignment of the tunnel will be along the Outer Ring Road.\n\nAs part of the Phase 4 work approved so far, about 27 kilometres of underground lines will be constructed. The Janakpuri West – RK Ashram Marg corridor will have underground sections of 7.74 kilometres in total.\n\nA TBM, is a machine used to excavate tunnels with a circular cross section through a variety of soil and rock strata. They can be designed to bore through anything from hard rock to sand. TBMs have revolutionised the way tunnelling work is done all over the world as now tunnels can be bored without disturbing the buildings and other structures on the surface.\n\nTBMs are especially useful for underground tunnelling work in congested urban areas. DMRC has been using TBMs for its tunnelling work since Phase 1. In Phase 3, when about 50 kilometres of underground sections were built, about 30 TBMs were pressed into service in the national capital.\n\nSEP 11 Metro fully Operational\n\nSanjay Agrawal mrspa23@gmail.com\n\nNew Delhi .10th Sep 2020\n\nMETRO SERVICES ON LAST MAJOR LINE TO RESUME FROM TOMORROW; OPERATIONAL TIMINGS TO BE ALSO EXTENDED\n\nAfter resuming services on most of its Line under Stage-I of the Graded resumption from 7th to 10th September, where services were/are being run for 4 hours each in the morning and evening, the Delhi Metro will now resume services on its last major Line-8 i.e, Magenta Line from Janakpuri West to Botanical Garden (37.5 KM/25 stations) & Line-9, i.e, Grey Line from Dwarka to Najafgarh (4.3 KM/3 stations) from tomorrow i.e, 11th September 2020 under Stage-II.\n\nThe timings for running the services on Lines re-opened till 11th September 2020 under both stage-I as well stage-II will be for 6 hours each in the morning (from 7:00 AM to 1:00 PM) and evening (4:00 PM to 10:00 PM) with broadly the same frequency which used to be before lockdown. Accordingly, the details of trains/trips planned for each operational line for 11th September 2020 are given below:\n\nThese service timings will remain valid only for 11th September only and normal timing of services throughout the day from 6:00 AM to 11:00 PM will become applicable from 12th September 2020 onwards on all Lines when the last Line of Delhi Metro network i.e, Airport Express Line from New Delhi to Dwarka Sec-21 (22.7 KM/6 stations) is made operational under Stage-III, the last stage under graded resumption plan of Metro services. On Sundays (Starting from 20th September, 2020 onwards) the services will commence at 8.00 AM from all such sections which had this practice in vogue before the lockdown also. However, on this Sunday, i.e., 13th September, 2020, the services on these lines will commence at 6 AM as per the existing schedule.\n\nThus, all Lines of the Delhi Metro network comprising 349 KM and 253 Metro stations will be fully operational once again from 12th September 2020, which were closed since 22nd March 2020 owing to the national lockdown imposed by the Government due to the ongoing pandemic.\n\nOwing to new norms of social distancing in place now which has significantly reduced the number of persons to be carried in a train, DMRC has also decided to run the peak hour frequency* of trains from 8 AM to 8 PM, doing away with the concept of off-peak hours from 11 AM to 4 PM where services were available with less trains/trips earlier.\n\nGeneral public is once again advised to adhere to social distancing norms/guidelines during the Metro travel due to ongoing pandemic and also keep following DMRC’s website/social media platforms for regular updates on various Do’s & Don’ts required to be followed in these times for their own convenience, before heading out for the Metro station.\n\nPink Line & Blue Line Delhi Metro Resume\n\nSanjay Agrawal. mrspa23@gmail.com\n\nNew Delhi. 9.9.2020\n\nAs part of the Stage-I of graded resumption of Metro services, the Delhi Metro resumed operations after 171 days on its Blue Line i.e, Line-3/4 from Dwarka Sec -21 to Electronic City/Vaishali (65.35 km/58 stations) and Pink Line i.e, Line-7 from Majlis Park to Shiv Vihar(57.58 km & 38 stations) from today i.e, 9th September, 2020.\n\nToday onwards, services will be available on both of these Lines from 7:00 AM to 11:00 AM in the morning and from 4:00 PM to 8:00 PM in the evening along with Yellow/Rapid Lines which are already operational since yesterday as per the given timings.\n\nThe re-opening of these two Lines will ensure availability of nine of the existing 28 interchange Metro stations from tomorrow as given below:\n\n1.
