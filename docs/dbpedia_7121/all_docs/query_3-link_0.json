Kirti nagar also hosts the biggest golf course and country club in West Delhi.\n\nKirti Nagar has a huge residential market consisting of General Stores, Chemists, Aesthetic skin clinic, Salons and many Banks.\n\nConsidered one of the upmarket areas in Delhi, the twin localities of Mansarovar Garden and Kirti Nagar are indeed one of the posh areas in West Delhi. The colony mostly consists of private houses and \"Kothis\", housing rich businessmen and people who migrated from Pakistan after partition constitute a significant part of the population.\n\nThe adjacent neighborhood of Rajouri Garden is a popular market, comprising the Main Market, Nehru Market and many western style indoor shopping malls including TDI Mall, Moments mall, TDI Paragon Mall, Shoppers Stop, City Square, West Gate Mall, and Paradise Mall. Together, this area is now the largest single locality shopping conglomeration in Delhi ahead of South Delhi.\n\nKirti Nagar is well connected to the Delhi Metro via the Kirti Nagar station, which is one of the few Metro stations with a feeder bus service. Mansarovar Garden and Kirti Nagar localities are adjacent to the Ring Road on one side and Patel Road on the other which connect to Dhaula Kuan and the Central Business District of Connaught Place, respectively."
