Metrolite

The Delhi Metrolite is a planned 19 km (12 mi) Metrolite system with 20 stations that will connect Kirti Nagar to Dwarka ECC via Mayapuri, Hari Nagar, Tihar Jail, and Dwarka Sector 2, Sector 7, Sector 6, Sector 20, and Sector 23.[8] It will be designed as per MoHUA's Metrolite specifications,[9] and will be much cheaper to construct because of its lower speeds and carrying capacities compared to regular metros. Detailed Project Report (DPR) for this line was approved by DMRC’s board in October 2019, and is currently awaiting the Delhi Government’s approval.[10]
