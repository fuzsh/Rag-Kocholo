        "text": "This is the full version of my introduction to the Collection \"Physics in a Mad World\" published by World Scientific, Singapore. This book is about two outstanding physicists whose destinies were deeply intertwined with the tragedies and drama of the times in which they lived. Friedrich (Fritz) Houtermans was the first to understand why stars shine. He endured Stalin's prisons in the Moscow of the late 1930s, then faced the Gestapo in Germany. In the early 1970s, Yuri Golfand was among the discoverers of theoretical supersymmetry, a concept which completely changed mathematical physics in the 21st century. After his discovery, his research institution in Moscow fired him. He knew the humiliations of the Brezhnev regime firsthand, blacklisted and unemployed for the rest of the decade due to his desire to emigrate to Israel. In this volume, you will find captivating stories of the physicists' lives, as told by their friends, colleagues and relatives. A number of newly discovered archival documents are published for the first time.\n\nThis Introduction opens the collection \"Physics in A Mad World\" devoted to two outstanding physicists whose destinies were deeply intertwined with the tragedies and drama of the times in which they lived. Friedrich (Fritz) Houtermans was the first to understand why stars shine. He endured Stalin's prisons in the Moscow of the late 1930s, then faced the Gestapo in Germany. In the early 1970s, Yuri Golfand was among the discoverers of theoretical supersymmetry, a concept which completely changed mathematical physics in the 21st century. After his discovery, his research institution in Moscow fired him. He knew the humiliations of the Brezhnev regime firsthand, blacklisted and unemployed for the rest of the decade due to his desire to emigrate to Israel. This introduction gives a detailed review of background and supplemental information to the events described in the three main essays authored by V. Frenkel, B. Eskin and B. Bolotovsky who presented captivating stories of the physicists' lives, as told by their friends, colleagues and relatives\n\nThis Introduction opens the book \"Standing Together in Troubled Times\" which presents a story of friendship between Wolfgang Pauli, one of the greatest theoretical physicists of the 20th century, and Charlotte Houtermans. They met at the very onset of the quantum era, in the late 1920s in Germany where Charlotte was a physics student at Göttingen University. At that time Göttingen was right at the heart of groundbreaking developments in physics. Both Pauli and Houtermans personally knew major participants in the quantum revolution. Caught between two evils -- German National Socialism and Soviet Communism -- Charlotte Houtermans would have likely perished if it were not for the brotherhood of physicists: Niels Bohr, Wolfgang Pauli, Albert Einstein, James Franck, Max Born, Robert Oppenheimer and many other noted scientists who tried to save friends and colleagues (either leftist sympathizers or Jews) who were in mortal danger of becoming entrapped in a simmering pre-WWII Europe. This book is based on newly discovered documents from the Houtermans family archive, including Pauli's numerous letters to Houtermans, her correspondence with other great physicists, her diaries, and interviews with her children. Almost all documents presented in this book are being published for the first time."
