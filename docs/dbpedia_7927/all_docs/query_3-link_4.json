        "text": "This is the full version of my introduction to the Collection \"Physics in a Mad World\" published by World Scientific, Singapore. This book is about two outstanding physicists whose destinies were deeply intertwined with the tragedies and drama of the times in which they lived. Friedrich (Fritz) Houtermans was the first to understand why stars shine. He endured Stalin's prisons in the Moscow of the late 1930s, then faced the Gestapo in Germany. In the early 1970s, Yuri Golfand was among the discoverers of theoretical supersymmetry, a concept which completely changed mathematical physics in the 21st century. After his discovery, his research institution in Moscow fired him. He knew the humiliations of the Brezhnev regime firsthand, blacklisted and unemployed for the rest of the decade due to his desire to emigrate to Israel. In this volume, you will find captivating stories of the physicists' lives, as told by their friends, colleagues and relatives. A number of newly discovered archival documents are published for the first time.\n\nThis Introduction opens the collection \"Physics in A Mad World\" devoted to two outstanding physicists whose destinies were deeply intertwined with the tragedies and drama of the times in which they lived. Friedrich (Fritz) Houtermans was the first to understand why stars shine. He endured Stalin's prisons in the Moscow of the late 1930s, then faced the Gestapo in Germany. In the early 1970s, Yuri Golfand was among the discoverers of theoretical supersymmetry, a concept which completely changed mathematical physics in the 21st century. After his discovery, his research institution in Moscow fired him. He knew the humiliations of the Brezhnev regime firsthand, blacklisted and unemployed for the rest of the decade due to his desire to emigrate to Israel. This introduction gives a detailed review of background and supplemental information to the events described in the three main essays authored by V. Frenkel, B. Eskin and B. Bolotovsky who presented captivating stories of the physicists' lives, as told by their friends, colleagues and relatives\n\nThis is the second edition, with changes and additions, of a book proposed about two years ago. For the layman, modern physics is like an immense and magnificent cathedral that is impressive in its complex and sophisticated architecture, and amazing in size and richness of the workmanship. Yet, in this apparently almost complete edifice, there is no answer to a long series of basic and crucial questions, while in any case these answers are indispensable and preliminary to any general theory. It is essential to avoid the confusion between appropriate and clarifying answers and false tautological answers or formulas that actually say nothing about the questions posed. In this book, the starting point is the interpretation given by Einstein’s general relativity to explain the gravitational force not as an action at a distance but as an effect intrinsic to the deformation of space caused by a “mass”. This interpretation is extended to the explanation of any attractive or repulsive force as an effect of flattening of dimensions with positive or negative curvature, one for each force. It offers, without any forcing, an explanation for most of the unsolved questions of physics, of the nature of a mass, matter and antimatter, of the structure of an atom, of the origin of natural constants, of the quantization of phenomena, etc. It also offers a different interpretation of the nature of electrons and black holes. Furthermore, the existence of antimatter in protons, but not in neutrons, is also predicted, a phenomenon that appears to be documented by recent works. This book is not written by a physicist but it is also highlighted why a professional physicist would have to overcome serious or insurmountable difficulties to give innovative answers to the fundamental unsolved problems of physics using concepts unrelated to those currently accepted.\n\nAn Enlightening Way to Navigate through Mind-Boggling Physics Concepts Physics Curiosities, Oddities, and Novelties highlights unusual aspects of physics and gives a new twist to some fundamental concepts. The book covers both classical and modern physics in an engaging, straightforward style. The author presents perplexing questions that often lack satisfying answers. He also delves into the stories of famous and eccentric past scientists. Many examples reveal interesting ideas, including how: -Newton had trouble determining the mass of the moon. -An electric motor is an electric generator run in reverse. -Time travel that violates causality is not possible. -Schrödinger’s cat may be both dead and alive, and there may be two of each one of us to observe the two possibilities. -Particle physics and the basic laws of thermodynamics can appear simple yet are very complicated. Accessible to nonspecialists and beginning students, this book provides insight into physics using minimal mathematics and jargon. It summarizes many fascinating aspects of physics employing only essential formulas. Some familiar formulas are written in standard form while other equations are written in words for greater clarity."
