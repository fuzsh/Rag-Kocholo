        "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Caron Butler and Antawn Jamison gave the Washington Wizards their first season sweep of the Dallas Mavericks since 1996-97.\n\nButler had 25 points and nine rebounds, Jamison added 23 points and eight rebounds, and Washington overcame Josh Howard's 32 points to beat Dallas 102-84 Monday, the Mavericks' biggest loss of the season.\n\nThe Wizards have won five of their past six games — including beating the Boston Celtics twice — to take hold of fourth place in the Eastern Conference despite playing without star Gilbert Arenas since November.\n\nHoward's chief help came from Dirk Nowitzki, who finished with 21 points, 11 rebounds and six assists. Devin Harris added 14 points.\n\n@Subhead:Timberwolves 109, Warriors 108\n\nOAKLAND, Calif. — Ryan Gomes had a career-high 35 and 11 rebounds to help Minnesota snap a 16-game road losing streak.\n\nAl Jefferson added 21 points and 12 rebounds and Marco Jaric had 16 points, 10 assists and eight boards for the Timberwolves, who won just their second road game of the season and first since a 103-94 win at New Orleans on Nov. 26.\n\nGomes hit two free throws with 54.5 seconds remaining to give the Timberwolves a 109-108 lead. After Baron Davis missed a 3-pointer with 32 seconds left at the other end, Golden State got one last chance following Jaric's missed 3-pointer with 8.8 seconds to go.\n\n@Subhead:Spurs 95, Bobcats 86\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. — Tim Duncan had 19 points and 10 rebounds and San Antonio ended its offensive doldrums.\n\nBehind a balanced effort with five players in double figures, the Spurs snapped a two-game losing streak and ended a three-game stretch where they failed to reach 90 points.\n\nManu Ginobili and Tony Parker added 16 points each and Michael Finley scored 13 for the Spurs, who shot 49 percent.\n\nEmeka Okafor had 21 points and 10 rebounds and Gerald Wallace added 15 points before leaving late in the game with a sore left calf and knee.\n\n@Subhead:Pacers 110, 76ers 103\n\nPHILADELPHIA — Kareem Rush scored a season-high 25 points and Mike Dunleavy added 24 to lead Indiana.\n\nDanny Granger had 18 points and Troy Murphy, who left with a sore left knee, added 13. Jamaal Tinsley had 13 assists and Jeff Foster grabbed 10 rebounds for the Pacers, who moved into a tie with New Jersey for the eighth spot in the Eastern Conference standings.\n\nAndre Iguodala led the Sixers with 23 points and Andre Miller had 21. Samuel Dalembert had 13 rebounds.\n\n@Subhead:Trail Blazers 111, Hawks 109, OT\n\nATLANTA — Travis Outlaw sank a long jumper with 1 second left in overtime to lift Portland.\n\nGuarded by Josh Smith, Outlaw held the ball outside the 3-point line until under 5 seconds remained. Then Outlaw took a couple of dribbles inside the circle before pulling up and making the jumper.\n\nOutlaw led Portland with 23 points. Brandon Roy added 18 and Sergio Rodriguez had 16.\n\nJoe Johnson, who scored 37 points, missed a last-second shot for Atlanta.\n\n@Subhead:Rockets 96, Sonics 89\n\nHOUSTON — Yao Ming had 30 points and 17 rebounds, Tracy McGrady added 17 points and five assists and Houston handed Seattle its team-record 11th consecutive loss.\n\nBonzi Wells scored 16 points for the Rockets, who've won seven of their last nine games.\n\nWally Szczerbiak and Jeff Green had 15 points apiece for Seattle, now riding the longest single-season losing streak in team history. The Sonics lost 12 consecutive games across the end of the 1968-69 season and the start of 1969-70.\n\nFormer Texas star Kevin Durant shot poorly for the third straight game, scoring 12 points on 4-for-13 shooting. Durant was 10-of-39 in his previous two games.\n\nJazz 109, Clippers 93\n\nLOS ANGELES — Deron Williams had 18 points and 13 assists, and six of his teammates also scored in double figures as Utah beat Los Angeles.\n\nMatt Harpring scored 17 points for the Jazz, who have won eight of 10 after losing 11 of their previous 14 games. Harpring shot 7-for-10 in a season-high 27 minutes. It was his first game since team orthopedic specialist Dr. Lyle Mason lifted the ban that limited Harpring's minutes from 16 to 18 per game. The 10-year veteran missed the entire preseason after undergoing surgery on his right knee for the third time in his career.\n\nCorey Maggette scored 23 points for Los Angeles and Chris Kaman added 17 points and 10 rebounds. The Clippers haven't won consecutive games since starting the season 4-0. They are 8-25 since then.\n\nRookie Al Thornton hit a 3-pointer with 4:17 left in the third quarter, capping a 12-2 run that sliced Utah's 14-point lead to 66-62. That was as close as the Clippers got the rest of the way.\n\nGrizzlies 104, Bulls 90\n\nMEMPHIS, Tenn. — Mike Miller and Rudy Gay each had 24 points and 110 rebound to lead Memphis.\n\nPau Gasol had 12 points and 10 rebounds, while Mike Conley added 10 points and a career-high 10 assists. Hakim Warrick scored 12 points for Memphis.\n\nBen Gordon led the Bulls with 25 points, and Andres Nocioni had 16, Luol Deng 13 and Kirk Hinrich 12 points.\n\nChicago shot just 37 percent from the field while Memphis made 52 percent."
