        "text": "Samuel Dalembert was held out of Sunday's game against New York because he was late to Saturday's workout session, coach Rick Carlisle said.\n\nIt's the second time this season the Dallas Mavericks' usual starting center has been late for a practice. He was lifted as the starter against Philadelphia in November but played from the second quarter on.\n\n\"I was late for my lifting,\" Dalembert said. \"I just feel ashamed of it. We're taking steps to make sure that doesn't happen. And we'll move on. Just make sure I have second options. And some people helping me in those situations. It's a sleeping thing for me. We're working on it. I can't sleep at night. When that happens to me, I try to go to bed really early and situations like this happen.\"\n\nCarlisle said the one-game penalty for Dalembert would be all the discipline that is doled out.\n\n\"It's a one-game situation,\" he said. \"But we need everyone to be all in. Our margins of error are obviously thin. So we are not going to reinforce behavior that is unacceptable and that's just the way we are going to do business with him. And we need him. And I think we can correct this and I believe we will.\n\nSaid Shawn Marion: \"He's a part of this team and we need him. But when you mess up, you got to be disciplined. We could have used him tonight. But you got to respect it. We're all going to stick behind him.\""
