        "text": "IF Madison Square Garden’s silent behind-the-screen star James Dolan has anything on the ball he should already be thinking about offering Mark Jackson the Knicks’ head coaching job for next season and beyond. Given that opportunity, no way Jackson won’t renounce the final 11/2-year guarantee (roughly $6.2M) remaining on his contract.\n\nIt figures to be a big next couple of days in Fun City. Michael Bloomberg will be sworn in and the Knicks will be sworn at.\n\nWho deserves to be fired first (as in next), Pat Riley or Bob Whitsitt? As if Paul Allen and/or Mickey Arison have the onions to make their top executives suffer the consequences for their teams being capped out and tapped out. What’s exceedingly more likely to happen is Blazer coach Maurice Cheeks and the Heat players will be held accountable!\n\nSpeaking of the reeking, the Heat’s latest losing streak is five As for the vastly underachieving Blazers, in the words of that noted philosopher/procreator Shawn Kemp, “What a difference a trimester makes.” They’ve gone from being the deepest team to a team in deep do-do. Where’s Mrs. Sabonis when you need her?\n\n*\n\nNo matter how you slice or dice it, several elite Eastern guards will have their egos bruised when the All-Star team is fully assembled. One thing’s for sure, you know the league and NBC are going to get their marquee value out of Michael Jordan. That leaves a maximum of five spots should the team wisely be limited to two centers and four forwards: Jason Kidd, Allen Iverson, Paul Pierce, Tracy McGrady, Andre Miller, Baron Davis, Ray Allen and Jerry Stackhouse are the realistic choices. I’d like to be the first to express my sincere commiseration to Davis, Allen and Stackhouse.\n\nTravis Best refused to enter the Wizards’ game with 40 seconds left in the second quarter, clearly upset (throwing a towel) when yanked earlier (Tyronn Lue drained two 3-pointers on him) after only three minutes of play. Isiah Thomas and Best claimed the problem was straightened out, leading to increased production and intensity improved after intermission. Still, according to sources close to Best, unhappy with his diminished role as backup to rookie Jamaal Tinsley, asked to be traded several weeks ago and his desire to leave was reinforced by this incident.\n\nOnce again, financial restraints (fear of a luxury tax that might not even go into effect until the following season, if at all) imposed by ownership prevented the 76ers from making home improvements. During the off-season management renovated its roster about a half dozen times, but when it came time to match the Nets’ $34M offer sheet to Todd MacCulloch, his salary was deemed prohibitive. Same thing occurred a week ago when GM Billy King agreed to trade rookie Samuel Dalembert to Denver for George McCloud, whose $2.4M contract ($2.6M next season) would’ve been slotted into Matt Geiger’s (now expired) medical exception. However, the deal was nullified by ownership because of possible luxury tax implications.\n\n*\n\nHow desperate is Mike Fratello to get back into NBA coaching? During a TNT broadcast he confessed how flattered he was to be mentioned in a Chicago newspaper article as a potential candidate for the Bulls opening before Bill Cartwright was promoted. The only thing more embarrassing would be if Fratello planted the story.\n\nMeanwhile, GM Jerry Krause confirmed his acute ineptness by deputizing assistant Bill Berry interim coach when Tim Floyd resigned. Talk about an executive being unprepared for something everyone knew was bound to happen eventually. Why the procrastination? Why didn’t Krause appoint Cartwright immediately? What did Krause know about Medical Bill on Friday that he didn’t know about him during his six seasons as a Bulls assistant? Or was San Quentin Dailey given first dibs on Fratello’s dream work place? In the final analysis, I suspect, Krause gave Cartwright the job so he could get a better table at The Ponderosa Steadhouse.\n\n*\n\nI could be wrong, but Rick Carlisle’s honeymoon at The Palace may be coming to a close. The Pistons waded through their seventh straight reversal Friday in Orlando, pea shooting less than 36 percent, led by Stackhouse’s 3-15 brick house. However, all is not morose in Motown. The Pistons draw the shades on the year hosting the Heat, otherwise known as the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nShould Indiana be unable to acquire a fairly competent big man (Erick Dampier, Raef LaFrentz, Dale Davis, Jamal Magloire, Chris Mihm?????) who would allow Jermaine O’Neal to switch to his natural macho forward position, look for team president Donnie Walsh to make a big play for free agent Arvydas Sabonis a month or so before the playoffs. Then again, there’s always Rik Smits to romance.\n\nLeave it to The Mysterious J. to explain how the Pacers held Michael Jordan to a career low six points in Thursday’s virtual whitewash of Washington: “Isiah froze him out.”"
