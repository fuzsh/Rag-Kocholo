        "meta_description": "If the lottery had played to form last year, there’s a very real chance Greg Monroe would have been well out of reach of the Pistons. It’s impossible to say, of course, because teams generally don’t have fully formed opinions about top prospects until the final days and weeks leading to the draft – and until they know where they’ll be drafting. The lottery order sets in motion the events – including the individual workouts that separate candidates in the eyes of the teams making the picks – that determine the way draft night unfolds.",
