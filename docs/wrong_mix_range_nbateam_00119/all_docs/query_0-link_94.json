        "text": "I did my best. Not good enough! Didn't complete my ambitious plan of 30 draft previews in 30 days.\n\nBut alas, I am sitting here live at media row at the 2010 NBA Draft inside Madison Square Garden. Follow me on Twitter at @poormanscommish or on Facebook at http://facebook.com/dreamleague.\n\nThe crux behind trying to analyze the draft needs of each team, particularly those after the Lottery picks, which may not be as clear-cut \"best player available\", were the salaries committed at each position. Thank you, HoopsHype.\n\nMy hope is that this will help you as you watch the Draft.\n\nHere's a compilation of the remaining teams, from the 12th pick (Memphis Grizzlies) to the 1st pick (Washington Wizards). I left out our Golden State Warriors because I'm sure you guys are well-versed and immersed in our roster (troubles) already...\n\nDISCLAIMER: There very well could be mistakes.
