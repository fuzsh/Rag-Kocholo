        "text": "The Houston Rockets hope to improve on last year's fourth-place finish in the Western Conference and first-round playoff loss to the Portland Trail Blazers. They gambled in the offseason, trying to lure Carmelo Anthony and Chris Bosh to join Dwight Howard and James Harden, but lost. They also lost Chandler Parsons and Jeremy Lin. They did add Trevor Ariza, a solid defender on the wing.\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks finished eighth in the West last season and pushed the Spurs to seven games in the postseason's first round. They added Parsons, Tyson Chandler and Raymond Felton. They also re-signed Dirk Nowitzki, 36, to a team-friendly contract that included a pay cut to help the Mavericks add other players.\n\n3. Will the Cavaliers win the Eastern Conference?\n\nCan the new Big Three of James, Love and Kyrie Irving come together quickly enough to rise to the top in the East? The Cavaliers will be nothing if not entertaining.\n\nIrving has been the main option for the Cavaliers since he was drafted, and he will be asked to run the offense centered around James. How long will it take for Irving to surrender control, and will such a move hurt his game?\n\nFor James, the adjustment will be playing with a ball-dominating guard. James controlled the offense with the Heat, and how he handles not doing that will be key for Cleveland.\n\nLove will go from main offensive weapon with the Minnesota Timberwolves to a lesser role, and shooting guard Dion Waiters can no longer be a shoot-first player.\n\nThe Cavaliers are loaded with talent and potential, but they'll have to figure out a way to make the pieces fit together.\n\n4. Can Kevin Durant heal and win his first championship?\n\nDurant has been in the league for seven seasons, with five All-Star appearances and an MVP award, but he hasn't won a title. The Oklahoma City Thunder reached the Finals in 2012, losing in five games to the Heat.\n\nOf course, that goal got pushed to the side by a Jones fracture in his foot, but he should be back in the Thunder lineup by December or January. Whether he makes a full recovery remains to be seen, but he's expected to be out there.\n\nStill the lack of offensive balance has constantly thwarted the Thunder's recent playoff chances, as the team relies heavily on Durant and guard Russell Westbrook for most of its scoring.\n\nThe Thunder made a run at Gasol this offseason but lost out to the Bulls. They're hoping the development of Perry Jones and Steven Adams and the signing of Anthony Morrow will give them help offensively.\n\nThe Thunder will again compete for the conference title, but Durant will need help.\n\n5. Can the East finally rival the West?\n\nExcluding the lockout season, the last time the East had all eight playoff teams finish the regular season with a record better than .500 was 2004-05. That could change this season.\n\nThe Cavaliers have loaded up with James and Love, and the Hornets, Washington Wizards and Toronto Raptors have been steadily improving and could make a run.\n\nFor the Wizards, John Wall and Bradley Beal are turning into a formidable backcourt duo, and Paul Pierce adds veteran leadership and another offensive threat. In Charlotte, Al Jefferson and Kemba Walker will be joined by Stephenson, who, if nothing else, will add excitement to the franchise. DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry led a young, scrappy Raptors team to third place in the conference last season and have something to build on.\n\nAl Horford is back for the Atlanta Hawks, a team with a lot of cap space that has a nice young nucleus and a lot of upside. Horford was limited by injury to 29 games last season.\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets could also be better than expected with the return of Brook Lopez (17 games last season) and the addition of veteran coach Lionel Hollins.\n\n6. Can Carmelo Anthony combine winning with money?\n\nAnthony had two paths to choose from in free agency: re-sign with the New York Knicks for five years, $140 million ($5.6 million less than a maximum contract) or take less money and sign with a team that was ready to win.\n\nHe chose the money - and the hope team President Phil Jackson and first-year coach Derek Fisher can turn around the team's fortunes.\n\nAt 30, Anthony might not have too many title shots left. Some factors are out of his control, including the roster around him, with new teammates in Samuel Dalembert and Jose Calderon.\n\nAs constituted, the Knicks are nowhere close to championship contenders. Will Anthony be around to make it happen? It makes you wonder whether championships are Anthony's first priority.\n\n7. Can Kobe Bryant shut down the adversity?\n\nExpect the Los Angeles Lakers star to jut his jaw out a bit and play with the same kind of intensity that has defined his career. If he can stay on the court.\n\nBryant has a clear-cut individual milestone to chase for the first half of the season, as he is 593 points away from passing Michael Jordan for third all-time in NBA history. But that's not going to be what matters to \"The Black Mamba.\"\n\nHe's faced all sorts of doubt this offseason, including an ESPN report that suggested he might be the root of the Lakers' downfall. But that skepticism comes with the thought that he won't be any good on the court, particularly surrounded by perhaps the worst supporting cast of his career.\n\nUltimately, Bryant played six games last season because of two leg injuries and, at 36, is a constant injury risk. But he can't be counted out.\n\n8. How far can the Heat go?\n\nWithout James, the Heat will become more balanced. Bosh and Dwyane Wade remain, and the signings of Luol Deng, Danny Granger and Josh McRoberts should help keep the Heat competitive. They drafted a scoring point guard in Shabazz Napier, but he'll be a work in progress.\n\nMiami will be forced to look for different ways to get points. Bosh will have to be more consistent as a scorer and coach Erik Spoelstra will have to be creative with Wade, resting him more and more to keep him ready for the playoffs.\n\nThe Heat might not be one of the top two seeds in the East, but they could host a first-round playoff series and have enough experience to hold off the young, up-and-coming teams in the conference.\n\n9. Which of the eight new coaches will have the biggest impact?\n\nThe most interesting challenge belongs to the Cavaliers' David Blatt, who is no longer simply inheriting a 33-win team looking to build its way up. Blatt, who had been coaching in Israel for two decades, now has a roster with James and Love and faces immediate expectations.\n\nJason Kidd goes from the Nets to the Milwaukee Bucks, a team seemingly further from success than the team he left. Hollins, who had success with the Memphis Grizzlies, replaces him in Brooklyn.\n\nThe Detroit Pistons turn to veteran Stan Van Gundy; Byron Scott tries to return glory to the Lakers, a franchise for whom he played; and Flip Saunders takes over as coach, again, of the Timberwolves, a team he rebuilt as general manager.\n\nFisher in New York, Steve Kerr with the Golden State Warriors and Quin Snyder with the Utah Jazz are NBA head coaches for the first time.\n\n10. Which NBA team will have a breakout season?\n\nWhat team will be this season's Phoenix Suns, picked to be non-factors last season, turning into a solid playoff contender? It could be the Suns again.\n\nIn addition to draft picks T.J. Warren and Tyler Ennis, the Suns signed former Sacramento Kings point guard Isaiah Thomas. That should give them depth to go with Goran Dragic and Eric Bledsoe.\n\nHow about the New Orleans Pelicans, who have a future superstar in big man Anthony Davis, a roster full of players coming off injury and a new center in Omer Asik?\n\nThey have plenty of potential to make the playoffs but face the challenge of playing in a division stacked with contenders.\n\nMcClatchy Newspapers"
