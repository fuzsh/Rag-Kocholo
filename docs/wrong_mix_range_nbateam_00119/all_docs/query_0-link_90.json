        "text": "On the day after Christmas, all was quiet on Phil Jackson’s Twitter feed. There wasn’t another New Year’s resolution, a promise from Santa or a defense of the Tyson Chandler trade. Jackson’s signature transaction continued to look abysmal on Christmas Day before a nationally televised audience.\n\nTo recap all you need to know about the holiday matinee loss: The Wizards scored on their first four possessions with four different players getting buckets, and never looked back. The first three hoops occurred with Chandler’s replacement, center Samuel Dalembert, trying to protect the rim and instead protecting nothing.\n\nRookie coach Derek Fisher made a last-minute starting-lineup change, inserting Dalembert in at center instead of Quincy Acy to go big. They looked small. Fisher again pressed the wrong button in pressing the big Haitian into starting duty with little warning.\n\nOn the first possession, Paul Pierce drove and fed center Marcin Gortat for a layup over Dalembert, who was cited earlier this week by Hubie Brown for having a bad season.\n\nNene then drove past Dalembert for a hoop and got fouled. John Wall whipped past Jose Calderon and scored over Dalembert for a layup. Pierce capped it with a 3-pointer, and it was 9-2 after 2:16. Fisher called timeout. It was 34-23 after one quarter, and you could’ve gone on with your Christmas from there. Dalembert received just 12:04 of playing time.\n\nCalderon had a brutal offensive (5 of 14) and defensive showing. It was a mismatch of massive proportions watching him try to stay in front of Wall.\n\nJackson added Calderon to make the Knicks better this season and in the future, but the two years left on his pact now look like an albatross.\n\nAnd talk about an unfair matchup: In the second half, Wall posted up Shane Larkin, another addition to the Chandler deal, and spun past the frozen former University of Miami standout for an uncontested layup.\n\nLast week, after the Knicks lost to Chandler’s Mavericks, Jackson went on Twitter to defend the deal, saying it can’t be judged for four years, that he received three rotation players from the trade, a subtle reminder that point guard Raymond Felton still hasn’t played for Dallas. At 5-26, Jackson would be wise to concede his first big trade is a dud – unless Cleanthony Early, taken with a second-round pick received in the deal, turns into a stud. The rookie still is not practicing fully after knee surgery.\n\nOther observations:\n\n— Fisher blamed the slow start Thursday on the Knicks being home on Christmas. He said there’s “a lot on your plate’’ with family obligations, getting tickets, etc. Amar’e Stoudemire strongly disagreed, saying: “Playing home should be even better, home crowd, sleeping in your own bed at night.’’ It seemed another example of Fisher searching too hard for excuses for his club. How about this line on the slow start? “No excuses. We weren’t ready to play.’’\n\n— Carmelo Anthony scored 34 points on 28 shots and made some dazzling moves. He expended so much energy on offense – with a handful of isolations that made the triangle disappear – that he had no verve on defense. He was slow closing at the 3-point line and seemed to help when he should’ve guarded the shooter. In one instance, he collapsed the lane, giving Rasual Butler a wide open corner 3-pointer. Butler had enough time to sip a half-gallon of egg nog. Anthony was also partly responsible for the Wizards’ scoring 50 points in the paint. When the superstar leader doesn’t defend, it rubs off, though his injured left knee may not allow him to go full tilt on both ends.\n\n— Eight points in 30 minutes for Tim Hardaway Jr. – 1-of-6 from the 3-point line and again a step slow on defense. This isn’t the same guy who made first-team All-Rookie in 2013-14. That’s another strike against Fisher.\n\n— The league took pity on Knicks by giving Acy a one-game suspension for the Christmas fight. Acy’s intent was clear after he was pushed by Wall. It looked like he was trying to do some damage to Wall, and might have had he not been restrained by several players."
