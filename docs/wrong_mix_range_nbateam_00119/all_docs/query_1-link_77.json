        "text": "OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - Kevin Durant scored 10 of his 40 points in the second overtime, Russell Westbrook added his third triple-double of the season and the Oklahoma City Thunder kept the Washington Wizards winless on the road with a 124-117 victory on Friday night.\n\nDurant converted a three-point play, hit a tiebreaking 3-pointer from the right wing and then added a jumper from the top of the key as the Thunder finally took the lead for good. Washington fell to 0-22 on the road, matching the third-worst start in NBA history.\n\nBut the Thunder gave the Wizards plenty of chances. Nick Young scored 32 points but missed a potential game-winner at the end of the first overtime, and Rashard Lewis' tip try also missed.\n\nNuggets 117, Cavaliers 103\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) - Carmelo Anthony scored 33 points, Arron Afflalo added 23 and Denver avoided any embarrassment by handing the pathetic Cavaliers their team record-tying 19th straight loss.\n\nStill winless in 2011, the Cavs have also dropped 29 of 30 and are now just five losses away from breaking the NBA record of 23 consecutive defeats in one season, an inglorious mark shared by the expansion Vancouver Grizzlies (1995-96) and Nuggets (1997-98).\n\nMelo and the Nuggets showed little compassion for the Cavs, who rallied within six in the fourth but couldn't get any closer.\n\nJ.J. Hickson had 24 points and 14 rebounds for Cleveland, which lost its final 19 games in 1981-82.\n\nHeat 88, Pistons 87\n\nMIAMI (AP) - Eddie House hit two deciding free throws with 6.5 seconds left, LeBron James led all scorers with 39 points and Miami rallied late to beat Detroit.\n\nJames finished with nine assists and eight rebounds for the Heat, who played without Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade and trailed by 10 late in the third quarter.\n\nHouse had 15 points and Mike Miller added 12 for Miami, which had lost five of its last six games.\n\nBen Gordon scored 21 points for Detroit, which had a chance to win it on the final play, but Austin Daye's dunk attempt after a pass by Tayshaun Prince bounced off the rim.\n\nKings 100, Lakers 95\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) - DeMarcus Cousins had 27 points and 10 rebounds, Omri Casspi added 20 points and Sacramento snapped an eight-game losing streak to the Lakers.\n\nKobe Bryant passed Hakeem Olajuwon for eighth place on the NBA's career scoring list while scoring 21 of his 38 points in the first quarter, but the Lakers apparently got caught looking ahead to Sunday's NBA finals rematch with Boston.\n\nSamuel Dalembert scored 18 points as the Kings (11-33) jumped to a 20-point lead in the third quarter against the Lakers' disinterested defense.\n\nThe Kings then survived the Lakers' late rally for their first win over their one-time archrivals since December 2008.\n\nSuns 88, Celtics 71\n\nPHOENIX (AP) - Marcin Gortat had career highs of 19 points and 17 rebounds, Vince Carter added 17 points and Phoenix ran over weary Boston.\n\nPhoenix was dominant inside against Boston's front line to build an 18-point lead in the first half and never let up, snapping a three-game losing streak.\n\nSteve Nash had 13 points and 10 assists, while Robin Lopez and Mickael Pietrus added 11 points apiece.\n\nBoston, the NBA's top-shooting team, never found a rhythm offensively, shooting 34 percent and making just two of its 18 3-point attempts. Kevin Garnett had 18 points and nine rebounds, but was ejected in the fourth quarter after a below-the-belt shot on Channing Frye.\n\nBulls 99, Magic 90\n\nCHICAGO (AP) - Derrick Rose scored 22 points despite two painful stomach ulcers, Luol Deng added 26, and Chicago beat Dwight Howard and Orlando.\n\nThe Bulls won for the ninth time in 11 games even though Howard scored a season-high 40 points, taking the lead with a big third quarter and then holding off a late push by Orlando.\n\nThe Magic cut it to 93-90 after Howard scored, stole a pass and fed Gilbert Arenas for a layup. Deng then scored down low with 1:22 left, and Rose hit four free throws the rest of the way, sealing the win.\n\nCarlos Boozer added 16 points and 16 rebounds, helping Chicago avenge an earlier blowout at home by Orlando.\n\nHawks 111, Knicks 102\n\nATLANTA (AP) - Joe Johnson scored 34 points and Atlanta turned back New York's late comeback.\n\nForward Marvin Williams made his first start since Dec. 29, giving the Hawks their original starting five for the first time in almost a month, but he may soon face an NBA suspension.\n\nWith 43.7 seconds remaining, Williams pushed New York's Shawne Williams in the back, starting a brief altercation, and appeared to throw a punch.\n\nAmare Stoudemire led the Knicks with 27 points, including a basket to cut Atlanta's lead to 102-97 with 4:05 remaining. Josh Smith, who had 24 points, answered with a 3-pointer from the corner for Atlanta.\n\nJazz 108, Timberwolves 100\n\nSALT LAKE CITY (AP) - Paul Millsap scored 30 points, Earl Watson had a season-high 13 assists in place of injured Deron Williams, and Utah beat Minnesota to halt a six-game losing streak.\n\nAndrei Kirilenko added a season-high 27 points and had a key steal in the final minute for the Jazz (28-19).\n\nThe Timberwolves fell to 10-36 and have lost six straight despite Kevin Love's 32nd consecutive double-double. He had 22 points and 15 rebounds.\n\nThe Jazz were without leading scorer Williams for the first time this season because of a hyperextended right wrist.\n\nPacers 124, Nets 92\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) - Mike Dunleavy scored 30 points to help Indiana snap a six-game losing streak.\n\nDunleavy shot 12 for 16 from the field and made 6-of-7 3-pointers in his first game with 30 or more points in more than two months. He helped Indiana post its largest margin of victory this season.\n\nRoy Hibbert scored 20 points, Danny Granger had 18 and rookie Paul George added 15 for the Pacers, who shot 63 percent overall and made 12-of-22 3-pointers. It was Indiana's second-best scoring effort of the season, behind its NBA season-high, 144-point outburst Nov. 9 against Denver.\n\nBrook Lopez led the Nets with 28 points. New Jersey had won four of its past five games, but allowed its highest point total of the season.\n\nGrizzlies 99, 76ers 94\n\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) - Rudy Gay scored 16 points and put Memphis ahead for good with a 6-footer in traffic, helping Memphis rally from a 21-point deficit and beat Philadelphia.\n\nThe Grizzlies trailed by 21 in the third quarter and were down 16 entering the fourth. Gay helped the Grizzlies take over down the stretch. He threw down a thunderous dunk and then hit the contested jumper to make it 87-85.\n\nZach Randolph had 22 points and 12 rebounds for the Grizzlies.\n\nJodie Meeks and Jrue Holiday each scored 16 points for the Sixers. Elton Brand had 15 points and nine rebounds.\n\nBucks 116, Raptors 110, OT\n\nTORONTO (AP) - Corey Maggette hit a tiebreaking 3-pointer in the final minute of overtime and Milwaukee handing Toronto its 10th straight loss.\n\nMaggette had 29 points and 11 rebounds, and Andrew Bogut scored six of his 24 points in overtime as the Bucks won their second straight and fourth in six games.\n\nErsan Ilyasova matched his career high with 25 points before fouling out and former Raptor Carlos Delfino had 15.\n\nAmir Johnson scored a season-high 24 points and added 12 rebounds, Andrea Bargnani scored 23 and Jose Calderon had 13 points and 11 assists for Toronto, which matched its longest losing streak since a 10-game slide from March 26 to April 12, 2006.\n\nBobcats 121, Warriors 113, OT\n\nOAKLAND, Calif. (AP) - Stephen Jackson scored 31 points, including a tying 3-pointer in the final second of regulation, and the Charlotte Bobcats rallied for 121-113 overtime victory against the Golden State Warriors on Friday night.\n\nThe former Warriors standout was booed throughout, none louder than after his 28-footer with 0.6 seconds left in the fourth quarter banked in. He added seven rebounds, four assists and some big baskets in overtime to help the Bobcats to their third straight win and fifth in the last six games.\n\nStephen Curry had 27 points, and Monta Ellis scored 21 for a Warriors team that blew a 16-point lead and is fading fast during its longest homestand of the season. Golden State has lost four straight games."
