        "text": "Ethan Norof@ ethan_norofCorrespondent I\n\nNBA Free Agents 2011: Top Free Agents and Where They're Headed\n\n0 of 56\n\nThe NBA's free agency period opens up at 2:00 PM ET on December 9 for the 2011-12 season.\n\nAlthough a fair amount of players have already agreed to new contracts with different teams prior to the window opening, nothing can be officially recorded and signed until the specified time and date.\n\nThere will be a flurry of moves to track as the shortened season leaves less time for players and teams to make decisions, but we'll keep updating the recent moves for fans to keep track of throughout the entire process.\n\nCaron Butler, Los Angeles Clippers\n\n1 of 56\n\nButler drew interest from a number of clubs before ultimately making his decision to join Blake Griffin and the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nThe veteran small forward signed on for three seasons and $24 million, and the Clippers will be taking a big gamble on him following reconstructive knee surgery.\n\nTyson Chandler, New York Knicks\n\n2 of 56\n\nChandler boosted his stock immensely after a championship run with Dallas, and he's turning his successful season into an unbelievable pay day with New York.\n\nThe Knicks will use the amnesty clause on PG Chauncey Billups and trade Ronny Turiaf in order to clear cap space and sign Chandler to a four year deal worth approximately $60 million.\n\nShane Battier, Miami Heat\n\n3 of 56\n\nAlthough Battier tweeted out his decision to head down to South Beach, it was reported that the defensive stalwart would be signing his next contract with the Heat.\n\nWith the arrival of Battier, Miami now boasts outstanding perimeter defense with Battier, LeBron James and Dwyane Wade, and there's no doubt that this is a move which makes the Heat even better.\n\nMarquis Daniels, Boston Celtics\n\n4 of 56\n\nDaniels was traded to the Sacramento Kings after a devastating on court injury that ended his season, but he's got no hard feelings and is bound to return to Boston.\n\nThe Celtics will bring back the swingman on a one-year deal, and it makes sense considering Daniels has a strong familiarity with the coaching staff, players and system in Boston.\n\nJonas Jerebko, Detroit Pistons\n\n5 of 56\n\nJerebko missed the entire 2010-11 season due to a ruptured Achilles tendon, but that didn't prevent the Pistons from seeing his potential to contribute going forward.\n\nHe will be back in Detroit for the foreseeable future after agreeing to a four-year contract, and it's a deal that will likely emerge as a serious bargain as long as Jerebko stays healthy.\n\nTayshaun Prince, Detroit Pistons\n\n6 of 56\n\nThe Pistons have Austin Daye waiting in the wings, and despite man predicting that Prince would be moving on to another team, he will remain in Detroit for the next four seasons.\n\nThe versatile forward agreed to a new contract with the Pistons, and it will be interesting to see how Lawrence Frank plans to use all of his forwards on a nightly basis.\n\nShannon Brown, Phoenix Suns\n\n7 of 56\n\nBrown wowed a lot of fans in Los Angeles with his athleticism and highlight-reel dunks, but the Lakers didn't figure to have a chance at retaining him after he opted out of his contract prior to the lockout.\n\nAlthough he signed just a one-year deal with the Suns, his reported salary of $3.5 million was something that the Lakers would've likely never felt comfortable giving him.\n\nHis high flying fastbreak act will be an excellent fit for the Steve Nash-led backcourt.\n\nT.J. Ford, San Antonio Spurs\n\n8 of 56\n\nFord was wasted with the Pacers on a team that didn't give him a chance to play, and now he'll have a legitimate opportunity to contribute for his new club.\n\nThe point guard will sign a one-year deal in San Antonio to serve as Tony Parker's backup, and it's another example of a shrewd signing by GM R.C. Buford.\n\nSebastian Telfair, Phoenix Suns\n\n9 of 56\n\nTeflair has bounced around the league and has yet to find a home, but it's possible that his next destination will allow him to finally secure stable footing.\n\nThe Phoenix Suns agreed to a one-year deal with Telfair, and after losing Aaron Brooks to China for the season, it's a low-risk move that could pay off for both parties.\n\nTracy McGrady, Atlanta Hawks\n\n10 of 56\n\nIt's shocking that there weren't more teams interested in bringing Tracy McGrady aboard considering he signed with Atlanta for just the veteran's minimum.\n\nMcGrady can be a versatile asset for the Hawks capable of playing multiple positions, and that's going to be especially important following Kirk Hinrich's shoulder surgery and Marvin Williams' inconsistent play.\n\nMike Dunleavy, Milwaukee Bucks\n\n11 of 56\n\nDunleavy got a two-year commitment from Milwaukee, and while the contract is not one that is entirely egregious, it doesn't really make a ton of sense.\n\nThe team has Carlos Delfino and Ersan Ilyasova along the front line already, and considering Dunelavy's recent health issues, it will be interesting to see how he is deployed for the Bucks.\n\nGreg Oden, Portland Trail Blazers\n\n12 of 56\n\nOden was never going to collect anywhere near salary he is getting to return to Portland by accepting his qualifying contract offer, and it's not a surprise to see him return for a single season.\n\nIt's amazing to think that a player who had participated in just 82 regular season games will make about $9 million, but that's the enormous upside Oden (when healthy) possesses.\n\nRoger Mason, Washington Wizards\n\n13 of 56\n\nMason is infamous for his role during the lockout, but he it should be noted that he is a solid veteran to add to a young locker room and can still serve to stretch the floor in the second unit.\n\nHe'll return to the Wizards for a season after spending time in New York with the Knicks, and he should be a good mentor for a team that boasts a ton of youth.\n\nJason Kapono, Los Angeles Lakers\n\n14 of 56\n\nKapono was seldom used in Philadelphia on a team that had no use for him, but he'll have a very distinct role with his new club in Los Angeles.\n\nThe local product agreed to a one-year contract to join the Lakers, and he will help to stretch the floor in the second unit, something the team had serious issues doing during the 2010-11 season.\n\nJames Jones, Miami Heat\n\n15 of 56\n\nJones would have made for a nice sharpshooter off the bench for a contender looking to upgrade in the second unit, but Jones couldn't leave the allure of Miami behind.\n\nThe veteran took a three-year deal to remain with the Heat, and the club that lost in the Finals last season suddenly looks a lot deeper than this group ever was previously.\n\nGrant Hill, Phoenix Suns\n\n16 of 56\n\nMany fans would love to see Hill finally get a chance to join a championship contender, and while he flirted with the notion of going elsewhere, the 39-year old couldn't leave the Suns behind.\n\nHe'll sign a ridiculously lucrative contract for a single season, and while it's possible this might not be his last season, retirement remains a definite possibility following the campaign.\n\nMarcus Thornton, Sacramento Kings\n\n17 of 56\n\nThornton was a restricted free agent, so even if another club had signed him to an offer sheet, the Kings were always going to have an opportunity to match.\n\nHowever, it didn't even get to that phase, and Thornton agreed to a four-year $33 million contract with Sacramento and will continue to serve as a volume scorer for the club.\n\nGlen Davis, Orlando Magic\n\n18 of 56\n\nDavis was never anywhere near a slam dunk to return to the Celtics, so the fact that the team was able to flip him to Orlando in a sign-and-trade deal to net Brandon Bass in return is nothing short of remarkable.\n\nBig Baby's new pay day with the Magic comes with an awful lot of commitment as the team is prepared to hand him $26 million over the next four seasons to play a sizable role, something he hasn't done consistently over the course of his career.\n\nDaequan Cook, Oklahoma City Thunder\n\n19 of 56\n\nCook was a restricted free agent, and as a sharpshooter who can space the floor in the second unit, he is a valuable asset to the Thunder reserve group on the wing.\n\nOklahoma City closed on a two-year contract worth $7.5 million with Cook to keep him on the roster, and it's another example of GM Sam Presti continuing to build one of the deepest teams in the NBA.\n\nJ.J. Barea, Minnesota Timberwolves\n\n20 of 56\n\nBarea was inevitably going to get overpaid by some team willing to gamble on his postseason play coming off of a championship run with Dallas, and we all should've expected it to be David Kahn.\n\nThe pint-sized guard is putting the finishing touches on a four-year, $19 million deal with the Timberwolves that will give Minnesota yet another guard and create a serious size problem if he and Ricky Rubio are on the court at the same time.\n\nDavid West, Indiana Pacers\n\n21 of 56\n\nWest seemed destined to head to Boston before a sign-and-trade deal fell through, but it didn't take long for him to find a new home.\n\nThe veteran power forward inked a two-year, $20 million contract with the Pacers, and it's a win-win situation for both parties as neither is locked into a long-term commitment.\n\nKurt Thomas, Portland Trail Blazers\n\n22 of 56\n\nThomas is the league's oldest player at 39 years young, but that didn't prevent him from securing a two-year deal following a successful season in Chicago.\n\nAlthough Thomas was thought to be mulling a return to the Bulls, the Blazers swooped in with a two-year offer and the prospect of serious playing time after it was revealed Greg Oden had a setback in his road to return to the court.\n\nMike Bibby, New York Knicks\n\n23 of 56\n\nBibby looked like his career was coming to a close after finishing last season in Miami with the Heat, but New York needed a point guard and the team doesn't have much cap flexibility at its disposal.\n\nThe veteran agreed to a one-year deal with the Knicks to serve as help at the position with Chauncey Billups no longer on the roster, but he's a rather uninspiring option if he has to spend time as the starter.\n\nJason Richardson, Orlando Magic\n\n24 of 56\n\nRichardson had been pegged for a different team since the free agency period opened up, so it was a bit surprising to see him return to an Orlando team that won't have Dwight Howard for the future.\n\nThe shooting guard agreed to stay with the Magic for four years and $25 million, and he'll remain the team's starter at the position for the foreseeable future.\n\nJeff Green, Boston Celtics\n\n25 of 56\n\nGreen didn't transition well upon his initial arrival into Boston last season, but that didn't prevent the team from penciling him into the plans for the plans this year.\n\nHe signed a one-year, $9 million deal to remain with the Celtics, and although that's a gross overpay, Boston was able to preserve cap flexibility for the 2012 offseason and retain Green for one final championship run with the current core.\n\nLuc Richard Mbah a Moute\n\n26 of 56\n\nMbah a Moute is a much better perimeter defender than most seem to give him credit for, and the Nuggets likely knew that when the team signed him to a four-year, $19 million offer sheet.\n\nHowever, Milwaukee wasted almost no time in matching the contract, meaning that he'll return to the Bucks for the next four seasons.\n\nSpencer Hawes, Philadelphia 76ers\n\n27 of 56\n\nHawes didn't seem to generate a ton of interest on the open market as a restricted free agent, and he decided to hit the market once again next season as an unrestricted free agent.\n\nIn order to do that, Hawes signed his qualifying contract offer with the Sixers, and he'll return to Philadelphia for at least one more year.\n\nAaron Gray, Toronto Raptors\n\n28 of 56\n\nGray's name was kicked around as a cheap option for clubs without a lot of cap space and a need for help beneath the basket, but that's not the route he chose to go.\n\nGray signed a one-year deal with the Toronto Raptors, and the club is probably just looking for an efficient way to address the need for another big man before Jonas Valanciunas arrives in 2012-13.\n\nEddy Curry, Miami Heat\n\n29 of 56\n\nThe speculation surrounding Curry potentially joining Miami's roster has been there for a couple of seasons, and now his arrival is official.\n\nThe Heat inked the veteran big man to a one-year contract, and it will be very interesting to see what he brings to the table after reportedly losing 70 lbs from his frame.\n\nVince Carter, Dallas Mavericks\n\n30 of 56\n\nCarter may be nearing the end of his career, but that doesn't mean that he can't contribute to the right team when placed in the proper situation.\n\nThe veteran signed a one-year deal to join the defending champion Dallas Mavericks for the 2011-12 season, and he will now join the same back court as Jason Kidd to create a timeless pairing.\n\nDeAndre Jordan, Los Angeles Clippers\n\n31 of 56\n\nJordan was a restricted free agent destined to receive a major pay increase from his previous contract, and the Clippers had no choice but to match the offer sheet he signed with Golden State.\n\nAfter the Warriors signed him to a four-year deal worth approximately $43 million, Los Angeles waited almost no time at all to match it.\n\nIt shouldn't be surprising given that the team was never going to let him walk out the door.\n\nDelonte West, Dallas Mavericks\n\n32 of 56\n\nWest enjoyed an up-and-down season with the Celtics, but he has value as a guard who is capable of backing up either guard position for a team.\n\nThe Mavericks kept stacking depth at the end of the bench when it was announced he had a deal with Dallas for a single season, and he should prove to be a nice low-risk addition.\n\nKwame Brown, Golden State Warriors\n\n33 of 56\n\nSize matters in the NBA, and there may be no better evidence to illustrate that point than the one-year contract Brown just signed with Golden State.\n\nThe Warriors gave the well-traveled big man a whopping $7 million for just a single season, and the team now has $16 million in salary invested in Brown and incumbent Andris Biedrins for the 2011-12 campaign.\n\nMarc Gasol, Memphis Grizzlies\n\n34 of 56\n\nGasol was never a candidate to realistically leave the Grizzlies considering the team wanted to re-sign him and he was a restricted free agent.\n\nThe center took to his Twitter account to share the news that he had agreed to a new four-year contract which would keep him in Memphis, and this is a team that's going to a lot of fun to watch in the coming seasons.\n\nJosh McRoberts, Los Angeles Lakers\n\n35 of 56\n\nMcRoberts may not be the big man addition that Lakers fans were hoping for, but he does provide both youth and depth to a team that didn't have much of either.\n\nHe'll join Los Angeles on a two-year contract worth the full mini midlevel exception, and he will serve as very valuable insurance behind Andrew Bynum and Pau Gasol.\n\nNene, Denver Nuggets\n\n36 of 56\n\nNene was rumored to be heading to a number of different destinations, but in the end, he decided that remaining in familiar surroundings was the best fit for him.\n\nThe big man is returning to Denver on a five-year contract worth $67 million, and it sounds like the team's decision to offer him a fifth season pushed the negotiations to an end point.\n\nGary Forbes, Toronto Raptors\n\n37 of 56\n\nForbes emerged as a legitimate contributor off the bench with Denver last season, and he parlayed that into a multi-year pact with the Toronto Raptors.\n\nThe swingman singed a two-year deal (with a team option for the third year) in Canada, and he represents a nice low-cost addition for the club to build depth.\n\nMarco Belinelli, New Orleans Hornets\n\n38 of 56\n\nBelinelli didn't find the market for shooting guards developing as he may have hoped, so he's decided to return to his previous stomping grounds.\n\nThe sharpshooter accepted his one-year qualifying offer from the Hornets and will now enter the 2012 offseason as an unrestricted free agent when more teams have cap space to spare.\n\nRichard Hamilton, Chicago Bulls\n\n39 of 56\n\nHamilton was known to want out of Detroit following a tumultuous season there in 2010-11, and he got his wish when the team bought him out of his contract.\n\nIt didn't take long for the veteran to make his decision, and he signed a two-year, $10 million deal to join Derrick Rose and form a formidable tandem in the Chicago starting five.\n\nEarl Clark, Orlando Magic\n\n40 of 56\n\nClark finally got an opportunity to contribute with the Magic last season after not getting a chance in Phoenix, and he left enough of an impression with the team to warrant his return to the roster.\n\nThe swing forward has agreed to re-sign with Orlando for two years, and it'll be interesting to see how his playing time shakes out given the current compilation of the big men on the roster.\n\nShawne Williams, New Jersey Nets\n\n41 of 56\n\nWilliams showed why he was a previous first round draft pick back in 2006 with the Knicks last season, and he was able to parlay that success into a bigger opportunity for this season.\n\nHe bolted New York and is headed to New Jersey, where he'll have a definite chance at sustainable playing time and has agreed to a two-year contract.\n\nCarl Landry, New Orleans Hornets\n\n42 of 56\n\nLandry had several teams interested in his services, but in the end, he decided to take a short-term deal to remain where he finished last season.\n\nThe undersized forward has agreed to a one-year contract worth nearly $9 million to help anchor the New Orleans front line, and it's a move that should benefit both sides rather favorably.\n\nReggie Williams, Charlotte Bobcats\n\n43 of 56\n\nWilliams went to a team that sorely needed offense, and it's a good fit considering what he does best is score when deployed for action.\n\nThe swingman agreed to a two-year contract to join Charlotte, and he should anchor the scoring in the second unit given that the team doesn't have any attractive alternatives in that role.\n\nJamal Crawford, Portland Trail Blazers\n\n44 of 56\n\nCrawford was heavily expected to be strongly considering Portland on his final list of teams, and he finally made it official when he announced the decision on his Twitter page.\n\nHe's getting $5 million for the first season of his contract, and there will be a player option for the same value should he seek to return at that price the following year.\n\nCraig Smith, Portland Trail Blazers\n\n45 of 56\n\nBetter known as \"the Rhino\" by some around the league, Smith has flown underneath the radar during his time with the Clippers as a reliable backup big man capable of providing energy off the bench.\n\nMaurice Evans, Washington Wizards\n\n46 of 56\n\nThe swingman will return to Washington on a one-year contract with the Wizards, and he'll serve as a mentor for a team that has an abundance of youth on the roster.\n\nJosh Howard, Utah Jazz\n\n47 of 56\n\nHoward drew interest from a number of teams looking for support on the wing, but an opportunity for legitimate playing time almost certainly played a role in his decision.\n\nHe's headed to Utah on a one-year deal with the Jazz, and he'll be looking to return to previous form while shedding the injury-plagued label he has garnered in recent seasons.\n\nTroy Murphy, Los Angeles Lakers\n\n48 of 56\n\nMurphy was a disappointing addition for Boston last season when the Celtics added him following a buyout from New Jersey, but he'll be looking to rebound on the west coast this year.\n\nThe veteran power forward reached a one-year agreement with the Lakers, and he'll help to stretch the floor in the second unit along with fellow newcomer Jason Kapono.\n\nRodney Stuckey, Detroit Pistons\n\n49 of 56\n\nStuckey and the Pistons were seemingly headed for some muddy waters after the two parties were at a standstill in contract negotiations, but that didn't last very long.\n\nWith the season right around the corner, the two parties were able to come to a middle ground that will keep Stuckey in Detroit for another three years at the price of $25 million.\n\nBaron Davis, New York Knicks\n\n50 of 56\n\nDavis was waived using the amnesty clause by Cleveland, but it didn't take him very long to find a much more attractive home for himself at this stage of his career.\n\nHe signed a one-year deal for the veteran's minimum to join the New York Knicks, and despite reports that his bad back will take some time to heal, this is a great example of a low-risk signing that could really have huge benefits in the long run.\n\nNick Young, Washington Wizards\n\n51 of 56\n\nYoung didn't really come out of his shell until last season, when he decided to absolutely explode and emerge as a legitimate scoring threat for the Wizards.\n\nHe was expecting to secure a multi-year deal at a high annual average value, but he couldn't find one to his liking, and will now play out the season on his one-year qualifying contract offer.\n\nYoung will be an unrestricted free agent in 2012.\n\nKris Humphries, New Jersey Nets\n\n52 of 56\n\nIt may have taken slightly longer than Humphries expected, but his breakout season with the Nets last season earned him a very solid pay raise for the coming year.\n\nHe'll return to New Jersey on a one-year deal, and at $8 million, Humphries will have to prove that his coming out party last year was not just a fluke.\n\nArron Afflalo, Denver Nuggets\n\n53 of 56\n\nAfflalo was one of the best free agent options available for teams looking to upgrade at shooting guard, but his restricted status may have kept a number of franchises from investigating the possibility too closely.\n\nIt was heavily expected that he'd return to Denver, and Afflalo did just that when he signed a five-year, $43 million contract with the team to remain a member of the Nuggets for the long haul.\n\nReggie Evans, Los Angeles Clippers\n\n54 of 56\n\nEvans is a force on the glass who will bring energy to the second unit, and he landed in a really nice spot when he decided to join the Clippers.\n\nHe has agreed to sign a one-year deal worth the veteran's minimum to serve as depth behind Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan, and he should fit onto the roster rather nicely for Los Angeles.\n\nDeShawn Stevenson, New Jersey Nets\n\n55 of 56\n\nStevenson took a while to find a new contract despite coming off of a championship season with Dallas, but he finally found a deal to his liking with just days until the season starts.\n\nThe defensively-oriented swingman signed a one-year, $2.5 million deal to become a member of the New Jersey Nets, and he'll help with some support on the wing behind Shawne Williams and Damion James.\n\nSamuel Dalembert, Houston Rockets\n\n56 of 56\n\nDalembert looked like he was headed back to Sacramento after the Kings voided the contract of Chuck Hayes, but Houston stepped up its efforts to reel in the big man.\n\nThe Rockets would've been ridiculously foolish to begin the season with a combination of Jordan Hill and Hasheem Thabeet in the middle, so the team stepped up and signed Dalembert to a two-year deal.\n\nX"
