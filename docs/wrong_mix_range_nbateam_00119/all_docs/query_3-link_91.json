        "text": "NBA Preview: Atlantic Division\n\nby Gil Roth\n\nBoston Celtics\n\nDanny Ainge is a goddamn idiot. For years now, Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks has played a high-stakes game with his players’ contracts: he tends to overpay, but at least he keeps enough desirable assets on hand that teams would take on one of his bad contracts just get the rights to one of his useful players.\n\nA few years ago, I thought that practice would crash and burn, because Cuban gave Raef LaFrentz a 6-year/$60 million deal. No one would take that contract off his hands, I figured, reducing the Mavs’ flexibility for years.\n\nWhat happens? Boston GM Ainge trades for him, sending back Antoine Walker’s contract, which Cuban just parlayed into an affordable scoring point guard in Jason Terry, and another expiring contract in Alan Henderson. The rich get richer, and the poor get a Mormon.\n\nAinge, not content to saddle Boston with a gigantic contract for a player who can barely play, went on to make several more deals, driving his coach to quit in mid-season. The upshot? His team now features one legit star (Paul Pierce(d), who is the most sullen top-12 talent in the league), one knuckledheaded but unstoppable talent (Ricky Davis), and one over-the-hill-but-too-prideful-to-admit-it malcontent (Gary Payton, who seems to have entered the weight room exactly once in his career, and that was only to grab a dumbbell to throw at teammate Vernon Maxwell). To recap: that’s three pouting egomaniacs who need the ball to be effective now taking up the 1, 2 and 3 positions on the “once-proud” Boston franchise. Recipe for disaster, coming right up!\n\nThey’ve also got a bunch of young draft picks, including some 18-year-old who was putting up Chamberlain-like numbers in high school (like 42 ppg and 19 rpg). This team could feature a reprise of Gary Vs. Vernon, with Ricky filling in for Mad Max. I’d pay $34.95 to see that one on Pay-Per-View, but I’m not right in the head.\n\nNew York Knicks\n\nThe Knicks floundered for a few years, and then brought in Isiah Thomas last year as GM, and he shook things up. Unfortunately, he ended up with lots of offense, but no coherent defensive philosophy. That’s death in the NBA. This offseason, he traded all of his expiring contracts (the most important asset for trades) for Jamal Crawford, a wanna-be point guard (see Rose, Jalen) who can score in bunches but doesn’t shoot a high percentage.\n\nHe oughtta get along great with Stephon Marbury. And Tim Thomas. And Penny Hardaway. And Allan Houston, if he ever comes back from knee surgery. Speaking of too much offense, this squad actually includes three players who’ve put up 50 in a night (Crawford, Marbury and Houston). Given how bad their defense is, they might need all three of them to do that if they want to win.\n\nSupposedly, they have a rookie who’s a great leaper and electrifying player, but seriousy, those are a dime a dozen. Tamar Slay and Lavorr Postell were two recent ones who played for NJ and NY, and they didn’t catch on really because they don’t have an awful lot of talent.\n\nThe team’s top pick last year, Michael Sweetney, looks too doughy to be a good power forward, but he looks better than the team’s centers, Nazr Mohammad and Vin Baker, who’s recovering from heart surgery, alcoholism, and the fact that his drinking cost him at least $35 million.\n\nIf they can somehow learn to play D (not likely under Lenny Wilkens), maybe they’ll win this weak-ass division and get swept in the first round by a more organized, better-disciplined team (almost any of the other 14 squads in the east).\n\nNew Jersey Nets\n\nDon’t get me started. I wrote a lengthy diatribe against this team and its horrible offseason, and then they got worse. Two of last year’s starters are gone, Jason Kidd is recovering from a knee injury, and their centerâ€”whom they signed for $22 million despite a deteriorating kidney conditionâ€”has announced that he wants the team to pay him most of the money and let him leave so he can sign somewhere else to try to win a championship.\n\nThe only positive on the squad is Richard Jefferson, who got a pretty lucrative extension in the offseason. He’s an amazing talent, but he’s going to be burned out by carrying too heavy a load in the first months of the year (provided Kidd comes back and contributes a bit before he gets traded to Dallas (Jason Terry and spare parts) or Denver (Andre Miller and Marcus Camby).\n\nOtherwise, it’s a pretty terrible roster, filled with role players and no big talents, including one guy who has played on seven teams in his first eight seasons.\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers\n\nAllen Iverson is the biggest enigma I’ve ever seen in the NBA. He flat-out cannot play with any teammate who deserves more than role-player status. Oh, he’s fine when you surround him with defensive guards, shot-blockers, rebounders, and perimeter defenders, but just try to send in a single player with a scoring dimension, and it all melts down. Want a list? Try Jerry Stackhouse, Tim Thomas, Larry Hughes, Toni Kukoc, Keith Van Horn, and most recently, Glenn “Antoine Carr” Robinson. Now, the big tip-off should’ve been when he couldn’t get along with Kukoc. Unfortunately, they traded the Croatian Creation for the Mongo from the Congo (Dikembe Mutombo) and reached the NBA finals that year, so people seemed to think that it made sense to keep surrounding Iverson with role players who wouldn’t get in his way.\n\nOf course, he started breaking downâ€”a natural result of relying on natural speed and quickness and never bothering to work outâ€”and the team began deteriorating. Now, they’ve got a defensive-minded coach who’s already worked in one of the most bizarre scenarios in hoops: the Boston Celtics of Pierce-Walker vintage, which featured two uncontrollable outside scorers and little else. Coach O’Brien somehow brought this strange group to the eastern finals a few seasons ago; no one is sure how.\n\nThe belief is that he’ll get the Sixers playing tough defense, and let the scoring work itself out. If Iverson stays healthy enough to play 75-80 games, they might be alright. The coach has already benched (prelude to a dumping) Glenn Robinson in favor of some defensive-minded rookie. Weirdly, he also benched defensive-minded center Samuel Dalembert, the Haitian Croatian, for Marc “Don’t Call Me Mark” Jackson, who doesn’t play D but loves to shoot 12-footers.\n\nI have no idea how all this is going to turn out, especially since Robinson seems pissed off and might end up getting waived, but I think they’ll win the weak division, and get home court in the first round.\n\nToronto Raptors\n\nLong-term, this team is doomed. A few years ago, ownership overpaid a bunch of players just to induce star swingman Vince Carter to stay. Carter then turned out to be moody, brittle, and too eager to settle for a jump-shot, moody. Worse, the guys they overpaid (Jerome Williams, Antonio Davis, Alvin Williams) weren’t very good. They made a nice pick in the draft last year with Chris Bosh, who reminds me a little of Jermaine O’Neal, but they managed to trade one headache (Antonio Davis and his bloated contract) for another in the person of Jalen Rose, a me-first scorer who spent nearly a decade trying to convince coaches that he was really a point guard, but who’s yet to make another player better in his career.\n\nSo now the Raptors are built around Carter and Rose, who have gigantic contracts, and Bosh and Donyell Marshall, who’s developed into a solid contributor in his last few seasons (since he spent time in Utah with Jerry Sloan, about whom Tom was correct). They’d love to get rid of Rose, but there’s no one who’d take him, and Carter wants to be traded, but ownership knows that the fans would leave along with Carter, since he still dunks really hard, when he’s not being a sissy and firing up 20-footers.\n\nToronto does get bonus points for signing Rafer “Skip to my Lou” Alston, but that won’t be enough for them to reach the playoffs. For that, Carter’s gotta return to the monster threat he was a few seasons ago.\n\nMore on the NBA\n\nby Aaron Finkelstein\n\nExcellent reportage [in the NBA western previews], but in what sense does Shawn Bradley qualify as â€œmarginally talented?â€ He does throw a really accurate elbow, but if it werenâ€™t for Don Nelson, Bradley would be toting a sandwich board somewhere outside Topeka, or holding hands with a midget in some bumpkin carny. Heâ€™s been in the league for more than a decade, and every time he takes the floor I see him do something that convinces me heâ€™s never even seen a basketball before in his life. Itâ€™s just astounding.\n\nDon Nelson makes me miss Buddy Ryan, who I like to think can be found in secret bunker somewhere beneath the Painted Desert, stroking a white Persian cat and chuckling insanely to himself.\n\nIâ€™m disappointed that I can find no combination of letters in a Google search that prompts it to ask â€œDid you mean â€˜Mxyzptlk?â€™â€ That one line about Bzdelik has rendered me completely unable to watch Nuggets games this season. Honest. It has absolutely nothing to do with mopey Marcus Camby, â€˜Meloâ€™s unsettling resemblance to Seattle Storm Favorite Daughter Betty Dixon, or the cosmic surreality of seeing K-Mart in a Denver uniform.\n\nItâ€™s increasingly confounding to me how you lose 60+ games with Tracy McGrady. On the other hand, there may not be a better place than Houston if youâ€™re going to cleave to the â€œdribble around, jump nine feet in the air as soon as you see daylight, and then figure out what to do with the ballâ€ school of NBA play. And speaking of Kobe Bryant, every time I Â flipped over to the Lakers game last night I wondered how they could forget to give the dunking mascots their trampoline. Iâ€™ve never seen anything like it. L.A.â€™s in for the most entertaining .300 season in NBA history.\n\n* * *\n\nFink’s Sonics Preview\n\nNate McMillanâ€™s been seeding his farewell speech for about a month now. I suffer from poor digestion, and so was unable to watch the Sonics more than about once a week last season, but I canâ€™t shake the impression that McMillan hasnâ€™t he faintest idea what the heck heâ€™s doing. This comes as little surprise to those of us who know he was hired on suspicion of being able to get Gary Payton to stay, and because heâ€™s the only fan favorite since â€˜78 who is remotely likeable or could pass a criminal background check. Given a choice between arm-folding (to which Nate brings a brooding stoicism that could almost be described as contemplative if he werenâ€™t always murderously pissed off) and finding-oneâ€™s-ass-with-both-hands, Iâ€™d be inclined to take the latter. Sure, we all whine about not having a post threat and the staggering amount of payroll wasted on three guys who could be smelted into a center slightly worse than Rick Smits; but I believe Nateâ€™s squad last year was talented enough to look like a basketball team for more than two games in a row if he could MAKE UP HIS GODDAMN MIND ABOUT ANYTHING.\n\nRashard Lewis is about to embark on his fifth â€œbreakout year,â€ but to be fair itâ€™ll only be his second full season playing a position heâ€™s remotely suited for. And starting your career in an offense run by Payton can mess up your game for a long long time. Just ask Desmond Mason.\n\nReggie Evans suffered terribly from Nateâ€™s inability to see that if youâ€™re losing 100+ point games in the last two minutes, scoring is not your problem, and taking a voracious rebounder and your foremost energy player offÂ the bench just might not kill you, even if he is an offensive liability.\n\nThe departure of Calvin Booth means the mediocrity at center is now merely bipolar, which should clarify matters enough that Nate might play the same guy for as much as a whole week at a time.\n\nDanny Fortson might not accidentally kill anybody, and if he does, thereâ€™s a better than average chance it wonâ€™t be one of is teammates. Nick Collison and Lilâ€™ Robby Swift clearly have their hearts set on being basketball players when they grow up. Management will have sold them for scrap metal and a deli tray before that happens, of course.\n\nLuke Ridenour should continue to improve this season, despite taking time off mid-year to star in a remake of â€œMy Bodyguard.â€ This is a shame, because Antonio Daniels is an actual point guard, and one that defends, no less. Heâ€™s tough, quiet, hardworking, and exactly the kind of player this city of basketball morons doesnâ€™t notice. Itâ€™s a little confusing to all of us that Nate appears to actively hate him.\n\nI donâ€™t know what to do with Vladimir Radmanovic. Heâ€™s the other side of the Euro: he comes out of a youth academy that drilled him so mercilessly on fundamental basketball that he appears to have no instinct on the court. People think he doesnâ€™t hustle, but I expect that the sight of a loose ball still comes as kind of a surprise to him. Plus heâ€™s, like, Jessica Simpsonâ€™s age. Iâ€™d just hate to see them move him out of pique (for peanuts, naturally) and than have him turn into the newest edition of the Slavic Instant Mis-Match. (I ask you to do nothing to disturb my blissful ignorance of how pointless it is to fit him into a lineup that includes Ray Allen and Lewis.)\n\nI miss Brent “Bones” Barry like a brother, but he looked swell in the LA/Sac game last night. My only hope is that it occurred to someone to exact his promise that heâ€™d return for his broadcasting career. I figure he can continue the grand tradition of Killer Zombie Broadcasters like Hubie Brown and Doug Collins.\n\nI refuse to acknowledge the presence of Dominqueâ€™s kid until he does something more interesting with his hair.\n\nNBA Preview: Central Division\n\nby Gil Roth\n\nChicago Bulls\n\nA few seasons ago, the Bulls made a huge gamble in the draft. With two of the top four picks, they took high school big men Tyson Chandler and Eddy Curry. The idea was that both would develop into legit bigs, and the team would be set at the PF and C positions for the next 10-15 years.\n\nTurns out they suck. Curry’s been fat and unmotivated till this season (his contract year), while Chandler just wasn’t as good against NBA talent as he was against 6’4″ white high school kids. I remember him saying, in his first NBA game, that he didn’t imagine how strong the players were. He said something to the effect of, “There was a missed shot, and I was going to go up for a rebound, but Karl Malone put his hand on my hip, and I couldn’t jump off the floor.”\n\nThe problem wasn’t necessarily that the Bulls drafted a pair of high school bigs, it was that they didn’t have any real veterans on that team to bring the kids along. They gambled that a couple of 18-year-old, seven-foot-tall kids, guaranteed millions of dollars, would find the motivation to become good players in the offseason. Instead of buying fake IDs or spending their time playing Grand Theft Auto.\n\nSo this year, the team drafted a couple of older players, and is trying to emulate the tough mentality of its coach, Scott Skiles, who still improbably enough holds the NBA single-game records for assists. Last year, the Bulls were a sexy/sleeper pick for the playoffs. This year, everyone expects them to lose, trade at least one of the bigs (I bet Curry goes to Memphis), and commence their 87th rebuilding effort since Jordan’s retirement.\n\nCleveland Cavaliers\n\nThey made one of the most boneheaded offseason moves ever, voiding a year off the contract of hyper-productive power forward Carlos Boozer, so they could give him a big, long-term deal. Not only is such an arrangement illegal in the NBA, which would’ve led to league sanctions, Boozer burned them by skipping town for Utah! In a panic, they traded for another young PF in Drew Gooden, despite the fact that he’s regarded as one of the dumbest players in the league. They’re backing him up with Robert “Tractor” Traylor, one of the fattest players in the league, so maybe they were trying for some Laurel & Hardy vibe.\n\nFortunately, they have the best young player around, in LeBron James. The team tried to set up the 6’8″ high schooler as its point guard last year, which proves Drew Gooden might not be the only dumb person associated with the Cavs. They smartened up and moved him to the shooting guard and small forward spots, bringing in Jeff McInnis last year and trading for his polar opposite, Eric Snow, this offseason. James, without having to be responsible for all the ballhandling, will still get a bunch of assists, because that’s what good players do, and he’s a heck of a player.\n\nThe Cavs should do alright this year, and I’d be surprised if they don’t make the playoffs. They still possess one of the few remaining legitimate centers in the league in Zydrunas Ilgausakas, whose name used to be the password protection I built into PDFs so they couldn’t be pirated.\n\nDetroit Pistons\n\nI’m starting to think that this team could be the New England Patriots of the NBA. They won’t put up a winning streak like the Pats’, but they seem to have a management that gets it. They won a championship with role players, which is absolutely insane in the NBA, which has been star-driven for decades. Their best scorer is terrible at the 3-pointer, which everyone else in the league seems to love. Their center couldn’t score in double-digits if my mom was guarding him. Their point guard played for five teams in his first six years, has never averaged 6apg, and is named Chauncey. Their small forward looks like Condorman. Their power forward was once regarded as everything that’s wrong with the NBA (which gives Ron Artest some hope for redemption).\n\nBut Larry Brown got them playing ball as a team, focusing on each other’s strengths and covering up weaknesses, and they pulled off an amazing upset against LA last summer. In the offseason, they seem to have gotten even stronger, bringing in Antonio McDyess as a backup PF (he’ll play well in limited minutes, after all his knee trouble), and some Argentinean guy named Carlos. The most crucial fact is that they still have Darvin “Slam Bam I Am” Ham, who’s my favorite college player of all time.\n\nFree Darko!\n\nIndiana Pacers\n\nIt’s the farewell tour for “F— You” Reggie Miller! The Pacers believe they were one knee-tweak to Jermaine O’Neal away from getting to the Finals last year, which avoids the reality that Ron Artest is a freaking maniac whom David Stern would’ve given his left arm to keep out of the NBA’s biggest stage.\n\nDuring the Eastern Conference finals last season, Artest gave a forearm shiver to Richard Hamilton, committing a flagrant foul that helped submarine his team. The weird thing about it (people still expect Artest flameouts) is that he threw his forearm while staring directly at the ref with a blank expression. The replay was really demented, because Artest looked sorta like a “troubled” child who deliberately does something wrong in front of his parents. It’s like he was begging to get caught, so he could be thrown out and not have to deal with the pressure.\n\nAnd he’s the #2 guy on this squad, although he contends that he’s the MVP of the league. Great talent, no head: the Jeff George of the NBA.\n\nA few years before the Bulls blew their future on a pair of high school big men, the Pacers traded their aging C/PF Antonio Davis away for a #5 draft pick, which they used on a 7-foot-tall high school kid named Jonathan Bender. He was touted as “the next Kevin Garnett,” and the team’s still waiting for him to have a good year, going into his sixth season. I’m pretty sure that Garnett averaged more than 5.7 ppg, 2.3 rpg and 0.7 apg in his first five years.\n\nThe novelty about Bender was supposed to be that he could play every position, and exploit mismatches everywhere. This is one of those things that burns my ass about the NBA: almost no one seems to excel at any one position. When I’ve got a blue-collar rebounder who’s willing to mix it up down low and come up with 12 rebounds a night, like Troy Murphy out in Golden State, I don’t tell him to work on his 3-point shot during the offseason. Get a reliable 12-foot jumper, maybe, but don’t work on skills that are going to leave you on the perimeter of the game, unable to do to the one thing you do really well.\n\nI’m ranting. Anyway, my complaint is that I’ve yet to figure out what Bender’s supposed to be good at. Being “an athlete” isn’t enough in the NBA, but you wouldn’t know it from some of the contracts that have been tossed out there.\n\nPacers will be in the top two in the east again this year, because a lot of the competition sucks, and they have some pretty good components. I still don’t trust ’em under real pressure, because I think Artest will explode, and O’Neal’s too in love with his jumper (and a little too fragile).\n\nI think Jonathan Bender will have a break-out season.\n\nMilwaukee Bucks\n\nMajor surprise team last year. They went into a big cost-cutting mode, but still managed to win a ton of games in the really terrible Eastern Conference. They even managed to win when they had two of the greatest modern underachievers in the league on the same squad: Keith Van Horn and Joe Smith. The key was a rookie point guard named TJ Ford, but he’s out with a bruised spinal cord (ow), and I’m betting they don’t win a whole lot this year. Plus, they have to spend their winters in Milwaukee. On the positive side, they do have one of those great character guys who can actually produce, in Michael Redd.\n\nNBA Preview: Southeast Division\n\nby Gil Roth\n\nAtlanta Hawks\n\nThis team’s been in rebuilding mode since the end of the 1999 season, when it was the worst second-round playoff team in NBA history. In the latest mode, the Hawks traded for Al Harrington, whom I used to believe was the best player on the Pacers, and Antoine Walker, a power forward who doesn’t rebound, handles the ball too much, and fires up epic amounts of three-pointers (until last year, when he was traded to the Bizarro world, and spent most of the season confused).\n\nHarrington’s one of those ‘tweener high school draftees. With a few years of college, he might’ve refined his game and been a strong player in the league. Instead, he’s spent years bouncing between the forward spots on Indiana, never really seizing his chance to be a regular contributor. My opinion of him plummeted during the 2002-2003 playoffs, when Indiana got pantsed by Boston.\n\nUltimately, the Hawks are hoping Harrington will develop into the #1 option, and that Antoine Walker will walk at the end of the season. The latter event will leave the team with tons of cap space that free agents can use to get bigger contracts from teams that they actually want to play for.\n\nThis team will be terrible, but at least they won’t disappoint the fans; there aren’t any.\n\nCharlotte Bobcats\n\nEvery couple of years, someone touts a squad as a challenger for Worst Team Ever, giving it a shot at winning fewer than 9 games (a mark set by the 1972-73 Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nLast year, many figured that Utah, missing Stockton and Malone, would break the record. In fact, I was among that number. I was in Salt Lake City for a conference the week before the NBA season started, and I was stunned at the predictions in the SL Tribune. Their staff called a 30-35 win season. I was convinced that a crack epidemic had broken out in Mormon country.\n\nTurns out I was wrong. Great coaching (combined with one of the most insanely multidimensional players in years) brought that squad within one win of the playoffs, which was a mind-blowing achievement.\n\nTwo seasons ago, people were figuring that squad would be Denver, but they managed 17 wins with a roster that appeared to be assembled by vandals. Turns out that it’s really hard to win only 9 games in a season.\n\nWhy do I bring this up? Because this expansion Charlotte team is this season’s candidate for The Worst Ever. They’ll probably finish with the worst record in the league this season, but I’ll pay $50 to Shawn Kemp’s paternity fund if the Bobcats actually win fewer than 9 games. Sure, Bernie Bickerstaff (he’s coaching and GM’ing, which almost never works) has put together a squad of no-names (along with #2 pick Emeka Okafor), with an eye to clearing more cap space and bringing in free agents as the team gains flexibility in the next 3 years.\n\nThe thing with this lineup is, a bunch of the players are guys who never got a chance to contribute on deeper, veteran squads. Guys like Tamar Slay, who would show up large in summer leagues, but was never going to get playing time ahead of Kerry Kittles and Richard Jefferson in NJ. Similarly, Eddie House was frequently bottled up by Pat Riley’s disciplinarian ways (which is a way of saying he didn’t play any defense). Now, he’s going to get the green light to fire away.\n\nThe one problem about those talented, potential-laden players is that very few of them are capable of becoming regular contributors. They’re very rarely on the bench because of depth issues; there’s usually something wrong with some aspect of their games. Bad defense, poor shot selection, and an inability to pass the ball out of double-teams are the usual culprits.\n\nSo, they’ll have some fun players to watch, and I think Okafor will grow into an Alonzo Mourning type of player in the next few years, but it’ll be a pretty ugly season in Charlotte. But not Record-Breaking Ugly, which is all that counts.\n\nMiami Heat\n\nThey traded for Shaquille O’Neal in the offseason, which kinda sucks because I really enjoyed watching last year’s team. It was neat that Pat Riley gave Ron Jeremy his first NBA head coaching gig, but I also enjoyed watching Lamar Odom play well (albeit out of position) and not drug out.\n\nBut that’s all in the past. Miami’s now officially about the present. Shaq’s dropped a ton of weight, so it’s possible that he can play another 3-4 years, if he’s motivated (by a big contract extension, since he’s deal’s up after next year). He’ll be paired with Dwyane Wade, a second-year kid whom I loved watching the NCAA tournament two tourneys ago. Problem is, Wade’s game is predicated on getting to the hoop, and using his dribble-drive to set up his defender. I’m not sure how effective that’s going to be with Shaq clogging the middle, unless the big guy is willing to play high-post sometimes. He wasn’t willing to last year, because he hated Kobe.\n\nThe Heat’s other problem is that they traded away all of their depth to get Shaq. Since his contract’s so huge, the team’ll never have the cap space to bring in a significant free agent. So the rest of the roster’s made up of refugees. Still, they’ll see tons of open shots, because no one in the East can slow down Shaq.\n\nOne of those rejects is Christian Laettner, which is pretty funny. See, when Shaq was drafted #1 in 1992, Laettner was #3 (Alonzo Mourning went #2), and Shaq was just merciless every time he took on Laettner’s squads. CL went on to have one of the non-descript careers ever for a guy who was the best college player in a generation (and I hated Duke).\n\nIf you have a minute, check out his page on NBA.com and look through the “transactions” section; in the course of his career, Laettner’s been traded for some really wacky players. He’s on his seventh team, but the sixth team actually waived him before he ever played a game for them (maybe Golden State GM Chris Mullin took pity on his fellow Dream Teamer). I’m just saying it’d be funny if he has a career resurgence because of Shaq.\n\nGiven how terrible the new SE division is, there’s no doubt that Miami wins it (barring a major injury to Shaq).\n\nOrlando Magic\n\nThese guys were the worst team in the league last year, so ownership blew up the squad, trading away the best physical talent in the league, in Tracy McGrady. Normally, you don’t trade a player of McGrady’s caliber and get a pass from the press, but the new GM seemed to be of the opinion, “We went 21-61 with you; how much worse will we be without you?”\n\nThe new lineup’s pretty interesting. With the #1 pick in the draft, they drafted a high school kid, which tells you that they don’t plan on winning for a while (Dwight Howard’s a good kid, by all accounts, but he’s no Le Bron). The backcourt of Steve Francis and Cuttino Mobley can pour in tons of points, but won’t put on a lot of defensive clinics. The team had better win, because Francis is the poutiest guy in the world when he’s losing. Of course, he’s receiving something like $14 million a season, so he oughtta shut the heck up.\n\nOrlando may actually be a middle-of-the-road team this year, if only because of the multiple scoring punches, plus the health of long-distance scorer Pat Garrity.\n\nAllegedly, Grant Hill’s ankle is finally working correctly, but I’ll believe that when he’s actually put in 70-75 games this year. Until then, his ankle takes the place of Rik Smits’ feet, which were pronounced “healthiest they’ve ever been” during every off-season. By mid-January, he’d be limping around and going on the injured list. For some reason, no one ever made the connection that his feet felt good in the off-season BECAUSE HE WASN’T PLAYING BASKETBALL.\n\nAnyway, I hope Hill is healthy, because he was a great player to watch in his prime. If he plays most of the season, then Orlando has a shot at getting the 4 or 5 spot in the playoffs. Then they’ll get wiped out because they don’t play any D.\n\nWashington Wizards\n\nIn a stroke of genius, they decided that having two former Golden State Warriors in the starting lineup wasn’t enough, so the Wizards management traded for Antawn Jamison in a vain attempt at recreating the magic of the 2001-02 Warriors, which lost 65 games. The Wiz might actually only lose about 50-55 games this year, so they can’t even fail right. In Washington, this is considered a success. Keep in mind, this is a team that MICHAEL JORDAN couldn’t inspire.\n\n(More previews to come tonight or tomorrow. I got a little off-track last night)"
