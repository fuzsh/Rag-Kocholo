        "text": "Melo and the Knicks have been a step ahead of the Heat this season. (Getty Images)\n\nAtlantic Division\n\nNew York Knicks: A+\n\nConsistently the best in the East, with huge wins over contending teams. Things could not be going any better for this team and there's nothing really to worry about ... OH MY GOD, THAT'S AMAR'E STOUDEMIRE'S MUSIC!\n\nBrooklyn Nets B+\n\nThe Nets have something going, that's to be sure. They have versatility and balance. Brooklyn also has some big wins on its resume, including the first meeting vs. New York. Their defense has a ways to go, but it's safe to say the debut season at Barclays has been a success so far.\n\nMore on NBA's first quarter Related links\n\nBerger: No telling Howard's fate in LA\n\nQuarterly Report: Winners & Losers\n\nPodcast: How silly is Melo for MVP talk?\n\nMore NBA coverage\n\nLatest updates | Ken Berger | EyeOnBasketball\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers: B+\n\nNo Bynum, and little to no problem. Doug Collins has managed to pull together the same quality of defense the Sixers had last year, and Jason Richardson and Nick Young, along with a much improved Jrue Holiday, has kept the team competitive. Now, if they could just get Bynum healthy.\n\nBoston Celtics: C-\n\nNot exactly the dominant start they were looking for. The Celtics were supposed to contend right out the gate with what was thought to be an improved roster. Instead they've struggled mightily with defense and their offense has sputtered in big spots. The trend seems to be reversing, setting them up for a strong second quarter. But a disappointing start for the C's.\n\nToronto Raptors: F-\n\nThe good defense of last season is gone. Andrea Bargnani is a hot mess. They've had rampant injuries. Toronto is a complete disaster and finger pointing is getting out of control. Management doesn't want to take responsibility, saying that \"talent is not the issue.\" Anyone watching this team night in and night out would disagree.\n\nCentral Division\n\nChicago Bulls: B\n\nJoakim Noah has been the rock for this team. Luol Deng has been really good, Carlos Boozer has had his moments, and Nate Robinson has been surprisingly almost competent most nights. But Noah is playing out of his mind. He’s logging 40 minutes, 13.9 points, 10.6 rebounds, 4.3 assists, 2.3 blocks, and 1.4 steals per game. He’s even making 81.8 percent of his free throws. And don’t forget the defense he gives them. Maybe he’ll be holstering his finger guns after making a jumper in the All-Star Game.\n\nMilwaukee Bucks: B\n\nI don’t understand the Bucks. The Brandon Jennings-Monta Ellis pair doesn’t work (-2.7 net rating together), but when it’s just one of them in the game, the team seems to run quite well. The bench is really good at making shots, showing a lot of good depth. But how does this team remain successful moving forward when their two best players don’t work together? Also, can Scott Skiles just free John Henson already? There’s no way Drew Gooden and Samuel Dalembert are better than him.\n\nIndiana Pacers: C\n\nAs most of you may know, clutch statistics generally start in the last five minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime when a team is plus or minus five points or less. The Indiana Pacers have been nearly impossible to score on in these situations. Yes, their offense has struggled but their defense is giving up a league best 78.4 points per 100 possessions in these situations. This is a big reason they’ve fought through games and sit at an 11-11 record despite their offensive struggles.\n\nCleveland Cavaliers: C-\n\nThe Cavaliers are bad but considering the injuries they’ve dealt with (Irving missing so much time and Waiters missing some), the 5-18 record really isn’t THAT bad. They can’t beat winnings teams (3-12), half of their losses have been blowouts, and they have the worst net differential in the NBA (-8.7). But Kyrie Irving has returned and that means they’ll now be fun.\n\nDetroit Pistons: D+\n\nI get why coaches are reluctant to throw rookies out into the fire, especially rookie big men. But Lawrence Frank has to get loose with Andre Drummond’s minutes. His per-36 averages are 12.5 points, 12.4 rebounds, and 2.5 blocks. He makes 58.6 percent of his shots. Sure, the free throw shooting is 39.6 percent (even Dwight is cringing) but the learning process is something Drummond needs.\n\nSoutheast Division\n\nMiami Heat: B+\n\nComing off a title, the Heat haven't exactly turned into that steamroller that's just plowing over teams. They've lost some games ugly -- by 20 twice to the Knicks, to the Wizards -- and they've appeared a little uninterested at times. But it's all part of the post-championship hangover. These guys are coming off the high of the Finals, of actually succeeding, of finishing the job. It can kind of be a challenge to regain focus and intensity for games in November against the Bucks.\n\nStill, they haven't exactly performed as a team looking to defend its title should. The loss to the Wizards is more forgivable than the two blowouts at the hands of the Knicks, one Melo-less. That's direct and obvious competition to their crown this season and the Heat didn't show up in either contest. At the quarter mark, they're still 14-6, and obviously still going to be in contention for the East's top seed. But there has been a hint of complacency from them early.\n\nAtlanta Hawks: A\n\nRemember when Danny Ferry took over their front office and promptly moved Joe Johnson and Marvin Williams? Most of us saw it as the blowup the team needed. But Ferry stopped short of going all the way and refocused his efforts around building a team centered around Josh Smith and Al Horford.\n\nAnd look at that, the Hawks are 14-6 with a number of good wins in their pockets. Now, are they championship contenders? Hardly. They've got to do a little more proving to get to that point. We've seen the Hawks put together solid regular seasons the past few years without any postseason results. But the point is, this team has a new identity and they're flourishing in it. Larry Drew has done a tremendous job as everyone understands their role and place. In terms of where they were over the summer compared to now, the Hawks' first quarter has been nothing short of great\n\nOrlando Magic: B\n\nAny time you're 8-13 and yet fist-pumping, that tells the story. But look: The Magic aren't the worst team in the league. And that's a major victory. In fact, they're just a win behind the Lakers at this point. Who says they didn't win the Dwight Howard trade?\n\nThe Magic are clearly in a major rebuild situation but they're not hapless. They're competitive and Jacque Vaughn has them playing hard. They aren't going to make a postseason push this season, or maybe even next. But they're better set up for the present than we though. Most of us didn't see Orlando getting to eight wins until maybe February.\n\nCharlotte Bobcats: C\n\nSuch promising beginnings. A 7-6 start, immediately matching the win total from last season's disastrous campaign. But as young teams tend to do, they've fallen on their faces and lost 10 straight.\n\nStill though, there's been promising signs from this Bobcats team. Kemba Walker appears to possibly be something. You can see why there was the hype around Michael Kidd-Gilchrist. Ben Gordon was a very solid signing. The Bobcats are still three or four pieces away from being a playoff group and they need those young players to start developing rapidly, but this season has been a step forward from last. The 10-game losing streak is upsetting, but when you're young, there will be times like this. It's about how respond.\n\nWashington Wizards: F\n\nThey have an excuse. John Wall hasn't played yet. But Wall, as good as he is, isn't worth 10 wins.\n\nFact is, the Wizards were a mess when they got rid of problems like Andray Blatche, JaVale McGee and Nick Young. And they remain a mess with new faces like Nene, Bradley Beal and Emeka Okafor.\n\nWall should be coming back soon, but it's already another lottery season for the Wizards. When's it going to change?\n\nNorthwest Division\n\nOklahoma City Thunder: A+\n\nTrade James Harden, third best player and Sixth Man of the Year. No big deal. The Thunder machine rolls on no matter what. They're like Walter White: \"Nothing stops this train. Nothing.\"\n\nThe Thunder are off to their best 22-game start since moving to Oklahoma City and again, that's with dealing away a core piece three days before the season opened. They started the season 1-2, but have since gone 17-2 and currently are riding a nine-game win streak. Their offense is better, their defense is better and overall, they might actually be better.\n\nWhy? How? Three reasons: 1) Kevin Martin has fit in swimmingly and has provided that bench production Harden gave; 2) Serge Ibaka has elevated his game as a legit offensive weapon; and 3) Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant are reaching new levels with their game.\n\nWe should've known that even with losing Harden, the Thunder would improve. Because their top two players -- Westbrook and Durant -- were bound to be better this season.\n\nUtah Jazz: B\n\nLet's not forget: This was a playoff team last season. Not a good one -- they were easily swept by the Spurs -- but they were at least there.\n\nThey made a few changes, like bringing in Marvin and Mo Williams, but overall it's mostly the same group. They're better, though. They're incredibly tough at home, they have size to match anyone and as long as their guards perform, they can compete with most teams.\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves: A-\n\nAlready without Ricky Rubio, after Kevin Love broke his hand doing knuckle pushups, most feared the Wolves season was over. But they've treaded water, kept their heads above the surface and with Love back and Rubio set to return soon, the Wolves are still in decent position.\n\nThey're 10-9, which is quite a bit better than what some feared they'd be after Love went down. It's not like they've had some revelation with Derrick Williams or anything, it's just been they've played hard, won games they should and stayed competitive.\n\nWith their pieces coming back, it seems they've stayed in it enough to still keep their postseason hopes alive. Which was all the goal for the first quarter really was.\n\nDenver Nuggets: D\n\nFor whatever reason, the Nuggets have become the stathead favorite, a trendy pick because of their ability to score in the paint and in transition.\n\nAnd they've been wildly disappointing. Now, there's a decent excuse: Of their 23 games, 17 have been on the road. They're 6-11 away from home, 5-1 in Denver. If there's optimism to be had, it's that once the Nuggets get back home, they can start to pile up some wins and get on the right side of .500.\n\nStill, if you're said to be elite, if you have ideas of being a contender, you've got to take care of your business away from home better than six out of 17 times.\n\nPortland Trail Blazers: B+\n\nSomehow, the Blazers are 10-12. They have one of the worst benches in basketball, they're relying on a rookie point guard to score the bulk of their points and they don't have a whole lot of talent.\n\nBut with a big home win over the Spurs to build on, it does appear the Blazers have a good direction about them. Damian Lillard is a budding star, LaMarcus Aldridge is pretty close to one already, Nicolas Batum is a very good piece and players like Wesley Matthews and J.J. Hickson have been decent role players. They probably aren't going to get into the playoff conversation, but the team is very competitive and seems to be headed on a positive path.\n\nSouthwest Division\n\nSan Antonio Spurs: A\n\nThe Spurs have rolled over most teams, when they actually, you know, play their healthy players. The same explosive offense from last season is back, along with a stronger defense. If they can maintain that sixth ranking in defensive efficiency, they can contend for a title this year.\n\nMemphis Grizzlies: A\n\nStrong wins over quality opponents, strong play from both the starters and the bench, strong defense, an improved offense, and a strong start to the season. So, yeah, Memphis is pretty strong this year.\n\nDallas Mavericks: C+\n\nAll things considered, they've still managed to go .500 without their best player. Their defense is abysmal, but their offense has been terrific. How much Nowitzki helps and if somehow his addition helps the defense (unlikely) overall will be keys going forward.\n\nHouston Rockets: B\n\nThey have lots of problems on the defensive end, which is odd considering they have multiple quality defenders. But their offense has been great and James Harden has brought some real excitement. They could have been one of the worst teams in the West and instead they have a team that could make a run in the second half of the season if they can shore up their defense.\n\nNew Orleans Hornets: D\n\nEric Gordon is out with a vague injury, Anthony Davis has been banged up, they have no point guard, Austin Rivers is erratic and their roster in general is a mess. The Hornets have some fight in them, but just not enough talent. So it's a lot like last year, but with injuries to blame. Hopefully they can get healthy for the middle part of the year to stabilize.\n\nPacific Division\n\nLos Angeles Clippers: Grade: A+\n\nThe Clippers have the fourth best offense, the seventh best defense, and the third best differential in the NBA. They have the best point guard in the league too and the most athletic interior to play with him. They have role players off the bench and all kinds of versatility. It's just the name on the front of the jersey makes it hard to trust them as contenders. It's probably time to get over that.\n\nGolden State Warriors: Grade: A\n\nHow can you not fall in love with this Warriors team? Their perimeter attack is pretty much perfect and when they go to that lineup of Jarrett Jack at the point with Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson on the wings, I’m not sure how you’re supposed to defend that. They’ve missed one of the best defensive bigs in the NBA for much of this season and they’re still top 5 in the West.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers: Grade: F+\n\nTake your pick. Dwight is a terrible free-throw shooter. Jordan Hill attempting to play defense. Antawn Jamison’s eyeliner. Kobe Bryant and Chris Duhon attempting to defense the perimeter. Metta World Peace dribbling. Pau Gasol not being healthy and when he is, he’s not Pau Gasol. Steve Nash is more likely to open a speakeasy in the Staples Center than play in a game any time soon. There are dozens of hilarious problems with the Lakers right now.\n\nPhoenix Suns: Grade: D+\n\nSo Marcin Gortat is unhappy, Michael Beasley is toxic and Shannon Brown takes the second most shots per game on the team. Other than that, the Phoenix Suns reclamation project is going quite nicely. The fact that they’re 8-15 almost seems to be to their detriment. They need to bottom out and get a top draft pick. There isn’t a star on this team and nobody even has that potential anymore."
