        "text": "WASHINGTON -- Antawn Jamison scored 22 points in his first game back from a knee injury and the Washington Wizards snapped a four-game losing streak with a 93-92 win over the Atlanta Hawks on Friday night.\n\nJamison missed 12 games after spraining his left knee Jan. 30 against Detroit. Gilbert Arenas added 19 points for the Wizards, who have won 10 of their last 11 against the Hawks.\n\nWashington prevented its first five-game losing streak of the season with the win against Atlanta, which got 24 points from Josh Smith and 21 from Marvin Williams.\n\nJamison got off to a fast start, finishing the first quarter with 10 points on 5-for-6 shooting. He also had three rebounds and an assist as Washington led 25-24 after one.\n\nAtlanta has lost five straight road games but is tied for second in the Eastern Conference with 12 road wins.\n\nThe Wizards also were bolstered by the return of Caron Butler, who missed three games with lower back spasms. He started the game and finished with four points on 1-for-10 shooting.\n\n76ERS: 117\n\nGRIZZLIES: 112\n\nPHILADELPHIA -- Andre Iguodala and Kyle Korver each scored 27 points and the Philadelphia tied a season high with its third straight victory in overtime over lowly Memphis.\n\nJoe Smith added a season-high 18 points and had 12 rebounds, and Andre Miller had 11 points and 12 assists for the Sixers.\n\nIn a matchup of teams vying for more pingpong balls in the draft lottery, the Grizzlies improved their chances.\n\nPau Gasol had 31 points and 13 rebounds and Mike Miller scored 27 for Memphis, which has the worst record in the NBA (15-45) after making the playoffs three straight years.\n\nThe Sixers (21-38) are third-worst ahead of Boston. The team that finishes last isn't guaranteed the first pick in June's draft. However, that team will have the best chance to win the lottery.\n\nComing off an impressive victory over Phoenix that prevented the Suns from becoming the first team in league history to sweep its road games against the opposite conference, the Sixers almost reverted back to their losing ways.\n\nThey committed 12 turnovers and trailed by three at halftime, despite shooting nearly 60 percent.\n\nThe Grizzlies went on a 9-2 run to start the fourth quarter, but Korver ended it with a 3-pointer and the teams stayed close the rest of the way.\n\nIguodala's driving layup put the Sixers ahead 103-100 in the final minute of regulation, but Mike Miller nailed a 3-pointer from the top of the arc to tie it with 4.9 seconds left. Iguodala's fallaway shot missed as the buzzer sounded, sending it to overtime.\n\nKorver scored the first points in the extra session on a baseline jumper and made a pair of free throws to give the Sixers a 107-105 lead. Andre Miller followed with a steal and layup to extend the lead to 109-105, and Smith's jumper iced it.\n\nThe Sixers hadn't won three in a row since opening the season 3-0. Allen Iverson and Chris Webber were playing here back then, more fans were coming out and there was reason for some hope.\n\nOn a night when young fans received Andre Miller replica jerseys, the point guard dazzled with several nifty passes. Miller found Samuel Dalembert for an alley-oop pass on an inbounds from behind the basket as the Sixers took their biggest lead to that point, 34-28, in the second quarter.\n\nThe Grizzlies outscored Philadelphia 20-11 the rest of the quarter to take a 48-45 lead at halftime. Notes: Sixers rookie F Rodney Carney sat out his second straight game with a torn rotator cuff and labrum in his right shoulder.\n\nBUCKS: 94\n\nRAPTORS: 81\n\nTORONTO -- Michael Redd scored 21 points and Milwaukee beat Toronto for its third straight victory.\n\nCharlie Bell added 19 points and Andrew Bogut had 18 points and 11 rebounds for the Bucks, who went 3-17 with Redd out of the lineup with an injured knee.\n\nAll-Star Chris Bosh had 14 points on just eight shots for the Atlantic Division-leading Raptors, who are 9-2 in their last 11 home games.\n\nToronto failed to get the ball to Bosh, who was double-teamed every time he touched it. Fans, recently excited by the resurgent Raptors, booed in the final seconds.\n\nAndrea Bargnani -- the No. 1 pick in the draft -- had 16 points and nine rebounds for Toronto.\n\nMilwaukee shot 45 percent compared to 37 for Toronto.\n\nJose Calderon cut Milwaukee's lead to six with 8:12 left, but the Bucks followed with a 9-0 run highlighted by Redd's 3-pointer and layup.\n\nMilwaukee outscored Toronto 26-18 in the fourth quarter as Toronto shot just 7-for-19 in the period.\n\nFormer Raptor Charlie Villanueva had 14 points in 24 minutes.\n\nT.J. Ford, who was traded for Villanueva, had 10 points and nine assists for the Raptors.\n\nKNICKS: 106\n\nWARRIORS: 97\n\nNEW YORK -- Stephon Marbury scored 34 points and Quentin Richardson added 30 points and 12 rebounds to lead New York over Golden State, the Warriors' season-high fifth straight loss.\n\nEddy Curry added 22 points for the Knicks, who won their seventh straight at Madison Square Garden despite playing without starting guard Jamal Crawford, who had ankle surgery Friday, plus reserves David Lee (ankle) and Nate Robinson (stomach virus).\n\nAl Harrington scored 26 points and Monta Ellis had 17 for the Warriors, who have dropped six in a row on the road. Golden State is 1-5 since the All-Star break.\n\nPlaying without starters Baron Davis (knee surgery) and Stephen Jackson (toe), the Warriors led 92-90 with 51/2 minutes to go. But they went cold from there, going without a field goal for nearly 5 minutes while the Knicks seized control with a 12-0 spurt.\n\nCeltics mourn Johnson\n\nGARDENA, Calif. -- Four months after the death of team patriarch Red Auerbach, Larry Bird, Kevin McHale and Danny Ainge reunited in grief Friday to say goodbye to former Boston Celtics teammate Dennis Johnson.\n\nThe trio of Celtics stars joined about 1,000 mourners who shared tears and laughter during Johnson's 11/2-hour funeral.\n\n\"D.J. was a huge part of championship teams and was a guy that everybody liked,\" McHale said. \"He was a fun guy, and he had a personality that fit with us because we had a bunch of guys who enjoyed each other.\"\n\nJohnson, who was coaching the Austin Toros of the NBA's Development League, died of an apparent heart attack after practice last month. He was 52.\n\n\"He was a great basketball player, a guy that was dedicated to the game, and he showed that by staying in it and going to the minor leagues to coach and try to move his way up,\" Bird said.\n\n\"It's unfortunate because he had a lot of life left in him, but it's just something that happened that we have no control over. He left a great legacy behind.\"\n\nSeveral Toros players served as pallbearers for Johnson, a Compton native who was later buried in Rancho Palos Verdes.\n\nAmong the mourners at City of Refuge church were former NBA stars Michael Cooper and Norm Nixon, Los Angeles Clippers coach Mike Dunleavy and Phoenix Suns assistant Alvin Gentry, whom Johnson replaced as Clippers coach for the final 24 games of the 2002-03 season.\n\nJohnson was traded to the Celtics in 1983 and helped them win NBA titles in 1984 and '86. He also helped Seattle to its only league championship.\n\n\"I was the one who benefited the most from D.J. coming to our team,\" Ainge said. \"I slept a lot better at night, knowing I wouldn't have to be guarding Andrew Toney, Isiah Thomas and Michael Jordan.\"\n\nJohnson spent four seasons as a Celtics assistant.\n\nMcHale and Bird went into the front-office ranks after their playing days.\n\nMcHale fondly recalled the trio \"laughing about the fact that we (complain) about the things our players do that we used to do and how we expect them to be perfect -- when we were never anywhere near perfect.\"\n\nJohnson, a second-round pick out of Pepperdine, spent his first four seasons in the NBA with the SuperSonics. In 1978-79, the Sonics went 52-30 and won it all -- with Johnson being named MVP of the finals.\n\nJohnson retired in 1990 and the Celtics, who have captured a record 16 NBA titles, haven't won one since.\n\n\"What made him such a great defensive player was his ability to go laterally,\" Bird said. \"He had some quickness that people didn't realize, and he was deceiving.\"\n\nWade's shoulder examined\n\nMIAMI -- Dwyane Wade had his dislocated left shoulder examined Friday by specialist Dr. James Andrews, and Miami Heat coach Pat Riley said there's no rush for a decision on whether season-ending surgery or rehabilitation is the best treatment.\n\n\"It doesn't make any difference,\" Riley said. \"We know he's gone -- four weeks, six weeks, the rest of the year.\"\n\nThere's a chance Wade could return for the playoffs if he decides on rehabilitation. He sought a second opinion from Andrews after being examined earlier by team physician Dr. Harlan Selesnick.\n\n\"He'll consult with Harlan again,\" Riley said. \"I think he's got all the information. I don't think the diagnosis is going to be any different than it was with Harlan.\"\n\nWade dislocated his shoulder Feb. 21 when he collided with Houston's Shane Battier.\n\nJazz waive Henderson\n\nMINNEAPOLIS -- The Utah Jazz waived veteran forward Alan Henderson on Friday, eight days after they acquired him in a trade with Philadelphia.\n\nThe move was expected. Henderson never appeared in a game with the Jazz after they exchanged the right to trade second-round draft picks this summer with the Sixers -- who also sent cash in the deal. The 34-year-old Henderson played sparingly for Philadelphia this season. averaging 3.5 points and 3.1 rebounds over 34 games.\n\nThe 6-foot-9, 240-pound Henderson played nine years with Atlanta. He has been with four teams over the past three seasons.\n\nUtah was in Minnesota on Friday night to play the Timberwolves.\n\nInjury sidelines Marion\n\nPHOENIX -- Suns All-Star forward Shawn Marion missed his second straight game Friday night because of a bruised right hand.\n\nPhoenix coach Mike D'Antoni said Marion's hand, injured Tuesday at Indiana, was too swollen to play."
