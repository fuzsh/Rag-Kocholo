Aside from TJ Ford, the Spurs still haven't landed anybody. The Lakers stopped trying to land Chris Paul, and bizarrely sent Lamar Odom to Dallas for a draft pick, possibly as a setup for a Dwight Howard trade.\n\nCOMPETITIVE BALANCE, EVERYONE!\n\n(more player movement details below the fold)\n\nSo far, these are the known details of who's going where, both in free agency and trades. Please let me know if I missed anything, so I can add it to the list.\n\nAtlanta Hawks - Tracy McGrady\n\nBoston Celtics - Keyon Dooling, Brandon Bass, Jeff Green,\n\nChicago Bulls - Rip Hamilton\n\nDetroit Pistons - (re-signed) Tayshaun Prince\n\nMiami Heat - Shane Battier, Eddy Curry\n\nMilwaukee Bucks - Mike Dunleavy Jr, Luc Richard Mbah a Moute\n\nNew York Knicks - Tyson Chandler\n\nOrlando Magic - Glen Davis\n\nToronto Raptors - Aaron Gray\n\nWashington Wizards - Ronny Turiaf\n\nDallas Mavericks - Vince Carter, Brian Cardinal, Lamar Odom, Samuel Dalembert ?\n\nLos Angeles Clippers - Caron Butler\n\nMemphis Grizzlies - Jeremy Pargo\n\nPhoenix Suns - Shannon Brown\n\nUtah Jazz - Jamaal Tinsley, Earl Watson\n\nSAN ANTONIO SPURS - T.J. Ford\n\n_________\n\nOk, that's all I got so far. Discuss!\n\nFeel free to use this as a DTOUR thread as well, since we haven't had one in quite some time."
