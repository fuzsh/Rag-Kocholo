        "text": "FanHouse's NBA Guide gives you a daily look at all the games that matter ... and some that don't.\n\nSports\n\nIn partnership with NBC Sports Philadelphia\n\nHEADLINER\n\nPhiladelphia at New Orleans, 8PM ET\n\nQuietly, the 76ers are back in your picture. The folks that called third place in the East (or better) ... well, the team's still outside your picture. But if you thought it'd be a solid playoff team, an improved version of the pre-Elton 2007-08 version, then this is about right.\n\nExcept, of course, that Brand had been out during this resurgence. E.B. came back in Saturday's win over the Knicks, playing limited minutes off the bench. There's two views you can take: adding Brand only helps or adding Brand sends this team back to identity-crisis November.\n\nReally, Philadelphia needs help scoring. The Andres have never been huge point producers, Samuel Dalembert is invisible on offense, and while Louis Williams is a hellcat, his shot hasn't been remotely efficient this season. Brand's not quite the post scorer some of his contemporaries have been, but he gets the job done. Tony DiLeo needs him to get the job done.\n\nUNDERCARD\n\nMinnesota at Milwaukee, 8PM ET\n\nI just wanted to point out that, due to some unexplainable forces of the universe, the Wolves at the Bucks is actually one of the most watchable games on a seven-game slate. How will Milwaukee respond to the loss of Michael Redd? (Please don't let the answer be \"Charlie Bell.\") Can Kevin Love keep the car running? Does Kevin Love have any shot at crashing the R.O.Y. discussion party? What does Kevin Love think about this season of 24?\n\nAtlanta at Miami, 7:30PM ET\n\nAl Horford might be back in the line-up for the Hawks. Joel Anthony and Mark Blount are still manning the pivot for Miami.\n\nPhoenix at Washington, 7PM ET\n\nToo bad the Suns can't let another team (like, say, the Wizards!) use Amare Stoudemire for a month, so that Suns fans could see what they'd be missing and stop complaining.\n\nHouston at New York, 7:30PM ET\n\nNew Jersey at Oklahoma City, 8PM ET\n\nPortland at L.A. Clippers, 10:30PM PT\n\nMonday's NBA Guide: The Elton Brand Quandary and the Suns in D.C. originally appeared on NBA FanHouse on Mon, 26 Jan 2009 16:15:00 EST .
