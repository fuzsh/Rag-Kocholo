        "text": "Basketball legend Michael Jordan is set for a sensational return to the NBA with the Washington Wizards - and his former Olympic team-mate Charles Barkley is set to join him.\n\nJordan and Barkley revealed their plans during last night's NBA draft at Madison Square Garden.\n\nJordan, part owner and president of the Wizards, recently broke two ribs during the intense workouts he has been undertaking to see if he can compete in the game he dominated until retiring after the 1997-98 season.\n\n\"My ribs are feeling a lot better,\" he told Barkley, now a commentator with the US cable channel TNT, after the Wizards made high school player Kwame Brown the top pick in the draft.\n\n\"I'm just glad his little ribs are all right,\" said Barkley. \"He's been whining about it for two, three weeks now.\"\n\nAs the fans roared with laughter at the exchange shown on a big video screen, Jordan jokingly warned Barkley: \"I'm still the boss, I have a bunch of players coming to Washington DC, and I may not need another.\"\n\nCommissioner David Stern, who later told the demonstrative fans this was the \"most intense\" draft he had ever presided over, then said from the dais: \"I'd like to interrupt the Michael and Charles show to announce the next pick.\"\n\nJordan and Barkley, close friends, have played cat and mouse with the media for months over their possible returns. But later, Barkley, while signing autographs for fans, revealed: \"I'm working out. I'm working towards playing. I want to play. Michael wants to play.\"\n\nAnd on the subject of those tender Jordan ribs, Barkley said: \"I think they'll be OK. He wants to play.\"\n\nElsewhere in the draft, Spaniard Pau Gasol has become the NBA's highest-drafted foreign player ever, and along with a pair of West Africans and a handful of Europeans helped give the league a youthful international tinge.\n\nThe first round of the draft included four foreign players with no US schooling and one with just two years of American high school. Not one of them is over 21.\n\nGasol, who turns 21 next week, was the third pick overall, selected by the Atlanta Hawks but headed for the Grizzlies after a four-player trade featuring star forward Shareef Abdur-Rahim. The Grizzlies themselves are likely to move soon from Vancouver to Memphis.\n\nThe smooth-shooting Gasol, a seven-foot forward, has been compared to the previous highest-drafted foreigner, Germany's Dirk Nowitzki of the Dallas Mavericks (number nine, 1998). Despite his size Gasol is likely to play small forward in the NBA.\n\n\"I think I'm a player with a lot of possibilities,\" said Gasol, who has spent three years as a professional in Barcelona. \"I want to improve and become a good player in the league.\"\n\nSenegal's DeSagana Diop, an 18-year-old seven-footer with the solid frame to play center in the NBA, was drafted eighth. Twenty-year-old 6ft 10ins forward Vladimir Radmanovic, who plays for FMP Zeleznik was selected 12th by the Seattle SuperSonics.\n\nHe expects European-style big men to thrive under the NBA's new rules allowing zone defenses next season. \"That will help the good shooters, because with the zone, if you have good shooters, you'll kill them and you'll beat them by 20 points,\" he said.\n\nTwenty-one-year-old Raul Lopez, picked 24th by the Utah Jazz, was the second Spaniard selected in the first round and the smallest draftee. A 6 ft point guard, Lopez played for Real Madrid for the 2000-01 season.\n\nAnother guard, 6-foot-2 (1.88m) Tony Parker from Paris Basket Racing, was the 28th and last pick of the first round, chosen by the San Antonio Spurs. Parker, 19, who is the Belgian-born son of an American father, became the starting point guard in his second season with one of France's top teams.\n\nBetween the two guards, Haitian-born 6-foot-11 center Samuel Dalembert was drafted 26th by the Philadelphia 76ers."
