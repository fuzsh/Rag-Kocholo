        "text": "USA TODAY Sports\n\nIn order for the triangle offense to run smoothly, positive energy and good passing from the 5 is imperative.\n\nSamuel Dalembert may not have the accolades or mobility of his predecessor, but he is far from a liability. The center has shown a willingness to develop as a player and teammate, improving his offense and motor.\n\nDalembert may be a stopgap at the 5, but his effort shows he's capable of being more than an afterthought.\n\nPassing\n\nSomehow, along the way, Dalembert's passing ability has slipped under the radar. He has tremendous court vision for a big man and the soft touch needed to find cutters and open teammates along the perimeter.\n\nWith New York still adjusting to the triangle, Dalembert's wherewithal to find the open man within the flow of the offense will be an asset moving forward.\n\nUnlike Tyson Chandler, when Dalembert has the ball in his hands, he is capable of making a play. Defenses will need to honor the 5 and his ability to create, which, in part, should open the offense for his teammates.\n\nBall movement and quick reads will be the key to perfecting head coach Derek Fisher's offense, and Dalembert has shown an unselfish willingness to excel as a facilitator at the 5.\n\nFisher said the following, via Marc Berman of the NY Post: \"He’s going to be a great asset for us, I think on both ends. He’s a good passer on the offensive end, better offensively than people give him credit for.\"\n\nShooting\n\nNathaniel S. Butler/Getty Images\n\nDalembert isn't a prolific shooter by any means, but in comparison to Chandler, he's a bona fide stud from the perimeter.\n\nThe triangle requires competent shooting from the center position, and Dalembert possesses that ability. He could knock down open shots from 15 feet or less, which will keep defenses honest and allow him to find his teammates cutting to the basket when he's foul-line extended.\n\nEarly in Dalembert's career he was known for his explosiveness and ability to finish lobs around the rim, but he's expanded his game to become a more well-rounded individual.\n\nPhil Jackson said the following about Dalembert, via Charley Rosen of ESPN.com: \"He has an effective short-range jumper and, in the past he's complained about not getting enough touches. But so does almost everybody else. What Sam needs to learn is how to be a scoring threat in the pivot.\"\n\nIf the center could take his game to the next level, and be more consistent in the pivot, he'll provide more than enough offensive output from the 5 to help alleviate the scoring load from Carmelo Anthony and J.R. Smith's shoulders.\n\nDefense\n\nNathaniel S. Butler/Getty Images\n\nDalembert isn't likely to be a Defensive Player of the Year candidate, but he isn't a slouch by any means.\n\nAlthough he isn't the strongest center and his mobility could be questionable against smaller, more athletic teams, he's competent enough to protect the rim and alter shots.\n\nAs reported by Marc Berman of the NY Post, Carmelo Anthony mentioned Dalembert's presence in the middle: \"His presence, his defensive presence, the way he’s able to control the paint and alter shots, even if he don’t block a shot, he’s still there. He’s making a presence.\"\n\nChandler may have had a reputation as an elite defender and rim protector, but in his last season or two with New York, he left a lot to be desired on the defensive end. He relied too often on tip-backs as opposed to exploding up to grab rebounds, and he shied away from contact.\n\nDalembert is the opposite: He's willing to secure loose balls, clean the glass and bang down low. He embraces physicality, and he doesn't whine when calls don't go his way. Dalembert is a blue-collar defender with a no-nonsense attitude who wants to win and make an impact."
