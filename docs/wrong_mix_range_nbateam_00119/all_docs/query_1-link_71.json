        "text": "WILD The game ended in controversy over a technical foul that gave Gilbert Arenas the opportunity to seize victory by draining three free throws with only 0.1 seconds left\n\nAP\n\nGilbert Arenas swished three free throws with 0.1 of a second remaining to give the Washington Wizards a wild 107-106 victory over the Golden State Warriors in the NBA on Sunday.\n\nWith Washington trailing 106-104 with 2.9 seconds to go, Arenas caught an inbounds pass near the top of the key and drove to the basket. The horn sounded before Arenas released a shot, but the officials ruled that Golden State's Mickael Pietrus fouled Arenas with time left on the clock.\n\nWarriors coach Don Nelson was issued a technical foul for arguing the call.\n\nWith the crowd on its feet, Arenas nailed the first two free throws before Golden State called timeout. He then calmly stepped back to the line and sank the third shot.\n\nArenas scored a game-high 32 points, while Jason Richardson led Golden State with 28.\n\nCeltics 124, Timberwolves 117, 2OT\n\nAt Boston, Delonte West scored all 31 of his points after half-time, Paul Pierce added 27 points and Boston beat Minnesota in double overtime for its fourth straight win.\n\nAl Jefferson had 20 points and 14 rebounds, and reserve Ryan Gomes added 21 points and 17 boards for the Celtics, who outscored Minnesota 17-10 in the second overtime.\n\nKevin Garnett led Minnesota with 33 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists. It was his third triple-double of the season and 19th of his career.\n\nRicky Davis scored 35 and Troy Hudson added 26 for the Timberwolves, who have lost six of seven.\n\nSuns 99, Lakers 94\n\nAt Phoenix, Steve Nash scored 18 of his 23 points in the second half -- including two free throws with 5.4 seconds to play, and Phoenix held on to beat Los Angeles.\n\nLeandro Barbosa added 20 points and Amare Stoudemire 17 points and 11 rebounds, but the Suns barely held off a Lakers team without Lamar Odom, out indefinitely after tearing his left labrum on Friday.\n\nShawn Marion had 13 points and 12 rebounds before fouling out with 22.8 seconds to play. Raja Bell scored 14, including two free throws that put Phoenix ahead 97-92 with 18.1 seconds to go.\n\nBulls 126, Bucks 121, OT\n\nAt Milwaukee, Ben Gordon scored a career-high 48 points to help Chicago win in overtime and overcome Michael Redd's 52 for Milwaukee.\n\nGordon, whose previous high was 41 points on Jan. 2 against Phoenix, sparked a frantic fourth-quarter rally for the Bulls as they overcame an 18-point deficit.\n\nGordon had 20 points in the quarter, and Luol Deng added 27 points for the Bulls.\n\nRedd's 52 points is his second-highest total this season, behind the franchise-record 57 he scored on Nov. 10 against Utah, also a loss.\n\nIt is the fourth-highest total in Bucks history. Ruben Patterson added 17 points for the Bucks.\n\n76ers 99, Nets 86\n\nAt Philadelphia, Andre Iguodala scored 21 points and Philadelphia extended its winning streak to a season-high four games.\n\nWillie Green and Kyle Korver each scored 20 points for the Sixers, who rallied from a 17-point deficit in the first quarter for their biggest comeback victory of the season.\n\nJason Kidd posted his 85th career triple-double with 11 points, 14 assists and 14 rebounds. The 10 triple-doubles this year are the most for Kidd in any season. Bostjan Nachbar scored 21 points for the Nets.\n\nJazz 108, Hornets 94\n\nAt Oklahoma City, Mehmet Okur scored 28 points, Deron Williams added 20 and Utah won its fourth straight on the road.\n\nUtah has won eight of its last 10 road games after starting the season 10-10 outside Salt Lake City.\n\nCarlos Boozer picked up his 36th double-double with 17 points and 12 rebounds.\n\nGordan Giricek scored 13 in his first game since going for a season-high 20 against Minnesota on Friday.\n\nSuperSonics 96, Bobcats 89\n\nAt Seattle, Ray Allen's spinning three-point play with 1:25 left capped a 34-point game, and Seattle pulled away late from Charlotte.\n\nAllen, playing with bone spurs in his left ankle, scored 21 in the first half and 10 points in the final seven minutes.\n\nRashard Lewis carried the scoring in the second half for Seattle with 20 of his 28 points.\n\nEarl Watson finished with 10 points and 10 assists off the bench.\n\nGerald Wallace scored 19 points and had nine rebounds, but the Bobcats lost their fifth straight."
