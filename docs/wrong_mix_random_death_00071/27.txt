Cynthia met John when she was 18. They married in 1962 when he was on the cusp of fame with the Beatles after she became pregnant with their only child, Julian Lennon, who was born in 1963. Their marriage was notoriously rocky, with Cynthia claiming her former husband struck her on one occasion.

“He was a very jealous young man at the time, and he had a lot of pain inside,” she said in later years. “He wanted to trust me and he thought by seeing me dancing with a friend of his that I was being disloyal or messing around. So he smacked me, but that was the only time.”

John divorced Cynthia in 1968 and married Yoko Ono in 1969, who he remained with until he was shot and killed in 1980. Cynthia wrote two books about their life together: A Twist of Lennon in 1980 and John in 2005.

Following her death, Julian Lennon posted the following musical tribute to his late mother.
