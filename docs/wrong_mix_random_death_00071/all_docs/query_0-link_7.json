        "text": "How old is Yoko Ono and where is she from?\n\nYoko was born on February 18, 1933. She celebrated her 90th birthday in 2023.\n\nShe was born in Tokyo City, to parents Isoko Ono and Eisuke Ono, a wealthy banker and former classical pianist.\n\nThe kanji translation of Yōko means \"ocean child\".\n\nTwo weeks before Yoko's birth, Eisuke was transferred to San Francisco by his employer. The rest of the family followed later, with Yoko meeting her father when she was two. In 1940, they moved to New York.\n\nWhen did Yoko and John Lennon get married? And what was their relationship like?\n\nOno and Lennon married in 1969 after meeting three years before at an exhibition of Yoko's work in a London gallery.\n\nBefore the pair wed, Lennon was married to his first wife, Cynthia Powell.\n\nBut in May 1968, while Lennon's wife was on holiday, he invited Ono to visit – and his wife came home from her trip to find Yoko wearing her bathrobe and drinking tea with Lennon.\n\nThe Story of... 'Imagine' by John Lennon\n\nTogether they shared one son, Sean Taro Ono Lennon, who is also a musician and songwriter.\n\nThe pair did separate in 1973, but reconciled shortly after and remained married until Lennon's death in 1980.\n\nOno continues to work to preserve his legacy.\n\nWhat art has Yoko created?\n\nBED PEACE starring John Lennon & Yoko Ono\n\nAs a multimedia artist, Yoko has produced a range of works from visual art and performances, to filmmaking and experimental music.\n\nOften, Yoko's earlier artistic works would involve members of the public getting involved, such as walking over a canvas or getting them to cut away parts of her clothing.\n\nWhen she met Lennon, the couple performed experimental artwork together, including their weeklong antiwar protest from their honeymoon suite – also known as their 'Bed-In'."
