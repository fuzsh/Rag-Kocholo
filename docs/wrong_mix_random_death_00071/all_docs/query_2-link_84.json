        "text": "YOKO Ono has previously opened up about the death of her husband, John Lennon, saying that she and his sons still miss him \"after 40 years.\"\n\nThe Japanese artist is known for campaigning for world peace alongside the Beatles singer.\n\nWho is Yoko Ono?\n\nYoko Ono Lennon is an 88-year-old Japanese artist and musician who was married to John Lennon for over ten years from 1969 to 1980.\n\nShe was widowed after Lennon was murdered in Manhattan.\n\nYoko was his second wife after Cynthia Lennon.\n\nTogether the couple had a son, Sean Ono Lennon, who was born in 1975.\n\nWhen did Yoko Ono meet John Lennon?\n\nJohn and Yoko met in London in 1966 at a London gallery, where Ono was preparing for an exhibition of her work.\n\nThey married just three years later.\n\nOne year after Lennon and Ono’s wedding, the Beatles broke up.\n\nOno and Lennon went on to collaborate on a series of music projects.\n\nTheir last album together released before his death was Double Fantasy, which came out in 1980, just three weeks before Lennon’s assassination.\n\nWhat has she said about Mark David Chapman's parole applications?\n\nEach time Mark Chapman has applied for parole, the late John Lennon’s wife has written to the parole board to tell them to keep him in jail.\n\nShe has said that Chapman’s release would endanger her and his two sons.\n\nOn December 8, 2020, the 40th anniversary of her husband's assassination, she tweeted: \"The death of a loved one is a hollowing experience. After 40 years, Sean, Julian and I still miss him.\"\n\nChapman is serving a life prison sentence at the Wende Correctional Facility in Alden, New York, for fatally shooting John Lennon at the entrance to the Dakota apartment building in New York City on December 8, 1980.\n\nChapman fired five times at Lennon, hitting him four times in the back, before sitting down on the curb with a book awaiting the police.\n\nIt is said he killed the musician in a bid to earn instant notoriety.\n\nAccording to hearing transcripts, Chapman killed Lennon because he was \"angry and jealous\" at the way he was living and was seeking \"glory\" for himself.\n\nHe has served 40 years in prison already, having been denied parole for the 11th time in 2020.\n\nHe will have to wait another two years before he can apply for parole again."
