        "text": "A reflection of the men in Cynthia’s life.\n\nNote: Although not primarily a countdown list, I did more or less rank the men from who I considered the least substantial, to the most significant. While all were crucial in Cynthia’s life, some I think just left a bigger impact. And as always, this is just my opinion.\n\nNumber 5: John Twist\n\nNot surprising Twist would be on the bottom. Not to say that the guy was bad. But of the men that she was romantically involved with, this is the one where she seemed the most regretful about. She realized marrying him wasn’t a good idea, on the very day she married him. Also, I think Cynthia even said (I have to read the book again) that Twist always felt like he was living under the shadow of Lennon and couldn’t compete with that.\n\nWith that said, Twist did care about Cynthia and Julian. He showed compassion after John’s death, even though by that point the marriage had sanked. He also was one of the main people who encouraged her to write her first book. Even though Cynthia had mix feelings about the overall publication of “A Twist of Lennon”, (especially after John tried to sue her), I think Twist’s intentions came from a good place. He felt she had a right to be heard and gain something from all her hard work over the years. Decent guy overall.\n\nNumber 4: Jim Christie\n\nDespite the fact that Christie and Cynthia were together for 17 years, not much is known about their time together. Here is the info that I was able to find:\n\nShe began a relationship with Liverpudlian chauffeur Jim Christie in 1981, who became her partner for 17 years as well as her business manager, living in Penrith, Cumbria. She said at the time: “Jim has never felt he’s living in John Lennon’s shadow. He’s four years younger than me and wasn’t really part of that whole Beatles’ scene.” They later lived on the Isle of Man and then Normandy for some years, but separated in 1998.\n\nMore so than her other relationships, this one has been left rather private. I’m not sure if part of that has to do with the fact that they never married. But I see nothing wrong in Cynthia wanting to keep her relationships private. I think after the craziness of being a Beatles wife, privacy is the best thing you could want. And even though not much is known about Christie, it seems that he made her happy. It’s just too bad that the quality of their photos aren’t better.\n\nNumber 3: Roberto Bassanini\n\nRoberto always striked me as a nice dude. That smile just screams out warmth and friendliness. Judging by the pictures, it’s not hard to see why she married him. He just seems like a person you want to be around with. A person who will appreciate and love you. And that’s exactly what Roberto was for Cynthia and Julian. Personally, I would have loved for this relationship to work out. But alas that wasn’t the case. At least this one ended more peacefully than the first one.\n\nOne thing that definitely makes Roberto stand out from the other men though, was how great of a father figure he was for Julian, more so than John. I think that was the main reason why Cynthia married him, so that he could be there for her son. Of course, his kindness to her also helped her feel better during a very tough time in her life. Although I always thought she should have given herself more time before jumping into another marriage so quickly. But at least when looking at some of the pictures, you can tell that Cynthia was able to find moments of great happiness with Roberto.\n\nNumber 2: Noel Charles\n\nIt’s so great to know that Cynthia’s last relationship was a successful marriage to a man who truly loved her. When Cynthia died, May Pang said a few kind words about her friend. One thing she mentioned was that Noel was her soulmate. And I actually kind of agree. Although Cynthia kept things pretty private, what little things she would mention about Noel definitely showed that she loved him deeply. They loved cooking together, he brought her out of her shell, he never felt pressure to live under John’s shadow, and was a great friend to her and Julian.\n\nHis passing hurt her very much, and it was clear that by that time, the love she had for him was probably just as strong as the one she had for John. It’s sad that Noel died. But I’m also happy that after many years, Cynthia was able to have a happy marriage from beginning to end.\n\nNumber 1: John Lennon\n\nNo matter which way you look at it, no man will ever be what John Lennon was for Cynthia. Truly the love of her life, the 10 years she spent by his side shaped her tremendously. And although the last 2 weren’t the happiest, the majority of their life together was full of love, happiness, excitement, and passion.\n\nMost of you who follow me have seen the list I made about the sweetest moments between the couple, so I won’t go into too much detail about that. But I will say that no matter how their marriage ended, there is something so special about first love. And even though many fans see Yoko as the love of John’s life, I will always believe that no women ever loved him the way Cynthia did. I like to hope that at some points after their divorce, he was aware of how great of a woman she was to him. Sadly that’s something we will never know. But I hope that all of Cynthia’s fans can somehow let others know that their love wasn’t forced or fabricated. It was and always will be real.\n\nHonorable Mention: Julian Lennon\n\nIn all honesty, Julian shouldn’t even be a honorable mention.\n\nIf there’s one dude in Cynthia’s life that has loved her unconditionally, it’s Julian. Probably one of the sweetest mother and son relationships in real life, Cynthia and Julian’s life was full of ups and downs. But they prevailed through all of them together. And even when some men would come and go in her life, Julian was always loyal to his dear mother.\n\nIt’s sad that Cynthia is no longer with us. Not just because she was a good person, but because how much Julian misses her. But it’s clear that her influence in his life shaped him to be a wonderful and gracious human being. And let’s hope and pray that Julian will stay with us for a long time."
