        "text": "John Legend and Chrissy Teigen have been giving us serious relationship goals for years, as the parents hilariously navigate parenting four young children and playfully poke fun at each other on social media. It’s hard to believe in September 2023 the couple will celebrate 10 years of wedded bliss.\n\nHow to Watch\n\nWatch the Season 26 premiere of The Voice on Monday, September 23 at 8/7c on NBC and next day on Peacock.\n\nIn honor of the marital milestone, let’s take a look back at John Legend and Chrissy Teigen's breathtaking wedding in Lake Como, Italy in September 2013.\n\nJohn Legend's Proposal to Chrissy Teigen\n\nThe romance began in 2006 after the couple met on the set of Legend’s music video for “Stereo.” As a model, Teigen was cast in the video. It didn’t take long for the pair to notice their palpable connection to each other.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\n“The shoot was pretty up close and personal, and I got to know her big personality — she’s very fun, very clever, very gregarious,” Legend told Martha Stewart Weddings. “It’s not the normal way to court someone, but hey, it worked.”\n\nSeven years later, The Voice Coach proposed on the beach while the couple was vacationing in the Maldives for Christmas 2011.\n\nRELATED: Why John Legend & Chrissy Teigen Have Been So Open About Building Their Family\n\n“There was no big grand speech or anything, it was just very lovely and sweet,” Teigen once shared on her talk show, FABLife, according to Brides Magazine.\n\nWhy did John Legend and Chrissy Teigen get married in Italy?\n\nThe couple’s picturesque nuptials amidst the backdrop of Lake Como almost had a much different vibe.\n\nTeigen shared with Martha Stewart Weddings that the couple initially thought about saying their “I dos” on a farm in the South.\n\n“For a minute, I was like, ‘I’m going to wear cowboy boots with my dress!’” Teigen recalled. “Then I realized, that’s just not me.”\n\nThe couple abandoned the plan and decided to tie the knot in a location with more sentimental meaning: Italy.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\n“One of the first vacations we took together was to Lake Como, so we thought it would be nice to marry where we fell in love,” Legend explained.\n\nJohn Legend and Chrissy Teigen's Wedding Day: Details\n\nThe big day finally arrived on September 14, 2013, but it didn’t exactly go off without a hitch.\n\nTeigen shared with The Knot the wedding was delayed for four hours as guests battled travel issues. Being the gracious hosts that they are, Legend and Teigen opted to wait until all their loved ones could arrive before exchanging their vows.\n\n\"[The guests] had a lot of cocktails, because the ceremony was running about four hours behind,\" Teigen explained. \"Yeah… [some of our] family missed their flight. The flight was canceled, and I wasn't even aware of it because everyone wanted to keep it a secret from me. They didn't want to stress me out. So whatever it was, it was a lot.\"\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nThe couple did eventually get their storybook wedding, with the help of event designer Lisa Vorce. Legend and Teigen exchanged vows in front of the picturesque lake as their 125 guests looked on.\n\nTeigen’s eight bridesmaids, including model and actress Brooklyn Decker, wore Amsale gowns in blush tones, enhancing the romantic feel of the moment.\n\nChrissy Teigen's Wedding Dress\n\nWhy just have one amazing wedding dress when you could have three?\n\nRELATED: John Legend's Mother's Day Post for Chrissy Teigen Might Make You Cry\n\nTeigen treated her wedding guests to more than one stylish look, first walking down the aisle in a Vera Wang ivory strapless dress with a tulle ball gown that was exuding some serious princess vibes, according to Brides Magazine.\n\nAfter the ceremony, Teigen donned yet another Wang creation, which she shared in an Instagram post. It was a white mermaid gown with pleated bodice and organza skirt.\n\n\"Each time I went for a fitting, I saw another awesome gown,\" she told Martha Stewart Weddings of the frequent dress changes.\n\nHer final look was a stunning red mermaid gown perfect for a party.\n\nChrissy Teigen and John Legend's Wedding Reception\n\nPhoto: Stefanie Keenan/Getty Images for LOVED01\n\nWhen the groom is a Grammy-winning singer, guests can expect some epic music and that’s just what they got. Legend took the stage himself to sing his hit “All of Me.” Music legend Stevie Wonder also wowed guests with his live performance of “Ribbons in the Sky.”\n\nWhen guests weren’t out on the dance floor, they were dining on a lavish four-tiered naked carrot cake with cream cheese frosting. The dessert was so delectable, Teigen later took to Instagram to reminisce.\n\n“Someone tagged me in a photo of my wedding cake and my fat-ss wants cake so bad now so here is a pic of my wedding cake,” she hilariously wrote alongside a photo of the cake. “It was carrot with cream cheese frosting and it was awesome. I miss you, giant cake.”\n\nEven with the slight hiccups, the day remains a treasured moment in the couple’s life together.\n\nOn their five-year anniversary, Teigen shared a stunning photo of the couple kissing in front of the lake on their wedding day, along with a caption about being “grateful” for their life together."
