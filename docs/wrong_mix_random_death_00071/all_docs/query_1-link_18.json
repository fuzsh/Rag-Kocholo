        "text": "Sad news: Cynthia Lennon, the late John Lennon‘s wife from 1962-1968, has died at age 75 from cancer. According to a rep, her sole child with the former Beatle — Julian Lennon — was with her at the time of her death.\n\nPaul McCartney, Ringo Starr & Yoko Ono Remember Cynthia Lennon\n\nHere’s the statement:\n\n“Cynthia Lennon passed away today at her home in Mallorca, Spain following a short but brave battle with cancer. Her son Julian Lennon was at her bedside throughout. The family are thankful for your prayers. Please respect their privacy at this difficult time.”\n\nGone But Not Forgotten: Music Luminaries We Lost\n\nCynthia met John when she was 18. They married in 1962 when he was on the cusp of fame with the Beatles after she became pregnant with their only child, Julian Lennon, who was born in 1963. Their marriage was notoriously rocky, with Cynthia claiming her former husband struck her on one occasion.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\n“He was a very jealous young man at the time, and he had a lot of pain inside,” she said in later years. “He wanted to trust me and he thought by seeing me dancing with a friend of his that I was being disloyal or messing around. So he smacked me, but that was the only time.”\n\nJohn divorced Cynthia in 1968 and married Yoko Ono in 1969, who he remained with until he was shot and killed in 1980. Cynthia wrote two books about their life together: A Twist of Lennon in 1980 and John in 2005.\n\nFollowing her death, Julian Lennon posted the following musical tribute to his late mother."
