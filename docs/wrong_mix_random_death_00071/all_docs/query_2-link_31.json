        "text": "John:\n\nOkay, Yoko\n\nYoko:\n\nPeace -\n\nPeace -\n\nLet's hope for peace,\n\nLet's hope for peace,\n\nPeace -\n\nLet's hope for peace,\n\nPeace -\n\nLet's hope for peace.\n\nJohn:\n\nPeace, peace, peace, peace\n\nYoko:\n\nPeace -\n\nLet's hope for peace,\n\nYoko:\n\nPeace -\n\nLet's hope for peace,\n\nPeace -\n\nLet's hope for peace.\n\nOh, John, let's hope for peace\n\nFor our children,\n\nFor our country,\n\nFor our world,\n\nFor our future,\n\nOh, John, let's hope for peace,\n\nLet's hope for peace.\n\nPeace -\n\nPeace, peace,\n\nPet's hope for peace.\n\nOh, John -\n\nJohn:\n\nPeace.\n\nGood morgan meine damen und herren, this is the peace call.\n\n---------\n\nWhat we're really doing is sending out a message to the world but mainly to the youth, especially the youth or anybody really that's interested in protesting for peace or protesting against any forms of violence and we say everybody's getting a bit heavy or bit intellectual about it.\n\nEverybody's talking about peace but nobody's doing anything about it except for a few people and the things like the Grosvenor Square Marches in London. The end product of it was just newspaper stories about riots and fighting and we did the Bed Event in Amsterdam and the Bag Peace in Vienna just to give people an idea that there's many ways of protest and this is one of them and anybody could grow their hair for peace or give up a week of their holiday for peace or sit in a bag for peace.\n\nProtest against peace any way. But peacefully. 'Cause we think that peace is only got by peaceful methods and that to fight the establishment with their own weapons is no good because they always win and they've been winning for thousands of years. They know how to play the game violence and it's easier for them when they can recognise you and shoot you but they don't know how to handle humour and peaceful humour and that's our message really.\n\nInterviewer:\n\nWhat do you think was the biggest success in history, last 300 years?\n\nJohn:\n\nHaven't a clue.\n\nYoko:\n\nWell, maybe it's still yet to happen, you see. That's why we're trying to do it. In other words, by very, very peaceful methods to bring peace, you know, instead of peace through violence, that's what we're trying to do and if we succeed in that, that's the biggest happening yet in the last 300 years because it's never been done and nobody has really tried it, you see, and that's what we're trying to do.\n\nInterviewer:\n\nWhat would you do in case of war?\n\nJohn:\n\nHow do you mean?\n\nInterviewer:\n\nWhat would you do, immediately, if you would wake up in the morning, read the newspapers and they would tell you England is in war with France?\n\nJohn:\n\nI'd probably... I'd die of fright.\n\nYoko:\n\nI don't think that should happen. You talk as if something's going to happen aside of us. We are all in this you see. We are all in the same society and in the same world and everything that happens to us is our responsibility, you know.\n\nLike any violence going in the world is just a symbol of all the violent atmosphere that is in the world, you see, and when the Nazism persecuted the Jewish people that wasn't only Hitler who did it, or Germany who did it, but just a symbol of everybody in the world who had the feeling for persecution of Jews, you see. So we share everything, so that's not gonna happen, if there's war suddenly, that's our fault, you know.\n\nInterviewer:\n\nSo what do you think about the behaviour of Austrians and Germans during the Second World War? Don't you think that they're a little bit more responsible than the others?\n\nJohn:\n\nNo, not particularly.\n\nYoko:\n\nNo, not particularly. No. The whole world, if the whole world was really aware of it and if the journalists and the communication media of those days were really aware of their responsibility as well and reported everything correct, you know, well, which is almost impossible, I'm sure, but as much as possible and if the whole world was aware of their responsibility, it could have been stopped, I'm sure.\n\nJohn:\n\nWell, we know that Britain and a few other counties waited quite a long time before they made any decision about what to do. I'm not quite sure of the facts, you know, but after Czechoslovakia and things like that. They could've stopped it earlier, but they wait until it's on their doorstep, you know, until it involves their money, or their territory.\n\nInterviewer:\n\nAre you saying there's a special type of politician that is voted by a special country? I don't think that a politician like-\n\nJohn:\n\nNo. I don't think so because...\n\nInterviewer:\n\n-Hitler could ever be voted by the French, for instance.\n\nJohn:\n\nOh come on, the French, the French-\n\nInterviewer:\n\nI'm mean just the type of politician\n\nJohn:\n\nWell okay, just, different types then\n\nYoko:\n\nEvery nation is bad.\n\nJohn:\n\nEvery nation will have a prototype. But you name, I think I was talking to one of the Austrian T.V. guys. I said, “Can you name me one European country which hasn't sort of raped the world?” and he said, “Austria actually was the only one that didn't attack anybody else. They were always on the defensive side.” I don't know whether that's true.\n\nInterviewer:\n\nBut they were silent at the wrong moment...\n\nJohn:\n\nOkay, that's bad, I agree with that silence is bad. But I mean there isn't one European country that hasn't had its Hitler, one way or the other, including Britain, in what they did to India and South Africa, you know.\n\nYoko:\n\nSo let's so back to the future, you know. So that's why we're here. We want to talk mainly to the young people all over the world because those are the people who are going to be the next generation. They're going to be the next world, you know, and we just want to say we are with them. We are not preaching or anything like that. We want to be with them and we're with them and in our way, we're just announcing that we're open to all invitations or suggestions or anything to work for the world peace, you see, and we're doing it in our own way, which we think is the best for us and also the young people have to realise that this is just as bad as before the Second World War or right in the middle of it, you know, that everything, all the violence that is happening in the world now are our responsibility and if we don't really realise it and immediately start something, action, you know, it's going to be bad, you know. And it will be exactly like you said; One morning, we find in the newspaper, that the whole world is going to disappear, you know.\n\nInterviewer:\n\nI agree with you, but don't you see, I mean, it's a fact that by through your behaviour, I think it's okay, but for a lot of people, through your behaviour, they get suspicious. They don't think that this is, can be correct, people sitting under a tablecloth protesting against wars. They don't think...\n\nYoko:\n\nOkay, before they criticise us, you know, and if they want to criticise us, okay, go ahead, and they should do it in their own way, but do something, you know.\n\nInterviewer:\n\nSo everybody should throw out his part of Hitler out of his soul, then?\n\nJohn:\n\nYes, yes, we all have it in us. In a way, we're saying we want peace and we're staying in bed for peace, but I'm as violent as the next man, and I'm sure Yoko is just as violent just as well. We're violent people, you know. I prefer myself when I'm non-violent. I prefer me friends when they're non-violent. It just makes for easier living and if we have to have violence, let's channel it, you know. I don't know how, you know, there's other people can work out how to channel it, or give them somewhere to play and kill each other or something. But I don't want to be involved in their violence. I prefer to live in peace, you know.\n\nYoko:\n\nAll you need is courage, you know. You can just go out in the street now and take off all your clothes and just say peace you know and you'll be in the news you see. Just courage and if everybody gets courage and of course they would, because they would think all right maybe this is a little bit embarrassing thing to do, but look at John and Yoko they're doing worse, so I can do it, you know. That's all we're trying to do, you see.\n\nInterviewer:\n\nSo you're putting courage, also, into the world by doing this?\n\nJohn:\n\nWe hope so.\n\nYoko:\n\nI hope so.\n\nInterviewer:\n\nLet's do the rest in the car because-\n\nJohn:\n\nOkay.\n\n---------\n\n(Beach atmosphere with electronic mechanical noises)\n\nJohn:\n\nStay in bed!\n\n---------\n\nJohn:\n\nLook a little fly flitting bout.\n\nJust makes you laugh hearing that thing going off.\n\nYoko:\n\nWhat time is it?\n\nJohn:\n\nWhat's the time?\n\nInterviewer:\n\n9:30\n\nJohn:\n\nIs it? is it that late?\n\nYoko:\n\nWhat?\n\nJohn:\n\n9:30. Good morning. I was saying about Bagism, you see, you get in this bag and you jump out the window. Next thing you know, you got a policeman on your head. You want tea?\n\nYoko:\n\nYes, okay, you know what I want, John?\n\nJohn:\n\nWhat - What, what, what!? Oh, give us a chance! You want one before I do.\n\nYoko:\n\nDo I?\n\nJohn:\n\nYes, I haven't even got round to that.\n\nCould I have room service, please.\n\nDo you want toast?\n\nYoko:\n\nJust tea please. Which do you want, coffee or tea?\n\nJohn:\n\nTea.\n\nYoko:\n\nTea.\n\nJohn:\n\nTwo tea's please. Yeah, 902 and some toast. Yeah, brown toast.\n\nGood morning. Yeah, yeah. No and some toast. Brown toast. Yeah. Thank you. Bye, bye.\n\nAlright then....\n\n---------\n\nJohn:\n\nHello, dog. It's beautiful though isn't it?\n\nInterviewer:\n\nYou are not afraid for dogs are you?\n\nJohn:\n\nNo, no, no. It'll just take a lot of looking after. We'll think about you, Amsterdam. He's a lovely dog, though.\n\nYoko:\n\nYes, yes, it's lovely.\n\nJohn:\n\nThank you very much.\n\n---------\n\nInterviewer:\n\nHere you are.\n\nJohn:\n\nThank you. Are you gonna take him off me now?\n\nInterviewer:\n\nYes, if you don't mind. Of course, It's one of the Ezelium so we have to have it back. Thank you very much.\n\nJohn:\n\nI thought you were giving - They just did a plug then.\n\nInterviewer:\n\nBye, bye.\n\nJohn:\n\nBye, bye.\n\nYoko:\n\nWhat was it? They were not going to give us?\n\nJohn:\n\nNo, no.\n\nInterviewer:\n\nShe didn't want to give you the dog?\n\nJohn:\n\nNo\n\nInterviewer:\n\nI thought she gave the dog to you\n\nJohn:\n\nI was under that impression. That we were given a dog. She gave us the dog and then went away. Well that was very nice.\n\n---------\n\nYoko:\n\nThat's rather sort of really swinging though. Don't you think so?\n\nJohn:\n\nThe thought of the long haired Beatle entering a 19th century sanctuary.\n\n---------\n\nJohn:\n\n“Please stop this nonsense. Go home. We don't like people like you. Go to a doctor to be normal,” are you getting this? “Go to a doctor to be normal.”\n\nWe're seeing a psychiatrist today, so maybe he'll fix us up then.\n\nBloody marvellous. We not getting through on some levels, as you notice.\n\n---------\n\nJohn:\n\nWas that the marijuana. Beautiful, beautiful. Keep smoking. Let's open it up, there's nothing illegal in here? Beautiful, beautiful. Thanks a lot. Hey, those kids are as hard as the real press.\n\nYoko:\n\nYes, amazing.\n\nJohn:\n\nAmazing. They're just as tough as the real press. Incredible. Very sexy. It's a boy, it's a boy.\n\n---------\n\nInterviewer:\n\nwhy are you staying in bed for 7 days?\n\nJohn:\n\nBecause...\n\n---------\n\nJohn:\n\nCould we have a tea for Robbie please?\n\nInterviewer:\n\nWell, first of all, let me say congratulations on your marriage and that in Dutch is gefiliciteerd met je getrouw.\n\nJohn:\n\n(German accent)Oh, dank u wel, oh, chocolat!\n\nInterviewer:\n\nHow about explaining this mission you are on at this moment?\n\nJohn:\n\nWell, you start, I've been...\n\nYoko:\n\nWell, because we thought of this idea about staying in bed for 7 days for protest against violence in the world.\n\nInterviewer:\n\nDid you think of its geographical situation as being the centre of Europe?\n\nJohn:\n\nNo, I didn't realise, is it? Oh, fantastic! It was magic then, you see, cause I mean -\n\nInterviewer:\n\nThey call it the centre of Europe in fact. It's an advertising campaign for an airline.\n\nJohn:\n\nOkay, well give us a free ticket and we'll be all right.\n\n---------\n\nCrowd:\n\nStand up!\n\nJohn:\n\nStand up?\n\nInterviewer:\n\nStand up on your knees, maybe. Turn and, turn and on your knees. As soon as we can but we need you here, not yet, not yet, start talking yes.\n\nJohn:\n\nSo, anyway a policeman came in and an elephant jumped on me head, so I said what's going on and he said cabbages and the next moment I was on film, yeah.\n\nYoko:\n\nJust to give a laugh you know\n\nInterviewer:\n\nJust wave, just wave!\n\nInterviewer:\n\nLove, peace and bed! Not forgetting jam of course.\n\nInterviewer:\n\nOkay, guess now it's over?\n\nJohn:\n\nPushy kid, that.\n\nInterviewer:\n\nAre you cold?\n\nJohn:\n\nNo, no, no! Pushy kid that, asking for photos, could I have my ciggies?\n\nInterviewer:\n\nCiggies, yeah, music, you know, if you go back to the days of a, of a, let's see, where do we start now, we start with, “Do you love me?”\n\nJohn:\n\nNot, not particularly.\n\n---------\n\nInterviewer:\n\nHow about that?\n\nJohn:\n\n(singing) Good-bye Amsterdam, good-bye.\n\n---------\n\nYoko:\n\nStay in bed,\n\nFor Bed-Peace,\n\nFor peace of the world,\n\nStay in bed,\n\nGrow your hair.\n\nJohn:\n\nGrow your hair.\n\nOkay, good night.\n\n---------\n\nJohn:\n\nNow it's time to say good night,\n\nGood night, sleep tight.\n\nNow the sun puts out his light.\n\nThank you very much\n\nYoko:\n\nWhat a beautiful day it was though, very tiring, though.\n\nIt was sort of churning like crazy, you know.\n\nJohn:\n\nAlso get that sort of hot?\n\n---------\n\nYoko:\n\nGrow your hair.\n\nJohn:\n\nBed peace.\n\nYoko:\n\nHair peace.\n\nJohn:\n\nHair peace, bed peace.\n\nOh, yeah.\n\n---------"
