        "text": "Honeymoons are, by their very nature, meant to be memorable. They are the post-wedding breaks that define the first happy moments of a freshly hitched couple's life together; romantic episodes devoted to love, laughter and, you know, all that other good stuff. They are supposed to be catalogued in endless photos, snippets of video footage and (in these early years of the 21st century especially) social-media posts - with each snapshot showing its subjects beaming of smile and warm of body language.\n\nBut then, some honeymoons are more memorable than others. This week marks the passing of an exact half-century since John Lennon sat - in his pyjamas - alongside his new wife Yoko Ono in the first and most famous of their \"bed-ins for peace\".\n\nThe just-marrieds spent March 25-31 1969 ensconced in a suite at the Hilton Amsterdam, with just a few dozen journalists for company. They had tied the knot five days earlier - bringing to an end a whirlwind spell of speculation that had seen the Beatle secure a rapid divorce from his first wife Cynthia to be with the glamorous Japanese artist he had met little more than two years previously.\n\nThe ongoing fuss about the Beatle and his lover - and the fact that the bed-in was part of their post-nuptial \"holiday\" - was used as a carrot to attract the media to the message they were pushing (essentially \"make love, not war\"). And it worked - the enamoured pair enjoyed a stay in the Dutch capital that was largely characterised by flashing cameras, pointed questions and brows furrowed in confusion.\n\nAnd yet, the bed-in was not even the most surreal moment of a honeymoon that flitted to two other countries before arriving back in Britain. Lennon was at the peak of his fame, and the couple's movements across the continent made constant headlines.\n\nIt was also a grand enough process to merit a Lennon composition in its honour. The Ballad of John and Yoko, released as a stand-alone track on May 30 1969, occupies a curious place in the Beatles canon. It was the group's 17th and final number one hit in the UK. It was, as ever, credited to the Lennon-McCartney songwriting partnership - but it is a pure Lennon composition. It was recorded by only two members of the band (Lennon wanted it committed to tape as soon as he was back from honeymoon - despite the fact that George Harrison and Ringo Starr were both away. Paul McCartney played drums in the latter's absence). And it flirts, consciously, with controversy - Lennon's repeated complaint that \"the way things are going, they're going to crucify me\" is a deliberate reference back to his seismic 1966 interview comment that the Beatles were \"more popular than Jesus\", which caused the group such problems in the United States.\n\nBut as well as this, it is a travelogue - one that lays out, in depth, Lennon and Ono's manic dash in the eye of a tabloid storm. Indeed, so detailed are the lyrics that what occurred in 1969 can easily be traced here in 2019. Not, perhaps, in its entirety - theirs was an odd itinerary. But take a trip to any of Paris, Gibraltar, Vienna or Amsterdam in the next few days, and you will be walking (or, maybe, bedding in) in musical history...\n\nParis\n\nWhen: March 16-25 1969\n\nThe Lennon-Ono honeymoon was particularly unusual in that it was not, strictly, a honeymoon until several days after it had begun. Perhaps inspired by McCartney's marriage to Linda Eastman, which had taken place in Marylebone on March 12, the couple had been looking for somewhere to stage their own swift ceremony - and had even, remarkably, toyed with tying the knot on a cross-channel ferry, only to be told that this wasn't possible. Hence the lyrics which kick off The Ballad of John and Yoko: \"Standing in the dock at Southampton, trying to get to Holland or France, the man in the mac said, 'you've got to go back', you know they didn't even give us a chance.\"\n\nLennon would later explain: \"We wanted to get married on a cross-channel ferry. That was the romantic part. When we went to Southampton and then we couldn't get on because she wasn't English and she couldn't get the day visa to go across. And they said: 'Anyway, you can't get married. The captain's not allowed to do it any more'.\"\n\nInstead, they chartered a private plane, and flew to Paris - where their ambitions were thwarted again. This time, they were told that they couldn't marry, because they needed to have been resident in France for longer. They did, however, manage to check in to the Plaza Athenee hotel, and would stay there for nine nights.\n\nThe Ballad of John and Yoko refers to this: \"Finally made the plane into Paris, honeymooning down by the Seine\" (the video for the single includes footage of them sitting by the river). The stay was not without incidents. March 24 saw the couple having lunch with Salvador Dali.\n\nDo it yourself: The Plaza Athenee is still very much a fixture of chic Paris. It is located just off the Champs Elysees, at 25 Avenue Montaigne - as it has been since 1913. It has long been a magnet for artists, musicians and designers - Christian Dior set up his first couture house next to it in 1947. It comes with a room rate to match - expect to pay from €1029 for a double room, not including breakfast (dorchestercollection.com). That money won't buy you an audience with Salvador Dali, for obvious reasons - but you can admire his surrealist genius at the Espace Dali, in Montmartre (daliparis.com).\n\nGibraltar\n\nWhen: March 20 1969\n\nLennon's plan to get married as soon as he could had foundered twice. But third time proved to be the charm, thanks to Peter Brown, who was a crucial part of the Beatles's management team at Apple Records.\n\nThe Ballad of John and Yoko takes up the tale in the lines \"Peter Brown called to say, 'you can make it OK - you can get married in Gibraltar near Spain'.\" Gibraltar, as a British Overseas Territory, had no problems with the singer flying in to swap vows - and this is exactly what happened. The couple chartered a plane, flew south, and went directly to the British Consulate, where the ceremony was performed in 10 minutes. Photos show husband and wife posing in front of the Rock of Gibraltar, Lennon holding their just-inked marriage certificate gleefully aloft. They were back on their jet, and back to Paris, before the evening was out. Fast work.\n\n\"We went there [Gibraltar], and it was beautiful,\" Lennon would later explain. \"They called it the 'end of the world' at one period. They thought the world outside was a mystery from there, so it was like the gateway to the world. So we liked it in the symbolic sense, and the Rock [symbolised the] foundation of our relationship.\"\n\nDo it yourself: Even if you aren't the most famous rock star of your generation, and you aren't trying to get married away from the insistent gaze of the international press, Gibraltar merits more than a few hours of your time. A three-night stay at appropriately named four-star hotel The Rock, flying from Gatwick on May 23, costs from around £386 per person through British Airways Holidays (0344 493 0787; ba.com/holidays).\n\nAmsterdam\n\nWhen: March 25-31 1969\n\nLennon and Ono left Paris on the morning of March 25, and were chauffeured north-west to Amsterdam. Again, The Ballad of John and Yoko gives the gist of it: \"Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton, talking in our beds for a week. The newspapers said, 'say what're you doing in bed?', I said 'we're only trying to get us some peace'.\"\n\nTheir bed-in in the Dutch capital has become one of the signature scenes of the \"Peace and Love\" era. But for all its hippyish context (the couple long of hair, surrounded by placards as they sat propped up on pillows), it was also a canny piece of self-promotion.\n\nLennon's amusement was audible in his subsequent explanation of the stunt - with its tacit admission that the media had fallen for his vague hint that they might witness him and Yoko doing something a little more X-rated than obliquely protesting against the Vietnam War from the comfort a five-star suite. \"We sent out a card: 'Come to John and Yoko's honeymoon: a bed-in, Amsterdam Hotel',\" he recalled. \"You should have seen the faces on the reporters and cameramen fighting their way through the door. Because whatever it is, is in people's minds – their minds were full of what they thought was going to happen. They fought their way in, and their faces dropped. There were we like two angels in bed, with flowers all around us, and peace and love on our heads. We were fully clothed; the bed was just an accessory. We were wearing pyjamas, but they don't look much different from day clothes – nothing showing.\"\n\nHe would also go on to insist that the spectacle was, in part, a joke. \"It's part of our policy not to be taken seriously,\" he would argue. \"Our opposition, whoever they may be, in all manifest forms, don't know how to handle humour. And we are humorous.\"\n\nDo it yourself: The most iconic part of the Lennon-Ono honeymoon is also the most easily traced - as the Hilton Amsterdam (0031 20 710 6000; hilton.com) is still very much a part of the city's accommodation jigsaw. The couple stayed in the presidential suite - which, at the time, was also Room 902. It later became Room 702 when the property was renovated - but is now The John and Yoko Suite. Yours from €1,991 per night - although this does include breakfast. Which you should obviously take in bed.\n\nVienna\n\nWhen: March 31-April 1 1969\n\nAs if their trip hadn't pushed the envelope enough, the final stop on the Lennon-Ono honeymoon tour teetered on the verge of farce. Or perhaps comedy. It was hard to tell.\n\nThe lyrics to The Ballad of John and Yoko make it sound strange enough: \"Made a lightning trip to Vienna, eating chocolate cake in a bag. The newspapers said, 'She's gone to his head, they look just like two Gurus in a drag'.\" But the reality was perhaps even more curious than the song suggests, and made the bed-in look ordinary by comparison.\n\nThe couple flew from Amsterdam to Vienna, and checked in to the Hotel Sacher. Then things got weird. They had been invited to the city for the Austrian premiere of Ono's provocatively titled black-and-white film Rape (where a young woman is followed around London by a cameraman for 77 minutes). This was an excuse for a press conference where the couple sat unseen in a large white bag, and answered questions without ever emerging.\n\nAgain, Lennon's mirth is audible decades later. \"We came down the elevator in the bag and we went in and we got comfortable and they were all ushered in,\" he would say. \"It was a very strange scene because they'd never seen us before, or heard – Vienna is a pretty square place. A few people were saying, 'Come on, get out of the bags.' And we wouldn't let them see us... We said, 'This is total communication with no prejudice.' It was just great. They asked us to sing and we sang a few numbers. Yoko was singing a Japanese folk song. Just very straight we did it. They never did see us.\"\n\nDo it yourself: The Hotel Sacher (sacher.com) has probably just about recovered from the hilarity of it all. Opened in 1876, it is a five-star bastion at the heart of Vienna's core Innere Stadt - where it faces the equally grand Vienna State Opera. Expect to pay from €350 and up for a double room. And while you probably won't be allowed to sit under a sheet in the middle of lobby, you can copy Lennon to some extent by eating some of the chocolate cake for which the hotel is famous. You can indulge at the attached Cafe Sacher, where a slice of the signature Sachertorte (with whipped cream) costs €7.50.\n\nPostscript\n\nThe couple flew home on April 1 (\"Caught the early plane back to London...\") - and Lennon was soon in the studio, recording The Ballad of John and Yoko at Abbey Road on April 14. But the newly-weds considered their bed-in such a success that they decided to repeat it. But this time, they would take the show across the Atlantic Ocean...\n\nThe Bahamas\n\nWhen: May 24-25 1969\n\nInitially, the plan had been to hold the second bed-in in New York. But because Lennon had been convicted of cannabis possession the previous November, he could not enter the US. Instead, they flew to the Bahamas, Lennon arguing that this was \"the nearest we can get to America without a visa. We'll beam broadcasts from there, and hope they change their minds about us.\" They holed up at the Sheraton Oceanus Hotel in Freeport (on Grand Bahama), but after spending one night struggling to sleep in the heat, flew on...\n\nDo it yourself: The hotel has faded into history. Indeed, you need to stay on a different island even to come close. The Melia (melia.com) resort in Nassau (on New Providence) was once a Sheraton hotel. A seven-night stay, flying from Heathrow on November 21, costs from £2,388 a head with Virgin Holidays (0344 739 3162; virginholidays.co.uk).\n\nMontreal\n\nWhen: May 26-June 2 1969\n\nCanada was a more logical option for a bed-in designed to attract America's attention. After a flight to Toronto and a night in a hotel there, Lennon and Ono decamped to Montreal and the Queen Elizabeth Hotel. They would spend eight days there, taking over rooms 1738, 1740, 1742 and 1744 - and welcoming guests such as poet Allen Ginsburg and psychologist Timothy Leary. On June 1, they recorded the anti-war anthem Give Peace A Chance - which was released on July 4 as Lennon's first single as a solo artist (although he officially remained a member of the Beatles for another 11 months)."
