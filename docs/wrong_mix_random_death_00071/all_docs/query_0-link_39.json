        "text": "History Highlight:\n\nSister Rosetta Tharpe was born in Cotton Plant, Arkansas, today in 1915. Nicknamed “the Godmother of rock and roll,” Tharpe was a pioneer in using an electric guitar with heavy distortion, and was influential to many of the first stars of rock — such as Little Richard, Elvis Presley, and Chuck Berry. Her 1945 hit “Strange Things Happening Every Day” has been called the first rock ‘n’ roll record. She had a stroke in 1970, and then another led to her death on October 9, 1973, at the age of 58 in Philadelphia. Tharpe was inducted posthumously into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017.\n\nAlso, Today In:\n\n1961 - Elvis Presley started a two-week run at No. 1 on the U.S. singles chart with \"Surrender,\" his fifth No. 1 of the 1960s. The song was based on a 1911 Italian song, \"Return To Sorrento.\"\n\n1964 - The Temptations released their debut album Meet the Temptations on the Gordy (Motown) label.\n\n1965 - The first Motown tour of the U.K. began, and it featured Martha & the Vandellas, Stevie Wonder, the Supremes and the Temptations.\n\n1969 -John Lennon and Yoko Ono were married in a 10-minute ceremony in Gibraltar, a British Overseas Territory on Spain's south coast. The duo wanted to get married in France, at first, but were unsuccessful. These events were documented in The Beatles song \"The Ballad of John and Yoko,\" where he wrote: \"Finally made the plane into Paris / Honeymooning down by the Seine / Peter Brown called to say / You can make it OK / You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain.\" They spent their honeymoon in Amsterdam campaigning for an international \"Bed-In\" for peace.\n\n1971, Janis Joplin started a posthumous two-week run at No. 1 on the U.S. singles chart with her cover of Kris Kristofferson's \"Me And Bobby McGee\". Joplin died the year before the song charted, on Oct. 4, 1970, at age 27.\n\n1977 - Lou Reed was banned from appearing The London Palladium because of his punk image.\n\n1977 - T Rex played their final gig ever, when they appeared at The Locarno in Portsmouth, England.\n\n1980 - At Asylum Records in New York, 28-year-old Joseph Riviera held employees at gunpoint, demanding to talk to either Jackson Browne or one of the Eagles. When informed that they lived in California, Riviera pocketed his pistol and left the building, later surrendering to police.\n\n1982 - Joan Jett & the Blackhearts started a seven-week run at No. 1 on the U.S. singles chart with \"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\". The song was a cover of a B-side by '60s band The Arrows. In 1993, Joan Jett & the Blackhearts made another music video for the song as part of the Wayne's World 2 soundtrack.\n\n1982 - The duo Buckner & Garcia appear on American Bandstand to perform their hit single \"Pac-Man Fever,\" the first successful song about a video game.\n\n1990 - Near Scranton and heading for a show in Syracuse, Miami Sound Machine's tour bus was hit by a tractor trailer on a snowy highway. Gloria Estefan suffered a serious spinal injury requiring four hours of surgery.\n\n1991 - Eric Clapton's 4-year-old son Conor died after falling out of a window at his mother's apartment. Clapton later wrote \"Tears In Heaven\" about Conor.\n\n1993 - Reggae rules as \"Oh Carolina\" by Shaggy hits #1 in the UK while Snow's \"Informer\" holds the top spot in America. It's the first #1 for both artists - Snow is Canadian; Shaggy is Jamaican-American.\n\n2009 - The quirky garden store Fountains Of Wayne, which provided the moniker for the band of that name, closes shop after more than 40 years in business. The Wayne, New Jersey, landmark was a Christmas hotspot, as giant Santa’s and holiday displays appeared every season. It was also the backdrop for some scenes from the HBO series The Sopranos.\n\n2010 - Three days after their lead singer Alex Chilton died, Big Star play the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas, with several guests joining to pay tribute to Chilton.\n\n2015 - The series finale of Glee, titled \"Dreams Come True,\" airs on FOX.
