        "text": "A LANDMARK former ballroom in Liverpool which hosted the wedding reception of John and Cynthia Lennon is to be brought back to life as a hotel.\n\nA LANDMARK former ballroom in Liverpool which hosted the wedding reception of John and Cynthia Lennon is to be brought back to life as a hotel.\n\nThe Reeces Ballroom, in Parker Street in the city centre, is to be refurbished over four floors as budget accommodation with 127 beds.\n\n‌\n\nThe building is described as an “impressive neo-classical structure” and sits close to the Tesco store in Clayton square.\n\nIt is the second application for a budget hotel in the city centre in recent months. The former Wade Smith store in Button Street is also in line to become a “five-star hostel”, as the developments are being dubbed.\n\nThe council is set to approve the Parker Street bid, brought forward by company TP Hotel (Liverpool) Ltd. Planners said it was important to continue to try to meet the demand for city centre accommodation as hotel occupancy rates continue to rise.\n\n‌\n\nLiverpool Echo Icon\n\nSign up to FREE email alerts from ECHO Daily News\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you’ve consented to and improve our understanding of you.

More info\n\nA report to go before planners tomorrow states: “This 1930s Portland stone building has an impressive, neo-classical appearance and forms a continuation of Church Street to the south, which is characterised by a series of other Portland stone buildings, primarily in retail use.”\n\nThe ballroom is considered to be a key element of the city’s Beatles history, having played host of the wedding in 1962 of John Lennon and first wife Cynthia.\n\n‌\n\nAs it was not a licensed premises, guests at the wedding breakfast had to toast the couple with water – considered a bad luck omen.\n\nThe couple were divorced in 1968 after a tempestuous relationship which saw Lennon leave Cynthia for Yoko Ono.\n\nDespite being a well-used dance and music venue, hosting regular rhythm and blues nights in the 1960s, the ballroom was closed in the 1980s and the upper floors divided into shop units.\n\n‌\n\nThe building will have a four-storey “lightwell” punched through the middle in order to give light to rooms which will not have windows, and will have solar thermal extractors on the roof which will be used towards the heating of the development.\n\nPrevious applications for the building included a plan to create 35 apartments in the upper floors, but the permission has now expired.\n\nCity centre ward Cllr Nick Small said he was pleased the building would be brought back to use and that it showed the city’s tourism sector was on the up.\n\n‌\n\nHe added: “I think it’s great news, and I hope some of the Beatles history can be factored into it.\n\n“This is another example of how the city is on the up, and with this development as well as some of the high-end hotels in the pipeline, we can demonstrate that there’s something for everyone in Liverpool.”"
