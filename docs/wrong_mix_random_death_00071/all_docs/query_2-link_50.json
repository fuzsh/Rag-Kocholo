        "text": "Rock News\n\nRock News\n\nHome\n\nAbout\n\nGALLERY: John Lennon and Yoko Ono Through the Years\n\nJohn Lennon and Yoko Ono were married on March 20, 1969.\n\nThe couple’s nuptials famously took place in Gibraltar. They followed them up with their infamous “Bed-In For Peace” honeymoon. The “Bed-In” honeymoon was in the Presidential Suite of Amsterdam’s Hilton Hotel and lasted a week. Both events were immortalized in The Beatles track “The Ballad of John and Yoko.”\n\nDespite his murder in 1980, the marriage of Lennon and Ono remains one of rock’s most timeless couples and love stories. Few couples had their bond, and fewer have had it since. In honor of their wedding anniversary, scroll through the gallery below of classic images of Lennon and Ono through the years, including photos from their wedding and honeymoon.\n\nSign me up for the MMR VIP email newsletter!\n\nGet the good stuff sent straight to your inbox, and be the first to know: concert presales, exclusive contests, and behind the scenes photos and video.\n\nFirst Name *\n\nLast Name\n\nEmail *\n\nBy clicking \"Subscribe\" I agree to the website's terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
