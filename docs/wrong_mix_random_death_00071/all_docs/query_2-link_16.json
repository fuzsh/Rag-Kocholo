        "text": "The wedding was booked for late in the morning at the Mount Pleasant register office and Brian, who proved himself a true friend and far more than just John’s manager, arranged to pick me up from my bedsit and drive me there.\n\nThat morning I got ready on my own. I’d have loved Phyl to be with me, but she was away on holiday. I couldn’t afford a new outfit so I wore my best purple and black checked two-piece suit with a frilly high-necked white blouse that Astrid had given me. I put my hair up in a French pleat, added black shoes, a black bag, a touch of pink lipstick, and I was ready.\n\nBrian arrived, dapper in a pin-striped suit, and escorted me to his chauffeur-driven car. He looked so smart and the glamorous car made me feel special. He was kind to me on the journey, soothing my nerves and telling me I looked lovely.\n\nThe weather was awful. It might have been August but the sky was overcast and grey, and it looked as though it would rain at any moment. I prayed it wouldn’t – at least until I’d got into the register office because I didn’t have an umbrella. When we arrived, John, Paul and George were pacing about in the waiting room. They were all alarmingly formal in black suits, white shirts and white ties – the only smart outfits they had. George and Paul had made a big effort to look the part and clearly felt it was their role to support John, who was sitting between them, white-faced. I was touched by the effort they’d made, although their clothes would have been more in keeping with a funeral and so would their expressions: all three were horribly nervous.\n\nWhen I came in John leapt to his feet to hug and kiss me and tell me I looked beautiful. Someone made a crack about the boys’ suits, which broke the ice – we all started to giggle. My brother Tony and his wife Marjorie arrived next, hurrying in at the last minute because they’d had to come in their lunch hour. Tony was there to represent our family and he played the big brother to perfection, putting an arm around me protectively. I know John would have loved someone to be there from his family, but Mimi had put paid to that.\n\nMoments later we were ushered into the register office, where the registrar, a dour, solemn man, was waiting for us. As John and I stood in front of him, preparing for our vows, the whole thing took a ludicrously comical turn. A workman in the backyard of the building opposite started up a pneumatic drill and we stared at each other in disbelief. The noise was ear-splitting. Clearly the man wasn’t going to stop so we had no choice but to carry on.\n\nThere was another comic moment when the registrar asked the groom to step forward and George did so. But the registrar saw nothing funny in either the drilling or George’s joke, so we all struggled to keep our faces straight. John and I leant forward, straining to hear the registrar and shouting our responses. Paul, Tony and Marjorie signed the register as our witnesses, and a couple of minutes later we were outside the room. We all burst out laughing, overwhelmed by relief that it was over.\n\nTony and Marjorie hugged us, then went back to work. The rest of us looked at each other. What next? Brian suggested we go to nearby Reece’s cafe for lunch.\n\nOutside, the rain was bucketing down. We ran along the street, laughing at the madness of it all, and burst into Reece’s, where we had to queue for the set lunch of soup, chicken and trifle. Reece’s had no licence so, when we finally got a table, we toasted ourselves with water. But we didn’t care: we were on a high. A full church wedding with all the extras couldn’t have made me happier. And despite the anxiety I knew he had felt, John wore a look of pride and pleasure that touched me. It was as though something had changed in him: he was a married man now, soon to be a father, and he liked it."
