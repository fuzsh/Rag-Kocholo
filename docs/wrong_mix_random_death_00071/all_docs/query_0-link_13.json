        "text": "Yoko Ono was one of the most important personalities of the 20th century, John Lennon's partner and 'destroyer' of The Beatles. Now, more than 40 years later, May Pang has decided to tell of her relationship with the couple, since Ono was the one who asked her to be her husband's mistress, as May was his personal assistant.\n\nThis story is told by May Pang herself, a fling that lasted 18 months and is narrated in the documentary 'The lost weekend: a love Story'. It happened when Pang was 22 years old, in 1973. \"He needs someone nice, like you,\" she explains that Yoko Ono told her. The couple's relationship was going through a rough patch after four years of marriage.\n\n\"I turned him down. I respected his marriage. That's not what I wanted, I was very happy with my work,\" she stressed, although it eventually happened, an affair that stretched between 1973 and 1975, dubbed by Lennon himself as \"the lost weekend.\"\n\n\"Yoko Ono took advantage of me because I was naive.\"\n\n\"It's almost surreal. In one sense, Yoko Ono took advantage of me because I was naive. In the other, she gave me a gift. John and I fell in love,\" she said.\n\n\"She said: 'I think you would be good for him'. She wanted me to be his girlfriend so she could control the relationship.\""
