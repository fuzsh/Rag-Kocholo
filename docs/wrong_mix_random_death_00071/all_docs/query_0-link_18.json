        "text": "Singer, songwriter and peace activist John Lennon, one of The Beatles, was born in England on Oct. 9, 1940.\n\nAccording to biography.com, Lennon was raised by an aunt but saw his mother regularly. She taught him to play musical instruments and bought him his first guitar.\n\nAccording to biography.com, Lennon was 16 when he created a “skiffle band called the Quarry Men.”\n\nLennon met Paul McCartney in 1957 and invited him to join his band.\n\nThey eventually formed a successful music writing partnership that evolved into the British phenomena, The Beatles.\n\nA year after meeting McCartney, McCartney introduced Lennon to George Harrison. The band also added a college friend, Stuart Sutcliffe and then drummer Pete Best.\n\n“The first recording they made was Buddy Holly’s ‘That’ll Be the Day’ in 1958. In fact, it was Holly’s group, the Crickets, that inspired the band to change its name. Lennon would later joke that he had a vision when he was 12 years old — a man appeared on a flaming pie and said unto them, ‘From this day on, you are Beatles with an ‘A.’”\n\nBrian Epstein discovered the Beatles in 1961 and secured them a contract. Ringo Starr came on board as the drummer. The group released its first single in October 1962 – “Love Me Do.”\n\n“Please Please Me,” which topped the charts in Britain, followed along with “She Loves You” and “I Want to Hold Your Hand.”\n\nIn 1962 Lennon married Cynthia Powell and they had a son, Julian. They divorced in 1968 and in 1969 Lennon married Yoko Ono, a Japanese avant-garde artist.\n\nIn 1964 the Beatles brought their act to the United States appearing on “The Ed Sullivan Show.”\n\nAfter the show, the Beatles made the movie “A Hard Day’s Night.” Their second movie, “Help!” was released in 1965, according to biography.com.\n\nLennon left the Beatles in September 1969. McCartney left in April 1970.\n\nIn 1970, Lennon released a solo album, “John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band” followed in 1971 by “Imagine.”\n\nLennon and Ono moved the United States in 1971 “but were constantly threatened with deportation by the Nixon administration. Lennon was told that he was being kicked out of the country due to his 1968 marijuana conviction in Britain, but the singer believed that he was being removed because of his activism against the unpopular Vietnam War. Documents later proved him correct. (Two years after Nixon resigned, in 1976, Lennon was granted permanent U.S. residency),” according to biography.com.\n\nIn 1973, Lennon and Ono separated. Lennon continued to release successful albums including “Mind Games,” “Walls and Bridges” and “Rock ‘n’ Roll.”\n\nHe and Ono reconciled in 1974 and in 1975 they had a son, Sean.\n\nFive years later, on Dec. 8, 1980, Lennon was shot to death outside of the Dakota apartment building in New York City where he lived with his wife.\n\nLennon, 40, was shot in the back four times by Mark David Chapman. Lennon died in the emergency room at Roosevelt Hospital.\n\nOno scattered Lennon's ashes in Central Park where the Strawberry Fields memorial was later created.\n\nChapman pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to 20 years to life in prison. He remains in Wende Correctional Facility in Alden, N.Y., and has been denied parole 10 times, most recently in August 2018."
