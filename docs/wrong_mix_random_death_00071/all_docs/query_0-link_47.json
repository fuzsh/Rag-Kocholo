Dr. Stephen Lynn said, “I am sure he was dead when he was shot.”\n\nPolice said the shooting occurred outside the Dakota, the century-old luxury apartment house where Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono, lived. It is across the street from Central Park.\n\nPolice said they had a suspect and described him as “a screwball” with no apparent motive for shooting Lennon.\n\nLt. John Schick said he expected the man, in his mid-20s, to be held through the night.\n\nLennon’s wife was not hurt.Chief of Detectives James Sullivan said Lennon and his wife were walking into the enclosed courtyard of the Dakota about 10:50 p.m. when five shots rang out. Lennon staggered up a few steps into the building and collapsed, he said.\n\nPolice Officer Anthony Palma, who was one of the first officers to arrive, said officers found Lennon lying face down in the office of the nine-story apartment building and carried him to a patrol car. Miss Ono was taken to the hospital in another car, he said.\n\nPalma said she became hysterical when doctors told her that Lennon was dead. “Tell me it isn’t true,” he quoted her as crying.\n\nSullivan said the suspect was a 25-year-old man from Hawaii who had reportedly been hanging around the Dakota for some time.\n\nJack Douglas, Lennon’s producer, said he and the Lennons had been at a midtown studio called the Record Plant and that Lennon left at 10:30 p.m. Lennon said he was going to get something to eat and go home, Douglas said.\n\nA bystander, Sean Strub, said he was walking south near 72nd Street when he heard four shots. He said he came around the corner to Central Park West and saw Lennon being put into the back of a police car.\n\nSome people say they heard six shots and said John was hit twice,” Strub said. “Police said he was hit in the back.”\n\nHe said others told him the assailant had been “crouching in the archway of the Dakota. … Lennon arrived in the company of his wife and the assailant fired.”\n\nAt Roosevelt Hospital, Dr. Lynn announced that Lennon was dead shortly after midnight. He said Lennon had been brought in shortly before 11 p.m.\n\n“Extensive resuscitation efforts were made and despite transfusions and other methods he could not be revived,” he said.\n\n“Significant damage was done to the major vessel in the chest,” Dr. Lynn said. “There was massive blood loss and he could not be saved. … I am sure he was dead when he was shot. … His house is less than a mile away from the hospital and I don’t think it was possible to rescue him by any means.”\n\nLennon rocketed to fame in the early 1960s when he and fellow Britons Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr introduced a sound that changed the course of rock ‘n’ roll.\n\nLennon, who turned 40 on Oct. 9, was responsible for writing many of the group’s songs.\n\nIn an interview earlier this year- his first major interview in five years – Lennon said he had wanted to leave the Beatles as early as 1966 but did not make the move until four years later because he “just didn’t have the guts.”\n\nAfter the Beatles broke up in 1970, Lennon continued writing songs and recording.\n\nBut in 1975 he dropped out for five years, saying he wanted to be with Yoko Ono and their son, Sean. Lennon also had a son, Julian, by his first wife, Cynthia, whom he left in the late 1960s.\n\nIn 1976, he won resident’s status in the United States after a court fight against a deportation order stemming from a British drug conviction.\n\nIt was not until last summer that he returned to music, and his 14-song album, “Double Fantasy,” was released last month. The album, which includes songs by his wife, is based on Lennon’s experiences over the five years, during which he kept house, cooked and cared for their son.\n\nThe seed for the Beatles band dates to 1955 when Lennon met McCartney at a Liverpool, England, church social. They started performing as a duo called the Quarrymen and were joined three years later by Harrison.\n\nStarr did not come into the band until 1962 – a year before the Beatles hit the top of the charts in Britain with “Please Please Me.”\n\n“Beatlemania” did not cross the ocean to the United States until 1964.\n\nOriginally Published: December 8, 2015 at 4:32 a.m."
