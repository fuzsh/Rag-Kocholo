In 1924, he directed the film drama Catherine, in which he also appeared as a major character. Jean Renoir acted as his assistant director on the film.\r\nBetween 1915 and 1916, Dieudonné acted in five films for director Abel Gance, including the 1915 film La Folie du Docteur Tube and the 1916 film Le périscope. In 1925 he was hired back to star in the title role in Gance's epic film, Napoléon. In 1929 Dieudonné wrote a novel that was made into a 1930 musical comedy film titled The Sweetness of Loving, and he wrote the script for the 1936 La Garçonne.\r\nAlbert Dieudonné died in Paris in 1976 at the age of 86.
