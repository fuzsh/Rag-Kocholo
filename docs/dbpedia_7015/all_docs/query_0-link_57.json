        "text": "The Clique (Twenty Øne Piløts fanatic fanbase) is convinced that the nine Bishops of Dema were modelled after the Bourbaki-group.\n\nIt is therefore of no surprise to see a Photoshopped version circulating of this classic picture of some youthful Bourbaki-members (note Jean-Pierre Serre poster-boying for Elon Musk’s site),\n\nreplacing some of them with much older photos of other members. Crucial seems to be that there are just nine of them.\n\nI don’t know whether the Clique hijacked Bourbaki’s Wikipedia page, or whether they were inspired by its content to select those people, but if you look at that Wikipedia page you’ll see in the right hand column:\n\nFounders\n\nHenri Cartan\n\nClaude Chevalley\n\nJean Coulomb\n\nJean Delsarte\n\nJean Dieudonné\n\nCharles Ehresmann\n\nRené de Possel\n\nAndré Weil\n\nReally? Come on.\n\nWe know for a fact that Charles Ehresmann was brought in to replace Jean Leray, and Jean Coulomb to replace Paul Dubreil. Surely, replacements can’t be founders, can they?\n\nWell, unfortunately it is not quite that simple. There’s this silly semantic discussion: from what moment on can you call someone a Bourbaki-member…\n\nThe collective name ‘Nicolas Bourbaki’ was adopted only at the Bourbaki-congress in Besse in July 1935 (see also this post).\n\nBut, before the Besse-meeting there were ten ‘proto-Bourbaki’ meetings, the first one on December 10th, 1934 in Cafe Capoulade. These meetings have been described masterly by Liliane Beaulieu in A Parisian Cafe and Ten Proto-Bourbaki Meetings (1934-35) (btw. if you know a direct link to the pdf, please drop it in the comments).\n\nDuring these early meetings, the group called itself ‘The Committee for the Treatise on Analysis’, and not yet Bourbaki, whence the confusion.\n\nDo we take the Capoulade-1934 meeting as the origin of the Bourbaki group (in which case the founding-members would be Cartan, Chevalley, De Possel, Delsarte, Dieudonne, and Weil), or was the Bourbaki-group founded at the Besse-congress in 1935 (when Cartan, Chevalley, Coulomb, De Possel, Dieudonne, Mandelbrojt, and Weil were present)?\n\nHere’s a summary of which people were present at all meetings from December 1934 until the second Chancay-congress in September 1939, taken from Gatien Ricotier ‘Projets collectifs et personnels autour de Bourbaki dans les années 1930 à 1950′:\n\n07-1935 is the Besse-congress, 09-1936 is the ‘Escorial’-congress (or Chancay 1) and 09-1937 is the second Chancay-congress. The ten dates prior to July 1935 are the proto-Bourbaki meetings.\n\nEven though Delsarte was not present at the Besse-1935 congress, and De Possel moved to Algiers and left Bourbaki in 1941, I assume most people would agree that the six people present at the first Capoulade-meeting (Cartan, Chevalley, De Possel, Delsarte, Dieudonne, and Weil) should certainly be counted among the Bourbaki founding members.\n\nWhat about the others?\n\nWe can safely eliminate Dubreil: he was present at just one proto-Bourbaki meeting and left the group in April 1935.\n\nAlso Leray’s case is straightforward: he was even excluded from the Besse-meeting as he didn’t contribute much to the group, and later he vehemently opposed Bourbaki, as we’ve seen.\n\nCoulomb’s role seems to restrict to securing a venue for the Besse-meeting as he was ‘physicien-adjoint’ at the ‘Observatoire Physique du Globe du Puy-de-Dome’.\n\nBecause of this he could rarely attend the Julia-seminar or Bourbaki-meetings, and his interest in mathematical physics was a bit far from the themes pursued in the seminar or by Bourbaki. It seems he only contributed one small text, in the form of a letter. Due to his limited attendance, even after officially been asked to replace Dubreil, he can hardly be counted as a founding member.\n\nThis leaves Szolem Mandelbrojt and Charles Ehresmann.\n\nWe’ve already described Mandelbrojt as the odd-man-out among the early Bourbakis. According to the Bourbaki archive he only contributed one text. On the other hand, he also played a role in organising the Besse-meeting and in providing financial support for Bourbaki. Because he was present already early on (from the second proto-Bourbaki meeting) until the Chancay-1937 meeting, some people will count him among the founding members.\n\nPersonally I wouldn’t call Charles Ehresmann a Bourbaki founding member because he joined too late in the process (March 1936). Still, purists (those who argue that Bourbaki was founded at Besse) will say that at that meeting he was put forward to replace Jean Leray, and later contributed actively to Bourbaki’s meetings and work, and for that reason should be included among the founding members.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nHow many Bourbaki founding members are there? Six (the Capoulade-gang), seven (+Mandelbrojt), eight (+Mandelbrojt and Ehresmann), or do you still think there were nine of them?\n\nIn this series:\n\nBourbaki and TØP : East is up\n\nBourbaki = Bishops or Banditos?\n\nWhere’s Bourbaki’s Dema?\n\nWeil photos used in Dema-lore\n\nDema2Trench, AND REpeat\n\nTØP PhotoShop mysteries\n\n9 Bourbaki founding members, really?\n\nBourbaki and Dema, two remarks\n\nClancy and Nancago\n\nLast time, we’ve seen that the first time ‘schemes’ were introduced was in ‘La Tribu’ (the internal Bourbaki-account of their congresses) of the May-June 1955 congress in Chicago.\n\nHere, we will focus on the events leading up to that event. If you always thought Grothendieck invented the word ‘schemes’, here’s what Colin McLarty wrote:\n\n“A story says that in a Paris café around 1955 Grothendieck asked his friends “what is a scheme?”. At the time only an undefined idea of “schéma” was current in Paris, meaning more or less whatever would improve on Weil’s foundations.” (McLarty in The Rising Sea)\n\nWhat were Weil’s foundations of algebraic geometry?\n\nWell, let’s see how Weil defined an affine variety over a field $k$. First you consider a ‘universal field’ $K$ containing $k$, that is, $K$ is an algebraically closed field of infinite transcendence degree over $k$. A point of $n$-dimensional affine space is an $n$-tuple $x=(x_1,\\dots,x_n) \\in K^n$. For such a point $x$ you consider the field $k(x)$ which is the subfield of $K$ generated by $k$ and the coordinates $x_i$ of $x$.\n\nAlternatively, the field $k(x)$ is the field of fractions of the affine domain $R=k[z_1,\\dots,z_n]/I$ where $I$ is the prime ideal of all polynomials $f \\in k[z_1,\\dots,z_n]$ such that $f(x) = f(x_1,\\dots,x_n)=0$.\n\nAn affine $k$-variety $V$ is associated to a ‘generic point’ $x=(x_1,\\dots,x_n)$, meaning that the field $k(x)$ is a ‘regular extension’ of $k$ (that is, for all field-extensions $k’$ of $k$, the tensor product $k(x) \\otimes_k k’$ does not contain zero-divisors.\n\nThe points of $V$ are the ‘specialisations’ of $x$, that is, all points $y=(y_1,\\dots,y_n)$ such that $f(y_1,\\dots,y_n)=0$ for all $f \\in I$.\n\nPerhaps an example? Let $k = \\mathbb{Q}$ and $K=\\mathbb{C}$ and take $x=(i,\\pi)$ in the affine plane $\\mathbb{C}^2$. What is the corresponding prime ideal $I$ of $\\mathbb{Q}[z_1,z_2]$? Well, $i$ is a solution to $z_1^2+1=0$ whereas $\\pi$ is transcendental over $\\mathbb{Q}$, so $I=(z_1^2+1)$ and $R=\\mathbb{Q}[z_1,z_2]/I= \\mathbb{Q}(i)[z_2]$.\n\nIs $x=(i,\\pi)$ a generic point? Well, suppose it were, then the points of the corresponding affine variety $V$ would be all couples $(\\pm i, \\lambda)$ with $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}$ which is the union of two lines in $\\mathbb{C}^2$. But then $i \\otimes 1 + 1 \\otimes i$ is a zero-divisor in $\\mathbb{Q}(x) \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Q}} \\mathbb{Q}(i)$. So no, it is not a generic point over $\\mathbb{Q}$ and does not define an affine $\\mathbb{Q}$-variety.\n\nIf we would have started with $k=\\mathbb{Q}(i)$, then $x=(i,\\pi)$ is generic and the corresponding affine variety $V$ consists of all points $(i,\\lambda) \\in \\mathbb{C}^2$.\n\nIf this is new to you, consider yourself lucky to be young enough to have learned AG from Fulton’s Algebraic curves, or Hartshorne’s chapter 1 if you were that ambitious.\n\nBy 1955, Serre had written his FAC, and Bourbaki had developed enough commutative algebra to turn His attention to algebraic geometry.\n\nLa Ciotat congress (February 27th – March 6th, 1955)\n\nWith a splendid view on the mediterranean, a small group of Bourbaki members (Henri Cartan (then 51), with two of his former Ph.D. students: Jean-Louis Koszul (then 34), and Jean-Pierre Serre (then 29, and fresh Fields medaillist), Jacques Dixmier (then 31), and Pierre Samuel (then 34), a former student of Zariski’s) discussed a previous ‘Rapport de Geometrie Algebrique'(no. 206) and arrived at some unanimous decisions:\n\n1. Algebraic varieties must be sets of points, which will not change at every moment.\n\n2. One should include ‘abstract’ varieties, obtained by gluing (fibres, etc.).\n\n3. All necessary algebra must have been previously proved.\n\n4. The main application of purely algebraic methods being characteristic p, we will hide nothing of the unpleasant phenomena that occur there.\n\n(Henri Cartan and Jean-Pierre Serre, photo by Paul Halmos)\n\nThe approach the propose is clearly based on Serre’s FAC. The points of an affine variety are the maximal ideals of an affine $k$-algebra, this set is equipped with the Zariski topology such that the local rings form a structure sheaf. Abstract varieties are then constructed by gluing these topological spaces and sheaves.\n\nAt the insistence of the ‘specialistes’ (Serre, and Samuel who had just written his book ‘Méthodes d’algèbre abstraite en géométrie algébrique’) two additional points are adopted, but with some hesitation. The first being a jibe at Weil:\n\n1. …The congress, being a little disgusted by the artificiality of the generic point, does not want $K$ to be always of infinite transcendent degree over $k$. It admits that generic points are convenient in certain circumstances, but refuses to see them put to all the sauces: one could speak of a coordinate ring or of a functionfield without stuffing it by force into $K$.\n\n2. Trying to include the arithmetic case.\n\nThe last point was problematic as all their algebras were supposed to be affine over a field $k$, and they wouldn’t go further than to allow the overfield $K$ to be its algebraic closure. Further, (and this caused a lot of heavy discussions at coming congresses) they allowed their varieties to be reducible.\n\nThe Chicago congress (May 30th – June 2nd 1955)\n\nApart from Samuel, a different group of Bourbakis gathered for the ‘second Caucus des Illinois’ at Eckhart Hall, including three founding members Weil (then 49), Dixmier (then 49) and Chevalley (then 46), and two youngsters, Armand Borel (then 32) and Serge Lang (then 28).\n\nTheir reaction to the La Ciotat meeting (the ‘congress of the public bench’) was swift:\n\n(page 1) : “The caucus discovered a public bench near Eckhart Hall, but didn’t do much with it.”\n\n(page 2) : “The caucus did not judge La Ciotat’s plan beyond reproach, and proposed a completely different plan.”\n\nThey wanted to include the arithmetic case by defining as affine scheme the set of all prime ideals (or rather, the localisations at these prime ideals) of a finitely generated domain over a Dedekind domain. They continue:\n\n(page 4) : “The notion of a scheme covers the arithmetic case, and is extracted from the illustrious works of Nagata, themselves inspired by the scholarly cogitations of Chevalley. This means that the latter managed to sell all his ideas to the caucus. The Pope of Chicago, very happy to be able to reject very far projective varieties and Chow coordinates, willingly rallied to the suggestions of his illustrious colleague. However, we have not attempted to define varieties in the arithmetic case. Weil’s principle is that it is unclear what will come out of Nagata’s tricks, and that the only stable thing in arithmetic theory is reduction modulo $p$ a la Shimura.”\n\n“Contrary to the decisions of La Ciotat, we do not want to glue reducible stuff, nor call them varieties. … We even decide to limit ourselves to absolutely irreducible varieties, which alone will have the right to the name of varieties.”\n\nThe insistence on absolutely irreducibility is understandable from Weil’s perspective as only they will have a generic point. But why does he go along with Chevalley’s proposal of an affine scheme?\n\nIn Weil’s approach, a point of the affine variety $V$ determined by a generic point $x=(x_1,\\dots,x_n)$ determines a prime ideal $Q$ of the domain $R=k[x_1,\\dots,x_n]$, so Chevalley’s proposal to consider all prime ideals (rather than only the maximal ideals of an affine algebra) seems right to Weil.\n\nHowever in Weil’s approach there are usually several points corresponding to the same prime ideal $Q$ of $R$, namely all possible embeddings of the ring $R/Q$ in that huge field $K$, so whenever $R/Q$ is not algebraic over $k$, there are infinitely Weil-points of $V$ corresponding to $Q$ (whence the La Ciotat criticism that points of a variety were not supposed to change at every moment).\n\nAccording to Ralf Krömer in his book Tool and Object – a history and philosophy of category theory this shift from Weil-points to prime ideals of $R$ may explain Chevalley’s use of the word ‘scheme’:\n\n(page 164) : “The ‘scheme of the variety’ denotes ‘what is invariant in a variety’.”\n\nAnother time we will see how internal discussion influenced the further Bourbaki congresses until Grothendieck came up with his ‘hyperplan’.\n\nWikipedia claims:\n\n“The word scheme was first used in the 1956 Chevalley Seminar, in which Chevalley was pursuing Zariski’s ideas.”\n\nand refers to the lecture by Chevalley ‘Les schemas’, given on December 12th, 1955 at the ENS-based ‘Seminaire Henri Cartan’ (in fact, that year it was called the Cartan-Chevalley seminar, and the next year Chevalley set up his own seminar at the ENS).\n\nItems recently added to the online Bourbaki Archive give us new information on time and place of the birth of the concept of schemes.\n\nFrom May 30th till June 2nd 1955 the ‘second caucus des Illinois’ Bourbaki-congress was held in ‘le grand salon d’Eckhart Hall’ at the University of Chicago (Weil’s place at that time).\n\nOnly six of the Bourbaki members were present:\n\nJean Dieudonne (then 49), the scribe of the Bourbaki-gang.\n\nAndre Weil (then 49), called ‘Le Pape de Chicago’ in La Tribu, and responsible for his ‘Foundations of Algebraic Geometry’.\n\nClaude Chevalley (then 46), who wanted a better, more workable version of algebraic geometry. He was just nominated professor at the Sorbonne, and was prepping for his seminar on algebraic geometry (with Cartan) in the fall.\n\nPierre Samuel (then 34), who studied in France but got his Ph.D. in 1949 from Princeton under the supervision of Oscar Zariski. He was a Bourbaki-guinea pig in 1945, and from 1947 attended most Bourbaki congresses. He just got his book Methodes d’algebre abstraite en geometrie algebrique published.\n\nArmand Borel (then 32), a Swiss mathematician who was in Paris from 1949 and obtained his Ph.D. under Jean Leray before moving on to the IAS in 1957. He was present at 9 of the Bourbaki congresses between 1955 and 1960.\n\nSerge Lang (then 28), a French-American mathematician who got his Ph.D. in 1951 from Princeton under Emil Artin. In 1955, he just got a position at the University of Chicago, which he held until 1971. He attended 7 Bourbaki congresses between 1955 and 1960.\n\nThe issue of La Tribu of the Eckhart-Hall congress is entirely devoted to algebraic geometry, and starts off with a bang:\n\n“The Caucus did not judge the plan of La Ciotat above all reproaches, and proposed a completely different plan.\n\nI – Schemes\n\nII – Theory of multiplicities for schemes\n\nIII – Varieties\n\nIV – Calculation of cycles\n\nV – Divisors\n\nVI – Projective geometry\n\netc.”\n\nIn the spring of that year (February 27th – March 6th, 1955) a Bourbaki congress was held ‘Chez Patrice’ at La Ciotat, hosting a different group of Bourbaki members (Samuel was the singleton intersection) : Henri Cartan (then 51), Jacques Dixmier (then 31), Jean-Louis Koszul (then 34), and Jean-Pierre Serre (then 29, and fresh Fields medaillist).\n\nIn the La Ciotat-Tribu,nr. 35 there are also a great number of pages (page 14 – 25) used to explain a general plan to deal with algebraic geometry. Their summary (page 3-4):\n\n“Algebraic Geometry : She has a very nice face.\n\nChap I : Algebraic varieties\n\nChap II : The rest of Chap. I\n\nChap III : Divisors\n\nChap IV : Intersections”\n\nThere’s much more to say comparing these two plans, but that’ll be for another day.\n\nWe’ve just read the word ‘schemes’ for the first (?) time. That unnumbered La Tribu continues on page 3 with “where one explains what a scheme is”:\n\nSo, what was their first idea of a scheme?\n\nWell, you had your favourite Dedekind domain $D$, and you considered all rings of finite type over $D$. Sorry, not all rings, just all domains because such a ring $R$ had to have a field of fractions $K$ which was of finite type over $k$ the field of fractions of your Dedekind domain $D$.\n\nThey say that Dedekind domains are the algebraic geometrical equivalent of fields. Yeah well, as they only consider $D$-rings the geometric object associated to $D$ is the terminal object, much like a point if $D$ is an algebraically closed field.\n\nBut then, what is this geometric object associated to a domain $R$?\n\nIn this stage, still under the influence of Weil’s focus on valuations and their specialisations, they (Chevalley?) take as the geometric object $\\mathbf{Spec}(R)$, the set of all ‘spots’ (taches), that is, local rings in $K$ which are the localisations of $R$ at prime ideals. So, instead of taking the set of all prime ideals, they prefer to take the set of all stalks of the (coming) structure sheaf.\n\nBut then, speaking about sheaves is rather futile as there is no trace of any topology on this set, then. Also, they make a big fuss about not wanting to define a general schema by gluing together these ‘affine’ schemes, but then they introduce a notion of ‘apparentement’ of spots which basically means the same thing.\n\nIt is still very early days, and there’s a lot more to say on this, but if no further documents come to light, I’d say that the birthplace of ‘schemes’, that is , the place where the first time there was a documented consensus on the notion, is Eckhart Hall in Chicago."
