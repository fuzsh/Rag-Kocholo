Add your little prince to the group!\n\nUnique French Boy Names\n\nIf youâre looking for French boysâ names with a unique sound and/or meaning, including some famous middle names for boys, choose one of these options:\n\n16. AdÃ©lard. Youâre more likely to see this boyâs name used in Canada, specifically in the French-Canadian province of Quebec. It originated as a German name and means ânobleâ and âbrave,â both strong meanings for a boy.\n\n17. AldÃ©ric.

The French form of the Greek boyâs name Arsenios, which means âvirile,â has a unique sound when pronounced AR-SEHN.\n\n23. BÃ©renger. Pronounced BEH-RAHN-ZHEH, this elegant-sounding French boyâs name is based on an ancient German one. It roughly translates to mean âbearâ and âspear.â The French name was used by royalty but itâs still very rare, making it a unique choice for your baby boy.\n\n24. CÃ´me. This French name was derived from the Latin and Greek boysâ names Cosmas and Kosmas. It means âorderâ or âdecency.â Pronounced simply KOM, the name shot up in popularity in 2019.\n\n25. DieudonnÃ©. This unique French boyâs name means âgiven by God,â and is pronounced DYUU-DAW-NEH. The name is based on the Roman name Deusdedit, which was the name of two popes. As DieudonnÃ©, the boyâs name is very popular in French-speaking African countries.\n\n26. Ãmeric. Based on the German name Emmerich, in French the boyâs name is pronounced EHM-REEK (with just two syllables instead of three). It means âwhole ruler.â The English name Henry may also be related.\n\n27. Gaultier. This is the rarer spelling of the names Gauthier or Gautier, both of which mean Walter in French. The boyâs name is of German origin and means âruler of the army.â Quite the moniker for your little general!\n\n28. Gervais. This beautiful-sounding French boyâs name has roots in the Latinized ancient German name of Gervasius, which was also the name of a saint. You may also recognize it as the last name of the English actor and comedian Ricky Gervais.\n\n29. HonorÃ©. The French boyâs name comes from the name Honoratus or Honorius, and its meaning is (as you might guess) âhonor.â It was the given name of French writer HonorÃ© de Balzac. You could honor your little boy with this distinguished-sounding French name.\n\n30. Maxime. With roots in the Latin name Maximus, this French name means âgreatest.â Why not choose this name for your greatest achievement? And, hereâs a chance to use the nickname Max. The boyâs name is highly ranked in the French-Canadian province of Quebec.\n\n31. RÃ©gis. In the Old French Occitan language, this boyâs name means âruler.â You may also recognize this name from the late and popular TV presenter and host Regis Philbin.\n\n32. SÃ©vÃ¨re. Harry Potter fans, you may recognize this boyâs name, as itâs the French equivalent of the Latin name Severus. The name means âsternâ and was originally a Roman last name before it was used as a given name. Several saints also bore the name.\n\n33. Zacharie. This playful French boyâs name comes from the biblical name Zechariah, which means âYahweh remembers.â The name appears in both the Old and New Testaments. Feel free to give your son the nickname Zach or Zac!\n\nCute French Boy Names\n\nMany French boysâ names seem inherently cute in the way they are pronounced or in their meanings. Weâve included some of the top ones in this category:\n\n34. Adrien. Even though pronouncing this name in French as A-DREE-YEHN may sound like itâs feminine, the name is actually a boyâs name. (In French the feminine form is spelled Adrienne; however, both have the same pronunciation.) The name is derived from the Roman name Hadrian, which was also the name of a Roman emperor. The name of the Adriatic Sea was also derived from this name.\n\n35. AimÃ©. Like the name above, this is also the masculine form of a female name, in this case AimÃ©e.
