        "text": "Léon Motchane was convinced, firstly that fundamental research should be supported by large industrial companies, secondly that researchers should have thorough freedom of choice. He, therefore, decided to set up an institute in France, similar to the Institute to Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton, to bring together high-level mathematicians et physicists\n\nWith Robert Oppenheimer’s support, then Director of the IAS, as well as that of large private companies, Léon Motchane created the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques in 1958, which moved to Bois-Marie in 1962.\n\nThe Institute’s reputation gradually became international thanks to the various scientific personalities who came to visit, but also thanks to the Publications mathématiques de l’IHES or the famous « Séminaire de géométrie algébrique » by Grothendieck, which were at the core of the reorganization of algebraic geometry in the 60s.\n\nUpon Léon Motchane’s retirement in 1971, Nicolaas H. Kuiper took over as Director.\n\nLaurent Lafforgue worked mainly on the “Langlands program”, a set of very deep conjectures which, in an arithmetic framework, link harmonic analysis, Galois theory, and algebraic geometry. He demonstrated one of these conjectures: the Langlands correspondence on function bodies.\n\nIn recent years, he has returned to Grothendieck’s pioneering work by deepening his understanding of one of the theories that Grothendieck had created and that he considered particularly important: the theory of topos, through his exchanges with Olivia Caramello. Laurent Lafforgue supports the development around Olivia Caramello of a new school of topos that exploits and deepens the technique of “topos as bridges” that she introduced based on the duality of sites and topos. He was holder of the Algebraic Geometry Huawei Chair from 2019 to 2021.\n\nPersonal web page\n\nAt IHES, Oscar E. Lanford III focused on work in dynamical systems theory, including the application of ideas from renormalization group theory to dynamical systems. He was also interested in demonstrations assisted by computer and was in charge of the first computer facilities at IHES.\n\nOscar E. Lanford III always kept close ties with the Institute. He even acted as interim Director for the Institute from 2007 to 2011, during the research trips abroad of the former Director, Jean-Pierre Bourguignon.\n\nOscar E. Lanford III passed away on November 16, 2013. He had wished to donate an apartment to the Institute: “a way of giving something back in return for the many opportunities that had been offered to him over the years,” explained his wife and daughter.\n\nIHES wanted to honor Oscar by naming the Director’s science office after him, in perpetuity.\n\nBorn on May 4, 1923, in Roanne (Loire, France) and a graduate engineer from the École Polytechnique, Professor Louis Michel obtained his thesis on the theory of weak interaction at the University of Manchester in 1953. He started teaching in Lille, then in Orsay, and in 1958 he created the Centre de Physique Théorique at the École Polytechnique.\n\nOnly four years after the creation of IHES by Léon Motchane, he joined the Institute in 1962 and became the first permanent professor in theoretical physics at IHES. Then, he oriented his work towards crystallography. Major world figure in the theory of elementary particles, he had many international students.\n\nLouis Michel was also president of the Société Française de Physique from 1978 to 1980 and was doctor honoris causa of the universities of Louvain and Barcelona. In 1984, he received the Wigner Medal, administered by The Group Theory and Fundamental Physics Foundation, which recognizes outstanding contributions to the understanding of physics through group theory.\n\nOn December 30, 1999, Louis Michel passed away. With 30 years at IHES, he marked the history of the Institute. In order to honor his memory, IHES created the Louis Michel Chair for distinguished long-term visitors.\n\nJean Dieudonné was notably a founding member of Bourbaki and the writer of the group. He was also a PhD advisor of Grothendieck at the University of Nancy and later convinced Léon Motchane to hire his brilliant student alongside him. They thus became the first two IHES professors.\n\nBetween 1959 and 1979 Dieudonné was the editor-in-chief of the Publications Mathématiques de l’IHES, which rapidly ranked among the best mathematics journals in the world. He devoted most of his time to properly write the famous Éléments de Géométrie Algébrique (“Elements of Algebraic Geometry”) in order to let Grothendieck focus on his seminars.\n\nJean Dieudonné left Bures for the new University of Nice in 1964 to found its department of mathematics. Between 1969 and 1982, he published there his Éléments d’analyse (Treatise on Analysis) in nine volumes; it is an imposing textbook containing many substantial exercises for students – and still in use today."
