        "text": "There’s this band Twenty One Pilots and they’ve woven a complicated story around some of their albums, notably Blurryface, Trench, and Scaled and Icy.\n\nSince Trench, an important component of that story is the Bourbaki group, so I’m just curious whether the few things I know about them can help to clarify parts in the TØP- storyline.\n\nPretty pointless, I know, as no artistic project will follow blindly historical facts. But hey, as long as I discover new things I’ll keep going.\n\nThe story’s about a City of Dema, ruled by nine Bishops installing a terror regime called Vialism, and a land outside the city walls, called Trench, to which citizens would like to escape.\n\nThink of Dema as an extremely toxic environment from which you need to escape to a safe place, let’s call it Trench.\n\nSadly, too often survivors from abusive settings later on create their own toxic environment, abusive to others.\n\nSo, Dema-escapees to Trench should always be wary of the danger of creating a new Dema for others.\n\nIt is very hard to break these Dema2Trench cycles of violence. That’s probably why the map of the City of Dema is circular.\n\nLet’s start with these two photos not (yet) in the Dema-lore:\n\nBoth pictures are of the French mathematician Gaston Julia.\n\nJulia graduated from the ENS in 1914, so was among the worst victims of the military regime Lavisse installed at the ENS. He was mobilised but hadn’t yet completed his second year of military training. That was shortened to just 5 months, after which we has send as a second lieutenant to the war.\n\nIn January 1915 he was seriously wounded in his face, had to undergo a series of operations and for the rest of his life he resigned himself to wearing a leather strap around the area where his nose had been.\n\nHe ran a weekly seminar from 1933 till 1939, the Seminaire Julia, to which the Bourbaki core members contributed a vast number of lectures.\n\nUntil 1937-38 (so just before the Dieulefit Bourbaki congress) the Bourbakis felt happy citizens of Julia’s Seminar/Dema. But then they discovered his political agenda and were expelled from it, or escaped from it depending on the version.\n\nJean Leray convinced Julia that it was a terrible mistake to let his seminar run by Bourbaki, and that things would go much better if he ran it. Julia expelled Bourbaki from the seminar, changed its name to ‘ Cercle mathématique de l’École normale supérieure’ and moved the venue from the IHP to the ENS. The attendants of this seminar were younger and less international that in the preceding years, hence more malleable to his political ideas.\n\nAnother reason for the break-up between Bourbaki and Julia was that they reproached him of attending in June 1937 the festivities of the bicentennial of the University of Gottingen, which were seen as pure propaganda for the Nazi-regime.\n\nDuring WW2, Julia collaborated with the occupying Nazi-regime in that he tried to find French mathematicians to contribute to the Zentralblatt. After the war he was briefly suspended for this.\n\nMuch more on the Julia seminar and the break-up with Bourbaki can be read in the thesis by Gatien Ricotier ‘Projets collectifs et personnels autour de Bourbaki dans les années 1930 à 1950’, and Michele Audin’s book on the Julia Seminar.\n\nLet us compare Julia’s photographs to these two in Dema-lore:\n\nIs it a coincidence that Clancy in Trench has a scar on his nose? Is it a coincidence that the black paint on some of the Bishop’s faces looks a lot like Julia’s mask?\n\nCan it be that victims of one Dema-era become Bishops in a next era?\n\nThis repetitiveness of Dema-environments also indicates the importance of Bishop Andre. Recall that all the Bishops’ names (except for Nico) come from concatenations of word-parts in the lyrics of the songs on the Blurryface album.\n\nANDRE comes from ‘..AND REpeat’ in Fairly local:\n\nTomorrow I’ll keep a beat\n\nAnd repeat yesterday’s dance\n\nIn view of this, let’s have another look at the two Bourbaki-related photographs that appeared in the run up to the Trench-album:\n\nOn the left is the photo of the Dieulefit/Beauvallon 1938 meeting, which is on the Bourbaki Wikipedia page, and was on the desktop of Tyler Joseph.\n\nOn the right a photo of Andre Weil together with a girl, according to Wikipedia the picture dates from 1956. I’m pretty certain it was taken in the summer of 1957, and that the girl is Mireille Cartan, the second youngest daughter of Henri Cartan. Not that any of this matters, TØP-wise. A clipping of the girl was among the material originally posted at the dmaorg.info site.\n\nIn 1938, Andre Weil was a victim of Lavisse’s Dema. His year was the last one getting a military training to become reserve officers in the French infantry/artillery (as were Cartan, Dieudonne and Delsarte).\n\nWhen France would mobilise they were forced to return to Dema (military service) and lead their bataljons as second lieutenants into war. All of them, except for Weil, did this.\n\nWeil escaped to Trench (Finland), and was taken back to Dema, and imprisonment.\n\nIn 1957, Bourbaki dominated much of French mathematical life, and certainly its influence in Paris was suffocating for aspiring math-students. A good read on this is Jacques Roubaud’s Mathematique.\n\nBourbaki has turned French mathematics (and beyond) into its own Dema, and Andre Weil certainly was one of the more important Bishops of it.\n\nIn this series:\n\nBourbaki and TØP : East is up\n\nBourbaki = Bishops or Banditos?\n\nWhere’s Bourbaki’s Dema?\n\nWeil photos used in Dema-lore\n\nDema2Trench, AND REpeat\n\nTØP PhotoShop mysteries\n\n9 Bourbaki founding members, really?\n\nBourbaki and Dema, two remarks\n\nClancy and Nancago\n\nIn this series I’m trying to figure out why the Bourbaki-group was an inspiration for the storyline of Trench, the fifth studio album by American musical duo Twenty One Pilots (or TØP).\n\nTrench-lore centers around the city of Dema, ruled by nine Bishops enforcing Vialism (a fake religion asking people to take their own lives to glorify Dema).\n\nIt is an unfortunate coincidence that the city of Dema in the movie-clip of Nico and the Niners was inspired, and shot in Kyiv and Charkiv, Ukraine (the clip is from 2018).\n\nI’ve just found out that Dema is situated in my country… (NATN was made in Kyiv and Charkiv, Ukraine)\n\nby u/Sasha0503 in twentyonepilots\n\nHere’s the corresponding ‘beyond the movie’-clip, from which we learn (or rather are told) that the movie’s ‘city of Dema’ was shot in ‘the former Ukranian high-school’ of Josh Dun (he even calls it his ‘Alma Mater’), all in quotes because I don’t buy any of it, but take it as a desperate hint to identify Dema.\n\nIn the Trench movie-clips, Josh Dun is always cast as a Bandito, and last time we saw that also the Bourbaki-gang is likely to be close to the Banditos. Dema is supposed to be the Alma Mater of (at least some of) the Banditos. Hold that thought.\n\nAs for the connection between the City of Dema and the Bourbaki-group, we only have one piece of solid information:\n\nThat the Bourbaki-group named themselves after Nico=Nicolas Bourbaki clearly resonates with Twenty Øne Pilots who got their name from the 1947 play ‘All My Sons’ by American playwright Arthur Miller.\n\nBut the crucial info is: “The story of Dema happened before them”, so the story of Dema with the Bishops and Vialism happened before the Bourbaki-group. An extra piece of evidence that there is no way the Bourbaki-group are the nine Bishops of Dema.\n\nSo, what happened before the Bourbaki-group?\n\nMathematically, their direct predecessors were David Hilbert, Emil Artin, Emmy Noether and her boys, in short German mathematicians from the 1920’s and early 1930’s.\n\nSeveral of the Bourbaki founding members studied in Germany (Weil in Gottingen in 1927, Chevalley in Hamburg in 1931 and Marburg in 1932, and Ehresmann in Gottingen in 1930).\n\nThey were inspired by Hilbert’s program (We must know, we will know), and set out to introduce the German style of writing and doing mathematics in France.\n\nSo, a first candidate (also given the Bauhaus-like architecture of Dema) might be ‘German Mathematicians’, or in German, DEutscher MAthematiker = DEMA.\n\nBut one can hardly argue that there was a self-destructive attitude (like Vialism) present among that group, quite the opposite.\n\nStill, one can ask why German mathematics was that strong in the 1920’s, compared to the French. France and Germany took different approaches with their intelligentsia during WW1: while Germany protected its young students and scientists, France instead committed them to the front, owing to the French culture of egalitarianism.\n\nRemember that the album is called Trench, and the dirtiest trench-war in all of human history was WW1. Hold that thought.\n\nBut, how does this help us in identifying Dema.\n\nA few months before the release of Trench, a website was launched containing letters (from a character named Clancy) and some photos (including part of a photo of Andre Weil). That website’s URL still is dmaorg.info.\n\nOn the rear of the boat in the movie-clip Saturday, we see ‘030904 DMA ORG’ (the 030904 is simplistic code for CID, believed to mean ‘Clancy Is Dead’).\n\nCompare this to the official email address of the ‘Association des collaborateurs de Nicolas Bourbaki’ which is: bourbaki@dma.ens.fr.\n\nHere, ‘dma’ stands for ‘Département de mathématiques et applications’, one of the fifteen departments of the ENS, the Ecole Normal Superieure in Paris, Rue d’Ulm.\n\nRemember the inspirational, photoshopped photo of the Bourbaki 1938 congress in Dieulefit/Deauvallon:\n\nAll seven people in the original picture are ‘normaliens’, that is, their ‘Alma Mater’ is the Ecole Normale Superieure’. All but Simone Weil graduated from the DEpartement de MAthematiques=DEMA, as DMA was called then.\n\nWhence the hypothesis: Bourbaki’s Dema = ENS before and during WW1\n\nIt is a conglomerate of buildings and its central courtyard forms a kind of secular cloister around its basin. This space is called “la Cour aux Ernests” in reference to a former director, Ernest Bersot. He had placed red (!) fish (=the Ernests in ENS-slang) in the basin, which have become one of the symbols of the school.\n\nMore important to us is that the pond of the Ernests is reached by crossing the “aquarium”, where the ENS war memorial is located, commemorating the 239 (former) ENS-students killed in WW1 on a tatal of about 1400 of them drafted…\n\nFrom the Wikipedia-page on Nicolas Bourbaki:\n\n“The deaths of ENS students resulted in a lost generation in the French mathematical community; the estimated proportion of ENS mathematics students (and French students generally) who died in the war ranges from one-quarter to one-half, depending on the intervals of time (c. 1900–1918, especially 1910–1916) and populations considered.”\n\nA chilling, and very detailed account of the circumstances that lead to the deaths of about 50% of ENS-student from the period 1910-1913 can be found in the paper Pourquoi les normaliens sont-ils morts en masse en 1914-1918 ? Une explication structurale (Why the normaliens suffered mass-death in 1914-18, a structural explanation) by Nicolas (!) Mariot. Here’s the abstract:\n\n“The École Normale Supérieure d’Ulm is always mentioned when historians summarize the ravages of World War I in France: the institution embodies the commitment of intellectuals at the front. The article offers an interpretation of mortality rates of the School which allows to understand why it is primarily students during schooling (Classes 1910-1913) that are heavily affected. Rather than basing the interpretation on the single assumption of sacrifice, it puts forward arguments pertaining to the history of the school in the immediate pre-war, including the institution of military training after the reform service in 1905, competition with the École Polytechnique to retain the best scientific students, and finally the forced commitment of the ENS students in the infantry.”\n\nCrucial in this is the role of Ernest Lavisse who was the director of the ENS from 1903 till 1919.\n\nBefore, normaliens had to serve 12 months in the army, just like all other students. In 1905 the law changed, and under Lavisse’s influence ENS-students were given a heavy military training. From the paper:\n\n“From now on, normalien students, like those of other major military schools, are subject to a two-year service: a first year before their actual entry into rue d’Ulm, which they had to perform in an infantry regiment; a second on leaving, which they can finish as a reserve second lieutenant, but always in the infantry, if they pass the tests. And there is more: because between these two years, the students also follow a fairly heavy military preparation, including theoretical and physical exercises, even on Sundays, organised by two officers seconded full-time for this mission within the walls of the School.”\n\nHe also instilled in the ENS-student a radical sense of patriotism, and was a fervent propagandist for l’Union sacrée. From the paper:\n\n“Intellectual mobilisation crystallised in the figures of Lavisse and Durkheim via their famous Letters to all French people distributed in millions of copies across the country. In the fall of 1914, the two founded and took control, respectively as director and secretary of the Committee for Studies and Documents on the War, a propaganda organ for the country’s executives.\n\nAlongside them, eight of the nine other members of the Committee are former students of the School who have become professors at the Sorbonne (Charles Andler, Charles Seignobos, Émile Boutroux, Ernest Denis, Gustave Lanson) or at the Collège de France (Joseph Bédier, Henri Bergson, Jacques Hadamard), without even mentioning the role of editorial secretary held by Lucien Herr, legendary counterpart of Paul Dupuy at the Rue d’Ulm library.”\n\nI would have liked that there were only nine members of the committee, but there were eleven of them…\n\nAnyway, Lavisse and his eight professors created an extremely patriotic environment at the ENS during WW1, encouraging students to go to (the) Trench(es) and give their life for France and the glory of the Ecole. The ENS-monument is the equivalent of the Neon Gravestones in Dema-lore.\n\nDid you spot it too? LAVIsse is almost a perfect anagram for VIALism.\n\nSe non e vero…\n\nConcluding, the best theory I can come up with in order to include the Bourbaki-group in Dema-lore is that their Dema is the ENS in WW1 and preceding years, and that Vialism is the regime installed by Lavisse and the other members from the committee.\n\nIn this series:\n\nBourbaki and TØP : East is up\n\nBourbaki = Bishops or Banditos?\n\nWhere’s Bourbaki’s Dema?\n\nWeil photos used in Dema-lore\n\nDema2Trench, AND REpeat\n\nTØP PhotoShop mysteries\n\n9 Bourbaki founding members, really?\n\nBourbaki and Dema, two remarks\n\nClancy and Nancago\n\nIn this series I’m trying to make sense of the inclusion of Nicolas Bourbaki in the storyline of Trench, the fifth studio album by American musical duo Twenty One Pilots (or TØP).\n\nThat story is about the walled city of Dema, ruled by nine bishops dressed in red cloaks. They enforce their religion, called Vialism, on the inhabitants of Dema. The end-goal in Vialism is that you take your own life, having maximal impact (think: suicide bombers).\n\nOutside the walls of Dema is the land of Trench, where a group of fighters (the Banditos) set up camp. They are dressed in grey trenchcoats adorned with yellow ribbons, and their goal is to help people escape from Dema, via its east side.\n\nWhat on earth has the Bourbaki group to do with any of this?\n\nWe know from a tweet by Tyler Joseph that one Bourbaki-photograph (or at least a PhotoShopped version of it) played an important role in the creative process, as he used it as the background image on his Mac while producing the album.\n\nIt can also be seen, blurred in the background, in the opening seconds of his interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music:\n\nHere are the three versions: the original photo, overlayed with the tweet-image, and a screenshot from the interview:\n\nIn the original photo, taken at the 1938 Dieulefit Bourbaki congress, we see seven people, from left to right\n\nSimone Weil (not Bourbaki, sister of Andre Weil)\n\nCharles Pisot (chrysalide, Bourbaki member after WW2)\n\nAndre Weil, partially hidden (Bourbaki founding member)\n\nJean Dieudonne, sitting (Bourbaki founding member)\n\nClaude Chabauty (chrysalide, Bourbaki member during and after WW2)\n\nCharles Ehresmann (Bourbaki founding member)\n\nJean Delsarte (Bourbaki founding member)\n\nIn the overlayed image an additional eight person, a bearded man, is PhotoShopped in the doorway, and in the screenshot we see that apart from this mystery man the empty chair in the lower left corner is replaced by a ninth person.\n\nCommon belief among the ‘clique’ (TØP’s fanbase name) is that the nine people in the desktop image are the nine bishops of Dema, with the bearded man being Nico (the head-bishop), Andre Weil bishop Andre, and Simone Weil bishop Sacarver (the only known female bishop).\n\nBut who are these two additional persons?\n\nIn a remarkable tour de force, Reddit user ‘banditosleepers’ was able to find the man sitting in the lower left corner (though he identified him wrongly)\n\nI found one of the people shopped into Tyler’s desktop (2018)\n\nby u/banditosleepers in twentyonepilots\n\nThere’s this other famous pre-WW2 photo of a Bourbaki congress, this time the 1937 congress in Chancay:\n\nHere we see, from left to right:\n\nAndre Weil\n\nSimone Weil (standing)\n\nHenri Cartan (Bourbaki founding member)\n\nSzolem Mandelbrojt (Bourbaki founding member)\n\nClaude Chevalley (sitting on the bank, Bourbaki founding member)\n\nJean Delsarte (partially hidded)\n\nThat is, the ninth person, sitting in the left lower corner of the screenshot is Szolem Mandelbrojt (and not Claude Chevalley, as claimed in the Reddit-post).\n\nThere’s another photo, taken at about the same moment, showing that also Jean Dieudonne (sitting on the bank in front next to Andre Weil) and Charles Ehresmann (sitting on the bank on the right, next to Jean Delsarte and Claude Chevalley) were present.\n\nSeveral people (myself included) have wasted too many hours trying to identify the bearded man in the doorway, starting from the assumption that he too might have some connection with Bourbaki (either the group or the general), without success.\n\nThere’s one problem with the ‘bearded man = Nico’ hypothesis. Nico is supposed to be the tallest of the bishops, and bearded man’s head is level with Andre Weil’s head, who stand on the first step, so bearded man must at least be 15cm smaller than Andre, who was already rather short.\n\nHere’s a theory.\n\nThe original Dieulefit 1938 photo is the first one on the Wikipedia page for Nicolas Bourbaki, and if you click on it you get a link to one of my own blogposts Bourbaki and the miracle of silence.\n\nIn that post (from 2010) I found the exact location where that photo was taken: the Ecole de Beauvallon, founded in 1929 by Marguerite Soubeyran and Catherine Krafft, which was the first ‘modern’ boarding school in France for both boys and girls having behavioural problems. From 1936 on the school’s director was Simone Monnier.\n\nThe lower picture is taken at the Ecole de Beauvallon in 1943, the woman in the middle is Marguerite Soubeyran.\n\nFrom 1936 on, about 20 refugees from the Spanish civil war found a home at the school, and in the ‘pension’, next to the school. When WW2 started, about 1500 people were hidden from the German occupation in Dieulefit (having a total population of 3500) : Jewish children, intellectuals, artists, trade union leaders, many in the Ecole and the Pension. None were betrayed to the Germans, and this is called Le miracle de silence à Dieulefit.\n\nGiven this historical context, there is only one possible way to include this Bourbaki-photo in the Trench-storyline: the Ecole de Beauvallon is the equivalent of the Bandito-camp, and the Bourbakis are Banditos (or at the very least, refugees having found a safe place in the camp).\n\nIn hindsight this was already given away by Tyler Joseph in that he gave the photo the color yellow, specifically Bandito-yellow 0xFCE300, which the bishops are unable to see (they see it as grey).\n\nHow does this help in identifying the bearded man in the doorway?\n\nStanding in the doorway, he’s the one feeling at home there, gathering around him his guests or fellow fighters. My conjecture is that he is the leader of the bandito-camp, as seen at 2.12 in the movieclip of Levitate.\n\nGranted, it is not a perfect match. I think ‘bearded man’ is how Tyler Joseph envisioned the camp-leader, and included his picture in the ‘Trench Bible’, the 60 page booklet given to the movie-director, who did the casting some months later.\n\nNext time we will try to find City of Dema, or at least what it should be if you take the inclusion of Bourbaki in the Trench storyline seriously.\n\nIn this series:\n\nBourbaki and TØP : East is up\n\nBourbaki = Bishops or Banditos?\n\nWhere’s Bourbaki’s Dema?\n\nWeil photos used in Dema-lore\n\nDema2Trench, AND REpeat\n\nTØP PhotoShop mysteries\n\n9 Bourbaki founding members, really?\n\nBourbaki and Dema, two remarks\n\nClancy and Nancago"
