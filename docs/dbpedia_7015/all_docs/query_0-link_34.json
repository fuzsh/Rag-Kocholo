        "text": "Emmanuel Augustin Dieudonné, better known as Count de Las Cases, (pronounced Las Kaz, and also spelled Las “Casas”) has to be considered the only person to actually profit personally from exile with Napoleon on St. Helena. Las Cases was the very first to publish an account of Napoleon’s treatment on St. Helena. No one has had more attention paid to them in the last two hundred years, except for Napoleon himself. The harsh treatment he suffered upon his return to Europe, especially from agents of the British government, could not remain unnoticed. He was literally sent from St. Helena and Napoleon’s company in chains as a prisoner in spite of his well-documented requests for British justice. In fact, his suffering went so far as to be the subject of discussion and censure in the British House of Commons.\n\nFamily history\n\nEmmanuel Augustin Dieudonné was a direct descendant of the “Las Casas” who was the biographer of Columbus. It was Las Cases’ ancestor who actually copied the diary that Columbus kept on his first ocean crossing to the New World, the only copy in existence as the original was lost. Las Cases was also related to the famous wine chateau, Leoville Las Cases, one of the best French Burgundy wines produced.\n\nAt the close of the 11th century, when French troops entered Spain to combat the Muslim Moors who had come into Spain from North Africa, one of the French standard bearers to Count Henry of Burgundy was an ancestor to Las Cases. (Henry of Burgundy was also the founder of Portugal.) During the many battles in which they were engaged with the Muslims, Las Cases’s ancestor performed so gallantly and courageously that Henry granted him “todas las Casas”, or all of the land previously inhabited by the Muslim Moors within sight of the final battlefield. From then on the coat of arms of the Las Cases family consisted of the colours of the standard, and included the arms, motto, and family name.\n\nIn later centuries the family resided in Seville. In 1200, one of the family members, Charles de Las Cases, escorted Bianca of Castille to France to marry King Louis VIII, the Father of “St. Louis”, Louis IXth of France.\n\nThen we come to the Bishop of Chiapa, Bartholomaeus de Las Casas, who was the defender of the Indians, and who delivered Christian ethics to them in the New World, and the biographer of Columbus.\n\nLas Cases represents the 17th military generation of the family, which began with the reign of Louis VIII in 1223. During the time between the reign of Louis VIII and Napoleon’s exile in 1815, the Las Cases family was intimately involved in the majority of the European conflicts that occurred, being closely tied to the monarchy.\n\nEarly life and travels\n\nLas Cases was born in 1766 in the Las Cases castle in the French area known as the Languedoc near the town of Soreze. Around the age of fifteen he entered the Ecole Militaire in Paris for military training. When he graduated he tried to enter the cavalry, however, he was short in stature and was not strong enough for the rigours of the cavalry, entering the French Navy instead. He was assuredly helped by his uncle, the Duke de Pentievre, who just happened to be the Grand Admiral of France.\n\nLas Cases was barely out of the Ecole Militaire when he found himself at sea in the English Channel. He was on a French warship with a combined fleet from Spain under the command of the Spanish Admiral Don Louis de Cordova, attempting to engage the English fleet under the command of Lord Howe of American Revolution fame. The first actual engagement took place at the siege of Gibraltar in 1782. The weather was terrible and the ship he was on was nearly swamped by the waves. On 20 October, a few weeks later, he was involved in the sea battle off Cadiz in which over one hundred ships took part. This was the final action of that conflict.\n\nLas Cases, to improve his naval knowledge and experience, and thus improve his chances for advancement, travelled to all the American colonies, Senegal, and the West and East Indies. He studied the mathematics of navigation and, when he returned to France, apprenticed himself to Senator Gaspard Monge, the premier mathematician in France at the time, and the inventor of “descriptive geometry”. (There is a main thoroughfare in Paris today named “Rue Monge” in his honour.) His work with Monge resulted in his promotion to Lieutenant of Vaisseau, a naval rank equal to that of an Army Major. He was barely twenty-one years old.\n\nA near miss\n\nLas Cases was appointed to participate in what was to be termed The Expedition of La Perouse, which was a disaster. The expedition plan was drawn up personally by King Louis XVI.\n\nDuring the last half of the 18th century numerous expeditions of discovery were conducted. Jean-François de Galaup, Count La Perouse, was one of the most celebrated French navigators, a contemporary of Vancouver. (The fame of Count La Perouse is due more to his misfortunes than to his successes.) Having distinguished himself as a naval officer, he was sent by Louis XVI on a voyage around the world from which he was never to return. Off the coast of Tartary and in the Japanese seas he examined a part of the world which up to this time no European had visited and, after having corrected many geographical errors, sailed to Botany Bay, from where he forwarded his last message dated 7 February, 1788 to Paris. With the intention of sailing through Torres Straits to the Gulf of Carpentaria, he left the newborn English colony, but disappeared, and years passed on without ever solving the mystery of his fate.\n\nLas Cases, who happened to be in Santo Domingo at the time, was advised of his selection to accompany La Perouse. He immediately returned to France, but La Perouse had already sailed. He was completely distraught, but not a single person returned from the disastrous expedition. His destiny lay elsewhere.\n\nAnother of the men who applied for the advertised voyage was a sixteen year old Corsican named Bonaparte, a new second lieutenant from Paris’s military academy. Napoleon was briefly interested in serving in the navy rather than army because of his skills in mathematics and artillery, valued skills on naval warships. Napoleon was a pupil of Dagelet. Alexander Jean des Mazis, one of Napoleon’s friends at the school, wrote about Napoleon’s application. “Buonaparte would have liked the opportunity of displaying his energy in such a fine enterprise as an assistant astronomer.” The short list was drawn up by Condorcet, Jussieu and Buffon. The only pupil of Dagelet’s selected was Darbaud. So Napoleon did not go to Australia, but when appointed First Consul he did commission the Baudin expedition. (One can only speculate on the course history might have taken had Count La Pérouse selected the young Napoleon for this trip.\n\nThe French Revolution\n\nAfter the La Perouse affair, Las Cases obtained an appointment as an officer in a brig, but wished for a larger ship of the line instead. He threatened to leave the naval service unless his wish was granted. He was refused. Ironically again, the brig to which he was to be assigned, Le Matin, left France for Senegal accompanied by a French frigate. During the first night they became separated and the brig was never seen again. Once more Las Cases was destined for other things.\n\nLas Cases was now twenty-three. He was Count de Las Cases, had a high naval rank, and was presented at the Court of Louis XVI. He was in an enviable position in life. However, his life was to change dramatically in July, 1789, the start of the French Revolution, because he was an aristocrat.\n\nLas Cases saw the handwriting on the wall and was one of the first to emigrate, thus escaping the guillotine in the coming Reign of Terror. He accompanied the Prince de Conde to Worms, and then with the Count de Artois to Coblentz.\n\nCoblentz became the capital city of the émigrés from France. The court of the French royalty was reconstituted there with all the brilliance and attraction of Paris. Las Cases was privileged to enjoy its finery and societal pleasures, being intimately acquainted with Countess Balby and Countess Palastron, formerly in attendance on Marie Antoinette.\n\nNear Coblentz was Aix-la-Chapelle. It was another “watering hole” for all of the highly-placed royalty of Europe at the time, and Las Cases was there frequently hobnobbing. One of the princesses with whom he was involved was the unfortunate Princess Lamballe, as her family was connected to his. She and her family resided in Aix-la-Chapelle. She had been a personal Lady-in-Waiting to Marie Antoinette, but had left France when the revolution broke out. At the request of Marie Antoinette, Princess Lamballe returned to Paris to be with her. Las Cases accompanied Lamballe to the French border pleading with her not to return even offering to take her to Paris in disguise, but she refused. On the night of the “September Massacre”, September 21, 1792, Princess Lamballe was first imprisoned, then taken from her cell and cruelly murdered in the prison courtyard by “Sans Culottes”, revolutionaries. She was beheaded and dismembered, and her torso was raped repeatedly. Her head was placed on a pike and it was paraded in the street below the window of the Temple Prison in Paris where Marie Antoinette and her family were taken after being captured at Varennes.\n\nWhile in Aix-la-Chapelle Las Cases was befriended by Count de Haga, who was to become Gustavus III, King of Sweden. The Count offered Las Cases an appointment in the Swedish Navy, but Las Cases was delayed in meeting the King’s carriage and missed the opportunity. Gustavus was later assassinated. Again, Fate intervened for Las Cases.\n\nThe military campaign of 1792 now began against France. A majority of the royalty enlisted as common soldiers under the command of the Duke of Brunswick. Las Cases was part of the marine group of course, which engaged the National Guard at Brest. The best they could do however was to throw insults at each other – few casualties occurred. Neither side was very skilled in the art of war, and the Duke of Brunswick was defeated.\n\nLas Cases now traveled to Luxembourg, Maastricht, and finally to Rotterdam where he embarked on a British coal ship for England. He had to travel to London on foot because he was destitute. Everything he had previously achieved was gone. He also spoke no English.\n\nIn his memoirs Las Cases remarked:\n\n“Am I entitled to consider myself unfortunate when I cast a look on the helpless old men and the females among the emigrants, hitherto nursed in the lap of abundance and pleasure, and now thrown on the streets a prey to the most bitter misery, without assistance, without industry, nay, even without strength to apply it? And even when I consider the class to which I belong at present, when I see them continually labouring in the sweat of their brows, to gain their living from day to day, in constant danger of pining the next day of hunger; when I compare myself with them, can I call myself unhappy? An accident has plunged me into this situation, to-morrow I shall perhaps be rescued from it; but for these unfortunate beings, this is their natural condition, bitter poverty receives them at their birth and accompanies them to the grave; what a melancholy present then is life! How much have they cause to complain, and on the other hand how much cause have I to bless my destiny!”\n\nThe first thing Las Cases had to do was to learn English. He offered his services to anyone who would help in this instruction, and thus made a living doing so. He came to be regarded as a “polished man of the world” and was welcomed by everyone with whom he became acquainted, both high and low. He also kept his royal background a guarded secret and used an assumed name.\n\nHowever, a person of good character, with a good education, usually rises to the top regardless of circumstances. Las Cases began to make influential friends in London. He was offered the management position of a large estate in Jamaica, and other similar positions in India. But he felt these foreign positions equated with banishment so he refused them. Las Cases wanted to stay near to France.\n\nIt was at this time that Las Cases conceived his idea to create a “Historical Atlas”, which was extremely successful. He published the atlas under the pseudonym, Lesage. With the profits he bought an estate, and acquired many influential friends. He resided on his English estate peacefully for the next ten years. However, in 1800, something changed. Napoleon Bonaparte has assumed control of the French government. Las Cases was thirty four.\n\nLas Cases immediately traveled to Paris. While leaving France originally as an émigré had deprived him of his family estate confiscated by the revolution, just being back in France was enough.\n\nHe had originally published his Historical Atlas in English; he now translated it into French. It was an immediate success. Even Napoleon had obtained a copy. It was designed for all manner of readers, young and old, for pupils and teachers, for scholars, schools, and libraries. He spent the next six years in France peacefully keeping mostly to himself and his close friends. He was now independently wealthy again and content.\n\nLas Cases watched in amazement the battles and glory won by Napoleon at Austerlitz, Jena, Friedland, and especially the peace of Tilsit. He was proud of the way Napoleon had brought honor and respect back to France. He was most pleased at the crowning of Napoleon as Emperor, with the court and its pageantry returning to Paris, pageantry he had known much earlier before the revolution. He was again proud to be a Frenchman. Las Cases immediately offered himself to Napoleon to use as he wished without any reservations or conditions.\n\nLas Cases wrote in his memoirs:\n\n“I have truly fulfilled the oath of my childhood which I swore to the last dynasty; it exists no more; we begin with a new Hugh Capet; such a grand and sublime spectacle, such just claims to a throne did not appear before the eyes of our ancestors as now appear before ours. This new hero has elevated the fame of our country to the skies; his deeds are without example; he was the unanimous choice of a great people, the ruler whom all nations acknowledged, all spiritual and temporal authorities sanctioned.”\n\nLas Cases was again to take up arms. Napoleon was in Vienna with the multitude of the French Army. The English took the opportunity to attack Flushing and proceeded to the gates of Antwerp. Common French citizens took up arms, Las Cases among them. He had married and had a family, but his character forced him to leave them and defend France. He obtained a position on the General Staff of the Prince of Ponte Corvo (thereafter to become King John of Sweden), together with marshals Bessières and Oudinot. He was in the vanguard attacking the English troops at Flushing, who immediately retreated. It was for his service there that Napoleon recognized him and appointed him “Chamberlain”. The year was 1810.\n\nLas Cases left the military and took up his new position at the court of Napoleon. Shortly after Las Cases was constituted at court, he was appointed “Master of Requests” in the Department of Marine. It was in this position that Napoleon sent him on a secret mission. Las Cases was to locate and take possession of all military supplies connected with the marine that might be useful to France. As Las Cases was successful in this mission, Napoleon sent him to the Illyrian provinces to manage their finances. The provinces had been annexed to France for over three years. Las Cases took complete control and within six months most claims were properly dealt with or liquidated altogether.\n\nOn Las Cases’s return to Paris from Illyria Napoleon had him audit over half of all the governmental departments, including prisons and hospitals, and obtain accurate accountings. Napoleon also had Las Cases audit each French naval station from Toulon to Amsterdam. The finality of this mission took place at the return of Napoleon from Moscow in defeat. The Allies were now entering France. In Paris a National Guard was being formed, and Las Cases accepted command of the 10th legion. When the Allies entered Paris they were initially confronted by the 10th legion, suffering many casualties. Once the capitulation was signed, Las Cases gave up his command, and Louis XVIII was seated on the throne.\n\nLas Cases found himself in a critical situation. He had been so devoted to Napoleon, and now those Royalists who he had renounced were back in power. Could he transfer his feelings from Napoleon back to those he had renounced to follow Napoleon and the ideals of the revolution? Las Cases wrote in his journal:\n\n“I shall certainly bring myself to the determination of coming forward, my duty even demands this, but my feelings are still too much agitated by all that has taken place; I require a few days of mourning. Those princes are returned, who from my cradle have been the objects of my love and most fervent prayers, whose names I never pronounced without that respect to which, from their misfortunes, and as my former commanders, they were entitled; they are returned, but if I may own it, they no longer have a place in my heart, for they have returned through the breach of the national honour.“\n\nHe continued:\n\n“To serve the King, to love him, to be true to him, is now demanded by the obligations newly entered into; but to disown him who preceded him in the government, is to betray the cause of the nation, to expose it to danger and dishonour. Let this be well considered. To abuse him whom we have ruined, to forsake him, is neither more nor less than accumulating the whole of the fame of late times around his head, and loading us alone with the shame and the disgrace of the past.”\n\nLas Cases, as a member of the Council of State, refused to sign the Act of Accession, which he thought was illegal, which transferred the crown from Napoleon to Louis XVIII. His journal relates his comments to the other members:\n\n“How can you, councillors of state, take such a step? How can you consent to an act, which without the least doubt will be rejected by the new sovereign? Can that sovereign concede to the senate the right of giving and again withdrawing the crown in such a manner? And, independently of this altogether, are we not the confidential servants of the monarch who has been precipitated from the throne? In this our situation, is it in any respect permitted to us to express opinions? One feeling ought to animate us; and if the new comer understand his own interest well, you cannot recommend yourselves better to him than by your unshaken fidelity towards his predecessor on the throne.”\n\nWithin days after Louis XVIII was enthroned, the Journal des Debates, published especially for the event, listed the names of those noblemen who had assembled in the Place de Louis XV (now the Place de la Concorde) to welcome the new King. Among the names listed was the Count Las Cases. However, Las Cases never issued any such welcome, and his written correction submitted was refused publication. Part of his correction read:\n\n“It was impossible for me to have done this act, for I commanded the tenth legion of the national guard; colors in opposition to those of the King were entrusted to me; I was bound by oaths voluntarily taken by me; how then could I possibly have violated them, I who have always considered inviolable fidelity the first duty of life?”\n\nThis “correction” was to return to haunt Las Cases once he fell under the control of the British, especially on St. Helena and afterwards.\n\nAs Las Cases had become very politically influential during Napoleon’s reign, many of the émigrés now appealed to him upon their return to France for appointments to the new court. They tried to justify their emigration based upon their impoverished condition after the start of the revolution, but Las Cases would not assist them stating:\n\n“Spare, my friends, your justification; boast rather that you have not abandoned your country; the greatest of all crimes is to remove from it with hostile intentions; this was an error of my youth, and I still repent it every day; to this step I was led by so much honesty and sincerity, that except myself no one is justified in reproaching me with it; a few weeks ago while the imperial government still subsisted, I should not have been able to hold this language to you, as it would then have appeared suspicious; but now under the King, when the act in question constitutes a claim to reward, this confession serves to relieve the oppression of my heart.”\n\nIt was heart-rending for Las Cases to view the multitude of Allied soldiers flooding into Paris – a daily humiliation for France. Finally, Las Cases traveled back to England, but he was not happy there as his life had much changed since leaving years before. He returned to Paris. He secluded himself on his estate and counted on living out a peaceful life until March 20, 1815. Napoleon had returned!\n\nNapoleon immediately drew Las Cases back to him and appointed him Councilor of State. With this appointment Napoleon stated:\n\n“So much good has been told me of you that I could not act otherwise towards you; but besides it is with true pleasure on my part that this has taken place.”\n\nLas Cases now believed that France’s shame was gone, with fame and honor returning with the reappearance of France’s hero, Napoleon Bonaparte. Las Cases’s future seemed assured with all the various ministries open to him – he had only to choose and Napoleon would grant his wish. Las Cases finally accepted the position of President of the Commission of Petitions. It was analogous to Sir Thomas More being appointed Chancellor of England by Henry XVIII. But, Waterloo would change everything again three months later.\n\nWhen Napoleon returned to Malmaison after Waterloo, Las Cases returned to his side immediately. By this act Las Cases’s destiny was intertwined with that of Napoleon, assuring it for all time. Las Cases left his wife and children to be at Napoleon’s side and to devote himself to him once again. On St. Helena Napoleon questioned Las Cases about this and he remarked:\n\n“Sire, my stars alone, and the honor of emigration have brought me here; I now represent those of the emigrants who were formerly loaded with favours by your Majesty.”\n\nNapoleon was concerned where it might lead, but Las Cases was not deterred. Las Cases returned to his home in Paris and began to pack and say his goodbyes to his Wife and children. He then went to the Lyceum where his oldest son was studying, and they both were on the road to Rochefort the following day meeting up with Napoleon a few days later.\n\nTurning to Napoleon briefly, he traveled to the port of Rochefort without escort so as not to attract attention. However, as he passed through small towns he was recognized and the townspeople cheered him as his coach sped forward. On reaching Rochefort Napoleon discovered the harbor entrance was fully blocked by British ships. (His original plan was to board an American ship for the United States.) Now that his escape was thwarted, Napoleon realized that remaining in France would probably result in civil war, which he knew should be avoided. He decided to avail himself of the protection of English law.\n\nNapoleon requested his companions General Savary, the Duke of Rovigo, and General Lallemand, together with Las Cases, to visit the English flagship in the harbor, Bellerophon, commanded by Captain Maitland, to discuss Napoleon’s potential surrender. Maitland advised them that Admiral Keith of the British Admiralty has instructed him to receive Napoleon and his retinue and to convey them all to England. No other representations were made other than the offer of transportation. Having received this offer Napoleon wrote a lengthy letter directly to the Prince Regent. This letter was delivered to Captain Maitland during the boarding of Napoleon and his companions onto Bellerophon. The ship then sailed for England.\n\nSeveral days after Napoleon boarded Bellerophon it reached Plymouth and set anchor, but the French were prohibited from disembarking. During the time it was at anchor awaiting further orders from the Admiralty, the British inspected each and every piece of luggage brought on board. Many items were confiscated, including money and precious stones. It was finally decided that Napoleon would be exiled to the island of St. Helena off the West coast of Africa. It was also decided that only a minimal group of people could accompany Napoleon. Of those allowed were Las Cases and his teenage son. At the time Admiral Lord Keith was on board the ship that was to take them to St. Helena, Northumberland. At the site of those who were not allowed to go with Napoleon Las Cases remarked to Lord Keith, “You see however, my lord, that it is those alone who remain behind that weep.”\n\nThe voyage to St. Helena, roughly 6000 miles from England, took more than eight weeks. The British sailors had fully expected Napoleon to be the “wild beast” he was thought to be by those who didn’t know him. During the voyage Napoleon dispelled this myth being wholly patient and agreeable with all those with whom he came in contact, especially the British officers with whom he ate and discussed his previous battles. They were equally impressed by Las Cases by his devotion to Napoleon and the affection he showed toward him. Napoleon gained the respect and compassion, and even some attachment to many of the British officers and men during the voyage.\n\nNapoleon was very pleased to have Las Cases along as he had lived in England and spoke English fluently. Las Cases was also very familiar with English law and English customs. Las Cases had also been a French naval officer and could advise Napoleon about the ship and the voyage. Napoleon was also very familiar with Las Cases’s Historical Atlas, which he had made good use of on many occasions. As a result, Napoleon considered Las Cases his confidant, and spent many hours each day in conversation with him. It was on board Northumberland in fact that Napoleon began dictating to Las Cases the events of his first Italian campaign. Lastly, Napoleon was obviously pleased to have Las Cases along because he had Hortense’s diamond necklace concealed in his belt!\n\nArriving at St. Helena Napoleon discovered that there were no accommodations for him and his retinue. For the next two months, until Longwood was prepared, Las Cases lived with Napoleon under the same roof, often spending the day in the same room with him in conversation and dictation. By the time Longwood was ready Napoleon and Las Cases had developed an intimate friendship. Not only did Las Cases give Napoleon instruction in the English language, but they frequently walked together, ate together, and enjoyed quiet, confidential conversations, all of which allowed Las Cases and Napoleon to have confidence in each other, and allowed Las Cases to know the “private” Napoleon. This relationship lasted for eighteen months. Las Cases had become indispensible to Napoleon.\n\nFrom October, 1815 to April, 1816 Napoleon and his little group had existed on St. Helena in a generally quiet atmosphere. Even the British officers and soldiers guarding Longwood respectfully saluted Napoleon when he was out riding. However, in April, 1816 things would change drastically. Sir Hudson Lowe had arrived to take over as Governor of St. Helena, and personally charged with the confinement of Napoleon. Las Cases was subjected to immediate persecution by Sir Hudson Lowe once he discovered his usefulness to Napoleon.\n\nThere are several possible reasons for Lowe’s attitude toward Napoleon and his followers. Lowe arrived in April, 1816, only four short months after his first marriage in December 1815. His wife had been widowed during the Napoleonic Wars and thus she harbored a grudge against anything “Napoleon”, which probably rubbed off on Lowe. Lowe had also been obliged to surrender the Isle of Capri to Napoleon when he had occupied it commanding the Corsican Rangers. Lastly, Lowe was not an aristocrat, being as he was the son of a regimental surgeon, as well as having been born in Ireland. Lowe was keenly aware of his low birth and the fact that he was considered “expendable” by the Army in his capacity as Napoleon’s jailer, a position nobody else really wanted because of the responsibility – it was a potential career-breaker. These surely motivated Lowe’s attitude to some high degree. As Wellington put it, “We sent a man who only knows how to follow orders to guard a man who only knows how to give them!” While Lowe was an educated man, speaking several languages, Las Cases was his superior in both intellect and temperament. It was to be the undoing for Las Cases. The only other issue relevant is the competition between the British Army and Navy. When Napoleon first arrived at St. Helena he was under the authority of Adm. Cockburn, who replaced then Governor of St. Helena, Col. Mark Wilks. Six months later came “General” Sir Hudson Lowe.\n\nWhen Adm. Cockburn arrived at St. Helena with Napoleon in October, 1815, he brought with him the specific instructions issued by Lord Bathurst for the supervision of Napoleon and his retinue. During the period prior to Lowe’s arrival in April, 1816, some six months, Adm. Cockburn had either not enforced or relaxed many of the restrictions in the original order. Lowe however, brought the same instructions, and was bound to enforce them. This created immediate difficulties between him and Napoleon, and especially Las Cases. There was instant friction and hard feelings.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding the friction between Lowe, Napoleon, Las Cases, and the other members of the French retinue are well known, and well documented. What is not well known or well documented are some of the nuances involved between Las Cases and Sir Hudson Lowe.\n\nWhen Napoleon returned to France from Elba in March, 1815, he instructed Las Cases to remain as Chamberlain to Napoleon’s brother, Lucien. When Napoleon was notified onboard Northumberland that he was to be exiled to St. Helena, he requested that Las Cases join him. When Las Cases left Lucien to meet Napoleon in Rochefort, he promised Lucien he would keep him advised of what occurred with Napoleon, not knowing yet that they were headed for St. Helena.\n\nArriving at St. Helena all of Napoleon’s retinue were required to sign an agreement that stipulated that none of them would enter into any communications or correspondence for the purpose of assisting Napoleon to escape on pain of being banished from the island if caught. All signed without hesitation, including Las Cases and his fifteen year old son. (This signed document is in the “Lowe Papers” in the British Library.)\n\nIt was Lord Bathurst’s idea to restrict any news from England or Europe from reaching Napoleon so that he would not know the lies being perpetrated about him. (The “victor” always gets to write the “history”!) Lowe rigidly enforced this by reading every newspaper and journal, and censuring them where necessary, before sending them up to Longwood. (Read the “Gift of Napoleon” in First Empire #109.) However, some newspapers managed to get through, especially those smuggled to Longwood, or left lying about by workmen or suppliers. Napoleon took much of it in stride, but it incensed Las Cases, especially as he had lived in England.\n\nDuring the time Las Cases spent with Napoleon, when not taking dictation, he wrote in a journal each evening various remarks made to him by Napoleon. Nothing was entered into the journal that was remotely “confidential”, or that could be considered seditious – just general commentaries on various subjects. What was written however could have been used to refute the lies being written elsewhere.\n\nNapoleon had left behind a large family; a wife, a son, a mother, brothers and sisters, and many close friends. Surely they would want some idea of how Napoleon was faring in exile, his health, his needs and wants, and his outlook? Lowe prohibited any communication by Napoleon with the outside world, and prevented most communications from there to him. Lowe also prevented most communications from Las Cases to or from his family, and certainly to others. Every piece of correspondence to or from Longwood was to be submitted to Lowe for his censure and disposition. Many were either returned to the submitter or destroyed. This cruel process incited in Las Cases the utmost indignation as it was far less than even the worst incarcerated criminal was required to endure. He was ashamed of the English among whom he had lived and respected. He was certain that, if the common Englishman were aware of these circumstances, they would be outraged.\n\nRecalling his promise to Lucien when departing Paris for Rochefort, Las Cases was presented with an opportunity, after more than a year, to correspond with him to apprise him of what had occurred. In September, 1816, Las Cases was approached by an English servant, James Scott, who had been in attendance on Las Cases at Longwood, and with whom Las Cases had struck up a friendship. Scott, who was about to depart St. Helena for England, apparently offered to carry a communication for Las Cases and forward it to Lucien. Las Cases wrote a lengthy letter to Lucien describing all that had occurred from the sailing from England until the present time. He detailed many of the occurrences and outrages on the part of Lowe, and the poor conditions under which they had existed.\n\nShortly before departing, Scott, the servant carrying Las Cases’s letter to Lucien, was stopped and searched, and the letter was discovered and delivered to Hudson Lowe. Lowe at once used the letter written by Las Cases to Lucien as his corpus delicti to instantly remove Las Cases from Longwood and Napoleon’s side. Lowe had obviously been just waiting for such an opportunity based upon the circumstances that followed.\n\nFor a completely different rendition of the circumstances surrounding the letter Las Cases wrote to Lucien, we look to the Russian Commissioner on St. Helena, Count Balmain, who sent timely reports back to Czar Alexander. (Balmain, by the way, ultimately married Lowe’s oldest step-daughter, Charlotte, who returned to Russia with her husband.)\n\nAccording to Count Balmain, Las Cases’s health and that of his young son were beginning to fail after a year on St. Helena. (In fact, in October, 1816 both Dr. O’Meara and Dr. Baxter recommended that they be removed from St. Helena for health reasons.) They had been assigned to the most uncomfortable room at Longwood, barely large enough for them both. It was small, smelly, and stifling. Las Cases had employed, with the permission of Lowe, an English mulatto named James Scott as his “domestic”. Slavery was legal when Lowe first arrived on St. Helena, but Scott was a free man and the son of an Englishman. (Lowe abolished slavery on St. Helena during his tenure as governor.)\n\nIn Balmain’s opinion, Las Cases’s use of Scott was an “intrigue”, and not an innocent undertaking. Las Cases was not in fear of detection because he knew that if he were found out he would be thrown off the island by Lowe. He also knew he would not incur the wrath of Napoleon because Napoleon would consider him a victim.\n\nScott passed easily through the guards entering Longwood. (Lowe ultimately decided that, if a mulatto could pass so easily past the guards, how difficult would it be for Napoleon?) Las Cases was arrested by Lowe on 25 November, 1816. Balmain wrote to Alexander:\n\n“The Counts de las Cases, of Bonaparte’s suite, were arrested on 25 November by order of the Governor: the father for having attempted, by bribing an inhabitant of the island, to send letters to Europe, and the son for having aided in the attempt. Sir Hudson Lowe, who is becoming more reticent toward the Commissioners, has told us nothing of the background of the affair. The following details I owe to a well informed person.”\n\nBalmain continues his report:\n\n“Count de las Cases on arriving at St. Helena engaged a servant, a very intelligent mulatto named Scott. He soon learned to rely on his faithfulness, and, to put it to the test, charged him with an insignificant but secret message. The Governor was immediately informed of it by the person to whom it was addressed, and the mulatto was ordered to leave his master. M. de las Cases, with his views as to the usefulness of this man, showed him great kindness, and in order that the latter have a plausible pretext for reappearing at Longwood, he engaged him to take there a part of his clothes. The plot now moved rapidly. The Count made up a large volume of letters, and had his son transcribe them in tiny writing on several handkerchiefs of white silk. When this was done, they sewed the handkerchiefs into a waistcoat, and impatiently awaited the mulatto. Two months elapsed before he came. They proposed to him to go to England on the first boat. As he was free, and hoped for a large reward, he did not hesitate. He then put on the waistcoat containing the precious letters, which the mulatto promised on his arrival to hand to a lady named Clavering, who is French by parentage and the widow of an Englishman formerly a prisoner in Antwerp.”\n\n“Scott, although glad to serve his former masters, was by no means sure of his part. Played upon now by the hope of a happy issue, a now by the fear of a terrible punishment, in order to reassure himself he told all to his father, one of the farmers on the island. The latter wanted to force his son to confess immediately to the Governor, and on the young man’s refusal, he tore the fatal waistcoat from him, perceived the handkerchiefs, and carried the whole thing to Plantation House. The son was promptly placed in a cell, and has already undergone several examinations. The Las Cases were arrested the next day.”\n\n“It is said that Bonaparte has had no hand in this affair and that nothing points to an attempt at escape. However that may be, it is certain that the Governor will never allow the Commissioners to see the handkerchiefs, and that the result will be the same as with Count Montholon’s note – we shall have them unknown to him.”\n\nOne must remember that this report by Balmain to Alexander was based on “hearsay”, and not on any personal knowledge. However, the result is the same whether or not there was intrigue on the part of Las Cases.\n\nThe original signed agreement, and the original orders for the confinement of Napoleon, only provided for the removal of anyone from St. Helena who violated these instructions, nothing more. However, Lowe’s full fury and hatred now descended upon Las Cases, probably as an example. Las Cases was taken by force from Longwood, treated as a prisoner, and guarded like a criminal. He spent considerable time secluded, along with his son, in a small room adjacent to Hutt’s Gate where the Bertrands lived. The room was barely large enough to house the two small beds for father and son. Las Cases, of course, complained to Lowe, especially as his son had taken sick, but Lowe would do nothing for them until his letter sent to Lord Bathurst had been answered. Since it took six weeks to travel to England, and then six weeks back, they prepared to be there for at least the next three months.\n\nDuring the forcible removal of Las Cases and his son from Longwood, Lowe allowed Las Cases to at least pack up their possessions, among which Las Cases was able to hide many of the papers he had authored. However, after arriving in England from the Cape of Good Hope, his luggage was searched on secret orders of Lord Bathurst, and all his papers were confiscated. Among the letters was a copy of the letter to Lucien, the original of which had been confiscated by Lowe. The letters that Las Cases was not able to hide at Longwood were confiscated by Lowe who sent them to Lord Bathurst with Lowe’s request for the disposition of Las Cases. In a subsequent conversation between Napoleon and Dr. O’Meara on 3 October, 1816, Napoleon stated, “Las Cases would not be blockheaded enough to write lies, when he was obliged to send letters [through Lowe’s] hands.”\n\nAt some point during the imprisonment of them it was determined by Lowe to send Las Cases and his son to the Cape. By the treatment they received by the British governor there, it was obvious that Lowe must have corresponded with him prior to Las Cases arriving. Las Cases thought that, once away from St. Helena and Hudson Lowe, he would naturally be dealt with in accordance with British law – he was wrong. The governor of the Cape, Lord Somerset, detained Las Cases and his son in close custody as prisoners. Las Cases pleaded with Somerset to allow him and his son to proceed to Europe, but Somerset refused. He too sent off to England for instructions as to their disposition. Las Cases and his son remained at the Cape for nearly eight months. During this time both Las Cases and his sickly son were denied medical treatment by Somerset.\n\nFinally, Las Cases and his son, at their own expense, were allowed to board a small English coal ship for England. It took some twelve weeks for the ship to arrive in England, during which time Las Cases’s son became gravely ill and nearly died. This “freighter” only had a crew of twelve, and they were virtual prisoners on it. Upon arrival in England, before leaving this ship, Las Cases was met on board by English “agents” of Lord Bathurst, who searched all of the luggage and confiscated copies of the letters of complaint sent to Lord Somerset by Las Cases while interned at the Cape. Everything was sent to Lord Bathurst.\n\nLas Cases had expected, once back in England, to see his old friends; however this was not to be. Finding lodgings at the port in Plymouth, he was awakened in the middle of the night and he and his son were seized and sent to Dover. During the next three days at Dover the papers that had been confiscated at Plymouth were returned, together with writing paper and pen. Las Cases was encouraged to commit his complaints in writing. On the fourth day in Dover, when Las Cases was preparing to board a ship for Ostende, agents again searched his luggage and again seized all his papers, including the new ones he had just written. They refused to neither inventory the papers nor let Las Cases place his seal on them. Las Cases had no choice – the agents showed him written instructions for their actions signed by the Prince Regent.\n\nArriving in Ostende Las Cases was again met by British agents who took him and his son into custody, escorting them directly to the French border where they were released. However, Louis XVIII refused to allow Las Cases back into France. Only after Napoleon had died in 1821 was Las Cases allowed to return. Las Cases then published his acclaimed and very successful Mémorial de Sainte-Hélène in 1823.\n\nAmazingly, the persecution of Las Cases was debated in the House of Commons on 14 May, 1818. It occurred as the result of the lengthy letter Las Cases wrote to Lord Bathurst from Frankfurt in December, 1817, the copy of which was first published in early 1818. In this letter Las Cases detailed all of the events he and his son suffered at the hands of Hudson Lowe, Lord Somerset, and Bathurst himself upon their arrival in England. It created a firestorm of protest both in the newspapers and from the public. Las Cases demanded the return of his papers illegally seized, justice and redress for the abuse of authority by Somerset, justice and redress for sending them to Ostende as common prisoners, and the return of a specific letter written to Las Cases by Napoleon thanking Las Cases for his loyalty and friendship. Only the papers seized by Hudson Lowe forwarded to Bathurst were ever returned.\n\nNapoleon died on 5 May, 1821, by which time Las Cases was firmly implanted back in France, living quietly. His eldest son, who had accompanied him to St. Helena, was twenty-one. By the summer of 1821 everyone connected with the exile of Napoleon had departed St. Helena. But the story does not end there!\n\nOn 22 October, 1822, the younger Count Las Cases found himself visiting in London with a friend. Riding in a carriage along the road near Paddington Green, near Hyde Park and Oxford Street, they spotted Sir Hudson Lowe standing in front of his house. Las Cases leaped from the carriage with his horse whip and proceeded to beat Hudson Lowe with it to the ground mercilessly. Had his friend not stopped him, Las Cases surely would have killed Lowe! The true ‘gentleman’, Las Cases dropped his carte de visite on Lowe telling him the name of the hotel at which he was staying if Lowe wanted ‘satisfaction’. Las Cases and his friend then left Lowe lying in the street. Between 23 October and 4 November, several more letter exchanges took place in the London papers.\n\nRather than confront Las Cases, Lowe filed a complaint for assault with the police. By the time the police found Las Cases’s hotel, Las Cases had already left for Paris.\n\nA week after the altercation with Lowe, Las Cases was in Rouen. A friend in Paris, M. Pelouze, had inquired about the incident. Las Cases wrote back to him the following letter [translation from the French]:\n\n“I have just arrived this morning, Sire, and have had, as a matter of fact, much difficulty to escape from the justice officers from Bond Street and Marny to whom Sir Hudson Lowe, Knight of the Order of the Bath, Major General, had given the task to repair his outraged honor. The gentleman obtained on the evening of the 22nd or morning of the 23rd a warrant against me, accusing me to have assaulted him and thus I have been hounded by the law all of Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.”\n\n“Friday evening, as I had not received a message from Sir Hudson Lowe, I deemed safer to leave England. I had written already, on Wednesday evening, to Sir Hudson Lowe stating that if he wished to conduct himself as a man of honour I was ready to answer to him, but should he choose the road of justice, I would deem myself authorized to leave England; thus upon leaving London on Friday evening I sent him the following letter:\n\n‘Sir, after the altercation between us Tuesday morning in front of your house and after which, I agree, I have shown you disrespect in the most formal manner, I thought you would send me a message. Not seeing anything from you regardless of the time which went by, I am going back to France. I think that the same way I travelled to London; you should be able to do the trip to Paris or Ostende or to any other place in France or Belgium which could be agreeable to you. I will always be ready to meet with you.’\n\nLas Cases then added what he told the newspaper editor:\n\n“I also would like that you send this communication to the gentlemen of the constitutional body for the same reason. It is fair to say that Sir Hudson Lowe will have to pay for all the costs of justice and police, which will be quite considerable.”\n\nLas Cases ended his letter to his friend:\n\n“Will you, Sir, excuse the poor construction of this letter and believe in my consideration with which I have the honor of being your most humble and very obedient servant.”\n\nSigned, “De Las Cases”, “Rouen”, this Monday, 28th 1822.\n\nIronically, Emmanuel Las Cases (Junior) was present at the exhumation of Napoleon at St. Helena on October 15, 1840.\n\nSir Hudson Lowe died broke in his home in Paddington Green, London on 10 January, 1844. He was initially buried in St. Mark’s Church on North Audley Street nearby, but his grave has never been located. Only a plaque remains on the church’s wall citing his burial.\n\nCount Las Cases went on to author his memoirs of his captivity with Napoleon and grow very wealthy as a result.
