        "text": "Hugo Duminil-Copin is a probabilist. His work focuses on the mathematical branch of statistical physics. He uses ideas from probability theory to study the critical behavior of various models on networks, such as the Ising, Potts, the self-avoiding walks and the percolation models. These mathematical objects describe a number of physical phenomena (such as magnetization, polymers, material porosity, etc.) by reframing them through random trajectories, sets or graphs.\n\nMaxim Kontsevich belongs to a new generation of mathematicians who have been able to integrate in their area of work aspects of quantum theory, opening up radically new perspectives.\n\nAhmed Abbes primarily studies the geometric and cohomological properties of sheaves on varieties over perfect fields of characteristic p>0 or over p-adic fields, with a view towards applications in arithmetic and algebraic geometry.\n\nThierry Bodineau's work focuses on mathematical problems from statistical mechanics. He has studied, in collaboration with Bernard Derrida, stochastic processes to characterize the properties of flow in non-equilibrium systems. More recently, he has worked, with Isabelle Gallagher, Laure Saint-Raymond and Sergio Simonella, to analyze the stochastic behavior of hard sphere dynamics in the kinetic limit.\n\nFanny Kassel studies geometric, dynamical, and spectral aspects of discrete subgroups of Lie groups. She is particularly interested in actions of discrete groups on homogeneous spaces, in relation to geometric structures on manifolds and to higher Teichmüller-Thurston theory.\n\nFrank Merle is studying the singularities of non-linear partial differential equations. Member at Université de Cergy-Pontoise of the CNRS \"Analysis, geometry and modelization\" lab (UMR 8088), his research themes that arise out of hard analysis and have an important impact on mathematical physics.­­\n\nJérémie Szeftel, CNRS Research Director at the Jacques-Louis Lions Laboratory of Sorbonne University, specializes in nonlinear partial differential equations, and more particularly in the equations of general relativity and the phenomenon of finite time explosion.\n\nClément Delcamp is a theoretical physicist working on topics at the interface of condensed matter theory and algebraic topology. His current research focuses on leveraging our knowledge of topological field theory to investigate the concepts of symmetry and duality within quantum lattice models.\n\nJean-Pierre Bourguignon holds an engineering degree from École Polytechnique (year group 1966) and a Ph.D. in mathematical sciences from University Paris 7 (1974). His field of predilection is differential geometry, particularly in its relations with partial differential equations and mathematical physics.\n\nMikhail Gromov has totally reshaped geometry, by showing how important it was to take into account systematically and in their entirety objects less regular than those normally considered by geometers.\n\nDavid Ruelle has proved a structure theorem about a class of polynomials which appear in the well-known Circle Theorem of Lee and Yang. Otherwise, he has worked mainly on the problem of linear response in differentiable dynamics, and its applications to nonequilibrium statistical mechanics.\n\nJean Bourgain was awarded the Fields Medal in 1994. He mainly worked on ergodic theory and partial differential equations. After leaving IHES, he held a position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, until his death in 2018. Jean Bourgain was elected foreign associate of the French Academy of Sciences in April 2000 and in 2016 he was awarded the Antonio Feltinelli prize by the Italian Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei.\n\nAlexander Grothendieck set the framework for modern algebraic geometry, which is now universally adopted. His work was further amplified by Pierre Deligne, originally his disciple, who was recruited to IHES at the age of 26 and is now established at the Institute for Advanced Studies (IAS) in Princeton. Thanks to these new tools, it was possible to bring algebraic geometry and number theory together in a decisive way. He wrote the first four chapters of the famous “Éléments de Géométrie Algébrique” with Jean Dieudonné from 1960 to 1967.\n\nLaurent Lafforgue became a mathematician mainly through the study of the new algebraic functorial geometry that Alexander Grothendieck created at the end of the 1950s and that he developed at IHES with his collaborators and students.\n\nLouis Michel worked on the symmetry of the laws of nature, on particle theory, and on the unification of fundamental interactions. Louis Michel was, like Eugene Wigner, one of the great promoters of the use of group theory in physics, both in the theory of elementary particles and in crystallography.\n\nLéon Motchane was born in Russia in 1900. He studied in Lausanne, Switzerland, before becoming a physician assistant in a laboratory. He arrived in France in 1924 and left the academic world for the business world. Fascinated by mathematics and physics, Léon Motchane continued his education in mathematics at the age of 54 and obtained his thesis under the supervision of Gustave Choquet.\n\nNikita Nekrasov received his PhD from Princeton University in 1996. A physicist, he is best known for his works at the interface of gauge theories and string theory and on modern mathematical physics, thus enriching all these areas of research.\n\nRené Thom covered a huge area of science: starting from topology, the field of mathematics that looks at forms and deformations, he created the “mathematics of morphogenesis”, putting forward models for biology and human sciences.\n\nDennis Sullivan, an American mathematician, split his research activities between the US and France for years. A topologist, specialised in dynamics, he had a rare gift for promoting exchanges among researchers and motivating them to reach new heights in their thinking."
