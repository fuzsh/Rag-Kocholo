        "text": "Different people wrote different parts. Weil indicates somewhere that he wrote the Note historique about infinitesimal calculus. A perusal of Archives de l'Association des Collaborateurs de Nicolas Bourbaki might provide further hints.\n\nOther possible sources of information are articles and interviews by Henri Cartan, Jean Dieudonn√©, Armand Borel, and Laurent Schwartz about their involvement with Bourbaki.\n\nAmong the living, Pierre Cartier, Roger Godement and Jean-Pierre Serre should be able to provide you ample information. Bourbaki's biographer Liliane Beaulieu might be another source of information."
