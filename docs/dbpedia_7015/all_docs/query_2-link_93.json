Diffuse-porous trees form vessels of roughly the same radial diameter throughout the growing…\n\ndiffuser (optics)\n\nenlarger: Another type is the diffuser, which scatters the light from the bulb so that it falls evenly across the film. Light sources and optical systems are chosen depending on the type of film being used and the characteristics desired on the enlarged print. Condensers are used for prints with…\n\ndiffuser pump\n\npump: Kinetic pumps.: …flow centrifugal pump is the diffuser pump, in which, after the fluid has left the impeller, it is passed through a ring of fixed vanes that diffuse the liquid, providing a more controlled flow and a more efficient conversion of velocity head into pressure head.\n\ndiffusion (physics)\n\ndiffusion, process resulting from random motion of molecules by which there is a net flow of matter from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration. A familiar example is the perfume of a flower that quickly permeates the still air of a room. Heat conduction in fluids involves\n\ndiffusion bonding (metallurgy)\n\nwelding: Diffusion bonding: This type of bonding relies on the effect of applied pressure at an elevated temperature for an appreciable period of time. Generally, the pressure applied must be less than that necessary to cause 5 percent deformation so that the process can be applied…\n\ndiffusion chamber (device)\n\ndiffusion chamber, simple form of cloud chamber, a device used for radiation detection (see cloud\n\ndiffusion coefficient (physics)\n\ngas: Diffusion: …components and is called the diffusion coefficient, D12, for that gas pair. This relationship between the flow rate and the concentration difference is called Fick’s law of diffusion. The SI units for the diffusion coefficient are square metres per second (m2/s). Diffusion, even in gases, is an extremely slow process,…\n\ndiffusion equation (mathematics)\n\nfluid mechanics: Boundary layers and separation: This is a diffusion equation. It indicates that, if the plate oscillates to and fro with frequency f, then the so-called boundary layer within which Ω3 is nonzero has a thickness δ given byand in most instances of oscillatory motion this is small enough for the boundary layer…\n\ndiffusion flame (chemistry)\n\ncombustion: Diffusion flames: Diffusion flames, smoothly flowing (laminar) or turbulent, belong to the class of flames whose ingredients are not mixed prior to entering the burning zone. Molecular or turbulent diffusion is responsible for the mixing of the gases in such flames. The distribution of the…\n\ndiffusion index (economics)\n\neconomic forecasting: Selection of turning points: …use sets of statistics called diffusion indexes to calculate economic turning points. A diffusion index is a method of summarizing the common tendency of a group of statistical series. If a greater number of the series are rising than are declining, the index will be above 50; if fewer are…"
