        "text": "Some students of an High School asked me some books from famous mathematicians that they can read (so advanced high school level focused mainly on real-analysis). They were asking things like Cauchy, Fermat... but I think the language would be technical in an akward ancient way for them so that probably will not be suitable. I thought that maybe Riemann dissertation could do but maybe it's too advanced. I then thought Galois, but again the original papers are quite difficult to understand if you don't already have the right picture in your mind.\n\nI'm not sure there's effectively a book from an historically famous mathematician that could fit the request. They didn't specifically requested that the argument should be mathematical even if I think they implied this, otherwise I could suggest something of Poincar√© which rather philosophical but at least readable.\n\nThey didin't specify the period (even if I think they might want to already know the name of the writer). In modern period maybe I would suggest Mumford the Indra's Pearls. But I'm quite sure they don't know Mumford...\n\nI'm now thinking that maybe some kind of physicist would be better. But they were asking mathematicians.\n\nI really don't have a clue of what to suggest. Please help me!"
