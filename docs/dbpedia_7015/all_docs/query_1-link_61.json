After working at Rennes, Nancy and San Paulo in Brazil, he went to the USA in 1952 and was appointed professor of mathematics at the University of Michigan. After teaching at Northwestern University Dieudonné returned, in 1959, to Paris. In 1964 he accepted a chair at Nice.\n\nDieudonné was one of the two main contributors to the Bourbaki series of texts. He began his mathematical career working on the analysis of polynomials. He worked in a wide variety of mathematical areas including general topology, topological vector spaces, algebraic geometry, invariant theory and the classical groups.\n\nHis best known books are La Géométrie des groupes classiques (1955), Foundations of Modern Analysis (1960), and Algèbre linéaire et géométrie élémentaire (1964).\n\nReferences (9 books/articles)\n\nJOC/EFR December 1996"
