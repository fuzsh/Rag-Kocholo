        "text": "In the comments, Kevin Long suggested\n\nHopefully this isn't getting too off topic, but I've heard that when Stan Ulam was in the hospital for encephalitis, Paul Erdos went to meet him when he was discharged and spent a few weeks at his house, plying him with math questions and playing chess with him. At the time, Ulam was afraid that the incident would have affected his mathematical ability, but Erdos helped him build his confidence back up. So if the professor in question is feeling suboptimal, some (small) math problems might be good.\n\nPersonally, when I had to stay for longer periods at the hospital, the most difficult part for me was to overcome the boredom. There aren't that many books I would enjoy reading for 8 hours a day, 7 days a week... from that perspective, math problems might make sense, because mathematicians like to spend sheer endless amounts of time on problems that they find engaging. In that spirit, I'd like to suggest The Art of Mathematics: Coffee Time in Memphis by Béla Bollobás. It contains many interesting problems, all with elegant solutions, some due to famous mathematicians such as Erdos.\n\nThe World of Mathematics by James R. Newman, 1956, 4 volumes. This is a collection of 133 essays written by the pantheon of mathematical thinkers: Descartes, Archimedes, Newton, Euler, Galileo, Bernoulli, Malthus, Laplace, Poincare, Mach, Einstein, Boole, Turing and dozens more.\n\nChapters average about 20 pages and need not be read in order, so the book is ideal to pick up for a brief diversion and then put aside for later.\n\nFor more detail, see the review by David E.H. Jones in Nature, 337 (February 2 1989), p. 420. (Link here.)\n\nnot sure why you emphasize history... There are now translations of Fricke and Klein into English. Favorite of mine. The preface is pretty funny.\n\nhttps://bookstore.ams.org/ctm-3/\n\nYour ailing friend can try to find where the theorems are. A major one I have used with considerable enjoyment is on pages 507-508 of the German original, page 412 in the translation. I guess we know it is a theorem or lemma or the like as it is in italics. There is also one in the middle of the page where they admit everything, \"obtain the following theorem:\"\n\nI bought a cheap reprint of the 1897 German original. Cheap because it was scanned online by a major library, but I wanted a paper version\n\nAn alternative to a history may be a serious introduction to an advanced field of mathematics that FRS has never touched. Mathematics is so broad now that no one can cover it all. A stay in a hospital is a chance not to recapitulate the old but to explore something genuinely new. That spirit of discovery can be more healing, and who knows what serendipity is possible.\n\nAnother engaging read:\n\nBair, J.; Błaszczyk, P.; Heinig, P.; Katz, M.; Schäfermeyer, J.; Sherry, D. \"Klein vs Mehrtens: restoring the reputation of a great modern.\" Mat. Stud. 48 (2017), no. 2. See arxiv.\n\nThe abstract reads:\n\nHistorian Herbert Mehrtens sought to portray the history of turn-of-the-century mathematics as a struggle of modern vs countermodern, led respectively by David Hilbert and Felix Klein. Some of Mehrtens' conclusions have been picked up by both historians (Jeremy Gray) and mathematicians (Frank Quinn). We argue that Klein and Hilbert, both at Goettingen, were not adversaries but rather modernist allies in a bid to broaden the scope of mathematics beyond a narrow focus on arithmetized analysis as practiced by the Berlin school. Klein's Goettingen lecture and other texts shed light on Klein's modernism. Hilbert's views on intuition are closer to Klein's views than Mehrtens is willing to allow. Klein and Hilbert were equally interested in the axiomatisation of physics. Among Klein's credits is helping launch the career of Abraham Fraenkel, and advancing the careers of Sophus Lie, Emmy Noether, and Ernst Zermelo, all four surely of impeccable modernist credentials. Mehrtens' unsourced claim that Hilbert was interested in production rather than meaning appears to stem from Mehrtens' marxist leanings.\n\nMehrtens' claim that [the future SS-Brigadefuehrer] \"Theodor Vahlen ... cited Klein's racist distinctions within mathematics, and sharpened them into open antisemitism\" fabricates a spurious continuity between the two figures mentioned and is thus an odious misrepresentation of Klein's position.\n\nSince you haven't mentioned the professor's field of study, though I am sure you must know their specialized interests, I'd suggest you make sure they have access to the the current (top) journal(s) in their favorite field of study, which will help them stay abreast in the field.\n\nIf the professor's field of study is history in mathematics, or they simply stay finely attuned to the subject, e.g., may I suggest keeping the professor supplied with recent copies of the journal Historia Mathematica?\n\nAlso look into the most recent issue of BSHM Bulletin: Journal of the British Society of the History of Mathematics.\n\nHistory is also in the great original works, or in a book from the personal library of someone famous - ideally with margin side-notes in the latter case. Or all of these at once. Sometimes such books are obtainable today, for a reasonable amount of money. Not too long ago I saw a signed copy of a math book from the library of Fields Medalist Lars Ahlfors come up in a search engine. Since buying a book that would appeal to the professional interest of such a person as you describe is inherently difficult, you might do better in seeking something to be surely treasured.\n\nJeremy Gray's \"Plato's Ghost: The Modernist Transformation of Mathematics\" tells the story of how mathematics became modern during several decades before and after 1900. Worth reading to understand how mathematics got to be so far from common intuition.\n\nAmir Alexander's \"Infinitesimal: How a Dangerous Mathematical Theory Shaped the Modern World\" is a cultural fresco of the 17th century, the one when Europe became modern, the one that ends with the birth of real analysis as conceiver by Newton and Leibniz.\n\nNot mathematics, but very close: Arthur Miller's (not that one!) \"Albert Einstein’s Special Theory of Relativity: Emergence (1905) and Early Interpretation (1905–1911)\". A deeply intellectual book, not content with the just the physical theory but also presenting the general cultural context in pre-war Vienna.\n\nNumber Theory: An approach through history from Hammurapi to Legendre by Andre Weil is a classic. In it Weil covers some thirty-six centuries of arithmetical progress, with a close account of the founding fathers of modern number theory: Fermat, Euler, Lagrange and Legendre.\n\nThe Shaping of Arithmetic after C.F. Gauss's Disquisitiones Arithmeticae edited by Catherine Goldstein, Norbert Schappacher, Joachim Schwermer. In this book eighteen authors - mathematicians, historians, philosophers - discuss the impact C.F. Gauss's Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (1801) has had on mathematics.\n\nFrom Kant to Hilbert: A Source Book in the Foundations of Mathematics Volume I and Volume II by William Bragg Ewald. An historical overview starting from Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, widely taken to be the starting point of the modern mathematics, up to the end of the nineteenth century with Hilbert. Ewald's two-volumes contain translations of works by Bolzano, Cantor, Dedekind, Gauss, Hamilton, Kronecker, Riemann, Poincare, and Zermelo showing the links between algebra, geometry, number theory, analysis, logic, and set theory.\n\nGeometry by Its History by Alexander Ostermann and Gerhard Wanner. This is an undergraduate book, but that's not the point: it's one of the most beautiful historical books on geometry out there.\n\nThe Emergence of the American Mathematical Research Community, 1876-1900: J. J. Sylvester, Felix Klein, and E. H. Moore by Karen Hunger Parshall and David E. Rowe. In this book we see what the title suggests: Sylvester at John Hopkins, Moore at the University of Chicago, with Klein popping over to tour the mathematical scene.\n\nThe Mathematics of Plato's Academy: A New Reconstruction by David H. Fowler. In this book Fowler examines what we really know of the mathematics done in Plato's Academy, and before Euclid: not much! A brilliant book written by a classicist for fans of Euclid.\n\nGet well soon."
