        "text": "Let us try to promote some physics history in this sub. What are some anecdotes in the history of physics that you want to share? Be it a true story or a popular myth.\n\nI'll start:\n\nI recently tried to check if the story of Schrödinger's equation was true: Schrödinger going out for the holidays with a mistress and coming back with the wave formulation of quantum mechanics. The story was totally confirmed in his biography Schrödinger, Life and Thought by Walter John Moore. It was during Christmas, and he left with wife, and went to a ski resort with an anonymous Viennese girl.\n\nHe had tried to get a relativistic wave equation but it did not work, he went to resort to work out on the problem. It seems that he was having trouble with the radial equation. Nevertheless after coming back he worked on the article that lead to the famous equation (without thanking his muse). When his friend asked if he enjoyed holidays, Schrödinger said that he was distracted with work.\n\nThe thing that people often do not know is that Schrödinger had multiple partners (he had an open relation, he was a swinger, and that included unusual agreements with his wife). It is a dark story in many ways because some of his partners were underage, that's why some universities are renaming halls and rooms named after Schrödinger to something else. The thing is that the biographer tried to check on the whereabout of all of Schrödinger's girlfriends of that time but he was never able to figure out who traveled with him. We know that he was in the ski resort because he wrote many letters to talk about his results, but when trying to confirm the hotel registry, his name never appears for that specific year (only for the year before with his wife). His notebooks and diary from that time also disappeared. Schrödinger also never said much about it in his autobiographical notes.\n\nIt seems that such a mysterious equation deserved such a mysterious origin story.\n\nOn Heisenberg's ping pong:\n\nI healed slowly. In the end I healed and barely able to walk, I did not go back to Munich. I did not like the Herr- Herr Geheimrat. Anyway, he was on a trip around the world. I went where I belonged, to Leipzig where there was a professor only a few years older than I - I don't know, I think maybe six years older than I - by the name of Werner Heisenberg, a very wonderful man. And it was obvious that he liked me. He liked me, perhaps when he asked me what I have read; I told him the various works, including my study in Group Theory, which he appreciated. I am pretty much convinced that in part he liked me because of two somewhat strange circumstances. I hardly could walk and I beat him in ping-pong. In fact, we had the ping-pong evenings on Tuesday, I was the only one who beat him in ping-pong. I might tell you that my glory was great but not permanent. Next year, Heisenberg went around the world in the ship, really practiced up on ping-pong and after that I could not beat him.\n\n– Edward Teller\n\nThen about 9:00 the theoreticians, just the Heisenberg group, came back to the Institute. I don’t think Hund ever took part in the ping pong playing. I don’t remember him in any case, but I think all the younger people did. A matrix was drawn on the blackboard on which all the results of the different pairings were to be written down. One tried to fill the matrix completely in one evening, which was not always possible. There were some particular games played when there were discussions because there were more people there than could play ping pong at one time.\n\nThere were two tables in two separate rooms, but there might have been at least eight people, perhaps even sixteen, so the majority couldn’t play ping pong. Again tea was made, chess was played at times, and discussions were going on. The discussions were finally decided by a game of ping pong if they couldn’t be decided otherwise. This was very good for Heisenberg because he was not only the best physicist, but he was also the best ping pong player. So there was never any hope of getting the better of Heisenberg! And this is typical of Heisenberg — this is something I had not seen myself but it had happened when I arrived in Leipzig. Before 1929 Heisenberg was not the best ping pong player. Then he went on his trip around the world and he returned being the best player in the seminar, because during the time he spent on boats across the Atlantic and the Pacific he had tried very hard to learn ping pong very well. I think Heisenberg never could stand to do anything which people near to him knew better than he, so he somehow liked to be the best ping pong player.\n\n- Carl Weizsäcker\n\nI guess opponents couldn't observe the position and momentum of the ball at the same time.\n\nHeisenberg AIP Archives\n\nOwen Chamberlain won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1959 as co-discoverer of the antiproton. He also taught a large undergraduate class in 1976, a classical EM class for scientists and engineers. He was a good teacher, tall, steady, good blackboard diagrams and explanations, and, looking back, I was very fortunate to have had such a scholar as a teacher which I did not realize at the time. Don't think Nobel Prize winners teach undergraduate classes anymore.\n\nHe himself was the volunteer one day in class, when he demonstrated the Van de Graaff electrostatic generator. What I remember now is what looked to be about a foot-thick block of glass or plastic, the insulator he used to stand on! He was balding with stringy, kinda long hair, put both palms flat down on the sphere, said he felt his skin tingling, and his hair all stood up on end! Remember also thinking that I would not volunteer for that experiment. It was quite impressive. He was very excited with it all too.\n\nOne other teacher, Paul Witherspoon, also very well known in mineral engineering and geophysics, taught \"Fluid Flow in Porous Media\". He also drew good blackboard diagrams with full, clear explanations. He told us a story that, when he was young, in Oklahoma or some midwest state, I forget now, he was in a geologic area that had natural methane venting from the ground. I forget whether he said he flicked a cigarette or a match, something flammable, into a recess, and he ignited a whole lot of methane that in there or was then actively venting. Said it was like a blasthole explosion straight up. Right next to him! I remember his scary anecdote.\n\nrobphy said:\n\nFrom my post https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/chen-ning-yang-is-almost-100-years-old.1045788/\n\n* http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/951012/chandra.shtml\n\n\"One story in particular illustrates Chandrasekhar's devotion to his science and his students. In the 1940s, while he was based at the University's Yerkes Observatory in Williams Bay, Wis., he drove more than 100 miles round-trip each week to teach a class of just two registered students. Any concern about the cost-effectiveness of such a commitment was erased in 1957, when the entire class -- T.D. Lee and C.N. Yang -- won the Nobel Prize in physics.\"\n\nFrom \"A Scientific Autobiography: S. Chandrasekhar\" (edited by K. Wali), p.22\n\nAfter Radiative Transfer was finished in September 1948, we left for a short vacation in Bayfield; and while there, I decided that Fall 1948 I would embark on turbulence: since turbulence is a phenomenon of the large scale and the essence of astrophysical and, indeed, also of geophysical phenomena is the scale.\n\nAnd so, on our return from Bayfield, I started my Monday evening seminars. The first audience included: Munch, Osterbrock, Edmonds, Huang, Brown and Code. At the same time, I lectured on Radiative Transfer on the campus. My class of two consisted only of Lee and Yang. The whole of my class of 1948 was to receive the Nobel Prize!\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subrahmanyan_Chandrasekhar won the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physics\n\nand passed away in 1995.\n\nBy the way, as of today,\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsung-Dao_Lee is 97\n\nand https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Chen-Ning is 101.\n\nThey won the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics when they were in their thirties.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates_in_Physics\n\nThe laureates from the 1960s and all others from the 1950s have all passed.\n\nThus, there are still laureates from the 1970s and later, and Lee and Yang from 1957.On a personal note,\n\nI got my undergrad degree from Stony Brook... but I never met Yang... although I saw him when he gave talks.\n\nI got my master's degree from Chicago... but I never met Chandrasehkar.. although I saw him when he gave talks... and I found his wallet on the floor in the stacks at the Eckhart Math Library and turned it in to the library staff.\n\nwalkeraj said:\n\nCrossed with today I learned, but the path integral is the thought and mind of Norbert Weiner, originally. Fully worked out by Dr. Feynman.\n\nI did not know this! Wiener should definitely get more credit in physics circles. That reminds me of this anecdote:\n\nWiener was in fact very absent minded. The following story is told about him:\n\nWhen they moved from Cambridge to Newton his wife, knowing that he would be absolutely useless on the move, packed him off to MIT while she directed the move. Since she was certain that he would forget that they had moved and where they had moved to, she wrote down the new address on a piece of paper, and gave it to him. Naturally, in the course of the day, an insight occurred to him. He reached in his pocket, found a piece of paper on which he furiously scribbled some notes, thought it over, decided there was a fallacy in his idea, and threw the piece of paper away. At the end of the day he went home (to the old address in Cambridge, of course). When he got there he realized that they had moved, that he had no idea where they had moved to, and that the piece of paper with the address was long gone. Fortunately inspiration struck. There was a young girl on the street and he conceived the idea of asking her where he had moved to, saying, “Excuse me, perhaps you know me. I’m Norbert Weiner and we’ve just moved. Would you know where we’ve moved to?” To which the young girl replied, “Yes daddy, mommy thought you would forget.”\n\n–By computer scientist Richard Harter\n\nEdit: my bad this was already posted in #3 by @fresh_42!"
