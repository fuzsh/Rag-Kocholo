He was born in New York on October 14, 1988. He was raised in Haiti for his primary years. At the age of 5, he began to experience Angelic visitations.\n\nHe returned to the states at the age of 13 due to political reasons in Haiti. He completed his middle and high school requirements and graduated with a diploma. He was an avid basketball star in high school and was beginning his career until God began to speak to him concerning the calling upon his life. He rededicated his life back to Christ and turned back to him.\n\nHe served under a Man of God for 3 years, where he advanced in knowledge of the word. He led the intercessory prayers and was one of the praise and worship leaders. This grew more character and humility within him. “This made me humble. I appreciated the anointing that was upon his life.”\n\n\"I thank God for the man of God that I served under. The gifts that were imparted inside of me helped me in ministry today.\"\n\n-Prophet Kervin Dieudonne\n\nThe Lord began to visit him in dreams and visions about starting his own ministry in Fort Lauderdale.

The power in his messages change many people's lives .\n\n“I would spend hours in prayer seeking the presence of the Lord, fasting and crying to the Lord. I began to get angelic visitation and open heaven visions from the Lord . One night as I was sleeping I saw that I was in a place of dry bones and I heard the Lord say \"Son of Man, prophesy over these dry bones\" As I did it, I saw the bones come back to life .The Lord's commission for my life is to bring Restoration and Life to the body of Christ.\n\n\"God would show me dreams of me walking with the youth and adults from every nation. Setting the captives free from the oppression of the kingdom of darkness in the form of trials, tribulations, sickness, possession and many other things. That's why we are a ministry of Restoration and Life, to set the captives free.”\n\nProphet Kervin Dieudonne is married to the lovely Prophetess Melissa C.
