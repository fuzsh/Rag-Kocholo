        "text": "The first things you notice about Jean-Pascal Zadi are his smiling and deceptively candid eyes. Two mocking marbles the actor and director uses to probe the world in general and France in particular. Two magnifying glasses deconstructing and observing those who look at him and judge only by appearances, like his singular face and skin color. Two piercing eyes society can use as mirrors while laughing. Two mischievous eyes spying prejudices and blemishes while splitting our sides. One of the elementary principles of comedy is to turn decidedly unfunny subjects into humor.\n\nZadi also stands out because of his incredible height (1.93 meters), a stretch that is not easy to live with when you're not named Michael Jordan, Paul Pogba, or Charles de Gaulle, particularly if you imagine yourself following in de Gaulle's footsteps and becoming president. This is precisely what happens to his character in En Place (Represent), which was released on Netflix on January 20. In this series he co-directed with François Uzan, Zadi plays a social worker from the Paris suburbs who does not feel any of the candidates represent him. He decides to campaign for the Elysée and finds himself confronted with the harshness and hypocrisy of politics.\n\nSome claim the actor's signature feature is his bad teeth, arguing that, like Samson's hair, the source of his power lies in this oral disorder. Gnashers \"that look like sugar cubes,\" according to the words used by the comedian Claudia Tagbo to describe him in Tout Simplement Noir (Simply Black), the 2020 film whose success (nearly 800,000 tickets sold) propelled the owner of these prominent chompers to the center stage. Yet this fake documentary filled with self-mockery where every actor, most of them of African or Caribbean origin, play and caricature themselves, had an extremely serious subject matter: Life in France as a Black person. It earned Zadi French cinema award César for best male hope in 2021.\n\n'Too tall, too black, too many teeth... My difference has become my strength.' Jean-Pascal Zadi\n\nUsing this \"atypical\" physique, as casting agencies would say, Zadi has managed to make it his secret weapon. He accepted his choice or destiny for comedy during his teenage years. \"As a kid, my goal in life was to be like other people,\" he explained. \"But I was tall, I was Black and I had protruding teeth. Nothing about me was like other people. I was insecure. When I got to middle school and realized all I had to do to be accepted was make the girls laugh a little, I told myself, 'Okay, since my face isn't crazy good looking, I'll make them smile.'\" Zadi insists and self-flagellates: \"Too big, too Black, too many teeth.\""
