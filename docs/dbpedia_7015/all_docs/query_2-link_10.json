        "text": "PARIS\n\nTHE stand-up comedian and actor Dieudonné used to draw thousands of ecstatic fans to his shows. Famous for his portrayal of an imposing, slightly boorish West African immigrant who spoke an old-fashioned, lilting French while gently mocking a shorter, agitated pal, he has played roles as varied as a nostalgic Vichy-era collaborator, a corrupt garage owner and a gay butcher.\n\nBut Dieudonné’s career has gone off the rails. After lashing out at Jews, playing down the importance of the Holocaust in shows and interviews, and becoming politically active in the name of what he calls anti-Zionism, he has become a pariah in France. Today he struggles to sell tickets to his stand-up appearances — held in cramped theaters, on a makeshift stage opposite a farm and even on a bus — and has broken off with the Jewish comic Élie Sémoun, who played his pal in a popular comedy team. Yet there was Dieudonné in the spotlight last month, his humor the focus of headlines worldwide when a screening of his directorial debut, “L’Antisémite” (“The Anti-Semite”), was canceled at the Marché du Film, the market held at the Cannes Film Festival. (There are no plans to release it in France or the United States.) Just weeks earlier four performances he was scheduled to give in Montreal were called off after Jewish groups protested.\n\n“There are official versions of history which are indisputable in France,” Dieudonné told a young, mostly male audience in his last show here, “Rendez-nous Jésus,” or “Give Us Jesus Back.” “Take the gas chambers. Is someone going to ask, ‘Can we see the plans?’ ”\n\nDieudonné (pronounced DYUH-do-NAY), 47, argues that he is playing a vital role in a complacent and racist French society. “I’ve been able to laugh at everything except Jews,” he said in an interview this month. “I realized that it was forbidden to laugh about them.”"
