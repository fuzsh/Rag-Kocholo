William More Gabb, (20 Jan. - Philadelphia) 1839-1878 (30 May - Philadelphia), US invertebrate palaeontologist in Philadelphia, working on Cretaceous and Tertiary fossils, i.a. molluscs [Callistochiton gabbi H. A. Pilsbry, 1893, Gabbia Tryon, 1865, Crepitacella gabbi (Dall, 1889), Glyphostoma gabbii Dall, 1889, Strigella gabbi Olsson & McGinty, 1958, Turbonilla gabbiana Cooper, 1870, Penitella gabbi (Tryon, 1863)]. (Stefano Palazzi kindly added some of this information).

The gastropod names Conus gabelishi da Motta & Ninomiya, 1982 and Amalda (Exiquaspira) gabelishi Ninomiya, 1988 were named for Mr.Anthony (Tony) J. Gabelish, (Perth) 1931-, (discoverer of the holotype of the first species) who has been an important local shell dealer in the Perth area, Western Australia. For about 15 years he was the one bringing most Zoila and W. Australian Volutes to the market. He encouraged divers to explore new areas. Stopped activities in conchology about five years ago. Before turning into conchology he was educated as a engine specialist in the Australian navy. (Guido Poppe kindly provided this information May 2000 and Dr. Eugene V. Coan later kindly provided the date).

The nudibranch name Piseinotecus gabinieri Vicente, 1975 is not in honour of a person, but was first detected at the Gabiniere islet at Cote d'Azur and the author forgot the ending e in the name of the islet when turning it into a species name.

Mr. Charles John Gabriel, (28 May - Collingwood, Melbourne) 1879-1963 (19 June - at his Toorak home), malacologist from Victoria, Australia, cooperating and publishing together with John Gatliff (q.v.) as long as Gatliff lived. [Gabrielona Iredale, 1917, Acanthochiton gabrieli Ashby, 1922, Subterenochiton gabrieli Hull, 1912]. {Picture / Picture 2 / courtesy of R. Giannuzzi- Savelli}.

The cowry name Cypraeovula coronata gabriellii is in honour of Ludwig Gabrielli, (likely before 1930, because he has a daughter born in 1952) 19??-, of Neuss, Nordrhein-Westfalen, collector and expert of cowries.

Henri Gadeau de Kerville, (17 Dec. - Rouen) 1858-1940 (26 July - Bagnères-de-Luchon) , French naturalist, archaeologist and traveller from Normandy, who published on a diversity of organism groups (but mainly known as an entomologist), i.a. the marine fauna of Normandy. He also travelled and collected in Asia Minor [Schistomysis kervillei (G.O. Sars, 1885), Lohmannella kervillei (Trouessart, 1894), Parametopa kervillei Chevreux, 1901, Asterocheres kervillei Canu, 1898].

Gaetano : (see Chierchia).

The Russian parasitologist Prof. Dr. Albina Vitol'dovna Gaevskaya, 1937-, worked at the Atlantic Research Institute of Fishery and Oceanography, Kaliningrad, in the 1980's, but later moved to the Institute of Biology of the Southern Seas, Sevastopol, Ukraine. She is interested in taxonomy, biology and ecology of parasites and is doing faunistic research of different systematic groups parasites, especially the role and place of parasites in marine ecosystems and parasitological aspects of mariculture and fisheries, currently interested in the role of parasites in biodiversity of marine communitie [Gaevskajatrema Gibson & Bray, 1982, Adinosoma gaevskaye Zubchenko, 1978, Clavogalea gaevskayae Bray, 1985, Opechona gaevskayae Ahmad, 1991, Lepidapedon gaevskayae Campbell & Bray, 1993, Tubulovesicula alviga Aljoshkina, 1983, Lepidapedon alvigae Tkachuk, 2002 (all trematodes), Glossobius albinae Kononenko 1986 (isopod), Schulmania albinae Kovaljova, Zubtchenko & Krasin, 1983, Myxobolus alvigae Ermolenko, 1989 (both myxosporea), Gyrodactylus alviga Dmitrieva et Gerasev, 2000 (monogenea - alviga after the first 2 letters in each of her 3 names)]. (Andrew Vik, Tampa Florida kindly provided part of this information, like Prof. Gaevskaya herself, who has been much helpful in providing much information about especially Russian and Ukrainian parasitologists in these lists).

The polychaete name Ampharete gagarae Ushakov, 1950 is likely not honouring a person's name, but was found by R/V Gagara, in 1932-35 making a Pacific expedition.

Prof. Dr. John David Gage, (14 Nov. - Salisbury, Wiltshire) 1939-2005 (18 July (by cancer)), British deep water fauna researcher, especially interested in echinoderms and bivalves, who collected a large material of gastropods from the Rockall Trough with R.V. Challenger II is honoured in the gastropod names Metzgeria gagei Bouchet & Warén, 1985 and Melanella gagei Bouchet & Warén, 1986 [Xylophaga gagei Harvey, 1996, Claviderma gagei Ivanov & Scheltema, 2001]. He retired in 2004. The tunicate name Styela gagetyleri Young & Vazquez, 1997 from the Arabian Sea is honouring the same person together with Prof. Paul A. Tyler, 1946-, Southampton Oceanography Centre, because they have published several papers together [Ophiactis tyleri Stöhr & Segonzac, 2005]. A namesake to the latter is the US marine scientist Prof. Seth Tyler, 19??-, of Maine (PhD at the Univ. of North Carolina in 1975), who is working on meiofauna.

Mrs. Angelina Pastorello Gaglini, (19 May - Bologna) 1943-1994 (27 July - Roma), well renowned Italian malacologist [Turbonilla angelinagagliniae Schander 1996, Alvania gagliniae Amati, 1985]. {Picture / courtesy of R. Giannuzzi- Savelli}.

Lacking information about Gah in the Patagonian cephalopod name Loligo gahi d'Orbigny, 1835.

The French malacologist Jean Maurice Gaillard, 19??-, is not the person honoured in the stomatopod name Clorida gaillardi Moosa, 1985 and in the anomuran name Pomatocheles gaillardi Forest, 1987, but the French illustrator Maurice Gaillard, 19??-200?, who has made a lot of the crustacean drawings in the crustaceans department of the MNHN, Paris (named the late by Ngoc-Ho in 2009) (Dr. Métivier at the MNHN, Paris, kindly informed about the connection between names and person).

Dr. Joseph Arnaud Charles Gaillardot, (20 Sep. - Lunéville) 1814-1883 (near Beirut), French surgeon in chief at Alexandria Hospital (Egypt) [Gaillardotia Bourguignat, 1877, Pollia gaillardoti (Puton, 1853), Cyclostoma gaillardotii Bourguignat, 1855, Daudebardia gaillardotii Bourguignat, 1855, Bithinia gaillardotii Bourguignat, 1856].

François Benjamin Gaillion, (2 June - Rouen) 1782-1839 (4 Jan. - Boulogne-sur-Mer), French cryptogamic botanist.

Dr. Joseph Paul Gaimard, (31 Jan. - Saint Zacharie, Var) 1793-1858 (10 Dec. - Paris), French naval surgeon and naturalist, who also travelled in eastern Europe in 1831-32 to study Cholera, but later again took up natural history collections in the North Atlantic. He died in economic poverty. [Eualus gaimardii (H. Milne Edwards, 1837), Byblis gaimardii (Krøyer, 1846), Chiton gaimardi Blainville, Asterorotalia gaimardi (d'Orbigny, 1826), Tornatina gaimardi Finlay, 1927, Calcinus gaimardii (H. Milne Edwards, 1848), Montipora gaimardi Bernard, 1897, Paracentrotus gaimardii (Blav., 1825) Mortensen, 1903, Spirobranchus gaymardi (Quatrefages, 1866), Sycozoa gaimardi (Herdman, 1886), Paragrapsus gaimardii ], who travelled a lot; together with the surgeon and naturalist Dr. Jean René Constant Quoy, (10 Nov. - Maillé, Vendée) 1790-1869 (4 July - Rochefort), who belonged to a family of many surgeons (10 in the 3 generations before him of which one was his own grandmother!). Despite uncertain health during his last years Quoy remained a relentless worker, a talented artist (and a very good observer and collector), loyal to his zoological interests, modest and a stranger of vanity and intrigues [Quoyia Gray, 1839 (there is also a homonym Quoya Labbé, 1934), Quoyula Iredale, 1912, Terebra quoygaimardi Cernohorsky, 1976, Pilumnus quoyi H. Milne-Edwards, 1834, Ischnochiton quoyanus J. Thiele, 1910, Perotrochus quoyanus (Fischer & Bernardi, 1856), Atlanta quoyii Gray, 1850, Quibulla quoyi (Gray, 1843), Paratrophon quoyi L. A. Reeve, 1846, Heterodontus quoyi Freminville, 1840, Chiton quoyi Deshayes, Sphaeroma quoyanum H. Milne Edwards, 1840], on "l'Astrolabe" (1826 -29) in the Pacific Ocean, on "La Recherche" (1835-36) to the Arctic Sea, and the circumnavigation with "L'Uranie" and "La Physicienne" (1817-1820) (see Gaudichaud-Beaupré). Gaimard also was the scientific leader of "La Recherche" on it's trip to Spitsbergen in 1838, in which i.a. Krøyer (q.v.) took part, but their personalities were not much compatible - Gaimard being characterized by Krøyer as lacking energy and understanding and in general being immature.

The asteroid name Lophaster gaini Koehler, 1912 and the octocoral name Leptogorgia gaini Stiasny, 1940, are very likely tributes to Louis Gain, (Mortain dans la Manche) 1883-1963 (31 Jan. - Dreux), French algologist and naturalist (also climatologist) at the Museum d'histoire naturelle publishing about Antarctic algae flora. He was responsible for preserving specimens of the Deuxième Expédition Antarctique Française (1908-1910) with Pourquoi pas? and Clément Vaney (q.v.) became so happy with the results (compared to the more or less destroyed sea cucumbers of the first Expédition Antarctique Française (1903-1905) - due to fixation in acidic formalin), that he described Psolidium gaini Vaney, 1914 after him [Branchinecta gaini Daday de Dees, 1910]. Together with his brother Dr. Gustave Gain, (Cherbourg) 1876-1945 (Paris), a famous photographer, he also made a collection trip to Russian Turkestan in 1914 and Gustave's son André Alfred Louis Gain, (30 Jan.) 1907-1940 (28 May), in 1936 made a collection trip to French Polynesia. The octocoral name above may possibly be a tribute to André Gain instead of his uncle.

The fish name Salmo gairdnerii J. Richardson, 1836 (also known as Oncorhynchus mykiss - the species named after a Siberian word for the species) is honouring the Edinburgh physician in Fort Vancouver Dr. Meredith Gairdner, (27 Nov. - London) 1809-1837 (26 Mar. - of tuberculosis in Honolulu), who sent samples of his natural history findings to Sir John Richardson.

Lacking information about Gajevski / Gajewski in the nematod name Araeolaimus gajevskii Paramonov, 1929.

Melanodrymia galeronae Warén & Bouchet, 2001 was named for Joëlle Galéron, 1953-, at IFREMER, who sorts material. Possibly Apseudes galeroni Bacescu, 1987 may be named for the same person?

Lacking information about Galina in the isopod name Lironeca galinae Kononenko, 1989.

Jules Galland, 18??-1???, French zoologist and engineer in chief of "Ponts et Chaussées" of Ottoman Empire [Gallandia Bourguignat, 1880, also several non marine species was named after him by Bourguignat].

The tanaid names Leptognathia gallardoi Shiino, 1971 and Apseudes gallardoi Shino, 1963 may possibly honour Prof. Dr. José María Alfonso Félix Gallardo, 1925-1992, Profesor de la Universidad de Buenos Aires y Director del Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales "Bernardino Rivadavia". He published on amphibians and reptiles and is probably related to his forerunner at this museum, Dr. Angel Gallardo, 1867-1934.

(Prof. Jean-Lou Justine, Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris, kindly provided some of this information).

The Guernsey collector M. J. P. Gallienne in the holothuroid name Leptosynapta galliennii (Herapath, 1865) can because of the initials (if not the P is an error for the somewhat similarily sounding T, because the first M. is likely Monsieur) likely not be the British naturalist / malacologist John Taylor Gallienne, 1814-1868, who lived at Guernsey, at least during his last decades, but if not a letter confusion, possibly one of his relatives; one of his sons was John Matthew Gallienne, born 2 June 1846, so his initials are also wrong.

The US palaeontologist Prof. Dr. Jesse James Galloway, (23 Aug. - a farm, near Cromwell, Indiana) 1882-1962 (10 Apr. - Bloomington, Indiana), of Indiana Univ., published on foraminiferans between 1928-41 [Astrononion gallowayi Loeblich & Tappan, 1953]. He was also a very good chess player.

Galton : (see Darwin).

Dr. Paul Simon Galtsoff, (Moscow, Russia) 1887-1979, Russian-US shellfish biologist, who in 1921 had escaped from the revolution to USA. Initially he had difficulties in finding a marine biological work, but from 1923 the former director of the marine biological station in Sevastopol (from 1914 on) was offered a job at the Bureau of Fisheries' laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. He retired officialy in 1957, but continued in the activities at Woods Hole until he passed away.

The mystacocarid name Derocheilocaris galvarini Dahl, 1952, from Chile, is likely not directly honouring a person's name, but was likely found by the Chilean R/V Galvarino (together with R/V Arauco II used by the Lund Univ. Chile expedition) or possibly found in the vicinity of the town Galvarino, both named for the famous Mapuche warrior Galvarino, 15??-1557 (30 Nov.).

The cumacean name Leptostylis gamoi Reyss, 1972 must be a tribute to the Japanese researcher Prof. Dr. Sigeo Gamô, (17 June) 1928-2008 (9 Apr.), of the Yokohama National Univ.

Tomo Gamulin, (28 Apr. - Jelsa, Island Hvar) 1906-1991 (4 June - Dubrovnik), plankton researcher and fisheries biologist, who was the director of the Marine Research Station, Rovinj, but between 1960-63. Dr. Helena Gamulin-Brida, (6 Mar.) 1910-1989 (4 July), (working in Zagreb and Split, Croatia), well-known mainly for her book of 1974 "Biocoenoses benthiques de la mer Adriatique", dedicated that book "A la mémoire de mon mari iro ĆGamulin" - so that apparently we have at least three of that family (including Prof. Ćiro Gamulin) [Sphaeronectes gamulini Carré, 1966]. (Stefano Palazzi kindly added the information about the last two persons of the family).

Lacking information about Ganapati in the dicyemid name Dicyema ganapatii Kalavati, Narasimhamurti & Suseela, 1984, but possibly a tribute to Prof. P.N. Ganapati, 19??-1984,of Andhra Univ.?

The collector H. Garcia in the Easter Island decapod name Pylopaguropsis garciai McLaughlin & Haig, 1989 must be Henri Garcia, 19??-, from southern France, who together with his younger brother Michel in 1980 founded the Orca Diving Center in the Easter Island, where Henri in 1976 had arrived as a diver for Cousteau's scientific Expedition and his brother arrived in 1978.

The ciliate name Bursella gargamellae Fauré-Fremiet, 1922 is likely a name of a species found on the dorid genus Gargamella Bergh, 1894, first described from South America, but Bergh's name does probably not honour a person's mame, because it is likely referring to Gargamelle, the giantess, who was mother of Gargantua in F. Rabelais' story from the 16:th century "La vie de Gargantua et de Pantagruel".

(son of a Canadian father and a Belgian mother)) 1823-1887 (11 Jan. - Huahine (not far from Tahiti)), early U.S. amateur naturalist of Polynesia, who collected i.a. molluscs, sending much material to museums in both USA and Europe (Britain and Germany) and published some papers during the 1870s. He had been fascinated by Hawaii, where he first arrived on a whaler and decided to live there, but later moving around much among different Pacific Islands, including Fiji, Marshall Islands, Gilbert Islands, Tonga, Samoa, Cook Islands and at the end in the Society Islands, where he and his wife Otari lived, when he died. [Favartia garrettii W. H. Pease, 1868]. (Stefano Palazzi kindly added some of this information and the little, which is known about Garrett is presented by W. Stephen Thomas in Vol. 93(1) 1979 of Nautilus).

Lieut.-Commander Leroy Mason Garrett, (Beekmantown) 1857-1906 (21 Nov. - NW of Honolulu), USN, the commanding officer of the Albatross cruise 1904-05 and served as its captain from Oct. 1904. He was thrown over board in a violent storm and lost during the end of an expedition with Albatross to the Aleutian Islands, Russia and Japan when the ichthyologist C.H. Gilbert (q.v.) was naturalist in charge and e.g. A.H. Clark (q.v.) was on board as a naturalist [Antedon garrettiana Clark, 1907].

Prof. Em. Dr. John (Jack) A.F. Garrick, 19??-, (fl. 1953-99), Victoria University College (Wellington N.Z.), Department of Zoology, who i.a. has published on shark taxonomy during the 1960s-1980s, is honoured in the copepod name Aethon garriki Hewitt, 1968 [Scymnodalatias garricki Kukuyev & Konovalenko, 1988, Dipturus garricki (Bigelow & Schroeder, 1958)].

Prof. Dr. Walter Garstang, (9 Feb. - Blackburn) 1868-1949 (23 Feb.), British marine zoologist (Fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford and naturalist at Lowestoft for the Marine Biological Association), but mainly the first Buckland Professor of Fish Culture at the Univ. of Leeds (from 1907-33) & biological poet, but his "Larval Forms and Other Biological Verses" including his famous Ballad of the Veliger or How the Gastropod got its twist, beginning this way: "The Veliger's a lively tar, the liveliest afloat, A whirling wheel on either side propels his little boat. But when the danger signal warns his bustling submarine, He stops the engine, shuts the port, and drops below unseen." was published posthumously two years after his death He had planned to study medicine in Oxford, but influenced by Mosely (q.v.), he changed to zoology and was offered a position as secretary and assistant of Bourne (q.v.) in Plymouth, where he was much influenced by Lancester (q.v.) and later formulated the so called Garstang's Theory, that Chordates and Echinoderms are closely related and that Chordates may have evolved from Echinoderms. [Ecteinascidia garstangi Sluiter, 1898, Distaplia garstangi Berrill, 1947, Portumnoides garstangi Bohn, 1905, Enoploplastron garstangi van Hoven, 2007 (not marine)].

John Shrader Garth, (3 Oct. - Los Angeles) 1909-1993 (18 Oct.), US crab (and butterfly) specialist. He actually started his career as a musician, but following as such on one of Alan Hancock's (q.v.) expeditions with one of Hancock's Velero yachts - (Hancock actually hired musicians for the cruises), Garth became so impressed with life in the sea, so he changed direction and became a zoologist instead. [Periclimenaeus garthi A.J. Bruce, 1976, Garthambrus Ng, 1996, Callichirus garthi (Retamal, 1975), Callionymus garthi Seale, 1940]. (Leslie Harris, Los Angeles, kindly informed about how Garth's arrived in the zoological business).

The hydroid genus Garveia Wright, 1859 is not named for a person's name, but is derived from the type locality "Inch Garvie" in the Firth of Forth.

The gastropod name Hypselodoris gasconi Ortea Valdés & Garcia-Gomez, 1996 is not likely honouring a person's name, but named for the province Gascon or Gascogne = Gascony in SW France, historically inhabited by Basque related people.

Roger Gaskell, (2 June - Liverpool (Lancs.)) 1846-1912, Esq., M.A. of Highgate, Middlesex, UK, barrister, conveyancer, botanist and shell collector [Pisania gaskelli Melvill, 1891]. Dr. Walter Holbrook Gaskell, (1 Nov. - Napoli, Italy) 1847-1914, who published about the origin of vertebrates, was (like the latter's twin brother Ernest) his brother.

Dr. John Samuel Gaskoin, (around 29 Sep. - Bagshot, Surrey, England) 1790-1858 (5 Oct. - in his apartment of Clarges Street, Mayfair, London, by heart problems), English (London) surgeon (from 1823 to King George IV and later to William IV), malacologist and shell cabinet owner. He had studied in Paris between 1816-18, but then returned to London. He was married to Mary Hancock, who died in 1837 and had 3 sons and 1 daughter, became a FLS in June 1853 [Cribrarula gaskoinii (Reeve, 1846), Anachis gaskoini Carpenter, 1857].

Mme Marie Marthe Camille Desinge du Gast, (30 May - Paris) 1868-1942 (24 Aor. - Paris), was leader of the scientific expedition to Morocco, which collected the type species of the decapod genus Dugastella Bouvier, 1912. She was from 1890 married to the Paris merchant Jules Crespin, who was in charge of the warehose Dufayel in Paris, but used her maiden name when this "Valkyrie mechanics" took part in ballooning adventures, motor engine races or climbed among mountain tops. [Balssia gasti (Balss, 1921), Thalamophyllus gasti (Döderlein, 1913)].

Jerry M. Gathof, 19??-, Naval Oceanographic Office, in the polychaete name Arichlidon gathofi Watson Russell, 2000, "studied chrysopetalid material from the Gulf of Mexico and recognized "Paleanotus sp. A" (Gathof, 1984) as belonging to a new species"

Prof. Dr. Joseph M. Gathuma , 19??-, of the Univ. of Nairobi, is honoured in the nematode name Acantholaimus gathumai Muthumbi & Vincx, 1997.

Mr. John Henry Gatliff, (17 May - Leeds, Yorkshire, England) 1848-1935 (14 Sep. - South Yarra), of Melbourne, collected the species Voluta gatliffi G.B. Sowerby, 1910. He published i.a. on Victorian molluscs. His parents had emigrated to Geelong, Victoria in 1857 and John continued in his father's footsteps (he was a broker) and became a bank employee, with more and more responsibility, but became also early interested in shells. [Crossea gatliffi Hedley, 1902, Acanthochitona gatliffa E. Ashby, 1919, Callistochiton gatliffi Ashby]. {Picture / courtesy of R. Giannuzzi- Savelli}.

Gérard Gattegno, 19??-, French malacological collector who buildt one of the major collections in Europe. [Stomatella gattegnoi Poppe, Tagaro & Dekker, 2006]. (G. Poppe kindly provided this information).

Gatty Marine Laboratory, Univ. of St. Andrews, Scotland, was named for the landowner, zoologist and meterologist Charles Henry Gatty, (6 Mar.) 1836-1903 (12 Dec.), who in 1894 donated £2,500 for the rebuilding in stone of the 1884 inaugurated, but ten years later burnt down marine laboratory, which until 1884 was lodged in a wooden shed. This laboratory on the east coast of Scotland, with one single factotum employé, the ex-fisherman, who by McIntosh's students was called "Professor" Brown , was also used by guest researchers like Lankester, Bourne, Hubrecht, Nansen etcetera. Gatty, who was a Fellow in several learned Societies (Linnean, Zoological, Geological & Ray), met M'Intosh in 1865 at the British Museum [Gattyana M'Intosh, 1897]. The new laboratory was finished in 1896, simultaneously with the Millport laboratory on the west coast, initiated by John Murray, 1841-1914. He was likely not related (at least not closely) to the Yorkshire children's book writer and algologist Margaret Gatty (née Scott), (Burnham, Essex) 1809-1873 (4 Oct. - Ecclesfield Vicarage), (and her husband from 1839 the Rev. Alfred Gatty, (18 Apr. - London) 1813-1903 (20 Jan. Ecclesfield Vicarage), of Ecclesfield Vicarage), who in 1863 published "British Seaweeds" [Gattya Harvey, Gattia Johnston, Puellina gattyae (Landsborough, 1852)].

The first collector (at Pas de Calais) Herb. E. Gaudefroy, (but the Herb. likely stands for Herbarium insted of a first name like Herbert, so his initial was likely E. and that implies that this person very likely was Eugène Gaudefroy, 1827-1882, a Bretagne collector) in the fungus name Pleospora gaudefroyi Patouillard, 1886, now transferred to Decorospora Inderbitzin, J. Kohlmeyer, B. Volkmann-Kohlmeyer & Berbee, 2002.

The volutid species Scaphella gaudiati Bail & Shelton, 2001 is named for Daniel Gaudiat, 19??-, the fisherman who collected the first specimen [One of the authors, Douglas N. Shelton , Alabama Malacological Research Center, kindly provided this information].

Prof. Charles Gaudichaud-Beaupré, (4 Sep. - Angoulème) 1789-1854 (16 Jan. - Paris), studied pharmacy and became a dispenser in the French navy in 1810. Later, he took part as a naturalist in several large expeditions, "L'Uranie" and "La Physicienne" (1817-20, circumnavigation), "L'Herminie" (1831-33, to E & W South America), and "La Bonite" (1836-37, around the world) [Gaudichaudia gaudichaudia (Milne Edwards, 1843), Sertularella gaudichaudi (Lamouroux, in de Freycinet, 1824), Hipponoe gaudichaudi Audouin & H. Milne-Edwards, 1830, Desmonema gaudichaudi (Lesson, 1830), Atlanta gaudichaudi Souleyet, 1852, Propagurus gaudichaudi (H. Milne Edwards, 1836), Ocypode gaudichaudi Milne Edwards & Lucas, 1843, Ceratothoa gaudichaudii (H. Milne Edwards, 1840)]. The first of these expeditions started from Toulon under command of Captain Louis Claude Desaules de Freycinet, (8 Aug. - Montélimar) 1779-1842 (18 Aug. - Freycinet), with the corvette "L'Uranie", which was lost at the Malvinas in 1820 [Nucella freycineti G. P. Deshayes, 1841, Hemiscyllium freycineti (Quoy & Gaimard, 1824), Meuschenia freycineti ]. However the expedition was transferred to an U.S. ship, which got the name "La Physicienne" and returned later on to France. (Freycinet had been liutenant on Baudin's Australian expedition 1800-04 and edited Baudins hydrographical data from that expedition - also his elder brother Henri-Louis had been a member of Baudin's expedition, Cape Freycinet and the Freycinet estuary beeing named after them). Assisting naturalists on the "Uranie" trip were the ship's surgeon Quoy (q.v. - under Gaimard) and Gaimard (q.v.). After the "La Bonite" expedition, Gaudichaud was appointed professor in pharmacy in Paris, being attached to the Paris Museum and worked on the botanical collections from his expeditions. He stayed in Paris until he died.

The gastropod name Cirsonella gaudryi Dautzenberg & H. Fischer, 1896 is likely honouring the French palaeontologist Albert Jean Gaudry, (16 Sep. - St- Germain-en-Laye) 1827-1908 (27 Nov. - Paris), successor of d'Orbigny (q.v.) - after first having been his assistant, at the Professor chair in Paris.

The gastropod name Conus gauguini Richard & Salvat, 1973 is named in honour of the French postimpressionistic painter Eugène Henri Paul Gauguin, (7 June - Paris) 1848-1903 (8 May - Atuona, Hiva Oa, Marquesas Islands).

The copepod name Schizopera gauldi Chappuis & Rouch, 1961 is very likely a tribute to Dr. David T. Gauld, 19??-, Univ. of Edinburgh, Univ. of Aberdeen and the Marine Biological Station at Millport, later at Univ. College, Archimota, Ghana, copepod taxonomist and ecologist.

Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss, (30 Apr. - Braunschweig) 1777-1855 (23 Feb. - Göttingen), the German mathematician and astronomer, is a well-respected name in physics. The international unit of electromagnetic flux density (gauss) is named for him. But why would his name be applied to so many marine organisms? Answer: The famous Deutsche Sudpolar Expedition (1901-1903) (q.v.) was carried out on his namesake ship "Gauss." The series of grand reports, published until 1931, revealed many new animals and plants, a number of which were given the name of the ship. One of the best examples is the large bathypelagic copepod of the genus Gaussia Wolfenden, 1905. Another one is the amphipod Mimonectes gaussi (Woltereck, 1904). (See also Gauss under Expeditions). (Dr. D. Damkaer kindly provided this information).

Henri Charles Gauthier, 1896-1950, published on the animal life of continental waters in N Africa, because he lived in Algeria and is possibly best known as an entomologist [Amphiascus gauthieri Monard, 1936].

The bryozooan names Metalcyonidium gautieri d'Hondt, 1976 Ellisina gautieri Fernandez Pulpeiro & Reverter Gil, 1993, Schizomavella gautieri Reverter Gil & Fernandez Pulpeiro, 1977 and Bugula gautieri Ryland, 1961 are likely named after Prof. Dr. Yves-Victor Gautier, (Martigues, Provence, France) 1930-97 (18 July), who started his career at Station Marine d'Endoume under Prof Peres, achieved his PhD on Mediterranean bryozooans in 1961 in Marseille, but later more or less left bryozoology and became a biology professor, first at the University of Oran (Algeria), and later at the University of Chambery (France) where he became very involved in conservation programs, so Jacques-Fabius Gautier d'Agoty, (Marseille) 1717-1785, anatomical illustrator in Paris, is a less probable candidate.

The octocoral name Sinularia gaveshaniae Alderslade & Shirwalker, 1991 is likely not a tribute to a name of a person, but in honour of R/V Gaveshani (decommissioned in Oct. 1989), which likely collected the first specimens.

The octocoral name Sinularia gaweli Verseveldt, 1978 is a tribute to Mr. Michael J. Gawel, 19??-,.

Claude Gay, (18 Mar. - Draguignan, dépt. Var in S France) 1800-1873 (29 Nov. - Deffens, close to Flayosc, dépt. Var), zoologist, who started to study medicine and pharmacy in Paris, but soon changed his mind and went into natural history and who collected the type material of Sertularella gayi (Lamouroux, 1821) in Normandie. In 1828 he was offered a post as natural history teacher in Chile and arrived there later that year, spending the time until 1842 (with exception of 1832-34, when he was back in France to obtain equipment for his work) teaching and collecting in Chile and Peru. After this he went to France in order to supervise the publication of his work, the 28 volume "Historia fisica y politica de Chile", including much natural history, and to get in contact with different specialists, who could help him whith that work. He went back to Chile once more in 1863, but returned to France later the same year and he seems to have lived in Deffens à Flayose, dépt. Var, S France when he died [Nereis gayi Blanchard, 1849, Marphysa gayi de Quatrefages, 1865, Acanthocyclus gayi Milne-Edwards, 1848].

The gastropod name Epitonium gaylordianum Lowe, 1932 is in honour of Mrs. Ilsien Nathalie Gaylord, 18??-19??, Boston, "who has done much nature writing for children".

He was educated in his home town Würzburg by i.a. the disciple of L. Oken, J. Müller and Henle, the histologist Rudolf Albert von Kölliker, (6 July - Zürich) 1817-1905 (2 Nov. - Würzburg), who was a careful researcher, making several discoveries [Koellikeria Cobbold, 1860, Koellikerioides Yamaguti, 1970, Renilla koellikeri, Ocnus koellikeri (Semper, 1868), Koellikerina Kramp, 1939, Cystiactis koellikeri Pax F., 1910, Siphonogorgia koellikeri Wright & Studer, 1889] and the cytologist Franz von Leydig, (21 May - Rothenburg) 1821-1908 (13 Apr.), who himself had studied medicine in Würzburg and München and became professor of anatomy in Würzburg in 1855 (later in Tübingen and Bonn), but also published on parasitic and free-living copepods between 1851-81 [Chloromyxum leydigi Mingazzini, 1890, Sphaerifer leydigi Richiardi, 1877]. Leydig's Cells - interstitial cells of the testis are also named for him. Gegenbaur, achieved his PhD for Kölliker in 1851 and shortly after this, he followed his professor to the Mediterranean coast on a research trip. As a result of his published papers on comparative anatomy of different marine animals, he was in 1855 appointed professor in Jena, where he founded a school of science with very disciplinized disciples. Gegenbaur held the opinion that comparative anatomy was the only essential research area, everything else just rubbish. He left science at the age of 74 because of bad health and during his last years he had several strokes and was paralyzed.

The kinorhynch name Echinoderes gerardi Higgins, 1978 is named in honour of "the Honorable Sumner Gerard, (New York) 1916-2005 (25 Feb. - Vero Beach, Florida), former United States Ambassador to Jamaica (between 1974-77, after which he moved to Florida and became professor of marine archaeology at the Univ. of Miami) and former Director of the USAID mission in Tunisia". (Dr. Riccardo Giannuzzi-Savelli kindly provided the birth date).

The zoantharian genus Gerardia Lacaze-Duthiers, 1864 is not a tribute to Frédéric Gérard, 1806-1857, a disciple of Lamarck and Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire, working on evolution theory, but to the unmarried name Gérard of Lacace-Duthiers' mother. The author's father, the Baron, was a rather difficult and authoritative person, so likelely the son loved his mother more.

His special interest was echinoderms, particularly crinoids, but he also worked on e.g. ecology and zoogeography. During his stay in California he became a friend of Ed(ward Flanders Robb) Ricketts, (31 Oct. - Chicago) 1896-1948 (11 May - after his car had been struck by the Del Monte Express 3 days earlier), (Doc in Steinbeck's novels) [Panoploea rickettsi Shoemaker, 1931, Isometridium rickettsi Carlgren, 1949, Aclesia rickettsi MacFarland, 1966, Longiprostatum rickettsi Hyman, 1953, Palythoa rickettsi Carlgren, 1951, Nephtys rickettsi Hartman, 1938], but as Gislén was deeply religious (grown up in a religios family), he was rather shocked when Ricketts - who evidently had a certain sense for jokes - sent him Californian marine specimens wrapped in pages from more or less pornographical magazines in exchange for European dissection equipment [Zeuctocrinus gisleni A.M. Clark, 1973, Hymedesmia gisleni Alander, 1942, Zosime gisleni Lang, 1948]. Ed. Rickets was a relative of Howard T(aylor) Ricketts, (9 Feb.) 1871-1910 (3 May), the Chicago pathologist, after whom the Rickettsiae are named. Despite that the Hopkins Marine Station director Fisher (q.v.) tried to stop it, he published "Between Pacific tides" together with Jack Calvin, 1901-1985, an environmentalist and printer in Sitka, Alaska (from around 1935, where he had arrived by canoe from Oregon around 1930 and fallen in love both with the nature there and his wife to be), which was the northern limit for the marine creatures of this book. Ricketts and Calvin first met in 1932 spending more than 2 months on a collecting trip on Calvin's boat. Calvin's eldest daughter Natasha Ivanovna Calvin, around 1933-2001 (7 Sep. - Sitka, Alaska) (68 years old when she died), also became a marine biologist, working mainly on phycology, but a granddaughter of Jack Calvin, Mary Purvis, is still living in the Sitka area. Jack Calvin and his wife Sasha Kashevaroff (one of around 6 daughers of a Russian orthodox bishop in Juneau, Alaska; died before her husband did) were the owners of the "Grampus", an around 10 m long boat used for marine collecting trips in the Sitka area. After marriage, the Calvin couple first lived in Carmel. California for a few years, becoming friends of the intellectual society in Monterey (Ricketts, the Steunbeck couple, etc.), before moving to Sitka in the mid 1930s. In 1922 Ed. Ricketts met and married Anna Barbara "Nan" Maker, a girl from Pennsylvania, who had come to Chicago. Their son Ed Ricketts jr. was born on Aug. 23 1923 and soon afterwards this couple moved to Pacific Grove and joined Ed's friend Albert E Galigher (another Chicago zoology student, like Ricketts under the influence of the ecologist Warder Clyde Allee) in establishing the "Pacific Biological Laboratories" their common business involved in collecting specimens for schools and laboratories around USA, but Galigher already in 1924 left the business, leaving it to Ricketts and his family, who was growing by the birth of a daughter Nancy, who later moved to Sitka, Alaska. In autumn 1936 a fire destroyd most of Ricketts properties including his laboratory and his library (including essential scientific books and papers and his personal library), so he had to restart almost from scratch. Interesting information about him and his friends may be found m K.A. Rodger (Ed.) 2002. Renaissance Man of Cannery Row. The Life and Letters of Edward F. Ricketts. Univ. of Alabama Press. 283 pp.

Dr. Nils Gissler, (20 Feb. - Gissjö, Torp, Västernorrland) 1715-1771 (19 Nov.), was a student of Linnaeus at Uppsala University, and became the first physician in the true Norrland of Sweden. His studies ranged from meteorology to fisheries, and he died as a respected and still-remembered scientist and physician. His name was mis-spelled on his copepod paper of 1751 for the Svenska Vetenskaps Akademien. Therefore, he appears in copepod circles as "Gisler." [Lernanthropus gisleri van Beneden, 1852, possibly Cerithiopsis gissleri A. M. Strong & J. G. Hertlein, 1939]. (Dr. D. Damkaer kindly provided this information).

The named Conus specimens were among the marine seashells collected by the Glicksteins, and donated to Dr. Edward Petuch for identification and study. (Dr. Glickstein himself kindly provided this information).

The copepod name Schizopera gligici Petkovski, 1957 is perhaps not named for a person, but for the town Gligic in Bosnia Hercegovina?

Prof. Johann Friedrich Gmelin, (8 Aug. - Tübingen) 1748-1804 (1 Nov. - Göttingen), belonged to a well-known family of German naturalists. He was professor of medicine in Göttingen and published a large 10 volume work in botany , several works in chemistry (albeit none of these as magnificent as his son's Leopold, (2 Aug. - Göttingen) 1788-1853 (13 Apr. - Heidelberg), well-known grand handbook in inorganic chemistry), but he is possibly mainly remembered as the publisher of editio 13 of Linnaeus' "Systema Naturae" in 3 volumes between 1788-93 and 1789-96. His cousin Prof. Samuel Gottlieb Gmelin, (23 July - Tübingen) 1744-1774 (27 July), who had been appointed professor of Botany in 1767, had accompanied P.S. Pallas (q.v.) on a trip to south Russia and Persia, but was taken prisoner on his way back by the khan of the kaitaks and died shortly in prison (in Derben) [Polyneura gmelini (Greville) Kylin]. In spite of his short life-span, he managed to publish some papers, partly posthumously thanks to Pallas, but also earlier, i.a. the monumental "Historium Fucorum" in 1868 and the two last volumes of "Flora Sibirica", which the brother of his grandfather, the correspondent of Linnaeus, Johann Georg Gmelin junior,(10 Aug. - Tübingen) 1709-1755 (20 May), from Tübingen had begun to publish, after having been the leader of a Siberian pioneering expedition lasting for 10 years.
