        "meta_description": "We present a commented catalogue of the type specimens of the Afro-Malagasy frog family Hyperoliidae at the herpetological collection of the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin (ZMB). In current publications and databases, many names based on ZMB primary types are listed as synonyms of other species, the types often declared as lost. Consequently, the respective names are often no longer considered in current taxonomic work. We traced 146 nominal taxa of the family Hyperoliidae in the ZMB collection of which currently 130 are presented by primary types (88 holotypes, 10 lectotypes and 32 taxa based on syntype series); 50 of these taxa are currently considered as valid. Primary types of nine taxa could not be located during our inventory of the collection holdings. Seven taxa are exclusively represented by secondary types (paratypes). Many of these types comprise taxa where types have been thought to be lost. As a further service to the community, we provide important details about collectors and their travel routes, as well as respective documents stored in the collection of the Department of Historical Research at ZMB. This should make it easier to potentially compare the ZMB types in future taxonomic revisions.",
