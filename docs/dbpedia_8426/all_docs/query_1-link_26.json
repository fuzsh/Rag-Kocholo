This work covers 367 species and 66 subspecies based on 4106 specimens many of which were collected by Radde himself. For each species there are two sections; the first, \"Systematisches\" comprises measurements and physical characteristics of these specimens as compared with those reported for the same species in Europe or elsewhere; the second, \"Lebensweise und Verbreitung\" pertains to points of interest in the life history, and the distribution of the species within Caucasia. There are also extensive discussions of migration and the relevance of physical geography to distribution.\n\nThis work is said to have been issued in four (Zimmer) or 20 (Anker) parts. Short second, third and fourth supplements were published later (1885-1890) elsewhere (vide Zimmer, Anker). There was also an edition on Cyrillic published in 1884.\n\nThis is an important work since it is the first to describe in detail the avifauna of this area and since it describes several interesting geographical variations.\n\nAnker, 412; Trinity, p. 194; Wood, p. 527; Yale, p. 235; Zimmer, p. 499.\n\nRaffaele, Herbert, Wiley, J., Garido, O., Keith, A., Raffaele, J.\n\nA Guide to the Birds of / The West Indies 23.3 x 15.7 cm. Pp. [1-8]9-511(1). 256 ll. Original green cloth, gilt lettered spine, pictorial dust jacket. Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1998. Printed in the U.

This one is outstanding. The text covers 564 species, for each of which there is an Indies distribution map and a concentrated text that includes “identification”, “voice”, “status and range”, “habitat” and “nesting”. Most of the plates are by Tracy Pedersen and Kristin Williams, with a few by Roman Company, Christopher Cox, Cynthie Fisher, Don Radovich and Bart Rulon. Every ordinary species is shown in taxonomic order on 65 of these plates. A single plate is devoted to casually- occurring species. An additional 12 plates depict a single endemic from each of 12 islands and another 7 are devoted to endemics of the four largest islands, Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica and Puerto Rico. Endemics from other islands constitute the last of the 86 plates, all of which are of an excellent artistic and printed standard.\n\nIt is quite extraordinary that such a useful and attractive book could be so inexpensive. The reason is that the cost of production was subsidized by the World Wildlife Fund U. S.; the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation; the U. S. Fish & Wildlife Services; and the U. S. Forest Service.\n\nRaffles Museum, Bulletin of\n\nBulletin / of the / Raffles Museum / Singapore, Straits Settlements No. 4. December 1930. 25.1 x 16.4 cm. Pp. PL, 1-124.

Chasen and C. Boden Kloss.\n\nC. Boden Kloss was the Director of Museums of British Malaya and F. N. Chasen was the Curator of the Raffles Museum and Library. The first number of the Journal was issued in September 1928.\n\nThe first article in the present issue is the most important. Chasen and Kloss collected 211 species of which about 18 represented new “forms” or “races”. Many measurements and much basic ornithological material are presented and there is a complete bibliography covering previous collections from lowland North Borneo.\n\nThe second article lists 77 species from the islands, most of which were collected by Chasen and Kloss though some were included from previous literature. Only two species were found that were not known from mainland Borneo.\n\nThe third article lists eight species from Mangalum Island and 13 from the Mantanani Islands.\n\nThe fourth article adds three new birds to the Bornean list based on specimens secured by\n\nothers.\n\nThis journal was not widely distributed and OCLC locates only one copy of the first article although it is an important one with respect to the birdlife of Borneo.\n\nRakus(z)an, Tsuchiya (1896-1976), Foster, Walter T. (publisher, author)\n\nThe Art of / Rakusan Tsuchiya / Famous Print Maker of Japan 35.0 x 26.2 Pp. [1-2]3-26, 29-31-32] including pictorial wrappers; 15 ll. 27/28 Lacking (in this copy?) Laguna Beach California, Foster Art Services, ND (ca. 1940). Price $1.00 designated on upper cover which also contains the number 57, perhaps indicating a series.\n\nThis copy includes a single page of introduction, five pages of diagrams and instructions concerning the production of wood blocks and drawing, 21 pages of colored prints including two half-page, one two-page and 13 full-page, a page of advertisements with price list, and the pictorial wrappers.\n\nIn Japan, the family name is usually given first and the given name is usually used in the promotional designation. This is precisely the opposite of the Western convention and westerners often \"correct\" it in their translations. Thus, this artist's name is Tsuchiya Rakusan (or Rakuzan) with the family name Tsuchiya and the given and promotional name, Rakusan. Often, a print maker was given different promotional names by different publishers (for example, Koson, Shoson, Hoson for the artist whose original name was Ohara Matao but who is most widely recognized as Ohara Koson or Koson Ohara). Rakuzan's original birth name was Tsuchiya Kouzou.\n\nRakusan, a Kyoto artist, was an interesting historical figure, a kind of Japanese Rex Brasher. Although he was contemporary with the Shin Hanga movement that emphasized the separate contributions of the artist, woodcarver, printer and publisher, he fulfilled or strictly controlled all these functions himself. He produced a series of about 100 prints each depicting a bird and a flower of Japan. These were large, about the size of the D. G. Elliot folios, and were issued in print runs of perhaps 100-220 copies. They are offered through Foster in this catalog for $25.00. At the present time (2002), they are rarely seen although there is one English dealer with a substantial stock. He charges approximately £350-550 per print and dates them all (arbitrarily ?) to about 1930. Rakusan's style is very distinctive and the best of the prints are extremely attractive and not at all like other Japanese prints of the kacho-e genre.\n\nFoster wrote and/or published a series of \"how to\" books about art. This work, in effect a promotional catalog, is a bit different because it seems clear that Foster collected Rakusan's work and served as his agent in the U. S. A.\n\nRakusan (Rakuzan) Tsuchiya (1896-1976)\n\nBlack-headed munia and chrysanthemums Wove paper. Double oban. Paper size, 596 x 458 mm. Image size, 478 x 342 mm. Japanese woodblock print with gold sprinkling. From the Rakuzan Kachou Gafu (100 Series). First printing. Kyoto, ca 1930 (1929-1933). Label of authenticity on verso.\n\nThe series of 100 very large-format colored woodblock prints by Rakusan is amongst the most beautiful suites of bird prints done in the 20th century. It was first issued in an edition of 200 sets over the period 1929-1933. Generally, two prints were issued per month. A second edition including many reprintings of individual designs was put out from 1933 to about 1941 and a third edition reprinting a smaller number of the original designs was done sometime between 1947 and 1955. This information, together with criteria for identifying the various editions was obtained from an article by Dr. Michael Nichols, “Determining the edition of a 100 series print”, at www.rakusan.net.\n\nThe present example is from the original edition as indicated by: the six character watermark at the base of the sheet which reads, right to left, Raku-zan Ka-chou Ga-fu; the three character signature, Rakuzan Kyo at the lower left; and the seal A at the lower left. The watermark is the most definitive criterion. This plate was number 35 of the original issue.\n\nIndividual prints from the original series such as this one are scarce. A complete set is probably unobtainable.\n\nRalph, Robert\n\nWilliam MacGillivray / Creatures of the air, land and sea 28.8 x 23.0 cm. Pp. [1-5]6-128.

Also contains uncolored text figures 1-37.\n\nMacGillivray deserves to be better appreciated. He collaborated with Audubon on the “Ornithological biography…”(1831-39) and was the author of the well received “ A history of British birds, indigenous and migratory…”(1837-52).

However, Robert’s beautiful artwork created an immediate sensation in 1878 and caused Lebet to expand his ambitions for the work. Beginning with the appearance of this work, Robert has always been a favorite among connoisseurs of ornithological art. His birds are full of character and that character is always faithful to nature indicating a keen knowledge of his subjects in the field. His backgrounds are equally interesting, the foreground indicative of the life history of the species, the more distant area in a nostalgic, impressionistic mode. Some or all of these plates were also used to illustrate Riesenthal’s Gefiederte Freunde (1889-1883), Harting’s Glimpses of bird life (1880), Sharpe’s Birds in nature (1888) and Trouessart’s Oiseaux utiles (1892). However, their reproduction by Lemercier is not particularly good and Robert’s Les oiseaux de chez nous (1929-1933, also issued as Unsere einheimische Vögel) provides a better representation of the artist’s great skill. Ronsil pays homage to this skill on page 87 of L’art Français…(1958).\n\nThe text for the present work includes a length measurement, a brief description, and an essay in very flowery prose that usually includes something of the life history of the species and why it is “useful”.

Ronsil # 1093\n\nThe work of most interest to me is the one with illustrations by Robert, who signed himself Paul, but was actually Leo Paul. This is of some importance since his son, a 20th century ornithological artist, was also named Paul. Leo Paul Robert, the artist responsible for the superb wood cuts in the present work, won several prizes and became deservedly well known for a work published in 1878 entitled Les Oiseaux utiles dans la Nature-Description Pittoresque des Oiseaux utiles Ouvrage publié sous la direction de M. D. Lebet, Paris, Germer-Baillière. According to Ronsil (#2490), the work contained 60 colored plates, one for each species (chromolithographs by Lemercier), 30 full-page wood engravings and 122 text wood engravings. The text was written by Rambert.. On the title page of the present work, reference is made to the prizes won by Robert, one of which was awarded in 1884, so we know that this present publication was issued after 1884. In the preface, Lebet, now evidently a publisher in Lausanne, tells us that he is publishing this work to enable students in school to learn to distinguish useful birds since laws were recently promulgated that prohibited the killing of such useful birds. He tells us that the illustrations and text were taken from the original work. These 60 full-page wood cuts were taken from the text engravings. It is not clear to me why four of these pictures have the figures of birds colored by hand. The coloring is extremely accurate and professional and there is some oxidation suggesting that it was done by a knowledgeable, gifted contemporary hand. I have the feeling that the work was not published with these figures colored and I wonder whether it might not have been Robert himself who colored a few of the bird figures in this copy.\n\nFinally, I have two earlier works by James Harting illustrated by Robert, Glimpses of Bird Life (1880) and Sketches of Bird Life (1883) that have some overlap of figures with this one. The Brambling in both of those books is reversed with respect to its image in the present work whereas the Great Tit is not so reversed. Even though the present work was published later than the two Harting books, one might assume that its wood engravings were taken from the original blocks since the same publisher is involved. Did Harting have some, but not all of his figures reengraved? The present work is not only absent from all major bibliographies, collections and libraries but is also not mentioned by David Lank in his compilation and analysis of published works containing illustrations by Robert.\n\nThese three works are apparently all uncommon. Indeed, except for the single reference to Ronsil for that by Fleuriot, I could find no reference to any of the three in Ronsil, Wood, Trinity, Yale and Zimmer nor in the on-line catalogs of The AMNH, BMNH, Library of Congress, NYPL, Harvard, Cornell, Yale, Trinity, LSU, Kansas nor the Smithsonian.\n\nRambert, Eugène (1830-1886), Robert, Léo-Paul (1851-1923)\n\nNos Oiseaux 23.4 x 17.5 cm.

The author attempts to do this by telling a series of short stories and weaving into them considerable material about the life histories of various species. There is no formal ornithological material.\n\nThe colored and uncolored graphic material have considerable appeal. The chromolithographs show various species on limbs or reeds, occasionally with nests, but always on a white, unprinted background. The text figures relate to the story being told and do not always show birds. It is interesting to note the deterioration in quality of the chromolithographs in the volume that is a late edition.\n\nThis work is not listed in any of the major collections or libraries.

The only other available illustrated books were Peckover and Filewood's Birds of New Guinea and Tropical Australia (1976) and Brian Coates's Birds in Papua New Guinea (1977), each with some nice colored photographs, but neither comprehensive. The present work was authoritative although unsatisfactory for field identification. It contained identification keys and, for each of the approximately 650 species, provided a description with measurements, range, subspecies in New Guinea, information on nesting, and a section of \"remarks\". Unfortunately, the illustrations were incomplete and mostly uncolored. Most of the birds in New Guinea are endemic and their distribution was poorly known. Field identification remained extremely difficult until the appearance in 1986 of Birds of New Guinea by Beehler, Pratt and Zimmerman in which every bird was figured, most in color. After that, New Guinea became a popular destination for serious bird watchers .and knowledge of its avifauna increased quickly.\n\nThis work is listed by AMNH, Cornell, Harvard, Trinity and Yale.\n\n(Rathbone, Hannah [Mrs. Richard, neé Reynolds][1798-1878])\n\nThe / Poetry of Birds / Selected / from Various Authors; / with / Coloured Illustrations / by a Lady 23.1 x 17.3 cm.

She figures prominently in his diaries as quoted in \"Audubon and his Journals\" by Maria Audubon. For example, in his entry for 28 July, 1826, Audubon writes \"Later, feeling lonely and sad, I called on Mrs. R. Rathbone…She is so truly delightful a companion that had it been possible I should have made my call long instead of short\". She was also a gifted artist who benefited from Audubon's personal instruction.\n\nThis volume does not contain Hannah Rathbone's name and its anonymity has led to the perception that it is much rarer than is actually the case. It consists of an anthology of poetry describing 21 common English birds each of which is illustrated by a fine small vignette showing it in an appropriate background. The two contents pages overlap at Skylark which is listed as a major heading for each. Bibliographers who assume that each major species heading corresponds to an illustration can be misled by this as apparently were Mullens and Swann, who call for 22 plates instead of 21.\n\nBradley Martin #1815; Jackson, Dictionary of Bird Artists, p. 403; Mullens & Swann, p. 485.

It describes five species, Purple Finch, Rose-breasted Grosbeak, Goldfinch, Yellow Warbler and Redstart. The descriptions borrow considerably from earlier authors and are written in flowery and rather avuncular prose. The author intended to cover at least 10 species, illustrating one per part, but not necessarily including the whole complementary text in that part. Thus, part V, the last one published, ends in the midst of the text for the Redstart and actually in mid word; i. e. “consider-” (for “considerable”). Each part cost $1.00 which was not cheap in 1880.\n\nThe graphics in this work are astonishingly well done both with respect to art and reproduction. The hand-coloring of the plates is particularly good. I believe that the plates were produced by engraving on metal but there are no plate margins so perhaps they could have been done on wood.

I believe that the first of the series was \"La Lithologie et la Conchyliologie…\", Paris, 1842 by A. J. Dezallier d'Argenville.\n\nAlthough the title page implies that the translation from Ray's Synopsis Methodica Avium (1713) is the main feature of this work, the author has added much material based on later works including those by Linnaeus and Klein and the result is a good overview of ornithology of the era. It attempts to cover all the known families and discusses representative species from each. The book is contemporary with the Planches Enluminées and Brisson's magnum opus and has probably unjustly suffered by comparison. Martinet's illustrations for all three are of similar high quality. Plate 25 is one of my favorite of all illustrations. It depicts a Flamingo and a Razor-billed Auk standing together in a marshy area. Martinet was very knowledgeable about birds (he subsequently wrote and illustrated a large work of his own) and I'm quite certain he was making fun of someone when he conceived this highly unlikely, but very amusing, tableau.\n\nIt is interesting that many birds, such as tits, woodpeckers etc, are properly placed together here as they had been by Belon and by the ancients, whereas others are contained in very contrived groupings. Thus, the Nightingale falls under the heading of \"diverse small birds with tail of a single color\" (my translation).\n\nThis book was also issued by the publishers in a colored state. The coloring is quite innacurate and this is one of the few instances where I think the uncolored version of an ornithological book is more pleasing than the colored.\n\nWood, p. 530; Zimmer, p. 501.

This is only the second such list, the first having been written by Christopher Merrett and published initially in 1666. The present work anticipates the classification adopted by Willughby and Ray in their great work first published two years later. Many species are identified by both common and Latin names. Casey Wood remarks (p. 529) \"The important parts of this work are the early lists of birds and fishes\". On the other hand for an entirely different perspective about what is important in this book, we read in Wheldon & Wesley catalogue 140 (1977), item 159, that \"Skeat in preparing a new edition in 1874 wrote 'the most important book ever published on the subject of English dialects(up to 1800)'.\" A metallurgist might supply yet another opinion.\n\nMullens and Swann (p. 487-488) provide a \"collation\" of this book which gives the figure of 14 for preliminary pages (seven leaves) whereas there are only three here. However, the description in the Wheldon & Wesley catalog indicates that one of those leaves is an initial binder's blank (there are two such terminal blanks in this copy) and I think there are probably three lacking printed leaves here.\n\nWood, p. 529.

The book was the first to contain hand-colored lithographs in large format and was the inspiration for Gould who used the same style for his entire opus. Lear continued as a wildlife artist for a relatively short time and then devoted himself to nonsense rhymes and landscape paintings executed from sketches made during various voyages. The present work provides an account of Lear's early life and the production of the parrot monograph.\n\nSince few people knew of, or could afford the ornithological monographs that contained Lear's illustrations, his genius as a wildlife artist was forgotten for almost a century until an interest in it was rekindled by this little book. Subsequently, his works have been reproduced in many books and he has become recognized as one of the finest wildlife artists of the 19th century. In my view, his best work was done when he could examine living subjects thoroughly as was the case with his parrots, which he studied in the Zoological Gardens, and with the birds and mammals at Lord Stanley's estate which he depicted in Gleanings from the menagerie at Knowsley Hall (1846).\n\nListed by Cornell, Harvard, Trinity and Yale.

There are also many other colored vignettes and small figures scattered throughout. There is also a distribution map for each of these species.\n\nThis book provides yet another example of a beautiful inexpensive volume about British birds intended for a popular audience. It was here that Raymond Ching made his first spectacular appearance on the British bird-watching scene and the other illustrations, as well as the text, are also authoritative. It’s difficult to categorize this book. It is certainly too big to be a field guide, yet the species accounts are less comprehensive than one might expect in a handbook. Perhaps it might best be considered a textbook of British ornithology.\n\nOCLC lists more than 400 locations.\n\nReboussin, Roger (1881-1965)\n\nL’Oiseau chez lui / Livre Couleur du Temps / Oiseaux de Mer / Et de Rivages 41.0 x 32.0 cm. 2o in fours.

Each gathering contained one colored plate save that containing the preliminary leaves. The préface is by Camille Mauclair and extols Reboussin as an artist who depicted living creatures as part of their natural environment. For each of the headings listed above, Reboussin has written an anecdotal narrative word painting of a birding experience to accompany and complement his text pictures and colored plates. “..ici les images verbales correspondent étroitement aux images graphiques” (Mauclair). Some of the characteristic species of the particular habitat are then described in technical terms by J. Rapine.\n\nThis is an exquisite, and beautifully produced work. The pictures are vivid, expressionistic tableaux and the influence of Leo Paul Robert is evident. They remind me also of those by Gitz-Johansen in the later work by Finn Salomonsen on the Birds of Greenland.\n\nThis is a remarkable copy in a completely original state.\n\nRonsil, 2513; Trinity, p. 196; Wood, p. 530 (incomplete); Yale, p. 237.\n\nReboussin, Roger (1881-1965), Jeanson, Pierre (compiler, editor, publisher)\n\nLes Oiseaux de France 32.4 x 24.1 cm.

These are signed by Reboussin and many are dated 1935-1964.\n\nMarcel Jeanson, the well known French hunter, bird watcher, bibliophile and connoisseur of ornithological art, in 1935 commissioned his friend, the artist Reboussin, to paint every species of bird known to occur in France. Jeanson died in 1942 but Reboussin continued with the series which apparently became the property of Jeanson's son Pierre. The paintings were donated to the Musée de la Chassse et de la Nature in Paris. These pictures are here published for the first time by Pierre Jeanson. Reboussin was very much a disciple of Leo Paul Robert and these beautiful pictures depict vivid, dynamic birds in fine impressionistic backgrounds.\n\nMost of the book is presented in French and English and there are a few errors of translation. The classification is a bit archaic. But this is a book of art, a pleasure to possess, and an important contribution to French ornithological iconography.\n\nReed, Chester A(lbert)(1876-1912)\n\nBird Guide / Part 1 / Water Birds, Game Birds and Birds of Prey / East of the Rockies Oblong 8.3 x 14.2 cm.

It can be identified as such by the presence of the year of publication on the title page as well as on the copyright page. This is the only copy of which I have ever heard that is contained in its original printed box and it is in immaculate condition. I have another copy of what is presumably also the first printing and is identical to this one save that it bears the imprint “W. B. Clarke & Co., Boston”. And I have yet another example of the first edition, almost identical to this one save that it lacks the year of publication and bears the Clarke imprint.\n\nAlthough the water bird guide is called \"Part 1\", that dealing with land birds and called \"Part 2\" was actually first printed earlier, in 1905. Reed was the son of a publisher, Charles K. Reed, and was a prolific publisher of popular ornithological, and to a lesser extent, botanical material. His bird guides fit easily into the pocket and were the first widely used bona fide field guides anywhere. The most popular was the guide for land birds, Bird Guide, Part 2, and he wrote in 1912 that 300,000 copies of that work had been issued by that time. The bird guides were reprinted repeatedly until after the second world war when they were superceded by the Peterson and Pough guides.\n\nLittle has been written about Reed and he has not received the recognition he deserves for popularizing the study of nature in the first third of the 20th century. Part of this is due to his early death. His knowledge was broad and he was a sound artist. His first published book was the Color Key to North American Birds with Frank M. Chapman and collaboration with the latter, even though in the role of an artist, is a strong indication that Reed was very able.\n\nIt is not generally recognized that the Reed eastern guides for both land and water birds appeared in two quite different early 20th century copyrighted versions which should be regarded as editions. The former was published in 1905 and1906 and reprinted until 1909 when it was superceded by the second edition. The first edition of the water birds was issued in 1906 (i. e. this copy), the second in 1910. There were significant textural differences but the most important change was in the illustrations. In the first edition, the pictures were printed in color whereas in later editions they were produced photo-mechanically. The images in this original printing are very simple so it must have been difficult to get them on the reproductive matrix which does not appear to have been wood or stone. The coloring is equally basic, involving only a few tints, and the registration is exceptionally poor. The resulting pictures barely appear to be colored in many instances and are exceedingly crude representations. The only other work with similarly printed figures is the Color Key… which, like the early Reed guides, was printed by the Press of A. M. Eddy that apparently specialized in the technique which may have been \"zincography\". From 1909 on, the Reed guides contained pictures that exhibited more detail and background and were colored photo-mechanically. I consider the latter a second edition but there may have been more than one later edition. Doubleday was the main publisher of later editions although Charles K. Reed may have issued early examples. Early Reed guides were also published under imprints of W. B. Clarke of Boston and Musson of Toronto.\n\nTrinity, p. 196; Wood, later edition; Zimmer, later edition; Yale, unlisted; original edition present in on-line catalogs of Harvard, Cornell.

The responsibilities of the three authors are not spelled out but Brasher clearly made a big contribution to the pictures which are rather attractive and well produced. This was amongst Brasher's first commissions. Unlike the two Reed guides covering eastern birds, this one did not go through a first, color-printed edition and the present rare first printing contains pictures that were reproduced by the four-color photomechanical technique. This work encompasses many more species than the separate works on eastern land and water birds so that each plate depicts two or three instead of a single species. Information supplied for each species includes English and Latin names; AOU checklist number; length; brief description; voice; nest and eggs; and range. This book, like the comparable ones covering eastern birds, was a bona fide field guide that fit easily into even a small pocket. It never approached the eastern guides in popularity.\n\nLater printings listed by Wood, Zimmer, AMNH, Cornell, Harvard, Yale; unlisted by Trinity.\n\nReed, C. Albert, editor (Volume 1; Chester A.

The \"Identification Charts\" all appeared in the Color key… although their texts were somewhat altered. There are examples of color gravure and color half-tone in addition to the color-printed engravings. Almost all of the colored plates contain printed matter on their versos. Most, but not all of the drawings and photographs were done by Reed.\n\nAn additional seven issues, Jan-June and a combined July-Aug were published in the unfinished Volume 6 of 1906. The publication was then discontinued, probably because Reed became preoccupied with his \"Guides\".\n\nThe present periodical is replete with various kinds of written entertainment such as \"enigmas\" as well as stories for children combined with serious characterizations in word and picture of numerous North American birds and even some early articles by Harry Caldwell on the birds of southern China, to evolve eventually (1931) in the Caldwells' South China birds. There is much experimentation with the production of colored plates. Much of the artwork by Reed does not appear in his later publications and some of it is very good.

Eddy of Albion New York for the very early (prior to 1909) Reed guides and Chapman and Reed’s Color key to North American birds (1903)\n\nThe very last number of this journal, number 7, was the first and only example of a new intended bimonthly publication schedule with each number costing 20c instead of 10c.\n\nIt is worth noting that part 2 (land birds) of the Reed Guide was first advertised in the November 1905 issue of this journal and was claimed by Reed in number 7 of 1906 to be already in its 27th thousand. Part 1 (water birds) was first advertised in the February, 1906 issue. The original costs of each were 50c in cloth and 75c in leather. Reed probably abandoned the present journal because of the increasing demands of his field guide operation.\n\nThis journal was a colorful medley of heterogeneous contributions mostly intended for children. Some of the plates and photographs were quite attractive and there is a timely article on the Passenger Pigeon with a colored plate by Reed in the June 1906 issue.\n\nListed by AMNH, Cornell, Harvard, Trinity, Yale.\n\nReed, Chester A(lbert) (1876-1912)\n\nBird Guide / Part 1 / Water Birds, Game Birds and Birds of Prey / East of the Rockies Oblong 8.3 x 14.2 cm.

The latter was reprinted many times and remained in use until after the second world war at which time it was succeeded by the Peterson and Pough guides. The present example is a later printing of the first (1906) edition, all printings of which are scarce.

As a child, I used an earlier printing of 1940 and I can testify to the benefits of Peterson's field guide as compared to this one because I tested them together in the field. At the time, this guide contained many more colored figures than the contemporary Peterson which was the second edition of 1939 with only four colored plates so it was not immediately obvious which of the to might be more useful. The last edition of this book was published in 1951.\n\nThe text in this work provides English and Latin names; the AOU checklist number; length; a brief description of appearance and habits; a brief description of song, nest and eggs; and the range.\n\nIt is interesting to compare the illustrations in this book with those of the first edition in which they were simpler and reproduced by an unusual manual method of color printing. Hard as it was to use the present book for field identification, it must have been considerably more difficult to use the original.\n\nDoubleday was also the publisher of the Pough guide, the land bird volume of which was first issued in 1945. Ironically, that work, which, along with Peterson's certainly spelled the end for this one, is included here in the Doubleday advertisement.\n\nTrinity, p. 196; Wood, p. 531; Yale, 237; Zimmer, 504 (various second edition reprints).\n\nReed, Chester A(lbert) (1876-1912)\n\nBirds / of Eastern North America 17.6 x 12.7 cm.

It was printed by Doubleday's printer (Garden City Press) and the colored figures were produced in half-tone as opposed to the bizarre colored printing by A. M. Eddy of Albion N. Y. that was used in the first editions of Reed guides. The book includes a length measurement, physical and range descriptions and a variable but superficial life history. Reed was the most important American figure in publicizing the popular study of ornithology during the first third of the 29th century but has been strangely ignored by bibliographers and ornithological historians, perhaps due to his premature death.\n\nThe spine of this volume advertises \"408 colored plates\".\n\nTrinity, p. 196; Wood, p. 531.

Contains 232 unnumbered (partly) color-printed plates after the author on the side of text pages, each depicting the single described species on that page. Also contains numerous unnumbered line cuts illustrating anatomical parts and characteristics of various orders and the families they comprise.\n\nThis is the rare initial printing of the first edition of Part 1 of Reed's field guide. It can be identified as such by the presence of the year of publication on the title page as well as on the copyright page. I have another example of the first edition, almost identical to this one save that it lacks the year of publication on the title page which is spaced differently and contains a horizontal black line between the printed lines \"Editor of American Ornithology\" and \"W. B. Clarke Co.\" The two examples also differ somewhat in the coloring of the backgrounds of the prints, more of those in the present copy being gray rather than blue compared with the other.\n\nAlthough the water bird guide is called \"Part 1\", that dealing with land birds and called \"Part 2\" was actually first printed earlier, in 1905. Reed was the son of a publisher, Charles K. Reed, and was a prolific publisher of popular ornithological, and to a lesser extent, botanical material. His bird guides fit easily into the pocket and were the first widely used bona fide field guides anywhere. The most popular was the guide for land birds, Bird Guide, Part 2, and he wrote in 1912 that 300,000 copies of that work had been issued by that time. The bird guides were reprinted repeatedly until after the second world war when they were superceded by the Peterson and Pough guides.\n\nLittle has been written about Reed and he has not received the recognition he deserves for popularizing the study of nature in the first third of the 20th century. Part of this is due to his early death. His knowledge was broad and he was a sound artist. His first published book was the Color Key to North American Birds with Frank M. Chapman and collaboration with the latter, even though in the role of an artist, is a strong indication that Reed was very able.\n\nIt is not generally recognized that the Reed eastern guides for both water and land birds, appeared in two quite different early 20th century copyrighted versions which should be regarded as editions. The first of land birds was published in 1905 and1906 and reprinted until 1909 when it was superceded by the second. The first of water birds was published in 1906, the second in 1910. There were significant textural differences but the most important change was in the illustrations. In the first edition, the pictures were printed in color whereas in later editions they were produced photo-mechanically. The images in this original printing are very simple so it must have been difficult to get them on the reproductive matrix which does not appear to have been wood or stone. The coloring is equally basic, involving only a few tints, and the registration is exceptionally poor. The resulting pictures barely appear to be colored in many instances and are exceedingly crude representations. The only other work with similarly printed figures is the Color Key… which, like the early Reed guides, was printed by the Press of A. M. Eddy that apparently specialized in the technique which may have been \"zincography\". From 1909 on, the Reed guides contained pictures that exhibited more detail and background and were colored photo-mechanically. I consider the latter a second edition but there may have been more than one later edition. Doubleday was the main publisher of later editions although Charles K. Reed may have issued early examples. Early Reed guides were also published under imprints of W. B. Clarke of Boston, as here, and Musson of Toronto.\n\nTrinity, p. 196; Wood, later edition; Zimmer, later edition; Yale, unlisted; original edition present in on-line catalogs of Harvard, Cornell.

This is because all subsequent edition and printings of this volume have original copyrights of 1909 and 1906 on their copyright pages. The 1909 edition represented a substantial difference and improvement since it contained different, fully colored pictures that were reproduced by four-color half-tone. Why did the Reeds issue a separate copyright for this work in 1906 and never refer back to the present volume as the original copyright? The texts of the two volumes appear to be printed from the identical setting. I've examined this book carefully and found the following differences in it from the 1906 version:\n\n1. This volume has gatherings of eight and 12 leaves whereas the later one has only gatherings of eight.\n\n2. The page numbers in this volume are, for the most part, placed under the text with only a few under the pictures whereas they are all under the pictures in the later printing.\n\n3. The frames around the pictures are of black and an additional color in this volume whereas they are only black in the later volume. In this volume, the second color is usually one that also appears on the bird and there is frequent and grotesque misregistration of the color on both frame and bird.\n\n4. This volume bears the date 1905 on both title and copyright page.\n\nApparently, only the Land Bird volume \"Part 2\" was issued in 1905 and the earliest printing of \"Part 1\" was the 1906. At least that's my opinion until I find otherwise.\n\nTrinity and the Library of Congress list a 1905 date for Part 2 accompanied by a 1906 date for Part 1. No other major library lists the 1905 issue (is it a \"printing\" or an \"edition\"?) which, I suspect, is quite rare.\n\nRe ed, Chester A(lbert)(1876-1912)\n\nBird guide / part 2 / land birds east of the Rockies / from parrots to bluebirds 14.0 x 8.3 cm.
