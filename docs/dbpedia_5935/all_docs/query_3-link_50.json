        "text": "The city of Paris is connected by an extensive public transport network, comprising public buses, metro lines, trams, and RER (Regional Express Trains). Paris boasts one of the world's most extensive and efficient public transport systems.\n\nThe Paris Organizing Committee suggests the following apps to help with your navigation of the city\n\nRATP App & Website (Available on App Store & Google Play Store)\n\nhttps://www.ratp.fr/en\n\nCitymapper App & Website (Available on App Store & Google Play Store)\n\nhttps://citymapper.com/paris?lang=fr&l=eng\n\nAdditionally, to get around in the best way possible during the Games, the following site is recommended as it pertains to public transport closures, crowds/lines at the stations, driving restrictions, and security perimeters Anticipating the Games (anticiperlesjeux.gouv.fr).\n\nThe RATP (Régie autonome des transports) is the most used form of public transportation in Paris and is likely the most efficient way to travel from accommodation to venue. To see the entire coverage map for the RATP, visit https://www.ratp.fr/plan-metro .\n\nTo access the metro in Paris, you’ll want to buy a Navigo Card. To learn more about ways to purchase this card, the services that it serves, as well as the coverage, please visit https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/media/navigo-travel-card .\n\nThe price of a Navigo will change depending on if you are paying per ride or buy a card for a designated amount of time (weekend/week/month/etc). It has been reported that metro rides will face a significant increase during Games time and can be as much as 4 Euro per ride.\n\nDo a search on sites like Kayak, Booking.com, Hotels.com, etc. for pricing and availability. Be prepared that if you are looking to stay in central Paris during the Games the nightly price is hefty. You can also look at properties directly (i.e. looking at an IHG, Marriott or Hilton site directly) and see what inventory they have.\n\nWe would anticipate that over the next month or two there will be some more hotel inventory that comes online based on group bookings adjustments/drops that will become available with various hotels in Paris.\n\nYou can take a look at options through Airbnb. It would be good to do some research ahead of time and know which neighborhood(s) you would like to be in and also which one’s are closest to the venues/activities that you are most interested in.\n\nConsider staying outside of Paris on a train line and commuting in for your events and experiences. The cost of housing outside of Paris will still be elevated, however likely will be less expensive than within Paris directly.\n\nTo visit the official Paris Games Time Airbnb site, click here: https://www.airbnb.com/e/paris2024stays?c=.pi129.pkparis2024_gamestime_en"
