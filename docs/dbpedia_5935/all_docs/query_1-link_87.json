        "text": "For Professional Pilot-Airplane, Professional Pilot-Helicopter, or Aviation Management-Flying Applicants\n\nIf you’re planning to choose the Professional Pilot or Aviation Management – Flying concentration, you should apply as close to or on August 1 to increase your potential for a flight slot. Flight major applications are accepted during the fall term application timeframe only. Due to the limited number of flight slots OU has each fall, the demand for one of these slots is great.\n\nFirst-Time Freshmen\n\nDue to unprecedented market interest in the field of aviation, the OU School of Aviation has limited flying spots for fall 2025 freshmen. Students interested in Professional Pilot-Airplane, Professional Pilot-Helicopter, or Aviation Management-Flying concentrations for fall 2025 are encouraged to apply to the University of Oklahoma when the application opens on August 1. Interested students can only apply for the fall term. OU’s admissions application for these flying concentrations will remain open until November 1. No second or separate application outside of OU’s admissions application is required. Admitted students will then have until January 15 to complete the School of Aviation’s One Stop Packet. No later than March 1, admitted students with completed One Stop Packets will be notified of competitive flying spot admission. This secondary admission process is independent from admission to the university. Students then have until May 1 to send their medical certificate and submit their enrollment deposit to reserve their spot in the incoming freshmen class. Although the starting term at OU is the fall semester, flying spots are assigned either for the fall, spring, or summer term. Flight experience is not required and preference is not given to students with a pilot's license.\n\nImportant Dates:\n\nAugust 1: OU Application Opens\n\nNovember 1: Application for Flying Concentrations Closes\n\nJanuary 15: Deadline to Complete and Submit School of Aviation’s One Stop Packet\n\nMarch 1: Admitted Students with Completed One Stop Packets are Notified of Flying Spots\n\nMay 1: Enrollment Deposit and Medical Certificate Deadline\n\nLance Lamkin, airport operations officer at OU’s Max Westheimer Airport, says CareerTech training gives students interested in an aviation career advantage as they pursue training opportunities beyond CareerTech. “If you’re coming from CareerTech to the University of Oklahoma School of Aviation, there isn’t much of a difference,” Lamkin said. “We make it a very seamless transition. I see the future of aviation in the state of Oklahoma being nothing but bright.”\n\nThe OU College of Atmospheric and Geographic Sciences School of Aviation partners with airlines across the U.S. to offer pathway programs that give students the opportunity to work toward careers with some of the nation’s largest airlines. These partnerships help qualifying students launch their aviation careers and get into the right seat of a commercial airline sooner.\n\nThe programs are open to students in Professional Pilot or Aviation Management – Flying concentrations with a private pilot certificate and provide recruitment, screening, selection, training and placement strategies to cadets—as well as mentorships with current pilots and tuition assistance—as they earn their ratings and ultimately become certified flight instructors for their airline at OU.\n\nThe School of Aviation has a rich history of aviation education and training, and these partnerships help the university to continue providing excellent aviation training and flight education for future pilots.\n\nOU currently has cadet partnership agreements with the following airlines:"
