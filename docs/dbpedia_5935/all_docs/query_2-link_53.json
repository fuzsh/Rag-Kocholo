        "text": "Travelling by train with the SNCF\n\nHow can i benefit from assistance for train journeys?\n\nPeople with disabilities and reduced mobility are entitled to free assistance at their departure and/or arrival stations, from a dedicated welcome area through to their seat on the train. This service is available in more than 1,000 stations across France. Assistance may be essential for wheelchair users depending on the stations and trains concerned. In some cases, arrangements to help them get on or off their train will need to be put in place by the agents.\n\nDuring busy periods, it is advisable to book this service in advance, 3 months before the date of travel, to ensure that you have access to assistance. Without a booking, assistance may be subject to availability.\n\nAssist'enGare offers a single booking service in French and English to make it easier to book any train.\n\nYou can access Assist'enGare :\n\nBy Internet using the booking form;\n\nBy telephone every day from 8am to 8pm, on 32 12 and +33 (0)9 72 72 00 92 from abroad (free service + call charge) ;\n\nor via RogerVoice, the special call centre for the deaf and hearing-impaired people\n\nMore about the assistance service\n\nBefore buying your train ticket, we recommend checking that assistance services are available in the station concerned and for the times required. To do this, visit garesetconnexions.sncf and Transilien.com, in the “Search a station” section.\n\nHow can I travel by train if I use a wheelchair?\n\nWheelchair users are welcomed on SNCF trains in dedicated spaces, with an average of two seats per train. Outside the Ile-de-France region, this can rise to four seats when two trains are linked.\n\nRemember to book as early as possible!\n\nTo help you plan your journeys at stations and on your journey, you can check the operating status of lifts and escalators throughout France. To do so, go to garesetconnexions.sncf.\n\nLearn more\n\nVisit the dedicated site sncf.com presenting the services and support offered by the SNCF for passengers with disabilities or reduced mobility: dimensions of wheelchairs that are accepted on board, discounted fares for people accompanying them, possibilities for assistance and service dogs, services for people who are deaf or hearing impaired, equipment available on board and in stations, etc.\n\nIn brief\n\nWatch this video to find out all the key information for people with reduced mobility when travelling by train.\n\nDownload this document summarising the steps involved in preparing for a train journey in France or from abroad if you have a disability.\n\nTravelling to competition venues\n\nTo help make your journeys easier in the Île-de-France region during the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, a range of adapted and specific services are being put in place. There are five ways to get to the competition venues.\n\nDedicated transfer services for wheelchair users\n\nDuring the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, Île-de-France Mobilités will be providing a dedicated shuttle service for spectators in wheelchairs.\n\nThis service will serve only venues located in the Île-de-France region. Given the expected crowds on the public transport network, this will be the preferred solution.\n\nThese transfer services will be for people with wheelchair user tickets for a Paris 2024 competition venue and another person who may be accompanying them.
