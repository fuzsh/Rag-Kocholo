Layovers are necessary to maintain 10 minute intervals and provide you with consistent on-time performance. Since the Circulator operates on headways and not timetables, layovers help to prevent buses on each route from traveling too closely to one another. Additionally, they allow our drivers to gain the rest they need to remain alert and operate the bus safely.\n\nIn order to meet ridership demands, there are a few Van Hool buses from 2005 that remain in service. These buses were not originally manufactured with a strong air conditioning unit, but were retrofitted with AC at a later date. Sometimes the summer weather in DC gets the best of them.\n\nWe are diligently working to retire all the Van Hool buses. In the last five years, we have added several new buses that are all fully equipped with air conditioning that properly cools the vehicle during hot days."
