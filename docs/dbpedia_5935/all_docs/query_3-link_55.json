        "text": "Over the last year, Wabtec took a bold step toward a low-to-zero-emission locomotive future with the world’s first heavy-haul 100-percent battery-electric locomotive – called FLXdrive™. The locomotive, powered by approximately 20,000 battery cells, was tested in revenue operation across more than 13,320 miles of hilly terrain in San Joaquin Valley, California.\n\nOperating in a consist between two other locomotives and with a battery capacity of 2.4 megawatt hours, FLXdrive successfully reduced overall fuel consumption by more than 11 percent — the equivalent to over 6,200 gallons of diesel fuel saved and approximately 69 tons of CO2 emissions reduced.\n\nThe next version of FLXdrive is currently in development and expected to be ready for market in 2023. With a battery capacity of more than 7 megawatt hours, we anticipate further reducing fuel consumption and emissions by up to 30 percent.\n\nWabtec’s Green Friction technology is the result of the Company’s expertise in friction materials and significant investments in the methodology of measuring the particles emitted during braking.\n\nOver the past year, this technology has undergone rigorous testing with Paris region operator, RATP, and has proven its ability to reduce particle emissions from friction braking on metro trains by up to 90 percent. RATP and Wabtec have equipped two trains that operate on one of the busiest lines in Europe with this new technology for a final pilot. This technology represents a significant milestone on the journey towards cleaner tunnels for passengers and network personnel.\n\nWabtec is increasing port throughput and improving efficiency with Port Optimizer™, a cloud-based software initiative integrating data from across the port ecosystem. It helps the supply chain monitor and respond to dynamic conditions, align people and resources, and proactively communicate across functions – enabling maximum port throughput and delivery performance.\n\nNot only does Port Optimizer™ improve efficiencies - it provides an opportunity for ports to differentiate themselves from their competitors. The timely sharing of accurate information about container moves, status changes, asset management, etc. across all port stakeholders is needed to better plan for operations. As a neutral party, Port Authorities can be the driving force to create a Digital Infrastructure for the collection, aggregation and standardization of data flowing through the port and to make that data readily available through APIs and various applications.\n\nWabtec is reducing port emissions with ShoreCONNECT, a flexible onshore power supply solution that connects electrical power to vessels at port, eliminating the need to use diesel. It connects one vessel to shore power with up to 16 MVA high voltage, self-propelled, zero-emission vehicles.\n\nShoreCONNECT installations position ports to help address the required 40 percent reduction in CO2 emissions from ships by 2030 and support the local sulfur emission control area established in the Baltic region. In addition, ShoreCONNECT helps to reduce noise pollution in ports because the engines are turned off while the vessels are connected."
