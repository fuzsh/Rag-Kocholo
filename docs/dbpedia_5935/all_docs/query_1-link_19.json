To request an application, contact WSTA at: (336)727-2000. Following approval of your application for the half-fare bus program, you will be provided with a temporary Half-Fare ID card. Before your temporary ID card expires, please contact WSTA’s ADA Compliance office at 336-727-2000 to schedule an appointment to have your permanent picture ID taken.\n\n​\n\nPurchase and use of discount passes requires presentation of a free WSTA-issued identification card, any Medicare card or a Senior Citizens Card issued by the City of Winston-Salem; which must be presented as proper documentation when you board the bus.\n\nAn ID card from another transit system showing you are eligible for half fare is accepted for 30 days; prior to its expiration, passengers must complete a WSTA Half Fare Bus Services Application."
