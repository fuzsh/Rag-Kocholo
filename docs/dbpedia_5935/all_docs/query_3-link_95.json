I am aware that I can purchase a Navigo Easy travel card and load t+ tickets or day tickets on it, and top up via NFC from my smartphone. However, I am wondering if I can directly use my smartphone (iPhone 13 Pro Max, iOS 16) to store and validate tickets.\n\nAccording to the website of Île-de-France Mobilités, this should be possible using the IDF Mobilités app:\n\nYou can also buy your tickets and validate them on your smartphone\n\nOn the \"Purchase\" tab of the IDF Mobilités application, choose the option \"on my phone\", then select your ticket and, if necessary, the date, zones, number required.\n\nYou must have a credit card for payment and enter an email address to which proof of purchase will be sent. This address is pre-filled if you are connected to Navigo Connect.\n\nRegarding compatibility, for iPhones, it says:\n\nThe service is compatible with iPhones from the iPhone 7 with at least iOS 13, or iOS 14.5 for iPhones XR, XS and XS Max.\n\nI realize that this does not mention the latest models, and so could be the answer to my question, but I have seen that compatibility lists are often out of date on many websites, even if the newest models are supported. So I am nevertheless asking to check just in case I am doing something incorrectly instead.\n\nAfter downloading the app, I see no option (\"on my phone\", as mentioned above) to buy tickets. The following is the screenshot:\n\nSo is this possible?"
