        "text": "What you need to know:\n\n- E-tickets are available for the period before the Olympics and during the Olympics\n\n- Eiffel Tower closed on July 26\n\n- Usual opening hours during the Olympic Games\n\nParis has undergone a major transformation to host the Paris 2024 Olympics and Paralympics. This also means that certain adjustments are required for getting around the city, for both Parisians and visitors. The same applies for coming to visit the Eiffel Tower and its restaurants.\n\nThat said, the monument will still be welcoming visitors in almost-normal conditions. In July, the Eiffel Tower and the restaurants will be open every day, except for July 14 (and in the morning of July 15) due to preparations for the Bastille Day fireworks, and July 26, the day of the Opening Ceremony of the Olympics.\n\nImportant resources\n\nMake sure you always plan your trips by public transport, using the following websites and preparing your route:\n\nIle-de-France Mobilités\n\nRATP\n\nFor information regarding the impacts of the Olympic Games on traffic in Paris and any other information on the organization before and during the Paris 2024 Olympic Games :\n\nThe \"Anticiper les Jeux\" website (in French)\n\nThe city of Paris website\n\nThe Paris 2024 website\n\nJuly 27 to August 11, 2024\n\nThe Eiffel Tower and its restaurants will welcome visitors during the Olympics, in the usual opening hours. E-tickets for visits during this period are available. To visit the Eiffel Tower, if online tickets are sold out, it will be possible to buy tickets at the Tower's ticket offices on the day of your visit.\n\nPlan your movements around Paris, as certain metro and RER stations will be closed, and adapt your trips to avoid the heart of Paris (Champs-Elysées – Tuilerie – Concorde).\n\nAround the Eiffel Tower, the metro stations (Bir Hakeim on line 6; Ecole Militaire on line 8; Trocadéro on line 9) and the RER C station (Champ de Mars – Tour Eiffel) should normally be served. If there are Olympic events occurring near the Eiffel Tower at the time of your visit, this may impact the number of people on public transport or traffic volumes in the vicinity of the Tower.\n\nAugust 28 to September 8, 2024\n\nDuring the Paralympics, the Tower and the restaurants will welcome visitors every day, with normal operating conditions and visitor numbers for the season."
