        "text": "WILTON – Even if you’ve won four Oscars for Best Director (more than anyone else), you had to start somewhere.\n\nSee the very first Westerns helmed by John Ford, who would later win multiple Academy Awards, in the next installment of the Town Hall Theatre’s summer salute to silent film westerns.\n\n“Straight Shooting” (1917) and “Hell Bent” (1918), both directed by Ford when he was in his early 20s, will be shown as a double feature on Sunday, Aug. 8 at 2 p.m.\n\nThe screening is free and open to the public; a donation of $10 per person is suggested to support the Town Hall Theatre’s silent film programming.\n\nThe program will feature live music by silent film accompanist Jeff Rapsis.\n\n“Both of these early John Ford Westerns are more than a century old,” said Rapsis. “They didn’t need to pretend to be in the ‘Old West’ because it was there all around them.”\n\nCritics regard “Straight Shooting” as a landmark in the history of the Western. The first feature directed by Ford, it revived the career of early superstar Harry Carey, who gives a rough and tumble performance as a hired gun who turns on his employers to defend an innocent farmer and his family.\n\nIn “Hell Bent,” “Cheyenne Harry” (Harry Carey playing the same character from Straight Shooting) flees the law after a poker game shootout, and arrives in the town of Rawhide, where he becomes friendly with local cowboy Cimarron Bill and dance hall girl Bess Thurston.\n\nWhen gang leader Beau Ross kidnaps Bess, Harry goes to desperate lengths travelling across the deadly desert in order to free Bess from her hard-bitten captor.\n\n“Cheyenne Harry” is a role Carey would play into the 1930s, an amiable antihero who pals around with outlaws but who really has a heart of gold. Carey’s work was a pivotal influence on John Wayne, a later Ford collaborator.\n\nCarey’s rugged frame and craggy features were well suited to westerns and outdoor adventures. When sound films arrived, Carey displayed an assured, gritty baritone voice that suited his rough-hewn screen personality.\n\nNewsletter"
