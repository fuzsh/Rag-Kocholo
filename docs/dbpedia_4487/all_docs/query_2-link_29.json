Gavin Newsom on Monday to establish worker safety standards on motion picture productions.\n\nSenate Bill 132 incorporated legislation put forth by Senator Dave Cortese (D-San Jose) and is the result of two years' worth of negotiations between studios and labor representatives, he said.\n\nThe legislation follows the 2021 death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of \"Rust\" after she was shot and killed by a prop gun.\n\nThe law clarifies safety standards and calls for mandatory guidelines around the use of firearms and ammunition on sets. There must be minimum training standards for people who oversee firearms on set, as well.\n\nSafety standards in the bill apply to film, TV, streaming and other productions, Cortese's office said."
