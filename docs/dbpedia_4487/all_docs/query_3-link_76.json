        "text": "Films of John Ford\n\nKey Films in Ford's Oeuvre\n\nHome\n\nTop 10\n\nA favorite of filmmakers, critics, and audiences alike, John Ford is one of film history's most revered directors. Eighteen of Ford's films appear on the Top 1,000 Greatest Films (They Shoot Pictures, Don't They?), ten of which appear in the top 500 (The Grapes of Wrath (#119), How Green Was My Valley (#367), The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (#85), My Darling Clementine (#86), The Quiet Man (#188), The Searchers (#7), She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (#415), Stagecoach (#101), They Were Expendable (#362), and Young Mr. Lincoln (#491)) .\n\nFord tackled many genres throughout his career, but he is most remembered for his Westerns, such as The Searchers, My Darling Clementine, and Stagecoach. Though he is often regarded as the single most influential director in shaping the classic Hollywood Western, Ford subverted many of the myths and cliches perpetuated by the classic Western with The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. The Quiet Man is another notable Ford film because he had felt a strong personal connection to the Irish story and had wanted to make the film for many years.\n\nDirector John Ford and actors Jimmy Stewart and John Wayne on the set of The Man\n\nWho Shot Liberty Valance (1962). Stewart and Wayne were two of Ford's favorite act-\n\nors to work with.\n\nKeaton Kolbe's Top 10 Ford Films\n\n1. My Darling Clementine (1946)\n\n2. They Were Expendable (1945)\n\n3.
