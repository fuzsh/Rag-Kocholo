        "text": "SHARE\n\nIn recent years, New Mexico has taken important steps to improve its gun laws, but still has significant room for improvement when it comes to fighting gun violence.\n\nIn 2019, New Mexico enacted laws requiring a background check for nearly all firearm sales and prohibiting many people subject to domestic violence convictions or court orders from accessing guns. In 2022, New Mexico had the third highest gun death rate among the states. In an average year, 507 people die from gun violence in the state. That means someone dies from gun violence every 17 hours. Fifty-eight percent of those deaths are gun suicides, and 35% are gun homicides. In New Mexico, the rate of gun deaths increased 76% from 2013 to 2022, compared to a 36% increase nationwide.\n\nWhat New Mexico Does Well\n\nUniversal background checks\n\nExtreme risk protection orders\n\nCertain domestic violence gun laws\n\nChild access prevention law\n\nWhat New Mexico Is Missing\n\nGun owner licensing\n\nAssault weapon restrictions\n\nStrong concealed carry law\n\nOpen carry regulations\n\nCommunity violence intervention funding\n\nLost & stolen firearm reporting\n\nSPOTLIGHT\n\nGUN LAW SCORECARD\n\nThe data is clear: states with stronger gun laws have less gun violence.
