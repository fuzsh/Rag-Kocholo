        "text": "On this page\n\nImporting\n\nExporting\n\nImporting\n\nFirearms\n\nNote\n\nGlobal Affairs Canada has recently changed its policy on the importation of handguns into Canada.\n\nAs of August 19, 2022, all individuals and businesses importing a restricted handgun into Canada require an import permit issued by Global Affairs Canada.\n\nPlease provide a copy of the Import Permit with your registration application.\n\nThe Canada Border Services Agency controls firearms imports.\n\nAs a general rule, you are not allowed to carry handguns for self-protection in Canada. Non-residents can usually bring a non-restricted rifle or shotgun into Canada for approved purposes such as hunting, target shooting, wilderness protection or in-transit movement by a reasonably direct route to another point outside Canada.\n\nIf you want to bring a firearm into Canada, you must follow the laws of\n\nCanada\n\nImporting and Exporting Firearms, Weapons and Devices, Canada Border Services Agency\n\nImport Controls and Import Permits, Global Affairs Canada\n\nCriminal Code\n\nFirearms Act\n\nthe country where the firearm is coming from\n\nany other country the firearm will pass through\n\nYou can get information on the laws of another country by contacting authorities in that country or their embassy in Canada.\n\nNon-restricted Firearms\n\nYou must\n\nbe at least 18 years old\n\nhave a valid Possession and Acquisition Licence (PAL) permitting you to have the class of firearm that you want to import\n\nverify if you need an import authorization from the country that is exporting the firearm. For more information, contact Global Affairs Canada (GAC), the authorities of the exporting country, or their embassy in Canada.\n\nNon-residents can usually bring a non-restricted rifle or shotgun into Canada for approved purposes such as hunting, target shooting, wilderness protection or in-transit movement by a reasonably direct route to another point outside Canada.\n\nRestricted Firearms\n\nYou must\n\nbe at least 18 years old\n\nhave a valid Possession and Acquisition Licence permitting you to have the class of firearm that you want to import\n\nhave the firearm verified\n\nmake sure the firearm is registered with the Canadian Firearms Program (CFP)\n\napply for an Authorization to Transport (ATT) in advance from the Chief Firearms Officer (CFO) of the province/territory where you will be bringing it into Canada\n\nverify if you need an authorization from the country that is exporting the firearm. For more information, contact Global Affairs Canada (GAC), the authorities of the exporting country, or their embassy in Canada.\n\nNote\n\nThe CFP must verify and register a restricted firearm before the Chief Firearms Officer will issue an Authorization to Transport for it. Generally, you can only import restricted firearms (handguns and some semi-automatic long guns) only if you can demonstrate a need for having the firearms in Canada, such as for example to take part participating in an organized target-shooting event.\n\nProhibited Firearms\n\nYou cannot bring a prohibited firearm into Canada as a new import, even if you have a licence to have that class of firearm.\n\nThis includes air soft guns that meet the definition of a replica firearm., because these are prohibited. Replica firearms are those that resemble a real firearm with near precision but that cannot cause serious injury or death. Many of these firearms have to be assessed on a case- by- case basis to determine if they are replicas. However, Canada Border Services Agency controls the importation of air soft guns that are not replicas. For more information, please contact the Canada Border Services Agency.\n\nIf a prohibited firearm was temporarily taken out of Canada, it can be re-imported. You must have\n\na valid licence permitting you to have theat firearm\n\na valid Canadian registration certificate for the firearm\n\na Canadian import authorization\n\nan authorization (if required) from the country that is exporting the firearm. For more information, contact Global Affairs Canada (GAC), and the authorities of the exporting country or their embassy in Canada.\n\nIf you took the firearm out of Canada, a customs officer may ask to see a copy of your export permit if when you bring it back to Canada.\n\nNote\n\nIndividuals cannot import replica firearms. A licensed business may be able to import replica firearms for an approved purpose, including such as for use in a film or theatrical production.\n\nShipping a firearm to Canada\n\nA licensed carrier company under the Firearms Act must handle firearms that are shipped to someone in Canada.\n\nThe licensed carrier must ship firearms in a sturdy, non-transparent container. The container should be hard to break into and should not break open accidentally during transport.\n\nThe outside of the container should not have any marking to say that there are firearms inside, unless the marking is an address.\n\nThe CFP recommends you label an envelope \"Customs Documents\" and attach it firmly to the outside of the container. You can put any waybills, import permits, or export permits into the envelope.\n\nYou must declare all firearms at Canada Customs and pay applicable duties and taxes.\n\nMore information is available on the Canada Border Services Agency website.\n\nParts and ammunition\n\nUnder Canadian law, you do not need a valid firearms licence to import non-prohibited firearm parts (except for a frame or receiver). However, you may need an export permit from the other country.\n\nYou cannot import into Canada\n\nprohibited ammunition\n\nfirearm parts that are classified as prohibited devices\n\nThis includes handgun barrels that are 105 mm or less in length or parts made exclusively for a fully automatic firearm.\n\nThe Explosives Act limits on the amount of ammunition and ammunition components that you can import without an import permit. Generally, the Explosives Act allows you to import up to 5,000 cartridges of non-prohibited ammunition for personal use. However, you may need an import permit for smaller amounts to comply with the laws of the exporting country.\n\nMore information is available on the Natural Resources Canada website.\n\nYou can also contact the Canada Border Services Agency at 1-800-461-9999 for information on declaration procedures and on applicable duty and taxes.\n\nExporting\n\nNon-restricted Firearms\n\nIf you want to export a firearm from out of Canada to another country, you must follow the laws of\n\nCanada – under Canadian law, you may need an export permit. Contact Global Affairs Canada at 343-203-4331 for more information.\n\nthe country where the firearm is exported – you may need an import permit\n\nany other country the firearm will pass through\n\nNote\n\nIn the United States, the relevant laws may vary from state to state. You cannot ship a firearm to another country using Canada Post. You must use, a licensed carrier company to transport firearms under the Firearms Act.\n\nRestricted and Prohibited Firearms\n\nYou must\n\nchange the records so that you are listed as the registered owner. To change the records, you will need\n\nfull name\n\naddress\n\nfirearm licence number\n\nfirearm registration certificate number\n\nfirearm identification number\n\nproof that the firearm has been permanently exported from Canada (for example, a copy of a Canadian export permit, or the other country's import document)\n\ncontact Global Affairs Canada at 343-203-4331 to verify if you need an export permit; the Global Affairs Canada website has information on applying for an import or an export permit for controlled goods, such as firearms or ammunition.\n\nSend this information with a cover letter to:\n\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police\n\nCanadian Firearms Program\n\nPO Box 1200\n\nMiramichi, New Brunswick E1N 5Z3\n\nNote\n\nIf you are a non-resident with restricted or prohibited firearms registered in Canada, you must notify the Registrar of Firearms at the above address if you dispose of any of your registered or prohibited firearms."
