        "text": "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is sometimes seen as being an uncharacteristically pessimistic film by John Ford. It is not exactly that. As the title promises, the movie’s leading threat will be removed. Law and order is established in the frontier town of Shinbone. In these respects, the story is more conclusive and upbeat than the end of some Ford movies – The Grapes of Wrath, Two Rode Together or How Green Was My Valley, to name a few.\n\nStill there is an undeniable tinge of bitter sadness about Ford’s last great western. (He made other westerns, but Liberty Valance was arguably the last great one.) The director who had spent so many years cultivating the traditional myths about how the west was won is here challenging those very myths.\n\nA man founds his reputation on performing a deed he could not achieve in reality, and another man dies in obscurity, his important role in the development of his town forgotten. This is not exactly undeserved. It is the best result that there can be for the good of the town. But it is not fair either, and this injustice takes something away from the final victory.\n\nPerhaps this is why the film is shot in black-and-white, the appropriate cinematic language for establishing something stark, the colour removed from the events that take place. Here is history how it happened, and not what the books say. The black-and-white photography gives a greater impression of seeing the real history of the age. (Of course the film is only replacing the existing myths with another one, but we are asked to suspend disbelief on this part.)\n\nActually it is a mystery why Liberty Valance was not filmed in colour. Ford claimed that he preferred black-and-white, and that the final showdown with Valance would not have worked in colour. Yet Ford had been making westerns in colour throughout the 1950s. Ford made excellent westerns in black-and-white, notably Stagecoach and My Darling Clementine, but he also worked well in colour, as The Searchers showed.\n\nPerhaps the decision was made to cut costs, but Ford was a profitable director, and he continued to make movies in colour later. Besides the cost of colour movies was coming down, and by 1962 the majority of films were made in colour. This was the last time that Ford would make a movie in black-and-white.\n\nA more cynical theory is that Ford was seeking to disguise the age of his leading stars. James Stewart and John Wayne were near to the age of their characters when the story begins, but too old to play their younger selves in the flashback that occupies most of the film. In any case, we only see Wayne as a ‘young’ man. No wonder Ford was not keen to have Wayne on the cast, despite the two having worked together many times. He resented Wayne being foisted on him by the studio, and lost few opportunities to taunt the unfortunate actor.\n\nWe do not see John Wayne in the framing story that is set many years later because his character is already dead when the film begins. It was a rarity for audiences to see a movie where John Wayne dies, although this would become a more frequent occurrence in the star’s final movies. Even in this film he does not die on screen.\n\nThe movie begins instead with the aftermath of the death of John Wayne’s character, Tom Doniphon. The small town of Shinbone is excited by the arrival of two former residents, Ranse Stoddard (James Stewart) and his wife, Hallie (Vera Miles). Stoddard is now a Senator, and this makes his arrival big news. As is appropriate for a man whose name is associated with progress, Stoddard arrives by train, that great symbol of change in westerns.\n\nReporters from the local paper are eager to interview the Senator about his visit, and are bemused to learn that he is here to pay his respects to an unknown resident, Tom Doniphon, who recently died in humble circumstances, his shoes stolen from him. Stoddard finds the old stagecoach on which he first arrived in the town, and this prompts him to give his story to the reporters concerning his time in Shinbone and his relationship with Doniphon.\n\nStoddard comes to Shinbone fresh from law school, but even before arriving in the town he has his first encounter with the enemy of the law that he represents. The stagecoach is held up by Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin), a notorious outlaw. Valance is a formidable figure, a sadistic bully who carries a whip which he employs on Stoddard when the defiant law graduate threatens to put Valance in jail.\n\nNot that there would be much chance of putting Valance in prison at this point. Everyone in the town is frightened of the vicious thug. In any case, the law is represented by Marshal Link Appleyard (Andy Devine), a feeble cowardly officer who is fonder of eating than he is of studying his legal statutory powers.\n\nAppleyard protests, “You folks all know that, well, the jail’s only got one cell, and the lock’s broke, and l sleep in it.” I do not wish to ruin the film by revealing too much, but I think I am not spoiling anything if I say that Appleyard will not be the man who shoots Liberty Valance, and he will not be on the scene to support Stoddard either.\n\nThere is only one man in Shinbone who is not afraid of Valance, and that is Tom Doniphon. Doniphon is a prominent townsman, and a distinctly unpolished figure. He sneers at Stoddard for getting whipped while standing up for a lady. He is prepared to defy Valance and chase him out of the local tavern, but only with the help of a gun of course.\n\nGuns are an essential part of life in Shinbone. Here they represent something more than just weapons – they stand for the right and the need to assert oneself with force if one is to make any kind of stand in the town. I could more generally say that the guns need not symbolise anything in the film. Guns have always been an important and controversial part of the American way of life, protected by the Second Amendment of the Constitution.\n\nTo this day, Americans argue about how far citizens should have the right to own a gun, and this debate can be found in Liberty Valance. Stoddard is opposed to the use of guns, but Doniphon tells him, “l know those law books mean a lot to you, but not out here. Out here, a man settles his own problems.”\n\nIn a sense Doniphon’s attitudes are not far removed from those of Valance. Both believe that brute force, backed by guns, is the way to resolve issues. However this approach is at odds with the kind of civilising world that Stoddard is fighting for. He wishes to establish a new order based on justice and due legal procedure.\n\nThis has the effect of making Stoddard seem the weaker figure. This conflict between the strong conservative and weaker liberal can be found in many Ford movies, including The Searchers, Horse Soldiers and Two Rode Together. Ford seems to express his preference by making the conservative figure seem tougher and more admirable, but he does at least express the issue as a debate in all his films, suggesting that he was not entirely certain which attitude was the right one.\n\nStoddard certainly seems to cut a feeble figure at the beginning of the story. Not yet ready to practise law, he makes a living as a humble dishwasher wearing an apron. This makes him seem emasculated next to the macho Doniphon. When Valance starts to become a threat to him, Stoddard attempts to learn how to shoot, but a shooting lesson with Doniphon ends in farce when Doniphon seeks to humiliate the other man.\n\nHowever Doniphon is agreeably surprised when Stoddard responds by felling him with a hefty punch. Indeed Stoddard proves to have more of a punch than expected in other areas too. Stoddard seems determined to take Shinbone by sap rather than by storm. He rises from dishwasher to lawyer to governor to senator through intelligence and his use of the law.\n\nOne of the first stages in his attempt to bring progress to the town is by running reading lessons. He begins by teaching Hallie how to read, and he soon finds himself running a class for people of all ages. In the process, Stoddard is able to promote his own values in class, so the tuition also includes lessons on the law and the constitution.\n\nAs Hallie ignores Doniphon’s attempts to make her give up her education, we see that her loyalties are transferring from Doniphon to Stoddard. This is one of the movie’s sadder moments, as Doniphon has been convinced that he would marry Hallie, and has been building an extension to his house so that she will have a new room and porch when they marry. Ultimately as Doniphon’s dreams fall down around him, he burns down the house where he had hoped they would live.\n\nHallie’s shift in allegiance reflects the changing priorities in the whole town e. It is a necessary move towards peaceful and democratic values, but it comes at a cost to a way of life. Similarly Halle cannot help suffering the loss of part of herself when she gives up Doniphon for Stoddard. It is a sacrifice for her too. She chooses one and is happy with her choice, but she grieves the loss of the other.\n\nStoddard takes his crusading campaign in other areas too. It is not for nothing that Doniphon calls him Pilgrim (this phrase has come to be associated with John Wayne, but its first use was in Liberty Valance, and it was applied to a man who really did have a crusading zeal.) Before long, Stoddard is meddling in other concerns. He flatters the local newspaper editor, Dutton Peabody (Edmond O’Brien), causing Peabody to take the risky decision to report news about Valance’s killings and the battle for statehood.\n\nTo promote his legal practice, Stoddard makes a shingle advertising himself as a lawyer, which is advertised by Peabody, and the two men agree to run as delegates in the battle for statehood. This move towards statehood is an important one, as it signals a move from the powerful landowners who control affairs at the butt of a gun to a more central governance of the area. It offers a chance for people of all kinds to get a say in how affairs are run, even Swedish immigrants such as the Ericsons.\n\nI say everyone, but of course this is not true. One man remains outside the move towards freedom. This is Doniphon’s loyal servant, Pompey (Woody Strode). As a black man, he is still not allowed to drink in the town’s bars. He is forced to sit outside while the townsfolk hold a meeting about statehood. He tries to attend Stoddard’s reading classes, where he is tellingly unable to remember the line in the constitution about all men being created equal, but his learning is soon cut short by Doniphon, who orders him back to work. The time has not yet come when black people would win the same rights as everyone else.\n\nIt is appropriate that this film was made mostly on studio sets, rather than out in the open like a number of John Ford westerns. This is not a film about life in the outdoors. It is about what goes on behind the scenes, and how it is here that many of the important decisions are made concerning the future of the country. The location also adds a sense of claustrophobia to the movie, because sooner or later Stoddard’s reform campaign is going to cause him to come into conflict with Liberty Valance.\n\nValance’s name may be Liberty, but he is a threat to the new liberties that Stoddard is trying to found. Valance represents an older concept of liberty, the kind supported by libertarians today, which opposes statism and government. It is the liberty of anarchy, and also of fascism, of lawlessness on the one hand, and of imposing one’s own laws on the other.\n\nStoddard’s arch-enemy is on hand to oppose all his attempts to reform this little town. Valance is the gunman who supports the ranch holders who oppose Stoddard’s campaign for statehood. The outlaw disrupts the election of the delegates for the state, and tries to get himself elected, by threatening those who vote for Stoddard and Peabody.\n\nLater Peabody is brutally assaulted and left for dead by Valance, who destroys the press office in retaliation for the reporting of his crimes. Stoddard’s shingle advertising himself as an attorney at law is shot to pieces by Valance. The outlaw insists on a showdown with the attorney, and the issue can only be settled with guns.\n\nIf freedom to vote, freedom of the press and equality under the law are to be protected, then Stoddard must confront this upholder of a conflicting view of liberty – the liberty of the strong over the weak – and a showdown is inevitable. It is here that the issue of guns and force is shown to be a moral dilemma for the town, and by extension the whole country.\n\nFord’s story is ambivalent. Stoddard is opposed to weapons, but ultimately there is a point when even democracy must be maintained at the butt of a gun. The traditional ruthless mavericks may be dangerous for the rights of all, like Valance, but they may also be the people who do most to help maintain this new order, like Doniphon, a man who feels strangely protective towards his rival in spite of, perhaps because of, Hallie.\n\nGuns are essential in establishing Stoddard’s new world, whether he likes it or not, but their importance must fade if those values of freedom and genuine liberty are to be maintained. The Valances of the world must be removed, and the Doniphons too must die in obscurity if the country is to move on.\n\nNonetheless Ford’s heart still seems to lie more with Doniphon than Stoddard. Stoddard gets it all – statehood, a position as senator, and the girl, yet it feels as if he somehow got it all through an act of deceit. The new politicians may be an improvement on what went on before, but this is a world built on lies. The age of Valance and Doniphon may have passed, and rightly so, but we have lost something with its passing.\n\nThis is something we glimpse when we watch Major Cassius Starbuckle (John Carradine) deliver an insincere oration in which he pretends to throw away a prepared speech, which turns out to have been a blank piece of paper anyway. Stoddard tries to tell the truth at the end of the film, but the newspaper editor Maxwell Scott (Carleton Young) refuses to use the story: “When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.”"
