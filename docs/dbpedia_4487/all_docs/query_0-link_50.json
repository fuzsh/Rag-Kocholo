He finds refuge with a band of Indians, but then clashes over an Indian girl (May) with Black Michael (Harris), leader of a gang of whiskey runners. Harry's real love is with Kate (Gerber), daughter of local trader Angus McDougal (Fenton). However, his rival here is also Black Michael. Michael kills an Indian and abducts Kate, but Harry follows and rescues her.

The story was an uncommon collaboration between the star Harry Carey and the director John Ford (with help from scenarist Eugene Lewis). Though it has an unusually high level of violence (\"lots of killings\", as Moving Picture World noted), critical reviews of the time lavishly praised both the story and film.[2]\n\nPlot\n\nHarry's bride is murdered at their wedding along with Harry's mother and father, and the good-hearted outlaw turns grimly malevolent. He leaves town, only to return one year later. One by one he stalks his wife's killers, dispatching them all until he finally sets his sights, mistakenly, on Sheriff Gale Thurman. The lawman bests Harry and keeps him hiding outside town in the wilderness. Straying into the same wilderness, the Sheriff's girlfriend is first overtaken by highwaymen, then rescued by Harry, only to be taken captive by Harry when he realizes who she is. At first threatening to harm the girl, Harry slowly falls in love with her, all while hostile Apaches attempt to kill them both. By the time the Sheriff tracks them down, a full-scale assault is under way, and the two men join forces. Harry realizes the Sheriff's innocence, but it is too late: the lawman is dead from his battle wounds, but he has saved his girlfriend - and Harry.\n\nCast\n\n· Harry Carey as Cheyenne Harry\n\n· Seena Owen as The Girl\n\n· Joe Harris as Gale Thurman (as Joseph Harris)\n\n· J.

The film is considered to be lost. The screenplay is based upon the 1869 story of the same name by Bret Harte. Harte's story has been filmed at least five times, including in 1937 and in 1952 .\n\nPlot\n\nAs described in a film magazine,[2] Square Shootin' Harry Lanyon (Carey), proprietor of a gambling hall in Arizona, is in love with his ward Ruth Watson (Hope). However, he believes that she is in love with his pal Billy Lanyon (Landis), and intends to let the youth have the girl. While in this uncertain mind about his own love affair, Harry begins to read Bret Harte's story \"The Outcasts of Poker Flat\" and begins to liken himself to John Oakhurst in the story. Oakhurst (Carey) befriends a girl named Sophy (Hope) on a riverboat. The girl is being deserted by a gambler named Ned Stratton (Harris), who had promised to marry her, and Oakhurst saves her from self-destruction. Oakhurst brings Sophy to the questionable neighborhood of Poker Flat, and encourages her to marry some youth who loves her, although Oakhurst also cares for her. Stratton reappears and Oakhurst makes it his business to rid the camp of him. Later, the Vigilantes swoop down upon Poker Flat and, in a reform movement, send Oakhurst, Mother Shipton, the Duchess, and others into the hills. Sophy and her young husband follow. They are all caught in a violent storm from which only the latter two emerge alive. Harry Lanyon is impressed with the Bret Harte story, and vows that he will not repeat the mistake of Oakhurst and in sacrificing his love for another. Harry then discovers that Ruth loves him and not Billy after all.\n\nCast\n\n· Harry Carey as Square Shootin' Harry Lanyon / John Oakhurst\n\n· Cullen Landis as Billy Lanyon / Tommy Oakhurst\n\n· Gloria Hope as Ruth Watson / Sophy, the girl\n\n· Joseph Harris as Ned Stratton\n\n· Virginia Chester\n\n· Duke R.
