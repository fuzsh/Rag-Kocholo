Hello,

I wonder if both sentences can be accepted:

I don't know who is the author. / I don't know who the author is.

I suppose the first mean I don't know the name of the author and the other means that I haven't met him/her or don't know wanything about him/her apart from the name. Am I right?

Accepted ... by whom? Your English teacher won't accept the first one; someone simply reading both sentences might not accept the first one either (as you've seen in this thread).

In linguistics talk, what you have here is an embedded question, an embedded questions have their own syntax. In direct questions (also known as wh- questions) a "wh- word" is placed at the front, and then the subject and auxiliary verb undergo inversion (they switch places): Who is the author?

In embedded questions, no wh- word is introduced (because there is already a wh- word), and there is no subject-auxiliary verb inversion: I don't know who the author is.

That's syntax/grammar, and that's what teachers/grammar books teach.

Embedded questions are understood to be rhetorical. In speech, however, proper intonation can turn an embedded/rhetorical question into a direct question. In terms of pragmatics, I don't know who is the author means the same as "who is the author?" In other words, I don't know who is the author seeks information and is no longer "rhetorical." But for this to work, it's got to be speech, and you need to have the right intonation (intonation is always context dependent).

As an English learner, I'd first worry about getting the syntax right (I don't know who the author is), and I'd leave pragmatics for later (when I've mastered the language sufficiently).
