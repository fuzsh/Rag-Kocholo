Anthony Quinn

Anthony Quinn (b. 1971) is an Irish author and journalist. Born in Northern Ireland’s County Tyrone, Quinn majored in English at Queen’s University, Belfast. After college, he worked a number of odd jobs—social worker, organic gardener, yoga teacher—before finding work as a journalist. He has written short stories for years, winning critical acclaim and, twice, a place on the short list for the Hennessy/New Irish Writing Award. His food writing saw him finish as the runner-up in a Sunday Times competition.

Disappeared is his first novel. He is currently working on a sequel, Border Angels, which will also feature Inspector Celcius Daly. Quinn continues his work as a journalist, reporting on the county of his birth for the Tyrone Times. You can find his website at this link.

Quinn enriches Disappeared with Irish history and he does an excellent job of ratcheting up the tension as this yarn progresses. - The Rap Sheet

Quinn has developed a plot that immerses the reader into a darkness we have only read about in the papers or seen on the late night news. - The Morris Chair

Celcius Daly is a decent, hardworking police officer in a world that seems dead-set against him. His hard work and determination to get to the truth, no matter what the costs are, are admirably heroic qualities and make him a most agreeable protagonist. - At the Scene of the Crime
