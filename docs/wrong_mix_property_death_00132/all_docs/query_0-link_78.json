        "text": "My Greek Books\n\nGreek-American Author Harry Mark Petrakis has passed on, but he left an enduring legacy. His books brought Greek-Americans to the mainstream. Gave us a voice. His stories were quintessential Chicago. I’ve often waxed poetic about my literary idol. I’m blessed to have communicated with him. I’ll miss his emails. I can still hear his voice on the other end of the phone. Did I look up to this man? Absolutely. Beyond his subject matter, his rich words are a literary treasure trove for any writer and reader. His stories touched the heart and left an indelible mark. He’ll never be forgotten.\n\nI thought it a good time to pay a humble tribute to the late author. I tried to find all the book reviews, all the interviews, and they seem to be scattered among devices. And the earliest ones were in print only. Since the early 2000s, I’d written about the author for several publications, including The Greek Star newspaper, The National Herald, GreekReporter, and later for my own WindyCity Greek magazine.\n\nAre you on my email list?

In a 2010 interview, I asked Petrakis about it. He said the lead character Matsoukas, “was one of my favorites. I revisited him in the sequel, Ghost of the Sun. Quinn loved it and tried for two years to get it produced, but it never materialized.”\n\nFirst published work\n\nAmong his most famous works is his first published short story, “Pericles on 31st Street.” I asked him about this in a long-ago interview. Here’s what he had to say.\n\n“After many years of trials and tribulations, in 1957, the short story “Pericles on 31st Street” appeared in Atlantic Monthly. Back then I was selling real estate; things were tough. I got a note that they were buying ’Pericles’. There was a furry of excitement. I remember I sat down and began to cry—for so many things—for writing, for more. My father had died; he had great faith that this would happen, but he wasn’t there to see it. After many years of sacrifice, it was finally happening.”\n\n~ Harry Mark Petrakis, 2010\n\nThis story launched an amazing career and made him one of Chicago’s best-known authors.\n\nMaria A.
