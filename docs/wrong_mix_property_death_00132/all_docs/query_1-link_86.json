        "text": "Anthony's latest book, 'Blind Arrows,' published by No Exit Press earlier this year, is set during the Irish War of Independence and features Republican leader Michael Collins and a sadistic serial killer. It is a tale of political intrigue, secrets and treachery.\n\nâ€‹\n\nHe is also author of 'Disappeared,' which was selected as one of the five best debut novels of 2012 by book critics of major newspapers including The Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post and The Guardian. It was nominated for the Strand Critics Debut Novel Award, the only crime fiction award to be judged solely by book critics.\n\nPrevious nominees for the Strand Award have included Stieg Larsson, Lee Child, PD James and Michael Connelly.\n\nBorn in 1971 in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, and after completing an English literature degree at Queen's University, Anthony followed various callings - including social worker, counsellor, lecturer, organic market gardener and yoga teacher - before becoming a journalist. His stories have been short-listed twice for a Hennessy/New Irish Writing Award. Reflecting his diversity of his writing interests, Anthony was also runner-up in the Sunday Times New Food Writer competition."
