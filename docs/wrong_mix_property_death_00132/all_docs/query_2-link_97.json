        "text": "Helen lives in the countryside just outside Sheffield with her comedian husband, two children and two lovely dogs, Ronnie and Billy Whizz. When she is not tapping away in her writing room, she loves walking the dogs, playing board games and reading.\n\nBefore writing her first novel Helen wrote and performed her work on the stage. She has even done some stand up comedy (which was some of the inspiration for The Boy Who Made Everyone Laugh!) and before that she was a jobbing actress. If you look hard you could even spot her in old episodes of Coronation Street, Holby City and many other TV staples including adverts, film and voice over. Her very first role was playing Ruby in Jacqueline Wilson's Double Act, so maybe she was always destined to be involved with children's books!\n\nâ€‹"
