        "text": "PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP -- Anthony\n\nQuinn, the barrel-chested Oscar winner remembered for his roles as the earthy\n\nhero of ''Zorba the Greek'' and the fierce Bedouin leader in ''Lawrence of Arabia,''\n\nhas died. He was 86.\n\nMr. Quinn's death was reported by\n\nProvidence, R.I., Mayor Vincent ''Buddy'' Cianci, a friend of the actor. He\n\nsaid Quinn died of respiratory failure at a Boston hospital.\n\n''He was larger than life,'' Cianci\n\nsaid. ''I was proud to call him a friend.''\n\nMr. Quinn was living in Bristol,\n\nnear Providence.\n\nMr. Quinn, who appeared in more\n\nthan 100 feature films, won Academy Awards for ''Viva Zapata!'' and ''Lust for\n\nLife.''\n\nBorn in Mexico and raised in poverty\n\nin East Los Angeles, Mr. Quinn went from stage and B-movie roles to become an\n\ninternational leading man renowned for his big-man sensitivity and honest acting\n\nstyle.\n\nIn a film career that spanned more\n\nthan 50 years, Mr. Quinn portrayed characters ranging from kings to Indians,\n\nincluding a pope, a boxer and an artist.\n\n''I never get the girl,'' Mr. Quinn\n\nonce joked in an interview. ''I wind up with a country instead.''\n\nHe won his first Oscar for his work\n\nin the 1952 film ''Viva Zapata!'' as the brother of Mexican revolutionary leader\n\nEmiliano Zapata.\n\nTo many, Mr. Quinn's Oscar-nominated\n\ncharacterization of the Greek peasant Zorba from the Nikos Kazantzakis novel\n\nremained his most memorable role.\n\nThe Ouzo-drinking and bouzouki-dancing\n\nZorba was Mr. Quinn's favorite role as well, so much so that he returned to\n\nthe stage in 1983 in a revival of the musical inspired by the 1964 film.\n\nAs a child, he shined shoes, sold\n\npapers and preached with Aimee Semple McPherson. After working as a movie extra,\n\nhe met and married the adopted daughter of Cecil B. De Mille, Katherine.\n\nA real-life artist, sculptor and\n\nauthor, his role as painter Paul Gauguin in the 1956 film ''Lust for Life''\n\nearned him his second Oscar.\n\nLater, after leading roles became\n\nless frequent, he left Hollywood to live and work in Italy.\n\n''What could I play there? They\n\nonly think of me as a Mexican, an Indian or a Mafia don,'' he said in a 1977\n\ninterview with the Associated Press.\n\nHe was divorced from Katherine in\n\n1965 after he fathered two children with Italian costume designer Yolanda Addolari,\n\nsparking an international scandal.\n\nIn 1972, Mr. Quinn wrote his autobiography,\n\n''The Original Sin,'' which has been translated into more than 18 languages.\n\nHe followed with a second volume titled ''Suddenly Sunset.''\n\nThe characteristically straightforward\n\nactor shunned the use of ghost writers, favoring blunt honesty over Hollywood\n\nimage-making.\n\n''I could either lie or tell the\n\ntruth,'' he said. ''I figured the only value in such a book would be to describe\n\nmy life as I lived it.''\n\n(End of published text\n\nIn 1978, he played a character closely\n\nresembling the late shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis in ''The Greek Tycoon.''\n\nAs his film career slowed in recent\n\nyears, Quinn devoted most of his time to painting and sculpting.\n\nQuinn said in a 1987 interview that\n\nhe reached most of the goals he set for himself as a young boy.\n\n''I never satisfied that kid but\n\nI think he and I have made a deal now,'' he said, referring to his younger self.\n\n''It's like climbing a mountain: I didn't take him up Mount Everest, but I took\n\nhim up Mount Whitney.\n\n''And I think that's not bad.''\n\nPHOTO: QUINN:\n\n50-year\n\ncareer."
