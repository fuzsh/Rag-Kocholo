        "text": "1962-present\n\nLatest News: Suzanne Collins Writing New Hunger Games Book\n\nAuthor Suzanne Collins is expanding The Hunger Games universe.\n\nPublisher Scholastic announced Thursday that Collins’ fifth book in the popular dystopian series, Sunrise on the Reaping, will be available on March 18, 2025. In addition, Lionsgate will produce a film adaptation of the new novel to reach movie theaters on November 20, 2026.\n\nThe new title is set 40 years after the events of the most recent book in the series, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, and focuses on themes of misinformation and government influence. “I was inspired by David Hume’s idea of implicit submission and, in his words, ‘the easiness with which the many are governed by the few,’” Collins said in a statement. “The story also lent itself to a deeper dive into the use of propaganda and the power of those who control the narrative. The question ‘Real or not real?’ seems more pressing to me every day.”\n\nWho Is Suzanne Collins?\n\nSuzanne Collins is an American author who published her debut book, Gregor the Overlander, the first of the five-part The Underland Chronicles, in 2003. Five years later, in 2008, her first book of The Hunger Games series was published. The best-selling trilogy was adapted into a blockbuster film series starring Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen and later expanded to include a prequel book and film, The Ballad of Songbirds of Snakes, and a newly announced fifth novel in 2025.\n\nQuick Facts\n\nFULL NAME: Suzanne Collins\n\nBORN: August 10, 1962\n\nBIRTHPLACE: Hartford, Connecticut\n\nHUSBAND: Charles Pryor (m. 1992)\n\nCHILDREN: Charlie and Isabel\n\nASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Leo\n\nEarly Life\n\nThe youngest of four children, Suzanne Collins was born on August 10, 1962, in Hartford, Connecticut. The daughter of an Air Force officer, Michael J. Collins, and his wife Jane, Suzanne moved considerably during her childhood, living in places like New York City and Brussels.\n\nFor the Collins family, history was a critical topic. Much of that was driven by Collins’ father, who taught history at the college level and was open with his kids about his military experience, including his deployment to Vietnam.\n\n“I believe he felt a great responsibility and urgency about educating his children about war,” Collins said. “He would take us frequently to places like battlefields and war monuments. It would start back with whatever had precipitated the war and moved up through the battlefield you were standing in and through that and after that. It was a very comprehensive tour guide experience. So throughout our lives, we basically heard about war.”\n\nEventually, Collins and her family ended up in the South, where she graduated high school from the Alabama School of Fine Arts in 1980. Collins then enrolled at Indiana University, graduating in 1985 with a double major in theater and telecommunications. She then went on to earn a master’s degree in dramatic writing from New York University.\n\nTV Writing\n\nAfter graduating, Collins moved into television, writing for several children’s television programs, including Clarissa Explains It All and Little Bear. Her work for those shows soon caught the notice of James Proimos, creator of the WB children’s program Generation O!, who hired Collins as his head writer. A big fan of her writing, it was Proimos who urged Collins to try writing books.\n\nBooks: The Hunger Games and More\n\nIn 2003, Collins published Gregor the Overlander, the first book of The Underland Chronicles. The book tells the tale of a boy who discovers a vast new world when he accidentally falls through the grate of the laundry room in his New York City apartment building.\n\nGregor received critical success and became a New York Times best seller. The Underland Chronicles series comprised four additional books: Gregor and the Prophecy Bane, Gregor and the Curse of the Warmbloods, Gregor and the Marks of Secret, and Gregor and the Code of Claw.\n\nThe Hunger Games Trilogy and Movies\n\nSuzanne Collins and Jennifer Lawrence attend the premiere of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire in November 2013.\n\nWhile The Underland Chronicles made Collins a well-known author, her next series ratcheted up her celebrity status. As Collins later recalled, The Hunger Games trilogy was born while she watched television late one night. Flipping through the channels, Collins was suddenly struck by the lack of distinction between reality TV and coverage of the Iraq war: “We have so much programming coming at us all the time,” she says. “Is it too much? Are we becoming desensitized to the entire experience? ... I can’t believe a certain amount of that isn’t happening.”\n\nThe Hunger Games revolves around the series’ rebel heroine, Katniss Everdeen, who lives in the post-apocalyptic nation of Panem, formerly North America. In Panem, the Hunger Games are an annual event in which young boys and girls fight to the death in a televised battle.\n\nFor Collins, The Hunger Games and her other books touch on the subjects—necessary and unnecessary wars—that her father often discussed with her. “If we introduce kids to these ideas earlier, we could get a dialogue about war going earlier and possibly it would lead to more solutions,” she says. “I just feel it isn’t discussed, not the way it should be. ... I know from my experience that we are quite capable of understanding things and processing them at an early age.”\n\nThe series’ first book, The Hunger Games, was released in 2008. Its two sequels, Catching Fire and Mockingjay, were published in 2009 and 2010, respectively. The series became a huge success, selling more than 100 million copies worldwide.\n\nA film version of The Hunger Games, with a screenplay written by Collins, was released in 2012. Starring Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss, Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark, and Liam Hemsworth as Gale Hawthorne, the film grossed just under $700 million globally, paving the way for Catching Fire and the two-part Mockingjay over each of the next three years.\n\nPrequel: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes\n\nMay 2020 brought the highly anticipated release of The Hunger Games prequel, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. The book follows the rise of the series’ villain, Coriolanus Snow, his ambitions fueling the expansion of the Games from a minor curiosity into an all-consuming media spectacle.\n\nThe novel was adapted into a 2023 film, The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, starring Tom Blyth, Rachel Zegler, Hunter Schafer, and Peter Dinklage.\n\nOther Books: Charlie McButton and Year of the Jungle\n\nJust before the massive success of The Hunger Games, Collins wrote a children’s book about a computer-game-obsessed boy, When Charlie McButton Lost Power (2007). She followed with When Charlie McButton Gained Power (2009).\n\nIn 2013, Collins penned the autobiographical picture book Year of The Jungle. The book, aimed at children, talks about a parent leaving for war and how a young girl struggles to cope with his absence.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nCollins married Charles “Cap” Pryor in 1992. They have two children, Charlie and Isabel. According to Collins’ IMDb profile, she and Pryor divorced in 2015; however, no details of their potential split have been made public.\n\nSuzanne Collins Net Worth\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth, Collins’ total wealth is estimated at around $90 million as of May 2024.\n\nQuotes\n\nDestroying things is much easier than making them."
