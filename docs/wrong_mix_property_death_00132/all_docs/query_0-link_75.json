        "text": "In a film career that spanned almost 30 years, Quinn portrayed characters ranging from kings to Indians, including a pope, a boxer and an artist.\n\n\"I never get the girl,\" Quinn once joked in an interview. \"I wind up with a country instead.\"\n\nHe won his first Oscar in the 1952 film Viva Zapata! as the brother of Mexican revolutionary leader Emiliano Zapata.\n\nQuinn's death was reported by Vincent \"Buddy\" Cianci, the mayor of Providence, Rhode Island, who was a friend of the actor.\n\nHe said Quinn died of respiratory failure at a Boston hospital.\n\nTo many, Quinn's Oscar-nominated characterisation of the Greek peasant Zorba from the Nikos Kazantzakis novel remained his most memorable role.\n\nThe Ouzo-drinking and bouzouki-dancing Zorba was Quinn's favourite role as well, so much so that he returned to the stage in 1983 in a revival of the musical that inspired the 1965 film.\n\nA real-life artist, sculptor and author, his role as painter Paul Gauguin in the 1956 film Lust for Life earned him his second Oscar."
