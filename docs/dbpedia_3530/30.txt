The Lakers were founded in 1945 and were known as SC Rapperswil-Jona until 2005, when the club changed its name to Rapperswil-Jona Lakers and then again changed their name to SC Rapperswil-Jona Lakers in 2015. They play their home games at St. Galler Kantonalbank Arena. NHL veteran Doug Gilmour skated for the Lakers during the NHL lockout-shortened season in 1994.
