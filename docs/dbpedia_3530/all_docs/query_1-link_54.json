A downside is that you have to stare fairly hard to find the player's number and name hidden among the patches of ads. But imagine how cool it would be to have the little green Google android on the shoulders of the players!\n\nLicense This Image\n\nand similar images at\n\nand\n\nThe Swiss ice hockey league referee wears a uniform moderately covered in advertisements.\n\nFrankly, I'd think that's money poorly spent from an advertising budget. Honestly, does any fan even look long enough at the referees to be impressed by any of the ads that adorn them? I'd think not."
