        "text": "Canadian ice hockey player\n\nFor the Irish modern pentathlete, see Mark Hartigan (pentathlete).\n\nIce hockey player\n\nMark Hartigan (born October 15, 1977)[1] is a Canadian former professional ice hockey centre, who played in the National Hockey League with the Atlanta Thrashers, Columbus Blue Jackets, Anaheim Ducks and the Detroit Red Wings. He currently resides in Fort McMurray, Alberta.\n\nPlaying career\n\n[edit]\n\nHartigan was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Atlanta Thrashers in 2002, after three seasons of NCAA hockey at St. Cloud State University. He first played for Atlanta and the Columbus Blue Jackets at the NHL level, and also saw extensive time with their respective AHL franchises, the Chicago Wolves and Syracuse Crunch.\n\nHartigan was traded to the Anaheim Ducks along with Joe Motzko in exchange for Zenon Konopka and Curtis Glencross, on January 26, 2007. He played in only 6 regular season games and one playoff game during the Ducks' successful run for the Stanley Cup in 2007, therefore his name was not put on the cup. He was, however, awarded a Stanley Cup ring by the team.\n\nOn July 16, 2007, Hartigan was signed as a free agent by the Detroit Red Wings, playing 23 regular season games (3G, 1A), and 4 playoff games. Detroit won the Stanley Cup in 2008. However Hartigan did not play enough games, and again his name was not put on the Stanley Cup. He was, however, again given a Stanley Cup ring by the team.\n\nHartigan played the last four seasons of his career in Europe, before announcing his retirement after his final season with Linköpings HC in the Swedish Elitserien.[2]\n\nRecords\n\n[edit]\n\nSt. Cloud State University\n\n[edit]\n\nCareer goals (86)\n\nGoals in a single period (4)\n\nGoals in a single season (37)\n\nAssists in a single season (38–T)\n\nPoints in a single season (75)\n\nShort-handed goals in a season (6)\n\nSyracuse Crunch\n\n[edit]\n\nPassed Lonny Bohonos for the Crunch record for career goals on January 19, 2007 (later surpassed by Alex Barré-Boulet in 2023)[3]\n\nLongest point streak in franchise history (18 games; December 14, 2005 to February 4, 2006)\n\nCareer statistics\n\n[edit]\n\nRegular season Playoffs Season Team League GP G A Pts PIM GP G A Pts PIM 1995–96 Fort St. John Huskies RMJHL 44 31 21 52 45 — — — — — 1995–96 Humboldt Broncos SJHL 9 0 0 0 0 — — — — — 1996–97 Weyburn Red Wings SJHL 52 44 32 76 59 13 12 6 18 29 1997–98 Weyburn Red Wings SJHL 62 59 46 105 81 16 10 16 26 26 1999–2000 St. Cloud State University WCHA 37 22 20 42 24 — — — — — 2000–01 St. Cloud State University WCHA 40 27 21 48 18 — — — — — 2001–02 St. Cloud State University WCHA 42 37 38 75 42 — — — — — 2001–02 Atlanta Thrashers NHL 2 0 0 0 2 — — — — — 2002–03 Atlanta Thrashers NHL 23 5 2 7 6 — — — — — 2002–03 Chicago Wolves AHL 55 15 31 46 43 9 1 2 3 10 2003–04 Columbus Blue Jackets NHL 9 1 3 4 6 — — — — — 2003–04 Syracuse Crunch AHL 69 23 23 46 86 7 1 4 5 8 2004–05 Syracuse Crunch AHL 69 31 28 59 105 — — — — — 2005–06 Columbus Blue Jackets NHL 33 9 3 12 22 — — — — — 2005–06 Syracuse Crunch AHL 49 34 41 75 48 6 1 2 3 33 2006–07 Columbus Blue Jackets NHL 6 1 2 3 2 — — — — — 2006–07 Syracuse Crunch AHL 34 19 13 32 51 — — — — — 2006–07 Anaheim Ducks NHL 6 0 0 0 4 1 0 0 0 0 2006–07 Portland Pirates AHL 25 9 16 25 20 — — — — — 2007–08 Detroit Red Wings NHL 23 3 1 4 16 4 0 1 1 4 2007–08 Grand Rapids Griffins AHL 48 23 19 42 76 — — — — — 2008–09 Dinamo Rīga KHL 55 20 18 38 115 3 1 0 1 10 2009–10 CSKA Moscow KHL 48 8 14 22 56 3 0 0 0 4 2010–11 Dinamo Rīga KHL 45 16 8 24 52 9 3 6 9 12 2011–12 Rapperswil–Jona Lakers NLA 15 2 3 5 10 — — — — — 2011–12 Linköpings HC SEL 23 5 3 8 20 — — — — — AHL totals 349 154 171 325 429 22 3 8 11 51 NHL totals 102 19 11 30 58 5 0 1 1 4 KHL totals 148 44 40 84 223 15 4 6 10 26\n\nAwards and honors\n\n[edit]\n\nAward Year SJHL RBC Top Scorer 1997 RBC Most Valuable Player 1997 College All-WCHA Third Team 2001 All-WCHA First Team 2002 AHCA West First-Team All-American 2002 Hobey Baker Award (Finalist) 2002\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBiographical information and career statistics from NHL.com, or Eliteprospects.com, or Hockey-Reference.com, or The Internet Hockey Database"
