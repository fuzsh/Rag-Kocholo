        "text": "and courage?\n\nHere's a little story about Marseille: (From Hans Joachim Marseille)\n\nPerhaps they mean June 3, 1942 when Marseille claimed 6 Kittyhawks (per some sources, though 7 in OKL claims list)? He made no claims on the 6th. On the 3rd his claims and those of JG53 occurred at about the same time. A total of 9-10 Kittyhawks were claimed; 5 Sdn SAAF lost 4 Kittyhawks plus another 'force landed' back at base, an unknown RAF unit lost 2 Hurricanes apparently at around the same time; the South Africans downed at least 3 Ju-87's the Bf109's were escorting; per \"Fighters Over the Desert\" by Shores and Ring p. 120. The maximum claim accuracy of 70% (counting the force landing and assuming the Hurricanes were really lost in the same incident) is excellent, the minimum of 40% (counting only 4 Kittyhawks and assuming the Hurricane losses might have been to other causes) is still probably no worse than the WWII average.\n\nOn a related thread 'Hartmann's claims', two other examples of Marseille's claiming accuracy were given: Sept 1 when he claimed 17, the Germans claimed a total of 26 or 27 (varies by source), a total of 20 Allied fighters were lost, again excellent apparently ~75% claim accuracy. And, another example where it wasn't as good, Sept 15 '42 Marseille again claimed 7 Kittyhawks of 20 total Kittyhawk and 1 Spit claimed by the Germans at around 1800; but in that case only 6 Kittyhawks total were lost around that time, one attributed to AA by the Allies, plus 2 Spits time unknown, max rate ~40%, min ~25%, depending whether you accept the AA attribution and include the Spits or not.\n\nRudorffer flew in West too; some of his claims in Tunisia don't check out well. For example February 9th, 1943, he was credited 8 victories (6 P-40 and 2 P-38's); his unit II./JG 2, was awarded a total of 15 victories that day, 12 P-40's and 3 P-38's. The P-40's were F's of the French GC II/5, who lost 3. The P-38's were of the 94th FS, who suffered no losses; per \"Focke Wulf 190 in North Africa\" by Arthy and Jessen. Prorated accuracy of his claim, <20%.\n\nIt's would be a big job to do such analysis broadly, and involves uncertainties and ranges of numbers as given above, but still worthwhile IMO, even to see a few examples, as *one* input into 'who was best'. Although IMO that's a quite unanswerable question, because depends on lots of stuff besides how many planes were 'really' downed, like how hard was the overall situation for the ace's side.\n\nOn East v West front though, the German fighters probably had at least as high an overall kill ratio v the Desert Air Force in Marseille's time as the they did v the VVS in Hartmann's time, which was mainly after the 'happy times' on the Eastern Front of '41-42, he didn't start until late '42. I say that based again on \"Fighters Over...\" summaries of day by day combats, the Bf109's were posting a quite high real fighter-fighter kill ratio v the Hurricane/P-40/Spit opposition in that period; as say compared to total reported Soviet and German fighter air combat (and 'failed to return' in Soviet case) losses in 1944, which was still, perhaps surprisingly, in the Luftwaffe's favor but not by as high a ratio as v the Desert AF mid 1942. But as noted on that thread, a highly reliable analysis of Hartmann's claims v Soviet losses in particular incidents is yet to surface AFAIK, analyses that have been published are controversial.\n\nJoe\n\nWhy not? Because Juutilainen wasn't the best pilot of the war by ANY stretch of the imagination, and voting for him the best just because of what it said on his passport is completely uncompelling.\n\nThen go ahead and say, \"Hey, check out so-and-so; he was a great pilot!\". That doesn't mean that you have to vote for him as being the BEST pilot ever!\n\nI'm all for learning. I encourage you to encourage us to learn about pilots like Sonderman. But it's absurd to suggest that he was the best fighter pilot of the war!\n\nI am here to learn, but I simultaneously find it to be absurd when people vote for someone who has one tenth as many kills as the top Germans as the best pilot ever, and ESPECIALLY if they do it just because the guy came from their country!\n\nDo you understand that you can tell us about a pilot without automatically claiming that he was the best fighter ace of the war?\n\nOn a related note, does anyone else here find it to be absurd that Beurling has more votes than Rall, Barkhorn, and Nowotny ALL PUT TOGETHER?!? Their combined kill total was 834, and Beurling shot down only 31. Does this make any sense?!? (And I'm Canadian!)\n\nSeriously people, it's pretty absurd that Witold Urbanowicz has more votes than any of these three German pilots. Where's the objectivity here?!?\n\nI'd like to take this opportunity to remind everyone of the kill table on this page:\n\nList of World War II air aces - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nAll of that is nothing more than your opinioin, and opinions are like assholes, everyone has one!\n\nYour opinion\n\nNot really; there are only so many 'reasonable' criteria on which a pilot can be judged, and we've already seen many of them in this thread:\n\n1. Total number of kills,\n\n2. Kills / combat mission ratio,\n\n3. Marksmanship,\n\n4. Piloting ability,\n\n5. Variety of planes flown,\n\n6. Number of fronts fought on,\n\n7. Number of times shot down vs. kills,\n\n8. Quality of opponents and enemy equipment,\n\netc.\n\nJudging pilot skill inevitably boils down to some kind of weighted combination of these measures. My claim is that for *any* 'reasonable' weighted combination of these 'reasonable' measures, the top pilots will be German.\n\nThat's not particularly subjective.\n\nHow on earth would you know? Maybe he was better than any of them, but he didn't fly in the war for more then 4 days, so hadn't a chance to prove himself. I'm not saying he was, but I'm only showing you that there can be different ways of looking at \"best\".\n\nNot really. You can't base your definition of 'best' on complete hypotheticals. Well, you can, but it isn't very reasonable.\n\nIf you think most kills means best then that is your opinion.\n\nI don't. My definition of best includes some kind of weighted metric of the qualities I listed above. If I thought that most kills meant best, then I would have voted for Hartmann, but I didn't. I voted for Marseille.\n\nLet others have their own. People tend to pick their heroes from their own country, I don't think you should judge that here. If you have a problem with that, just keep it for yourself.\n\nWhy? I believe that World War II taught the world exactly how bat nationalism is. This is a discussion forum pertaining to World War II. If people here are being nationalistic, then I argue that it's fair game to criticize them for it, especially if they are saying things which are unsound.\n\nI think I did in post 50, so yes. But remember, \"best\" is subjective at best, please let other people have their own opinion.\n\nI'm all for people having their own opinions, but if their opinions are nationalistic, then I think that it's ok to criticize their reasoning. Why not?\n\nThat line really got me going. Nationalism is bad?\n\nAre you kidding?!? Yes, nationalism is VERY bad! Neither world war would have been possible without nationalism! Thinking that your own group of people is superior to another group of people NEVER ends well!\n\nWhat is wrong with having pride in where you come from?\n\nHaving pride in where you come from may be how things start, but they get out of control *very* quickly when it comes to nationalism.\n\nIf you want to have pride, then let it be pride in yourself. The fact that Wayne Gretzky was the greatest hockey player who ever lived doesn't somehow make me a better person just because I'm from the same country. It's just bad reasoning. Be proud of yourself for the things that you've achieved. Don't be proud of yourself for the things that others who happen to be from the same country have achieved. And the opposite is true as well: Don't be biased in favor of someone just because they're from the same country as you.\n\nWe should all be one global community, nameless and faceless?\n\nWhat are you talking about? When did I ever advocate abolishing all borders?!? All I'm saying is that people should be a little more objective in their reasoning. Voting nationalistically is not ok.\n\nMarcel had every right to list Juutilainen and from what little I've read about him, he was an excellent pilot.\n\nI criticized the vote because it seems to me like there are a lot of people here who just coincidentally happen to believe that the best pilot of the war was someone from their own country. If a German votes for Hartmann or Marseille, then that's one thing, but if a Dutch or Polish person votes for a Dutch or Polish pilot as having been the best pilot of the war, then there's an obvious lack of objectivity going on. Perhaps Juutilainen is a bad example, because he was the top-scoring non-German pilot of the war. Nevertheless, there are literally *dozens* of Germans ahead of him on the list, so I hope you understand why I found it suspicious that a Finnish person was voting for him.\n\nGoing by your list, even Marseilles only achieved three or four out of the eight you stated.\n\nReally? I think he does well in at least six of the categories.\n\nIf he had said he voted Juutilainen because he likes the color of his eyes, I would support you in your contention.\n\nColor of his eyes / color of his passport... What's the difference?\n\nDiscussions like this are hardly black and white. Like Adler said its for fun and thats a very big grey area because personal opinion is involved.\n\nI'm new here, and I don't really have a feel for the culture here yet. I'm not quite sure how serious this forum is. World War II was a pretty serious event, so I imagine that some spirited (albeit good-natured) debate is in order. If I'm overstepping, then by all means correct me. I already seem to be getting some negative feedback on my anti-nationalism comments, so that's telling me to lighten up, which I'm very happy to do.\n\nBy the way, here are some more criteria:\n\n1. Total number of kills,\n\n2. Kills / combat mission ratio,\n\n3. Marksmanship,\n\n4. Piloting ability,\n\n5. Variety of planes flown,\n\n6. Number of fronts fought on,\n\n7. Number of times shot down vs. kills,\n\n8. Quality of opponents and enemy equipment,\n\n9. Surviving a huge number of combat missions,\n\n10. Never losing a wingman,\n\n11. Number of missions in which multiple kills were scored.\n\nIf anyone else wants to add to this list, feel free!\n\nWhy? I believe that World War II taught the world exactly how bat nationalism is. This is a discussion forum pertaining to World War II. If people here are being nationalistic, then I argue that it's fair game to criticize them for it, especially if they are saying things which are unsound.\n\nI don't want to discuss your ideas about nationalism here, as I feel it belongs to the \"political\" forum. But you must remember that people vote for things they know best and usually that are things from their own corner of the world.\n\nAnd why is it different if Germans vote for a german pilot against Juha voting for a finish one? You already admitted his choice was a good one. Is this because the Germans confirm your own opinion?\n\nI'm all for people having their own opinions, but if their opinions are nationalistic, then I think that it's ok to criticize their reasoning. Why not?\n\nFine, so you don't mind me criticizing yours?\n\nNot really; there are only so many 'reasonable' criteria on which a pilot can be judged, and we've already seen many of them in this thread:\n\n1. Total number of kills,\n\n2. Kills / combat mission ratio,\n\n3. Marksmanship,\n\n4. Piloting ability,\n\n5. Variety of planes flown,\n\n6. Number of fronts fought on,\n\n7. Number of times shot down vs. kills,\n\n8. Quality of opponents and enemy equipment,\n\netc.\n\nJudging pilot skill inevitably boils down to some kind of weighted combination of these measures. My claim is that for *any* 'reasonable' weighted combination of these 'reasonable' measures, the top pilots will be German.\n\nThat's not particularly subjective.\n\nWhile you seem to have an scientific approach, you really haven't, as you seem to pick your criteria to be in favor of your own bias towards German pilots and some are still subjective. Your subjectiveness (and this counts for all people here) can be seen by the criteria you pick. And your criteria are flawed to say the least. For instance criteria 1. So based on this you'll pick the german that shot down 5 I-15's over a Brit who shot down 3 Bf109's?\n\nFurthermore several of your criteria are not relevant as they depend on circumstances rather than the quality of the pilot. Number of fronts fought on really isn't in the pilot's hands and neither is the variety of planes flown.\n\nNot really. You can't base your definition of 'best' on complete hypotheticals. Well, you can, but it isn't very reasonable.\n\nTo show your flawed logic I will make an example of comparing Hartman vs Sonderman. It's not to take away any of the greatness of Buby, but just to show the mistake you make. Hartman shot down most planes but it took a while and many combat missions before he started to pile up victims. Sonderman shot down 4 planes in his first (and only) 5 combat missions. This is already better, but also gives Sonderman a ratio of about 1:1, which is better than any German ace discussed here. Further more, Sonderman did this with inferior material against superior numbers (Dutch numbered to Germans 1:10) and superior tactics, also a combination no German pilot can claim. The Germans never had inferior planes and most of the time had a better strength then 1:10. So now I proved that Sonderman was superior to Hartman by carefully choosing my criteria. So what I'm saying is there is no objective way to chose here.\n\npbfoot\n\n\"Would the circumanstances be the same if they were fighting the Germans as opposed the Russians ?2\n\nShort answer is no. Reasons, while some Soviet units were very good, some were poor. IMHO the quality of units varied more in Soviet AF during the WWII than in other major AFs. Generally speaking tactically Soviet formations became good in 43 but at that time they still tended to open fire too far away. But that is only a generalization. There were from 39 onwards Soviet pilots who were good shots and knew the axiom \"Get very near before opening fire.\" In 1944 they were dangerous opponents; their best units were at that time probably as dangerous as Germans. But before 44 I would say that Germans would have been much more difficult opponents.\n\nP1234567890\n\n\" Because Juutilainen wasn't the best pilot of the war by ANY stretch of the imagination…\"\n\nNow Juutilainen had clearly better exchange rate than Marseille, who seems to be your choice, 91:0 vs 158: at least 6, four planes lost at Kanal front (against 7 claims) and IIRC he was shot down at least twice in North Africa. We can argue how important the exchange rate was. To Finns, who didn't have a/c industry to speak of, it was very important indeed. Germany wasn't ready to sell but a token number of 109s to Finland before the summer 44. Finns had to even in 1943 bought more Morane-Saulnier M.S.406s and Curtiss Hawk 75s from German war booty debots, some of which had probably stand outdoors almost 3 years before the deal, to get even some sort \"new\" fighters to replace those lost or too wore. And when the fighter recon Flight of Recon Sqn 16 finally got rid from its Gloster Gladiator Mk IIs during the summer 44 its \"new\" planes were Polikarpov I-153s, so still old biplanes.\n\nJuutilainen got kills in 3 different planes, Fokker D.XXI, Brewster Model 239 and Bf 109G. All rather different types needing very different tactics if one want to be successful. Marseille got all his kills while flying Bf109s.\n\nNow it was much easier to shoot down Hurricanes while flying Bf 109F than shoot down newer Soviet fighters while flying Model 239, I would say that it was easier to shoot down Hurricanes when flying Bf 109F than when flying Model 239.\n\netc\n\nJuha\n\nI don't want to discuss your ideas about nationalism here, as I feel it belongs to the \"political\" forum. But you must remember that people vote for things they know best and usually that are things from their own corner of the world.\n\nExcept that the topic of nationalism is relevant here because people like you are promoting pilots from your own country who have less than 10 kills as being the best pilot of the war. It's great that you're teaching us about obscure Dutch pilots, but ultimately there's a reason why he's obscure and why the people on the list above are not.\n\nWhile you seem to have an scientific approach, you really haven't, as you seem to pick your criteria to be in favor of your own bias towards German pilots and some are still subjective. Your subjectiveness (and this counts for all people here) can be seen by the criteria you pick.\n\nNot really. We can all get together and decide on any reasonable criteria we want for judging pilot skill. Then we can create some kind of weighted metric on it, and apply it. I claim that this is as objective a measure as we could possibly come up with, and I further claim that for any reasonable metric, the Germans will come out at the top of the list.\n\nAnd your criteria are flawed to say the least. For instance criteria 1. So based on this you'll pick the german that shot down 5 I-15's over a Brit who shot down 3 Bf109's?\n\nNo, my proposed metric takes *everything* into account and in fact 3 109 kills would probably count more than 5 Sturmovik kills.\n\nFurthermore several of your criteria are not relevant as they depend on circumstances rather than the quality of the pilot. Number of fronts fought on really isn't in the pilot's hands and neither is the variety of planes flown.\n\nVariety of planes flown in which the pilot scored kills should count for something. It shows versatility. For example, it's impressive that Juutilainen scored kills in three different planes. Is it as important as total kill count? No, but it should count for at least something.\n\nTo show your flawed logic I will make an example of comparing Hartman vs Sonderman. It's not to take away any of the greatness of Buby, but just to show the mistake you make. Hartman shot down most planes but it took a while and many combat missions before he started to pile up victims. Sonderman shot down 4 planes in his first (and only) 5 combat missions. This is already better, but also gives Sonderman a ratio of about 1:1, which is better than any German ace discussed here.\n\nAnd this would help Sonderman's score using the metric I am suggesting, but ultimately you have to factor in total number of kills, number of missions flown, etc. in which Sonderman is WAY behind. If you ONLY use ratio, then sure, Sonderman does very well. But that's a totally unreasonable way to measure pilot skill. You have to measure all of the relevant criteria involved, which is what I'm suggesting. For example, ratio should obviously be tempered by number of missions flown, and it isn't hard to make the argument that a ratio of 0.58 over 442 missions (Nowotny) is a whole lot more impressive than a ratio of 1.0 over 5 missions. Do you seriously think that Sonderman would have been able to keep up that ratio if he'd flown hundreds of missions?!?\n\nFurther more, Sonderman did this with inferior material against superior numbers (Dutch numbered to Germans 1:10) and superior tactics, also a combination no German pilot can claim.\n\nAnd again that would reflect well in Sonderman's overall rating, but it isn't NEARLY enough to lift him above the top Germans.\n\nThe Germans never had inferior planes and most of the time had a better strength then 1:10. So now I proved that Sonderman was superior to Hartman by carefully choosing my criteria. So what I'm saying is there is no objective way to chose here.\n\nThat's just it: You had to carefully choose your criteria. I'm saying that we should compare the pilots based on *all* relevant criteria weighted in some reasonable way. Your criteria are unreasonable because you cherry-picked them in order to make Sonderman look good. It's pretty hard to argue that judging pilots based on *all* relevant criteria is unreasonable.\n\nThe bottom line is this: Under any set of reasonable criteria which does not ignore any important facts and which is weighted in some reasonable way, the top Germans will always come out on top.\n\nThis shows that it's not all subjective.\n\nP1234567890\n\n\" Because Juutilainen wasn't the best pilot of the war by ANY stretch of the imagination…\"\n\nNow Juutilainen had clearly better exchange rate than Marseille, who seems to be your choice, 91:0 vs 158: at least 6, four planes lost at Kanal front (against 7 claims) and IIRC he was shot down at least twice in North Africa. We can argue how important the exchange rate was. To Finns, who didn't have a/c industry to speak of, it was very important indeed.

I agree that he does very well in a lot of important categories.\n\nNevertheless, I argue that if you factor in all of the important criteria, Juutilainen still isn't up there with the top Germans. He probably was the best non-German ace of the war, though.\n\nMaybe that would be a good way of doing things: Have one poll for who was the best German pilot, and have another one for the best non-German pilot."
