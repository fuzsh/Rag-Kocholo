        "text": "I have:\n\nSoviet Tactical Aviation\n\nFlankers: The New Generation Vol 2\n\nMIG-15: Design, Development, and Korean War Combat History (Warbird History)\n\nSukhoi S-37 and Mikoyan MFI: Russian Fifth-Generation Fighter Demonstrators - Red Star Vol. 1\n\nYou're welcome to purchase & see for yourself\n\n1. How do books on postwar aviation relate to the topic under consideration here?\n\n2. At least the book on MiG-15 looks absolutely adequate. I did not find any of the things you attributed to the authors there. I will repeat the request: please cite the specific page and paragraph numbers to which you have specific complaints. I am ready to consider any additional sources to clarify the matter.\n\n3. Gordon's books on Soviet aviation in WWII are perfectly adequate and based on documents. I consider your criticism to be completely unjustified.\n\nI don't think it was overrated at all. It was VERY difficult to shoot down from below\n\nIt looks very logical: the Il-2 was hard to shoot down, so it took over 36,000 of them to produce. And 9 (nine!!!) sorties per one loss in 1941 also certainly testifies to the IL-2's invincibility.\n\nand was almost solely intended for ground support missions, which is why the German troops were under so much constant pressure (well, in addition to the weather, anyway) and were almost always short of supplies since the Il-2s were attacking the supply chain as it moved along the ground.\n\nI really wish that Oleg Rastrenin would finally publish his books in English, so that those who do not speak Russian would finally familiarize themselves with the history of IL-2 based on documents, not Soviet propaganda. The history of IL-2 was very complex and ambiguous. And now, when we know the alternatives (and there were more than one) there is no certainty that the decision to produce the IL-2 on a mass scale was optimal.\n\nThe Il-2 was a major reason why the Germans didn't succeed in their invasion of the USSR.\n\nUndoubtedly, the airplane contributed to the victory over Germany, but it is a definite exaggeration to consider it decisive. Artillery and infantry were of the greatest importance in the Soviet army, while air force was probably the weakest branch, unless you consider the navy, which did not prove itself at all.\n\nAccording to a book I have on anti-tank aircraft they attacked in large numbers, line abreast, salvoing those inaccurate rockets. I suppose quantity does have a quality of its own.\n\n1. Il-2 cannon efficiency against tanks was low - 37 mm cannons did not provide accuracy and rate of fire, 23 mm cannons did not provide guaranteed penetration of armor of even medium tanks, 20 mm ShVAK with an improved shell did not always penetrate the upper armor of even lightly armored half-tracked vehicles, giving a large number of ricochets.\n\n2. Mass production of rockets with acceptable effectiveness against tanks (RBS-82, -132) began only in 1944. Effective use of such rockets required either a large salvo - the entire ammunition at once - or a close-range salvo. Both options were available only to experienced pilots. Therefore, Il-2 pilots' opinions on the rockets' efficiency against tanks vary from \"absolutely useless\" to \"the most effective Il-2 weapon\" depending on their qualifications.\n\n3. The most effective weapon against tanks according to documents were PTAB bombs with cumulative effect.\n\nOverall anti-tank effectiveness of the Il-2 was inadequate. German tank units did not suffer heavy tank losses from the Il-2. This is generally confirmed by Soviet documents as well\n\nI've written about all of this here before....\n\nI don't think it was overrated at all. It was VERY difficult to shoot down from below and was almost solely intended for ground support missions, which is why the German troops were under so much constant pressure (well, in addition to the weather, anyway) and were almost always short of supplies since the Il-2s were attacking the supply chain as it moved along the ground.\n\nThe Il-2 was a major reason why the Germans didn't succeed in their invasion of the USSR.\n\nFirst of all, there were 18 combat ready Il-2s altogether in all Western Military Districts on 1 June 1941, so their impact on the failure or success of the Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion into the USSR in 1941, was minimal. Later they became significant but were clearly less effective than the legends tell.\n\nThey were difficult planes to shoot down but downing them even by 20 mm AA cannon fire was entirely possible contrary to that 60s myth.\n\nHi Juha3.\n\nI think everybody in here knows that early WWII Soviet Aviation, including the early single-seat Il-2, was not exactly top notch. But, later, they WERE top notch, and Il-2s / 10s played a big part in it, especially when they were escorted by La-5/7s. They were flying when the winter weather had the Luftwaffe grounded and were able to attack with no air opposition, too.\n\nI suppose we'll have to agree to disagree on that one. No biggie.\n\nYou might recall that the Soviet VVS persevered and drove the Luftwaffe back to Germany and, eventually, defeated them. The Il-2s / Il-10s were flying and delivering punches when the Luftwaffe ceased operations. How bad could they have been?\n\nHowever bad or good, they were better than the opposition when it counted, particularly from mid-1944 forward.\n\nHi Juha3.\n\nI think everybody in here knows that early WWII Soviet Aviation, including the early single-seat Il-2, was not exactly top notch. But, later, they WERE top notch, and Il-2s / 10s played a big part in it, especially when they were escorted by La-5/7s.\n\nThe Il-10 was less effective at ground attack than the IL-2. Moreover, it was less resistant to damage - a \"fighter\" wing profile gave less chance for emergency landing. The La-5/7, due to its low fuel reserve, was used for escorting rather rarely comparing to Yaks.\n\nYour impressions about Ils are based mainly on propaganda and contradict SOVIET documents.\n\nThey were flying when the winter weather had the Luftwaffe grounded and were able to attack with no air opposition, too.\n\nAnd at the same time they suffer heavy losses from anti-aircraft artillery, as Il-2 was a relatively large aircraft with low maneuverability. Do you know the story of the 13 IL-10s crashed in one group flight due to weather conditions?\n\nI suppose we'll have to agree to disagree on that one. No biggie.\n\nAll we need is to analyze the documents, not the fairy tales of Soviet propaganda.\n\nHow bad could they have been?\n\nAs much as you like, considering the scale of production. The Soviets won primarily through quantity, not quality, unfortunately.\n\nHowever bad or good, they were better than the opposition when it counted, particularly from mid-1944 forward.\n\nThe point is that the Soviets had very decent alternatives - starting in the late 1930s. And in the long run they would have been much more effective than the Il-2.\n\nAccording to the histories I read, the Il-10 had its combat introduction in Sep 1944 and 99 were produced before the end of 1944. Unless I miss my history, that was firmly in WWII and firmly against the German Luftwaffe. Most of the production was after WWII, to be sure, but unlike the P-51H, the Il-10 made combat against the Germans ... so it does not resemble a red herring OR the P-51H Mustang and F8F Bearcat that made the show but missed combat in WWII.\n\nWere the early ones debugged and great airplane? No. But they were there and saw combat.\n\nThe P-39 certainly had it faults, but it was not a bad ground-attack airplane, especially at short ranges, which suited the Soviet VVS to a tee since the P-39s stayed low in Soviet service mostly, they ALSO weren't bad fighters down just above the heads of the troops. Under 10,000 feet, they were a decent match for most WWII fighters. They weren't too good above 15,000 feet, for sure. But many an Axis pilot was quite surprised to discover himself being shot down by an \"inferior\" fighter that he thought he could ignore. T'was not the wisest course to trifle with a well-flown P-39 down low.\n\nThe P-39 certainly had it faults, but it was not a bad ground-attack airplane, especially at short ranges, which suited the Soviet VVS to a tee since the P-39s stayed low in Soviet service mostly, they ALSO weren't bad fighters down just above the heads of the troops. Under 10,000 feet, they were a decent match for most WWII fighters.\n\nLet's face it - despite the serious shortcomings the Cobra was the best fighter in the Soviet Air Force considering the whole set of parameters (including pilot comfort and radio communication) until the summer of 1943 at least. Pokryshkin (official score 59 victories, 3xH.o.t.S.U.) was invited to convert to any Soviet fighter, but he refused.\n\nThe IL-10 was a serious mistake by the Air Force officials. In pursuit of better flight performance, they sacrificed the aircraft's striking power and made it more vulnerable. By the end of 1944, there were too few German fighters on the Eastern Front to justify the presence of an air gunner - he was just ballast. According to Soviet documents, the probability of ILs to encounter German fighters in the last year of the war was only 15%. At the same time, Ils were usually escorted by fighters. The Il-10 carried less bomb load than the Il-2, while its pilot had less time to aim due to a higher speed, that resulted in lower overall efficiency."
