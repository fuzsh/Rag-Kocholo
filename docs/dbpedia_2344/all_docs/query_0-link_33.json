        "text": "Representatives of the Soviet air force made a great contribution to the defeat of the Nazi invaders. Many pilots gave their lives for the freedom and independence of our Motherland, many became Heroes of the Soviet Union. Some of them were forever included in the elite of the domestic Air Force, in the famous cohort of Soviet aces - the thunderstorm of the Luftwaffe. Today, we recall the 10 of the most successful Soviet fighter pilots, who chalked up the most of the enemy aircraft shot down in aerial battles.\n\n4 February 1944, an outstanding Soviet fighter pilot Ivan Nikitovich Kozhedub was awarded the first star of the Hero of the Soviet Union. By the end of World War II, he was already three times the Hero of the Soviet Union. During the war years, only one Soviet pilot was able to repeat this achievement - it was Alexander Ivanovich Pokryshkin. But on these two most famous aces story Soviet fighter aviation times of war does not end. During the war, another 25 pilots were twice presented to the rank of Heroes of the Soviet Union, not to mention those who were once awarded this highest military award of the country of those years.\n\nIvan Kozhedub\n\nDuring the war years, Ivan Kozhedub made 330 sorties, conducted 120 air battles, and personally shot down 64 of the enemy aircraft. He flew the planes La-5, La-5FN and La-7.\n\nThe official Soviet historiography featured 62 shot down enemy aircraft, but archival research showed that Kozhedub shot down an 64 aircraft (for some reason, there were no two air victories - 11 April 1944 of the year - PZL P.24 and 8 of June 1944 of the year - Me 109) . Among the trophies of the Soviet ace pilot were 39 fighters (21 Fw-190, 17 Me-109 and 1 PZL P.24), 17 dive bombers (Ju-87), 4 bomber (2 Ju-XNNXX-X-NNXX) An 88 attack aircraft (Hs-2) and one Me-111 jet fighter. In addition, in his autobiography, he pointed out that in 3, he shot down two American fighters P-129 \"Mustang\", which attacked him from a long distance, mistaken for a German plane.\n\nIn all likelihood, start Ivan Kozhedub (1920-1991) war in 1941, his account of downed aircraft could be even greater. However, his debut came only at 1943 year, and his first plane was shot down by the next ace in the battle of Kursk. 6 July during a combat departure, he shot down a German dive bomber Ju-87. Thus, the performance of the pilot really striking, in just two military years he managed to bring the score of his victories to a record in the Soviet Air Force.\n\nAt the same time, Kozhedub was never shot down during the entire war, although he returned to the airfield several times on a heavily damaged fighter. But the last one could be his first air battle, which took place on 26 March 1943. His La-5 was damaged by a line of a German fighter, the armored backboard saved the pilot from an incendiary projectile. And on returning home, his plane fired on its own air defense, the car received two hits. Despite this, Kozhedub managed to land the plane, which was no longer subject to full recovery.\n\nThe first steps in aviation, the future best Soviet ace did, studying at the Shotkinsky flying club. At the beginning of 1940, he was called up to the Red Army and graduated from the Chuguev Military Aviation Pilot School in the autumn of the same year, after which he continued to serve in this school as an instructor. With the beginning of the war the school was evacuated to Kazakhstan. The war itself began for him in November 1942, when Kozhedub was seconded to the 240 th Fighter Wing 302 th Fighter Air Division. The formation of the division was completed only in March 1943, after which it flew to the front. As mentioned above, he won his first victory only on 6 July 1943 of the year, but a start was made.\n\nAlready 4 February 1944, Senior Lieutenant Ivan Kozhedub was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union, at that time he managed to make 146 combat missions and shoot down enemy aircraft in 20 air battles. He received his second star in the same year. He was presented to the 19 August Award 1944 of the year for the 256 completed combat sorties and 48 downed enemy planes. At that time he was a captain in the position of deputy commander of the 176-th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment.\n\nIn the air battles of Ivan Nikitovich Kozhedub distinguished fearlessness, composure and automatic piloting, which he had brought to perfection. It is possible that, before being sent to the front, he spent several years as an instructor, played a very large role in his future successes in the sky. Kozhedub could easily conduct aimed fire at the enemy in any position of the aircraft in the air, and also easily performed complex aerobatic maneuvers. Being an excellent sniper, he preferred to conduct an air combat at a distance of 200-300 meters.\n\nHis last victory in the Great Patriotic War, Ivan Nikitovich Kozhedub won 17 on April 1945 of the year in the skies over Berlin, in this battle he shot down two German FW-190 fighter jets. Three times Hero of the Soviet Union, the future Marshal of Aviation (rank awarded 6 May 1985) Major Kozhedub became 18 August 1945. After the war, he continued to serve in the Air Force of the country and went through a very serious career path, bringing still a lot of benefit to the country. The legendary pilot died on August 8 1991, was buried at the Novodevichy cemetery in Moscow.\n\nAlexander Ivanovich Pokryshkin\n\nAlexander Ivanovich Pokryshki fought from the very first day of the war to the last. During this time, he made 650 combat missions, in which he conducted 156 air battles and officially personally shot down 59 enemy planes and 6 planes in the group. He is the second most effective ace in the countries of the anti-Hitler coalition after Ivan Kozhedub. During the war years he flew on MiG-3, Yak-1 and American P-39 Aero Cobra aircraft.\n\nThe figure of downed aircraft is very conditional. Quite often, Alexander Pokryshkin made deep raids to the rear of the enemy, where he also managed to win victories. However, only those of them that could be confirmed by terrestrial services, that is, if possible over their territory, were counted. Such unrecorded victories only in 1941, he could have 8. At the same time, they accumulated the entire war. Also, Alexander Pokryshkin often gave the planes shot down by him at the expense of his subordinates (mostly slaves), stimulating them in this way. In those years it was quite common.\n\nAlready during the first weeks of the war, Pokryshkin was able to understand that the tactics of the Soviet Air Force were outdated. Then he began to write his notes on this account in a notebook. He kept an accurate record of the air battles in which he and his friends took part, after which he made a detailed analysis of what was written. At the same time, at that time he had to fight in the very difficult conditions of the constant retreat of the Soviet troops. He later said: \"Those who did not fight in 1941-1942, do not know the real war.\"\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union and the massed criticism of everything that was connected with that period, some authors began to “cut back” the number of Pokryshkin's victories. It was also connected with the fact that at the end of 1944, the official Soviet propaganda finally made the pilot a “luminous image of a hero, the main fighter of war”. In order not to lose the hero in a random battle, it was ordered to limit the flights of Alexander Ivanovich Pokryshkin, who by that time already commanded the regiment. 19 August 1944 after 550 combat missions and 53 officially won victories, he became three times Hero of the Soviet Union, the first in history.\n\nA wave of “revelations” that swept over after the 1990s, was also traversed because, after the war, he managed to take the post of Commander-in-Chief of the country's air defense forces, that is, he became “a major Soviet official”. If we talk about the low ratio of victories to perfect sorties, then it can be noted that for a long time at the beginning of the war Pokryshkin on his MiG-3, and then the Yak-1 took off to attack enemy ground forces or reconnaissance flights. For example, by mid-November 1941, the pilot had already completed 190 sorties, but the overwhelming majority of them - 144 was to attack the ground forces of the enemy.\n\nAlexander Ivanovich Pokryshkin was not only a cold-blooded, courageous and virtuosic Soviet pilot, but also a thinking pilot. He was not afraid to criticize the existing tactics of fighter aircraft and advocated for its replacement. Discussions about this with the regimental commander in 1942 led to the fact that the ace pilot was even expelled from the party and sent the case to the tribunal. The pilot was saved by the intercession of the regimental commissar and the higher command. The case against him was stopped and reinstated in the party. After the war, Pokryshkin was in conflict with Vasily Stalin for a long time, which adversely affected his career. Everything changed only in 1953, after the death of Joseph Stalin. Subsequently, he managed to rise to the rank of Air Marshal, who was assigned to him in 1972 year. The celebrated ace pilot 13 passed November 1985, at the age of 72 years in Moscow.\n\nGrigory Andreyevich Rechkalov\n\nGrigory Andreyevich Rechkalov fought from the very first day of the Great Patriotic War. Twice Hero of the Soviet Union. During the war years he carried out more than 450 sorties, shooting down 122 enemy aircraft in person and 56 in a group in 6 air battles. According to others, the number of his personal air victories could pass for 60. During the war years I flew I-153 “Chaika”, I-16, Yak-1, P-39 “Aero Cobra”.\n\nProbably no other Soviet fighter pilot had such a variety of downed enemy vehicles as Grigory Rechkalov. Among his trophies were fighters Me-110, Me-109, Fw-190, bombers Ju-88, He-111, dive bomber Ju-87, attack Hs-129, reconnaissance aircraft Fw-189 and Hs-126, as well as such a rare machine as the Italian Savoy and the Polish fighter PZL-24, which was used by the Romanian Air Force.\n\nSurprisingly, the day before the start of the Great Patriotic War, Rechkalov was suspended from flying by the decision of the medical flight commission, he had color blindness. But on his return to his unit with this diagnosis, he was still allowed to fly. The beginning of the war forced the authorities to simply close their eyes to this diagnosis, simply ignoring it. At the same time, he served in the 55 Fighter Regiment with 1939, along with Pokryshkin.\n\nThis brilliant military pilot was distinguished by a very contradictory and uneven character. By showing a model of determination, courage and discipline within the framework of one sortie, in another he could distract from the fulfillment of the main task and just as resolutely begin the pursuit of a random opponent, seeking to increase the score of his victories. His military fate in the war is closely intertwined with the fate of Alexander Pokryshkin. He flew with him in the same group, succeeded him in the posts of squadron commander and regiment commander. Pokryshkin himself the best qualities of Grigory Rechkalov considered frankness and frankness.\n\nRechkalov, like Pokryshkin, fought with 22 June 1941, but with a forced break for almost two years. In the very first month of the fighting, he, on his outdated biplane fighter, the I-153, managed to shoot down three enemy aircraft. He managed to fly on the I-16 fighter. 26 July 1941 was wounded in the head and in the leg with fire from the ground during a combat departure near Dubossary, but managed to bring his plane to the airfield. After this injury, he spent months at the 9 hospital, during which time the pilot underwent three operations. And once again, the medical commission tried to put an insurmountable obstacle in the path of the future glorified ace. Grigory Rechkalov was sent to serve in the reserve regiment, which was equipped with U-2 aircraft. The future twice Hero of the Soviet Union took this direction as a personal insult. At the district air force headquarters, he managed to get him returned to his regiment, which at that time was called the 17 Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment. But very soon the regiment was recalled from the front for rearmament to the new American Air Cobra fighters that were marching to the USSR as part of the Lend-Lease program. For these reasons, Rechkalov began to beat the enemy again only in April of 1943.\n\nGrigory Rechkalov, being one of the domestic stars of fighter aviation, could very well interact with other pilots, guessing their intentions and working together as a group. Back in the war years between him and Pokryshkin, a conflict arose, but he never sought to throw out some negative or blame his opponent. On the contrary, in his memoirs he spoke well about Pokryshkin, noting that they managed to unravel the tactics of the German pilots, after which they began to apply new techniques: they began to fly in pairs rather than in links, it is better to use radio guidance and communications, to echelon their so-called \" bookcase.\n\nGrigory Rechkalov scored victories on the Aircobra 44, more than other Soviet pilots. After the end of the war, someone asked the illustrious pilot what he valued most in the Air Cobra fighter, on which so many victories were won: power of firing volley, speed, visibility, engine reliability? The pilot-pilot answered this question that all of the above things mattered, of course, these were the obvious merits of the aircraft. But the main thing he said was in the radio. On the \"Aircobre\" was excellent, rare in those years, radio. Thanks to this connection, pilots in battle could communicate with each other, as if by telephone. Someone saw something - at once all the members of the group are in the know. Therefore, in combat missions, we did not have any surprises.\n\nAfter the end of the war, Grigory Rechkalov continued his service in the Air Force. True, not as long as other Soviet aces. Already in 1959, he went to the reserve in the rank of Major General. After that he lived and worked in Moscow. Died in Moscow on December 20 1990, at the age of 70.\n\nNikolai Dmitrievich Gulaev\n\nNikolai Dmitrievich Gulaev was on the fronts of World War II in August 1942. In total, during the war years, he made 250 combat missions, conducted 49 air battles, in which he personally destroyed 55 enemy planes and 5 aircraft in the group. Such statistics makes Gulayev the most effective Soviet ace. For every 4 departure he had a downed plane or, on average, more than one aircraft for each air battle. During the war, he flew fighters I-16, Yak-1, P-39 \"Air Cobra\", most of his victories, like Pokryshkin with Rechkalov, he scored on \"Air Cobra\".\n\nTwice Hero of the Soviet Union, Nikolai Dmitrievich Gulaev shot down not much less aircraft than Alexander Pokryshkin. But in terms of the effectiveness of the battles, he far surpassed him and Kozhedub. At the same time he fought less than two years. First, he was in the deep Soviet rear as part of the air defense forces engaged in the protection of important industrial facilities, protecting them from enemy air raids. And in September, 1944, he was almost forcibly sent to study at the Air Force Academy.\n\nHis most productive battle Soviet pilot made 30 May 1944 of the year. In one air battle over Skoleni, he managed to shoot down 5 of enemy aircraft right away: two Me-109, Hs-129, Ju-87 and Ju-88. During the battle, he himself was seriously wounded in his right hand, but by concentrating all his strength and will, he was able to bring his fighter to the airfield, bleeding profusely, landed, and already drove into the parking lot, lost consciousness. The pilot regained consciousness only in the hospital after the operation, and here he found out that he was awarded the second title of Hero of the Soviet Union.\n\nAll the while Gulaev was at the front, he fought desperately. During this time he managed to make two successful rammers, managing to land his damaged aircraft after that. Several times during this time he was wounded, but after wounds he invariably returned to the ranks. In early September, 1944, the pilot-ace, was forcibly sent to study. At that moment, the outcome of the war was already clear to all and the famous Soviet aces were trying to take care of, sending them to the Air Force Academy in an orderly manner. Thus, the war ended unexpectedly for our hero.\n\nNikolai Gulayev was called the brightest representative of the \"romantic school\" of air combat. Often, the pilot dared to commit \"irrational actions\" that shocked the German pilots, but helped him to win. Even among other far from ordinary Soviet fighter pilots, the figure of Nikolai Gulayev stood out for its colorful. Only such a person, possessing unparalleled courage, would be able to conduct 10 over-effective air battles, recording two of his victories on a successful ram of enemy aircraft. Gulayev’s modesty in public and in his self-esteem disagreed with his exceptionally aggressive and persistent manner of conducting air combat, and with boyish spontaneity he managed to carry openness and honesty through his whole life, preserving to the end of his life some youthful prejudices that did not prevent him from serving the rank of Colonel-General Aviation. The celebrated pilot passed away on 27 on September 1985 of the year in Moscow.\n\nKirill Alekseevich Evstigneev\n\nKirill Alekseevich Evstigneev twice Hero of the Soviet Union. Like Kozhedub, he began his combat career relatively late, only in 1943. During the war years, 296 carried out combat missions, conducted 120 air battles, personally shooting down 53 of the enemy aircraft and 3 in the group. He flew fighters La 5 and La 5FN.\n\nThe almost two-year “delay” with the appearance at the front was due to the fact that the fighter pilot suffered from peptic ulcer and did not allow him to go to the front. From the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, he worked as an instructor in a flight school, and after that he overtook Lend Cossacks Aero Cobra. Working as an instructor gave him a lot, like another Soviet asu Kozhedub. At the same time, Evstigneev did not stop writing reports to the command with a request to send him to the front, as a result, they were nevertheless satisfied. Kirill Yevstigneyev received his baptism of fire in March 1943. Like Kozhedub, he fought as part of the 240 th Fighter Regiment, flew the La 5 fighter. On the very first 28 March departure, 1943 of the year won two victories.\n\nDuring the entire war, the enemy did not succeed in knocking down Kirill Yevstigneyev. But he got from his twice. For the first time, the Yak-1 pilot, carried away by air combat, crashed into his plane from above. Pilot Yak-1 immediately jumped out of the plane, who lost one wing, with a parachute. But Yevstigneev's La 5 suffered less, and he managed to reach the position of his troops by landing a fighter next to the trenches. The second case, more mysterious and dramatic, occurred over its territory in the absence of enemy aircraft in the air. The fuselage of his plane flashed the line, damaging Evstigneev legs, the car caught fire and entered the peak, and the pilot had to jump from a plane with a parachute. At the hospital, the doctors tended to amputate the foot to the pilot, but he caught up on them such a fear that they abandoned their undertaking. And after only 9 days, the pilot escaped from the hospital and, with crutches, got to the location of his native part of 35 kilometers.\n\nKirill Evstigneev constantly increased the number of his air victories. Before 1945, the pilot was ahead of Kozhedub. At the same time, the doctor of the unit periodically sent him to the hospital to treat the ulcer and the injured leg, which the pilot-pilot terribly opposed. Kirill Alekseevich was seriously ill since pre-war times, in his life he underwent 13 surgeries. Very often, the famous Soviet pilot flew, overcoming physical pain. Evstigneev, as they say, was obsessed with flying. In his spare time, he tried to train young fighter pilots. He was the initiator of the training of air battles. For the most part, Kozhedub was his opponent. At the same time, Evstigneev was completely devoid of a sense of fear, even at the very end of the war he calmly went into a frontal attack on the six-gun Fokkers, winning victories over them. Kozhedub spoke about his comrade: \"Pilot-flint\".\n\nCaptain Kirill Yevstigneyev finished the Guard War with the navigator of the 178 Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment. The last pilot of his battle was in the sky of Hungary 26 March 1945, on his fifth for the war La-5 fighter. After the war, he continued service in the USSR Air Force, in 1972 he retired with the rank of major general, lived in Moscow. 29 died on August 1996, at the age of 79, and was buried in the Kuntsevo cemetery of the capital.\n\nInformation sources:\n\nhttp://svpressa.ru\n\nhttp://airaces.narod.ru\n\nhttp://www.warheroes.ru\n\nYuferev Sergey\n\nOur news channels\n\nSubscribe and stay up to date with the latest news and the most important events of the day.\n\n38 comments\n\n\"Right Sector\" (banned in Russia), \"Ukrainian Insurgent Army\" (UPA) (banned in Russia), ISIS (banned in Russia), \"Jabhat Fatah al-Sham\" formerly \"Jabhat al-Nusra\" (banned in Russia) , Taliban (banned in Russia), Al-Qaeda (banned in Russia), Anti-Corruption Foundation (banned in Russia), Navalny Headquarters (banned in Russia), Facebook (banned in Russia), Instagram (banned in Russia), Meta (banned in Russia), Misanthropic Division (banned in Russia), Azov (banned in Russia), Muslim Brotherhood (banned in Russia), Aum Shinrikyo (banned in Russia), AUE (banned in Russia), UNA-UNSO (banned in Russia), Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar people (banned in Russia), Legion “Freedom of Russia” (armed formation, recognized as terrorist in the Russian Federation and banned), Kirill Budanov (included on the Rosfinmonitoring list of terrorists and extremists), the International LGBT public movement and its structural divisions are recognized as extremist (decision of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation dated November 30.11.2023, XNUMX)\n\n“Non-profit organizations, unregistered public associations or individuals performing the functions of a foreign agent,” as well as media outlets performing the functions of a foreign agent: “Medusa”; \"Voice of America\"; \"Realities\"; \"Present time\"; \"Radio Freedom\"; Ponomarev Lev; Ponomarev Ilya; Savitskaya; Markelov; Kamalyagin; Apakhonchich; Makarevich; Dud; Gordon; Zhdanov; Medvedev; Fedorov; Mikhail Kasyanov; Dmitry Muratov; \"Owl\"; \"Alliance of Doctors\"; \"RKK\" \"Levada Center\"; \"Memorial\"; \"Voice\"; \"Person and law\"; \"Rain\"; \"Mediazone\"; \"Deutsche Welle\"; QMS \"Caucasian Knot\"; \"Insider\"; \"New Newspaper\""
