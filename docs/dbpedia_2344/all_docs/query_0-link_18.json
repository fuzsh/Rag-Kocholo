        "text": "Mass media involvement\n\nThe Russo-Georgian War included an extensive information war. Russia spread disinformation to discredit Georgia, Ukraine and the United States even after the end of armed hostilities.\n\nRussian authorities and media\n\n[edit]\n\nAllegations of atrocities\n\n[edit]\n\nUp to 2,000 South Ossetian civilian casualties were often mentioned by Russian and South Ossetian authorities since the eruption of the conflict as the result of the Georgian-organized genocide and this was used as one of the main reasons for Russian invasion.[1][2][3][4][5] On 9 August 2008, Dmitry Rogozin, Russian envoy to NATO, claimed that Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili was a war criminal responsible for an ethnic cleansing and killing thousands of people.[6] Rogozin also claimed that the war devastated \"98 percent of Tskhinvali\".[3] Mayor of Moscow Yuri Luzhkov suggested that Saakashvili's attack on Tskhinvali was worse \"genocide\" than German atrocities during the World War II.[7] Russian ambassador to Georgia Vyacheslav Kovalenko claimed that at least 2,000 civilians were killed in Tskhinvali. He called the Georgian actions \"the most true vandalism\" and claimed that \"The city of Tskhinvali doesn't exist anymore.\"[8][9]\n\nPresident of Russia Dmitry Medvedev claimed on 10 August: \"The form this aggression took is nothing less than genocide because Georgia committed heaviest crimes — civilians were torched, sawed to pieces and rolled over by tanks.\"[10][11] Similar allegations of Georgian atrocities were made by Prime Minister of Russia Vladimir Putin.[12]\n\nOn 8–10 August 2008, Russia Today (RT) aired several news reports about the war in Georgia. The reports started with the huge caption \"GENOCIDE\".[13][14][15][16][17] Russia Today actively participated in the information war since the start of the conflict.[18]\n\nPavel Zarifullin, leader of the Eurasian Youth Union and ally of Aleksandr Dugin, claimed that Georgian soldiers captured in Tskhinvali allegedly admitted that they had orders not to show clemency and execute all peacekeepers, Ossetian women and children.[19] Russian media agency Evrazia (founded by Aleksandr Dugin) claimed that Georgian commanders executed Georgian soldiers who had refused to massacre Ossetian civilians.[20] Evrazia claimed that the South Ossetian civilian casualties had reached 4,000 already on 9 August 2008.[21]\n\nSouth Ossetian media claimed on 10 August that Georgian forces had massacred all Ossetians of all ages living in Leningor District.[22] South Ossetian government official Irina Gagloeva claimed by 11 August that Georgian forces were engaged in ritual killings by beheading the Ossetian captives on the graveyards.[23] Irina Gagloeva claimed that Georgia opened the irrigation canal, supposedly in an effort to flood the basements of Tskhinvali buildings with an intention to prevent civilians from hiding from bombings.[24] Russian media claimed that the Georgian soldiers played football with a child's head and that Georgians had deliberately destroyed the majority of graveyards in South Ossetia.[25] Russia media agency Evrazia claimed that the advancing Russian forces were discovering the concentration camps in Georgia where ethnic Abkhazian and Ossetian civilians had been held for years and that the prisoners were emaciated.[26]\n\nSouth Ossetian and Russian media claimed that the Georgian forces had burned the Orthodox church with the elderly people inside in the South Ossetian village of Khetagurovo.[27] Russian journalist Dmitry Belyakov later visited the area and found out that this report was hoax.[28]\n\nDeputy Chief of General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation Anatoliy Nogovitsyn claimed in an interview: \"I take full responsibility in saying the Russian side hasn't hit a single civilian target.\"[29] Nogovitsyn claimed that he could \"prove to the media\" that Georgia was committing genocide of the Ossetian people.[30]\n\nVladimir Putin claimed that Georgian troops \"razed ten Ossetian villages at once, ran over elderly people and children with tanks and burnt civilians alive in their sheds.\"[31] Vladimir Putin reiterated in December 2008 that Georgia had wiped out 10 Ossetian villages from the face of the earth.[32]\n\nSouth Ossetian military expert Zaur Alborov claimed that Georgian army used American psychoactive drug and such drugs were responsible for the cruelty against the civilians.[33] In late August 2008, South Ossetian envoy to Russia Dmitry Medoyev claimed in an interview: \"They started the war with the fact that the Georgian peacekeeping battalion fixedly shot in the back of the Russian soldiers. [...] And they had the same command, but they [the Georgians] brought them forward and shot them all in the back.\" He also claimed that the Georgian soldiers were under the influence of \"100% American made psychotropic drugs\".[34]\n\nJournalists were invited to Tskhinvali on 12 August 2008 by the Russian authorities. Russian Colonel Igor Konashenkov claimed during the tour of Tskhinvali, \"I think more than 500 bodies were pulled out of this part of town.\" The Guardian reporter wrote on 13 August 2008 that rumors of total destruction of Tskhinvali were exaggerations and some Tskhinvali areas were undamaged at all.[35]\n\nOn 16 August, South Ossetian interior minister Mikhail Mindzaev claimed that the actual number of civilians killed by Georgia was way higher than 2100.[36] On 20 August, the Investigative Committee of Russia reported that they had confirmed 133 civilian deaths. \"Perhaps in a while we will reach the figure that is given by the South Ossetian authorities,\" one representative said. When asked about the Georgian civilian deaths, the representative said that this issue was not their concern.[37] However, the South Ossetian officials still claimed that 1,492 were killed as the result of the Georgian attack on Tskhinvali.[38][39] Nine days later, prime minister Vladimir Putin still claimed in an interview with German ARD TV that 2,000 Russian civilians were killed during the conflict. He claimed that Russia was the victim of the aggression.[40][41] On 3 July 2009, the final figure of civilian casualties in South Ossetia was 162.[42]\n\nRussian General Anatoliy Nogovitsyn claimed in August 2009 that Georgian planes masked as Russian jets were bombing the refugees in August 2008.[43]\n\nIn August 2015, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev claimed that the Georgian attack on Tskhinvali killed \"thousands of people\" and Russia \"responded\" to this \"grave crime\".[44]\n\nAccusations of Western bias and disinformation\n\n[edit]\n\nNataliya Vitrenko, leader of the pro-Russian Progressive Socialist Party of Ukraine, declared on early 8 August 2008 that if the Russian intervention had already occurred in the first minutes of the war, \"then all Western agencies, as they are used to, in the spirit of Goebbels propaganda, would declare Russia an aggressor.\"[45]\n\nDmitry Rogozin, Russian envoy to NATO, claimed that Georgia had the \"most powerful propaganda support from the West\".[46]\n\nOn 9 August 2008, Russian media accused Azerbaijani websites of spreading pro-Georgian disinformation.[47] Pro-Russian Italian politician Giulietto Chiesa accused Italian media of anti-Russian bias.[48]\n\nOn 10 August 2008, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin blamed non-Russian media for pro-Georgian reporting on the conflict and said that the western TV channels were not broadcasting the impact of the war on the ordinary Ossetians. According to him, Western media was promoting \"a politically motivated version\".[49] However, The Washington Post, for example, later argued that Moscow was engaging in \"mythmaking\".[50]\n\nSergei Ivanov was interviewed by CNN on 11 August 2008. He accused American media of manipulating the public opinion and portraying Russia as aggressor while the situation \"was vice-versa\" because according to Ivanov, Georgia was the aggressor.[51]\n\nOn 11 August 2008, Russian ambassador to Estonia Nikolay Uspensky accused Estonian media of biased reporting.[52]\n\nOn 11 August 2008, a discussion was held at the State Duma. Maksim Mishchenko, leader of Young Russia (youth movement), declared that Russia had to recruit English-speaking people who would write pro-Russian posts on foreign web-sites and upload videos to YouTube.[53][54] The Russian Federation Council adopted a statement on 11 August calling on the western media to stop supporting Georgia.[55]\n\nOn 12 August 2008, RT accused CNN of presenting video footage of destruction in Tskhinvali in South Ossetia, shot by a Russian cameraman, as pictures of destruction in Gori, Georgia.[56][57]\n\nIsraeli journalist Zadok Yehezkeli was wounded during the Russian bombardment of Gori. Russian media agency Life.ru claimed that Yehezkeli was actually injured in traffic collision and Reuters was falsifying the information.[58][59]\n\nRussian Vzglyad newspaper opined that the support of the Russian actions by Belarus could have meant a lot for Russia against the backdrop of the information war waged by the West, and described the silence of Alexander Lukashenko on the war as \"betrayal\".[60]\n\nOn 14 August 2008, separatist leaders of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Sergei Bagapsh and Eduard Kokoity, accused the western media of waging the pre-planned information war against South Ossetia. Bagapsh praised Spanish media and suggested that French and German media became more pro-Russian.[61][62]\n\nOn 16 August 2008, representative of the pro-Russian government of South Ossetia said that more than 110 foreign journalists had been to Tskhinvali in the last 3 days, but no foreign TV channel aired the footage from Tskhinvali.[63]\n\nViktor Ozerov, chairman of the Russian Federation Council Committee on Defense and Security, claimed on 17 August that the multiple reports on Russian looting were part of \"the information war\".[64]\n\nDmitry Rogozin, Russian envoy to NATO, claimed on 18 August 2008 that the CNN became a \"mouthpiece of military propaganda of Georgia\".[65]\n\nPavel Kassin, who had been working for Der Spiegel since 1990, accused the magazine of propaganda and taking a pro-American position because none of his photos taken in South Ossetia were printed. According to Kassin, the photos were rejected on political reasons. Izvestia claimed that this was influenced by the ousting of the editor-in-chief Stefan Aust earlier in 2008, who had worked for many years in Der Spiegel, and his replacement with Georg Mascolo who had been leading the Washington subdivision of the magazine.[66]\n\nIn early September 2008, Pyotr Fyodorov, chief of the Russian Euronews, criticized the wartime reporting of the CNN and Fox as \"ugly\" and said that these TV channels were \"tools of foreign interests of Washington.\" He said that \"TV is not a mass media, but a means of propaganda.\"[67]\n\nOn 11 September 2008, Vladimir Putin accused \"propaganda machine of the so-called West\" of bias in their reporting during the early phase of the war. \"I was in Beijing, I watched all the international electronic media. There was a total silence, as if nothing was happening at all.\" Putin continued, \"It was a remarkable job, but the results were bad, and will always be bad because such work is unfair and immoral.\"[68]\n\nIn December 2008, the students of Rostov-on-Don universities sent an appeal to the State Duma. They asked to defend the honor of the Russian citizens against the information war waged by the western media.[69]\n\nAllegations against Ukraine\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Russian government claimed on 9 August that Ukraine had encouraged the \"ethnic cleansing\" in South Ossetia.[70][71][72] Deputy Chief of General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation Anatoliy Nogovitsyn claimed on 15 August that Ukrainian diplomatic license plates were found in the Georgian military warehouses which granted unlimited access to the territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.[73] The demonstrated plates were actually transit plates.[74] On 27 August 2008, pro-Russian president of South Ossetia Eduard Kokoity claimed that Ukraine was responsible for the genocide of the South Ossetian people.[75]\n\nRussian media also waged the information war against Ukraine.[76] Russian media agency Evrazia (founded by Aleksandr Dugin) suggested on 9 August 2008 that President of Ukraine Viktor Yushchenko was a war criminal responsible for thousands of deaths in South Ossetia who must be tried by the Hague Tribunal.[77] Evrazia claimed on 10 August 2008 that President Yushchenko suffered a nervous breakdown when he was told that the separatist Republic of South Ossetia was completely liberated by Russia and that he was being treated in a mental health hospital.[78] Evrazia suggested that \"neo-Nazi Ukraine\" was the main stooge of the President of the United States and was waging an information war against Russia in relation to the conflict in Georgia.[21] Russian media agency Utro.ru claimed that by taking the side of Georgia, the Kyiv regime was deliberately waging the war against Russia in violation of 1997 Russian–Ukrainian Friendship Treaty.[79] When the Abkhaz forces captured the Kodori Valley in August 2008, the Russian TV Zvezda claimed that the found Georgian weaponry was of Ukrainian origin, while actually it was from Serbia.[76] In late August 2008, Izvestia claimed that 6 American Hummers captured in Poti were manufactured in Ukraine.[80]\n\nRussian blogger quoted one South Ossetian refugee in Vladikavkaz as claiming on 10 August 2008 that Ukrainian mercenaries had raped and beheaded two girls in the village of Tsunar.[81] Russian journalist Ilya Azar quoted another refugee as claiming that Ossetian women were raped by Ukrainian mercenaries.[82] Ilya Azar suggested that the ordinary Ossetians had a penchant for lying when he wrote on 12 August that Ossetians had not yet invented the stories about live burials of the Ossetians performed by the Georgians, \"but there is no doubt that there will be no shortage\".[83]\n\nPavel Zarifullin, leader of the Eurasian Youth Union and ally of Aleksandr Dugin, claimed that the Ukrainian civil war had begun in South Ossetia because Ukrainian soldiers were allegedly fighting on both sides of the war.[84][85] Evrazia claimed on 12 August that Russian peacekeepers captured 16 members of Ukrainian Spetsnaz near Gori, Georgia responsible for the massacres of the Ossetian civilians. It was claimed that this case was one of the examples of the Ukrainian military aggression.[86][87] Russian media agency Rosbalt claimed that the corpses of Ukrainian mercenaries from Lviv were found in Tskhinvali.[88] Evrazia claimed on 17 August that alleged Ukrainian POW had testified in Vladikavkaz that 300 Ukrainian mercenaries participated in the alleged genocide.[89] Krasnaya Zvezda newspaper quoted the Russian peacekeeper as saying that one member of the captured Georgian tank crew had turned out to be Ukrainian. The journalist emphasized that the history of Russia was not being created neither in Tbilisi nor Kyiv.[90]\n\nIn early September, Eastern Ukrainian humorous web-portal parodying pro-Russian political party published the children's paintings, related to the Russo-Georgian war and intended to showcase the supposed impact by pro-Russian propaganda. The portal commented that the paintings \"denounce the Georgian-Ukrainian military machine\". One of the graphic paintings depicted a Russian tank crushing alleged Ukrainian Nazi soldier with Swastika in South Ossetia. Another painting showed \"just\" General Anatoly Nogovitsyn shooting Georgian spy during his press-conference.[91][92]\n\nIn September 2008, Russian media claimed that the United States would encourage the second Georgian invasion of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in September–October and the second front would be opened in Ukraine. Russian media stressed that the Ukrainian leadership was \"ready to enter into a military conflict with Russia on the side of Georgia, if Washington demands it.\"[93]\n\nSouth Ossetian authorities claimed that activists of the UNA-UNSO had participated in the attack on South Ossetia on 8 August 2008.[94] Russian media claimed that USNS Pathfinder (T-AGS-60) transported the bodies of Ukrainian servicemen killed in Georgia, which were unloaded on two Kamaz trucks in Crimea during the night.[76][95] Russian media agency Utro.ru claimed that the Georgian wartime TV footage of the crushing of the Georgian civilian cars in Igoeti by the Russian armored column was a hoax and the Russian officer shown in the video was actually Ukrainian mercenary.[96]\n\nIn October 2008, Russian media claimed that Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko had known of Saakashvili's plans to launch the \"aggression\" against South Ossetia and Russia, and had deliberately armed Georgia before August 2008.[76]\n\nIn November 2008, Russian deputy foreign minister Grigory Karasin criticized Kyiv for prohibiting pro-Russian documentary \"War 08.08.08\", saying that this was an \"uncivilized episode\". He accused the Ukrainian government of \"greenlighting\" anti-Russian informational materials.[97]\n\nIn late December 2008, chief of the Air Defence Troops of the Russian Ground Forces Mikhail Krush claimed that \"for the first time in recent history, Ukraine deliberately fought against the Russian Federation\" in August 2008.[98] Russian Prosecutor General Yury Chaika presented a white paper about the war, titled \"The Ossetian Tragedy\". Russian media stressed that Russian president Medvedev paid attention to a photo of alleged Ukrainian mercenary's passport.[99]\n\nRussian journalist Arkady Mamontov shot a documentary movie Friend – foe on the alleged Ukrainian military participation in the August 2008 war and the making of the movie lasted for 5 months. The movie premiered on Russia-1 TV channel on 1 February 2009.[100] Mamontov claimed that he had found Ukrainian reservists who had been given two choices by 13 August 2008: either to combat the results of the flooding in the Carpathian Mountains for free or to fight against Russia for money in Georgia.[101] Mamontov also claimed that President Yushchenko was \"an agent of American imperialism\" who had sent ethnic Russian citizens of Ukraine to Georgia for killing the Russians.[102]\n\nIn early 2009, Russian media published an article, titled \"Gastarbeiters of the war\", which alleged that Ukrainian president Yushchenko had awarded an apartment to the Ukrainian officer for downing of the Russian warplane in Georgia. \"Orange\" propaganda was accused of brainwashing the Ukrainian servicemen into fighting against brotherly Russia in Georgia. Russian media claimed that Ukrainian defense minister Yuriy Yekhanurov had prepared the units of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine for deployment to South Ossetia before August 2008 and that Ukrainian spies dressed in Russian uniforms were subverting the Russian army in August 2008. It was claimed that Ukraine was culturing Nazism.[103][104]\n\nIn April 2009, Russian Foreign Ministry official Andrei Nesterenko claimed that Ukraine and the United States were actively encouraging Georgia's plans of revanchism.[105][106]\n\nIn August 2009, Russian president Medvedev claimed that Ukrainian authorities were also responsible for the war crimes against Russian civilians and peacekeepers in Tskhinvali.[107]\n\nThe Russian Investigative Committee of the Prosecutor's Office claimed in August 2009 that they had the evidence of mercenaries from UNA-UNSO fighting alongside the Georgians.[108] In March 2010, the Russian investigators claimed that Ukrainian mercenaries were recruited and financially supported by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia.[109]\n\nIn late September 2009, Ukrainian tabloid Segodnya (owned by Rinat Akhmetov, member of the pro-Russian Party of Regions) claimed that the General Prosecutor's Office of Ukraine had allegedly established that Ukrainian military specialists had participated in the war in 2008. After this, Russian TV channels broadcast multiple reports on the Ukrainian participation in the 2008 war. However, the Ukrainian General Prosecutor's Office announced in several days that it had confirmed that no Ukrainian military had participated in the conflict. Ukrainian president Yushchenko told the Financial Times that the Russian information attack intended to manipulate the elections in Ukraine. It is believed that the report of Segodnya intended to provoke anti-Ukrainian information campaign in Russia.[110]\n\nIn August 2012, the Investigative Committee of Russia claimed that they confirmed the attempts to discredit the Russian military. According to the Committee, prior to the Russian entrance into Gori, Ukrainian mercenaries were dressed as the Russian troops. Ukrainians allegedly participated in the making of photo and video footage that showed the attacks on civilians and looting in the Georgian villages.[111][112]\n\nIn August 2023, Artem Turov, deputy chairman of the State Duma Committee on the CIS Affairs and Relations with Compatriots, claimed that \"Ukrainian neo-Nazis\" were attempting to exterminate the Russian people and culture on the territory of \"former Ukraine\" akin to attempted \"genocide\" in South Ossetia foiled by Russia.[113]\n\nClaims of foreign aid and mercenaries\n\n[edit]\n\nPro-Russian president of South Ossetia Eduard Kokoity claimed on 10 August that South Ossetia had discovered Baltic, Ukrainian, African and East Asian mercenaries among the enemy corpses in Tskhinvali.[114][115] Russian media claimed that black NATO instructor had been captured in the village of Dzari, who was moved to Vladikavkaz for questioning.[116] Russian media claimed that a pilot of the downed Georgian Sukhoi Su-25 did not speak neither Georgian nor Russian, but only English language.[117] On 11 August, Anatoliy Nogovitsyn, Deputy Chief of the Russian General Staff, claimed that there were Georgian soldiers of black African descent and with non-Georgian passports in the war zone. North Ossetian government official claimed that several pro-Georgian foreign fighters had arrived at Vladikavkaz hospital.[118] On 14 August, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov also alleged that foreign mercenaries had participated in the war on the Georgian side.[119] Anatoliy Nogovitsyn claimed on 19 August that three Arab nationals were among the Georgian soldiers arrested near Poti.[120]\n\nOn 11 August 2008, Russian media agency Evrazia claimed that the Russians had shot down a helicopter transporting 4 American soldiers near Gori.[121] Evrazia claimed on 12 August that the South Ossetian forces had captured 15 Kamaz trucks containing more than 300 dead Georgian soldiers, among them 40 black Africans and Arabs.[122]\n\nOn 12 August 2008, Russian media claimed that the United States would use Ukrainian and Baltic mercenaries to commit atrocities against Georgian civilians in western Georgia, which would then be blamed on the Russian forces.[123][124] On 13 August, Russian media claimed that the wounded Russian pilot of downed Tu-22 was raped by underage African mercenaries.[125] On 17 August, the Russian Ministry of Defence claimed that Georgia planned to infiltrate Gori and stage \"a major provocative act\" with Ukrainian and Chechen mercenaries. Earlier, Georgian authorities had alleged that Russian troops would dress in Georgian military uniforms to stage Georgian violation of the ceasefire agreement.[126] Russian claims of foreign mercenaries fighting for Georgia were unfounded.[127]\n\nRussia alleged that an American citizen fought with Georgian forces. On 28 August 2008, General Anatoly Nogovitsyn displayed photocopies of an American passport, claiming that the passport was found at a Georgian fighting position.[128] The passport owner and U.S. authorities denied the accusation, saying that his passport was lost elsewhere.[129]\n\nVladimir Putin claimed in an interview with the CNN on 28 August 2008 that U.S. President George W. Bush staged the war in Georgia to get the Republican Party's 2008 U.S. presidential candidate Senator John McCain into the White House. Putin accused the United States of encouraging Georgia to use force.[130][131] Putin claimed, \"U.S. citizens were indeed in the area in conflict. They were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered, and the only one who can give such orders is their leader.\"[132][133]\n\nOn 29 August 2008, Russian media agency Evrazia claimed that American ships reconsidered docking in Poti after the Russians threatened to search the ships for weapons deliveries.[134]\n\nIn November 2008, Alexander Bastrykin, Chairman of the Investigative Committee of the Prosecutor General's Office, claimed that South Ossetia was invaded by mercenaries from the United States, Czech Republic, Turkey, Ukraine and Chechnya in August 2008.[109] Bastrykin claimed in December 2008 that 70 thousand Georgian soldiers had fought in the war.[135]\n\nBias in state-run media and censorship\n\n[edit]\n\nDeputy Chief of General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation Anatoliy Nogovitsyn and Russian ambassador to the UN Vitaly Churkin were the main Russian speakers who were regularly in contact with the press during the war.[136] General Nogovitsyn became the third most quoted man in Russia after President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin.[137]\n\nOn late 8 August 2008, Lenta.Ru noted that the Russian TV channels were giving much attention to the information provided by the South Ossetian side.[138] The Moscow Times observed on 11 August that \"Russian television is flush with footage of misery left by the Georgian assault in the separatist district of South Ossetia, but few, if any, reports mention Russia's bombing of Georgia.\"[139][140]\n\nDeputy State Duma Chairman Vladimir Zhirinovsky criticized the Radio station Echo of Moscow for their coverage of the conflict on 11 August 2008.[141] Aleksandr Dugin declared by 18 August 2008 that he would be the most proud of Russia on the day Echo of Moscow was shut down and Valeria Novodvorskaya was disposed of.[142] Thirty-five foremost media figures, among them the editor-in-chief of Echo of Moscow Alexei Venediktov, were gathered on 29 August 2008 in Sochi to meet with Prime Minister Putin, where the coverage of the war by the Echo of Moscow was disapproved by Putin.[143] Putin reportedly warned Venediktov that he would be held responsible.[144] After this meeting, the staff received instructions from their editor-in-chief that they should \"pay careful attention\" to their reporting and Valeria Novodvorskaya would no longer be aired for the duration of several months.[145] In response, Novodvorskaya compared Putin to a dragon who was demanding a girl (radio station) as sacrificial offering from Venediktov.[146] The Prosecutors of Dagestan had launched an investigation into another commentator of Echo of Moscow Yulia Latynina.[147][148] In late September 2008, Aleksandr Dugin complained that he was banned by Echo of Moscow for his pro-government views on Georgia.[149]\n\nWilliam Dunbar, a reporter for RT TV in Georgia, quit his job in protest of bias in the Russian media and said he had been cancelled since he reported on Russian bombing of Georgia. However, sources at RT TV called Dunbar's assertions \"nonsense\", with one journalist rejecting the accusation of bias and defending pro-Russian stance.[150] William Dunbar told The Wall Street Journal that his editors ignored a news on the August 1 attack on the Georgian villages by the South Ossetians.[151]\n\nRoskomnadzor issued a warning to Saint Petersburg edition of Novaya Gazeta for extremism because the newspaper had reported on the plans of the Movement Against Illegal Immigration to raid the places of the concentration of ethnic Georgians in Saint Petersburg.[152]\n\nOn 16 August 2008, The New York Times reported that journalists were being denied admission to Georgian villages by Russian authorities.[153] On 17 August 2008, The New York Times reported that while Russian officials had restricted freedom of movement of Western journalists in the areas under its control, Russian journalists had unrestricted access to territories under Russian control.[154] As of 19 August, Western journalists managed to document mainly stories of Georgian civilians, but did not manage to evaluate the destruction in the north of the conflict zone due to Russian restrictions.[155] Even Chinese journalist was not allowed into South Ossetia during the war.[136] Finnish and Hungarian journalists stated in September 2008 that the western journalists wanted to report from Tskhinvali during the war, but the Russian military did not allow them to do so.[156]\n\nIn August 2008, historian Boris Vadimovich Sokolov wrote an article in Gazeta newspaper entitled \"Did Saakashvili Win or Lose?\" where the narrative of the Russian leadership was disputed. Soon, he was first dismissed by the newspaper and then by the Russian State Social University after the calls from the administration of Russia's president.[157][158][159]\n\nIn late September, Russian media reported that it was deputy Kremlin Chief of Staff Alexey Gromov who was coordinating the Russian media during the war.[160][161] In early August 2008, Russian Newsweek reported several days before the invasion of Georgia that Vladimir Putin had established tight control over the federal TV channels after Beslan school siege in 2004 and Putin's former press-secretary Alexey Gromov was talking with the heads of the federal TV Channels several times in a day. Russian Newsweek described in detail how the political news broadcasts were planned for transmission on TV.[162]\n\nRussian journalist Yulia Latynina alleged in December 2008 that she was being followed and threatened either for her criticism of South Ossetian president Eduard Kokoity or her articles disputing the official narrative of the war.[163][164]\n\nPersonal attacks against Georgian president Saakashvili\n\n[edit]\n\nRussian media agency Evrazia claimed on 10 August that Sandra Roelofs, wife of President Saakashvili, had a nervous breakdown and was planning to undergo psychotherapy in the USA.

Head of the OSCE mission in Georgia Terhi Hakala expressed her concern over the disinformation campaign against the OSCE.[209]\n\nRussian media claimed that the United States had delivered money printing machinery to Georgia in the naval humanitarian operation; Georgia was allegedly going to circulate fake Russian banknotes for sabotaging the financial system of Russia.[210] On 16 October 2008, Izvestia claimed that Georgia would launch the terror attacks in Russia under the cover of the extremist organization \"Patriots of Georgia\". There allegedly would be bombings of residential apartments in Saint Petersburg and Sochi, while a mass shooting of civilians allegedly would take place in downtown Moscow.[210][211] However, deputy director of South Ossetian OSInform Agency Yuri Beteev questioned the existence of alleged terrorist organization Patriots of Georgia.[212] On 22 October 2008, Izvestia claimed that Georgia provided the Chechen insurgents with Polish anti-aircraft missiles, and that Ukraine and the United States had been involved in the transportation of the missiles.[210] Russian media claimed in late December 2008 that head of Special Foreign Intelligence Service of Georgia Gela Bezhuashvili was responsible for recruiting the \"Patriots of Georgia\" to organize the terror attacks in Russia. Russian media claimed that Georgia had another plan of terror attack involving aircraft hijacking, which would be crashed into the Moscow Airport.

Russian journalist noted that the previous accusation had contained an important ideological motif: Ukrainian responsibility for Russia's troubles. Actually no Georgian biolaboratory existed at the time and this new information attack on Georgia was compared to the medieval accusation of Jews of being responsible for the Black Death. Russian journalist suggested that Russian authorities could also blame the origins of Avian influenza and Atypical pneumonia on alleged secret Georgian biolaboratories.[216]\n\nIn May 2009, Russian media claimed that strange yellow rain in Abkhazia could be caused by the NATO exercises in Georgia.[217]\n\nIn August 2009, Alexander Bastrykin, Chairman of the Investigative Committee of the Prosecutor General's Office, claimed that Russian investigators had found Georgian plans to poison water in Tskhinvali in August 2008.[218]\n\nRussian media claimed that American instructors began preparing the Georgian Army in August 2009 not for Afghanistan, but for sabotage and subversion against the Russian forces.

South Ossetian media claimed that there never had been any outbreak of African swine fever virus in South Ossetia before the construction of the Georgian biolaboratories.[224] In September 2018, former Georgian security minister Igor Giorgadze, residing in exile in Russia, published a set of documents allegedly proving that the development of biological agents and unethical human experimentation were taking place at the Lugar Research Center near Tbilisi. Channel One Russia claimed that The Pentagon had built an insect farm in the Lugar laboratory in Tbilisi.[225] Vladimir Putin noted Giorgadze's allegations. Putin thus effectively greenlighted information war against Georgia and the United States.[226] In November 2018, an investigation by BBC refuted Giorgadze's claims.[227] In 2019, South Ossetian media claimed that the Lugar laboratory was responsible for the sudden deaths of 3 Georgian military servicemen. Gennady Onishchenko claimed that the Lugar laboratory was researching genetically modified mosquitos for the delivery of the viruses to Russia. South Ossetian media claimed that American biolaboratories in the former Soviet Union were responsible for the numerous outbreaks, such as an alleged outbreak of smallpox in Uzbekistan in 2017.[228] In 2020, Russian REN TV claimed that COVID-19 was created in the Lugar laboratory in Tbilisi.[229][230] In 2022, Igor Kirillov, Commander of the Troops of Radiological, Chemical and Biological Defence of the Russian Armed Forces, claimed that African swine fever virus reached Russia, Europe and China from \"Pentagon's biolaboratory\" in Georgia.

The movie was shown at the Headquarters of the United Nations in September 2008.[234]\n\nRussian documentary War 08.08.08. The Art of Betrayal, promoting the Russian narrative on the war, was released in October 2008.[235] Channel One Russia produced a feature movie Olympus Inferno pushing the Russian propaganda narrative on the Georgian responsibility for the war, which was released in March 2009.[236] Screenwriter of War 08.08.08. claimed that Olympus Inferno was more documentary than a feature movie and demonstrated the treachery of Dmitry Sanakoev, pro-Georgian president of South Ossetia.[237]\n\nChannel One Russia aired the documentary named \"War in the live\" on 8 August 2009, which included unauthentic footage of staged scenes. The film depicted American journalist David Axe as allegedly claiming that he had shot one of the wartime photos in Iraq. The photo was actually shot by Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko in the Georgian village near South Ossetia and Axe himself later stated that he had never claimed the photo as his own.[238][239] Journalist Arkady Babchenko threatened to submit a lawsuit against Channel One.[240]\n\nIn late October 2009, Serbian film director Emir Kusturica refused to begin shooting of pro-Russian movie about the war due to time constraints.

The Foundation's bloggers claimed that the photos of the Georgian victims of the Russian bombing were staged. They invented Alexei Venediktov's interview with the photographer in which the photographer allegedly admitted to retorting to falsehood.[136]\n\nOn 8 August 2008, 20:00 news bulletin of the Russian TV channels had more watchers than the broadcast of the 2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony.[243] In the following days, some humor shows were cancelled and top 5 popular shows in Moscow became the news programs.[244]\n\nOne Russian journalist located in Tskhinvali said on 9 August that Boris Chochiev, deputy of pro-Russian president of South Ossetia Eduard Kokoity, had told journalists that the Russian 58th Army had never been in Tskhinvali despite the information disseminated by Channel One Russia.[245]\n\nBy 10 August 2008, nationalist Russian bloggers had claimed that the photos of the Georgian victims of the bombing of Gori were staged.

He praised the articles published in the British and Japanese newspapers because they were better written than domestic Russian articles.[251]\n\nRussian journalist Nikolai Svanidze claimed on 11 August 2008 that Russia was not warring against Georgia and Saakashvili was winning a propaganda war by making the world believe that Russia was waging the war against Georgia.[252]\n\nOn 12 August 2008, it was claimed that the Georgian army contained a Spetsnaz battalion named after Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.[253]\n\nGeneral Anatoliy Nogovitsyn claimed that Russia did not have the Georgian prisoner of wars, but the Russian forces were taking care of the \"lost\" and \"voluntarily surrendered\" Georgian soldiers. He objected to the use of the term of \"prisoner of war\" in relation to the peacekeeping operation.[254]\n\n13–31 August 2008\n\n[edit]\n\nRussian General Anatoliy Nogovitsyn claimed on 13 August 2008 that Georgian president Saakashvili had never been to Gori, Georgia during the war.

He criticized the Estonian government and media for anti-Russian stance.[274]\n\nOn 19 August 2008, the print edition of Izvestia newspaper came out with a headline on the first page suggesting that the article would detail the atrocities by the Georgian military; however, the announced article only described how the wounded Georgian saved the Ossetian family.[275]\n\nRussian Defence Ministry spokesman Andrei Klyuchnikov told the journalists on 19 August, \"I agree we lost the information war in the first few days, but we have nothing to hide here.\"[276]\n\nRussian military intelligence claimed on 20 August that Georgia was planning to stage a provocation in the next few days and portray Georgian military corpses as civilian casualties.[277]\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov complained in an op-ed for Newsweek on 23 August that Georgia was employing anti-Russian propaganda.[278]\n\nLife.ru claimed that the Central Intelligence Agency was preparing the evacuation of Georgian president Saakashvili and the United States Marine Corps would carry out the operation to remove Saakashvili from his office.[279]\n\nRest of 2008\n\n[edit]\n\nIn early September 2008, Russian General Anatoly Nogovitsyn accused Georgia of adopting brainwashing as state policy and organizing staged protests against the Russian forces on the border of South Ossetia for filming by the western journalists.[280]\n\nIn late September 2008, government-issued Rossiyskaya Gazeta claimed that the region of Mingrelia began the process of secession from Georgia by printing its own currency.[281]\n\nIn late October, a bank run took place in Moscow as large numbers of Russian citizens withdrew deposits from the banks in expectation of the rapid fall of exchange rate. Russian newspaper Moskovskij Komsomolets alleged that the Georgian media hoax was responsible for this panic.[282][283]\n\nAlexander Brod of the Moscow Bureau for Human Rights and Russian delegation to the United Nations held a presentation of the photo album on the war in New York City in late October 2008. Brod claimed that Georgian troops were under the influence of psychoactive drugs and therefore were capable of committing atrocities against civilians.[284]\n\nIn November 2008, Russian media published an alleged testimony by Giorgi Antsukhelidze where Antsukhelidze allegedly admitted to deliberately shelling the Russian peacekeeping base without any response from Russian peacekeepers. Antsukhelidze allegedly claimed that his colleagues killed no less 20 civilians in Tskhinvali. Antsukhelidze allegedly claimed that he personally saw no less than 15 Ukrainian and no less than 10 American servicemen in other Georgian units deployed in South Ossetia.[285] Antsukhelidze had been killed in captivity by 10 August 2008, so he could not have given this testimony in November 2008, thus making this testimony a hoax.\n\nIn late November 2008, an exhibition of the photos taken in South Ossetia by RIA Novosti journalists was held in Rome. Italian politician Giulietto Chiesa attended the event and criticized the western media coverage of the conflict.[286]\n\nIn December 2008, pro-Russian president of South Ossetia Eduard Kokoity claimed that South Ossetia had obtained a Hard disk drive of the Georgian intelligence in August 2008, which contained the proof of Vakhtang Kikabidze's kissing with Dmitry Sanakoev.

He further claimed that the regime of the United States and Saakashvili were spreading disinformation about mismanagement of Russian money granted for the post-war reconstruction of South Ossetia. Even Kokoity's own father was not convinced whether the Ossetians were right in the war.[289]\n\nIn December 2008, Russian media claimed that Georgia had assassinated pro-Georgian leader of South Ossetia Dmitry Sanakoev, while Sanakoev was actually alive.[290]\n\nSince 2009\n\n[edit]\n\nIn January 2009, Russian soldier Aleksandr Glukhov ran away from South Ossetia and defected to Georgia. The event caused commotion in the print media in Russia, but was completely ignored by the federal TV channels. Lenta.ru, analyzing the Russian TV behavior, recalled that the coverage of the conflict in the Uzbekistani media was largely absent in August 2008 and the word \"war\" was not mentioned.[291]\n\nIn February 2009, pro-Russian president of South Ossetia Eduard Kokoity awarded the Order of Honor to Oleg Dobrodeev, chairman of the All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company, and the Order of Friendship to Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of Russia Today.

Russian journalists were monitoring Georgia–South Ossetia border with video cameras to shoot the beginning of the alleged Georgian invasion and satellites were also monitoring the border, so Georgia would not again win the information war.[294]\n\nOn 21 April 2009, the Russian Federal Security Service claimed that Ukrainian citizen was working in Sochi as spy for Georgia and that the arrested Georgian spy had testified to having cooperated with Chechen separatists in the preparation of anti-Russian propaganda actions.[295] The alleged Georgian spy himself stated that he was surprised by the accusation and that he had already left Russia without any problem before the announcement.[296]\n\nIn June 2009, Russian lawmakers and public figures discussed the bad international image of Russia. Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of Russia Today, compared the foreign media interest in the recent dispersal of Moscow Pride parade to that of the wartime interest in Georgia.[297]\n\nIn June 2009, Georgian officer Alik Bzhania from Ochamchire, who had fled Georgia for Russia, requested political asylum in Russia. Bzhania gave an interview to Echo of Moscow. He was nicknamed by Russian media as \"Georgian Glukhov\".[298] Many Russians, who had listened to radio interview of Bzhania, noted that the officer did not speak in Georgian accent. Gruziya Online noted that Bzhania was Abkhaz surname and suggested that this case was another example of Russian propaganda.[299] Russian agency Lenta.ru recalled that Putin had threatened Alexei Venediktov in August 2008 that the latter would have to \"answer\" for his station's reporting; it was suggested that the airing of the Georgian defector exactly by Echo of Moscow, not by Channel One Russia, could be a \"successful\" answer to Putin.[300]\n\nIn June 2009, pro-government Russian media intensified propaganda campaign against Georgia, claiming that Georgia was preparing a new war while at the same time Russian military exercises in the North Caucasus were being held.[301][302] Russian media claimed that the appointment of John R. Bass, the former head of the State Department's Operations Department for the Protection of American Citizens Abroad in Conflicts, as the new US Ambassador to Georgia was evidence that Georgia and the United States were preparing a new \"aggression\" against Russia and South Ossetia.[303]\n\nIn July 2009, Russian deputy foreign minister Grigory Karasin accused Georgia of waging information war against Russia. Karasin claimed that Georgia was substituting the \"truth\" about August 2008 events with \"demagoguery\".[304] South Ossetian president Eduard Kokoity claimed that the United States, Ukraine and Israel were responsible for the genocide of the Ossetian people. He said that the West had waged a deliberate information war against South Ossetia.[305]\n\nIn August 2009, the government of South Ossetia hired American PR company Saylor Company to change international public opinion and counter Georgian \"disinformation\" about the war.[306] The president of Saylor Company, Marc Saylor, had already been hired by South Ossetian activist Lira Tskhovrebova in 2008, but the PR campaign had failed as the western journalists had obtained proofs of Tskhovrebova's ties with the KGB.[307]\n\nIn August 2012, Russian TV channel 100 TV reported on President Dmitry Medvedev's visit to South Ossetia and claimed that Tskhinvali was almost rebuilt in the four years since the war, while actually airing the Georgian city of Gori and newly-built settlement of Georgian refugees in Tserovani. Georgian president Saakashvili commented on this report that Russia's main weapon was lies alongside tanks and planes.[308]\n\nAlthough Russia was the victor in the August war, Russian propaganda did not fare well in information warfare to defend Russia's actions. After the 2008 war, Russia Today TV channel was reformed. Anton Shekhovtsov discussed in his October 2017 report how Russia began to wage an intensive propaganda war against the West and using the far-right allies in the West.[309] Russia adopted a new military doctrine with emphasis on information warfare in 2014. Former Chief of the Russian General Staff Yuri Baluyevsky was quoted as saying:\n\n\"Information warfare has come to the fore. A battle is underway for the spirit and consciousness of the masses. A victory in this war would be perhaps more decisive than a victory in a classic war. Even without bloodshed, such a victory would cause a demoralising and paralysing shock to the adversary.\"[310]\n\nFox News broadcast\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 13 August 2008, Fox News interviewed 12-year-old Ossetian-American girl Amanda Kokoeva and her aunt Laura Tedeeva-Korewicki, who had returned from South Ossetia.[311] Fox began the interview by emphasizing the experiences of a 12-year-old girl. Invited to tell about Georgian bombings, the 12-year-old girl and her aunt said they were saved by Russians. As the aunt started to claim the conflict was started by Saakashvili, Fox News cut the interview for commercials. When the break ended and they were back on the air, Fox granted the aunt additional time to finish her thoughts during the last minute of the program at which time she started to blame the Georgian government but explicitly distinguished it from the Georgian people. Thereafter before the end of the program the anchorman said that there were grey areas in war.[312] CBS also had an interview with this girl before.[313]\n\nThis incident was highlighted in particular on NTV (Russia) and Russia 1. However, the Russian channels allowed many inaccuracies and even editing themselves. First both channels created impression that the anchor stopped the conversation as soon as Amanda's aunt expressed the thought that it was Georgia to blame for the conflict. However, they failed to show that Amanda has been saying the same for almost a minute before, and the anchor did not interrupt her. Second Russia 1 edited the sound superimposing what is supposed to be anchors cough on Amanda's aunt talk, creating an impression that he was trying to prevent audience from hearing her.[314] While in the original footage this sound is absent.[315] The reporters from NTV (Russia) translated the words of Amanda thanking Russian troops while showing Amanda's aunt talking.[316] Both channels also failed to translate the words of an anchor that the commercial break would interrupt the broadcast whether they liked it or not.[314][316]\n\nDeputy Kremlin Chief of Staff Alexey Gromov stated that the attitude of the Fox News and its news anchor was \"the height of shamelessness\".[317] Georgian journalist Gela Vasadze published a letter questioning the story of Kokoeva that the Cafés were working at all in Tskhinvali on 7 August 2008 and that 12-year-old girl was sitting at a Café so late in the night when the battle began.[318] The New York Times reported that a clip of a Fox News Channel live interview with a 12-year-old girl and her aunt was used by the Kremlin as proof of pro-Georgian censorship. Regarding the clip, a Russian news anchor was quoted as commenting that \"any means available\" would be used to discredit Russia. The NYT observed that the Russian dub of the Fox anchor's voice \"even coughs and groans loudly [...] something that did not happen in the original.\"[319]\n\nIn July 2013, South Ossetian president Leonid Tibilov awarded Amanda Kokoeva with the certificate of honor.[320] In August 2017, South Ossetian president Anatoly Bibilov awarded the Order of Friendship \"for a great personal contribution to breaking through the information blockade\" to Kokoeva during her wedding in Tskhinvali.[321]\n\nWesterners supporting Russian propaganda\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Guardian published articles with anti-American and pro-Russian slant in 2008, such as opinion pieces by Seumas Milne criticizing Georgia for killing \"several hundred civilians\",[322][323] and provoking Russia.[324]\n\nBBC News world affairs correspondent Paul Reynolds filed a story on 15 August 2008, which stated that Russians \"have not yet learned how to play the media game.\" Reynolds called attention to the fact that most western journalists were stationed in Georgia and the cause of this, as he wrote, was Russia's reluctance to admit western media into South Ossetia. He also wrote about how \"mud\" thrown had \"stuck\" to Russia and how the Bush administration was \"trying to turn a failed military operation by Georgia into a successful diplomatic operation against Russia.\"[325]\n\nIn early September 2008, the German newspaper Der Spiegel was caught in fabrication of anti-Georgian claims. The paper had published an article saying that internal reports from the OSCE effectively blamed Georgia for the war. However, OSCE spokesperson Martin Nesirky called this information \"ludicrous\" and said that no OSCE report \"contains information of the kind mentioned in the Der Spiegel story.\"[326] In March 2009, Moscow-based journalist Uwe Klussman working for Der Spiegel used faked document allegedly issued by Georgian president to impute Georgia in starting the war in his report.[327] German journalist Klussman again claimed in June 2009 that the head of the commission, Heidi Tagliavini, did not have the courage to question Daniel Fried, official of the United States Department of State, regarding the beginning of the war. Tagliavini rejected the article as \"completely made up\" and said that she had talked with Fried in May 2009. Another member of the commission stated that the quote attributed to him was invented.[328]\n\nIn October 2008, Herbert P. Bix criticized \"American propaganda\" for supporting Georgia \"by disseminating completely one-sided war news\" and supported Vladimir Putin's stance on the western propaganda.[329]\n\nMark Ames claimed in December 2008, that the reporting of The New York Times was biased towards Georgia.[330]\n\nPolish journalist Viktor Bater stated in August 2009 that the leadership of Telewizja Polska had censored his pro-Russian report in August 2008 and fired him.[331] Bater was told that he was incapable of unbiased reporting on the Caucasian conflicts because his wife was an ethnic Abkhaz.[332]\n\nAssessments by independent Russian and CIS personalities\n\n[edit]\n\n7–12 August 2008\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 7 August 2008, RBK Daily noted that the Georgian and South Ossetian reports on the attacks on their respective villages contradicted each other due to the information war being waged.[333]\n\nOn 8 August 2008, host of Echo of Moscow Alexei Venediktov stated: \"Whoever kills journalists or deprives journalists of the opportunity to work, that side is not interested in truthful coverage of the conflict.\"[334]\n\nOn 10 August 2008, Sergei Kovalev, Lev Ponomaryov, Natalya Gorbanevskaya, Viktor Fainberg and other Russian human rights activists issued a statement condemning Russia's actions. The statement noted how the Russian propaganda was \"keeping silent about the shelling of Georgian villages by the armed formations of the regime of Eduard Kokoity\" before the Russian invasion.[335]\n\nOn 11 August 2008, Yulia Latynina observed that the Russian TV instantly reported that the Russian forces retook Tskhinvali as soon as Russian president Medvedev had announced the Russian intervention in the conflict in South Ossetia on Friday, while the next day the civilians hiding in the basements had no access to the water as Georgian snipers were somehow shooting the Ossetian civilians in the Russian-controlled city and journalists were asking for the humanitarian corridor. Latynina asked why Vitaly Churkin was demanding to return to status-quo from Georgia if the Russian forces were already controlling Tskhinvali. Latynina stated: \"For two and a half days, Russian soldiers were held hostage by television lies.\"[336][337] Latynina wrote in October 2008 that the Russian TV waged Orwellian propaganda against Georgia comparable to the 1940s propaganda during the war with Finland. Latynina criticized the Russian propaganda talking points that Georgia did not have neither the right to purchase the foreign weaponry nor the right to a defense.[338] Latynina also compared the propaganda on alleged Georgian atrocities spread by Channel One Russia and RTR to anti-Semitic blood libel.[339]\n\nRussian actor Oleg Basilashvili suggested on 11 August 2008 that he did not believe that the Russian media sources were objective.[252] Russian writer Boris Akunin stated on 13 August that the Russian TV did not instill any trust in him and he had to recheck every fact with Reuters.[340] On 16 August, Basilashvili said on the air on Echo of Moscow that the Russian TV was transforming its viewers into \"docile cattle-like mass\". Akunin suggested that all Russian TV channels had the same manager and they were capable of shaping public consciousness against Georgians.[341]\n\nNikolai Zlobin wrote in Vedomosti newspaper on 11 August 2008 that Russia lost the information war because the Russian leadership did not establish direct contact with the domestic or international audiences or journalists.[342] An editorial by Russian newspaper Vedomosti stated on 13 August that Russia \"lives in the information space. On how it looks in the eyes of others depends its real position in the world and its real economy.\" Georgian government was more appealing to the international TV audiences because the Georgians were communicating in the native tongue of the international audiences and were not refraining from answering the difficult questions. The editorial stated that it would have been better for Russia to have hired a professional spokesman.[343]\n\nKyrgyzstani political expert Askarbek Mambetaliev stated on 11 August that the majority of the population of the Commonwealth of Independent States did not have access to objective non-Russian sources on the war and had to accept the one-sided information provided by the Russian TV.[344]\n\nAnar Mammadkhanov, member of the National Assembly of Azerbaijan, compared the arguments of the Russian authorities used in the information war to the arguments of Movladi Udugov, information minister of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria.[345] Azerbaijani pundit Akper Gasanov wrote that the disinformation played a great role in the plans of the aggressor to achieve its goals and criticized the Russian media for spreading disinformation to make Azerbaijan and Ukraine look like participants of the war in Georgia. Gasanov argued that the Russian propaganda was copying American disinformation method of inflating civilian casualties and inventing enemy atrocities in Kosovo.[346]\n\nReporter wrote for Novaya Gazeta that he had been told that the Georgian sniper had wounded a Russian soldier in Kodori Gorge before the start of the Abkhaz operation, but the Russian TV later reported that an Abkhaz reservist was wounded.[347]\n\n13–31 August 2008\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 13 August 2008, Lenta.ru stated that the war was the first blog war for the Russians and thousands of the Russian netizens became volunteers of the information war. While the Russian bloggers had been suggesting that the photos of completely destroyed Tskhinvali and some of the thousands of Ossetian corpses mentioned by Russian officials would be an irrefutable proof of Russia's righteousness, such photos never materialized and the Russian bloggers began criticizing the Russian government for not learning how to wage the war with photos instead with tanks.[348]\n\nHost of Echo of Moscow Alexei Venediktov said that he had never done an alleged interview with Reuters photographer Gleb Garanich, where Garanich allegedly admitted to Venediktov that the photos of the bombing of Gori were fake. Venediktov said that the hoax interview was of \"poor\" quality and such attribution of hoaxes to the reputable agencies was a method of the information war waged over the internet.[349] Venediktov discussed the errors and lies in media reporting with several Russian journalists. Russian journalist Olga Bozhieva stated that while the number of the killed Russian peacekeepers were announced, no actual surnames were given, which was suspicious. Mikhail Romanov stated that when Boris Chochiev announced on 9 August that the 58th Army has never been in Tskhinvali, he saw several Russian TV journalists crying \"from the inconsistency of what has to be transmitted\" from Tskhinvali. Pyotr Fyodorov said that \"journalism during a military conflict cannot be classically pure\".[350]\n\nAndrey Illarionov wrote that the manipulation of the public opinion and the causation of mass hysteria were \"an undeniable achievement of the regime and pose an undeniable and unprecedented threat to Russian society.\"[351]\n\nYury Mukhin wrote that Russia was using long-established international propaganda cliché – fight against terrorism – in relation to Georgia and was copying American propaganda motif: armed defense of the people seeking self-determination. Mukhin stated that there was no aerial panorama photo of Tskhinvali because the Russian lie would exposed. Mukhin criticized the announcement by Sergei Shoigu on the beginning of the restoration of the communications in Tskhinvali as inconsistent with the claim that Tskhinvali was completely leveled.[352]\n\nPresident of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev declared during his meeting with President of Kyrgyzstan Kurmanbek Bakiyev by 14 August 2008: \"We received very conflicting information. The Western press passed over in silence the beginning of the conflict, when Georgian troops suddenly attacked Tskhinvali.\" However, Nazarbayev suggested that he did not completely trust the Russian media either: \"The Russian media assessed the situation as a humanitarian catastrophe and genocide of the Ossetian people. Perhaps the truth will come out later.\"[353]\n\nGarry Kasparov wrote on 14 August 2008: \"The American propaganda machine is far from omnipotent. [...] It's just that Saakashvili and his ministers look much better than their Russian colleagues in this propaganda war.\" Kasparov further wrote that for the Russian authorities, \"the real picture of the world is the picture that they see every day on the first and second channels of domestic television.\" Kasparov continued, \"But clumsy propaganda, designed for the brainwashed Russian layman, is absolutely ineffective in the presence of alternative sources of information.\"[354]\n\nAn editorial of Gazeta.Ru stated on 15 August that the \"operation to persuade the world\" failed and only the domestic audiences were influenced, since \"The level of deceit in the official Russian reports on the course of events was much higher than that to which the West is accustomed in such situations.\" The newspaper criticized false claims by the Russian government such as claims of black African snipers and Ukrainian mercenaries.[355]\n\nReporter of Novye Izvestia visited occupied Gori on 15 August 2008. Russian soldier stationed near Gori told the reporter that he was sick of the censorship in the Russian media and recalled how he had believed the untrue reports on the fascism in Estonia and Latvia. The soldier further noted that the Russian media was now directing the Russian public opinion against Georgia. Journalist reported that the locals of Gori were surprised that the Russian journalist was seeking to find out the truth.[356]\n\nOn 17 August 2008, Anton Stepanenko, reporter for Channel One Russia, admitted in an interview with Echo of Moscow that he arrived in Tskhinvali on 2 August 2008, days before the battle for Tskhinvali would begin.[357]\n\nAzerbaijani journalist Kyamal Ali noted that while the Russian propaganda was claiming that Georgia had completely destroyed 10 Ossetian villages, not a single photo had surfaced to prove this allegation.[358]\n\nRussian journalist Arkady Babchenko wrote for Novaya Gazeta newspaper on 18 August that he did not witness such damage in Tskhinvali that could have led to thousands of casualties among civilians. He estimated that the civilian casualties could be 150–200. Babchenko wrote that no mass executions of civilians or ethnic cleansing had taken place. Babchenko felt that the military command did not \"really need objective coverage of events\".[359] Human Rights Watch researcher Tanya Lokshina told Novaya Gazeta that there should have been 6,000 injured Ossetians if an allegation of 2,000 killed Ossetians was correct, but this was not the case. She stated: \"In this conflict we are dealing with inhuman quantity of misinformation. No one can really understand what has actually happened here.\"[360]\n\nOn 18 August 2008, Oleg Panfilov, director of the Center for Extreme Journalism, said that Russian forces were killing journalists because they did not need witnesses to their crimes. He further stated that work style of the Russian mass media resembled the Soviet style and the Western media won the information war because it was reporting the truth.[361]\n\nRussian journalist Nargiz Asadova wrote that one of the main reasons behind Russian loss of international information war was that the Russian authorities were accustomed to state control of the Russian media and forgot how to interact with the independent media, while Georgian president Saakashvili did the opposite and actively cooperated with the western media. Russia did not manage to propagandize Saakashvili's image as Saddam Hussein who was responsible for mass massacres.[362]\n\nLev Gudkov, director of the Levada Center, stated that on Russian TV \"is hardly any free reporting – instead you see a lot of very aggressive propaganda,\" which reminded him of the Soviet times.[363]\n\nA freelance photographer Said Tsarnayev came to Tskhinvali on 7 August 2008 and intended to take photos of the nature. 48 Russian journalists had already been present for several days at Tsarnayev's hotel and were waiting for \"something to happen\".[364] Two weeks before his arrival in Tskhinvali, Tsarnayev told his RIA Novosti editor that he would visit South Ossetia. The editor responded to wait a little longer because it was early for visit to South Ossetia.[365]\n\nRussian BBC noted that as soon as the world media began showing Tskhinvali, the Russian politicians began referring to Tskhinvali as \"Tskhinval\".[366]\n\nOn 27 August 2008, Artemy Troitsky criticized the statement of State Duma Committee chairman Alexey Ostrovsky that Russia would gain more respect by recognizing South Ossetia. Troitsky suggested that this was \"propaganda absolutely in the taste of Goebbels, per the principle: the larger lies, the more likely it is to be believed.\"[367]\n\nRest of 2008\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 1 September 2008, journalist Aleksandr Golts suggested that Vladimir Putin had accused the anchor of Fox News of attempting to interrupt 12-year-old girl during the interview because Putin himself was misled by the Russian state propaganda. Golts wrote: \"By crushing the press and creating a state machine of disinformation, Putin actually deprived himself of access to the truth.\"[368]\n\nThe Moscow Times praised September 1 tour of Tskhinvali for journalists organized by the Russian authorities and noted that the Russian authorities were learning communication. While initially the Russian leadership were not giving interviews, they later adopted the Georgian tactics.[369]\n\nIn early September 2008, some Russian media assumed that the head of the Press Service and Information Department of the Russian Ministry of Defense was fired on 8 September due to losing information war with Georgia. Moskovskij Komsomolets quoted an anonymous source stating that Russia had actually lost six warplanes in the first hours of the conflict and a total of 10 planes during the war, but the Russian authorities, waging the information war, only admitted to the loss of 4 aircraft. The officers of the information department were quoted as saying that no other General was more competent at being the spokesman during the war than Anatoly Nogovitsyn.[370]\n\nOn 15 September 2008, Kommersant newspaper compared the Georgian and Russian TV propaganda in the aftermath of the war and noted that the Georgian TV reports were centered on the local residents and events in the conflict zones, while the Russian TV focused on the interaction of high-level foreign and Russian officials.[371]\n\nOn 24 October, Utro.ru contradicted the official Russian version by reporting that more than 10 Russian warplanes were shot down in the war.[372]\n\nPavel Felgenhauer stated in December 2008 that the Russian officials were spreading the invented stories instead of facts. He noted that the Russian navy had claimed on 10 August to have repelled the Georgian attack and the Russian TV aired the animated movie depicting this battle, while apparently there never has been any naval battle.[373] The supposed battle was narrated by Arkady Mamontov.[374][375]\n\nSince 2009\n\n[edit]\n\nIn January 2009, Russian sociologist Boris Dubin studied the perceptions of Russian TV and internet audiences. The majority of TV audiences supported the government in the 2008 war and did not completely understand the essence of the conflict. Internet users had more diverse information and saw the war differently.[376]\n\nRussian Yabloko party published a booklet contradicting the official government's narrative on the war in Saint Petersburg in February 2009. Many printing houses had refused to publish the booklet out of fear of the consequences.[377]\n\nYulia Latynina reported in February 2009 that the Russian TV Vesti aired videos found on the dead Georgian soldiers as proof that Georgians had destroyed Tskhinvali, while videos actually showed that Tskhinvali was not destroyed by the Georgians.[378]\n\nIn March 2009, Russian president Medvedev awarded Russian journalist Vadim Rechkalov with the certificate of honor. Rechkalov told Estonian Postimees newspaper that the real aim of the war was to genocide the Georgians in South Ossetia.[379] Lenta.ru published an interview with Vadim Rechkalov. Rechkalov arrived in Tskhinvali during the war. He said that Russian BM-21 Grads shelled Tskhinvali. He also said that he found out on 13 August 2008 that rumors about \"total destruction\" of Tskhinvali were false.[380]\n\nIn June 2009, Yulia Latynina wrote: \"The August war began in an information vacuum. For several years, South Ossetian militias shelled Georgian villages, as Hamas did Israel, and the returning fire was declared \"a dastardly blow of the Georgian fascists.\"[381] Yulia Latynina said in July 2009 that Russia was waging the information war by using Der Spiegel.[382] Latynina observed on 8 August 2009 that very few buildings had been reconstructed in Tskhinvali, among them the \"Ministry of Truth\", TV and Radio stations. Latynina noted that while the Russian foreign ministry had attempted to blame the attack on the Polish president's car near South Ossetian border on Georgia, the South Ossetian \"ministry of truth\" (information ministry) obstructed this attempt by confirming that the South Ossetian forces had opened fire. Latynina criticized Bastrykin's claim that Georgia had plans to poison water in Tskhinvali and pointed out that Georgians soldiers would have to drink the same water in Tskhinvali and the bordering Georgian villages were supplied with water from Tskhinvali. Latynina noted that Georgia's statements during the past year were consistent and never changed, while the South Ossetian statements were inconsistent.[383]\n\nIn July 2009, historian Boris Vadimovich Sokolov noted that only non-Russian journalist, allowed to enter Tskhinvali before the start of the invasion of Georgia and report during the war, was Ukrainian journalist of Inter TV channel connected with Viktor Yanukovich.[384]\n\nIn August 2009, Andrey Illarionov discussed the falsification of the facts related to the Russo-Georgian war with the host of Echo of Moscow, such as fabricated Georgian military Order No.2. Illarionov also recalled the false claim made by Vladimir Putin in an interview with the CNN on 28 August 2008 that united Ossetia had joined Russia in the 18th century and pointed out that Ossetia as a political state did not exist back then, but there were Ossetian communes of Kabardia. Illarionov also criticized Putin's claim that Georgia had voluntarily joined Russia in 1801. Illarionov also criticized Putin's claim that South Ossetia was given to the Tiflis Governorate in the mid-19th century because separate South Ossetia did not exist back then. Illarionov stated that some politicians needed \"mythological representation of the past\" for using history as information weapon because the public opinion always takes the side of the conflict where historical justice seemingly lays.[385]\n\nIn September 2009, an independent documentary \"Russian Lessons\" was premiered.[386][387] Russian film makers Andrei Nekrasov and Olga Konskaya disputed the narrative of the Russian government (supported at the time by the most Western media) and examined wartime propaganda.[388] Andrei Nekrasov wrote in August 2011 that during his work on the film Russian Lessons, he could not obtain any real information about any female Ossetian victim of the war.[389]\n\nIn 2011, Oleg Panfilov, Russian journalist from Tajikistan, published a book dissecting Russia's information war against Georgia since the beginning of the 19th century.[390] One of the chapters discussed how the supporters of Aleksandr Dugin participated in the information war in July–August 2008.[391]\n\nIn 2013, Russian blogger Sergey Ledokolov wrote an article inspecting and debunking the Russian propaganda points. Ledokolov wrote that the war began not on 8 August 2008, but on 1 August 2008. Ledokolov said that the Russian propaganda claim that Saakashvili launched an unprovoked attack on Tskhinvali after he had announced the ceasefire several hours earlier was unconvincing. Ledokolov criticized the Russian propaganda claim that Georgia did not have the right to use BM-21 Grads against Tskhinvali. Ledokolov noted that in an interview with CNN, Putin had omitted the fact that the first killed peacekeepers were Georgians.[392]\n\nRussian military journalist Arkady Babchenko believed in August 2008 that the war was started by Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili. He said in August 2017 that he believed TV back in August 2008. When he visited Tskhinvali during the war, it became clear that there were no 2,000 killed people as Russian propaganda was claiming. He said that later he began to analyse the war and visited South Ossetia several times until his reports were read in South Ossetia. During his last visit to South Ossetia, Babchenko said, he was threatened with assault rifle and told: \"It's better not to arrive here again.\" During his research, he began to realise that the conflict was not what it seemed and things were really quite different from how they were presented. Babchenko said that after some time he concluded that the Georgian war had the same nature as ongoing conflict in Ukraine. According to Babchenko, it was Russia's aggression, \"imperial war of conquest\", and Russia prepared the war in advance and was provoking Georgia by all means. Babchenko said that Russia's actions during the war implied that partial or full occupation of Georgia had been planned. Babchenko said that although Georgia had decided to use force against Russian-backed \"bandit republics\", Georgia had the right to do so because Georgian troops were on the Georgian soil.[393]\n\nGeorgian and Ukrainian reaction\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 6 August 2008, Georgian Reintegration Minister Temur Iakobashvili stated that the Russian TV channels were waging anti-Georgian propaganda war in support of South Ossetian separatists and were using the methods of Joseph Goebbels.[394]\n\nThe Georgian government halted the broadcasting of Russian television channels in Georgia and blocked access to Russian websites, during the war and its aftermath, limiting news coverage in Georgia.[395] Russian disinformation was cited as reason.[396][397] The idea of blocking access to Russian websites belonged to Georgian reintegration minister Temur Iakobashvili.[398] Films depicting heroism were broadcast by Georgian TV channels during the war.[399]\n\nUkrainian media was divided in their relation with the war in Georgia, with some agencies supporting Georgia. Russian-language editions either were neutral or were defending the Russian actions, but were not overtly critical of Georgia.[400]\n\nOn 9 August 2008, Georgian ambassador to Azerbaijan rejected Russian media reports of Saakashvili having a pre-Infarction condition and plans to leave Georgia for Turkey as disinformation.[401] Deputy Interior Minister of Georgia Eka Zguladze said that majority of the Russian media reports were disinformation.[402]\n\nThe Georgian consulate in Odesa urged the residents of Odesa not to believe the Russian disinformation.[403]\n\nReuters reported on 10 August 2008 that both Russia and Georgia hired PR experts in Brussels.
