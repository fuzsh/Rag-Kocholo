All rights reserved.\n\nIntroduction\n\nOver fifteen years ago I wrote Russian Poet/Soviet Jew: The Legacy of Eduard Bagritsky. Published in 2000, it explored the political and cultural anxieties of a major Jewish-Russian poet living and working in the Soviet 1920s and early 1930s. Eduard Bagritsky and the protagonist of the present book, Ilya Selvinsky, were close in Moscow in the middle to late 1920s. Both were Jews originally from the coast of the Black Sea; both were members of the Literary Center of Constructivists, over which Selvinsky presided until its dismantlement in 1930; and both were talented poets famous on the early Soviet literary scene. It was Bagritsky who, in a poem of 1927, laid Selvinsky, along with Nikolai Tikhonov and Boris Pasternak, on the altar of the 1920s Soviet modernism: “To the alien West/ rushing over [fields of] harvested crops/ Tikhonov, Selvinsky, Pasternak….” The career of Ilya Selvinsky (1899-1968) is emblematic of the experience of Jewish-Russian poets during World War II and the Shoah (Holocaust).i Selvinsky spent roughly the first two and a half years (summer 1941-autumn 1943) and the last month of the war (AprilMay 1945) at the frontlines. Serving as a staff writer and editor of army newspapers and also participating in combat, Selvinsky contributed only about twenty prose items during the wartime years. Poetry, not journalism or essayism, was Selvinsky’s principal medium of writing and publishing about the events he witnessed and participated in. His poetic contributions to army newspapers ranged from lyrical, patriotic, or political poetry to rhymed captions to anti-Nazi cartoons.ii He composed longer and shorter poems with references to the Shoah, several of them explicit in their articulation of Jewish losses.iii Selvinsky was able to steer his Shoah poems into print during and immediately after the Great Patriotic War (as the war against Nazi Germany and its allies became known in the Soviet Union), although he made compromises, some of them negotiating the official Soviet — xv —\n\nI Saw It : Ilya Selvinsky and the Legacy of Bearing Witness to the Shoah, Academic Studies Press, 2013. ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\n———————————————————— Introduction ————————————————————\n\nviews of Jewish victimhood.iv During the war, he experienced political repression, paying a high price for his poems about the war and Shoah. This book explores the dynamics of Selvinsky’s wartime career by placing it first in the historical contexts of World War II and the Shoah, and subsequently in the cultural and ideological contexts of postwar Stalinism. The book’s final section investigates Selvinsky’s legacy as a poet-soldier and a witness to the Shoah in the occupied Soviet territories.\n\n***\n\nCopyright © 2013. Academic Studies Press. All rights reserved.\n\nAs I wrote and revised this book, and especially after I came upon tiers of new evidence during a research trip to Crimea, I had to remind myself that I was not writing a poet’s biography. I wanted to tell the story of Soviet poetry of the Shoah through the prism of one poet’s life and work. I did not set out to create a history of Shoah literature in the USSR, nor had I initially intended to write either a history of the Shoah in Selvinsky’s native Crimea or a study of the cultural legacy of the Shoah in the Soviet Union. These topics, absorbing as they are and understudied as they still remain, left a lot still to be discovered and investigated. Such are, to a degree, the pains of interdisciplinary study, and these challenges are rendered more complex when the subject “Soviet Union” is coupled with the heading “Jews” and placed in the time frame of World War II and the Shoah.\n\n*** Since my Moscow youth, both Eduard Bagritsky and Ilya Selvinsky have been among my favorite poets. My views of Bagritsky’s poetry and Jewishness have evolved over the years, and I hope to revisit them before long. Having completed a book about Ilya Selvinsky as a principal JewishRussian poetic voice of the Soviet 1940s, I now realize that this volume is in a number of ways a sequel to my earlier book about Bagrtisky and — xvi —\n\nI Saw It : Ilya Selvinsky and the Legacy of Bearing Witness to the Shoah, Academic Studies Press, 2013.

Anglicized, reader-friendly spellings of Russian names are used in the main text; if a name has already gained a common spelling in English, this spelling is then used (e.g. Ehrenburg, not Erenburg; Novy Mir, not Novyi mir). In rendering the Russian-language bibliographical references, a slightly simplified version of the US Library of Congress transliteration system is used. Unless indicated otherwise, all translations from the Russian are mine. As a general principle, literary translations of verse are printed as verse, whereas literal translations of verse are printed as prose with indications of the line boundaries. In some cases, preference is given to literary, not literal, English translations of poetic texts. Even though the literary translations I quote are metrically precise and relatively close to the Russian originals, one cannot rely on the English texts alone to draw accurate conclusions about the poem’s structure, meaning, and significance. Unless noted otherwise, I reference only the publications I have examined de visu, the latter circumstance being particularly significant in the case of original wartime publications in regional or army newspapers, some of which are extremely difficult to locate even in Russian and Ukrainian libraries or even in Crimean libraries and archives. ii.

Selvinsky’s wartime poems with explicit Shoah and Jewish references include: “Evreiskomu narodu” (“To the Jewish People,” 1941); “Ia eto videl!” (“I Saw It!” 1942); “Kerch’” (1942; pub. 1945); “Otvet Gebbel’su” (“A Reply to Goebbels,” 1942); “Sud v Krasnodare” (“A Trial in Krasnodar,” 1943; pub. 1945); “Krym” (“Kak boi barabana, kak golos kartechi…,” [“Like drumbeat, like the voice of canister shots…”] 1944, pub. 1945); “Krym” (“Byvaiut kraia, chto nedvizhny vekami…”) (“Crimea” [“There are regions unchanged by centuries…”], 1945; pub. 1962); Kandava (1945); “Sevastopol’” (Sebastopol,” 1944; pub. 1945). iv.

Sel’vinskogo (Simferopol’: Krymskaia Akademiia gumanitarnykh nauk; Dommuzei I. L. Sel’vinskogo, 1994). Babenko published—and commented on— extensive excerpts from Selvinsky’s wartime diaries and letters. However, her valuable publication contains a number of errors, including those in the dating of diary excerpts. Babenko’s book also includes Eduard Filat’ev’s article “Taina podpolkovnika Sel’vinskogo,” Babenko, 69-82. Filat’ev’s article does not contain a scholarly apparatus or use footnotes, and the sources of his information stand in need of further verification.

Maurice Friedberg might have been the first Western scholar to mention Selvinsky’s World War II “moving poems dealing with the tragic fate of Russian Jewry”; see Friedberg, “Selvinskii, Ilya Lvovich,” in Encyclopedia Judaica, 14: 1137 (Jerusalem: Keter Publishing House, 1972). Benjamin Pinkus included Selvinsky in a short list of Jewish-Russian poets who wrote about the Shoah; see Pinkus, The Soviet Government and the Jews 1948-1967: A Documentary Study, 389 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984). Some of Selvinsky’s poems about the Shoah have been identified in an entry in the Russian-language Jewish encyclopedia published in Israel; see “Sel’vinskii, Il’ia L’vovich,” in Kratkaia evreiskaia entsiklopediia, vol. 7: 742-743 (Jerusalem: Obshchestvo po issledovaniiu evreiskikh obshchin; Evreiskii universitet v Ierusalime, 1994) [unsigned; entry by Mark Kipnis] and also in an entry in the recent Russian encyclopedia of the Shoah, M[aria] M.

In his recent book, “I am to be read not from left to right but in Jewish: from right to left”: The Poetics of Boris Slutsky (Boston: Academic Studies Press, 2011), Marat Grinberg comments on Selvinsky’s experience as a Shoah poet. I read Harriet Murav’s book, Music from a Speeding Train: Jewish Literature in PostRevolutionary Russia (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2011), in November 2011 as I revised this manuscript for publication. I noted Murav’s readings of three of Selvinsky’s Shoah poems, “I Saw It!,” “Tribunal in Krasnodar,” and Kandava (Murav, 134; 154-165). I further noted the absence of references to “Kerch,” Selvinsky’s second principal poem about the Bagerovo anti-tank ditch massacre. Finally, I noted that Murav does not discuss Selvinsky’s wartime troubles and punitive dismissal from the army.

Selvinsky before the War: Poetics and Politics Before turning our attention to the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, let us briefly consider aspects of Selvinsky’s prewar career while taking stock of the treatment of Jewish and Judaic questions, of Selvinsky’s place on the prewar Soviet literary pantheon, and of official repressions against the poet. A poetic virtuoso and an innovator of Russian versification, Selvinsky was born in 1899 in Crimean capital Simferopol, the grandson of a Krymchak. (Krymchaks are Crimea’s indigenous, rabbinate non-Ashkenazi Jews, who speak a Turkic language.) Selvinsky grew up in Simferopol and in Evpatoria in the family of an entrepreneurial tailor who later became a furrier. As an adult, Selvinsky indicated that Russian was his native language, remembered some Hebrew, and retained some knowledge of spoken Yiddish (and also the Krymchak language).1 Whenever possible, Selvinsky listed “Krymchak” as his nationality in his Soviet documents. At the same time, Selvinsky clearly regarded the Krymchaks as a subgroup of the broader category of the Jewish people, and spoke of both the Jewish and the Russian people as “my own.” As a young boy, Selvinsky was given instruction in the Torah and into his early teen years attended services with his father at both Ashkenazi and Krymchak prayer homes and synagogues.2 In 1905, in response to the wave of pogroms then sweeping over parts of the Russian Empire, Selvinsky’s father sent him, his mother, and his younger sister 1 On Selvinsky’s command of Yiddish, Tatyana Selvinskaya, Personal Interview, Simferopol, 15 December 2011. 2 Vera Katina and Marina Novikova recently investigated Jewish aspects of Selvinsky’s childhood and early youth. See Katina, “Kazhdyi chelovek imeet pravo….”; Novikova, “Zagadki biografii Il’ia Sel’vinskogo.” —1—\n\nI Saw It : Ilya Selvinsky and the Legacy of Bearing Witness to the Shoah, Academic Studies Press, 2013.

As a young man Selvinsky had his share of adventures, ranging from wrestling in the circus and working as a sailor, a longshoreman, and an itinerant actor to participating in the Civil War (first, briefly, in an anarchist troop, later in the the Red Army). He published his first poem in 1915, and in the 1920s experimented with the use of Yiddishisms and thieves’ lingo in Russian verse.3 In 1923, Selvinsky graduated in law from Moscow University. Selvinsky was the leader of the Literary Center of Constructivists (LTsK), an early Soviet modernist group, from 1924 until its derailment in 1930, and edited landmark anthologies by constructivist authors.\n\n1.

The poet Aleksandr Revich recently suggested that “The Lay of Ulyalaev, alongside And Quiet Flows the Don [by Mikhail Sholokhov], is probably the best literary work about the Civil War, having most shockingly portrayed its horror.”4 The Lay of Ulyalaev and especially Fur Trade remain unsurpassed masterpieces of Russian epic and narrative poetry. Soviet leaders who took a keen interest in the new letters, among them Lev Trotsky and Nikolai Bukharin, expressed admiration for Selvinsky’s poetry. Lazar Fleishman, in whose study of Boris Pasternak in the 1930s Selvinsky makes numerous appearances, highlights a characteristic episode. At an event hosted by Lev Trotsky in 1926, which brought together editors of leading Moscow “thick” journals Aleksandr Voronsky (Krasnaia nov’ [Red Virgin Soil]) and Vyacheslav Polonsky (Novy Mir [New World]) and the poets Boris Pasternak, Semyon Kirsanov, and Ilya Selvinsky, Trotsky singled out Selvinsky and asked him to recite a section of The Lay of Ulyalaev for the second time.5 Vyacheslav Polonsky (1886-1932), one of the dominant literary critics of the 1920s, lauded Selvinsky’s contribution: The Lay of Ulyalaev, long poems and a whole range of shorter works speak of Selvinsky as a rising star of Russian poetry. […] At that Selvinsky is from head to toe a creation of our epoch. He grew up in the Revolution. Revolutionary is not only the material he uses; revolutionary is his very approach to literary mastery. The least traditional of the contemporary poets, one who disregards all of the existing or past canons, [a poet] heavyish and difficult, in the development of Russian poetry Selvinsky represents a step forward from the marvelous intimate art of Pasternak and from Mayakovsky’s achievements. […] Selvinsky is one of the poets who not only has a past, but also has a future.6\n\n4 5 6\n\nAleksandr Revich, “Sedoe s detstva pokoleni’e,” in Il’ia Sel’vinskii.

The wreath of sonnets Bar Kokhba (1920, pub. 1924) occupies a special place among Selvinsky’s works. While perhaps influenced by both the Yiddish drama Bar Kokhba (1887) by Abraham Goldfaden and by Vladimir (Ze’ev) Jabotinsky’s Russian-language poem “In Memory of Herzl” (1904), Selvinsky’s Bar Kokhba has no equivalents in early Soviet writing. Against the backdrop of a growing campaign against traditional Jewish life and Judaism in the Soviet Union, the work became a powerful monument to Jewish—and Judaic—survival. Selvinsky’s other major Jewish works of the pre-World War II years included “Mot’ka Malkhamoves” (“Motke the Angel of Death,” 1926; from the Hebrew and Yiddish “Malech-hamovess”), “Anecdotes about the Karaite Philosopher Babakai-Sudduk” (1931), The Lay of Ulyalaev, and Fur Trade. Selvinsky’s poem “Portrait of My Mother” (1933) contained a bitter comment about Jewish assimilation in the USSR: “Henceforth her son’s face will remain defiled/Like the Judaic Jerusalem,/Having suddenly become a Christian holy site.” In 1930, trying to redeem himself after the onslaught against the independent literary groups of the 1920s, Selvinsky composed the opportunistic poem “From Palestine to Birobidzhan”(1930, pub. 1933). In 1939 Selvinsky created the play The Tushino Camp, known in manuscript as A Version of False Dmitri II and set in the 1600s, during Russia’s “Time of Troubles.” In the introduction, Selvinsky turned to Shakespeare in order to explain his motivation in giving literary credence to theories of the Jewish origin of the impostor-tsar False Dmitri II (who came to be known as tushinskii vor—the Tushino thief). “Shylock is an entirely different matter,” Selvinsky argued. “The depth of this image is not only in his being a father fighting to avenge his daughter’s seduction, but also in his being a Jew, avenging his national oppression. Here one could not change any significant shadings. Othello’s national particularity is a color; Shylock’s national particularity is an idea.”7 Not surprisingly, The Tushino Thief was officially dismissed as lacking “un-\n\n7\n\nIl’ia Sel’vinskii, Tushinskii lager’, Zerkalo 15-16 (2000), http://magazines.russ.ru/zerkalo/ 2000/15/14selv.html, last accessed 20 February 2012. —4—\n\nI Saw It : Ilya Selvinsky and the Legacy of Bearing Witness to the Shoah, Academic Studies Press, 2013.

One of the play’s principal subtexts is S. An-sky’s The Dibbuk (1911-1919), which in and of itself is a remarkable fact for a Soviet play written in 1930 for the stage. In a short appreciation of Selvinsky that appeared as a preface to The Tushino Camp, the RussianIsraeli critic Aleksandr Goldshtein noted: [… A]bove all, let us stress that obvious eye-catching [feature]: the high class of the writing. Classics write this way (and those avant-gardists who have become classics). And one more, equally important point: if Ilya Lvovich’s attempts to perceive the epochal tempo-rhythm tended, as a rule, to be successful, he only succeeded every other time to embrace the ideological tenets mandatory for all. An enthusiastic appeal to rebellious values and a Jewish-Messianic substratum of a foreigners’ invasion was in 1939, at the time of the forming of a new, postrevolutionary, national-state mythology, absolutely out of place.9\n\nCopyright © 2013. Academic Studies Press. All rights reserved.\n\nThroughout his literary career, Selvinsky had his share of official chastisement and ostracism, denunciations and near-misses.10 In the words of Arlen Blium, starting with the mid-1920s, “Selvinsky constantly remained on the radar screen of the organs of censorship.”11 On 20 May 1945, as Selvinsky looked back at his rollercoaster prewar literary career 8\n\nSee Selvinsky, Wartime Diaries, 27 April 1942; cf.

Throughout this book, whenever possible, I will cross-reference Selvinsky’s published diaries and letters with their manuscripts.

All newspapers picked up this scream and turned it into a call for action. Then I wrote a letter to Komsomolskaya Pravda [Komsomol’skaia Pravda] —“A Reply to Comrade Kerzhentsev”—in which I strenuously objected to his thesis. […] Naturally Komsomolskaya Pravda did not print the letter but forwarded it to Kerzhentsev.”12\n\nCopyright © 2013. Academic Studies Press. All rights reserved.\n\nWhat followed, according to Selvinsky’s diary, was an invitation to become Chairman of the Union of Writers. After Selvinsky repeatedly turned down Kerzhentsev’s invitation, this exchange took place: —Why are you refusing? [Kerzhentsev asked]—Odd question. You have just done everything to undermine my reputation as a writer in the eyes of the society, and now this “thrashed” wise man is to become Chairman of the Union!—We shall restore your reputation, Kerzhentsev said, unperturbed.—And Fur Trade?—We shall find a formula for it, too. I did not expect such cynicism and was literally stunned. I said many insolent things to K. and then left.13 In his public conduct and in his writings, Selvinsky remained a proud poet—and a proud Jew—despite rounds of direct official ostracism. Due to his personal bravery, chutzpah, and competitive nature, and also his hubristic ambition to be a tribune and voice of the people, Selvinsky periodically attempted to articulate in poetry what he thought might 12 Selvinsky, Wartime Diaries, 20 May 1945. 13 Selvinsky, Wartime Diaries, 20 May 1945. —6—\n\nI Saw It : Ilya Selvinsky and the Legacy of Bearing Witness to the Shoah, Academic Studies Press, 2013.

Selvinsky’s ideological bets with history, some of which in retrospect appear both naïve and miscalculated, did not serve him well with Stalin and his henchmen. Throughout the 1930s, Selvinsky’s official status proved to be precarious while he continued to enjoy great literary acclaim. The (founding) First Congress of the Union of Soviet Writers, which convened in August-September 1934 in Moscow, offers ample evidence of Selvinsky’s position. In the proceedings of the congress, Selvinsky’s name was the fourth-most-frequently evoked of all the living Soviet poets, trailing Boris Pasternak’s and Nikolai Tikhonov’s, and closely competing with Nikolay Aseev’s. At the congress Nikolai Bukharin, one of the leading Bolsheviks and editor-in-chief of the daily Izvestia, delivered a long speech about poetry. At the time Bukharin, whose career had entered a downward spiral in 1928-1929 and would eventually end with his purging in 1938, still wielded much influence, not least in the realm of literary politics. To “Tikhonov, Selvinsky, Pasternak,” the three poets fatefully conjoined in a poetic line by Eduard Bagritsky, Bukharin added Nikolay Aseev, labeling Pasternak, Selvinsky, Tikhonov, and Aseev as the four living Soviet poets of “the very highest caliber” who influenced the poetic scene in “the most decisive fashion.” Bukharin praised Pasternak’s originality and mastery most highly, yet favored Selvinsky’s longer and shorter poetry with an almost equal enthusiasm: “I. Selvinsky is to a certain measure B. Pasternak’s antipode. He is a poet with a big poetic voice, seeking to burst out to the expanses of wide roads, mass scenes, where one hears screaming, where horses stomp their hooves, where a dashing song is pouring out, where enemies fight, where a living life is boiling and where history kneads its tough dough.” Bukharin also chided Selvinsky, if gently, for sometimes “failing his own directive” and substituting “rhymed factory wall newspaper” for “attempts […] at vast canvasses.” Bukharin closed the Selvinsky section of his speech by calling him “an undoubtedly revolutionary, very big, real—and at that cultured—master of verse.”14 A number of Soviet poets, most memorably Selvinsky’s coeval Aleksey Surkov, took umbrage at Bukharin’s position and at his being partial to Pasternak and Selvinsky and short-shrifting (rightfully, one might add) 14 See Bukharin’s speech in I. K. Luppol et al., eds., Pervyi vsesoiuznyi s’’ezd sovetskikh pisatelei. 1934. Stenograficheskii otchet, 479-503 (Moscow: Gosudarstvennoe izdatel’stvo “Khudozhestvennaia literatura”, 1934; Rpt.

Take any thought, express it in normal human speech, and everybody understands. Yet the poet speaks in an abnormal, rhythmical language. […] But the trouble is that the critics do not promote our wealth among the masses [Selvinsky uses this expression to refer to the achievements of Soviet poetry].”17 From the late 1920s and throughout the rest of his life, its middle part intersecting with the years of Stalin’s rule, Selvinsky advanced an artistic platform that could be described by three ideological-aesthetic principles. He argued, through thick and thin, that artistic form must be experimental, and that Soviet art must possess a complex structure and texture. He emphasized that the narodnost’ (here understood as an artistic sense of nationhood or peoplehood) of Soviet literature cannot be restricted to the interests and aspirations of workers and peasants and must give voice and form to the intelligentsia. Finally Selvinsky warned, sometimes through his criticism of other authors, that Russian cultural chauvinism threatens not only the ideology of Soviet national unity but also the development of Soviet art.18 As a young poet Selvinsky was so impressed with Das Kapital that he added the name Karl to his first name and for a long period of time signed his works “Eli-Karl Selvinsky,” a form binding together his wor15\n\nSee Surkov’s speech in Luppol et al., Pervyi vsesoiuznyi s’’ezd sovetskikh pisatelei. 1934, 512-514; see also Aleksandr Eshanov, “V preddverii zamysla,” Alef 991 (2009), http://www.alefmagazine.com/ pub1917.html, last accessed 29 January 2012; Valentin Domil’, “Zvezdy i ternii Il’i Sel’vinskogo.

As late as in his 1940s identification papers, Selvinsky’s full name still appears as “Ilya-Karl Lvovich Selvinsky.” A blazing modernist and a classicist, an intellectual and an artist, a Marxist by heart’s conviction, a Jew, a Russian, and a Soviet, like an icebreaker Selvinsky pressed for a navigational path of his own. He tried to take cues from the regime, yet insisted on his inalienable right to an aesthetic of his own, and also on featuring members of the intelligentsia, and not workers and peasants, as his chosen heroes. Characteristic is the story of the creation of Selvinsky’s epic work based on his participation, as a special correspondent for Pravda, in the SS Chelyuskin Arctic expedition of 1933-1934.\n\n2.

Selvinsky and a small group of comrades had left the expedition earlier upon the order of the leader, the Polar explorer Otto Shmidt. Shmidt later came to Selvinsky’s defense when unfounded public charges and rumors of cowardice were leveled against the poet.20 Still, Selvinsky’s aborted participation in the expedition became something of a pretext for an orchestrated critical campaign against him and his writings. This campaign reached a peak at the February 1937 Pushkin Plenary Meeting of the Governing Body of the Union of Soviet Writers. The Pushkin Plenary Meeting, as Fleishman has shown, became the forum for the dismantling of what one might call the Bukharin line in Soviet literature, and Pasternak and Selvinsky were the principal targets.21 In his response, quoted in the Soviet press as an example of his allegedly disingeneous attempts to portray himself as a “victim” of ostracism (which he was), Selvinsky said: “It is bitter for me to realize that I, a thirty-seven-year-old adult, a healthy, physically strong, absolutely Soviet man, have no creative perspectives whatsoever. I know in advance that whatever I would write, there would always be people who would pull four lines from me and cover with spit whatever I do.” 22 In fact, Selvinsky had been having a hard time publishing his Arctic epic. In 1936 he placed short excerpts in newspapers, and part one appeared in the January 1937 issue of Novy Mir. Then the publication was stalled for a year. There were several factors behind Selvinsky’s difficulties. It did not go unnoticed that Selvinsky’s epic refused to concoct a proletarian or peasant hero. As Susanne Frank recently argued, “Selvinsky’s long poem turns Otto Iulievich Shmidt into a prototype of a Soviet hero, Stalin’s envoy, juxtaposed to the Norvegian conqueror of the South and North poles Amundsen. […] The epic’s other heroic figure is the radio operator [Ernst] Krenkel […].”23 Neither Shmidt nor Krenkel is an ethnic Russian, and both have foreign, Germanic names. However, it appears that the main reason for the publishing difficulties stemmed 20 O[tto] Iu. Shmidt, “Pisateli na ‘Cheliuskine’,” Literaturnaia gazeta 28 June 1934. 21 See Fleishman, Boris Pasternak, 196-199. 22 “Na pushkinskom plenume pravleniia Soiuza sovetskikh pisatelei,” Izvestiia 27 February 1937, quoted in Fleishman, Boris Pasternak, 399. 23 Siuzanna Frank [Susanne Frank], “Teplaia Arktika: k istorii odnogo starogo literaturnogo motiva,” tr.

ProQuest Ebook Central,\n\n——————————————— Selvinsky on the Shoah by Bullet ———————————————\n\nfrom the sections of the epic devoted to Stalin, and to Selvinsky’s approach to praising the Soviet leader. Although different in verse texture and voice, this approach may be likened to the one Boris Pasternak attempted in his four-part cycle “The Artist” published in Izvestia on 1 January 1936. There Stalin, although unnamed, appeared as an “artist” of history. The quality of Pasternak’s and Selvinsky’s verse, the loftiness of Pasternak’s allegory in the Stalin cycle, and the might of Selvinsky’s epic voice in the Stalin pages of Chelyuskiniana had the potential to lend more aesthetic validity to the tyrant than hundreds of cultist hymns, and yet neither work had struck its goal.24 This brings us to the 28 December 1937 report on Selvinsky’s Chelyuskiniana sent to three Soviet leaders by Lev Mekhlis,25 then a member of Stalin’s inner circle. The note was addressed to the Soviet Premier and Politburo member Vyasheslav Molotov, to Lazar Kaganovich, Politburo member and one of Stalin’s closest party generals, and to Andrei Zhdanov, Secretary of the Central Committee and Leningrad party boss after the murder of Sergey Kirov in 1934. Selvinsky had complained to Molotov about the difficulties he experienced with his epic work, and Mekhlis was responding to Molotov’s consequent inquiry. In 1930-1937 Mekhlis had been editor of Pravda, and was afterward appointed Deputy People’s Commissar of Defense and Chief of the Army’s Political Directorate (PUR). Mekhlis’s note is a fascinating document which shows the extent to which Selvinsky was known and knowable to the top echelon of the Stalinist leadership:26\n\nCopyright © 2013.

[…] A chapter in the long poem Chelyuskiniana is devoted to a literary portrait of comrade Stalin. Previously Selvinsky negotiated [the publication of this long poem]. At the time Pravda did not agree to print the [submitted] version of the long poem. That which Selvinsky is now passing for a long poem about comrade Stalin differs radically from the original text. The author has either deleted or modified the most atrocious, illiterate places. […] It would be difficult for me to quote in a letter everything that Selvinsky has corrected, as this would take up a huge amount of space. I shall quote only the most characteristic [excerpts]. […] The part, concerning a description of how comrade Stalin walked through a [military] formation, has been radically redone by the author. I would not say that it is entirely satisfactory. […] Selvinsky is a formalist [a very negative Soviet term referring to active formal quest in literature and the arts—MDS], he writes in a language completely unintelligible to the masses. […] Even in the latest version of the long poem about Stalin, substantially corrected, he all the time dubs Stalin “Soso” [Georgian diminutive of Stalin’s first name—MDS]. […] Of Stalin’s appearance at the first congress of collective farms [First All-Union Congress of Collective Farm Shock Brigadiers, 1933] he writes this way: “There sits a man with the face of a portrait.” Thereafter he continues: “Touched with drumbeat, a rough-hewn face.” […] There are good instances in the long poem, but on the whole it is written in such a language that it is difficult to read it. The mass reading public will not understand many places; some are marked by ambiguity. I suppose that Selvinsky needs to work on the long poem some more, mainly in the direction of turning it into a work accessible to the mass reading public.”27 27\n\nL[ev] Mekhlis, “[Zapiska] Molotovu, Kaganovichu, Zhdanovu o poeme Sel’vinskogo ‘Cheliuskiniana.’ 28 December 1937,” Fond Aleksandra N.

All rights reserved.\n\nDid Mekhlis recognize a connection between Selvinsky’s refusal to portray Stalin in a simplistically cultist fashion and the centrality of verbal technique in Selvinsky’s poetry? Several days later Molotov wrote a short (and slightly ungrammatical) resolution on Mekhlis’s report: “To comrades Kaganovich and Zhdanov: In the least this much needs to be done without allowing into print the ‘long poem’ and without a new scrutiny of it.”28 Excerpts from part two and part three of Chelyskiniana appeared in the leading monthlies Novy Mir and October (Oktiabr’) in 1938, but Selvinsky was unable to publish a complete text of the revised and re-revised text of his “epic poem about Stalin.”29 In 1957 a further reworked version, titled Arctic: A Novel, was published in Thaw-era Moscow, stripped of its Stalinist sections. The revisions of Arctic were part of Selvinsky’s larger postwar project of revamping his epic poems, whereby a lot of the intricacy, poignancy, and originality was purged from his texts.30 In the 1930s Selvinsky was twice targeted by separate party resolutions. On 21 April 1937, the Politburo issued the resolution “Concerning Selvinsky’s play Umka the Polar Bear.” Stick and carrot, carrot and stick were applied to some of the leading Soviet writers in the 1930s, and Selvinsky was among them. In 1938 he was decorated with the Order of the Red Banner of Labor. On 4 August 1939, on the eve of World War II, Selvinsky was chastised in the resolution of the Orgburo of the Central Committee titled “On the Magazine October and Poems by I. L. Selvinsky,” and his poems were deemed “anti-artistic and harmful.”31 Despite the official denunciations, in 1938-41 Selvinsky was professor at the Literary Institute in Moscow and poetry editor at October, and a principal mentor to the younger generation of Soviet poets, the 28\n\nMekhlis, “[Zapiska] Molotovu, Kaganovichu, Zhdanovu o poeme Sel’vinskogo ‘Cheliuskiniana.’ 28 December 1937.” 29 See “Selvinskii, Il’ia L’vovich,” in Bibliograficheskii ukazatel’, 39; Frank. 30 Selvinskii, Arktika.

The Nazi Invasion and the Frontlines In the 1930s, the reaction of Jewish-Russian poets to Nazism was muted at best and virtually absent at worst. In the USSR, poets were not having an easy time confronting the growing misfortunes of European Jewry or placing antifascist verses with specific Jewish references in Soviet publications. In 1936 Ilya Selvinsky traveled to Berlin and composed—perhaps concocted says it better—poems of political protest, including two short satires of Nazi Germany’s anti-Jewish climate: “Antisemites” and “The Jewish Question.” In “The Jewish Question,” a brown-clad doorman first proclaims that no songs by “the Jew Heine” would be performed in a Berlin café, then mutters a song with Heine’s lyrics—as though unaware of the irony of his performance. Selvinsky’s poems based on his impressions from this visit to Berlin would remain unpublished until 1956.34 The outbreak of World War II and the Soviet annexation of Eastern Poland, North Bukovina, and the Baltic areas with their still-unSovietized Jewish populations did not elicit a response from Selvinsky. Had he and the vast majority of the Jewish-Russian poets in the USSR—Ilya Ehrenburg and the young Boris Slutsky excepting—not been aching to write about the looming tragedy west of the Soviet borders? This question is not easy to answer without a degree of speculation. We can definitely observe that in the atmosphere of the first weeks and months of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, which were quite disastrous for 34 See Il’ia Sel’vinskii, “Antisemity”; “Evreiskii vopros,” in Izbrannye proizvedeniia, 2 vols., 1: 155; 156 (Moscow: Goslitidat, 1956); cf. Il’ia Sel’vinskii, O vremeni, o sud’bakh, o liubvi, 69-70 (Moscow: Sovetskii pisatel’, 1962). In a letter dated 9 June 1936 and sent from Paris to Nikolai Bukharin in Moscow, Ehrenburg reacted to the official displeasure with Selvinsky’s work: “Why would one first send Selvinsky abroad, and then print in the newspaper that this is ‘gallimaufry’? The fascists quote our papers and ask the leftist intelligentsia: ‘Is this what you applauded a month ago’ and so forth”; see I. G. Erenburg, Pis’ma, ed. B. Ia. Frezinskii, 2: 222 (Moscow: Agraf, 2004). The political context surrounding the composition of Selvinsky’s “The Jewish Question” is very briefly discussed in Rainer Grübel, “Genij-Geije. Zur Struktur und zur Strukturbildenen Funktion eines Reims in dem Gedicht ‘Evreiskij vopros’ von Il’ja Sel’vinskij.” Die Welt der Slaven 18 (1973): 183-184. — 15 —\n\nI Saw It : Ilya Selvinsky and the Legacy of Bearing Witness to the Shoah, Academic Studies Press, 2013.

On 9 December 1942 Selvinsky spoke of this wartime upsurge of triple self-awareness in a letter he sent from Crimea to his wife Berta Selvinskaya:\n\nCopyright © 2013. Academic Studies Press. All rights reserved.\n\nOn 27, 28, and 29 September very heavy fighting took place, in which I had the happiness to participate. I underscore, happiness! These three days have enriched my soul. That I have survived and even remained unscathed is almost a miracle. […] I, for instance, simply cannot imagine not being at the front! This is not the Finnish Campaign, but a war, striking all of our motherland, a war on the outcome of which depends the whole future of our people and its cultutre. In such a war being at the front is not only a fulfillment of one’s duty but also an achievement of personal happiness. It is all about how one understands this very happiness.35 It was a military country at war, and many poets became soldiers. Some of them volunteered, others were drafted; others yet, including some of the leading authors of the older generation who did not volunteer, were evacuated to the hinterlands. Many Jewish-Russian authors served as military journalists during the war, becoming voices of the Soviet people fighting at both the war front and the home front. They viewed the war and their calling not only in Russian and Soviet terms, but also in Jewish ones. This new sense of mission (and commission) was liberating, yet it expressed itself in different ways, not all of them literary and some of them directly or indirectly propagandistic. As Mordechai Altshuler observes, “Upon the Nazi invasion of the USSR, the Soviet propaganda system stepped up its activity. Quite a few Jews enlisted very willingly in this system, sensing now, perhaps more than ever, that their sentiments and their country’s policies were fully aligned.”36 Soon after the Nazi invasion, Selvinsky volunteered for the war front. 35 Sel’vinskii, “Na voine. Iz dnevnikov i pisem rodnym,” 166-167; cf. excerpts in Babenko, Voina, 11-12. 36 Altshuler, “The Shoah in the Soviet Mass Media during the War and in the First Postwar Years Reexamined,” Yad Vashem Studies 39.2 (2011): 125. — 16 —\n\nI Saw It : Ilya Selvinsky and the Legacy of Bearing Witness to the Shoah, Academic Studies Press, 2013.

In fact, though Selvinsky arrived at the front in August 1941, he did not become a special correspondent for Red Star until October 1942, when he had already been serving as a rank-and-file writer for an army newspaper.\n\nCopyright © 2013.

Selvinsky was initially assigned as a staff writer to Syn otechestva (Son of Fatherland), the newspaper of the 51st Separate Army.38 He had apparently asked to be assigned to the Black Sea navy, but the then-powerful Mekhlis had a hand at placing 37 Tatyana Selvinskaya, Personal Interview, 15 December 2011. 38 See Selvinsky, Wartime Diaries, 23 September 1941 and 7 November 1941; cf.

(Courtesy of Ilya Selvinsky Memorial Museum, Simferopol.)\n\nSurviving wartime diaries offer examples of Selvinsky’s assessment of his literary affairs. Soon after arriving in Crimea, Selvinsky recorded this in a notebook titled “Diary. 1941. Soviet-Fascist War”: “[…T]here was also something promising in my life before the war. But, like a stone on my heart, lay three tragedies that could not even be printed, never mind staged. […] What can one do to forget one’s sad musings? How\n\n39 At the outbreak of the war with Nazi Germany the Soviet press and propaganda apparatus found itself not very well staffed to cover the frontlines, and hence there was a certain initial chanciness in the assignment of correspondents. See, for instance, Irina Shirokorad’s comments in her dissertation prospectus, “Tsentral’naia periodicheskaia pechat’ SSSR v gody Velikoi Otechestvennoi voiny, 1941-1945 gg.” Avtoreferat (Moscow, 2002), http://www.dissercat.com/ content/tsentralnaya-periodicheskaya-pechat-sssr-v-gody-velikoi-otechestvennoi-voiny-19411945-gg., last accessed 27 October 2011. — 18 —\n\nI Saw It : Ilya Selvinsky and the Legacy of Bearing Witness to the Shoah, Academic Studies Press, 2013.

Academic Studies Press. All rights reserved.\n\nSo I am in Crimea again. Just like back in 1918, it is once again my destiny to defend the same Turkish Rampart from the Germans. I was appointed, as is stated in PUR’s order No. 00738 [PUR is the acronym for the Chief Political Directorate of the Red Army], “to the position of staff writer [pisatel’]” for the editorial office of the army newspaper.” My rank is intendant second class. Oh, well… Considering that Pushkin’s rank was Kammerjunker [a court rank appropriate for a younger aristocrat, not a great poet], and Lermontov’s was simply junker [Lermontov’s rank during his years of study in junior officer’s school], I cannot fret too much. Second class, so be it.41 Selvinsky probably could not imagine that his native Crimea was to fall within months and that Sebastopol, the principal base of the Soviet Black Sea navy, would be besieged and eventually lost in July 1942. He speculated that some of his peers working at military newspapers might spend the war without ever tasting gunpowder. “I’m writing [this] in Sebastopol (I was given the assignment to prepare a page spread about the navy for the paper),” the poet noted on 23 October 1941. “I’m staying in the palace where [Admiral] Kolchak once stayed, and where the culture department of the front’s headquarters is presently housed. Writers are staying here […]. I saw Fedka [Fyodor] Reshetnikov, the cartoonist with whom I sailed on the SS Chelyuskin. The boys are living in comfort. They do not visit the frontlines. Evidently, they would live through the war in contentment.”42\n\n40 Selvinsky, Wartime Diaries, August 1941. 41 Babenko, Voina, 6. 42 Selvinsky, Wartime Diaries; cf. Babenko, Voina, 16; cf.

(Courtesy of Tatiana Selvinskaya).\n\nSelvinsky regretted not having been allowed to stay in Sebastopol and defend the city-port. The trajectory of the Soviet retreat brought him to the eastern part of the Crimean peninsula, where the Kerch peninsula forms a eastward-pointing protrusion. During the retreat of Soviet troops from the Kerch peninsula in November 1941, Selvinsky crossed the Strait of Taman with forces of the 51st Separate Army and arrived on the Taman peninsula.43 Less than two months later, during the Kerch-Feodosia Landing Operation, he returned to Kerch, the site of his most traumatic wartime experiences (see Ill. 11). Selvinsky’s path crossed with that of Mekhlis in February 1942, when Mekhlis, then head of PUR and Deputy People’s Commissar of Defense, was sent to the Crimean Front as Stalin’s representative. In his diary on 3 February 1942 Selvinsky noted a conversation with Mekhlis: “He spoke with me politely, but a bit on the dry side. Said that it was a crime on my part not to contribute to Red Star. Offered to transfer me from Son of Fatherland to Fighting Thrust (trading army for front) and stated that [with the transfer] he would change my status from that 43 See Babenko, Voina, 21-23. — 20 —\n\nI Saw It : Ilya Selvinsky and the Legacy of Bearing Witness to the Shoah, Academic Studies Press, 2013.

The Crimean Front. Circa late winter-early spring 1942. (Courtesy of Tatyana Selvinskaya).\n\nSelvinsky was profoundly affected by both the Nazi atrocities he witnessed in and around Kerch in January 1942, when the area was temporarily liberated, and the subsequent collapse of the Crimean Front and the Soviet military catastrophe at Kerch. Brooding over the disaster, which resulted in colossal human and material losses on the Soviet side, Selvinsky noted on 12 May 1942, having just arrived in Krasnodar from the falling Kerch, “Thus, the second stage of the struggle for Crimea will end as unfortunately as the first did. In both cases our talentless and poorly educated generals are to blame, who fear Stalin more than they do the enemy. […] Who will now answer for all of this? Well, let us suppose that Mekhlis and Kozlov [Lieutenant General Dmitri Kozlov, commander of the Crimean Front] will be shot, but does it really matter?”46 On 16 May 1942 Selvinsky wrote down this 46 Selvinsky, Wartime Diaries, 12 May 1942; cf.

Crimea has, once again, become foreign. Everything starts all over again. The blood of the landing has not resulted in anything.”47 Kozlov was demoted and transferred to a different army, and Mekhlis was severely demoted, removed from his high posts, and also transferred. After the Soviet troops left the Kerch peninsula for the second time in May 1942, Selvinsky found himself fighting on and reporting from the coast of the Black Sea and the Kuban region. He subsequently served, in 1942-1943, on the staff of Vpered k pobede! (Forward to Victory!), the newspaper of the political department of the North-Caucasus Front, into which the troops of the former Crimean Front were coopted, and then on the staff of its successor, the newspaper Vpered za rodinu!

In March 1942, after Selvinsky volunteered for and showed personal bravery in a mounted charge against the enemy, he was promoted, and his rank was officially changed from intendant (as was common for military journalists) to that of a combat political officer, senior battalion commissar (lieutenant colonel).50 During his service in the Black Sea region he was twice wounded and decorated for valor, with the Order of the Red Star and the Order of the Great Patriotic War (First Degree). 3. Jewish Poems in Praise of the Soviet Dictator? Did Selvinsky know and understand, during his first months at the front in August-October 1941, that the Nazis were annihilating the Jewish populations of the occupied Soviet territories?51 Could he fathom that once Crimea had been occupied, its Jews would be murdered? It is difficult to answer this question. A diary entry from 1 September 1941 describes a visit to the Jewish collective farm Fraybelen in the Dzhankoy district of Crimea (after the liberation of Crimea in 1944, when former Jewish rural communities were being given Russian names, Frayleben was renamed Volnoe):\n\nCopyright © 2013.

These horses, cows, sheep, pigs, this smell of manure, this endless procession of minute, but undelayable things to do—all of this introduces you into the daily living that had been typical of Jewry perhaps only in the biblical times. Yet how quickly the Jews have changed! Initially, by their curls and noses you still recognize the Jews in them. But already half an hour later you feel something new, more significant: that their entire psychology had adjusted to the new conditions of labor. As far as the children are concerned, even their noses have become shorter.52 The Nazis would occupy the area of Dzhankoy by the beginning of November 1941 and shortly proceed to eradicate its Jewish population. On the eve of the Shoah, Selvinsky spoke in concert with Soviet rhetoric on the Jewish question and did not display, at least in his diaries and letters, anxiety over the fate of the Crimean Jews. The events of the late autumn of 1941 would forever change his world. In September 1941 Selvinsky wrote and published, originally in the army newspaper Son of Fatherland on 22 September 1941, the poem “K evreiskomu narodu” (“To the Jewish Nation”). Not a great poem by any stretch of imagination, its intonation and its blank trochaic tetrameter almost parodically recalling Maxim Gorky’s “Song about a Falcon” of Soviet middle school fame, it deserves attention most of all for the sheer fact of its publication and reprinting in two of Selvinsky’s three wartime collections. In Selvinsky’s poem one hears echoes of Ehrenburg’s milestone speech “To the Jews” originally read at a rally in Moscow and printed in Izvestia on 26 August 1941. (Selvinsky had already left for the front and was not at the rally. Pasternak had been also invited to speak, but declined to attend, apparently explaining his refusal as unwillingness to limit his antifascist feelings to the Jewish question.53) “My mother tongue is Russian,” Ehrenburg said at the rally. “I am a Russian writer. Like all Russians, I am now defending my homeland. But the Hitlerites 52 Selvinsky, Wartime Diaries, 1 September 1941. 53 See Leonid Katsis, “’Doktor Zhivago’ B. Pasternaka: ot M.

And this adorns us.”54 In a diary entry dated October 1941, Selvinsky acknowledged taking inspiration from Ehrenburg’s essays and journalism during the early months of the Nazi invasion: “Every day newspapers arrive with Ehrenburg’s articles. What a fighting temperament, what an inexhaustible wealth of associations. What brilliance of style! This is a genius writer of essays […] Here’s someone to be envied. He alone does more for victory than all of us writers, taken together.”55 In January 1961, Selvinsky would echo his wartime response to Ehrenburg’s essays and journalism in a tribute to the Ukrainian poet Pavlo Tychyna (1891-1967): “But for a Communist there is no greater pride than the hatred of the enemies of the revolution. At war I passionately envied Ilya Ehrenburg, whom fascists so hated. Every day he appeared in the big newspapers, and his every article struck the target with the might of a tank division. I dreamed about achieving the same as a poet, but I did not succeed.”56 Selvinsky was never an admirer of Ehrenburg’s poetry, yet his poem’s title recalled—and Selvinsky may not have intended this—the title of Ehrenburg’s poetic entreaty “Evreiskomu narodu” (“To the Jewish Nation,” 1911), written at a very different time and voicing a call for Jews to gather strength, rise, and “return to Jerusalem, your native land.”57 In Selvinsky’s poem, which also has some of its sources in Soviet poetry about the Civil War (e.g., the work of Boris Kornilov), the rhetoric is not only one of a wartime reawakening of Jewish selfconsciousness during the Soviet war against Nazism, but also one of Jewish militancy and extreme bravery on the battlefields of the war:\n\n54 Ehrenburg, “To the Jews,” tr. Joshua Rubenstein, in Shrayer, An Anthology, 1: 532; cf. Erenburg, “Evreiam,” Izvestiia 26 August 1941; Erenburg, Staryi skorniak i drugie proizvedeniia, ed. M. Vainshtein, 2 vols., 2: 251-252 (Jerusalem: n.p., 1983). This motif, and the specific mention of the name of the poet’s mother, Hannah, is also found in Ehrenburg’s poem “Brodiat Rakhili, Khaimy, Lii…” (“Rachels, Hayims, and Leahs wander…”), an earlier version of which appeared in Ehrenburg’s 1941 collection Vernost’ (Loyalty); see Erenburg, Vernost’ (Ispaniia. Parizh). Stikhi, 52 (Moscow: OGIZ, 1941). 55 Selvinsky, Wartime Diaries, October 1941; cf. Sel’vinskii, “Ia eto videl (Krymskie stranitsy voennykh dnevnikov),” 78.

I say this with pride. Hitler hates us more than anything. And this adorns us [Eto nas ukrashaet].” To dismiss Selvinsky’s “To the Jewish People” as merely opportunistic would be an oversimplification, especially because keeping silent about Jewish questions would have been simpler and safer for a Soviet Jew, poet, and military officer. A propensity to link the wartime destiny of Jews—perhaps even Jewish survival—with Stalin’s role in history is already emergent in this poem and must therefore be noted. Selvinsky’s poetic address to the Jews signals the authorial intention to praise the leader. The antepenultimate and penultimate lines, “Tochno statuiu iz stali, /L’iut pobedu…” (“Cast the victory,/ Like a statue of steel…”), evoke Stalin’s name through the implied rhyming of stali (genitive of stal’) with “Stalin” (the leader’s adopted last name, derived from the Russian noun stal’ = steel). During the war years, Selvinsky recycled the “Stalin-steel” rhyme and the allusion in at least two oth"
