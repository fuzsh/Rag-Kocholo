It is suggested that for operational control ratio of components of the charge must be solved the problem of determining the qualitative composition of the melt in real time. The use of 0th harmonic of phase voltage AC furnace as an indirect measure of the melt composition is proposed. Brief description of the mechanism of occurrence and nature of the non-zero 0th harmonic of the AC voltage of the arc is given. It is shown that value of 0th harmonic of the arc voltage is not function of electrical parameters but depends of the material composition of the melt. Processed industrial data are given. Hammerstein-Wiener model is used for description of the dependence of 0th harmonic of the furnace voltage from the technical parameters of melting furnace: the melt composition and current. Recommendations are given about the practical use of the model.\n\nFerrosilicon smelting in a direct current furnace\n\nDOEpatents\n\nDosaj, V.D.; May, J.B.\n\n1992-12-29\n\nThe present invention is a process for smelting ferrosilicon alloy.

Volatilization of impurities such as As and Sb should occur as early as possible in the process, and preferably within the smelting furnace, so that they do not contaminate the industrial environment nor interfere with the operation of downstream equipment. Using of copper-zinc concentrates in the blast furnace process for recycling lead-containing materials achieves: (1) high copper extraction to matte; (2) high lead extraction to lead bullion; and (3) high zinc extraction to slag, while at the same time producing a more efficient volatilization of As and Sb. Based on both laboratory and industrial data and thermodynamic considerations, the advantages of this blast furnace process for the treatment of recycled lead-containing materials are discussed.\n\nImproving the engineering-and-economical performance of ore-thermal electric furnaces in the smelting of silicomanganese\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKondrashov, V.

In the recent years, ferronickel has been used as a substitute for electrolytic nickel for alleviating the cost of stainless steel production. Rotary kiln-electric furnace (RKEF) smelting is currently the world-wide mainstreaming process for ferronickel production from nickeliferous laterite ore, in spite of the high power consumption. In this study, aiming to provide some meaningful guidance for ferronickel production of RKEF smelting, reductive roasting followed by smelting process was carried out. The conditions including reducing parameters (roasting temperature and time) and smelting parameters (coke dosage, CaO dosage, melting temperature and time) were ascertained. The metal recovery ratios, as well as Ni, Fe, S and P content of ferronickel were considered. The results showed that a ferronickel containing 10. 32 wt. % Ni was obtained from a laterite with 1. 85 wt. % Ni, the nickel recovery ratio was about 99%.\n\nTrace metals related to historical iron smelting at Hopewell Furnace National Historic Site, Berks and Chester Counties, Pennsylvania\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSloto, Ronald A.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nIron ore containing elevated concentrations of trace metals was smelted at Hopewell Furnace during its 113 years of operation (1771-1883). The ore used at Hopewell Furnace was obtained from iron mines within 5 miles of the furnace. The iron-ore deposits were formed about 200 million years ago and contain abundant magnetite, the primary iron mineral, and accessory minerals enriched in arsenic, cobalt, copper, lead, and other metals. Hopewell Furnace, built by Mark Bird during 1770-71, was one of the last of the charcoal-burning, cold-blast iron furnaces operated in Pennsylvania. The most productive years for Hopewell Furnace were from 1830 to 1837. Castings were the most profitable product, especially the popular Hopewell Stove. More than 80,000 stoves were cast at Hopewell, which produced as many as 23 types and sizes of cooking and heating stoves. Beginning in the 1840s, the iron industry shifted to large-scale, steam-driven coke and anthracite furnaces. Independent rural enterprises like Hopewell could no longer compete when the iron and steel industries consolidated in urban manufacturing centers. The furnace ceased operation in 1883 (Kurjack, 1954). The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with the National Park Service, completed a study at Hopewell Furnace National Historic Site (NHS) in Berks and Chester Counties, Pennsylvania, to determine the fate of toxic trace metals, such as arsenic, cobalt, and lead, released into the environment during historical iron-smelting operations. The results of the study, conducted during 2008-10, are presented in this fact sheet.\n\nLance for fuel and oxygen injection into smelting or refining furnace\n\nDOEpatents\n\nSchlichting, M.R.\n\n1994-12-20\n\nA furnace for smelting iron ore and/or refining molten iron is equipped with an overhead pneumatic lance, through which a center stream of particulate coal is ejected at high velocity into a slag layer. An annular stream of nitrogen or argon enshrouds the coal stream. Oxygen is simultaneously ejected in an annular stream encircling the inert gas stream. The interposition of the inert gas stream between the coal and oxygen streams prevents the volatile matter in the coal from combusting before it reaches the slag layer. Heat of combustion is thus more efficiently delivered to the slag, where it is needed to sustain the desired reactions occurring there. A second stream of lower velocity oxygen can be delivered through an outermost annulus to react with carbon monoxide gas rising from slag layer, thereby adding still more heat to the furnace. 7 figures.\n\n40 CFR Table 2 to Subpart X of... - Emissions Limits for Secondary Lead Smelting Furnaces\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2014 CFR\n\n2014-07-01\n\n... 40 Protection of Environment 10 2014-07-01 2014-07-01 false Emissions Limits for Secondary Lead Smelting Furnaces 2 Table 2 to Subpart X of Part 63 Protection of Environment ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION...

Being a third country which has a nickel laterite ore in the world after New Caledonia and Philippines. However, the processing of nickel laterite ore to increase its levels in Indonesia is still lacking. In the processing of nickel laterite ore into metal, it can be processed by pyrometallurgy method that typically use coal as a reductant. However, coal is a non-renewable energy and have high enough levels of pollution. One potentially replace is the biomass, that is a renewable energy. Palm kernel shell are biomass that can be used as a reductant because it has a fairly high fix carbon content. This research aims to make nickel laterite ores become metal using palm kernel shell charcoal as reductant in mini electric arc furnace. The result show that the best smelting time of this research is 60 minutes with the best composition of the reductant is 2,000 gram.\n\nEffect of basicity on beneficiated chromite sand smelting process using submerged arc furnace\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNurjaman, F.; Subandrio, S.; Ferdian, D.; Suharno, Bambang\n\n2018-05-01\n\nFerrochrome is an important alloy in stainless steel making due to its contribution to high strength and corrosion resistance. In this present study, ferrochrome was derived from Indonesian chromite sand with low-grade Cr/Fe ratio. In order to improve the ratio, beneficiation process such as pre-magnetic separation and reduction process at 1000Â°C for 60 minutes was required. The process followed by another magnetic separation, thus the Cr/Fe ratio was increased from 0.9 to 1.6. The reduction process used coconut shell charcoal as reductant and limestone as an additive. The beneficiated sand chromite was briquette using bentonite as a binder in 2 wt.% before it was smelted in a submerged electric arc furnace to produce ferrochrome. Basicity was controlled by the addition of limestone and it was varied from 0.4-1.6. Furthermore, the composition of ferrochrome was analyzed by using X-Ray Fluorescence. From this experiment, the result showed that chromium recovery and specific energy was decreased with the increasing of slag basicity.\n\nA Water Model Study on Mixing Behavior of the Two-Layered Bath in Bottom Blown Copper Smelting Furnace\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShui, Lang; Cui, Zhixiang; Ma, Xiaodong; Jiang, Xu; Chen, Mao; Xiang, Yong; Zhao, Baojun\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe bottom-blown copper smelting furnace is a novel copper smelter developed in recent years. Many advantages of this furnace have been found, related to bath mixing behavior under its specific gas injection scheme. This study aims to use an oil-water double-phased laboratory-scale model to investigate the impact of industry-adjustable variables on bath mixing time, including lower layer thickness, gas flow rate, upper layer thickness and upper layer viscosity. Based on experimental results, an overall empirical relationship of mixing time in terms of these variables has been correlated, which provides the methodology for industry to optimize mass transfer in the furnace.\n\nBehavior of an indigenously fabricated transferred arc plasma furnace for smelting studies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nA, K. MANDAL; R, K. DISHWAR; O, P. SINHA\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe utilization of industrial solid waste for metal recovery requires high-temperature tools due to the presence of silica and alumina, which is reducible at high temperature. In a plasma arc furnace, transferred arc plasma furnace (TAP) can meet all requirements, but the disadvantage of this technology is the high cost. For performing experiments in the laboratory, the TAP was fabricated indigenously in a laboratory based on the different inputs provided in the literature for the furnace design and fabrication. The observed parameters such as arc length, energy consumption, graphite electrode consumption, noise level as well as lining erosion were characterized for this fabricated furnace. The nitrogen plasma increased by around 200 K (200 Â°C) melt temperature and noise levels decreased by â¼10 dB compared to a normal arc. Hydrogen plasma offered 100 K (100 Â°C) higher melt temperature with â¼5 dB higher sound level than nitrogen plasma. Nitrogen plasma arc melting showed lower electrode and energy consumption than normal arc melting, whereas hydrogen plasma showed lower energy consumption and higher electrode consumption in comparison to nitrogen plasma. The higher plasma arc temperature resulted in a shorter meltdown time than normal arc with smoother arcing. Hydrogen plasma permitted more heats, reduced meltdown time, and lower energy consumption, but with increased graphite consumption and crucible wear. The present study showed that the fabricated arc plasma is better than the normal arc furnace with respect to temperature generation, energy consumption, and environmental friendliness. Therefore, it could be used effectively for smelting-reduction studies.\n\n[The industrial environment in the electric-furnace steel smelting, converter and open-hearth furnace methods of manufacturing manganese-alloyed steels].\n\nPubMed\n\nKarnaukh, N G; Petrov, G A; Gapon, V A; Poslednichenko, I P; Shmidt, S E\n\n1992-01-01\n\nInspection of the environment in manganese-alloyed steel production showed inadequate hygienic conditions of the technological processes employed. Air was more polluted by manganese oxides during the oxygen-converter process though their highest concentrations, 38 times exceeding the MAS, appeared during the casting of steel. An electric furnace coated by dust-noise-proof material and gas cleaning is preferable from a hygienic point of view. The influence of unfavourable microclimate, intensive infrared irradiation and loud noise on workers necessitates automation and mechanization of the process in order to improve the working conditions.\n\nCHARGING SIDE OF #130 ELECTRIC FURNACE CO.

The effects of coal-to-slag ratio, w, and the reduction time, t, were considered for two different coal/slag mixing procedures. In the first procedure, metallurgical coal was added to the molten slag, whereas in the second procedure, coal was premixed with the solid slag before charging into the furnace. The recovery of heavy metals (Cu, Co), and the fuming of Pb and Zn were investigated. Contamination of the metal phase by iron and the acidity index of the final slag were analysed as these may impede the economical viability of the process. The lower w value of 2.56% yielded a recovery rate of less than 60% for copper and less than 50% for cobalt, and around 70% for zinc. However, increasing w to 5% allowed the recovery of 70-90% for Cu, Co and Zn simultaneously after 30-60 min reduction of the molten slag. After reduction, the cleaned slags contained only small amounts of copper and cobalt (<0.4 wt%). Fuming of lead and zinc was efficient as the %Pb of the residual slag dropped to levels lower than 0.04% after 30 min of reduction. Ninety percent of the lead was removed from the initial slag and collected in the dusts. The zinc content of the cleaned slags quickly dropped to between 1 and 3 wt% from the initial 8.2% after 30 min reduction for w value of 5 and after 60 min reduction for w value of 2.56. The dusts contained about 60% Zn and 10% Pb. Recovery of lead from fuming of the slag was higher than 90% in all the experimental conditions considered in this study.\n\n2.

The leaching of major elements from the slags was monitored as a function of pH (4, 5.5, 7, 8.5 and 10) under both atmospheres for different slag-water interaction times (1Â day and 9 days). The leaching results were coupled with a geochemical model; Visual MINTEQ version 3.0, and a detailed morphological and mineralogical analysis was performed on the leached slags by scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM). Significant amounts of Ca, Fe and Zn were released under acidic conditions (pH 4) with a decrease towards the neutral to alkaline conditions (pH 7 and 10) for both LBF and ISF slags. On the other hand, Fe leachability was limited at neutral to alkaline pH for both slags. The concentrations of all elements increased gradually after 216Â h compared to initial 24Â h of leaching period. The presence of oxygen under open-air atmosphere not only enhanced oxidative weathering but also encouraged formation of secondary oxide and carbonate phases. Formation of carbonates and clay minerals was suggested by Visual MINTEQ which was further confirmed by SEM & TEM. The hydration and partial dissolution of hardystonite, as well as the destabilization of amorphous glassy matrix mainly contributed to the release of major elements, whereas the spinel related oxides were resistant against pH changes and atmospheres within the time frame concerned for both LBF and ISF slags. The total amount of Pb leached out at pH 7 under both atmospheres suggested that both LBF and ISF slags are prone to weathering even at neutral environmental conditions.

A computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model was developed to study the zinc slag fuming process from imperial smelting furnace (ISF) slag in a top-submerged lance furnace and to investigate the details of fluid flow, reaction kinetics, and heat transfer in the furnace. The model integrates combustion phenomena and chemical reactions with the heat, mass, and momentum interfacial interaction between the phases present in the system. A commercial CFD package AVL Fire 2009.2 (AVL, Graz, Austria) coupled with a number of user-defined subroutines in FORTRAN programming language were used to develop the model. The model is based on three-dimensional (3-D) Eulerian multiphase flow approach, and it predicts the velocity and temperature field of the molten slag bath, generated turbulence, and vortex and plume shape at the lance tip. The model also predicts the mass fractions of slag and gaseous components inside the furnace. The model predicted that the percent of ZnO in the slag bath decreases linearly with time and is consistent broadly with the experimental data. The zinc fuming rate from the slag bath predicted by the model was validated through macrostep validation process against the experimental study of Waladan et al. The model results predicted that the rate of ZnO reduction is controlled by the mass transfer of ZnO from the bulk slag to slag-gas interface and rate of gas-carbon reaction for the specified simulation time studied. Although the model is based on zinc slag fuming, the basic approach could be expanded or applied for the CFD analysis of analogous systems.\n\nThe Exact Art and Subtle Science of DC Smelting: Practical Perspectives on the Hot Zone\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGeldenhuys, Isabel J.\n\n2017-02-01\n\nIncreasingly, sustainable smelting requires technology that can process metallurgically complex, low-grade, ultra-fine and waste materials. It is likely that more applications for direct current (DC) technology will inevitably follow in the future as DC open-arc furnaces have some wonderful features that facilitate processing of a variety of materials in an open-arc open-bath configuration. A DC open-arc furnace allows for optimization and choice of chemistry to benefit the process, rather than being constrained by the electrical or physical properties of the material. In a DC configuration, the power is typically supplied by an open arc, providing relative independence and thus an extra degree of freedom. However, if the inherent features of the technology are misunderstood, much of the potential may never be realised. It is thus important to take cognisance of the freedom an operator will have as a result of the open arc and ensure that operating strategies are implemented. This extra degree of freedom hands an operator a very flexible tool, namely virtually unlimited power. Successful open-arc smelting is about properly managing the balance between power and feed, and practical perspectives on the importance of power and feed balance are presented to highlight this aspect as the foundation of proper open-arc furnace control.\n\nSolar Convective Furnace for Metals Processing\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPatidar, Deepesh; Tiwari, Sheetanshu; Sharma, Piyush; Pardeshi, Ravindra; Chandra, Laltu; Shekhar, Rajiv\n\n2015-11-01\n\nMetals processing operations, primarily soaking, heat treatment, and melting of metals are energy-intensive processes using fossil fuels, either directly or indirectly as electricity, to operate furnaces at high temperatures. Use of concentrated solar energy as a source of heat could be a viable \"green\" option for industrial heat treatment furnaces. This paper introduces the concept of a solar convective furnace which utilizes hot air generated by an open volumetric air receiver (OVAR)-based solar tower technology. The potential for heating air above 1000Â°C exists. Air temperatures of 700Â°C have already been achieved in a 1.5-MWe volumetric air receiver demonstration plant. Efforts to retrofit an industrial aluminium soaking furnace for integration with a solar tower system are briefly described. The design and performance of an OVAR has been discussed. A strategy for designing a 1/15th-scale model of an industrial aluminium soaking furnace has been presented. Preliminary flow and thermal simulation results suggest the presence of recirculating flow in existing furnaces that could possibly result in non-uniform heating of the slabs. The multifarious uses of concentrated solar energy, for example in smelting, metals processing, and even fuel production, should enable it to overcome its cost disadvantage with respect to solar photovoltaics.\n\n[The electric furnace of Henri Moissan at one hundred years: connection with the electric furnace, the solar furnace, the plasma furnace?].\n\nPubMed\n\nRoyÃ¨re, C\n\n1999-03-01\n\nThe trace of Henri Moissan's pioneer work 100 years ago is clearly evidenced by an overview of achievements in high temperature devices; 1987: \"Le four Ã©lectrique\" by Henri Moissan; 1948-1952: \"High temperature heating in a cavity rotary kiln using focusing of solar radiation\" by FÃ©lix Trombe; 1962: \"The cavity rotary kiln using focused solar radiation jointly with a plasma gun\" by Marc FoÃ«x; 1970: \"The rotary kiln with two plasma guns and arc transfer\" by Marc FoÃ«x; 1984: \"The plasma furnace\" by ElectricitÃ© de France (EDF) at RenardiÃ¨res; 1997: \"The plasma furnace\" by the Atomic Energy Center (CEA) at Cadarache, the VULCANO program. The first part of this contribution is devoted to Henri Moissan. Re-reading his early book on the electric furnace, especially the first chapter and the sections on silica, carbon vapor and experiments performed in casting molten metal--the conclusions are outstanding--provides modern readers with an amazing insight into future developments. The last two parts are devoted to FÃ©lix Trombe and Marc FoÃ«x, tracing the evolution of high temperature cavity processus leading to the solar furnace and the present day plasma furnace at the CEA. Focus is placed on research conducted by the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) with the solar and plasma furnaces at Odeillo. The relationships with Henri Moissan's early work are amazing, offering a well deserved homage to this pioneer researcher.\n\nManufacturing and Application of Metalized Ore-Coal Pellets in Synthetic Pig Iron Smelting\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNokhrina, O.

Carbon balance of the process is assessed by measuring the amount of carbon monoxide evolved in offgas exiting the furnace. A ratio of the amount of carbon monoxide evolved and the amount of silicon dioxide added to the furnace is determined. Based on this ratio, the carbon balance of the furnace can be determined and carbon feed can be adjusted to maintain the furnace in carbon balance.\n\nElements of the electric arc furnace's environmental management\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIoana, Adrian; Semenescu, Augustin; Costoiu, Mihnea; Marcu, DragoÅ\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe paper presents a theoretical and experimental analysis of the polluting generating mechanisms for steel making in the Electric Arc Furnaces (EAF). The scheme for the environment's polluting system through the EAF is designed and presented in this paper. The ecological experimenting consisted of determining by specialized measures of the dust percentage in the evacuated gases from the EAF and of thereof gas pollutants. From the point of view of reducing the impact on the environment, the main problem of the electric arc furnace (EAF) is the optimization of the powder collecting from the process gases, both from the furnace and from the work-area. The paper deals with the best dependence between the aggregate's constructive, functional and technological factors, which are necessary for the furnace's ecologization and for its energetically-technologically performances increasing.\n\nChemical recovery process using break up steam control to prevent smelt explosions\n\nDOEpatents\n\nKohl, Arthur L.; Stewart, Albert E.\n\n1988-08-02\n\nAn improvement in a chemical recovery process in which a hot liquid smelt is introduced into a dissolving tank containing a pool of green liquor.

A.; Gileva, L. Y.; Lavrov, V. V.\n\n2016-09-01\n\nModern Iron & Steel Works as a rule are equipped with powerful distributed control systems (DCS) and databases. Implementation of DSC system solves the problem of storage, control, protection, entry, editing and retrieving of information as well as generation of required reporting data. The most advanced and promising approach is to use decision support information technologies based on a complex of mathematical models. The model decision support system for control of blast furnace smelting is designed and operated. The basis of the model system is a complex of mathematical models created using the principle of natural mathematical modeling. This principle provides for construction of mathematical models of two levels. The first level model is a basic state model which makes it possible to assess the vector of system parameters using field data and blast furnace operation results. It is also used to calculate the adjustment (adaptation) coefficients of the predictive block of the system. The second-level model is a predictive model designed to assess the design parameters of the blast furnace process when there are changes in melting conditions relative to its current state. Tasks for which software is developed are described. Characteristics of the main subsystems of the blast furnace process as an object of modeling and control - thermal state of the furnace, blast, gas dynamic and slag conditions of blast furnace smelting - are presented.\n\nA CPS Based Optimal Operational Control System for Fused Magnesium Furnace\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nChai, Tian-you; Wu, Zhi-wei; Wang, Hong\n\nFused magnesia smelting for fused magnesium furnace (FMF) is an energy intensive process with high temperature and comprehensive complexities. Its operational index namely energy consumption per ton (ECPT) is defined as the consumed electrical energy per ton of acceptable quality and is difficult to measure online. Moreover, the dynamics of ECPT cannot be precisely modelled mathematically. The model parameters of the three-phase currents of the electrodes such as the molten pool level, its variation rate and resistance are uncertain and nonlinear functions of the changes in both the smelting process and the raw materials composition. In this paper, an integratedmoreÂ Â» optimal operational control algorithm proposed is composed of a current set-point control, a current switching control and a self-optimized tuning mechanism. The tight conjoining of and coordination between the computational resources including the integrated optimal operational control, embedded software, industrial cloud, wireless communication and the physical resources of FMF constitutes a cyber-physical system (CPS) based embedded optimal operational control system. Successful application of this system has been made for a production line with ten fused magnesium furnaces in a factory in China, leading to a significant reduced ECPT.Â«Â less\n\nCharacterization of Sintering Dust, Blast Furnace Dust and Carbon Steel Electric Arc Furnace Dust\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChang, Feng; Wu, Shengli; Zhang, Fengjie; Lu, Hua; Du, Kaiping\n\nIn order to make a complete understanding of steel plant metallurgical dusts and to realize the goal of zero-waste, a study of their properties was undertaken. For these purposes, samples of two sintering dusts (SD), two blast furnace dusts (BFD), and one electric arc furnace dust (EAFD) taken from the regular production process were subjected to a series of tests. The tests were carried out by using granulometry analysis, chemical analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy via SEM (EDS), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The dominant elements having an advantage of reuse are Fe, K, Cl, Zn, C. The dominant mineralogical phases identified in sintering dust are KCl, Fe2O3, CaCO3, CaMg(CO3)2, NaCl, SiO2. Mineralogical phases exist in blast furnace dust are Fe2O3, Fe3O4, with small amount of KCl and kaolinite coexist. While in electric arc furnace dust, Fe3O4, ZnFe2O4, CaCO3, CaO, Ca(OH)2 are detected.\n\nMathematical model of whole-process calculation for bottom-blowing copper smelting\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, Ming-zhou; Zhou, Jie-min; Tong, Chang-ren; Zhang, Wen-hai; Li, He-song\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe distribution law of materials in smelting products is key to cost accounting and contaminant control. Regardless, the distribution law is difficult to determine quickly and accurately by mere sampling and analysis. Mathematical models for material and heat balance in bottom-blowing smelting, converting, anode furnace refining, and electrolytic refining were established based on the principles of material (element) conservation, energy conservation, and control index constraint in copper bottom-blowing smelting. Simulation of the entire process of bottom-blowing copper smelting was established using a self-developed MetCal software platform. A whole-process simulation for an enterprise in China was then conducted. Results indicated that the quantity and composition information of unknown materials, as well as heat balance information, can be quickly calculated using the model. Comparison of production data revealed that the model can basically reflect the distribution law of the materials in bottom-blowing copper smelting. This finding provides theoretical guidance for mastering the performance of the entire process.\n\n40 CFR 424.21 - Specialized definitions.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2011 CFR\n\n2011-07-01\n\n... mean megawatt hour(s) of electrical energy consumed in the smelting process (furnace power consumption). ...

On one hand, there is a trend toward complete recycling of the dust captured in furnace baghouses. Iron units as well as zinc and other elements are being reclaimed. On the other side, recent actions by regulators indicate recycling may not be required at all. With the correct chemical stabilization, it appears, dust may simply be placed in ordinary landfill. This paper describes three processes for waste treatment of furnace dust: Super Detox, a process for zinc removal from galvanized scrap before melting, and themoreÂ Â» INMETCO process.Â«Â less\n\nThe Effect Of Local Coal And Smelting Sponge Iron On Iron Content Of Pig Iron\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOediyani, Soesaptri; Juwita Sari, Pramita; Hadi P, Djoko\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe new regulation on mineral resources was announced by Ministry of Energy and Mineral resources (ESDM) of Indonesia at 2014 which it called Permen ESDM No 1/2014. Therefore, this research was conducted to add the value of local iron ores by using smelting technology. The objective of the research is to produce pig iron that meet the requirement of the new regulation of mineral resources such as 90% Fe. First, iron ores and coal mixed together with lime as a flux, then smelted in a Electric Arc Furnace at 1800Â°C. The process variables are (1; 1.25; 1.5; 1.75; 2.0) and the composition of coal (0.8%, 1.6%, 3.0%). The type of coal that used in this research was bituminous coal from Kalimantan and also the iron ores from Kalimantan. The products of the smelting technology are Pig iron and slag. Both pig iron and slag then analyzed by SEM-EDS to measure the iron content. The result shows that the maximum iron content on pig iron is about 95.04% meanwhile the minimum iron content on slag is about 3.66%. This result achieved at 1.6% coal and 2.0.\n\nMultipurpose electric furnace system. [for use in Apollo-Soyuz Test Program\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMazelsky, R.; Duncan, C.

The calculation method of electrical and energy characteristics of furnaces with a conductive crucible has been developed and the example of the calculation is shown below.

C.; Ioana, A.; Constantin, N.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nInitially, the carbon content was reduced by mixing âthe ironâ with metallic ingots in ceramic crucibles/melting pots, with external heat input. As time went by the puddling procedure was developed, a procedure which also assumes a mixture with oxidized iron ore. In 1856 Bessemer invented the convertor, thus demonstrating that steel can be obtained following the transition of an air stream through the liquid pig iron. The invention of Thomas, a slightly modified basic-lined converter, fostered the desulphurization of the steel and the removal of the phosphate from it. During the same period, in 1865, in Sireuil, the Frenchman Martin applies Siemensâ heat regeneration invention and brings into service the furnace with a charge composed of iron pig, scrap iron and iron ore, that produces a high quality steel [1]. An act worthy of being highlighted within the scope of steelmaking is the start-up of the converter with oxygen injection at the upper side, as there are converters that can produce 400 tons of steel in approximately 50 minutes. Currently, the share of the steel produced in electric arc furnaces with a charge composed of scrap iron has increased. Due to this aspect, the electric arc furnace was able to impose itself on the market.\n\nApplication of Carbon Composite Bricks for Blast Furnace Hearth\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZuo, Haibin; Wang, Cong; Zhang, Jianliang; Zhao, Yongan; Jiao, Kexin\n\nTraditional refractory materials for blast furnace hearth lining are mainly composed of carbon bricks and the ceramic cup. However, these materials can't meet the demands for long service life design of blast furnaces. In this paper, a new refractory called carbon composite brick (CCB) was introduced, which combined the advantages of carbon bricks and the ceramic cup. In this case, the resistance of the CCB against corrosion was equal to the ceramic cup and the thermal conductivity of the CCB was equal to carbon bricks. From the results of more than 20 blast furnaces, the CCB could be well used in small blast furnaces and large blast furnaces. In the bad condition of low grade burden and high smelting intensity, the CCB gave full play to the role of cooling system, and effectively resisted the erosion of hot metal to improve the service life of blast furnaces.\n\n15.

Whereas the radiative decay of thermal excitations is always taking place in high temperatures needed in steel production, one of the most promising environment for such studies are electric arc furnaces, creating plasma in excited electronic states that relax with intense characteristic emission in the optical regime. Unfortunately, large industrial scale electric arc furnaces also present a challenging environment for optical emission studies and application of the method is not straightforward. To study the usability of optical emission spectroscopy in real electric arc furnaces, we have developed a laboratory scale DC electric arc furnace presented in this paper. With the setup, optical emission spectra of Fe, Cr, Cr2O3, Ni, SiO2, Al2O3, CaO, and MgO were recorded in the wavelength range 250-600 nm and the results were analyzed with the help of reference data. The work demonstrates that using characteristic optical emission, obtaining in situ chemical information from oscillating plasma of electric arc furnaces is indeed possible. In spite of complications, the method could possibly be applied to industrial scale steel making process in order to improve its efficiency.\n\nELECTRIC HOLDING FURNACE IN THE MALLEABLE FOUNDRY MAINTAINS CONSTANT TEMPERATURES ...\n\nLibrary of Congress Historic Buildings Survey, Historic Engineering Record, Historic Landscapes Survey\n\nELECTRIC HOLDING FURNACE IN THE MALLEABLE FOUNDRY MAINTAINS CONSTANT TEMPERATURES FOR IRON PRIOR TO FILLING MOBILE LADLES. - Stockham Pipe & Fittings Company, Malleable Foundry, 4000 Tenth Avenue North, Birmingham, Jefferson County, AL\n\nPOURING IRON FROM ELECTRIC FURNACE INTO BULL LADLE AFTER MAGNESIUM ...\n\nLibrary of Congress Historic Buildings Survey, Historic Engineering Record, Historic Landscapes Survey\n\nPOURING IRON FROM ELECTRIC FURNACE INTO BULL LADLE AFTER MAGNESIUM HAD BEEN ADDED TO GENERATE DUCTILE IRON WHEN IT COOLS IN THE MOLD. - Southern Ductile Casting Company, Casting, 2217 Carolina Avenue, Bessemer, Jefferson County, AL\n\n8.

Steady trend of last years is an increase of steel production in electric arc furnaces (EAF) with a very high consumption of electricity up to 750 kWh/ton. The intention to reduce so much energy consumption they can reach by many ways. One of such way is a transforming heat energy of liquid steel to electricity and destine it to steel electric arc process.

I.; Bikeev, R. A.; Goreva, L. P.\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThe paper describes a new calculation method for active and inductive resistance of split interleaved current leads packages in ore-thermal electric furnaces. The method is developed on basis of regression analysis of dependencies of active and inductive resistances of the packages on their geometrical parameters, mutual disposition and interleaving pattern. These multi-parametric calculations have been performed with ANSYS software. The proposed method allows solving split current lead electrical parameters minimization and balancing problems for ore-thermal furnaces.\n\nSkid resistance performance of asphalt wearing courses with electric arc furnace slag aggregates.\n\nPubMed\n\nKehagia, Fotini\n\n2009-05-01\n\nMetallurgical slags are by-products of the iron and steel industry and are subdivided into blast furnace slag and steel slag according to the different steel-producing processes. In Greece, slags are mostly produced from steelmaking using the electric arc furnace process, and subsequently are either disposed in a random way or utilized by the cement industry. Steel slag has been recently used, worldwide, as hard aggregates in wearing courses in order to improve the skidding resistance of asphalt pavements. At the Highway Laboratory, Department of Civil Engineering of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki research has been carried out in the field of steel slags, and especially in electric arc furnace (EAF) slag, to evaluate their possible use in highway engineering. In this paper, the recent results of anti-skidding performance of steel slag aggregates in highway pavements are presented.\n\nApplication of the radioisotope excited X-ray fluorescence technique in charge optimization during thermite smelting of Fe-Ni, Fe-cr, and Fe-Ti alloys\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSharma, I.G.; Joseph, D.; Lal, M.\n\n1995-10-01\n\nA wide range of ferroalloys are used to facilitate the addition of different alloying elements to molten steel. High-carbon ferroalloys are produced on a tonnage basis by carbothermic smelting in an electric furnace, and an aluminothermic route is generally adopted for small scale production of low-carbon varieties. The physicochemical principles of carbothermy and aluminothermy have been well documented in the literature. However, limited technical data are reported on the production of individual ferroalloys of low-carbon varieties from their selected resources. The authors demonstrate her the application of an energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) technique in meeting the analytical requirements ofmoreÂ Â» a thermite smelting campaign, carried out with the aim of preparing low-carbon-low-nitrogen Fe-Ni, Fe-Cr, and Fe-Ti alloys from indigenously available nickel bearing spent catalyst, mineral chromite, and ilmenite/rutile, respectively. They have chosen the EDXRF technique to meet the analytical requirements because of its capability to analyze samples of ore, minerals, a metal, and alloys in different forms, such as powder, sponge, as-smelted, or as-cast, to obtain rapid multielement analyses with ease. Rapid analyses of thermite feed and product by this technique have aided in the appropriate alterations of the charge constitutents to obtain optimum charge consumption.Â«Â less\n\nFuel and oxygen addition for metal smelting or refining process\n\nDOEpatents\n\nSchlichting, M.R.\n\n1994-11-22\n\nA furnace for smelting iron ore and/or refining molten iron is equipped with an overhead pneumatic lance, through which a center stream of particulate coal is ejected at high velocity into a slag layer. An annular stream of nitrogen or argon enshrouds the coal stream. Oxygen is simultaneously ejected in an annular stream encircling the inert gas stream. The interposition of the inert gas stream between the coal and oxygen streams prevents the volatile matter in the coal from combusting before it reaches the slag layer. Heat of combustion is thus more efficiently delivered to the slag, where it is needed to sustain the desired reactions occurring there. A second stream of lower velocity oxygen can be delivered through an outermost annulus to react with carbon monoxide gas rising from slag layer, thereby adding still more heat to the furnace. 7 figs.\n\nNickel-smelting fumes increased the expression of HIF-1Î± through PI3K/ERK pathway in NIH/3T3 cells\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHan, Dan; Yang, Yue; Zhang, Lin; Wang, Chao; Wang, Yue; Tan, Wen-Qiao; Hu, Xue-Ying; Wu, Yong-Hui\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of Nickel (Ni) -smelting fumes on oncogenic proteins in vivo and in vitro. Methods: Ni fallout beside a Ni smelting furnace in a factory was sampled to study its toxic effect. The effects of Ni-smelting fumes on the regulation of PI3K and ERK signaling pathways and the important downstream hypoxia inducible factor, HIF-1Î±, were studied both in NIH/3T3 cells and in the lung tissue of rats. NIH/3T3 cell transformation induced by Ni-smelting fumes was also observed. Results: Ni-smelting fumes activated PI3K, p-AKT, p70S6K1, and ERK proteins and increased HIF-1Î± expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. However, activation was suppressed when NIH/3T3 cells were pretreated with PI3K/AKT or ERK inhibitors. Ni-smelting fumes caused malignant transformation of NIH/3T3 cells. Conclusions: Ni-smelting fumes increased the expression of HIF-1Î± through the PI3K/ERK pathway in NIH/3T3 cells and induced malignant transformation in these cells indicating that Ni-smelting fumes may be a potential carcinogen in mammalian cells.

Smelting of olivine and pyroxene-saturated magmatic liquids produces orthopyroxene-without-olivine crystalline derivatives unlike those in ureilites. Thus the Mg# compositional variation within the ureilite suite, which is commonly attributed to partial smelting, cannot plausibly be produced by assemblages rich in liquid. In situ smelting of graphitic olivine + pigeonite crystal mushes can produce the correct crystal assemblage, but fails to provide a plausible account for the removal of metal from ureilites or for the correlation of Mg# with Delta O-17. Even if Mg# and Delta O-17 variations are established in the nebula, ureilite recrystallization with graphite must have occurred at pressures greater than the minima we have experimentally established, corresponding to parent objects not less than approximately 100 km in radius.\n\nA New Pyrometallurgical Process for Producing Antimony White from By-Product of Lead Smelting\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiu, Weifeng; Yang, Tianzu; Zhang, Duchao; Chen, Lin; Liu, Yunfeng\n\n2014-09-01\n\nAntimonial dust is a by-product of lead smelting and an important material for extracting antimony. A new pyrometallurgical process for producing antimony white from the antimonial dust is reported. The process mainly consists of three steps, which are reduction smelting, alkaline refining, and blowing oxidation. First, the reduction smelting of antimonial dust is carried out in an oxygen-rich bottom blow furnace to enrich antimony and lead in the crude alloy. The antimony and lead contents in the slag can thus be reduced to 2.8 wt.% and 0.1 wt.%, respectively. Second, the conventional method of alkaline refining is adopted to remove arsenic from the crude alloy, and arsenic content in the low-arsenic alloy could be decreased to 0.009 wt.%. Finally, the low-arsenic alloy is oxidized in a special oxidizing pan at 650Â°C by blowing compressed air or oxygen-rich air on the surface, during which qualified antimony white can be produced and collected in a bag house. The oxygen concentration and antimony content in the bottom alloy have a significant impact on production efficiency and product quality during blowing oxidation.\n\nCharacteristics of PCDD/F emissions from secondary copper smelting industry.\n\nPubMed\n\nHung, Pao Chen; Chang, Chia Chia; Chang, Shu Hao; Chang, Moo Been\n\n2015-01-01\n\nCharacteristics and mechanisms of PCDD/F formation with different feed materials in secondary copper smelting industry are investigated. The results indicate that PCDD/Fs are significantly formed even with the reaction time less than 0.1s, especially when the material containing high residues (Cu3) is fed. High copper content (65Â±2%) in the feed material enhances PCDD/F formation rate. Memory effect and de novo synthesis are two important mechanisms leading to PCDD/F formation. PCDD/F concentrations at the cyclone's inlet are between 2.92 and 12.4ng-TEQNm(-3) and increase with increasing residue content in the feed material. Two regions are identified for high potential of PCDD/F formation including the brass melt surface of the induction furnace and piping before the induced draft fan of the inlet hood. PCDD/Fs in flue gas are effectively removed with a cyclone and bag filter at low operating temperatures (<60Â°C) to meet the emission limit of 1.0ng-TEQNm(-3). 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDF has the largest mass fraction of PCDD/Fs and can serve as a fingerprint for emissions from secondary copper smelting processes. The total emission factor of PCDD/Fs from flue gas, residual and fly ash in the secondary copper smelting process investigated is 22.01Î¼g-TEQtonne(-1). Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

For this study, we sampled iron ore, cast iron furnace products, slag, soil, groundwater, streamflow, and streambed sediment to determine the fate of trace metals released into the environment during the iron-smelting process. Standard techniques were used to sample and analyze all media except cast iron. We analyzed the trace-metal content of the cast iron using a portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, which provided rapid, on-site, nondestructive analyses for 23 elements. The artifacts analyzed included eight cast iron stoves, a footed pot, and a kettle in the Hopewell Furnace museum. We measured elevated concentrations of arsenic, copper, lead, and zinc in the cast iron. Lead concentrations as great as 3,150 parts per million were measured in the stoves. Cobalt was detectable but not quantifiable because of interference with iron. Our study found that arsenic, cobalt, and lead were not released to soil or slag, which could pose a significant health risk to visitors and employees. Instead, our study demonstrates these heavy metals remained with the cast iron and were removed from the site.\n\nRock Smelting of Copper Ores with Waste Heat Recovery\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNorgate, Terry; Jahanshahi, Sharif; Haque, Nawshad\n\nIt is generally recognised that the grades of metallic ores are falling globally. This trend can be expected to increase the life cycle-based energy requirement for primary metal production due to the additional amount of material that must be handled and treated in the mining and mineral processing stages of the metal production life cycle. Rock (or whole ore) smelting has been suggested as a possible alternative processing route for low grade ores with a potentially lower energy intensity and environmental impact than traditional processing routes. In this processing route, the beneficiation stage is eliminated along with its associated energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, but this is partially offset by the need for more solid material to be handled and heated up to smelting temperatures. A life cycle assessment study was carried out to assess the potential energy and greenhouse gas benefits of a conceptual flowsheet of the rock smelting process, using copper ore as an example. Recovery and utilisation of waste heat in the slag (via dry slag granulation) and offgas streams from the smelting step was also included in the study, with the waste heat being utilised either for thermal applications or electricity generation.\n\nHeat treatment furnace\n\nDOEpatents\n\nSeals, Roland D; Parrott, Jeffrey G; DeMint, Paul D; Finney, Kevin R; Blue, Charles T\n\n2014-10-21\n\nA furnace heats through both infrared radiation and convective air utilizing an infrared/purge gas design that enables improved temperature control to enable more uniform treatment of workpieces.

Conventionally, perlite expansion is performed in vertical gas-fired furnaces; the conventional perlite expansion process has certain disadvantages which affect expanded products quality, thus limiting their performance and range of applications. In order to overcome the drawbacks of the conventional expansion technique, a new perlite expansion process has been designed based on a vertical electrical furnace (VEF). In the current study, fine perlite samples (-150 Î¼m) from Milos Island, Greece, were expansed in the novel VEF and a conventional gas-fired furnace with the aim to evaluate and compare the main physical properties of the expanded products. The novel expanded perlite particles were characterised by superior properties, namely increased compression strength, competitive water and oil absorption capability, size homogeneity, spherical shape and decreased surface porosity in comparison to conventionally expanded samples.\n\nEffect of diboron trioxide on the crushing strength and smelting mechanism of high-chromium vanadium-titanium magnetite pellets\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCheng, Gong-jin; Gao, Zi-xian; Yang, He; Xue, Xiang-xin\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe effect of diboron trioxide (B2O3) on the crushing strength and smelting mechanism of high-chromium vanadium-titanium magnetite pellets was investigated in this work. The main characterization methods were X-ray fluorescence, inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy, mercury injection porosimetry, X-ray diffraction, metallographic microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The results showed that the crushing strength increased greatly with increasing B2O3 content and that the increase in crushing strength was strongly correlated with a decrease in porosity, the formation of liquid phases, and the growth and recrystallization consolidation of hematite crystalline grains. The smelting properties were measured under simulated blast furnace conditions; the results showed that the smelting properties within a certain B2O3 content range were improved and optimized except in the softening stage. The valuable element B was easily transformed to the slag, and this phenomenon became increasingly evident with increasing B2O3 content. The formation of Ti(C,N) was mostly avoided, and the slag and melted iron were separated well during smelting with the addition of B2O3. The size increase of the melted iron was consistent with the gradual optimization of the dripping characteristics with increasing B2O3 content.\n\nWaste Heat Recovery from High Temperature Off-Gases from Electric Arc Furnace\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNimbalkar, Sachin U; Thekdi, Arvind; Keiser, James R\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis article presents a study and review of available waste heat in high temperature Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) off gases and heat recovery techniques/methods from these gases. It gives details of the quality and quantity of the sensible and chemical waste heat in typical EAF off gases, energy savings potential by recovering part of this heat, a comprehensive review of currently used waste heat recovery methods and potential for use of advanced designs to achieve a much higher level of heat recovery including scrap preheating, steam production and electric power generation. Based on our preliminary analysis, currently, for all electricmoreÂ Â» arc furnaces used in the US steel industry, the energy savings potential is equivalent to approximately 31 trillion Btu per year or 32.7 peta Joules per year (approximately $182 million US dollars/year). This article describes the EAF off-gas enthalpy model developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to calculate available and recoverable heat energy for a given stream of exhaust gases coming out of one or multiple EAF furnaces. This Excel based model calculates sensible and chemical enthalpy of the EAF off-gases during tap to tap time accounting for variation in quantity and quality of off gases. The model can be used to estimate energy saved through scrap preheating and other possible uses such as steam generation and electric power generation using off gas waste heat. This article includes a review of the historical development of existing waste heat recovery methods, their operations, and advantages/limitations of these methods. This paper also describes a program to develop and test advanced concepts for scrap preheating, steam production and electricity generation through use of waste heat recovery from the chemical and sensible heat contained in the EAF off gases with addition of minimum amount of dilution or cooling air upstream of pollution control equipment such as bag houses.Â«Â less\n\nPhase Equilibria Studies in the System ZnO-``FeO''-Al2O3-CaO-SiO2 Relevant to Imperial Smelting Furnace Slags: Part I\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhao, Baojun; Hayes, Peter C.; Jak, Evgueni\n\n2010-04-01\n\nThe phase equilibria and liquidus temperatures in the system ZnO-âFeOâ-Al2O3-CaO-SiO2 in equilibrium with metallic iron have been determined experimentally in the temperature range of 1423 K to 1553 K.

Currently, furnace blowers use either a Permanent Split Capacitor (PSC) or a Brushless Permanent Magnet (BPM) motor. Blowers account for the majority of furnace electricity consumption. Therefore, accurate determination of the blower electricity consumption is important for understanding electricity consumption of furnaces. The electricity consumption of blower motors depends on the static pressure across the blower. This paper examines both types of blower motors in non-condensing non-weatherized gas furnaces at a range of static pressures. Fan performance data is based on manufacturer product literature and laboratory tests. We use field-measured staticmoreÂ Â» pressure in ducts to get typical system curves to calculate how furnaces would operate in the field. We contrast this with the electricity consumption of a furnace blower operating under the DOE test procedure and manufacturer rated conditions. Furnace electricity use is also affected by operating modes that happen at the beginning and end of each furnace firing cycle. These operating modes are the pre-purge and post-purge by the draft inducer, the on-delay and off-delay of the blower, and the hot surface ignitor operation. To accurately calculate this effect, we use the number of firing cycles in a typical California house in the Central Valley of California. Cooling hours are not considered in the DOE test procedure. We also account for furnace blower use by the air conditioner and stand-by power. Overall BPM motors outperform PSC motors, but the total electricity savings are significantly less than projected using the DOE test procedure conditions. The performance gains depend on the static pressure of the household ducts, which are typically much higher than in the test procedures.Â«Â less\n\nPower quality analysis of DC arc furnace operation using the Bowman model for electric arc\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGherman, P. L.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThis work is about a relatively new domain. The DC electric arc is superior to the AC electric arc and itâs not used in Romania. This is why we analyzed the work functions of these furnaces by simulation and model checking of the simulation results.The conclusions are favorable, to be carried is to develop a real-time control system of steel elaboration process.\n\nFormation of the ZnFe2O4 phase in an electric arc furnace off-gas treatment system.\n\nPubMed\n\nSuetens, T; Guo, M; Van Acker, K; Blanpain, B\n\n2015-04-28\n\nTo better understand the phenomena of ZnFe2O4 spinel formation in electric arc furnace dust, the dust was characterized with particle size analysis, X-ray fluorescence (XRF), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA). Different ZnFe2O4 formation reaction extents were observed for iron oxide particles with different particle sizes. ZnO particles were present as both individual particles and aggregated on the surface of larger particles. Also, the slag particles found in the off-gas were shown not to react with the zinc vapor. After confirming the presence of a ZnFe2O4 formation reaction, the thermodynamic feasibility of in-process separation - a new electric arc furnace dust treatment technology - was reevaluated. The large air intake and the presence of iron oxide particles in the off-gas were included into the thermodynamic calculations. The formation of the stable ZnFe2O4 spinel phase was shown to be thermodynamically favorable in current electric arc furnace off-gas ducts conditions even before reaching the post combustion chamber.

This furnace uses electrical current of high frequency. The advantages of this melting method are the possibility of controlling the adequate melting temperature for a specific type of alloy, the fusion in a protective environment of rare gas and casting by associating the centrifugation with the vacuum. This leads to exact castings without any defects. The authors describe as a personal contribution an external cooling system capable of maintaining the furnace's parameters even when the water pressure is low.\n\nTube furnace\n\nDOEpatents\n\nFoster, Kenneth G.; Frohwein, Eugene J.; Taylor, Robert W.; Bowen, David W.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nA vermiculite insulated tube furnace is heated by a helically-wound resistance wire positioned within a helical groove on the surface of a ceramic cylinder, that in turn is surroundingly disposed about a doubly slotted stainless steel cylindrical liner. For uniform heating, the pitch of the helix is of shorter length over the two end portions of the ceramic cylinder. The furnace is of large volume, provides uniform temperature, offers an extremely precise programmed heating capability, features very rapid cool-down, and has a modest electrical power requirement.\n\nThermodynamic modelling of the formation of zinc-manganese ferrite spinel in electric arc furnace dust.\n\nPubMed\n\nPickles, C A\n\n2010-07-15\n\nElectric arc furnace dust is generated when automobile sc"
