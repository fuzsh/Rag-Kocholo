GUARDING THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF GREAT OCTOBER ? Forty years ,ago, by the will of the Communist Party ? led. by the great Lenin, the Armed Force's of the first Soviet country in the world were established. On 23 February the Soviet people will observe Soviet Army and. Navy Day, which has become one of the most popular and beloved holidays. The founding of the Soviet Army, Air Force and Navy was one of the conditions making for victory of the Soviet people over external and. internal counterrevolution. V. I. Lenin taught that a revolution is worth something only if it is able to defend. it- self. The Great October Socialist Revolution proved., in fact, that it could defend itself and protect its achievements. The Armed Forces carry out their task of de- fending the October achievements with dignity and honor. The Soviet Armed Forces were fostered by the Communist 'Party and by the great leader of the working people, V. I. Lenin ? the wise strategist of the Socialist Rev- olution, the founder of the Communist Party and of the Soviet State. Preparing the working class for the overthrow of autocracy, for the liquidation of the power of the landowners and the capitalists, V. I. Lenin foresaw that the exploiting classes would. not voluntarily leave the historical arena. They would resist desperately in order to prolong their supremacy. Therefore even during the period of preparation for and development of the first Russian Revolution)V. I. Lenin called the working class to arms and. to the creation of fighting detachments. V.1. Lenin taught the 'working - detachments the taCtics.and methods of street and barricade fighting; he organized their supply of arms; and. he looked after the leader Cadres. . The Red battle standard, stained with the blood of the combatants of '1905, was taken up like a relay baton and raised still higher by the fighters of the Red Guard detachments of 1917, hardened. in the 'fire of October's battles. The passing of power to. th,e hands of the Soviets did. not Mean that henceforth the Revolution would. develop Peacefully. On literally the day. after the overthrow of the Provisional Government .an armed. counterrevolutionagainst the Soviet government broke out. Kerenskiy, fleeing from Petrograd. in a motor vehicle of the .American' Embassy,' moved the Cossack 'units with Gen. Krasnov in command towards Petro- grad.. Detachments of Red Guard.s and revolutionary seamen advanced, to the front. With a violent attack the troops Of the Revolution crushed. the White Guard. regimenti,. Cupied Tsarskoye Selo and.,Gatchina, arrested. the staff of the cavalry corps ?headed by Krasnov and disarmed the Cossacks.

Editorial White Guardsmen could not stop the triumphal march of Soviet power. The armed. workers showed that they were a great force, capable of defending the achievements of the Revolution. International imperialism came to the aid of the overthrown exploiting classes of Russia. , The millionaires and billionaires of all the countries in the world could. not reconcile themselves to the victory of the proletarian revolution, a challenge to the entire capitalistic system. The country was threatened by mortal danger. In order to overcome this danger it was necessary to Create our own Soviet army, built on essentially new principles, an army whose weapons for the first time in history were used, not against the people, but for the defense of revolutionary achievements and of the freedom of the Workers; not for the seizure of foreign territory, but for the defense of our native land against imperialist invaders. \"The Declaration of the Rights of the Workingman and of the Exploited People\" written by Lenin and published on 17 (4) January 1918 proclaimed: \"In the interest of guaranteeing the absolute power of the working masses and, the elimination of any possibility of the restoration of the exploiters' power, the arming of the workers, the formation of a Socialist Red, Army of workers and peasants, and the complete disarmament of the propertied, classes are decreed.\" On 28 (15) January 1918 V.I. Lenin signed. the decree of the Council of People's Commissars on the organization of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, and on 14 (1) February the Soviet Government issued. a decree on the organization of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Navy. These historical documents formulating the Leninist principles for the building of the armed forces of a dictatorship' of the pro- letariat were the foundation of the Soviet Army and Navy. The. creation of a regular Red Army was very timely, since the Soviet Republic soon found itself in a fiery ring of fronts. For more than three years the young armed forces repulsed the onslaught of predatory imperialists and the internal coun- ter-revolution. The Soviet people experienced and. overcame severe privations and. unheard' of difficulties. Gathering together all its 'strength, the Soviet people sup- plied the Army with weapons, ammunition, and foodstuffs. ? International detachments and units, composed of revolutionarily disposed Chi- nese, Hungarian, Polish, Yugoslav, Finnish, Rumanian, German and Czechoslovak comrades, fought shoulder to shoulder with Russians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians, Latvians and,representatiVes of the other peoples of our country against the enemies of the Revolution. The source of the strength and power of the Red Army, the inspiration for its victories, was the Communist Party. Under its leadership a genuine People's Army was created? an army representing the friendship and. brotherhood of the peoples of our country, imbued. With a sense Of international duty. Displaying unprecedented. heroism, high ideals, and. devotion to the cause of socialism, the Soviet people and. its young Army routed the hordes of White Guards- men and interventionists, all armed to the teeth. During the period of peaceful socialist building, the imperialists attempted more than once t? .test the strength of our bord.ers and. always met with a decisive rebuff. ,However, they continued to nurse their bloody plans for the destruction of the Soviet Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy A proved for Release Editorial Union and in 1941 hurled, against our Motherland the striking force of imperialism -- the army of Hitlerite Germany. The Great Patriotic War of the Soviet people began. This was a severe test of the durability of the Soviet system and. of the viability of our socialist state. The Soviet Armed Forces and the entire Soviet people, girding themselves for the sacred Patriotic War, broke the back of the Fascist beast, smashed the Hitlerite armies, and. thereby showed. again the fate awaiting those who base their adventurist calculations on the fragility of the socialist system. The heroic deeds of the Soviet soldiers ancl the remarkable victories at Moscow and. Stalingrad., at Kursk and Belgorod., on the Dnepr and. the Neman, at Budapest and.Vienna, and. in the final battle of Berlin, will never fade in the memory of nations! Soviet pilots displayed great skill, courage and. heroism during the, years of the Great Patriotic War. Fighting for their beloved. Motherland., in the name of her free- dom an4 independence, day and. night they dealt crushing blows to the enemy, destroy- ing his manpower and equipment. With each day the skill of our pilots grew; ways and means for the operational and. tactical utilization of aviation were perfected.; the control of air detachments from the ground and in the air was improved.. In battles with the enemy our pilots displayed. unparalleled. valor, heroism and. courage, and commanders and chiefs exhibited ability and great skill in directing air operations. Trained by the Communist Party, our pilots and navigators, engineers and tech- nicians, and men from the various branches of the Air Force specialties honorably fulfilled their duty to the Motherland. The Soviet people will never forget the cour- age and. heroism displayed by them in the Great Patriotic War. The Soviet people and. its Armed Forces bore the main burden of WWII. The people and soldiers of Poland, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Albania and, subsequent- ly, also the armed forces of Rumania, Bulgaria, and other European' countries, cour- ageously fought side by side with the. Soviet people and its heroic Army against Fas- cism. The great Chinese people and its valiant People's Liberation Army played a large role in the utter defeat of Japanese imperialism. The organizer and inspirer of the universally significant and historic victories of the Soviet Union was the glorious Communist Party. In its severe trials the ,Party drew still closer to the people and to the masses of soldiers. The Soviet soldier considered it a great honor to go into combat as a member of the Communist Party. The constant and immediate direction by the Central 'Committee of the CPSU and by the Soviet, Government of all policy in the field of military development always has been, is, and will be the deciding factor in the might of the Armed Forces of the USSR. The Party organizations and political organs of the Soviet Army, armed. by the resolution of the October Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU, are strength- ening their influence on the entire process of forming Soviet soldiers, on the raising of the morale and political condition of the troops and of their combat preparedness. Ideological and political life in the Armed Forces has been revitalized. 'All person- nel have rallied still more closely about the Communist Party, its Central Committee and. the Soviet Government.

However, the bosses .of the imperialist camp are stubbornly pursuing a policy of ag- gravating relations among states, of further intensification of the arms race and ex- tension of aggressive blocs. As long as imperialism exists it is impossible to relax Our vigilance against the intrigues of foreign enemies; it is necessary to increase the might of the Soviet Union and its defensive capability, which is in the interest not only of the peoples of the USSR and of the socialist camp, but of all humanity. The powerful Armed Forces of the Soviet Union, always prepared for combat, are one of the means for curbing the imperialist aggressors and are the best guarantee for the preservation of world peace. The basis for the steady increase in the strength, of the Soviet Armea. Forces has been the general rise in the 'national economy of our country, and the success in the development of heavy industry, science, and technology in the post-war period.. The fortieth year of the existence of our state has been marked. by especially remarkable achievements of Soviet science and. technology. Soviet scientists, designers, engi- neers and. workers performed the greatest feat in carrying out the launching of arti- ficial earth satellites, thereby showing the entire world. of what the creative genius and. constructive labor of the people of a socialist society,' free of the fetters of capitalist oppression, is capable. The Soviet Armed. Forces, created. and trained, by the Communist Party, are at the present time stronger than they have ever been. They are capable of crushing any aggressor if he makes encroachments on our Motherland.. They now are not only completely mechanized, but have the most up-to-date arms. We have atomic and. nUclear.arms and. rockets of various ranges including intercontinental rockets. \".,.'We have launched. a satellite on the principle of an intercontinental ballistic' rocket,\" said N. S. KhrUshchev. \"...If required, we can launch more artificial satellites; we shall launch. as many as are necessary-, because for this we require nothing new in technology. \" , Our Air Force has risen to a higher stage in its development. It now has at its disposal superior jet aircraft and the latest instruments which, permit the solution of any problem, at any time of .year, day and night, and at any distance. As recently as 1957 our country's aircraft pool was reinforced by such remark- able aircraft. as the Tu-110, An-10, 11-18 and. Tu-114. The latter is the largest - passenger aircraft in the world, capable. of covering vast distances. without landing. During the .past year our aviation acquired the new Mi-6 helicopter with two turbo- prop engines. Combat aircraft created. by Soviet designers, engineers, and. workers broke the so-called. sound barrier long ago. They possess high maneuverability, powerful armament, and. first- clas s equipment. The men of the Air Force are welcoming the Fortieth Anniversary of the Armed Forces with new successes. Their combat _skill has increased.. This is encouraged. by socialist competition which embraces the men of the various' specialties. Wide- spread. preparation for elections to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR revitalized. agi- tational, propagandistic, Party and. political work; 'enlisted, aviators in the struggle for. a further increase in training, combat and political preparedness,' and for the strengthening of military discipline and. combat readiness of the units and. outfits. I e Editorial 5 \"0111111111! In the Air Force the number of rated. pilots and navigators, and of outstanding spe- cialists, outstanding crews, flights and squadrons, has increased considerably. Great success in combat and political. preparation' was achieved during the past training year by personnel of the units and outfits commanded. by N.F. Klimenko, - P. A. barmoyan, I. N. Il' in, A. P. Sitnik,ov and A. N. ProlOiorov. Among the most 'advanced was the bomber squadron commanded. by Military Pilot First Class Communist Maj. Ye.D. Bogd.anov.. The crews of this squadron success- fully carried out Many bombing missions from high altitudes, on the run, on unfamil- iar bombing ranges, day and night under adverse weather conditions. One of the best squadrons in a fighter unit was the one commanded by Military Pilot First Class Maj..V.I.Fomin, master of aerial gunnery. The squadron commanded. by Communist Maj. N. S. Gorskiy obtained, good. results in its combat and political training. Here all Communists became outstanding' men. Maj. Gorskiy, as' one of the best air squadron commander's of the group, for the con- scientious fulfillment of his military duty and. for outstanding combat and. political preparation, was awarded an Honorary diploma by a decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Karelian ASSR. The squadron commanded by Military Pilot First Class, Communist F. F. Shiba yev has been operating for twelve years without flight accidents. This has been achieved because of the untiring struggle for the exact fulfillment by the per sonn.el of the re- quirements of regulations, directions and. instructions regulating flight operations, and. because of the uncompromising attitude of the commander and the Party organiza- tion tOward. shortcomings. Engineers, technicians, and. junior Air Force specialists set an example in carrying out assigned missions. Among the outstanding men of the Air Force Engineer Serv- ice are. Air Force Engineer Service Deputy Commanders Yu. G. Mizyuk and. V. N. Pi- sarev, Regulation Inspection Service Graup Chiefs, officers LI. Pavlov and. A. F.- Svirid.ov,' TECh.{ Technical Maintenance Unit], Chief, Engineer May. S. A. Nikolayev, Radio and. Radar Equipment Engineer, officer V. Ya.Fishelev, Flight Technician V K. Kornev and others. The resolution of the October Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU .has given rise to anew surge in the activity of the entire VVS [Air Force] personnel. Political organs and Party organizations are going more.deeply into, all aspects of combat preparation, military discipline and training of personnel. On the basis. of a business-like criticism of principles, Communists boldly reveal defects in instruc- tion and. training of soldiers and. simultaneously help, com.ma.nders to take timely measures for the elimination of shortcomings which hinder an increase in the combat preparedness of the units and outfits. In the new training year aviators are confronted by the problems of further combat improvement and. the acquisition of fixed. habits in using the latest equipment with which the Air Force is outfitted. Pilots of the bomber, fighter and. other Air Force branches must perfect their habits in carrying out training and combat missions with- out simplifications, against a tactical background, and. in anticipation of heavy enemy countermeasures. It is necessary to devote the greatest attention to the study of equipment and the mastery of it. Only the pilot who is capable of carrying out combat missions in any kind of weather, day and night, can be consid.ered. thoroughly trained to defend the Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ?50-Yr 2013/10/31 : CIA-RDP81-01043R002400050010-5 Editorial -; - Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release @50-Yr 2013/10/31 : CIA-RDP81-01043R002400050010-5 Motherland.. This is achieved by intensive training on the ground and. in the air. If a pilot has sufficient and regular practice in instrument flying and systematic training in instrument landings, then he is not afraid of any weather. To be able to fly well and to have perfect mastery of the technique of piloting is still mit all. It is necessary to learn ta carry out combat missions successfully: to break through any enemy screening force, to drop bombs with accuracy on assign- ed targets and to gain victories in aerial 'combat. It is necessary for a pilot to have 'a perfect knowledge of tactics. For this purpose every flight should be saturated with tactical elements; new tactical methods should be considered beforehand and skillfully used; and the experiences of topnotch air fighters should be studied. ,Our bombers must fly for great distances', operate on Unfamiliar bombing ranges, and carry out the greater part of their practice bombings on tactical targets. It is not possible to consider a bomber crew thoroughly trained, if it cannot bomb at night or through clouds, since combat operations in modern warfare can develop at any time of the year or day. Every navigator must have a perfect mastery of naviga- tion, using for this purpose various up-to-date facilities; he must be able to approach an assigned target with accuracy at the prescribed time and to hit it precisely. Our fighters and bombers must work hard. and persistently to perfect their com- bat skill. By virtue of their function they are duty-bound to master complex pilot- ing, firing at ground and aerial targets, bombing of small-scale targets on the battle- field, and to develop various method.s employing their aircraft in combat. The engineering and technical staff is faced with a formidable and. exacting task. Engineers, technicians, and aviation specialists are obliged, to study the aviation equipment entrusted. to them, and. to reach such a state that the aircraft serviced, by them will always be ready for combat. The rear service outfits are called upon to support in full the aviation units with everything necessary; to maintain the airfields and the facilities for safeguarding training and combat activities in constant operational readiness; to raise the level of discipline, order and organization. 'Soviet soldiers are the heirs of the glorious and heroic traditions- in which the 'history of our Armed Forces abounds. To preserve and propagate these traditions and to guard. the Great October achievements vigilantly is the sacred duty of every soldier, a matter of his honor and. dignity. In response to the great faith of its people and of the great Communist Party, the personnel of the Air Force will raise the glory of our battle standards still higher. ??^????????????????????...o...?????????????#?????????14.mr as Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release Editorial .411111111?111111111.11111111111e VINArligglY 46, 74*04%//\"3, , . - Military Navigator First Class Maj .S.

LENIN ON DEVELOPING AND STRENGTHENING THE SOVIET AIR FORCE Lt. Gen. of the Air Force A. G. RYTOV The building and strengthening of the Soviet Air Force as a component part of the Armed Forces of the Soviet State are indissolubly linked with the activity of the Com- munist Party and its great leader Vladimir Il'ich Lenin. V. I. Lenin left the Soviet people and their sage director the Communist Party -- a great theoretical herit- age.

I. 4-1.1 111 7, Air Force, and Navy, the elaboration of questions pertaining to the military defense of the first socialist Fatherland in the world, and many other problems, were ob- jects of special concern to V.I. Lenin. In many of V. I. Lenin's works, in a number of his addresses at party congresses and conferences, at assemblies and meetings, in his military correspondence, and also in the practical work of directing the armed defense of the Soviet State, we see a creative application of Marxism in the military field and. a skillful implementation of the basic principles of Soviet military science and military development. On the basis of the law which he discovered concerning the unequal development of capitalism in the epoch of imperialism, V.I. Lenin came to the conclusion that it was possible for socialism to triumph first in one individual country. The old worlds warned Lenin,will not accept the triumph of the new order; the exploiting classes will make attempts to destroy the first socialist state in the world. In order to resist imperialist invasion, the state of the proletarian dictatorship Vladimirll'ich preached, must have powerful armed forces. Building the 'Army, Air Force, and Navy of the Socialist State was an extremely difficult task, not only because earlier Marxists had never really raised this question even theoretically, but also because it had to be accomplished under conditions of .extraordinarily severe fighting against foreign imperialists and a domestic counter- revolution. One of the greatest services of our own Communist Party consists in that, under these very difficult conditions of devastation, starvation, poverty, and a severe class struggle, it was able to establish the basis of a new socialist military organization; to develop the fundamental principles for building the Soviet Armed Forces, includ- ing the Air Force; and to create a Red Army, Air Force, and Navy that were capable of crushing the external and internal forces of counterrevolution. 4 14, Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? ? I. V.I. Lenin on Developing and Strengthening the Soviet Air Force Aviation long ago attracted the attention of V. I. Lenin. Many documents attest to the fact that even in the early period of aeronautical development, he manifested a very lively interest in it as a new type of engineering. Even in his work \"Imperialism As the Highest Stage of Capitalism\", Lenin called. attention to problems in the development of aeronautics and in the production of fly- ing machines in the early twentieth century, emphasizing that this field had a great future. In 1916, summing up the results of studying the highest stage of capitalism, Lenin again turned his attention to the problems of -aeronautics. In his works on the war of 1914-1918, he noted the applied, military significance of dirigibles and pointed out that one of the special features of WW I was the movement of armies \"for tens of versts at the request of fliers\". With the triumph of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the Communist Party and. V.I. Lenin personally devoted, considerable attention to solving the problems as- sociated. with establishing the Soviet Air Force. As soon as Soviet power was established, Vladimir Illich directed all the work of the Communist Party in forming an Air Force. On 28 October 1917, when the troops of Kerenskiy and. Krasnov had captured Gat- china and Tsarskoye Selo, V.I. Lenin, arriving at the headquarters of the Petrograd Military District, gave orders to form a.detachrnent of fliers immediately and to assign it to the corps airfield. Lenin's instructions were carried out. In the order of the day issued. by the command.er of the Petrograd Military District on 29 October 1917, it was stated: \"...air units are to bring all combat machines to a state of com- bat readiness. Four airplanes are to be at the corps airfield at dawn and are to await orders.\" In that same period, the first revolutionary unit of air administration -- the Bu- reau of Commissars of Aviation and. Aeronautics ? was organized under the Revo- lutionary Military Committee in Smornyy. - At the instructions of the Party's Cen- tral Committee, the Bureau immediately began to organize the defense of aviation materiel, to set up the first socialist air detachments, and to recruit for them re- liable cadres devoted to the Revolution. In December 1917, there was created. the AU-Russian Collegiurn for Administering the Air Force of the Republic. A decree of the Sovnarkom Council of Peoples Commissars] concerning the fdrMation of the Worker-Peasant Red ,Army, which was signed by V. I. Lenin, also served. as the basis for forming regular air units in Petrograd, Moscow, and other cities of Soviet Russia, despite the opposition of some old specialists who insisted. that creation of an air force was beyond the strength of the ravaged country. An important role in the work of the first air units was played by the revolution- ary military committees established by the Communist Party. They locally re- cruited flying and technical personnel for the units, protected these personnel from counterrevolution-minded officers, strengthened order and discipline, and inventoried, protected, and distributed aviation materiel. By the beginning of 1919, 61 air de- tachments had already been set up. The quantitative increase in air units and the need for better utilization of them in combat on the fronts of the Civil War necessitated improvement in the agencies of administration. In place of the All-Russian Collegium For Administering the Air Force, a Main Administration of the Worker-Peasant Air Force was organized in May. 1918 and local agencies of this Administration were set up in the districts. 50-Yr 2013/10/31: CIA-RDP81-01043R002400050010-5 1,1 9A\" Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release @ 50-Yr 2013/10/31 : CIA-RDP81-01043R002400050010-5 4 The successes of Military Pilot First Class Capt.A.

Lenin on Developing and Strengthening the Soviet Air Force 11 In that same year, a Field. Administration of Aviation and. Aeronautics of the Army in the Field (Aviadarm) was formed und.er the RVS [Revolutionary Military Council] to direct the military activity of aviation and. balloon units. There are documents attesting to the fact that V. I. Lenin devoted, great attention to the combat utilization of aircraft during the Civil War. In the spring of 1918, American and Anglo-French intervention forces landed. in the north of Soviet Russia. V.I. Lenin gave instructions that aircraft be used to help our troops in the fight against the interventionists. Although some aviation specialists thought that, inasmuch as there' were no airfields in the north,air craft could not be used, the local workers nevertheless carried out Lenin's instructions, and. the fliers began successful action against the foreign usurpers. When the situa- tion on the northern front became more serious, V. I. Lenin telegraphed M. S. Kedrov: \"You must now make up the losses, reach Kotlas, send. pilots there immediately, and organize the defense of Kotlas at all costs.\" In accordance with the instructions of the Party's Central Committee, the new air detachments were sent to the aid. of the ground units at the Civil War fronts. Thus, a detachment of. reconnaissance and. fighter aircraft was sent to aid the defenders of Tsaritsyn, and. help was given to the troops defending Astrakhan' under S. M. Kirov. On Lenin's initiative, the Sovnarkom strengthened the air units on the Eastern Front that were fighting Kolchak's army. With the active support of aircraft, the Red. Army turned, back the advance of the White Poles into the Soviet country. The Party's Central Committee sent aircraft to strengthen the troops on the Crimean front, so as to hasten the defeat of Wrangel. In 1919, the breakthrough of General Mamontov's cavalry corps into our rear at the Southern front and the general advance by Denikin posed. a serious threat to. the Red Army. V. I. Lenin considered it imperative to eliminate Mamontov's cavalry at that time, and on 28 August 1919 he wired the RVS of the Southern front: \"Extreme- ly disturbed by Mamontov's successes. He may do Us great harm by destroying roads and. storehouses\". On 4 September 1919, Lenin sent the following request.to- the Deputy Chairman of the Republic Revvoyeniovet [Revolutionary Military Council]: \"(Cavalry is powerless against a low-flying-airplane). \"... Can you not order military scientist X. Y. Z. to come up with an answer (quickly): airplanes against cavalry? Examples. Flying very low. Examples. In order to give instructions based on 'science'.. :Lenin\". At the personal behest of Lenin, a detachment of flight instructors from the Mos- Cow Flying School was sent to fight against Mamontov's cavalry, and interceptor fight- ers and heavy bombers of the \"'rya Muromets\" type were sent into the battle; 'help- ing to hasten the defeat of Mamontov's cavalry. ? Learning of the uprising in Kolchak's rear, V. I. Lenin directed. the Air Force to maintain communication with the partisans and. sent the following telegram to the RVS of the Eastern Front: \"I have learned...about the uprising in Kustanay and the advance of the insurgents against Chelyabinsk...All effort must be made to join up with them. What steps are you taking? Are you sending them an airplane? If there is no aviation fuel, we can probably get some by exerting pressure. Wire me in detail. Lenin\". In a number of memoranda and. telegrams, V. I. Lenin pointed, out the use Of 'air- craft in the fight against banditry. On 11 June 1919, he Wired. to Simbirsls: \"Pay 50-Yr 2013/10/31: CIA-RDP81-01043R002400050010-5 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release @ 50-Yr 2013/10/31 : CIA-RDP81-01043R002400050010-5 A 12 A G R toy special attention to the uprising in the Orenburg and Ural districts... consider whether the insurgents cannot be beaten by airplanes\". In 1921, Soviet pilots participated in the defeat of the counterrevolutionary bands of Malchno in the Ukraine and Antonov in the Tambov locale. During the suppression of the Kronshtadt mutiny, the Air Force flew 137 sorties in three days. IN BATTLES At Kazan' On 23 August 1918, the air forces operating near Kazan' were assigned, to bomb enemy units in the area of Uslony. It was a foul day. The gusty wind, raising clouds of dust, literally tore the little \"Nieuports\" from their parking are.as. How- ever, this did. not stop the pilots. Assigned. to bomb the enemy were group commander I. U. Pavlov and. pilot F. A. Ingaunis. After a run of no more than 30 m, the aircraft lifted, off the ground. and. quickly climbed, to an altitude of 600-800 m. The pi- lots held. two bombs in their laps. In less than an hour, Pavlov and. Ingaunis returned. De- spite the difficult conditions under which the flight was made, they had. fulfilled: their mission. During the Civil War years Ingaunis flew many such mis- sions.. - For .suceessful combat action in the area of Belgorod, he Was d.ecorated. with the Order of the Red Banner in 1919. * ? F. A. Ingaunis 4 ? In the Battles for Ufa ? Red military pilots manifested, great heroism in 1919 on the Eastern front, par- ticularly in the battles for Ufa. In the area of Ufa alone, more than fifty missions were flown. Particularly distinguishing himself was Military Pilot A. I. Tomashevskiy, who was decorated with the Order of the Red Banner for his part in this operation. During preparations for this operation, he flew reconnaissa.nce flights under severe weather conditions and. at all times of day and night over entrenched posi- tions Occupied by Kolchak's units on the other bank of the Belaya River, and. he in.- variably brought back valuable information for our command. During the forcing of the Belaya River and the storming of Ufa, Tomasheyskiy flew a large number of ? ? ? ?

Tomashevskiy V.L Lenin suggested the idea of using aircraft to distribute propaganda material in the enemy's. rear. In August .1920, the Leader of the Revolution sent the follow- ing memorandum to the RVS of the Western Front: \"It is necessary to take all pos- sible measures to distribute in Poland as extensively as possible the .manifesto of the Polish ReirkOm [Revolutionary Committee] Use our aircraft for this purpose\" Some time _later he demanded that the RVS of the Western Front\".. , increase ten- fold the propaganda from airplanes for Polish workers and Peasants, that their capit- alists are violating the peace and. condemning them to purposeless bloodshed\". The Central Committee of the Communist Party and Vladimir personally Concerned themselves untiringly with improving the status of air detachments and,. with setting up 'a Bolshevik order within them. Following is a?mernorandum from Lenin to the Revvoyensovet of the Republic On 30 January 1919. \"A group of 8 aviators in the field. army at the Tsaritsyn front, Red.

Among the orders, decrees, and regulations issued by the Sovnarkom over the 'signature. of V.I: Lenin there are documents about releasing 'resources for reconstruc- tion of aircraft plants and about the curriculum at the Moscow School of Aviation, about a plan for publishing aviation literature and about eliminating .delays in paying the workers at aircraft plants, about improving the supply .Of aviation materiel for the front. In a whole series of memoranda and. telegrams, Vladimir Il'ich?demanded that pilots; aircraft, fuel, and.. warm uniforms be sent to the front immediately. In the works of the leader and in the decisions adopted under his direction the most diverse aspects of ,building and strengthening the Air Force were touched upon. Available materials attest to his great concern for the aircraft industry. . In 1918, at the direction of the Party's Central, Committee, and the Soviet govern- ment, much was done to reestablish the aviation enterprises and. to expedite their repair and, gear them up for production of aircraft. On 17 January 1918 the SNK issued a decision with the signature of V.1. Lenin \"On the Andreyev-Lanskiy Aircraft Plant\", wherein it was stated. that, in view of the fact that the management of the Andreyev-Lanskiy Aircraft Plant had refused. to obey the government's decree, the Sovnarkom had diztr.iderl to -rnpfi gCntP the said. plant and all its appurtenances, whatsoever they may be and. to declare it the property of the Russian Republic. A decree of 28 June 1918 nationalized, all the repair and. assembly shops and. air- craft plants then in existence, and. in late 1918 a center for administering these shops and. plants (Glavkoavia [Supreme Air Force Command] ) was set up within VSNKh [Supreme Council of the National Economy]. Not only did V.I. Lenin direct the Work of the higher air institutions, but he was also closely associated with pilots. and met with the workers of aircraft enterprises. And this helped him to be always aware of the most urgent needs of the young Soviet Air Force. For example, when receiving a delegation from the \"Duks\" Aircraft Plant, V.1. Lenin questioned them in detail about their work and their difficulties and then ordered that the plant be given assistance and be allocated resources for expanding its productiO of aircraft.. He signed the statement of the Small Sovnar- kor.n of. 17 January -1921. granting credit to the Promvoyensovet [Council of War In- dustry] for reestablishing Aircraft Plant No. 6. Despite the enormous difficulties in the country, the Communist Party and the Soviet gOvernment created. all the conditions necessary for the growth of aviation science., Even during the Civil War, several teaching and scientific aviation re- search institutions were organized.. V. I. Lenin concerned himself with the prosper- ing.of aviation science and. supported. the scientists in every way, as is evidenced. by the Well-knoWn. resolution (signed. by V. I. Lenin) of the Council of Peso' pies Com- missars of 3 December 1920 which was adopted. in commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary' ofProfessor N. Ye. Zhukovskiy's .scientific activity. In this resolution it was resolved.: \"1. To relieve Professor N. Y e. Zhukovskiy from mandatory lectures, granting him the right to give courses of greater scientific importance. \"2. To give him a monthly stipend, for maintenance to the amount of one hundred, a. V.1. Lenin on Developing and Strengthening the Soviet Air Force 15 thousand. (100,000) rubles, with all subsequent wage scale increases to apply to this stipend. \"3. To establish an annual N. Ye. Zhukovskiy prize for the best work in mathe- matics and mechanics. \"4. To publish the works Of N. Ye. Zhukovskiy.\" At the direction of Lenin, TsAGI? the Central Institute of Aero-Hydrodynamics? was established. in December 1918; this was later to become a strong scientific cen- ter for modern aircraft building. After the victorious conclusion of the Civil War, peaceful construction developed throughout. the country. Restoring the national economy, the 'Communist Party did, not relax its efforts ,to Strengthen defense. A number of measures for strengthening aviation were adopted.. On 26 January 1921, the Council of Labor and. Defense ad.opted. a d.ecision to work out a program. of aircraft building. In that same year, three million rubles in gold. were allocated. kr the development of aviation, and. a plan for expanding aircraft plants was worked. out. The Tenth Party Congress in its decisions for building the army, together with other special technical units, devoted. considerable attention to strengthening the air units. The Congress defined the tasks in the development of aviation, pointing to the need for increasing the proletarian personnel in the ranks of aviation, for improving the political and combat training of airmen, for providing the units with all the things necessary for combat and. for daily life. Ln 1922 the Council of Labor arid Defense ad.opted a three-year program of ex- pansion of aircraft enterprises. It is well known that, shortly after this, Soviet designers N. N. Polikarpov, D. P. Grigorovich, and A. N. Tupolev began building the first Soviet aircraft. All this shows that the CominUnist Party and. the Soviet government created the necessary conditions for and defined the basic trends in the development of the Air Force. Concerned with aviation cadres who could be entrusted with the defense of the ? young Soviet State the Party sent CoMmuniits to flying. schools' and. to enroll in avia- tion courses. ? The First Moscow School of Aviation, the Petrograd Higher Military School, the Higher Aerophotogrammetry 'School; the Moscow Aviation Teclmicum, and, later, the Air Fleet Academy, all.trained, aviation specialists commanders, pilots, ob- servers,. and: engineering-technical personnel. Vladimir Il'ich was very 'solicitous of Air Force cadres. For example, as Chairman of the Council of Defense, on 3 May.1919 he telegraphed. the Minsk Pro- vincial Military Commissar and. the Provincial Party Commissar: \"Pilot observer Fedor Aleksandrovich Armand of the 38th Air Detachment is known to me personally and merits trust, although he is a former officer and is not a Communist. Request Red. Army comrades and commissars not to hold him in ? suspicion. \" *' Because of the great concern for aviation on the rt of e the Communist Party and. V.I. Lenin personally, aviation cadres devoted. to the Revolution were nurtured in the country; very soon in the air units there were strong Party organizationS.that united. the per sonnel of the units in the, Air Fleet around the Communist Party and..

Like the entire people, the aviators knew and. loved. Lenin. The following attesta- tion can be presented. as evidence of their ardent love for him: \"The bearer, Chairman of the Council of Peoples Commissars of the RSFSR Vladimir Inch Lenin is in fact an honorary member of the Red Fleet of the aero- nautical units of the KiyevMilitary District, as attested to by the signatories with the seal hereon affixed\". , Following Lenin's precepts, the CoMmunist Party has been and still is unremit- tingly heedful of strengthening the Soviet Armed Forces, including the Air Force. Relying on the advantages .Of the Soviet social and. state structure, the Communist Party has been a.ble.to inspire our people to a heroic struggle for the universally historic economic reformation of Russia. Carrying out the brilliant Lenin plan for industrialization of the country and, for cooperation of rural economy,. the Soviet people have been able to alter the face of their Motherland. in a very short time. History has never known such a mighty volume and. strenuous rate of development in all sectors of the national economy, particularly in heavy industry the very basis of the entire economic structure. Rapid expansion of industry, primarily of heavy industry, has been the key to socialist reformation in the country and, an important factor in the flowering of cul- ture, science, and technology. On this basis, the Armed. Forces have received new and. modern combat equipment in the necessary amounts, as well as competent persnnTiPl. Our Army, Air Force, and, Navy have been transformed into a formid- able .fl.d. invincible force that is capable of curbing any aggressor. Of particular importance for aviation has been progress in technology and avia- tion engineering thought, which were matters of constant concern to V.I. Lenin. The Communist Party has not spared resources or efforts in establishing an air- craft industry. By the tenth anniversary of October, the country had already man- aged to reestablish and expand its aircraft enterprises, and to establish scientific research centers which have greatly promoted the growth of air might. Aircraft of 'Soviet design and manufacture began to flow to the Air Force. And ten years later, our aviation ,spread wide its mighty Wings and undertook to take by storm the world records for distance, altitude, and speed of flight. By the end of 1939 the USSR took fir* place in the world in respect to the number of international air rec- ords established. Many of these records were achieved. by ordin.ar)i. series-produc- ed' aircraft. 'This served as strong evidence of the high quality of our native tech- nology, of the courage, bravery, and. masterful .skill of Soviet fliers who stand. ready at any moment to 'answer the .call of the Party and the people in defense of their Motherland.. The Great Patriotic War was a severe test for our Motherland. During the war, however, under difficult conditions the Communist Party managed to reorganize and increase the production of aircraft, supplying air units with first-class fighting machines. Also improved was the organization of the Soviet Air Force, which, like the entire Soviet Army,. came through the test of the war even more hardened, and stronger. * ,The guns of battle were still thundering at Leningrad. and Rostov-on-Don when Test Pilot 'Communist G. Ya..Bakhchivandzhi flew a fighter aircraft. with a liquid- fuel jet engine. This was the beginning of a new era .of jet aircraft. 44%4 ? ? Officer Yu. G.

Mamontov's cavalry in the area of Tambov is preparing a breakthrough on the Southern front. In order to take countermeasures and to smash Mamontov's troops, it is necessary to have precise information on their movements and. their numbers. At the disposal of the front command there is only one old \"'Voisin\" airplane; there is no fuel and., above all, there are no pilots. In the staff there is pilot I. L Petrozhitskiy, but he is wounded in the hand, he cannot use his wrist. De- spite this, the pilot requested. permission to make the re- connaissance. The plane is quickly repaired., it is fueled. with kerosene because there is no good fuel. Petrozhitskiy ties his wound- 1.1. Petrozhitskiy ed hand to the control stick and opens the throttle. After (1938 photo) several unsuccessful attempts, the plane finally takes off and climbs to an altitude .of 900 meters. More than three hours have .gone by, the fuel is low, the wounded hand aches un- bearably, and the enemy's cavalry is still not to be seen. 1314 the courageous pilot has no thought of returning until he gets the necessary information. When all hope for success was almost gone, Petrozhitskiy suddenly saw the black columns of the enemy cavalry moving to the north of him. He was barely able to count the number of the enemy when his motor died out, and the Cossacks, spying the plane, began shooting at It. With difficulty, Petrozhitskiy started the motor and flew into a cloud hanging low over the ground. A few minutes later the motor died out again. Ahead could be seen a railroad line. Gliding in that direction, the pilot landed. the plane beside a flag station. Luckily, there was a telephone there, and. he transmitted to the staff the information he had. gathered.. For this bold reconnaissance flight and. for reconnaissance he made a few days later, I. I. Petrozhitskiy was awarded. the Order of the Red Banner. V. I. Lenin on Developing the Soviet Air Force. 19 The war ended. with a universally historic victory for the Soviet, people, led. by a sage helmsman ? the Communist Party., Healing the wound.s of war in a short time, our 'people made an epic advance on the road of ?glorious victories toward the building of Communism: they are building scores of mighty hydroelectric? power stations, bla.stfurnaces, mines, factories, . and. plants; they are developii:ig, millions of hectares of virgin and. fallow lands; they are building the first atomic power sta- tion in the world; and, finally, they are launching artificial earth satellites into .space. These great landmarks of historic triumphs denote the vitality of the socialist system, its indisputable advantages over moribund. Capitalism: The postwar years in aviation have been years of unparalleled, technical progress, years of high speeds, great flying range and. altitude. New discoveries, new achieve- ments in mastering modern equipment constitute a veritable technical revolution in aviation. Our, Air Force is now equipped. with thoroughly modern jet fighters and. bombers. . The Soviet Union has intercontinental ballistic rockets and. other types of modern armament. Planes are flying ever faster, higher, and. farther.' The so-called. sound barrier has been left far behind.; jet engines have been mastered.; in immediate prospect are better aircraft and. engine designs. Inspired, by the daily concern of the Communist Party, our scientists, aircraft workers, pilots, navigators, and. aviation specialists are working resolutely of our Air Force. Following Lenin's precepts, our Party has trained. outstanding Air Force cadres who are illimitably devoted to their Motherland., the Communist Party, and. the Soviet Government. . The Party has reared a galaxy of renowned. Soviet scientists, aircraft designers, and engineers. Carrying out Lenin's behests, the Communist Party and. the Soviet people are doing everything necessary to strengthen from day to day the Air Force that is vigi- lantly guarding the peaceful creative work of the Soviet people. A profound and comprehensive study of Lenin's military legacy serves to improve . the theoretical military training of our cadres, to increase their Marxist temper. In the works of V. I. Lenin there are answer's to many questions on the character.' and purpose of the Air Force. The Leninist principles retain their validity even under present conditions. Using them as a guide, our Party is doing :Considerable work to further strengthen the Air Force, ensuring the development' of aviation at the level required. for the safety of our own socialist Fatherlan.d. toward. 4rwrvrinvinerb the combat capabilities Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release @ 50-Yr 2013/10/31 : CIA-RDP81-01043R002400050010-5 ? ? % , ^IN / ? ,P .1 . r Y) 31-.11*Alkie 'it C ? -\"\" ''\" ?.,??, ??, .??,. ? ???,. ? \" - ?

The wind, fluttered. the red. calico standard. A formation of pilots and mechanics stood at attention before two airplanes. They were all we had. left after incessant battles. In front of the formation stood. the Air Group Commissar Savin. As he spoke he beat the air violently with a tightly clenched fist: \"The international bandits are gloating maliciously. But it is still early. Our Thirteenth Army is not destroyed.. It trusts that the eagles of the proletariat ? the Red pilots ? will help it in forthcoming bloody battles. An attack on the 131..ack Baron is approaching. Death to Wrangel the hangman!\" 'With a. deft soldierly motion, the Commissar smoothed out his blouse under his belt and. continued.: \"The commanding officer and I have cOnsulted and have decided to give the best plane to the best young pilot. The commander will have little chance to fly now. We must procure new planes and must organize the work of our air detachments and bas- es located far from the main body of the group.

A sharp gust of wind came along. The thunderhead was already directly over the airfield. \"The flag to headquarters! Everybody to the planes! Make them fast! On the double', I 'yelled, and saw VasiPchenko's light and nimble figure dash to the \"Nieu- port\". A stupendous flash of lightning lit up the city, the river, the steppe, and the men standing around the planes. A clap of thunder split the heavens... This was in June 1920 when WrangePs troops had succeeded in breaking through. the front.

The offensive cost General Kutepov's corps heavily; he lost 30% of his per sonn.el in combat. Ivan Konstantinovich Spatarel' is the oldest Russian pilot. He has served in the Air Force since 1910. During. WW fl Spatarel' served. intiie. Sec.- ond Air Combat Group which was commanded by the renowned fighter pilot Yevgraf Krutent. The Great October Revolution broke out. I. K. Spatarel' was elected chairman of a soldiers' committee, and he directed all the work of?the Air Group toward supporting the Soviet regime. Soon, on orders from the Revkom [Revolution- ary Committee] of the Eleventh Army, Spatarel' in company with other pilots flew a number of liaison and agitational leaflet raid. missions. In 1918-1920, I. K. Spatarel' participated ac- tively in battles against the White Guardists. The Air Group that he commanded played a sig- nificant role in routing Wrangel.

In the daytime, two or three pi- lots flew in turns in each plane.' At night, the technicians and. mechanics patched up the shell-holes and 7-epaired the engines. The Pravoberezhnaya Army Group was confronted. with the task of not only keep- ing the Wrangelites off the right bank of the Dnepr but also of establishing a bridge- head. on the left bank for an offensive against Per ekop. At dawn on 1 July the men and officers of the 52nd and. the Latvian Divisions waded. into the still-warm Dnepr.. And when the first shots rang out, aircraft with Red. Stars appeared in the sky.

Aircraft came to the aid of our ground troops. The air was filled. with the drone of motors. The Soviet bombers had. just dropped. their bombs. The Japanese _A_A. guns were firing madly at a group of fighters following the bombers. The fighter piloted, by young Lt. Ivan Kukin was sur- rounded on all sides by flak. But Ku- kin, diving boldly on the Japanese ppsi- tions,poured over them bursts of ma- chine-...gun fire. However, there were too many emplacements. Other fight- ers came to Kukin's assistance. The attacks of the Soviet aircraft did not stop. The samurai fled. for cover in. terror. But the AA fire was still strong, and. Kukin tried a ruse. He put his plane into a spin, as though he were about to crash. Thinking that the most intrepid Soviet fighter had. been put out of action, the enemy AA ped firing. That, was all Kukin needed.

More than 70 fighter aircraft and 110 medium and .60 heavy bombers made attacks against the enemy posi- tions. Our fliers carried out their missions with honor. This is how it happened.. Returning from long-range reconnaissance, in the flats of the Dnepr near Borshaya, Lepetikha, Vasil' chenko saw a horse standing with- out a rider. ? \"Where there is a horse, there should also be .his master,\" thought the flier and reminded himself that in reconnaissance there are no insignificant de- tails. But there was only twenty minutes of fuel left. What to do? Return to, the airfield without finding out anything? No. He turned the plane back toward the flats. The twisted shrub growth and thick reeds came closer and. closer. His heart beat faster and. faster. His eyes scanned. every thicket. . From an altitud.e of 100 meters everything was as plain as the palm of one's hand.. Suddenly, there ap- peared. a whole flotilla of boats hidden behind, the reeds on a sandbar. Further up on the shore, in a clump of old. willows, was a troop of dismounted. cavalry, about 150 men. Realizing that they had. been discovered., the Whites began stirring. Turn- ing into the attack, the pilot could. see rifles aimed at him; the upraised. barrels of machine guns were gleaming. Turning his plane into the very thick of the enemy, Vasirchenko pressed. the trigger. In response, there was the-flash of a return vol- ley. He saw horses dashing around., men in green British tunics falling. After the third. low-level run, literally just above the ground., the White Guardists scattered in panic. The horses went wild with fear. Several score of the enemy had. fallen in the reed.s and in the sedge along the shore. The rest fled pell-mell in every direction. . Only then, heading for the airfield, did. Vasil' chenko notice that the plane Was not responding to the eleVators. He could see that the upper left wing was damaged.. The, engine was barely pulling on the last few drops of fuel. ? , It was learned later from a-prisoner that the detachment which was crossing at Bol' shaya Lepetikha had been designated to make a surprise foray against the Novo- Kamenskiy farms with the objective of a night. attack on the airfield.. One of the most daring airmen of the group was V. F. Vishnyakov. This is how.Vasya Vishnyakov, a pilot from the ranks Who had attended. the Sevastopol' Flying School with me in 1911,, came to fight against the White Guardists. On the World. War front he had been decorated. with two \"Georges\" for extra- ordinary valor in aerial combat. When, after the October Revolution, the old. army fell apart and. a spontaneous demobilization began, Ensign Vishnyakov returned. to his.native village. Oh,. how lovely his native Tver' soil seemed. to him after the war...Beyond. com- pare was the feeling of delight with which he greeted the morning as he walked. be- hind the plow. .How rich was the furrow of black earth turned, by the plowshare! How buoyantly and steadily the horse pulled; How wonderful all this was after the front But when the Civil War began and the Republic was inclosed. in an iron ring of interventionist.s, Vishnyakov voluntarily came to the airfield..

Vishnyakov .He came as he.. was, like a young peasant lad. .after a long journey: bareheaded., with his unbelted sateen shirt hanging out, and. barefooted.. Brand.- new boots dangled together with a small bundle from a cane over his shoulder. No One believed him when. he said he was a pilot. I winked. to Vasiliy Fedorovich, indicating my ''Nieuport\". Still' bare- foot, .he jumped right in the cockpit. When he laid. the plane on its wing right at takeoff and pulled: it up in a climbing 'spiral, every- - one gasped.. He made a couple of loops. And. then he landed. And. what a landing! It was exception-fl beautiful. ' The plane dropped smoothly, almost imperceptibly. Gently the wheels touched. the ground. And the minute the _tail skid. touched., the plane stopped. That is how Vasiliy Fedorovich came to fly in our 5th Air Detachment. It was a dark Ukrainian evening. A bonfire crackled. brightly, fed with waste oil and. old. rags. Around. it sat the pilots. The Commissar was read.- ing a letter from the Central Committee of the RKP (b) [Russian Communist Party (Bolshevik) J. His voice was fraught with emotion and. import: \"For the immediate future, the attention of the Party must be concentrated. on - the Crimean Front... It must be .explained, to every worker, every Red Army man that a victory over Poland: is impossible without a victory over Wrangel. The last bulwark of the Generals' counterrevolution must be destroyed.\" Savin smoothed out the folds of his blouse under his belt (he always repeated this gesture when deep in thought). \"Now here's what I have to say; dear comrades, Red Army piloti! We must chop at the roots of the international bandits the way Vishnyakov, VasirchenkO, and Zakharov are doing. This is how they do it,\" and the Commissar began to read reports from the infantry commanders on the results. of the fliers' actions (he travel- ed. for these reports ?to the headquarters of the Pravoberezhnaya Group). - It would be difficult to devise better combat propaganda..

Soviet troops had. gone to the aid. of the Mongolian Peoples Republic to repulse the outrageous provocation of the Japanese invaders on the Khalkhin-Gol River. Bitter battles were raging on the ground and. in the air. Col.Kutsevaloy was leading a flight of Soviet fighters to meet the enemy. Suddenly, a single enemy plane boldly darted, out at them from behind, some clouds. Kutsevalov easily sur- mised. the cunning of the samurai? to break up the formation of Soviet fighters and. then attack them with a whole group ? and. quietly gave the command. to a few pilots to destroy the solitary enemy plane. Bursts of machine-gun fire raked. the hostile scout plane. Smoking, it crashed. to earth. And. in less than a minute, as Kutse- valov had. guessed, two flights of planes appeared simultaneously above and below. But the samurai had. made a grave miscalculation. The top group was already late, and its attack aborted. An aerial dogfight began with the bottom group. The battle ,was fought at an altitude of three to four thousand meters. With an unbearably bright sun in the sky, the fighters could not be seen. Only the roar of climbing and diving planes could be heard. The results of this encounter could be judged only by t4i.e number of falling machines. Thirty minutes of tense fighting ende,d. in victory; 16 of the enemy planes were shot down. The rest fled in disorder from the field of battle. The Japanese pilots that were taken prisoner that day said in their interroga- tion that their best:pilots had. perished in this battler. * ,* A Second. Gold Star G. P. Kravchenko (right) and S. I.

The ?4 4 Pravoberezkmaya air forces were reinforced by the ? 49th Air Reconnaissance Detachment, whose planes ? and. experienced. pilots lead. by Detachment Command- er, Polyakov increased the combat capability of the group considerably. On each mission the fighter pilots carried' 2-4 ten-pound. bombs._ From low, altitudes they .. strafed. the enemy with machine guns.. Every day there were air battles, especially violent ones in the area of the, ApostolOvo Station-- the central supply base for the troops on the right bank. Fly- ing patrol above the station and the probable routes of the White Guardist planes, our pilots drove off, the enemy in the air with bold attacks, protecting the troops and. the railroad trains. In early August the Red. Army began an ad.- I. T. Dat sko after graduation vance along the entire Polish front. The final pre- from the Moscow Flying School parations for an advance against Wrangel were also in 1920. being completed.. By that time the Air Group al- ready had seven \"Nieuports\", two \"Spad.s\", and. a two-place reconnaissance plane. They were making a continua), and. thorough re- connaissance of the left bank of the Dnepr. On 5 August the commanding officer of the 52nd Infantry Division went up as an observer with veteran pilot Kish. This di- vision was to be the first to start the new attack. The commanding officer went up to stud.y the approaches and. the enemy's firing poeitions and. defensive lines. During the night of 6-7 August the ground. troops began forcingtheDnepr. As was to be expected., they met with stubborn resistance on the part of the White Guardists. All the planes were in the air. From morning Until evening the pilots were mak- ing reconnaissance flights. Completing their missions, they would. land at Beris- lay where the .headquarters of the Pravoberezhnaya Army Group was located and, re- ported, per sonally to the commanding officer On the results of their reconnaissance.' Continual patrolling by our fighters prevented: the White Guardist planes from penetrating through to Berisla.v or Kakhovka. Even on 7 August. at the very peak of the battle, the hostile pilots were unable to drop ,a single boinb on the advancing units of the Red. Army. During the night' of 7-8 August, I received ord.ers to mOye the. Aiy group to Beris- lay, closer to head.quarters and. the battle area.. - The first to chalk-up a score from the new airfield was Vasirch.enko, who forced a hostile battery to stop firing. The enemy barely managed. to pull. .two other guns out of their positions to Bolt shiye Mayachki. In addition, Vasil' cheriko dispersed. a cavalry troop. An unexpeCted. rainstorm came up in the evening. The wind velocj.ty at ground. level was. 25 meters' per second.; violent gusts raised. sand.spouts of river sa.nd. and, tore the thatched. roofs off huts. At that very moment, in the dark sky appeared.. the plane piloted. by Vasilichenko who was returning from his third, flight of that day.

K Spatarer His \"Nieuport\" was being tossed around like a sliver of wood. It was impossible for him to come in for a landing. \"Now what in the world is this,\" Savin repeated several times, not taking his eyes off the plane which was battling against the storm. Every one thought the, \"Nieu- port\" would be dashed to the ground and nothing would be left of it. But suddenly, inexplicably, almost right, out of a turn, the plane dove down and touched the ground. Ivan Datsko ancl. the Commissar dashed toward it, the others' after them. They grabbed the wings, the tail, and held the machine., Out of it climbed. Vasil'thenko, smiling sheepishly. Never, as long as I live, will I forget that amazing landing: The headlong advance of the ,Red divisions toward Perelcp alarmed the enemy and he decided to move armored cars and Gen. Barbovich's mounted corps into the Ka khovka area. During the night of 9-10 August this corps withdrew in deep secrecy from the front at Bol'Shoy Tokmak and. moved. by forced march to the rear of the advancing Red. reg- iments. And who knows what turn the events at Kakhovka would have taken had. it not been for the Red air forte? On the morning of 10 August Pilot Krekis and. Air Observer Zolotov of the Central Air Group discovered. in the Veseloye-Deka area a column 20 km long ? cavalry? with artillery and. combat trains. Within an hour, the commander of the Thirteenth Army knew of this. On 11 and. 12 August Vasil'chenko and. Zakharov mad.e reconnaissance flights on my orders. They fully confirmed, the reports from the pilots of the Central Air Group, showing, that the columns were moving by field. and country roads rather than by the main roads. In addition, they established that the main enemy for locat- ed.in the village of Antonovka, had. up to 10 artillery batteries, up to 2000 sabers, and 4000 infantrymen in vehicles. Thus, the appearance of Ba.rbovich's corps was not a, surprise to us.. ? The engagement at Kakhovka assumed great proportions and therefore the Central Air Group, under the command of I. U. Pavlov, was also thrown into the battle for the bridgehead. The planes of this group occupied our old airfield at the Novo- Ka.menskiy farms. .... Over, the pontoon bridge across the Dnepr stretched. a long column of our troops moving off toward Kakhovka. Cannon fire could be ,heard from that direction. A messenger ran up to Me. \"Comrade Commander; They telephoned. from The observation post that White planes are coming!\" I saw Commissar Savin. skillfully adjusting a machine gun for shooting upward. There were no planes to send against the Wrangelites. Of the three in working or-, der, two were out on reconnaissance in the enemy's rear, the third had just returned and was not yet ready for 'takeoff., There they were!' Clearly visible in the sky were seven White Guardist \"de Havilland.s\". They were flying in formation, Ever louder sounded the character- istic monotonous drOne of their stationary engines, the sound of which was so dif- ferent from the murmur of the rotary \"Rhones\" installed in the older \"Nieuports\". There was a congestion at the crossing. The bridge was jammed with Red Army men... The seven enemy planes went into their bombing run at an altitude of 800 meters.

I N BATTLES Life is an Exploit \"As long as I have a heart, a voice, eyes, hands, I can be useful; I want to serve you, my own Soviet people...\" So spoke Hero of the Soviet Union Mili- tary Fighter Pilot Leonid Georgiyevich Be- lousov, once addressing the students at the Baltic Naval School. Belousov's entire life has been. one of self-sacrificing and. unselfish service to the Motherland. On a stormy wintry night in 1938 at one of the border airfields, the young pilot Belousov, returning to his home field after pursuing a plane that had violat- ed the border, suffered an accident on land- ing. The plane caught fire from a gasoline tank that exploded.. Very severe burns on the face, the arms, and. the legs had, it seemed, put this flier out of commission for good.. But this was not the case. When the action against the White Finns began, the still convalescent Belousov could be seen in a squadron of fighters at Leningrad., a number of important missions. Came the war against the German fascists. L G.

It was the winter of 1942. Guards Major L. G. Belousov was the deputy command- er of a fighter regiment on the Leningrad front, at Ladoga. This regiment was soon designated a Guards regiment. One time, on a long flight, Belousov froze his legs ?.which were once severely burned? and gangrene soon set in. But this uncommonly courageous man, even under the surgeon's knife, even after both his legs had. been cut off, dreamed of on- ly one thing: to fly again without fail!

I. Their target was the river crossing. The confluent drone of their engines -filled. the air. . They were about to drop their bombs: Suddenly I saw a small \"Nieuport - 17\" diving from above like a hawk on the leading \"Havilland.\". The, hollow sound. of machine-gun' fire could be heard.. It was Vasil'cheriko who had returned from re- connaissance. . . The plane under attack dove in ,a bank.- His wingmen scattered. One to the left, the other to the right. The rest dispersed. The group of aircraft, a moment. ago flying in combat formation, had, been broken up. . Over the thousand.s of fighting men on the Kakhovka bridgeead, over the re si- dents of Berislav, over the headquarters of the troops in the/line ,of advance on the right bank there developed, an unforgettable picture of an unequal air battle. On one side, seven new, two-place English planes with 14 machine guns, on the other, an old. \"Nieuport\" with a single machine gun.. Vasilichenko pursued. the leading enemy plane. The observer on the \"d.e Havil- land\", wounded or dead., hung like -a sack from his safety belt. Enjoying an ad.- vantage in speed., the pilot tried, to elude the attack. Coming to their senses, the other White pilots hurried, to the aid. of their commander, and. suddenly three of them attacked. Vasiltchenko's plane from the above rear. Throwing his macHnp into a steep combat turn, Vasilichenko went over to the attack himself. A short burst of machine-gun fire could be heard.. One of the three Wrangelite planes fell sharply. Losing altitude, he glided. toward. his own territory and fell beyond. Bol' shaya Kakhovka. The second. of this trio, declining battle, also head.ed. for home at top speed.. At that moment the commander of the White Guardist group unexpectedly attacked. Vasir,chenko from the side. Vasirchenko threw his \"Nieuport\" into a spin. The enemy pilot in his heavier plane simply could not get him in the crosshairs of his sight. Suddenly, intent on pursuit, the Wrangelite found himself below Vasil'chen- ko. An instantaneous recovery from the spin ? and then a dive on the enemy. The two tangling planes, joined,- in mortal combat, rolled around the sky. Meanwhile the four remaining White Guard: planes dropped. their bombs pell-mell in the Dnepr 'and. fled.. Vasil'chenko's battle.with'the commander of the Wrangelite air group continued. for more than 25 minutes. Finally, coming out of a turn on the tail of the \"d.e.'Havil- land.\", Vasilichenko at almost point-blank range. gave him his last burst. ? 'Hi am- munition was all gone. The enemy plane first nosed up unnaturally, and. then, with a sharp drop, turned toward. its own lines trailing a plume of smoke. ?Vasilichen- ko hovered, over it, following' it until it fell to the ground.. Unfortunately, that was already behind, the front lines. At an altitude of 100 meters, Vasilichenko's \"Nieuport\" flew over the crossing, on its way home. And then, after- the/nervous tension they had. gone through and. after the anxiety for the life. of the daring pilot, everyone who had. watched. this air battle was gripped by a feeling of utter delight. Excited, still heated from the fray, Nikolay VasiPchenko,walked. rapidly toward me. His helmet was shoved, back on his head.. . His eyes were ablaze. \"Comrad.e Commander.... , \"he began,. throwing up his hand. in 'a salute. \"Oh, my d.ear Vasilek:\" I interrupted him and, words failing me, embraced, and, kissed. him. 4 A ainst the Black Baron 31 The commanding officer of the Pravoberezhnaya Army Group arrived and. warmly gripped. Vasilichenko's hand.. The result of this brilliant air battle was that the Kakhovka crossing was saved.. For this battle, Nikolay Nikolayevich Vasil'chenko was recommended for a Golden Arms award.. The example of daring displayed. by this pilot was deeply ,imprintecl in the Memory of the men at the bridgehead.. Only half a year had. passed, since Nikolay Vasirchenko arrived from school, but his chest was already decorated with two Orders of the Red Banner., The first was for an aerial photoreconnaissance of Perekop,. and the Second for intrepid air battles. Half a year at the front is a good. deal. Some peaceful person in ten years of life will not learn, will not experience as much as can be gained, from a few months of hot fighting. , Wrangel understood. very, well the danger in the Kakhovka dagger.. 'And a dagger it was, directed. at his back. Whatever action he might take on other fronts,. he could not forget Kakhovka. On 12 August two White corps, supported. by air units, began storming the tokid.ge- head.. Groups of enemy planes flew over the area where our troops were located. several times a day, but they were rarely able to drop their bombs on their objec- tives. Warned, from observation posts, I scrambled. the planes that were on duty, and..they managed. to intercept the enemy. There was not a single instance of the Wrangelites carrying out their mission when our fighters were in the air. ...It was about 8 o'clock in the morning; most of our planes had. just landed. after completing their first sortie and. the others had. gone out on missions. The mechan- ics were tinkering with the engines of the planes that had. returned.. The pilots had. gone to the mess hall for breakfast. We had, just sat down at the table, when the distant drone of a \"Havilland\" was heard.. Everyone ran outsid.e where the trucks were standing. Before we could blink an eye, the Commissar had. already set up a light machine gun.. ..But he had. no chance to fire: the plane was flying at an altitude of 1200 m and a machine gun couldn't reach it. From then on everything happened at once. The .Wrangelite plane appeared in a break in the clouds. Then Came the whistle of a bomb. An explosion: The hot breath of the explosion hit me in the face and. I was thrown back by-the blast wave. Savin fell with his machine gun. Datsko collapsed as though cut down. When I came to, my first thought was of Savin. ? I bent over him. ? My dear Commissar: He ,still lay there with the .machine gun cradled. in his arms. I picked. him up and. carried, him inside... In the evening' of that same d.a.y, two enemy planes, taking advantage Of the cloudy' weather and undetected by the observers, crossed the front line and reaching Beris- lay,. began searching for a break in the clouds to bomb the airfield. Yakov Gulyayev was in the air at that time. Spying the \"de' Havilland.s\", he head- ed directly toward them. His \"Nieuport\" dove under the cloud base. \"I must come out right behind the enemy planes,\" decided Gulyayev, \"no 'sooner, no later; other- wise they will get away.\" The seccnds of waiting were agonizing.

Heavy leaden cloud.s covered, the sky. It was snowing. A squadron of heavy bombers under the command. of Vasiliy Ivan- ovich Rakov was flying on a combat mission. The Soviet bombers were to destroy an important enemy target d.eep in the enemy rear. The clouds kept the heavily loaded, bombers close to the sea. Flying a strict formation, the squadron hedge-hopped. for scores of kilometers, and. then, when breaks appeared. in the clouds, Rakov led. the aircraft to an altitud.e of 400-500 m. But this was not without danger; the enemy's AA artillery was always on the alert. Maj. Rakov employed a Stratagem. About thirty kilometers from the target, the squadron suddenly turned, aside. Having become accustomed. to air raids from the direction of the front, the White Finns were deceived.. The Soviet bombers came up from the rear. The enemy artillerymen gathered. their wits only after the air- craft had appeared. over the target and had dropped. their bombs on hangars, ware- houses, and other airfield installations. . Maj.'Ra*ov's. squadron Made many combat sorties. And. each of them waa a shattering .blow because of the commander's ability to feel out the enemy's' weak point. The command rated highly this quality of Vasiliy Ivanovich Rakov in the struggle against the White Finns. He was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. The Crew of Niko' lay Stollnikov's Plane Pilot Nikolay Stol'nikov received. his baptism of fire in the cold winter of 1939- 1940.. On 17 February 1940, Stolinikov's bomber was attacked by enemy fighters when it neared. the target. The blow was strong and. violent. The left engine was put out of commission. However; this d.id not frighten the determined pilot. He flew his plane on one engine and, shot down'one fighter. Stol'nikov had. barely managed. to drop his bombs successfully on the enemy's d:efensive fortifications when suddenly five more fighters attacked. the bomber. In the unequal battle, the crew fought manfully and. bravely. The rad.io gunner A ? ? ? ? A ainst the Black Baron was wounded three times, but despite that he kept on firing accurately and. shot down two more fighters. But the ammunition, ran out. The navigator was wounded. The other engine began to smoke. Saving his crew, Stol'nikov skillfully glided, down . and landed the plane on the ice of a lake within enemy territory. Taking everything they needed out of the plane, Stol'nikov and his navigator carried the radio man out and. dug in to fight it out. Fortunately, the fight did. not last long. Our fighters appeared overhead. They quickly found the place where the bomber had made its forced. landing and managed to take Stol'nikov and his comrades out to friendly territory. Nikolay Maksimovich Stol'nikov was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. N. M. Stol'nikov 33 Intent on finding a break in the clouds convenient for bombing, the Whites, sus- pecting nothing, flew along on a left bearing.

Frozen in terror, the face of the observer in the second plane stared. at Gulyayev. And. at that very sec- ond., Gulyayev opened.-fire again. The \"Ha.vil- land\" passed, through a thin wisp of cloud., the -\"Nieuport\" 'right behind. it. Recovering ,from the shock, the Wrangelit.e observer fired his machine gun.

Satisfied with the result of this air battle, Gulyayev approached, Kakho'vka at tree- top level. The Red Army men waved at him their helmets perched on the bayonets of their rifles. After it landed, several holes were found in the plane. The pilot's arm had only been creasecl by a bullet. , I ...We were sitting at the airfield.. Some of tl?.e battle we had seen from the ground, the rest Gulyayev had just described. Of short Stature, he seemed small when sit- ting, as he .was now, hunched, over, swinging his lap board between his legs. \"Well, I have just paid them back a little for the Commissar,\" he said, \"but the main settlement is still to come at Perekop.\" And still under the influence of the battle he had just gone through and the bitter news of Savin's death, Yakov Yakovlevich suddenly continued.: \"Well, Comrade Lenin warned that it would be this way.\" \"How?\" asked. VasiPchenko, surprised at the turn in the conversation. \"Like this,\" said. GulyayeV, his large eyes flashing. \"Once you start an offen- sive against the enemy, don't falter, keep on going, fight to the finish, never mind the difficulties.\" \"Yakov Yakovlevich, you talk as though you had seen Irich [Lenin] yourself,\" remarked one of the pilots. \"Is that really true?\" \"True,\" said Gulyayev quietly. \"I had the great fortune to hear Comrade Lenin.\" The men crowded closer around. Gulyayev. Had. he, our Yasha, really seen Lenin? \"Tell us about it, Yakov Yakovlevich, \" I begged.. Yasha cleared his throat and, began: \"This happened, I remember well, before the July demonstration massacre in Petrograd.. You knOw, I was a mechanic at the Gatchina Flying School. Well, a group Of sailors came to the school., 'We are a delegation, they said, 'from the Baltic. We are going to see ll'ich. But we, haven't eaten a thins for two days.

We fed, our buddies a triple portion of millet porridge with butter, and I went with them. ? \"We went to Piter [ St. Petersburg] by train. Then straight to Kshesinskaya.'s Palace, to the Bolsheviks.\" Gulyayev's voice was agitated. He had never talked so much. Everyone was silent; dozens of eyes were watching him attentively. \"At the Palace a guard stood at the door. The senior sailor showed him his credentials. We went in. We were directed immediately to a large room with green walls. Many people were there. An enormous chandelier hung overhead. Here a:thought struck me: All these are sailors, I am the only, one in a grey coat. What if Comrade Lenin asks. suddenly: 'And by what authority are you here?'
