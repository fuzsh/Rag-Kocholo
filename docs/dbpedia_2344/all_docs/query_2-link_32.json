Due to weight restrictions, only small weapons could be carried on board. Intrepid pilots decided to interfere with enemy reconnaissance by improvised means, including throwing bricks, grenades and sometimes rope, which they hoped would entangle the enemy plane's propeller. The first dogfight is believed to have taken place on 28 August 1914, when Norman Spratt, flying an unarmed Sopwith Tabloid,[7] forced down a German Albatros C.I two-seater. Pilots then began firing hand-held guns at enemy planes, such as pistols and carbines. In August 1914, Staff- Captain Pyotr Nesterov, from Russia, became the first pilot to ram his plane into an enemy spotter aircraft. In October 1914, an airplane was shot down by a hand gun from another plane for the first time over Rheims, France. Once machine guns were mounted to the plane, either on a flexible mounting or higher on the wings of early biplanes, the era of air combat began. The biggest problem was mounting a machine gun onto an aircraft so that it could be fired forward, through the propeller, and aimed by pointing the nose of the aircraft directly at the enemy. Roland Garros solved this problem by mounting steel deflector wedges to the propeller of a Morane Saulnier monoplane. He achieved three kills, but was shot down behind enemy lines, and captured before he could destroy his plane by burning it. The wreckage was brought to Anthony Fokker, a Dutch designer who built aircraft for the Germans. Fokker decided that the wedges were much too risky, and improved the design by connecting the trigger of an MG 08 Maxim machine gun to the timing of the engine.[8][9] The Germans acquired an early air superiority due to the invention of the synchronization gear in 1915, transforming air combat with the Fokker E.I, the first synchronized, forward firing fighter plane.[8][9] On the evening of July 1, 1915, the very first aerial engagement by a fighter plane armed with a synchronized, forward-firing machine gun occurred just to the east of Luneville, France. The German Fokker E.I was flown by Lieutenant Kurt Wintgens, earning the victory over a French two-seat observation monoplane. Later that same month, on July 25, 1915, British Royal Flying Corps (RFC) Major Lanoe Hawker, flying a very early production Bristol Scout C., attacked three separate aircraft during a single sortie, shooting down two with a non-synchronizable Lewis gun which was mounted next to his cockpit at an outwards angle to avoid hitting the propeller.

The Feldflieger Abteilung observation units of the German air service, in 1914-15, consisted of six two-seat observation aircraft each, with each unit assigned to a particular German Army headquarters location. They had but a single Fokker Eindecker aircraft assigned to each \"FFA\" unit for general defensive duties, so pilots such as Max Immelmann and Oswald Boelcke began as lone hunters with each \"FFA\" unit, shooting unarmed spotter planes and enemy aircraft out of the sky.[9] During the first part of the war, there was no established tactical doctrine for air-to- air combat. Oswald Boelcke was the first to analyze the tactics of aerial warfare, resulting in a set of rules known as the Dicta Boelcke. Many of Boelcke's concepts, conceived in 1916, are still applicable today, including use of sun and altitude, surprise attack, and turning to meet a threat. British Brigadier General Hugh Trenchard ordered that all reconnaissance aircraft had to be supported by at least three fighters, creating the first use of tactical formations in the air. The Germans responded by forming Jastas, large squadrons of fighters solely dedicated to destroying enemy aircraft, under the supervision of Boelcke. Pilots who shot down five or more fighters became known as aces. One of the most famous dogfights, resulting in the death of Major Hawker, is described by the Red Baron, Manfred von Richthofen, World War I (continue) SOLO\n\n17. 17 Name Country Air service(s) Victories Notes von Richthofen, Manfred† Germany Luftstreitkräfte 80[25] The Red Baron PLM plus 22 other awards Fonck, René France Aéronautique Militaire 75[26] Top Allied and French ace CdeLd'h, MM(Fr), CdeG, BCdeG, MC, MM Bishop, Billy Canada Royal Flying Corps, Royal Air Force 72[27][a] Top Canadian ace VC, DSO, MC, DFC, CdeLd'h, CdeG Udet, Ernst Germany Luftstreitkräfte 62[25] PLM, HOH, IC Mannock, Edward† United Kingdom Royal Flying Corps, Royal Air Force 73 Top British ace VC, DSO**, MC* Collishaw, Raymond Canada Royal Naval Air Service, Royal Air Force 60[28] Top Royal Naval Air Service ace DSO*, DSC, DFC, OSA, CdeG McCudden, James† United Kingdom Royal Flying Corps, Royal Air Force 57[27] VC, DSO*, MC*, MM, CdeG Beauchamp-Proctor, Andrew South Africa Royal Flying Corps, Royal Air Force 54[27] Top South African ace VC, DSO, MC*, DFC Löwenhardt, Erich† Germany Luftstreitkräfte 54[25] PLM, IC MacLaren, Donald Canada Royal Flying Corps, Royal Air Force 54[27] DSO, MC*, CdeLd'h, CdeG Guynemer, Georges† France Aéronautique Militaire 53[29] CdeLd'h, MM(Fr), CdeG, DSO, OLII Barker, William George Canada Royal Flying Corps, Royal Air Force 50[27] VC, DSO*, MC**, MMV*(Silver), CdeG Jacobs, Josef Germany Luftstreitkräfte 48[25] PLM, IC Voss, Werner† Germany Luftstreitkräfte 48[25] PLM, HOH, IC Little, Robert A.† Australia Royal Naval Air Service, Royal Air Force 47[27] Top Australian ace DSO*, DSC*, CdeG McElroy, George† United Kingdom Royal Flying Corps, Royal Air Force 47[30] MC**, DFC* Dallas, Roderic† Australia Royal Naval Air Service, Royal Air Force 45[31] DSO, DSC* Rumey, Fritz† Germany Luftstreitkräfte 45[25] PLM, IC Ball, Albert† United Kingdom Royal Flying Corps 44[32][27] VC, DSO**, MC, OSG Berthold, Rudolph Germany Luftstreitkräfte 44[25] PLM, MOSH, IC Loerzer, Bruno Germany Luftstreitkräfte 44[25] PLM, HOH, IC Bäumer, Paul Germany Luftstreitkräfte 43[25] PLM, MMC(P), IC, WB Partial List of World War I Aces Credited with 20 or More VictoriesSOLO\n\n18. 18 WWI Aces (1914 – 1918) Nieuport 17 Biplane fighter Synchronised Vickers Gun Fokker DR1 Triplane 2 × 7.92 mm (.312 in) \"Spandau\" lMG 08 machine guns Manfred von Richthofen Red Baron (1892 –1918) Luftstreitkräfte 80 Confirmed Victories William Avery \"Billy\" Bishop (1894- 1956) Royal Air Force 72 Confirmed Victories Rene Fonck (1983 – 1953) French Air Force 75 confirmed Victories SPAD S.VII Biplane SOLO\n\n19. 19 General characteristics •Crew: One •Length: 5.77 m (18 ft 11 in) •Wingspan: 7.20 m (23 ft 7 in) •Height: 2.95 m (9 ft 8 in) •Wing area: 18.70 m² (201 ft²) •Empty weight: 406 kg (895 lb) •Loaded weight: 586 kg (1,292 lb) •Powerplant: 1 × Oberursel Ur.II 9-cylinder rotary engine, 82 kW (110 hp) •Zero-lift drag coefficient: 0.0323 •Drag area: 0.62 m² (6.69 ft²) •Aspect ratio: 4.04 Performance •Maximum speed: 185 km/h at sea level (115 mph at sea level) •Stall speed: 72 km/h (45 mph) •Range: 300 km (185 mi) •Service ceiling: 6,095 m (20,000 ft) •Rate of climb: 5.7 m/s (1,130 ft/min) •Lift-to-drag ratio: 8.0 Armament •2 × 7.92 mm (.312 in) \"Spandau\" lMG 08 machine guns Role Fighter Manufacturer Fokker-Flugzeugwerke Designer Reinhold Platz First flight 5 July 1917 Primary user Luftstreitkräfte Number built 320 Fokker Dr.I , Dreidecker (triplane) WWI FightersSOLO\n\n20. 20 General characteristics •Crew: one •Length: 5.80 m (19 ft 0 in) •Wingspan: 8.16 m (26 ft 9 in) •Height: 2.40 m (7 ft 10 in) •Wing area: 14.75 m² (158.8 ft²) •Empty weight: 375 kg (825 lb) •Loaded weight: 560 kg (1,232 lb) •Powerplant: 1 × Le Rhône 9Ja 9-cylinder rotary engine, 82 kW (110 hp) Performance •Maximum speed: 177 km/h [4] (96 kn, 110 mph) at 2000m •Endurance: 1.75 hours •Service ceiling: 5,300 m (17,390 ft) •Rate of climb: 11.5 min to 3,000 m (9,840 ft) () •Wing loading: 37.9 kg/m² (7.77 lb/ft²) •Power/mass: 0.15 kW/kg (0.09 hp/lb) Armament Guns: •(French service) 1 × synchronised Vickers machine gun •(British service) 1 × Lewis gun on Foster mounting on upper wing •Rockets: 8 Le Prieur rockets Role Fighter Manufacturer Nieuport First flight January 1916 Introduction March 1916 Primary user Aéronautique Militaire Variants Nieuport 23 Nieuport 17 WWI Fighter SOLO Return to Table of Content\n\n21. 21 Airplane technology rapidly increased in sophistication after World War I. By 1936, dogfighting was thought to be a thing of the past, since aircraft were reaching top speeds of over 250 miles per hour (400 km/h).[11] This was proved wrong during the Spanish civil war, as quoted by the U.S. Attaché in 1937, “The peacetime theory of the complete invulnerability of the modern type of bombardment airplane no longer holds. The increased speeds of both the bombardment and pursuit plane have worked in favor of the pursuit … The flying fortress died in Spain.” Large scale bombing of the civilian population, thought to be demoralizing to the enemy and impossible to stop (\"The bomber will always get through\"), proved to have the opposite effect. Dr. E. B. Strauss surmised, “Observers state that one of the most remarkable effects of the bombing of open towns in Government Spain had been the welding together into a formidable fighting force of groups of political factions who were previously at each others throats…”, to which Hitler’s Luftwaffe, supporting the Spanish Nationalists, generally agreed. At the beginning of the war, new tactics were developed, most notably by Luftwaffe Condor Legion Lieutenant Werner Mölders. He advised abandoning the standard “V” formation used in combat, and grouping fighters in pairs, starting the practice of having a wingman at one's side. He advised that pairs of aircraft approaching a fight should increase the distance between them instead of holding tight formations, which became a precursor to the combat spread maneuver. He also started the practice of training pilots to fly at night, and with instruments only. Using the new tactics, and flying the newest Messerschmitt Bf-109 fighters, the Germans shot down 22 Spanish Republican fighters within a five day period, suffering no losses of their own.

The objective of the campaign was to gain air superiority over the Royal Air Force (RAF), especially Fighter Command. The name derives from a famous speech delivered by Prime Minister Winston Churchill in the House of Commons: \"…the Battle of France is over.

In most circumstances, RDF could pick up formations of Luftwaffe aircraft as they organised over their own airfields. Once the raiding aircraft moved inland over England, the formations were also plotted by the Observer Corps. The information from RDF and the Observer Corps were sent through to the main operations room of Fighter Command Headquarters at Bentley Priory. The plots were assessed to determine whether they were \"hostile\" or \"friendly\". If hostile, the information was sent to the main \"operations room\", which was in a large underground bunker. Here the course information of each raid was plotted by WAAFs who received information by a telephone system. Additional intelligence was provided by the \"Y\" Service radio posts, which monitored enemy radio transmissions, and the \"Ultra\" decoding centre based at Bletchley Park. Colour coded counters representing each raid were placed on a large table, which had a map of Britain overlaid and squared off with a British Modified Grid. The colour of counter to use for a new sighting was determined by the time of the sighting, the proper colour being indicated by the minute hand of the sector clock. As the plots of the raiding aircraft moved, the counters were pushed across the map by magnetic \"rakes\".

The Bf 109E had a better climb rate and was 10–30 mph (16–48 km/h) faster than the Hurricane Mk I, depending on altitude.[43] In spring and summer 1940, RAF fighters benefited from increased availability of 100 octane aviation fuel, which allowed their Merlin engines to generate significantly more power through the use of an Emergency Boost Override. In September 1940, the more powerful Mk IIa series 1 Hurricanes started entering service in small numbers. This version was capable of a maximum speed of 342 mph (550 km/h), some 25–30 mph (40–48 km/h) more than the Mk Messerschmitt Bf 109 Messerschmitt Bf 110 Hawker Hurricane Mk1 Supermarine Spitfire SOLO\n\n28. 28 World War II Phases of the battle The Battle can be roughly divided into four phases: • 10 July – 11 August: Kanalkampf, (\"the Channel battles\"). • 12 – 23 August: Adlerangriff (\"Eagle Attack\"), the early assault against the coastal airfields. • 24 August – 6 September: the Luftwaffe targets the airfields.

The Japanese used the Mitsubishi A6M Zero, an extremely lightweight fighter known for its exceptional range and maneuverability. [20] The U.S. military tested out the Akutan Zero, an A6M2 which was captured intact in 1942, advising \"Never attempt to dogfight a Zero.\" Even though its engine was rather low in power, the Zero had very low wing loading characteristics, a small turn radius, a top speed over 330 MPH, and could climb better than any fighter used by the U.S. at that time, although it was poorly armored compared to U.S. aircraft. A pilot who realized that new tactics had to be devised was Lieutenant Commander John S. \"Jimmy\" Thach, commander of Fighting Three in San Diego. He read the early reports coming out of China and wrestled with the problem of his F4F Wildcats being relatively slower and much less maneuverable than the Japanese planes. He devised a defensive maneuver called the \"Thach Weave.\" Lieutenant Commander Thach reasoned that two planes, a leader and his wingman, could fly about 200 feet apart and adopt a weaving formation when under attack by Japanese fighters. Thach later faced the A6M Zero during the Battle of Midway, in June 1942, for the test of his theory. Although outnumbered, he found that a Zero would lock onto the tail of one of the fighters. In response, the two planes would turn toward each other. When the Zero followed its original target through the turn it would come into a position to be fired on by the target's wingman, and the predator would become the prey. His tactic proved to be effective and was soon adopted by other squadrons. The Thach Weave helped make up for the inferiority of the US planes in maneuverability and numbers, until new aircraft could be brought into service. The usefulness of this strategy survives until today. Another effective maneuver used by the U.S. Pilots was a simple break, which consisted of turning sharply across an attacker's flight path, which worked well because the large nose of the Zero tended to obstruct the pilot's view. [22] Still another good tactic was to dive upon the Zero, shoot in one pass, and use the speed to climb back above the fight to dive again.[23] By 1943 the U.S. technology began to produce planes that were better matched against the Japanese planes, such as the Grumman F6F Hellcat, and the Vought F4U Corsair.

Jet propulsion had been demonstrated long before the war, by German engineer Hans von Ohain in 1934, and by a British engineer named Frank Whittle in 1937. The Messerschmitt Me 262 was the first jet fighter to be used in battle, with a speed over 500 mph, and began taking a toll on Allied bombing missions in 1944. The British were testing a jet that same year, the Gloster Meteor, which would later see action in the Korean War. Although U.S. General Hap Arnold test flew the XP-59A in 1942, the plane was never used in combat. Other prime inventions of the era include radar and air-to-air missiles Hans Joachim Pabst von Ohain (1911 –1998) Messerschmitt Me 262 Schwalbe (\"Swallow\") was the world's first operational jet-powered fighter aircraft.[5] Design work started before World War II began but engine problems prevented the aircraft from attaining operational status with the Luftwaffe until mid-1944. Sir Frank Whittle )1907–1996( The Gloster Meteor was the first British jet fighter and the Allies' first operational jet. Although the German Messerschmitt Me 262 was the world's first operational jet, the Meteor was the first production jet as it entered production a few months before the Me 262. The Meteor's development was heavily reliant on its ground-breaking turbojet engines, developed by Sir Frank Whittle and his company, Power Jets Ltd. Development of the aircraft began in 1940, work on the engines had started in 1936. The Meteor first flew in 1943 and commenced operations on 27 July 1944 with 616 Squadron of the Royal Air Force (RAF).

Like the F.4, there were strong export sales of the F.8. Belgium ordered 240 aircraft, the majority assembled in The Netherlands by Fokker. The Netherlands had 160 F.8s, equipping seven squadrons until 1955. Denmark had 20, ordered in 1951; they were to be the last F.8s in front line service in Europe. The RAAF ordered 94 F.8s, which served in Korea (see below). Despite arms embargoes, both Syria and Egypt received F.8s from 1952, as did Israel (where they served until 1961). On 1 September 1955, two Israeli F.8s shot down two Egyptian Vampires and in the 1956 Suez Crisis, F.8s were employed by both Egypt and Israel in ground attack roles. After the crisis, both Egypt and Syria disposed of their Meteors in favour of various MiG variants. Brazil ordered 60 new Meteor F.8s and 10 T.7 trainers in October 1952, paying with 15,000 tons of raw cotton F.8 SOLO Return to Table of Content\n\n46. 46 Korean War (1950-1953) After World War II, the question began to rise about the future usefulness of fighter aircraft. This was especially true for the U.S., where the focus was placed on small, fast, long-range bombers capable of delivering atomic bombs. The Korean War began in June 1950, and the North Koreans were outmatched by the U.S. Air Force. The war was nearly over by October, with the surrender of North Korea when, on November 1, Chinese MiG-15s attacked. The Chinese began supplying North Korea with troops and provisions, and the war quickly resumed. At 100 MPH faster, the MiG-15 was more than a match for the U.S. P-80 Shooting Star, using the same dive and shoot tactic that the Americans found so useful against Japan. The U.S. jets had inferior weaponry, and suffered from problems with production and parts. The U.S. resorted to using mainly the more maneuverable propeller driven fighters during the war, such as the P-51 Mustang and the P-47 Thunderbolt, which were both carried over from World War II. To combat the MiGs, the F-86 Sabre was put into production. The U.S. pilots had one major advantage over the Chinese, the G-suit. Chinese fighters were often seen spinning off out of control during a hard turn because the pilot had lost consciousness. The Chinese were very competent in a dogfight, and large swirling battles were fought in the skies over Korea. However, it is highly suspected by many U.S. pilots that some of the opponents they faced over Korea were in fact well-trained Soviet pilots, who the Americans referred to as \"honchos,\" (a Japanese word, meaning \"bosses\"). Major Robinson Risner recalls, Seeing one another about the same time, the MiG flight and my flight dropped [our extra fuel] tanks.. He was so low he was throwing up small rocks. I dropped down to get him, but to hit him I had to get down in his jet wash. He'd chop the throttle and throw out his speed brakes. I would coast up beside him, wingtip to wingtip. When it looked like I was going to overshoot him, I would roll over the top and come down on the other side of him. When I did, he'd go into a hard turn, pulling all the Gs he could. This guy was one fantastic pilot. The war in the air, however, eventually came to a stalemate as fighting ceased between the two factions. SOLO\n\n47. 47 Korean War (1950-1953) Air Combats Those first encounters established the main features of the aerial battles of the next two and a half years. The MiG-15 and MiG-15bis had a higher ceiling than all the versions of the Sabre – 15,500 m (50,900 ft) versus 14,936 m (49,003 ft) of the F-86F – and accelerated faster than F- 86A/E/Fs due to their better thrust-to-weight ratio – 1,005 km/h (624 mph) versus 972 km/h (604 mph) of the F-86F. The MiG-15's 2,800 m (9,200 ft) per minute climbing rate was also greater than the 2,200 m (7,200 ft) per minute of the F-86A and -E (the F-86F matched the MiG-15s rate). A better turn radius above 10,000 m (33,000 ft) further distinguished the MiG- 15, as did more powerful weaponry – one 37 mm N-37 cannon and two 23 mm NR-23 cannons, versus the inferior hitting power of the six 12.7 mm (.50 in) machine guns of the Sabre. But the MiG was slower at low altitude – 935 km/h (581 mph) in the MiG-15bis configuration as opposed to the 1,107 km/h (688 mph) of the F-86F. The Soviet World War II-era ASP-1N gyroscopic gunsight was less sophisticated than the accurate A-1CM and A4 radar ranging sights of the F-86E and -F. All Sabres turned tighter below the 8,000 m (26,000 ft) altitude.[14] Thus if the MiG-15 forced the Sabre to fight in the vertical plane, or in the horizontal one above 10,000 m (33,000 ft), it gained a significant advantage. Furthermore, a MiG-15 could easily escape from a Sabre by climbing to its ceiling, knowing that the F-86 could not follow him. Below 8,000 m (26,247 ft) however, the Sabre had a slight advantage over the MiG in most aspects excluding climb rate, especially if the Soviet pilot made the mistake of fighting in the horizontal plane.

By the outbreak of the Suez Conflict in October 1956, four squadrons of the Egyptian Air Force were equipped with the type although few pilots were trained to fly them effectively. During the air combat against the Israeli Air Force the Egyptian MiG-15bis managed to shoot down only three Israeli aircraft: a Piper Cub and a Meteor F.8 on 30 October 1956, and a Dassault Ouragan on 1 November which then performed a belly landing — this last victory was scored by the Egyptian pilot Faruq el-Gazzavi.

The Mysteres shot down one MiG and damaged a second. In the following days two Mysteres engaged four Egyptian De Havilland Vampires and destroyed them all. 60 Mystere IV Six Days War 1967 During the Six Days War, the Israeli Air Force, with 196 combat[3] aircraft at its disposal had prevailed over a coalition with approximately 600 combat aircraft. The IAF destroyed 452 enemy aircraft, including 79 in air combat, while losing 46 of its own. 24 Israeli pilots and hundreds of Arab pilots were killed War of Attrition (1969 – 1970) On July 30, 1970, the tension peaked: An IAF ambush resulted in a large scale air brawl between IAF planes and MiGs flown by Soviet pilots – five MiGs were shot down, while the IAF suffered no losses. Fear of further escalation and superpower involvement brought the war to a conclusion. By the end of August 1970, the Israeli Air Force had claimed 111 aerial kills while admitting losing only four aircraft to Arab fighters. 72 Mirage III 1962 F4 Phantom 1969 Sinai War 1956 Douglas A-4 Skyhawk 1967 Arab-Israeli Air Wars SOLO\n\n53. 53 Shlomo Aloni, Arab-Israeli Air Wars 1947-82 Shlomo Aloni, Israeli Mirage and Nesher Aces Shlomo Aloni, Israeli F-4 Phantom II Aces SOLO\n\n54. 54 Name Command Period Amir Eshel * May 2012 - Present Ido Nechushtan May 2008 - May 2012 Elyezer Shkedy April 2004 - May 2008 Dan Halutz April 2000 - April 2004 Eitan Ben Eliyahu July 1996 - April 2000 Herzl Bodinger January 1992 - July 1996 Avihu Ben-Nun September 1987 - January 1992 Amos Lapidot December 1982 - September 1987 David Ivri October 1977 - December 1982 Binyamin (Benny) Peled May 1973 - October 1977 Mordechai Hod April 1966 - May 1973 Ezer Weizmann July 1958 - April 1966 Dan Tolkovsky May 1953 - July 1958 Hayim Laskov August 1951 - May 1953 Shlomo Shamir December 1950 - August 1951 Aharon Remez July 1948 - December 1950 Yisrael Amir May 1948 - July 1948 Israeli Air Force Commanders-in Chief SOLO\n\n55. 55 A few P-51 Mustangs were illegally bought by Israel in 1948, crated and smuggled into the country as agricultural equipment for use in the War of Independence (1948) and quickly established themselves as the best fighter in the Israeli inventory.[52] Further aircraft were bought from Sweden, and were replaced by jets at the end of the 1950s, but not before the type was used in the Suez Crisis, Operation Kadesh (1956). Reputedly, during this conflict, one daring Israeli pilot literally cut communications between Suez City and the Egyptian front lines by using his Mustang's propeller on the telephone wires.[53] Sinai War 1956 P-51D at the Israeli Air Force Museum; the marking beneath the cockpit notes its participation in the wire-cutting operation at the onset of the Suez Crisis Most of the IDF weapons in 1956 came from France. The main aircraft were the Dassault Mystère IVA (50) and the Ouragan (75). Superior pilot training was to give the Israeli Air Force an unbeatable edge over their Egyptian opponents Dassault M.D.450 Ouragan Dassault Mystère IVA On 30 October 1956 the Mystere IV gets its first kill when eight aircraft were in combat with 12 Egyptian Air Force MiG-15s. The Mysteres shot down one MiG and damaged a second. In the following days two Mysteres engaged four Egyptian De Havilland Vampires and destroyed them all. Israeli Ouragans entered combat on 12 April 1956, shooting down an Egyptian Vampire. At the onset of the Suez Crisis on 29 October 1956, Ouragans shot down an additional four Vampires. The two documented encounters with Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 fighters (also powered by the Nene engine but with a more modern swept wing) ended with one Ouragan surviving several 37 mm (1.46 in) cannon hits to fly the next day and one MiG-15 being heavily damaged after it entered a turning dogfight with the Ouragans.[8] The poor training of the Egyptian pilots who were consistently unable to realize their advantage in numbers as well as the MiG-15's speed and climb characteristics helped Ouragans to survive despite their inferior performance. On 31 October, a pair of Ouragans armed with rockets strafed the Egyptian destroyer Ibrahim el Awal (ex-HMS Mendip), resulting in the capture of the ship.[ SOLO\n\n56. 56 Dassault M.D.450 Ouragan (French: Hurricane) The Dassault M.D.450 Ouragan was the first French-designed jet fighter-bomber to enter production, playing a key role in resurgence of the French aviation industry after World War II. The Ouragan was operated by France, Israel, India and El Salvador. While in Israeli service it participated in both the Suez Crisis and Six-Day War.

Two Mirage IIIRJ single-seat photo-reconnaissance aircraft, received in March 1964. Four Mirage IIIBJ two-seat combat trainers, three received in 1966 and one in 1968. The Israeli AF Mirage III fleet went through several modifications during their service life. Over the demilitarized zone on the Israeli side of the border with Syria, a total of six MiGs were shot down the first day Mirages fought the MiGs. In the Six-Day War, except for 12 Mirages (four in the air and eight on the ground), left behind to guard Israel from Arab bombers, all the Mirages were fitted with bombs, and sent to attack the Arab air bases. However the Mirage's performance as a bomber was limited. During the following days Mirages performed as fighters, and out of a total of 58 Arab planes shot down in air combat during the war, 48 were accounted for by Mirages. Six Days War 1967 Air Combat Totals by waves • First wave (7:45am): 101 flights; 11 airfields were attacked by 183 IAF aircraft; 197 Egyptian aircraft and 8 radar stations were destroyed.

The Israelis claimed two kills and no losses. Around 80 MiG-19s were in service with Egypt during the Six-Day War in 1967, but more than half were destroyed on the ground during the opening Israeli airstrikes of Operation Focus. Israeli pilots, however, did find the MiG-19 a potentially dangerous adversary because of its performance, maneuverability, and heavy armament. Following the war, the Egyptians organized the surviving MiG-19 aircraft and assigned them air defense tasks of Egypt's interior. The Soviet Union did not supply Egypt with any replacement of the MiG- 19s destroyed in the Six Day War, but Egypt might have received some from Syria and Iraq, so that by the end of 1968 there were 80+ MiG-19s in service with the Egyptian Air Force (EAF). The aircraft also saw combat during the War of Attrition; in one engagement on 19 May 1969, a MiG-19 aircraft engaged two Israeli Mirages, shooting down one with cannon fire while the other escaped.[8] Egypt had around 60 Mig-19s in service during the Yom Kippur War of 1973 in which they served as close support aircraft.

The MiG-21 first encountered Israeli Mirage IIICs on 14 November 1964, but it was not until 14 July 1966 that the first MiG-21 was shot down. Another six Syrian MiG-21s were shot down by Israeli Mirages on 7 April 1967. The MiG-21 would also face F-4 Phantom IIs and A-4 Skyhawks, but was later outclassed by the more modern McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon, which were acquired by Israel beginning in the mid-1970s. During the opening attacks of the 1967 Six Day War, the Israeli Air Force struck Arab air forces in four attack waves. In the first wave, IDF aircraft claimed to have destroyed eight Egyptian aircraft in air-to-air combat, of which seven were MiG- 21s; Egypt claims 10 Israeli aircraft destroyed, four or five of which were scored by MiG-21PFs. During the second wave the Israelis claimed four MiG-21s downed in air-to-air combat, and the third wave resulted in two Syrian and one Iraqi MiG-21s claimed destroyed in the air. The fourth wave destroyed some more Syrian MiG-21s on the ground. Overall, the Egyptians lost around 100 out of about 110 MiG-21s they had, almost all on the ground; the Syrians lost 35 of 60 MiG-21F-13s and MiG-21PFs in the air and on the ground SOLO\n\n70. 70 Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 Egyptian-Syrian-Israeli conflicts Between the end of the Six Day War and the start of the War of Attrition, IDF Mirage fighters had six confirmed kills of Egyptian MiG- 21s, in exchange for Egyptian MiG-21s scoring two confirmed and three probable kills against Israeli aircraft. During the War of Attrition itself, the Israelis claimed 56 confirmed kills against Egyptian MiG-21s, while Egyptian MiG-21s claimed 14 confirmed and 12 probable kills against IDF aircraft. During this same time period, from the end of the Six Day War to the end of the War of Attrition, the Israelis claimed a total of 25 Syrian MiG-21s destroyed; the Syrians claimed three confirmed and four probable kills of Israel aircraft.[1] High losses to Egyptian aircraft and continuous bombing during the War of Attrition caused the Egyptians to ask the Soviet Union for help. In June 1970, Soviet pilots and SAM crews arrived with their equipment. On 22 June 1970, a Soviet pilot flying a MiG-21MF shot down an Israeli A-4E. After some more successful intercepts by Soviet pilots and another Israeli A-4 being shot down on 25 July, the Israelis decided to plan an ambush in response. On 30 July Israeli F-4s lured Soviet MiG-21s into an area where they were ambushed by Mirages. Asher Snir, flying a Mirage IIICJ, destroyed a Soviet MiG-21; Avihu Ben-Nun and Aviam Sela, both piloting F-4Es, each got a kill, and an unidentified pilot in another Mirage scored the fourth kill against the Soviet-flown MiG-21s. Three Soviet pilots were killed and the Soviets were alarmed by the losses. However, Soviet MiG-21 pilots and SAM crews destroyed a total of 21 Israeli aircraft, which helped to convince the Israelis to sign a ceasefire agreement.[1] In September 1973 a large air battle erupted between the Syrians and the Israelis; the Israelis claimed a total of 12 Syrian MiG-21s destroyed, while the Syrians claimed eight kills scored by MiG-21s and admitted five losses. During the Yom Kippur War, the Israelis claimed a total of 73 kills of Egyptian MiG-21s. Egypt claimed 27 kills of Israeli aircraft by its MiG-21s, plus eight probables.[1] However, according to most reliable sources, these were exaggerated claims as Israeli air-to-air combat losses for the entire war did not exceed five to eight. On the Syrian front of the war, 6 October 1973 saw a flight of Syrian MiG-21MFs shoot down an IDF A-4E and a Mirage IIICJ while losing three of their own to Israeli IAI Neshers. On 7 October, Syrian MiG-21MFs downed two Israeli F-4Es, three Mirage IIICJs and an A-4E while losing two of their MiGs to Neshers and one to an F-4E, plus two to friendly SAM fire. Iraqi MiG-21PFs also operated on this front, and on that same day destroyed two A-4Es while losing one MiG. On 8 October 1973 Syrian MiG-21PFMs downed three F- 4Es, but six of their MiG-21s were lost. By the end of the war, Syrian MiG-21s claimed a total of 30 confirmed kills against Israeli aircraft; 29 MiG-21s were claimed as destroyed by the IDF.[1] Between the end of the Yom Kippur War and the start of the 1982 Lebanon War, the Israelis had received modern F-15s and F-16s, which were far superior to the old Syrian MiG-21MFs. According to the IDF, these new planes accounted for the destruction of 24 Syrian MiG-21s over this time period, though the Syrians did claim five kills against IDF aircraft with their MiG-21s armed with outdated K-13 missiles.[1] The 1982 Lebanon War started on 6 June 1982, and in the course of that war the IDF claimed to have destroyed about 45 Syrian MiG- 21MFs. The Syrians claimed two confirmed and 15 probable kills of Israeli aircraft.[1] This air battle was the largest to occur since the Korean War.

Despite the many aerial engagements during the Korean war, the U.S. continued with its emphasis on long-range fighter/bombers, such as the F-105 Thunderchief, a plane known for its high speed, but lack of maneuverability. Believing that long-range radar interception and guided air-to-air missiles would render dogfighting obsolete, the U.S. equipped their top fighter, the F-4 Phantom, with missiles only, leaving out the guns that were necessary for in-close combat. However, the U.S. rules of engagement required visual identification of enemy targets, which usually ensured that in-close combat would occur.[32] Being designed as a long-range fighter/bomber, the F-4 was very heavy, and far less maneuverable than the lighter MiG-17s and MiG-21s that were used by the North Vietnamese. The missiles used by the U.S. were not very effective against the small, fast, and highly maneuverable MiGs. Heat seeking missiles, like the AIM-4 Falcon and the AIM-9 Sidewinder, and radar guided missiles, like the AIM-7 Sparrow, were originally designed to target the slower moving Russian-made bombers. The Sparrow had difficulty tracking the small radar signature of the MiGs. The Sidewinder could easily be out-maneuvered by the Russian built fighters, while the Falcon's lack of a proximity trigger required a direct hit, making it practically useless. The most reliable of the missiles, the Sidewinder, only scored one hit out of every seven that were fired, and, quite often, engagements occurred too close for a missile to be used.[32] Learning from the mistakes in Vietnam, the U.S. was forced to confront the problems with their tactics and designs. John R. Boyd, a fighter pilot from the Korean war, began to examine the performance characteristics of aircraft, noting that the U.S. aircraft designers emphasized speed, range, and the ability to make a tight turn. Boyd recalled from the Korean war that, while the F-86 could not out-run or out-turn the MiG-15s, its better performance came from its ability to quickly switch from one maneuver to another, or from its \"agility,\" allowing it to defeat the Russian planes. In 1960, Boyd devised special theory for determining an aircraft's agility based on its energy-to-weight ratio. Boyd's Energy-Maneuverability theory described in scientific terms how an aircraft will perform as a function of speed (kinetic energy) and altitude (potential energy), resulting in the modern energy- management diagram. Boyd's work helped pave the way for the design of modern fighter planes, starting with the Vietnam War (1965 – 1975) F-105 F-4 PhantomMiG-17 MiG-21 SOLO\n\n74. 74 Vietnam War Movies Dogfights, Gun Kills Of Vietnam, Part 1 Dogfights, Gun Kills Of Vietnam, Part 2 Dogfights, Gun Kills Of Vietnam, Part 3 Dogfights, Gun Kills Of Vietnam, Part 4 Dogfights, Gun Kills Of Vietnam, Part 5 Dogfights, F4 Phantom II Dogfights, The Bloodiest Day Of Vietnam , Part 1 Dogfights, The Bloodiest Day Of Vietnam, Part 2 Dogfights, The Bloodiest Day Of Vietnam, Part 3 Dogfights, The Bloodiest Day Of Vietnam, Part 4 History (TV Channel) SOLO Return to Movies Table A Historystartsnow Production I do not own any copyrights over those videos.
