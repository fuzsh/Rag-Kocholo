Melnikov.\n\nSources\n\nGlinka Dmitry Borisovich (1917-1979).\n\nMilitary pilot, twice Hero of the Soviet Union (1943).\n\nBorn on December 12, 1917 in a working-class family, in the village of Aleksandrov Dar, now the village of Rakhmanovka, Dnepropetrovsk region. Graduated from junior high school. At the age of 13, he came to the MOPR mine, where his father and older brother worked.\n\nIn 1937 he graduated from the Krivoy Rog flying club.\n\nSince 1937 in the Red Army.\n\nIn 1939 he graduated from the Kachin Military Aviation Pilot School. Served in the 45th IAP (based in Baku), flew I-16. Graduated from flight commander courses.\n\nDmitry received his baptism of fire in January 1942 in Crimea, as part of the 45th Fighter Aviation Regiment, equipped with Yak-1 aircraft. There he made an initiative by shooting down a Ju-88. In heavy battles on 4 fronts (Crimean, Southern, North Caucasian, Transcaucasian) from January 9 to September 19, 1942, the regiment lost 30 aircraft and 12 pilots, destroying 95 enemy aircraft. Dmitry Glinka then shot down 6 enemy vehicles. In May he was hit and wounded. I woke up in the arms of infantrymen, not remembering how I descended with a parachute. The concussion turned out to be so serious that doctors flatly forbade him to fly. He spent about 2 months in hospitals.\n\nHis return coincided with the arrival of young pilots in the unit, and, having carefully looked at the replenishment, he chose as his wingman a thin boy who looked like a gypsy, Ivan Babak. There were days when they made 4-5 sorties.\n\nSoon Dmitry became the first ace in the regiment, he was assigned to lead large groups of fighters into battle.\n\nIn January 1943, the regiment was rearmed with Airacobras, and on March 10 it was thrown into battle in the Kuban. Here the regiment became the Guards - the 100th GvIAP, and the assistant commander for the air and rifle service of the Guard, Captain D. Glinka, proved himself to be an outstanding master of vertical maneuver. Flying an Airacobra with tail number “21,” Dmitry sowed real terror among enemy pilots. Within a few weeks (by May 1943), he shot down 21 enemy aircraft, becoming one of the most successful pilots in this battle. Here, in Kuban, in a big battle, where more than 100 aircraft took part on both sides, Dmitry, attacking from behind - from below, from a hill, successively shot down 2 Ju-88 bombers, but he himself was shot down for the second and last time during the war, wounded , jumped out with a parachute. A week later he returned from the hospital still in bandages.\n\nFor the exemplary performance of combat missions of the command, courage, bravery and heroism shown in the fight against the Nazi invaders, by Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR dated April 24, 1943, he was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union with the Order of Lenin and the Gold Star medal (medal \" Gold Star\" No. 906).\n\nA man of great physical strength, endurance and passion, in the stubborn April battles he made several combat missions a day, once bringing their number to 9! After that, he slept for almost a day and a half and was diagnosed \"severe fatigue\" was suspended from flying for a week.\n\nBy decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR dated August 24, 1943, D.B. Glinka was awarded the second Gold Star medal for new exploits.\n\nAfter almost six months of vacation, study and replenishment, the pilots of the 100th Guards Aviation Regiment took part in the Iasi-Kishinev operation on the southern segment of the front. During these battles, the regiment's pilots shot down about 50 enemy aircraft, and Dmitry Glinka's personal score grew to 46 victories. So, in May 1944, in one of the battles of a group of 12 Airacobras with 45 Ju-87 dive bombers and fighters covering them, Dmitry shot down 3 aircraft at once. In total, during a week of intense fighting near Iasi, he won 6 victories.\n\nIn July 1944, having flown on a transport Li-2 as part of 5 pilots of the 100th Guards IAP to pick up repaired aircraft, Dmitry Glinka almost died in a plane crash. Arriving at the airfield a few minutes before departure, Glinka and his companions sat on airplane covers in the tail of the Li-2 (all seats in the cabin were already occupied). During the flight, the plane hit the top of the Kremetskaya Mountain, covered with clouds, and crashed. All crew members and passengers were killed. Only five pilots from Glinka’s group survived, who were saved only by the fact that they were positioned at the very rear of the machine. All of them received severe bruises and wounds. Dmitry suffered especially. He was unconscious for several days and was treated for almost 2 months.\n\nAfter recovery, Dmitry Glinka continued his combat activities and won many more victories. So, during the Lvov-Sandomierz operation, he managed to destroy 9 German vehicles. In the battles for Berlin, he shot down 3 planes in one day, and won his last victory on April 18, 1945, at point-blank range, from 30 meters, shooting down an FW-190 fighter.\n\nDmitry Glinka ended the war having completed about 300 combat missions and conducted more than 100 air battles. The brave pilot has personally shot down 50 enemy aircraft (9 of them on the Yak-1, the rest on the Airacobra).\n\nAfter the war, Dmitry Borisovich served in aviation for a long time, commanded a regiment, and then was deputy commander of an aviation division.\n\nIn 1951 he graduated from the Air Force Academy.\n\nIn 1960, he was demobilized with the rank of Guard Colonel. Many famous combat pilots, having firmly linked their fate with aviation, exchanged the cockpits of formidable fighters, attack aircraft and bombers for the cockpits of helicopters and passenger, ambulance and agricultural aircraft. Twice Hero of the Soviet Union D.B. Glinka sat at the helm of the passenger liner.\n\nDeputy of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of the 2nd convocation.\n\nLived in Moscow. Died March 1, 1979.

Graduated from junior high school. Since 1937 in the Red Army. In 1939 he graduated from the Kachin Military Aviation Pilot School.\n\nSince January 1942, Lieutenant D.B. Glinka has been in the active army. He received his baptism of fire in Crimea, as part of the 45th IAP. He distinguished himself in battles in Kuban.\n\nBy April 1943, assistant commander of the air rifle service of the 45th Fighter Aviation Regiment (216th Mixed Aviation Division, 4th Air Army, North Caucasus Front) Senior Lieutenant D. B. Glinka made 146 combat missions and shot down 15 aircraft enemy.\n\nOn April 24, 1943, for the courage and courage shown in battles with enemies, he was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.\n\nBy August 1943, the assistant commander for air rifle service of the 100th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment (9th Guards Fighter Aviation Division, 4th Air Army) of the Guard, Captain D. B. Glinka, completed 183 combat missions, conducted 62 air battles and personally shot down 29 enemy aircraft.\n\nAfter the end of the war, he continued to serve in the Air Force and commanded a regiment. In 1951 he graduated from the Air Force Academy. He was deputy commander of a fighter aviation division. Since 1960, Guard Colonel D.B. Glinka has been in reserve. Lived in Moscow, worked in Civil Aviation. Deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of the 2nd convocation. Died March 1, 1979. A bronze bust was installed in Krivoy Rog. His name was given to a street in the city of Bryanka, Voroshilovgrad region.\n\nAwarded the orders: Lenin (twice), Red Banner (five), Alexander Nevsky, Patriotic War 1st degree, Red Star (twice); medals.\n\n* * *\n\nHe was born into a miner's family on December 10, 1917, in the village of Aleksandrov Dar, Ekaterinoslav province. At the age of 13, he came to the MOPR mine, where his father and older brother worked. Here, in the hard, monotonous everyday life, a joyful word once sparkled - aviation.\n\nFollowing his lively, flight-obsessed brother Boris, the silent bumpkin Dmitry was accepted into the Krivoy Rog flying club, and 3 years later, in 1939, he graduated from the then famous Kachinsky Red Banner Flight School.\n\n“...Tall, his strong-willed gaze from under short eyebrows gave his face a stern, even stern expression, and we, young people, were openly afraid of this gaze. A master of air combat, Dmitry shot very accurately from short distances, piloted with high overloads, most often without warning about his maneuver on the radio,” Hero of the Soviet Union, Colonel General of Aviation G.U. Dolnikov recalled about his presenter.\n\n“DB”, as this great fighter was dubbed by his initials at the front, was distinguished by exceptional inquisitiveness and tenacity, with patient stubbornness, again and again he threw the plane into complex figures that were difficult for the pilot, or in stubborn concentration of thought, like the ancient philosophers, tried to get to the bottom of the root causes of things and actions.\n\nAn extraordinary air fighter, Dmitry Borisovich Glinka was a friendly and very patient mentor, distinguished by pedagogical tact and invention.\n\nHis student Hero of the Soviet Union Grigory Ustinovich Dolnikov later recalled: “He replaced shouts and suggestions with irony, and it worked better than any reprimands.”\n\nUnlike most of the top ten aces, Dmitry Glinka did not go through instructor school, but until January 1942, when he finally went to the front, he served in a combat unit, several hundred missions on the I-16 fighter.\n\nDmitry received his baptism of fire in Crimea, as part of the 45th Fighter Aviation Regiment, equipped with aircraft. There he made an initiative by shooting down a Ju-88.\n\nIn heavy battles on 4 fronts (Crimean, Southern, North Caucasian, Transcaucasian) from January 9 to September 19, 1942, the regiment lost 30 aircraft and 12 pilots, destroying 95 enemy aircraft. Dmitry Glinka then shot down 6 enemy vehicles.\n\nIn May he was hit and wounded. I woke up in the arms of infantrymen, not remembering how I descended with a parachute. The concussion turned out to be so serious that doctors flatly forbade him to fly. He spent about 2 months in hospitals.\n\nHis return coincided with the arrival of young pilots in the unit, and, having carefully looked at the replenishment, he chose as his wingman a thin boy who looked like a gypsy, Ivan Babak.\n\nThere were days when they made 4-5 sorties. Soon Dmitry became the first ace in the regiment, he was assigned to lead large groups of fighters into battle.\n\nIn January 1943, the regiment was rearmed with Airacobras, and on March 10 it was thrown into battle in the Kuban. Here the regiment became the Guards - the 100th GvIAP, and the assistant commander for the air and rifle service of the Guard, Captain D. D. Glinka, proved himself to be an outstanding master of vertical maneuver. Flying an Airacobra with tail number “21,” Dmitry sowed real terror among enemy pilots. Within a few weeks (by May 1943), he shot down 21 enemy aircraft, becoming one of the most successful pilots in this battle.\n\nFor the exemplary performance of combat missions of the command, courage, bravery and heroism shown in the fight against the Nazi invaders, by Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR dated April 24, 1943, he was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union with the Order of Lenin and the Gold Star medal.\n\nA man of great physical strength, endurance and passion, in the stubborn April battles he made several combat missions a day, once bringing their number to 9! After that, he slept for almost a day and a half and, diagnosed with “severe fatigue,” was suspended from flying for a week.\n\nHere, in Kuban, in a big battle, where more than 100 aircraft took part on both sides, Dmitry, attacking from behind - from below, from a hill, successively shot down 2 Ju-88 bombers, but he himself was shot down for the second and last time during the war, wounded , jumped out with a parachute. A week later he returned from the hospital still in bandages.\n\nAt the end of April 1943, Senior Lieutenant D. D. Glinka shot down 3 Ju-87 dive bombers in one flight, 2 of them in an irresistible 5-second attack. A few days later, on May 4, during the attack on the Sarabuz airfield, he burned 2 Me-109s on the ground and shot down a Ju-52 transport landing.\n\nHis manner of conducting air combat under any circumstances was attacking, open, without camouflage, with maximum loads for the pilot and the aircraft, with sharp evolutions.\n\n“He knew how to use the prevailing situation extremely effectively in any battle with the enemy, well organized interaction within the group... he was distinguished by the exceptional art of fighting on vertical lines” - this brief description of Dmitry Glinka belongs to Ivan Babak, and hardly anyone can characterize the work better than a wingman fighter pilot.\n\nOn April 30, 1943, an essay about Dmitry Glinka by the poet I. Selvinsky, “The Feeling of Heaven,” appeared in Krasnaya Zvezda. The author began the description of the hero with a mention of the creative method of the artist - portrait painter V. Serov, who looked for an external resemblance in a person to some animal or bird, which made it possible to unexpectedly reveal a person, to see the unusual in the ordinary. In the figure of the pilot, in his profile, there was clearly a resemblance to a handsome eagle.\n\nHaving become twice Hero of the Soviet Union in August 1943, Dmitry had a hard time surviving the test of glory. He was embarrassed by portraits in newspapers, correspondents and cameramen, and dozens of letters from strangers delivered to him every day. Dmitry's unbalanced character became even more uneven. On the one hand, front-line brotherhood required easy communication, utmost honesty and sincerity, on the other hand, the position obligated to bear the highest title, according to merit. At times Dmitry became deliberately serious, even stern, but more often age took its toll, and he remained a cheerful, slightly clumsy 23-year-old guy.\n\nDmitry Glinka continued to fly a lot and win victories. After the battles in the Kuban, the regiment participated without interruption in the Mius operation, in the battles on the Molochnaya River, and in the Battle of Perekop.\n\n“The larger the enemy, the easier it is to beat him” - this aphorism by Dmitry Glinka rather characterizes the author than accurately reflects reality.\n\nIn early September, after receiving the second “Gold Star”, Dmitry almost died while playing with German captured “frog” grenades. Due to the explosion of a grenade that fell nearby, he received multiple light wounds to his legs. Despite the unfortunate accident, by December 5, 1943, Dmitry chalked up 8 more enemy vehicles.\n\nAfter almost six months of vacation, study and replenishment, the pilots of the 100th Guards Aviation Regiment took part in the Iasi-Kishinev operation on the southern segment of the front. During these battles, the regiment's pilots shot down about 50 enemy aircraft, and Dmitry Glinka's personal score grew to 46 victories. So, in May 1944, in one of the battles of a group of 12 Airacobras with 45 Ju-87 dive bombers and fighters covering them, Dmitry shot down 3 aircraft at once. In total, during a week of intense fighting near Iasi, he won 6 victories.\n\nIn July 1944, having flown on a transport Li-2 as part of 5 pilots of the 100th Guards IAP to pick up repaired aircraft, Dmitry Glinka almost died in a plane crash. Arriving at the airfield a few minutes before departure, Glinka and his companions sat on airplane covers in the tail of the Li-2 (all seats in the cabin were already occupied). During the flight, the plane hit the top of the Kremetskaya Mountain, covered with clouds, and crashed. All crew members and passengers were killed. Only five pilots from Glinka’s group survived, who were saved only by the fact that they were positioned at the very rear of the machine. All of them received severe bruises and wounds. Dmitry suffered especially. He was unconscious for several days and was treated for almost 2 months.\n\nAfter recovery, Dmitry Glinka continued his combat activities and won many more victories. So, during the Lvov-Sandomierz operation, he managed to destroy 9 German vehicles. In the battles for Berlin, he shot down 3 planes in one day, and won his last victory on April 18, 1945, at point-blank range, from 30 meters, shooting down an FW-190 fighter.\n\nDmitry Glinka ended the war having completed about 300 combat missions and conducted more than 100 air battles. The brave pilot has personally shot down 50 enemy aircraft (9 of them on the Yak-1, the rest on the Airacobra).\n\nAfter the war, Dmitry Borisovich served in aviation for a long time, commanded a regiment, and then was deputy commander of an aviation division. In 1951 he graduated from the Air Force Academy. In 1960, he was demobilized with the rank of Guard Colonel. Lived in Moscow.\n\nMany famous combat pilots, having firmly linked their fate with aviation, exchanged the cockpits of formidable fighters, attack aircraft and bombers for the cockpits of helicopters and passenger, ambulance and agricultural aircraft. One of the famous aces of the Great Patriotic War, twice Hero of the Soviet Union, D. B. Glinka, also sat at the helm of the passenger liner.\n\n“I served in the Air Force for a long time. On a July morning in 1945, I was among those who threw enemy banners at the foot of the Mausoleum of V.I. Lenin. I could retire, pick mushrooms, hunt, listen to my favorite music, and read books. But I can’t live without the sky, I can’t live without a helm,” said Dmitry Borisovich Glinka. These words of the famous air knight best characterize his restless heart, his love for the Motherland, for aviation.\n\n* * *\n\nKuban \"whatnot\".\n\nIn the spring of 1943, the Germans launched an offensive in the Kuban from the Taman Peninsula. Behind the so-called “Blue Line” the enemy concentrated a mass of its troops, and at the airfields of the Taman Peninsula, in Crimea and southern Ukraine - a large number of bomber and fighter aircraft. A grandiose air battle unfolded in the skies of Kuban.\n\nAt the end of March 1943, we flew to Kuban from the rear. On one of the first sorties, we were eight Airacobras in a “front” battle formation at an altitude of 2000 meters with the task of covering our troops from the village of Krymskaya to Neberezhaevskaya. Soon, Me-109s were spotted over the Krymskaya village at a high altitude, and our group of eight simultaneously began to gain altitude.\n\nNote in Ogonyok\n\n\"\n\nBut it turned out that during our withdrawal to an altitude of 7000 meters, the enemy bombers we noticed bombed our troops from an average height below us. Upon returning to the airfield, during a short debriefing, the error of our actions was noted, and it was decided to split into 2 groups: strike and covering.\n\nOn the same day, the flight was repeated again as part of eight. The patrol was now structured like this: the strike group consisted of 6 aircraft and was supposed to be at 2000-2500 meters with the task of destroying only enemy bombers, and the cover group - the top pair, going 700 meters above the strike, was supposed to fight mainly with fighters enemy.\n\nThis flight was successful. The strike group completed its task, upset the bombers, preventing them from reaching our troops, and the top pair pinned down 4 enemy fighters in battle.\n\nIn subsequent flights, we began to allocate 2-3 pairs to cover strike groups. Sometimes the composition of the strike group was reduced to provide several layers of cover. This is how a tactical technique appeared, nicknamed by the pilots the Kuban “whatnot.” What is this technique?\n\nA strike group of aircraft patrolled at the height of the probable approach of enemy bombers with the task of preventing bombing.\n\nThe formation of the strike group consisted of 2 pairs and was built along the front with intervals between pairs of 250-300 meters. In pairs, the planes were built like this: an interval of up to 200 meters, a distance of 50 - 75 meters.\n\nWhen enemy bombers were detected on a collision course, the strike group lined up along the front at reduced intervals and, at the command of the leader, opened fire on the bombers; the latter, as a rule, crumbled. The remaining 2-3 pairs had an excess of up to 1000 meters over the strike group. They were built in such a way that the top pair could see the next stage of the bottom pair or strike group. In cases where enemy bombers went without cover, the top pairs could also always join the battle - support the strike group.\n\nFor the fight against enemy fighters, such a system also justified itself. If a strike group was attacked, then when leaving the attack the enemy fighters came under fire from the upper pairs. If the top pairs were engaged in an air battle, then one pair of the strike group or the entire group in pairs could gain altitude above the air battle and be the master of the situation. This procedure was widely used during patrols over troops.\n\nThe separation of the “stack” was most often carried out like this: one pair at an altitude of 4000 meters; the second pair - at 5000 meters and to the side at 300 meters, behind at 200 meters; third pair - 6000 meters and to the side at 300 meters, behind at 200 meters; fourth pair - at 7000 meters and to the side at 300 meters, behind at 200 meters. Couples in formation - “front”. The distance between the planes is 150-200 meters to the side and 40-50 meters behind. All pairs maintain visual and radio contact with each other. Only the leading pairs maintain radio contact with the leading eights. This formation does not allow the enemy to immediately detect the number of our patrols and provides full opportunity to repel any sudden attack.\n\nWe used this battle formation until the end of the war, changing the composition of the strike and covering groups depending on the situation. When the enemy began to use fighters as bombers, only one pair was allocated to the covering group, and the strike group increased to 3-4 pairs. In cases where the strike group consisted of 4 pairs, it was divided into 2 strike subgroups, which were located one from the other with an elevation of up to 1000 meters and away from them up to 600 meters.\n\n(From the collection - “One Hundred Stalinist Falcons in the Battles for the Motherland.” Moscow, “YAUZA - EKSMO”, 2005.)\n\n* * *\n\nLIBERATING THE NATIVE KUBAN...\n\nThere were fierce battles in Kuban. Below, on the ground, the situation was difficult. One of our units was still on the move and did not have time to dig in when the Junkers appeared in the sky. Our observers counted 60 enemy aircraft and lost count. Not because they thought poorly, but because the formation of German bombers suddenly fell apart. And the sky was all mixed up.\n\nGlinka brothers - Dmitry and Boris\n\nThis “carousel” was started by Dmitry Glinka. Six fighters under his command found themselves face to face with a black cloud of German planes. But before our fighters had time to rush at the enemy, they themselves were attacked by Messerschmitts. The fascist pilots wanted to divert the attack from the Junkers and give them the opportunity to bomb. Dmitry Glinka took this into account in time.\n\nRushing forward like a whirlwind through the curtain of German fighters, Glinka crashed into the center of a group of bombers and disgracefully split their formation. The Messerschmitts began to hunt for him. But he was saving ammunition. With false maneuvers he confused enemy fighters, while he himself treated the bombers with shells and bullets.\n\nSo he shot down one leading Junkers, sent after him the leading second link, then the third. Seeing their brothers fall and burn one after another, the German pilots were at a loss.\n\nFear has big eyes. It seemed to the Germans that they were attacked by an entire squadron of Soviet aircraft. Before reaching the target, they took off, throwing bombs anywhere.\n\nIn this battle, Dmitry Glinka’s plane was also shot down. No one knew what happened to the pilot. Soon the news of the sad incident spread throughout the entire regiment. Dmitry’s older brother, Boris Glinka, also found out about this. Just shortly before this, he had been transferred to the very regiment where Dmitry served.\n\nBoris decided to brutally take revenge on the Germans for his brother. He and his comrades immediately took to the air and quickly attacked the enemy aircraft that appeared in the sky. Boris Glinka shot German air bandits with well-aimed machine-gun bursts. Two Junkers fell apart from his blows.\n\nOther pilots did not lag behind Boris. The regiment where the Glinka brothers fought shot down 20 German planes that day.\n\nIt was a great success. But the loss of Dmitry Glinka darkened the joy and saddened the hearts of the pilots. The regiment deeply loved this broad-shouldered, heroic-built man. Everyone wanted to believe that he would return, that he would again lead his winged car into battle. Their hopes came true.\n\nThis is what happened to Dmitry Glinka. Having jumped out with a parachute, he landed not far from a mountain village and lost consciousness. This is where local residents found him. They carefully laid the pilot on the white silk of his parachute and carried him in their arms through the mountains and forests.\n\nThe pilot was still unconscious when the mountaineers approached our units. The thunder of the guns brought Glinka to consciousness, and he remembered the details of the battle. The doctors tried to keep him in the hospital, but he was eager to go to his unit. He came to the regiment in tatters, tanned, but, as always, cheerful and restless, ready to fight the air enemy from morning to evening.\n\nIn the spring of 1943, in continuous and brutal battles in the Kuban, Dmitry Glinka shot down up to a dozen fascist vehicles. The fame of his exploits reached the very heart of the country - Moscow. The Presidium of the Supreme Sonnet of the USSR issued a Decree conferring the title of Hero of the Soviet Union on senior lieutenant, now captain, Dmitry Glinka.\n\nAfter some time, the elder brother, Boris Glinka, was also awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. Selflessly fighting for our Soviet Motherland, the Glinka brothers had by this time shot down 31 German planes. Dmitry shot down 21 German cars, and Boris - 10.\n\nThere is not a person in Kuban now who has not heard about the exploits of the Glinka brothers. People of selfless courage and bravery, they became the pride of Soviet aviation.\n\nJust a story: I thank comrade Vyacheslav Chesky for the information.\n\nMany families fought in the Red Army: fathers and sons, brothers and sisters, and even grandfathers and their grandchildren. Many became world famous, such as brother and sister Heroes of the Soviet Union Zoya and Alexander Kosmodemyansky or two famous pilot brothers Hero of the Soviet Union Boris and twice Hero of the Soviet Union Dmitry Glinka.\n\nFrom my dear mine to the field of war -\n\nRushing to formidable heights\n\nWinged Glinka Boris sons,\n\nOur brave pilots.\n\nFrom “A Word to the Great Stalin from the Ukrainian People”\n\n12/14/1944\n\nGlinka brothers: Dmitry (left) and Boris (right)\n\nDmitry became the seventh most successful Soviet fighter ace, and his older brother Boris also became a pilot, having shot down enough Germans to be awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe brothers were born in the village of Alexandrov Dar, which later merged with Krivoy Rog. The eldest was born in September 1914, two weeks after the outbreak of the First World War. Junior - December 10, 1917. The family had to endure the German occupation in 1918, and the rampant anarchist movement led by Nestor Makhno during the Civil War, and the massive famine in the USSR, which raged in 1932-33 in Ukraine, Belarus, the North Caucasus, the Volga region, and the South Caucasus. The Urals, Western Siberia, Kazakhstan and other regions of the vast country.\n\nBoris graduated from seven classes of the Krivoy Rog school in 1928 and immediately went to the coal mine, where his father, a professional miner, worked. The young man graduated from a mining technical school in 1934, after which he worked in a mine as a shift foreman. However, his craze for aviation led him first to the flying club, and then to the Civil Air Fleet pilot school in Kherson, from which he graduated in 1936, after which he remained to work there as an instructor.\n\nDmitry followed in his footsteps. At the age of 13, he was already working at the MOPR mine next to his father and brother. Boris had just graduated from the Krivoy Rog flying club when Dmitry appeared there, and three years later he became a graduate of the Kachinsky Flight School.\n\nOn the very eve of 1940, Boris was drafted into the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army and sent to the Odessa Military Aviation Pilot School, where, after studying for one year, he was left to serve as an instructor pilot.\n\nThe brothers had different characters. Lively, very active, cheerful Boris and silent, unhurried, seemingly in no hurry, but always on time, Dmitry. Their service during the war also turned out differently. Boris was stuck in school for a long time. He was an excellent instructor, and, despite his numerous reports asking to be released to the front, the authorities did not want to part with him.\n\nDmitry joined the active army in June 1941. He did not go through instructor school, but compensated for this with hundreds of training missions on the I-16 fighter. Finally, in December, the long-awaited flight to the front in Crimea, to the 45th Fighter Aviation Regiment, took place. We had to quickly master new equipment, because the regiment flew Yak-1 aircraft.\n\nThe first success was achieved on April 9, 1942. In the battle over the Arabat Spit, Dmitry shot down a German Ju-88 bomber with a well-aimed burst. No one could call this victory an accident. It was clear to everyone that a new super-pilot had appeared in the sky, and he resolutely got down to business. On May 9, 1942, Dmitry shot down three Ju-87s at once and rightfully took his place among the Soviet aces, bringing the number of victories to 6.\n\nIn that memorable battle, he himself was shot down and, having lost consciousness, descended by parachute. I came to my senses only after two days in the hospital. Doctors said that all this time he was fighting: his hands moved as if he was flying an airplane, and at times his muffled voice could be heard giving orders to attack. The contusion turned out to be very serious, it came to the point of issuing a medical opinion: to remove the young pilot from flying... forever. A normal person would have come to terms with this decision, but this obsessed man did it his own way: after spending about two months in hospitals and failing to get the flight ban lifted, he fled back to his unit.\n\nHe made it in time, the regiment received reinforcements, and Dmitry was able to choose a wingman for himself. He took a liking to a thin, short young man. This was former chemistry and biology teacher Ivan Babak. Dmitry got it right with his choice. On November 1, 1943, guard junior lieutenant Ivan Ilyich Babak was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. He fought almost until the end of the war, recording 35 personally shot down and 5 in a group of enemy aircraft. In February 1945, Guard Captain Ivan Babak was appointed commander of the air regiment. Fate turned out to be unkind to the hero. On March 16, 1945, while performing a combat mission, his plane came under anti-aircraft fire and the pilot was captured, from where he was released only after the Victory. Fortunately, he avoided the fate of many who returned from captivity and was again entrusted with command of the regiment. After demobilization, Babak returned to school, where he worked as a teacher and then as a school director.\n\nAfter returning to the regiment, Dmitry Glinka literally the next day - July 13, 1942 - shot down a twin-engine German bomber Xe-111. The crew of this one of the best bombers in the world at that time consisted of five people. Shooting in all directions and not allowing anyone to get closer to him, he presented a rather difficult target. Therefore, the victory won by Dmitry was very significant.\n\nDmitry was one of the “old men”; through his example, many learned the most complex science of winning, and he generously shared his experience and knowledge with everyone. He chose the simplest call sign for himself, just two letters - “DB”, and everyone in the regiment knew that if in the air it sounds: “I am DB, I am DB,” it means that Dmitry Glinka is nearby, there will soon be another victory.\n\nThe regiment fought heavy, exhausting battles, and in mid-September, having lost 30 aircraft and 12 pilots, but having added 95 air victories to its combat account, a significant share of which was contributed by D. Glinka, who shot down 11 fascists, it was sent for reorganization and replenishment. All the pilots of the regiment needed this respite, but most of all Dmitry. Fatigue had accumulated from many combat missions and battles. In addition, the consequences of an untreated concussion were felt.\n\nThe regiment appeared at the front in March 1943, when a fierce battle was taking place in the skies over the Kuban. Having shot down two Me-109s and Ju-88s by the end of the month, Dmitry Glinka brought his combat tally to 15 victories. On April 24, 1943, Lieutenant Glinka Dmitry Borisovich was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. Exactly four months passed, and the second Golden Star shone on his chest. On August 24, 1943, Dmitry, having added 14 downed enemy aircraft to his record and conducted 62 combat missions, was awarded the title of twice Hero of the Soviet Union.\n\nAnd what was happening at the same time with his older brother, Boris Glinka. No matter how much he asked to go to the front, the school management in no way wanted to let the excellent instructor go. An accident helped or, as they say, providence helped.\n\nIn September 1942, the regiment in which Dmitry Glinka served was withdrawn to the rear, to the Caspian Sea. It was stationed at a training aviation base not far from Baku. There was an urgent need to replenish the flight personnel, which had been greatly reduced in battle, to give the pilots the opportunity to master new equipment, and in order to fly together, the reformed squadrons also needed time.\n\nBut most importantly, the extremely exhausted people needed to rest. Indeed, on those days when the weather allowed flights, the pilots spent almost the entire daylight hours in the sky. They descended to the ground only to refuel, replenish ammunition, and perform minor repairs. 5 or 6 sorties were not the limit. There is a known case when Dmitry rose into the air 9 times. He was incredibly strong and resilient, but everything comes to an end. Having difficulty reaching the bed, he collapsed on it and slept for 18 hours without a break. Doctors diagnosed him with severe fatigue and even recommended that he be suspended from flying for a week. But Dmitry would have betrayed himself if he had given in to the doctors. Having slept off, he again went to the sky.\n\nFinally, the time came when it was possible, after theoretical studies or training flights, to calmly walk along the streets of the capital of Soviet Azerbaijan in the distant rear. During one of his walks along the embankment, Dmitry noticed a familiar figure in a flight jacket. Not trusting himself, he quietly called out:\n\nBorya, is that you?\n\nDimka, how did you get here?\n\nFor retraining. What are you doing here?\n\nI teach people like you,” and Boris nodded with envy at his younger brother’s chest, decorated with two Orders of the Red Banner and a medal.\n\nCome with us.\n\nThey don't let go.\n\nThe brothers went to the hotel and talked all night, and in the morning they came to the regiment commander Ibragim Dzusov. It was he who helped solve a seemingly insurmountable problem. Boris was released to the front. When Dzusov was later asked how this was possible, he laughed:\n\nYes, the head of the school turned out to be a Caucasian, but it doesn’t happen that two Caucasians don’t agree. It happens more correctly, of course, but this is irreconcilable hostility for the rest of your life. And everyone wants to live happily ever after.\n\nAt that time, the famous battle over Kuban began. The Germans concentrated more than 1,000 aircraft there, while the Red Army had about 170 aircraft in the area. Aviation units and Soviet leadership began to move towards Kuban. Among them was the regiment in which the brothers served. Now our pilots were sitting at the controls of Airacobras received under Lend-Lease from the USA.\n\nThe first battle in the skies of Kuban ended with a sensation. The fact that Dmitry shot down two Ju-88s did not surprise anyone, but the two fascists Me-109 and Ju-88 shot down by Boris amazed everyone. The first combat mission, the first meeting with a formidable enemy, and such success is unthinkable! It happened on March 10, 1943.\n\nBoris quickly caught up with his brother. Having won his first victory a year later than Dmitry, he received the title of Hero of the Soviet Union exactly a month after Dmitry. On May 24, 1943 (again the cherished number 24!) he was awarded this high title, having shot down 10 enemy aircraft in the first two months of fighting.\n\nThe Battle of the Caucasus, of which the Kuban air battles were part, continued. Now it was necessary to break the notorious “Blue Line”, with this name it went down in history (in the Third Reich it was called “Gotenkopf”, literally translated as “Goth’s Head”), a powerful defensive fortification stretching between the Azov and Black Seas with a defense depth of 20− 25 km, and on the main direction - even 60 km. Up to six defensive lines, cut-off positions, three lines in depth, pillboxes, bunkers, machine gun platforms, gun trenches, a web of communication passages, and all this is covered with minefields and wire barriers (from 3 to 6 rows). It should be especially noted that while in the north the advance of Soviet troops was hampered by a mass of swamps, flood plains, and estuaries, in the south there were impenetrable mountains covered with forest.\n\nAnd above all this there were continuous air battles for three months. On some days, up to 50 battles took place, in which up to a hundred aircraft took part on each side. A kind of continuous aerial leapfrog, accompanied by the annoying roar of engines and the fumes of exhaust gases. The tasks of our bomber aviation were clear. If the enemy’s ground troops are buried in the ground and infantry and tanks cannot move them from their place, then we need to help them do this from the sky. Deliver continuous blows to the enemy’s front line, iron it out, and do not let the fascists raise their heads. But German bombers and attack aircraft also had similar goals. Therefore, fighter jets came to the fore. They were the ones who were supposed to accompany the bombers, intercept enemy aircraft, and cover ground troops.\n\nBoth brothers distinguished themselves in battles over Kuban: Dmitry became the most effective pilot there, having shot down 18 enemy aircraft in a few weeks. Boris was not far behind him, having chalked up 14 victories. There were many battles, but everyone remembered one.\n\nThis happened on April 15, 1943. The intense battle, in which our fighters had to prevent the German “bombers” from reaching the front line, ended just fine. Having dived from above and rushed through the dense formation of Junkers, Dmitry with a short burst shot down the leader in the flight of Messers accompanying about 60 Ju-88s. He was faced with another task - to tie up the lower escort group in battle. Another pair of us was supposed to start a fight from the top, and the rest of the squadron pilots were supposed to disperse the Junkers, forcing them to free themselves from the bomb load before reaching our positions.\n\nFive Messers, angry at the impudent Russian, chased after him. Dmitry rushed upward, pulling German fighters with him. Masterfully operating the car, he deftly avoided the shells of German aircraft guns, carefully monitoring enemy aircraft. Having dragged the Germans to the maximum height, Dmitry abruptly changed the direction of flight and found himself on the tail of the slightly lagging German. Another well-aimed burst - and the German, somersaulting, rushed to the ground. A few seconds later, in the next attack, Dmitry shot down another Messer, but he himself did not have time to dodge the bursts of seriously angry enemies - he was set on fire and fell to the ground in front of his comrades.\n\nEveryone returned to the unit except Dmitry Glinka. Everyone decided that he was dead. The regiment's pilots vowed to avenge the death of their comrade. They fought the most fiercely that day. 20 German planes did not return to their airfields. Boris especially distinguished himself. Just like his younger brother, he shot down three fascist planes: one Ju-88 and two Me-109. What happened to Dmitry? His comrades saw his burning plane crash into a mountain spur, but it was far away, and no one noticed whether he managed to jump out with a parachute or not. There remained a ghostly hope that he made it in time.\n\nA few days later, when Boris was on a flight, a tall, well-built young man in tattered clothes appeared at the airfield.\n\nDB is back! - joyful cries of fellow soldiers were heard.\n\nAlmost at the same moment Boris’s plane landed. The meeting of the brothers was such that everyone who was at the airfield came running.\n\nIt turned out that Dmitry managed to fall out of the burning plane and pull the parachute ring. The unconscious pilot was picked up by local residents who were carefully watching the battle. Carefully placing Dmitry on the silk cloth that saved his life, the mountaineers carried him to the nearest hospital. There the pilot came to his senses and, despite the doctors’ prohibitions, escaped to his unit a couple of days later.\n\nAnd again it sounded in the air:\n\nI am DB. I'm attacking.\n\nAnd in response:\n\nI'm BB. I understand you.\n\nOn April 24, 1943, Guard Captain Dmitry Borisovich Glinka was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union. Exactly three months passed, and on July 24 he was awarded the title of twice Hero of the Soviet Union. What had to be done in these short months for such a tangible result to come?\n\nIt turns out that we didn’t have to do anything supernatural. It was simply necessary to fight honestly and very earnestly. To fight not anyhow, but according to science, developed by him himself. “The larger the enemy, the easier it is to beat him,” said Dmitry Glinka. He had remarkable strength and incredible endurance. Extremely adventurous, if he didn’t have to refuel the plane and replenish the ammunition, he would still be rushing through the skies, finding and attacking more and more new air targets.\n\nHis “Air Cobra” with tail number “21” was known to the entire front on which he fought, and it was constantly heard on the air: “I am the DB, I’m attacking, cover.” He flew reconnaissance and bombed enemy airfields, shot at concentrations of enemy troops and equipment, covered our units from enemy bombers and, in turn, accompanied our bombers, trying to prevent fascist fighters from approaching them. In general, he did what he was obliged to do as part of his military duty, but he did it with all his heart and with all his strength, while at the same time squeezing much more out of the technology than its creators had intended.\n\nMany years later, one of his wingmen, the legendary Soviet ace, a participant in three wars (the Great Patriotic War, the war in Egypt and the war in Ethiopia), Colonel General of Aviation, Hero of the Soviet Union, Grigory Ustinovich Dolnikov, recalled in his book of memoirs “The Steel Squadron is Flying”:\n\n“...Tall, his strong-willed gaze from under short eyebrows gave his face a stern, even stern expression, and we, young people, were openly afraid of this gaze. A master of air combat, Dmitry shot very accurately from short distances, piloted with high overloads, most often without radio warning of his maneuver.”\n\nAnd here’s what another former wingman, who also later became a Hero of the Soviet Union, commander of the “Pokryshkinsky” regiment, Ivan Ilyich Babak, recalled about him:\n\n“He knew how to use the prevailing situation extremely effectively in any battle with the enemy, well organized interaction within the group... he was distinguished by the exceptional art of conducting battles on vertical lines.”\n\nIt is this art of fighting on verticals that I would like to talk a little about. Our pilots in the schools that they graduated from before the war and when it was already in full swing were taught to fly, and taught well. But how to conduct an air battle was explained to them in such a classical way that many did not have time to use this knowledge in practice; they were shot down earlier. The Germans developed special war tactics and taught them in their flight schools. Ours, those who managed to survive the first few battles, had to comprehend it in practice.\n\nGerman fighters, as a rule, climbed higher into the sky and, having chosen a suitable target below, fell on it like a stone, shot it down and climbed up again.\n\nAfter one such battle, Dmitry Glinka proposed dividing our pilots into several echelons. Some below are accompanied by bombers or attack aircraft, others higher up are tied up by fascist fighters, and still others attack the enemy from an even higher position. The regiment commander, having listened to the young pilot’s proposal, approved it. This is how the famous “Kuban whatnot” arose. In addition to the obvious superiority manifested in battle, this technique made it possible to confuse the enemy, since he did not know how many aircraft were opposing him.\n\nHere is a brief description of one of the battles carried out by Dmitry Glinka in the skies of Kuban. Our six, led by Glinka, attacked 60 Junkers, covered by 8 Messers, located above their bombers. Two groups of Soviet aircraft simultaneously attacked the Nazis. Glinka’s pair crashed into the Junkers formation and, spinning among them, opened devastating fire. The enemy panicked, dropped bombs randomly, and the Germans hurried back. Glinka and his wingman managed to shoot down three bombers. At the same time, the Soviet four, in a stubborn battle with fascist cover, were also able to defeat them, while two Messers were shot down and the rest retreated.\n\nThis is how the famous aircraft designer Alexander Sergeevich Yakovlev described this battle in his book “The Purpose of Life”:\n\n“It’s hard to even mentally imagine the picture of this battle! After all, 68 enemy aircraft directed more than 150 barrels of their firing points against our fighters. You had to have insane courage (...) to rush into battle and win victory.”\n\nThe Germans, in response, began to clear the sky with large forces of fighters before the arrival of their bombers, trying to remove Soviet fighters from it before the start of the bombing. However, patrolling, echeloned in height, made it possible to successfully solve this problem. If there was a clear surplus of German fighters, it was always possible to call the duty group for help by radio.\n\nA special mention should be made of “free hunting,” which our aces were sometimes allowed to do. It was at such moments that Dmitry Glinka could show his best qualities necessary for a true air fighter: fantastic reaction, complete affinity with the aircraft, an incomprehensible sense of distance and amazing sniper accuracy.\n\nThis is how he himself assessed what qualities a real ace should have:\n\n“A weak pilot spins in the car like a weather vane, intensely monitoring the instruments and the horizon. It doesn’t have the ease of flight, it doesn’t have that unity when you and the car are one whole. And this must be achieved.”\n\nDmitry turned out to be an excellent teacher, but he believed that personal example was the best way to educate. And he tirelessly shot down enemy planes, destroyed enemy tanks, vehicles, and batteries. He did not favor the infantry either, mercilessly destroying them in those seconds when he swiftly swept over the front line, pouring fire and lead all around.\n\nFor Dmitry, the Kuban battles were the best. With 20 victories, he became the most successful ace of that campaign.\n\nThe older brother tried to keep up with Dmitry, and sometimes even surpassed him. They were a wonderful couple, worthy of each other. It was thanks to such aces as the Glinka brothers and many of their comrades in arms that Soviet pilots first achieved air superiority in the skies of Kuban.\n\nMore and more often, the words “Glinka is in the air!” were heard in the headphones of German pilots. And the Germans did not care which brother it was, they knew that they would not get mercy from either one.\n\nThe Glinka brothers, Boris and Dmitry, fought in the same regiment and almost simultaneously became Heroes of the Soviet Union. They were real aces who gave no quarter to the enemy and always strived for victory. Real magicians in vertical battles, whose equals had yet to be found, they developed a unique style by which they could be unmistakably distinguished in the carousel of heavenly battle.\n\nBoth brothers flew into battle at the first opportunity, and it cannot be said that they were somehow charmed from enemy fire. Sometimes they got it pretty bad, and they even had to stay in hospitals, but each time, before they had time to recover, they returned to the sky, and again in their headphones they heard: “I am the DB, I’m attacking” or “I am the BB, I have entered the battle.”\n\nArticles about the exploits they accomplished regularly appeared in the front-line press, and the central newspapers did not deprive the brave brothers of their attention. Some of their battles were covered in the press by war correspondents at that time. Here's one of them. It happened in stubborn battles on the Mius Front.\n\nFor the uninitiated, I’ll explain: “Mius Front” - under this name, a German fortified area in the Donbass on the western bank of the Mius River, created back in December 1941, entered the history of the Great Patriotic War. The most fierce battles took place at the height called “Saur-Mogila”. As a result of the Donbass offensive operation, after breaking through the German defense line in the area of ​​​​the village of Kuibyshevo, the “Mius Front” was finally put to an end. The total losses of our army on the Mius Front amounted to more than 800 thousand people. Subsequently, a memorial complex was built at Saur-Mogila in memory of the feat of Soviet soldiers who died both during the assault on this height and in the entire operation.\n\nThe air battle over the Mius Front is considered one of the key ones in 1943. One day, eight Soviet fighters, led by Dmitry Glinka, protected their front line from bombing. Two planes were sent across the front line. They were obliged to warn about the appearance of fascist bombers.\n\nThis is how Dmitry Glinka told a correspondent about this fight:\n\n“We’re on patrol. From our guidance radio station, calling me with the initials of my name and patronymic, they report: “DB, you can’t see a damn thing - dust and smoke. Take a look yourself\". But I wasn't worried. After all, there are a couple of our fighters behind the front line. The guys know their job and will let you know if anything happens. Literally a minute later there was a report from the leading pair: “DB, a large group of bombers is coming.” I led my group to approach the enemy. We attacked the bombers long before they approached the target, 20 kilometers from the front line. Shot down 5 enemy vehicles. We had no losses...”\n\nAnd one more description of an air battle using a publication in a front-line newspaper. The ground warning service reported that enemy aircraft were approaching the front line. Our fighters, led by Dmitry Glinka, immediately took to the sky. The group is divided into two parts. One rises up, the other, in which the commander is located, flies towards the fascist bombers.\n\nHere is his story:\n\n“I hear a ground radio station: “Enemy fighters at an altitude of 3000 meters.” Any other time I would have gone up. But now there is no need to do this. I just conveyed the message I received to the top group. And now she is already fighting with enemy fighters. After 2 minutes the bombers I was waiting for appeared. We are also entering the battle. One after another, enemy planes, shrouded in smoke, fall to the ground. The formation of enemy vehicles was disrupted, not a single bomber reached the target...”\n\nThe elder brother, Boris Glinka, also showed courage and skill in the air. In June 1944, he was appointed commander of the 16th Guards Aviation Fighter Regiment, replacing G. Rechkalov in this post. However, less than a month later, on July 16, 1944, when Boris Glinka flew out on his next combat mission, he was shot down. The young wingman, whom Boris took as his partner for an internship, failed to protect him. Carried away by the battle, he allowed the German fighter to come within a minimum distance, and it literally shot down Glinka’s plane. Boris managed to get out of the falling plane, but in doing so he hit the stabilizer hard, seriously breaking his leg and collarbone. Long-term treatment in the hospital could not help him return to the front. The war was over for him. By that time, Boris had shot down 30 planes personally and 1 in the group.\n\nAfter recovery, Boris Glinka did not leave the army. In 1952, he graduated from the Air Force Academy and began serving as a teacher at the Borisoglebsk Military Aviation School, and after the creation of the Cosmonaut Training Center he was transferred there, where he served almost until his death. Numerous wounds received during the war did not remain without consequences, and after a serious illness, Hero of the Soviet Union Guard Colonel Glinka Boris Borisovich died on May 11, 1967. He was then only 52 years old. One of the best Soviet aces was buried at the Grebenskoye cemetery in Star City, Moscow region.\n\nDmitry also suffered injuries, and some were received not in battle, but due to a tragic coincidence. It was July 1944. There was nothing left to fly in the regiment. So five pilots, led by Dmitry Glinka, were sent to the rear for new aircraft. It was necessary to fly on a transport Li-2. When Glinka and his comrades arrived at the airfield, all the seats in the Li-2 were already taken. The pilots had to position themselves at the very rear of the car, where airplane covers lay on the floor. It saved their lives. During the flight, the plane entered low clouds, got caught on the top of the Kremenets Mountain and crashed. Only five fighter pilots survived, and even then they all received injuries of varying degrees of severity. Dmitry suffered the most. After several days of being unconscious, he had to spend another couple of months in the hospital.\n\nAfter recovery, Dmitry Glinka continued to fight successfully. He scored his last 50th victory near Dresden on April 30, 1945, shooting down an Me-109. After the Victory he was left in the army. At first he was deputy commander of the 45th Fighter Aviation Regiment, but in 1946 he was sent by the command to study. After graduating from the Air Force Academy in 1951, he commanded the 315th and 530th IAP in the 54th Air Army. In January 1954, he was appointed deputy commander for flight training of the 149th, and in 1958, the 119th Fighter Aviation Division, stationed in the Odessa region.\n\nOn January 15, 1960, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR adopted the Law on the next (third in a row) reduction of the Armed Forces by 1 million 200 thousand people. According to this Law, the division in which Dmitry Glinka served was reduced, and the 42-year-old twice Hero of the Soviet Union was forced into the reserve. But he could not live without heaven. At that time, much attention was paid in the country to the development of civil aviation, and that is where he went.\n\nThese are the words the heroic pilot said in one of his interviews at that time:\n\n“On a July morning in 1945, I was among those who threw enemy banners at the foot of the Mausoleum of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. I could retire, pick mushrooms, hunt, listen to my favorite music, and read books. But I can’t live without the sky, I can’t live without the helm.”\n\nDmitry Borisovich died on March 1, 1979. He was buried at the Kuntsevo memorial cemetery in the capital.\n\nDmitry Glinka has long been no longer among the living, but the Sukhoi Superjet 100 passenger aircraft with tail number RA-89046 and the proud name “Dmitry Glinka” regularly takes to the skies. And this is probably the best memory of the great fighter.\n\nGlinka Boris Borisovich adjutant of the squadron of the 45th Fighter Aviation Regiment (216th Mixed Aviation Division, 4th Air Army, North Caucasus Front) lieutenant.
