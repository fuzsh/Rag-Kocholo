        "text": "Britain accepted the French order, but soon regretted doing so. RAF pilots hated the P-39. Their main gripes were the drop in performance above 20,000 feet, a tendency to spin, and the difficulty to recover from a spin. They also reported that fumes would fill the cockpit after firing the guns.\n\nThe Americans faired even worse with their Airacobras. When the United States was plunged into war with Japan, its primary land-based fighters were the P-40 and P-39. P-39 pilots experienced the same difficulties as the British and also complained that the M4 cannon often jammed.\n\nAlso, the 37mm cannon was not an effective air-to-air weapon. Though it might only take one hit to bring down the fragile Zero, the slow rate of fire and drooping trajectory made that one hit improbable. And not all P-39s had the 37mm cannon; the Airacobras the British handed over to the USAAC had a 20mm cannon in its place. This type was called the P-400. It soon became the joke of the Pacific that a P-400 was a P-39 with a Zero on its tail. But, 37mm or not, the two .50 and four .30 caliber machine guns could still make short work of a Zeke. Perhaps the biggest reasons for the P-39's bad showing in the Pacific were the lack of knowledge about Japanese aircraft, numerical inferiority, and veteran enemy pilots. U.S. pilots found the Airacobra's flaws unforgivable and requested transfers to P-38 units before these problems could be resolved. In the hands of the USAAC the P-39 proved a dismal failure and seemed a perfect candidate for the title \"Worst fighter of World War II.\"\n\nOf the 9,585 examples of the P-39 built before the end of the war, 4,500 (almost half) were given to the USSR. This seems appropriate since Russia was the only country that achieved widespread success with the plane.\n\nSoviet pilots were introduced to the Airacobra beginning early in 1943. They too reported handling problems, primarily spinning. Also, they had trouble using the radio; for many this was the first aircraft they had flown equipped with a radio! These complaints were relatively minor, and overall the Russians were very satisfied with their new acquisition. They praised its low altitude speed and maneuverability, excellent structural integrity, and heavy armament. It should be noted that difficulties with the 37mm and fume infiltration reported by Western flyers were not experienced by their Russian counterparts. From 1943 'til the end of the war the so-called \"Iron Dog\" enjoyed much success in the hands of its Russian masters.\n\nAerial warfare over the Eastern Front was particularly suited to the Airacobra. There was no long-range, high-level, strategic bombing, only tactical bombing at intermediate and low altitudes. On this battlefield the P-39 matched, and in some areas surpassed, early and mid-war Bf-109s. And it had no trouble dispatching Ju-87 Stukas or twin-engine bombers. Five out of the ten highest scoring Soviets aces logged the majority of their kills in P-39s. In fact, P-39 jockeys filled the number two, three, and four spots: Aleksandr Pokryshkin (59), Aleksandr Gulaev (57), and Grigoriy Rechkalov (56).\n\nHowever, later in the war updated variants of the Bf-109 and the deadly FW-190 arrived on the Eastern Front. Bell failed to adequately improve its plane's performance to match these threats, probably because newer fighters (including the P-39's successor, the P-63 Kingcobra) made it unnecessary."
