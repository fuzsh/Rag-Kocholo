        "text": "From Country Living\n\nOnce a bachelor always a bachelor-or at least that's what most would have thought for Warren Beatty until he met Annette Bening in 1990. Recently, Beatty told TODAY's Matt Lauer that while his fans were surprised by their 1992 marriage, the famous womanizer wasn't shocked by his decision to finally settle down. \"It didn't really surprise me,\" he said. \"I always felt I wasn't trying to avoid marriage, I was trying to avoid divorce. I had no doubt when I met Annette that it was time to get married.\"\n\nPre-Bening, Beatty had quite the list of ex flames: Brigitte Bardot, Cher, Julie Christie, Goldie Hawn, Diana Ross, Carly Simon, and Barbra Streisand, just to name a few. But when he met Annette Bening, it all changed. Years before they met while working on the film Bugsy, Bening curiously asked fellow actress Glenne Headly about Beatty, according to Vanity Fair. \"Warren is my favorite director-the best director I ever worked with,\" she replied.\n\nWhile searching for his leading lady for Bugsy, Beatty took Bening out to lunch. \"It took about 10 minutes [to fall in love with her]. Maybe five,\" he later said. Beatty immediately called Bugsy director Barry Levinson to tell him he loved Bening, and was going to marry her. Once Bening was officially cast in Bugsy, he famously told her, \"I want you to know that I'm not going to come on to you.\" But once filming wrapped, the two couldn't help themselves, officially becoming a couple.\n\nAfter marrying, the couple went on to have four children (Stephen, 24, Benjamin, 22, Isabel, 19, and Ella, 16) and Beatty took what would be a 15 year hiatus while Bening picked up three Academy Award nominations for American Beauty, Being Julia, and The Kids Are Alright. In his recent TODAY interview, Beatty told Matt Lauer that \"the most important thing that's ever happened - the best thing that's ever happened to me - was Annette and having four kids.\"\n\nBut Annette and Warren have kept their kids out of the spotlight for the most part. \"It is a burden, I think, to have two parents that are well-known, so I completely respect their privacy,\" the 79-year-old explained. \"I could go on and on and on and on talking about them, because they're brilliant and fun. But no, I think you have to give them a break, and they have their privacy.\"\n\nAnnette and Warren will be sharing the screen once again on November 23, in Rules Don't Apply, a movie about film mogul Howard Hughes and Old Hollywood.
