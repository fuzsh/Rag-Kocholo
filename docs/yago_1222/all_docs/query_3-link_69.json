        "text": "Before tying the knot to Annette Bening in 1992, Warren Beatty was known as a Hollywood lothario — but that all changed when he met the beautiful and talented actress. Now, a friend is spilling on how the couple has kept that spark alive nearly three decades later.\n\n“They love going out for dinner, which they rarely did when the kids were growing up,” the anonymous friend told Closer Weekly. Bening and Beatty share four children: Stephen, 28, Benjamin, 25, Isabel, 24, and Ella 19.\n\nLike many parents, the pair focused on their family while the kids were young, but are now embracing an empty nest with more date nights. “They enjoy museums and the theater, and they see every film they can. They just love being in each other’s company,” their friend revealed. “Annette still enchants Warren and she is still besotted with him. They never tire of each other.”\n\nThat passion began for Beatty when the pair met for lunch before they started working together on the film Bugsy in 1991. According to the New York Post, after sharing the meal and a short walk together, the actor returned to his office and told the film’s director, Barry Levinson, “I love her and I’m going to marry her.” He wasn’t wrong!\n\nTheir marriage shocked pretty much everyone at the time, largely due to Beatty’s reputation for being a lady’s man (he’s rumored to have romanced over 12,000 women). Bening obviously knew about his past, but he was quickly able to convince her that he was ready to become a one woman man. “It didn’t really surprise me,” he explained to TODAY in 2016. “I always felt I wasn’t trying to avoid marriage, I was trying to avoid divorce. I had no doubt when I met Annette that it was time to get married.”\n\nBeatty and Bening celebrated their 28th wedding anniversary on March 3, proving he knew exactly what he was talking about! Here’s hoping they have plenty more years of marital bliss together."
