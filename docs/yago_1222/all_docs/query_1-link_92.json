        "text": "Julie Christie Tribute\n\n“Before I met Warren, I had been nominated for an Oscar (The Grifters, released in 1990) and that was my first brush with anything vaguely connected with fame. I never thought my life would become newsworthy.”\n\nBut as Bening stars in her latest film, 20th Century Women, she tells how she won the day by being a thoroughly modern woman. She’s worked, had four children, insisted on independence, stood up to Beatty when necessary and has never been afraid to fight her corner.\n\n“I knew all about Warren’s reputation as a ladies man,” she says. “I would have to live on another planet not to have done. But that was never an issue. I did not start a relationship with him on the basis that it was going to end quickly. It was started because I fell in love with him.”\n\nBeatty revealed that although they co-starred in his 1991 film Bugsy, they did not begin a relationship until two days before the end of filming. But they made up for lost time by starting a family with daughter Kathlyn, now 25, born on January 8, 1992, conceived on the first date.\n\nIn another twist of life, fitting very much what is openly discussed these days – being transgender and undergoing sex changes – Kathlyn has become a man named Stephen. Beatty broke his silence on the subject just three months ago in an interview with an American magazine.\n\n“He is a genius and my hero,” he said. “As are all my children.” He and Bening also have Benjamin, 22, Isabel, 20, and Ella, 16. “Sometimes life just takes over, as it has taken over with four kids, in a way that has been more wonderful than I could have imagined at an earlier age,” added Beatty.\n\nSo what is Bening’s view? “We want the same things,” she says. “Having that shared purpose of children is part of it. In some ways we are alike and in some ways very different. But the differences, I think, help us. There is some fire there.”\n\nThe fire seems to have burned more brightly for Bening’s career in the last decade – she has now accumulated four Oscar nominations as Best Actress, the most recent for the 2010 film The Kids Are All Right, while Beatty has steered clear of movies altogether.\n\nShe explains: “I have always been happy to get back to work. And although I am one of four children and had four children myself, I am no more an expert at bringing up families than anyone else.\n\n“I like my life, so I stumble my way along. We change as we get older – and I like getting older in a way. I am impulsive. My insecurities are no less. When I was younger, I thought it would get easier. I thought there would come a day when I would walk on to the film set with something good and you think: ‘Oh, yeah – I now know what I am doing.’\n\n“But the truth is that when you have a good script, you think: ‘Great script, great director.’ And then: ‘Oh, no. Can I find those moments? In that moment when they are ready when the camera is set to go, can I do it?’\n\n“That is the thing when I talk to acting students. It is so NOT about when you are ready, it is when everyone else is ready. When I first started doing movies I worked with experienced film actors. I would think: ‘How did they know that?’ I also think it is a reason why people in Hollywood get a little crazy. That pressure makes you neurotic.”\n\nShe does not seem the slightest neurotic about her new role in 20th Century Women as a single mum bringing up a teenage boy in 1979.\n\n“We sometimes talk about the past as if it was a wonderful time, but my character was brought up in the Great Depression – not a good time at all – and during the 1970s had to deal with gossip and prejudice as she struggled alone. Things are so much better today. We need to appreciate the times in which we live.”\n\nHer own upbringing was different. “My parents married after the war and my mother very much wanted to be at home, having children, and my dad went to work to earn the money,” she relates.\n\n“For most people today, it is not enough to have just one parent working. There is much more education and women’s liberation, so that is another reason why we have moved on in life.\n\n“It is genuine progress, which is there for all to see. I have been able to take my time and do things later in life – a luxury which women a generation or two before did not have. I was 30 before I made my first movie and 32 when I became a mother for the first time.”\n\nBut she admits that life was far less complex for her parents’ generation. “They did not question themselves constantly about whether they should do this or that,” she says. “They were in a very practical set-up.\n\n“There was a lot less literature about parenting, marriage and life. There were not news programmes about it. We are now inundated with philosophy. They were instinctive and simply got on with it.”\n\nBut, like it or not, Bening and Beatty still live a large part of their lives through movies. He produces, directs and stars in the forthcoming Rules Don’t Apply, with Bening co-starring, released in March around the time of their silver wedding anniversary.\n\nThe film, set in the Hollywood of 1958, is a romance between a young actress (played by Lily Collins, 27-year-old daughter of British rock star Phil Collins) and a driver employed by the reclusive fi lm mogul Howard Hughes, played by Beatty.\n\nThe relationship is under threat because Hughes notoriously did not allow any romance between his employees. Bening plays the wary and strict mother of the young actress. “It was a long filming process,” she says. “Warren always likes perfection.”\n\n● 20th Century Women is released on January 27. Rules Don’t Apply is released on March 10."
