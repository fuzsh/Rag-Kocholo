        "text": "Warren Beatty is one of the most famous actors in the latter half of 20th century - but his off-screen romances have earned him almost as much attention as his on-screen achievements.\n\nAt age 85, he is still one of only two filmmakers to be nominated in four Oscar categories, a feat that he pulled off twice. (The other being Orson Welles). Beloved for his boyish charm and famous mop of hair, Beatty seduced America... and almost every famous woman in Hollywood.\n\nHis list of former paramours is lengthy, and almost all are celebrated beauties.\n\nGiven his exalted status in Tinseltown, he's been nicknamed: 'a samurai of sex,' 'The Prince of Hollywood,' 'the Boss,' 'the Pro.' Diane Keaton, a former girlfriend and his co-star in 'Reds,' once described him as a 'collector's item, a rare bird... Warren was stunning.'\n\nBeatty's well-documented romantic history - and all of the ups and downs involved in it, from Joan Collins' surprise pregnancy and abortion to his affair with Natalie Wood that sparked her divorce and left her suicidal - would well be the basis for a Hollywood movie.\n\nHowever, what was once a rather dramatic, yet seemingly-innocent tale of a movie star Casanova who finally found the love of his life in wife Annette Bening has now taken an incredibly sinister turn.\n\nThis week, news broke that Beatty is being sued by a woman named Kristina Hirsch, 63, who claims the actor groomed her for sex when she was just 14, he was 35.\n\nHirsch accused Beatty of using his 'position and status as a Hollywood movie star' to coerce her into having sex with him after they met on the set of one of his movies in 1973.\n\nIn video footage uncovered exclusively by DailyMail.com, Hirsch claimed that the abuse she says she suffered at the hands of Beatty left her suffering 'emotional damage' for decades.\n\n'In 1973 I was a 14-year-old virgin and brought and introduced to Warren Beatty on the set of The Parallax View for the purposes of sexual pandering by an adult,' she says looking directly into the camera.\n\n'I was unaware of this and from the spring of 1973 until the following January of 1974, carried on a relationship that I thought was something that was special.\n\n'It was a crime that Beatty was committing by raping me, having oral sex with me... and emotionally damaging me for the past 44 years,' she added.\n\nNews of Hirsch's incredibly damaging claims rocked the film industry, for while Beatty's history as a womanizer in the early decades of his career was well-known and well-documented, this is the first time he has been dragged into the dirty underbelly of Hollywood's long history of sexual assault.\n\nCertainly, questions linger over the appropriateness of some of Beatty's past behavior with regards to his romances; while several of his former partners still hold him in the highest regard, others have been outspoken about his less-than-stellar treatment of the women he dated.\n\nIn 1988, Cher claimed that she had a one-night-stand with Beatty when she was just 16-years-old; he was 25.\n\nThen there was the 1991 headline-making romance with Madonna, his on and off screen lover in 'Dick Tracy' when he was 54 and she was 33. She later revealed: 'He was an incredible lover. I'm not going to lie.'\n\nNo doubt Tinseltown's great seducer has left a trail of broken hearts and jilted lovers in his wake. Some, like Carly Simon, felt so scorned that she was taken to immortalizing Beatty's immense self-regard with the 1972 hit song, 'You're So Vain.'\n\nThe lyrics read: 'You had me several years ago when I was still quite naïve / Well you said that we made such a pretty pair/ And that you would never leave / But you gave away the things you loved and one of them was me.'\n\nBeatty disputes much of what has been written about him, especially as it pertains to his sexual exploits. He told Vanity Fair in 2016: 'I've had so much written about me that is made up, usually something that seems silly enough or weird enough to get remarked upon, and it's pretty much all fiction.'\n\nOne unauthorized biographer reckons that 'a conservative estimate' of Beatty's conquests would tally over 13,000 — a claim which the actor found laughable considering that he got a 'late start' by losing his virginity at age 20 —and he has been faithfully married to the actress Annette Bening since 1992. By that math, he says: 'I would have had to have been with something like three or four people a day, and nobody twice, ever!'\n\nIn a town marinated in gossip, Beatty is known to be one of Hollywood's most 'guarded' celebrities. Norman Mailer once noted that he is 'a model of discretion' for 'a man who has led a fabulously indiscreet life.' Adding, 'You don't stay alive moving from woman to woman with a loose lip for a tiller. No, his women are safe in his memories.'\n\nNonetheless, his incredible collection of conquests is mythic. A short roundup, in alphabetical order includes: Brigitte Bardot, Leslie Caron, Cher, Julie Christie, Joan Collins, Britt Eklund, Goldie Hawn, Diane Keaton, Elle Macpherson, Madonna, Michelle Phillips, Vanessa Redgrave, Diana Ross, Edie Sedgwick, Barbra Streisand (apologies to those left off).\n\nJoan Collins had an abortion during torrid affair with Beatty, who she said was 'insatiable' for sex\n\nBeatty was a high school football star who didn't set out to become one Hollywood's most famous players. He left Northwestern University after one year and headed to New York City where he played piano at a small jazz club in Midtown.\n\nSomeone suggested that he do classes with Stella Adler, the famed acting coach who taught Marlon Brando. 'I said, 'What is Stella Adler?' I was just a redneck football player from Virginia. That's how much I knew. I got lucky. I was very young.'\n\nBeatty was an instant hit after 1961 Hollywood debut in Elia Kazan's, 'Splendor in the Grass.'\n\nAround that time Beatty met and got engaged to the actress Joan Collins, who then was being heralded as Tinseltown's replacement for Elizabeth Taylor. He was 22 and she was 26 and he proposed by hiding an engagement ring in a plate of liver.\n\nShe said in the 18 months they were together, Beatty had exploded on the scene from being a 'total unknown to a hot, rising star' who 'knew how to slather on his in-your-face sex appeal.'\n\n'Although I wasn’t madly in love with Warren, he and I were actually very compatible, even if he needed to have sex several times a day, which often wore me out,' she revealed in her 2013 biography.\n\n'He likes to mould his women,' she said. 'I had to stop drinking because Warren never drank. I had to take vitamins because he did. He would be calling me 36 times a day. And he was insatiable — three, four times a day, every day. I felt like an oyster in a slot machine.'\n\n'It was quite a passionate relationship, it was quite demanding,' Collins recalled.\n\nShe fell pregnant during the course of their torrid affair, but chose to have an abortion because she said 'It would have been the death of my career.'\n\nThe couple eventually broke up just as rumors began to swirl over his budding romance with Natalie Wood.\n\nNatalie Wood attempted suicide after her affair with Beatty ended her marriage to Ryan Wagner\n\nBeatty met Natalie Wood when they co-starred in the 1961 movie 'Splendor in the Grass' when he was 24-years-old and she was 25.\n\nWhat followed afterward was a romance that drove Wood so crazy that she even considered ending her life.\n\nWood, who was married to the actor Robert Wagner at the time, said her affair with Beatty was 'a collision from start to finish' in a piece written for Ladies Home Journal, which was revealed in HBO documentary, Natalie Wood: What Remains Behind.\n\n'Warren couldn’t stop and I contributed my share of fireworks too. In fact, we were both so confused that we thought fighting and hostility meant real emotional honesty,' she wrote.\n\nAfter her tumultuous breakup with Beatty, followed by a divorce from Wagner in 1964 - Wood allegedly tried to end her life by overdosing on sleeping pills.\n\n'While she was filming The Great Race [in 1965], she felt lonely and unhappy and afraid of never being able to maintain a stable and healthy relationship, so she took enough sleeping pills to kill herself,' her daughter, Natasha Gregson Wagner revealed in the HBO doc.\n\nWood and Wagner would later remarry in 1972 until her mysterious death by drowning in 1981. To this day, Wagner is suspected of having had a hand in her demise.\n\nBefore he death she told outlets that there were no hard feelings between her and Beatty: 'Warren goes through women on an industrial scale, but he does it with charm,' she said valiantly.\n\nCher had a one-night-stand with Beatty when she was 16, and claims she 'didn't feel anything'\n\n'When I was 16 years old, I f***** Warren Beatty,' Cher told Playboy in 1988.\n\nBeatty was 25 and dating his 'Splendor in the Grass' co-star Natalie Wood at the time of their one-night-stand.\n\n'Of course, I'm one of a long list. I did it because my girlfriends were so crazy about him, and so was my mother,' she told Playboy. 'I saw Warren, he picked me up and I did it. And what a disappointment! Not that he wasn't technically good, or could be good, but I didn't feel anything.'\n\nJulie Christie was warned by friends that Beatty goes 'through women like a businessman through a dozen oysters'\n\nBeatty and the British actress, Julie Christie had a high-profile but intermittent relationship between 1967 and 1974. During that time, he publicly referred to her as his wife even though they never married, and she gave up a string of roles to be close to him.\n\nChristie and Beatty first met at the 1966 Royal Command performance of the film, 'Born Free.' The heartthrob is said to have fallen head-over-heels for Christie while watching her shake hands with the Queen, and they began dating shortly afterward.\n\nDespite their chemistry, friends warned Christie of the serial womanizer. The director John Schlesinger urged her to break up with Beatty, whom he said 'gets through women like a businessman through a dozen oysters.'\n\nThe couple co-starred alongside each other in three films: 'McCabe & Mrs. Miller,' 'Shampoo,' and 'Heaven Can Wait' (the latter two were completed after their breakup).\n\nDespite their on-again/ off-again relationship, Christie later said that her romance with Beatty is one that profoundly changed her for the better.\n\n'He gave me a political perspective, which I am very grateful for. I loved the way, say, that he would go to baseball matches and stand up in the interval and talk about getting rid of guns,' she told The Guardian in 2007. 'He would be this little tiny figure in this big baseball stadium, and I would be looking down at him, I thought he was wonderfully courageous for doing that.'\n\nBeatty later dedicated his 1981 political labor of love, 'Reds' - 'To Jules.'\n\nChristie is one of Beatty's many former loves that have remained friendly. He told People in 2016: 'When she and her husband come to Los Angeles, they stay in our guest house. We’re very close and she’s a remarkable person.'\n\nBritt Ekland said Beatty 'seduced her' with a pornographic film\n\nBeatty shared a short and passionate romance with Bond girl, Britt Ekland, after her divorce from Peter Sellers in the 1970s.\n\nEkland, 27 at the time, told Piers Morgan that she wasn't 'a very forward girl,' but was was seduced by Beatty who was five years her senior.\n\n'He took me to see a pornographic movie,' she recalled. 'I just wanted to get out of there. He had to leave too.'\n\nAsked where they went afterward she said: 'I guess back to the hotel. Wouldn't you if you were at a porn movie with me?'\n\nLater in her 1982 biography, the blonde bombshell marveled: 'I have never known such pleasure. He could handle women as smoothly as operating an elevator.'\n\nEdie Sedgwick showed up at Beatty's hotel wearing only a rain jacket\n\nIn 2016, Beatty confessed to having a 'somewhat reluctant dalliance with Edie Sedgwick' — the Andy Warhol superstar and 1960s 'It girl.'\n\nHe met Sedgwick on a night out at Max's Kansas City with a group of Manhattan's intelligentsia, that also included the famous cultural critic, Susan Sontag.\n\n'I was staying at the Delmonico Hotel, in New York, when there was a phone call from the lobby,' he remembered.\n\nThey had only exchanged a few words the night before so he was surprised to see Sedgwick at his hotel door, wearing only a yellow rain jacket and 'nothing underneath.'\n\nHe was unsure if he could rise to the surprise occasion, but she was 'insistent, flirty and nuzzling.'\n\nEventually the two fell into bed and suddenly on the television in the background they heard: 'One small step for a man. One giant leap for mankind.' Neil Armstrong became the first man to step foot on the surface of the moon. The romantic moment passed, and the two just stared at the television for the rest of the night.\n\nMichelle Phillips said Beatty was the 'love of her life' and claims they met when she caught him 'in flagrante' in her daughter's nursery\n\nMichelle Phillips, the last surviving member of The Mamas & The Papas, said that Beatty was the love of her life but he lost her because he did not know how to treat women.\n\n'Warren was The One,' she told Vanity Fair in 2007. 'I was madly in love with him.'\n\nThey first met at one of the many debauched parties, that she and her then husband at the time, John Phillips would throw in their Laurel Canyon home.\n\n'Everyone came: Ryan O’Neal, Marlon Brando, Mia Farrow, Peter Sellers, even Zsa Zsa Gabor,' said Michelle to Vanity Fair. 'One night I had to ask Warren Beatty to leave the house because he was screwing some girl in the nursery (of her daughter, Chynna).'\n\nAfter divorcing her husband, Phillips had to find ways to support her daughter alone. She called screenwriter Robert Towne and asked him to be an extra in Warren Beatty’s new movie, 'Shampoo.'\n\nAfter the scene, she recalls: 'I went into the trailer, not to start up a romance, just to say hello.'\n\nBeatty was still dating Julie Christie at the time, who Phillips claims 'had Warren wrapped around her finger.'\n\n'Julie was so cool, so beyond the Hollywood scene. He adored her, because she didn’t really go for the big-movie-star thing.' After Beatty and Christie broke up, Phillips moved in.\n\nTheir romance caused friction between Beatty and his lifelong friend, Jack Nicholson who were shooting 'The Fortune' together at the time. Nicholson was one of Phillips' former lovers, and he apparently took their own breakup hard.\n\n'Mike Nichols (the director) had to bar me from the set, because I would show up and disappear into the bungalow with Warren, and it was terribly painful for Jack,' she told Vanity Fair.\n\n'She had diamonds in her eyes when she was with Warren; I’d never seen Michelle so happy,' said longtime friend, Tamar Hodel.\n\nBeatty also proved to be a good father figure for Chynna: 'He helped her with her homework; he talked to her, and he is notorious for talking.'\n\nIn the end, Phillips bristled with his 'passive aggressiveness.' After a while, she explained, 'I couldn’t live under the same roof with him; we were fighting all the time.'\n\nYears later, Phillips said she 'fell off the couch laughing' when he told Barbara Walters in a TV interview that his relationships with women often ended because, 'they broke things off with him.' She added, 'That is what Warren makes his women do!'\n\nDiane Keaton turned down his marriage proposal and once described him as a 'collector's item, a rare bird . . . Warren was stunning'\n\nBeatty and Keaton carried out a famous romance, on and off the screen, around the 1981 making of 'Reds,' - a film he wrote, directed and starred about American communist John Reed.\n\nKeaton allegedly turned down his marriage proposal. 'Reds' costar Miriam Margolyes said, 'Diane had refused his marriage proposal, and he took it out on her.'\n\nShe explained that on set, Beatty made Keaton reshoot a scene 'about 50 times' despite having done 'it perfectly the first time.'\n\nDespite their eventual falling out, Keaton remains one of his biggest fans. She explained to Variety that his allure is that 'He is curious about everyone. He is so seductive in that regard. He makes you feel like you are the only one, the person that matters; that you are just absolutely fascinating, you know?'\n\nMadonna said he was an 'incredible lover' despite their 22 year age gap\n\nDespite a 22-year age gap, Beatty pursued a relationship with his Dick Tracy co-star, Madonna in 1990.\n\nTheir affair lasted 15 months, Madonna admitted recently to Howard Stern that Beatty lived up to is reputation in the bedroom. 'Yes, he was an incredible lover. I'm not going to lie.'\n\nIn an older interview with the Sunday Times, she said: 'He can pinpoint the day of your cycle. He has no restrictions. He says to me, 'If you misbehave, I'll just have to spank you.' I love that. Everything to him is living out his sexual fantasies.\"\n\nAs Madonna reportedly recounted to a friend, Beatty once called her from the car and said: 'I'm half a mile from your house. Take off your panties.' A few minutes later, he called again: 'I'm four blocks from your house. Take off your bra.' And again, when he pulled up outside her Malibu home: 'Now I want you to go downstairs and unlock the door. Then I want you to lie on your bed and wait for me to come to you and make love to you like you've never been made love to before.'\n\nThe hitmaker also admitted her song 'Vogue' was inspired by Warren's colorful love life and written in just a few hours.\n\nAround this time in the early 90s, Beatty was beginning to feel what he called, 'fatigue from bachelorhood.' No doubt exacerbated by his relationship with his much younger pop star girlfriend who called him 'Old man' and dragged him to gay disco parties in South Central Los Angeles.\n\nTheir flash-in-the-pan romance was all but over when he met the actress Annette Bening in 1991.\n\nAnnette Bening, 'the woman who tamed' Hollywood's most prolific womanizer\n\nBeatty met Bening on the set of his next film, 'Bugsy,' when he cast her to play Bugsy Siegel's mistress, Virginia Hill. She was 33 and he was 54.\n\nWhen he first interviewed Annette for the role, he told her: 'I want you to know that I’m not going to come on to you.' But as soon as filming ended, their relationship took off quickly.\n\nThe couple married in 1992 and went on to have four children. Thirty years later, their relationship stands the test of time.\n\nIn a 1991 Vanity Fairy profile with Normal Mailer, Beatty said: 'That phrase, 'until death do us part,' I always said if you're going to stand up and make this sort of promise, then you really ought to keep it.'\n\nHe added, 'The highest level of sexual excitement is in a monogamous relationship.'"
