With a career spanning over four decades, she is known for her versatile work across screen and stage. Bening has received numerous accolades, including a BAFTA Award, two Golden Globe Awards, and nominations for five Academy Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award and two Tony Awards, making her one of few artists nominated for the Triple Crown of Acting without winning.\n\nA graduate of San Francisco State University and the American Conservatory Theater, Bening started her career on stage with the Colorado Shakespeare Festival company in 1980, and played Lady Macbeth in 1984 at the American Conservatory Theater. She made her Broadway debut in the Tina Howe play Coastal Disturbances (1987) for which she received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play. Making her film debut in 1988, she gained further recognition for her role in The Grifters (1990), for which she received her first Academy Award nomination. This acclaim continued throughout the 1990s and 2000s with further Oscar-nominated performances in the comedy-dramas American Beauty (1999) and Being Julia (2004), which respectively won her the BAFTA and Golden Globe for Best Actress.

Her mother was a church singer and soloist, and her father was a sales training consultant and insurance salesman.[5][6] Her parents, originally from Iowa, were practicing Episcopalians and conservative Republicans. She is of mostly German and English descent.[7][8]\n\nThe youngest of four children, she has an older sister Jane, and two older brothers Bradley and Byron. The family moved to Wichita, Kansas, in 1959, where she spent her early childhood. When Bening was in elementary school, her father relocated the family to San Diego, California, where she spent the remainder of her youth.[9]\n\nShe began acting in junior high school, playing the lead in The Sound of Music. [10] She graduated in 1975 from San Diego's Patrick Henry High School, where she studied drama. She then spent a year working as a cook on a charter boat taking fishing parties out on the Pacific Ocean, and scuba diving for recreation. Bening attended San Diego Mesa College and graduated with a degree in Theatre Arts at San Francisco State University.[11]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\n1986–1999: Initial work, breakthrough and rise to prominence\n\n[edit]\n\nBening began her career on stage with the Colorado Shakespeare Festival company in 1980,[12] and appeared in plays at the San Diego Repertory Theatre. She was a member of the acting company at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco while studying acting as part of the Advanced Theatre Training Program. There, she starred in such productions as Shakespeare's Macbeth as Lady Macbeth. Bening also starred in productions of Pygmalion and The Cherry Orchard at the Denver Center Theatre Company during the 1985–86 season. She made her Broadway debut in 1987, garnering a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actress in a Play[13] and receiving a Theatre World Award for her performance as young photographer Holly Dancer in Coastal Disturbances. Bening made her film debut in The Great Outdoors (1988), starring Dan Aykroyd and John Candy. Her next role was as the Marquise de Merteuil in Valmont (1989) opposite Colin Firth.\n\nBening achieved her breakthrough with her performance as con artist Myra Langtry in the neo-noir crime thriller The Grifters (1990), for which she earned her first nominations for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.[14] In 1991, she portrayed Virginia Hill in Barry Levinson's biopic Bugsy, alongside Warren Beatty. For Bugsy, she received her first nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama. Bening co-starred with Harrison Ford in Regarding Henry. In 1994, Bening and Beatty starred together again, in Love Affair. In 1995, Bening played a leading role as an environmental lobbyist in The American President with Michael Douglas, a role she followed with Tim Burton's sci-fi spoof Mars Attacks! (1996), and The Siege (1998), a thriller with Denzel Washington and Bruce Willis.\n\nBening garnered acclaim for her starring role in Sam Mendes' directorial debut film, American Beauty (1999). She starred opposite Kevin Spacey in the dark comedy-drama about a man suffering a mid-life crisis in 90s American suburbia. The film won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture. For her performance as Carolyn Burnham, a materialistic wife engaging in an affair, Bening won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role, in addition to her first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress[15] and her second nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama.[16]\n\nIn 1999, Bening returned to the stage for the first time in 10 years playing the title role in Hedda Gabler at the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles Times praised her performance saying \"Bening uses her vocal instrument to fine effect, without throwing it around... In the movies you don't always hear what Bening can do with that voice, especially when she's playing virtuous, \"sensible\" types... But Ibsen's antiheroine—thwarted sensualist, a woman wrestling with her inner troll, belle of a ball that never comes—is neither virtuous nor sensible. She's no easy-to-read villain, either, nor a mere vindictive brat, though plenty of actresses have reduced her thus. Bening lays into the venomous sarcasm mighty heavily, but she's cagey enough to avoid reductive extremes.\"[17]\n\n2000–2014: Established actress\n\n[edit]\n\nBening starred in other films, including In Dreams (1999) and What Planet Are You From? (2000). Bening played Sue Barlow in Open Range (2003). She earned critical acclaim for playing the eponymous lead in the comedy-drama Being Julia (2004).

The following year, she starred as Irina Arkadina in The Seagull and as Dr. Cait Morris in Life Itself (2018).\n\nIn 2019, Bening returned to the Broadway stage after a 32-year absence.
