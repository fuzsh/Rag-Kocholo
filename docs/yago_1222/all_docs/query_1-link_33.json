So they sent shock waves through Hollywood when Bening tamed Beatty, turning him into a doting husband and father. And the two seemed to defy the Hollywood odds, with their stable marriage and big family, so we were shocked to hear that they may be headed for Splitsville.\n\nAccording to the New York Post, reporters at the Deauville Film Festival in France, where Bening was recently promoting her new flick, The Kids Are All Right, were told that Annette's family and husband were off limits, sparking talk that Beatty and Bening's marriage is on the rocks.\n\n\"The blackout immediately amped up speculation by the press corps of an impending split,\" one journalist told the Post.\n\nRumors had already been circulating after Beatty was notably not by his wife's side during recent press events. In fact, no one's seen the the two together since early August! So what's finally pulling these two apart after all these years? Well, it's not what most naysayers thought would be the problem—yes, we're talking about Warren's infamous wandering eye. Now that the actor is in his 70's, he's probably a little too old for that stuff anyway, and by all accounts, he's remained faithful during his entire marriage to Annette. His Wandering Eye. What Does It Mean?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo, according to the National Enquirer, Bening and Beatty are fighting over their 18-year-old daughter's decision to have gender-reassignment surgery. Kathlyn Beatty, the oldest of the couple's four children, currently attends college as a man and is known by her classmates as Stephen Ira. According to the tabloids, she's allegedly ready for a sex change operation, which has left her father heartbroken and created a divide between her parents. Annette, who plays a lesbian in her new film, reportedly supports her daughter's decision and has agreed to pay for the surgery, but looks like dad isn't ready to let go of his little girl yet. Chaz Bono Speaks Out On Sex Change\n\n\"Annette accepts that Kathlyn wants to surgically become a man, while Warren is still trying to come to terms with it,\" a source told the Enquirer.\n\nBut given that it is the Enquirer, and Bening's publicist called recent reports of trouble on the homefront \"ridiculous,\" we'll wait to jump to any conclusions.
