        "text": "At a salute held by the Museum of the Moving Image earlier this month in New York honoring Annette Bening, the actress and her husband, actor and filmmaker Warren Beatty, shared different, but equally amusing, stories about their courtship.\n\nThe two met when Bening expressed interest in appearing in Beatty’s film, Bugsy.\n\nBeatty said he arrived before Bening at the restaurant where they were to meet, and was told she might be a bit late. “I was hungry, I was starving, they brought me an appetizer of the most incredibly delectable garlic chicken. Suddenly Annette showed up, walked in, sat down and we began talking. I can only tell you I was simultaneously awestruck, dazzled, disconcerted, galvanized, inspired, at a loss for words, carried away. I had completely lost interest in the garlic chicken, and it was at that moment I now know that I began to change the direction of my life.”\n\nFor her part, Bening said Beatty is “well-known for being popular with women. Some say he would look at them and they would be swept away. With me it was different, when he looked at me I got pregnant.”\n\n“We were working on Bugsy. He was being very professional, I was being very professional, and we movie-kissed, that’s different than a real kiss. We went out to dinner, now we’re tiptoeing, and we went to his house. We’re in his kitchen and he is like, ‘Do you want to have a baby with me?’ I said yes. Some people do things differently, they get to know each other, date, fight, get back together, get engaged, live together, get married, have children. We didn’t do that—we just did it the other way. He looked at me and I got pregnant.”\n\nLess than a month after the premiere of Bugsy, in December 1991, Bening gave birth to the first of her and Beatty’s four children; they were married in March 1992.\n\nNot surprisingly, Bening received kudos from many of the guests at the gala. Among these was the actress Cherry Jones, who appeared with Bening in Mother and Child, in which Bening portrayed an unwed mother who had given up her baby for adoption, and Jones a nun.\n\n“I saw seven exquisite takes, each unique, each surprising, with incredible depth. I was completely enchanted, it was an acting lesson I will never forget,” Jones said.\n\nPeter Turner--the British actor who, as a young man, had an affair with the Academy Award-winning actress, Gloria Grahame, and wrote a memoir about this, Film Stars Don’t Die in Liverpool, which was made into a film released earlier this month starring Bening as Grahame and Jamie Bell as Turner—called Bening’s performance in the film “incredible, layered, interesting, funny, moving—it’s the kind of performance that changes people.”\n\n“A lot of writers don’t like films made of their books. But I think this is fantastic,” he added.\n\nBening said she and Bell did many interviews about the film, including one in which they were asked for advice for up and coming actors.\n\n“I went into a long, convoluted answer about I don’t know what. Jamie said, ‘The important thing is to be yourself,’ and I’ve thought about that so many times since that evening. Of course, it’s a very simple, very profound thing to say. That is why Jamie has remarkable talent, not only as an actor, but also as a person, which is, of course, much more important. Being yourself for a lot of actors is the hardest thing. He has that ability, and I feel very grateful to him,” Bening said.\n\nShe also called on her fellow artists to continue to try to “move people, entertain people, enliven people. . . .We’re part of something that’s full of hope and love and acceptance and openness, and our voices will be heard. We’ve just got to keep the faith.”"
