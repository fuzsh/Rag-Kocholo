        "text": "Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel\n\nWhen the “SexyBack” singer married actress Jessica Biel, it seemed that they had one of the most adorable relationships. The talented couple was known for their frequent appearances on the red carpet and adorable social media posts.\n\nBut in recent years, Justin has come under fire for his past behavior with his ex, Britney Spears. He also ignited a gossip storm when he was snapped getting a bit too close to his “Palmer” co-star, actress Alisha Wainwright. In response to the criticism, the couple admits they work hard to weather the “ups and downs.”\n\nVictoria Beckham and David Beckham\n\nWe know what you’re probably thinking, Posh and Becks have been #CouplesGoals since the two got together in the late ‘90s. While the former Spice Girl and the soccer sensation have been together for more than two decades, their relationship hasn’t always been smooth.\n\nSince they began dating, there have been rumors of David’s infidelity. The British tabloids pounced on the couple after Rebecca Loos, David’s former PA, revealed that the two had an affair. Thankfully, those claims are now behind the couple and they seem stronger than ever!\n\nJustin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin\n\nThere was no shortage of tears from Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez fans when the pop star announced his marriage to model Hailey Bieber. Given their tumultuous dating history, and Justin’s habit of running back to ex-Selena whenever times got tough, many Jelena fans thought they would see their favorite couple rise once again.\n\nUnfortunately for them, Justin and Hailey tied the knot in 2018 sending shockwaves across the celebrity entertainment world. The couple seems happier than ever, aside from the occasional trolling that Hailey still receives from diehard \"Jelena\" fans.\n\nIan Somerhalder and Nikki Reed\n\nWhen it comes to navigating friendships and relationships, most people abide by the code “don’t date your friend’s ex.” \"Twilight\" actress Nikki Reed obviously didn’t get that memo when she began dating actor Ian Somerhalder — the ex of her best friend, actress Nina Dobrev. The two married just months after Nikki’s divorce from her first husband was finalized.\n\nSome believe that Nina left “The Vampire Diaries” (the show that she and Ian starred in opposite one another) because of Ian and Nikki’s relationship. Though the couple insists that the three are friends, many fans still find their whole relationship questionable. Talk about a vampy love triangle!\n\nJohn Legend and Chrissy Teigen\n\nMusician John Legend and his wife Chrissy Teigen are often considered to be one of the most divisive couples in show business. Though it was cute at the beginning of their relationship, fans have grown tired of Chrissy’s often constant oversharing of their marriage.\n\nThings got even more controversial when Chrissy was allegedly engaging in some not-so-nice behavior on social media. Fans feared that Chrissy’s bullying would affect his career. Though the two are certainly less in the spotlight than they once were, they have remained together much to our surprise.\n\nChris Pratt and Katherine Schwarzenegger\n\nWhen Chris Pratt and comedic actress Anna Faris announced their separation, it’s safe to say that the internet lost it. Fans had placed so much hope in the adorably hilarious couple and were shocked to see that it didn’t work.\n\nFans even speculated that Chris left Anna after getting more famous (and buff!). While we’ll never know exactly what happened in their relationship, many fans have had trouble accepting his new marriage to Katherine Schwarzenegger (yes, Arnold’s little girl). Despite the frequent criticism directed at the new couple, they seem to be happily married.\n\nKevin Jonas and Danielle Deleasa\n\nTalk about a vacation to remember — when Danielle Deleasa met Kevin Jonas on a trip to the Bahamas, the New Jersey natives instantly clicked. The former hairdresser had no idea that Kevin’s band, The Jonas Brothers, would become the pop phenomenon they are today.\n\nAs their fame grew, Danielle began to experience the pitfalls of dating a teen heartthrob. She was subjected to online vitriol directed at her by both trolls and Jonas Brothers superfans. Thankfully, she has shrugged off the criticism and is still happily married to the oldest Jo-bro.\n\nJulia Roberts and Danny Moder\n\nWe think we know the secret behind Julia Roberts’ signature megawatt smile — it’s her happy relationship with cinematographer Danny Moder. As one of the biggest stars in the world, many wondered who Julia would settle down with. After dating some of the most famous actors, Julia decided to date a lesser-known person in entertainment.\n\nShe met Danny on the set of her movie “The Mexican,'' and the pair tied the knot in 2002, much to the surprise of the entertainment world. The couple must be doing something right because they’ve been married for more than 20 years!\n\nJerry Seinfeld and Jessica Sklar\n\n“Seinfeld” may have been a “show about nothing,” but Jerry Seinfeld’s romance with Jessica Sklar definitely is something. The two met at a Manhattan gym in 1998.\n\nThough sparks flew, there was one problem — Jessica was actually married! She soon divorced her husband and married the comedian a year later. Though her ex-husband told media outlets that the couple had “no respect for decent values” (ouch!) that didn’t put an end to their controversial love story. The pair have been married for more than two decades.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio and Camila Morrone\n\nIt goes without saying that Leonardo DiCaprio’s type seems to be models who are decades younger than him. In fact, his specific dating preference was even made into a joke at the Oscars. We’re sure he didn’t find it that funny!\n\nAfter being linked to various models, Leonardo stepped out with Camila in 2018. With more than two decades between them, the couple has received much criticism. In response to the comments, Camila hopes “people learn to live with a little less hatred.”\n\nNick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra\n\nWhen Nick Jonas slid into Priyanka Chopra’s DMs, he had no idea their relationship would cause so much commotion. The pop star fell for the “Quantico” star and former \"Miss World,\" despite Priyanka being about a decade older. Their age gap quickly made them a target for countless internet trolls and comedians.\n\nThough the criticism didn’t keep the couple from tying the knot and starting a family, Priyanka doesn’t understand why when it’s an older man and younger woman no one cares and that “actually people like it”. She’s unfortunately right it seems!\n\nMo’Nique and Sidney Hicks\n\nIn 2006 actress and comedian Mo’Nique sent the gossip mill into overdrive when she revealed that she and her husband, Sidney Hicks, were in an open relationship. Mo’Nique revealed to \"Essence\" magazine that the idea was hers, contrary to what many people assumed.\n\nHer controversial relationship has often made her the subject of many jokes. But all that criticism doesn’t matter to the couple. Sidney stated that the change in their status wouldn’t “change the dynamic of our relationship.” The two even launched their own podcast about the subject called “Open Relationship.”\n\nPatrick Dempsey and Jillian Fink\n\nThanks to the popularity of “Grey’s Anatomy,” the world wanted to know — who was the lucky Mrs. McDreamy? It turns out that while Patrick Dempsey is a huge star in film and television, his wife is better-known off the screen.\n\nPatrick met Jillian Fink, a makeup artist and hairstylist to the stars when he stopped by her salon. After marrying in 1999, the couple went through a rough spot in 2015 when they announced their separation. Much to the surprise of everyone, they called off their divorce and are still happily married today.\n\nJodie Turner-Smith and Joshua Jackson\n\nJodie says Joshua Jackson loves that she is obsessed with him. She watches videos of the “Dawson’s Creek” actor whenever they are apart. Yet their blissful true love story has not escaped prejudice. Turner-Smith said she was actually shocked at the reactions of some people.\n\nIt came from within her own community. “In America, interracial dating or marriage is not something that is as accepted,” she said. Not giving too much energy to “the horrific things that people were saying” taught her to keep things to herself. As of late 2023, the couple announced their divorce.\n\nCarla Bruni and Nicolas Sarkozy\n\nItalian-French singer Carla Bruni has decidedly mesmerized former French President, Nicola Sarkozy. They met at a dinner party in 2007. Sarkozy was Bruni’s first husband, while she was his third wife.\n\nIt’s rumored that the president is actually quite sensitive about their height difference, yet he hasn't let that stop him from marrying her. Still, whenever they visit other states, Bruni wears flats. It’s all not much of a secret that Sarkozy wears heeled shoes to try to square up with his wife’s height.\n\nOmari and Jae Hardwick\n\nOmari Hardwick the actor from the hit show \"Power\" is well known for starring in many movies and even collaborating with Spike Lee at one point. The two eventually collaborated on a little project called children together.\n\nJae also has a background in communications and entertainment and even worked in NBC's Primetime Entertainment Publicity Department. Even though their fans and people in the entertainment world were ambivalent about their relationship, they stuck by each other's side.\n\nPeter Dinklage and Erica Schmidt\n\nPeter Dinklage was born with achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism. The condition hasn’t stood between him and a stellar career, celebrated by a host of loving fans. Dedicated though his fans may be, there’s someone whose love for Dinklage we can’t parallel — Dinklage’s wonderful wife, American actress Erica Schmidt.\n\nThe pair got married in 2005. Whenever Dinklage is asked about his family, he delivers some touchingly beautiful answers. When one interviewer asked about his wife, Dinklage replied, “she’s very inspiring. She’s definitely the artist of the family. I am just the TV actor who pays the bills.”\n\nDaniel Radcliffe and Erin Darke\n\nHarry Potter is a grown-up now. Although at 5’5” it doesn’t look that obvious. In one of his post-Harry Potter projects, \"Kill Your Darlings,\" he plays the famous Beat poet, Allen Ginsberg. It was on the set of this film that he also happened to meet the love of his life.\n\nErin Darke is a fellow actor, starring regularly in both film and theater. She is also known as Cindy, in \"Good Girls Revolt\". Although Darke is two inches taller than Radcliffe, they seem to be going strong. No spells or love potions needed for this one!\n\nJessica Alba and Cash Warren\n\nIt’s not just male celebrities who fall in love with less famous spouses. In 2005, Jessica Alba met her future-husband Cash Warren when he was working as a director’s assistant on her superhero movie, “Fantastic Four.”\n\nWhile that movie bombed, their relationship didn’t. The two began dating and later tied the knot. Many people were surprised that Jessica would date a non-celebrity person considering how famous she is. Not only that, but she often topped the lists of Hollywood’s most desirable women. The two have proved everyone wrong with their long-running marriage and beautiful family.\n\nDavid Foster and Katharine McPhee\n\nFrom \"American Idol\" to the small screen, few predicted the success of “Smash” actress Katharine McPhee. Even fewer would have predicted that she would be married to musician David Foster — a man more than 30 years older than her!\n\nIt turns out that their relationship goes back, like way back. David mentored Katharine on “American Idol,'' and even performed at her first wedding! Between their age gap and David’s multiple ex-wives, few thought they would last. This surprising couple, however, has proved everyone wrong by not only still being married but even welcoming a child together!\n\nLisa Bonet and Jason Momoa\n\nBonet is 5'2\" and 12 years older than Momoa, but he stands taller than her at 6’4”. Many disapprove of an age gap so big. Nevertheless, the couple didn’t really concern themselves with their height and age differences.\n\nMomoa even took on the role of stepfather to Bonet’s daughter, Zoe. Bonet had Zoe with her previous husband, rockstar Lenny Kravitz. But, alas, despite not caring about what the public thinks of them, they ended up breaking up in 2022.\n\nJordan Peele and Chelsea Peretti\n\nJordan Peele and Chelsea Peretti are Millenials at heart because they met online through social media. Peele was the first person to slide into her DMs, being a huge fan of Chelsea's when she was on the road to making her own web series.\n\nThe two got together 3 years later and try to maintain a low-key type of lifestyle. The producer and Brooklyn 99 star have a child together and they're usually seen on the gram showing off their funny family moments. People raise eyebrows because they come from different races, but they are just too happy together to care.\n\nSalma Hayek Pinault and Francois Henri Pinault\n\nFrançois-Henri Pinault is a French billionaire who was lucky enough to marry Salma Hayek. Salma received a lot of backlash from haters since they didn't think they were a good match, but she did not let the haters get in the way of true love.\n\nThe pair opted for two weddings: one rather intimate one with friends and family while the other one was a lavish and star-studded night in Italy.\n\nWill Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith\n\nWill Smith first met Jada when she auditioned for a role in \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\". When it comes to couples who broke down barriers, you can't help but think about these two. They have been rumored to have an open relationship, but it's hard to tell if that's actually the case.\n\nNot to mention the Oscar incident in which Will slapped Chris Rock for laughing at Jada. Whatever is going on behind the scenes, one thing is clear: they don't give a duck what we think about them and that's what makes their relationship work.\n\nZendaya and Tom Holland\n\nThe pair came to life during the \"Spider-Man: Homecoming\" film. Zendaya and Tom Holland play classmates in the Marvel film. When they attended the red carpet premiere of the film together, the height difference between them became more apparent. Zendaya actually stands two inches taller than Holland.\n\nThe two have been asked about their height difference and Zandeya said she couldn't care less. Apparently, her mom is also taller than her dad. They had their fair share of barriers to break down, the biggest one was trying to hide their relationship from the media, which must have been stressful.\n\nEllen Pompeo and Chris Ivery\n\nIf you've seen \"Grey's Anatomy\" then you can't forget Ellen Pompeo's character. She's been on the down-low with her relationship with her husband Chris Ivery whom she married in 2007.\n\nThe two met at an unlikely place: a grocery store in LA! Ellen has been outspoken about how hard it can be to be in a mixed-race relationship and have mixed-race children and has faced backlash for it.\n\nEnrique Iglesias and Anna Kournikova\n\nEnrique Iglesias and Anna Kournikova come from completely different countries with Enrique hailing from Spain and his partner from Russia. In 2001, she starred as his partner in his music video \"Escape\" and the two started dating after the filming.\n\nThe couple has gotten backlash from the public and the media for not being married. But, the two are as happy as clams even though they've not said their vows.\n\nMatt Damon and Luciana Barroso\n\nSome high-class celebrities like to stick within their circles when it comes to marriage and love affairs but Matt Damon is different. He wanted to go for someone outside of his clique and that was the day that Luciana Barroso fell into his life.\n\nWhile he was in South Beach, friends dragged him outside for a few drinks to loosen up. Little did he know that he'd find his wife bartending at the bar they were in! Some may judge them for being in a mixed relationship between a normal person and a famous person, but they are having too much fun together to care.\n\nAri Cooper and Deryck Whibley\n\nAri Cooper stands at 6’0”, half a foot taller than Whibley. Love’s ability to transcend such details as an unconventional height difference wasn’t the only wonder Whibley discovered when he met Ari.\n\nIn 2014, he suffered organ failure due to excessive alcohol consumption. He had to stay in the hospital for months, during which time his loving fiancé never left his side. He even said in an interview that she was a huge help in turning his life around. A turbulent year later, the two got married and Whibley is now happily living a sober life.\n\nCameron Diaz and Benji Madden\n\nCameron Diaz made a name for herself in movies like \"Charlie’s Angels,\" \"Shrek,\" and \"There’s Something About Mary.\" Now that the towering, blonde beauty is fresh in your mind, it’s time for you to meet this musician who, according to Cameron, makes her life feel complete.\n\nNicole Richie played matchmaker for Cameron and Good Charlotte frontman, Benji Madden. Cameron said yes to Madden’s marriage proposal in 2015, despite the obvious height difference. A fact about the couple that makes the public whisper as they pass by is that the two were only engaged for 17 days before they got married.\n\nBlake Shelton and Gwen Stefani\n\nThe fact that ska-rocker Gwen Stefani would get together with country crooner Blake Shelton was shocking enough, but rumors that they began hooking up while he was still married were even harder to believe.\n\nWhen Blake and then-wife Miranda Lambert ended their marriage in 2015, the celebrity gossip world immediately suspected that Blake’s co-host on “The Voice,” Gwen, had something to do with it. The couple also went public after Blake’s divorce - strange timing if you ask us. Though Blake and Gwen eventually married, the couple still faced controversy given their timing.\n\nKristen Bell and Dax Shepard\n\nIn both love and comedy, these guys have vowed to always be there for each other. The pair started dating in 2007. Three years later, they announced their engagement.\n\nThe two are known for airing out their dirty laundry, and they don't feel sorry about it at all. They have shared a lot about terrible fights they've had with each other. They also refuse to be referred to as \"couple goals\" because they claim that their relationship, like all relationships, is far from perfect.\n\nKevin Hart and Eniko Parrish\n\nIf you’re into comedy movies, you most probably know Kevin Hart. With such a giant reputation, it’s not obvious that Hart is just 5’4” tall.\n\nHart is actually three inches shorter than his stunning wife, Eniko Parrish. But he doesn’t take any offense to the jokes about it... most of the time. In fact, he even makes light of this height difference himself. At a recent red carpet event, he said “I don’t believe in doing things to manufacture my body to appeal to what I think people might like.” Word. Just be who you are, Kevin!\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\n\nThe British-American power couple has been making waves for their radical exit from the Royal House. Prince Harry didn't want to live in the limelight of the Royal House so he sought out the unconventional path and went for the love of his life.\n\nDespite living a life of fame and having cameras in their face almost all the time, the two just want to live a normal life with their children. Prince Harry truly wants to live an average life which is why they had to make some drastic changes to be fully happy.\n\nJamie Cullum and Sophie Dahl\n\nListen, the whole, “guys should be taller” standard is outdated. Height has nothing to do with love. Like age, it’s just a number. No couple proves this point more than the adorable Jamie Cullum and Sophie Dahl. These two are pretty well-known in their individual careers. Cullum is a singer and songwriter while Dahl is a model and author.\n\nDahl towers over Cullum by almost half a foot. Dahl once commented about their height difference, stating, “I think if we were both slightly more neurotic people, it would be crippling, but the fact of the matter is that we’re both happy. It’s cool.”\n\nJohnny Depp and Amber Heard\n\nSuperstar actor Johnny Depp met actress Amber Heard in 2009, and they started dating in 2012. Two years later, the two decided to tie the knot – when Johnny was 51 years old and Heard just 28. Essentially, this means that Depp was more than two decades older than her when they sealed the deal.\n\nHowever, things between the stars started to get seriously bumpy, and there were even allegations of physical abuse from both parties swirling around. The couple broke things off and got divorced in 2017. They have been tied up in court for years, with each star suing the other.\n\nKate Beckinsale and Matt Rife\n\nActress Kate Beckinsale, who is most famous for her roles in the 'Underworld' movies, shocked everyone when she hooked up with a man who is more than 20 years younger than her. In 2016, Kate split with her first husband, Len Wiseman, and started to date baby-faced comedian Matt Rife.\n\nAt the time of her divorce, Kate was 44 years old – not that she looked it, but this still made her over two decades older than her new boy-toy. However, things with Rife didn’t last very long, and they ended up splitting before a year had passed.\n\nBrad Pitt and Angelina Jolie\n\nAngelina made headlines when she got together with Jennifer Aniston’s ex, Brad Pitt. Although, the two dated for an entire 7 years before finally deciding to tie the knot in 2014. During their relationship, the couple had three children and adopted three others. Unfortunately, Hollywood’s “it” couple was destined to split up.\n\nBut during their time together, no one even seemed to notice the 11-year difference in age between the two stars. Pitt and Jolie continued to make headlines together, right up until they officially split up in 2016.\n\nKaty Perry and Russell Brand\n\nPop diva Katy Perry and comedian Russell Brand are no longer together, but that doesn’t make their relationship any less iconic. After all, they made headlines everywhere when they tied the knot in India back in 2010. The age difference between the couple was a modest 9 years, but it was still noticeable.\n\nWhen the stars split in 2012, fans were heartbroken. The reasons why the two broke up depend on who you ask. Reports are a mix of the fact that Katy’s success threatened Russell, and that she wasn’t enough of a philanthropist to satisfy his need to “make the world a better place.” Perry is now engaged to another actor that is around the same number of years older than her.\n\nMila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher\n\nMila Kunis actually shared her first kiss ever with co-star Ashton Kutcher when they starred in \"That ‘70s Show.\" But, it wasn’t until many years later that a romantic spark bloomed between the two. The couple made it official with their wedding, in 2015. Now they are happily living the married life, with two kids, Wyatt and Dimitri.\n\nThe two admitted that they really believe in showering and that as a family they tend to skip showers. They have received a lot of backlash from the public about this, but it doesn't seem like that has caused them to bathe more.\n\nAmber Tamblyn and David Cross\n\nThis adorable couple met on an airplane in 2007, when the actor actually asked to be sat next to the 'Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\" actress.\n\nBy 2011, the stars were engaged, despite the 20-year age gap that stood between them. In 2017, the couple welcomed their daughter Marlow into the world. Although there has been some media criticism about some remarks Cross has made, Tamblyn stands by him to this day.\n\nTom Cruise and Katie Holmes\n\nKatie Holmes and Tom Cruise were, at one point, one of the hottest couples in Hollywood. Let’s rewind a year just for a second here, to note that 2005 was the year when Tom made his infamous appearance on Oprah’s show, on which he jumped on the couch and acted insane as he professed his love for young Katie, who is 16 years younger than him.\n\nBut this didn’t derail the 'Dawson’s Creek' actress from marrying the 'Mission Impossible' star. During their marriage, Katie gave birth to the couple’s beautiful daughter Suri. The couple got divorced in 2012 after news of their indoctrination into Scientology went public, but they were definitely iconic while they lasted.\n\nBradley Cooper and Suki Waterhouse\n\nBradley Cooper started dating model and actress Suki Waterhouse in 2015. Cooper, who is 17 years older than Suki, did ultimately end up breaking things off.\n\nAlthough he spent 2 years with the young model, Cooper said in the end that he felt as though Suki was using him to elevate her career status in Hollywood. We bet the public noticed that from miles away. Sometimes the public is right!\n\nDavid Hasselhoff and Hayley Roberts\n\nThe star had married twice before he found his current love, Hayley Roberts, back in 2011. The model is a whopping 27 years younger than the actor.\n\nThe couple decided to make things official in 2017, in an intimate wedding ceremony in Italy. The two share a home in the Hollywood Hills and are rumored to live in the same neighborhood as Justin Bieber and some of the Kardashians.\n\nHayden Panettiere and Wladimir Klitschko\n\nUkrainian champion boxer Wladimir Klitschko first met bubbly actress Hayden Panettiere back in 2009. The boxer proposed to her 5 years later with an enormous engagement ring worth an estimated half a million dollars. That same year, they announced that Hayden was pregnant. But the bliss wouldn’t last forever…\n\nThe actress is 27 years old and Wladimir is 40, which separates the couple in age by 13 years. They welcomed their daughter Kaya in 2014, but they never ended up actually going through with the marriage. In fact, in 2018, they announced that they’d called the whole thing off.\n\nMel Gibson and Rosalind Ross\n\nGibson has children, 7 of which are with his first wife, Robyn Denise Moore. But after that 26-yearlong marriage came to an end, Mel Gibson found love again in the form of a 28-year old writer, Rosalind Ross.\n\nGibson and Ross first met back in 2014, when the writer was signed to work for the actor’s production company. They hit it off immediately and Rosalind fell head over heels for the Hollywood legend. Gibson is an entire 35 years senior to his current wife, but they couldn’t be happier – even if she is 10 years younger than his oldest kid.\n\nRod Stewart and Penny Lancaster\n\nRock legend Rod Stewart is one of the biggest names in the business, selling more than 100 million records over the course of his career. In 2007, he met his third wife, television personality Penny Lancaster, and decided to put a ring on it. Fans were heartbroken, but Penny and Rod had found something truly special – even with the enormous age gap between them.\n\nThe age difference between the two is a substantial 27 years, and, as disappointed as some of his female fans may be, the couple is still happily married.\n\nBruce Willis and Emma Heming\n\nYou may remember that Bruce Willis's most infamous romantic relationship was his 12-year marriage to actress Demi Moore. The two stars had three daughters together before ending things in 2000. 9 years later, Willis said “I do,” to his new wife, model Emma Heming.\n\nWillis is 22 years older than his current wife, but that shouldn’t come as a shocker since his former wife was 15 years younger than him, too.\n\nDick Van Dyke and Arlene Silver\n\nSo, we’ve seen some age differences in the high 30s on this list, but if you thought that was the thick of it – you would be wrong! Arlene is a makeup artist and dancer who first met Van Dyke in 2006.\n\nMany criticized the age gap between them – 46 years. To put this in perspective, it means Dick is nearly 5 decades older than his wife. However, the two seem very happy together and are still married today.\n\nNicolas Cage & Alice Kim\n\nActor Nicolas Cage met Alice Kim in 2004 when she was working as a cocktail waitress in a nightclub and 2 months later – they were engaged to be married. Cage, who is 20 years older than Alice, has been married twice before. Sadly, even great things come to an end sometimes.\n\nAlthough the pair did stay married for a good 12 years, they ultimately ended up getting a divorce in 2016. During their relationship, they had one son – Kal-El. If you think about this one, Kim wasn’t even legally able to order a cocktail when she said, “I do,” as she was just 20 years old and Cage, 40. If that's not a hell of a barrier to break for love, we don't know what is.\n\nEddie Murphy and Paige Butcher\n\nFunnyman Eddie Murphy has a total of 10 children, two of which are with his new wife, model Paige Butcher. The actor had been married twice before, once to the former wife of “Babyface.”\n\nEddie is 18 years senior to his wife, but you can’t tell by looking at him, because he looks incredible for his age! The couple welcomed their second child into the world in 2018 and are still happily married today.\n\nElton John and David Furnish\n\nMusic icon Elton John and filmmaker husband, David Furnish, were some of the very first voices behind civil partnerships in the UK. In 2014, they decided to make it official and legalized their marriage – after being together for nearly two decades.\n\nThe same-sex couple is separated by a 15-year age gap, which means they had two different fights to fight when it came to public opinion. But the two are just too adorable together to separate!\n\nCheryl Cole and Liam Payne\n\nLiam Payne from One Direction met his future wife Cheryl Cole in 2009, on the set of 'X-Factor', on which Liam was performing and Cheryl was sitting in a judge’s seat. Long story short, she was impressed, and the two would continue to see each other over the next several years in professional settings. Then, in 2016, the stars started to slowly reveal their blossoming relationship.\n\nEven though Liam is 10 years younger than his girlfriend Cole, it didn't seem to matter much at all in terms of how close they were. Until, of course, it did, and the couple broke up.\n\nMichael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander\n\nThe way these two met was like something pulled straight out of a fairytale, or in this case – a movie. The couple was first introduced on the set of \"The Light Between Oceans\", an adorable love story about a lighthouse keeper and his wife. However, according to Vikander, they didn’t actually speak to each other for the first several times.\n\nVikander may be 11 years younger than her husband Michael, but let’s face it, the two are both incredibly good-looking. The stars tied the knot in an intimate wedding ceremony in 2017 and have been happily married ever since.\n\nAaron and Sam Taylor-Johnson\n\nSam Taylor-Johnson met Aaron in 2009 when she directed a film that he just so happened to be acting in. The director was 42 years old and the actor — 19. But the age gap didn’t seem to have any effect on the connection they made, and they started dating not too long after the meetup.\n\nJust because they don’t have an issue with the 23-year age difference, doesn’t mean that everyone felt the same way. The couple was torn apart by several media outlets who criticized the morality of the relationship. During their marriage, the couple has had two daughters.\n\nEllen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi\n\nEllen DeGeneres is one of the biggest voices of the LGBTQ community, but when she first came out, the public wasn't really on board.\n\nStill, she met Portia de Rossi and despite the fact they have a 15-year age gap between them, they fell in love. Today, the public is all for the relationship but it hasn't always been this easy.\n\nWarren Beatty and Annette Bening\n\nDuring his legendary days, Warren Beatty was a famous womanizer. He could be seen in the arms of all of the hottest stars from the ’60s-’80s, including Diane Keaton and Madonna. But when he met Oscar winner Annette Bening on the set of his film \"Bugsy\", all of that changed, and he decided to settle down.\n\nThe Hollywood power couple tied the knot in 1992, and had four children together, including their oldest son Stephen, and their youngest daughter Ella. They are happily married despite the incredible gap in age - 22 years.\n\nJames McAvoy and Anne-Marie Duff\n\nThis talented duo met while they were filming \"Shameless\", and they immediately felt an attraction. They began to date soon after they met and were married by 2006. McAvoy is 9 years younger than Anne-Marie, who played Fiona Gallagher for the first 2 seasons of the UK show.\n\nUnfortunately, after 10 years of marriage, they decided to part ways and announced that they would be getting a divorce in 2016.\n\nAshley Olsen and Richard Sachs\n\nIt would seem that the Olsen twins share a lot more than just their faces – like their taste in older men. But while her sister married someone who is nearly two decades older than her, Ashley took an even bigger leap with Richard Sachs, who is a whole 28 years older than her. In today’s world, with people having children in their teen years, this means that Sachs is almost old enough to be her grandfather.\n\nSince the Olsens are such private people, they tend to keep most of their personal issues out of the limelight, so no one is entirely sure why, but the couple ended up breaking things off in 2017. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that Sachs was twice her age?\n\nKris Jenner and Corey Gamble\n\nJenner met her boyfriend while attending a fashion designer's birthday party in 2014. However, the two aren’t exactly overly emotional about each other, especially not in public, and it would seem that Jenner doesn’t have any (immediate) intentions of putting a ring on Gamble’s finger.\n\nBut even without PDA and wedding rings, they’ve maintained a solid romance, which is pretty incredible when you take into consideration that she is 25 years older than him.\n\nMary-Kate Olsen & Olivier Sarkozy\n\nMary-Kate doesn’t let the 17-year age difference get in the way of her marriage with billionaire Olivier Sarkozy, who just so happens to be related to the former President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy. Mary-Kate has told reporters that she enjoys spending quiet nights at home playing stepmom and cooking dinners.\n\nWhen the former 'Full House' star met Sarkozy, she hadn’t even turned 30 years old yet and he was going on 47. The couple tied the knot in 2015 but has since separated. Maybe both an age difference and a cultural gap were just too much for the two. Not all barriers can be br0ken for love.\n\nPatrick Stewart and Sunny Ozell\n\nPatrick Stewart first met Sunny Ozell in 2008, when she was working as a waitress at Franny’s in New York City. The two started spending time together and in 2013, they tied the knot. The actor, who has been married two times before, is 38 years older than his wife.\n\nThe adorable couple’s families don’t seem to have much of an issue with the age difference. In fact, Ozell’s father jokingly refers to Patrick as “son,” even though he’s actually 5 years his senior!\n\nSarah Paulson and Holland Taylor\n\nSarah Paulson is most well-known for each individual role that she’s played during her many years on \"American Horror Story.\" In the season they dubbed “Cult,” she portrays a lesbian, which as it turns out, accurately represents her personal love life. Paulson has been dating actress Holland Taylor since back in 2015.\n\nTaylor, who acted in 'The Practice' and 'Two and a Half Men', is 34 years older than Sarah. She could literally be her mother! But, the actresses' relationship continues to grow and they seem to be very happy together.\n\nHarrison Ford and Calista Flockhart\n\nHans Solo actor Harrison Ford married 'Ally McBeal’s' Calista Flockhart in 2010, which was about 8 years after they’d initially started dating. Ford told reporters that he was very much “in love” with the actress, who is a considerable number of years younger than him.\n\nThe two have a 22-year gap in age separating them. But these two love birds don’t seem to mind and have been together for over two decades now.\n\nMariah Carey and Nick Cannon\n\nMariah Carey broke a lot of hearts when she decided to tie the knot with singer Nick Cannon in 2008. At the time the two got married, Cannon was 28 and Mariah was 38. The gap in age didn’t seem to bother either of the stars, who remained happily married for quite some time. Unfortunately, they did start to grow apart, and eventually, they split up.\n\nSeveral speculations exist as to why the couple got divorced in 2016. Many swear that they were doomed from the beginning because of their difference in age, but plenty of other couples have proven that theory wrong.\n\nOlivia Wilde and Harry Styles\n\nOlivia Wilde met funnyman, Jason Sudeikis, in 2011, over a decade and two children later, Olivia left him for former One Direction heartthrob, Harry Styles.\n\nThe relationship attracted negative media attention, with her leaving the father of her children for a man who is 10 years younger than her. Still, the two ignore everyone, because they are just having the time of their lives being in love with each other.\n\nPierce Brosnan and Keely Shaye Smith\n\nPierce Brosnan has a lengthy list of blockbuster hits under his belt, including his time as 007 in four of the James Bond films from 1995-to 2002.\n\nBrosnan is pretty secretive when it comes to his personal life, something he may have picked up from playing a spy all those years. But the actor is married to Keely Shaye Smith, who he dated for 7 years between 1994 and 2011 when they ultimately tied the knot. The couple has been married ever since, despite a 10-year gap in age.\n\nCatherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas\n\nBeautiful actress Catherine Zeta-Jones is 25 years younger than her husband, actor and director Michael Douglas, but that hasn’t kept them from being happily married for over two decades. They have faced some turbulence along the way, but for the most part, things between the actors seem to be working well.\n\nDuring one interview, Catherine revealed one of her secrets to a long and happy marriage: separate bathrooms. Hey, if you think about it – that makes a lot of sense.\n\nHeidi Klum and Tom Kaulitz\n\nThere’s a common theme among most of these celebrity couples, which is that at least one of them is super good-looking. Hell, with most of them – both of them are good-looking, which is the case for Heidi Klum and her 29-year-old guitarist fiancé: Tom Kaulitz.\n\nThe 45-year-old former supermodel didn't mind the 16-year age difference and said that they’re so in love that it doesn’t matter, though she does admit that they got questioned about it quite often. Maybe people were right as the relationship didn't last.\n\nMegan Fox and Brian Austin Green\n\nAt the time they started dating, Fox had just turned legal, and Brian was over 30 years old – which means that he was about 13 years older than her. But this didn’t seem to bother either of the stars, who got married in Hawaii in 2010.\n\nWhile some weren’t certain that the relationship would last, the couple proved everyone wrong and ended up having three children. But things weren’t always so bright for the stars, who got legally separated in 2015.\n\nAdam Levine and Behati Prinsloo\n\nAdam Levine made a lot of guys jealous when he married his wife, Victoria's Secret model Behati Prinsloo, in 2014. When the attractive lovebirds tied the knot, a decade of age difference separated them, with Adam being 35 and Prinsloo, just 25.\n\nThings weren’t always smooth sailing between the stars, and they ended up breaking up for a short period of time before they actually got married, but after those initial bumps, they seemed to work things out.\n\nAlec Baldwin and Hilaria Thomas\n\nIn 2012, yoga teacher Hilaria Thomas walked down the aisle and said, “I do,” to actor Alec Baldwin. Alec basically stalked Hilaria in an NYC restaurant, and she pretty much fell in love with him on the spot.\n\nSince Thomas is in the business of health and wellness and Baldwin is an A-lister, it may be pretty difficult to tell that they’re separated by a 26-year age gap. But the couple doesn’t let the age difference get in the way of their happiness. In fact, they’re still together to this day.\n\nMatthew McConaughey and Camila Alves\n\nContrary to what some commercials may have led you to believe, Matthew McConaughey is not actually in a relationship with his car. In fact, he’s already taken by his beautiful wife, model Camila Alves. After the two met in 2006, they immediately hit it off and started dating.\n\nIn 2011, McConaughey proposed to Alves on Christmas Day, and she said yes to the actor, who is 14 years her senior. But, does age really matter when the people in question both look ridiculously good? The gap in age doesn’t seem to bother the stars, who are still happily married today.\n\nRosie Huntington-Whiteley and Jason Statham\n\nRosie Huntington-Whiteley is an English model that is best known for gracing the runways of Victoria’s Secret fashion shows, along with the covers of multiple international fashion magazines, including Vogue and GQ.\n\nHunky husband Jason Statham, also from England, is well-known for playing the scruffy, angry antihero type in a variety of films, like \"Crank\" and 'The Transporter\" movies. The actor and Huntington-Whitely have a 20-year age gap. She's also taller than him but they know how to work with what they have got.\n\nBeyonce and Jay Z\n\nQueen B and Jay Z are known as one of the most iconic couples, ever. Although they have had their ups and downs and Jay Z did manage to anger quite a few people in the past, the two have remained super strong.\n\nDespite public opinion, the two stayed together. No one can know what goes on behind the scenes, but they do seem happy together.\n\nJerry Hall and Rupert Murdoch\n\nWhen former supermodel and 20-year girlfriend of Mick Jagger, Jerry Hall, cut ties with the rocker, the world anticipated what would come next – but they couldn’t have expected that she would marry billionaire media mogul Rupert Murdoch. After all, after spending two decades with a rock star, Murdoch didn’t necessarily seem like her type.\n\nEveryone was a little bit shocked by the announcement, and critics all claimed there was no way it would last, but it seems that the 25-year age difference doesn’t matter much to the happy couple.\n\nGeorge And Amal Clooney\n\nIf there's one thing the public likes to criticize is huge age gaps. Well, the public was in luck when George And Amal Clooney started dating, as they have a 17-year age difference. Amal works with International law and human rights, while George is a mere actor.\n\nWhen they got together, many eyebrows were raised, but they have proven they can make such a relationship work, staying together and even having children!\n\nEmmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux\n\nPresident of France Emmanuel Macron surprised everyone when he announced his relationship with Brigitte Trogneux. Why? Well, she’s a little bit older than him – over two decades older, that is. When he married Brigitte, critics had a lot to say about it, but the two stayed strong and remain happily married.\n\nHe first met his wife in high school, when he was 15, and she was his teacher, which is one of the biggest reasons why some frowned upon the unorthodox romance.\n\nRhea Durham and Mark Wahlberg\n\nAmerican actor Mark Wahlberg can be pretty intimidating because of the roles he takes on. He’s known for starring in gritty films like \"The Fighter\" and \"The Departed\". He also dabbles in rap, production, and business. However, the action star seems tame when he stands next to his wife, who’s an inch taller than him.\n\nDurham is a model, so yeah, she’s tall. The height, of course, wasn’t an issue for the happy couple. Wahlberg and Rhea enjoyed their long courtship so much they decided to cap it off eight years later with a wedding! And the public can carry on saying whatever they want.\n\nMarc Anthony and Nadia Ferreira\n\nWe’ve got to hand it to Marc Anthony — the man has dated some of the most beautiful women in showbiz! He also seems to have a type — beauty queens! Before marrying J.Lo, Marc was married to former Miss Universe Dayanara Torres.\n\nToday, he’s engaged to former-Miss Universe Paraguay, Nadia Ferreira. Despite the nearly three decades between them (seriously!) Marc seems to be smitten. Though the critics have been quite ruthless when it comes to accepting Marc’s new and much-younger woman, the happy couple pays no attention.\n\nDane Cook and Kelsi Taylor\n\nWhen Dane Cook revealed that he was getting serious with his girlfriend, Kelsi Taylor, many people thought it was a joke. At almost three decades his junior, fans were beyond surprised. Even an audible laugh occurred when he mentioned their age difference on “Jimmy Kimmel Live.”\n\nNaturally, their large age gap has brought about a lot of criticism. But in typical Dane form, the comedian jokes, \"Sometimes I actually find myself saying, ‘Where has she been all my life?’ and then I realize she wasn’t alive for the first 26 years of it.\"\n\nEthan Hawke and Ryan Shawhughes\n\nCelebrities playing on the side with nannies is, unfortunately, an all-too-common occurrence in Hollywood. When actor Ethan Hawke’s relationship with “Kill Bill” star Uma Thurman ended in 2003, tabloids quickly pointed the finger at their former nanny, Ryan Shawhughes.\n\nThough the couple adamantly denied any foul play, few were convinced. Ethan claimed, \"my [first] marriage disintegrated due to many pressures, none of which were remotely connected to Ryan.\" Do they care?\n\nTori Spelling and Dean McDermott\n\nIt can be said that the public is willing to put up with a lot when it comes to gossip related to dysfunctional Hollywood marriages, but many believe that the antics of Tori Spelling and actor Dean McDermott have pushed it too far.\n\nThe two shocked the celebrity gossip world when it was revealed that they engaged in an affair after meeting on the set of “Mind Over Murder,” a made-for-television movie. After separating from their respective partners, the two married. Despite their relationship being highly criticized, Tori vowed to “make this work.” And for now, it does.\n\nKing Charles and Queen Consort Camilla Parker Bowles\n\nWe know the King and Camilla are not exactly Hollywood celebs, however, they are known worldwide, and their love story is just as famous. In one of the biggest Royal Family scandals, the world was left speechless after the late Princess Diana referred to there being “three” people in her marriage.\n\nAfter that explosive interview, Camilla became one of the most divisive women in the world. After Diana’s untimely passing and the reinstatement of Charles and Camilla’s relationship, the public did not know what to think. Though the two have faced much criticism, they are still together and forever will be.\n\nEwan McGregor and Mary Elizabeth Winstead\n\nAfter meeting on the set of the show “Fargo,” actor Ewan McGregor and Mary Elizabeth Winstead knew that they had a connection that couldn't be denied. The problem? Both were married to long-time partners.\n\nThough the couple never admitted to beginning their relationship while still married, it did seem suspicious that shortly after meeting, both called it quits with their respective partners. Fans were even more shocked when the actor thanked both Mary and his ex-wife in the same speech after winning a Golden Globe for his role in \"Fargo.\" Awkward!\n\nOprah Winfrey and Stedman Graham\n\nOprah Winfrey is one of the most important figures in the entertainment industry. While she has often been open about her life, there is one person she keeps private — her longtime partner, Stedman Graham.\n\nThough the couple has been going strong since 1986, they haven’t been immune to criticism calling for the couple to make it official. The couple, who got engaged in 1992, has famously put off their wedding to the point where they’ve just accepted being together without marriage.\n\nDennis Quaid and Laura Savoie\n\nGetting it right when it comes to love and relationships can be tough. So tough that it apparently took three marriages before actor Dennis Quaid found his soulmate, Laura Savoie.\n\nThe actor met the student at a business event. Despite their almost 40-year age gap, he says he “didn’t go out looking for an age gap” when he met her. Dennis acknowledges that while many have a problem with Laura’s age, it isn’t an issue for them. In fact, he thinks there’s “something timeless about us.”Let’s hope the fourth time's the charm!\n\nDavid Boreanaz and Jaime Bergman\n\nFans of the “Bones'' actor David Boreanaz were surprised when the usually private actor became involved in a major romantic scandal involving golfer Tiger Woods’s lover Rachel Uchitel.\n\nWhen the allegations spread, David admitted that he had a bit on the side for more than a decade, while being with Jaime Bergman. Though the couple has stayed together, they were both subject to widespread criticism regarding his behavior.\n\nJennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck\n\nLet's be honest, the past few years have given us situations that we could never have imagined happening. In 2022, we checked another thing off our “things we never thought would happen” checklist when the rise of Bennifer 2.0 emerged from the woodwork.\n\nJennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck famously dated in the early 2000s before calling it quits after allegations that Ben was unfaithful. Surprisingly, after almost two decades apart, the two rekindled their relationship, proving anything is truly possible!\n\nGoldie Hawn and Kurt Russell\n\nWhile Hollywood is full of unhealthy relationships, there are some couples who remind us that true love is real, even if it comes in a less-than-traditional form. Iconic actress Goldie Hawn has been with her partner, actor Kurt Russell for several decades.\n\nDespite never getting married (and being criticized for it), the couple continues to have one of the most beautiful and enviable relationships in show business. Goldie has often defended their decision not to wed by saying that the couple “likes the choice” of staying together versus being “bound.” They’re clearly doing something right!\n\nTilda Swinton and Sandro Kopp\n\nTilda Swinton is known for her unique look and unforgettable on-screen characters, but it turns out that her private life is just as fascinating. Tilda’s partner is Sandro Kopp, a German artist almost 20 years her junior. The actress is also surprisingly close with her first husband, John Byrne.\n\nThe three have become so close that many people wonder if they are in some sort of “throuple” relationship. Despite the salacious rumors, Tilda says that her relationship with the two men is “quite boring really” and that “life doesn’t have to be complicated.” They are a symbol of love.\n\nSimon Cowell and Lauren Silverman\n\nSimon Cowell may make the right calls as a judge on reality television shows, but behind the scenes, he doesn’t always use his best judgment. In 2013, the \"X Factor\" judge was dating celebrity Carmen Electra.\n\nThough that union was unexpected enough, things got stranger when Carmen found Simon and now-fiancée Lauren Silverman in a rather compromising position. There was also the issue that Lauren was married to Simon’s good friend, Andrew Silverman. Though the couple got off to a controversial start, Simon has continued his relationship with Lauren and even has a child with her.\n\nJulianna Margulies and Keith Lieberthal\n\nWhen \"The Good Wife\" actress Julianna Marguiles stepped out with now-husband Keith Lieberthal, the paparazzi wondered who the dashing man on her arm was. Though he has movie-star good looks, Keith is actually a lawyer.\n\nJulianna met the lawyer at a dinner party, and the two married in 2007. With a considerable age gap between them and Keith’s appearance, many critics have commented on their relationship. She is quick to tell critics that he is more than just a pretty face saying, “he is unbelievably bright and smart and went to Harvard Law.”\n\nJon Bon Jovi and Dorothea Hurley\n\nYou would think that with so many groupies and video vixens around him, rocker Jon Bon Jovi would be linked to an equally famous woman, but you’d be wrong. It turns out that he only has eyes for his wife of more than 30 years, Dorothea Hurley.\n\nDorothea and Jon met when the two were just teens in New Jersey. Though Jon’s career has taken him far away from the Garden State, the two are inseparable. Safe to say, Dorothea definitely doesn’t “give love a bad name!”\n\nHeidi Montag and Spencer Pratt\n\nLet’s go back to a simpler time — a time full of Juicy Couture velour tracksuits and girls on “The Hills” crying mascara tears over guys wearing trucker hats unironically. In 2006, “Hills” cast member Heidi Montag began dating (villain) Spencer Pratt — incurring the wrath of every television viewer.\n\nBut why did we loathe this couple so much? It seems that Heidi broke the ultimate girl code rule in pursuit of Spencer — she chose him over her BFF Lauren Conrad. After many televised arguments and countless tabloid articles, the early 2000s least-liked couple is still together.\n\nTracy Pollan and Michael J. Fox\n\nTracy Pollan rose to fame primarily because of her portrayal of Ellen Reed in \"Family Ties.\" This talented girl is two inches taller than her (equally talented) husband, actor Michael J. Fox. She met Fox on the set where she played his girlfriend, but at the time, their romance remained strictly on-screen.\n\nIt seems, though, that fate had more in store for the couple. They met again years after the sitcom that shot them both to stardom. Then, the sparks were undeniable. The two-inch height difference melted from their minds as a beautiful relationship began to flourish.\n\nSeth Green and Clare Grant\n\nWhile they may not see eye to eye physically (Seth is 5’4”, and Clare stands at 5’7”), the pair are perfectly on par when it comes to their interests.\n\nThey both love comic books, TV, and something we also adore: fast food. With so many shared loves, the pair didn’t just team up for the Emmy award-winning animated TV show \"Robot Chicken\"; they also teamed up for life. Grant and Green became engaged in 2009 and got married in 2010.\n\nGeorge Takei and Brad Altman\n\nYou might remember George Takei from his role as Sulu in Star Trek, where he moved from one place to another. Brad and George met at a gay club called the Frontrunners. George was awestruck by Brad's running skills and later on, the two worked hard to train together.\n\nThe two make a great team, and George says the secret to their relationship is working together. George works hard at being a writer and actor, while his partner is generally a great manager. The two make for a great pair and have been together for over three decades!\n\nTina Fey and Jeff Richmond\n\nYou can’t always tell the height difference between two people when it’s just a matter of a few inches. Tina Fey is taller than Jeff Richmond by 3 inches, and it has always been an issue. When Fey wears her high-heeled pumps, Richmond looks just how she likes to describe him—travel size.\n\nThey got married in 2001. Ever since they met in 1994, they have also been working together to produce great pieces of cinema and television. They both have breakthroughs in the field of comedy, including The Second City, \"30 Rock\", and \"The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\". They have been together forever.\n\nNicole Kidman and Keith Urban\n\nHere’s one of those couples who show us that love is stronger than anything — Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban. This couple is always so lovey-dovey, even in public. During interviews and on red carpets, they steal the show with how sweet they are.\n\nAfter her divorce from fellow actor Tom Cruise, Kidman gave love another try. And we’re all happy that she did. She has been married to country singer Keith Urban since 2006."
