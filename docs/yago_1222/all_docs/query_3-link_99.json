        "text": "Actress Annette Bening reveals that there is no secret to her long-lasting marriage to actor Warren Beatty.\n\nThe two have been married for 27 years, tying the knot in 1992. They have four children.\n\nBeatty, 82, added that “I don’t think it’s a secret,” adding that it took him “seven or eight seconds” to realize Bening was “the one.”\n\n“I remember losing interest in the garlic chicken I was eating within 20 seconds,” he told People. “And the garlic chicken had been very good.”\n\nWhen the two got married, as People noted, it was a shock to many.\n\nHowever, Beatty didn’t second-guess himself.\n\n“It didn’t really surprise me,” he said, according to the report. “I always felt I wasn’t trying to avoid marriage, I was trying to avoid divorce. I had no doubt when I met Annette that it was time to get married.”\n\nReferring to his four children, Stephen, Benjamin, Isabel, and Ella, he said, “That’s the biggest thing that’s ever happened to me—and their mother. That’s bigger than fame, and it came not a moment too soon,” he continued.\n\n“I became a devoted husband and father 25 years ago, and I have to say they have been the most enthralling years of my life, with our four fantastic kids,” Beatty also said at the time.\n\nBeatty added that he took a hiatus on acting so he could focus on raising their children.\n\n“That is a big price tag and burgeoning newlyweds have an uphill climb in trying to keep wedding costs down. From paying for the venue to the cost of makeup for the bride on her wedding day, the dollars are flying out of family bank accounts before and on the big day,” the report said.\n\nThe most expensive part of the wedding is the venue, costing about $16,000 on average. And there is the photographer at $2,783, and reception music averages about $4,156 for weddings.\n\n“Couples, on average, spend between $19,323 and $32,205 but, 50 percent of couples spend less than $15,000. This does not include the cost of a honeymoon. Understanding wedding cost now can help you with your wedding budget later,” adds CostofWedding.com.\n\nMeanwhile, the bride’s family pays, according to a study.\n\nComing in at No. 2 was New Jersey at $38,049 while Connecticut was third with an average cost of $36,971. Massachusetts was fourth at $36,709, and New York was fifth, according to the report."
