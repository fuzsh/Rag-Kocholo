        "text": "Sarah Paulson and Holland Taylor – Together Since 2015\n\nActresses Sarah Paulson and Holland Taylor first met all the way back in 2005 at a party; however, it seems that sparks didn't fly there right away. In fact, it took another ten years before the two started their romance.\n\nThe two reconnected on Twitter, of all places! Holland has said about their love, \"It's the most wonderful, extraordinary thing that could have ever possibly happened in my life.\" While they have both had relationships before, this is their longest, most stable one. Despite public scrutiny of their 34-year age gap, the two seem to be happier and more in love than ever!\n\nSnoop Dogg and Shante Taylor – Together Since 1995\n\nShante Taylor and Cordozar Calvin Broadus Jr. were teenagers when they met. They became boyfriend-girlfriend and went to prom together long before Snoop Dogg rapped himself a hip-hop fortune. They married in 1997 and are still very much in love. Their first son arrived in 1994, and they now share three children.\n\nThe couple has had some ups and downs, including the personal tragedy of losing an infant grandson. They also faced divorce in 2004 but ended up renewing their vows in 2008. When MTV asked Snoop about it he simply said he fell back in love with his wife and kids after realizing the industry was blurring his vision.\n\nKevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick – Together Since 1988\n\nThe actors have been married since 1988 and have two children together. When Kyra Sedgwick appeared on \"Who Do You Think You Are?\", she found out a freaky fact about herself and her husband. “I just found out so many things I didn’t know,” she said on the Late Show with David Letterman.\n\nShe found out that she and her husband are “tenth cousins once removed.” She continued by saying, “It was a little upsetting, I’m not going to lie.” Don't worry, though — that degree of family connection does not pose any threat to their relationship or their offspring.\n\nPaul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly – Together since 2001\n\nYounger audiences may only be familiar with Paul Bettany's later projects as Vision in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Connelly from playing Melanie in the TV show 'Snowpircer'. They have met at a much earlier stage of their careers, though.\n\nPaul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly first met when they starred in \"A Beautiful Mind.\" However, it seems it just wasn’t the right time back then. They were both in other relationships while they were filming. Months later, Paul realized his love for Connelly and proposed to her BEFORE they had even officially started dating. In 2003, they got married in Scotland and are now happy with their children, Stellan and Agnes.\n\nTom Ford and Richard Buckley – Together Since 1986\n\nAccording to fashion designer Tom Ford, it was love at first sight when he met fashion journalist Richard Buckley. The two met by sharing an elevator ride for ten floors. By the last floor, Ford felt Buckley was the one. Sounds like something out of a movie! That was 1986; fast forward to today, and the two are still together, happily ever after.\n\nThe couple got married this 2014. The two have a child together named Alexander John Buckley Ford. According to Ford, the secret to their relationship is mutual respect. Plus, having a mutually good heart and soul helps a lot.\n\nRachel Zoe and Rodger Berman – Together Since 1998\n\nCelebrity fashion stylist Rachel Zoe and businessman Rodger Bermant first met while busting tables at the same restaurant and got married seven years later. Coming from humble beginnings that were not nearly as glamorous as their current careers, this is a success story no matter how you look at it.\n\nNow they run a fashion and styling empire together. How romantic! The couple starred in the reality show \"The Rachel Zoe Project\" together. Their marriage was as much of a focus on the show as was their business. Seems to have worked in their favor, as tye are still together!\n\nMax Handelman and Elizabeth Banks – Together Since 1992\n\nAccording to the couple, they fell in love with each other on the FIRST DAY of college in 1992. After dating for ten whole years, they finally tied the knot. Max Handelman caught Elizabeth Banks completely off guard with a surprise proposal. On July 5, 2003, they were wed at the beautiful Graystone Mansion in Beverly Hills. They have two sons.\n\nWhen they met at the University of Pennsylvania in 1993, they were both attending a frat party. Things were wrapping up. “The house had run out of beer, so the party was pretty much over,” Handelman said in 2010. The lights came on, and the fraternity brothers were kicking people out. And that’s when he first caught a glimpse of Elizabeth Banks. He walked over with a buddy and started a conversation.\n\nAmy Adams and Darren Le Gallo – Together Since 2001\n\nFrom her breakthrough role in \"Enchanted\" to her fantastic portrayal of the new Lois Lane in the latest installment of the Superman franchise and many other successes, Amy Adams and her flaming red hair are super famous in Hollywood.\n\nIn classic LA fashion, Amy Adams met her future hubby, Darren Le Gallo, during their acting classes back in 2001. It seems more than just fake love was in the air because the two got together in real life! After six years of dating, Dareen finally popped the question, and it took them SEVEN more years to make things official! The pair tied the knot in 2015 and have been together ever since.\n\nGal Gadot and Yaron Varsano – Together Since 2006\n\nIsrael’s homegrown model and superstar Gal Gadot is a wonder woman to her husband, property developer Yaron Varsano. The pair have been together for a number of years, well before she scored the role of Wonder Woman. The pair met on a soul-searching adventure in the desert - which involved yoga, chakras, and healthy eating in the Israeli dunes.\n\nGal was only 21 at the time, whereas Yaron was 31 and knew she was “the one.” The pair say they work well together, and their mutual understanding made their match a great one! All those years later, the two (and their three kids) are still going strong.\n\nWolf Blitzer and Lynn Greenfield – Together Since 1973\n\nGerman journalist Wolf Blitzer won the lottery when he met his partner at such a young age. While he works as a reporter and anchor for CNN, she is a personal shopper who works at Saks Fifth Avenue store in Chevy Chase.\n\nWhen Blitzer has to travel for work, she enjoys joining him. The two got married way back when in the year of 1973. They had one daughter together, named Ilana Blitzer Gendelman. Forging a path of her own, the Blitzer offspring is not pursuing a profession similar to that of one of her parents. Instead, she is a beauty director in Health Magazine and All You Magazine.\n\nSanjay Gupta and Rebecca Olson – Together Since 2004\n\nWe don't know a lot of famous neurosurgeons, but Gupta is one. He is also a writer and a medical reporter. What a Renaissance man! Like many others on this list, he was fortunate enough to meet his wife when the two were incredibly young.\n\nThey both grew up in Michigan and went to the same high school and the same University. Rebbeca is a self-employed lawyer. The two lovebirds tied the knot in 2004 in a Hindu wedding which must have been a beautiful sight to see. They have three daughters together, named Sage Ayla, Soleil Asha, and Sky Anjali.\n\nTucker Carlson and Susan Andrews – Together Since 1985\n\nThe host of 'Tucker Carlson Tonight' has been with his now wife since the two were just teenagers. They started dating when they were 15, and Carlson has been quoted saying that when he first met Susan, he thought she was the cutest 10th grader to have ever existed. Aw, now isn't that just the most adorable thing you have ever heard?\n\nThe two got married in 1991, and Tucker shared that he even asked her dad's permission before he married her. How romantic! While he's in the spotlight, Susan enjoys living a simple life, working at St. Georges School, which her father owns.\n\nKat Timpf and Cameron Friscia – Together Since 2016\n\nFox news reporter, Kat Timpf, has met the love of her life. For those of you who don't know, Raya is a dating app that only lets famous people use it. The two have been rumored to date for more than four years before they decided to get engaged in 2020. But who is Friscia, exactly?\n\nWell, he served in the U.S. Military as an Assistant Operation Officer. He later on became a broker, at which point he met Kat. She confessed we weren't 100% sure about him when she first saw him, as she felt he seemed too \"clean-cut\" for her. The two celebrated their wedding ceremony in 2021 and are still going strong.\n\nAshton Kutcher and Mila Kunis – Together Since 2012\n\nAshton Kutcher and Mila Kunis first met when they starred on the hit show That ’70s Show, which ran from 1998 to 2006. After the show, they went with their separate lives: they both dated, married, and (eventually) divorced other people. One day, the two ran into each other by chance at an awards show. And although they did keep in touch the entire time after That ’70s Show, it wasn’t until they saw each other again, years later, face to face, that they saw each other in a different light.\n\nAfter the evening they reunited, they became \"friends with benefits\" for a while but soon realized that they had a good thing going and officially became an item in 2012. In October 2014, Kunis gave birth to their daughter Wyatt Isabelle Kutcher, and the two tied the knot in July 2015. A year later, in 2016, she gave birth to their son, Dimitri Portwood Kutcher. Could this love story be remade into a Rom-Com already?\n\nBlake Lively and Ryan Reynolds – Together Since 2012\n\nRyan Reynolds and Blake Lively first met when they played love interests in 2011’s Green Lantern and ended up becoming lovers in real life! Initially, the two just became close friends during and after the film year, but gradually developed feelings for each other.\n\nReynolds once admitted in an interview that it was kind of “weird” transitioning from friends to something more; we’re sure glad that they finally made that leap. They married in 2012 and today share four children, who have probably won some serious genetic lottery. Not only are their parents insanely attractive, but they are also hysterically funny..\n\nChrissy Teigen and John Legend – Together Since 2013\n\nThis is probably the most followed couple on our list. Teigen and Legend are Instagram’s ultimate power couple. Not only do we adore the gorgeous pictures uploaded, but also the hilarious trolling they do to each other. They met one day on the set of a video shoot for Legend's song Stereo.\n\nThey ended up hooking up that day, but John continued on a tour. After months of FaceTiming, while Legend was away, the couple finally started dating. Officially, and the rest is history. This lovely couple shares three drop-dead gorgeous children. Their family is even bigger if you count all the pets: several dogs, a hamster, a lizard, and two birds!\n\nSerena Williams and Alexis Ohanian – Together Since 2017\n\nWhen this couple first went \"public,\" it had people scratching their heads. How did a beautiful pro-athlete and a cute geek, who also happens to be the co-founder of Reddit, become an item? The story of how they first met is super cute. The two happened to be having breakfast one morning at the same hotel.\n\nAlexis took a seat near Serena, who was sitting with some friends. In an effort to scare him away, she and her friends claimed they saw a rat near him. But his response was epic, \"I'm from Brooklyn. I see rats all the time,\" and left Serena intrigued to the point where she invited him to her table. Today, they're married and have a daughter, Alexis, and couldn't be happier.\n\nMatt and Luciana Damon – Together Since 2005\n\nMatt Damon met his wife in 2003 while shooting a film in Miami. A couple of years later, the man popped the question and the couple made things official just a few months after. Despite being married since 2005, Damon still doesn’t feel qualified to give relationship advice.\n\nHe once said, “I think marriage is insane... It’s a crazy idea, but I love being married to my wife. So I wouldn’t tell anybody else anything about their relationship.” Mr. Damon's wife is a \"civilian,\" as he once jokingly referred to her, meaning that she's not from the entertainment industry. Perhaps that's the secret to his relationship's longevity.\n\nMeryl Streep and Don Gummer – Together Since 1978\n\nWith a career as illustrious as hers, Maryl Streep needs no introduction. With two Academy Awards and more Oscar nominations than we can count (not to mention the Emmys and Folden Globes), we are sure you know who we are talking about. After her partner John Cazale died in 1978, Streep met artist Gummer and went on to marry him later that year.\n\nThe couple has four successful children, all involved in the Entertainment industry in one way or another. Their son Henry is a musician, two of their daughters — Mamie and Grace — are actresses, and their third daughter is both an actress and a model.\n\nSeth Rogen and Lauren Miller – Together Since 2004\n\nSeth Rogan and Lauen Miller started dating in 2004, got engaged in 2011, and married a year later in 2012. Took them long enough! Rogan is a comedian and filmmaker mostly famously known for his 2007 film 'Superbad', which also starred Miller. Miller is also an actress in her own right.\n\nThey’ve been through a lot together, including Lauren’s mother suffering from Alzheimer's disease, but they go hard and decided to start a charity to help support the cause. When they aren't acting, writing, or bringing awareness for diseases, they like spending quality time with each other; we're sure they're mostly laughing.\n\nJessica Alba and Cash Warren – Together Since 2008\n\nThese love birds met on the set of 'The Fantastic Four' movie and have been inseparable ever since. While the movie is not very well-remembered by diehard fans of the original comic books, we are sure Alba doesn't regret it one bit. When they celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary, fans adored their gushy posts to each other.\n\nThey still seem to be just as in love as they were when they got married. In 2017 they hit yet another milestone: the birth of their third child, their son, Hayes. Now their two little girls have a brother to bring and lil' yang into the mix.\n\nAngela Bassett and Courtney B. Vance – Together Since 1997\n\nHollywood veteran actress Angela Basset and her husband Courtney B. Vance first met in 1980 but only maintained a platonic relationship, that is, until around 1997, when they became \"friends with benefits,\" more so Courtney's if you ask us, she is freaking gorgeous!\n\nVance is quite religious and has said that the Lord and his wife (Bassett) is the most important thing on this earth to him. (Does that make Bassett a goddess?) He also said that the decisions in their marriage are clearer because of their relationship with God. Obviously, their spirituality is a big factor underlying their love for each other.\n\nSteve and Nancy Carell – Together Since 1995\n\nThe hilarious pair met when Nancy attended one of Steve’s improv classes in Chicago. She never thought she would go to a class and end up finding a husband. Steve actually thought that Nancy wasn't interested in him; he said, “I thought she hated me because she was very quiet around me... and I later found out that she was just as nervous as I was and trying to act cool.\"\n\nCupid worked its magic, and Steve took Nancy's hand in marriage in 1995. They have appeared on-screen together in a number of projects, most notably on \"The Daily Show.\" The couple has a son and a daughter.\n\nJoel McHale and Sarah Williams – Together Since 1996\n\n“You have to choose your spouse every day,” actor Joel McHale once said about his marriage to the lovely Sara Williams. They've been married since 1996. The star of \"Community\" and \"The Soup\" believes that being happily married is a choice and that if you tell yourself that your spouse is the person that you love and want to be with consciously, every day, then it becomes subconscious.\n\nThat is a surprisingly candid statement for a guy known more for his comedic exploits than his romance or drama acumen. We guess Sarah brings out a softer side of the guy!\n\nOzzy and Sharon Osbourne – Together Sinc 1982\n\nSharon Osbourne was just 18 years old when she met the Black Sabbath band member Ozzy Osbourne. Little did they both know, she would eventually replace her dad as his manager. The two married in 1982, and needless to say, have been through it all... for better and for worse, in illness and in health.\n\nBetween his substance abuse and her battles with colon cancer and a double mastectomy. The world has watched them during break-ups and then get back together a few times, in fact. But we all love how they seem to be in love even after all of these years.\n\nIman and David Bowie – Together Since 1992\n\nSupermodel Iman and rock star David Bowie were people's favorite couple to look at. They always looked so fashionable and svelt together. They dated for three years before they finally made it official. They had one daughter together, in addition to a son and a daughter from previous marriages.\n\nAfter the death of the rock legend Iman said in an interview that although it’s been three years since her deceased husband's passing, she still mourns and says she will never remarry. She is thankful for the 24 happy years they shared together, and now, she wears a gold pendant with his name on it to keep him with her always and tries her best to keep busy.\n\nLisa Kudrow and Michael Stern – Together Since 1995\n\nWhen Lisa Kudrow met the French advertising executive Michel Stern, the two hit it off quite instantly. Even so, they took things slow and dated for six years until they finally got married in 1995. This means that Stern has known Kudrow before her \"Friends\" breakthrough and subsequent fame and all through the craze around the show.\n\nStern and Phoebe (sorry we had to) have been now for more than 20 years, making them one of the longest Hollywood marriages. They have a son, Julian, who they welcomed into the world in 1998. When he was growing up, Julian was often brought to the set of \"Friends\" alongside his mother. How sweet!\n\nJerry and Jessica Seinfeld – Together Since 1999\n\nJerry and Jessica fell in love back in their bagels and lox days; they're much more health-conscious now. Although Jessica is still famous for her Long Island Chicken Parmesan (which she prepared on their first date). While this is Jerry's first marriage (though he's had his fair share of serious relationships in the past), this is Jessica's second, having divorced her first husband in order to start seeing Jerry.\n\nThe couple has been married for nearly 20 years now. They have three children — two sons and a daughter. Jerry still refers to her as his 'best friend.' And that, my dears, is the secret to relationship longevity, actually liking your significant other.\n\nTina Turner and Erwin Bach – Together Since 1986\n\nWhat’s love got to do, got to do with it? Well, a lot if you ask us. Tina Turner had been through a patchy and abusive relationship with her previous husband, Ike Turner. She had pretty much given up on love. That was until she met the German gentleman Erwin Bach. In 1986, he was sent by her European record label to greet Turner at the airport. Bach being over sixteen years her junior, Tina didn't really take his courtship seriously.\n\nLater that year, she was convinced, and they had become inseparable until her last days. Although Bach proposed to her a few times before, they only made it official in the summer of 2013, after a 27-year romantic relationship!\n\nRande Gerber and Cindy Crawford – Together Since 1998\n\nThis supermodel couple Cindy Crawford and Rande Gerber tied the knot in 1998 and have been going strong for over 20 years now. This is Gerber's first marriage and Crawford's second, after being married to actor Richard Gere for for years.\n\nToday, Gerber is a successful restaurant and bar entrepreneur, and Crawford is a busy mom of two — Presley and Kaia— but still makes appearances on magazine covers. Not surprisingly, their kids have already had a few modeling gigs as well, most famously with Kaia looking like a carbon copy of her mother and getting to walk runways and star in campaigns like no one's business.\n\nTina Fey and Jeff Richmond – Together Since 2001\n\nJeff Richmond, a composer on the hit show '30 Rock', and comedian Tina Fey met at Chicago’s Second City and instantly hit it off. After dating for seven years, they finally tied the knot in a Greek Orthodox ceremony in 2001.\n\nBesides making people laugh and creating the mother of all early 2000s cult classics — 'Mean Girls', Tina has also moved behind the scenes as a writer and director for other successful movies and shows. Her hubby is always working alongside her, serving as a composer or the soundtrack consultant as he did for '30 Rock' and 'The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.'\n\nGoldie Hawn and Kurt Russell – Together Since 1983\n\nSpotted just the other day holidaying in the Greek islands, these two screen veterans are still together after more than 35 years. You might remember the hilarious rom-com 'Overboard', which saw a snobbish Hamptons-loving socialite suffer from amnesia before being tricked into thinking she was married to the single father of three, played by Kurt Russell.\n\nBy that time, the pair had been dating for five years, deciding in 1982 that they would never marry and just raise their blended family as “committed partners.” And they’ve been committed partners ever since. Goldie Hawn once told the media that the secret to their partnership was the fact that they’d never walked down the aisle.\n\nMark Wahlberg and Rhea Durham – Together Since 2009\n\nFrom a young, fresh-faced teen who was a star in 'New Kids on the Block,' fast forward and Mark Wahlberg is not only a mega-famous movie star and gym junkie, but he’s also famous for passing the 10-year milestone with his wife, Rhea Durham. The couple dated for seven years, during which they had 3 kids, and then went on to get married and have another child.\n\nThe secret to happiness? Well, a romantic holiday in Italy doesn’t hurt! But in all seriousness, it seems that a lot of love, patience, and communication has gone into making this relationship work. Four kids and a number of Hollywood blockbusters later, the pair are going strong.\n\nNeil Patrick Harris and David Burtka – Together Since 2004\n\nNeil Patrick Harris has to be one of our favorite comedy actors, rising to fame on 'How I Met Your Mother'. Actor, comedian, writer, producer, magician, and singer Neil Patrick Harris is one very talented individual. You’d think with all those talents and skills, it would be difficult to find someone truly worthy, but it seems that he met his match with David Burtka.\n\nThe pair were together since 2004 and tied the knot in 2014 when gay marriage was legalized. The pair have two children together, conceived through a surrogate mother - Harper Grace and Gideon Scott. Those are two very lucky kiddies, especially with that trust fund!\n\nMaggie Gyllenhaal and Peter Sarsgaard – Together Since 2006\n\nThe older sister of Jake Gyllenhaal, Maggie Gyllenhaal, is just as esteemed when it comes to Hollywood. The female star of Nolan’s 'The Dark Knight,' Gyllenhaal, has a unique acting charm about her. Tying the knot with fellow actor Peter Sarsgaard a decade ago, the two actually met through her brother Jake! Dating for a few years before Peter plucked up the courage to pop the question, the pair wed in 2006.\n\nThe couple has two children together, aged 13 and 7. It seems that for this pair of actors, patience and a lot of love have gone into making it work. It seems that honesty and communication are the keys to staying far away from the marriage counseling office.\n\nMegyn Kelly and Douglas Brunt – Together Since 2008\n\nWe all know and love Megyn Kelly. She's been a consistent part of our lives from 2004 to 2017 when she hosted Fox News. But this political commentator isn't just about achieving career goals -- she has had a long steady relationship with her husband, Douglas Brunt, since the late oughts.\n\nMegyn was briefly married to an anesthesiologist named Daniel Kendall. Their 2001-2006 marriage was short-lived, but they still gave it a good try. Today Kelly couldn't be happier with Brunt. The two have three beautiful children, making their family a party of five. Doug used to be the CEO of a cybersecurity firm, but in recent years he decided to pursue his real passion - being a writer. We definitely root for these two!\n\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus and Brad Hall – Together Since 1987\n\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus is one of our favorite female characters of all time. Despite the on-again-off-again romance of her character, Elaine, with Jerry in 'Seinfeld', things were very different in real life! She met her future husband, Brad Hall in the early 80s when the pair were both attending Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.\n\nIn 1987, the pair made it official and have remained married, even adding two sons to the mix. One happy family enjoying their hilarious mom’s $200 million fortune! Not to mention their dad’s own fortune – you might recognize him from SNL as a 'Weekend Update' news anchor.\n\nDenzel and Pauletta Washington – Together Since 1983\n\nWe’re pretty sure En Vogue’s hit “Whatta Man” was inspired by Denzel Washington. Churning out successful films like butter, Denzel Washington is just incredibly charismatic. Over the years, he’s amassed a fortune of over $220 million, which he shares with his wife, Pauletta Washington.\n\nWith one of the most enduring marriages in Hollywood, married for 36 years, Denzel credits his wife as being the reason their marriage “works.” The pair met on the set of the TV movie 'Wilma,' and Denzel was smitten. But did you know that Pauletta turned down Denzel not once but twice? The third time’s a charm, right? Thirty-six years later, we’re sure Denzel’s glad he persisted!\n\nCatherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas – Together Since 2000\n\nThe stunning Catherine Zeta-Jones shocked the world when she and Michael Douglas announced their engagement. The Welsh beauty has taken the leading lady role in many films, from 'Entrapment' to 'The Mask of Zorro'. And Michael Douglas, well, his reputation precedes him – we really don’t have to list his slew of films!\n\nProminent in Hollywood, the pair have grown from strength to strength and stuck by one another. Despite signing a prenup before saying “I do,” it’s highly unlikely that the pair will need to call in the lawyers, a la 'Intolerable Cruelty'! Almost twenty years later, the pair have two kids together and have earned a lavish lifestyle. Cheers to that!\n\nLisa Rinna and Harry Hamlin – Together Since 1997\n\nIn March 2019, Lisa and Harry Hamlin reached the milestone of having been married for 22 years. Rinna, who had a career in television, was, of course, a mainstay on the show 'Melrose Place', before transitioning years later into reality TV, such as in 'Harry Loves Lisa', 'Celebrity Apprentice', and perhaps her most recent famous role on 'The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills'.\n\nAs for Hamlin, who is an actor himself, also on TV, he’s had quite a successful career as well! The pair married in 1997 and have since had two daughters. In this case, it seems that opposites are attracted, but it’s been successful!\n\nAnna Kournikova and Enrique Iglesias – Together Since 2001\n\nWe're sure Enrique has serenaded his partner of more than 20 years, Anna Kournikova, many, many times! The couple started dating after meeting in 2001 on the set of his “Escape” video clip. At 21, Kournikova gave up the Wimbledon pursuit and decided to follow her heart instead.\n\nOver the years, the couple has graced red carpets and been on everyone’s favorite couple list. Fast forward, and Enrique and Anna have a gorgeous set of twins (a boy and a girl) together, who seem to love their football as much as their dad. They welcomed a third child, daughter Mary, in 2020.\n\nSarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick – Together Since 1992\n\n'Sex and the City' meets 'Ferris Bueller,' this Tinseltown couple has been together through it all. The fashionista from Hollywood, Sarah Jessica Parker, found her man in Matthew Broderick, and they’ve lasted for just over two decades. The pair first locked eyes on one another when they were introduced by Sarah’s brother.\n\nIt seems that while they keep their personal life under wraps, Sarah Jessica did provide some insight as to her true feelings: \"Call me crazy, but I love him. We're very devoted to our family and our lives. I love our life. I love that he's the father of my children, and it's because of him that there's this whole other world that I love.”\n\nDavid Beckham and Victoria Beckham – Together Since 1999\n\nThe international football superstar and popstar-turned luxe fashion designer have been married for more than 20 years! Incredibly, David recalls seeing the Spice Girls perform on TV and thinking he wants to marry someone just like that. Talk about manifestation!\n\nWith four beautiful kids together, what we love about the Beckhams is that they’re so close-knit. While their kids are growing and showing their talents already, that doesn’t mean mom and dad are showing any signs of slowing down. Have you seen how incredible this pair looks together when they’re out just for dinner? We wish them all the best and are hoping to see them spend many more years together.\n\nJohn Travolta and Kelly Preston – Together Since 1991\n\nHitting our screens with some knee-dropping, toe-tapping, and electric dance moves, the star of 'Saturday Night Fever' is a Hollywood heavyweight, and the love of his life is just as grand. But back to their love story — John Travolta came across Kelly Preston on the set of 'The Experts' in 1989.\n\nThe pair married two years later, and stayed together for a little under thirty years, separating in 2020 under the saddest circumstances when Preston passed away at the age of 57. The couple has brought three kids into this world. Their daughter, Ella Bleu, is making her first steps in the entertainment industry.\n\nMelissa Gilbert and Timothy Busfield – Together Since 2013\n\nNow this one is just shy of reaching a decade, but hey, it seems that anything longer than a year is a record in Hollywood. Melissa Gilbert, of 'The Little House On Prairie,' has been married to actor and director Timothy Busfield for roughly six years. Previously, Melissa’s marriage didn’t quite work out, divorcing twice. But luckily for Melissa, it seems that she may have found the one in Timothy Busfield.\n\nThe couple, despite their relatively short marriage thus far, has big plans for the future, with a goal to start their own theatre company. It seems that maybe this joint venture could help them come closer together rather than push them apart. We wish them all the best!\n\nJamie Lee Curtis and Christopher Guest – Together Since 1984\n\nThe stunning Jamie Lee Curtis and her beau Christopher Guest have been married for over thirty years. We love how they “met,” too: Curtis, in fact, spotted Christopher Guest on the cover of a magazine one day. From that one picture, she proclaimed that this man would be her future husband. And it actually happened!\n\nIs it fate? Is it witchcraft? A little bit of both. After a friend told her he was signed with her agency, she left him a message through his agent but he never returned the call. And then she ran into him at a restaurant. Between seeing that magazine picture to the actual wedding there were only five months! The pair have adopted two daughters together. And did you know that Christopher Guest has the title of Baron? Pretty cool!\n\nAdam Sandler and Jackie Sandler – Together Since 2003\n\nHollywood funnyman Adam Sandler is pretty much a comedic genius when it comes to the genre. Anyone who disagrees, well, they clearly haven’t seen 'Happy Gilmore.' The king of late 90s comedy films, Sandler kept himself busy (and still is keeping busy). You’d think with a hectic schedule that, your love life would take a bit of a hit, but not the case for Sandler.\n\nHe makes sure to set aside time for his family, which we think is extremely important. Devoted to his two daughters and wife of 20 years, Jackie, Sandler is quite the family man. We’re sure that the checks he brings into the family also help with keeping that marriage strong.\n\nBarbra Streisand and James Brolin – Together Since 1998\n\nThe musical legend Barbra Streisand has a starred career that is just as stunning as her voice. It seems that as well as having a stellar career, she’s enjoyed a wonderful married life with her partner James Brolin. Both were previously married before they met, but following separations, the pair were single when they met at a party. They quickly realized they had something special, and one date turned into more dates, and finally, marriage.\n\nThey kept it under wraps of course, and only close friends knew they’d wed. What we love most about this couple is that in 21 years of marriage, they’ve both ensured not to take one another for granted.\n\nPierce Brosnan and Keely Shaye Smith – Together Since 2001\n\n007 himself, Pierce Brosnan, was, in fact, contrary to his leading part, quite the committed man. Despite his signature role’s philandering, Brosnan has been with his lovely lady, Keely Shaye Smith, for just over 18 years. One of the most popular James Bond actors, Brosnan was marked by tragedy before moving forward with his wife Keely Shaye.\n\nHis first wife passed tragically, leaving him quite devastated. Sometime later, he met journalist Keely Shaye, the second woman to walk down the aisle to him. Almost two decades later, the pair welcomed two sons into the world, who are now walking the catwalks of the world!\n\nDustin and Lisa Hoffman – Together Since 1980\n\nNow, this is a marriage to celebrate - Dustin and Lisa Hoffman have been married for nearly forty years! Dustin Hoffman, who’s now 80, has proved with his marriage to Lisa that true love never dies. The Hoffmans married in 1980, and Lisa, in fact, came out and said jokingly, “I say in Hollywood it is like dog years, so you have to multiply that by seven.”\n\nShe also went on to say that marriage is no walk in the park: “We work hard at it. I knew I was going to end up with Dusty and that my life would be traveling around with him.” You have to love that commitment to your partner! Did you know the pair were friends for years before they started dating? So that’s pretty much a lifetime together.\n\nTom Hanks and Rita Wilson – Together Since 1988 years\n\nThe Hollywood icon Tom Hanks is known for securing his own piece of Greece and holidaying there as frequently as possible (and who wouldn’t?). The Oscar winner needs no introduction, nor do we need to detail his filmography – besides, we’re here for love anyway!\n\nHis wife Rita came across his path in 1988, on the set of 'Volunteers'. With her Greek background, she is the one who introduced Hanks to the place and culture and he was happy to soak it all up. Since then, the pair haven’t left each other's sides. And hey, if it’s on a remote Greek island, that’s even more reason to stick together.\n\nViola Davis and Julius Tennon – Together Since 2003 Years\n\nThe magnetic and charming Viola Davis is a leading lady who’s not to be trifled with, that’s for sure! (Se even has the EGOT to prove it.) But despite her strong, usually fierce character portrayals, she’s got her lover man behind the scenes.\n\nMarried to Julius Tennon, the pair tied the knot in 2003 and have enjoyed married life ever since, even adopting a little girl together. Amazingly, Davis says that Tennon walked into her life a couple of weeks after she prayed for a partner just like him! Now, if that's not meant to be then we don't know what is.\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. – Together Since 2002\n\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer meets Fred Jones, and apparently, they liked the look of each other enough to get married. Anyway, characters aside, the pair has remained married for more than twenty years. The secret? “We were just friends. That’s one of the reasons I think our relationship has always been so good,” Freddie said.\n\nThe pair met on the set of 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' and started their friendship there. Apparently, it took them about three years to realize their interest in each other was not only friendly but also romantic. So hey, friends first, lovers later! They now have two children together\n\nFelicity Huffman and William H. Macy – Together Since 1997\n\nAnother couple coming across each other in the early 80s, next up are Felicity Huffman and William H. Macy. For 'Shameless' star Macy, this is the second marriage after his first only lasted five years. For 'Desperate Housewives' star Huffman, this is the first and only.\n\nThe pair have been together for more than two decades, and we know that this couple values family. They have two daughters together, both of which share a middle name — Grace. It seems that the couple has found the secret to keeping things interesting and growing a committed, long-lasting relationship despite their hectic acting careers and the media.\n\nOlivia Newton-John and John Easterling – Together Since 2008\n\nSuperstar singer and actress Olivia Newton-John has fought cancer more than once, but the gorgeous smiling Aussie was certainly not alone in that brave fight! Her battle is made just that tiny bit easier by having a partner like John Easterling by her side.\n\nHer partner Easterling is an American businessman and environmentalist who’s the chairman of Amazon Herb Company. While the pair have no natural children together, Easterling plays dad to Olivia’s daughter, Chloe Rose. Did you know this wonderful couple renewed their vows in Peru? It's so romantic we could cry. Sadly, in 2022 Olivia passed away, leaving John brokenhearted.\n\nJennifer Grey and Clark Gregg – Together Since 2001\n\nWhether you remember her as the furious older sister in 'Ferris Bueller’s Day Off', or in the iconic 'Dirty Dancing' as ‘Baby’, she’s certainly a memorable face from the 1980s. It seems that she was born with a natural charm and gift – and her beauty really hasn’t faded after all these years.\n\nAnd it may surprise you to know that she’s married to Clark Gregg, who you would’ve seen more recently in Marvel’s 'Avengers franchise as Agent Phil Coulson. The pair were married for 18 years, tying the knot in 2001 and going their separate ways in August 2020. They remain good friends.\n\nHarrison Ford and Calista Flockhart – Together Since 2010\n\nWith his debonair charm and signature smirk, it’s no wonder Harrison Ford wooed the likes of Calista Flockhart. After being married twice, the 'Indiana Jones' star met the 'Ally McBeal' star and sparks flew all around. The pair have been married for more than 10 years and really seem to be enjoying married life together.\n\nFord, who’s now a proud octogenarian, married Flockhart, who is a full 22 years younger than him, in 2010. The pair have been together ever since and support each other through everything – for Harrison Ford, it’s aviation! Couples that support one another stay together.\n\nMark Consuelos and Kelly Ripa – Together Since 1996\n\nThese very attractive individuals made everyone a little jealous when they tied the knot, but despite their picture-perfect marriage, things aren’t always what they seem. In 23 years of marriage, the pair have had their fair share of trials and tribulations, but it seems that they have no regrets.\n\nTheir fated meeting on 'All My Children' saw Ripa opposite Consuelos as his love interest. Funny how fiction can mirror reality sometimes. The pair eloped to Las Vegas and tied the knot, but not before they broke up briefly first. Nowadays, that’s in the past and they seem to be very happy together.\n\nBryan Cranston and Robin Dearden – Together Since 1989\n\nYou might recognize him from his role opposite Frankie Muniz, but boy, what a performance Cranston gave in the hit series 'Breaking Bad'! However, it was on the set of 'Airwolf,' back in 1986, when Cranston and Dearden first laid eyes on each other. Bryan was the bad guy and Dearden, the victim, and from there, the pair married. Thirty-one years later, we’d say that that was one hostage situation that came out with a happy ending!\n\nAfter all those years, we’d like to get the secret to keeping a marriage together and to strengthening it with all the challenges married couples face. Pretty incredible, but we suppose the fact the pair have lots of royalties coming in doesn’t hurt at all.\n\nWarren Beatty and Annette Bening – Together Since 1992\n\nWith a 21-year age gap, we’re once again shown that age is just a number. Especially when that gap hasn’t stopped Annette Bening and Warren Beatty for more than 30 years. The pair married in 1992, just a year after she split from her former husband Steven White.\n\nBeatty, on the other hand, is a bit of a legend, and he’s been acting for 5 decades. His creative talents as a filmmaker and actor wowed many women in the past, and we’re sure Bening was no exception! The pair have raised four kids together and are looking toward a bright future together.\n\nSir Patrick Stewart and Sunny Ozell – Together Since 2013\n\nSir Patrick Stewart is a bit of an icon when it comes to 'Star Trek' and 'X-Men.' The esteemed actor got his start in theatre and perfected his craft before responding to the call of Hollywood. Stewart, who has married twice before, has apparently found love and a companion in Sunny Ozell, a Brooklyn-based jazz singer.\n\nDid we mention the fact that she was 39 years his junior? Anyway, The pair have been married for years now and look to be going for quite a few more! Oh, and we nearly forgot the best part — the person to perform their wedding ceremony was none other than Stewart's longtime friend, Sir Ian McKellen!\n\nGisele Bündchen and Tom Brady – Together Since 2009\n\nIf there’s one couple that always glitters on the red carpet, it’s certainly the Brady couple. Brazilian supermodel Gisele and her New England Patriots quarterback husband, Tom Brady, are incredible together. It just took a meeting to really seal the deal. In 2006, the pair met at a mutual friend’s house, and since then, they've been joined at the hip.\n\nSuper aligned with their beliefs and lifestyle, this couple was made for each other. We’re sure when Brady was a teen; he wouldn’t have dreamed of marrying a stunning Brazilian woman – but hey, life! The pair tied the knot in 2009 and haven’t looked back, welcoming a boy and a girl into their lives. Update!!! as of October 2022, the couple has divorced and is no longer together. They're so beautiful that we didn't want to remove them from the list.\n\nSteven Spielberg and Kate Capshaw – Together Since 1991\n\nFew names command the quiet of the room like Steven Spielberg. His body of work speaks for itself but what do you know of his love life? The prolific director and magic-maker, as we like to refer to him, has been married for almost three decades to actress Kate Capshaw.\n\nSpielberg took a risk by taking on the lesser-known actress to star in the now-iconic 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,' ignoring leading ladies like Sharon Stone. People questioned, but hey, this is Spielberg we’re talking about. Spielberg hasn’t looked back, almost thirty years later. When love calls, you better listen!\n\nSting and Trudie Styler – Together Since 1982\n\nFrom The Police to his solo act, Sting has an instantly recognizable voice that puts him down in history as one of the greats. What’s more, is his personal life: he and his wife, Trudie Styler, have been together for more than a quarter of a century! Meeting in 1982, the pair dated for ten years before finally tying the knot in 1992.\n\nIt seems that to spend 35 years with someone must mean they’re doing something right - close friends say that the couple's love is almost teenage-like, in the sense that they’re just so into each other. And Sting himself backs this up, revealing that Trudie remains the light in his life (as well as their four kids together).\n\nHugh Jackman and Deborra-Lee Furness – Together Since 1996\n\nWe absolutely adore this next couple who’ve managed to stand the test of time. Our favorite man from down under, Hugh Jackman, is one incredibly talented individual. And right beside him, his wife Deborra-Lee Furness, a woman to whom his love is seemingly never-ending. He’s always gushing about his lady love, and frankly, we are a little jealous!\n\nThe pair tied the knot in 1996 and have since adopted two children together: Oscar Maximillian and Ava Eliot. While some would raise their eyebrows at the 13-year age gap, the pair prove that love is enduring and transcends all “barriers.” Deborra came to Hugh long before showbiz and success, so we’re sure that this love is built to last.\n\nPhoebe Cates and Kevin Kline – Together Since 1989\n\nDoes anyone remember Phoebe Cates from 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High' and her breakthrough role as Linda Barrett? Another one of her more famous roles was in the comedy-horror 'Gremlins'. Anyway, Ms. Cates was quite the sensation in the 80s and was in fact, already married when she starred in 'Gremlins'.\n\nAs it turns out, when she was only 19 years old, she married someone 16 years her elder - Kevin Kline. Despite the age gap and what people ad to say, this hasn’t seemed to faze either of them – thirty years on, and the pair are still very much in love.\n\nMichael J. Fox and Tracy Pollan – Together Since 1988\n\nMichael J. Fox rose to fame on our television screens going as far back as 1976. For you millennials, he’s the guy who plays Marty McFly in the \"Back to the Future\" trilogy. Anyway, we’re here to talk about love, something which Michael J. Fox and his darling wife Tracy Pollan have loads to give to one another.\n\nThe pair got together in the 80s, first meeting while Pollan was shooting 'Family Ties,' but it wasn’t until two years later, on the set of 'Bright Lights, Big City' that they started getting more serious. Fast forward three decades and Fox and Pollan are still together, especially through crucial years up to today, with Fox suffering from Parkinson’s disease.\n\nRon and Cheryl Howard – Together Since 1975\n\nThe prolific Hollywood director Ron Howard has to be one of Tinseltown’s finest. With a filmography that’s extremely impressive, Howard has directed films like 'Apollo 13', 'A Beautiful Mind', 'The Grinch', 'The Da Vinci Code,' and, more recently, 'Solo: A Star Wars Story.' And as with any successful person, there’s always a strong support network behind them.\n\nTo spend more than four decades with someone is incredible and gives all of us hopeless romantics hope that we might be able to get that one day too. The secret, according to the pair, is healthy communication. Not unheard of, but worth noting.\n\nJeff Bridges and Susan Geston Bridges – Together Since 1977\n\nJeff Bridges is an esteemed Hollywood hard-hitter, doing so not without the support and love of his beautiful wife, Susan Geston. Falling for Susan back in 1975, Bridges fondly remembers meeting Geston on the set of 'Rancho Deluxe'. The Montana beauty bewitched Bridges' body and soul – he knew as soon as he laid eyes on her that she was the one.\n\nHow adorable! Have you ever heard of a sweeter thing? The pair wed less than two years later and have remained married for over four decades, sharing three daughters with lots of laughs and love on the way.\n\nMichelle Pfeiffer and David E. Kelley – Together Since 1993\n\nSet up on a blind date back in 1993, Michelle Pfeiffer had no idea she’d be meeting the man she was going to marry. After 25 years of marriage, Pfeiffer claims that TV writer David E. Kelley makes her feel “like the luckiest girl in the room!” Pfeiffer says that “Life is made up of choices, and I’ve not always made good choices but I know I picked the right man.” Well, that’s quite the compliment!\n\nWithin ten months, the pair were saying, “I do,” much to people’s surprise. But people were wrong, and while they speculated it wouldn’t last, we think 25 years is enough proof, don't you?\n\nOprah Winfrey and Stedman Graham – Together Since 1986\n\nThe ultimate inspiration for any female with a dream, it seems that Oprah Winfrey has also nailed it when it comes to her love life. The magnanimous talk show host and multi-billionaire know a thing or two about life and relationships, and while she’s not married to her long-term partner Stedman Graham, she's still managed to keep a steady relationship for more than 30 years!\n\nGraham himself is a businessman, author, and podcaster. While many men would shy away from a woman so powerful and wealthy, Graham has been in for the long haul. The pair were acquainted in 1986 and have been by each other’s sides since then.\n\nJulia Roberts and Daniel Moder – Together Since 2002\n\nJulia Roberts is one of those Hollywood actresses who’s going to be looked back on as one of the greats. Rising to fame in 'Pretty Woman', opposite the very suave and charming Richard Gere, it was the start of a long and successful career in Hollywood. Her smile won over the hearts of Americans and the world, but the man who wakes up to it almost every morning is cinematographer Daniel Moder.\n\nDespite a rocky start to love and dating, Roberts found Moder and hasn’t had a reason to look back since. We think the reason they’ve remained strong in their marriage is that they choose to say out of the limelight and keep their private life, well, private.\n\nSacha Baron Cohen and Isla Fisher – Together Since 2010\n\nWhether you know him as Ali G, Borat, or Bruno, Sacha Baron Cohen has to be one of the funniest (but also one of the most controversial) men in Hollywood. And by his side, an equally funny and stunning wife, Australian actress Isla Fisher. Meeting back in 2002, the pair first laid eyes on one another in Sydney. What seemed to be love at first sight saw the pair walking down the aisle two years later in a Jewish ceremony in Paris.\n\nIsla converted to Judaism for her man, and now they have three children together, splitting their time between London and LA. What a life, right? We absolutely loved Isla Fisher opposite Gal Gadot and Zach Galifianakis in 'Keeping Up with the Joneses (even if it bombed slightly). But we’re here to celebrate Isla and Sacha’s love. And many years more.\n\nTom Selleck and Jillie Mack – Together Since 1987\n\nAt 38, single, Selleck was feeling a bit lonesome. And what do we do when we’re lonely? We take ourselves out on a date! For Selleck, it was to see 'Cats,' a show that he loved so much he kept going back for more. But there was a reason for his fascination with the musical – actress, and dancer Jillie Mack starred in it! The pair went for dinner, and the rest is history – 32 years of history, to be exact.\n\nShe was then seen at every event Selleck was invited to – red carpets, awards shows, and ceremonies - she was “his girl.” The two tied the knot in 1987, welcoming their bundle of joy, Hannah, into the world just a year later, at which point Selleck quit 'Magnum P.I' to focus on his family.\n\nBeyoncé and Jay Z – Together Since 2008\n\nQueen Bey and Jay Z married in April 2008 and have since gone on to become one of the richest couples in the world. With a net worth amounting to over 1.2 billion, it’s no wonder they could afford to buy their precious daughter, Blue Ivy, twins Rumi and Sure, a mini gold Mercedes Benz car.\n\nThey seemed to have a dream relationship, but you never really know what happens behind closed doors. Reading into the lyrics of Beyonce's album \"Lemonade\" will make you realize that the couple may have had a rough patch a while ago, but since the two are still together we assume they worked things out.\n\nElton John and David Furnish – Together Since 1993\n\n“How wonderful life is now you’re in the world” – a line we’re sure Furnish has heard many, many times from his Rockstar husband, Sir Elton John. The pair met more than three decades ago, in 1993, and since then, figured they were just meant to be!\n\nDespite the fact that, back in the 90s, same-sex marriage was frowned upon, the pair still fought for their love and stuck together. They did, however, take the plunge once it was legalized and are blissfully married to this day. What are entertainment industry norms and legal precedents for a couple who is madly in love?\n\nTim McGraw and Faith Hill – Together Since 1996\n\nA power couple on the country music scene, there aren’t many marriages as strong as Tim McGraw and Faith Hill's. The extremely talented, gorgeous couple remains the king and queen of Nashville, with their three daughters perhaps treading in their footsteps. The couple has been married for 22 years and put it down to a strong friendship that has been the basis of a stronger marriage.\n\nTheir love and commitment to one another are pretty astounding, especially given how tough it can be in the limelight. Fun fact: did you know they were each engaged to their respective partners when they met before deciding to give their relationships up and take the plunge? And look where it got them!\n\nWill Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith – Together Since 1995\n\nBox office hit after box office hit, Smith has starred in films like 'Men in Black,' 'Bad Boys,' 'The Pursuit of Happyness,' 'Independence Day,' and most recently, the live-action remake of Disney’s classic 'Aladdin.' Instantly recognizable with his charm and wit, he’s a legend. But what we love most is that the guy we see on the screen is just a super chill, nice dude in real life.\n\nA doting dad and a devoted partner to his wife of 23 years, Jada Pinkett Smith, Will Smith is something of a role model. You might have seen Jada in 'Magic Mike XL,' and she does a very good job! Anyway, 23 years later, they’re killing it – here’s to 23 more!\n\nEllen DeGeneres and Portia De Rossi – Together Since 2004\n\nSince Oprah bowed out, Ellen DeGeneres took the top spot on the podium of America’s most popular and beloved talk show hosts. The charismatic and charming DeGeneres didn’t have the smoothest transition in coming out as gay, but she also helped to raise awareness and the profile of the LGBTQ community. With her Australian wife, Portia De Rossi, by her side, the pair are enjoying the spoils of their success together.\n\nRecently, rumors came about their divorce, to which De Rossi reacted: “The divorce rumors came, and then we really knew the perceptions had changed,” Portia explained. “I’m not kidding. I know it sounds ridiculous, but when that started happening, I thought, ‘Oh, now we’re finally accepted.’ We get the same problems as every celebrity couple.” You go, girls!\n\nSam Elliott and Katharine Ross – Together Since 1984\n\nNot many gentlemen have a voice that naturally registers as low as Sam Elliott’s. A legend in his own right, Elliott recently starred alongside Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper in the remake of the classic tragic love story, 'A Star is Born'. Donning a cowboy hat and sporting a mean mustache, Elliott gave a performance that critics loved.\n\nAs for his personal life, it’s no secret that family is key to Elliott, and that’s exampled in his 35-year-long marriage to Katharine Ross. The pair met on set in 1978 while shooting 'The Legacy.' After six years, the pair tied the knot and have since gone on to have two children together. Happily ever after. We love it.\n\nCyndi Lauper and David Thornton – Together Since 1991\n\nFor the singer of “Girls Just Wanna Have Fun,” you kind of wouldn’t expect Cyndi Lauper to be going with one guy for most of her life, right? Well, it seems Ms. Lauper is precisely the opposite and has remained with her partner in crime David Thornton for a staggering 28 years! Despite the fact that Hollywood is rife with lawsuits and divorce proceedings, these two prove that relationships in Tinseltown can, in fact, survive and even thrive.\n\nWe think it’s owing to the fact that when the pair met, Cyndi was at her worst, going through a bit of a rough patch with her relationships. At the time, she had been dating her manager on and off, but it seemed that Dave Wolff was causing her more drama than happiness. Fast forward, Thornton and Lauper met, became friends, and before they knew it tied the knot in 1991. The rest is happy history.\n\nEmmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux – Together Since 2007\n\nPresident of France Emmanuel Macron surprised everyone when he announced his relationship with Brigitte Trogneux. Why? Well, she’s a little bit older than him – over two decades older, that is. When he married Brigitte, critics had a lot to say about it, but the two stayed strong and remained happily married.\n\nHe first met his wife in high school, when he was 15, and she was his teacher, which is one of the biggest reasons why some frowned upon the unorthodox romance. Sure, it may be surprising, but if it has proved itself for so long, who are we to judge their relationship?\n\nGeorge and Amal Clooney – Together Since 2013\n\nIf there's one thing the public likes to criticize is huge age gaps. Well, the public was in luck when George and Amal Clooney started dating, as they have a 17-year age difference. Amal works with International law and human rights, while George is a mere actor.\n\nIn most cases and in most households, only one side of this relationship is the main breadwinner of the family, and it's not the actor. But this couple isn't like most couples. When they got together, many eyebrows were raised, but they have proven they can make such a relationship work, staying together and even having children!\n\nRosie Huntington-Whiteley and Jason Statham – Together Since 2009\n\nRosie Huntington-Whiteley is an English model that is best known for gracing the runways of Victoria’s Secret fashion shows, along with the covers of multiple international fashion magazines, including Vogue and GQ.\n\nHunky husband Jason Statham, also from England, is well-known for playing the scruffy, angry antihero type in a variety of films, like \"Crank\" and \"The Transporter\" movies. The actor and Huntington-Whitely have a 20-year age gap. She's also taller than him, but they know how to work with what they have got. And to be honest, it's not like what they got is very hard to work with.\n\nMatthew McConaughey and Camila Alves – Together Since 2006\n\nContrary to what some commercials may have led you to believe, Matthew McConaughey is not actually in a relationship with his car. In fact, he’s already taken by his beautiful wife, model Camila Alves. After the two met in 2006, they immediately hit it off and started dating.\n\nIn 2011, McConaughey proposed to Alves on Christmas Day, and she said yes to the actor, who is 14 years her senior. But does age really matter when the people in question both look ridiculously good? The gap in age doesn’t seem to bother the stars, who are still happily married today.\n\nAlec Baldwin and Hilaria Thomas – Together Since 2011\n\nIn 2012, yoga teacher Hilaria Thomas walked down the aisle and said, “I do,” to actor Alec Baldwin. In a turn of events worthy of its own feature film, Alec basically stalked Hilaria in an NYC restaurant, and she pretty much fell in love with him on the spot.\n\nSince Thomas is in the business of health and wellness and Baldwin is an A-lister, it may be pretty difficult to tell that they’re separated by a 26-year age gap. But the couple doesn’t let the age difference get in the way of their happiness. In fact, they’re still together to this day.\n\nAaron and Sam Taylor-Johnson – Together Since 2009\n\nSam Taylor-Johnson met Aaron in 2009 when she directed a film that he just so happened to be acting in. The director was 42 years old, and the actor was 19, but the age gap didn’t seem to have any effect on the connection they made, and they started dating not too long after the meetup.\n\nJust because they don’t have an issue with the 23-year age difference doesn’t mean that everyone felt the same way. The couple was torn apart by several media outlets who criticized the morality of the relationship. During their marriage, the couple had two daughters.\n\nEddie Murphy and Paige Butcher – Together Since 2012\n\nFunnyman Eddie Murphy has a total of 10 children, two of which are with his latest wife, model Paige Butcher. The actor had been married once before to model Nicole Mitchelle. He has also had an exchange of vows, which was somehow not a wedding, but a symbolic union ceremony with Tracy Edmonds, the former wife of musician “Babyface.”\n\nEddie is 18 years senior to his current partner, but you can’t tell by looking at him because he looks incredible for his age! The couple welcomed their second child into the world in 2018 and are still happily together today.\n\nDick Van Dyke and Arlene Silver – Together Since 2006\n\nSo, we’ve seen some age differences in the high 30s in Hollywood. Honestly, it has become so common that 15-year age gaps are starting to look better by comparison. However, if you thought 30 years were the thick of it – you would be wrong! Arlene is a makeup artist and dancer who first met Van Dyke in 2006.\n\nMany criticized the age gap between them – 46 years. To put this in perspective, it means Dick is nearly five decades older than his wife. Literally old enough to be her grandfather. However, the two seem very happy together and are still married today.\n\nBruce Willis and Emma Heming – Together Since 2007\n\nBruce Willis is not one to be dating someone new every other weekend. He only does the long run and he has the proper credentials. You may remember that Bruce Willis's most infamous romantic relationship was his 12-year marriage to actress Demi Moore. The two stars had three daughters together (including actress Rumer Willis) before ending things in 2000.\n\nNine years later, Willis said, “I do,” to his new wife, model Emma Heming. Willis is 22 years older than his current wife, but that shouldn’t come as a shocker since his former wife was 15 years younger than him, too.\n\nRod Stewart and Penny Lancaster – Together Since 2007\n\nRock legend Rod Stewart is one of the biggest names in the business, selling more than 100 million records over the course of his career. In 2007, he met his third wife, television personality Penny Lancaster, and decided to put a ring on it. While he has been married twice before, this is his longest marriage yet.\n\nFans were first heartbroken, but Penny and Rod had found something truly special – even with the enormous age gap between them. The age difference between the two is a substantial 27 years, and, as disappointed as some of his female fans may be, the couple is still happily married.\n\nMel Gibson and Rosalind Ross – Together Since 2013\n\nGibson has children, 7 of which are with his first wife, Robyn Denise Moore. But after that 26-year-long marriage came to an end, Mel Gibson found love again in the form of writer Rosalind Ross.\n\nGibson and Ross first met back in 2014, when the young writer was signed to work for the actor’s production company. They hit it off immediately, and Rosalind fell head over heels for the Hollywood legend. Gibson is an entire 35 years senior to his current wife, but they couldn’t be happier together – even if she is 10 years younger than his oldest kid.\n\nDavid Hasselhoff and Hayley Roberts – Together Since 2011\n\nIf there has ever been a Hollywood celebrity that looks like a quintessential comic book tough guy, it is Baywatch babe David Hasselhoff. Known for running on the beach in a red swimsuit and for his starring role in 'Knight Rider', the man is a legend. The star had married twice before he found his current love, Hayley Roberts, back in 2011.\n\nThe model is a whopping 27 years younger than the actor. The couple decided to make things official in 2017 in an intimate wedding ceremony in Italy. The two share a home in the Hollywood Hills and are rumored to live in the same neighborhood as Justin Bieber and some of the Kardashians.\n\nAmber Tamblyn and David Cross – Together Since 2007\n\nFamous for his standup comedy, his role in 'Arrested Development', and for generally writing and acting in multiple things that make us all laugh, David Cross sounds like a hoot to be around. His actress wife Amber Tamblyn sure thinks so. This adorable couple met on an airplane in 2007, when the actor actually asked to be sat next to the \"Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\" actress.\n\nBy 2011, the stars were engaged, despite the 20-year age gap that stood between them. In 2017, the couple welcomed their daughter Marlow into the world. Although there has been some media criticism about some remarks Cross has made, Tamblyn stands by him to this day.\n\nJamie Cullum and Sophie Dahl – Together Since 2007\n\nListen, the whole “guys should be taller” standard is outdated. Height has nothing to do with love. Like age, it’s just a number. No couple proves this point more than the adorable Jamie Cullum and Sophie Dahl. These two are pretty well-known in their individual careers. Cullum is a singer and songwriter, while Dahl is a model and author.\n\nDahl towers over Cullum by almost half a foot. Dahl once commented about their height difference, stating, “I think if we were both slightly more neurotic people, it would be crippling, but the fact of the matter is that we’re both happy. It’s cool.”\n\nKevin Hart and Eniko Parrish – Together Since 2009\n\nIf you’re into comedy movies (and even if you're not), you most probably know Kevin Hart. With such a giant reputation, it’s not obvious that Hart is just 5’4” tall. Hart is actually three inches shorter than his stunning wife, Eniko Parrish but he doesn’t take any offense to the jokes about it... most of the time.\n\nIn fact, he even makes light of this height difference himself. At a recent red carpet event, he said, “I don’t believe in doing things to manufacture my body to appeal to what I think people might like.” Word. Just be who you are, Kevin!\n\nKristen Bell and Dax Shepard – Together Since 2007\n\nIn both love and comedy, these guys have vowed to always be there for each other. The pair started dating in 2007. Three years later, they announced their engagement. The two are known for airing out their dirty laundry, and they don't feel sorry about it at all.\n\nThey have shared a lot about terrible fights they've had with each other. They also refuse to be referred to as \"couple goals\" because they claim that their relationship, like all relationships, is far from perfect. This is exactly the kind of thing that makes them look so human and relatable. Can we have them over for our next BBQ?\n\nEllen Pompeo and Chris Ivery – Together Since 2006\n\nIf you've seen \"Grey's Anatomy,\" then you can't forget Ellen Pompeo and her character. And considering the fact that the show was first aired in the year 2005, it should be pretty safe to say most of you have tried at least one episode. She's been on the down-low with her relationship with her husband, Chris Ivery, whom she married in 2007.\n\nThe two met at an unlikely place: a grocery store in LA! Ellen has been outspoken about how hard it can be to be in a mixed-race relationship and have mixed-race children and has faced backlash for it.\n\nSalma Hayek Pinault and Francois Henri Pinault – Together Since 2006\n\nFrançois-Henri Pinault is a French billionaire who was lucky enough to marry the esteemed Mexican American actress Salma Hayek. Did you hear that? France, Mexico, and the US — talk about multiculturalism! Salma received a lot of backlash from haters since they didn't think they were a good match, but she did not let the haters get in the way of true love.\n\nThe pair opted for two weddings: one rather intimate one with friends and family, while the other one was a lavish and star-studded night in Italy. The two have one daughter together, named Valentina, born in 2007."
