        "text": "Warren Beatty, 84, is a Hollywood icon, getting his start in the ’60s with films like Splendor in the Grass and Bonnie and Clyde and furthering his career with 1975’s Shampoo and 1990’s Dick Tracy. Warren was a well-known ladies man in his day, rumored to have been with, well, a lot of women. It wasn’t until he met Annette Bening, 63, while the two were working on the 1991 film Bugsy that he decided he was ready to settle down and get married. “I waited a long time to be married,” Warren told AARP magazine in 2016. “When you don’t get married until you’re 54…well, as Arthur Miller said, ‘it comes with the territory,'” he stated, referring to a line from the playwright’s Death of a Salesman. “A salesman is got to dream, boy. It comes with the territory.”\n\nWith that long-lasting romance came four children: Stephen, 29, Benjamin, 27, Isabel, 24, and Ella, 21. “I always knew I wanted to have children,” Warren told AARP. “I wanted to do it well, and I wanted to do it with someone who felt the same way.”\n\nFind out more below about Warren and Annette’s talented and creative family!\n\nStephen Ira Beatty\n\nBenjamin Beatty\n\nBenjamin Beatty was born August 23, 1994. He dabbled in a bit of acting like his parents with small parts in 2018’s UFO and the 2016 Joel and Ethan Coen flick, Hail Caesar! Unlike is movie star parents and acting/writing siblings, Benjamin likes to keep things pretty low-key, staying out of the spotlight. He did post an acceptance letter to Northwestern University in 2013 to his Instagram page, noting his study of communication. It’s unclear if he continued to follow that path or what his career trajectory is currently, but he is often seen at numerous sporting events with dad, so it’s evident the two have a serious bond!\n\nIsabel Beatty\n\nIsabel Beatty was born January 11, 1997. The 24-year-old was inspired by mom and dad to dabble in acting, working in a few shorts like 100 Girls Break Up With Us (2018) and Baggage (2019). She’s also written on a few projects like Quality Sketch, a TV series from 2017. Isabel referred to herself as a “soft hearted writer” in her Twitter bio, often sharing creative and unique posts to her Instagram feed, showcasing her artistic sensibility. The second youngest of the Beatty-Bening family also often shares sweet shots of mom and dad in their younger years (and present day!), showing how strong their family bond is.\n\nElla Beatty"
