        "text": "Warren Beatty’s had an illustrious acting career, but even after 50 years of being in front of and behind the camera, there’s one part of his reputation he just can’t seem to shake.\n\nIn an unauthorized biography by Peter Biskind, published in 2010, the biographer estimated the actor, with a reputation as being quite the ladies’ man, had bedded over 12,000 women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Beatty, speaking to AARP The Magazine in an exclusive interview in their October/November 2016 issue out today, says the numbers are grossly exaggerated.\n\n“Think about it, sleeping with 12,775 people,” The 79-year-old told AARP. “That would mean not just that there were multiple people a day, but that there was no repetition.”\n\nBeatty doesn’t deny dalliances with some of his leading ladies, but insists he “never misled anyone.” “I’m a nice guy,” he adds.\n\nIn fact, it was one of his co-stars that brought his bachelor days to an end.\n\nBeatty recalled meeting his wife, Annette Bening, 58, on the set of “Bugsy” in the early ‘90s.\n\n“During the making of the movie, there was no suggestion as to a future relationship,” Beatty said. “I mean, there was in my head, but otherwise, no.” The actor says he told her, “You don’t have to worry about me.” Bening, always the tough cookie, replied, “Well, I didn’t ask.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut sparks flew after filming was completed and Beatty says he fell in love with her over dinner.\n\nThe pair wed in 1992, when Beatty was in his 50s, and have four children.\n\nBening told AARP that Beatty is an excellent listener and the couple “talk a lot about everything.” Perhaps that’s the secret to their 24-year-marriage.\n\nAs for Beatty, marriage and family life seem to have become his number one priority with his work commitments winding down in recent years.\n\n“It’s a luxury to spend time with your family,” he said."
