        "text": "No more the legendary bachelor: WARREN BEATTY married ANNETTE BENING, the mother of his 2-month-old daughter, in a supersecret ceremony, it was announced in Los Angeles yesterday.\n\n\"I can confirm they were married not too long ago, but no further details will be forthcoming,\" said Nancy Seltzer, Ms. Bening's publicity agent. \"They are both private people and would like to keep details of their wedding private.\" She added, \"They sound very happy.\"\n\nThe marriage is the first for the actor and director, who turns 55 years old on March 30, the day of the Academy Awards presentations. \"Bugsy,\" the film that brought the couple together on screen and off, has 10 nominations, including two for Mr. Beatty: best actor and best director. Ms. Bening, 33, has been married once, to Steven White, also an actor and director.\n\nKATHLYN BENING BEATTY was born on Jan. 8.\n\nOver the years, Mr. Beatty has been romantically linked with a number of female stars. But in the November issue of Vanity Fair, he made a strong statement for monogamy. The magazine quoted him as saying, \"That phrase, 'until death us do part,' I always said if you're going to stand up and make this sort of promise, then you really ought to keep it.\""
