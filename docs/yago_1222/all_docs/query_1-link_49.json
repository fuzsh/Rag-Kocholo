        "text": "Celebrity couples with major age differences have become so common that we hard even bat an eye when we hear of another star dating a much younger parents. While there’s no hard-and-fast rule when it comes to falling in love, many people find their most compatible partners to be close to their age. But in Hollywood, it would appear age is but a number. And by that, we mean that celebrities don’t seem to see sizable age differences. In fact, some stars have found love with partners whose age is decades away from their own. Hey, whatever floats your boat, right?\n\nAdmittedly, these sorts of lopsided relationships can feel a bit dicey if you do the math. Do we really want to dwell on the fact David Foster was 32 years old when now-fiancée Katharine McPhee was born? Or the fact that 45-year-old Leonardo DiCaprio has never dated anyone over the age of 25? No, we do not.\n\nThen again: who are we to judge? If two people find each other when they’re both consenting adults — no matter how far apart they are on the spectrum — there’s technically nothing anyone can say about it. And neither person in these relationships likes to have their motivations questioned.\n\nCatherine Zeta-Jones, who is 25 years her husband Michael Douglas’ junior, for example, has emphasized that she’s happy in her relationships and would like to be left alone, please —so we really have no business questioning whatever works for them.\n\nBesides, life is short. If these celebrity couples with huge age gaps make each other happy, then why not?\n\nA version of this article was originally published September 2018."
