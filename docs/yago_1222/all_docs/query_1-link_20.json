        "text": "Emma Stone and Dave McCary\n\nEmma Stone (\"La La Land\" and \"The Amazing Spider-Man\") and \"Saturday Night Live\" writer Dave McCary have been extremely private about their relationship. They met at the SNL studio in 2016. That was the third time, you may recall, that Emma Stone hosted. This time, McCary directed, and by the end, the two connected. Not a peep for two years.\n\nSince their public engagement announcement on Instagram in March 2021, they had their first baby girl. Being relatively private, Emma and Dave are not seen publicly very often, making us check online every now and then for their relevant statute.\n\nCarey Mulligan and Marcus Mumford\n\nThis couple has been so low-key that few know they have been married since 2012. Carey Mulligan told \"Vogue\" a few years ago that the Mumford & Sons singer was hers, and she didn't want to share. But their story is too adorable to keep quiet. Mulligan met Marcus Mumford at church camp when they were kids.\n\nThey kept in touch by post for years, keeping things traditional. When the former pen pals ran into each other again at a party in 2011, a romance sparked. They tumbled into love with a flurry of love letters. Now, they share two children.\n\nRyan Gosling and Eva Mendes\n\nWhen someone told Eva Mendes that she ought to get out more with hubby Ryan Gosling, she replied, “I’m good. Rather be home with my man than anywhere else in the world.” And that’s where they’ve stayed, apparently. We didn’t even know the couple was having a baby until their first daughter was born.\n\nThey met in 2011 on the set of the film \"The Place Beyond the Pines.\" They were spotted together on the red carpet at the Toronto International Film Festival and at the New York City premiere of the film. And that’s pretty much it. They are very rarely caught together in public.\n\nCameron Diaz and Benji Madden\n\nWe know with certainty now that Cameron Diaz and Benji Madden began dating in May 2014. There was a lot of speculation until, in July of that year, Nicole Richie (married to Benji Madden’s twin brother and bandmate) spilled the deets, and their secret was no longer their secret.\n\nShe confessed to introducing the couple and revealed that they were, in fact, in love. By 2015, news leaked that the celebrity wedding happened and that Gwyneth Paltrow and Robin Antin were there. Rocker Madden opened up for Diaz’s birthday with a sweet Instagram post calling her his “One & Only. True Love.”\n\nAdam Brody and Leighton Meester\n\nAdam Brody (best known for his role in \"The O.C\" and \"Gilmore Girls\" ) and Leighton Meester (\"Gossip Girl\" and \"Single Parents\") crossed paths in 2013 and married in 2014. We don’t get much information voluntarily, but Meester did share with \"Shape\" that she’s a surfer. Brody taught her it’s something they enjoy doing together.\n\nIn December, in full wet suits, of course, the \"Single Parents\" actors have photographed longboarding off the coast of Malibu. The couple has two children. Brody says that parenthood is “pretty magical.” Although they are private about their life, they do occasionally share photos on social media both of themselves and their children.\n\nMargot Robbie and Tom Ackerley\n\nChances are you haven’t heard that the two-time Oscar-nominated actress Margot Robbie is married to British filmmaker Tom Ackerley. The couple has kept it very quiet. They met on the set of a 2014 film project. Robbie acted, and Ackerley assisted with directing. Margot is best known for her role in \"The Wolf From Wallstreet,\" and Ackerley Is most recognized with \"Tonya\" and '\"Terminal.\"\n\nPeople were curious. Swirling rumors finally settled with an in-your-face Instagram engagement photo; she shows us the ring, and she gives us the ring finger. These days, the lovebirds run LuckyChap Entertainment. What’s that? Here are a few of their titles: \"Promising Young Woman,\" \"I, Tonya,\" and \"Birds of Prey,\" plus Hulu’s \"Dollface.\"\n\nDave Franco and Alison Brie\n\nDave Franco and Alison Brie adore being married, and they love working with each other. Most recently, they dove into \"The Rental\" with Brie acting and Franco directing for the very first time. They also enjoyed working together on \"Disaster Artist\" and \"The Little Hours.\" The two have been in the industry for years, and although they are not raving the headlines, they are considered a true promise in Hollywood.\n\nThe couple is rarely photographed in the wild, but Franco let some privacy slip in \"The Rental.\" In an exclusive \"Interview\" magazine interview, Brie fields a series of questions by Franco. In the piece, the \"Community\" and \"GLOW\" actress shared that her husband wrote the script in their normal conversation voices.\n\nCobie Smulders and Taran Killam\n\nCobie Smulders is a name you’ve seen in film credits way more than in gossip magazines. The Marvel actress starred in \"Avengers,\" plus all three sequels, as SHIELD agent Maria Hill. She’s also in \"Spider-Man: Far From Home\" and \"Captain America: Winter Soldier.\"\n\nPrior to that, you’d know her in \"How I Met Your Mother.\" On his part, Killam’s known for his long stint with SNL. Now he’s on \"Single Parents.\" There’s at least one media story about the couple. According to Killam, who dished the deal to \"Us Weekly,\" they fell in love on a road trip in 2005.\n\nMaya Rudolph and Paul Thomas Anderson\n\nThis couple has been together since around 2001, but little is known about them as they have managed to keep themselves under the radar for more than two decades. Few pictures exist. When an unflattering paparazzi image that caught them walking together came out, Anderson responded with a Tweet, “We look like we’re going to kill someone.”\n\nMaya Rudolph, the comedian we recognize impersonating Beyoncé and Kamala on SNL, calls Paul Thomas Anderson her husband and shares four children with him, but technically, the pair are not married. Love, however, has endured. When the eight-time Oscar-nominated director was asked how often Rudolph makes him fall down laughing, he said, “Everyday.”\n\nJavier Bardem and Penelope Cruz\n\nFor Javier Bardem, it’s all about “protecting us.” As such, we have few relationships revealed from the couple, and those that exist are mostly found in their onscreen love affairs. After ten years of marriage and having met in the early nineties, they’ve kept their private life sealed.\n\nIn a rare display of affection, in an acceptance speech at Cannes for the best actor award, Bardem gushed, “I share this joy with my friend, my companion, my love: Penélope: I owe you a lot, and I love you so much.” They are still going strong and are considered one of the more stable couples in Hollywood.\n\nRose Byrne and Bobby Cannavale\n\nRose Byrne and Bobby Cannavale have been together for a while, since 2012, to be exact. Few know much about their relationship, but people assume they are married. It’s a valid assumption; Cannavale calls Byrne his wife. At an appearance on \"The Late Show,\" Cannavale had to face the awkward question, “Why?”\n\nHe told James Corden it’s because he hasn’t found a better word. Neither “girlfriend” nor “partner” appeal. We have, however, seen them together. In \"Adult Beginners,\" they play a married couple, and they also share the screen in \"Annie and Spy.\" Lately, they’ve been taking full advantage of isolation, hunkering down with the kids.\n\nAmanda Seyfried and Thomas Sadoski\n\nThese two dashed off together and got married in 2017. It was a surprise when they announced it on late-night television, especially since they both had been committed to one another until the fall of 2015. After an intense six-month romance, the two tied the knot. Seyfried is best recognized for her role in \"Mean Girls,\" and Sadoski is best known for his role as Don Keefer in \"The Newsroom\" and playing in \"Life in Pieces.\"\n\nNow they have two children and a beautiful life together. We get an occasional peek at it via Instagram. On their third anniversary, Seyfried and Sadoski are pictured smooching with the message, “Happy 3, Tommy.”\n\nTaylor Swift and Joe Alwyn\n\nTaylor Swift kept her relationship with Joe Alwyn as private as possible. However, it all leaked out after the release of her two new albums. Alwyn collaborated and even contributed music on the piano, so the two were not only romanticly involved but also spiced up one another professionally.\n\nWhen she opened up with Paul McCartney in a \"Rolling Stone\" interview and confirmed that the relationship was something she tried to keep private, discussing vividly the frustration of trying to ditch the paparazzi. It’s definitely something to protect. Fast forward six years, and the couple decided to go their separate ways and brought a fairytale romance to an end.\n\nKirsten Dunst and Jesse Plemons\n\nJesse Plemons broke into show biz as \"Breaking Bad’s\" bad boy Todd. And you probably recognize Kirsten Dunst by her upside-down kiss with \"Spider-Man.\" Their worlds collided on the set of the FX series \"Fargo\" in 2015, playing a married couple. Speculation swirled and was seemingly confirmed when Dunst left her boyfriend in 2016.\n\nTwo months later, \"Us\" caught Plemons and Dunst kissing. In 2017, the story was out. \"Us\" announced the pair’s engagement. And, voila, they welcomed a baby boy the following year, in May 2018. As far as we know, they are still engaged and haven't tied the knot, but who cares?\n\nClaire Danes and Hugh Dancy\n\nClaire Danes and Hugh Dancy are married? Yep. \"Homeland\" star Claire Danes, who also played Juliette in Leonardo DiCaprio’s Romeo, has found a star-crossed love that’s all her own. Hugh Dancy, who plays the lead in \"Hannibal,\" is her man. They have been together for more than a decade and manage to keep their love affair tucked deep under and away from the public eye.\n\nThe couple is not a big fan of social media PDAs, but they met in 2007 on the set of \"Evening\" and have been married since 2009. They married secretly in France, and now they have two sons.\n\nRobert Pattinson and Suki Waterhouse\n\nRobert Pattinson learned a few things about the relentless nature of celebrity media while dating Kristen Stewart. The \"Twilight\" hunk has not made a peep about his current relationship with Suki Waterhouse, and neither has she. It’s all very hush-hush, but that didn’t stop \"In Touch\" from publishing a new baby rumor.\n\nApparently, pretty much everyone knew they were trying to get pregnant, but the stunning model proved the rumors were just that. The unreliable source also says the tight-lipped couple is planning to marry eventually. The baby bump never surfaced, and \"Gossip Cop\" called \"US\" out. Who knows, maybe one day they will surprise us, and we will witness Waterhouse walking down the aisle.\n\nFlorence Pugh and Zach Braff\n\nPresumably, Florence Pugh and Zach Braff got to know each other by making Braff’s film \"In the Time It Takes to Get There.\" A shot of them walking hand in hand in NYC weeks later would seem to confirm the assumption. They’ve tried to keep their relationship under wraps because of what Pugh calls a “toxic vibe” seeping out of the internet.\n\nInstagram followers attacked an image of her and former \"Scrubs\" star Braff together within seconds of posting because they thought a 20-year age difference was somehow bad. So, it’s no wonder the couple tries to stay private and make us mind our own business.\n\nPhoebe Waller-Bridge and Martin McDonagh\n\nShowrunners Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Martin McDonagh made their dating life official in 2018. Since then, Waller-Bridge was named the most powerful person on TV, and McDonagh won three Golden Globes for \"Three Billboards,\" including Best Motion Picture. \"Fleabag\" and \"Killing Eve\" writer and actress Waller-Bridge once shared her adoration of a play by McDonagh, but, in general, the couple refuses to comment.\n\nLike many couples in the industry, Waller-Bridge and McDonagh keep their love life to themselves and don't even take the time to update their social media feeds with photos of their personal life. Maybe that's the secret to a happy marriage.\n\nGarrett Hedlund and Emma Roberts\n\nGarrett Hedlund and Emma Roberts roared into 2021 with their new infant son Rhodes who was born in December 2020, as shared on social media. She went on to remark on the pressures of Twitter and Instagram and the constant exposure. The couple kept the real story as lowkey as possible, and in January 2022, the two went their separate ways. But not much else about their relationship has been revealed.\n\nRoberts opened up with a \"Cosmopolitan\" cover story, saying, “Sometimes it makes me sad that I can’t have a private moment.\" The price celebs pay for being big Hollywood stars can sometimes go out of proportion, and for them to find a quiet spot without anyone recognizing and bothering them can be something only to dream about.\n\nMichael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander\n\nIt seems this couple met at the 2013 Toronto Film Festival and then took a trial run playing husband and wife on \"The Light Between Oceans.\" Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander appeared together at the premiere of the 2016 film, and they were married in 2017.\n\nRecently, Vikander shared a sweet gift Fassbender gave her with \"Good Morning America.\" She said he took her on a surprise trip to see her family in Sweden, Europe. “I was able to hang out with my mom and my dad and a lot of family members I haven’t seen in a long time.”\n\nJulia Roberts and Daniel Moder\n\nJulia Roberts and Daniel Moder’s relationship launched in turbulent skies, with both of them in previous relationships and Roberts offering $100,000 to cameraman Moder’s ex-wife Vera for a divorce settlement. But that was years ago. They married in 2002 and have three children. Roberts has publicly said that her hubby Moder is still her “favorite human.”\n\nRoberts has adorned our screens in many great Hollywood moments; however, she will forever be remembered for her role as Vivian in \"Pretty Woman.\" Moder is most recognized for \"Secret in Their Eyes,\" and together, they are one of the strongest couples in the industry.\n\nPeter Sarsgaard and Maggie Gyllenhaal\n\nPeter Sarsgaard from \"Dead Man Walking\" and \"Dark Knight\" star Maggie Gyllenhaal have been together since 2002. In 2009, they married in a quaint Italian chapel in the ancient city of Brindisi, located in the heel of Southern Italy. In the past few years, the pair have been collaborating on \"The Lost Daughter.\"\n\nGyllenhaal directs, and Sarsgaard stars in the story based on the novel by Elena Ferrante. Gyllenhaal was nominated for a Golden Globe for her work on \"The Deuce,\" an HBO series she produced and starred in. For now, Sarsgaard and Gyllenhaal are still strongly hooked on one another.\n\nBrooke Shields and Chris Henchy\n\nBrooke Shields and Chris Henchy were introduced by friends in 1999 on the Warner Bros. lot. They announced their engagement the following year. \"Funny or Die\" creator and long-time writing collaborator of Will Ferrell, Chris Henchy, and ‘80s supermodel turned actress Brooke Shields live in NYC with their two daughters.\n\nThe family made a rare red carpet-appearance in February of last year. They were photographed together for the release of \"Impractical Jokers: The Movie.\" Since then, the couple have not seen together very often and managed to preserve whatever's left of their private life to themselves.\n\nJason Sudeikis and Olivia Wilde\n\nJason Sudeikis and Olivia Wilde began their under-the-radar relationship in 2011. They’re hardly ever photographed together, but they do share two children. At the start of 2021, after a nine-year relationship, the quiet couple quietly separated, effectively putting an end to their engagement. PDA photos emerged, but these showed Olivia Wilde with a new man, Harry Styles.\n\nSudeikis is dealing with it by diving into new acting commitments, and \"US Weekly\" says he is hoping and waiting for Olivia to come back to him. The separation of the two came as a big surprise to many, not only in the industry, as most people didn't even know that the two were together at the time.\n\nKeira Knightley and James Righton\n\nActress Keira Knightley and keyboardist James Righton have two children together. Neither maintains a social media presence, so few PDAs exist. The actress who is known for \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" and \"Atonement\" met Righton in 2011, and they married in 2013 in the south of France. Righton sings and plays for a London electro-rock band and released a solo album in 2020.\n\nKnightley has been honored for her humanitarian work. In 2022, she signed a contract with Apple TV+, and she produced and starred in \"The Essex Serpent.\" Keira is known for her five-year relationship with Rupert Friend, and James has had his share of Hollywood glam with a few other women he dated in the past.\n\nPaul Dano and Zoe Kazan\n\nThis couple is ultra-private. The last we heard from them came in the form of a new baby announcement. Having said that, it was very low-key; they didn’t even release her name at first. Actor/writer/director Paul Dano and Zoe Kazan met in 2007, putting on a play, the first collaboration of many to come.\n\nDano joined Jimmy Fallon on \"The Tonight Show\" in 2018 to announce their film \"Wildlife\" and to confirm the news of their baby girl. Kazan, a Yale graduate who is an actress known for \"The Big Sick\" and a playwright, cowrote \"Wildlife.\" Next, she will star in the Netflix miniseries \"Clickbait.\"\n\nDiane Kruger and Norman Reedus\n\nDiane Kruger and Norman Reedus (\"Walking Dead\") publish social media PDAs all the time. These affections, however, are reserved for their darling daughter. At the same time, they are so super-private they have refused to include photos of her face. Plus, they’ve yet to announce her name!\n\nThe couple came out as an item in 2017 and welcomed their daughter in 2018. When the paparazzi caught an image of their daughter, actress Kruger responded forcefully. Blurring out her child’s face, she reposted it, asserting, “We, as parents, want nothing more than to allow her to grow up in privacy and safety.”\n\nGwyneth Paltrow and Brad Falchuk\n\nThis pair met on \"Glee.\" With Brad Falchuk as co-creator and Gwyneth Paltrow on as a guest star, their behind-the-scenes romance was heading toward steamy by the summer of 2014. By April 2015, it was official. Relationship details are few and far between with this couple, which seems pretty counterintuitive given Paltrow’s TMI tendencies.\n\nHowever, in April of 2020, they revealed the inner workings of their household. Holding down the fort with Gwyneth’s two teens can get tense. She said. “You know, we have the added dynamic of, like, stepparent,” affecting the family. Gwyneth was mostly associated with Chris Martin, Coldplay's lead singer, and they have two children, Apple and Moses.\n\nTaraji P. Henson and Kelvin Hayden\n\n“I said yes, y’all!!!” \"Empire,\" Empress Taraji Henson gushed. That’s how she captioned a photo of her sparkling rock on Instagram in 2018. Ex-NFL Super Bowl and great Kelvin Hayden set the date for spring 2020. Work schedules, family plans, and logistical problems bumped the wedding date again and again. Henson wrote, “I don’t think people understand what goes into wedding planning.”\n\nAlas, after a two-year engagement, Henson announced that plans to marry were canceled. Permanently. Henson hasn't managed to repeat the success she had in \"Empire,\" and Hayden, well, he has been working very hard to keep out of the limelight.\n\nChris Hemsworth and Elsa Pataky\n\nMarvel legend Thor-actor Chris Hemsworth and Elsa Pataky have enjoyed a quiet marriage in their home Down Under. But the Australian couple was spotted in the wild celebrating their 10th anniversary with holiday photos of Christmas 2020 on Instagram. The pair share three children and a lot of love.\n\nPataky is a Spanish actress, born in Madrid, but has been living in Australia with Hemsworth since they married. Thor returned to movie theaters in 2022 with \"Love & Thunder. Fans can also get their Hemsworth fix with the Netflix exclusive \"Extraction.\" The couple has been together for more than a decade, and it does look as if they are going anywhere.\n\nHelen Mirren and Taylor Hackford\n\nThis couple is well-acquainted with the under-the-radar Hollywood marriage lifestyle. In 2018, they celebrated 20 years together. Helen Mirren shared that she and Taylor Hackford rang in the New Year and dined at a fish restaurant in the south of Italy to honor it. Hackford’s birthday is on New Year’s Eve, as is their wedding anniversary.\n\nThe two tied the knot at a Catholic church in Scotland and have been a loving, but not romantic, couple ever since. Mirren says she’s not into Valentine’s Day or anything like that and is just happy to spend her days with an interesting conversationalist and one of her best friends.\n\nElliot Page and Emma Portner\n\nMost of this couple’s open displays of affection will be found on Instagram, so it’s fitting that their romance took flight there. A flurry of exchanges of photos, videos, and comments went full circle in January of 2018, with an image of Elliot Page and Emma Portner’s nuptial bands matching and fingertips touching.\n\nAfter two years of marriage, \"Juno\" star Page came out, and Portner took the opportunity to express her love and support. That said, the two recently called it quits after three years of marriage. Overall, they had a good relationship and, in Hollywood terms, lasted a long time; however, when a celeb dated a celeb, the odds are not in their favor.\n\nElle Fanning and Max Minghella\n\nRelationship rumors between Elle Fanning and her Teen Spirit director Max Minghella, have been percolating for a long time. Neither chose to address being caught cuddling in London in 2018. Most people think it’s their age difference that has kept it so quiet. But then, in 2019, the pair showed up at the MET Gala hand in hand.\n\nTwelve years is not a big deal, and we've seen bigger stars with bigger age gaps. Minghella is best known for starring on \"The Social Network\" and \"The Handmaid's Tail,\" and in recent years, he has been spreading his talent in directing and screenwriting.\n\nCarrie Coon and Tracy Letts\n\nCarrie Coon and Tracy Letts fell in love during the 2010 season of “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” at the Steppenwolf Theatre Company in Chicago. Both nabbed Tony Award nominations. Letts had already received the Pulitzer in 2008 for his play August: Osage County.\n\nThey starred in \"The Post\" together in 2017 and welcomed a baby boy in 2018. The couple wed in 2013. Whenever Letts finishes a writing project, he relies on Coon’s feedback. He sits nervously in another room, listening, and then asks which parts made her laugh. Just as adorable, Coon is moved; he cares so much.\n\nAmber Tamblyn and David Cross\n\n\"Arrested Development\" star David Cross and actress Amber Tamblyn prefer privacy. The couple married in 2012 and share one child, a daughter. \"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\" actress Tamblyn announced her birth in 2017. But sometimes, it’s impossible to keep things under wraps.\n\nTamblyn, an open feminist, faced the dicey media situation of finding her comedian husband (“rightfully”) accused of making discriminatory comments to co-star Charlyne Yi in the form of a bad joke. Tamblyn said the incident found them confronting hard times. The media storm blew over, and their life is private again.\n\nChelsea Peretti and Jordan Peele\n\nFilmmaker Jordan Peele and actress/comedian Chelsea Peretti are a low-key couple, to say the very least. They married secretly in 2016 and had been dating since 2013. Their courtship, however, was very much in the open. Peele adorably proposed to Chelsea via Tweet.\n\nNo words, just an engagement ring emoji, and her Twitter name. Five months later, Chelsea posted a picture of a dog and this note: “[red heart emoji] eloped a bit ago.” The only witness was the pup. Now, they have a little boy as well, born in July 2017. It is clear as day that these two were natural-born storytellers.\n\nJeffrey Dean Morgan and Hilarie Burton\n\nThese two were together ten years before they married in 2019. Hidden away in a quaint New York state farmhouse, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Hilarie Burton reside there with their two kids, far from the bustle of the Big Apple. \"Grey’s Anatomy’s\" Morgan met \"One Tree Hill’s\" Burton at CW, sort of.\n\n\"Supernatural\" star Jensen Ackles knew both actors and decided the two should meet on a blind date. They met up on a double date with Ackles and Danneel Harris at an LA bar, drank too much, and never parted. It wasn’t just the booze, Burton told \"People,\" “His confidence was intoxicating.”\n\nJoshua Jackson and Jodie Turner-Smith\n\nThis couple’s whirlwind romance kicked up in 2019 and closed out the year with \"US Weekly\" breaking the news of their secret wedding. British model Jodie Turner-Smith and actor Joshua Jackson met at his celeb-heavy 40th birthday bash at a West Hollywood club. Showbiz media tracked every move for details.\n\nFinally, the couple made a red carpet appearance at AFI Fest for \"Queen & Slim.\" After two years, Turner-Smith opened up, saying their bond only grows stronger. Meanwhile, the former \"Dawson’s Creek\" star called the year that also brought their baby girl into their lives “the happiest whirlwind” of his life. As of late 2023, the couple announced their divorce.\n\nDaniel Craig and Rachel Weisz\n\nThis pair is surprisingly low-key, considering they’ve been friends since 1994. British actors Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz met long before he was 007, and she was an Oscar-winning actress. But they didn’t start seeing each other as more than friends until the end of 2010. It happened after starring as a married couple in \"Dream House.\"\n\nThey secretly married a year later in a very intimate ceremony. The couple welcomed a daughter in 2018. Since then, we haven't heard much about either, not because they are not up to anything but because they are so good at keeping everything under the radar.\n\nLady Gaga and Michael Polansky\n\nLady Gaga and wealthy financier Michael Polansky have been an item since they were caught smooching at a New Year’s Eve bash heading into 2020. They’ve been together since then. Polansky accompanied her at the inaugural event in DC. Earlier in 2020, Gaga hit Instagram with a post saying they’ve been hunkering down together, playing cards and video games.\n\nSources say he likes to lavish on her. The Oscar-winning singer told Morning Joe he is the love of her life. They work very hard to keep their private life a secret so no one knows how happy or unhappy the couple truly is.\n\nAshley Olsen and Louis Eisner\n\nIt’s no wonder \"Full House\" twin Ashley Olsen avoids publicity like the plague. She turned to the fashion industry and left acting behind at 18. Now she has something else to protect from the spotlight—her boyfriend Louis Eisner, an artist out of Los Angeles.\n\nNobody knows how they hooked up, but they were first spotted in Los Angeles at Hammer Museum’s Gala in the Garden in 2017. Their bi-coastal relationship has been solid ever since. They make it work with Eisner staying with Olsen in New York and her with him in LA.\n\nLiam Hemsworth and Gabriella Brooks\n\nLet's face it - the Hemsworth brothers are never not single - it's just not in their nature. Exhibit A. These lovebirds have been dating for over a year, and it looks like things are getting serious. \"Hunger Games\" actor Liam Hemsworth and English model and actress Gabriella Brooks hosted a New Year’s Eve party at Hemsworth's sprawling Aussie property.\n\nPlus, it seems she may have moved into the estate. Also, Brooks was recently on Hemsworth’s arm at a family birthday party for older brother Luke Hemsworth’s 40th. It’s been kept quiet, no doubt, since Hemsworth and Miley Cyrus were married and divorced, all within a year, ending in 2019.\n\nChristina Aguilera and Matthew Rutler\n\nMatthew Rutler was a production assistant on the set of \"Burlesque \"when he met superstar Christina Aguilera in 2009. The pop diva played a small-town girl who makes it in LA. This couple dishes bold shares on social media but not much in the way of relationship deets. To the point they announced their engagement.\n\nIt was a cryptic Instagram post that has left fans on the edge of their seats since Valentine’s Day 2014. Their daughter, Summer Rain, is growing and becoming a young lady; they’ve been together for over a decade.\n\nKit Harington and Rose Leslie\n\nKit Harington and Rose Leslie are famous for trying to kill each other on \"Game of Thrones.\" Memorably, Ygritte shoots three arrows at Jon Snow. It’s not your average love story. The pair’s real-life love story is more conventionally romantic. They’ve been living in their English Tudor manor house since GOT concluded.\n\nAt the end of 2020, they announced their first child was on the way, but no forthcoming details. They have been together for more than two decades and seem to be one of the strongest and most stable couples in the show biz.\n\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt and Tasha McCauley\n\nThis furtive duo married secretly in December 2014. Before that, all we knew was that Joseph Gordon-Levitt had a girlfriend and that neither of them wanted to openly discuss it. Now it’s out. The actor/director is married to Tasha McCauley, co-founder and CEO of a robotics company based at NASA’s research park in Silicon Valley.\n\nShe met the \"Third Rock From The Sun\" star on a blind date organized by a mutual friend. Tasha McCauley is a very talented woman and has spread her talent in various films; however, no matter what she puts her hands on, she will always be most recognized as Levitt's better half.\n\nSean Penn and Leila George\n\nSean Penn has had an array of prominent wives. He was married to Madonna in the ‘80s and parted ways with Charlize Theron in 2015. Since then, Penn and Leila George have been linked. It came out that they were a couple in 2016, and they tied the knot in the summer of 2020.\n\nIt was a happy trajectory to an on-again, off-again relationship. The word is, they bonded during quarantine. So, it seems natural that they had a Zoom wedding. Don't get too excited, though; perhaps all that bonding time got too much, as they're since gotten divorced\n\nCate Blanchett and Andrew Upton\n\nCate Blanchette and Andrew Upton have been married so long that they exchange gifts like microwaves or vacuum cleaners for their wedding anniversaries. The two-time Oscar-winning actress met Upton on the set of a TV show in 1996. He proposed after three weeks of dating.\n\nThe pair from Australia were joint artistic directors for the Sydney Theatre Company for five years. The \"Lord of the Rings\" actress says they homeschool their four children at their house in Sydney. Now we understand why their relationship is so quiet. With homeschooling four children, it is no wonder she doesn't have time for showing off her clan on social media.\n\nCheryl Burke and Matthew Lawrence\n\nThese two lovebirds met on a blind date and were together for a year. They went their separate ways but then, guess what - they reunited ten years later! \"Dancing With the Stars\" contestant Cheryl Burke and former \"Boy Meets World\" star Matthew Lawrence got back together in 2017.\n\nAfter two years of romance and a charming wedding proposal on her birthday, the lovebirds celebrated their bond by tying the knot at a grand fairy tale wedding in the month of May 2019; however, by the time September 2022 came roaring in, the couple was already divorced.\n\nEllen DeGeneres and Portia De Rossi\n\nSince Oprah bowed out, Ellen DeGeneres took the top spot on the podium of America’s most popular and beloved talk show hosts. With her wife, Portia De Rossi, by her side, the pair have been enjoying the spoils of their success together.\n\nRumors came about their divorce; however, the rumors remained rumors. The couple keeps us updated regularly on their Instagram accounts, and they are stronger together than ever. You go, girls! In February 2023, the two lovely ladies renewed their vows. They may be quiet about the juicy details of their relationship, but they are very public about their love.\n\nTom Selleck and Jillie Mack\n\nAt 38, single, Selleck was feeling a bit lonesome. So he saw 'Cats,' a show that he loved so much he kept going back for more. But there was a reason for his fascination with the musical – actress and dancer Jillie Mack starred in it! The pair went for dinner, and the rest is history – 32 years of history, to be exact.\n\nShe was then seen at every event Selleck was invited to – red carpets, awards shows, and ceremonies - she was “his girl.” The two tied the knot in 1987, welcoming their bundle of joy, Hannah, into the world just a year later, at which point Selleck quit 'Magnum P.I' to focus on his family.\n\nSacha Baron Cohen and Isla Fisher\n\nWhether you know him as Ali G, Borat, or Bruno, Sacha Baron Cohen has to be one of the funniest (but also one of the most controversial) men in Hollywood. And by his side, an equally funny and stunning wife, Australian actress Isla Fisher. Meeting back in 2002, the pair first laid eyes on one another in Sydney.\n\nWhat seemed to be love at first sight saw the pair walking down the aisle two years later in a Jewish ceremony in Paris. Isla converted to Judaism for her man, and now they have three children together, splitting their time between London and LA. What a life, right?\n\nOprah Winfrey and Stedman Graham\n\nThe ultimate inspiration for any female with a dream, it seems that Oprah Winfrey has also nailed it when it comes to her love life. The magnanimous talk show host and multi-billionaire knows a thing or two about life and relationships, and while she’s not married to her long-term partner, Stedman Graham, she's still managed to keep a steady relationship for 32 years!\n\nGraham himself is a businessman, author, and podcaster. While many men would stay away from a woman so powerful and wealthy, Graham has been in for the long haul. The pair were acquainted in 1986 and have been by each other’s sides since then.\n\nMichelle Pfeiffer and David E. Kelley\n\nSet up on a blind date back in 1993, Michelle Pfeiffer had no idea she’d be meeting the man she was going to marry. After 25 years of marriage, Pfeiffer claims that TV writer David E. Kelley makes her feel “like the luckiest girl in the room!” Pfeiffer says, “Life is made up of choices, and I’ve not always made good choices, but I know I picked the right man.” Well, that’s quite the compliment!\n\nWithin ten months, the pair were saying, “I do,” much to people’s surprise. But people were wrong, and while they speculated it wouldn’t last, we think 25 years is enough proof, don't you?\n\nMichael J. Fox and Tracy Pollan\n\nMichael J. Fox rose to fame on our television screens going as far back as 1976. For you millennials, he’s the guy who plays Marty McFly in the 'Back to the Future' trilogy. Anyway, we’re here to talk about love, something which Michael J. Fox and his darling wife, Tracy Pollan, have loads to give to one another.\n\nThe pair got together in the 80s, first meeting while Pollan was shooting 'Family Ties,' but it wasn’t until two years later, on the set of 'Bright Lights, Big City' that they started getting more serious. Fast forward three decades and Fox and Pollan are still together, especially through crucial years up to today, with Fox suffering from Parkinson’s disease.\n\nSting and Trudie Styler\n\nFrom The Police to his solo act, Sting has an instantly recognizable voice that puts him down in history as one of the greats. What’s more is his personal life: he and his wife, Trudie Styler, have been together for more than a quarter of a century! Meeting in 1982, the pair dated for ten years before finally tying the knot in 1992.\n\nIt seems that to spend 35 years with someone must mean they’re doing something right - close friends say that the couple's love is almost teenage-like, in the sense that they’re just so into each other. And Sting himself backs this up, revealing that Trudie remains light in his life (as well as their four kids together).\n\nGisele Bündchen and Tom Brady\n\nBrazilian supermodel Gisele and her New England Patriots quarterback husband, Tom Brady, are incredible together. It just took a meeting to really seal the deal. In 2006, the pair met at a mutual friend’s house, and since then, they've been joined at the hip.\n\nSuper aligned with their beliefs and lifestyle, this couple was made for each other. We’re sure when Brady was a teen, he wouldn’t have dreamed of marrying a stunning Brazilian woman – but hey, life! The pair tied the knot in 2009 and haven’t looked back, welcoming a boy and a girl into their lives.\n\nWarren Beatty and Annette Bening\n\nWith a 21-year age gap, we’re once again shown that age is just a number. And especially when that gap hasn’t stopped Annette Bening and Warren Beatty for 27 years. The pair married in 1992, just a year after she split from her former husband, Steven White.\n\nBeatty, on the other hand, is a bit of a legend, and he’s been acting for almost 50 years. His creative talents as a filmmaker and actor wowed many women in the past, and we’re sure Bening was no exception! The pair have raised four kids together and are looking toward a bright future together.\n\nHarrison Ford and Calista Flockhart\n\nWith his debonair charm and signature smirk, it’s no wonder Harrison Ford wooed the likes of Calista Flockhart. The pair have been married since June 2010 and really seem to be enjoying married life together. With such an unwavering relationship, the pair support each other through everything – for Harrison Ford, it’s aviation! Couples that support one another stay together.\n\nWith such an unwavering relationship, the pair support each other through everything – for Harrison Ford, it’s aviation! Couples that support one another stay together. You will never see these two on the front pages of magazines, never see them on gossip columns, as they manage to preserve a stable and true love story.\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr.\n\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer meets Fred Jones, and apparently, they liked the look of each other enough to get married. Anyway, characters aside, the pair has remained married for almost twenty years. The secret? “We were just friends. That’s one of the reasons I think our relationship has always been so good,” Freddie said.\n\nThe pair met on the set of 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' and started their friendship there. So hey, friends first, lovers later! And they have been going strong ever since. They are, without a doubt, one of our favorite couples on the list.\n\nAdam Sandler and Jackie Sandler\n\nHollywood funnyman Adam Sandler is pretty much a comedic genius when it comes to the genre. Anyone who disagrees, well, they clearly haven’t seen 'Happy Gilmore.' The king of late 90s comedy films, Sandler kept himself busy (and still is keeping busy). You’d think with a hectic schedule, your love life would take a bit of a hit, but that is not the case for Sandler.\n\nHe makes sure to set aside time for his family, which we think is extremely important. Devoted to his two daughters and wife of 20 years, Jackie, Sandler is quite the family man. We’re sure that the checks he brings into the family also help with keeping that marriage strong.\n\nJamie Lee Curtis and Christopher Guest\n\nThe stunning Jamie Lee Curtis and her beau, Christopher Guest, have been married for over thirty years. We love the way they “met,” too: Curtis, in fact, spotted Christopher Guest on the cover of a magazine one day. From that one picture, she proclaimed that this man would be her future husband. And it actually happened!\n\nThe pair have two children together. And did you know that Christopher Guest has the title of a Baron? Pretty cool! Jamie Lee Curtis and Christopher Guest are Hollywood's old school, and not because of the year they were born. They have class, they have style, and they have an amazing relationship we can only envy.\n\nJohn Travolta and Kelly Preston\n\nHitting our screens with some knee-dropping, toe-tapping, and electric dance moves, the star of 'Saturday Night Fever is a Hollywood heavyweight. But back to his love story, John Travolta came across Kelly Preston on the set of 'The Experts in 1989.\n\nThe pair married two years later and enjoyed a 28-year marriage that produced three kids. Tragically, in July 2020, Kelly passed away in Florida. They will always be remembered as one of Hollywood's greatest couples. They were magic between the two whenever they walked the red carpet together, and only a few pairs in the industry kept on strong as these two did.\n\nCyndi Lauper and David Thornton\n\nFor the singer of “Girls Just Wanna Have Fun,” you kind of wouldn’t expect Cyndi Lauper to be going with one guy for most of her life, right? Well, it seems Ms. Lauper is precisely the opposite and has remained with her partner in crime David Thornton for a staggering 28 years!\n\nDespite the fact that Hollywood is rife with lawsuits and divorce proceedings, these two prove that relationships in Tinsel Town can, in fact, survive and even thrive. When the pair met, Cyndi was at her worst, going through a bit of a rough patch with her relationships. At the time, she had been dating her manager on and off. Fast forward, Thornton and Lauper met, became friends, and, before they knew it, tied the knot in 1991.\n\nSarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick\n\n\"Sex and the City\" meets \"Ferris Bueller,\" this Tinsel town couple has been together through it all. The fashionista from Hollywood, Sarah Jessica Parker, found her man in Matthew Broderick, and they’ve lasted for just over two decades. The pair first locked eyes on one another when they were introduced through Sarah’s brother.\n\nIt seems that while they keep their personal life under wraps, Sarah Jessica did provide some insight as to her true feelings: \"Call me crazy, but I love him. We're very devoted to our family and our lives. I love our life. I love that he's the father of my children, and it's because of him that there's this whole other world that I love.”\n\nAnna Kournikova and Enrique Iglesias\n\nWe're sure Enrique has serenaded his wife of almost two decades, Anna Kournikova, many, many times! The couple started dating after meeting in 2001 on the set of his “Escape” video clip. At 21, Kournikova gave up the Wimbledon pursuit and decided to follow her heart instead. Fast forward, and Enrique and Anna have a gorgeous set of twins together, who seem to love their football as much as their dad.\n\nNot to mention inheriting the good looks from both sides. They are one of the modest couples in Hollywood and maintain a quiet and stable relationship. Even though they have been together for so many years, the two never officially married.\n\nCatherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas\n\nThe stunning Catherine Zeta-Jones shocked the world when she and Michael Douglas announced their engagement. The Welsh beauty has taken the leading lady role in many films, from \"Entrapment\" to \"The Mask of Zorro.\" And Michael Douglas, well, his reputation precedes him – we really don’t have to list his slew of films!\n\nProminent in Hollywood, the pair have grown from strength to strength and stuck by one another. Despite signing a prenup before saying “I do,” it’s highly unlikely that the pair will need to call in the lawyers, a la \"Intolerable Cruelty!\" Almost twenty years later, the pair have two kids together and have earned a lavish lifestyle. Cheers to that!\n\nGoldie Hawn and Kurt Russell\n\nThese two screen veterans are still together after more than 35 years. You might remember the hilarious rom-com 'Overboard,' which saw a snobbish Hamptons-loving socialite suffer from amnesia before being tricked into thinking she was married to the single father of three, played by Kurt Russell.\n\nBy that time, the pair had been dating for 5 years, deciding in 1982 that they would never marry and just raise their blended family as “committed partners.” And they’ve been committed partners ever since. Goldie Hawn once told the media that the secret to their partnership was the fact that they’d never walked down the aisle.\n\nNnamdi Asomugha & Kerry Washington\n\nNnamdi Asomugha had his breakout performance in 2017 at the Sundance Film Festival for his lead role in Crown Heights. Before that, he was one of the best cornerbacks the NFL has ever seen. His wife, Kerry Washington’s successful career on stage, in film, and on TV has spanned over two decades.\n\nShe is admired for playing Olivia Pope on the popular ABC TV series \"Scandal,\" which earned her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress. The couple met when Washington performed on Broadway, and Asomugha attended. She informed him she didn’t date athletes, and he responded that he didn’t date actresses. The couple married in 2013, and they have two children.\n\nEmily Ratajkowski & Sebastian Bear-McClard\n\nWe don't have exact dates for when this couple, made up of supermodel Emily and actor Sebastian, actually started dating – or even when they got engaged. However, while the dating relationship itself might not have been very long, Ratajkowski apparently kept Sebastian in the friend zone for two years. Or, as she put it, she spent two years vetting him.\n\nThe couple tied the knot in a surprise ceremony at New York's City Hall in February 2018. The couple had maintained a quiet and modest love story and managed to keep all of the gossip to themselves. However, Rata and Seb went their separate ways in 2022.\n\nMeryl Streep and Don Gummer\n\nThe way these two met was in the light of some dark circumstances. Streep was mourning the loss of her boyfriend at the time, John Cazale, who passed away too early in life. At the time, her brother Harry came along with a friend - Don. Just six months later, the pair said: “I do.”\n\nTheir wedding was a pretty low-key affair, happening in 1978. While he isn’t a “celebrity” in the same way Meryl Streep is, he’s quite a celebrated sculptor! He has been doing him, winning awards, and having his work featured in public commissioned art! Pretty cool!\n\nKarlie Kloss and Josh Kushner\n\nThe supermodel, who is known for her extremely long legs and overall runway presence, did not opt for a fellow model as her spouse or even an A-lister at that. But while he doesn’t have Hollywood fame or model status, he is a very successful venture capitalist. Well, real estate heir. Lucky…both of them!\n\nLooks, dollars, and love - seems that the model and Project Runway judge hit the jackpot! For those interested, Kushner is Ivanka Trump’s husband’s brother! Guess big wealth runs in the family… and the couple had their first child in March of 2021. As of May 2023, Kloss was pregnant with her second child.\n\nJerry and Jessica Seinfeld\n\nJerry and Jessica's love story began during their bagels and lox days when they first fell head over heels for each other. However, their journey has evolved as they both embraced a health-conscious lifestyle. Despite their dietary changes, Jessica's Long Island Chicken Parmesan, famously cooked on their very first date, still holds a special place in their hearts.\n\nNow happily married for almost two decades, Jerry affectionately refers to Jessica as his \"best friend.\" Their enduring bond and mutual admiration serve as a testament to the secret of their relationship's longevity: genuinely liking and cherishing one's significant other. Clearly, affection and friendship (and a lot of jokes) can sustain love for a lifetime.\n\nLisa Bonet and Jason Momoa\n\nJason Momoa has been deeply in love with Lisa ever since he laid eyes on her in The Cosby Show. The couple were together for almost two decades despite their 12-year age gap. Sadly, the couple decided to call it quits in early 2022; Lisa was also previously married to Lenny Kravitz and had one child, Zoe Kravitz.\n\nJason Momoa is best recognized with \"Aquaman,\" \"Justice League,\" and many other Marvel creations, and Bonet will probably never be able to completely get rid of Denise Huxtable. She is here to stay. She played Denis for more than six years and then carried on with her on \"A Different World.\"\n\nAlexis Bledel and Vincent Kartheiser\n\nThe Gilmore Girls and Handmaid’s Tale star met fellow actor and husband Vincent Kartheiser when she played his mistress in the ’50s set drama Mad Men. The stars started dating when they wrapped filming, got married in 2014, and welcomed their son into the world the following year.\n\nSince the \"Mad Man\" days, Bledel has continued to act in television and film, including her role as Emily Malek in the Hulu series \"The Handmaid's Tale.\" Kartheiser has also continued to act in both television and film, including his role as the character Eddie in the Amazon Prime Video series \"Das Boot.\"\n\nAmy Schumer and Chris Fischer\n\nEver dated someone who can't cook? Well, this wasn’t the case for Amy Schumer and her hubby! Chris Fischer is a chef! If we heard that, we’d be getting down on one knee, too! Delicious. Anyway, the farmer who hails from the gorgeously scenic Martha’s Vineyard married the comedian and actress in 2018.\n\nHow did they meet? Fischer cooked his way to her heart when she was at his family’s farm visiting the area. The two lead a relatively modest and private life, making it sometimes impossible to recognize them walking down the road. Schumer has continued to work in comedy and acting since her marriage, with notable projects including her comedy special \"Growing\" and her role in the film \"I Feel Pretty.\"\n\nJim Parsons and Todd Spiewak\n\nIt was 15 years before \"The Big Bang Theory\" actor Jim Parsons and his now-husband Todd Spiewak got together. According to Parsons, he didn’t think much of the wedding thing but decided to go ahead with it to “legalize this thing.” The two wed in May 2017 in New York City’s Rainbow Room. Before the wedding, Parsons never felt the need to get married, as he was fine staying as they were.\n\nHe likened the experience of being together with Spiewak as ‘close to being with God.’ Since their marriage, Parsons has continued to act in television and film, including his role as Michael in the film \"The Boys in the Band.\"\n\nMatt Bomer & Simon Halls\n\nEveryone has heard of secret weddings. But not many may know that secret marriages actually exist. That is exactly what happened to Matt Bomer and Simon Halls. The two were secretly married for three whole years. Not many people knew of their marriage, and their wedding was attended only by both parties’ close family members and friends.\n\nBomer has continued to act in television and film since his marriage, with notable projects including his role as Larry Trainor, Negative Man, in the television series \"Doom Patrol.\" Halls has continued to work as a publicist and has represented a number of high-profile clients throughout his career.\n\nJennifer Lawrence & Cooke Maroney\n\nLawrence managed to bag gallery director Cooke Maroney after only a few months of dating. The silver screen star started dating the director of New York's Gladstone Gallery back in June of 2018, and it wasn't long before Cooke popped the question.\n\nThey kept their relationship relatively quiet and private. The two got married in 2019 in a comparatively intimate wedding (a mere 150 guests) and are still together. In fact, the relationship has become so important to Lawrence that she's decided to take a step back from acting in order to help it stay strong.\n\nNatalie Portman and Benjamin Millepied\n\nThe very lovely Natalie Portman, who has now relocated to Australia, is clearly a fan of keeping a relatively low profile. Do you even know who her husband is? Yeah. So the guy is Benjamin Millepied, whom she met on the set of the terrific “Black Swan” back in 2009.\n\nHe worked as the choreographer and also had a role in the film! The pair had a son first in June before Portman married him in August 2012. Since their marriage, Portman has continued to act in film, as well as direct and produce. She has also been involved in a number of philanthropic efforts, including advocating for animal rights and environmental conservation.\n\nAlexa Demie and Christian Berishaj\n\nEven though she’d been acting for years, it wasn’t until her iconic role as Maddy Perez in the hit HBO series “Euphoria” that gorgeous actress Alexa Demie rose to stardom. Fortunately, her real-life romance isn’t at all like the one on the show. Demie has been dating singer, record producer, and music engineer Christian Berishaj since 2017.\n\nThey met after Alexa starred in one of his music videos in early 2017, and they’ve been together ever since. Even though Alexa is extremely private about her social media posts, paparazzi have managed to sneak some photos of the couple being romantic on several occasions.\n\nSydney Sweeney and Jonathan Davino\n\nThe stunning blonde actress Sydney Sweeney started making waves in “The Handmaid’s Tale” series on Hulu and then skyrocketed to fame with her role in “Euphoria” and “White Lotus.” But it seems this beauty likes to keep her private life very private, and as she’s said in several interviews – “doesn’t like to date anybody in the spotlight.”\n\nBack in 2018, she attended an Emmy party and some other gala events with Chicago businessman Jonathan Davino. The two were later spotted at a basketball game being very cute together, and in 2022, news finally broke out that they had gotten engaged! We’re all waiting for a glamorous wedding, which we probably won’t get to see any of, seeing as Sweeney and her beau love her privacy.\n\nDolly Parton and Carl Thomas Dean\n\nEven though the beloved ‘Queen of Country’ Dolly Parton has been married to Carl Dean for over 50 years, the couple has never been one to publicize their relationship. They met in Nashville in 1964, the day that Dolly arrived at the city and went into a laundromat to wash some dirty clothes. They immediately clicked and started dating, getting married two years later.\n\nDolly has often said that one of the reasons their relationship has lasted is because they’ve kept it private and away from all the media. She says Dean has nothing to do with show business and is a simple, loving man who balances her crazy life of fame. Well, something must be working out if they’ve stayed together for over five decades.\n\nLizzo and Myke Wright\n\nThe international star and singer of “Truth Hurts,” Lizzo is known for being a strong, independent woman who lives her life on her own terms. But that doesn’t mean she can’t fall in love, and she has! Since 2021, she and stand-up comedian Myke Wright have been spotted around Los Angeles and attending several parties together.\n\nThey always look very happy and laugh hysterically, which is basically what you want from a relationship. The couple have been together since 2021 and seem to be going strong. Ironically, they met in 2016 when they were co-hosting the MTV series “Wonderland.” Let’s see if there are wedding bells in these lovebirds’ future!\n\nGerard Butler and Morgan Brown\n\nThe Scottish actor who made his fame with “300,” “Law-Abiding Citizen,” and other dozens of hit blockbusters has quite a history of dating. But apparently, he’s been sort of steady with interior designer and real-estate developer Morgan Brown for the last nine years. Even though they’ve reportedly broken up and gotten back together many times, they seem to keep working at it.\n\nBrown, who was also a former model, has been seen by the Hollywood actor’s side in many A-list events and film sets. Even though Brown has a child from a previous relationship, she’s revealed in interviews that she’d like to start a family with Butler. Let’s hope their insane working schedules allow it.\n\nNaomi Watts and Billy Crudup\n\nThe “King Kong” star Naomi Watts and heartthrob from “Almost Famous” Billy Crudup have been dating since 2017, and they’ve kept it very quiet until 2022. The talented actors met for the first time back in 2009 in a Broadway play they both starred in; however, at the time, they were both involved with other people.\n\nIn 2017, they worked together on the Netflix series “Gypsy,” and sparks flew. They waited a whole five years to finally announce their relationship to the world at the 2022 SAG Awards. Since then, they’ve appeared on several red-carpet events together, with Naomi recently posting on social media for Crudup’s birthday with the caption “Happy Birthday, my love.”\n\nIlana Glazer and David Rooklin\n\nIlana Glazer has been on the comedy scene for years, doing stand-up, producing, writing, and directing her own projects. In 2014, she rose to fame when Comedy Central bought her web series “Broad City,” which she created with Abbi Jacobson. Glazer has never been too keen to reveal details on her personal life; in fact, few people knew that by 2023, she’d been married to scientist David Rooklin for over a decade!\n\nThe comedian and the scientist met in 2011 in Washington Square Park in New York City, and she describes it as love at first sight. They got married in a private ceremony in 2012 and honeymooned in Iceland. Eleven years later, they’re still very happily married.\n\nGeorges LeBar and RuPaul\n\nThe iconic creator of “RuPaul’s Drag Race” is not only a drag queen icon across the world, RuPaul is also an incredibly talented TV personality, producer, writer, host, and model. And he’s also quite private about his personal life! It turns out that RuPaul has been in a serious relationship with Australian author and rancher Georges LeBar since 1994, finally getting married in 2017.\n\nThe couple have been together for over two decades, and according to RuPaul, they couldn’t be happier. Even though their lives are completely different – one is plowing fields and writing books while the other is hosting a world-famous drag queen TV show – they’re crazy about each other.\n\nCarrie Underwood and Mike Fisher\n\n“American Idol” winner Carrie Underwood has seen nothing but success in the music industry since 2005. She’s also somehow managed to keep her fairytale marriage very under wraps. The beautiful blonde singer met Canadian hockey player Mike Fisher back in 2008 at a mutual friend’s party. They fell madly in love, and two years later, they got married in 2010.\n\nIn 2015, they had their first child together, a son named Isaiah, and four years later, in 2019, they welcomed their second baby boy. Carrie says she wants a large family, so it’s safe to expect more children from this beautiful couple in the very near future.\n\nKristen Stewart and Dylan Meyer\n\nThe “Twilight” star Kristen Stewart met the beautiful actress and writer Dylan Meyer back in 2013, but it wasn’t until 7 years later they reconnected through a mutual friend and fell hard for each other. Meyer comes from a family of screenwriters and is very much in the Hollywood scene. But undeniably, she became a household name when she started a serious relationship with Stewart in 2019.\n\nIn 2021, Meyer proposed to Stewart, and these beautiful women got officially engaged. But they certainly managed to keep the whole relationship quite private for years. It wasn’t until the 2022 Oscars party that they publicly announced they were married. Since then, they’ve been known to post the occasional romantic social media post.\n\nKaley Cuoco and Tom Pelphrey\n\nKaley Cuoco rose to fame after playing Penny in the hit series “The Big Bang Theory” and most recently in HBO’s “The Flight Attendant.” But despite seeing this blonde actress on every billboard in town, she’s been quite private about her love life, which seems to be going amazingly well. Back in April 2022, Cuoco’s agent told her she had found “the perfect match” for her, and it was “Ozark” actor Tom Pelphrey.\n\nRemember Laura Linney’s problematic brother on the show, Ben Davis? Well, that would be Pelphrey. It seems Cuoco’s agent was right because the two actors met at an “Ozark” premiere party and fell almost instantly for each other. They’ve been dating ever since, and they recently announced they’re having a baby together!\n\nZöe Kravitz and Channing Tatum\n\nThe “Magic Mike” star Channing Tatum and new ‘Catwoman’ Zoe Kravitz began to be the center of the Hollywood rumor mill in early 2021. They worked together in 2017, both voicing characters in “The Lego Batman Movie,” and they became good friends. Fast forward to 2019, and Tatum was divorcing Jenna Dewan at the same time that Kravitz was splitting up from husband Karl Glusman.\n\nTatum and Kravitz were photographed together around NYC several times since the start of 2021, but Kravitz said they were simply collaborating together as she wanted to cast him in her upcoming film “Pussy Island.” They haven’t officially announced their relationship, but the two actors seem to be quite involved with each other.\n\nJulie Yaeger and Paul Rudd\n\nPaul Rudd is one of those comedy actors who’s been around since the 90s and is still one of the most beloved celebrities in Hollywood. Apart from being a great actor, he just looks like a genuinely nice guy. And his wife of 20 years, Julie Yaeger, must think so too. If you’re surprised to learn Rudd has been married for two decades, you’re not alone.\n\nThe actor and his wife keep their relationship very far away from the media. Yaeger, a screenwriter and producer, met Rudd at his publicist’s office in the early 2000s, and they immediately hit it off. They tied the knot in a small, intimate ceremony in 2003 and have been happily married ever since. They have two gorgeous kids.\n\nHunter Schafer and Dominic Fike\n\nSince her debut as Jules in the hit HBO series “Euphoria,” nobody can stop talking about Hunter Schafer. Her beauty, talent, and fashion sense are simply impeccable, and apparently, so is her love of privacy. Even though you see her on the cover of every magazine and Hollywood party lately, how much do we really know about Hunter’s personal life?\n\nUntil recently, nobody even knew she was in a relationship with “Euphoria” co-star Dominic Fike. They met in 2021 on the set of “Euphoria,” and just as their on-screen characters developed a romance, it happened in real life. By January 2022, they’d started to give hints about their relationship, and in February of the same year, they posted their first post as a couple on social media.\n\nLorde and Justin Warren\n\nOne thing that Lorde has always been vocal about is her need to keep her personal life private – “I’m not good at having a public-facing existence.” Well, she’s certainly managed to do so since very few people knew she’d been dating music exec Justin Warren since 2015.\n\nWarren is the American promotions director for Universal Music in New Zealand, and he first met Lorde while working together in 2009. Six years later, they began going out and seem to still be together to this day. Even though Warren is 17 years Lorde’s senior, that doesn’t seem to be a problem at all, and the couple looks quite happy in the few photos that paparazzi have managed to sneak by.\n\nAdele and Rich Paul\n\nIt was only in the NBA finals of the summer of 2021 that Adele and Rich Paul were seen publicly as a couple. Adele confirmed they’d only been dating for a few months, and things were going very well. Paul, who represents some of the biggest names in basketball, is crazy about the international pop star, whom he met at a party.\n\nAdele has often said in interviews that she thinks “he’s the funniest man alive,” and what more could you ask from a partner? The two seem to be making things more official, as they were recently photographed attending the 2023 Grammy Awards together. Also, Adele has said a thing or two about wanting a second kid – with Paul!\n\nLisa Kudrow and Michael Stern\n\nIt’s hard to imagine the quirky Phoebe Buffay from “Friends” would keep anything private, but that’s exactly how Lisa Kudrow is about her privacy in real life. The talented actress has been married to advertising executive Michel Stern since 1995! And surprisingly, very few people knew about this.\n\nThey met in the 1980s in France, and apparently, the sparks flew almost instantly. They dated for a few years before tying the knot, though. In 1998, they had a son together, and more than 30 years later, the couple is still going strong. Kudrow often jokes about the fact that Stern is her biggest fan, that he loves watching “Friends” reruns over and over.\n\nEd Sheeran and Cherry Seaborn\n\nThe famous “Shape of You” singer Ed Sheeran has a love story that dates back to primary school. He and his wife, Cherry Seaborn, have known each other since they were eleven years old and studied at the same school in England. However, they were good friends for many years, only getting romantically involved in 2015 after reconnecting at a mutual friend’s party in NYC.\n\nSeaborn had moved to the city to work in an accounting firm after graduating from Business school in England. She was also a star field hockey player in college. In 2018, the couple got married in a very small and private ceremony, which they celebrated by eating curry takeout at home.\n\nGuy Fieri and Lori Brisson\n\nThe “Food Network” star Guy Fieri has been taking us by storm since his debut on the famous TV channel in 2006. He has his own talk shows, owns several restaurants, has authored dozens of cookbooks, and is basically the Superman of the culinary world.\n\nHe’s also a very private person when it comes to his personal affairs, such as his marriage of over 20 years to Lori Brisson. The two met in 1992 at a restaurant in California, and Fieri said he was immediately smitten by her blue eyes and blonde hair. Three years later, they got married and are still going strong with two kids and 20 years later.\n\nMaya Hawke and Spencer Barnett\n\nEven though she’d been on screen before, it wasn’t until her role as Robin Buckley in the hit Netflix series “Stranger Things” that Maya Hawke skyrocketed to fame. Of course, it doesn’t hurt that she’s Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke’s daughter. Apart from serious acting skills, Maya is also an amazing singer-songwriter and model and a fan of keeping her personal life out of the spotlight.\n\nShe began dating musician Spencer Barnett, whom she met at a mutual friend’s house, in early 2022. However, it was virtually impossible to find a photo of the two together. It wasn’t until August of 2022 that Barnett posted a romantic photo of them on Instagram, and it seems the young couple is still going strong."
