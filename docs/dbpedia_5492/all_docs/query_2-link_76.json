        "text": "“I was struck by a performance of the Frenchman in While the Sun Shines, so true in style and accent that I looked for a French name on the program. [But] It was Mr. Cushing, and he speaks no French. Here evidently was an actor, and his test for Osric disposed of the last of our problems…”\n\n“Squatting on a heap of rubble, deep in Shakespearean thought, [when] I gradually became aware of two figures [police detectives], standing with hands in pockets, staring at me intently.\n\nDeserters from the armed forces were being rounded up, and they suspected I was one. They accosted me with a quick-fire interrogation, random questions which utterly confused my Osric-ridden brain.”\n\n“My ambition required it, I required it of myself. I knew it [becoming a serious actor] wouldn’t happen unless I crashed that market…and I just went on and on, and after about a year the Press referred to me as ‘that Shakespearean actor.’ Then I knew it had been done.”\n\n“[the] dangers involved in what I had conceived for this moment presented themselves to me in the light of the following five possibilities: I could kill myself, I could damage myself for life, I could hurt myself bad enough to make recovery a lengthy business, I could hurt myself only slightly, or I could get away with it without harm. The odds seemed to me to be quite evenly disposed among these five alternatives…I felt so strongly then that this film was by far the most important work of my life that I regarded the first of the five possibilities with an unworried steadiness that gave me a mild feeling of surprise; but I’ve always known when to take advantage of something.”\n\n“They looked at me as at a really stupid man who could not appreciate what he was asking…Not without a tinge of despair, I mounted the platform, from the edge of which I asked my King to move backwards away from me, further, further still. When he was at a distance I thought I could just cover in an outward dive including the decreasing downward journey outwards, I said: ‘I am going to say…‘Then venom, to thy work,’ and then I’ll jump onto him…Okay roll them.”\n\n“In the following second and a half everything worked like a dream—in fact, like the dream I had so often rehearsed to myself. The landing was just right, my King fell back quite beautifully; unbelievingly I scrambled up off his body and was then frightened by his groaning. My weight hitting him under the chin had knocked him out. The one brave moment of my life was over.”\n\n“Another dear lady who added generously to my farmyard and battalion was Vivien Leigh. I was in Laurence Olivier’s Old Vic Company which toured Australia for a year in 1948, and one day she caught sight of me looking longingly through a shop window, nose pressed against glass, hopelessly captivated by a boxed set of The 11th Hussars…\n\n‘Would you like that for your birthday?’ she asked.\n\n‘Oh, so very much,’ said I, wistfully.\n\nSeveral weeks later, when the day dawned, I was a little dismayed not to find it amongst all the other wrapped gifts…But in the evening when we got to the theater, there it was on my dressing room table, with a card saying ‘AH-HAH!—you thought I’d forgotten, didn’t you?! Love—Vivien and Larry. X”\n\n“Just a statement of fact, and not meant unkindly, his criterion for success being based entirely upon how much was in the bank. On that basis, he was dead right, but it hurt deeply, and I went back to Helen feeling lower than a snake’s belly. She asked me how I’d got on, and I noticed her lips tighten when I told her, but she made no comment.”"
