        "text": "Laurence Olivier could speak William Shakespeare's lines as naturally as if he were \"actually thinking them\", said English playwright Charles Bennett, who met Olivier in 1927. Laurence Kerr Olivier was born in Dorking, Surrey, England, to Agnes Louise (Crookenden) and Gerard Kerr Olivier, a High Anglican priest. His surname came from a great-great-grandfather who was of French Huguenot origin.\n\nOne of Olivier's earliest successes as a Shakespearean actor on the London stage came in 1935 when he played \"Romeo\" and \"Mercutio\" in alternate performances of \"Romeo and Juliet\" with John Gielgud. A young Englishwoman just beginning her career on the stage fell in love with Olivier's Romeo. In 1937, she was \"Ophelia\" to his \"Hamlet\" in a special performance at Kronborg Castle, Elsinore (Helsingør), Denmark. In 1940, she became his second wife after both returned from making films in America that were major box office hits of 1939. His film was Stürmische Höhen (1939), her film was Vom Winde verweht (1939). Vivien Leigh and Olivier were screen lovers in Feuer über England (1937), 21 Days (1940) and Lord Nelsons letzte Liebe (1941).\n\nThere was almost a fourth film together in 1944 when Olivier and Leigh traveled to Scotland with Charles C. Bennett to research the real-life story of a Scottish girl accused of murdering her French lover. Bennett recalled that Olivier researched the story \"with all the thoroughness of Sherlock Holmes\" and \"we unearthed evidence, never known or produced at the trial, that would most certainly have sent the young lady to the gallows\". The film project was then abandoned. During their two-decade marriage, Olivier and Leigh appeared on the stage in England and America and made films whenever they really needed to make some money.\n\nIn 1951, Olivier was working on a screen adaptation of Theodore Dreiser's novel \"Sister Carrie\" (Carrie (1952)) while Leigh was completing work on the film version of the Tennessee Williams' play, Endstation Sehnsucht (1951). She won her second Oscar for bringing \"Blanche DuBois\" to the screen. Carrie (1952) was a film that Olivier never talked about. George Hurstwood, a middle-aged married man from Chicago who tricked a young woman into leaving a younger man about to marry her, became a New York street person in the novel. Olivier played him as a somewhat nicer person who didn't fall quite as low. A PBS documentary on Olivier's career broadcast in 1987 covered his first sojourn in Hollywood in the early 1930s with his first wife, Jill Esmond, and noted that her star was higher than his at that time. On film, he was upstaged by his second wife, too, even though the list of films he made is four times as long as hers.\n\nMore than half of his film credits come after Der Komödiant (1960), which started out as a play in London in 1957. When the play moved across the Atlantic to Broadway in 1958, the role of \"Archie Rice\"'s daughter was taken over by Joan Plowright, who was also in the film. They married soon after the release of Der Komödiant (1960).\n\nProbably best-remembered for his turbulent personal life with Elizabeth Taylor (whom he married twice), Richard Burton was nonetheless also regarded as an often brilliant British actor of the post-WWII period.\n\nBurton was born Richard Walter Jenkins in 1925 into a Welsh (Cymraeg)-speaking family in Pontrhydyfen to Edith Maude (Thomas) and Richard Walter Jenkins, a coal miner. The twelfth of thirteen children, his mother died while he was a toddler and his father later abandoned the family, leaving him to be raised by an elder sister, Cecilia. An avid fan of Shakespeare, poetry and reading, he once said \"home is where the books are\". He received a scholarship to Oxford University to study acting and made his first stage appearance in 1944.\n\nHis first film appearances were in routine British movies such as The Last Days of Dolwyn (1949), Waterfront (1950) and Green Grow the Rushes (1951). Then he started to appear in Hollywood movies such as Meine Cousine Rachel (1952), Das Gewand (1953) and Alexander der Große (1956), added to this he was also spending considerable time in stage productions, both in the UK and USA, often to splendid reviews. The late 1950s was an exciting and inventive time in UK cinema, often referred to as the \"British New Wave\", and Burton was right in the thick of things, and showcased a sensational performance in Blick zurück im Zorn (1959). He also appeared with a cavalcade of international stars in the World War II magnum opus Der längste Tag (1962), and then onto arguably his most \"notorious\" role as that of Marc Antony opposite Elizabeth Taylor in the hugely expensive Cleopatra (1963). This was, of course, the film that kick-started their fiery and passionate romance (plus two marriages), and the two of them appeared in several productions over the next few years including Hotel International (1963), ...die alles begehren (1965), the dynamic Wer hat Angst vor Virginia Woolf? (1966) and Der Widerspenstigen Zähmung (1967), as well as box office flops like Die Stunde der Komödianten (1967). Burton did better when he was off on his own giving higher caliber performances, such as those in Becket (1964), the film adaptation of the Tennessee Williams play Die Nacht des Leguan (1964), the brilliant espionage thriller Der Spion, der aus der Kälte kam (1965) and alongside Clint Eastwood in the World War II action adventure film Agenten sterben einsam (1968).\n\nHis audience appeal began to decline somewhat by the end of the 1960s as fans turned to younger, more virile male stars, however Burton was superb in Königin für tausend Tage (1969) as King Henry VIII, he put on a reasonable show in the boring Im Morgengrauen brach die Hölle los (1971), was over the top in the awful Die alles zur Sau machen (1971), gave sleepwalking performances in Hammersmith ist raus (1972) and Blaubart (1972), and was wildly miscast in the ludicrous Das Mädchen und der Mörder - Die Ermordung Trotzkis (1972).\n\nBy the early 1970s, quality male lead roles were definitely going to other stars, and Burton found himself appearing in some movies of dubious quality, just to pay the bills and support family, including Seine Scheidung, ihre Scheidung (1973) (his last on-screen appearance with Taylor), Verflucht sind sie alle (1974), Flüchtige Begegnung (1974), Jackpot (1974) (which was never completed) and Exorzist II - Der Ketzer (1977). However, he won another Oscar nomination for his excellent performance as a concerned psychiatrist in Fliehende Pferde (1977). He appeared with fellow acting icons Richard Harris and Roger Moore in Die Wildgänse kommen (1978) about mercenaries in South Africa. While the film had a modest initial run, over the past thirty-five years it has picked up quite a cult following. His final performances were as the wily inquisitor \"O'Brien\" in the most recent film version of George Orwell's dystopian 1984 (1984), in which he won good reviews, and in the TV mini series Die Straßen von Ellis Island (1984). He passed away on August 5, 1984 in Celigny, Switzerland from a cerebral hemorrhage.\n\nJames Maitland Stewart was born on May 20, 1908, in Indiana, Pennsylvania, to Elizabeth Ruth (Johnson) and Alexander Maitland Stewart, who owned a hardware store. He was of Scottish, Ulster-Scots, and some English descent. Stewart was educated at a local prep school, Mercersburg Academy, where he was a keen athlete (football and track), musician (singing and accordion playing), and sometime actor.\n\nIn 1929, he won a place at Princeton University, where he studied architecture with some success and became further involved with the performing arts as a musician and actor with the University Players. After graduation, engagements with the University Players took him around the northeastern United States, including a run on Broadway in 1932. But work dried up as the Great Depression deepened, and it was not until 1934, when he followed his friend Henry Fonda to Hollywood, that things began to pick up.\n\nAfter his first screen appearance in Art Trouble (1934), Stewart worked for a time for MGM as a contract player and slowly began making a name for himself in increasingly high-profile roles throughout the rest of the 1930s. His famous collaborations with Frank Capra, in Lebenskünstler (1938), Mr. Smith geht nach Washington (1939), and, after World War II, Ist das Leben nicht schön? (1946) helped to launch his career as a star and to establish his screen persona as the likable everyman.\n\nHaving learned to fly in 1935, he was drafted into the United States Army in 1940 as a private (after twice failing the medical for being underweight). During the course of World War II, he rose to the rank of colonel, first as an instructor at home in the United States, and later on combat missions in Europe. He remained involved with the United States Air Force Reserve after the war and officially retired in 1968. In 1959, he was promoted to brigadier general, becoming the highest-ranking actor in U.S. military history.\n\nStewart's acting career took off properly after the war. During the course of his long professional life, he had roles in some of Hollywood's best-remembered films, starring in a string of Westerns, bringing his everyman qualities to movies like Der Mann der Liberty Valance erschoss (1962)), biopics (The Stratton Story (1949), Die Glenn Miller Story (1954), and Lindbergh - Mein Flug über den Ozean (1957), for instance, thrillers (most notably his frequent collaborations with Alfred Hitchcock), and even some screwball comedies.\n\nOn June 25, 1997, a thrombosis formed in his right leg, leading to a pulmonary embolism, and a week later on July 2, 1997, surrounded by his children, James Stewart died at age 89 at his home in Beverly Hills, California. His last words to his family were, \"I'm going to be with Gloria now\".\n\nEldred Gregory Peck was born on April 5, 1916 in La Jolla, California, to Bernice Mae (Ayres) and Gregory Pearl Peck, a chemist and druggist in San Diego. He had Irish (from his paternal grandmother), English, and some German, ancestry. His parents divorced when he was five years old. An only child, he was sent to live with his grandmother. He never felt he had a stable childhood. His fondest memories are of his grandmother taking him to the movies every week and of his dog, which followed him everywhere. He studied pre-med at UC-Berkeley and, while there, got bitten by the acting bug and decided to change the focus of his studies. He enrolled in the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York and debuted on Broadway after graduation. His debut was in Emlyn Williams' play \"The Morning Star\" (1942). By 1943, he was in Hollywood, where he debuted in the RKO film Days of Glory (1944).\n\nStardom came with his next film, Schlüssel zum Himmelreich (1944), for which he was nominated for an Academy Award. Peck's screen presence displayed the qualities for which he became well known. He was tall, rugged and heroic, with a basic decency that transcended his roles. He appeared in Alfred Hitchcock's Ich kämpfe um dich (1945) as an amnesia victim accused of murder. In Die Wildnis ruft (1946), he was again nominated for an Academy Award and won the Golden Globe. He was especially effective in westerns and appeared in such varied fare as David O. Selznick's critically blasted Duell in der Sonne (1946), the somewhat better received Herrin der toten Stadt (1948) and the acclaimed Der Scharfschütze (1950). He was nominated again for the Academy Award for his roles in Tabu der Gerechten (1947), which dealt with anti-Semitism, and Der Kommandeur (1949), a story of high-level stress in an Air Force bomber unit in World War II.\n\nWith a string of hits to his credit, Peck made the decision to only work in films that interested him. He continued to appear as the heroic, larger-than-life figures in such films as Des Königs Admiral (1951) and Moby Dick (1956). He worked with Audrey Hepburn in her debut film, Ein Herz und eine Krone (1953). Peck finally won the Oscar, after four nominations, for his performance as lawyer Atticus Finch in Wer die Nachtigall stört (1962). In the early 1960s, he appeared in two darker films than he usually made, Ein Köder für die Bestie (1962) and Captain Newman (1963), which dealt with the way people live. He also gave a powerful performance as Captain Keith Mallory in Die Kanonen von Navarone (1961), one of the biggest box-office hits of that year.\n\nIn the early 1970s, he produced two films, The Trial of the Catonsville Nine (1972) and Die Weltumsegelung (1974), when his film career stalled. He made a comeback playing, somewhat woodenly, Robert Thorn in the horror film Das Omen (1976). After that, he returned to the bigger-than-life roles he was best known for, such as MacArthur - Held des Pazifik (1977) and the monstrous Nazi Dr. Josef Mengele in the huge hit The Boys from Brazil - Geheimakte Viertes Reich (1978). In the 1980s, he moved into television with the miniseries Die Blauen und die Grauen (1982) and Im Wendekreis des Kreuzes (1983). In 1991, he appeared in the remake of his 1962 film, playing a different role, in Martin Scorsese's Kap der Angst (1991). He was also cast as the progressive-thinking owner of a wire and cable business in Das Geld anderer Leute (1991).\n\nIn 1967, Peck received the Academy's Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award. He was also been awarded the US Presidential Medal of Freedom. Always politically progressive, he was active in such causes as anti-war protests, workers' rights and civil rights. In 2003, his Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch was named the greatest film hero of the past 100 years by the American Film Institute. Gregory Peck died at age 87 on June 12, 2003 in Los Angeles, California.\n\nThis remarkable, soft-spoken American began in films as a diffident juvenile. With passing years, he matured into a star character actor who exemplified not only integrity and strength, but an ideal of the common man fighting against social injustice and oppression. He was born in Grand Island, Hall, Nebraska, the son of Herberta Elma (Jaynes) and William Brace Fonda, who was a commercial printer, and proprietor of the W. B. Fonda Printing Company in Omaha, Nebraska. His distant ancestors were Italians who had fled their country and moved to Holland, presumably because of political or religious persecution. In the mid-1600s, they crossed the Atlantic and settled in upstate New York where they founded a community with the Fonda name.\n\nGrowing up, Henry developed an early interest in journalism after having a story published in a local newspaper. At the age of twelve, he helped in his father's printing business for $2 a week. Following graduation from high school in 1923, he got a part-time job in Minneapolis with the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company which allowed him at first to pursue journalistic studies at the University of Minnesota. As it became difficult to juggle his working hours with his academic roster, he obtained another position as a physical education instructor at $30 a week, including room and board. By this time, he had grown to a height of six foot one and was a natural for basketball.\n\nIn 1925, having returned to Omaha, Henry reevaluated his options and came to the conclusion that journalism was not his forte, after all. For a while, he tried his hand at several temporary jobs, including as a mechanic and a window dresser. Then, despite opposition from his parents, Henry accepted an offer from Gregory Foley, director of the Omaha Playhouse, to play the title role in 'Merton of the Movies'. His father would not speak to him for a month. The play and its star received fairly good notices in the local press. It ran for a week, after which Henry observed \"the idea of being Merton and not myself taught me that I could hide behind a mask\". For the rest of the repertory season, Henry advanced to assistant director which enabled him to design and paint sets as well as act. A casual trip to New York, however, had already made him set his sights on Broadway.\n\nIn 1928, he headed east and briefly played in summer stock before joining the University Players, a group of talented Princeton and Harvard graduates among whose number were such future luminaries as James Stewart (who would remain his closest lifelong friend), Joshua Logan and Kent Smith. Before long, Henry played leads opposite Margaret Sullavan, soon to become the first of his five wives. Both marriage and the players broke up four years later. In 1932, Henry found himself sharing a two-room New York apartment with Jimmy Stewart and Joshua Logan. For the next two years, he alternated scenic design with acting at various repertory companies. In 1934, he got a break of sorts, when he was given the chance to present a comedy sketch with Imogene Coca in the Broadway revue New Faces. That year, he also hired Leland Hayward as his personal management agent and this was to pay off handsomely.\n\nIt was Hayward who persuaded the 29-year old to become a motion picture actor, despite initial misgivings and reluctance on Henry's part. Independent producer Walter Wanger, whose growing stock company was birthed at United Artists, needed a star for The Farmer Takes a Wife (1935). With both first choice actors Gary Cooper and Joel McCrea otherwise engaged, Henry was the next available option. After all, he had just completed a successful run on Broadway in the stage version. The cheesy publicity tag line for the picture was \"you'll be fonder of Fonda\", but the film was an undeniable hit. Wanger, realizing he had a good thing going, next cast Henry in a succession of A-grade pictures which capitalized on his image as the sincere, unaffected country boy. Pick of the bunch were the Technicolor outdoor western Kampf in den Bergen (1936), the gritty Depression-era drama Gehetzt (1937) (with Henry as a back-to-the-wall good guy forced into becoming a fugitive from the law by circumstance), the screwball comedy Flucht in die Liebe (1936) (with ex-wife Sullavan), the excellent pre-civil war-era romantic drama Jezebel - die boshafte Lady (1938) and the equally superb Der junge Mr. Lincoln (1939), in which Henry gave his best screen performance to date as the 'jackleg lawyer from Springfield'. Henry made two more films with director John Ford: the pioneering drama Trommeln am Mohawk (1939) and Früchte des Zorns (1940), with Henry as Tom Joad, often regarded his career-defining role as the archetypal grassroots American trying to stand up against oppression. It also set the tone for his subsequent career. Whether he played a lawman (Wyatt Earp in Faustrecht der Prärie (1946)), a reluctant posse member (Ritt zum Ox-Bow (1942), a juror committed to the ideal of total justice in (Die zwölf Geschworenen (1957)) or a nightclub musician wrongly accused of murder (Der falsche Mann (1956)), his characters were alike in projecting integrity and quiet authority. In this vein, he also gave a totally convincing (though historically inaccurate) portrayal in the titular role of Rache für Jesse James (1940), a rare example of a sequel improving upon the original.\n\nHenry rarely featured in comedy, except for a couple of good turns opposite Barbara Stanwyck -- with whom he shared an excellent on-screen chemistry -- in The Mad Miss Manton (1938) and Die Falschspielerin (1941). He was also good value as a poker-playing grifter in the western comedy Höchster Einsatz in Laredo (1966). Finally, just to confound those who would typecast him, he gave a chilling performance as one of the coldest, meanest stone killers ever to roam the West, in Sergio Leone's classic Spiel mir das Lied vom Tod (1968). Illness curtailed his work in the 1970s. His final screen role was as an octogenarian in Am goldenen See (1981), in which he was joined by his daughter Jane. It finally won him an Oscar on the heels of an earlier Honorary Academy Award. Too ill to attend the ceremony, he died soon after at the age of 77, having left a lasting legacy matched by few of his peers.\n\nOnce told by an interviewer, \"Everybody would like to be Cary Grant\", Grant is said to have replied, \"So would I.\"\n\nCary Grant was born Archibald Alec Leach on January 18, 1904 in Horfield, Bristol, England, to Elsie Maria (Kingdon) and Elias James Leach, who worked in a factory. His early years in Bristol would have been an ordinary lower-middle-class childhood, except for one extraordinary event. At age nine, he came home from school one day and was told his mother had gone off to a seaside resort. However, the real truth was that she had been placed in a mental institution, where she would remain for years, and he was never told about it (he would not see his mother again until he was in his late 20s).\n\nHe left school at age 14, lying about his age and forging his father's signature on a letter to join Bob Pender's troupe of knockabout comedians. He learned pantomime as well as acrobatics as he toured with the Pender troupe in the English provinces, picked up a Cockney accent in the music halls in London, and then in July 1920, was one of the eight Pender boys selected to go to the United States. Their show on Broadway, \"Good Times\", ran for 456 performances, giving Grant time to acclimatize. He would stay in America. Mae West wanted Grant for Sie tat ihm unrecht (1933) because she saw his combination of virility, sexuality and the aura and bearing of a gentleman. Grant was young enough to begin the new career of fatherhood when he stopped making movies at age 62.\n\nOne biographer said Grant was alienated by the new realism in the film industry. In the 1950s and early 1960s, he had invented a man-of-the-world persona and a style - \"high comedy with polished words\". In Über den Dächern von Nizza (1955), he and Grace Kelly were allowed to improvise some of the dialogue. They knew what the director, Alfred Hitchcock, wanted to do with a scene, they rehearsed it, put in some clever double entendres that got past the censors, and then the scene was filmed. His biggest box-office success was another Hitchcock 1950s film, Der unsichtbare Dritte (1959) made with Eva Marie Saint since Kelly was by that time Princess of Monaco.\n\nAlthough Grant retired from the screen, he remained active. He accepted a position on the board of directors at Faberge. By all accounts this position was not honorary, as some had assumed. Grant regularly attended meetings and traveled internationally to support them. The position also permitted use of a private plane, which Grant could use to fly to see his daughter wherever her mother Dyan Cannon, was working. He later joined the boards of Hollywood Park, the Academy of Magical Arts (The Magic Castle - Hollywood, California), Western Airlines (acquired by Delta Airlines in 1987) and MGM.\n\nGrant expressed no interest in making a career comeback. He was in good health until almost the end of his life, when he suffered a mild stroke in October 1984. In his last years, he undertook tours of the United States in a one-man-show, \"A Conversation with Cary Grant\", in which he would show clips from his films and answer audience questions. On November 29, 1986, Cary Grant died at age 82 of a cerebral hemorrhage in Davenport, Iowa.\n\nIn 1999, the American Film Institute named Grant the second male star of Golden Age of Hollywood cinema (after Humphrey Bogart). Grant was known for comedic and dramatic roles; his best-known films include Leoparden küßt man nicht (1938), Die Nacht vor der Hochzeit (1940), Sein Mädchen für besondere Fälle (1939), Arsen und Spitzenhäubchen (1944), Berüchtigt (1946), Die große Liebe meines Lebens (1957), Der unsichtbare Dritte (1959) and Charade (1963).\n\nWilliam Clark Gable was born on February 1, 1901 in Cadiz, Ohio, to Adeline (Hershelman) and William Henry Gable, an oil-well driller. He was of German, Irish, and Swiss-German descent. When he was seven months old, his mother died, and his father sent him to live with his maternal aunt and uncle in Pennsylvania, where he stayed until he was two. His father then returned to take him back to Cadiz. At 16, he quit high school, went to work in an Akron, Ohio, tire factory, and decided to become an actor after seeing the play \"The Bird of Paradise\". He toured in stock companies, worked oil fields and sold ties. On December 13, 1924, he married Josephine Dillon, his acting coach and 15 years his senior. Around that time, they moved to Hollywood, so that Clark could concentrate on his acting career. In April 1930, they divorced and a year later, he married Maria Langham (a.k.a. Maria Franklin Gable), also about 17 years older than him.\n\nWhile Gable acted on stage, he became a lifelong friend of Lionel Barrymore. After several failed screen tests (for Barrymore and Darryl F. Zanuck), Gable was signed in 1930 by MGM's Irving Thalberg. He had a small part in Feindschaft (1931) which starred William Boyd. Joan Crawford asked for him as co-star in Irrwege des Lebens (1931) and the public loved him manhandling Norma Shearer in Der Mut zum Glück (1931) the same year. His unshaven lovemaking with bra-less Jean Harlow in Dschungel im Sturm (1932) made him MGM's most important star.\n\nHis acting career then flourished. At one point, he refused an assignment, and the studio punished him by loaning him out to (at the time) low-rent Columbia Pictures, which put him in Frank Capra's Es geschah in einer Nacht (1934), which won him an Academy Award for his performance. The next year saw a starring role in Goldfieber (1935) with Loretta Young, with whom he had an affair (resulting in the birth of a daughter, Judy Lewis). He returned to far more substantial roles at MGM, such as Fletcher Christian in Meuterei auf der Bounty (1935) and Rhett Butler in Vom Winde verweht (1939).\n\nAfter divorcing Maria Langham, in March 1939 Clark married Carole Lombard, but tragedy struck in January 1942 when the plane in which Carole and her mother were flying crashed into Table Rock Mountain, Nevada, killing them both. A grief-stricken Gable joined the US Army Air Force and was off the screen for three years, flying combat missions in Europe. When he returned the studio regarded his salary as excessive and did not renew his contract. He freelanced, but his films didn't do well at the box office. He married Sylvia Ashley, the widow of Douglas Fairbanks, in 1949. Unfortunately this marriage was short-lived and they divorced in 1952. In July 1955 he married a former sweetheart, Kathleen Williams Spreckles (a.k.a. Kay Williams) and became stepfather to her two children, Joan and Adolph (\"Bunker\") Spreckels III.\n\nOn November 16, 1959, Gable became a grandfather when Judy Lewis, his daughter with Loretta Young, gave birth to a daughter, Maria. In 1960, Gable's wife Kay discovered that she was expecting their first child. In early November 1960, he had just completed filming Misfits - Nicht gesellschaftsfähig (1961), when he suffered a heart attack, and died later that month, on November 16, 1960. Gable was buried shortly afterwards in the shrine that he had built for Carole Lombard and her mother when they died, at Forest Lawn Cemetery.\n\nIn March 1961, Kay Gable gave birth to a boy, whom she named John Clark Gable after his father.\n\nScreen legend, superstar, and the man with the most famous blue eyes in movie history, Paul Leonard Newman was born on January 26, 1925, in Cleveland, Ohio, the second son of Arthur Sigmund Newman (died 1950) and Theresa Fetsko (died 1982). His elder brother was Arthur S. Newman Jr., named for their father, a Jewish businessman who owned a successful sporting goods store and was the son of emigrants from Poland and Hungary. Newman's mother (born Terézia Fecková, daughter of Stefan Fecko and Mária Polenak) was a Roman Catholic Slovak from Homonna, Pticie (former Austro-Hungarian Empire), who became a practicing Christian Scientist. She and her brother, Newman's uncle Joe, had an interest in the creative arts, and it rubbed off on him. He acted in grade school and high school plays. The Newmans were well-to-do and Paul Newman grew up in affluent Shaker Heights. Before he became an actor, Newman ran the family sporting goods store in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nBy 1950, the 25-year-old Newman had been kicked out of Ohio University, where he belonged to the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity, for unruly behavior (denting the college president's car with a beer keg), served three years in the United States Navy during World War II as a radio operator, graduated from Ohio's Kenyon College, married his first wife, Jacqueline \"Jackie\" Witte (born 1929), and had his first child, Scott. That same year, his father died. When he became successful in later years, Newman said if he had any regrets it would be that his father was not around to witness his success. He brought Jackie back to Shaker Heights and he ran his father's store for a short period. Then, knowing that wasn't the career path he wanted to take, he moved Jackie and Scott to New Haven, Connecticut, where he attended Yale University's School of Drama.\n\nWhile doing a play there, Newman was spotted by two agents, who invited him to come to New York City to pursue a career as a professional actor. After moving to New York, he acted in guest spots for various television series and in 1953 came a big break. He got the part of understudy of the lead role in the successful Broadway play \"Picnic\". Through this play, he met actress Joanne Woodward (born 1930), who was also an understudy in the play. While they got on very well and there was a strong attraction, Newman was married and his second child, Susan, was born that year. During this time, Newman was accepted into the much admired and popular New York Actors Studio, although he did not actually audition.\n\nIn 1954, a film Newman was very reluctant to do was released, Basilus - Held von Rom (1954). He considered his performance in this costume epic to be so bad that he took out a full-page ad in a trade paper apologizing for it to anyone who might have seen it. He had always been embarrassed about the film and reveled in making fun of it. He immediately wanted to return to the stage, and performed in \"The Desperate Hours\". In 1956, he got the chance to redeem himself in the film world by portraying boxer Rocky Graziano in Die Hölle ist in mir (1956), and critics praised his performance. In 1957, with a handful of films to his credit, he was cast in Der lange heiße Sommer (1958), co-starring Joanne Woodward.\n\nDuring the shooting of this film, they realized they were meant to be together and by now, so did his then-wife Jackie, who gave Newman a divorce. He and Woodward wed in Las Vegas in January 1958. They went on to have three daughters together and raised them in Westport, Connecticut. In 1959, Newman received his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, in Die Katze auf dem heißen Blechdach (1958). The 1960s would bring Newman into superstar status, as he became one of the most popular actors of the decade, and garnered three more Best Actor Oscar nominations, for Haie der Großstadt (1961), Der Wildeste unter tausend (1963) and Der Unbeugsame (1967). In 1968, his debut directorial effort Die Liebe eines Sommers (1968) was given good marks, and although the film and Woodward were nominated for Oscars, Newman was not nominated for Best Director. However, he did win a Golden Globe Award for his direction.\n\n1969 brought the popular screen duo of Newman and Robert Redford together for the first time when Butch Cassidy und Sundance Kid (1969) was released. It was a box office smash. Through the 1970s, Newman had hits and misses from such popular films as Der Clou (1973) and Flammendes Inferno (1974) to lesser known films as Das war Roy Bean (1972) to a cult classic Schlappschuß (1977). After the death of his only son, Scott, in 1978, Newman's personal life and film choices moved in a different direction. His acting work in the 1980s and on is what is often most praised by critics today. He became more at ease with himself and it was evident in The Verdict - Die Wahrheit und nichts als die Wahrheit (1982) for which he received his sixth Best Actor Oscar nomination and, in 1987, finally received his first Oscar for Die Farbe des Geldes (1986), almost thirty years after Woodward had won hers. Friend and director of Die Hölle ist in mir (1956), Robert Wise accepted the award on Newman's behalf as the actor did not attend the ceremony.\n\nFilms were not the only thing on his mind during this period. A passionate race car driver since the early 1970s (despite being color-blind), he was co-founder of Newman-Haas racing in 1982, and also founded \"Newman's Own\", a successful line of food products that has earned in excess of $100 million, every penny of which Newman donated to charity. He also started The Hole in the Wall Gang Camps, an organization for children with serious illness. He was as well known for his philanthropic ways and highly successful business ventures as he was for his legendary actor status.\n\nNewman's marriage to Woodward lasted a half-century. Connecticut was their primary residence after leaving Hollywood and moving East in 1960. Renowned for his sense of humor, in 1998 he quipped that he was a little embarrassed to see his salad dressing grossing more than his movies. During his later years, he still attended races, was much involved in his charitable organizations, and in 2006, he opened a restaurant called Dressing Room, which helps out the Westport Country Playhouse, a place in which Newman took great pride. In 2007, while the public was largely unaware of the serious illness from which he was suffering, Newman made some headlines when he said he was losing his invention and confidence in his acting abilities and that acting was \"pretty much a closed book for me\". A smoker for many years, Newman died on September 26, 2008, aged 83, from lung cancer.\n\nAlthough Red Buttons is best known as a stand-up comic, he is also a successful songwriter, an Academy Award-winning actor (and has been nominated for two Golden Globe awards) and an accomplished singer. Born Aaron Chwatt in New York City's Lower East Side, Buttons (who got his name from a uniform he wore while working as a singing bellhop) started his show-business career singing on street corners as a child. At 16 he got a job as part of a comedy act playing the famed Catskills resort area in upstate New York (his partner was future actor Robert Alda). Buttons worked the burlesque circuit as a comic and even landed a role in a Broadway play, \"Vicki\", in 1942. He soon joined the U.S. Marine Corps, and in 1943 was picked for a role in Moss Hart's service play \"Winged Victory\" on Broadway, and soon afterwards journeyed to Hollywood to make the film version. After his discharge from the service he returned to Broadway, both in plays and as a comic with several big-band orchestras. He was successful enough that he got his own TV series, The Red Buttons Show (1952), on CBS. It lasted three years and won Buttons an Emmy for Best Comedian. He worked steadily for the next several years, and in 1957 got his big film break in the drama Sayonara (1957) with Marlon Brando, in which he played an American soldier stationed in Japan who struggled against the societal and racist pressures of both American and Japanese cultures because of his love for a Japanese woman. His performance garnered him an Academy Award, and more film roles followed. He played a paratrooper in Der längste Tag (1962), was nominated for a Golden Globe for Die Welt der Jean Harlow (1965) and again for Nur Pferden gibt man einen Gnadenschuß (1969). He had a part in the TV series The Double Life of Henry Phyfe (1966) and has done pretty much every kind of TV show there is, from variety to comedy to soap operas. He gained further renown in the 1970s for his appearances on the \"Dean Martin Celebrity Roast\" where he performed his \"Never Got a Dinner\" act to great acclaim. He has played Las Vegas for years, has a star on Hollywood Boulevard (corner of Hollywood and Vine) and has appeared in numerous telethons and charitable events, for which he has been honored by such organizations as the Friars Club and the City of Hope Hospital.\n\nMickey Rooney was born Joe Yule Jr. on September 23, 1920 in Brooklyn, New York. He first took the stage as a toddler in his parents vaudeville act at 17 months old. He made his first film appearance in 1926. The following year, he played the lead character in the first Mickey McGuire short film. It was in this popular film series that he took the stage name Mickey Rooney. Rooney reached new heights in 1937 with A Family Affair, the film that introduced the country to Andy Hardy, the popular all-American teenager. This beloved character appeared in nearly 20 films and helped make Rooney the top star at the box office in 1939, 1940 and 1941. Rooney also proved himself an excellent dramatic actor as a delinquent in Teufelskerle (1938) starring Spencer Tracy. In 1938, he was awarded a Juvenile Academy Award.\n\nTeaming up with Judy Garland, Rooney also appeared in a string of musicals, including Musik ist unsere Welt (1939) the first teenager to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor in a leading role, Heiße Rhythmen in Chicago (1940), Babes on Broadway (1941), and Girl Crazy (1943). He and Garland immediately became best of friends. \"We weren't just a team, we were magic,\" Rooney once said. During that time he also appeared with Elizabeth Taylor in the now classic Kleines Mädchen, großes Herz (1944). Rooney joined the service that same year, where he helped to entertain the troops and worked on the American Armed Forces Network. He returned to Hollywood after 21 months in Love Laughs at Andy Hardy (1946), did a remake of a Robert Taylor film, Der Schrei der Masse (1932) called Killer McCoy (1947) and portrayed composer Lorenz Hart in Words and Music (1948). He also appeared in Frühstück bei Tiffany (1961), starring Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard. Rooney played Hepburn's Japanese neighbor, Mr. Yunioshi. A sign of the times, Rooney played the part for comic relief which he later regretted feeling the role was offensive. He once again showed his incredible range in the dramatic role of a boxing trainer with Anthony Quinn and Jackie Gleason in Die Faust im Gesicht (1962). In the late 1960s and 1970s Rooney showed audiences and critics alike why he was one of Hollywood's most enduring stars. He gave an impressive performance in Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 film Der schwarze Hengst (1979), which brought him an Academy Award nomination as Best Actor in a Supporting Role. He also turned to the stage in 1979 in Sugar Babies with Ann Miller, and was nominated for a Tony Award. During that time he also portrayed the Wizard in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz with Eartha Kitt at New York's Madison Square Garden, which also had a successful run nationally.\n\nRooney appeared in four television series': The Mickey Rooney Show (1954) (1954-1955), a comedy sit-com in 1964 with Sammee Tong called Mickey, One of the Boys in 1982 with Dana Carvey and Nathan Lane, and Black, der schwarze Blitz (1990) from 1990-1993. In 1981, Rooney won an Emmy Award for his portrayal of a mentally challenged man in Bill (1981). The critical acclaim continued to flow for the veteran performer, with Rooney receiving an honorary Academy Award \"in recognition of his 60 years of versatility in a variety of memorable film performances\". More recently he has appeared in such films as Nachts im Museum (2006) with Ben Stiller and Die Muppets (2011) with Amy Adams and Jason Segel.\n\nRooney's personal life, including his frequent trips to the altar, has proved to be just as epic as his on-screen performances. His first wife was one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood, actress Ava Gardner. Mickey permanently separated from his eighth wife Jan in June of 2012. In 2011 Rooney filed elder abuse and fraud charges against stepson Christopher Aber and Aber's wife. At Rooney's request, the Superior Court issued a restraining order against the Aber's demanding they stay 100 yards from Rooney, as well as Mickey's other son Mark Rooney and Mark's wife Charlene. Just prior, Rooney mustered the strength to break his silence and appeared before the Senate in Washington D.C. telling of his own heartbreaking story of abuse in an effort to live a peaceful, full life and help others who may be similarly suffering in silence.\n\nRooney requested through the Superior Court to permanently reside with his son Mark Rooney, who is a musician and Marks wife Charlene, an artist, in the Hollywood Hills. He legally separated from his eighth wife in June of 2012. Ironically, after eight failed marriages he never looked or felt better and finally found happiness and peace in the single life. Mickey, Mark and Charlene focused on health, happiness and creative endeavors and it showed. Mickey Rooney had once again landed on his feet reminding us that he was a survivor. Rooney died on April 6th 2014. He was taking his afternoon nap and never woke. One week before his death Mark and Charlene surprised him by reunited him with a long lost love, the racetrack. He was ecstatic to be back after decades and ran into his old friends Mel Brooks and Dick Van Patten.\n\nErnest Borgnine was born Ermes Effron Borgnino on January 24, 1917 in Hamden, Connecticut. His parents were Anna (Boselli), who had emigrated from Carpi (MO), Italy, and Camillo Borgnino, who had emigrated from Ottiglio (AL), Italy. As an only child, Ernest enjoyed most sports, especially boxing, but took no real interest in acting. At age 18, after graduating from high school in New Haven, and undecided about his future career, he joined the United States Navy, where he stayed for ten years until leaving in 1945. After a few factory jobs, his mother suggested that his forceful personality could make him suitable for a career in acting, and Borgnine promptly enrolled at the Randall School of Drama in Hartford. After completing the course, he joined Robert Porterfield's famous Barter Theatre in Abingdon, Virginia, staying there for four years, undertaking odd jobs and playing every type of role imaginable. His big break came in 1949, when he made his acting debut on Broadway playing a male nurse in \"Harvey\".\n\nIn 1951, Borgnine moved to Los Angeles to pursue a movie career, and made his film debut as Bill Street in The Whistle at Eaton Falls (1951). His career took off in 1953 when he was cast in the role of Sergeant \"Fatso\" Judson in Verdammt in alle Ewigkeit (1953). This memorable performance led to numerous supporting roles as \"heavies\" in a steady string of dramas and westerns. He played against type in 1955 by securing the lead role of Marty Piletti, a shy and sensitive butcher, in Marty (1955). He won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, despite strong competition from Spencer Tracy, Frank Sinatra, James Dean and James Cagney. Throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, Borgnine performed memorably in such films as Mädchen ohne Mitgift (1956), Eisstation Zebra (1968) and Ein Zug für zwei Halunken (1973). Between 1962 and 1966, he played Lt. Commander Quinton McHale in the popular television series McHale's Navy (1962). In early 1984, he returned to television as Dominic Santini in the action series Airwolf (1984) co-starring Jan-Michael Vincent, and in 1995, he was cast in the comedy series Ein Single kommt immer allein (1995) as doorman Manny Cordoba. He also appeared in several made-for-TV movies.\n\nErnest Borgnine has often stated that acting was his greatest passion. His amazing 61-year career (1951 - 2012) included appearances in well over 100 feature films and as a regular in three television series, as well as voice-overs in animated films such as Charlie - Ein himmlischer Held (1996), Small Soldiers (1998), and a continued role in the series SpongeBob Schwammkopf (1999). Between 1973 until his death, Ernest was married to Tova Traesnaes, who heads her own cosmetics company. They lived in Beverly Hills, California, where Ernest assisted his wife between film projects. When not acting, Ernest actively supported numerous charities and spoke tirelessly at benefits throughout the country. He has been awarded several honorary doctorates from colleges across the United States as well as numerous Lifetime Achievement Awards. In 1996, Ernest purchased a bus and traveled across the United States to see the country and meet his many fans. On December 17, 1999, he presented the University of North Alabama with a collection of scripts from his film and television career, due to his long friendship with North Alabama alumnus and actor George Lindsey (died May 6, 2012), who was an artist in residence at North Alabama.\n\nErnest Borgnine passed away aged 95 on July 8, 2012, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, of renal failure. He is survived by his wife Tova, their children and his younger sister Evelyn (1926-2013)\n\nSir John Mills, one of the most popular and beloved English actors, was born Lewis Ernest Watts Mills on February 22, 1908, at the Watts Naval Training College in North Elmham, Norfolk, England. The young Mills grew up in Felixstowe, Suffolk, where his father was a mathematics teacher and his mother was a theater box-office manager. The Oscar-winner appeared in more than 120 films and TV movies in a career stretching over eight decades, from his debut in 1932 in The Midshipmaid (1932) through Bright Young Things (2003) and The Snow Prince (2009).\n\nAfter graduating from the Norwich Grammar School for Boys, Mills rejected his father's academic career for the performing arts. After brief employment as a clerk in a grain merchant's office, he moved to London and enrolled at Zelia Raye's Dancing School. Convinced from the age of six that performing was his destiny, Mills said, \"I never considered anything else.\"\n\nAfter training as a dancer, he started his professional career in the music hall, appearing as a chorus boy at the princely sum of four pounds sterling a week in \"The Five O'Clock Revue\" at the London Hippodrome, in 1929. The short, wiry song-and-dance man was scouted by Noël Coward and began to appear regularly on the London stage in revues, musicals and legitimate plays throughout the 1930s. He appeared in a score of films before the war, \"quota quickies\" made under a system regulating the import of American films designed to boost local production. He was a juvenile lead in The Ghost Camera (1933), appeared in the musical Car of Dreams (1935), and then played lead roles in Brown on Resolution (1935), Tudor Rose (1936) and The Green Cockatoo (1937). His Hollywood debut was in Auf Wiedersehen, Mr. Chips (1939) with Robert Donat, but he refused the American studios' entreaties to sign a contract and stayed in England.\n\nMills relished acting in films, finding it a challenge rather than the necessary economic evil that many English actors at the time, such as Laurence Olivier, felt it was, and it was the cinema that would make him an internationally renowned star. He anchored his film career in military roles, such as those in his early pictures Brown on Resolution (1935) (a.k.a. \"Forever England\") and Raoul Walsh's O.H.M.S. (1937). He appeared in the classic In Which We Serve (1942), where he worked with his mentor Coward and with Coward's co-director David Lean, who would go on to direct Mills in some of his most memorable performances.\n\nThroughout his film career Mills played a wide variety of military characters, portraying the quintessential English hero. He later tackled more complex characterizations, such as the emotionally troubled commander in Einst ein Held (1960). He also played Field Marshal Haig in the satire Oh! What a Lovely War (1969) that mocked the entire genre. However, it was in his World War II films, which included We Dive at Dawn (1943), Waterloo Road (1945) and The Way to the Stars (1945), that Mills established himself as an innovative English film star.\n\nWith his ordinary appearance and everyman manner, Mills seemed \"the boy-next-door,\" but the Mills hero was decent, loyal and brave, as well as tough and reliable under stress. In his military roles, he managed throughout his career to include enough subtle variations on the Mills heroic type to avoid appearing typed. He could play such straight heroes as Scotts letzte Fahrt (1948) as well as deconstruct the type in Eiskalt in Alexandrien (1958) and \"Tunes of Glory.\" The latter film features one of his finest film roles, that of the brittle Col. Basil Barrow, the new commander of a Scots battalion. Mills superbly played an emotionally troubled martinet in a role originally slated for Alec Guinness, his Die großen Erwartungen (1946) co-star, who decided to take the flashier role of the colonel's tormentor. It was one of Mills' favorite characters.\n\nNo male star of English cinema enjoyed such a long and rewarding career as a star while appearing predominantly in English films. As an actor, Mills chose his roles on the basis of the quality of the script rather than its propriety as a \"star\" turn. Because of this, he played roles that were more akin to character parts, such as shoemaker Willy Mossop in Herr im Haus bin ich (1954). As he aged, his proclivity for well-written roles enabled him to make a seamless transition from a lead to character lead to character actor from the 1950s to the 1960s.\n\nAlmost 40 years after his film debut, Mills won the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for playing the mute village idiot in Lean's Ryans Tochter (1970), an uncharacteristic part. In addition to \"In Which We Serve\" and \"Ryan's Daughter,\" Lean had also directed Mills in memorable performances in Wunderbare Zeiten (1944) and \"Hobson's Choice\". He gave one of his finest turns as Pip in Lean's masterpiece \"Great Expectations\", in which Mills' performance was central to the success of the picture.\n\nOther significant films in which Mills appeared include The Rocking Horse Winner (1949), King Vidor's Krieg und Frieden (1956), Das Haus im Kreidegarten (1964), Sie nannten ihn King (1965), Letzte Grüße von Onkel Joe (1966), Die große Liebe der Lady Caroline (1972), Der junge Löwe (1972) and Stanley Kramer's Oklahoma, wie es ist (1973). He also appeared with his daughter Hayley Mills in Tiger Bay - ich kenne den Mörder (1959) and Honigmond '67 (1966) and had a cameo in her Disney hit Die Vermählung ihrer Eltern geben bekannt (1961). Mills appeared in a Disney hit of his own, Dschungel der 1000 Gefahren (1960), as the paterfamilias. He had one of the better cameo parts in producer Mike Todd's epic In 80 Tagen um die Welt (1956), playing a carriage driver, and appeared in a non-speaking part as Old Norway in Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet (1996).\n\nIn 1967 he appeared in the short-lived American TV series Dundee und Culhane (1967) on CBS. In the hour-long series Mills played an English lawyer named Dundee who roamed the Wild West with a young American lawyer named Culhane, who was also a fast draw with a six-gun. The network was disappointed with the quality of the show's writing and cancelled it after 13 episodes. One of the series' directors was Ida Lupino, who played Mills' sister in \"The Ghost Camera\" over 30 years before (Lupino also directed Hayley in Immer Ärger mit den Engeln (1966)). Mills' most famous television role was probably the title character in ITV's Quatermass (1979).\n\nHe appeared on Broadway during the 1961-62 season as the lead character in Terence Rattigan's \"Ross,\" a fictionalization of the life of T.E. Lawrence, for which he was nominated for a Best Actor Tony Award. His only other Broadway appearance was in the 1987 revival of George Bernard Shaw's \"Pygmalion,\" in which he played Alfred Doolittle. The play was nominated for a Tony for Best Revival, and Amanda Plummer, playing his character's daughter, Eliza, also received a Tony nomination.\n\nAfter divorcing Aileen Raymond, whom he had married at the age of 19, Mills married playwright Mary Hayley Bell on January 16, 1941. Since he was serving in the army, they could not have a church service, and they renewed their vows at St. Mary's Church, next to their home, Hills House, in Denham, England, in 2001.\n\nMills has worked as both producer and director: in 1966, he directed daughter Hayley in Sky West and Crooked (1966) (a.k.a. \"Gypsy Girl), from a script written by his wife. He produced \"The Rocking Horse Winner\" and The History of Mr. Polly (1949), the latter film featuring his older daughter Juliet Mills as a child. ...woher der Wind weht (1961) in which Hayley's character mistakes a runaway convict played by Alan Bates for Jesus Christ, was based on a novel written by Mary.\n\nLiving in Hollywood during the 1960s where his daughter Hayley enjoyed her own Oscar-winning career as a child star, Mills and his wife became very popular with members of the movie colony. After Hayley grew out of her child actress roles, Mills returned to England, where he continued his film work. He became a council member of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and a life patron of the Variety Club.\n\nMills was appointed a Commander of the British Empire in 1960 and was knighted in 1976. Although he suffered from deafness and failing eyesight and went almost completely blind in 1990, he continued to act, playing both blind and sighted characters with his customary joie de vivre and panache. The British Academy of Film and Television Arts honored him with a Special Tribute Award in 1987 and a Fellowship, its highest award, in 2002. He was honored with a British Film Institute Fellowship in 1995 and was named a Disney Legend by The Walt Disney Co.\n\nAfter a brief illness, Sir John Mills died at the age of 97 on April 23, 2005, in Denham, Buckinghamshire, England. He was survived by his widow (who survived him by eight months), his son Jonathan, his daughters Juliet and Hayley, and his grandson Crispian Mills, the lead singer of the hit pop music group Kula Shaker. He was the author of an autobiography, \"Up in the Clouds, Gentleman Please,\" published in 1981.\n\nSir Christopher Frank Carandini Lee was perhaps the only actor of his generation to have starred in so many films and cult saga. Although most notable for personifying bloodsucking vampire, Dracula, on screen, he portrayed other varied characters on screen, most of which were villains, whether it be Francisco Scaramanga in the James Bond film, Der Mann mit dem goldenen Colt (1974), or Count Dooku in Star Wars: Episode II - Angriff der Klonkrieger (2002), or as the title monster in the Hammer Horror film, Die Rache der Pharaonen (1959).\n\nLee was born in 1922 in London, England, where he and his older sister Xandra were raised by their parents, Contessa Estelle Marie (Carandini di Sarzano) and Geoffrey Trollope Lee, a professional soldier, until their divorce in 1926. Later, while Lee was still a child, his mother married (and later divorced) Harcourt George St.-Croix (nicknamed Ingle), who was a banker. Lee's maternal great-grandfather was an Italian political refugee, while Lee's great-grandmother was English opera singer Marie (Burgess) Carandini.\n\nAfter attending Wellington College from age 14 to 17, Lee worked as an office clerk in a couple of London shipping companies until 1941 when he enlisted in the Royal Air Force during World War II. Following his release from military service, Lee joined the Rank Organisation in 1947, training as an actor in their \"Charm School\" and playing a number of bit parts in such films as Im Banne der Vergangenheit (1948). He made a brief appearance in Laurence Olivier's Hamlet (1948), in which his future partner-in-horror Peter Cushing also appeared. Both actors also appeared later in Moulin Rouge (1952) but did not meet until their horror films together.\n\nLee had numerous parts in film and television throughout the 1950s. He struggled initially in his new career because he was discriminated as being taller than the leading male actors of his time and being too foreign-looking. However, playing the monster in the Hammer film Frankensteins Fluch (1957) proved to be a blessing in disguise, since the was successful, leading to him being signed on for future roles in Hammer Film Productions.\n\nLee's association with Hammer Film Productions brought him into contact with Peter Cushing, and they became good friends. Lee and Cushing often than not played contrasting roles in Hammer films, where Cushing was the protagonist and Lee the villain, whether it be Van Helsing and Dracula respectively in Dracula (1958), or John Banning and Kharis the Mummy respectively in Die Rache der Pharaonen (1959).\n\nLee continued his role as \"Dracula\" in a number of Hammer sequels throughout the 1960s and into the early 1970s. During this time, he co-starred in Der Hund von Baskerville (1959), and made numerous appearances as Fu Manchu, most notably in the first of the series Ich, Dr. Fu Man Chu (1965), and also appeared in a number of films in Europe. With his own production company, Charlemagne Productions, Ltd., Lee made Das Dunkel der Nacht (1973) and Die Braut des Satans (1976).\n\nBy the mid-1970s, Lee was tiring of his horror image and tried to widen his appeal by participating in several mainstream films, such as Das Privatleben des Sherlock Holmes (1970), Die drei Musketiere (1973), Die vier Musketiere (1974), and the James Bond film Der Mann mit dem goldenen Colt (1974).\n\nThe success of these films prompted him in the late 1970s to move to Hollywood, where he remained a busy actor but made mostly unremarkable film and television appearances, and eventually moved back to England. The beginning of the new millennium relaunched his career to some degree, during which he has played Count Dooku in Star Wars: Episode II - Angriff der Klonkrieger (2002) and as Saruman the White in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Lee played Count Dooku again in Star Wars: Episode III - Die Rache der Sith (2005), and portrayed the father of Willy Wonka, played by Johnny Depp, in the Tim Burton film, Charlie und die Schokoladenfabrik (2005).\n\nOn 16 June 2001, he was created a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in recognition of his services to drama. He was created a Knight Bachelor on 13 June 2009 in the Queen's Birthday Honours List for his services to drama and charity. In addition he was made a Commander of the Order of St John on 16 January 1997.\n\nLee died at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital on 7 June 2015 at 8:30 am after being admitted for respiratory problems and heart failure, shortly after celebrating his 93rd birthday there. His wife delayed the public announcement until 11 June, in order to break the news to their family."
