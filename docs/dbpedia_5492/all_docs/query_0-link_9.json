Actors who shared the stage with Laurence Olivier pro- vided unique perspectives on production histories. They wel- comed me to their homes, to their offices, or backstage at theaters and shared their experiences frankly and in lively detail. For interviews, for opening personal albums and shar- mg private correspondence I am grateful to the late Dame Peggy Ashcroft, Maxine Audley, Claire Bloom, Michael Caine, Alexander Clark, Constance Cummings, Peter Cushing, Denholm Elliott, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Gwen Ffrang^on-Davies, Edward Fox, Sir John Gielgud, Sir Alec Guinness, Margaret Hall, Julie Harris, Rosemary Harris, Katharine Hepburn, Charlton Heston, Georgina Jumel, Harold Kasket, Rachel Kenipson (Lady Redgrave), Alexander Knox, Basil Langton, Alec McCowen, Sarah Miles, Sir John and Lady Mills, Helen Mirren, Terence Morgan, the late Lotta Palfi-Andor, Ronald Pickup, Antliony Quinn, Michael Redington, Mercia Swinburne Relph, Jean Simmons, Maureen Stapleton, Susan Strasberg, Frances Tannehill, Ann Todd, Dorodiy Tutin, Robert Wagner and Jeanne Watts.

The place of Shakespeare’s art in the life of Laurence Oli\\der cannot be overstated, of course, and I am grateful to Professor Gerald M. Pinciss of the City University of New York, a leading scholar and an autlior of important books and monographs on Shakespeare. Dr. Pinciss discussed the plays at length, indicated major points for consideration in both Olmer’s perfonnances and directing, read large poitions of the first draft of my t)'pescript and made incisive suggestions. XIV ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The noted surgeon and oncologist Barry Mann, M.D., answered important medical questions and supplied data rel- evant to Olivier’s major illness. From the first weeks of research, I was constantly given major assistance and endorsement by Laurence Evans, who was Olivier’s close friend for sixty years. In addition, tliey were pro- fessionally associated from the time of dieir work on an early sound film, tlirough the Hollywood years, dieir collaboration on the film of Henry V and at the Old Vic during and after World War 11; their professional relationsliip and personal trust culmi- nated when Laurence Evans eventually became Olivier’s agent and trustee. Laurence Evans provided me widi incalculably cru- cial material, submitted to numerous personal interviews and transadantic telephone inquiries and facilitated important intro- ductions. He and liis wife, Maiy (whose diaries were indispens- able aids in tracing the contours of Olivier’s last tv'enty years), were also attentive and devoted friends to me wliile I lived in London preparing this book, and I am grateful for die many memorable occasions I enjoyed dieir generous hospitality and the warmth of their homes in London and Sussex. Elaine Markson, my agent, is a wise and trusted friend; her guidance of my career, her abiding affection and leavening humor enrich my life daily in more ways than I can say, and she gives new meaning to the word patience. She and her associates Geri Tlioma, Lisa Callamaro, Karin Beisch and Sally Wofford— are ever buoyant and efficient. I am grateful to be represented by so honorable and intelligent a team.

Gladys and senior editor Thomas Miller provided numerous judicious comments, corrections and suggestions that immeasurably improved my work. Their colleagues Tracy Devine and Jim Homfischer, with unfailing cheerfulness, dispatched numerous daily tasks, tlius also mak- ing my duties easier. At HarperCollins in London, I was equally fortunate to have the amiable and intelligent guidance of editors Simon King, Carol O’Brien and Robert Lacey. Zealous for this book from the first day, they offered many crucial notes and obser- vations. This team was later augmented by Richard Johnson; to him, too, I am most appreciative. Finally, a few words about the name on the dedication page. In 1988, Douglas Alexander came to work with me as a research and libraiy assistant. I quickly recognized his prodigious cre- ative gifts and so, while he continued to be an invaluable aide in the daily tasks of preparing a book — Shunting arcane materials and scrutinizing archives — invited him to collaborate on even more challenging enterprises as my editorial associate (and as my coauthor on works for film and television). It was one of the smartest decisions I ever made. Witli particular regard to this book, it is impossible for me to detail how much I owe him. He read each chapter and offered substantial, acute critiques tliat clarified and bettered the text; he then edited the completed first draft, improving it substantially witli his keen insights and queries. More important still, I cherish Iris loyalty to me and my work, his collegial companionship. Iris humor, gravity and grace. Laurence Olivier is, therefore, offered to Douglas Alexander with tlie autlror s affectionate gratitude. D.S. Los Angeles June 28, 1991 in anniv. 50 auct. nal. CHAPTER ONE 1907-1920 Be has been yonder V the Sun practis- ing behaviour to his own shadow this half-hour, —Maria, in Twelfth Night T he town of Dorking in Surrey, England, is record- ed in manuscripts as early as the twelfth century, the river lu 1 t’'® '’alley of in Victori'f h' Cir dLs n“'?onn' ‘o labored afria ’' f • f inhabitants and Wlew rT f ** of wheat, oats ^ northeast, London in 1907 teemed with doorr° Y ^ Dorking s streets still clattered Trl, r ’ decoratively fringed horse- yeir \"P””S inorning that L‘ ’ r ^'ehicle was parked on Watlien Road, a few hnmA the High Street. Inside a modest semidetached OhMer'^ delivered a son to Agnes and Gerard Like Cooper, Smith or Cari^enter in English, Olivier is n French name denoting a trade; it identifies one who plantJ, 2 DONALD SPOTO tends or sells olive trees. The Olivier family is an old French one, traceable to Laurent de Olivier (for whom the infant was named), a sixteenth-century citizen of Nay, a village near the Pyrenees in southwest France. De Olivier’s descendant, the Huguenot Jourdain Olivier, came to England in 1688 as chaplain to William of Orange, and the family clerical tradition continued ■svith his son Jerome, born in London. The lineage is remark- able for a profusion of clergymen, and its family emblem expresses the ideal of devout service; the motto accompa- nying an olive branch of peace is the eighth verse of Psalm 52, “Sicut oliva virens laetor in aede Dei — Just as the flourishing olive tree, so do I rejoice in the house of God.” By 1800, Jerome’s grandson, the Reverend Daniel Stephen Olivier, was rector of the Established Church in Clifton, Bedfordshire. Daniel’s son Henry became a lieu- tenant colonel in tlie army, and Heniy’s children (by Mary Dacres, daughter of a rear admiral) included the Reverend Dacres Olivier, who confirmed tlie family’s venerable status by marrying Emma Eden, daughter of the Primate of the Church of Scotland. Dacres himself was promoted to a rec- torship at Wilton and died as a canon at Salisbury Cathedral. Dacres and Emma had ten children, among whom were the Reverend Henry Eden Olivier (who mar- ried the daughter of Queen Victoria’s chaplain) and the novelist Edith Olivier. The eldest son of Lieutenant Colonel Heniy Stephen Olivier was the Reverend Henry Arnold Olivier, rector of .Poulshot, Wiltshire. In addition to siring six daughters, tliis Reverend Olivier had four sons. Henry became a career officer. Sydney was commander in chief of Jamaica and sec- retary of state for India during 1924, when a hfe peerage made him the first Lord Olivier. Herbert became a noted portrait and landscape painter and was Britain’s official war lAXJRENCE OLIVIER Jz 3 artist from 1914 to 1919. The youngest of tlie four sons was Gerard Kerr Olivier. Born on April 30, 1869, Gerard was first educated at Winchester. He had a fine singing and speaking voice and at first intended to follow his father's example and join the ministry. But tliis idea was derailed after he was sent down from Merton College, Oxford, as a result of his extravagant spending and a wild drinking spree. Rebuked by his par- ents, Gerard calmly announced tliat he had abandoned his plans for the priesthood in favor of teaching. He then attended Hatfield College of Durham University, where he completed a degree and was a useful member of the cricket team. Admired more for his suave manner and attractiveness tlian for any remarkable intelligence, Gerard at twenty cut a tall, handsome and slim figure, witli penetrating gray eyes and a wide^ expressive mouth. During one term holiday, he readily agreed to appear in a painting by his brother Herbert, for whom he posed as a comely, half-naked Actaeon. Of his natural assets Gerard was fully aware, and in 1894, at age twenty-five (after some further studies at Heidelberg), he had no difficulty securing a position as assistant master of a preparatory school in Guildford, Surrey. Alert and confident, he soon attracted the attention of Agnes Louise Crookenden, tlie headmaster’s sister-in- law. Bom on December 1, 1871 in Kidbrooke, Kent (where her father Isaac was a minor official of a gas company), Agnes was an extremely pretty and intelligent young woman with tliick chestnut hair, bright brown eyes, alabaster skin and a quick humor. The engagement extended four years while Gerard and his fiancee saved enough money to marr)'’ and open their own school. Soon after their wedding at St. James’s Church, 4 ^ DONALD SPOTO Kidbrooke, on April 30, 1898 (Gerard s twenty-ninth birth- day), the couple moved into Tower House, Dorking, and welcomed tlieir first students. Gerard was a stem master, as intimidating toward his young charges on the cricket field as he was in the classroom. On July 26, 1901 — with all England still mourning Queen Victoria’s death and prepar- ing for tlie accession of her son Edward — Agnes gave birth to a girl they named Sybille. But soon after, enrollment at Gerard’s school, as else- where, dropped alarmingly. Because most local children were needed to supplement the family income, there were only twenty-four students beyond the age of fourteen in Surrey’s schools in 1901. Simultaneously, Gerard announced to Agnes that he had rediscovered his faitli and had decided to become a priest — a decision that caused her no particular joy, for the country curate’s life was tradition- ally frugal, if not downright impecunious. But he insisted that the ministry could prowde him botli with a wider field for his talents as a persuasive teacher and with a connection to his revered ecclesiastical past. Over the next two years, Gerard added religious studies to his teaching duties; in 1903 he was ordained in the Church of England. Gerard Olivier was one of many who favored the Roman designation “Father” over the Anglican “Reverend” or “Mister,” just as he preferred sung High Masses, incense, gold brocade vestments, wearing a cassock in public and leading pious weekday devotions — elements that had again become popular in the Church of England since the Oxford Movement. Led by John Henry Newman, John Keble and Edward Pusey, the movement urged (among other tilings) [ the adoption of considerable Roman Catholic ceremonial, I ritual and vestments as the Oxford scholars sought renewal 1 LAURENCE OLIVIER X 5 of the Established Anglo-Catholic Church against “Low Church” Protestant tendencies. (Some, like Newman, even- tually became Roman Catliohcs.) As one of the movement’s heirs, Father Ohvier saw his Christian Englishness as inti- mately linked to an ancient, hallowed, apostolic tradition. He had been a stem, aloof schoolmaster with a penchant for stylish dress and somewhat orotund speech and, accord- ing to tlie actress Sybil Thorndike (whose father was to be a priestly colleague a few years later), Gerard probably would have liked to be an actor himself, for he was dramatic in his sermons and elegant in his appearance. As Fatlier Olivier, he was serious about his parochial duties, and although he seems not to have been a man of especial piety, neither was he a hypocrite. Of his time in Dorking, a local church record simply claimed, “He was very popular during his several years of persistent and energetic work in the parish.” His brand of religion was meant to be socially respectable and ethically sound, but not necessarily mysti- cal; his was a Christianity that glorified the king as God’s legate, the bishops as His ambassadors, and patriotism as a sure sign of godliness. This was die spirit diat animated his ancestors, and he enjoined it on his own children. In 1904, Gerard closed die school on Tower Hill, moving his family northward across town to 26 Wadien Road, a red brick house widi a sitting room and kitchen on the ground floor, two small bedrooms above, and a small garden in die real-. That summer, he was appointed curate at the Dorking parish church of St. Martin’s. A iieo-Godiic edifice domi- nating die village since 1875, St. Martin’s featured a marble reredos, an ornate cracifudon scene over die choir, elabo- rate stained-glass windows and an expensive pipe organ — all of which appealed to Gerard Olivier. Its two-hundred-foot- high spire was clearly visible from \"Wadien Road, just a few hundred yards away. 6 y: DONALD SPOTO At the church font, Father Olivier christened his son Gerard Dacres (always called Dickie) soon after his birdi on September 5, 1904. And there too he baptized tlreir third and last child, Laurence Kerr Olivier, who was born at Wathen Road on May 22, 1907. The Edwardian era was at its zenith. Quick to smile and keen on sport, Edward VII was devoted to aU kinds of pleasure, including the theater. The decade of his reign — ^beginning when he was fifty-nine in 1901 — was marked by an opulent and freewheeling courtly hfe tliat welcomed dramatists, actors and music-hall performers as readily as it did world leaders. “The modem English stage has been made by King Edward,” said actor-manager Charles Wyndham at the time. “His Majesty has made the theater fashionable and respected.” A man of Umited intel- lect but potent charm, the king also infused his native pro- priety with a fresh, unpatronizing regard for the working commoner. But by 1907 there was a greater change in society than a mere shift of monarchical style. Britain was no longer unas- sailably confident of its eternal primacy among the nations, as Victorian preachers and statesmen had liked to maintain. Edward himself, preferring pohtical realism and compro- mise, sensed that earher certainties about class distinctions, economics and the routes to pohtical power were undergo- ing a slow but irreversible process of erosion and transfor- mation. In England, the affable sovereign was witnessing the rise of hberalism in pohtics and the emergence of sociahsm in a strident labor movement. Despite important reforms in the educational system, schoohng was a luxury for the vast major- ity of Enghsh households. Abroad, there were bloody con- LAURENCE OLIVIER 7 flicts in South Africa, uneven relations with Germany, prob- lematic accords with Japan and Russia and disputes with China. Glamorous idealism at court clashed with bitter unrest in Parliament, and there were increasingly angiy com- plaints about the plight of the overwhelmingly poor majority. But in fashionable London drawing rooms, certain Victorian traditions were still highly prized, and there were fierce arguments about the replacement of men’s frock coats by the more comfortable lounge suit. Even more hotly debated was die drastic reduction in whalebone corseting for women and die raising of hemhnes to two or even three inches above the ankle. For many concerned gentlefolk, diese l^ses in formality — ^and die individualism they beto- kened — ^heralded the imminent collapse of the Empire. Nowhere was the decline of uniformity more obvious dian in matters of religion. The orthodoxy and praxis of the established and official Church of England had been severely weakened by die proliferation of freethinkers, the rising divorce rate and the increase of interfaidi marriages; by the multiplication of new denominations and the spread of low-church nonconformism; by die gradual integration of Roman Cadiolics within all aspects of public life (following die Cadiolic Emancipation Act of 1829, which extended to them civil and pohtical rights); and by the open criticism of traditional doctrines and dogmas by writers, philosophers and politicians. Creed sat lightly on the great majority in the middle and upper classes,” one English historian noted. “The Bible lost its hold on diem, and die volume of outward religious observance shrank steadily [as] the labour and socialist movement poached extensively” on the preserve of the realm s faith. Nevertheless, a clergyman in Edwardian England was a distant member of an extended royal court diat counted bishops in die House of Lords and curates at 8 DONALD SPOTO garden parties more numerous than royals at Ascot. One risk to the integrity of any established national reli- gion is a concomitant polite respectability tliat is often taken for profound virtue. An estabhshed ministry can be a pass- port to esteem, and a man of no particular spiritual gifts but who is zealous for social approbation can reasonably, aim to attach himself to an aristocrat or perhaps even to a member of a royal family. The novels of Jane Austen and Antliony Trollope satirically depict the minor clerical gentry who admired tlie nobility, imitated their speech and sometimes vulgarly affected tlieir mannerisms. To this revered ecclesiastical estate Gerard Olivier aspired when he decided to exchange an instructor’s govern for a priestly cassock, tlie garb worn by so many of his illus- trious forebears. In him, tlie twin devotions to crown and cross fused easily, in his son Laurence tlie amalgam was fur- ther complected with a strongly literal and metaphorical sense of militaristic pride. If the father was a warder, the son was a yeoman. When Laurence was two, the Oliviers moved northeast to a larger house they named East Dene (after its district, Deepdene), near the lush forests of Box HiU and closer to the river Mole. In the garden, Agnes cultivated vegetables and flowers, and among her youngest son’s first vague memories was the sight of his mother, swatlied in a white sunhat and flowing white dress, happily gathering a little harvest while he perched in a pram close by. He was her Lany, or “Baby,” she his “Mums.” In 1910 they moved again, this time to London, where Gerard had secured what he hoped would be a more presti- gious curacy, at St. James s. Netting Hill, and they lived at 86 Elgin Crescent.-A four-story terrace house off Ladbroke LAURENCE OLIVIER X 9 Grove, tlris was the place of Larry’s first clear memories. From his rear bedroom window, he overlooked a wide, ver- dant public park separating the houses of Elgin Crescent from tliose in Blenheim Crescent, and here his mother first taught him tlie names of flowers and trees, instilling in him a lifelong love of gardens and gardening. The family situa- tion was not one of genteel poverty, as Olivier later said. Young Larry was regularly taken to his father s church (in St. James’s Gardens, off St. Ann’s Road), and here he first saw an imposing lifesize crucifix, heard the choral music, and caught (as he said later) “tlie feeling of a show.” Before his fifth birdiday, there was another change — this time because of renovations at St. James’s. While the work was in progress, the faithful joined the parishioners of St. Clement’s, a few blocks away. Two parish staffs were unnecessary, and soon Father Olivier and his family moved to 22 Lupus Street, Pimlico, a narrow terrace house diago- nally opposite his new post at St. Saviour’s. In the new house, two aspects of Larry’s young character femerged. He became a proficient liar and made a kind of stage debut. Common though lying may be among children — ^perhaps as a way of asserting their own minds and wills against parental omniscience — ^it was a significant enough memory for Olivier to devote a page to it in his autobiography Confessions of an Actor seventy years later. Apparently the habit was linked to a slyly manipulative personality, for (to his father’s dismay) Larry was much pampered by his modi- er ( I was tlie apple of her eye”). But the lying became an alarming trait, and his mother occasionally resorted to a sound beating to correct it. Lying may also have been an early sign of a vivid fantasy life, as indeed Larry’s games of make-believe at Lupus Street indicate. He was also an expert little mimic, imitating 10 X DONALD SPOTO his fatlier’s religious rituals with a cross, a candle stub and a blanket for hturgical vestment. And he entertained family friends with a variety of sounds, from birds and dogs to train whistles. More remarkable was the series of amusements Larry frequently staged at home from the age of five or six. Often he dragged a wooden chest in front of a window, around which he rigged the curtains for a stage effect. He set church candles in cigarette tins for footlights, and in tliis makeshift playing area he sang, danced and improvised what he thought were excerpts from plays performed at his brother Dickie’s school. His audience consisted of his sister and sometimes a visiting relative or a neighborhood child — but always, and most attentively entliusiastic, his mother, “my heaven, my hope, my entire world, my own worshiped Mummy,” as he termed her even in his old age. He played shamelessly to her, and whenever he stumbled she encour- aged him, applauding heartily when he got tlirough a scene and hugging him tightly at die finish. “Mummy was just everytliing,” according to SybiUe: She was the most enchanting person. Hair so long she could sit on it. She absolutely made our childhood, and she adored Larry. He was hers. He always amused her very much. He was a complete clown. He’d have the whole lunch table shaking with laughter. There was, however, no mention by SybiUe or Lany of any similar warmth from their father. Quite the contrarj% for Larry was terrified of him, referring to him decades later as a frightening Victorian figure who considered his youngest child only a needless expense, since he already had a lovely daughter and a male heir. Gerard— ever seek- ing means of economizing— required Lany to batlie in tub lAURENCE OLIVIER ^ 11 water tliat lie and Dickie had already used. Forever after, Lany felt that his mother’s favoritism for him further antag- onized his father, but this may have been as much Agnes’s attempt to compensate for Gerard’s hostility as the cause of it. Sybille recalled tlieir father’s temper as a storming, rag- ing tornado directed almost exclusively at Larry, but rarely at herself or Dickie. “I was frightened. More than anytiiing else, I was terri- fied,” Laurence Olivier said years later, summing up his childhood. And to augment that fear, the man to whom he looked for loving, sustenance and who offered him only a chilly indifference also represented the- ineffable, unimagin- able world of God. In the dusty darkness of St. Saviour’s Church, Larry watched as parishioners deferred to his fatlier. He saw the autocratic taskmaster garbed in ancient vesture, conducting mysterious rites and heard him speak- ing from the pulpit of things transcendent, warning of tlie risk of damnation. By the time he began to attend primary school, the tense relationship witli his father had brought out another trait; Larry developed a quiet, somber demeanor and sometimes sat wordlessly for long periods at home; at times, tliere was almost something remote and sad about the child. His childhood was thus a dramatic inconstancy of playroom antics and maternal solace, uneasily counterpoised \\vith dark pieties that confused earthly and heavenly fatlierhood. The result was a tangle of emotional realms, of youthful frolics surviving in an atmosphere of cool, respectable rigidities. Photographs from this period show a handsome, round-faced boy with tousled hair. Iris clear brown eyes and gentle half-smile suggesting a slightly fearful uncertainty about just how the adult world perceives him. 12 X DONALD SPOTO In 1914, Larry was sent to a day school in Blacklieatli, soutli of the Thames, his brief attendance marked by a tearful homesickness for his mother. Agnes enrolled him for a term at a school in Cliveden Place, Sloane Square, which was much closer and enabled her to deliver and collect her seven-year-old. But soon there was trauma greater than the emotional adjustment of first school days. Since 1066, no foreign power had invaded England’s shores, and London had seemed invio- lable until June 1915, when tlie German Zeppelin attacks of the World War began. In August tlie bombings continued in tlie East End, and tlie following montli the streets blazed — just when Larry was beginning two terms at the Francis Holland Church of England School in Graham Terrace. London life became noticeably drabber. The Oxford-Cambridge boat race and cricket test matches were suspended, and the British Library, the Tate Gallery and most of the Victoria and Albert Museum were shut. Surface transport, which had only recently been vddely expanded, was severely curtailed as buses were shipped to tlie front in France. At the same time, the gasoline shortage at home meant cutbacks in both taxis and the private use of motor- cars. Every class used tlie underground and trams, tlius insti- tuting an unprecedented social mix diat outlasted wartime. Virtually every family in London was affected by the war, either by damage at home or the loss of a loved one abroad. Of the eiglit million Englishmen mobilized, eventually two million were wounded and almost a million died. King George V, who had succeeded his father Edward VII in 1910, roused the peo- ple to vigilant sacrifice. Londoners affected a bright and eager patriotism, and every young man eiqiected that he would even- tually follow his elders into battle. LAURENCE OLIVIER 'k 13 By autumn 1916, Agnes and Gerard were informed that nine-year-old Lany, after a vocal audition, had been admit- ted to the school Diclde already attended — All Saints, in Margaret Street, near Oxford Circus. Following his recep- tion of First Communion and Confirmation, the roll book recorded Laurence Kerr Olivier s formal entry to the school as the 283rd pupil in All Saints’s history. Since opening in 1848, All Saints had acquired a reputa- tion as one of the most exclusive choir schools in Britain, an ideal place for an English boy to prepare for later entry to public school. Its fourteen boys boarded in a highly disci- plined environment. But while it was respected for its aca- demic and musical traditions. All Saints was (like many otlier schools) a quiet cauldron of incivihty, crudeness and petty cruelty. Corporal punishment was frequently adminis- tered, and from this the boys took their cue. Dormitory life required a student to be tough and vigilant, for bullies abounded. Altliough All Saints lacked the grisly horrors of Nicholas Nickleby’s Dotheboys Hall, neither did it offer tlie decorum of a Sacred Heart Convent. When not singing in choir (which required its own litur- gical garb of black or red cassock, collar and white suq3lice), the choristers wore die school uniform of gray trousers, a cerise tie with matching socks, a wide Eton collar and patent-leather shoes with a silver buckle. The cost of this clothing was included in the annual fee of twenty-four pounds (about one hundred dollars). For the vicar of All Saints, the redoubtable, humorless H. F. B. Mackay, the choir school wils of special impor- tance. He loved dignity and protocol, and he was cold and strict. Mackay’s choirboys were somewhat rigid and over- drilled, but there could never, he insisted, be an excess of perfect manners. The children must move, walk and turn in unison mid al\\v;m‘ be neat and precise, with their suqilices 14 X DONALD SPOTO perfectly starched and ironed. They must show to the wor- shipers an image of proper religious deportment and gen- tlemanly etiquette. Discipline was demanded especially in chapel, which had been designed under the influence of Anglo-Catholicism. The focus was a single altar, enclosed by a low marble wall. The nave arches, supported by shafts of Aberdeen red gran- ite, carried the eye forward toward the sanctuary and the pulpit of multicolored inlaid marble. It was the most solemnly designed church Larry had seen, and he spent at least two hours here almost daily for over four years. When Father Mackay preached, his voice resonated, rising and falling in rich cadences — indulgent one moment and cau- tionary the next, first gentle and then severe — and the young chorister learned that his father was not tire only suc- cessful public performer, not tlie only cynosure of eyes. The preacher utilized all tlie actor’s rhetorical skills to win tlie attention of his congregation. Like all their classmates, Larry and Dickie returned home one weekend each month. In addition to solemn Masses on Sundays, they sang at Morning Prayer and Evensong, at seasonal feasts and at parish weddings and funerals diroughout the year. They mastered tlie works of Bach, Mozart, Handel and Schubert as well as Tallis, Wesley, Stainer, Stanford and others of tlie English choral tradition. In the classrooms, tliere were daily lessons in reli- gion, literature, mathematics and histoiy. Sports were also compulsory. But the most famous of their cultural activities, apart from the choir, was the dramatic society. In December and January of each year, under the direction of Father Geoffrey Heald, the students presented excerpts from plays. There was also a holiday treat for all tlie boys that winter of 1916 — and it was especially important for Lany. LAURENCE OLIVIER X 15 Heniy Pelham-Clinton, the Duke of Newcastle, a devout High Churchman and a generous patron of All Saints, invit- ed the boys and their teachers to be his guests for the annu- al Christmas pantomime Babes in the Wood at the Strand Theatre. The show offered a hotchpotch of scenes and skits: a precision children’s ballet; a dancer with the unlikely name of Pauline Prim, who mimed a balloon-popping cat; a reenactment of scenes from the tale of Robin Hood, with a boy and girl cast, respectively, as girl and boy; and brief slapstick acts, topical songs, acrobatics and the always-popu- lar male-female impersonations. Afterward, the duke escorted them backstage to meet the performers and to see the stage machinery. In the new year 1917, Larry still did not mix easily witli his peers. Slender to the point of delicacy, overprotected by his mother and ignored by his father, he had no natural apti- tude for the playing field. “I was a muddled kind of boy, a weakling,” he remembered. “As a child I was a shrimp, as a youth I was a weed — a miserably thin creature whose arms hung like wires from my shoulders.” To tliose who had not seen his precocious performances at home, everything about Larry must have seemed unexceptional. His class- mate Laurence Naismith (who also became an actor) remembered him as an ordinary boy with nothing remark- able about him. The young Olivier was, however, singularly proficient in elocution and recitation. “The distinction between tlie various vowel sounds must not become blurred, nor pronunciation indistinct, nor facial expression stiff,” warned the Board of Education’s 1912 guidebook. Suggestions for the Consideration of Teachers. Informal conversation classes were scheduled — designed to overcome shyness and foster sponta- 16 S DONALD SPOTO neous conversation. “Distinct articulation must be required,” the teachers’ guide continued. “In reading aloud, students must be on guard against exaggerated or affected expression and merely mechanical rules such as raising one’s voice at a comma. The essential quality is clearness of utterance.” In this, die priests at All Saints were most fervent, for diey diemselves had been trained for pulpit preaching. Lany’s teachers gave particular attention to die recitation of poeby, and for four years he was required to memorize long passages from Scott, Macaulay, Longfellow and Tennyson. “Shakespeare is perhaps the most difficult of all authors to handle in school,” cautioned die Su^estions, “but some of his easier plays — ^like Hennj V — can be enjoyed by the more advanced children.” Every boy at All Saints was treated hke an advanced pupil, and because the teachers refused die expediency of abridged editions or prose sum- maries, the ten-year-olds were painstakingly led dirough die thickets of iambic pentameter. Few were to exploit this train- ing so direcdy and successfully as Laurence Olivier. - He had his first opportunity very soon. In die parish hall. Father Heald rehearsed scenes from Julius Caesar, and Larry, the youngest and smallest, was cast as one of die citi- zens; his brother Dickie was Caesar. The boy playing Brutus, however, proved inadequate, and Larry was pro- moted to that role. Although he was small and diin for the part (and the other boys were older), he had impressed Father Heald with his quick aptitude for rhetoric. Rehearsals were often accompanied by air raids, but Lany, absorbed in the text, crouched under a table in die crypt and memorized his speeches. , “We embarked on the Roman scenes of Julius Caesar,” recalled Geoffrey Heald years later. “It was the cramped stage space [of the parish hallj which niade us take to the Elizabethan method of playing amongst' the audience.” LAURENCE OLIVIER It 17 Sybil Thorndike considered Heald one of the unsung visionaries of tlie theater, his productions more advanced than any of the time, since he used the entire auditorium (including tlie aisles) for the action of his productions. To the performance came not only parents and parish- ioners, but also Sybil Thorndike 'widi her father, who was a friend of Gerard and a priest at St. James’s, Pimlico, and the great Ellen Terry; perhaps the most famous actress in the world at that time, Terry routinely attended the respected productions at All Saints. Years later, Sybil Thorndike recalled that Larry gave a remarkable performance. Another member of the audience was Evelyn Light, who also came from a clerical family; she was dancing instructor for the boys at All Saints. After the performance, everyone was praising the Caesar and the Antony, but Ellen Terry, putting aside the paper bag of boiled sweets she munched constantly, said, “No.” And tliere was silence, I shall never forget it. “The boy who played Brutus,” she said. “The dark little boy — ^lie is a bom actor.” (When told of Miss Terry’s endorsement, Larry asked, “Who is she?”) The complimentary remarks by Thorndike, Terry and others were of course made many years later, and it is easy to detect the wisdom of hindsight, Larry’s playing may well have been astonishing in light of his youth and inexperience — admirable from a child, but hardly the per- formance of a seasoned adult professional. In any case, Larry soon announced to Father Heald diat he wanted to be an actor. In tliat case, tlie priest replied, he must read Dickens, and he would never lack for a characterization. 18 % DONALD SPOTO It was natural in 1917 for families like the Oliviers, the Tliomdikes and die Lights to be as enthusiiistic for die theater as were the priests of All Saints. Following the Reformation’s rejection of the medieval mysteries and the subsequent Puritan reaction against licentious Restoration plays and their notorious actresses, tliere had until recently been a long tradition of religious hostility to the theater. Preachers regularly attacked the drama and its exponents, and as late as 1900 the Church Pastoral Aid Society called on vicars to regard local theatrical perfor- mances as a menace to the .spiritual influence of the Church. After Queen Victoria knighted PIcnry Irving in 1895, however, and in light of her son Edward’s subsequent attraction to the theater and its people, the acting profes- sion enjoyed official court approval. This did not mean automatic ecclesiastical approbation, but by 1900 there flourished in London the vigorous Actors’ Church Union, founded by the Reverend Donald Hole (who some years earlier had supported the defunct “Church and Stage Guild” led by his old friend, the Reverend Stewart Headlam), Hole’s wife was a touring actress, and his Actors’ Church Union was established not to proselytize, but “to organize the work of the clergy more easily within the reach of the theatrical profession, whose lives are spent in travelling from place to place.” They became chaplains to sick actors on tour and also took to helping players find lodgings. Even for actors with minimal religious or spiritual interests, the Union was a helpful and caring influence in their lives. Many prominent actors Joined—Cyril Maude, Ben Greet, George Alexander, Johnston Forbes-Robertson, Lilian Braithwaite, Ellen Terry, Charles Wyndham, Irene Vanbrugh and the Thorndikes. Soon there were twelve national ACU centers where clerics either ministered to or simply maintained social con- LAURENCE OLIVIER la 19 tact witli local tlieaters. (One former actor was by this time dean of Rochester Cathedral, and he persuaded his bishop to endorse the Union officially.) In all its activities, the Union emphasized social, professional and practical assis- tance for needy actors — ^it was in no sense a moral police, much less an agency to gain converts. In 1914 tliere were over 900 actor members and 350 chaplains at over 250 cen- ters, and the Union could proudly claim that “the atmo- sphere of suspicion and misunderstanding which once existed between the Clergy and the Actor is now almost entirely a thing of the past.” Accordingly, anti-Puritans influenced by the Oxford Movement — High Churchmen Uke Fathers Mackay (whose brother Gayer Mackay was an actor) and Heald (whose virtual avocation was directing and acting) and Fathers Ohvier and Thorndike — ^naturally gravi- tated to the theater. It was at last a respectable interest for clergymen as well as princes. The school year continued, and lessons now included a course in British history arid recitations of suitable poems (Macaulay's “Spanish Armada” was on the list, along with selections from Sir Walter Scott), and classes on the lives of heroic men and women (Socrates, Hannibal, Marcus Aurelius, Charlemagne, Francis of Assisi, Joan of Arc and Henry IV of France). “Stress should be laid,” urged the Board of Education’s Su^estions, “on the personal quahties of the heroes of tlie stories, and the pictorial illustrations . . . should be bold and dramatic.” No teacher would have failed to refer to the men fighting for England in tlie trenches; no schoolboy, witli these recitations interrupted by war news and air-raid warnings, would have been unmoved by the implied canons of heroism. This association between great ives and the nobility of patriotism would always be linked 20 'k DONALD SPOTO for Larry and would inform much of his later achievement. The gentlemen of the theater were unlikely to be forgot- ten in this honor roll, for diey were among the most noted patriots, both as fighting men and propagandists for victoiy. Actors like Basil Rathbone and Lewis Casson (who was married to Sybil Thorndike) were serving with distinction on the Continent and were awarded the Military Cross, and their colleagues Godfrey Tearle, Ivor Novello, Ben Travers and Cedric Hardwicke were also at war. Actors were fre- quently heard on variety stages, in Hyde Park and at con- certs, making speeches or recitations, and Sir Frank Benson began a tradition when he selected passages from Shakespeare for a rousing program of patriotic pieces. That autumn, Larry was still rather slight of build — ^tlie per- fect choice when Father Heald needed a convincing Maria for his Christmas production of scenes from Twelfth Night “The smallest wren of nine,” Maria has to look diminutive but wily, and Larry eagerly took on the role, scampering about the stage in the plot to fool Malvolio witlr the forged letter. (The sudden indisposition of the boy cast as Sir Toby Belch led to a last-minute appearance by a churchwarden’s daughter named Ethel McGlinchy, who was later to become famous as an actress with the more impressive name Fabia Drake.) Again, there were theater notables in die audience, led by the enthusiastic Ellen Teny. In 1918, Gerard Olivier secured a rectorship at St. Mary’s in Letchworth, Hertfordshire. He and Agnes took up residence at a large Queen Anne parsonage there, and the same year Sybille went to London for studies in voice and drama, which she soon abandoned for an office job. Nobody wanted to act more tiian Sybille, Olivier said years later. She had all the aspirations on earth but was absolute- LAURENCE OLIVIER ^2. 21 ly no good, poor darling.” Dickie left All Saints for Radley, where Larry hoped to join him. While he remained at All Saints, Larry’s academic achievements were resoundingly average. Easily bored by most subjects except poetry and a few classes in botany and liistoiy, he did not distinguish himself in his examinations. He enjoyed tlie religious rituals at All Saints, tlie choirboy s responsibihties and the drama of the solemn liturgy. Most of all he coveted the role of tliurifer, the boy who carried tlie chain-suspended thurible, carefully but grandly swing- ing it in wide arcs to cloud die sanctuary and nave with bil- lows of pungent incense. Lany seems also to have affected a kind of cockiness that belied his sensitivity, perhaps to compensate for his still immature appearance at twelve. On Saturday evenings, when there was no “prep,” or study hall, he often enter- tained his classmates widi impromptu impersonations of (as classmate John Freebaim-Smidi recalled) die organist, die kitchen staff and film actors such as Charles Chaplin. Sometimes Larry was overconfident, and forever after he recalled a day in choir when, assigned a solo part, he calmly closed the music book, convinced he knew everything per- fecdy. Gazing upward, ignoring the score as if only a rank amateur would need it, he was overcome widi guilt for his superior attitude. Suddenly short of breath, his voice cracked and he missed his cue. Olivier always remembered tiiis embarrassing moment as a punishment for his pride. In early 1920, Larry first saw his family’s friend Sybil Thorndike onstage, when she invited the Oliviers to a per- formance of The Mystery of the Yellow Room. Sybil and Larry chattered happily backstage after die final curtain, the pleasure of die evening marred only by die absence of 22 X DONALD SPOTO Agnes Olivier, v^^ho was feeling ill. Throughout the previous autumn, Agnes had occasionally complained of headaches and suffered several fainting spells. During Lany’s monthly visits from school, she hid her increasing discomfort from him, but by Avinter she was experiencing frequent bouts of nausea and occasional blurred vision. In early March a doc- tor was consulted, and soon there was a bleak diagnosis. Agnes was suffering from ghoblastoma, a particularly fast- growing, inoperable and lethal tumor within tlie brain cells. Witli admirable calm and, it seemed, concern solely for the future of her youngest child, Agnes prepared herself and her family as best she could. Larry was told only that his mother required rest, that she had been ill, but that all the resources of medicine and prayer were being summoned. One Sunday in mid-March, he was preparing to return to school from a weekend at home. Agnes, by this time partial- ly paralyzed, called him to her bedside, as Sybille recalled. Their mother seemed much older than her forty-eight years and very weary as she whispered to him, “Good-bye, my darling.” They embraced for a moment, and Larry stood briefly in the doorway, wearing his shabby winter coat, his scliool cap in his hands. He never saw her again. Two weeks later, on Saturday evening, March 27, 1920, Father Heald came to Larry after choir practice and told him that his mother had gone to God. CHAPTER TWO And those things do best please me That befal preposterously. — Puck, in A MiDSUMAfER Night's Dbeam F ^OR twelve-year-old Larry Olivier, for whom his mother’s devotion and endorsement were crucial, her death was frightful indeed. Her sudden absence produced a sense of desertion and abandonment, a rude introduction to adolescent independence and perhaps the suspicion tliat any loving relationship could be suddenly and capriciously terminated. \"I don’t tliink I ever got over it,” he said often in later years. “She was marvelous to me. I was the baby, she was the world to me, and I belonged to her. I didn’t know my fatlier. When she died it was the most shat- tering thing imaginable.” Unfailingly encouraging of her son’s interests, Agnes Olivier had been a genially energetic, fun-loving woman ■vvitli a bright sense of humor, and Larry had absorbed her spirit as well as die dark, detached, ecclesiastical formality of his fatlier. In his modier he had seen an amused, amus- ing and contented middle-class citizen; in his father, a man longing for social position and influence and apparently ful- filled by the genteel life of an ^stocrat manqu^. Later, the 24 % DONALD SPOTO mature Laurence Olivier could be alternately an affable companion witliout social pretense and a celebrity with the grave air of a venerable nobleman. Whether the word sin is ever mentioned, an unprepared child often feels guilty for the death of a loving parent. The matter of sinfulness had been a recurring theme in the moral injunctions Larry had heard from infancy: He had first heard about evil in his fatlier’s sermons and then more elaborately in die admonitions of his priestly teachers at All Saints. Disrespect, rowdiness, lying, laziness, the ordinary sexual curiosity of children — all these Victorian-Edwardian society in general and the Church in particular routinely classified as worthy of divine displeasure and punishment. Since his mother s death could not be regarded as pun- ishment for her sins, it would have been natural for him to see it as having been caused at least partially by his sins — for having been somehow disobedient, for having dis- pleased God by displeasing his father. For the rest of his life , in conversation and in writing, guilt and sin were aston- ishingly frequent terms in Laurence Olivier’s vocabulary, and he constantly reproached himself for actions and omis- sions for which he felt guilty. “Bless me. Reader, for I have sinned ’ appears at die opening of his memoirs. “Since my last confession, which was more tiian fifty years ago, I have committed the following sins. . . .” The identification of one s life history with a catalog of moral failures is an odd one, perhaps more the trait of a scrupulous choirboy than of a mature man. Except for weekends and holidays, Larry had not lived at ome for three years and had longed for Agnes’s occasional LAURENCE OLIVIER 25 visits to school events; his relationship with Gerard, on the other hand, always bore a suggestion of mutual caution. The children never mentioned their mother’s death to each other, as Sybille remembered years later. It was simply too dreadful to discuss. Sybil Thorndike’s children tried to con- sole Larry, who said only that he was “very very sad” and for weeks wore a black mourning band on his sleeve. Comfort was offered by his Uncle Herbert Olivier (the painter) and his wife Aunt Margaret, who welcomed him to their grand Victorian house at Airhe Gardens, Kensington. Here he was cosseted and entertained, and he enjoyed pumping the huge bellows of tlieir parlor pipe organ while Herbert led the family in an afternoon of merry tunes refreshingly dif- ferent from the staid strains of “Oh, for the Wings of a Dove” and the dour patriotism of “For Thee, Oh Dear, Dear Country,” both regularly sung at school. In autumn 1920, Larry began his final year at All Saints. He developed a taste for serious lyrics, memorizing among others a poem of Yeats to perfect his enunciation: Had I the heavens’ embroidered cloths, Enwrought with golden and silver light. The blue and tlie dim and the dark cloths Of night and hght and the half-light, I would spread the cloths under your feet: But I, being poor, have only my dreams; I have spread my dreams under your feet; Tread softly because you tread on my dreams. Visiting him once at school, Sybille detected a somber side. She noticed tliat he sat for a long time not sa)ing any- thing, as though he was working eveiydliing out in his mind before he spoke. At Christmas, Father Heald presented The Taming oj 26 DONALD SPOTO the Shrew, casting Lany as Katliarine and evoking a lively characterization that delighted the audience. Classmate Laurence Naismith recalled that in a dark wig, elaborate hat, colorful gown and impressive makeup, Lariy was a credibly unruly little girl, and Ellen Terry thought he played the shrew better than anyone except Ada Rehan and gave “an idea of what the boy-actors [who played the women’s roles] in Shakespeare’s time were like!” Sybil Thorndike also judged his portrayal was just right, “a per- fect little bitch — he could play the girls beautifully.” And Theodore Komisarjevsky, who had recently arrived in England and was soon to be one of the most influential tlie- atrical designer-producers, wrote to Father Mackay, prais- ing the sincerity and seriousness of the cast led by an especially impressive Katharine. After the performance, Larry was complimented on both his womanly grace and the frown he had painted on and removed later in the play. “That was my own frown!” he declared emphatically. Although the casting of schoolboys in female roles (and vice versa) was common then as later, Larry’s feminine gestures may well have been inspired by his mother, the fro^vn by his fatlier. In autumn 1921, it was time to move on to higher classes, and Larry entered St. Edward’s School, Oxford, witli twen- ty-nine other new pupils; tire register identifies him as tlie 1,885th boy to enter since the founding in 1863. There were 213 boys at the school that year, most of them clergy- men s sons, admitted at tlie half-tuition of sixty pounds per considered an institution of remark- e 'stinction, consisted of buildings constructed around a central quadrangle, imitating the design of Oxford’s col- ges. omanesque chapel joined classrooms and library LAURENCE OLIVIER 2: 27 to the dining hall and the residence of the warden (or headmaster); there were also residence halls, shops, a small theater and a cricket ground and pavilion. The school was a model of High Church practice and decorum — an exten- sion of life at All Saints, witliout mandatory choir but with compulsory Morning and Evening Prayer every day, in addition to Sunday Mass. Another new boy, Richard F. Wyatt, arrived at St. Edward’s at the same time. He recalled that Larry started appearing in school plays at once and with great success. But like other classmates, Wyatt remembered that Larry seems not to have had a gift for friendsliip. He kept to himself at school, recalled J. D. Newhouse, another student at the time, and no one thought he was remarkable until he acted in a school play. “I was ostracized,” Ohvier wrote later. “I was a flirt [who] sang hke an angel and was as pretty as was needed to attract the worst in certain males,” by which he meant not only older bullies but also those repressed homosexual school- masters who vented their angry frustrations by sadistic strappings of the desired but forbidden boy. (Some schools apparently teem with such teachers, who understand the title “master” rather too hterally.) “In any case, I was gener- ally disliked. My manner was florid, and I was girlish and a bit sissy.” Later in adult conversations with cronies and in the unexpurgated original draft of his memoirs, Olivier added that these qualities made him a ripe target for the sexual advances of older boys, to whom he willingly submit- ted throughout his school years. Such adventures were hardly atypical in the British school tradition. There was considerable respect for Larry’s dedication to oratory and acting, and his abilities were becoming ever more developed. Classmate Carew Wallace recalled tliat the young Ohvier could often be found alone in tlie basement washroom, loudly practicing speeches from Shakespeare 28 X DONALD SPOTO and modifying his volume and intonation. His acting was also, perhaps, a comforting escape from his solitude and unpopularity and a refuge from the sting of his mother’s death. By losing himself in a role, he found not only pleasur- able fantasies but also tlie approval of others, just as he had once earned Agnes’s applause after his little shows at home. Larry’s success with the role of Katharine in The Taming of the Shrew was still fresh in the minds of Fathers Mackay and Heald when All Saints was asked to participate in a birtliday tribute to Shakespeare at tlie Memorial Theatre, Stratford, in spring 1922; they invited Larry to return, therefore, as an honored alumnus at tlie age of fourteen. And so on Thursday, April 27, Larry joined the priests and choristers on a private train provided by the Great Western Railway to take them and their huge wardrobe baskets from London to Stratford. At half past twelve, tlie All Saints visitors, in full choir habit, arrived at Holy Trinity Church, Shakespeare’s burial place. Father Mackay wrote a privately circulated account of the visit, identifying the boys only by tlieir first names (a custom designed — like the omission of players’ names from school dramatic programs — ^to avoid tlie pride of celebrity). Up tlie great lime walk to the Porch came tlie procession of choristers and their Precentor [Heald], the choristers in their rose-coloured caps and cassocks, and ... in tlie midst Larry [Olivier] carrying tlie poet’s wreatli of bays bound with Roman purple. . . . Wlien tlie choristers were grouped about the grave [the stone marker on the church floor, beneath which the poet is buried], Larry knelt and laid their ivreath. The boys sang the dirge “Fear no more the heat o’ tlie sun” (from the fourth act of Cymbeline), set to music by W. S. Vale, choirmaster and organist of All Saints. LAURENCE OLtVlER X 29 A formal luncheon at their hotel was followed by a guid- ed tour of Shakespeare's birthplace and the important sights of Stratford. The American actor James K. Hackett was rehearsing OiheUo at the Memorial Tlveatre, and he welcomed tlie bo)'s, explaining details of scenic design and stagecraft between scenes with his lago (Baliol Holloway) and his Desdemona (Hacketl’s wife, Beatrice Beckley). The performance of The Shrew was given on Friday afternoon, and although his name w^as absent from dm pro- gram and the subsequent review's, this production earned Laurence Olivier his first public notices. “Katharine has [a] fire of her own,\" wTOle the correspondent for The Times. “You feel that if an apple were thrown to this Katharine she would instinctively tr)' to catch it in her lap, and if apples give her pleasure w^e hope with all gratitude that someone will make the experiment.” The reviewer for the Daily Telegraph was also at Stratford: “The boy who took the piut of Kate made a fine, bold, black-eyed hussy, badly in need of taming, and I cannot remember seeing any actress in the part who looked it better.” The Birmingham Post critic praised the boys portrait as “boldly and vigorously played, with dark flashing eyes and a spiteful voice,” and even the Stratford Herald — usually reserved when considering stu- dents’ performances of Shakespeare — singled out Larry’s final speech “as delightful a rendering of tlie lines as could be imagined. . .not one of the traits [of the character] was missing.” Larr)f returned to St. Edward's with a new self-assur- ance, and that spring he tried out successfully for the row- ing crew'. But there was still an adolescent awkwardness and untidiness that would take years to correct. Comb and brush were apparently unknown to him, his meager wardrobe was invariably ill-fitting and unpressed, and his manners were graceless. 30 X DONALD SPOTO Like All Saints, St. Edward’s had an enthusiastic drama coach. W. H. A. Cowell, wdio taught English and Classics, had been directing pupils in scenes from Shakespeare since 1882, and for Christmas 1923 — the sixtieth anniversary of the school — a fully staged production of A Midsummer Night's Dream was presented. After a weekend of football, solemn chapel services, long dinners and longer speeches, the play began on tire afternoon of Tuesday, December 11. The role of Puck, so die program noted, was assigned to L. K. Olivier, who executed tlie miscliief maker s little songs and dances widi wiiy agility. Strapping flashlights round his chest to illuminate his face, Larry sprinted gaily onstage and off, scampered tlmough tlie audience and dashed back and fortli tlirough tlie auditorium doorways in what Cowell called his “open stage production.” But after the challenges of Brutus, Maria and Kate, Larry felt that the manipulative Puck was beneath him: “this wretched part,” as he described it, “this utterly hope- less, so-called opportunity.” Such an attitude affected his performance, which was apparently condescending toward his fellow performers and slightly hysterical in its attempts to impress the audience. “The boy who played Puck,” com- mented a local reporter, “although he had a potent stage presence, emoted with frantic and altogetlier unnecessary' effect, as though playing a joke on his fellow cast members instead of the audience.” And a senior boy named R. C. Mortimer (later Bishop of Exeter) described Larry’s perfor- mance as “by far the most notable, [if] a little too robust and jovial. . .but he gave a consistent rendering, and showed by his gestures and movements that he has a knowledge of act- ing and a good mastery of technique.” Duriiig the winter holiday of 1923-24, Larry’s brother Dickie, now nineteen, sailed for India to work on a rubber LAURENCE OLIVIER ^ 31 plantation. Because this was his last year at St. Edward s and because he had not tlie remotest idea about his future, Lany asked his father when he could make die voyage out to join his brother. The reply was immediate: “Don't be such a fool. You’re not going to India, you’re going on die stage.” So often did Laurence Olivier recount this state- ment in later years diat it had the mythic quality of a great epiphany— the unexpected, transforming moment that altered his destiny. The remote, indifferent father he could never please had, he claimed, ordained his future career. According to Olivier, the discussion occurred at Letchworth, as he was sitting in the lukewarm bath Gerard had left behind, still insisting that Larry avoid the extrava- gance of fresh hot water. But hke this humble setting, the father’s pronouncement is perhaps too dramatically neat, too tidily composed to be credible. The words Larry report- ed may, however, have represented what he wanted to hear his father say — both in 1924 and especially in the difficult years ahead, before his success was assured. Up to tliis time, there is no evidence that Gerard took much interest in Larry’s talent or future, and afterward he did not seem impressed by die progress of his son’s career or even his eventual celebrity and achievements. On the contrary, Gerard Olivier’s concerns were invariably finan- cial; for this reason, he had urged Dickie on his exotic voy- age because there was work in India. In addition, the stage was (tlien as now) among the most parlous careers — ^unreli- able as a source of income and not guaranteed to bring a out a stable or polite life (despite the Thorndikes, whose Recesses onstage and as models of a Christian family erard did not consider typical). On the odier hand, Agnes la encouraged Lany’s acting at home and at school; it was s le w ose approbation buoyed him. At sixteen, he was com- c onstage and obviously pleased his directors and his 32 H DONALD SPOTO audiences. No otlier career excited him, and it was crucial that he enlist Gerard’s support. The neat little bathroom scene has the air of a dramatic reconstruction. And because it tells us sometliing about a son’s wish to please his father (even retrospectively), it contains a truth deeper than any a stenographer might have recorded that evening. Serious training was the first objective. Because young men were desperately needed to complement tlie mostly female enrollment at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London, scholarships and bursaries to cover living expenses were routinely available to them — so much Larry and Gerard learned from Sybille, who had overcome a minor speech defect by studying briefly with the renowned and redoubtable Elsie Fogert)', the school’s director. Larry applied to Fogerly and was told to complete his final term at St. Edward’s before coming to London for an audition in late spring. She also directed him to a touring company in Letchworth, where he appeared in a performance of Macbeth (his smallest role so far, that of Lennox) and learned the duties of assistant stage manager (preparing actors for their entrances, giving cues and serving as general factotum). While Larry concluded his studies at St. Edward’s, his father was preparing to assume the leadership of a small parish at Addington, Buckinghamshire. Gerard was also courting Isobel Buchanan Ronaldson, whom he married on June 27, 1924; at forty-five, Isobel was ten years his junior. But Larry resented Iris mother’s replacement; by tire time of his audition at tire Central School that same month, he was glad of the opportunity to be living on his own, in a tiny London garret in Castellain Road, Maida Vale. LAURENCE OLIVIER X 33 The founding of the Academy of Dramatic Art in 1904 (granted Royal status in 1920) and the Central School of Speech and Drama in 1906 helped to endorse acting by associating it with education. Until the 1920s, actors were often regarded as “rogues and vagabonds,” as they were during the Elizabethan era. The daughter of the great actor-manager Samuel Phelps was expelled from school in die 1850s when it was learned that her father was an actor; the wife of Heniy Irving so ridiculed him about the shame of his profession that they separated, and their grandson was condemned as die “son of a dirty actor”; and as recendy as 1889 — ^wlien she was on the verge of international fame — Mrs. Patrick Campbell received a letter from her Aunt Kate, calling her a “poor unfortunate child . . , yet to learn the shame, the humiliation of seeing yourself despised by decent people” as an actress. Early in her reign, Queen Victoria had been a discerning playgoer and had brought performances to Windsor Castle. Although she denied herself this pleasure for twenty years after the death of her husband Albert, she later regularly attended command performances and received leading actors in her homes. This appreciation was symbolized by her knighthood of Henry Irving in 1895, the first such honor for an actor; the respect was finally sealed viath Edward VIPs avid patronage of tlie theater and its people. Whereas the national census of 1881 counted 4,565 actors, diere were 18,247 in 1911, and during those thirty years twenty-one new theaters were opened in London's West End. Following the precedent set by Irving’s knight- hood, six more actor-managers received the same honor between 1897 and 1913. At the same time, more actors were coming from the landed gentry and from educated backgrounds. The profession’s standing continued to improve in the popular estimation, higher classes of society 34 X DONALD SPOTO were depicted onstage, amateur theatricals expanded, and repertory companies multiplied as the Church took an eager and sustaining interest in the actor s life. The Central School of Speech and Drama emphasized one tiling above all otliers — speech training. Former actress Elsie Fogerty (then fifty-eight) had leased rooms for lec- tures and rehearsals in the upper regions of the Albert Hall in 1906, and there she began to teach the primacy of \"healthy and natural speech.” All the courses in her haphaz- ardly arranged syllabus supported her focus on elocution and the proper production of voice: Physical training and dance classes were aimed at correct breathing, and fencing was taught to develop rhythmic movement as an aid to coherent speech. Even Herbert Norris’s seminars on cos- tumes and Ethel Radmar’s recitations on deportment had felicitous speech as a goal. Norris stressed the effect of one’s wardrobe on breatii control, and Radmar emphasized the social and professional benefits of fine diction. Despite her rather one-sided approach to the craft, Fogerty influenced teacher-training programs in voice; In 1913 the bishops of London and Birmingham were sending young clerics to her, and the following year she opened a clinic of speech pathology at St. Thomas’s Hospital, where she and a small staff treated patients. One of the tough, eccentric maiden ladies dedicated to advancing the British theater, Fogerty was nothing like the pohte clerics of All Saints and St. Edward’s. John Gielgud, who was already act- ing in London in 1924, recalled her as a shapeless, dowdy old lady, but imperious. Wearing a large plumed hat and an array of mismatched costume jewelry (and often witli a col- orful petticoat boldly creeping below her hemline), she greeted students in her commanding baritone, often wav- ing a cheese sandwich with one hand and suggesting a breathing exercise with the other. LAURENCE OLIVIER X 35 Her advice was resolutely unortliodox. In 1933, when he was acting in Richard of Bordeaux, Gielgud had some minor voice trouble and consulted Fogerty. She at once sat him down and told him to imagine tliat his head was a pot of marmalade tliat could communicate a kind of oozy relax- ation to every muscle in his body. For reasons Gielgud never fathomed, tlie advice worked. Peggy Ashcroft, who enrolled at the school in the same term as Ohvier, recalled drat Fogerty was insistent on what the students derisively called the Voice Beautiful, but that aldiough the fencing instruction, movement and elocution classes were superb, acting itself was virtually not taught. Ashcroft accurately described the era; indeed, the reputa- tion of die school’s early years gleams brighter in doctored history than is warranted by honest assessment. Occasionally, estabUshed actors (Gielgud, Thorndike, Edith Evans) sought Fogerty’s assistance for temporary voice problems, but few of her students graduated to careers in the theater. Of the fifty-five students in 1924, fifty were young society ladies content to work harder for a good mar- riage than for a diploma. Mostly debutantes, they were at the school only to learn deportment and the social graces necessary in polite life. And so in June 1924, seventeen-year-old Laurence Olivier joined four odier young men auditioning for Elsie Fogerty; among them was George Goulouris, later famous in, among many American films. Citizen Kane. Olivier chose to recite the \"Seven Ages of Man” speech from the second act of As You Like It, bringing what he thought was a fiery, youthful intensity to the text: All the world’s a stage. And all the men and women merely players. . . . And one man in his time plays many parts. . . . 36 X DONALD SPOTO But it was too fiery, too intense, he was told at once by Fogerty, who called him aside, “\\\\dien you say ‘sudden and quick in quarrel,’ it is not necessary to make fencing pass- es.” And then Elsie Fogerty did something else. “You have,” she said, placing her finger on his brow, “a weakness — there.” Olivier, in repeating this statement, always used it as a justification for his elaborate makeup and false noses. But Fogerty was apparently correcting his evident timidity, his inability to gaze directly at other players onstage, for which he compensated by frenetic actions. Notwithstanding the overstated recitation, Olivier was admitted to the school on full scholarship and \\vitli a fifty- pound bursary (about two hundred dollars) to defray his liv- ing expenses for the nine months his studies would last. Life on little more than a pound a week at a time of postwar inflation was woefully frugal. “I lacked for food,” he said later of this time. “I was hungry and terrified.” And perhaps because of his father’s indifference, there was no support from home. Peggy Ashcroft remembered him as energetic and eager but acutely awkward and downright uncouth, shabbily dressed in clothes inherited from his brother and uncles. Several students also recalled that Olivier walked across Hyde Park carrying his shoes to preserve the leather, for he had only the one pair and could not afford to replace them. By this time, Olivier had reached his full adult height of five feet ten inches. But he was also very thin and according to his classmate Evelyn Ascherson he could not afford a winter overcoat. “But he was full of life — uncontrollable, and that included his hair, his hands and his feet. He was always being told he was waving his hands too dramatically, but he could also produce extraordinary bits of business nobody else thought of.” One of those original bits included a deliberately startling appearance for a scene from The LAURENCE OLIVIER X 37 Tempest that autumn. When he entered as tlie deformed Cahban, the female students suddenly wanted to leave tlie room, one fainted and several required smelling salts, for Olivier had covered himself from head to foot witli green slime and had applied colored plasters to his face and hands with spirit gum, to resemble suppurating carbuncles. He had tahen with utter seriousness die playwright’s descrip- tion of Caliban as \"a freckled whelp, hag-born, not hon- oured with a human shape.” The gasps from his classmates were as heartening as laughter or applause. Not long after, he and Ashcroft appeared in the court scene from The Merchant of Venice (he as Shylock, she as die clerk), and by diis time, as George Coulouris said years later, they were the star girl and boy in Fogerty’s mind. Apparendy, Olivier was learning to modulate and refine liis voice and manner, for the actress Athene Seyler (who had already achieved great success playing in Restoration come- dy) remembered his subdety in the Merchant extract and thought he was leaving somediing for the audience to dis- cover in Shylock. His hair, she recalled, was low over his forehead, and with his big eyebrows and his added makeup, she could hardly see his face. On November 30 and December 1, Henry Oscar (an occasional lecturer at the school) presented and starred in two performances of a new play at the Century Theatre, Bayswater, under the auspices of the Lyceum Club Stage Society. (The society offered four performances annually, financed by subscription. There were many such theater clubs in London at this time, staging new plays in brief runs; they preceded the establishment of Actors’ Equity rules and die distinction between amateur and profession^ performances.) In Byron, by historian Alice Law, Olivier — his first name misspelled in the program as “Lawrence” — played die very small role of a Byzantine officer, for which 38 ^ DONALD SPOTO he was forbidden any distinctive makeup. It was his first professional appearance in London, and it earned him no recognition. Nor was there any indication that Oscar would employ him again, for he felt that around Olivier was “an invisible wall of discomfort.” There would have been numerous causes of such dis- comfort, apart from Olivier s awareness that a seventeen- year-old Englishman could not, without the right greasepaint, appear convincingly as an Oriental. In tlie first place, it would have been natural for him to feel socially inferior. Overnight, the priest’s son had leapt from the rough, conformist, insulated artificiality of the all-male, clerical school into an environment for which he was painfully unprepared. For the first time, he was faced with classmates who were mostly well-bred and well-read young ladies from the wealthier families Elsie Fogerty had private- ly tutored and courted. They found him amusing at times (and, as Caliban, shocking), but he was poor, invariably untidy and inchned to vulgarity. More removed tlian ever from his family, Olivier was without affectionate advice (Sybille was working as a secre- tary outside London). Since tire age of nine, his main role models had been severe clergymen (and a few lay teachers who were just as stem and remote) at schools where uni- forms were worn and where there was no preparation for adult heterosexual society. No one had counseled him on grooming, dress and manners, and tliis uneven training had made him a socially unsophisticated young man alienated from the world he tried to embrace. The young Ofivier, like many who require attention, often unwittingly alienated others in his muddled attempts to win acceptance, and— feeling rejected and confused— he would quite naturally withdraw' behind “an invisible wall.” The feefing of social inferiority must have been even more poignant in light of lAXJRENCE OLIVIER X 39 his financial situation, for he had barely enough for his own meals; to invite a young lady to tea, a dance or an entertain- ment was beyond the realm of possibility. There was, then, an array of conflicts facing Olivier as he approached his eighteenth birthday, in addition to the nor- md quandaries attending that age. If it is crucial for every young adult to find approval and support, surely tliat need is trebled for an artistic personality. Forced to a lonely inde- pendence on the brink of maturity, he required and longed for the acceptance of peers and professionals — not only because he had virtually no family to turn to, but because he was a richly endowed young man, and his gifts demand- ed recognition and refinement. But just as his dress and manner were crude, without polish and in need of modifi- cation, so his aptitudes — of which he could not yet be cer- tain — were still raw. His genius, in other words, was as yet unharnessed to talent. To supplement his meager budget, Olivier scanned the the- atrical call-boards and sat on agents’ doorsteps in Charing Cross Road, hoping for a job. Occasionally his waiting obtained a modest reward. At Christmas 1924, he worked as an assistant stage manager and understudy in a children’s play. Through the Crack, at St. Christopher’s School, Letchworth; tliis job added only three or four pounds to his income. In Februaiy, he was seen briefly at the Regent, London, taking two small (and critically ignored) roles in Henry IV, Part 11 — Snare, who comes to arrest Falstaff, and Thomas, Duke of Clarence. As eager for a good part as for a hot meal that winter, he may well have envied the actor who played the zany Shallow; for his own enjoyment, Olivier memorized much of tlie role, and years later it became one of his most famous and favorite characterizations. 40 ^ DONALD SPOTO That same month, he sacrificed several meals for a cheap seat at John Barrymore’s Hamlet at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket. In retrospect, Barrymore’s performance pro- vided nourishment for years of inspiration. Banymore had exquisite diction, consummate charm and two techniques that greatly impressed Olivier. First, he seemed to select a single word from each line for emphasis, and this he uttered with a great ring of passion; the result was a rhythm of alter- nating stresses and varied volume that kept the audience bound to him. Second, there was Barrymore’s roaring ath- leticism: His Hamlet sprang to hfe with sudden leaps and unexpected, flashing gestures. At that time Shakespeare was often performed with an almost anemic languor, but Barrymore made Hamlet’s agonies credible. There were other influences. Most films shown in London were American imports (only thirty-four English films were made in 1925, compared with more tlian tiiree hundred American), and for a few pence Olivier could see which actors kept the packed movie tlieaters in rapt atten- tion. Ronald Colman, an Englishman who had recently emi- grated to Hollywood, was Lillian Gish’s choice as her costar in The White Sister. One of tlie most popular in the grand exodus of actors to America (Clive Brook, George Arliss and Victor McLaglen were others), Colman seemed the embod- iment of gentlemanly elegance. The American matinee idol Rod La Rocque (in Forbidden Paradise) appealed to botli men and women with his striking, confident sexuality. And the portrayals by Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. (in The Thief of Bagdad) and Lon Chaney (in The Phantom of the Opera) tapped and exposed for Olivier a new kind of bold carnality and presented rich varieties of costume and makeup. There was veiy much of America in the London air that year. The songs “Tea for Two,” “Indian Love Call” and “California, Here I Come” were heard all over town, and LAURENCE OLIVIER X 41 Americanisms (the bunk [meaning nonsense], sugar daddy, baloney, okay, yeah) were peppering the conversation of British youth. In July 1925, the Charleston arrived at a Soho tea dance, and Ohvier was persuaded to tiy it by a school- mate. Her name is unknown, but she was a carefree flap- per, and he found her laughter and high spirits infectious. They danced for an hour before she left on the arm of an older man. The cocktail and cabaret age had begun in London, and it was tlie era of tlie Bright Young Things. Those who could not afford to see Beatrice Lillie or Sophie Tucker at the Hotel Metropole’s “Midnight Follies” or the bands and vari- ety acts at die Piccadilly Hotel’s “Revels” found tlieir way to one of the endless theme parties. Cliques all over London seemed to be in constant rivalry for the most outrageous requirements for dress and decor: There were Wild West parties, Jungle Savage parties, Greek, Russian, Nearly Nude and Baby parties. Some of them offered cocaine (first called “snow” in London) as an alternative to cocktails, and although drugs were not illegal some of tlieir effects were, and soon morally vigilant citizens were marching to suppress rice. Olivier was exposed to it all — ^through those he met in the daily crush of postwar London life, through die pages of The Era and The Stage (which he scoured for jobs), dirough the agents and producers he hounded, and in his frugal lunches with equally penurious but more worldly apprentice actors. He still attended All Saints every Sunday, often send- ing as acolyte, and Father Mackay, observing how thin Lany^ was, wrote to Gerard; diereafter an occasional pound note from Father Olivier arrived in die miiil at Castellain Road. As his classes at die Central School concluded in mid- 1925, Olirier acted in a brief scene from Pinero’s Trelmvny of the 42 2 DONALD SPOTO ‘WeEs/’ Peggy Ashcroft remembered suddenly sitting up as if seeing him for die first time and saying to herself, “My good- ness, he can act!” For all his roughness, he was dynamic. Olivier and Ashcroft were (to no one’s astonisliment) awarded die Dawson Milward Cup, a school prize named for a popular actor of the day. This was given for dieir acliievemenls in gen- eral, but particularly for an absurdly amateurish comic piece called Mr. and Mrs. Inkpen, of which bodi actors were slighdy ashamed. Late tiiat summer and autumn, Olivier was engaged by manager Julian Frank to appear in The Unfailing Instinct, a music-hall curtain raiser with the actress Ruby Miller. (The teenage character’s name, Armand St. Cyr, w^as more impressive than his role, as a fan who discovers that his great idol is his mother.) After four weeks on tour widi this trifle in Manchester, Liverpool and Brighton, Olivier’s salary of two pounds was slightly augmented when he was asked to be assistant stage manager and play the silent policeman in a melodrama. The Ghost Train, in which Miller had scored a great success in London. No such suc- cess was Olivier’s: The Brighton drama correspondent alluded to him only to note his unintentionally dramatic entry onstage. Heedless of the stage manager’s warning about the set’s raised door sill, Olivier reduced a tense scene to giddy farce as he tripped, sliding precariously toward the footlights. He fared no better in his next employment, although there was a different reason for both the hilarity and the brevity of his tenure. In October, Olivier secured a position in a modest repertory company managed by Lena Ashwell, another of die stalwart ladies of the British stage. Like Elsie Fogerty, she was both maternal and encouraging to him — and, as it happened, she was eventually less patient. The relationship widi the Ashwell Players began auspi- lAURENCE OLIVIER 43 ciously. Ashwell, then fifty-three, told Ohvier that she, too, had lost her mother very young, and her fatlier had turned to die ministry late. She had first appeared onstage in 1891, and four years later she triumphed as Elaine to Henry Irving’s King Arthur. The theater soon became a mission for her, and during World War I, she organized twenty-five acting companies to entertain troops. Thereafter, she estab- lished the Once-a-Week Players to provide good cheap entertainment in various town halls at home, and in 1924 she acquired the Bijou Theatre, Bayswater, and renamed it the Century (Olivier’s performance in Byron, with the Lyceum Club Stage Society, had taken place here). In addi- tion, she took her casts nightly to play for the poor in vari- ous settlement houses, pubhc baths, piers and town halls, in places like Battersea, Ilford, Deptford and Camberwell. Olivier was impressed by Ashwell’s commitment to the die- ater, but not by die excessive fingality of her productions. For a stage, boards were shunted over swimming pools; torches were hastily stmng round an ancient, unelectiified school haU; and players were asked to assume multiple roles in the same play. Evidendy he could no longer take the enterprise seriously when he had to double as Flavius and Antony in Julius Caesar before a crowd of schoolboys. Anodier player’s trousers fell to the stage from beneadi his costume, and Olivier — ^freely join- ing die audience in a fit of unsuppressed laughter — ^simply quit die scene. Next day, die unamused Lena AshweU summoned lini and insisted that he also quit die company. t remains unclear how the renewal of their acquaintance ^^^^’^ber 1925 Olivier was working with y omdike and her husband Lewis Casson, who with manager Bronson Albery were producing plays at the mpire eatre, Leicester Square. For three pounds a 44 ^ DONALD SPOTO week, he was a servant in Shakespeare's Henry VIII, and Carol Reed — ^later famous as the director of such films as The Third Man and Oliver ! — was his cohort in holding Thorndike’s heavy robe for her role as Queen Katlierine. Offstage, the two young men were rivals for the attention of the production’s Anne Boleyn, Angela Baddeley, who was quite happily married and ignored the infatuated young actors. “They used to quarrel like mad [over Angela],” according to Thorndike. “I had to say, ‘You shut up, you two, and attend to what you’re doing.’” Onstage, Olivier generally attended to his responsibili- ties, despite an occasional fit of amateurish laughter at something like a missed cue or at what he considered an absurd line. Offstage was another matter. As assistant stage manager (of the same plays in which he took small roles), he once rang down the curtain a full minute before time, and he shocked Bronson Albery (whom he did not recog- nize) by asking him to keep silent during a rehearsal. The impossible infatuations, the onstage giggling, the sloppiness at duties that bored him — all were signs of a protracted adolescence, causing some colleagues to doubt tlie serious- ness qf his professional goals. Sybil Thorndike, for one, thought he was too casual tliat season. But she and her husband Lewis (who were like parents to him) continued their kindly patronage, and in March 1926 Olivier played Orsino’s servant — one brief appearance witli twenty-seven words— in tlieir revival of Shelley’s The Cencl He was glad of the money, but the roles were still unchal- lenging and life, as he approached his nineteendi birthday, seemed drearily static. Writing to Dickie in India, he clairned to be very near to abandoning tlie dieater and tak- ing me voyage out. CHAPTER THREE 1927-1930 Let schoolmasters puzzle their hrain With grammar and nonsense and learning Good liquor, I stoutly maintain. Gives genius a better discerning. — ^Tony Lumpldn, in Goldsmith, She Stoops to Conquer O UTSIDE London — most notably in Liverpool, Stratford, Manchester and Birmingham — the repertory system flourished in England even before World War I. Repertory companies offered one play on Monday, another on Tuesday, a third on Wednesday and sometimes even a fourth or fifth thereafter, and actors appearing in one were usually rehearsing a second and learning lines for a third. Repertory theater was a superb training ground, exercising a player’s memory and extend- ing Iiis range; appearing witli established actors, an appren- tice quickly learned both classical roles and parts in new plays. Barry Jackson, the wealthy heir to the Maypole Dairies, had directed an amateur company called the Pilgrim Players before opening the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in February 1913. Jackson personally supervised tire design of die company’ s building, insisting on an intimate auditori- um with no seat more than seventy feet from the stage; in addition to revivals of standard classics, he subsidized pro- 45 46 X DONALD SPOTO ductions of the works of new and controversial playwrights. His stated aim was to enlarge and increase the aesthetic sense of the public. . . to give living authors an opportunity of seeing their works performed, and to learn something from the revival of the classics; in short, to serve an art instead of making tliat art serve a commercial purpose. George Bernard Shaw, whose mammoth, five-part Back to Methuselah had its premiere (spanning a whole week) at Birmingham, benefited from Jackson’s ideahsm, calling the Repertory Theatre a place where “all genuine artists have found themselves happily at home,” and plays opening there often continued in London and beyond (among them, Besier’s The Barretts ofWimpole Street). Early Birmingham players who went on to substantial careers included Felix Aylmer, Leslie Banks, Gwen Ffranggon-Davies and Cedric Hardwicke. Noel Coward appeared there briefly in 1919, and among the Birmingham alumni were Peggy Ashcroft, Edith Evans, Ralph Richardson and Laurence Olivier, who was received into the company during its London season at the Kingsway Theatre in spring 1926. Although Ohvier’s first role was a small one, it guaran- teed a month s wages (at six pounds ten shillings per week) and the promise of more parts to come. As a minstrel in The Marvellous History of Saint Bernard, Henri Gheon and Barry Jackson s reworking of a religious mystery play, Olivier made liis first appearance on April 7. He was duly impressed by the expense Jackson had obviously incurred or the elaborate set representing a tripartite heaven-earth- iell~tlie effect was like a page from a medieval illuminated book of hours. Gwen Ffranggon-Davies, who played a bride abandoned LAURENCE OLIVIER X 47 by her pious fiance, remembered that there was nothing sensational about Ohvier’s presence or performance, and actor Denys Blakelock retained a clear memory of an undis- tinguished-looking young man with bad teeth, eyebrows that grew thickly into a straight Une and a thatch of unman- ageable hair. Blakelock also recalled that Olivier could be surprisingly candid. Once, as they sat in a restaurant called the Cabin in the Strand, Blakelock had his hands spread out on the table. Olivier looked down at them and said, “Funny stumpy little hands, aren’t they?” Also in the cast was a young actress named Muriel Hewitt, for whom Olivier developed a romantic fixation that was doomed to be unre- quited. Like Angela Baddeley, she was also married and immune to his idolatry. The run of Saint Bernard was interrupted in early May by the General Strike, the worst of over three hundred labor disputes afflicting Britain that year. In support of the coal miners’ grievances, virtually every union struck on May 4. London’s trams, buses, the underground and other essential services were manned by volunteers and guarded by the police, and Olivier worked as a tube (subway) conductor on the Circle Line for the nine days of tlie strike, which won no concession for the beleaguered miners. Forever after, he remembered tliis brief work only as a bit of a lark. Saint Bernard closed on June 12, but by this time OHvier had rehearsed for a small role in D. T. Davies’s The Barber and the Cow, a pallid Welsh comedy about a local barber, a comatose animal and rural elections; it has been justly ignored since shortly after its premiere in Clacton-on-Sea. Ralph Richardson, who was married to Muriel Hewitt, had a leading role; he, too, would fare infinitely better in com- ing years. 48 DONALD SPOTO Bom in 1902 in Cheltenham, Richardson had been acting with amateur companies since 1921. He and his wife (nick- named Kit) joined the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in 1924, and soon after he went on tour with Eden Phillpotts’s popular and lucrative country comedy The Farmer’s Wife. By summer 1926 he hoped for a major London debut, and his rivalry' with Olivier for some of the same roles was aggravated by the latter’s open adoration of Kit. Richardson judged his colleague “a cocl^ young pup full of fire and energy,” and in turn Olivier thought him stuffy and pretentious. One day during the summer tour of Barber, Richardson and his wife offered to bring Olivier with them from Clacton to Bridlington. Driving his new Morris Cowley on a particularly warm day, Richardson noticed the radiator gauge approaching the boil. While Olivier and Kit chatted gaily, he stopped to inspect the car’s innards. As steam hissed around him, Richardson saw Olivier approaching. “I want to ask you something, Ralph,” he said portentously. “What tlie devil is it, Larry?” ‘Would you mind — would you — ^if I called Muriel ‘Kit’?” Fastidious about using a diminutive, Olivier could how- ever be annoyingly reckless at die wheel, as was soon clear to Richardson — himself no timid soul: In his eighties he was still wildly driving a motorcycle in London traffic. Driving to Brighton several months later, Olivier approached a dan- gerous crossroad without a traffic signal. Instead of slowing, he increased to fifty miles an hour and without any concern for danger sped across the intersection. “Laurence,” Richardson said deliberately, “never — never — as long as I live, will I forgive you for that.” But the driver was jaunty: It is a well-known thing, Ralphie, that when you get to a _point of danger, get over it as quick as you can.” The tour of LAURENCE OLIVIER X 49 Barber continued into autumn, when Olivier was cast as Richard Coaker, tlie lovesick country lad in The Farmer’s Wife (tlie role had earher been Richardson’s). After several weeks playing the role in Brighton and elsewhere, Olivier made his debut in Birmingham in December, Throughout 1927, his circumstances remained frugal, for hke the rest of tire company he was paid only six pounds a week and could afford only a modest room in a boardinghouse. In the evenings and on some afternoons, Olivier per- formed on the steeply raked stage of Jackson’s Station Street Theatre, where he was seen in more tlran a dozen roles that year. “The versatihty I wished to dazzle people with was being gradually developed all the time,” he recalled later. “I didn’t want to be recognized from one week to tire next.” Often he was not. From a nonspeaking cameo to the title role in a classic play, Olivier was employing a diversity of styles, accents, costumes and makeup. But his irrepressible sense of fun still occasionally endan- gered his career. In January, for example, he took the role of a wealtlry young man (widr a monocle and an Oxbridge accent) in Eden Phillpotts’s Something to Talk About, a one-act comedy about -a thief who breaks into a manor house early on Christmas morning. As the polished son, Olivier enjoyed himself immensely and could not resist an interpolation. To the intruder’s angry, ‘'Who are you?” he was to say, “We are Conservatives!” But that did not sound funny enough to him, and instead he replied, “We’re Freemasons, Frotliblowers and Gugnuncs!” The director, W. G. Fay, was furious and demanded Ohvier’s dismissal, but Jackson let him off witli a gentle lecture on professional decorum. Olivier’s behavior improved markedly for the remaining winter roles: a simpleton in Synge’s religious fan- tasy The Well of the S"
