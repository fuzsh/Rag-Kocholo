        "text": "In 1971 the National theatre was staging seasons at two London theatres and, without a big success in either, was losing money on a dramatic scale. It became clear that there was only one way of ensuring box office viability: putting Laurence Olivier back on stage. Approaching 65 and the survivor of two major illnesses, it was probably the last place on earth he wanted to be, particularly in a role substantial enough to draw the public. On the other hand the reputation of his regime, of himself as the first artistic director of the National theatre, was at stake. He was still ambitious enough to know he had no choice.\n\nThere was a play that Kenneth Tynan had long championed as a vehicle for Larry, Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night, but the actor had always resisted. Ken brought it to the table again. It would be a new direction for him, one of the great parts from the American canon. Besides, the show would be inexpensive and it would be possible to arrange a straight run of two or three months. With luck we could clean up at the box office and balance our books.\n\nThese were all compelling arguments, except perhaps for the man who had to learn one of the longest parts in world drama, then spend four or five hours, six nights a week, performing it. Ken and I were sitting with him in his office when he agreed to take the part. It was a sober moment because we were aware of what we were asking of him. Then he turned to me and without much enthusiasm said, \"And would you like to direct it?\"\n\nAt 64 he was a few months away from the exact age of his character, James Tyrone, and learning lines and retaining them often becomes a problem for older actors. In his case this was complicated by a crisis of confidence that had come out of nowhere during a run of Othello. He was now the most famous stage actor in the world and he suddenly buckled under the weight of expectation that this reputation had placed on him. The first reading of the O'Neill was decidedly uneasy. We were all nervous and Olivier, like the rest of the cast, was a long way from the performance he would eventually give. After the reading Denis Quilley, who was playing the wayward son Jamie, said to me, with concern rather than criticism, \"Sir's American accent is a bit all-over-the-place, isn't it?\" I think we were all a little taken aback by the clumsiness of his reading. He was like a man in a straitjacket vigorously trying to punch his way free. This was unusual. His reputation was for coming to rehearsals knowing exactly what he wanted to do.\n\nAt no stage during the rehearsal period did he ever make me feel challenged, because notwithstanding his unpredictability, his eccentric misjudgments, his occasional spitefulness, in important matters he had a grounded sense of the common good. In his eyes I was the director and should be treated as such. This capacity to keep in his mind the larger picture would become most evident in the way he responded to the shabby manoeuvres surrounding his departure from the National, and which even as we were busy rehearsing, were already advanced. He was to feel monstrously betrayed, was to lose his health and almost his life, but nevertheless desisted from ever going public with his side of the story. The future of the National theatre was more important that the mistreatment of any one individual. It was enough that he had been the key figure in bringing the National into being. Now it was the turn of others to take on what had become for him an almost impossible job. Let them get on with it.\n\nOnce rehearsals were under way, he would arrive each day with some new detail to embellish his performance. His accent was now splendidly judged, a resonant American but still Irish around the edges. One morning he turned up with a period haircut, short back and sides with a slightly off-centre parting. \"HL Mencken?\" I asked, recalling an old photograph, and he smiled enigmatically.\n\nYet his work on the script was still in miniature, an organised expression of teeming thoughts and impulses with his voice barely raised and his eyes on the text. Once an audience was present he would add to it the thrilling power of his voice ringing around the auditorium, and a thousand people would hold their breath. It would be amazing. And it seemed brutally cruel that such a gift enriched over a lifetime should now be threatened by something as mundane as a little trouble remembering.\n\nBy the last week of rehearsals the performances were in place and only waited on the presence of an audience. Larry now had a grip on his lines, but still obsessively ran those parts of the play about which he felt unsure, particularly in the mammoth fourth act. Watching him, I had to remain completely still, since if I made the slightest movement - shifted in my seat or crossed my legs - it would deflect his attention, the lines would go and he would shout for a prompt. The fact that he had now achieved his performance, that rehearsals had gone supremely well, that the word was already out that the National was about to return to form, didn't seem to comfort him at all.\n\nLate one afternoon I took the company to the Donmar Warehouse, not yet a theatre but simply a large, bare rehearsal space, where we had assembled the set. We decided to run the beginning of the play, which opened with, off stage, the distant voices of the family as they conclude breakfast in the dining room. The cast took up their places just out of sight. \"Curtain up,\" I said in the tactful and encouraging tone employed by movie directors when they say \"Action\". Larry and Constance Cummings, playing his wife Mary Tyrone, made their entrance from the dining room and launched into their first scene of marital affection. It swung nicely through two or three exchanges and then abruptly stopped. Larry had dried. \"What's the line?!\" he asked, with subdued but unmistakable agitation. I quickly intervened - \"No, let's go back to the top and make a fresh start.\" This time my \"Curtain up\" was so tactful as to be barely audible. The scene began with fresh vigour and then at exactly the same spot came to a halt. I asked the stage manager, who was on the book, to show Sir Laurence exactly where on the page he had tripped up. We started again, and again the play dropped into a pit of silence. We were 45 seconds into a four-hour plus evening and there wasn't a face in the room that wasn't frozen with concern an unthinkable possibility had reared up in all our minds. Larry made two more attempts and failed at both. After the last one he looked at me with a weak, grey smile and said, \"That's funny, I've got stage fright.\"\n\nTechnical dress rehearsals are usually tedious, but a little tedium was exactly what the company now required. It looked as if Larry had recovered his nerve, and he got through his first scene with little help from the prompter. I hoped the moment of nightmare was behind us. Nevertheless, I felt I had to have a private word with the other three principals: \"I know you're all very concerned about Larry. So am I. That incident at the Donmar was very alarming for all of us and I know you want to offer him all the support you can. But the truth of the matter is the only person who can help Larry is Larry himself. He knows it, and so should you. You can't remember his lines for him or take on any of his fears. So what I strongly advise is this. Attend to your own performances. Protect your own territory. Because my hunch is that he's going to be all right. More than all right. His anxieties at the moment are absolutely genuine but what he's doing, even if he's not aware of it, is digging himself into a hole out of which on the first night he'll rise up like a rocket. And if you're not careful you'll be left behind on the sidelines with your mouths open. So first and foremost attend to your own work.\" This appeal to enlightened self-interest was the best note I could have given them, because, of course, on the first night that's exactly what happened.\n\nBefore the curtain rose the sense of expectation and goodwill in the auditorium were palpable. Would there be two things to celebrate that night - a return to form for the National theatre, and, back on stage in a major role, notwithstanding severe illness and advancing years, the most remarkable English actor of the age, successor to Garrick, Kean and Irving? Everyone present knew this promised to be a true occasion and they felt lucky to be there.\n\nAs soon as I heard the first words of the play spoken I was sure that we were safe and that the cast were in command of the evening. At the first interval I'd been bidden to go to a small room off the dress circle where drinks were being served for members of the theatre board. The atmosphere in the room was excited yet subdued. Such a spectacular recovery on the part of the National theatre under its present artistic director seemed to have thrown the board members off balance. The new chairman was there, the property tycoon Sir Max Rayne, and I was also introduced to Lord Goodman, the great mover and shaker of London's cultural scene. He offered me a murmur of praise that was more like an apology. What I didn't know then was that these two men, without any discussion with Olivier, had already put in place his successor, Peter Hall.\n\nIt was a curious echo of the way Olivier had been treated when he was running the Old Vic in the 40s and was peremptorily fired by telegram while touring the company's work in Australia. Why were people so often reluctant to confront him face to face, this unsettling figure who could attend a Board meeting in a grey suit in the afternoon, and then in the evening paint his face and cast spells over a thousand people?\n\nOn stage the performances simply got better and better. Larry rose to the fourth act like a great wave gathering and for everyone present there was no place on earth we would have preferred to be than in this theatre on this particular night. Then suddenly the two actors on whom we were transfixed had stopped speaking. They sat in their chairs, mouths slightly ajar, staring at each other as in a photograph. Three and a half hours into the play Larry had caught sight of one of his small children watching him from a box, and his concentration had wavered. The audience realised at once what had happened: that the great actor had forgotten a line. But instead of an embarrassed silence, there arose from the house a rumble of understanding in which there was both goodwill and amusement. It was the most generous sound I have ever heard an audience make. Eventually Ronnie Pickup, playing his son, found something to say to put the play back on track, and the rest of the show moved with the purpose of an arrow to its conclusion. In that hard-won beat of silence that separated the descent of the curtain from the avalanche of applause that followed, I knew we had scored an absolute bullseye.\n\nI went backstage to greet the cast. In this same building almost 30 years before Olivier had given his Richard III and his Oedipus Rex. Now he was back with a matching triumph. The star dressing rooms were on stage level and to reach them I had to descend a steep flight of concrete steps at the bottom of which there were two doors, one to the left and one to the right. I had just arrived at the last step when, as in a farce, Larry and Connie emerged simultaneously from their dressing rooms. We stared at each other, grinning and surprised, but no one spoke. Instead, like children who have just got away with a hoard of stolen fruit, we all began to giggle.\n\n\"Can you smell it!?\" said Larry, rubbing the tips of his fingers together.\n\n\"What?\" we asked.\n\n\"Success!!\" he whispered.\n\nAnd he was right, it flooded the building."
