        "text": "Lives of movie and television actors exert almost as much fascination as the films and shows they appear in. Fans want to know their favorites better and get a peek at the real life drama behind the scenes. Even though stars seem to live their lives in public, putting together a biography is not easy. In the old days the studios would use publicity to craft a public image for their players, an image frequently as much a work of fiction as any movie role. Biographers of more recent stars have the opposite problem: a glut of information to sort through and evaluate. It is up to the biographer to find the truth and shape the story of a life.\n\nThis minibibliography consists of biographies that were added to the NLS collection after 2001. The range stretches from early Hollywood stars Lillian Gish and Rudolph Valentino to current television names Teri Hatcher and Brooke Shields. The long careers of Bette Davis, Lauren Bacall, and Gregory Peck form a history of life at the top in Hollywood, while biographies of Hattie McDaniel, Lincoln Perry, and Sidney Poitier show their struggles and illustrate the less pleasant aspects of the movie industry. There are also books that cover the theater careers of Carol Channing, Tallulah Bankhead, and the Lunts.\n\nSome prefer to tell their own story. Tab Hunter dropped out of Hollywood and many years later wrote about the difficulty of maintaining his false image as the boy next door. Others share inspirational experiences. Kirk Douglas wrote about his recovery from a stroke and Teri Garr explained that having multiple sclerosis doesnâ€™t keep her from living her life and maintaining her career. Brooke Shields shared the details of her struggle with postpartum depression. Christopher Reeve wrote about the importance of not taking life for granted.\n\nMore titles can be found by searching the NLS catalog under the following subject headings: Motion Picture Actors and Actresses, Actors, and Actresses."
