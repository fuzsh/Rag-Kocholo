        "text": "I recommend my own books - Directing Actors and The Film Director's Intuition - for filmmakers, screenwriters, and actors. And here are a few other books that directors and actors might find helpful.\n\nBooks by Directors\n\nMAKING MOVIES, by Sidney Lumet\n\nCASSAVETES ON CASSAVETES, Ray Carney, editor\n\nKIESLOWSKI ON KIESLOWSKI, Danusia Stok, editor\n\nKAZAN ON DIRECTING, by Elia Kazan, Martin Scorsese, John Lahr\n\nON DIRECTING FILM, by David Mamet\n\nMOVIEMAKERS’ MASTER CLASS, by Laurent Tirard\n\nI’LL BE IN MY TRAILER, and ON DIRECTING, by John Badham\n\nBooks by other Acting Teachers\n\nON ACTING, by Sanford Meisner\n\nTHE ART OF ACTING, by Stella Adler\n\nA DREAM OF PASSION, by Lee Strasberg\n\nRESPECT FOR ACTING, by Uta Hagen\n\nTHE INTENT TO LIVE, by Larry Moss\n\nTHE POWER OF THE ACTOR, by Ivana Chubbuck\n\nHOW TO STOP ACTING, by Harold Guskin\n\nA PRACTICAL HANDBOOK FOR THE ACTOR, by Bruder, et al\n\nAUDITION, by Michael Shurtleff\n\nIMPRO, by Keith Johnstone\n\nMY LIFE IN ART, by Constantin Stanislavski\n\nAN ACTOR PREPARES, by Constantin Stanislavski\n\nThen, please consider that the history of theater is also the history of film. Acquaint yourself with that legacy, by reading plays, including the following:\n\n20th Century American Classics—The Big Five\n\nEdward Albee: WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?; THE ZOO STORY\n\nArthur Miller: DEATH OF A SALESMAN\n\nEugene O'Neill: LONG DAY'S JOURNEY INTO NIGHT; THE ICEMAN COMETH\n\nTennessee Williams: THE GLASS MENAGERIE, STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE\n\nAugust Wilson: FENCES, JOE TURNER'S COME AND GONE\n\nMore 20th Century American Classics\n\nHorton Foote: start with SELECTED ONE-ACT PLAYS\n\nJohn Guare: THE HOUSE OF BLUE LEAVES, SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION\n\nLorraine Hansberry: RAISIN IN THE SUN\n\nBeth Henley: CRIMES OF THE HEART\n\nLillian Hellman: THE CHILDREN'S HOUR; THE LITTLE FOXES\n\nMaria Irene Fornés: FEFU AND HER FRIENDS\n\nWilliam Inge: DARK AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS; BUS STOP; PICNIC\n\nTony Kushnuer: ANGELS IN AMERICA\n\nDavid Mamet: AMERICAN BUFFALO, GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS\n\nClifford Odets: AWAKE AND SING, COUNTRY GIRL, GOLDEN BOY\n\nJohn Patrick Shanley: DANNY AND THE DEEP BLUE SEA\n\nSam Shepard: FOOL FOR LOVE, TRUE WEST, BURIED CHILD, CURSE OF THE STARVING CLASS\n\nNeil Simon: ODD COUPLE, SUNSHINE BOYS\n\nThornton Wilder: OUR TOWN; THE SKIN OF OUR TEETH\n\n20th Century European Classics\n\nSamuel Beckett: WAITING FOR GODOT\n\nBertolt Brecht: MOTHER COURAGE\n\nAnton Chekhov: UNCLE VANYA, THE SEAGULL, THE CHERRY ORCHARD, THE THREE SISTERS\n\nNoel Coward: PRIVATE LIVES, BLYTHE SPIRIT\n\nJean Genet: THE MAIDS\n\nHenrik Ibsen: HEDDA GABLER, A DOLL’S HOUSE\n\nEugene Ionesco: RHINOSCEROS\n\nFrederico Garcia Lorca: THE HOUSE OF BERNARDA ALBA\n\nMartin McDonagh: BEAUTY QUEEN OF LEENANE, THE PILLOWMAN\n\nHarold Pinter: BETRAYAL, THE HOMECOMING, DUMB WAITER, CARETAKER\n\nSean O’Casey: PLAYBOY OF THE WESTERN WORLD\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw: MAN AND SUPERMAN\n\nAugust Strindberg: MISS JULIE\n\nTom Stoppard: ROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN ARE DEAD\n\nJohn Millington Synge: RIDERS TO THE SEA\n\nOscar Wilde: THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST\n\nPre-20th Century\n\nSHAKESPEARE: Don't be intimidated by Shakespeare; he is very modern, very down-to-earth, and the most cinematic of all playwrights. HAMLET is crucial; if you don't feel up to reading HAMLET, there are a number of film adaptations; the one that feels to me the most modern and relatable is the one directed by Franco Zeffirelli, with Mel Gibson. The most modern version of ROMEO AND JULIET is Baz Luhrman's ROMEO + JULIET, with Clare Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio. Kenneth Branaugh's versions of HENRY V and MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING feel modern and relatable. There are at least two very approachable versions of RICHARD III, one starring Laurence Olivier, one starring Ian McKellen. For a very real and terrifying MACBETH, check the film version by Roman Polanski.\n\nGREEK DRAMA: THE TROJAN WOMEN, by Euripides, usually feels the most modern, the most emotional to most people."
