        "text": "Café racer\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\n(Redirected from Cafe racer)\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nTriton: Triumph engine and Norton Featherbed frame\n\nA café racer (/ˈkæf reɪsər/ KAF-ray-sər or less commonly /ˈkæfi ˌreɪsər/ KA-fi-RAY-sər) is a light-weight, lightly-powered motorcycle optimized for speed and handling rather than comfort — and optimized for quick rides over short distances.[1][2] With bodywork and control layout recalling early 1960's Grand Prix road racing motorcycles, café racers are noted for their low slung racing handlebars, prominent seat cowling and elongated fuel tanks, often with indentations to allow the rider's knees to grip the tank.[3]\n\nThe term itself developed among British motorcycle enthusiasts of the early 1960s, specifically the Rocker or \"Ton-Up Boys\" subculture where the bikes were used for short, quick rides between cafés — in other words, drinking establishments.[4][3][5][6]\n\nIn 1973, US freelance writer Wallace Wyss, contributing to Popular Mechanics magazine, wrote that the term café racer was originally used derogatorily in Europe to describe a \"motorcyclist who played at being an Isle of Man road racer\" and was in fact \"someone who owned a racy machine but merely parked it near his table at the local outdoor cafe.\"[7]\n\nIn 2014, journalist Ben Stewart described the café racer as a \"look made popular when European kids stripped down their small-displacement bikes to zip from one café hangout to another.\"[8]\n\nContents [hide]\n\n1 Typical configuration\n\n2 Evolution\n\n3 Subculture\n\n4 See also\n\n5 References\n\n6 Further reading\n\n7 External links\n\nTypical configuration[edit]\n\n1962 racing motorcycle AJS 7R 350cc, on display at Gruber Museum in Weiler im Allgäu, Bavaria, Germany\n\nBSA Goldstar 500 café racer\n\nIn addition to its characteristic light-weight and lightly-powered engine and distinctive bodywork, the café racer typically featured distinctive ergonomics.\n\nLow, narrow handlebars — known as clip-ons (two separate bars that bolt directly to each fork tube), clubman or ace bars (one piece bars that attach to the standard mounting location but drop down and forward)[4] — enabled the rider to \"tuck in\", reducing wind resistance and improving control. Along with rearward located seat, the posture often required rearsets, or rear-set footrests and foot controls, again typical of racing motorcycles of the era.[9] Distinctive half or full race-style fairings were sometimes mounted to the forks or frame.[7]\n\nThe bikes featured minimalist styling, engines tuned for maximum speed and light road handling. A well-known example was \"The Triton\", a homemade combination of Norton Featherbed frame and Triumph Bonneville engine. It used a common and fast racing engine combined with a well-handling frame, the Featherbed frame by Norton Motorcycles.[9] Those with less money could opt for a \"Tribsa\"—the Triumph engine in a BSA frame. Other combinations such as the \"Norvin\" (a Vincent V-Twin engine in a Featherbed frame) and racing frames by Rickman or Seeley were also adopted for road use.[10]\n\nEvolution[edit]\n\n1977 Harley-Davidson XLCR\n\nCafé racer styling evolved throughout the time of their popularity. By the mid-1970s, Japanese bikes had overtaken British bikes in the marketplace, and the look of real Grand Prix racing bikes had changed. The hand-made, frequently unpainted aluminium racing fuel tanks of the 1960s had evolved into square, narrow, fibreglass tanks. Increasingly, three-cylinder Kawasaki two-strokes, four-cylinder four-stroke Kawasaki Z1, and four-cylinder Hondas were the basis for café racer conversions. By 1977, a number of manufacturers had taken notice of the café racer boom and were producing factory café racers, such as the well-received Moto Guzzi Le Mans[11] and the unpopular but unforgettable Harley-Davidson XLCR.[12][13][14] A Japanese thumper introduced in the late 1980s (to disappointing sales) the Honda GB500 'Tourist Trophy' emulated British café racers of the 1960s.[15]\n\nIn the mid-1970s, riders continued to modify standard production motorcycles into so-called \"café racers\" by simply equipping them with clubman bars and a small fairing around the headlight. A number of European manufacturers, including Benelli, BMW, Bultaco and Derbi produced factory \"café\" variants of their standard motorcycles in this manner,[16] without any modifications made to make them faster or more powerful,[17] a trend that continues today.[18][19]\n\nSubculture[edit]\n\n1960s Rockers under canopy outside Busy Bee Café, Watford, England, UK.\n\nSuzuki S40 customised in a café racer style[20][21]\n\nHonda CB 400 Four café racer\n\nRockers were a young and rebellious rock and roll counterculture[22] who wanted a fast, personalised and distinctive bike to travel between transport cafés along the newly built arterial motorways in and around British towns and cities.[23][24][25] Biker lore has it that the goal of many was to be able to reach 100 miles per hour (160 km/h)—called simply \"the ton\"—along such a route where the rider would leave from a café, race to a predetermined point and back to the café before a single song could play on the jukebox, called record-racing. But author Mike Seate contends that record-racing is a myth, the story having originated in an episode of the BBC Dixon of Dock Green television show.[26] Café racers are remembered as being especially fond of rockabilly music and their image is now embedded in today's rockabilly culture.[27][28]\n\nThe sub-culture continues to evolve with modern café racers taking style elements of the American Greaser, the British Rocker and modern motorcycle rider to create an global style all their own.[8][29] Google Trends shows that, since 2010, the number of searches for the term 'cafe racer' has increased by approximately a factor of three relative to the total number of Google searches.[30]\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n59 Club\n\nAce Cafe London\n\nOutline of motorcycles and motorcycling\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n1.Jump up ^ The Listener (British Broadcasting Corporation) 85: p.373. 1971.\n\n2.Jump up ^ James Adam Bolton (November–December 2010). \"Moto Guzzi T3 Special\".

July 1967 to:\n\nMr. Bruce Calder,\n\n62, St. Nicholas Road,\n\nPlumstead,\n\nLondon S.E.18.\n\nThe message on the divided back of the card was as follows:\n\n\"Dear Bruce,\n\nHaving a very nice\n\ntime, and keeping\n\na promise.\n\nSee you soon,\n\nUncle Ted\".\n\nVivien Leigh\n\nSo what else happened on the day that Uncle Ted posted the card?\n\nWell, the 8th. July 1967 was not a good day for Vivien Leigh, because she died on that day.\n\nVivien Leigh was a British stage and film actress. She won two Academy Awards for Best Actress, for her definitive performances as Scarlett O'Hara in 'Gone with the Wind' (1939), and Blanche DuBois in the film version of 'A Streetcar Named Desire' (1951), a role she had also played on stage in London's West End in 1949.\n\nVivien also won a Tony Award for her work in the Broadway musical version of 'Tovarich' (1963).\n\nAfter completing her drama school education, Leigh appeared in small roles in four films in 1935 and progressed to the role of heroine in 'Fire Over England' (1937). Lauded for her beauty, Leigh felt that her physical attributes sometimes prevented her from being taken seriously as an actress.\n\nDespite her fame as a screen actress, Leigh was primarily a stage performer. During her 30-year career, she played roles ranging from the heroines of Noël Coward and George Bernard Shaw comedies to classic Shakespearean characters such as Ophelia, Cleopatra, Juliet, and Lady Macbeth.\n\nAt the time, the public strongly identified Leigh with her second husband, Laurence Olivier, who was her spouse from 1940 to 1960. Leigh and Olivier starred together in many stage productions, with Olivier often directing, and in three films.\n\nVivien earned a reputation for being difficult to work with, and for much of her adult life she had bipolar disorder, as well as recurrent bouts of chronic tuberculosis, which was first diagnosed in the mid-1940's, and which ultimately took her life at the young age of 53.\n\nAlthough her career had periods of inactivity, in 1999 the American Film Institute ranked Leigh as the 16th. greatest female movie star of classic Hollywood cinema.\n\nVivien Leigh - The Early Years\n\nVivien was born Vivian Mary Hartley on the 5th. November 1913 in British India on the campus of St. Paul's School in Darjeeling. She was the only child of Ernest Richard Hartley, a British broker, and his wife, Gertrude Mary Frances (née Yackjee).\n\nAt the age of three, Vivian made her first stage appearance for her mother's amateur theatre group, reciting 'Little Bo Peep'.\n\nAt the age of six, Vivian was sent by her mother from Loreto Convent, Darjeeling, to the Convent of the Sacred Heart, at the time situated in Roehampton, southwest London. One of her friends there was the future actress Maureen O'Sullivan, two years her senior, to whom Vivian expressed her desire to become 'A great actress'.\n\nShe was removed from the school by her father, and travelling with her parents for four years in Europe, she became fluent in both French and Italian. The family returned to Great Britain in 1931.\n\nShe went to see 'A Connecticut Yankee', one of O'Sullivan's films playing in London's West End, and told her parents of her ambitions to become an actress. Shortly after, her father enrolled Vivian at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London.\n\nVivian met Leigh Holman, a barrister 13 years her senior, in 1931. Despite his disapproval of 'theatrical people', they married on the 20th. December 1932, and she terminated her studies at RADA, her attendance and interest in acting having already waned after meeting Holman.\n\nOn the 12th. October 1933 in London, she gave birth to a daughter, Suzanne, later Mrs. Robin Farrington.\n\n1935 - 1936: Vivien Leigh's Early Acting Career\n\nLeigh's friends suggested she take a small role as a schoolgirl in the film 'Things Are Looking Up', which was her film debut, albeit uncredited as an extra. She engaged an agent, John Gliddon, who believed that 'Vivian Holman' was not a suitable name for an actress.\n\nAfter rejecting his many suggestions, she took 'Vivian Leigh' as her professional name. Gliddon recommended her to Alexander Korda as a possible film actress, but Korda rejected her as lacking potential.\n\nShe was cast in the play 'The Mask of Virtue', directed by Sidney Carroll in 1935, and received excellent reviews, followed by interviews and newspaper articles.\n\nOne such article was from the Daily Express, in which the interviewer noted:\n\n'A lightning change\n\ncame over her face'.\n\nThis was the first public mention of the rapid changes in mood which had become characteristic of her.\n\nJohn Betjeman, the future poet laureate, described her as 'The essence of English girlhood'. Korda attended her opening night performance, admitted his error, and signed her to a film contract.\n\nShe continued with the play but, when Korda moved it to a larger theatre, Leigh was found to be unable to project her voice adequately or to hold the attention of so large an audience, and the play closed soon after. In the playbill, Carroll had revised the spelling of her first name to 'Vivien'.\n\nIn 1960, Leigh recalled her ambivalence towards her first experience of critical acclaim and sudden fame, commenting:\n\n\"Some critics saw fit to be as foolish as to\n\nsay that I was a great actress. And I thought,\n\nthat was a foolish, wicked thing to say,\n\nbecause it put such an onus and such a\n\nresponsibility onto me, which I simply wasn't\n\nable to carry.\n\nAnd it took me years to learn enough to live\n\nup to what they said for those first notices.\n\nI find it so stupid. I remember the critic very\n\nwell and have never forgiven him\".\n\nIn the autumn of 1935 and at Leigh's insistence, John Buckmaster introduced her to Laurence Olivier at the Savoy Grill, where he and his first wife Jill Esmond dined regularly after his performance in Romeo and Juliet. Olivier had seen Vivien in 'The Mask of Virtue' earlier in May, and congratulated her on her performance.\n\n1937 - 1939: Relationship with Sir Laurence Olivier\n\nOlivier and Leigh began an affair while acting as lovers in 'Fire Over England' (1937), but Olivier was still married to Esmond. During this period, Vivien read the Margaret Mitchell novel Gone with the Wind and instructed her American agent to recommend her to David O. Selznick, who was planning a film version.\n\nShe remarked to a journalist:\n\n\"I've cast myself as\n\nScarlett O'Hara\".\n\nThe Observer film critic C. A. Lejeune recalled a conversation of the same period in which Leigh \"stunned us all\" with the assertion that:\n\n\"Olivier won't play Rhett Butler,\n\nbut I shall play Scarlett O'Hara.\n\nWait and see.\"\n\nDespite her relative inexperience, Leigh was chosen to play Ophelia to Olivier's Hamlet in an Old Vic Theatre production staged at Elsinore, Denmark. Olivier later recalled an incident when her mood rapidly changed as she was preparing to go onstage. Without apparent provocation, she began screaming at him before suddenly becoming silent and staring into space.\n\nVivien was able to perform without mishap, and by the following day she had returned to normal with no recollection of the event. It was the first time Olivier witnessed such behaviour from her. They began living together, as their respective spouses had each refused to grant either of them a divorce. Under the moral standards then enforced by the film industry, their relationship had to be kept from public view.\n\nVivien appeared with Robert Taylor, Lionel Barrymore and Maureen O'Sullivan in 'A Yank at Oxford' (1938), which was the first of her films to receive attention in the United States. During production, she developed a reputation for being difficult and unreasonable, partly because she disliked her secondary role, but mainly because her petulant antics seemed to be paying dividends.\n\nAfter dealing with the threat of a lawsuit following a frivolous incident, Korda, however, instructed her agent to warn her that her option would not be renewed if her behaviour did not improve. Her next role was in 'Sidewalks of London', also known as 'St. Martin's Lane' (1938), with Charles Laughton.\n\nOlivier had been attempting to broaden his film career. He was not well known in the United States despite his success in Great Britain, and earlier attempts to introduce him to American audiences had failed. Offered the role of Heathcliff in Samuel Goldwyn's production of 'Wuthering Heights' (1939), he travelled to Hollywood, leaving Leigh in London. Goldwyn and the film's director, William Wyler, offered Leigh the secondary role of Isabella, but she refused, preferring the role of Cathy, which went to Merle Oberon.\n\nGone With the Wind\n\nHollywood was in the midst of a widely publicised search to find an actress to portray Scarlett O'Hara in David O. Selznick's production of 'Gone with the Wind' (1939). At the time, Myron Selznick - David's brother and Leigh's American theatrical agent - was the London representative of the Myron Selznick Agency. In February 1938, Leigh made a request to Myron Selznick that she be considered to play the part of Scarlett O'Hara.\n\nDavid O. Selznick watched her performances that month in 'Fire Over England' and 'A Yank at Oxford' and thought that she was excellent, but in no way a possible Scarlett because she was \"too British\".\n\nVivien travelled to Los Angeles, however, to be with Olivier and to try to convince David Selznick that she was the right person for the part. Myron Selznick also represented Olivier, and when he met Leigh, he felt that she possessed the qualities that his brother was searching for.\n\nAccording to legend, Myron Selznick took Leigh and Olivier to the set where the burning of the Atlanta Depot scene was being filmed and stage-managed an encounter, where he introduced Leigh, derisively addressing his younger brother:\n\n\"Hey, genius, meet your\n\nScarlett O'Hara.\"\n\nThe following day, Leigh read a scene for Selznick, who organised a screen test with director George Cukor and wrote to his wife:\n\n\"She's the Scarlett dark horse and\n\nlooks damn good. Not for anyone's\n\near but your own: it's narrowed\n\ndown to Paulette Goddard, Jean\n\nArthur, Joan Bennett and Vivien\n\nLeigh\".\n\nThe director, George Cukor, concurred, and praised Leigh's \"incredible wildness\". She secured the role of Scarlett soon after.\n\nVivien Leigh's Portrayal of Scarlett O'Hara\n\nFilming proved difficult for Leigh. Cukor was dismissed and replaced by Victor Fleming, with whom Leigh frequently quarrelled. She and Olivia de Havilland secretly met with Cukor at night and on weekends for his advice about how they should play their parts.\n\nLeigh befriended Clark Gable, his wife Carole Lombard and Olivia de Havilland, but she clashed with Leslie Howard, with whom she was required to play several emotional scenes.\n\nVivien was sometimes required to work seven days a week, often late into the night, which added to her distress, and she missed Olivier, who was working in New York City. On a long-distance telephone call to Olivier, she declared:\n\n\"Puss, my puss, how I hate film\n\nacting! Hate, hate, and never\n\nwant to do another film again!\"\n\nQuoted in a 2006 biography of Olivier, Olivia de Havilland defended Leigh against claims of her manic behaviour during the filming of Gone with the Wind:\n\n\"Vivien was impeccably professional,\n\nimpeccably disciplined on Gone With\n\nthe Wind. She had two great concerns:\n\ndoing her best work in an extremely\n\ndifficult role, and being separated from\n\nLarry (Olivier), who was in New York.\"\n\nGone with the Wind brought Leigh immediate attention and fame, but she was quoted as saying:\n\n\"I'm not a film star - I'm an actress. Being\n\na film star - just a film star - is such a false\n\nlife, lived for fake values and for publicity.\n\nActresses go on for a long time, and there\n\nare always marvellous parts to play.\"\n\nThe film won 10 Academy Awards including a Best Actress award for Leigh, who also won a New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress.\n\n1940 - 1949: Marriage and Early Joint Projects With Olivier\n\nIn February 1940, Jill Esmond agreed to divorce Laurence Olivier, and Leigh Holman agreed to divorce Vivien, although they maintained a strong friendship for the rest of Leigh's life. Esmond was granted custody of Tarquin, her son with Olivier. Holman was granted custody of Suzanne, his daughter with Leigh.\n\nOn the 31st. August 1940, Olivier and Leigh were married at the San Ysidro Ranch in Santa Barbara, California, in a ceremony attended only by their hosts, Ronald and Benita Colman and witnesses, Katharine Hepburn and Garson Kanin.\n\nVivien had made a screen test, and hoped to co-star with Olivier in 'Rebecca', which was to be directed by Alfred Hitchcock with Olivier in the leading role. After viewing Leigh's screen test, David Selznick noted that:\n\n\"She doesn't seem right as to\n\nsincerity or age or innocence\".\n\nThis view was shared by Hitchcock and by Leigh's mentor, George Cukor.\n\nSelznick observed that she had shown no enthusiasm for the part until Olivier had been confirmed as the lead actor, so he cast Joan Fontaine.\n\nHe refused to allow her to join Olivier in 'Pride and Prejudice' (1940), and Greer Garson played the role Leigh had wanted for herself.\n\n'Waterloo Bridge' (1940) was to have starred Olivier and Leigh; however, Selznick replaced Olivier with Robert Taylor who was at the peak of his success as one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's most popular male stars. Her top billing reflected her status in Hollywood, and the film was popular with audiences and critics.\n\nThe Oliviers mounted a stage production of 'Romeo and Juliet' for Broadway. The New York press publicised the adulterous nature of the beginning of Olivier and Leigh's relationship, and questioned their ethics in not returning to the UK to help with the war effort.\n\nCritics were hostile in their assessment of Romeo and Juliet. Brooks Atkinson for The New York Times wrote:\n\n'Although Miss Leigh and Mr. Olivier\n\nare handsome young people, they\n\nhardly act their parts at all.'\n\nWhile most of the blame was attributed to Olivier's acting and direction, Vivien was also criticised, with Bernard Grebanier commenting on the 'Thin, shop girl quality of Miss Leigh's voice'.\n\nThe couple had invested almost all of their combined savings of $40,000 in the project, and the failure was a financial disaster for them.\n\nThe Oliviers filmed 'That Hamilton Woman' (1941) with Olivier as Horatio Nelson and Leigh as Emma Hamilton. With the United States not yet having entered the war, it was one of several Hollywood films made with the aim of arousing a pro-British sentiment among American audiences. The film was popular in the United States, and an outstanding success in the Soviet Union.\n\nWinston Churchill arranged a screening for a party that included Franklin D. Roosevelt and, on its conclusion, addressed the group, saying:\n\n\"Gentlemen, I thought this film would\n\ninterest you, showing great events\n\nsimilar to those in which you have just\n\nbeen taking part.\"\n\nThe Oliviers remained favourites of Churchill, attending dinners and occasions at his request for the rest of his life; and, of Vivien, he was quoted as saying, \"By Jove, she's a clinker.\" ('Clinker' is a term that has fallen out of favour; in this context it means someone excellent or outstanding).\n\nThe Oliviers returned to Britain in March 1943, and Vivien toured through North Africa that same year as part of a revue for the armed forces stationed in the region. She reportedly turned down a studio contract worth $5,000 a week in order to volunteer as part of the war effort.\n\nLeigh performed for troops before falling ill with a persistent cough and fevers. In 1944, she was diagnosed as having tuberculosis in her left lung, and spent several weeks in hospital before appearing to have recovered.\n\nLeigh was filming 'Caesar and Cleopatra' (1945) when she discovered she was pregnant before having a miscarriage. Vivien temporarily fell into a deep depression that hit its low point, with her falling to the floor, sobbing in a hysterical fit. This was the first of many major bipolar disorder breakdowns.\n\nOlivier later came to recognise the symptoms of an impending episode - several days of hyperactivity followed by a period of depression and an explosive breakdown, after which Leigh would have no memory of the event, but would be acutely embarrassed and remorseful.\n\nJune 1948: Vivien Leigh and Olivier in Australia\n\nWith her doctor's approval, Leigh was well enough to resume acting in 1946, starring in a successful London production of Thornton Wilder's 'The Skin of Our Teeth'; but her films of this period, 'Caesar and Cleopatra' (1945) and 'Anna Karenina' (1948), were not great commercial successes.\n\nAll British films in this period were adversely affected by a Hollywood boycott of British films.\n\nIn 1947, Olivier was knighted, and Leigh accompanied him to Buckingham Palace for the investiture. Vivien became Lady Olivier. After their divorce, according to the style granted to the divorced wife of a knight, she became known socially as Vivien, Lady Olivier.\n\nBy 1948, Olivier was on the board of directors of the Old Vic Theatre, and he and Leigh embarked on a six-month tour of Australia and New Zealand to raise funds for the theatre. Olivier played the lead in 'Richard III' and also performed with Leigh in 'The School for Scandal' and 'The Skin of Our Teeth'.\n\nThe tour was an outstanding success and, although Vivien was plagued with insomnia and allowed her understudy to replace her for a week while she was ill, she generally withstood the demands placed upon her, with Olivier noting her ability to \"Charm the press\".\n\nMembers of the company later recalled several quarrels between the couple as Olivier was increasingly resentful of the demands placed on him during the tour. The most dramatic altercation occurred in Christchurch, New Zealand, when her shoes were not found and Leigh refused to go onstage without them.\n\nAn exhausted and exasperated Olivier screamed an obscenity at her and slapped her face, and a devastated Leigh slapped him in return, dismayed that he would hit her publicly. Subsequently, she made her way to the stage in borrowed pumps, and in seconds, had dried her tears and smiled brightly onstage.\n\nBy the end of the tour, both were exhausted and ill. Olivier told a journalist:\n\n\"You may not know it, but\n\nyou are talking to a couple\n\nof walking corpses.\"\n\nLater, he would observe that he \"lost Vivien\" in Australia.\n\nThe success of the tour encouraged the Oliviers to make their first West End appearance together, performing the same works with one addition, 'Antigone', included at Leigh's insistence because she wished to play a role in a tragedy.\n\n1949 - 1951: Play and Film Roles in 'A Streetcar Named Desire'\n\nLeigh next sought the role of Blanche DuBois in the West End stage production of Tennessee Williams's 'A Streetcar Named Desire', and was cast after Williams and the play's producer Irene Mayer Selznick saw her in 'The School for Scandal' and 'Antigone'; Olivier was contracted to direct.\n\nThe play contained a rape scene and references to promiscuity and homosexuality, and was destined to be controversial; the media discussion about its suitability added to Leigh's anxiety. Nevertheless, she believed strongly in the importance of the work.\n\nWhen the West End production of Streetcar opened in October 1949, J. B. Priestley denounced the play and Leigh's performance; and the critic Kenneth Tynan, who was to make a habit of dismissing her stage performances, commented that Leigh was badly miscast:\n\n\"Because British actors are too\n\nwell-bred to emote effectively\n\non stage\".\n\nOlivier and Leigh were chagrined that part of the commercial success of the play lay in audience members attending to see what they believed would be a salacious story, rather than the Greek tragedy that they envisioned.\n\nThe play also had strong supporters, among them Noël Coward, who described Leigh as \"Magnificent\".\n\nAfter 326 performances, Vivien finished her run, and she was soon assigned to reprise her role as Blanche DuBois in the film version of the play. Her irreverent and often bawdy sense of humour allowed her to establish a rapport with Brando.\n\nHowever Vivien had an initial difficulty in working with director Elia Kazan, who was displeased with the direction that Olivier had taken in shaping the character of Blanche. Kazan had favoured Jessica Tandy and later, Olivia de Havilland over Leigh, but knew she had been a success on the London stage as Blanche.\n\nElia later commented that he did not hold her in high regard as an actress, believing that she had a small talent. As work progressed, however, he became full of admiration for:\n\n\"The greatest determination to excel\n\nof any actress I've known. She'd have\n\ncrawled over broken glass if she thought\n\nit would help her performance.\"\n\nLeigh found the role gruelling, and commented to the Los Angeles Times:\n\n\"I had nine months in the theatre\n\nof Blanche DuBois. Now she's in\n\ncommand of me.\"\n\nOlivier accompanied her to Hollywood where he was to co-star with Jennifer Jones in William Wyler's 'Carrie' (1952).\n\nLeigh's performance in 'A Streetcar Named Desire' won glowing reviews, as well as a second Academy Award for Best Actress, a British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Award for Best British Actress, and a New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress.\n\nTennessee Williams commented that Leigh brought to the role:\n\n\"Everything that I intended,\n\nand much that I had never\n\ndreamed of\".\n\nLeigh herself had mixed feelings about her association with the character; in later years, she said that playing Blanche DuBois \"Tipped me over into madness\".\n\n1951 - 1960: Vivien Leigh's Struggle With Mental Illness\n\nIn 1951, Leigh and Laurence Olivier performed two plays about Cleopatra, William Shakespeare's 'Antony and Cleopatra' and George Bernard Shaw's 'Caesar and Cleopatra', alternating the play each night and winning good reviews. They took the productions to New York, where they performed a season at the Ziegfeld Theatre into 1952.\n\nThe reviews there were also mostly positive, but film critic Kenneth Tynan angered them when he suggested that Leigh's was a mediocre talent that forced Olivier to compromise his own. Tynan's diatribe almost precipitated another collapse; Leigh, terrified of failure and intent on achieving greatness, dwelt on his comments and ignored the positive reviews of other critics.\n\nIn January 1953, Vivien travelled to Ceylon to film 'Elephant Walk' with Peter Finch. Shortly after filming commenced, she had a nervous breakdown, and Paramount Pictures replaced her with Elizabeth Taylor.\n\nOlivier returned her to their home in Great Britain, where, between periods of incoherence, Leigh told him she was in love with Finch, and had been having an affair with him. Over a period of several months, she gradually recovered.\n\nAs a result of this episode, many of the Oliviers' friends learned of her problems. David Niven said she had been \"Quite, quite mad\". Noël Coward expressed surprise in his diary that:\n\n\"Things had been bad and getting\n\nworse since 1948 or thereabouts\".\n\nLeigh's romantic relationship with Finch began in 1948, and waxed and waned for several years, ultimately flickering out as her mental condition deteriorated.\n\nAlso in 1953, Vivien recovered sufficiently to play 'The Sleeping Prince' with Olivier, and in 1955 they performed a season at Stratford-upon-Avon in Shakespeare's 'Twelfth Night', 'Macbeth', and 'Titus Andronicus'.\n\nThey played to capacity houses, and attracted generally good reviews, with Vivien's health seemingly stable. John Gielgud directed 'Twelfth Night' and wrote:\n\n'Perhaps I will still make a good thing of\n\nthat divine play, especially if he will let me\n\npull her little ladyship (who is brainier than\n\nhe but not a born actress) out of her timidity\n\nand safeness.\n\nHe dares too confidently, but she hardly\n\ndares at all, and is terrified of overreaching\n\nher technique and doing anything that she\n\nhas not killed the spontaneity of by\n\nover-practice.'\n\nIn 1955, Leigh starred in Anatole Litvak's film 'The Deep Blue Sea'; co-star Kenneth More felt that he had poor chemistry with Leigh during the filming.\n\nIn 1956, Leigh took the lead role in the Noël Coward play 'South Sea Bubble', but withdrew from the production when she became pregnant. Several weeks later, she miscarried and entered a period of depression that lasted for months.\n\nVivien joined Olivier for a European tour of 'Titus Andronicus', but the tour was marred by Leigh's frequent outbursts against Olivier and other members of the company. After their return to London, her former husband, Leigh Holman, who could still exert a strong influence on her, stayed with the Oliviers and helped calm her.\n\nIn 1958, considering her marriage to be over, Leigh began a relationship with actor Jack Merivale, who knew of Leigh's medical condition and assured Olivier that he would care for her. In 1959, when she achieved a success with the Noël Coward comedy 'Look After Lulu!', a critic working for The Times described her as:\n\n'Beautiful, delectably cool and matter of\n\nfact, she is mistress of every situation\".\n\nIn 1960, Vivien and Olivier divorced and Olivier soon married actress Joan Plowright. In his autobiography, Olivier discussed the years of strain they had experienced because of Leigh's illness:\n\n'Throughout her possession by that uncannily\n\nevil monster, manic depression, with its deadly\n\never-tightening spirals, she retained her own\n\nindividual canniness - an ability to disguise her\n\ntrue mental condition from almost all except me,\n\nfor whom she could hardly be expected to take\n\nthe trouble.'\n\n1961 - 1967: The Final Years and Death of Vivien Leigh\n\nMerivale proved to be a stabilising influence for Leigh, but despite her apparent contentment, she was quoted by Radie Harris as confiding that she would rather have lived a short life with Larry [Olivier] than face a long one without him.\n\nHer first husband Leigh Holman also spent considerable time with her. Merivale joined her for a tour of Australia, New Zealand and Latin America that lasted from July 1961 until May 1962, and Leigh enjoyed positive reviews without sharing the spotlight with Olivier.\n\nThough Vivien was still beset by bouts of depression, she continued to work in the theatre and, in 1963, won a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her role in 'Tovarich'. She also appeared in the films 'The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone' (1961) and 'Ship of Fools' (1965).\n\nLeigh's last screen appearance in 'Ship of Fools' was both a triumph and emblematic of her illnesses that were taking root. Producer and director Stanley Kramer, who ended up with the film, planned to star Leigh, but was initially unaware of her fragile mental and physical state.\n\nLater recounting her work, Kramer remembered her courage in taking on the difficult role:\n\n'She was ill, and the courage to go\n\nahead, the courage to make the film -\n\nwas almost unbelievable.'\n\nLeigh's performance was tinged by paranoia, and resulted in outbursts that marred her relationship with other actors, although both Simone Signoret and Lee Marvin were sympathetic and understanding.\n\nIn one unusual instance during the attempted rape scene, Leigh became distraught and hit Marvin so hard with a spiked shoe that it marked his face. Leigh won the L'Étoile de Cristal for her performance in a leading role in 'Ship of Fools'.\n\nIn May 1967, Leigh was rehearsing to appear with Michael Redgrave in Edward Albee's 'A Delicate Balance' when her tuberculosis resurfaced. Following several weeks of rest, she seemed to recover.\n\nHowever, on the night of the 7th. July 1967, Merivale left her as usual at their Eaton Square flat to perform in a play, and he returned home just before midnight to find her asleep. About 30 minutes later (by now the 8th. July), he entered the bedroom and discovered her body on the floor. Vivien had died at the young age of 53.\n\nVivien had been attempting to walk to the bathroom and, as her lungs filled with liquid, she collapsed and suffocated. Merivale first contacted her family, and later was able to reach Olivier, who was receiving treatment for prostate cancer in a nearby hospital.\n\nIn his autobiography, Olivier described his \"Grievous anguish\" as he immediately travelled to Leigh's residence, to find that Merivale had moved her body onto the bed. Olivier paid his respects, and \"Stood and prayed for forgiveness for all the evils that had sprung up between us\", before helping Merivale make funeral arrangements. Olivier stayed until her body was removed from the flat.\n\nHer death was publicly announced on the 8th. July, and the lights of every theatre in central London were extinguished for an hour. A Catholic service for Leigh was held at St. Mary's Church, Cadogan Street, London. Her funeral was attended by the luminaries of British stage and screen.\n\nAccording to the provisions of her will, Leigh was cremated at the Golders Green Crematorium, and her ashes were scattered on the lake at her summer home, Tickerage Mill, near Blackboys, East Sussex.\n\nA memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields, with a final tribute read by John Gielgud.\n\nIn 1968, Leigh became the first actress honoured in the United States by 'The Friends of the Libraries at the University of Southern California'. The ceremony was conducted as a memorial service, with selections from her films shown and tributes provided by such associates as George Cukor, who screened the tests that Leigh had made for Gone with the Wind, the first time the screen tests had been seen in 30 years.\n\nThe Legacy of Vivien Leigh\n\nRegarded as one of the most beautiful actresses of her era, her directors emphasised this in most of her films. When asked if she believed her beauty had been an impediment to being taken seriously as an actress, she said:\n\n\"People think that if you look fairly\n\nreasonable, you can't possibly act,\n\nand as I only care about acting, I\n\nthink beauty can be a great handicap,\n\nif you really want to look like the part\n\nyou're playing, which isn't necessarily\n\nlike you.\"\n\nDirector George Cukor described Leigh as a \"Consummate actress, hampered by beauty\", and Laurence Olivier said that:\n\n\"Critics should give her credit for being\n\nan actress and not go on forever letting\n\ntheir judgments be distorted by her great\n\nbeauty.\"\n\nGarson Kanin described Leigh as:\n\n\"A stunner whose ravishing beauty often\n\ntended to obscure her staggering\n\nachievements as an actress.\n\nGreat beauties are infrequently great\n\nactresses - simply because they don't\n\nneed to be.\n\nVivien was different; ambitious,\n\npersevering, serious, often inspired.\"\n\nVivien explained that she played as many different parts as possible in an attempt to learn her craft and to dispel prejudice about her abilities.\n\nShe believed that comedy was more difficult to play than drama because it required more precise timing, and said that more emphasis should be placed upon comedy as part of an actor's training. Nearing the end of her career, which ranged from Noël Coward comedies to Shakespearean tragedies, she observed:\n\n\"It's much easier to make people\n\ncry than to make them laugh.\"\n\nHer early performances brought her immediate success in Great Britain, but she remained largely unknown in other parts of the world until the release of 'Gone with the Wind'. In December 1939, film critic Frank Nugent wrote in The New York Times:\n\n\"Miss Leigh's Scarlett has vindicated\n\nthe absurd talent quest that indirectly\n\nturned her up.\n\nShe is so perfectly designed for the\n\npart by art and nature that any other\n\nactress in the role would be\n\ninconceivable\".\n\nAs Vivien's fame escalated, she was featured on the cover of Time magazine as Scarlett. In 1969, critic Andrew Sarris commented that the success of the film had been largely due to \"the inspired casting\" of Leigh, and in 1998, wrote that:\n\n\"She lives in our minds and memories\n\nas a dynamic force rather than as a\n\nstatic presence\".\n\nFilm historian and critic Leonard Maltin described the film as one of the all-time greats, writing in 1998 that Leigh \"brilliantly played\" her role.\n\nVivien's performance in the West End production of 'A Streetcar Named Desire' was described by the theatre writer Phyllis Hartnoll as:\n\n\"Proof of greater powers as\n\nan actress than she had\n\nhitherto shown\".\n\nThis led to a lengthy period during which she was considered one of the finest actresses in British theatre. Discussing the subsequent film version, Pauline Kael wrote that Leigh and Marlon Brando gave \"Two of the greatest performances ever put on film\" and that Leigh's was:\n\n\"One of those rare performances\n\nthat can truly be said to evoke both\n\nfear and pity.\"\n\nVivien's greatest critic was Kenneth Tynan who ridiculed Leigh's performance opposite Olivier in the 1955 production of 'Titus Andronicus', commenting that:\n\n\"She receives the news that she is\n\nabout to be ravished on her husband's\n\ncorpse with little more than the mild\n\nannoyance of one who would have\n\npreferred foam rubber.\"\n\nTynan was also critical of her reinterpretation of Lady Macbeth in 1955, saying that her performance was insubstantial, and lacked the necessary fury demanded of the role.\n\nAfter her death, however, Tynan revised his opinion, describing his earlier criticism as one of the worst errors of judgment he had ever made. He came to believe that Leigh's interpretation, in which Lady Macbeth uses her sexual allure to keep Macbeth enthralled, \"Made more sense than the usual battle-axe\" portrayal of the character.\n\nIn a survey of theatre critics conducted shortly after Leigh's death, several named her performance as Lady Macbeth as one of her greatest achievements in theatre.\n\nIn 1969, a plaque to Leigh was placed in the Actors' Church, St Paul's, Covent Garden, London. In 1985, a portrait of her was included in a series of United Kingdom postage stamps, along with Sir Alfred Hitchcock, Sir Charlie Chaplin, Peter Sellers and David Niven to commemorate British Film Year.\n\nIn April 1996, Vivien appeared in the Centenary of Cinema stamp issue (with Sir Laurence Olivier) and in April 2013 was again included in another series, this time celebrating the 100th. anniversary of her birth.\n\nThe British Library in London purchased the papers of Olivier from his estate in 1999. Known as The Laurence Olivier Archive, the collection includes many of Leigh's personal papers, including numerous letters she wrote to Olivier.\n\nThe papers of Leigh, including letters, photographs, contracts and diaries, are owned by her daughter, Mrs. Suzanne Farrington.\n\nIn 1994, the National Library of Australia purchased a photograph album, monogrammed \"L & V O\" and believed to have belonged to the Oliviers, containing 573 photographs of the couple during their 1948 tour of Australia. It is now held as part of the record of the history of the performing arts in Australia.\n\nIn 2013, an archive of Leigh's letters, diaries, photographs, annotated film and theatre scripts and her numerous awards was acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.\n\nThe Ending of 'Gone With the Wind'\n\nRhett Butler (Clark Gable), as his last words to Scarlett O'Hara, in response to her tearful question: \"Where shall I go? What shall I do?\" says:\n\n\"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn\".\n\nThe line demonstrates that Rhett has finally given up on Scarlett and their tumultuous relationship. After more than a decade of fruitlessly seeking her love - as covered by over two and a half hours of film - he no longer cares what happens to her.\n\nHowever, although they are the last words of Rhett Butler, they are not the last words of the film. Scarlett clings to the hope that she can win him back, and she carries on soliloquising, saying (amongst other things):\n\n\"I'll think about it tomorrow\".\n\n\"I'll think of some way to get him back\".\n\nAnd, finally:\n\n\"After all, tomorrow is another day!\"\n\nGreater love hath no man than this\n\n2nd.

In July 1916 he was promoted to Sub-Lieutenant, serving on the minesweeper HMS Daphne. In May 1917 Gerald was transferred to the dreadnought battleship HMS Vanguard.\n\nOn Monday 9th. July 1917, Vanguard blew up at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands. The cause of explosion on Vanguard is unknown, but the most likely explanation is that a fire in fuel compartment caused some cordite near the adjoining bulkhead to overheat.\n\nAB Earnest 'Micky' Maroney witnessed the explosion from HMAS Melbourne and wrote in his notebook,\n\n'HMS Vanguard, Scapa Flow, North Scotland. At 11.20 pm on the 9th. July a great explosion occurred in the midst of the Grand Fleet. A terrible detonation took place lighting the whole fleet as if it were daylight. There was a crash and one of the big boats went sky high with a crew of 900 men. All searchlights were switched on immediately but not a thing was to be seen.\n\nA trawler which was close by got covered in blood and pieces of human flesh, and afterwards picked up half the body of a marine, the only body recovered to date. I happened to be on watch and saw nearly everything. No one knows how she went up, but seeing she had a new ships company it is surmised that it was the work of German spies. (Later) 2 men saved 1 marine and 1 AB. 1 officer died immediately after. 187 men recovered from the sea.'\n\nOf the crew of 845 men, 843 were killed. Gerald died aged 20.

Two French destroyers and some trawlers also rescued another 221 men. It is suggested that Royal Alberts death toll of 935 was high because the men had just completed a boat drill and were down below re-stowing their equipment.\n\nJames, died aged 33.

He made his breakthrough as the singer and bass player for The Police and then launched a successful solo career. Sting occasionally ventured into acting on both film and television. He was memorable as the Mod leader in Quadrophenia (1979) and as Eddie’s father in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998).\n\nSting was born Gordon Matthew Thomas Sumner in Wallsend, England, in 1951. He was the eldest of four children born to Audrey Sumner née Cowell, a hairdresser, and Ernest Matthew Sumner, a milkman and engineer. His siblings were Philip, Angela and Anita. Young Gordon would often assist his father with the early-morning milk-delivery rounds, and by age 10 he became ‘obsessed’ with an old Spanish guitar that had been left behind by an emigrating friend of his father. He attended St. Cuthbert's Grammar School in Newcastle upon Tyne. He would often sneak into nightclubs like the Club A Go-Go, where he would watch acts such as Cream and Jimi Hendrix, artists who would later influence his own music. After jobs as a bus conductor, a construction labourer, and a tax officer, he attended Northern Counties College of Education, (later part of Northumbria University) from 1971 to 1974 and qualified as a teacher. He then worked as a schoolteacher at St. Paul's First School in Cramlington for two years. On evenings, weekends, and during breaks from college and from teaching, Sting performed in local jazz bands, played cruise ships, backed strippers in cabarets, and developed a love for the bass guitar. He gained his nickname when he wore a black and gold rugby shirt during a concert. It made him look like a bee, and prompted the nickname ‘Sting’. The nickname stuck. In 1977, Sting moved from Newcastle to London, and soon thereafter he joined Stewart Copeland and Henry Padovani (who was soon replaced by Andy Summers) to form the New Wave band The Police. Between 1978 and 1983, they released five chart-topping albums and won six Grammy Awards. Although their initial sound was punk inspired, The Police soon switched to reggae-tinged rock and minimalist pop. Sting also appeared in some British films. He played Ace Face, the leader of the Mod gang in Quadrophenia (1979, Franc Roddam) starring Phil Daniels. The film, based on the 1973 rock opera by The Who, tells about the rivalry between the Mods and the Rockers in 1960’s England. Mark Deming at AllMovie calls it “intelligent and incisive bit of teen-centric kitchen-sink drama” and writes about Sting: “Equally memorable (is) Sting, who says practically nothing but radiates waves of icy charisma.” His next film Radio On (1979, Christopher Petit) is a black and white road movie, featuring music by Kraftwerk and David Bowie. A DJ (David Beames) drives from London to Bristol to investigate the suicide of his brother, and on his way he meets some odd people including Sting. The pitch-black comedy Brimstone and Treacle (1982, Richard Loncraine) was based on a television play by Dennis Potter. Sting co-starred as a mysterious young stranger who dramatically changes the lives of a middle-aged middle-class couple (Denholm Elliot and Joan Plowright) in a North London suburb whose daughter has been totally dependent upon them after a catastrophic accident. In 1983, the last album of The Police, Synchronicity, was released. It included their most successful song, Every Breath You Take. The song, which after waking up in the middle of the night from a dream, is officially the most requested radio song of all time. While never formally breaking up, after Synchronicity the group agreed to concentrate on solo projects.\n\nIn 1981, Sting made his first live solo appearance, performing on all four nights of the fourth Amnesty International benefit The Secret Policeman's Other Ball at the invitation of producer Martin Lewis. He performed solo versions of Roxanne and Message in a Bottle. He also led The Secret Police, an all-star band including Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Phil Collins, Bob Geldof and Midge Ure on his own arrangement of Bob Dylan's I Shall Be Released. His performances were featured prominently in the album and film of the show and drew critical attention to his work. Sting's participation in The Secret Policeman's Other Ball was the beginning of his growing involvement in raising money and consciousness for political and social causes. In 1982 he released a solo single, Spread a Little Happiness from the film version of the Dennis Potter television play Brimstone and Treacle. The song was a re-interpretation of a song from the 1920’s musical Mr. Cinders by Vivian Ellis, and was a surprise Top 20 hit in the UK. He also co-starred in the science fiction film Dune (1984, David Lynch). With a budget of over 40 million dollars, Dune required 80 sets built on 16 sound stages and a total crew of 1700. The film was not well received by critics and performed poorly at the box-office. His following film was The Bride (1985, Franc Roddam), an adaptation of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Sting starred as Baron Charles Frankenstein and Jennifer Beals played a woman he creates in the same fashion as his infamous monster. Both films flopped and damaged Sting’s prospects as major film star. A minor success was the Meryl Streep vehicle Plenty (1985, Fred Schepisi), in which Sting had only a supporting part. His first solo album, The Dream of the Blue Turtles (1985), included the hit singles If You Love Somebody Set Them Free and Russians. The album reached Triple Platinum and would garner Sting a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year. He performed with Dire Straits at the Live Aid Concert at Wembley Stadium. Prior to the Live Aid concert, in November 1984 Sting performed Do They Know It's Christmas? with Band Aid for the relief of poverty in Africa. In 1987, Sting released ...Nothing Like the Sun, including the hit songs Fragile, Englishman in New York, and Be Still My Beating Heart. It eventually went Double Platinum. In 1988, he featured in the role of the soldier on an album of Igor Stravinsky's The Soldier's Tale with the London Sinfonietta conducted by Kent Nagano. It also featured Vanessa Redgrave and Sir Ian McKellen. On screen he appeared in the atmospheric thriller Stormy Monday (1988, Mike Figgis), co-starring with Sean Bean, Tommy Lee Jones, and Melanie Griffith. He also co-starred in the Italian drama film Giulia e Giulia/Julia and Julia (1987, Peter Del Monte) with Kathleen Turner and Gabriel Byrne. This film, presented at the Venice Film Festival in 1987, was the first feature shot using the Sony HDVS wideband analogue High-definition video technique and then transferred to 35 mm film\n\nSting’s 1991 album The Soul Cages included the Top 10 song All This Time, and the Grammy-winning The Soul Cages. The album eventually went Platinum. The following year, he married film producer Trudie Styler. In 1993, he released the album Ten Summoner's Tales, which peaked at number two in the UK and US Album Charts, and went triple platinum in just over a year. A hit single on the album was If I Ever Lose My Faith in You, which earned Sting his second Grammy Award. In 1993, he released a cover of his own Police song Demolition Man from the Ghost in the Machine album for the film Demolition Man (1993, Marco Brambilla). Together with Bryan Adams and Rod Stewart, Sting performed the chart-topping song All for Love for the film The Three Musketeers (1993, Stephen Herek). The song stayed at the top of the U.S. charts for five weeks and went Platinum. In 1995 he played a bisexual butler in the British film The Grotesque (1995, John-Paul Davidson) with Alan Bates, Lena Headey and Theresa Russell. His nude scenes were the highlights of that film, according to an IMDb reviewer. His 1996 album, Mercury Falling debuted strongly with the single Let Your Soul Be Your Pilot, but it dropped quickly on the charts. Sting was also recording music for the upcoming Disney film Kingdom of the Sun, which went on to be reworked into The Emperor's New Groove (2000, Mark Dindal). The film went through drastic overhauls and plot changes, many of which were documented by his wife, Trudie Styler. She captured the moment he was called by Disney who then informed him that his songs would not be used in the final film. The story was put into a final product: The Sweatbox, which premiered at the Toronto Film Festival. Disney currently holds the rights to the film and will not grant its release. More successful was his work on the British crime film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998, Guy Ritchie). He played the father of a self-confident young card sharp (Nick Moran) who loses half a million pounds to a powerful crime lord in a card game. He and his friends have one week to come up with the cash. Laura Abraham at AllMovie: “a work of artistic originality as well as an accurate portrayal of life as an Eastender. A rabid, farcical look at gangsters in East End London, it contains mayhem at the center of every scene and gains additional intensity from the slow-motion technique Ritchie employs in many of his death sequences.” The film brought Guy Ritchie international acclaim and introduced former footballer Vinnie Jones, and former street merchant Jason Statham to worldwide cinema audiences. In 1999, Sting’s album Brand New Day included the Top 40 hits Brand New Day and Desert Rose. The album went Triple Platinum and won two Grammy Awards.\n\nIn 2002 Sting won a Golden Globe Award for his song Until... from the film Kate and Leopold. It was also nominated for Academy Award for Best Song. At the 2002 Brit Awards, he received the prize for Outstanding Contribution to Music. Later that year he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, was awarded the CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire), and won an Emmy Award for his A&E special, Sting in Tuscany... All This Time. In 2003 he released Sacred Love. He and Mary J. Blige won a Grammy for their album duet, Whenever I Say Your Name. The album did not have the hit singles like his previous releases. However, the album did reach platinum status. His autobiography Broken Music (2003) was published in October. In 2006, he released an album, to mixed reviews, entitled Songs from the Labyrinth featuring the music of English Renaissance composer John Dowland and accompaniment from Bosnian lute player Edin Karamazov. In 2007, he reunited with the other members of The Police as the introductory act for the 2007 Grammy Awards, singing Roxanne. Subsequently they announced The Police Reunion Tour. The Police toured for more than a year, beginning with North America and eventually crossing over to Europe, South America, Australia & New Zealand and Japan. The last concert was at Madison Square Garden on 7 August 2008, during which his three daughters appeared with him onstage. In 2009 he released a new solo album If on a Winter's Night... In the cinema he was seen in several film as himself. He had a cameos in the mockumentaries Brüno (2009, Larry Charles) starring Sacha Baron Cohen as the gay Austrian fashion journalist Brüno, and Do It Again (2010, Robert Patton-Spruill) which follows Boston Globe reporter Geoff Edgers on his quest to reunite British rock band The Kinks. He also gave his voice to the animation feature Bee Movie (2007, Steve Hickner, Simon J. Smith). During his career Sting has received 16 Grammy Awards, three Brit Awards, a Golden Globe, an Emmy Award, and several Oscar nominations for Best Original Song. Sting was married twice, first to actress Frances Tomelty and since 1992 to Trudie Styler. He has six children, two with Tomelty (singer Joseph Sumner (1976) and actress Fuschia Sumner (1982) and four with Styler (Mickey Sumner (1984), Jake Sumner (1985), Coco Sumner (1990) and Giacomo Sumner (1995). Sting owns a Jacobian castle in Wiltshire, a place in London, an apartment in New York, a house on the beach in Malibu, California, and a Renaissance Florentine Villa in Tuscany, Italy.\n\nSources: Hal Erickson (AllMovie), Mark Deming (AllMovie), Laura Abraham (AllMovie), Dan Fineberg (IMDb), Wikipedia and IMDb."
