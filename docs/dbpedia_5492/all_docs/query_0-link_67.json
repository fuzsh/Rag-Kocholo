        "text": "Hollywood created an image, and I long ago reconciled myself to it. I was the French cliche.”\n\n--- Louis Jourdan\n\nProfile\n\n​Louis Jourdan, nom de scène de Louis Gendre, est un acteur français né le 19 juin 1921 à Marseille1 et mort le 14 février 2015 à Beverly Hills. Après avoir débuté en France, il s'expatrie aux États-Unis dès la fin des années 1940 et fait ensuite l'essentiel de sa carrière dans le cinéma américain.\n\nBiography\n\nHe was born Louis Gendre on July 19, 1921, in Marseille. He studied acting at Ecole d'art Dramatique, and his first movie role came in Le Corsaire (1939), a French film that was never completed because of World War II. After his father, a hotelier, was arrested by the Gestapo, Jourdan joined the French Underground.\n\nAfter World War II, A talent agent recommended Louis Jourdan to the famed producer David O. Selznick, who cast him in Alfred Hitchcock's The Paradine Case (1947). It was Jourdan's first Hollywood movie and the only one he made with Selznick. It was a failure, and the director Hitchcock believed it was due to casting \"The pretty pretty boy\" Jourdan.\n\nLouis Jourdan(19 June 1921-14 February 2015) The pretty pretty boy\n\nFor the next decades, however, \"The pretty pretty boy\" became very popular in Hollywood and matured into \"The French Lover\".\n\nIn 1948, he starred in Max Ophuls' Letters From an Unknown Woman, playing a Viennese concert pianist who received a letter from a woman(played by Joan Fontaine) he once had a love affair with but no longer remembered. Then he starred in Vincente Minnelli's version of Madame Bovary (1949) opposite Jennifer Jones; in Bird of Paradise (1951) with Debra Paget; and as a pirate in Anne of the Indies (1951) with Jean Peters and Paget again; In Three Coins in the Fountain he played the suave lead as a predatory prince, and in 1956, he portrayed a commoner who falls in love with a princess (Grace Kelly) in The Swan.\n\nLouis Jourdan with Grace Kelly in film The Swan\n\nBut it was in Gigi(1958), MGM big-­budget musical directed by Vincente Minnelli where he played a wealthy bon vivant in love with a beautiful courtesan-in-training (played by Leslie Caron) that eternalized his image of French love of Hollywood. The film won the best picture Oscar and eight other Academy Awards.\n\nLouis Jourdan in Gigi with Maurice Chevalier and Leslie Caron\n\nAfter the huge success of Gigi, Jourdan was being cast in similar role in a number of films, such as The V.I.P.s (1962), opposite Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton; and the Gallic romp Made in Paris (1966), with Ann-Margret.\n\nThe late 1960s and '70s, with a changing sensibility toward romance in moviemaking, did not serve up the kinds of roles that Jourdan was known for. Which fit Louis Jourdan perfectly as he hated the Hollywood's typecasting. He was relieved to be able to play villains, such as in Octopussy (1983), Counterforce (1988) and The Return of the Swamp Thing (1989).\n\nOther than films, Louis Jourdan also worked in TVs and theatre, with theatre being his favorite.\n\nI must confess I love the theater best, though. I've never done a play I didn't like, but one often does movies just to keep functioning. They're less important to me than plays.\n\n​--Louis Jourdan\n\n​After almost 50 years in show business, Louis Jourdan retired from Hollywood and lived in Los Angels. His last film was a comedy, Peter Yates' Year of the Comet (1992), telling the story of looking for the most valuable wine in the world, made in France. A fitting farewell for someone who is invaluable to Hollywood, also made in France.\n\nIn July 2010 Louis Jourdan was made a Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur by France.\n\nContrary to his on screen image of French love, in real life, he was married only once. On 11 March 1946, Louis Jourdan married Berthe Frédérique. They had a son Louis Henry Jourdan born in 1951 who died of a narcotics overdose at the age of 29 in 1981. And his wife Berthe Jourdan died in 2014.\n\nLouis Jourdan died at his home in Beverly Hills on 14 February 2015 at the age of 93, an almost comic coincidence: It seems he has taken on his leave on the day of love to match up with his \"French Lover\" reputation.\n\nBiographie\n\nLouis Jourdan est le fils d'Henry Gendre et d'Yvonne Jourdan, propriétaires d'un hôtel. Dès 17 ans, il témoigne de son désir de devenir acteur. Il est élevé en France, en Turquie et en Angleterre, et s'exerce en tant qu'acteur à l'École dramatique, faisant ses débuts à l'écran en 1939.\n\nPendant l'occupation allemande, durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale, il continue à faire des films, surtout avec Marc Allégret et Marcel L'Herbier qui l'ont fait débuter; flirtant avec Danielle Darrieux dans l'immense succès Premier Rendez-vous, fiancé (au moins par les journaux) avec Micheline Presle, sa partenaire régulière, Jourdan s'impose comme le jeune premier numéro un du cinéma français.\n\nNéanmoins, refusant de participer aux productions cinématographiques de propagande nazie, il rejoint la Résistance française. Son père est arrêté par la Gestapo. Après la Libération, Louis Jourdan épouse Berthe Frédérique, avec qui il a un fils.\n\nLouis Jourdan avec sa femme Berthe Frédérique\n\nRepéré par David O. Selznick, l'acteur tente ensuite l'aventure du cinéma américain, faisant l'objet d'un grand battage publicitaire qui le rend célèbre avant même qu'il ait tourné un film en Amérique. Après un rôle central (proche de l'amant de Lady Chatterley) au milieu d'une distribution impressionnante (Gregory Peck, Charles Laughton, Charles Coburn, Ethel Barrymore, Alida Valli), dans Le Procès Paradine (1947), un film d'Alfred Hitchcock qui n'obtient pas le succès escompté, il tient l'année suivante, face à Joan Fontaine, le principal rôle masculin de Lettre d'une inconnue, réalisé aux États-Unis par Max Ophüls.\n\nLouis Jourdan mène dès lors une seconde carrière à Hollywood, où il joue des personnages de « French Lover » à la manière d'un Charles Boyer, avec pour partenaires Jennifer Jones (Jourdan est Rodolphe dans Madame Bovary), Debra Paget, Jean Peters, Doris Day, Grace Kelly, Elizabeth Taylor, souvent dirigé par des cinéastes prestigieux (Vincente Minnelli à plusieurs reprises, Delmer Daves, Jacques Tourneur...).\n\nEn 1954, il joue au théâtre avec James Dean. Comme des acteurs américains des années 1950-1960 pouvaient l'être, il est rompu à plusieurs disciplines et chante en anglais et sans doublage dans les comédies musicales auxquelles il participe outre-Atlantique (Gigi avec Leslie Caron et Maurice Chevalier et Can-Can aux côtés de Shirley MacLaine et Frank Sinatra) ou lors d'une scène romantique comme son duo avec Ann-Margret dans Made in Paris (1966).\n\nIl revient occasionnellement tourner en Europe, en France pour notamment Rue de l'Estrapade de Jacques Becker, La mariée est trop belle avec Brigitte Bardot, une adaptation en deux époques du Comte de Monte-Cristo réalisée par Claude Autant-Lara, Mathias Sandorf d'après Jules Verne, en Grande-Bretagne (Le Prisonnier du temple au côté de Belinda Lee), en Italie (le péplum Les Vierges de Rome, Le Désordre de Franco Brusati), mais continue de mener principalement une carrière américaine.\n\nLouis Jourdan dans La mariée est trop belle avec Brigitte Bardo\n\nDans les années 1980, il travaille avec Wes Craven et interprète le rôle du méchant dans un film de la série des James Bond, Octopussy (1983), puis interprète le rôle de Pierre de Coubertin à la télévision américaine (où il avait déjà joué D'Artagnan, Dracula et un meurtrier dans un épisode de Columbo la décennie précédente) en 1984.\n\nLouis Jourdan prendra sa retraite de comédien en 1991, juste après le tournage du film Year of the comet, de Peter Yates, qui sortira en 1992.\n\nLouis Jourdan a l'honneur peu courant d'avoir deux étoiles à son nom (musique et télévision) sur le Walk of Fame d'Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nLe 22 juillet 2010, Louis Jourdan reçoit la Légion d'honneur des mains de l'ambassadeur français Pierre Vimont.\n\n​Il est marié avec Berthe Frédérique Pacart dite « Quique », du 11 Mars 1946 jusqu'à son décès en 2014. Durant les années 60, il entretient une liaison avec Denise Le Mentec, avec qui il a un fils non reconnu.\n\nSon fils, Louis Henry Jourdan, est né le 6 octobre 1951. Il décède à l'âge de 29 ans le 12 mai 1981 d'une overdose.\n\nLouis meurt le 14 février 2015, à son domicile de Beverly Hills, situé au 1139 Maybrook Drive, dans le Comté de Los Angeles.\n\nFurther interest\n\nArticles\n\nProfile\n\n​Laurence Kerr Olivier, Baron Olivier, OM (22 May 1907 – 11 July 1989) was an English actor and director who, along with his contemporaries Ralph Richardson and John Gielgud, was one of a trio of male actors who dominated the British stage of the mid-20th century. He also worked in films throughout his career, playing more than fifty cinema roles. Late in his career, he had considerable success in television roles.\n\nHis family had no theatrical connections, but Olivier's father, a clergyman, decided that his son should become an actor. After attending a drama school in London, Olivier learned his craft in a succession of acting jobs during the late 1920s. In 1930 he had his first important West End success in Noël Coward's Private Lives, and he appeared in his first film, and by the end of the decade he was an established star. In the 1940s, together with Richardson and John Burrell, Olivier was the co-director of the Old Vic, building it into a highly respected company. There his most celebrated roles included Shakespeare's Richard III and Sophocles's Oedipus. In the 1950s Olivier was an independent actor-manager, but his stage career was in the doldrums until he joined the avant garde English Stage Company in 1957 to play the title role in The Entertainer, a part he later played on film. From 1963 to 1973 he was the founding director of Britain's National Theatre, running a resident company that fostered many future stars. His own parts there included the title role in Othello (1965) and Shylock in The Merchant of Venice (1970).\n\nAmong Olivier's films are Wuthering Heights (1939), Rebecca (1940), and a trilogy of Shakespeare films as actor/director: Henry V (1944), Hamlet (1948), and Richard III (1955).\n\nOlivier's honours included a knighthood (1947), a life peerage (1970) and the Order of Merit (1981). For his on-screen work he received four Academy Awards, two British Academy Film Awards, five Emmy Awards and three Golden Globe Awards. The National Theatre's largest auditorium is named in his honour, and he is commemorated in the Laurence Olivier Awards, given annually by the Society of London Theatre. He was married three times, to the actresses Jill Esmond from 1930 to 1940, Vivien Leigh from 1940 to 1960, and Joan Plowright from 1961 until his death.\n\nBiography\n\nLawrence Olivier as a young child\n\nLawrence Olivier was born in Dorking, Surrey, the youngest of the three children of the Reverend Gerard Kerr Olivier (1869–1939) and his wife Agnes Louise(1871–1920). His great-great-grandfather was of French Huguenot descent, and Olivier came from a long line of Protestant clergymen. His father Gerard Olivier liked to be addressed as \"Father Olivier\" which made him unacceptable to most Anglican congregations and tempory church posts offers only, and Lawrence Olivier lived a nomadic existence until age 5 when his father secured a permanent appointment as assistant rector at St Saviour's, Pimlico for six years, and a stable family life was at last possible.\n\nIn a school production of Julius Caesar in 1917, the ten-year-old Olivier's performance as Brutus impressed the audience. He later won praise in other schoolboy productions, as Maria in Twelfth Night (1918) and Katherine in The Taming of the Shrew (1922).\n\nLawrence Olivier as a young child\n\nOlivier was enrolled in St Edward's School, Oxford, from 1920 to 1924. He made little mark until his final year, when he played Puck in the school's production of A Midsummer Night's Dream; his performance was a tour de force that won him popularity among his fellow pupils.\n\n​On leaving the school after a year, Olivier gained work with small touring companies before being taken on in 1925 by Sybil Thorndike and her husband Lewis Casson as a bit-part player, understudy and assistant stage manager for their London company.He modelled his performing style on that of Gerald du Maurier.\n\nIn 1926, on Thorndike's recommendation, Olivier joined the Birmingham Repertory Company, where he was given the chance to play a wide range of important roles in his second year, including Tony Lumpkin in She Stoops to Conquer, the title role in Uncle Vanya, and Parolles in All's Well That Ends Well.\n\nWhile playing the juvenile lead in Bird in Hand at the Royalty Theatre in June 1928, Olivier began a relationship with Jill Esmond, the daughter of the actors Henry V. Esmond and Eva Moore. Olivier later recounted that he thought \"she would most certainly do excellent well for a wife ... I wasn't likely to do any better at my age and with my undistinguished track-record, so I promptly fell in love with her.\"\n\n​In 1930, with his impending marriage in mind, Olivier earned some extra money with small roles in two films. Olivier did not enjoy working in film, which he dismissed as \"this anaemic little medium which could not stand great acting\", but financially it was much more rewarding than his theatre work.\n\nOlivier and Esmond married on 25 July 1930 at All Saints, Margaret Street, although within weeks both realised they had erred.\n\nIn 1930 Noël Coward cast Olivier as Victor Prynne in his new play Private Lives, which opened at the new Phoenix Theatre in London in September. Olivier played Victor in the West End and then on Broadway. In addition to giving the 23-year-old Olivier his first successful West End role, Coward became something of a mentor.\n\nLawrence Olivier and first wife Jill Esmond, 1933\n\nIn 1931 RKO Pictures offered Olivier a two-film contract at $1,000 a week; he discussed the possibility with Coward, who, irked, told Olivier \"You've no artistic integrity, that's your trouble; this is how you cheapen yourself.\"He accepted and moved to Hollywood, despite some misgivings. His first film was the drama Friends and Lovers, in a supporting role, but Olivier's initial foray into American films had not provided the breakthrough he hoped for.\n\nIn 1935, John Gielgud staged Romeo and Juliet at the New Theatre, co-starring with Peggy Ashcroft, Edith Evans and Olivier. Gielgud had seen Olivier in Queen of Scots, spotted his potential, and now gave him a major step up in his career. For the first weeks of the run Gielgud played Mercutio and Olivier played Romeo, after which they exchanged roles.The production broke all box-office records for the play, running for 189 performances.\n\nLawrence Olivier and Peggy Ashcroft in play Romeo and Juliet\n\nIn 1936 Olivier accepted an invitation to join the Old Vic company. The theatre, in an unfashionable location south of the Thames, had offered inexpensive tickets for opera and drama under its proprietor Lilian Baylis since 1912. Her drama company specialised in the plays of Shakespeare, and many leading actors had taken very large cuts in their pay to develop their Shakespearean techniques there.\n\nThat same year, he met Vivien Leigh, the two fell in love and started a love affair.\n\nLawrence Olivier and Vivien Leigh\n\nIn June 1937 the Old Vic company took up an invitation to perform Hamlet in the courtyard of the castle at Elsinore, Denmark where Shakespeare located the play. Olivier secured the casting of Vivien Leigh as Ophelia.\n\nOn returning from Denmark, Olivier and Leigh told their respective spouses about the affair and that their marriages were over. Later the couple moved into a property together in Iver, Buckinghamshire.\n\nIn late 1938, lured by a salary of $50,000, Lawrence Olivier travelled to Hollywood to take the part of Heathcliff in the 1939 film Wuthering Heights, alongside Merle Oberon and David Niven. In less than a month Leigh had joined him.\n\n​Olivier did not enjoy making Wuthering Heights, and his approach to film acting, combined with a dislike for Oberon, led to tensions on set. The resulting film was a commercial and critical success that earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor, and created his screen reputation.\n\nLawrence Olivier, 1939\n\nAfter returning to London briefly in mid-1939, the couple returned to America, Leigh to film the final takes for Gone with the Wind, and Olivier to prepare for filming of Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca.\n\nIn January 1940 Olivier and Esmond were granted their divorce. In February, following another request from Leigh, her husband also applied for their marriage to be terminated.\n\nThey were married in August 1940, at the San Ysidro Ranch in Santa Barbara.​\n\nThe war in Europe had been under way for a year and was going badly for Britain. After his wedding Olivier wanted to help the war effort and ended up making a few propaganda films for Britain, starting with That Hamilton Woman in which he played opposite his new wife Vivien Leigh.\n\nVivien Leigh and Lawrence Olivier in film That Hamilton film, 1941\n\nIn 1943, at the behest of the Ministry of Information, Olivier began working on Henry V. He ended up directing and producing, in addition to taking the title role.\n\nMeanwhile, he was asked to join the Old Vic company with his peer Ralph Richardson. The two actors would re-establish the company and gained international fame for themselves in the next few years.\n\nIn January 1947 Olivier began working on his second film as a director, Hamlet (1948), in which he also took the lead role. The film became a critical and commercial success in Britain and abroad, and became the first non-American film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, while Olivier won the Award for Best Actor.\n\nIn 1948 Olivier led the Old Vic company on a six-month tour of Australia and New Zealand. He played Richard III, Sir Peter Teazle in Sheridan's The School for Scandal and Antrobus in Thornton Wilder's The Skin of Our Teeth, appearing alongside Leigh in the latter two plays.\n\nBy the end of the Australian tour, both Leigh and Olivier were exhausted and ill. Later he would comment that he \"lost Vivien\" in Australia, a reference to Leigh's affair with the Australian actor Peter Finch, whom the couple met during the tour. Shortly afterwards Finch moved to London, where Olivier auditioned him and put him under a long-term contract with Laurence Olivier Productions. Finch and Leigh's affair continued on and off for several years.\n\nIn January 1953 Leigh travelled to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to film Elephant Walk with Peter Finch. Shortly after filming started she suffered a breakdown, and returned to Britain where, between periods of incoherence, she told Olivier that she was in love with Finch, and had been having an affair with him.\n\nThe Oliviers' marriage was disintegrating during the late 1950s.\n\nLawrence Olivier and Vivien Leigh, 1957\n\nVivien Leigh became pregnant in 1956 and withdrew from the production of Noel Coward's comedy South Sea Bubble. The day after her final performance in the play she miscarried and entered a period of depression that lasted for months. The same year Olivier decided to direct and produce a film version of The Sleeping Prince, retitled The Prince and the Showgirl. Instead of appearing with Leigh, he cast Marilyn Monroe as the showgirl. Although the filming was challenging because of Monroe's behaviour, the film was appreciated by the critics.\n\nLawrence Olivier, Vivien Leigh, Marilyn Monroe and her then husband Arthur Miller, 1957\n\nLawrence Olivier, Vivien Leigh, Marilyn Monroe and her then husband Arthur Miller, 1957\n\nLawrence Olivier, Marilyn Monroe and her then husband Arthur Miller, 1957\n\nLawrence Olivier and Marilyn Monroe, 1957\n\nIn May 1960 the Oliviers started divorce proceedings.\n\nIn March 1961, Lawrence Olivier married actress Joan Plowright, with whom he had three children.\n\nLawrence Olivier with his third wife actress Joan Plowright\n\nIn August of 1962, Olivier became National Theater's first director.\n\nIn his decade in charge of the National, Olivier acted in thirteen plays and directed eight. One of the plays, Othello, was released as a film in 1965, which earned four Academy Award nominations, including another for Best Actor for Olivier.\n\nVivien Leigh died in July 1967. At about this time Olivier began a long struggle against a succession of illnesses. He was treated for prostate cancer and, during rehearsals for his production of Chekhov's Three Sisters he was hospitalised with pneumonia.\n\n​Olivier spent the last 15 years of his life securing his finances and dealing with deteriorating health, which included thrombosis and dermatomyositis, a degenerative muscle disorder. Professionally, and to provide financial security, he made a series of advertisements for Polaroid cameras in 1972, although he stipulated that they must never be shown in Britain; he also took a number of cameo film roles. Olivier's move from leading parts to supporting and cameo roles came about because his poor health meant he could not get the necessary long insurance for larger parts, with only short engagements in films available.\n\n​In the mid-1970s Olivier became increasingly involved in television work, a medium of which he was initially dismissive.\n\nIn 1978 he appeared in the film The Boys from Brazil for which he received his eleventh Academy Award nomination. Although he did not win the Oscar, he was presented with an Honorary Award for his lifetime achievement.\n\nLawrence Olivier in Brideshead Revisited with Jeremy Irons and Anthony Andrews\n\nOlivier continued working in film and television into the 1980s. In 1981 he appeared as Lord Marchmain in Brideshead Revisited, winning another Emmy, and the following year he received his tenth and last BAFTA nomination in the television adaptation of John Mortimer's stage play A Voyage Round My Father.\n\nOlivier's final screen appearance was as an elderly, wheelchair-bound soldier in Derek Jarman's 1989 film War Requiem.\n\nAfter being ill for the last 22 years of his life, Lawrence Olivier died of kidney failure on 11 July 1989 aged 82 at his home near Steyning, West Sussex. His cremation was held three days later​.\n\nFurther interest\n\n​Articles\n\nVideos"
