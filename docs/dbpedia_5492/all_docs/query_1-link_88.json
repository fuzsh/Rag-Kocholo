        "text": "Jake Gyllenhaal is an attorney accused of murder in the Apple TV+ limited series “Presumed Innocent,” which is based on the Scott Turow novel.\n\nHere’s who plays who in the rest of the cast and where you might have seen the cast before. Where appropriate, we’ve also listed who played the character in the 1990 movie that starred Harrison Ford, but not all the characters in the series line up with those in the movie.\n\nThe first two episodes premiered on June 12 and subsequent episodes debut on Wednesdays through July 24, when the killer will be revealed in the series finale.\n\nJake Gyllenhaal as Rusty Sabich\n\nThe “Zodiac” star plays Chicago prosecutor Rusty Sabich, who is accused of the brutal murder of his mistress Carolyn Polhemus who was also his colleague. Gyllenhaal recently starred in the “Road House” remake and will return for its sequel. In the 1990 movie, Harrison Ford played this role.\n\nRenate Reinsve as Carolyn Polhemus\n\nThe Norwegian actress, who broke out in the international hit “The Worst Person in the World,” plays Carolyn Polhemus, a prosecutor who was having an affair with Rusty, but broke things off shortly before her murder. Greta Scacchi played this part in the 1990 movie, when the character was seen as more ambitious and less sympathetic.\n\nPeter Sarsgaard as Tommy Molto\n\nSarsgaard, who is Gyllenhaal’s brother-in-law in real life, has previously starred in “The Lost Daughter” (directed by his wife and Jake’s sister, Maggie Gyllenhaal), “Jackie,” “An Education” and “Kinsey.” Here, he plays Rusty’s legal rival Tommy Molto, who is determined to prove that Rusty is guilty of Carolyn’s murderer. Joe Grifasi of “Evil” and “Lodge 49” played Molto in the 1990 film.\n\nRuth Negga as Barbara Sabich\n\nRuth Negga, who was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for her role in the 2016 biopic “Loving,” plays Rusty’s wife, Barbara. She took Rusty back after his affair with Carolyn, but did not know that the relationship had started up again. She stands by Rusty when he is arrested, but her support is wavering. Bonnie Bedelia played Barbara in the 1990 movie.\n\nBill Camp as Raymond Horgan\n\nThe veteran actor, who you might know from “The Queen’s Gambit,” “Dark Waters” or “The Joker,” plays Rusty’s mentor who reluctantly agrees to represent him when he is charged with murder. The character was played by Brian Dennehy in the 1990 film.\n\nO-T Fagbenle as Nico Della Guardia\n\nThe actor, who plays the city’s newly elected top prosecutor, told TVLine he based his unusual voice on the smug villain in “Ghostbusters.” “I started reading him and I just thought, ‘Oh, he’s so pompous and so up himself…I happened to be watching ‘Ghostbusters,’ and the bad guy” — Walter Peck, played in boo-hiss fashion by William Atherton — “has this really fun way of saying, like, ‘Do you have a permit to…?’ And it just grates at you. So I started developing this affectation.”\n\nFagbenle plays Luke, the husband of Elisabeth Moss’ character on “The Handmaid’s Tale,” and portrayed Barack Obama in the 2022 series “The First Lady.”\n\nNana Mensah as Det. Alana Rodriguez\n\nDetective Rodriguez initially helps Rusty with the murder investigation — until he becomes the prime suspect. Mensah starred in, wrote and directed “Queen of Glory,” which earned her several nominations, including Best First Feature from the Independent Spirit Awards.\n\nChase Infiniti as Jaden Sabich\n\nJaden is Rusty and Barbara’s daughter, whose world is shaken when she learns that her father cheated on her mom and even worse, might be a murderer. This is her first project. She’ll also be seen in Paul Thomas Anderson’s next film, which is still untitled.\n\nKingston Rumi Southwick as Kyle Sabich\n\nKyle is Rusty and Barbara’s son, who is more suspicious of his dad than his sister is. Southwick previously appeared in the 2013 film “9 Full Moons.”\n\nMark Harelik as Liam Reynolds\n\nCarolyn and Rusty scored a conviction for Liam Reynolds, who is now in prison for the vicious murder of a woman named Bunny Davis. Since Carolyn was killed in almost exactly the same way, he can’t be responsible, or can he? Harelik’s credits include the films “42,” “Trumbo” and “Jurassic Park III,” and the series “Preacher” and “The Morning Show.”\n\nLily Rabe as Dr. Liz Rush\n\nDr. Rush is Rusty’s psychiatrist, who sometimes also counsels Barbara. Rabe is known for the film, “Miss Stevens,” “American Horror Story” and for playing murder victim Betty Gore in the HBO Max series “Love & Death.”\n\nGabby Beans as Mya\n\nMya is a lawyer brought in by Raymond to help with Rusty’s case. Beans has previously co-starred on “Ray Donovan” and “House of Cards,” and has a recurring role on “Blue Bloods” as Cora Felton.\n\nSarunas J. Jackson as Clifton\n\nClifton is a handsome bartender who Barbara is attracted to and a perfect candidate if she wants to have a revenge fling. Jackson’s TV credits include “Insecure,” “Clipped” and “Good Trouble.”\n\nElizabeth Marvel as Lorraine Horgan\n\nThe actress, who plays Raymond Horgan’s wife Lorraine, is married to Bill Camp in real life as well. Lorraine is more inclined to believe the worst about Rusty and doesn’t want Raymond to represent him in court. Marvel has been in “House of Cards,” “Mrs. Davis,” “Homeland,” “Love & Death” and “The Dropout.”\n\nTate Birchmore as Michael Caldwell\n\nTate Birchmore plays Michael Caldwell, Carolyn’s estranged teenage son, who is convinced that Rusty killed his mother. Birchmore’s previous credits include the Jennifer Garner movie “Peppermint,” and appearances on “Adam Ruins Everything” and “Winning Time.”\n\nVirginia Kull as Eugenia\n\nVirginia Kull plays Eugenia, a colleague of Tommy and Rusty’s, who was one of the few people who knew about Rusty and Carolyn’s affair. The actress previously appeared in the series “Gracepoint,” “The Looming Tower” and “Percy Jackson and the Olympians.”\n\nJames Hiroyuki Liao as Herbert Kumagai\n\nHerbert Kumagai is the short-tempered medical examiner, who isn’t fond of Rusty or Tommy. The actor who plays him, James Hiroyuki Liao, is best known for playing Albert Nguyen in HBO’s “Barry.” He has also appeared on “24,” “Bones” and “Prison Break.”\n\nNoma Dumezweni as Judge Lyttle\n\nNoma Dumezweni plays Judge Lyttle, the judge presiding over Rusty’s murder trial. Dumezweni also appeared in Season 1 of Netflix’s “The Watcher” and HBO’s “The Undoing.” She played Hermione Granger in the original West End Palace Theatre production of “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,” which earned her a Laurence Olivier Award in 2017. She reprised the role in the original Broadway production and was nominated for a Tony in 2018."
