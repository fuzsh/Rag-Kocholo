Selznick, facing the imminent principal shooting of the greatest gamble of his career – the ﬁlm of Gone With the Wind, Margaret Mitchell’s worldwide\n\nbestseller of the American Civil War – after a two-year highly publicised search, had still not cast the most sought-after leading role in cinema history, Scarlett O’Hara. Since his early days in silent movies and through more recent adaptations of major classics (Greta Garbo in Anna Karenina and Ronald Colman in A Tale of Two Cities) Selznick had stressed the importance of casting, especially of female roles. He once wrote to his business partner John (“Jock”) Hay Whitney: Sometimes you can miscast a part and get away with it: but there are certain stories where miscasting of the girl will mean not simply that the role is badly played but that the whole story doesn’t come off.\n\nHe had secured the public’s choice of Clark Gable as Mitchell’s rafﬁsh heartthrob Rhett Butler alongside Olivia de Havilland as Scarlett’s cousin Melanie, and Leslie Howard as the heroine’s more conventional love interest, Ashley Wilkes, but he was uncomfortably aware that a miscast Scarlett could ruin all his ambitions and plans. He had considered and rejected most of the established star actresses suggested – Bette Davis, Tallulah Bankhead, Katharine Hepburn included – and still had in reserve three well-known possibles, of whom Paulette Goddard led the ﬁeld, but from the outset Selznick had wanted to have “a new girl” as Scarlett; the nationwide search for an unknown – over 1,500 seen, many screen-tested – had of course provided an avalanche of free advance publicity but it had always for Selznick been more than a stunt. Although he was a voracious reader and hired top scriptwriters (the dramatist Sidney Howard for Gone With the Wind), Selznick, like many\n\nPrologue\n\nxvii\n\nwho cut their teeth in silents, thought in images, knowing how potent the initial perception of a character is, especially one originally from a famous book, which could dictate an audience’s reaction. From his ﬁrst reading of the novel, he had his Scarlett vivid in his mind and with the ﬁrst scenes with his cast scheduled for January 1939 he was frustrated, contemplating what he saw as “the greatest failure of my entire career”, expressed in one of his notorious lengthy memos to the ﬁlm’s director, George Cukor: I am still hoping against hope . . . If we ﬁnally wind up with any of the stars we are testing we must regard ourselves as absolute failures at digging up talent, as going against the most violently expressed wish for a new personality in an important role in the history of American stage or screen.\n\nOne month after this cri de coeur, the role was cast in an episode apposite for a ﬁlm of epic sweep and bold emotions and as colourful as anything in Mitchell’s book or out of the earlier Selznick ﬁlm, A Star is Born. Selznick’s image of Scarlett was taken directly from the novel’s description of this headstrong survivor, the iconic Southern belle with an “arresting face”, “pale green eyes without a touch of hazel” and “magnolia-white skin”. The chosen Scarlett met these criteria; some described her as intrepid, occasionally wilful like Scarlett, and although she had achieved some success in England on stage and screen, she was certainly “a new girl” in America. However, she was no Southern belle (in her one previous ﬁlm requiring an accent, St Martin’s Lane, her cockney barely passes muster). She was not even American, let alone “of French and Irish descent”. Selznick needed to clear the backlot at Culver City for building the principal sets for Gone With the Wind – including the plantation house of the O’Hara clan, Tara – and so scheduled for December the incineration of old movie-sets for the ﬁlming of the burning of Atlanta by General Sherman’s troops. Towards the end of the shoot, late in the evening, Selznick met for the ﬁrst time the British actress Vivien Leigh, brought to the ﬁlming by Selznick’s agent-brother Myron along with his client, a more established British actor, Laurence Olivier. Vivien had arrived the previous day, ostensibly to see her lover Olivier. Almost instantly Selznick and Cukor were convinced that she could be their Scarlett. Vivien was then 25, married with a daughter, and Olivier, seven years her senior, was married with a son. They had been lovers for two years and had been miserable apart recently while Olivier ﬁlmed Wuthering Heights in Hollywood. Selznick later said of their meeting: “I’ll never recover from that ﬁrst look.” He was a producer-auteur before the concept of ﬁlm “authorship” had been invented, a classic control-freak. Cukor too, who had said prior to the\n\nxviii\n\nDark Star\n\nlong “search for Scarlett” that “The girl I select must be possessed of the devil and charged with electricity”, was immediately intrigued by Vivien but in effect the decision would be Selznick’s (“Great ﬁlms are made in their every detail according to the vision of one man”). There was, however, one crucial difference between the actress and Mitchell’s heroine, encapsulated in the opening ﬁve words of her novel: “Scarlett O’Hara was not beautiful.” Vivien Leigh was very beautiful indeed. She died in 1967, late on a Friday evening and so too late for Saturday’s newspaper deadlines. On Sunday the normally sober Observer bannered the news on its front page above seven contrasted photographs: “Vivien Leigh, the Greatest Beauty of her Time, Dead at 53.” On Monday, newspapers worldwide heavily featured the collapse of her fabled marriage to Olivier in 1960 and her long struggle with manic depression (before Bipolar Disorder was the preferred term) alongside the stress on her looks, often barely mentioning a career of striking range while concentrating essentially on her two Oscar-winning performances – Scarlett and Blanche Du Bois in A Streetcar Named Desire. Other great beauties of her day – society’s Lady Diana Cooper, Gladys Cooper (both her friends), Ava Gardner, Greta Garbo – could not match her range and offered no competition on stage. Truly great beauties – Lily Elsie, Maxine Elliott, Lillie Langtry, Elizabeth Taylor – rarely make great stage performers, largely because they do not have to be. One of the great theatre names of the twentieth century, Edith Evans, off stage unremarkable but with an alchemical ability to assume radiance on stage, used to say that beauty was “the primitive passport” to success in the theatre. Vivien’s ﬁrst major success in England was due, as she acknowledged, to that passport. But no career enduring over three decades, covering work on stage in Shakespeare, Shaw, Chekhov, Tennessee Williams, Jean Giraudoux, Noe¨l Coward, Terence Rattigan and a Broadway musical – a range wider than many actresses of her generation – alongside an outstanding screen career, can be sustained solely on looks. She had luck in her career, as she never denied, but bad luck haunted her too and it seems, always, that she constantly had to attempt to escape various shadows. Not the least of them was that beauty. The photographer Florence Entwistle (“Vivienne”) claimed that she was “the most beautiful woman in Britain, if not the world”, echoed by her favourite photographer, Angus McBean – “She was the most beautiful woman I ever photographed and remained so, I believe, up until the haunting last sitting just before her death”, while to David Niven she\n\nPrologue\n\nxix\n\nwas simply “the most beautiful woman I ever saw outside an art gallery”. Appraisals of her beauty were intriguingly varied. The Hungarian-born movie producer Alexander Korda could not categorise her; he liked to contract “types” such as the “exotic”, a “beetch” or an “English rose” and turned Vivien down in 1935 accordingly, only becoming interested when she scored a major stage success – she was just not a “type”. She could, if required, project a dewy inge´nue innocence but had an underlying quality of something more dangerous, less “English rose”. It was not difﬁcult for her to suggest a more exotic allure; once, when seeing a McBean photograph of her, strikingly shadowed and with a spray of camellias over one ear, Olivier commented that she could pass for a “Javanese tart”. In an era when the ideal of home-grown beauty was an Anglo-Saxon demure delicacy Vivien was not immediately classiﬁable or ﬁxed in her time, as fellow actress Gladys Cooper noted (“I considered her the most beautiful woman of her age and to me her beauty was not of any period”). In her centenary year (2013), critic Laura Thompson wrote perceptively that behind the crystalline perfection “she was always more interesting than the pretty-girl roles she was given early on . . . her smile had a quality of perverse intrigue”. Many people blessed by beauty simply take it for granted, like having red hair or big feet; Vivien always shrugged off compliments and was wearied by critics’ constant mentions of her beauty, turning it into Byron’s “fatal gift”. The “primitive passport” which gave her initial theatre fame led at once to a British screen career and it was her looks which journalists stressed (“the loveliest sight on the British screen so far”) and struggled to describe: The face a triangle, gleaming palely in the frame of feathery dark hair growing upwards, faun-like. The bone-structure will make artists rush to set it down. But the tilted nose, the tender curve of the mouth, deep eyes lifted at the corners, dark in distance, revealing themselves as grey-green lamps, obviously ﬂoodlit, her young, touching smile, will make the public rush to set the face down in their memories.\n\nThe art historian and connoisseur of beauty, Kenneth Clark, was another who understood that the bones and planes of her face were the key to her looks but he always felt that her outward appearance was complemented by the inner quality of her style. His friend, international art expert Bernard Berenson knew Vivien in his old age and agreed with Clark, addressing her as “Dearest of beautiful and life-enhancing women”. Without that interior quality – “her beauty was somehow both inside and outside” according to theatre producer\n\nxx\n\nDark Star\n\nToby Rowland – beauty can be purely passive, rarely a true asset on stage or even on screen. This was the special quality valued by Berenson and so many of her friends. One of them, director Glen Byam Shaw, who knew her for over 30 years, tried to deﬁne that essence in a 1953 letter: You have the ability to get the best out of life. It is a wonderful gift. Diana has it also – I mean Diana Duff Cooper. When I was on tour with her we used to have such times together – she could make drinking a cup of lukewarm coffee in Donnydoonhead a delightful event in one’s life. The answer is, I suppose, that you both have “magic”.\n\nByam Shaw could not have known that his letter, sent to Vivien on location in Ceylon, would arrive just as one of the most explosive episodes triggered by the Bipolar condition from which she suffered (it was as yet unnamed) was beginning. That gaiety of the heart and her beauty were mixed blessings. She said herself: People think that if you look fairly reasonable you can’t possibly act . . . I think beauty can be a great handicap.\n\nEarly in her career her friend John Gielgud, seeing her in Max Beerbohm’s The Happy Hypocrite, found her “ravishing”, adding: I suppose your beauty will always be more hindrance than help to your acting. Almost incidentally either it blinds the critical faculty or produces a perverse determination to pick holes.\n\nGeorge Cukor felt the same (“a consummate actress, hampered by beauty”) while another American friend, the director/dramatist Garson Kanin, described her as: a stunner whose ravishing beauty often tended to obscure her staggering achievement as an actress . . . She was ambitious, persevering, serious, often inspired.\n\nVivien actually made comparatively few ﬁlms (19 in a 30-year career) but she had very rapidly assimilated the screen’s special demands; her early British ﬁlms, made at a time when there were few native directors of major talent, still had some inspired, mostly e´migre´ cinematographers from whom she absorbed an unquantiﬁable amount. Most British actors then tended to patronise the cinema – Ralph Richardson’s attitude (“You sell to the cinema what you learned in the theatre”) was representative – but while Vivien came to love the theatre more she was too intelligent to short-change ﬁlm work. Even in some of these less than classic early efforts, many of them low-budget and quickly\n\nPrologue\n\nxxi\n\nshot, a latent vitality, a sense of the complexity of a nature both fragile and infused with a tensile strength, is communicated. Monkey-quick, she grasped the essence of screen acting remarkably swiftly (much ahead of Olivier) – that above all the camera photographs thought, that the eyes are the index to interior life. Her eyes were what immediately struck both Selznick and Cukor; the latter had said from the outset on Gone With the Wind that he wanted someone “with ﬁre in her eyes”. Directors and cameramen mostly loved to photograph Vivien’s eyes – many of her ﬁlms contain memorable close-ups – and virtually all the obituaries and features covering her death mentioned them in their focus on her beauty, masking the question of her talent, a lingering shadow. An even longer shadow was – and similarly remains – that cast by Olivier. When they met he had made ﬁlms in Hollywood and England, none markedly successful; in the theatre, apart from supporting Noe¨l Coward in his Private Lives and an exuberantly athletic portrayal of a John Barrymore-inspired actor in the American comedy Theatre Royal he had had many failures but was now beginning his rise to classical stature alternating Romeo and Mercutio with John Gielgud in the latter’s production of Romeo and Juliet in London, going on to consolidate his position with a string of major Shakespeare roles, including Hamlet, at the Old Vic. Their affair blazed into a consuming mutual passion in Korda’s ﬁlm Fire Over England (1937) before they acted on stage together for the ﬁrst time when Vivien played Ophelia to his Hamlet at Elsinore, a miserable time for Vivien’s husband Leigh and Olivier’s wife Jill, neither of whom agreed to immediate divorce. The couple left separately for America in late 1938, Olivier for Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights while Vivien followed later, desperately missing him, but also conscious that Scarlett remained uncast. They were ﬁnally able to marry – in California in 1940 – returning to England after ﬁlming Lady Hamilton together. Over the next two decades, rarely working apart on stage, they built up a joint reputation as “The Oliviers”, a spotlit First Couple of the British stage, like Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne (“The Lunts”) in America or JeanLouis Barrault and Madeleine Renaud in France. Both continued ﬁlm careers; Olivier reinforced his heroic national status in his fanfare of native patriotism, the screen Henry V (1945) which he also directed, followed by a ﬁlm Hamlet during which he was knighted. Vivien made further ﬁlms but also established a formidable record of stage performances ranging from the vaudeville of Thornton Wilder’s The Skin of Our Teeth to Tennessee Williams’s A Streetcar Named Desire in London and then on screen as the fading Blanche Du Bois, one\n\nxxii\n\nDark Star\n\nof the richest (and most demanding) female roles in the theatre. Beﬁtting their status, as the country began to emerge from postwar austerity they made a quasi-royal pairing for the Festival of Britain in Shaw’s Caesar and Cleopatra and Shakespeare’s Antony and Cleopatra and then gave London a contrasting modern regal frivol with Terence Rattigan’s The Sleeping Prince for Coronation year in 1953. Their private lives were similarly on the glamorously grand scale at the restored medieval country estate of Notley Abbey which became an English equivalent of William Randolph Hearst’s Californian San Simeon (Citizen Kane’s Xanadu) with weekend parties of West End and Broadway actors, Hollywood celebrities and writers, designers, politicians and composers. Everything the Oliviers did was news; Vivien’s miscarriages in 1944 and 1956 were splashed across the popular press, although Fleet Street in the 1950s was less intrusive than today and so relatively little of the backstage whispers as the marriage began to crumble under its various strains found its way into the newspapers. After rumours and speculation of affairs on both sides they divorced and Olivier remarried – a third actress, the younger Joan Plowright, with whom he had three children. Vivien, although forming a Last Attachment in the 1960s with actor John Merivale, never remarried. Most of her postdivorce work was in a kind of exile – in Australia or America – although she was about to return to the West End at the time of her sudden death. Olivier had a whole crowded ﬁnal act left to play, putting the seal on his reputation as the greatest actor of his time. A son of the cloth, he had always regarded the theatre with a quasi-religious zeal. The notion of a National Theatre – of which he became the ﬁrst Director in 1963 – had been special for him for years and he regarded heading it as a charge amounting to genuine National Service. Based at his beloved Old Vic until moving to the South Bank under Peter Hall, inevitably Olivier’s tenure had troughs but its peaks were often awesome including some of his later great performances (as Othello and, in Long Day’s Journey Into Night, as the old actor James Tyrone, in which Vivien might, had circumstances been otherwise, have played his wife). Rarely latterly free from illnesses, any one of which might have poleaxed lesser men, his National decade was an heroic achievement. Olivier received the most elaborate Memorial Service accorded any actor, in Westminster Abbey with every possible member of the great and good in attendance, scored by his old colleague William Walton. Vivien’s Memorial Service more than 20 years previously was crowded too, but in a smaller venue (St Martin-in-the-Fields) with decidedly less pomp and circumstance. By the\n\nPrologue\n\nxxiii\n\ntime of Olivier’s death in 1989 she had become, if not forgotten (remastered and reissued versions of Gone With the Wind and Streetcar ensured that), deﬁnitely less valued. Olivier’s reputation had cast a long shadow long before Vivien’s death. Garson Kanin noted in the 1940s: It must be maddening for her, a young actress at the peak of her powers and popularity, to ﬁnd herself in the position of a hanger-on who has come along for the ride.\n\nOlivier in his autobiography – rather less revelatory than its title Confessions of an Actor (1982) might suggest – wrote of his detestation of this attitude: “Critics should not go on for ever letting their judgments be distorted by her great beauty”, a veiled dig at one particular critic. Critics and performers can be friendly; the Oliviers were close to Alan Dent who reviewed for The Manchester Guardian then The News Chronicle and assisted Olivier on the texts of his Shakespearean ﬁlms. The critic/actor relationship can be awkward, however. It is in retrospect ironic that the critic thought by Olivier to “distort” Vivien’s work most damagingly should, after the Olivier divorce, work closely alongside him at the National Theatre. Kenneth Tynan was without question a major ﬁgure in postwar British theatre, the ﬁnest dramatic critic since Bernard Shaw; an exhortation to inspiration above his desk read: “Rouse tempers, goad and lacerate, raise whirlwinds”, all of which he did in prose of ﬁrecracker brilliance. He aimed to be a war correspondent, not a necrologist; he wanted to blast what he saw as a fossilised 1950s London theatre of trivial comedies, thrillers and parishpumpery revue into extinction. Like Shaw’s attacks on “Sardoodledom” (the “well-made” plays following the style of Victorien Sardou) in order to champion Ibsen, so Tynan wanted to raze the ﬂim-ﬂam of what he called French-windowed “Loamshire”-set plays to the ground as he encouraged new radical writing and Bertolt Brecht. A lifelong atheist, he relished causes, campaigns and crusades. In his younger years he was ﬁred by great heroic acting, the work of magnetic ﬁgures such as Donald Wolﬁt or, above all, Laurence Olivier. For Tynan, Olivier was the supreme modern actor and his worship (it was nothing less) remained constant even as he shifted his dramatic preferences to more overtly political drama, inspired by his Brechtian conversion. He changed his views on some Olivier rivals; from the time that The Daily Telegraph suggested that Wolﬁt might be a potential head of a National Theatre – he viewed that position as reserved for Olivier – he switched to a relentless, at times gleefully savage, demolition of Wolﬁt’s performances.\n\nxxiv\n\nDark Star\n\nThere is no doubt about Tynan’s importance in redrawing the map of the British theatre, especially his championship of the New Drama appearing in the wake of Look Back in Anger in 1956, but some of his judgements were often wayward, and not a few of his obiter dicta were off target, occasionally troublingly so. Often behind his writing on actors there was a signally sadistic streak; actress Eileen Herlie, dismissed with whiplash vitriol, was an early victim. He always lauded Olivier’s pantherine vigour above the more poetic Gielgud (Olivier was, in Tynan’s view, the Burkean Sublime to Gielgud’s harmonious but inferior Beautiful). Sometimes actors could survive to point up the ﬂaws in Tynan’s judgements after he ceased regular theatre criticism. He had always insisted that Gielgud had little gift for modern work and rarely succeeded in comedy. This had never had solid foundations and was spectacularly undermined by later Gielgud performances in new plays, often very funny, by Alan Bennett, Harold Pinter and David Storey. Vivien had not that luck. She suffered, more than any other actor, from Tynan’s lash. He was practically reviewing her even before he was ofﬁcially a critic; in an introductory piece for the Daily Sketch he wrote that he longed to see his idol as Macbeth but preferably “with a more challenging Lady than his charming wife”. He reserved his most lethal, exquisitely phrased dismissals for her classical performances, seemingly at his most blistering on those widely praised by other critics and, notably, by fellow actors. There is no doubt that the cumulative impression conveyed by the most inﬂuential critic of his era has affected Vivien’s posthumous reputation. She was a different theatrical animal from Olivier but that does not make her a necessarily second-rate one. And she was a star on screen in a way Olivier never quite matched (possibly because he did not want to, ruthlessly competitive though he could be on stage). A true movie star is both actor and embodiment of his or her myth; Olivier’s sheer protean quality undercut that, but on ﬁlm so often Vivien deﬁnes screen stardom. The shadow of Tynan’s perspective was impossible for Vivien, who died so young, to break free from. But, 50 years on from her death, a scrutiny of her career should see that and other shadows recede, revealing her in a clearer light.\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nA Child of the Raj\n\nO\n\nne of Tynan’s weaker puns – admittedly from early in his career – was “We all make our own mystiques”. Not so in studio-era Hollywood, where the moguls fully moulded their “properties”, as they regarded their indentured talent, supervising every aspect of their image, capping teeth, altering colour and cut of hair, shaping brows, paying special attention to what Selznick called “the breastwork” of their female stars and monitoring their off-screen lives. They grasped that a genuine star is more than an actor; the public fuse what is on the screen with their perception of a star’s private life as shaped by their bosses and the media. So, from the outset of Vivien’s association with Selznick International Studios, a process of re-creation began. Initially the publicity machine presented her as a discovery, airbrushing from publicity most of her British work on stage and screen. Only when ﬁlming on Gone With the Wind was under way was mention of her previous experience made, referring only glancingly to a husband or child with not a whisper of her involvement with Olivier. As many similarities as possible between actress and character were stressed, often with scant regard for truth. Selznick wrote personally to Ed Sullivan, an inﬂuential columnist prior to his television career, just after Vivien was contracted, pointing out that although she was not American, a large part of the South would prefer that to casting a Yankee and that just as Scarlett’s parents were French and Irish, “identically, Miss Leigh’s parents are French and Irish”. This was complete invention. Question marks and vague half-truths have continued to hang over Vivien’s ancestry however, even in her biographies. Her father, Ernest Hartley, although he spent much of his early life in India where his daughter was born, was and remained a proud Yorkshireman from a family based originally for generations in Pontefract. Ernest’s father was an\n\n2\n\nDark Star\n\nindustrious civil service administrator; his wife Elizabeth, a butcher’s daughter from York, gave him seven children. The couple, following a peripatetic career taking them across England to Ireland and the Hebrides, retired to the Yorkshire seaside town of Bridlington. Vivien’s father was born during the family’s Scottish stay on the island of Islay in 1883. The youngest of the family, he grew up an adventurous boy, never especially academic and a popular extrovert. Like many younger sons of his generation he saw fewer opportunities at home than in some of the ﬂourishing outposts of the Empire, still in the early years of the twentieth century a mighty commercial network. He sailed for India in 1905. Calcutta then was the epicentre of the British Raj with its national administrative signiﬁcance at its height. The capital moved to Delhi in 1911 but Calcutta remained a clamorous, buoyant city to which Ernest was immediately attracted. Working as an exchange broker for the respected company of Pigott, Chapman & Co, he was highly popular amongst a wide range of friends, mostly fellow expatriates; he was enthusiastically sporty – mad about polo and cricket – and a passionate horseman, a regular at the Tollygunnga racetrack. He took to all the traditional pastimes of the British sahib; years later a contemporary of Ernest sent Vivien photographs of her father and his friends hunting in the Indian jungle, complete with solar topees, riﬂes and a retinue of native bearers, the epitome of privileged Raj life. His other consuming interest was the theatre; amateur dramatics were popular in that Maughamesque society and a particularly active group, the Calcutta Dramatic Society, presented a regular series of productions, often with Ernest in central roles, usually in the Grand Opera House, a splendid new building on the site of the old wooden theatre opposite the Hogg New Market. Ernest’s friend Geoffrey Martin was also a regular in the productions; his daughter Frances (“Mills”) Martin, later a friend of Vivien’s, remembered Ernest vividly: He was marvellous to have fun with. He had a histrionic ability to relate terrible jokes . . . He enjoyed ﬁshing and golﬁng and spending money in ﬂashy hotels. He was “hail fellow well met” but very much a fair weather friend.\n\nWithin a few years Ernest’s success at the brokerage ﬁrm was making him a rich young man and he began to contemplate taking a wife. Ernest always – before and after marriage – had an eye for a pretty face although there was not an unlimited number of attractive single girls of marriageable age in the circles in which he moved. But Ernest was instantly attracted when he was introduced to Gertrude Yackje, ﬁve years his junior, a beauty with thick brown hair, clear blue\n\nA Child of the Raj\n\n3\n\neyes and the most delicate magnolia-pale skin. Various accounts state that Gertrude had an Irish background, while other biographies claim that, like Ernest, she was Yorkshire born, even with a Bridlington connection. She had actually never left India. The facts are that Vivien’s mother was born (1888) in Darjeeling and met Ernest in Calcutta. There have been suggestions of a Parsee or Bengali heritage, although Yackje is not a common Parsee or Bengali name. Her mother Mary (ne´e Robinson) indeed was of Irish Catholic extraction but Gertrude also had Armenian blood, from her father’s side. Her Armenian ancestry can be traced back with certainty to Johannes Gabriel (“J.G.”) Yackje, who worked for a wealthy Armenian merchant, Jacob Eyoob, and who left Persia (now Iran) with his wife and young family for Calcutta in 1843. Life there proved different and difﬁcult; J.G. became an insolvent debtor only three years later before overcoming his setback to become an indigo merchant by the 1860s. His elder son Michael – Gertrude’s father – had been born in Persia and worked in Calcutta as an Assistant Goods Clerk for the East India Railway, but his younger son Gabriel was less fortunate. He is listed in 1867, aged 30, in the Annual Returns for Patients Treated in the Asylum for Europeans in Calcutta, described as suffering from “mania chronic (cause unknown)”. It seems likely that Vivien never knew of her great-uncle’s condition, a family secret of which Gertrude never spoke. Later, when Vivien’s mental problems were surfacing, Olivier asked Gertrude and Ernest if there was any genetic history of such illness in either family and was forcefully told that there was no question of any such problems. Whatever Gabriel’s eventual history, Michael by the time of his death in 1893 – Gertrude was ﬁve – was described as “a landed proprietor”. Gertrude had an older sister, Mary, who shortly after their father’s death married Percy Feilman, a businessman who later changed the family name to Fielding and it seems that Mary and Percy supported her mother and Gertrude. Eight children were born to Mary and Percy, but Mary died in childbirth in 1918 giving birth to Alexander (“Xan”) Fielding, later a noted travel writer and Vivien’s cousin, although they met rarely. Xan remained always uncertain of his maternal family’s true origins; he recalled one of his aunts, Orlene, as notably darkskinned and came to believe that his grandmother Mary might have been mixed race Parsee Indian, unaware of her Armenian background. The lack of much deﬁnite information chimes with the family background; at that time, to both the British in India and pure Indians, mixed-race people were stigmatised, their origins often sanitised or disguised which explains the frequent accenting of the family name to Yackje´ and the use of the Robinson maternal name (Gertrude’s marriage certiﬁcate is in her real name of Yackje).\n\n4\n\nDark Star\n\nThe circumstances parallel those of another actress, one who acted later with Olivier and married Alexander Korda, Merle Oberon – ne´e Estelle Thompson. She was born in Bombay two years before Vivien to a EurasianMaori mother and a British engineer. Later she reinvented herself, claiming Tasmanian origins while her mother during her lifetime passed as Oberon’s maid. How much Ernest knew of Gertrude’s background is unclear. He seemed to possess fewer of the prejudices of most of his circle and was determined to marry this self-possessed beauty. The courtship was brief; Gertrude was liked by Ernest’s friends including his two closest, Geoffrey Martin and John Thomson (“Tommy”), a drily entertaining Scot of independent means who made a good double act with the exuberant Ernest, often prompting his anecdotes and accounts of sporting triumphs. Calcutta had a lively social scene, sections of which reacted ultra-conventionally when it became known that Ernest and Gertrude planned to marry. Geoffrey Martin’s son, Hugh, remembered that Ernest experienced a degree of social ostracism, because of Gertrude’s perceived mixed-race status, from the pillars of the Bengal Club and the Saturday Club, from both of which he was obliged to resign, despite the support of Tommy and Geoffrey. Ernest wanted to marry in England and he sailed with Gertrude and her mother Mary in late 1911 to London where the women settled in Holland Park, occasionally visiting Ernest’s Bridlington family, before the wedding the following April at Kensington’s Catholic Church of Our Lady of Victories. They then sailed back to India, landing in Bombay before going on to Calcutta to begin their married life on the sub-continent. They came to make a popular pair in Calcutta’s European society. Although Gertrude would never be noted for a strong sense of humour she was always interested in others and a good hostess. The social climate was in ﬂux; Gertrude became a proﬁcient golfer and Ernest continued his game-hunting and sports. Soon the doors of the city’s exclusive clubs reopened to him and as Calcutta’s mercantile boom went on Ernest’s income allowed for a comfortable lifestyle with a large house and extensive garden, fully staffed, in the fashionable suburb of Alipore. Gertrude was pregnant in the spring of 1913. Traditionally the British left the baking cities for the cooler hill-stations in summer and in May the Hartleys left for Darjeeling, quite an adventurous journey, by train to Siliguri then an eight-hour ride on the packed Darjeeling Himalayan Railway (known as The Toy Train) on a meandering track, often climbing at a steep gradient. Known as\n\nA Child of the Raj\n\n5\n\n“Queen of the Hills”, 7,000 feet up in the mountains, Darjeeling in 1913 was a sleepy hill town, occasionally – with Nepal off limits – the base for Himalayan expeditions, with breathtaking views of Everest and Kanchenjunga. The Hartleys had rented a comfortable house, Shannon Lodge, a traditional two-storeyed building with a wide sloping roof in a garden of shrubs and tall trees, all occasionally – in an Eastern version of Brigadoon when Darjeeling’s rapidly shifting weather saw dense mists almost mystically sudden in arrival and dispersal alike – wrapped in a romantic cloud. Ernest returned to work once Gertrude was settled with the house’s servants; there was little for her to do except a round of golf with other wives from Calcutta or resting in the garden overlooking the hills. She was happy to sit looking over one of the most beautiful views in the world, more than half-believing the ages-old superstition that if a pregnant woman gazes in silent contemplation of the transcendental majesty of Kanchenjunga she is guaranteed that her child will be graced by beauty. Gertrude may later have told her daughter of that superstition. She certainly invented another story to surround Vivien’s birth. On the evening of 5 November, there were ﬁreworks for Guy Fawkes’ Night lighting up the skies, the bangs and crackles punctuating Gertrude’s labour pains and her baby’s ﬁrst cries. On subsequent early birthdays, often spent in Darjeeling, when the ﬁreworks began and Vivien asked why people were celebrating, Gertrude would tell her “It’s for your birthday, darling.” Ernest had returned for the birth and shortly afterwards the expanded family returned to Calcutta. She was christened Vivian Mary Hartley; the name “Vivien Leigh” resulted from her ﬁrst London stage success. It was in many ways an idyllic early childhood; Gertrude had supervised the creation of a beautiful garden in Alipore Road, full of jacaranda trees, rhododendrons and lilies, an oasis surely triggering Vivien’s passion for ﬂowers, their colours and for gardening. She loved all the activities involved in planting and nurturing shrubs (roses especially) and ﬂowers, becoming a proper “hands-on” gardener, remarkably knowledgeable. She relished arranging ﬂowers in her homes, dressing-rooms and hotel suites and was forever sending them to friends for opening nights or birthdays, like Tennessee Williams’s heroine in her penultimate ﬁlm, The Roman Spring of Mrs Stone (“Flora, the goddess of Springtime was not more lavish in a dispersal of ﬂowers”). From the outset, she was a signally alert, active child, rarely sleeping for long; her concerned mother took her to their doctor who diagnosed her as simply “not a sleepy baby”. (Olivier, who suffered – at times in extremis – from\n\n6\n\nDark Star\n\nVivien’s insomnia, used wryly to say that that would be a good title for Vivien’s biography). Idolised she may have been by both parents but she was not indulgently spoilt. Many mothers in that society left their children to be more or less wholly raised by their ayahs but Gertrude, raising Vivien to be a devout Catholic, hired an English nanny of the faith while her early education was from Gertrude. She was the one who taught her to read, a remarkably easy process; by the age of ﬁve Vivien was an eager reader, especially fond of Kipling (the Just So Stories her favourite), Lewis Carroll and Greek legends. Her religious instruction also was mainly her mother’s responsibility; the days revolved round the markers of Mass, confession and prayer. To train her powers of observation, Gertrude introduced Vivien to “Kim’s Game” – from those mental exercises used to hone the brain-agility of the British Intelligence in Kipling’s novel Kim. Last thing before lights out at bedtime Gertrude would arrange some objects in a pattern on a tray, remove them and have Vivien recreate the pattern in the morning. Gertrude was determined to give her child every advantage prior to formal education. Above all, she instilled in her a preternaturally structured set of manners – to be a good guest one has to consider one’s host, while a good host must give ﬁrst attention to the guests. And one had to be polite and considerate of others on all occasions. The summers saw Gertrude and Vivien return to Darjeeling. Vivien said later of India that “I have only confused impressions of its beauty and of the gaiety of life there”, but those periods spent cradled in the pine and oak-covered hills looking down to the river, the occasional excursions to beauty-spots like Senchal Lake, ringed by wild orchids and azaleas, fed by a mountain stream, all spurred the child’s imagination. Sometimes there were treats in Darjeeling town, with exotic smells from the sweet-vendors – burrakee-ball (“old ladies’ hair”), a kind of candyﬂoss, or armsuth, a toffee made from dried mangoes. There was a memorable journey on ponies in the early dark to Tiger Hill on the edge of town, climbing a tower to its balcony to wait in the starlit dark until slowly dawn rose over the Himalayas like the curtain rising on a play. Ernest in Calcutta was usually happy too. He and Gertrude had been through the deeply distressing experience two years after Vivien’s birth when Gertrude had twins who lived for only a week, but his roving eye soon regained its glint. Casual adulteries were prevalent in that society and, to an often surprising degree, tolerated by many of the wives. The devoutly Catholic Gertrude could not use contraception or countenance divorce but friends grasped that she knew of and accepted Ernest’s “ﬂings”, often when she was in Darjeeling. If no wit, Gertrude must have had at least a sense of mischief; one\n\nA Child of the Raj\n\n7\n\nwell-recollected incident told of how she organised an elaborate formal dinnerparty at their home, arranging for Ernest to arrive shortly after the guests were seated, entering to ﬁnd that every woman present, each escorted by her husband, had been, on one occasion or another, a lover of his. If Gertrude for Vivien was associated with discipline and order, her father carried a nimbus of fun, ebullience and – as children can intuit – subversion. Ernest liked to involve Vivien in his amateur theatricals, sometimes taking her with him to dress-rehearsals of Theatre Royal or Opera House productions – The Scarlet Pimpernel in which he played the villainous Chauvelin, or Gilbert and Sullivan – and teaching her to ride before she was given her own pony. The Hartleys had planned an English trip in 1914, taking Vivien to meet the Bridlington relations, but the outbreak of war prevented that. Ernest joined the Indian Cavalry, initially training remounts for Allied troops in Mesopotamia before a transfer to Bangalore in southern India. Gertrude and Vivien moved to be closer to him, renting a villa in the hill town of Ootacamund, always full of English military men. The Ootacamund memsahibs were formidably organised and always had a full calendar of social events, dances, concerts and fetes. An Ootacamund audience witnessed Vivien’s ﬁrst public stage appearance, one marked by the determined will that would stamp her career. In the few photographs of her then her gaze to the camera is open, unafraid, slightly challenging. For the concert at which Vivien was scheduled to sing “Little Bo Peep” Gertrude had carefully coached her, making an effective costume of a muslin frock and bonnet ﬁnished off by a shepherdess’s crook trimmed with a large silk bow. It was a full house, pride of place occupied by Lady Willingdon, wife of the Governor of Madras. Vivien entered on cue to centre stage as rehearsed. The pianist’s hands were poised above the keyboard, as rehearsed, only to freeze as Vivien banged three times with her crook (not rehearsed) to announce in a ﬁrm, clear voice “I won’t sing. I shall recite.” From all accounts the spoken version brought the house down. The end of the war saw the Hartleys once more in Calcutta with the household’s full complement of staff ensuring its smooth running. There were occasional chauffeured trips into the city, sometimes to join Ernest for tifﬁn or ices, even allowing Vivien to see inside the majestic Bengal Club, rebuilt in 1911 and dominating the city skyline, just one of several magniﬁcent examples of Raj architecture in that bifurcated city (“City of Palaces” and Jain temples cheek by jowl with some of the world’s most densely populated slums which Vivien was never allowed near). The city – and Ernest – prospered further\n\n8\n\nDark Star\n\n(Ernest was now a full partner in his ﬁrm) in the postwar years but with Vivien now six her parents had to settle her education. Gertrude – who would have brooked no opposition even had Ernest offered it – insisted that Vivien must have a Catholic education and although there seemed no suitable Calcutta establishment there were some perfectly good boarding-schools for European children in India, notably the Catholic Convent in the Himalayan foothills at Murree. But it was a long-established custom for sons and daughters of the wealthier Raj to be sent to “the homeland” to be educated; Ernest’s money and Gertrude’s ambitions for Vivien allowed them to choose from the best possible schools. It possibly seemed an alluring prospect to Vivien at six to be promised a sea voyage to England; whether she was told beforehand that she would then be separated from her parents for the best part of ten years is not known. In early January 1920 the Hartleys sailed on the City of Baroda, travelling in considerable style. Vivien did not see India again until nearly half a century later – there was one, ill-fated intervening visit to Sri Lanka – when she travelled with friends to Nepal and India. Back in 1920 she was about to become, in effect, a displaced person.\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nHours Nearer Death\n\nI\n\nndia had been vibrant, hot, its skies mostly unclouded; all that Vivien would have seen as their ship moved up a muddy Thames to Tilbury in February was austere, grey and chilly. She was still surrounded by the warmth of family when her parents took her to Bridlington to meet her paternal grandparents and two unmarried aunts, Lilian who energetically pedalled everywhere on an ancient bicycle and the deaf but kindly Hilda. In 1920 Bridlington was quiet in winter but crowded in summer when both beaches ringing the town were packed with holidaymakers. Vivien enjoyed her Bridlington summer, often paddling in the sea – she developed into a surprisingly strong swimmer – going on donkey rides and walking in the early evening along the esplanade, although the Bridlington candyﬂoss was blander than the delicious Darjeeling burrakee-ball. Towards the end of that ﬁrst English summer the Hartleys returned south, to London’s deluxe Carlton Hotel where they had stayed on arrival. Also staying there was their Calcutta chum Tommy (John Thompson), who often travelled with the Hartleys until his death shortly before World War II. It has been hinted that Gertrude and he were lovers and indeed Tommy’s niece Elizabeth Thompson was told by Gertrude that Tommy was “the love of her life” but – as she stressed to Elizabeth – this was barely voiced at the time and nothing was done, or could be done about it, given Gertrude’s profound religious orthodoxy. Tommy and Ernest had Scotland in common; Ernest was born on Islay while Tommy’s family was centred round the lochside Campbeltown. They often went golﬁng together in Scotland or to Ireland to ﬁsh, usually at Waterville in County Kerry. Tommy’s nephew Ian Thompson remembered his attachment to the Hartleys (“conﬁrmed bachelor” then had none of its modern connotations):\n\n10\n\nDark Star He was a wonderful fellow, in the eyes of a teenage boy. He had enough money, being a bachelor, to do all the things I thought were wonderful like big game ﬁshing . . . shooting, sailing etc. he was a charming chap with a ‘way’ with women. He also had hollow legs.\n\nElizabeth failed to comprehend why Gertrude could really prefer her steadfast uncle Tommy to the ebullient, spirited Ernest, who entranced adults and children with his zest for life and entertaining stories. There seems no evidence to support the suggestion of any ongoing Tommy/Gertrude affair; the triangular relationship suited all three and certainly Vivien always seemed to regard Tommy as a benevolent uncle with no Maisie-like perceptions out of Henry James. Her life changed dramatically in September. Vivien had shown a precocious love of the theatre; she was taken by her parents to a West End show as a treat (or sweetener) on 20 September and the next morning was taken with her luggage to the Convent of the Sacred Heart at Roehampton. She was then left in the care of the nuns. Gertrude’s diary records a visit to Vivien on 26 September. (“very sad indeed”) and on two further occasions, once for a trip to London Zoo, before she and Ernest sailed for India on 10 October. It would be nearly two years before she saw her daughter again. It seems harsh today but such arrangements were far from unusual then (although Vivien was slightly younger than the normal entry-age – in fact, she was the youngest pupil there). A high, thick-walled building dating from 1850 in Roehampton Lane, the Convent was part of the global network of the Sacred Heart organisation, founded in post-revolutionary France by Saint Madeleine Sophie Barat to re-establish the power of Christian life through the education of girls. Its motto was “Cor unum et anima in corde Jesu” (“One Heart and One Mind in the Heart of Jesus”). The Roehampton Convent achieved ﬁctional fame as the Convent of the Five Wounds in the novel Frost in May by Antonia White, a pupil there shortly before Vivien with a lifelong love – hate relationship with Catholicism. Her story of a new girl, Nanda, and her experiences became a bestseller in 1933 (Vivien’s diary records that she bought it then); it spares few punches in its portrayal of the pervasive austerity of convent life. Stories of English school life tend to be better when set in boys’ schools than those for girls (which mostly are populated by what another novelist, Elizabeth Bowen, called “the curl-tossing tomboys of St Dithering’s”) but White recalls the Colette of the Claudine stories with a similar unblinking clarity.\n\nHours Nearer Death\n\n11\n\nShe captures the institutional life immediately – the smells of soap, beeswax and incense, the regularity of bells (the Angelus bell for 6.30 rising at Roehampton, bells for early Mass, mealtimes, classes, bells major and minor dividing sacred duties from secular). Beds were in 20-strong unheated dormitories, curtained into cubicles at night behind which girls dressed and undressed, allowing no glimpse of nudity. Soiled undergarments had to be neatly arranged on a stool, covered by specially made silk squares, which became Vivien’s lifelong custom. The Convent relentlessly underscored the tenets of Catholic orthodoxy – the constant reminders that life is the path to death – with the regular quotation from St Teresa at the striking of the hours by the bell: “An hour nearer to death. An hour nearer to heaven or hell.” Sin – “wasting time in idle dreaming” was a special anathema as was personal vanity – would be owned at Confession and self-abnegation was not discouraged (salt instead of sugar on rhubarb to mortify the sense of taste). Over the omnipresent sense of sin hovered the spectre of the Fires of Hell. Certainly some aspects of Vivien’s school life were grimly forbidding and also, like most “closed-order” establishments, often peculiarly snobbish. At Roehampton many girls were from “landed” old Catholic families with some foreign minor royalty also attending; there was a suggestion about Vivien that she came from a background of ‘trade’ which could make for some spiteful barbs. However, she had the compensatory hint of glamour from India which stamped her as different and, trained by Gertrude to be always well-mannered to everyone, she was fairly rapidly after her initial sense of loss – even abandonment – popular with fellow pupils and nuns alike. In Frost in May, Nanda develops “a hard little protective shell” as a carapace for survival. Vivien had no need to cloak her feelings quite to that extent. Her sheer charm was an advantage, too; there was a strict “No Pets” rule but, partly because she was so young, Reverend Mother allowed her special exemption to keep a stray kitten, the animal which probably sparked her lifelong love of cats. Roehampton life was not all discipline and mortiﬁcation. Compared to other such institutions, it was relatively liberal. A small lake at the bottom of the large gardens would often see Vivien alone, simply gazing at the movement of the water – her favourite element – far enough away to avoid charges of “wasting time in idle dreaming”. The girls could play tennis in doubles and there were occasional plays – Vivien played Mustardseed in A Midsummer Night’s Dream and Miranda in The Tempest, the latter directed by future playwright Bridget Boland, large and bossy even as a child, who chastised Vivien for tripping over some of her lines with a well-aimed offstage thump\n\n12\n\nDark Star\n\nwith a candlestick. Music was encouraged and she learnt to play the piano, also playing the cello in the school orchestra. She shared early dreams with one of her best friends, a vivacious Irish girl, Maureen O’Sullivan, who had acting ambitions even then too and who recalled Vivien as one of the most popular pupils, decisively announcing to Maureen: “When I leave school, I’m going to be a great actress.” Another Irish-born friend, Patsy Quinn, also remembered her vividly as: obviously delicate. Her chest was already weak . . . A “special child” you’d say. Even her presents from home were special. Vivien was so tiny and delicately made . . . with the only complexion I have seen that really was like a peach.\n\nPatsy stressed that, while a sincere Catholic, Vivien was not exactly pious (“she never struck me as a ‘believer’ in the deeper sense”). There was for her, along with others at the Convent, a sense of identiﬁcation in 1925 with the romantic story of The´re`se Martin, canonised for her devotional writing as St The´re`se of Lisieux; the identiﬁcation may have evaporated but the Notebooks of St The´re`se would always be on her bookshelves. The ‘special’ presents mentioned by Patsy Quinn consisted mostly of bracelets and colourful silks from India but for her ﬁrst birthday at the Convent, not long after her arrival, a huge wooden box was delivered for Vivien. She and some of the girls including Patsy joined in the excitement as the suspense built during the unwrapping of the many layers of packaging, ﬁnally revealing a large, expensively costumed china doll. But in transit the head had been cracked right across – later a television documentary saw this as a fateful metaphor of Vivien’s life – which caused tears all around. Her few surviving letters from Roehampton – always read by the nuns before posting – have no real complaints about the regime, to which she adapted once she realised her circumstances would be unlikely to change. And convent life had its compensations; she was never especially studious, apart from enthusiasms for Egyptian history, her music and dancing classes: I can scarcely remember when I ﬁrst thought of going on the stage, because it was such an accepted fact of my childhood . . . I was fortunate to have understanding parents and all my education and early life were shaped to that end . . . I was allowed to specialise in history, literature and music.\n\nWriting home, she peppered her letters with phrases out of Angela Brazil’s books of girls’ school life with some wild stabs at spelling. Caught talking in class, she was punished by missing part of her half-term holiday. Don’t you call it beastly? I do think it’s simply the BUN! Mother Bruce-Hall said she hoped I had tribulation – she said it would do me a lot of good.\n\nHours Nearer Death\n\n13\n\nShe enthused about Egyptian history: I wish we could dig all the sand away and that all those marvellous spinxes [sic] and tempels [sic] could be seen again.\n\nEven more enjoyable were the occasional outings to plays (“ripping fun”) and revues. A school trip to a Christmas perennial of the time, Where the Rainbow Ends, had triggered her request to have dancing lessons; Maureen O’Sullivan admired her for taking the classes alone, mainly in basic ballet steps for which Patsy Quinn thought she had “extraordinary poise – she was always a very mature person for her age”, sensing also a quality instilled by Gertrude: One was always gay and laughing with Vivien . . . She was generous to a fault. I think what people noticed most was her perfect manners and I think this was really more her tremendous consideration of other people.\n\nShe was fervent about all the rituals involved in the preparation for her ﬁrst Communion in 1921, enclosing in her letter home a photograph of herself in her pure white dress, and even more thrilled when Gertrude replied with news that she would be sailing to visit her the following spring. That made for a happy time, with Gertrude satisfying Vivien’s theatre mania with a visit to catch a favourite performer, the bowler-hatted, bug-eyed star George Robey (later memorably glimpsed as Falstaff in Olivier’s Henry V ﬁlm). She was even more thrilled in the summer when her parents – Ernest joined them – took a Lake District holiday and found Robey resident in the same hotel, ever ready to chat to his stagestruck fan and give her treasured signed photographs. Until the end of Vivien’s time at Roehampton, Gertrude now visited every year – Ernest every second – broadening her daughter’s horizons with more “improving” plays including a Stratford Hamlet throughout which Vivien, at 11, sat spellbound. Other holidays were spent with family at Bridlington, less frequently now both grandparents were in failing health, or with the daughter of Ernest’s Calcutta friend Geoffrey Martin – Vivien was friends with Frances (“Mills”) Martin – who had a home in the West Country. On a few occasions when there was nowhere for her to spend a holiday period she would remain at the Convent where the lay nuns could accompany her to art galleries or to suitable serious plays. Just sometimes the seemingly model pupil revealed another aspect of a more complex personality. Patsy Quinn was one who noticed Vivien’s occasional retreats behind a remoteness, a kind of self-communion when she would be found alone by the lake, intently focusing on the movement of the\n\n14\n\nDark Star\n\nwater or the reﬂection of the trees’ movement. Another friend conﬁded in an Olivier biographer, noting that for weeks Vivien would seem untroubled, but: Then, suddenly, a complete turnaround. Sometimes it would last only a few hours, other times a day or more. But when it happened we’d see a completely different girl – moody, silent, petulant, rude, often hysterical, disturbed in some way that she had no control over . . . It was frightening when it happened, almost on the order of a dual personality.\n\nThe screenwriter Gavin Lambert later observed that the outward control of Vivien’s life – her immaculate grooming, the impeccably arranged houses and gardens – cloaked possibly an amount of inner chaos. These convent ‘episodes’ preﬁgure the descriptions of her later mood-swings and perhaps those schoolgirl phases were eruptions out of a desolating loneliness of which both her upbringing and convent discipline forbade expression. Certainly when away from Roehampton there seemed no such eruptions; Mills Martin, who saw her often on shared Devon holidays, always stressed her gaiety then (“she had this extraordinary star quality and emanated something that other people didn’t”). Under normal circumstances Vivien would have remained at the Sacred Heart until she was 16. But – once again abruptly – those circumstances changed. Ernest’s ﬁnancial position was now seemingly so secure that he decided to retire early and enjoy travelling through Europe for a time with Gertrude (Tommy occasionally joined them) and Vivien. The marriage had settled into a mutually comfortable groove; Gertrude, who would seem to have had no great sexual drive, or to repress it, would be happy to enjoy a kind of 1920s Grand Tour while turning a blind eye to Ernest’s casual ﬂings. She stipulated that Vivien’s education must continue; she wanted her to have as many accomplishments as possible, ideally eventually to make “a good marriage”. A period in Europe would give her polish plus the advantage of learning other languages, providing in effect an ideal ﬁnishing school. Vivien, sharply perceptive even then, may well have sensed undercurrents in her parents’ relationship but she was perfectly happy to embark on what sounded like a glamorous change of lifestyle. In fact, most of the next two years were spent back behind convent walls. First she was placed in another Sacred Heart institution at Dinard in Brittany. ˆ te d’Emerande, washed by the Gulf Stream which helped its mild On the Co climate, Dinard had since the previous century been popular with the wealthy British who rented its Belle Epoque villas or stayed in its luxury hotels, appreciating its air of quiet respectability and walks along the beautiful\n\nHours Nearer Death\n\n15\n\nPromenade du Clair de Lune, fringed by tropical plants. Once Vivien was settled in the Dinard Sacre´ Coeur Convent, Ernest and Gertrude travelled extensively, occasionally returning to Dinard, which Gertrude adored. An old friend of the Hartleys, Henry Musgrave, was now in Europe from India and also joining them at times was a wealthy Liverpool cotton-broker, Maurice Stern (nicknamed by Vivien “Mama’s cotton beau”); there was no question of any dalliance but while Ernest was otherwise engaged and if Tommy was not around then both Musgrave and Stern would compete to squire Gertrude to the casino or to a dance. Vivien liked the town of Dinard whenever allowed outside convent walls, inside which life was less than idyllic. Puberty saw Vivien mature more quickly than was usual then and she was undoubtedly conscious of interest from Dinard’s youths. Her French improved so much that she was soon ﬂuent but the nuns were joyless compared with those at Roehampton. Patsy Quinn noticed her altered mood (“I remember unhappy letters from her ﬁrst very strict convent in France”). There was a welcome break at the end of her ﬁrst Dinard year when she spent most of the summer of 1928 with Ernest in Biarritz, months of hedonistic fun at the racecourse or swimming in the bay in a daringly low-cut swimsuit, a present from Ernest of which Gertrude, returning from a trip to Paris, deeply disapproved. Seemingly working her way round the Mediterranean coast, Vivien was next installed at another Sacre´ Coeur convent, much more to her taste, in San Remo on the Italian Riviera, another ritzy 1920s paradise of elaborate villas, streamlined yachts in the harbour and a white wedding cake of a casino. Vivien now was beginning to champ at the bit, bound by the routine of institutional life; she still faithfully attended Mass but the chains were often irksome. She deeply disliked the unsmiling San Remo Reverend Mother; letters were censored there too but she managed to send one to her parents which ended saying “The Reverend Mother is a – – -” followed by a penpicture of a lavishly be-whiskered cat. What she did respond to was San Remo itself, especially its ﬂora, the exuberant mimosa and roses, above all the peonies, huge and blowsy, growing in abundance in the ﬁelds above the town, the petals of which the girls were allowed to scatter before the processions on the Feast of Corpus Christi. Now 15, and shedding the last of any puppy-fat and growing into a willowy adolescent beauty, Vivien had a contrasting damp and misty Irish summer, ﬁshing in the River Erriff at Ardsleagh. Often pictured as a quintessentially metropolitan sophisticate, she was in fact usually happy in the countryside and\n\n16\n\nDark Star\n\nwith country pursuits. Before returning to France the Hartleys visited Ernest’s mother – grandfather Hartley had died the year before – and then Vivien began one of the happiest times of her younger years. In the autumn of 1929 she went to Paris, enrolled for a term in a highly regarded establishment, the Villa Sainte-Monique in the respectable suburban Auteuil district. Not precisely a ﬁnishing school, with academic discipline of no great stringency, there was strong emphasis on French language and literature (Vivien’s appreciation of Montaigne began there) which she found no great hardship. Even more to her liking was the coaching from Mlle Antoine, reputedly an Artiste of the Come´die Francaise: She was a most inspiring teacher and I owe a great deal to her care in correcting my diction and to her encouragement. “I believe you have a future in the theatre, mon enfant” she told me, “but you must go back to England and work, work, work.”\n\nVivien during this period in Paris was emerging into full beauty. She was popular with the other girls, a polyglot mixture including some from Roehampton. A fellow pupil, Betty Harbord, recalled Vivien at nearly 16 as the youngest in the school and especially vivid in her memory was one of the Saturday evenings to which friends of the school’s proprietrix were invited for bridge while their sons, mostly from St Cyr University, joined to dance with the girls, all assembled waiting nervously to be joined by the teenage boys. Vivien clearly had already mastered the art of a good entrance: Suddenly they all turned round. Vivien had come into the room, in a short simple little dress when all the rest of us had long ones, and no make-up. The rest of us were deserted and all the boys excused themselves to go and ask Vivien to dance. She hadn’t said anything . . . she had that charisma.\n\nVivien would happily have stayed on in Paris but Gertrude, who had heard disquieting whispers of trips into Paris for ﬁlms, not to mention experiments with lipstick, had different ideas. To ﬂuency in French and Italian now German would be added to Vivien’s accomplishments, completing the blueprint for turning out a polished young woman. Inwardly Vivien may have groaned contemplating, at nearly 17, yet more education; she may also after years of literally having no ﬁxed abode, have sighed after a less peripatetic life, with a room of her own. However, her time at her German school near Salzburg in Bavaria at Bad Reichenhall, turned out to be exhilarating. 1930 is the ﬁrst year for which any diary of Vivien’s survives; for most of the next 37 years she used an annual chic pocket diary, slim and leather-bound, usually with her initials embossed on the cover and generally ordered through Smythson’s of Bond Street or from Fortnum and Mason. Gradually the entries tapered off, replaced\n\nHours Nearer Death\n\n17\n\nby notes of the appointments in a hectic life but for the early 1930s she squeezed in, her writing already rather loopy, as much as she could into each day’s small space. Hopefully Gertrude did not sneak a glance at these teenage diaries. Vivien was, in Oscar Hammerstein’s words, “Sixteen going on seventeen/Waiting for life to start” and all the longing and frustrations of adolescence were poured into her diary. Initially the entries were innocuous enough – in the spring of 1930 she and usually both parents (Ernest sometimes made brief visits to England) drove through France to the Spanish frontier then through Aix to San Remo (“Oh, what memories!”), stopping for rounds of golf en route. Then (“beastly leaving Mum”) she began her ﬁnal “ﬁnishing” at the upmarket Bavarian establishment run by the Baron and Baroness von Roeder at Bad Reichenhall where apart from the early starts (“Getting up at 6.30 is perfectly poisonous!”) life was decidedly relaxed with German lessons conﬁned to mornings, afternoons spent in the town at the cinema (“Emil Jannings in His Last Command – marvellous!”) with informal dances in the evenings or even trips to Salzburg for the opera which became Vivien’s latest enduring passion, bowled over ﬁrst by “a wonderful Fledermaus”. Soon, alongside noting dancing at the local Park Cafe´, increasingly there are references galore to letters from and to quite a number of boys – Arthur and Louis (clearly rivals) most frequently. She was also indulging in forbidden fruit (“Lay on the balcony and smoked”), even reading the scandalous novel of a young man’s initiation by an older vamp, Three Weeks by Elinor Glyn (“Would you like to sin/With Elinor Glyn/On a tiger skin?/Or would you prefer/To err/ With her/On some other fur?”). By contrast the summer holiday that year was another damply tranquil time in Ireland (“Topping being back”) when she had a happy reunion with Patsy Quinn, learnt to drive, blackberried, ﬁshed and collected from the sleepy local post ofﬁce treasured letters from Arthur (none, seemingly, from Louis). Joe is the next young man on the scene, back in Bavaria; after agonising waits (“Again, no letter”) ﬁnally “A letter – unexpected of course – so happy! Four more days.” And four days later she travelled to Leipzig with her friend Ebette from school and spent Christmas and New Year there, seeing Joe regularly; all three went to Die Meistersingers (“very well done”) and climbed the Hasenbourg and then just before returning to school she recorded what would have been a surprise for Gertrude (“Joe decided to tell his family about our engagement. Vicemutter was adorable . . . she’s happy about it”). Vicemutter was clearly a wise woman to leave things to take their course. For the next two\n\n18\n\nDark Star\n\nmonths many letters from Joe arrived for her (in late January – “Wild letter from Joe. I wrote a poem in the evening”) but in March she had a “dear Vivien” letter (“had the letter from Joe. Maybe it’s better as it is”). She may have sobbed in identifying with tragic young love in Salzburg the following evening as she watched La Bohe`me but seems quite equable next day (“All over with Joe – he’s a silly ass anyway”). A few days later a new love appears, referred to only as Ruppa or ‘R’, who turned up at Bad Reichenhall in the spring, taught her gypsy dancing (“a ripping day”), took her for long country walks and then, after leaving, wrote “such dear letters – . . . made me fall over with joy”. Luckily he had left before Joe was back in the frame just before Vivien left Bavaria for the last time, leaving poor Joe disconsolate but joining her school friends seeing her off from Leipzig “almost buried in ﬂowers, ﬂowers and more ﬂowers”. Ernest met his now “ﬁnished” daughter at the Hook and they travelled together to Ireland, back to Aasleagh. On the journey she began to comprehend a change in her father’s fortunes. Although far from on his uppers, his ﬁnances had been damaged by investments which had suffered during the volatile late 1920s ﬁnancial climate and before much longer, having thought himself retired for life, he would have to ﬁnd employment. Gertrude, always more resourceful, would turn her interest in beauty treatment and diet into a solid London business concern with her Academy of Beauty. In the meantime life continued much as before. There was still money available to pay for Vivien’s stage training once she had been accepted for London’s recently opened RADA (The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art); her decision deﬁnitely to pursue an acting career might well have been prompted by the ﬁrst ﬁlm she saw after her return, A Connecticut Yankee, in which her schoolfriend Maureen O’Sullivan – whisked off to Hollywood after being “talent-spotted” – had starred. In Ireland, letters from Ruppa arrived with Teutonic regularity while Vivien spent most of her time with the recently reappeared Arthur, driving, riding, playing poker, swimming and ﬁshing with him (“all marvellous fun – we’re on the best of terms again”). Later – “After dinner we talked out of our rooms late – a marvellous moonlight night.” Further development of any romance was guillotined by yet another rapid change in the Hartleys’ circumstances; altering plans to take a London house, Ernest rented a house in Teignmouth – the West Country was familiar from holidays with the Martin family. Vivien saw a good deal of the Martin girls and one morning Mills and Vivien joined the crowd at the gathering of a meet of the Dartmoor Draghounds, one of whom, a fair\n\nHours Nearer Death\n\n19\n\nyoung man on a chestnut horse, greeted Mills Martin. According to Mills’s recollection, when she asked Vivien if she thought the man, Leigh Holman, was handsome, Vivien replied: “I think he looks the perfect Englishman. I’m going to marry him” and when Mills told her that he was practically engaged to her sister Dulcie, Vivien was unfazed: “That doesn’t matter. He hasn’t seen me yet.” Leigh Holman saw more of her two weeks later when the girls attended the South Devon Hunt Ball held in the hall on Torquay Pier. He was from what would have been considered an “old Devon” landed family, established for generations in the area. After Harrrow and reading Law at Cambridge he was now a leading member of a thriving London legal ﬁrm in the Middle Temple. With his lean face, wavy blond hair and shy smile he somewhat resembled a favourite actor of Vivien’s, Leslie Howard; he had perfect manners and, although far from a Fred Astaire, clearly enjoyed dancing with Vivien, who had chosen a ﬂoaty turquoise dress for the occasion and was at her most captivating. They talked of many things but at that time Vivien made no mention of any acting ambitions; subsequently Holman said she did not seem to have that aspiration “or the qualities that brought her fame”. Arthur followed Joe, Louis and Ruppa into oblivion and Vivien’s diary for the next few months repeatedly records Leigh Holman’s name. He is ﬁrst mentioned on 29 December 1931 (“Marvellous Hunt Ball – met Leigh – adored it”); the following day she accompanied him to Exeter to the cinema (Marlene Dietrich and Gary Cooper in Morocco – “wonderful ﬁlm”) and soon “drove round and saw Holman Estate. Met Leigh.” How genuinely, deeply attracted Vivien was to Leigh Holman and how much of the appeal was a “crush” underpinned by a latent desire to free herself from dependence on her parents is debatable. She certainly thought she was falling in love with him but for all her surface sophistication she had been very little in the world, mostly cocooned in convents or schools or in her parents’ lifestyle, although what she felt for Leigh was very different from ephemeral teenage fancies. There was something steadfast beneath his seemingly difﬁdent, courteous exterior and indeed he would remain, most remarkably, utterly devoted to and in every way possible supportive of her through separation, divorce and her worst emotional crises until her death (he never remarried). This quality in him – he was 11 years older – Vivien may have felt she needed after years of never quite settling anywhere and unpredictable parental circumstances. There was also at least a grain of truth in Patsy Quinn’s observation:\n\n20\n\nDark Star Vivien was so young and wanted anything she couldn’t get. And she was going to be so lovely. No wonder Leigh wondered about marrying her.\n\nBack in London, where the Hartleys took a ﬂat in Cornwall Gardens, Vivien and Leigh met up again soon (“Dinner and show with Leigh. The most marvellous evening”). Things moved fast – several lunches, a tea at Leigh’s apartment, then “Dinner with Dad and Leigh at Quaglino’s.” She tore herself away to visit Bridlington (now “this dreary hole”) as promised – a six-week stay during which she received many letters (sometimes two in one day) from Leigh, but much as she loved her aunts it was a dull time alone, too cold to swim, often with only reading and knitting to console her. With an enormous “HURRAY!” she recorded her return to London and at once was in a whirl of lunches, dinners, plays, the Boat Race (cheering for Cambridge, of course) and Henley Regatta with Leigh. He now knew of her RADA plans – he seemed to regard it as another ﬁnishing school of sorts (Vivien recorded in May: “RADA ﬁrst day – love it”). Her courting continued during RADA; Leigh would wait for her in Gower Street at the end of each Academy day and they would go on to dinner, a play or splashy social events such as the Caledonian Ball. Vivien was introduced to Leigh’s legal friends and two especially close to him, both of whom introduced her – no snob in the usual sense but drawn to challenging minds – to new worlds. Hamish Hamilton (always known as Jamie) was of Scottish background although American-born and met Leigh at Cambridge where he was a star on the river (he won silver in rowing at the 1928 Olympics). Tall, with a dry wit and attractive to women, he had recently formed his eponymous publishing house. The theatre was a major interest; he had married the striking but troubled actress Jean Forbes-Robertson but by the time he met Vivien the marriage was fraying (they divorced in 1934). Jamie was dazzled by his ﬁrst meeting with Vivien (“a vision of beauty far lovelier with her eyebrows unplucked before the theatre people got hold of her”). Even stronger a friendship for Leigh was that with Oswald Frewen, also with a legal background. Frewen had previously been a Commander in the Royal Navy; quiet, balding and slim, he was the son of Clara, sister of Jennie Jerome, who married Randolph Churchill (Oswald was close to his cousin Winston), and Morton Frewen (nicknamed Mortal Ruin), the popular but prodigal MP. Leigh had helped Oswald create The Sheephouse at Brede in East Sussex, a house in the grounds of Brede Place which had belonged to the Churchill family; it was converted from an ancient sheepbarn into a delightful home with superb views over the extensive gardens (laid out with Leigh’s help) to the Brede Valley.\n\nHours Nearer Death\n\n21\n\nVivien came to know and love Brede even after her separation from Leigh. She also took greatly to Clare Sheridan, Oswald’s sister, an intrepid, pioneering and multitalented woman; she and Oswald had travelled extensively to Russia and Spain and she had rejected marriage proposals from the wealthy Earl of Wilton to pursue careers as a sculptor and writer, along the way ﬁtting in love affairs, with Trotsky and Lenin (she made busts of both) in Russia and Charlie Chaplin in Hollywood among her conquests. She and Vivien formed an instant bond. Although Leigh’s formidable mother was unsure about their suitability together, Leigh had fallen deeply in love with Vivien; she had beguiled him utterly and he was taken aback by the force of his feelings for her. Vivien’s 1932 diary alternates between busy RADA times – she acted in As You Like It and Somerset Maugham’s drama Caesar’s Wife – and an ever-busier social life with Leigh at cocktail parties, dinners at the Bath Club or the Berkeley where Jamie Hamilton often joined them; he loved dancing so would often take the ﬂoor with Vivien while Leigh looked on benevolently. She wanted Leigh to experience Ireland and they went with “The Victorians” as she referred to her parents and Tommy, who joined the party. Staying in Bridlington – braving the ﬁerce currents to swim in the bay – brieﬂy beforehand, she wrote to Leigh: What a heavenly sight that light morning will be in Ireland. Enhanced by the knowledge that the day will be a beautiful one and that one will drive out to the ‘silversands’ where there’s never a soul, a surf ride at a tremendous rate up Killarney Bay to a little scooped-out beach . . . I know you’ll love it there.\n\nThe Irish trip was a signal success; “The Victorians” stayed on for more ﬁshing while the now ofﬁcially engaged couple (“Great thrilldom” Vivien wrote of this to her friend Jane Glancy) returned to London to prepare for the wedding. It had been agreed with Leigh that Vivien would leave RADA, about which she seemed to have made no objection, although her departure disappointed the Academy’s founder Sir Kenneth Barnes, who told her that he had noticed her hard work and that he felt she would have succeeded on the stage, to which she allegedly replied: “Wait and see – I’ll be back.” The trio of the Hartleys and Tommy were back in London in December, ready for the marriage; Gertrude greatly enjoyed shopping with Vivien for ﬁnal items of her trousseau. On 20 December 1932 Vivien made a brief diary entry: “Too tired to write, but I got married. Wonderful day.”\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nYoung Wife and Mother\n\nT\n\nhe wedding of Leigh Holman to Vivien Hartley was a fashionable affair – Gertrude was gratiﬁed that a photograph of the couple in The Daily Sketch appeared alongside one of King George V and Queen Mary – held at the Catholic church of St James’s in Spanish Place. Patsy Quinn was a bridesmaid and remembered Vivien in a simple white satin dress and a Juliet cap of pearls holding a more elaborate veil: So young – so slim and a little frail, her heart as a child at school was never robust and I remember her chest was always weak.\n\nEverything was along conventional lines for a comfortably-off couple of the period. The “Holmen”, as Oswald Frewen dubbed them, honeymooned (“blest hours”) in Paris and then Vivien was able to show her husband some of her favourite places – Salzburg (“very glad to be there again – showed Leigh everything”) and Leipzig (“everything the same but different with Leigh”). They began London life together at Eyre Court, Leigh’s Finchley Road modernblock apartment. Gertrude was in Biarritz for a course in facial massage, planning the consolidation of her business, initially based in Dover Street, while Ernest was adapting to a new job in the City as a bill-broker and so Vivien alone adapted Leigh’s bachelor ﬂat with new soft furnishings more to her taste. That accomplished, there was little for her to do; Leigh already had a maid who cleaned the compact ﬂat and was used to preparing weekday meals. Long hours on the telephone to friends from Roehampton or RADA only increased her sense of isolation. In marrying so young and determinedly Vivien had imagined she was taking the reins of her life; in fact, she had, not untypically, rather impulsively thrown herself at it. Her diary by contrast with the previous year is often blank,\n\nYoung Wife and Mother\n\n23\n\nsimply noting a few lunches with friends, including Jamie Hamilton’s lively new girlfriend and later wife, Yvonne Pallavicino, weekends at Brede, sometimes with Clare Sheridan (“divine person”) present who made Vivien’s life seem humdrum, and Devon visits usually coinciding with local hunts or point-to-points. Much as she liked the country, this was not her ideal scenario, and it soon changed. First she persuaded Leigh to allow her to re-enrol at RADA, slightly bending truth to convince him that mainly this would maintain her French (RADA did have a French course then), and sometimes he could be coaxed into seeing a play (she adored Richard of Bordeaux which catapulted John Gielgud to stardom) or to supper at the Embassy, sometimes with Jamie Hamilton, who recalled that period of his life before his second marriage: Kaleidoscopic memories of your ﬁrst coming to my ﬂat at Knightsbridge Court with Leigh, a silk scarf round your neck, of motoring to RADA, of dancing at the Embassy . . . of your wedding and that weekend in Devon when you knew you were pregnant.\n\nHer pregnancy, most likely dating from a visit to Devon in February for the funeral of Leigh’s mother, was unlikely to have been planned; there would have been little point in arranging to return to RADA in preparation for an acting career. She loved the atmosphere in Gower Street – the classes, the rehearsals, the “shop” gossip – and again she would have to leave. At least she had something to occupy her; Leigh’s apartment was too small for a baby (and the obligatory nanny) and it was Vivien who did most of the house-hunting, ﬁnally ﬁnding a stylish small Queen Anne house in Little Stanhope Street in that village-like Mayfair enclave of Shepherd Market. Even today it still has some mews houses, narrow side streets, pubs and independent shops with the afﬂuent jostling the rafﬁsh. A bonus – or omen – for Vivien was that the London-born Broadway star Lynn Fontanne had lodged in the house early in her career, but Leigh liked its quirky charm too. The rooms were small but they both had good eyes for furniture (later Vivien said Leigh taught her most of what she knew of antiques) and together they furnished Little Stanhope Street, top-ﬂoor nursery included, with ﬁnds from weekend drives to small Cotswold towns where the antique shops often had bargains. Her ﬂair for home-making was helped by a good colour sense and a knack of cleverly adding interest relatively inexpensively with lamps, cushions and objets d’art. She enhanced the room dimensions by adroitly placing mirrors or opening up cupboards beside ﬁreplaces to create open shelving, sometimes backed by mirrors and backlit to boost the illusion of space. They entertained regularly, with Leigh’s\n\n24\n\nDark Star\n\nlegal friends regular guests and sometimes Vivien’s RADA chums whose liveliness and gossip were less to Leigh’s taste. Social life diminished in late summer; although her pregnancy was troublefree her labour was long and the birth on 10 October (Gertrude was present) painful, as she told Patsy Quinn (“That was a very messy business. I don’t think I’ll do it again in a hurry”). Later she surprised Olivia de Havilland in Hollywood by describing childbirth as “humiliating”, a situation in which a woman has no real control. The event was recorded in her diary, somewhat laconically (“Had a baby – a girl”). She wrote describing her daughter – named Suzanne – to her friend Jane Pauling in similarly ironic vein: The spinster Holman is minute, and does not allow anyone to be very proud of her yet, as she only makes rude noises, and shows a tendency to greed and petulance . . . Radiant motherhood (if there really is such a thing) hasn’t hit me yet.\n\nVivien was ambivalent about motherhood, not entirely surprisingly for one barely out of her teens. She said later: I loved my baby as every mother does but with the clear-cut sincerity of youth I realised that I could not abandon all thought of a career on the stage. Some force within myself would not be denied.\n\nPartly because of events, not least her separation from Leigh and Suzanne after meeting Olivier and then the outbreak of war when she was in America, the maternal bond never had a proper chance to thrive initially. Brought up mostly by her father and grandmother, Suzanne loved her mother deeply and in later years they were strongly attached. Vivien later was also understanding and considerate with her stepson Tarquin, who had a similarly fractured early life, without ever usurping the role of his mother. But following the birth, the nanny controlled Stanhope Street’s nursery; a cook and a maid were also on the staff. Mills Martin called once on the nanny’s day off, to walk into a wall of wails from Suzanne with Vivien paying scant attention (Mills noted: “It is possible to give birth without the maternal glands working”). And actress Fabia Drake, who had met Vivien at a lunch party and often visited the Holmans, thought that while Vivien admired Leigh and appreciated his intelligence and kindness, “she was bored with her marriage to a barrister”. What Vivien really wanted was to work. Not for money primarily but because of what she had described as “some force within myself”. She still had a circle of RADA friends, one of whom, Hazel Terry, tipped her off about a ﬁlm to be made by Gainsborough Pictures starring the musical-comedy star Cicely Courtneidge with scenes set in a top-drawer girls’ school. That period, with\n\nYoung Wife and Mother\n\n25\n\nﬁlms still in the early days of sound, was hardly the British movie industry’s ﬁnest hour, although change was on the horizon. Most studios were mainly involved in turning out “Quota Quickies” to satisfy the percentage of domestic screen footage demanded by the Government in return for permitting the lion’s share to Hollywood product. It was then a much less unionised business; small parts and extras were often cast from recent drama school graduates or debutantes for a token daily pound or two as payment. Vivien left some photographs and her forwarding address with the production ofﬁce before leaving with Leigh for a sailing holiday in Scandinavian waters. Their ﬁrst stop was Copenhagen, where she found a telegram saying she might be required for ﬁlming which was enough (even without a ﬁrm offer) for Vivien to leave the sailing party and set out for home. This did not please her husband (he wrote back to her that if they were to be regularly separated in this way he might want her to stop “this ﬁlm business”). Inevitably the studio schedule changed and Vivien did not make her professional debut until a week after her return. Things Are Looking Up is no masterpiece (contrary to some reports it is not a “lost ﬁlm” and Vivien’s single line as one of a group of unusually glamorous sixth-formers – “If you are not made headmistress I shan’t come back next term” – was not cut) but for Vivien it was a thrilling experience. The director, Albert de Courville, had worked in the theatre and he created an easy on-set atmosphere, working speedily on the ﬁlm, the plot of which was loose, to say the least, with “Cis” Courtneidge in a double role as twins Bertha and Cicely Fyffe – one a jolly fairground artiste, her sister a stern schoolmistress. Complications arise when one stands in at the school for the other after a surprise elopement but knows little of geometry or tennis (the latter involves a surprise guest appearance from Wimbledon champion Suzanne Lenglen). De Courville licked the 80-minute ﬁlm along with some energy although the tight schedule allowed for little ﬁnesse and even the most brilliant talent-spotter would have been unlikely to predict a dazzling future from Vivien’s brief screen-time. Still it was a start, leaving her hungry for more. Even the waits between set-ups allowed her to take in at least some of the mechanics of ﬁlming and during her time on set she watched, absorbing everything she could, even in scenes which did not involve her. She made new friends among the other girls, including Anne Wilding, a fellow crossword-addict, who remembered them leaﬁng through a movie magazine (“We saw a picture of Laurence Olivier and I remarked I didn’t like his eyebrows. But Vivien thought he was the tops”).\n\n26\n\nDark Star\n\nAnother aspirant on set was Maud Miller, who wrote 20 years later of meeting Vivien on the Cobham location, noticing how she managed to catch the eye of the assistant director to snafﬂe her one line (“looks like she’ll get some place some day” Maud wrote in her own diary). Maud asked Vivien if she was doing the job just for fun, to be greeted by one haughtily raised eyebrow (“I happen to be an actress. I am not playing at the game”). Maud went on perceptively to write of Vivien then: a warm-hearted person when you get to know her . . . a curious mixture of child and sophisticate, actress and mother with a suspicion of the siren Cleopatra . . . there is one streak that only those who know her best are aware of. It’s her steely determination.\n\nThe one “snafﬂed” line raised Vivien to the status of a “special” artiste. She became friends with Dora Nirva, who worked in the production ofﬁce and eased her way into being driven home in a studio car with the “special girls”. The freemasonry of the unemployed among actors continued to help Vivien. Another RADA friend, Beryl Samson, told her of a new young London theatrical agent – few actors can negotiate a career without a good agent – called John Gliddon. Like many agents, Gliddon was an ex-actor, pragmatic enough to realise his limited talent, who had set up with a little money from his father in a tiny Regent Street ofﬁce (vital to have a good address in such a status-conscious business). He was determined to build up a client list from actors for whom he could help shape careers, somewhat along Hollywood lines. He always liked his independence and although he found some major talent – Deborah Kerr and Stewart Granger included – inevitably (it still happens) clients often moved on once established to larger, multi-agent organisations. Gliddon was discreetly gay, well-dressed and good company. He had stressed to Beryl Samson his intention to foster home-grown talent which he could help groom for the expansion of native cinema which he foresaw; she mentioned Vivien and Gliddon told her to bring her to meet him. Vivien took great care to present herself well – wearing one of her most ﬂattering dresses, a picture hat and generous sprays of scent – although Gliddon said it was her green-blue eyes which ﬁrst struck him. He spotted something in her at that ﬁrst meeting, something of that “force” she mentioned herself: For my part I had made up my mind that here was a very beautiful girl who possessed that rare gift – star quality. I wanted her to be quite certain that I meant business. Firstly I needed to get her to sign a contract with me so that I alone would be responsible for her progress to stardom.\n\nYoung Wife and Mother\n\n27\n\nGliddon was at least partly responsible for her stage name. After various suggestions – April Morn was, rightly, sharply vetoed – Vivian Hartley became Vivien Leigh by taking her husband’s ﬁrst name as her second (the Vivien came when her ﬁrst West End producer said Vivian could be a man’s name too).

The 1930s are sometimes portrayed as a Dark Age of British ﬁlm; certainly the industry was still Hollywood’s poor relation and not only in competitive terms. The cinema was phenomenally popular in an period of anxiety and depression; by the end of the decade it was by far the most important medium of British popular culture (18 million tickets sold each week) with an average of three new cinemas opening weekl"
