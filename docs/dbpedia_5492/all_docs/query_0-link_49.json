        "text": "Tag: Star of the Month\n\nDECEMBER ON TCM\n\nFirst off, a personal note. This will be the last “on TCM” I will be posting. I might do a highlighted version from now on but it will not be as long. These posts used to be fun but now feel like a chore. This has never been my intention. I’ll be trying out new things next year so stay tuned!\n\nSTAR OF THE MONTH: INGRID BERGMAN (WEDNESDAYS IN DECEMBER)\n\nIngrid Bergman is December’s Star of the Month for the third time. Here are some recommendations:\n\nA Woman’s Face (December 2 @ 2:30PM/1:30PM)-Bergman is a bitter, scarred (physically and emotionally) who gets a chance at a new life.\n\nDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (December 1 @ midnight/11PM)-Ingrid is the “bad girl” in this 1941 adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson’s classic.\n\nThe Bells of St. Mary’s (December 8 @ 8PM/7PM)-Ingrid is a plucky nun in this sequel to the 1944 Best Picture winner Going My Way.\n\nIndiscreet (December 15 @ 8PM/7PM)-Would you believe that this was Bergman’s first comedy?!\n\nTCM SPOTLIGHT: MET ON SET (THURSDAYS IN DECEMBER)\n\nSometimes performers and/or their directors really hit it off and start up a relationship. Some relationships manage to last for a lifetime while others do not end well. Most are in-between. TCM looks at some of cinema’s greatest off-screen couples.\n\nNight 1 looks at Classic Hollywood Sweethearts beginning with a couple whose only on-screen pairing came four years before they got together. I’m talking about Clark Gable and Carole Lombard in No Man of Her Own (8PM/7PM). Lombard was married to William Powell at the time of filming and Gable was also married but in name only. Next is Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy in Woman of the Year (9:30PM/8:30PM). The duo co-starred in another 8 films and spent the next 25 years together until Tracy’s death in 1967. Third is the film where Bogie met Bacall in To Have and Have Not (11:45PM/10:45PM). They made four more films together and were happily married until Bogart’s death in 1957. The subject of Season 3’s The Plot Thickens features the next couple Lucy and Desi in Too Many Girls (1:45AM/12:45AM). They were married for 20 years. Joel McCrea and Frances Dee met on the set of The Silver Cord (3:30AM/2:30AM); McCrea died on the couple’s 57th wedding anniversary. Robert Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck met on the set of His Brother’s Wife (5AM/4AM) and lasted for 15 years. Finally, Jane Wyman and Ronald Reagan met on the set of Brother Rat (6:45AM/5:45AM), married in 1940, and split in 1949.\n\nNight 2 features Short & Sweet Couplings. First up is the previously mentioned Carole Lombard and William Powell who co-starred in Man of the World (8PM/7PM); they lasted a little over two years but remained friends (yes, really). Next is Joan Crawford and Franchot Tone who co-starred in seven movies including Today We Live (9:30PM/8:30PM). They were married for four years. Wait a minute! Bette Davis and Gary Merrill who met on the All About Eve (11:30PM/10:30PM) set lasted for 10 years. That is not short and sweet! Now Eddie and Debbie who co-starred in Bundle of Joy (2AM/1AM) only were married for four years before he left her for Elizabeth Taylor. That’s better. John Gilbert and Virginia Bruce (Downstairs (3:45AM/2:45AM)) were married for less than two years. Lana Turner and Artie Shaw eloped during the making of Dancing Co-Ed (5:15AM/4:15AM) and were married for four months! Finally Ann Sheridan and George Brent fell for each other and made Honeymoon for Three (6:45AM/5:45AM). The marriage lasted nine months.\n\nNight 3 features Passionate Affairs starting with the “affair that nearly burned down Hollywood.” Clark Gable and Joan Crawford (both married) met on the set of Dance, Fools, Dance (8PM/7PM) and a years-long on-again, off-again affair quickly followed. The duo eventually settled into a friendship. SOTM Ingrid Bergman set off an international firestorm when she hooked up with her director Roberto Rossellini on the set of Stromboli (9:30PM/8:30PM). They lasted seven years. A decade later, another affair blew up in the media when Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton (both married) began a torrid affair on the set of Cleopatra (11:30PM/10:30PM). They left their spouses for each other and married twice!\n\nNight 4 is all about Modern Hollywood Couples. The oddest romance I read about was the relationship between Jane Fonda and Donald Sutherland on the set of Klute (4:15AM/3:15AM).

Since there has been a lot written about Day, I’m not going to give a biography this month. Instead, I’m recommending some of her lesser-known work.\n\nIt’s a Great Feeling (March 2 @ 5:15AM/4:15AM)-a meta comedy which mirrors Day’s attempts to be noticed by Hollywood producers. Actors Dennis Morgan and Jack Carson play “themselves” who vie for the lovely Doris and features multiple cameos who were currently working on the Warner Bros. lot in the late 1940s and poked fun at their images. Notable cameos include Gary Cooper, Joan Crawford and Edward G. Robinson.\n\nStorm Warning (March 2 @ 7AM/6AM)-Doris is the younger sister of model Ginger Rogers.

It’s so bad that the couple had to make the crib into a baby cage!\n\nEdited to add: The Flight Attendant’s and The Big Bang Theory’s Kaley Cuoco is going to be playing Day in a limited series. What do you think of her casting?\n\nTCM SPOTLIGHT: GROWING UP ON SCREEN (TUESDAYS IN MARCH)\n\nMany child stars fail to transition into adult stardom. This is not about them.

However, the majority of films made then couldn’t be made today. Times change and so do people’s attitudes. Many classics of yesteryear are seen as “problematic” today. The five hosts from TCM look at 20 films that are classic, but have a lot of problems. The discussion includes the first sound film where the main character wears blackface during his act, pleasant views of slavery, stereotypes of non-white characters including Blacks, Asians, Arabs, and Native Americans, the “shame” of being homosexual or transgender, and misogyny. The 20 films in this series are:\n\nGone With the Wind (March 4 @ 8PM/7PM)-Positive views of the Confederacy, happy slaves and marital rape\n\nSeven Brides for Seven Brothers (March 5@midnight/March 4@11PM)-Sexism, the kidnapping and forced marriage of six women as “meet-cute.”\n\nRope (March 5 @ 2AM/1AM)-Homosexual undertones between the killers and their victim\n\nThe Four Feathers (March 5 @3:30AM/2:30AM)-British colonialism in India and Arabs as “savages”\n\nWoman of the Year (March 11 @ 8PM/7PM)-the third act where apparently the main character had to be taken down a peg\n\nGuess Who’s Coming to Dinner? (March 11 @ 10:15PM/9:15PM)-Sidney Poitier is positioned as a perfect black man; daring in its time. Today people would be concerned about the couple’s age difference and life experience.\n\nGunga Din (March 12 @ 12:15AM/March 11 @ 11:15PM)-The title character is played by a white guy in brownface and British colonialism in India\n\nSinbad the Sailor (March 12 @ 2:30AM/1:30AM)-The title character is a white guy in brownface\n\nThe Jazz Singer (March 12@ 4:45AM/3:45AM)-The title character is in blackface\n\nThe Searchers (March 18 @ 8PM/7PM)-Cruelty towards Native Americans\n\nBreakfast at Tiffany’s (March 18 @ 10:15PM/9:15PM)- Mickey Rooney in yellowface\n\nSwing Time (March 19 @ 12:30AM/March 18 @ 11:30PM)-Fred Astaire in blackface\n\nStagecoach (March 19 @ 2:30AM/1:30AM)-Native Americans are treated as the bad guys\n\nTarzan. the Ape Man (March 19 @ 4:15AM/3:15AM)\n\nMy Fair Lady (March 25 @ 8PM/7PM)-Henry Higgins misogyny towards Eliza Doolittle\n\nThe Children’s Hour (March 25 @ 11PM/10PM)-portraying LGBT individuals in a bad light\n\nPsycho (March 26 @ 1AM/midnight)-LGBTQ issues\n\nDragon Seed (March 26 @ 3AM/2AM)-the entire cast including star Katharine Hepburn portray Chinese characters\n\nNOIR ALLEY\n\nNoiristas, here’s the March schedule for Noir Alley.

See you in May!\n\nKillers Kiss (March 6 & 7)-Stanley Kubrick’s second feature film about an aging boxer whose girlfriend is kidnapped by her violent boss. The boxer moves heaven and earth to find her.\n\nThe Night Holds Terror (March 13 & 14)-a film I’ve never heard of. Three hitchhikers take a family hostage.\n\nThe Third Man (March 20 & 21)-Joseph Cotten searches for an elusive “third man” after his childhood buddy Orson Welles has died. Shot on location in Vienna, Austria.\n\nPepe Le Moko (March 27 & 28)-French noir. Jean Gabin hides from the police in the Casbah. There was an American remake released one year later with Charles Boyer in the Gabin role.\n\nContinue reading “MARCH ON TCM” →\n\nFEBRUARY ON TCM\n\nLooking for 31 Days of Oscar? Well since the Oscars are postponed until April so is TCM’s annual festival.\n\nSTAR OF THE MONTH: JOHN GARFIELD (TUESDAYS)\n\nBefore there was Brando, there was John Garfield, the original Method actor. This is Garfield’s third time as TCM’s Star of the Month and the majority of Garfield’s films will air this month.\n\nJohn Garfield was born Jacob Julius Garfinkle on March 4, 1913 on the Lower East Side of Manhattan to Russian Jewish immigrants. Sometime during his childhood, Garfield contracted scarlet fever which weakened his heart forever (shades of Beth from Little Women). Nicknamed “Julie” Garfield was on his way to taking a wrong path when a teacher encouraged him to memorize speeches and deliver them in class which led to winning a statewide oratory contest. Julie became interested in acting and boxing and later won a scholarship to the Maria Ouspenskya Drama School.\n\nGarfield made his Broadway debut in 1932 and later met the playwright Clifford Odets who invited the actor to join the Group Theater. Odets wrote his play Golden Boy with the intention for Garfield to play the leading role but both were dismayed when Garfield was cast in a supporting role. John Garfield’s dream of starring in Golden Boy wouldn’t come to fruition until the early 1950s.\n\nJohn Garfield instead signed a contract with Warner Bros. making his film debut in Four Daughters (February 16 @ 12:15AM/11:15PM) as a cynical and depressed composer. Garfield was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. The film was such a success that Warner Bros. greenlit a sequel, Four Wives (February 17 @ 2AM/1AM) which included footage of Garfield from the previous film and reunited nearly the entire cast for the similar Daughters Courageous (February 17 @ 3:45AM/2:45AM). Garfield secured top billing for the first time with Blackwell’s Island (February 3 @ 6:15AM/5:15AM) then played an important supporting role in Juarez (February 10 @ 3:30AM/2:30AM). He got to co-star with such heavyweights as Edward G. Robinson in The Sea Wolf (February 9 @ 8PM/7PM), Spencer Tracy in Tortilla Flat (February 17 @ 5:45AM/4:45AM) and Lana Turner in The Postman Always Rings Twice (February 2 @ 8PM/7PM).\n\nThe aforementioned heart issues kept Garfield out of World War II so he fought on the big screen in the Air Force (February 23 @ 12:45AM/11:45PM), under the sea in Destination: Tokyo (February 23 @ 10:15PM/9:15PM) and on the ground in The Fallen Sparrow (February 24 @ 3AM/2AM) and The Pride of the Marines (February 23 @ 8PM/7PM). John Garfield and Bette Davis co-founded the Hollywood Canteen (February 24 @ 10AM/9AM), an integrated club that provided entertainment, food and dancing for servicemen.\n\nAfter John Garfield’s contract with Warner Bros. ended in 1947, he created his own production company, The Enterprise Studios. Their first film was the boxing drama Body and Soul (February 9 @ 9:45PM/8:45PM). Garfield was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar. The company’s next picture was Force of Evil (February 2 @ 10PM/9PM) with Garfield playing a crooked lawyer. John Garfield’s final three films were John Huston’s We Were Strangers (February 9 @ 11:45PM/10:45PM), Michael Curtiz’s The Breaking Point (February 10 @ 1:45AM/12:45AM) and the film noir He Ran All the Way (February 2 @ 11:45PM/10:45PM).\n\nIt was during the late 1940s and the early 1950s that John Garfield became a victim of the House on Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). The witch hunt led to Garfield getting less and less work and the strain eventually caused a fatal heart attack on May 21, 1952. John Garfield was 39 years old and the public was robbed of future John Garfield performances. A tragic case of what might have been.\n\nTCM SPOTLIGHT: KISS CONNECTION (THURSDAYS)\n\nTCM does a “Six Degress of Separation” connecting stars by their kissing partners. The festival beings and ends with Irene Dunne. So this is how it goes: Irene Dunne kisses Cary Grant in My Favorite Wife (February 4 @ 8PM/7PM) then Cary Grant kisses Audrey Hepburn in Charade (February 4 @ 9:45PM/8:45PM) then Audrey Hepburn kisses Gary Cooper in Love in the Afternoon (February 4 @midnight/11PM) then Gary Cooper kisses Barbara Stanwyck in Ball of Fire (February 5 @ 2:30AM/1:30AM) and so on and so on…Then it closes out with Irene Dunne in Theodora Goes Wild (February 26 @ 8:30AM/7:30AM). Other stars featured include-in order-Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Rock Hudson, Doris Day, James Garner, Kim Novak, Jimmy Stewart, Grace Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Debbie Reynolds, Gene Kelly, Cyd Charisse, Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, Joel McCrea, Claudette Colbert, Clark Gable (who also has a daytime birthday tribute on February 1), Ava Gardner, Robert Taylor, Greta Garbo, and Melvyn Douglas.\n\nTCM SPECIAL THEME: NOTEWORTHY AFRICAN-AMERICAN PERFORMANCES (WEDNESDAYS)\n\nI had a photo of Canada Lee to represent TCM’s celebration of African-American film performances but then Cicely Tyson freakin’ DIED and I felt she should be honored. Ben Mankiewicz and film historian Donald Bogle look at 16 groundbreaking performances starting with a quartet of films starring February birthday boy Sidney Poitier. First is Cry, the Beloved Country (February 3 @ 8PM/7PM), also starring Canada Lee in his final film. The duo play two ministers fighting apartheid in South Africa. Sidney’s other three films include his breakthrough as a troubled teen in Blackboard Jungle (February 3 @ 12:30AM/11:30PM), playing the restless Walter Lee Younger in the film adaptation of Lorraine Hansberry’s ground breaking play A Raisin in the Sun (February 3 @ 10PM/9PM) and bitch-slapping a racist white guy in 1967s Best Picture In the Heat of the Night (February 4 @ 2:30AM/1:30AM). Cicely Tyson gets her due co-starring along with Sammy Davis Jr. in the drama A Man Called Adam (February 11 @ 2AM/1AM) and The Heart is a Lonely Hunter (February 10 @ 11:45PM/10:45PM) .

It’s a new year and everything will be great…oh, wait.\n\nSTAR OF THE MONTH: MIRIAM HOPKINS (THURSDAYS IN JANUARY)\n\nThe first Star of the Month for 2021 was an actress who was known more for her rebelliousness and diva temperament. She was the other lady Bette Davis hated-she was number two behind Joan Crawford. I’ve just read her biography and it’s really good.\n\nEllen Miriam Hopkins was born on in Savannah, Georgia on October 18, 1902. When Miriam was a teenager, her parents split up and Miriam’s mother took Miriam and her older sister Ruby to Syracuse, New York where Hopkins later attended Syracuse University. Hopkins studied dance in New York City and was making a name for herself as a chorus girl when she had the unfortunate luck to break her ankle twice in the same place. Miriam pivoted to acting making her Broadway debut in 1921. By 1930, Miriam signed with Paramount Pictures and after a couple of pictures, she broke through as Princess Anna in The Smiling Lieutenant (January 7 @ 8PM/7PM). It was the first of three films Miriam made with director Ernst Lubitsch: the other two were 1932’s Trouble in Paradise (January 7 @ 10PM/9PM) and the pro-throuple Design for Living (January 7 @ 11:30PM/10:30PM). Hopkins also made a splash playing the doomed prostitute Champagne Ivy in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (January 8 @ 1:15AM/12:15AM). Miriam made two films with rival Bette Davis: 1939’s The Old Maid (January 14 @ 8PM/7PM) and 1943’s Old Acquaintance (January 14 @ 9:45PM/8:45PM). Miriam left Hollywood for the stage in the early 1940s but returned in 1949 for a pivotal supporting role in William Wyler’s The Heiress (January 28 @ 8PM/7PM). She also appeared in Wyler’s These Three (January 21 @ 11PM/10PM) and its remake The Children’s Hour (January 28 @ 10:15PM/9:15PM). One of her final film roles was in the all-star movie The Chase (January 28 @ 12:15AM/11:15PM). Miriam Hopkins died nine days before her 70th birthday on October 9, 1972.\n\nTCM SPOTLIGHT: WHODUNIT WEDNESDAYS\n\nPut on your thinking caps, round up the usual suspects and solve the clues as TCM highlights some of the best whodunits every Wednesday night in January. The fun starts on January 6 with Whodunit Revivals starting with a double dose of Agatha Christie’s famous detective Hercule Poirot as played by Peter Ustinov. First is Death on the Nile (8PM/7PM) followed by Evil Under the Sun (10:30PM/9:30PM).\n\nJanuary 13 starts with two whodunit spoofs-Murder By Death (8PM/7PM) and the TCM premiere of Clue (9:45PM/8:45PM).\n\nOn January 20 and 27, TCM takes a look at some of fictional super sleuths beginning with Margaret Rutherford four films as Agatha Christie’s Miss Jane Marple in Murder She Said (January 20 @ 8PM/7PM), Murder at the Gallop (January 20 @ 9:45PM/8:45PM), Murder Most Foul (January 20 @ 11:15PM/10:15PM) and Murder Ahoy (January 21 @ 1AM/midnight). Other detectives include Perry Mason in The Case of Lucky Legs (January 28 @ 2:30AM/1:30AM), Nick and Nora Charles in After the Thin Man (January 27 @ 8PM/7PM) and Sherlock Holmes in The Woman in Green (January 28 @ 1:15AM/12:15AM).\n\nSPECIAL THEME: THE STUDIO SYSTEM (TUESDAYS IN JANUARY)\n\nThe studio system, where actors, writers, directors, etc. were under contract to one studio who ruled over them with an iron fist. The studio controlled every aspect of filmmaking including owning their own theaters until 1948 when the government forced the studios to sell their theater chains.\n\nTCM looks back at the era every Tuesday in January with co-hosts Mark Harris and Kim Masters focusing on the “Big Five” (MGM, Warner Bros., 20th Century Fox, Paramount, and RKO) and the “Little Three”(Columbia, Universal, United Artists-whose films will not be shown due to being and independent studio).\n\nFirst up is Columbia during the day on January 5. Columbia started in 1924 by brothers Harry and Jack Cohn. Everyone knows their logo, the lady with the torch. Some of their top stars included Rita Hayworth (represented by Gilda (10:45AM/9:45AM), also starring fellow contract player Glenn Ford), Jean Arthur (who allegedly ran out screaming “I’m Free! I’m Free!” after completing her contract-her film is Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (12:45PM/11:45AM) which was directed by Frank Capra who brought the studio to prominence, Judy Holliday (It Should Happen to You (3PM/2PM)-also featuring Jack Lemmon in his film debut) and William Holden who also had a contract with Paramount; Holden would alternate between studios. The movie represented is The Bridge on the River Kwai (4:45PM/3:45PM).\n\nThe night of January 5 focuses on Warner Bros. which leaned toward grit and realism. They were known for their gangster pictures. The studio was started by brothers Harry, Abe, Sam and Jack Warner in 1924. Their biggest stars included Bette Davis (Dark Victory @ 8PM/7PM), Humphrey Bogart (The Maltese Falcon @ 10PM/9PM), Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland (The Adventures of Robin Hood @ midnight/11PM), James Cagney (White Heat @ 2AM/1AM), and the trio of Edward G. Robinson, Ida Lupino, and February’s Star of the Month John Garfield (The Sea Wolf @ 4:15AM/3:15AM).\n\nJanuary 12 features the now defunct studio RKO during the daytime. The studio launched with the help of JFK’s dad Joe Kennedy in 1928. RKO was known for the Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers musicals (Swing Time @ 10AM/9AM), film noirs starring Robert Mitchum co-starring with Jane Russell (His Kind of Woman @ noon/11AM). RKO also made one of the greatest pictures of all time, Citizen Kane (2:15PM/1:15PM).\n\nDuring the evening of January 12 TCM airs some of the best films from 20th Century Fox, now called 20th Century Studios. The company was formed in 1935 merging the Fox Company with Twentieth Pictures, a production company started by Joseph Schenck and Darryl F. Zanuck who became Vice President in Charge of Production for the new company. They had such stars as Marilyn Monroe (Gentlemen Prefer Blondes @ 8PM/7PM), Tyrone Power (The Mark of Zorro @ 9:45PM/8:45PM), Betty Grable (who was a top-ten box office star for ten years straight) and Don Ameche (Down Argentine Way @ 11:30PM/10:30PM), Gene Tierney and Rex Harrison (The Ghost and Mrs. Muir @ 1:15AM/122:15AM), Will Rogers (A Connecticut Yankee @ 3:15AM/2:15AM), and the little girl who got America through the Great Depression, Shirley Temple (A Little Princess @ 5AM/4AM).\n\nOn January 19 its a 24-hour block of films made by MGM. It had to be 24 hours because MGM featured “more stars than there are in the heavens.” The company was formed in 1924 with a merger of Louis B. Mayer’s production studio, the Goldwyn company, and Metro Pictures. Now on to the lengthy list:\n\nElizabeth Taylor and Mickey Rooney in National Velvet (11:15AM/10:15AM)\n\nClark Gable and Jean Harlow in Red Dust (1:30PM/12:30PM)\n\nNorma Shearer and Joan Crawford in The Women (3PM/2PM)\n\nGreta Garbo, Robert Taylor, and Lionel Barrymore in Camille (6PM/5PM)\n\nShearer again-in a dual role!-in Smiling Through (8PM/7PM)\n\nSpencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn (who started at RKO in the 1930s) in Adam’s Rib (10PM/9PM)\n\nJudy Garland and Gene Kelly in Summer Stock (midnight/11PM)\n\nLana Turner in The Postman Always Rings Twice (2AM/1AM)\n\nWilliam Powell and Myrna Loy in Love Crazy (4AM/3AM)\n\nFinally on January 26, we end Universal during the daytime. Universal is the oldest operating movie studio beginning in 1912 by Carl Laemmle. They became known for the horror films (Dracula @ 11:30AM/10:30AM), the comedy duo Bud Abbott & Lou Costello (Buck Privates @ 1PM/noon) and the singing sensation Deanna Durbin who walked away from her career before she was 30 (It Started with Eve @ 2:30PM/1:30PM).\n\nTCM ends the tribute on the night of January 26 with Paramount Pictures who also made their debut in 1912. The studio was known for its glamour and sophistication. Paramount had such stars as Mae West and Cary Grant (I’m No Angel @ 8PM/7PM), the trio of Bing Crosby, Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour (Road to Utopia @ 9:45PM/8:45PM) who made seven pictures together, Jerry Lewis (The Nutty Professor @ 11:30PM/10:30PM) who made film with and without screen partner Dean Martin, the noir team of Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake (The Blue Dahlia @ 1:30AM/12:30AM), and Marlene Dietrich and Gary Cooper (Morocco @ 3:30AM/2:30AM).\n\nContinue reading “JANUARY ON TCM” →\n\nNOVEMBER ON TCM\n\nSTAR OF THE MONTH: SHELLEY WINTERS (MONDAYS IN NOVEMBER)\n\nShelley Winters. What can you say about Shelley Winters? Well, she wasn’t dull!\n\nThat’s probably why TCM selected her to be November’s Star of the Month. The thirty films selected show Winters range and follow her career from sultry sex symbol to unlucky lady in love to scene stealer to character actress.\n\nShelley Winters was born Shirley Schrift on August 18, 1920 in St. Louis, Missouri and her family moved to Brooklyn, New York when Shirley was nine years old. Winters studied acting at the New School and also modeled to pay the bills. Shelley started working on Broadway in 1941 and within a couple of years received a long-term contract with Columbia. She had bit parts in several films until finally getting her break as a doomed waitress in Universal’s A Double Life which also won her a long-term contract with the studio. Winters received her first acting nomination as the doomed Alice in George Stevens A Place in the Sun (November 9 @ 11PM/10PM). She won her first of two Best Supporting Actress Oscars for her role as Mrs. Van Daan in The Diary of Anne Frank (November 16 @ 8PM/7PM). Shelley Winters died on January 14, 2006.\n\nThe first night features some of Winter’s early work starting with a bit part in The Gangster (November 2 @ 8PM/7PM) followed by a small supporting role in Cry of the City (November 2 @ 10PM/9PM) and leading lady roles in the comedy Behave Yourself! (November 2 @ midnight/11PM) and the noir I Died a Thousand Times (November 2 @ 1:30AM/12:30AM).\n\nNight two features Shelley as the woman unlucky in love although why is A Patch of Blue (November 9 @ 1:30AM/12:30AM) featured in this batch of films? Winters plays the bad guy for cripes sake! The other three films are Lolita (November 9 @ 8PM/7PM), A Place in the Sun (November 9 @ 11PM/10PM) and Harper (November 9 @ 3:30AM/2:30AM).\n\nNight three has Winters stealing scenes from her co-stars starting with her Oscar-winning role in The Diary of Anne Frank (November 16 @ 8PM/7PM). She donated her Oscar to the Anne Frank Museum where it still stands today. Next is a small role in one of the final film noirs, 1959’s Odds Against Tomorrow (November 16 @ 11:15PM/10:15PM) then Shelley is part of an ensemble cast in MGM’s Executive Suite (November 16 @ 1AM/midnight) and Tennessee Champ (November 16 @ 3AM/2AM).\n\nNight four features Shelley in notable Westerns including a bit part in Red River (November 23 @ 8PM/7PM) and the leading lady role in Winchester ’73 (November 23 @ 12:30AM/11:30PM).\n\nOn the final night we travel to the 1970s when Winters made a lot of “interesting” movies including playing a drug lord named “Mommy” in Cleopatra Jones (November 30 @ 4AM/3AM), a former champion swimmer who plays a critical role in The Poseidon Adventure (November 30 @ 8PM/7PM) and the real-life criminal Kate “Ma” Barker in Bloody Mama (November 30 @ 2:15AM/1:15AM).\n\nWOMEN MAKE FILM (TUESDAYS IN NOVEMBER)\n\nAs stated in the September and October on TCM posts, I will create a separate post for November plus the finale on December 1.\n\nTCM SPOTLIGHT: UNDER THE BIG TOP (FRIDAYS IN NOVEMBER)\n\nRemember the circus? TCM celebrates films focusing on life under the big top every Friday night this November. The fun starts with the Oscar-winning Best Picture The Greatest Show on Earth (November 6 @ 8PM/7PM) followed by Charlie Chaplin’s The Circus (November 6 @ 10:45PM/9:45PM). Other films on the docket include the Marx Brothers At the Circus (November 27 @ 12:15AM/11:15PM), Danny Kaye in Merry Andrew (November 20 @ midnight/11PM) and Doris Day in Billy Rose’s Jumbo (November 27 @ 10PM/9PM).\n\nNOIR ALLEY\n\nNovember’s lineup of noir starts with the snow-covered noir Nightfall (November 7 & 8), one of the last films Anne Bancroft made before returning to Broadway to star as Annie Sullivan in The Miracle Worker; the low-budget noir Fear (November 14 & 15); the apocalyptic Kiss Me Deadly (November 21 & 22) and the ice skating (?!!) show noir Suspense (November 28 & 29).\n\nANN RUTHERFORD CENTENNIAL (NOVEMBER 2)\n\nFriend of TCM Ann Rutherford would have been 100 years young on this day. TCM celebrates her with a day of her films (minus her turn in Gone With the Wind).\n\nTherese Ann Rutherford was born on November 2, 1920 in Vancouver, British Columbia to a former actress and a former opera singer. Not long after Ann’s birth, the Rutherford’s moved to San Francisco where the marriage eventually broke up. Ann’s mother took her and her sister to Los Angeles. Ann started acting in radio dramas before making her film debut in 1935. She starred in a number of Westerns until she signed with MGM in 1937 where she would stay until 1943. Her most memorable role at MGM was playing Polly Benedict, Andy Hardy’s on-again, off-again girlfriend. After leaving MGM, Ann freelanced until retiring from film work in 1950. She was asked to play Old Rose in Titanic but turned it down. Ann Rutherford died on June 11, 2012.\n\nThe day starts with Dancing Co-Ed (6AM/5AM); Ann is not the co-ed, Lana Turner is. Next Ann is one of the Four Girls in White (7:30AM/6:30AM) then Ann co-stars with the Wizard of Oz Frank Morgan in three films: the dramas Keeping Company (9AM/8AM) and Washington Melodrama (noon/11AM), plus the comedy The Ghost Comes Home (10:30AM/9:30AM) in between. Then it’s the comedic mystery trilogy Rutherford made with Red Skelton: Whistling in the Dark (1:30PM/12:30PM), Whistling in Dixie (3PM/2PM) and Whistling in Brooklyn (4:30PM/3:30PM). The tribute ends with two shorts Carnival in Paris (6PM/5PM) and Rutherford playing the title role in Annie Laurie (7:45PM/6:45PM), also a 1945 noir called Two O’Clock Courage (6:30PM/5:30PM).\n\nTHE ESSENTIALS VOL. 2 ( NOVEMBER 5)\n\nWriter Jeremy Arnold co-hosts a night of films featured in his new book The Essentials Vol. 2: 52 More Must-See Movies and Why They Matter. The films selected from the book are the ghostly romance The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (8PM/7PM) followed by the creepy Vertigo (10PM/9PM) the screwball comedy Twentieth Century (12:15AM/11:15PM) and the suspenseful Cat People (2AM/1AM).\n\nVETERANS DAY (NOVEMBER 11)\n\nTCM celebrates those who have fought for our country with seven films starting with I have never even heard of; the 1956 film Screaming Eagles (noon/11AM). Now the rest of the movies on the docket I know very well including The Best Years of Our Lives (5PM/4PM), Sergeant York (8PM/7PM), The Dirty Dozen (2PM/1PM) and From Here to Eternity (1:15AM/12:15AM).\n\nLEONARD MALTIN’S NEGLECTED CLASSICS (NOVEMBER 12)\n\nFilm critic and friend of TCM Leonard Maltin returns to take a look at five films which are not on anyone’s top 10 or best of list. First up is The Gilded Lily (8PM/7PM), a 1935 romantic comedy starring Claudette Colbert and in his film debut, Fred MacMurray. Colbert and MacMurray would make an additional six films together. Next is the TCM premiere of Come Next Spring (9:30PM/8:30PM), a drama about a single mother whose estranged husband comes back into her life. Then it’s the mystery-comedy Blind Adventure (11:15PM/10:15PM) followed by the film noir The Mob (12:30AM/11:30PM) and the pre-code movie Penthouse (2:15AM/1:15AM).\n\nMESSAGE PICTURES IN 1949 (NOVEMBER 19)\n\nThe year 1949 was a banner year for the “message picture” a subgenre where a film communicates a message about modern society. TCM takes a look at four films released during the pivotal year. Two films tell stories about a nurse (Pinky @ 11:45PM/10:45PM) and an entire family (Lost Boundaries @ 8PM/7PM) who pass for white and what happens when their true identities are revealed. The other two films focus on black men who try to navigate the experiences of being the only black soldier in your unit (Home of the Brave (10PM/9PM) and being accused of murder (Intruder in the Dust (1:45AM/12:45AM).\n\n24 HOURS OF HITCHCOCK (NOVEMBER 26 & 27)\n\nWhile your eating Thanksgiving leftovers or ordering pizza because you don’t want to eat any more turkey, TCM has your back with a 24-hour festival of Hitchcock starting on Thanksgiving night with Rear Window (8PM/7PM) and ending with Hitch’s personal favorite Shadow of a Doubt (November 27 @ 6PM/5PM).\n\nVIRGINIA MAYO CENTENNIAL (NOVEMBER 30)\n\nThe Sultan of Morocco once saw actress Virginia Mayo and stated that seeing her was “tangible proof of the existence of God.” What a compliment.\n\nVirginia Mayo was born Virginia Jones on November 30, 1920 in St. Louis, Missouri. She was the daughter of a newspaper reporter. Virginia’s aunt ran an acting school in the area where Virginia started taking lessons at the age of six. Her aunt also hired instructors to teach Virginia how to dance. After graduating high school, Virginia started landing acting and dancing jobs with the St. Louis Municipal Opera Theatre aka “The Muny.” A local performer named Andy Mayo recruited Virginia to appear in his act Morton and Mayo. She toured the vaudeville circuit and was noticed by independent producer Samuel Goldwyn. The mogul was astounded by her beauty and signed her to a Hollywood contract. She made film with comedian Danny Kaye and received rave reviews for her performance in Goldwyn’s The Best Years of Our Lives. Her film contract was taken over by Warner Bros. She continued working on films and television until the 1990s. Virginia Mayo died in 2005 at the age of 84.\n\nTCM celebrates the 100th anniversary of her birth with seven films airing during the daytime hours. The tribute starts with the 1949 comedy The Girl From Jones Beach (7AM/6AM) co-starring the 40th president, Ronald Reagan. Then its the similar musical comedies She’s Back on Broadway (8:30AM/7:30AM) and She’s Working Her Way Through College (10:15AM/9:15AM); the latter also co-starring Reagan. Mayo worked with James Cagney on two films: the musical The West Point Story (12:15PM/11:15AM) and the vicious film noir White Heat (5:45PM/4:45PM). The other two movies are film noirs: 1949’s Red Light (2:15PM/1:15PM) and 1950’s Backfire (4PM/3PM).\n\nOCTOBER ON TCM\n\nWhile in the middle of writing this post, I discovered that TCM has updated its website. I’m still deciding on how I feel about it. A positive is that the website looks brighter and is more mobile-friendly. On the other hand, I have to go to the daily/monthly schedule to find out when the films air now and I don’t know what is coming up later in the month.\n\nSTAR OF THE MONTH: PETER CUSHING (MONDAYS IN OCTOBER)\n\nIt is fitting that a horror film star is October’s Star of the Month. Peter Cushing has been credited for turning horror movies into an art form. Cushing appeared in more than 100 films in six decades including a little film called Star Wars.\n\nPeter Cushing was born on May 26, 1913 in Surrey, England to a family with a history of performing. His paternal grandfather and aunt were actor. Peter always wanted to be an actor. He performed in school plays and later won a scholarship to Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. By the age of 26, Cushing decided to try his luck in Hollywood. He did score some roles in America including a Laurel and Hardy film, A Chump at Oxford (October 6 @ 6:15AM/5:15AM) and the Carole Lombard drama Vigil in the Night (October 6 @ 7:30AM/6:30AM). As with a lot of British actors, Cushing felt the pull to return home to England when war was declared. Peter’s health prevented him from serving on the front lines, so he joined an entertainment unit and performed for the troops. There he met his wife Helen and they spent 28 years together before her death in 1971.\n\nCushing finally had his big break when he was cast as Osric in Laurence Olivier’s adaptation of Hamlet (October 6 @ 3:30AM/2:30AM). During the 1950s, Cushing had supporting roles in the first adaptation of Graham Greene’s The End of the Affair (October 5 @ 9:30PM/8:30PM) and John Paul Jones (October 6 @ 1:15AM/12:15AM). Hammer time for Cushing began in 1957 when he campaigned for the role of Baron Frankenstein in The Curse of Frankenstein (October 20 @ 1AM/midnight). The monster was played by Christopher Lee and the duo went toe-to-toe in nearly two dozen films including Horror of Dracula (October 19 @ 9:30PM/8:30PM), The Hound of the Baskervilles (October 19 @ 8PM/7PM) and The Mummy (October 19 @ 11:15PM/10:15PM). Peter Cushing made a total of 22 films for Hammer Horror. Peter Cushing died in 1994 at the age of 81.\n\nWOMEN MAKE FILM (TUESDAYS IN OCTOBER)\n\nAs stated in the September on TCM post, I will be creating a separate post on October’s lineup of Women Make Film.\n\nTCM SPOTLIGHT: 30 YEARS OF THE FILM FOUNDATION (THURSDAYS IN OCTOBER)\n\nTCM celebrates the 30th anniversary of The Film Foundation, a non-profit established by Martin Scorsese and other filmmakers to restore, preserve, and protect motion picture history. The Film Foundation has restored over 850 films (and counting) that have been made available to museums, festivals and institutions around the world.

Curtis’s brother Julius was killed when he was struck by a car. A few years later, Tony enlisted in the Navy and was honorably discharged at the end of WWII. He took advantage of the GI Bill and enrolled at the City College of New York and then attended The New School where he studied acting with such luminaries as Bea Arthur, Rod Steiger, and Harry Belafonte.\n\nA meeting with an agent led to a contract with Universal Pictures. Curtis made his film debut in the film noir Criss Cross in 1949. Tony Curtis would go on to make such films as Trapeze (July 6 @ 8PM/7PM), where he co-starred with Burt Lancaster; The Defiant Ones (July 6 @ 10PM/9PM), where he co-starred with Sidney Poitier and received his only Oscar nomination; The Vikings (July 6 @ 11:45PM/10:45PM) and Spartacus (July 20@ 8PM/7PM), where he co-starred with Kirk Douglas; Taras Bulba (July 20 @ 3:45AM/2:45AM), co-starring Yul Brynner and where he met his second wife, who was seventeen during filming; Some Like it Hot (July 13 @ 8PM/7PM), Curtis’ best-remembered performance; The Perfect Furlough (July 13 @ 12:30AM/11:30PM) and Who Was That Lady?

Some of the films include Singin’ in the Rain (July 2 @ 8PM/7PM), Annie (10PM/9PM), Harvey (July 9 @ 8PM/7PM), Bringing Up Baby (July 9 @ 10PM/9PM), A Night at the Opera (July 9 @ midnight/11PM), Meet Me in St. Louis (July 15 @ 10:30PM/9:30PM), His Girl Friday (July 22 @ 1AM/midnight), It Happened One Night (July 15 @ 5AM/4AM), The Thin Man (July 29 @ 8PM/7PM), and The Lady Eve (July 29 @ 12:30AM/11:30PM). So sit back and laugh this month because we all need it.\n\nTCM SPECIAL THEME: DIRECTED BY JOHN FORD (FRIDAYS IN JULY)\n\nJohn Ford once announced to his colleagues “My name is John Ford. I make Westerns.” Yes, Ford did make Westerns, very good Westerns, but he was so much more. TCM celebrates the only director with four Best Director Oscars every Friday in July. The fest starts with one of Ford’s personal favorites, Wagon Master (July 3 @ noon/11AM). Other movies airing July 3 include the first two films of the Calvary trilogy She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (July 3 @ 3:30PM/2:30PM) and Fort Apache (5:30PM/4:30PM). The evening lineup includes Ford masterpieces Stagecoach (12:15AM/11:15PM) and The Searchers (10PM/9PM).

Going a little stir-crazy. Luckily, this month TCM has a new season of The Essentials, Edward G. Robinson is the Star of the Month, a spotlight on Asian-Americans in Classic Hollywood, a night of films starring Natalie Wood, a festival of some awesome real-life ladies, pre-code premieres, and a night of Rankin-Bass films!\n\nSTAR OF THE MONTH: EDWARD G. ROBINSON (THURSDAYS IN MAY)\n\nThird time’s the charm for May’s SOTM Edward G. Robinson, who I unknowningly discovered while watching Looney Tunes as a kid. He was frequently parodied even having a semi-recurring character, Rocky, in the cartoons.\n\nThe festival is divided into the types of characters he played, beginning on May 7 with the roles he was most associated with, the gangster. Films such as Little Caesar and Key Largo will be shown. May 14 shows off Eddie’s funny side with The Whole Town’s Talking (8PM/7PM) and A Slight Case of Murder (9:45PM/8:45PM) will air. May 21 shows of Robinson’s good guy side with such films as the noir classic Double Indemnity (11:30PM/10:30PM). Finally, on May 28, we will see the dramatic side of Eddie G. starting with the family drama Our Vines Have Tender Grapes (8PM/7PM) and the double doses of noir The Woman in the Window (10PM/9PM) and Scarlet Street (11:45PM/10:45PM).\n\nTCM SPOTLIGHT: ASIAN AMERICANS IN HOLLYWOOD (WEDNESDAYS IN MAY)\n\nThis month’s spotlight focuses on Asian-American performers in Hollywood history. Actress Nancy Kwan introduces 14 films starting with silent film star Sessue Hayakawa in The Dragon Painter (May 6 @ 8PM/7PM) and a double dose of Anna May Wong in Picadilly (May 6 @ 9PM/8PM) and Daughter of Shanghai (May 6 @ 11PM/10PM). Other actors included in the tribute are Merle Oberon in Night Song (May 6 @ 4AM/3AM), James Shigeta in The Crimson Kimono (May 13 @ 8PM/7PM) and Flower Drum Song (May 20 @ 8PM/7PM); the latter film also stars co-host Nancy Kwan, Shirley Yamaguchi in House of Bamboo (May 13 @ 9:30PM/8:30PM), and Miyoshi Umeki in her Oscar-winning role in Sayonara (May 20 @ 10:30PM/9:30PM).\n\nTCM SPECIAL THEME: WONDER WOMEN (TUESDAYS IN MAY)\n\nMove over men, on Tuesday nights its all about the ladies. TCM hosts Alicia Malone and Jacqueline Stewart focus on some of history’s most kick-ass gals. The festival starts with Marlene Dietrich in The Scarlet Empress (May 5 @ 8PM/7PM) and Elizabeth Taylor as the title character Cleopatra (May 5 @ 10PM/9PM). Other featured famous women include Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke as Annie Sullivan and Helen Keller in The Miracle Worker (May 12 @ 8PM/7PM), June Allyson as the first woman to practice in a NYC hospital in The Girl in White (May 19 @ 10:15PM/9:15PM), and Barbra Streisand as Fanny Brice in Funny Girl (May 26 @ 1AM/midnight) and Funny Lady (May 26 @ 3:45AM/2:45AM).\n\nTHE ESSENTIALS (SATURDAY EVENINGS AT 8PM/7PM)\n\nFormer Simpsons consultant and the voice of Edna Mode, Brad Bird is the new co-host for the 2020-2021 season of The Essentials. Bird’s first choices are the greatest musical of all-time Singin’ in the Rain (May 2), followed by the ahead of its time Ace in the Hole (May 9), Buster Keaton’s magnum opus The General (May 16), Casablanca (May 23), and a story between choosing your passion or love The Red Shoes (May 30).\n\nNOIR ALLEY\n\nThis month’s picks from the “Czar of Noir’ Eddie Muller are Otto Preminger’s Fallen Angel (May 2 & 3), the reason for birth control story Mildred Pierce (May 9 & 10), Samuel Fuller’s The Crimson Kimono (May 16 & 17), the post-WWII thriller Cornered (May 23 & 24), and A Kiss Before Dying (May 30 & 31).\n\nPRE-CODE PREMIERES (MAY 3)\n\nPeople in my generation and younger believe the movies made before they were born were old and stuffy. Well, they haven’t seen Pre-Code Hollywood movies. Movies made during 1929 through the first half of 1934 were daring and provocative. Topics such as sex outside of marriage, drug use, homosexuality, and abortion were frequently discussed. TCM will premiere three bold pre-code dramas starting with The Silver Cord (8PM/7PM), a tale of when motherly love goes into a really creepy direction. Irene Dunne stars as a scientist/newlywed whose meets the mother-in-law from hell. Not to be outdone, Mommy tries breaking up her other son’s engagement. Next is The Sin of Nora Moran (9:30PM/8:30PM), a film which is better known by its poster.\n\nIt’s about a woman who has the worst luck imaginable and takes the murder rap for her lover. Finally, it’s the premiere of Once to Every Woman (10:45PM/9:45PM), starring Fay Wray as a nurse who clashes with a new doctor played by Ralph Bellamy. Hey maybe this time he’ll get the girl!\n\nSTARRING NATALIE WOOD (MAY 4)\n\nTCM celebrates the career of Natalie Wood with four films airing this evening in anticipation for the release of a new documentary about her life, Natalie Wood: What Remains Behind, airing May 5 on HBO. The tribute starts with her Oscar-nominated role inSplendor in the Grass (8PM/7PM), followed by The Searchers (10:15PM/9:15PM) Gypsy (12:30AM/11:30PM)and another Oscar-nominated role in Rebel Without a Cause (3AM/2AM).\n\n75TH ANNIVERSARY OF V-E DAY (MAY 8)\n\nOn May 8, 1945, Germany officially surrendered and one half of WWII was finally over. TCM celebrates with three films starting with The Last Time I Saw Paris (8PM/7PM), followed by Mister Roberts (11:15PM/10:15PM), and the first adaptation of Graham Greene’s The End of the Affair (1:30AM/12:30AM).\n\nMOTHER’S DAY (MAY 10)\n\nHave you got you Mom a present for Mother’s Day yet? You could give her a day of TCM with such perennial favorites as Light in the Piazza (8AM/7AM), Baby Boom (6PM/5PM), I Remember Mama (8PM/7PM), and Stella Dallas (10:30PM/9:30PM).\n\nNATIONAL TAP DANCING DAY (MAY 11)\n\nI just discovered that May 25th is National Tap Dancing Day. Since the day also falls on Memorial Day, TCM celebrates two weeks early with some of the best tap dancers ever put on screen plus the premiere of a 1979 documentary No Maps on My Taps (8PM/7PM). Here are some clips of these dancers from the films that will be seen today.\n\nTCM REMEMBERS DANNY AIELLO (MAY 17)\n\nTCM remembers the Oscar-nominated actor who died in December 2019 with a double feature with Woody Allen’s The Purple Rose of Cairo (8PM/7PM) and his memorable turn in Moonstruck (10:45PM/9:45PM).\n\nRANKIN AND BASS (MAY 22)\n\nThis comes as a shock (at least to me), but Rankin/Bass, the duo who created some of the most memorable Christmas classics, made several feature-length films! TCM presents three of them starting with Mad Monster Party? (8PM/7PM), followed by The Daydreamer (10PM/9PM) and The Wacky World of Mother Goose (midnight/11PM).\n\nMEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND (MAY 23-25)\n\nTCM’s annual tribute to those who served our country with a slate of films covering the Civil War to Vietnam. Films on the docket include Glory (May 23 @ 9:30AM/8:30AM), The Steel Helmet (May 23 @ 4PM/3PM), Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo (May 24 @ noon/11AM), Wings (May 24 @ 12:30AM/11:30PM), The Great Escape (May 25 @ 11:15AM/10:15AM), and The Best Years of Our Lives (May 25 @ 8PM/7PM)."
