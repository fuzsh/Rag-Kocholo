        "text": "Laurence Olivier was an award-winning English actor, director, and producer. He is considered by many to be one of the greatest stage and screen actors of all time and is regarded as one of the leading Shakespeare interpreters of the 20th century.\n\nThough Olivier’s life was primarily based in England, he was a popular American actor as well. He is best known for his interpretation of Shakespeare and he starred in several films based on stage productions of Shakespeare, including Henry V, Hamlet, and Richard III.\n\nBiography\n\nHe was born Laurence Kerr Olivier in the year 1907. Olivier’s father, Gerard, was a clergyman. Laurence was very close to his mother, Agnes, and was devastated when she died when he was just 12 years old. Olivier had two older siblings, Richard and Sybille. His family called him by the nickname “Kim.”\n\nOlivier as a child\n\n(Image courtesy of http://www.murphsplace.com/olivier/)\n\nOlivier was an intelligent child and became interested in the theatre at a very early age. His father, an enthusiastic theatre lover, was the one who decided Laurence should become an actor. He made his first public appearance at nine years old, playing Brutus in his school’s production of Julius Caesar. At 15 years of age, he played Katherine in The Taming of the Shrew at St. Edward’s School in Oxford, England. (It was not unusual for boys to play the role of females in all-boy school productions.) Olivier attended the Central School of Dramatic Art at age 17. In 1926, he joined the Birmingham Repertory Company, and by 1930 was playing serious roles such as Romeo, Hamlet, and Macbeth.\n\nLaurence Olivier was married three times, all to British actresses. His first marriage to Jill Esmond lasted ten years and produced a son, Tarquin. It is said he was not happy in his marriage to Jill Esmond from the very beginning. After an affair that began while they were both married to other people, Olivier married Vivian Leigh, most famous for her role as Scarlett O’Hara in Gone with the Wind. This second marriage was plagued by Leigh’s episodes related to manic depression and bipolar disorder. His third marriage was to Joan Plowright, who he remained married to until his death. Together they had two daughters, Julie Kate and Tamsin, and a son, Richard.\n\nAn interesting fact about Laurence Olivier, which has been refuted by his family, is that he was rumored to be bisexual. He is said to have had affairs with Danny Kaye, Henry Ainley, and was even seen kissing Marlon Brando during his marriage to Vivian Leigh.\n\nOlivier joined the Royal Air Force during World War II and learned to fly, though he never actually went into combat operations. A biography of Laurence Olivier, called Lord Larry and written by Michael Munn, claims that in 1940 Olivier was recruited as an agent by the Special Operations Executive, at the request of Winston Churchhill, to gain the support of the United States for Great Britain’s war with Germany.\n\nOlivier suffered from several illnesses during the last twenty-two years of his life including prostate cancer, pleurisy, and a degenerative muscle disorder. He fought off his many ailments by throwing himself into his acting career. Olivier continued to act until his death, and more than half of his film credits come after he played in The Entertainer in 1960 when he was 53 years old; however, most of these where not leading roles.\n\nLaurence Olivier died of cancer in 1989 and his ashes are buried in the Poets’ Corner at Westminster Abbey in London. This month (September 2007), the National Theatre will mark the 100th year of his birth with a Centenary Celebration and unveil a statue of Olivier as Hamlet in the National Theatre’s Square.\n\nCareer Highlights\n\nLaurence was not a big fan of film, considering it inferior to the theatre, and he was most at home on the stage. But he eventually made his film debut in a movie called The Temporary Widow. In his first Hollywood movie, Yellow Ticket in 1931, Olivier played the lead part. He became a major celebrity and an international matinee idol in 1939 when he was nominated for an Academy Award for his role as Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights. Several other hits followed, including Rebecca and That Hamilton Woman. During his marriage to Vivian Leigh, they starred together in many plays in London and America, filming a movie here and there when money got low. From 1962 to 1973, Olivier headed London's National Theatre Company. His most productive period came from directing, producing, and also starring in Shakespeare’s Henry V and Hamlet. During a career that lasted over six decades, Olivier appeared in over 120 plays, and as many as 75 movies and television shows.\n\nPhotographs of Laurence Olivier throughout his career\n\n(Image courtesy of http://swilley7.150m.com/)\n\nIn 1947, Olivier won his first Academy Award, an honorary award for his outstanding achievement as actor, producer, and director in Henry V. He was nominated for 14 Oscars total, including Best Actor for his roles in Othello, The Entertainer, and Richard III. Olivier won the Best Film and Best Actor Academy Awards in 1949 for Hamlet. He was presented with his second honorary Academy Award in 1979 for lifetime achievement. Among his many other achievements, he was also nominated for and won multiple Emmys and Golden Globes. In 1999, the Olivier was named among the Greatest Male Stars of All Time by the American Film Institute.\n\nOlivier was knighted by the Queen of England in 1947, and in 1970 he was made \"Baron Olivier of Brighton\" for his work in the theater, which allowed him to sit in the House of the Lords, the second chamber in the United Kingdom’s Parliament. In 1981 he was given the Order of Merit, a reward for distinguished service in the armed forces, science, art, literature, or for the promotion of culture.\n\nBibliography\n\nOfficial Web Site of Sir Laurence Olivier\n\nLaurence Olivier (Life & Times), Francis Beckett, Haus Publishing Limited, London, 2005\n\nLinks\n\nWikipedia page, Laurence Olivier\n\nInternet Movie Database, Laurence Olivier\n\nThis page was created for Theater Appreciation I, Summer 2007 Semester, Northern Virginia Community College."
