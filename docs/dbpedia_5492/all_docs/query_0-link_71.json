        "text": "Whether you observe it as a regional ethnic and/or religious holiday (in Ireland it’s a solemnity and holy day of obligation) or as an excuse to go all out and drink green Guinness beer at the parades, Saint Patrick’s Day seems to have something for everyone ranging from leprechauns, Irish music, riverdance, the major city parades, pots of gold and rainbows, shamrocks, 4 leaf clovers. Celtic Crosses, and green beer as well as excessive alcohol consumption of beer and whiskey. If you live in Chicago, then the city’s waterways will be green. For those who don’t know anything about Saint Patrick, he was a 5th century Romano-British guy who was kidnapped by pirates and enslaved in Ireland for 6 years. Once he escaped, he decided to become a priest and return there as a missionary to convert the Irish to Christianity and was later consecrated as a bishop. After he died, he was made patron saint of Ireland as well as my dad’s namesake. Now the reason we all wear green on Saint Patrick’s Day because most of Ireland is Roman Catholic and let’s say unless you went to high school with me, you don’t want to wear orange on March 17th because it denotes Protestantism and domination under the British Crown. And if you’re in Northern Ireland on Saint Patrick’s Day, well, you might not want to wear either (but the violence going on there is political, by the way). Oh, and he didn’t drive all the snakes out of Ireland either that’s just a symbolic parable since there were no snakes in Ireland to begin with yet, the shamrock story was probably real, sort of. Pittsburgh is one of the many places that celebrates Saint Patrick’s Day with a parade. And while the Irish can complain all they want to about how the Americans commemorate their patron saint’s day, it’s one of the reasons why Saint Patrick’s Day is such a popular holiday all over the world that it’s even celebrated in Japan (with some celebrations lasting all through March), Malaysia, Germany, Switzerland, France, South Korea, Argentina, and Russia (with celebrations lasting for over a week). Yet, fortunately for them, this one isn’t about Irish drinks though I might do a post on that in the future. Instead, I’ll do a post on all the wonderful treats you can make (or buy) for your Saint Patrick’s Day party whether you be a parent, repressed culinary arts student, or whatever. So to celebrate Irish pride, be wasted, or needing celebrate something between Mardi Gras and Easter, I give you my post on these Lucky Saint Patrick’s Day treats.\n\n1.

Now while actresses in Hollywood have always had less opportunity than men, ladies in the Golden Age of Hollywood didn’t have much better, especially with the morality clauses. Of course, a lot of actresses I’ve known during that period were in only a few known films and had less roles in movies I’ve never heard of as they aged. Yet, some who weren’t cast for their youth and beauty tended to be confined to character and supporting roles. So it’s no surprise that I didn’t compile as many. Yet, in this final edition here are 10 more. First, we have Margaret Hamilton famous for playing the Wicked Witch of the West but was actually a rather nice lady followed by Mildred Dunnock a schoolteacher who later played Mrs. Loman in Death of a Salesman. Second, there are versatile actresses Geraldine Fitzgerald and Ann Southern who’ve both had long careers as well as Nina Foch who played the Pharaoh’s daughter in The Ten Commandments (the one who found Moses). After them comes Dame Flora Robson though not pretty played roles ranging from maids, queens, and serial killers on stage and screen followed by Una O’Connor who mostly played maids. Then there’s wholesome cute girl Jean Crain whom studios wanted to play teenagers for years. Next is Cyd Charisse best known for her long marriage to Tony Martin as well as her roles in movie musicals during the 1940s and 1950s. And last but not least is the first icy Hitchcock blonde herself, Madeleine Carroll. So without further adieu, here are 10 Oscar less actresses for your reading pleasure in this final edition I bring to you.\n\n191. Margaret Hamilton\n\nPersonal Life: (1902-1985) Born in Cleveland, Ohio. Attended Wheelock College in Boston where she became a teacher. Made her stage debut in 1923. Made her first film in 1933. Married to Paul Meserve for 7 years and had a son she raised on her own. Retired in 1982. Died of a heart attack in Salisbury, Connecticut at 82.\n\nFamous for: American character actress best known as the Wicked Witch of the West from The Wizard of Oz. Career spanned for nearly 50 years and usually playing spinsters, particularly of the New England variety. Notable roles are Madame Du Barry from Hat, Coat, and Glove, Lucy Gurget from The Farmer Takes a Wife, Martha Perkins from Way Down East, Agatha from These Three, Drugstore Lady from Nothing Sacred, Mrs. Harper from The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Miss Gulch / The Wicked Witch of the West from The Wizard of Oz, Martha Steele from Babes in Arms, Mrs. Gideon from My Little Chickadee, Mrs. Jackson from The Invisible Woman, Norah from Twin Beds, Mrs. Larch from The Ox-Bow Incident, Myrtle Ferguson from Johnny Come Lately, Norah from State of the Union, Teacher from The Red Pony, Mrs. Theresa Appleby from Bungalow 13, Elaine Zacharides from 13 Ghosts, Mrs. Nicholson from Paradise Alley, Miss Kaller from The Anderson Tapes, Daphne Heap from Brewster McCloud, and Mae from Rosie!.\n\nNominated for: Hamilton was never nominated for an Oscar.\n\nMost Crushing Loss: Not being nominated for Best Supporting Actress in 1939 for The Wizard of Oz. Man, she was one mean and green witch.\n\nReasons: Trust me, you don’t want to give a statuette to a woman best known for playing a notorious villain known to traumatize kids for generations. It’s kind of a shame since she was a very nice person who cared deeply about children and frequently gave to charitable organizations. And it didn’t help that many children believed she was mean in real life.\n\nTrivia: During the 1930s, she never put herself under contract to any one studio and priced her services at $1,000 a week to support herself and her son. Garland visited her and looked after her son while she was recovering in the hospital after she suffered burns during her exit from Munchkinland filming. When she returned, she said, “I won’t sue, because I know how this business works, and I would never work again. I will return to work on one condition — no more fireworks!” A stand-in for her wasn’t so lucky. Son commented that she enjoyed saying, “I’ll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too!”-that she sometimes used it in real life. Took roles in whatever medium she could get if she was free. Though she reprised her famous role on Sesame Street, her appearance hasn’t been aired since 1976 as a result of complaints from parents of terrified children. Yet, she also appeared on Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood where she explained that she wasn’t a bad witch. Appeared in PSAs for organizations promoting the welfare of pets. Was lifelong friends with Ray Bolger. Served on the Beverly Hills Board of Education between 1948 to 1951, and was a Sunday school teacher during the 1950s.Said The Wizard of Oz was her favorite book since she was 4.\n\n192.

I mean she should get something after what Richard Widmark did to her in that movie.\n\nReasons: Dunnock was nominated in very bad years and was burned out by the competition.\n\nTrivia: Was a founding member of the Actors Studio.\n\n193. Geraldine Fitzgerald\n\nPersonal Life: (1913-2005) Born in Greystones, County Wicklow in Ireland. Father was an attorney.

Notable roles are\n\nMaggie Tulliver from The Mill of the Floss, Isabella from Wuthering Heights, Ann King from Dark Victory, Marthe de Brancovis from Watch on the Rhine, Edith Bolling Galt from Wilson,\n\nEllen Rogers / Elaine Duprez from O. S. S., Gladys Halvorsen from Nobody Lives Forever, Elizabeth Grahame from The Obsessed, Marilyn Birchfield from The Pawnbroker, Rev. Wood from Rachel, Rachel, Mrs. Jackson from The Last American Hero, Jessie from Harry and Tonto, Grandma Carr from The Mango Tree, Maud Kennaway from Diary of the Dead, Martha Bach from Arthur, and Mrs. Monahan from Easy Money.\n\nNominated for: Fitzgerald was nominated for Best Supporting Actress in 1939 for Wuthering Heights.\n\nMost Crushing Loss: Not receiving an honorary Oscar for her long and varied career.\n\nReasons: Perhaps it’s due to that we’re not sure who Michael Lindsay-Hogg’s father who’s said to resemble Orson Welles. Also was burned by the competition in 1939.\n\nTrivia: Second husband was grandson of Isidor Straus who died on the Titanic. Was one of the first women to receive a Tony nomination for directing. Spent time as a cabaret singer in the 1970s. Mother of Let It Be director Michael Lindsay-Hogg but we’re not sure whether his father was her first husband or Orson Welles.\n\n194. Nina Foch\n\nPersonal Life: (1924-2008) Born Nina Consuelo Maud Fock in Leiden, Netherlands. Mother was an American actress and singer while father was a Dutch classical music conductor. Went with her mother to the US as a toddler after her parents divorced. Made her first film in 1943. Married 3 times and had a son to second husband Dennis de Brito.

Yes, she didn’t have enough screen time but her portrayal of a Roman aristocrat was one of the most historically accurate in movie history.\n\nReasons: Probably had to do with the fact she was in a lot of horror movies early in her career. Also burned by the competition when she was nominated. I mean it should’ve been clear that Eva Marie Saint was going to win.\n\nTrivia: Taught at the University of Southern California’s School of Cinematic Arts as well as spent time as an acting coach. Last name “Foch” rhymes with “Gosh” (I can see where mispronunciations can get out of hand).\n\n195. Cyd Charisse\n\nPersonal Life: (1922-2008) Born Tula Ellice Finklea in Amarillo, Texas.

Seriously, she’s one of the best known dancers in 1950s musicals. Not to mention, she had to make herself look shorter than some of her co-stars like Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire which was no easy task.\n\nReasons: Charisse is best known for her dancing in musicals and her long marriage to Tony Martin but not much else. And basically only acted sporadically after the 1950s.\n\nTrivia: Was listed under The Guinness Book of World Records for “Most Valuable Legs” because it’s said MGM reportedly insured for $5 million, though she claimed this was false. Wrote a joint memoir with second husband Tony Martin. Stage name originated from her brother’s nickname for her, “Sid” which was a mispronunciation of “Sis” and the last name of her first husband Nico Charisse. Awarded the National Medal of the Arts and Humanities in 2006. Daughter-in-law died in the American Airlines Flight 191 tragedy on May 25, 1979.

Also known to appear in a lot of horror movies and came from a Catholic nationalist family from Northern Ireland.\n\nTrivia: Would not work on any radio program sponsored by a company that distributed or manufactured alcohol in any form.\n\n197. Dame Flora Robson\n\nPersonal Life: (1902-1984) Born in South Shields, Durham in England. Came from a family of engineers and her father was a ship’s engineer who noticed her talent at 5. Grew up in London and attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.

Private life mostly focused on her sisters so she never married or had children. Retired in 1981. Possibly died of cancer at 82.\n\nFamous for: British actress and star of stage and cinema particularly renowned for her performances in plays demanding dramatic and emotional intensity.

Also, Saratoga Trunk wasn’t a good movie according to critics. Not to mention being burned by the competition.\n\nTrivia: Was of Scottish descent.

As Gene Tierney’s adoptive sister, she manages to hide a large amount of angst underneath that veneer of smiles and wholesomeness.\n\nReasons: Crain was more or less burned by the competition. Also, her character was supposed to be black passing for white, which should’ve went to Lena Horne anyway. Not to mention, while she hoped her role in Pinky would give her more serious parts, 20th Century Fox had other ideas like casting her as a 13 year old despite being 25, married, and a mother. Being cast as cute girls would get her passed over for more serious roles she should’ve played.\n\nTrivia: Also noted for her ice skating.

Also, not receiving the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award for her tireless efforts during and after WWII.\n\nReasons: Well, for one, there weren’t as many slots for Academy Award nominees as there are now in the 1930s (especially in the early years). Also, took an acting hiatus in WWII after her sister was killed in a German air raid during the Blitz and would be involved in the plight of European children some time afterwards.\n\nTrivia: Was the first Hitchcock blonde.

First British beauty to be offered a major American film contract. Fourth husband was publisher of Life Magazine.\n\nSeems like we’re getting close to the end here and one more to go after this. Of course, we all know that visual effects have always been a mainstay in Hollywood since King Kong came out in the 1930s. It was released by Universal, a studio which was also know for all their great horror and monster movies your parents probably seen when they were kids. I’m not sure how many of them were scared but the visual effects don’t really translate well for those who’ve been raised on Star Wars and CGI. In this penultimate installment, I give you 10 more legendary movie stars from the Golden Age of Hollywood or at least retired or dead. First, there is Hume Cronyn who’s better known as Jessica Tandy’s Canadian husband followed by William Demarest who appeared in 140 films. Second, is Henry Travers you most people remember as Clarence the angel from It’s a Wonderful Life followed by fellow Brit supporting player Leo Genn. After that is River Phoenix who’s best known as a promising young actor who succumbed to a drug induced death at 23. Then we have Billie Burke who’s better known as Glinda the Good Witch from The Wizard of Oz as well a British swashbuckler Stewart Granger. Next, is versatile actress Ann Sheridan who was a pin-up in the 1940s in which she was known as “The Oomph Girl” as well as 1960s sex symbol Carroll Baker. And finally, we have pioneering scream queen Fay Wray who most of us remember from King Kong. So without further adieu, here are 10 more Oscar losers and also-rans in this pentultimate installment of my stars series.\n\n181.

As a brutal prison guard, he’s almost as cruel as the ones from The Shawshank Redemption.\n\nReasons: During his nomination, he was just burned by the competition. Yet, I didn’t think Barry Fitzgerald should’ve won that year.\n\nTrivia: Great-grandfather was an archbishop and founder of Huron College that became the University of Western Ontario.

Kiper from What Price Glory, Father Belacchi from The Mountain, and Mr. Martin from Viva Las Vegas.\n\nNominated for: Demarest was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in 1947 for The Jolson Story.\n\nMost Crushing Loss: Not being nominated for Best Supporting Actor in 1941 for The Lady Eve as Henry Fonda’s smart ass valet who basically steals every scene he’s in.\n\nReasons: I think his collaborations with Preston Sturges might’ve made him Oscar ineligible, especially the Miracle on Morgan’s Creek. Also, was better known for his comic performances.\n\nTrivia: Was Uncle Charlie on My Three Sons. Favorite recreations were hunting, fishing, golf, and playing the cello.\n\n183.

Sure he may not have a showy role but man, he just gives a great performance of a guy just wanting to do his job yet very conflicted about feeding Gregory Peck’s Captain Ahab to the sharks. Still, it’s kind of sad that his character’s name is now the moniker for a major coffee chain based in Seattle.\n\nReasons: Genn was nominated for an Oscar in a very bad year and was burned by the competition. Not to mention, he starred in a lot of forgettable movies soon afterward.\n\nTrivia: Was a qualified lawyer.

Spent part of his childhood in the Caribbean and Venezuela where his family became vegans. Family name changed to Phoenix when they moved to Florida. Never attended formal school. Collapsed and died of drug-induced heart failure on the sidewalk outside the West Hollywood nightclub The Viper Room, at 23.\n\nFamous for: American actor, musician and activist whose rise to fame lent to the status of “teen sensation.” Started acting in commercials from the age of 10. Notable roles are Wolfgang Müller from Explorers, Chris Chambers from Stand By Me, Charlie Fox from The Mosquito Coast, Jeff Grant from Little Nikita, Danny Pope / Michael Manfield from Running on Empty, Devo Nod from I Love You to Death, Eddie Birdlace from Dogfight, Mike Waters from My Own Private Idaho, and James Wright from The Thing Called Love.\n\nNominated for: Phoenix was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in 1988 for Running on Empty.\n\nMost Crushing Loss: I’m not really sure because I’m not very familiar with his performances. Yet his status as a promising teen idol and his subsequent premature death is basically what made him so famous in pop culture today. Of course, many would say losing the Oscar to Kevin Kline in the 1988 Best Supporting Actor race, but I’m not sure if I’d go that far since A Fish Called Wanda actually is very funny and that the Academy usually ignores great comic performances.\n\nReasons: Well, most likely burned by the competition by much more experienced actors. Not to mention, at this point most people thought he’d probably get his chance someday but died young.\n\nTrivia: Brother of Joaquin, Rain, Liberty, and Summer Phoenix. Was an environmental and animal rights activist as well as spokesman for PETA.\n\n186. Stewart Granger\n\nPersonal Life: (1913-1993) Born James Stewart in London. Dad was a major.

Married 3 times with his second wife being Jean Simmons and had 4 children. Became a US citizen in 1956.

However, this was a very different story in Continental Europe, particularly in Germany.\n\nTrivia: Second great grandfather was an opera singer. Was friends with Michael Wilding who’s best known as Elizabeth Taylor’s second husband and father of her 2 sons.

Married to third husband Donald Barton for 29 years.\n\nFamous for: American actress who has enjoyed popularity as a serious dramatic actress and as a sex symbol. Was cast in a wide range of roles during the 1960s and was especially memorable playing brash and flamboyant women due to her beautiful features, striking blonde hair, and distinctive drawl.

Seriously, Baker should’ve at least lost to Deborah Kerr. Also, her loss may have been a bit unfair and due to the Moral Police if you get my drift.\n\nReasons: Well, she was a seen as a sex symbol and the fact that her movie Baby Doll was condemned by the Roman Catholic National Legion of Decency. Also was said to be blackballed later in her career for turning down parts and being viciously attacked by the press as well as protracted legal battles with Paramount.

Then again, this isn’t surprising.\n\nReasons: Wray was best known as a scream queen in horror movies and is best known for playing love interest to a giant mutant gorilla with a white woman fixation. Yeah, it’s easy to see why she didn’t get one.\n\nTrivia: Despite her role in King Kong, she was actually a brunette and wore wig during the filming. Was cast in a sitcom during the 1950s. Two days after her death the lights of the Empire State Building dimmed for 15 minutes in her memory. Has a park named after her at her birthplace.\n\n189.

Catherine Gates from I Was a Male War Bride, Nora Bayes from Shine on Harvest Moon, and Amanda from The Opposite Sex.\n\nNominated for: Sheridan was never nominated for an Oscar.\n\nMost Crushing Loss: Not being nominated for Best Supporting Actress in 1942 for The Man Who Came to Dinner, in which she acts like a 1940s version of Jenna Maroney.\n\nReasons: Despite her undeniable talent and versatility, she was seen as a sex symbol due to her pin-up days in the 1940s. Also, her career was in decline in the 1950s. Still, she had to fight to be taken seriously by Hollywood.\n\nTrivia: Was called, “The Oomph Girl,” a nickname she loathed during her 1940s pin-up days.

Best known as Glinda from The Wizard of Oz. Voice was unique in intonation, which she accentuated in her later character roles as dim-witted, spoiled society types.

Still, she was also typecast as dim-witted spoiled society types in her later years. Not to mention, she was always seen as Glinda from The Wizard of Oz.\n\nTrivia: Wrote 2 autobiographies. Had her own show on radio and TV.\n\nNow while I did put some stars from the silent era, I only focused on ones who appeared on sound pictures. Yet the reason for this is that there were no Oscars awarded during the Silent Era and that many of the silent stars didn’t transition to sound either. And there were even some like Rudolph Valentino who were dead by the time The Jazz Singer came out in the late 1920s. Sure silent movies may have dialogue cards instead of subtitles yet for awhile, it was quite an art form in the 1920s with films ranging from silent epics, German expressionist pieces, and comedies by Harold Lloyd, Buster Keaton, and Charlie Chaplin. And then there’s D. W. Griffith’s Birth of a Nation, which should only be seen for its artistic merits and only for required viewing, because it’s so racist that it makes Gone With the Wind look like Glory in comparison. In this selection, I bring you 10 more actors and actresses who have never received a competitive Academy Award. First, we have Frank Morgan who’s best known as the not so wonderful Wizard of Oz. Second, is German actor Conrad Veidt whose career spanned from playing German horror villains to Nazis followed by African American entertainment legend and blacklisted civil rights activist Paul Robeson. Third, comes Mae West who was the master of the double entendre and whose scandal ridden public life put Madonna to shame. Then we have Jill Clayburgh whose career spanned 40 years and is best remembered by my generation for playing Kristen Wiig’s mom on Bridesmaids. After that is Jack Hawkins who appeared in films like Ben Hur and The Bridge on the River Kwai yet his career and life was hurt by smoking followed by Indian actor Sabu best known for playing Mowgli yet suffered a case from typecasting after WWII. Then there’s Irish acting legend David Kelly who was Charlie’s grandpa as well as the most recognizable voices from stage and screen as well as Scottish actor Ian Bannen who was nominated for an Oscar before Sean Connery. And last but not least, is June Allyson whose career in Hollywood was of the girl next door but in later years was the spokeswoman for Depends. So for your reading pleasure, here are 10 more Oscar less actors and actresses I’ve listed in this installment.\n\n171. Frank Morgan\n\nPersonal Life: (1890-1949) Born Francis Phillip Wuppermann in New York City. Father was a Venezuelan born German immigrant of Spanish and German descent. Youngest of 11 children.

Seriously, his role as the Mexican guy with the dogs is the only reason why that movie is still watchable. Not to mention, he had a Hispanic grandmother. Still, he should’ve at least lost to Walter Huston or Henry Travers since people still watch Yankee Doodle Dandy and Mrs. Miniver.\n\nReasons: He was more likely burned by the competition than anything. Also, possibly being Latino on his paternal grandmother’s side (the first Hispanic to win an acting Oscar was Anthony Quinn in 1952 for Viva Zapata!).\n\nTrivia: Starred in a play written by his brother who died in 1919 during his duty in the Army of Occupation.\n\n172. Conrad Veidt\n\nPersonal Life: (1893-1943) Born Hans Walter Conrad Veidt in Berlin. Conscripted and rose to a non-commissioned officer in WWI on the Eastern Front in 1915.

Was discharged in 1917 after being deemed unfit for service. Made his first movie in 1917. Married 3 times and had a daughter with second wife Felicitas Radke. Left Germany for Britain in 1933 during the rise of Nazism due to his third wife being Jewish. Became a British citizen in 1938 but moved to the US in 1941.

Veidt was a German actor whose most memorable work up to Casablanca was in German Expressionist silent films. And most of these were horror movies.\n\nTrivia: Vehemently opposed the Nazi regime and fled Germany to Britain because his third wife was Jewish. Donated much of his fortune to assist the British war effort during WWII as well as his life savings before he left for the US. Loved animals, fast cars, gardening, and pastries. Face from The Man Who Laughs was an inspiration for the Joker from Batman and his character on The Thief of Baghdad for Jafar in Disney’s Aladdin. Starred in the first pro-gay rights film.\n\n173. Mae West\n\nPersonal Life: (1893-1980) Born Mary Jane West in Brooklyn, New York City. Father was a prizefighter known as “Battlin’ Jack West” who later worked as a “special policeman”, and later had his own private investigations agency. Mother was a corset and fashion model who was supportive of her career unlike some of her family members for obvious reasons. Got her start in amateur shows at 7 and won prizes in local talent contests. Began performing professionally for the Hal Clarendon Stock Company in 1907 at 14. Debuted on Broadway in 1911. Made her first film in 1932. Married to Frank Szatkus for 31 years but it’s doubtful whether they even living together as husband and wife before their divorce (yet she had many boyfriends). Died from a couple strokes and a bout of pneumonia at 87.\n\nFamous for: American actress, singer, playwright, and screenwriter whose entertainment career spanned 7 decades. Master of bawdy double entendres.

Second, she encountered a lot of problems in her day like censorship and her glory days in Hollywood were over by then (and she was also banned from NBC radio for her Adam and Eve sketch with Don Ameche, which was deemed “vulgar and indecent” by the FCC. Oh, and she served 8 days in prison for “corrupting the morals of youth” over her play Sex). Not to mention, her personal life was basically tabloid fodder throughout her life, even as a senior citizen. In short, she was basically a combination of Bette Midler and Madonna of her day.\n\nTrivia: Early supporter of gay rights and feminism (though never said she was a feminist). Recorded 3 rock albums in the late 1960s. Wrote plays under the pen name Jane Mast. Performed “Baby It’s Cold Outside” with Rock Hudson at the 1958 Academy Awards telecast. When approached for permission to allow her likeness on the Beatles’ Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover, she initially refused, asking “What would I be doing in a Lonely Heart’s Club”. The Beatles wrote her a personal letter declaring themselves great admirers of the star and persuaded her to change her mind. Also has her name linked to vocabulary: WWII Allied aircrews called their yellow inflatable, vest-like life jackets “Mae Wests” partly from rhyming slang for “breasts” and “life vest” and partly because of the resemblance to her torso. A “Mae West” is also a type of round parachute malfunction (partial inversion) which contorts the shape of the canopy into the appearance of an extraordinarily large brassiere. Also, graph depicting the probability of uranium or other fissionable materials producing specific fission products has two peaks with a “valley” in the middle, and is known as the Mae West curve.\n\n174.

Sending William Holden back just makes you hate him.\n\nReasons: Well, Hawkins is far more famous in Britain as well as made most of his films there. Also, he was starting to lose his voice by The Bridge on the River Kwai due to smoking too many cigarettes (and never quitting).\n\nTrivia: Despite his conservative screen image, was a political liberal. Was friends with Sir Alec Guinness. Appeared in 3 Best Picture winners.\n\n175. Jill Clayburgh\n\nPersonal Life: (1944-2010) Born in New York City.

Sure Fonda’s a decent actress but Coming Home seems like obvious Oscar bait, you know love triangle between Vietnam vets, one of whom is paralyzed. She should’ve at least lost to Geraldine Page.\n\nReasons: For one, she was burned by the competition. Second, she didn’t have the name recognition her fellow nominees had.\n\nTrivia: Romantically linked to Al Pacino. Grandmother was an opera singer. Won the Best Actress Award at the 1978 Cannes Film Festival. Starred in Dirty Sexy Money for 2 years.\n\n176. Ian Bannen\n\nPersonal Life: (1928-1999) Born in Airdrie, Lanarkshire in Scotland.

Was confined to a heavy steel brace as well as wheelchairs, braces, and crutches. Yet, she regained her health and enrolled in dancing school and competitions under “Elaine Peters” despite being told by doctors that she’d never walk again. After her stepfather’s death, she dropped out of high school at 16 even though she initially wanted to be a doctor and thought acting would pay the bills for medical school.

Second, Louis B. Mayer tried to ship her with Van Johnson but ended up marrying Dick Powell to his consternation (but at least he was happy she wanted him to give her away). Third, after Powell’s death she was involved in a bitter custody battle with her mother because she named her boyfriend at the time as her children’s legal guardian.\n\nTrivia: Established the June Allyson Foundation for Public Awareness and Medical Research and worked to raise money for research for urological and gynecological diseases affecting senior citizens.

What’s even more crushing is that this was probably his best film in which he’s portrayed as a three dimensional character and there aren’t a lot of people in the US who know it exists save maybe TCM fans.\n\nReasons: He was an Indian actor who was raised Muslim. Also was subject to a paternity suit and his career declined after WWII that he had to appear in a circus elephant act at one point. Not to mention, he was often typecast into stereotypical roles and had limited opportunity in Hollywood and British films, especially during the Hays Code. He should’ve went back to India for at least he’d get steady work in Bollywood. But he’d left that country far behind him by then.\n\nTrivia: Awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his valor and bravery during WWII. Son was a 1980s rock musician. Co-owned a furniture store with his brother.\n\n179. David Kelly\n\nPersonal Life: (1929-2012) Born in Dublin, Ireland.

Notable roles are O’Brien from Young Cassidy, Garrett Deasy from Ulysses, Vicar from The Italian Job, Grandfather Reilly from Into the West, Michael O’Sullivan from Waking Ned Devine, Fergus Wilks from Greenfingers, and Grandpa Joe from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\n\nNominated for: Kelly was never nominated for an Oscar.\n\nMost Crushing Loss: Not being nominated for Best Supporting Actor in 2000 for Greenfingers.\n\nReasons: Kelly was primarily an Irish actor who mostly appeared in British and Irish media.\n\nTrivia: Was trained in drafting, calligraphy, and watercolor.\n\n180. Paul Robeson\n\nPersonal Life: (1898-1976) Born in Princeton, New Jersey. Father was a Presbyterian minister, yet was forced to resign his church position in 1901 after a disagreement with white backers that contained apparent racial undertones and was stuck doing menial jobs until he found another church to work at in 1910. Mother was nearly blind and died in a house fire when he was 6. Worked a summer job as a waiter in Rhode Island after graduation. Attended Rutgers on a full scholarship and went on to Columbia Law School. Supported himself as a professional football player, coach, and singer. Tried to practice law but racism prevented that. Made his theatrical debut in the 1920s and his film debut in 1924. Married to Eslanda Goode for 44 years and had a son. Retired due to health problems in 1963. Died of stroke complications in Philadelphia at 77.\n\nFamous for: American actor and singer and one of the most influential black pioneers of music and cinema. Notable roles are Reverend Isaiah T. Jenkins / His brother Sylvester from Body and Soul, John Zinga from Song of Freedom, Joe from Showboat, King Umpoba from King Solomon’s Mines, David Goliath from The Proud Valley, and Luke from Tales of Manhattan.\n\nNominated for: Robeson was never nominated for an Oscar.\n\nMost Crushing Loss: Not receiving an honorary Oscar for his achievements in film as well as being a pioneer for African Americans in cinema.\n\nReasons: Other than being black and having limited acting opportunities in Hollywood in general, Robeson was a civil rights activist who was an advocate for anti-imperialism, as well affiliated with Communism and a bit too friendly with the Soviets. This led to him being investigated by the FBI during the Red Scare and because he didn’t recant his income and passport were taken away from him. He was also blacklisted for 3 years. And while it was restored in 1958, his health would later break down that he had to retire in 1963 and spend the rest of his life in seclusion.\n\nTrivia: Was an outstanding football player at Rutgers being an All-American. Also graduated from Rutgers as valedictorian. Would take over for his father during sermons when he was called away as a teenager. Befriended Fritz Pollard who was the first African American NFL football coach. Had an affair with Peggy Ashcroft during his time on Othello on Broadway. Involved in the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century to the early 1960s, most movies were made in black and white which has led many to think that the filmmakers didn’t have the technology to make color movies. However, this is a myth since there were quite a few movies made in color but the process was expensive and time consuming that most filmmakers just didn’t bother. And sometimes the colorization was just partial and didn’t look realistic in any way (though as long as the colorization is consistent with artistic vision, I’m not against this). However, such myths gave rise to the idea of colorization of classic black and white films in the 1980s and early 1990s courtesy of Ted Turner, which many people thought would introduce old movies to a new audience. Yet, to me and a lot of detractors, it’s just wrong. Seriously, even if making a film in color back in the day wouldn’t make sense in the finance scheme as well as be quite exhausting, if the filmmakers wanted their black and white films made in color, they would’ve done it. To colorize Casablanca would be just a travesty as doing the same to Schindler’s List for God’s sake. And if you want to know why colorization is a bad idea, here’s something by Roger Ebert http://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/casablanca-gets-colorized-but-dont-play-it-again-ted. In this selection, I bring you 10 more legends from those past Hollywood days when black and white movies were mostly produced. First, we have Austrian actress Romy Schneider best known for her European films and the Sissi Trilogy. Second, there are African American performers Juanita Moore who was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for Imitation of Life and Canada Lee who should’ve had his big break as a leading man in Cry, the Beloved Country, but was blacklisted instead. After them, is Chinese American actress Anna May Wong who was a celebrated actress and fashion icon, but because of certain rules in the Hays Code (or racism), wasn’t allowed to play the part of O-Lan from The Good Earth because the guy cast as her husband was white and a European actress was cast in the role instead. Then, you have Telly Savalas best known for his bald head and Kojak as well as Italian actor Vincent Gardenia who’s best remembered as Archie Bunker’s neighbor Frank Lorenzo. Next, comes Mexican actress Katy Juardo who’s known for appearing in westerns as well as was married for a time to Ernest Borgnine followed by Italian Pier Angeli who was better known for her relationships with James Dean and Vic Damone. After them, there’s Greek actress Irene Papas who appeared in 70 films for over 50 years but she was an unconventional beauty with a thick accent. And finally, there’s British 1960s sensation Sir Alan Bates. So without further adieu, here are 10 more actors and actresses who never got to make their Oscar speech during their careers.\n\n161. Romy Schneider\n\nPersonal Life: (1938-1982) Born Rosemarie Magdalena Albach in Nazi-era Vienna, Austria. Parents divorced in 1945 and mother remarried a restauranteur who might’ve had an unhealthy interest in her. Made her first film at 15. Was engaged to Alain Delon. Married twice and had 2 children. Son from first marriage died in an accident in attempting to climb a spiked fence at his stepfather’s home puncturing his femoral artery in the process at 14. Drank excessively after that (though may not have around the time of her death). Was found dead in her Paris apartment at 43 (officially ruled as a cardiac arrest).\n\nFamous for: Austrian-German and French actress who made successful and critically acclaimed films of the 1950s and 1960s. Notable roles are Princess/Queen Victoria from Victoria in Dover, Niddy Hoevelmann from The Last Man, Sissi/Empress Elizabeth of Austria from the Sissi Trilogy and Ludwig, Anne-Claire Jouvain from Love from Paris, Nicole from Eva, Christine Weiring from Christine, Katia from Magnificent Sinner, Leni from The Trial, Regine from The Victors, Carole Werner from What’s New Pussycat?, Francesca Anderson from My Lover My Son, Gita Samuels from The Assassination of Trotsky, Anna Kupfer from Le Train, Helene from Mado, Marie from A Simple Story, Hélène Martin from Bloodline, Katherine Mortenhoe from Death Watch, and Emma Eckhert from La Banquière.\n\nNominated for: Schneider was never nominated for an Oscar.\n\nMost Crushing Loss: Not being nominated for Best Actress in 1963 for The Cardinal.\n\nReasons: Schneider was a European actress much more iconic in France and Austria than Hollywood.\n\nTrivia: The Prix Romy Schneider; this prize—the most prestigious award for promising actresses in the French film industry—is awarded by a jury each year in Paris was named after her. Austrian newspaper has a TV award named after her, too.\n\n162. Juanita Moore\n\nPersonal Life: (1914-2014) Born in Greenwood, Mississippi and raised in Los Angeles. Was a chorus girl at the Cotton Club while working in theater. Married for 50 years to Charles Burris and had at least one daughter. Retired in 2001. Died of natural causes at 99.\n\nFamous for: American actress whose career spanned 59 years. Fifth African American to be nominated for an Academy Award in any category, and the third in the Supporting Actress category at a time when only a single African American had won an Oscar. Started out as an extra and played bit parts before her first big break in the 1940s. Notable roles are Nurse from Pinky, Nightclub Patron / Churchgoer from Cabin in the Sky, Dominique from Affair in Trinidad, Hilda from The Girl Can’t Help It, Lacy – Backstage Maid from The Helen Morgan Story, Annie Johnson from Imitation of Life, Julius’ Mother from A Child Is Waiting, Nurse from Rosie!, Viney from Skin Game, Hattie Fox from Fox Style, and Kenny’s Grandmother from The Kid.\n\nNominated for: Moore was nominated for Best Supporting Actress in 1959 for Imitation of Life.\n\nMost Crushing Loss: Losing to Shelley Winters in 1959. Sure Winters was in The Diary of Anne Frank and isn’t either abused or abusive in any way. Yet, what’s more crushing is that Moore loss might’ve had nothing to do with her talents. In fact, she might’ve received the lowest vote count.\n\nReasons: If you were an African American actress in the 1950s, even if you were nominated for an Oscar, the chances of winning were slim (since it was during Jim Crow and segregation so it’s racism, folks). Also was confined to few roles due to the Hays Code and racism in general.\n\nTrivia: Co-founded a theater troupe now headed by her grandson.\n\n163. Anna May Wong\n\nPersonal Life: (1905-1961) Born Wong Liu Tsong in Los Angeles to second-generation Cantonese American parents. Worked at Ville de Paris department store. Made her first film at 16 and dropped out of high school (to the chagrin of her parents but they later came to accept her career in show business since her father wrote an article expressing pride in his famous daughter in the 1930s). Suffered bouts of depression and sudden anger as well as practiced excessive smoking and drinking. Had relationships with Caucasian men since Chinese looked down actresses as prostitutes. Mother died in a car accident in 1931. Suffered an internal hemorrhage in 1953. Died of a heart attack at 56.\n\nFamous for: American actress who became the first Chinese American movie star and the first Asian American to gain international recognition. Long and varied career spanned both silent and sound film (in the US and Europe), stage, radio, and television. Notable roles are Lotus Blossom from The Toll of the Sea, Mongol Slave from The Thief of Baghdad, Shosho from Piccadilly, Princess Ling Moy from Daughter of the Dragon, Hui Fei from Shanghai Express, Lan Ying from Dangerous to Know, Kwan Mei from Lady of Chungking, Su Lin from Impact, and Tawny from Portrait in Black.\n\nNominated for: Wong was never nominated for an Oscar.\n\nMost Crushing Loss: Other than not being nominated for Best Supporting Actress in 1932 for Shanghai Express (since the award didn’t exist), I would say her most crushing loss wasn’t receiving an honorary Oscar from the Academy for being one of the first Asian American stars in Hollywood.\n\nReasons: For one, Wong was Asian, which basically limited her range of roles she could play like supporting roles as demure butterflies or stereotypical dragon ladies, which caused her a lot of frustration that she fled to Europe for a time. State anti-miscegenation laws (i.e. racism) prevented her from playing leads and she was usually passed over in favor of a white actress (even if the character was Asian). One notorious example of this was when MGM refused to consider her for the part of O-Lan for The Good Earth which went to German actress Luise Rainer. All because the main male character was played by Paul Muni and that the Hays Code had a rules against miscegenation, making this one of the most notorious casting disputes in movie history. Also, was less well received in China after Shanghai Express that they were also against her getting the part of O-Lan as well. And when she did portray Chinese characters in a positive light, they were for B-movies. Not to mention, many people thought at the time that it was impossible to be Chinese and American (even though she was a native born US citizen). Also, she died too early to receive an honorary Oscar.\n\nTrivia: Real name means “yellow snow frost.” Friends with Marlene Dietrich and Leni Riefenstahl. Received an honorary doctorate from Peking University in 1932. Supported China during the Second Sino-Japanese War and made a series of anti-Japanese propaganda films during WWII. Starred in The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong in 1951-1952 under her real name which was the first US TV show to have an Asian lead. Was an outspoken activist in Chinese American causes and better film roles. Went on a tour of China for a year during the 1930s and chronicled her experiences in the New York Herald Tribune. Fluent in German and French. Wrote a cookbook called New Chinese Recipes in 1942. Converted her Santa Monica Home to “Moongate Apartments.” Hosted on of the first documentaries on China narrated by a Chinese American. Starred in one of the first color features.\n\n164. Telly Savalas\n\nPersonal Life: (1922-1994) Born in Garden City, New York to Greek immigrants. Father was a Greek restaurant owner while mother was an artist. Spoke only Greek before he entered grade school. Worked as a lifeguard until he unsuccessfully tried to save a man from drowning which haunted him for the rest of his life. Graduated from Columbia University in 1948 with a degree in psychology. Served 3 years in the US Army during WWII by working in the State Department and later ABC News. Began his acting career in 1950 and started in radio and television. Married 3 times and had 6 children. Died of bladder and prostate cancer at 72.\n\nFamous for: American actor and singer whose career spanned 4 decades. Notable roles are\n\nDetective Lt.

Guffy from Battle of the Bulge, Sgt. Maj. Dagineau from Beau Geste, Archer Maggott from The Dirty Dozen, MSgt. Big Joe from Kelly’s Heroes, Captain Sam Surcher from Pretty Maids All in a Row, Pancho Villa, and El Sleezo Tough from The Muppet Movie.\n\nNominated for: Savalas was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in 1962 for Birdman of Alcatraz.\n\nMost Crushing Loss: Not receiving an honorary Oscar for his career because he didn’t live long enough.\n\nReasons: Well, when it comes to the 1962 Oscars, Savalas was just burned by the competition. Not to mention, he spent a lot of his career being typecast as villains and that he spent a lot of his later years playing Kojak.\n\nTrivia: Was Jenifer Aniston’s godfather. Played Kojak. Had some chart success as a singer. Brother recorded a series of Greek folk songs and appeared as a detective on Kojak.\n\n165. Katy Jurado\n\nPersonal Life: (1924-2002) Born María Cristina Estela Marcela Jurado García in Guadalajara, Mexico. Parents and relatives were impoverished aristocrats who lost their wealth during the Mexican Revolution. Father was cattle baron and orange farmer while mother was an opera singer. Was discovered by director Emilio Fernández at 16 and pursued an acting career in spite of family wishes and married her first husband Víctor Velázquez to slip from her family’s control (she’d have 2 children with him. Made her first film in 1943. Worked as a movie columnist, radio reporter and bullfight critic to support her family and was spotted at a bullfight by John Wayne and came to Hollywood in 1951.

Her performance makes you wish that Gary Cooper never married Grace Kelly in that movie.\n\nReasons: Jurado was a Latina who was typecast to play ethnic roles in American films, sometimes stereotypically. She had a more diverse career in Mexico but Americans don’t watch Mexican movies (at least in the Northeast).\n\nTrivia: First Latin American actress nominated for an Oscar and win a Golden Globe. Family once owned much of the land that would become the state of Texas. Cousin of Mexican President Emilio Portes Gil. Romantically linked to John Wayne, Tyrone Power, Louis L’Amour, and Marlon Brando.

Krim from Heaven Can Wait, Mr. Mushnik from Little Shop of Horrors, and Cosmo Castorini from Moonstruck.\n\nNominated for: Gardenia was nominated twice for Best Supporting Actor in 1973 for Bang the Drum Slowly and 1987 for Moonstruck.\n\nMost Crushing Loss: Losing to Sean Connery for Best Supporting Actor in 1987. I mean Connery is a decent actor but his performance as Jim Malone from The Untouchables was far from his best (since he didn’t play a convincing Irishman). Gardenia should’ve at least lost to Albert Brooks or Denzel Washington.\n\nReasons: Probably due to that he was better known for his theatrical and TV career than his films.\n\nTrivia: Played Frank Lorenzo in All in the Family. Life member of The Actors Studio. Won a Tony in 1972.\n\n167. Pier Angeli\n\nPersonal Life: (1932-1971) Born Anna Maria Pierangeli in Cagliari, Sardinia in Italy. Made her first film in 1950 and moved to Hollywood a year later under MGM. Married twice with her first husband being Vic Damone and had a son to each husband.

Her sister was though but she’s not as famous.\n\nMost Crushing Loss: Not being nominated for Best Actress in 1951 for Teresa. Granted, she was young at the time but still. I mean she won a Golden Globe for it.\n\nReasons: Angeli was usually cast as a love interest to many of America’s emerging leading men of the time in the 1950s. Also she had a highly publicized custody battle over her son with Vic Damone during their divorce. Not to mention, she’s best known for dating James Dean and being Vic Damone’s wife. Then there’s the fact she died young.\n\nTrivia: Twin sister of Marisa Pavan. Romantically linked to Kirk Douglas and James Dean. Was chosen to play in The Godfather but died before filming began.\n\n168. Irene Papas\n\nPersonal Life: (1926-present) Born Irini Lelekou in Chiliomodi, Corinth in Greece.

There’s still time to award her an honorary Oscar for her career so get to it, Academy.\n\nReasons: Despite her accolades, but as Roger Ebert said, “Her height rules out many leading men, her accent rules out many roles, and her unusual beauty is not the sort that superstar actresses like to compete with.” Perhaps this is why she’s not as familiar to us as she should be. That, or it’s just that the Academy just didn’t seem to recognize her talents or she tended to get overshadowed by leading men.\n\nTrivia: Serves on the board of directors of the Anna-Marie Foundation. Released 3 albums. Romantically linked to Marlon Brando.\n\n169. Sir Alan Bates\n\nPersonal Life: (1934-2003) Born in Derby, England.

One of his boyfriends was Olympic skater John Curry who died in his arms from AIDS in 1994. Yet, he also had couple of girlfriends in his later years.\n\nTrivia: Attended RADA with Albert Finney and Peter O’Toole. Set up a theater in memory of his son who died at 19.
