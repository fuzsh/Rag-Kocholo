        "text": "Almost a century ago, the silent screen’s most mythical ‘cinema artist,’ as he considered himself, began his Hollywood career when he wrote, directed, and starred in “Blind Husbands” (1919), the first of a dozen features he made as a film director. We’re talking about the legendary Erich von Stroheim, infamous for his numerous conflicts with producers and studio executives during the silent era. He was one of cinema’s most talented, distinguished, but also most uncompromising filmmakers who eventually turned his triumph into failure.\n\nSince then, several books have been written, and documentaries were made to unravel the von Stroheim persona. Considered to be a perfectionist, complicated and demanding on the set of his films, the screen legend (b. 1885 in Vienna, d. 1957 in Paris) who started his Hollywood career in 1914 as a bit player for D.W. Griffith, often cast as a monocled German villain, was too self-destructive by working against the studios instead of working with them. After his career, as a Hollywood filmmaker, had come to an end in 1929, he returned to acting and eventually left the U.S. by 1936 to live, act and write in self-imposed exile in France. Yet, ‘The Man You Loved to Hate,’ a nickname he earned and which referred to the numerous villains he played on the screen, was described by veteran screenwriter Anita Loos as ‘one of the few legitimate geniuses of the early silent days.’\n\nAfter “Blind Husbands,” Stroheim made “Foolish Wives” (1922), at the time the most expensive film ever made, and billed by Universal as ‘the first million-dollar movie’ because of the elaborate Monte Carlo Café de Paris set built on the studio lot. Stroheim then decided to make his dream project, the highly publicized and endlessly recut “Greed” (1924, the original print ran over ten hours). His attention to detail and his sense of drama were simply exquisite but way too expensive and impossible to show on the screen. After “The Merry Widow” (1925), which he despised but turned out to become his most commercially successful film, Stroheim finally made “The Wedding March” (1928) and “Queen Kelly” (1929, starring Gloria Swanson). This film failed to get any commercial showings in the U.S.\n\nAs an actor, however, he is best remembered for his role of Captain von Rauffenstein in Jean Renoir’s “La grande illusion” (1937, a.k.a. “The Grand Illusion”) and—after a short return to Hollywood—for his supporting role in Billy Wilder’s “Sunset Boulevard” (1950), playing a faded and failed silent film director-turned-servant to Gloria Swanson’s character of Norma Desmond, a role which earned him his only Academy Award nomination (as Best Supporting Actor).\n\nErich von Stroheim was married three times; his second marriage to Mary Agnes Jones from 1916-1919 produced his first son, Erich von Stroheim, Jr. In 1920, he married his third wife, actress Valerie Germonprez (1897-1988). They separated in 1936 when he moved to France, but they never divorced. Their union produced his second son, Josef von Stroheim (b. 1922 as Josef Erich von Stroheim), who later became a renowned sound editor (he was also credited as Joseph, Joseph E., and Joe von Stroheim).\n\nAlmost two decades ago, I was able to locate Josef von Stroheim by accident, really, when I was doing research for a visit to Los Angeles in April 1999, hoping to do interviews there with screen veterans. After I got hold of his address, I wrote him a letter. He responded almost right away, telling me he would be happy to talk to me about his father and about his own career as a sound editor in films and television—he was a two-time Emmy winner for Outstanding Achievement in Film Sound Editing on the TV series “The Immortal” (1969) and “QB VII” (1974).\n\nAfter I arrived in Hollywood, I called him, we arranged an appointment straight away, and he suggested to pick me up at my hotel near Hollywood and Vine (a cheap hotel close to the Capitol Records building, as I was traveling on a tight budget), and from there we’d drive up to his house in the Valley to have lunch together. “You can easily recognize me, I drive a black Lexus, and my license plate begins with my initials JVS,” he told on the phone, jokingly.\n\nWith my cassette recorder, an old Pentax camera, and a huge box of the most delicious Belgian chocolates as a present, we entered his nicely decorated living room with beautiful pictures of his family, his awards, and on the wall a few precious reminders of the genius his father really was.\n\n‘Did you ever see Kevin Brownlow’s TV series of the Hollywood silent era?’ he asked. ‘He did the interview with my mother right here in the living room.’ I had seen Brownlow’s 13-part documentary series “Hollywood: The Pioneers” (1980), and his mother Valerie Germonprez told in her interview, “One of the girls said to me one day, ‘Does he [Erich von Stroheim] drag you around the house by your hair every morning before he goes to work?’ And of course, I thought that was absolutely ridiculous because he was a very kind person.” Rumor had it that he really was the villain he had played so very often on the screen.\n\nWhen I visited his son, Mr. Josef von Stroheim, a grey-haired and soft-spoken gentleman, at his Valley Village home, he offered me a drink, we sat down, and we were set. He was a most generous, upbeat host, the kindest man you could ever imagine. A joy to talk to this truly wonderful man with a great sense of humor.\n\nMr. von Stroheim, the most logical question to begin with, how do you remember your father?\n\nPeople always ask me, ‘Wasn’t your father very stern?’ And then I always have to say, ‘No, not at all, he was a pussycat!’ And that’s what he was really like. He only pretended to be very difficult to handle. If you look at photographs of him from those days or watch his movies and the type of characters he played most of the time, that was only his screen image. That was not at all the man I knew when I grew up. In real life, he was completely the opposite. He was a great father, and I have very fond memories of my childhood when we lived in Brentwood. He always called me Poopsie. Hey Poopsie, let’s go hunting! he would say [laughs].\n\nDid you often visit him on the set when he was making movies?\n\nYes, and we knew what kind of work he did, but we also had a protected childhood. We weren’t exposed too much; looking back, I think that was a very wise decision. But being his son also had its advantages. In 1930 we went to Europe; first we visited Rome, where we had a private audience with Pope Pius XI. I was only eight years old, so you can imagine how special that was. In Vienna, we visited my grandmother, who was still living there.\n\nHow about your career? When and how did you enter the motion picture industry?\n\nI started at MGM as a messenger boy and a still photographer in 1939 at age seventeen, photographing the stars. Clark Gable often drove me to the studios. But then I went to Paris with my parents for a year. I saw my father working in France; I also got to meet Jean Renoir. But when the War began, I returned to Los Angeles and stayed here with my uncle and grandmother. My mother also came back over here, then my father too, and he made “I Was An Adventuress” [1940] and a few other pictures. After Pearl Harbor, I joined the Army as a combat photographer and went to England, France, Belgium, Holland, Germany, and I met the Russians at the Elbe River. Later I also went to the South Pacific.\n\nOnce the War was over, were you able to return to MGM?\n\nYes, I went back to MGM; they had to take me back for a year. But when this year was over, they let me go because they weren’t making too many pictures, and so I got in the construction business. I built fifty-two homes in and around Los Angeles as the superintendent of construction with this big construction company. Then television came in, and I got in the film department at ABC, where I started in the old Warner studio at the corner of Prospect Avenue and Talmadge Street where they did “The Jazz Singer” [1927], they were on the same lot. We opened up the film department for Channel 7 and worked there for a while until I got called in for the Army again for one year; they were going to send me over to Korea. Luckily I knew somebody, and they got me into the Army Pictorial Center in Astoria, Long Island. There I cut three pictures, and when General [Douglas] MacArthur gave a speech in Seoul, Korea, I had to put it together because the sound and the picture weren’t shot in synch. So I had to synch up the track, I had to have the track transferred to film, and then I had to adjust the track to match the picture.\n\nThis was your introduction to sound editing?\n\nYes. After I came back to Hollywood, a friend of mine bought the rights of the picture “I Bombed Pearl Harbor,” the Japanese version of the Pearl Harbor story. There was music, dialogue, and effects, all on one track. He couldn’t use the music or the dialogue, we had to dub all the dialogue, so I had to cut brand-new sound effects for everything, and then they had to put new music to it. We had to dub that together, and then it was released here.\n\nWhat was sound editing like in those days?\n\nBeing a supervising sound editor used to be very hard because you had to cut everything by hand. Now it’s all computerized, now you push a button, and you get all the gunshots you want. That’s why I’m wearing two hearing aids now: we used to wear earphones, but the gunshots destroyed my hearing. Each footstep used to be cut in by hand, each gunshot, the cowboy yells, all the different sound effects. I had over a million feet of sound effects—just sound effects. I had them in my mother’s garage, and if I needed something, I’d go up the garage, get it, bring it in, transfer it and take it back. I had a master library of practically every sound known to man. What we didn’t have, we’d make. After I retired in the late 1980s, I donated it to the AFI. They came with three truckloads. I don’t know what they did with it, since they use computers now. A friend of mine just passed away, and his daughter asked me, ‘What do I do with his sound effects library?’ I said, ‘Dump it, throw it all away; nobody needs it anymore.’ They got all the sound effects they’ll ever need, and what they don’t have, they’ll make electronically or with special effects, changing the frequencies, stretching out our effects, equalizing the sound, playing it forward, backwards and sideways [laughs], it’s really amazing what they can do now by pushing a button. But back then, it could be very tedious work, you worked on into the night, and pretty soon, your eyeballs were hanging out like two cucumbers. I remember for “A Star Is Born” [1976], we went to Barbra Streisand’s place, got there at eight o’clock in the morning, and often worked until three or four o’clock the next morning. Very hard work. I’m not educated on the electronic end of it at all, so I don’t know if it’s harder now or not, but this is how it was done.\n\nYour brother Erich von Stroheim, Jr. [1916-1968] had a very different career in films, didn’t he?\n\nHe was also a child actor—he appeared as a baby in Chaplin’s “Easy Street” [1917]. He worked with Fox at the make-up department for a while before he went into production and then became a successful assistant director who worked with Nicholas Ray, Otto Preminger, and Vincente Minnelli. Unfortunately, he passed away many years ago [cancer].\n\nWhat does your life look like now?\n\nI’m 76 now, and as you can see, I’m enjoying life. I have a great family, and we travel from time to time. You know, in 1993, I donated most of my father’s archive to the Margaret Herrick Library at the Academy of Motion Pictures, Arts and Sciences: many of his letters, personal correspondence, black and white stills, his screenplays, it’s all out there now for anyone who wishes to look into it. But I kept quite a bit of memorabilia for myself because whatever he left me is very dear to me. Come on, let’s go to his room. I’ll show you.\n\nValley Village, California\n\nApril 7, 1999\n\n+ Mr. von Stroheim passed away at the Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys, California, on March 22, 2002, at age 79, of complications from lung cancer.\n\nFILMS\n\nINVASION OF THE SAUCER MEN (1957) DIR Edward L.
