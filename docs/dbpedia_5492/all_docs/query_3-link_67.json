        "text": "Larry and Joan were separated during the last years of his life, the marriage was kept in name for the sake of appearance, she would show up with him only in social events but other than that he was left alone/abandoned with nurses . Larry is quoted by some of his friends saying \" Joan expected me to die at seventy\"\n\nJoan is delighted to spread around some unfavorable things about Larry in at least 2 biographies, she approved and gave interviews for 2 biography books about Larry in which she seems intent on putting him in negative light.\n\nPlowright wasn't well-regarded by the Vivien Leigh/Binkie Beaumont/Old Queen Set.\n\nThey said she was 'a port in a storm' for Larry after all the frightful drama with psychopathic Vivien.\n\nThey said she was common. They said she was 'crumpet'. She was even worse than the alleged liaisons Larry had with Dorothy Tutin and Janette Scott.\n\nThey said she was a frump. They said she satisfactory at the time when everyone was determined to be as self-hateful as possible saying England was doomed and we must celebrate The Kitchen Sink.\n\nOlivier apparently wanted to divorce Joan :\n\n\"Olivier had begun an on-and-off affair with Sarah Miles, whom he had met during the filming of Term of Trial 'in late 1961 and early 1962. The first ten weeks of shooting were in studios near Dublin, and then there were two weeks in Paris, during which Olivier asked her, \"Will you lay with me?\" She would. She was eighteen. Later they used to meet in a studio apartment he had taken near the Old Vic. which she recalled as a grim pad with no hot water. He asked her to call him Lionel Kerr, a variation on the old Andrew Kerr he had used with Vivien. He said the Lionel was for Lionheart.\n\n\"Sarah said that Olivier told her he had been bisexual. But she says he might easily have done that to \"turn her on,\" knowing that she had herself been bisexual as a girl\"\n\nMiles proved to be one of the most serious of his casual affairs. According to Derek Granger he at one point even went so far as to consult his agent, Laurence Evans, about the possibility of securing a divorce so as to marry Miles. It does not seem likely that he did more than play with the idea and when Evans pointed out that it would seriously damage if not destroy his career, he quickly dropped it.\n\nSarah Miles was in the National Theatre company in 1963 but left suddenly in March 1965 after Noel Coward breezed into Olivier's dressing room one day while they were engaged in a rather 'indelicate' situation. Miss Miles said that Mr Coward refused to speak or have anything to do with her after that\n\n\"According to Sarah Miles he was at his most vulnerable emotionally and claimed he was anxious to divorce Joan Plowright and marry her ” He told Miles’s parents that there was nothing he wanted more than to marry their daughter but that his wife had made him realize that “the scandal would be too much for the children to bear”. Miles was hurt that her lover had elected to make this revelation to her parents rather than to her, but the affair flickered on...\"\n\nTarquin olivier interview :\n\n\"At this point I gingerly bring up the subject of the actress Sarah Miles, who, in three autobiographies, details her affair with Olivier, which she said spanned decades and took place during his marriage to Joan Plowright. According to her, Olivier told her: “Jill Esmond gave me my son Tarquin as well as my first leg up the showbiz ladder. I suppose, unconsciously, I used all my wives to further my journey up the ladder.” Tarquin acknowledges that his father told him about Sarah Miles, but says, unwaveringly: “I don’t want to talk about it. After all, it isn’t a nice thing to talk about somebody who is alleged to have had an affair with my father, because Joan is still alive and very loyal to his memory and I wouldn’t like to be associated with that kind of conversation.”\n\nMy father Laurence Olivier - by Tarquin Olivier 1992\n\n\"Olivier, with typical insensitivity, took his new love, Vivien Leigh, to visit mother and baby in hospital (and later asked Jill Esmond if he could have Tarquin's pram back, for the baby Vivien was briefly, unsuccessfully, expecting). Tarquin's childhood knowledge of his father was therefore confined to occasional weekends, and even more occasional parental visits to school.\n\nMost of Olivier's paternal advice, such as it was, seems to have been about sex - the snares and dangers and delusions thereof: 'Just recognise that all the romantic ecstasies, all the rosie reveries . . . are basically, simply and solely wicked Old Nature's cold-blooded calculated bribe, to bring children into the world.' Not surprisingly, he worried that Tarquin would become gay: he insisted on urinating beside him, presumably to check appearances.\n\nAccording to Tarquin, Olivier also had an obsessive interest in the female genitalia and 'seeing over and over again the designs of nature which were dedicated, among other things, to the enjoyment of men. His enthusiastic exposure to matters which his conscience had denied ever existed replaced his unnatural dread with a healthy deference.'\n\nLater, when Tarquin was 20 and Olivier's marriage to Leigh was breaking down, they went on holiday together (the only time they ever did) and on the way back, Olivier watched a middle-aged woman crossing the road: 'See her?' he exclaimed, 'That woman? She's my age to the very day. Fifty: and who wants her? Where's the sex in her?'\n\nOlivier said in his autobiography that he was always embarrassed by Tarquin and one can appreciate why: his son's adoration must have seemed a constant reproach. Even as an adult, Tarquin burst into tears when he learned that Joan Plowright was expecting a baby which would deprive him of his exclusive filial role, meagre though that had been. Thereafter he saw even less of his father than before, and Olivier even refused to read a travel book he wrote on the grounds that he was 'too busy'.\n\nI don’t want to reinforce the ‘another gay actor’ blurb, but Olivier is now well documented as having gay affairs. He and Leigh would entertain guests in their home which had a pool. People commented that Leigh would get drunk and go to bed and Larry would always end up (somehow) swimming nude in the pool with whatever attractive Male was a guest in the house.\n\nHomosexuality was illegal in Britain until 1967. It would never have been an option for Olivier to be a gay man when young. He was obviously highly sexed and just went with women initially. But as his success grew and he gained private and safe access to men, he would have started Male affairs. Most men would never have been brave enough to go out cruising and would have gone without or gone with women.\n\nJoan Plowright and Richard Burton :\n\n\"In 1983 Joan had another success in the West End, as Madame Ranevskaya in The Cherry Orchard. That same year she met Richard Burton again. Elizabeth Taylor had gone, so had her successor, and he was alone.\n\n\"We had a glass of wine,\" Joan later recalled, \"and after mutual confessions of certain traumatic events in both our lives, he suggested, half-jokingly, that we might set up house together . .. We laughed about what people would say, and I said, also half-jokingly, that for me it would be like jumping out of the frying pan into the fire. Anyway, I told him, I had a commitment for life, however difficult it might be.\"\n\nOlivier' younger son Richard (from Joan Plowright) treated him his father shit as well :\n\n\"Richard then came with his new wife to live at the Malthouse. Joan was often away working. As a teenager, Richard had seen his father only as a frail old man, and his example of strength had been his mother. He remembered endless silent dinner tables. Later, when his father was too frail to decide how to spend his time, he and Joan would decide for him.\n\n\"She would ask my advice, we would consult together at one end of the dining table, while my father became the child, helplessly looking on from the other. I remembered . . . the flashes of bitter resentment that would pass across his face as he struggled even to hear the plans we were making for him. And I remembered [added Richard, with the same instinct for guilt and remorse that had been such a curse to his father] the sadistic pleasure I had felt in not repeating them louder so he could participate, or dare to refuse.\n\n\" I had revelled in the opportunity to punish him, for being away, for being ill whatever it was.\" Tamsin had seen the same thing. \"He admired my mother as an actress and he loved her, but that was very difficult for her. It meant she went to work and couldn't look after him. He was furious with her about that. There was a sense of Mum taking power, and he loathed that. He could be vitriolic, use vile language, and say we were ganging up against him.\"\n\nGod knows what she thought, R71.\n\nblurb for the second part of her memoir:\n\n[quote]While she was at RADA - she made a list of dreams and to her amazement found them coming true. Not only did she become a film star first time around with TERM OF TRIAL, but she was acting opposite the very man she'd adored since her childhood memories of WUTHERING HEIGHTS, Laurence Olivier. During filming in Paris, Sarah finally became Heathcliff's Cathy. But the stress of keeping their relationship a secret finally took its toll, until her agent, frustrated because she was becoming a recluse, took her to a party where she met her knight in shining armor, Robert Bolt.\n\nR84 Which films are you talking about?\n\nSome of the characters he played are 'larger than life' and supposed to 'chew the scenery'. Have you seen 'Carrie' mentioned at R73 and R74? It is a very low-key, poignant American story.\n\nWere you forced to study Shakespeare in school? That's OK. But later on you could try 'Richard III' from 1955 because it's in color and his character is quite entertaining and funny.\n\nI could tell you that he was very beautiful in the 1930s but It sounds like you've made your mind up and you're too masculine to try and open your mind to different experiences.\n\n\"Joan Plowright abandoned him in his time of need, she left him alone with nurses.\"\n\nOh shut up, you stupid twat. What was she supposed to do, spend 24 hours of every day with him? She had a life to lead. I suppose you think she should have single–handedly cared for his every need and never left his bedside for even a moment. No one could do that. He had nurses, but then every person as ill as he was would have to have had nurses. Enough with the stupid hate towards Joan.\n\n\"He was GAY and mostly fucked men. His “relationships” with women were purely for show.\"\n\nYou are insane. Olivier was VERY into women, well into old age. In fact, when he was with Vivien Leigh they were quite demonstrative and people would comment on their \"sexual greediness\" for each other. Here's an example of their lust for each other from a Vivien Leigh biography:\n\nOlivier often took a 15 hour flight just to spend one day with Vivien. Once, due to a delay, he was unable to return on time to the theater for a performance, so Selznick (David) allowed the lovers to meet halfway at the Hotel Meulbach in Kansas City. \"Oh, David, I'm so grateful,\" she said to him on her return. \"Larry met me in the hotel lobby, and we went upstairs and we fucked and we fucked and we fucked the whole weekend.\"\n\nThere was a film clip I saw here on DL. Some kind of home movie with but the color was very good. It featured many actors and there was the briefest scene of him and Vivien in a marvelous close-up and they looked so fucking beautiful. I mean just stunning. It was young times, a time they had the world by the tit (I always remember that line from \"Frances\"). That is the way I like to think of them.\n\nI fervently adore Vivien Leigh. I'm so-so on Olivier but agree with others that he was fabulous in the Sister Carrie movie. I don't know why but I really love that film."
