        "text": "LONDON, Dec. 22—At the last gasp of the old year, the National Theater has redeemed its dismal West End season with‐a superb version of O'Neill's “Long Day's Journey into Night.”\n\nIts obvious main appeal is Laurence Olivier's performance as James Tyrone. But this is not simply a case of a star actor speeding to the rescue of a failing enterprise. The production is by Michael Blakemore, the most devoted and sensitive textual interpreter among Britain's younger directors and what he offers is very much a company work conceived in devotion to a very great play. Its spirit is implicit in Michael Annal's spaciously seedy set, closely resembling the pictures of O'Neill's Connecticut home.\n\nA Big Surprise\n\nMr. Blakemore's hand is apparent in his sense of the play's structure: the underlining of poisonous little details that ache under the surface of the dialogue, and the presentation of character and situation from sharply contrasted angles. Above all, he and his company think in the huge dramatic paragraphs with which O'Neill's text passes again and again over the same material like a spirograph pencil, adding to and enriching a picture whose outline is plain from the start.\n\nIn the company of Olivier, the big surprise is Constance Cummings, who undergoes the transformation from the gentle maternal presence of the opening to the spectral morphine addict of the last act with an authority and spiritual intensity that thoroughly earns the part its central position. But subdued though it is, Olivier's Tyrone is unrivaled in technical and personal fascination—personal because James Tyrone (alias James O'Neill) was an actor with the kind of career that Olivier has spent his life avoiding: a strong young talent destroyed by years of imprisonment in profitable type‐casting.\n\nWe see Tyrone at a stage when he is all too aware of his self‐destruction; and the dejection that settles on Olivier from the beginning—his body hunched in a baggy suit, his mouth cracked into a small mean line so as to create a receding chin—expresses a sense of defeat that goes much beyond family affairs There are touches of the old ham, as when he smugly intones a few of Prospero's lines and turns to his son in naked appeal for applause; and when Olivier, the showman, pulls out a pair of his own incomparable physical tricks with two contrasted descents from a table —swaying vertiginously on his toes, and then slapping hand that offers him assist\n\nWhat marks out his performance from the rest is its breadth: all the components are there all the time —the tightwad, the old pro, the distracted husband, the ragged Irish boy—and there not only in the sense that O'Neill is presenting the character, but that Olivier is exploiting them for the character's advantage.\n\nYou might argue that this is too knowing an interpretation for a man so set in his ways and at the mercy of impulse. But the result is too theatrically electric to be argued with; and in the desolate exhaustion of the last act, Olivier abandons any kind of subterfuge and shows the defenseless face of the man himself.\n\nIn their separate ways, the two brothers are a match for him. Ronald Pickup's Edmund (the author's alias) cuts through the part's narcissism and combines its passionate contact with its half‐detached viewpoint. Denis Quilley's Jamie has a shade too much of the Edwardian bounder, but he finally levels murderously with the father as another sardonic old ham. Both Olivier and Mr. Quilley have played in John Osborne's “The Entertainer,” and momentarily it was like seeing two Archie Rices meeting in hand‐to‐hand combat."
