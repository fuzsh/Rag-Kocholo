        "text": "Nicole Kidman unveiled her Hollywood star in 2003\n\nThe names of actors Sir Laurence Olivier and Sir Alec Guinness are to join those of Ricky Gervais and Ant and Dec in a London Walk of Fame.\n\nOne hundred celebrities will be immortalised on the Avenue of the Stars, to be unveiled on 18 September in Covent Garden.\n\nThe ceremony will form part of an ITV1 tribute presented by Chris Tarrant.\n\nThe first 16 recipients announced also include Sir Alfred Hitchcock, Sir Charlie Chaplin and Nicole Kidman.\n\nThe stars, who can be honoured posthumously, must have been born in the UK or Commonwealth for their names to added.\n\nSTAR NAMES\n\nSir Laurence Olivier\n\nTommy Cooper\n\nThe Rolling Stones\n\nNicole Kidman\n\nBilly Connolly\n\nSir Charlie Chaplin\n\nPeter Sellers\n\nDame Shirley Bassey\n\nAnt and Dec\n\nDame Edna Everage\n\nThe Two Ronnies\n\nRicky Gervais\n\nSir Alfred Hitchcock\n\nSir Alec Guinness\n\nSir Rex Harrison\n\nJohn Cleese\n\nEach will be represented by a silver star, to be placed outside St Paul's, The Actors' Church, in Covent Garden.\n\nMore names will be added to the Avenue every year.\n\nComics Tommy Cooper and Peter Sellers will be joined by John Cleese, Billy Connolly and the Two Ronnies, with Dame Shirley Bassey and the Rolling Stones representing the world of music.\n\nDame Edna Everage, another recipient, said it was \"one of my favourite places in little old London\" and that she hoped to be \"laid between Michael Caine and Sean Connery\".\n\nAn ITV1 spokesman said the living celebrities had been invited to attend the launch, and that some would perform on the live programme.\n\nSir Laurence Olivier is one of the initial 100 star recipients\n\nHe said those who did not appear on 18 September would get a miniature version of their trophy at a later date.\n\nBBC chairman Michael Grade, former ITV director of television David Liddiment, writer Kay Mellor and composer Don Black were members of the panel which decided on the stars to be honoured.\n\nTarrant said: \"It will be intriguing to see who makes the list and who doesn't.\n\n\"With so many names to choose from, there are bound to be some surprising omissions, as well as names that will raise a few eyebrows.\"\n\nThere are currently more than 2,000 names on Hollywood's Walk of Fame.\n\nYour comments:\n\nI doubt Sir Laurence would value his star as highly as his knighthood\n\nMathew Abonyi, London\n\nI think it is a shame that London has to stoop to Hollywood's standards of praise. Surely those who merit recognition should have a nice statue, plaque or gallery named after them? If you homogonise praise, you deprive it of worth. I doubt Sir Laurence would value his star as highly as his knighthood.\n\nMathew Abonyi, London\n\nI'm a little confused, since when was Nicole Kidmans birthplace Honolulu, Hawaii, either part of the UK or Commonwealth? Don't get me wrong she can have the star, but it seems a little in-consistent!\n\nPaul Pritchett-Brown, London\n\nWhat about a stone for one of the greats of the 70's and 80's pop scene, like Freddie from Queen.\n\nPaul, Birmingham\n\nCan anyone explain why there are so few women on this list? I hope they'll add more to the final list of 100.\n\nKatherine, Essex, UK\n\nRicky Gervais is good but surely he hasn't been around long enough to warrant being in a walk of fame just yet. Shouldn't a monument like this being for lifetime achievements? Where's Sir John Mills in this list? If anyone deserved it then surely he does!\n\nJim Netts, Hitchin, Herts\n\nIt seems to me that ratings are getting recognised and not true talent! Where are Ben Kingsley, Tim Roth, Albert Finney and Daniel Day Lewis?\n\nChris Shaw, Gosport, England\n\nIt would have to be Dudley Moore and Peter Cook for me. Absolute classic and a travesty if they do not make it and Ant and Dec do!\n\nJohn, Manchester\n\nHow about putting Sean Connery or John Thaw on there?\n\nClare, Birmingham\n\nHow can they put Dame Edna on the Walk of Fame when they haven't got so many other people who are more deserving? What has she/he done anyway? How about putting Sean Connery or John Thaw on there? I doubt there would be many objections.\n\nClare, Birmingham\n\nI would hope to see Dick Emery, Norman Wisdom, Benny Hill in there as some of our greatest comedians. Also let's not forget Barbara Windsor, Hattie Jacques, Kenneth Williams, for all their 'Carry On'.\n\nWyn Conway, London, London\n\nCharles Laughton and Sir John Mills should definitely make it on the Walk of Fame. And where are all the women - Dame Judi Dench, Dame Maggie Smith, Julie Walters? If Ant & Dec have made the Walk then The Chuckle Brothers should get a star too - ooh and Bobby Davro!\n\nNicola, London, England\n\nWhy no Dame Judi Dench, Julie Andrews, Audrey Hepburn and James Mason or on the other side of the camera Ridley Scott, Sir Richard Attenborough and David Lean?\n\nDom, London, UK\n\nA line-up for the next Parky show?\n\nPhil, London, UK\n\nI'm sure Alfred Hitchcock, Laurence Olivier and Alec Guiness will be spinning in their graves to know they'll be put alongside Ant and Dec, John Cleese and Ricky Gervais. And are you sure this isn't a line-up for the next Parky show?\n\nPhil, London, UK\n\nWill the Walk of Fame grow, like Hollywood B? Missing names: Dirk Bogarde, Richard Attenborough, John Mills, Peter O'Toole, Richard Todd, Richard Harris, Stanley Baker, Jack Hawkins, Patricia Roc.... and so many more! Surely all the above deserve more recognition than Ant & Dec...\n\nMark Smith, Southampton, UK\n\nBill Nighy's name should be there, of course!\n\nAnna, Croydon, England\n\nThe Rolling Stones, but not the Beatles. What planet is the selection committee on?\n\nDave, Surrey, UK\n\nAnt and Dec in the Walk of Fame??? Walk of Shame sounds more like it...\n\nVangelis, Colchester, UK\n\nIt sounds like it is to be a tacky monument to celebrity rather than fame. Where are the true greats of English art - Terence Stamp, Steven Berkoff, Stanley Baker, Sean Connery ,George Formby, Norman Wisdom and Morecambe and Wise should be miles a head of Ant and Dec.\n\nMatt, London, England\n\nThe Spice Girls, as a group, or individually. You may mock, but in their prime they were the biggest UK stars and famous world wide. Paving the way for female pop acts for years to come - they deserve the recognition.\n\nSusan, Leeds, England\n\nWhat an utter waste of time. Not wanting to be a killjoy, but I don't see the point in digging up the pavement for the sake of a TV show.\n\nRichard, Redhill, UK\n\nSurely Anthony Hopkins and Richard Burton should be amongst the Stars. Dame Edna Everage - why???\n\nSimon Carr, Basingstoke, UK"
