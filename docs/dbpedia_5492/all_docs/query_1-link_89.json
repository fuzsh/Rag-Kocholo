        "text": "I've approved this with Zaz. This thread is very similar to the Recasting Classic Movies thread except it's the other way around. In this thread we will cast current movies(Pirates,Lord of the Rings,Star Wars,etc) with classic actors.\n\nFor example casting of Lord of the Rings might go like this\n\nBoris Karloff as Sauruman\n\nOrson Welles as Gandalf\n\nBe sure when you cast an actor to state which era of the actor's life you mean. For instance if you cast Marlon Brando in a role state Marlon Brando(On the Waterfront era) or Marlon Brando(50's)\n\nFor the first casting it seems fair that we should do Star Wars since the other thread started this way.\n\nLuke Skywalker...James Dean(50's)\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi...Claude Rains(40's)\n\nLeia...Betty Field(Of Mice and Men)\n\nHan Solo...Tim Holt(40's around his Treasure of Sierra Madre performance)\n\nGrand Moff Tarkin...Boris Karloff(Late 30's)\n\nThis is a terrific idea for a thread. Well done, Drac!\n\nJames Dean strikes me as having a bit too much coolness to be Luke. Luke must be a bit of a dag, a bit of they guy that you don't invite to your party because he'll start talking about serious things.\n\nSo, how I'd call it:\n\nLuke Skywalker...Alec Guinness (in his earliest work, although admittedly even then he is a touch too old)\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi...Orson Welles (later on in his career)\n\nLeia...Olivia de Havilland (in Robin Hood era)\n\nHan Solo...Errol Flynn\n\nGrand moff Tarkin...Basil Rathbone\n\nHa! I was thinking the same thing. Actually, I was thinking \"We are not having Star Wars without Guinness. Where could he fit...\" Except of course there is the problem that Guinness was never even in a play until he was 22 and never in a film until he was in his 30s. So instead I'd cast him as Tarkin, I think, say circa Zhivago? It doesn't really matter if Tarkin is younger since we know nothing about him.\n\nI also wouldn't cast James Dean as Luke, because as Rogue said, he's too cool. I think I'd go with Anthony Perkins circa his Oscar-nominated role as a Quaker who decides to fight in the Civil War in Friendly Persuasion. One of the most ridiculous type-castings in history was Perkins always playing the psychopath after Psycho. He's always at his best playing the confused, aw-shucks young man. I'm biased because I love Perkins, but I think he'd fit, really.\n\nAlso I'm going to say if you just took Takashi Shimura straight out of Seven Samurai, costume and all, he'd pretty much already be Obi-Wan.\n\nOther than that, I agree with things like Boggie for Solo... unless you wanted to go with someone a little less gruff and more suave, say, Paul Newman circa Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. Actually the more I think about it, I like that one.\n\n-sj loves kevin spacey"
