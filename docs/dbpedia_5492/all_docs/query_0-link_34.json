It was pretty nasty but being banned from this web site hardly seems a sufficient motive for writing it.\n\nFredrich\n\n*The Guardian – 18.01.18\n\n____________________________\n\nHi Fredrich,\n\nWe’ve spoken about this earlier on this page, so maybe it would be best to redirect you to this article which will explain what lead up to the publication of the ‘obituary’ and what has happened since. Wikipedia: To TheHeartOfIt\n\nTina\n\nHi\n\nI am writing to let you know about my YouTube channel called Retropia featuring the full series of Department S and now Jason King in HD quality for the first time:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@Retropia-zv9ix\n\nI have been a huge fan of Peter Wyngarde’s for many years having first enjoyed his work as a teenager watching his Klytus in Flash Gordon, No.2 in The Prisoner and of course as Jason King. I also very much enjoyed reading A Life Amongst Strangers, I couldn’t put it down! He had such a magnetic presence that stood out in whatever he appeared in, but he was also a very accomplished actor. It will always be a sadness that I did not get to meet him.\n\nI realised that a lot of his television work is quite difficult to find, especially in higher quality. I started with the entire series of Department S and am just about to finish uploading every episode of Jason King – am just finishing work on the last two EP25 and EP26. Each episode has been carefully remastered by myself, correcting colours, definition and then upscaled to HD so they now hopefully look good on large screen televisions.\n\nPeter also features in an episode of The Baron I recently uploaded (another classic ITC series) – Episode 10: The Legions of Ammak, which really showed his skill as an actor as this was a very different character to Jason King.\n\nI very much hope that you enjoy my Retropia channel and find it a fitting tribute to Peter and many fantastic shows of yesteryear that are still so rich and entertaining today.\n\nMark West\n\nHi!\n\nI’m new to this group. I recently joined because… my Grandmother worked in a Co-Op in Birmingham. When Peter was in digs in Rep, this was his local shop. My Nan recognized him and they would often talk, this led to them daily going to a Café for a Tea. Apparently he used always ask after me although I never met him. It was just their time.\n\nTal E. Shaanti\n\nDear Tina,\n\nTwo things I heard this week:\n\nThere is a genuine archaeological expedition being planned to find King Arthur’s sword, Excalibur (true story).\n\nIt’s time for Jason King to return to save us from all the crime and violence going on in the world right now.\n\nSince King Arthur is oft referred to as ‘The Once and Future King’ – a title that could easily be given to Jason (come on, those of us of a certain age wish we could turn the clock back to the glorious Seventies), why not combine the two to make one invincible super hero?\n\nSteve Cooper\n\nHi Tina,\n\nRegarding the forthcoming ‘No.2 action figure from Wandering Planet Toys:\n\nBrilliant. And he IS Jason Wyngarde! John Byrne, his artist creator, admitted it. Such an intercontextual accolade proves Peter’s popularity and instant global recognisability then, now and forever! Immortality in a sense. Though not in the sense we’d like!\n\nDerek Stewart\n\nRe. Peter’s song, ‘Rape’:\n\nSo offensive in so many ways now. But actually deconstructs some of the nastiness in a disarming fashion. Creates so much dissonance between honesty and good behaviour that only reasoned people should be allowed access.\n\nAndy Howe\n\nFind information about this song and the Peter Wyngarde album HERE\n\nI do really, really like the album , but find this song difficult to listen to.\n\nBryan Gerrard Longworth\n\nI skip it whenever I play the album. Sadly, the track overshadows some bona-fide gems.\n\nMick Cantone\n\nAs Peter once said of the song, “There are many types of rape. There’s the rape of countries, of cultures and of minds. It’s telling that some people’s minds are so limited that they can only conceive of one type.”\n\nTina Wyngarde-Hopkins\n\nSadly, the song doesn’t really illustrate that point clearly.\n\nMick Cantone\n\nWhy should it? I take it as literary criticism with the skill of someone who has experienced the darker side of the ambiguity of human nature.\n\nDeepinder Singh Cheema\n\nI think the entire album is a work of genius and the track ‘Rape’, like it or not, is what made it so talked about. It’s clearly, to my ears, tongue in cheek. It’s interesting to read Peter’s thoughts in the sleeve notes of the reissue, where he says people take things so literally, and while of course rape is horrible, you can’t get into any kind of subject unless you make a joke of it. He then pointed out about how people ended up being gagged due to things being banned – how right he was. Speak about a subject now that people might decide they find offensive, it can literally cost you your job and leave you ostracised for daring to even bring it up.\n\nJames Gaden\n\nNonsense the track means the album is remembered for all the wrong reasons.\n\nRaynard Toombes\n\nNonsense, the track Rape is at best challenging to these times, there are some timourous feelings which abound your get stronger stuff in the Bible and works of the bard not to mention the Greek underworld. I do like the drumming and production on Rape, All in all a great evenings entertainment.\n\nDeepinder Singh Cheema\n\nHello,\n\nMy name is Peter March and I was born in Portsmouth in 1947. I studied Architecture and Design during the 60’s with a lot of travel to London during 1965 and 1966. As a born rebel with a cause I did a “runner” in 1967 and came to Sydney for a few months, still here !! Although I have a business in Sydney my real love is for NZ and it’s getting very close for the final “runner”!\n\nAs it was for a lot of blokes of my age, the sixties were years of great adventure. Music and clothes, entertainment and travel plus sexy Jaguar “E” Types to drool over when my weekly pay was ten quid a week! However I think a pint was ninepence and a wimpy burger, hell lets not go there or I will think about poor Dudley Moore making burgers in “Bedazzled”.\n\nTelevision was so important with all the new and exciting shows, John Steed and the Avengers of course. TW3 and of course Pete and Dud. However in spite of all the stars and shows I always remember Peter Wyngarde as a hero, when to be young one needed heroes. At that time I was taken with a TV series called “It’s Dark Outside” and a new star was being seen in the shape of Oliver Reed. I loved the show and the popular song “Where Are You Now” by Jackie Trent.\n\nPeter Wyngarde was head and shoulders above the rest. A stunning actor who made each role so full of life. I will never forget him in “A Tale of Two Cities” and the memory stays with me. As Jason King he made life bearable in unbearable Australia in the late 60’s. Australia was still a 50’s and sometimes a 30’s society in those times and to watch Peter portray a character beyond the typical Aussie appreciation was just fabulous. Now we have reached the new century and all those Actors who had great voices and diction have gone, replaced by Hugh Grant ! No thanks. We have old mumbler Russell Crowe leading the charge of new hopefuls, I think not !! Even James Robertson Justice looked and sounded like a man even if he was a bit of a ham.\n\nWith my sincerest wishes, .\n\nPeter March\n\nSuperb actor of the highest quality. Peter should have been afforded the opportunity to play James Bond in many films. In interviews Peter appears to be such a kind and gentle man: Peter was certainly a gentleman by anybody’s standards. It is heartening to know that Peter will live on forever in his film & television performances, not only for his millions of fans and admirers from my generation, but also for younger people who can watch and appreciate Peter’s beautiful contribution to our lives. God Bless Peter Wyngarde.\n\nDave\n\nI’d loved you, dear Peter, from the age of ten when you first appeared as Jason King in Department S. Stayed faithful to your memory til his death. Thanks for all your kind thoughts and letters over the years. Much love.\n\nErica P.\n\nPeter Wyngarde was one of the finest classical actors. Loved from the first time I saw him on TV as Sydney Carton in A Tale of Two Cities. Superb Oberon in A Midsummer Nights Dream too, and in Duel of Angels at the Apollo Theatre. A lovely man.\n\nKristl T.\n\nTina,\n\nI have just finished Peter’s biography. It’s unbelievably touching and undoubtedly written with loyalty and love. As someone who has experienced caring for a sick loved one until the very end and being by their side until they passed, I could feel Tina’s pain and stress.\n\nNo one could have given more than Tina did in her love for this sweet and sensitive man in the time that they were together.\n\nYou were a loving tribute to him Tina. Fate was gracious in bringing you both together x\n\nStephanie Harpin\n\nHi Tina,\n\nRegarding the article, ‘Gaming With Jason King‘:\n\nFan-blooming-tastic! And the entire ‘yarn’ was great. And I’m SOOOO happy that his velvet came through ‘undefelted’ (if there is such a thing – there is now!)! I must be a sad case, but it transported me back fifty odd years! Truly ‘FAB’!\n\nDerek Stewart\n\n____________________________\n\nHello Derek,\n\nSo glad you liked it, Derek. I thought it was something a bit different; a fun article and, it was created by people outside our group to show how fondly Peter, and the character of Jason King, is remembered.\n\nTina\n\n____________________________\n\nTina,\n\nI enjoyed it because it was ‘just right’: just silly enough, just entertaining enough, just knowledgeable enough, just… ‘Goldilocks Porridge’ enough! Ha ha. Enjoyable hokum – which was ITC’s forte.\n\nOh, just so you know what you already know, Peter (if I may be so familiar!) was and still IS so universally admired and loved by all (except the odd numpty who love to hate, who hate people who are loved, and who probably hate themselves – the last part being fair enough!) that I honestly have hardly ever heard anyone say anything bad about him (bar the odd lesser hurtful ‘urban myth’ that I set them straight on, as far as I can). And I am an ‘ITC Anorak’ who converses with numerous people on that subject (and their programmes and stars) virtually every day, so I know how well respected he is. In fact, the only person who gets more plaudits and is remembered more fondly, in my experience, is the late, great Sir RGM – Roger Moore (who I received a fan email FROM!). Signed photos of both legends – Roger and Peter (the latter of which you had Peter sign many a long yonk ago!) – loom large over my right shoulder in my office (along with dozens of others, I have to say, such as Tony Curtis, Patrick Allen – whose wife Sarah Lawson sadly died just months ago – Ian Ogilvy… Yes, an anorak!). Take care, and keep up the good work.\n\nDerek\n\nHi Tina,\n\nI have just (3 days ago) bought your biography of Peter and I am already more than halfway through. When it arrived it was a whopping creature bigger than I expected but well worth the money. You have done a thorough research on Peter’s background and it’s wording is clear and concise.\n\nI’ve just reached chapter 111 (Broken Wings) which I will start tomorrow. This biography is full of wit, some sadness but a lot of love. There have been some bits in it that made me smile such as Peter not getting on with the internet (I have an old friend like that, she’s says “computers don get on with her” ).\n\nEven though I’m just into the second half of the book I can see that you were his loving champion and that Peter was a very lucky man to have you in his life.\n\nStephanie Harpin\n\nJust to say that I came across Peter by chance when my daughter was a baby (she’s 25 next week) was up around 6am I day and started watching Jason King on Granada+ (no longer available) and I’ve been a HUGE fan ever since,keep up the good work,\n\nRichard Clegg\n\nDear Tina,\n\nPeter was a pal of mine in the 70s when we were neighbours in Kensington. A very funny, friendly guy who was wonderful company. I miss him. Greatly underrated as an actor. He was excellent in Night of the Eagle. RIP.\n\nStephen Gilchrist\n\nDear Tina,\n\nI was thinking a couple of days ago of the Prisoner 50th Anniversary event at Portmeirion when my mate, John Uttley and I met you, Peter and Thomas (Bowington) at the Village Hotel. It was such a wonderful weekend, you guys we’re wonderful company, I’ll never forget your kindnesses. Truly one of the most glorious times I’ve ever spent, Peter was great and all those in attendance we’re treated to a very special time. A time to treasure. Hope you and Thomas have a bright and beautiful future, your passionate nature’s are a shining testimony to a great man who gave us all extra twinkles from the most extraordinary star. He was a true gentleman.\n\nChristian James\n\n____________________________\n\nHello Christian,\n\nIt’s so nice to hear from you. I was just thinking about the event in Portmeirion, and how happy we all felt the, little knowing what was just around the corner. At least such lovely memories of being with Peter and having the opportunity to meet people like John and yourself, helps get Thomas and I through the bad times, of which there’s been many. Bless you!\n\nTina and Thomas\n\nTina,\n\n‘Peter Wyngarde: A Life Amongst Strangers’ is a fabulous book Tina. A real tribute and testament to the memory of fabulous Peter and all that he did xx\n\nIan Kelland\n\n____________________________\n\nThanks Ian. That means a lot, because you knew him for a long time. I just hope he’d approve.\n\nTina\n\n___________________________\n\nIt’s a difficult one Tina. Peter would have wanted to be very discreet over details of his life but how can you tell his story without telling his whole story? I’m sure he’ll be far beyond discretion now & very touched with what you wrote in your book. The overall thing that touched me with your book was the respect you had for Peter. Who was, evidently, a celebrity who the press, unfairly, dragged through the mud. Love & Light to Peter\n\nIan Kelland\n\nDear Tina,\n\nIn one of my JFK moments, I know where I was when I heard the news that Peter had passed away. I now live about thirty feet from where I was when I heard it on my car’s wireless (radio, for all you youngsters)! And what a WONDERFUL tribute Radio Scotland gave him in the bulletin – it took over a minute to get through! I know that doesn’t sound much, but for a three minute ‘on the hour’ news bulletin (including weather), it was very nice of them. But deserved. Peace to him, and bless you all.\n\nDerek Stewart\n\n________________________\n\nHello Derek.\n\nRadio Scotland interviewed Thomas (Bowington) on 18th January, and Radio Ulster did a piece about Peter’s life and career on the same day as part of their Arts Show Programme.\n\nTina\n\n________________________\n\nHi Tina,\n\nQuite right as well. He deserved all the plaudits he got – and more. But David McCallum – the legendary Scottish actor from UNCLE – barely had a mention in the UK news – I listened to them all (maybe because he died the same time as Sir Michael Gambon, who had most of the headlines – and fair enough, because he was good as well). McCallum had lots of mentions in the news here in Scotland, of course. By the way, McCallum had a Scottish accent in real life – and even his Illya Kuryakin had a Scottish twang! Yet another one of my lifelong favourites gone. And recently Glynis Johns, David Soul… Such is life, I’m afraid!\n\nDerek Stewart\n\nHi Tina,\n\nMuch fun was to be had a few days ago* when I read the following post by someone called Rosemary H*** regarding Peter’s turn as Number 2 on a social media group for The Prisoner: “Creepy in everything he acted in as far as I am concerned”, so I replied to her asking if she’d preferred the Lawrence Olivier directed version of ‘Duel of Angels‘ that had toured the UK in the late 1950s, or the Robert Helpmann adaptation that premiered on Broadway in 1960?\n\nI also asked where she’d seen ‘Mother Adam‘, ‘Night Conspirators‘ and ‘Pick-Up Girl‘, etc. and what her impression was of the television presentations of ‘As You Like It’ in March 1953, ‘A Tale of Two Cities‘ (1957) and the 1964 series, ‘Rupert of Henzu’.\n\n“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” she replied.\n\n“Oh, I’m sorry,” I responded. “You appeared to be implying that you’d seen EVERYTHING Peter Wyngarde had acted in.” Needless to say she vanished without trace. I doubt very much that anyone is surprised to hear this, or to learn that the sum total of her knowledge regarding Peter’s body of work amounts to nothing more than a couple of episodes of The Avengers, Department S and, of course, his appearance in The Prisoner.\n\nWhat a ridiculous little woman.\n\nAlex Thorpe\n\n*This email was received on 13.01.24\n\nHi Tina,\n\nI got your book for Christmas and just finished reading it earlier today (31.12.23). It was a treat to read something different about Peter than the usual rubbish in the press.\n\nPaul Beachcroft\n\nRegarding the article, ‘Department S vesus Jason King‘:\n\nA lot to digest in the blog, with some (ahem) “interesting view points”! I have to go for Dept S with the strong supporting cast, but it’s close being 51% /49%. I watch both with equal pleasure. The Man From X is my fav (and I own the Snakeskin Jacket from that episode!).\n\nRick Blackman\n\nI knew Cyril Frankel very well, we always said he was the kindest, wisest man we ever met. When he sadly passed at 96, there were lots of photos from actors, many expressing thanks for his professional help and mentoring. Cyril spoke many times of Peter Wyngarde, and always said what a true professional he was and loved working with him (everyone together for a period has a few artistic differences of course!)\n\nCyril was allowed to take a memento from his time working on the ITC shows. He chose a print of the Department S episode, ‘Fish Out of Water’, I gave this director’s spool to Henry Cobbold (who is a real film buff) at Knebworth House, to have a look at it and see if still works. Henry penned Cyril’s autobiography “Eye to Eye”.\n\nTim Piercy\n\nI’ve been reading with interest the various comments on your website regarding the Donald Spoto biography, ‘Otherwise Engaged – The Life of Alan Bates’ and the absolute drivel that he wrote about both Alan and Peter Wyngarde.\n\nI knew Alan very well and I can say on authority that Spoto’s book wasn’t researched properly. There were many people who were close to Alan who Spoto didn’t even bother speaking to because all he wanted to talk about was his sexuality. I’m not surprised that Peter W. was so angry at the way he was treated by this author. I can’t tell you how pleased I am that you’ve published the truth* in Peter’s own words and written in his own hand.\n\nA.S. Stevenson\n\n*Read Peter’s thoughts on Spoto and his own explanation as to the true nature of his ‘relationship; with Alan Bates, here and here.\n\nJason King Boxset from Umbrella Entertainment.\n\nThis set is a thing of beauty, far superior to the UK Network release. Even comes with a repro ITC brochure.\n\nDarren Brown\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe shameful thing on Umbrella’s part was that at the time of release this was not as heavily marketed as previous releases. This release even failed to hit long range release lists and hit the shops with heavy surprise. I had heard that since it was essentially\n\na surprise release, many collectors did not know until either they saw it on the shelf or found out too late when they were taken off the shelves. A very good release though and beautifully presented for one of the “16mm club”. I still have mine from the first day of release.\n\nAdam Lonsdale\n\nSadly I have to agree with Peter himself, who said, solo Jason King would never be as good as Department S…which I have to agree, he was right.\n\nChris O-Ten\n\nViavision have reissued Jason King with the special features from both the Network and Umbrella sets. Click here for info.\n\nJames Helyer\n\nHi!\n\nI’m new to this (Facebook) group. I recently joined because my brother and I only discovered Peter Wyngarde on YouTube this summer. Department S was a suggestion after watching his Avengers episode. And what a find he was! Wish I had known about him sooner. So I bought your book via Amazon, found Hellfire Hall website plus the Facebook group last night and am anxious and excited to learn, explore and be a part of this community.\n\nCindy Adams\n\nNice to meet you Cindy (you know what I mean).\n\nThis is a fab group of Mr Wyngarde fans. A great group of like minded people. There are a couple of episodes of The Avengers which Peter was in. I assume you saw ‘A Touch of Brimstone’ which is the B&W episode. I think this is a lot of people’s favourite episode & it actually inspired Stan Lee’s Hellfire Club in the X-men comics. I’m being kind, his Hellfire Club was a total rip but he also loved Peter, so it’s cool. He loved him so much there was a Marvel comic called Jason Wyngarde, which came out in the late 60’s/early 70s. But, sorry, I’ve gone off on a tangent. I only found out about this very recently and was all “Aha, that explains a lot & is utterly brilliant”. The second episode of The Avengers is a colour one called “Epic”, it’s Mrs Peel & John Steed one again, battling an over the top & on form Mr Wyngarde. He’s a washed up old actor. Of course, it’s fantastic, it’s The Avengers. He was in a lot of TV shows including The Prisoner & one of his great later performances is in one of the Sherlock Holmes series, the one starring Jeremy Brett “Tittle for tattle”. Oh, just so, oh. I know you get it.\n\nSteve Zala\n\nHi Tina,\n\nI was absolutely delighted to hear that that highly controversial conviction against Peter dating from the mid 1970s has finally been overturned by the UK government. The press over here in the States were already questioning its legitimacy way before the Home Office made their decision in July of ’23. Andrew Stuttaford wrote in the National Review back in February 2018:-\n\n“…although the reality may have been less clear-cut than the newspaper headlines after Wyngarde’s conviction liked to suggest.”\n\nIt’s desperately sad that these revisions are only now being made when they really should’ve been done during Peter’s lifetime, but then time has always been the ultimate teller of truths. Just keep fighting the good fight, dear lady, and don’t allow the naysayers to grind you down.\n\nRegards,\n\nMatt Turner, Columbus – a lifelong Wyngarde fan\n\nDear Tina,\n\nWhat a super duper surprise to find an appreciation society for one of our very best actors.\n\nI have been a fan since seeing him way back in the 1960s in Night of the Eagle and followed his career without pause enjoying every performance. Loved him in Jason King even if it was very campy and OTT, but what great entertainment. Just the stuff to blow away all the cares. And how scrumptious he always looked in his flares and furbelows. And that moustache and hairy chest!\n\nOn the serious side I battled my way to the box office to get tickets for The King and I in 1973, and enjoyed every minute. I even met and spoke with him once. I was on the way to the Odeon cinema, Kensington, and he was cleaning his Bentley Continental. He was so sweet and charming when I said “Hello” and mentioned how much I enjoyed his performances; so natural and unaffected.\n\nI caught a glimpse of him last year in a programme about screen cads and he looked as gorgeous.\n\nJill Basten\n\nDear Tina.\n\nI hope you don’t mind me messaging.\n\nMy dad, who passed away seven years ago, was a big Peter Wyngarde fan. He was brought up with the 60’s shows like The Avengers, The Champions and of course Department S. When these shows re-emerged on the Sky channel Bravo (I believe PW would present some of these, or appeared in some regard) in the 90’s my dad and I would have great fun watching them together, he’d tell my about his favourite shows and we’d watch for familiar faces popping up early in their careers (Donald Sutherland seemed to make the rounds through most of these shows).\n\nOf these of course were Department S and Jason King. Dad (as do I) loved a scene-stealer and loved Jason King, and we’d think it the best thing ever when PW turned up in other shows (The Avengers being our favourite, and he livened up the episode of The Champions he was in), and we’d both walk around the house saying Fancy! to each other.\n\nAnyway, one Christmas I managed to acquire a copy of Peter Wyngarde’s album on CD, which he absolutely loved and got pride of place in his collection. He’d listen to it often and would always tell me about it when he did As mentioned, my dad is no longer with us and every so often I feel I have to let go of something that I would have kept a year ago including, sadly, the CD.\n\nStuart Rich\n\n___________________\n\nHello Stuart,\n\nI was desperately sorry to hear that your Dad is no longer with us. However, I was delighted to learn that watching the re-runs of Department S and The Avengers together had brought you both such pleasure and made some special memories for you.\n\nDo Take Care!\n\nTina\n\nDear Tina,\n\nRegarding the re. issue of ‘Night of the Eagle’ on Blu-ray in Australia: I’ve had the DVD for many, many years, and watch it periodically, but I STILL watch it every single time it comes on TV (which, admittedly, is far too seldom for such a classic!) because it’s great to know that other people are viewing it at the same time, and are glorying in the communal chills it surreptitiously and inexorably delivers to the spine!\n\nIf anyone reading this hasn’t seen it, buy the DVD. You will NOT be sorry!\n\nIt shows Peter at his best, in a multifaceted portrayal of a sceptic in all things supernatural who slowly comes to comprehend that there ARE entities beyond our ken! Entities that some people can conjure up – but not necessarily control!\n\nDerek Stewart\n\nBrilliant!\n\nFor better or worse, Peter Wyngarde will be remembered for the “character” of Jason King – a character whose suaveness and “way with the ladies” have become shorthand for that brief period when the mainstream of popular culture appropriated – and vulgarised – certain aspects of swinging London and the hippy/groovy lifestyle of half a decade before. I would suggest that it was his great skills as an actor that allowed him to inhabit this role with such aplomb. Compare/contrast with say Tony Curtis and Roger Moore (both fine actors on their day) in “The Persuaders” who were utterly stiff and unconvincing.\n\nPeter committed to that part with astonishing success; I would also suggest – however it looks through the prism of time – that he became a kind of feminist icon. I recall a brief period when almost every other suburban kitchen seemed to have a picture/poster of Jason King somewhere – usually in a leather catsuit – whose attentive, soulful eyes and cat-like physique seemed to offer everything to a woman that she wasn’t currently getting. Is it any coincidence that the women’s liberation movement hit a kind of peak during the Jason King years? The defiant act of pinning Jason to the wall (or in one instance I heard, the bedroom ceiling) was a simple statement that men needed to change in some fairly fundamental ways; unlike, say, James Bond – loved more by men than women – this was a character who Peter suggested actually liked women on many levels; was attentive to them – who dressed as carefully as them – to please them and himself of course – and sought a significant connection with them above and beyond sex. That was really powerful stuff circa 1970.\n\nT.J.\n\nBrilliant website great job.\n\nShelly Hodgson\n\nDear Tina,\n\nI just wanted to say how amazing it was to see you, Peter and Sam J. Jones having a laugh together in the ‘Life After Flash’ documentary. I know that Peter and Sam were great friends, so it was fitting that S.J.J. should write the foreword for your book.\n\nI saw Sam at an event a few weeks ago and mentioned to him that I’m a big Wyngarde fan and a member of the Appreciation Society. He mentioned you, saying what a lovely lady you are.\n\nAll the best then.\n\nRich Garton\n\nHi Tina,\n\nI’m so delighted to see this website is thriving. I used to be a member of your Facebook group and, to my shame, also a member of the Department Wyngarde group, but when the latter threw open its doors to a gang of foul mouthed bigots and troublemakers I felt so sickened that I left social media altogether. Can’t tell you how glad I was to hear that F.B. saw fit to remove it for breaching their bullying and abuse rules.\n\nKeep your head up. Rest assured that the people who lied and misrepresented themselves for the purposes of encouraging a witch hunt will eventually be held to account. Karma inevitably ends up tapping people like that on the shoulder when they least expect it.\n\nLong Live The King!\n\nGary D.\n\nDear Tina,\n\nI agree entirely with Trevor McNulty [See previous email]. It must be wonderful to know that the tittle-tattlers, muckrakers and purveyors of all the unconfirmed crap about Peter Wyngarde online and in the ‘papers are shrinking into rubbery rags like deflated balloons. People are all too eager to repeat the rumours and hearsay they read online without giving a moments consideration as to whether it’s true or not. I imagine these same people would protest long and loud if they were to find themselves the target of gossip, and yet they’re perfectly happy to do it to someone else.\n\nKeep up your exceptional work,\n\nCarl Johnson\n\nDear Ms. Wyngarde-Hopkins,\n\nOver the past few months I’ve slowly but surely been going through this amazing website and acquainting myself more fully with Peter and his work. I can only thank you for sharing so much of his life with us, his fans. For years he has been appallingly misrepresented by the press here in the UK and latterly online. The fact that you have posted so many original documents and pieces of his writings, the vast majority of them in his own hand, has helped to dispel the malicious rumours and myths about him. You should be commended for not just saying “This” or “That” is untrue and expecting us to take your word for it, you’ve actually provided the evidence to back it up.\n\nWhilst on that subject, some months ago I read a review of your book, ‘Peter Wyngarde: A Life Amongst Strangers’ (a magnificent read, by the way), in which the person writing it bemoaned the fact that you hadn’t included a copy of Peter’s birth certificate within its pages. Well, I’ve read countless biographies and autobiographies over the years but I can’t bring to mind a single one that contains such a document. Isn’t the fact that you have added a Companion page to this website displaying many of the documents and letters referred to in the book (in addition to those mentioned previously) not enough? Again, I know of no other author that has been so diligent and honest. Perhaps if authors such as Donald Spoto had been as equally conscientious when writing his Alan Bates biography[1] (and it’s readers less willing to take his word as so utterly unimpeachable), Peter Wyngarde wouldn’t have been forced to spend his finally years being maligned and gossiped about by misguided scandalmongers.\n\nDo keep up your excellent work. With regards,\n\nTrevor McNulty\n\n[1]: ‘Otherwise Engaged: The Life of Alan Bates’.\n\nSee also, You’ve Read The Book, Now Read It In Peter’s Own Words\n\nDear Tina,\n\nPeter and I were good friends back in the day but had a bit of a falling out some years ago over a silly misunderstanding and, sadly, didn’t sort it out before he passed, but I tried as you know.\n\nYou were obviously a true and loyal friend, partner and soulmate to him. I am happy you were there for him. Loved the book and congratulations on that achievement. Peter was one of the funniest people I have ever known. Sad we didn’t patch things up as we could have had a few more laughs.\n\nRegards,\n\nMike Hewitson\n\nWell done Tina on the success of your amazing book.\n\nI met Peter when I was a child when he was in Leeds playing in ‘The King and I’. My father took me to the stage door. He was just a lovely man and somewhere I still have his autograph.\n\nSteve Hirst\n\nDear Tina,\n\nI assume it was you sitting with Peter on the 12th at Westminster, and in the photo I’m posting here? It was great to meet him on Saturday – the highlight of my day. Hope it’s Ok for me to put that quote I read to him here, along with 2 photos. I posted these to several other film-related Groups yesterday, and got lots of positive reactions – it’s clear from those, from the postings on your Facebook Group page, and from the\n\nlong queue to meet him on 12th, that Peter’s appeal is undiminished. I hope that he (and you) enjoyed the day at Westminster. This is what I posted in other Groups: “Yesterday, I finally got to meet the great Peter Wyngarde, the star of the film. He was pleased to hear this quote from the book “Frightmares”: “extremely effective….. Wyngarde, a talented actor… is excellent here as the academic who goes from icy arrogance to wide-eyed terror….. Flora’s motive is ostensibly professional rivalry…. but there is a suggestion that the younger man’s vitality and good looks are also a factor. Wyngarde appears semi-naked… his physique conspicuously eroticised” and he signed a very appropriate photo.\n\nAndy Ellis\n\nI only met Peter once, Tina, but he was everything that I hoped that he would be. He was was charming, suave and a true gentleman. Peter will never truly be gone because he will live on in the absolutely amazing body of work that he left behind him. A truly amazing and wonderful legacy for us all to enjoy! X\n\nRobert Wilson\n\nHello,\n\nI fell in love with Peter at the age of 10 when I saw him in ‘A Tale of Two Cities’ and again in my early 20’s when he starred in Dept S and Jason King. Since his death I’ve read quite a bit about him and feel he was one of nature’s gentlemen. Very few people could have come out of a Japanese internment camp mentally unscathed but he went onward and upward. This in itself makes him a remarkable individual. He clearly was a very clever man with a positive mindset. All the changes he made to the JK character paid off handsomely, too bad directors and producers didn’t listen more.\n\nAs for his sexual orientation, we will never really know what went on and we don’t have to. In the swinging 60’s and 70’s a lot of people experimented, maybe he did too. Journalists write what sells papers and are still dragging people through mud. Today I don’t think people believe half of what they read, we were not quite as aware in the 70’s. Personally, I always thought and still do that he was a very sexy man and I will always love him. He remains a fascinating enigma.\n\nIngrid Howard\n\nWhat a wonderful piece of writing about him. This is why we’ll all keep his memory alive, and what makes this site so much like a family.\n\nFiona Van Deventer\n\nDear Tina,\n\nThey say never meet your hero’s, but on Saturday 28th March 2015 in Westminster London myself and my best friend did and we were delighted, with how nice and funny and how good he was with his fans proving the old saying wrong. Today that special day is more special for us with the sad news today of the passing of Mr Peter Wyngarde known to most people as Jason King.\n\nFor me Peter Wyngarde was one of Britain’s greatest actors and also one of the most underrated, he had the incredible rare talent of being able to completely disappear into the character he was portraying so you forgot you were watching an actor playing a part or that you were watching Peter Wyngarde in something, but were watching an actual person who really existed and not a fictional character. This can be seen best in his roles before the one that would make him internationally famous such as The Baron episode the Legion of Ammak in which he play two roles of King Ibrahim (Not the other King he was to brilliantly play later on) and an actor who also impersonates the King. What amazed me with this Wyngarde didn’t simply play the part of the King and the actor but when the actor had to play the King to near perfection he still made it different enough compared to the real King he was playing. Watching Peter Wyngarde was one of the reasons I wanted to originally become an actor I wanted to be able to do what he did play any role without the audience thinking they were watching an actor.\n\nHe was an actor who always left us wanting more Department S is a prime example of one ITC show I wanted more off. I wish they were more things for me to watch with him in, one because Peter never failed to deliver every time he was in something guest or star he never disappointed. He had the rare talent of being able to be a character actor as well as a leading man and succeeding in both. He has left a legacy which I hope will continue to be discovered by each new generation of television and film fans and his talent being continued to be appreciated.\n\nFarewell Peter and thank you for showing me what a true actor can be capable of.\n\nTravis Nicholls\n\nDear Tina,\n\nWhen I met you and Peter in London back in 2016, he signed the attached picture. He commented that he disliked the picture because he was smoking in it. I admitted that I was a smoker whereby Peter gave me some tips to give up. Would you say thank you to him from me as I took the bull by the horns and am now cigarette free.\n\nVince Ferguson\n\nHi Tina,\n\nOh Tina. I was so very sorry that there have been some idiots harassing you and Thomas Bowington since Peter passed away. I suspect that if it wasn’t you/Thomas, it would be someone else, that’s what these morons are like.\n\nI rarely post on social media, but love this website and your Facebook page. I just prefer to read the posts, tributes, and see all the fabulous photos which bring back such great memories of a wonderful childhood. One of those memories is of sitting down with my parents to watch Department S and Jason King together. They were such fun and happy times. We loved Peter and being able to come to this website/FB page and relive some of those happy times has brightened some pretty sad days for me, certainly over the last 3 years, and I thank you with all my heart for creating both.\n\nThese unfortunate souls [trolls] who, it would appear, are endeavouring to trample all over the memory of Peter, but they will never win because he has so many fans and admirers the world over who won’t let that happen. You and Peter were, and are, soulmates. True love transcends everything. Don’t let these individuals get to you Tina. They are simply not worth it. It makes me sick to my stomach that you are having to deal with all of this. Stay strong and know that you have the love and support of all of us here. Thinking of you. xx\n\nAnnie Scott\n\nDear Tina,\n\nI met Peter when I was on a charity skiing trip in Switzerland. He wanted to do something for our group and tried to arrange skiing lessons, but his PR people wanted to big up the charity angle and he refused. Instead he arranging sleighs to take us to his hotel, and he had a tea party for us in his lobby. Such a wonderful, kind and generous man. He gave me hope that celebrities can be nice people as well.\n\nJulia Young\n\n_______________\n\nAnd yet there are still some people who are so vile about him – usually those who were never privileged to meet him. Thank you, Julia. Tina\n\nDear Tina,\n\nI never met Peter. But I loved his acting, his voice, and his sartorial style. Following his passing I did two small acts in tribute. I contributed to a BBC radio piece which I hope was considered and respectful while also being honest.\n\nSecondly I took up my paintbrush for the first time properly in years and painted a portrait. It’s not quite right, but it was impulsive. So inadvertently, thanks Peter for inspiring me yet again.\n\nRobert JE Simpson.\n\nDear Tina,\n\nWhen I saw those text messages from Peter to you on your ‘Thoughts of Peter‘ page, I didn’t know whether to put a Heart emoji or a Sad Face because both messages are overflowing with love and gratitude, yet full of sorrow because of what we all know happened – the abuse he suffered from people not worthy of cleaning his boots while he was still amongst us and the even sadder event of his passing.\n\nI decided on the hearts because of the obvious, unreserved, unconditional love between Peter and you, and the very different love we fans (lifelong in my case – well, since I was about 7) have – and always will have – for Peter.\n\nAbove: The “Thomas” mentioned in the message to the right is Thomas Bowington – Peter’s friend and agent.\n\nIt’s absolutely dreadful for you, this continuing bitterness from a handful of morons. It’s easy for me to say, but embrace the love I’m sure you get from 99% of people, and repel the vitriol from the vipers. Most of them will be doing it to give value to their inadequate lives – when all the time it devalues them. Sad cases.\n\nI truly hope Peter now resides in a more equitable, caring, and peaceful place. RIP, fella.\n\nTake care.\n\nDerek Stewart\n\nFeel & feeling for you Tina. You know life is a wonderful thing, it’s not just physical. When we leave our mortal coil, we live on, of that i have no doubt whatsoever. So be strong of heart, cos you will be together when its your turn to make that step to the next level of Existence X\n\nDave Author\n\nHe was a true gentleman. In every sense of the word The loud mouth trolls will fade away. But Peters legacy will span the ages\n\nKevin Mocatta\n\nMy mother also passed in Jan 2018 and it’s so odd to have messages on my device from days before.\n\nTony Barlow\n\n___________________________\n\nHello Tony,\n\nI could never delete or get rid of that old phone, and I’m sure you feel the same way about your Mum’s messages. I still have both Peter’s mobile number and that of the flat in my (new) phone, as I just can’t bear to remove them from the contacts list.\n\nTina\n\nDear Ms. Wyngarde-Hopkins,\n\nDo not be swayed by the comments and ignorance of narrow minded, arrogant people. I met Peter only once and he was an absolute delight. I was able to shake hands with him and to thank him for all of the marvellous entertainment that he had given us over the years and for his enormous contribution to the acting profession. It was performances like his that shaped my generation into having and interest in the multiplicity of genre’s that we all enjoy. He was absolutely electric in Sherlock Holmes and wonderful as Jason King. A dear friend of mine was named “Jason” because of Peter. There was a lovely tribute in The Times the week Peter passed away from Steven Berkhoff who spoke very warmly about his enduring legend that we still enjoy today.\n\nWe have all lost dear ones and that is our private business, but what I will say is that for those very reasons, we should celebrate their memory even more so. Now you channel any hurt and anger at what has happened toward an absolute conviction as we all feel, that here was a television legend; an actor of great repute, who shone and continues to shine through the various media we have today.\n\nI recall a very nice letter I received from the actor Don Henderson, many years ago. Peter starred alongside Don in an episode of “Bulman” called, “I Met A Man Who Was Not There”. He spoke very highly of Peter and Don was honoured to work with him. Now we want to “Meet A Man Who Is Not Here” to see, to enjoy, to celebrate his memory. I will share with you something Don said to me privately, which were his last words to me after an 11 year friendship, “If anyone ever messes you about, tell em to Fuck Off !” I know you are probably too kind a person to use such language, but Don mean’t it kindly from the heart and that is what WE say to you now. Do not be swayed by ignorant opinion. We know why we like and why we love and so do you, and THAT is all that matters!\n\nAll The Very Best to you,\n\nGarron Martin\n\nPeter Wyngarde – A god among men.\n\n@fillem_Shaun – Via Twitter\n\nHello Tina,\n\nI was utterly delighted to see that all three editions of your book were back on their respective Amazon Best Sellers List on 22nd February (2023). More often than not, a biography has a shelf life of around eighteen months to two years, but yours just keeps selling which is testament to Peter’s enduring popularity.\n\nAs you know, Peter and I were friends for many years and I’m sure he’d be so proud of everything you’ve done and continue to do in his name. I’m so blessed to have got to know you through him.\n\nWith love and every best wish,\n\nAnnette A.\n\nHi Tina!\n\nCongratulations on the success of your amazing book and this stunning website, despite the concerted efforts of a handful of morons to stick the boot in (jealousy is a terrible thing). There are actually a hell of a lot of people out here who greatly appreciate everything you do to keep Peter’s name in the public consciousness. He was a unique talent and a wonderful man.\n\nLook after yourself and keep up the excellent work.\n\nMartin Kelland\n\n__________________\n\nThank you, Martin – much appreciated.\n\nI’m delighted to report that this website is going from strength to strength, as we’re currently getting an average of 134 visitors every hour – up from 80. That works out at over 20,000 hits a week.\n\nTina\n\nHello!\n\nI was delighted to hear about your book; I didn’t know there was one, but it’s definitely of interest. I’m a huge fan of Peter’s. Thank you for letting me know!\n\nJames Moran – Writer-director (Severance, Cockneys Vs Zombies, Tower Block, Doctor Who, Torchwood, Primeval, Spooks & more).\n\nDear Tina,\n\nThe memory I carry of Peter is the time I met him with my fiancee at a Comic Con in Birmingham in 2016. My fiancee was talking to him and he started stroking her hand and then pretended to cut his hand on one of her many rings. He was saying things like “Ouch! That hurt!” While my fiancee was fussing over him he looked up at me standing behind her and winked. He was having her on!\n\nDavid Gogarty\n\nTo my childhood hero, and that voice of pure velvet. I still at 5, spend days watching Jason king on you-tube. A hero and icon to me.\n\nKevin Mocatta\n\nDear Tina,\n\nI aw Peter’s production of Dracula at the Wimbledon Theatre in 1975 with members of the newly formed Dracula Society and went for a meal afterwards with him at a local Indian restaurant. He then gave several of us a lift home to Fulham and Kensington in his vintage motor car.\n\nGeoff Beresford\n\nHi Tina,\n\nI saw Peter in Present Laughter, The King and I and Dracula in Birmingham and Wolverhampton. I was also lucky to get autographs.\n\nPhil Wilson\n\nHello Tina,\n\nI saw Dracula numerous times when Peter came to Hull’s New Theatre in the 70s. He and the play was outstanding.\n\nChris O-Ten\n\nDear Tina,\n\nI was Peter’s neighbour in Earls Terrace in the 70s. A lovely, funny man. A pleasure to have known him and to have been his friend.\n\nStephen Gilchrist, London\n\nDear Tina,\n\nI was wondering if you’d seen this on Twitter and know what it’s about?\n\nJohn Castle\n\nThe above were taken by ‘man-with-a-pencilcase’ from this website\n\n________________\n\nHello John,\n\nYes, I did know about it. The difference between ‘man-with-a-pencilcase’ (A.K.A. @george_cowley) and Gyles Brandreth is that the latter was a big enough man to apologise when he was proven wrong.\n\nThe person attempting to sh*t-stir had, a few months earlier, also picked up on something that actress, Madeline Smith, had posted on her personal Facebook page regarding me. She’d been asked who I was, as my book – ‘Peter Wyngarde: A Life Amongst Strangers’ – was due for publication. Ms. Smith had been a friend of Peter’s back in the 1960’s and 70’s and had attended his funeral in January 2018. She, Caron Gardner, Thomas Bowington (Peter’s friend and agent) and I had gone for a meal afterwards at the Old Bull and Bush in London. However, when she’d responded to the aforementioned enquiry, she hadn’t made the connection between me and the book.\n\n”man-with-a-pencilcase’ – a middle-aged civil servant in the ‘real’ world – had spotted Madeline’s reply and akin to a tom cat spraying the walls in celebration, did the rounds of every film, TV or actor-related Facebook page he could find – claiming that I hadn’t known Peter at all and that my forthcoming book would be a work of fiction. However, when Madeline learned that the author of said tome and the person she’d shared a meal with after Peter’s funeral was one and the same, she posted the following on her own Facebook page:\n\nWhile both Madeline Smith and Gyles Brandreth were both big enough people to acknowledge their mistakes, ‘man-with-a-suitcase’ was not. It’s little wonder that such people choose to conceal themselves behind usernames!\n\nTina\n\nHi Tina,\n\nI’ve been a fan of Peter Wyngarde since I was a teenager. I’m now 68-years-old. I was delighted when I got online and found several websites devoted to him. I eventually joined the Facebook group, Department Wyngarde. I was absolutely horrified back in 2019 when what had otherwise been a reasonably enjoyable gathering of likeminded people was hijacked by vicious, nasty, foul-mouthed yobs who claimed to be Peter’s “true fans”. What that mindless mob of morons said about you and Peter was a disgrace. I left immediately as I didn’t want to be associated with it in any way, shape or form, but not before telling those cretins exactly what I thought of them and their abhorrent behaviour. I was utterly delighted when Facebook decided to remove it from their platform.\n\nI have always lived by a few simple principles, namely: Do not say anything about others that you know is false. Absolutely refuse to let your mind be colonised. The first crazy thing someone asks you to believe or to repeat, refuse. If you can, do so out loud as there is a good chance it will inspire others to speak up, too. If you are a decent person, you know mob justice is never just, so never join a mob. Any mob that comes for someone else will inevitably come for you.\n\nWhat happened back then was a witch-hunt without a witch, and I have only the greatest admiration for the dignified way in which you dealt with the filth that was thrown at you, especially as you were probably at your lowest ebb having only recently lost Peter. The fact that you refused to bow to these bullies and have come out the other side all the stronger is commendable. I am just sorry that it has taken until now for me to get around to contacting you.\n\nWith every best wish to you and Mr Bowington,\n\nRichard D.\n\nP.S. What you’re doing in continuing to promote Peter online and elsewhere is phenomenal.\n\nTina,\n\nWith regard to your book and your decision to donate all royalties to charity: You know that your intentions are honest and good. I know this also. Anyone who believes otherwise should ‘Go forth and multiply!’\n\nIt’s also true that Peter never stopped talking about you whenever I spoke with him on the phone. His love, affection and devotion to you has never been in any doubt in my mind. As you’ve said, the people who know, know. How anyone can feel entitled to an opinion on this matter that doesn’t know you and didn’t know/hadn’t even met Peter, is beyond me! I can imagine in my mind exactly what Peter would be saying about it all!\n\nAdam Coxon (Author/Journalist) – London\n\nHello,\n\nRegarding all the crap about the supposed relationship between Peter Wyngarde and Alan Bates because they shared a flat for a couple of years. Bates also shared a flat with Peter O’Toole for a while. If you want to go down the ‘nudge-nudge, wink-wink’ route, how about Michael Caine and Terrence Stamp. They shared a one bedroomed flat (Ohh-Er!) in London for some time in the1960s and Jude Law and Ewan McGregor were flatmates in the Nineties. I bet if you had the time and could be bothered, you’d find loads of actors that shared accommodation in the early days of their respective careers. All this newspaper gossip is utter nonsense.\n\nBarbara Thompson\n\nHello,\n\nI’ve been fascinated by Peter for years – his look, his style and his amazing voice. What a talent. I’ve just finished reading Tina’s wonderful book, and found it provoked so many emotions; some positive and some less so – sadness and anger mainly, that this towering talent could be denied professional and personal happiness and fulfilment by tiny-minded pedlars of filth and sleaze. What also upsets me is that we were denied the pleasure of seeing him on stage and screen, chewing up scenery and leaving other actors floundering in his wake. God the world was better, more interesting and stylish with him in it. I miss him.\n\nSteve Judge\n\nA talent not to be beaten. Peter Wyngarde was outstanding in all films and television performances.\n\nAndrew Meager\n\nHi Tina,\n\nI’ve just been reading some of the stuff in the ‘Do They Mean Me?’ section and saw the bit about what Rev. Richard Cole had posted about Peter on Twitter.\n\nI recall him bleating away on any and every TV programme that would give him airtime about how he’d suffered unimaginable abuse both on and offline following the death of his partner, David. Like many people I felt genuinely sorry for him but that sympathy has waned since reading how unhesitating he is in spreading malicious gossip about others. Every vicar, including attention-seeking “celebrity” ones should be aware of the advice given in the Bible – James, Chapter 1 – Verse 26: “Those who consider themselves religious and yet do not keep a tight rein on their tongues deceive themselves, and their religion is worthless.”\n\nLes Grant\n\n_____________\n\nHello Les,\n\nAmen to that! Sadly, there’s a lot of people who spend their time slandering and libelling other people with scant regard for the consequences. They tend to hear a piece of gossip and without any consideration as to whether it’s true or not, will repeat it. However, those same individuals will squeal like a stuck pig when they find themselves on the receiving end. I’ve seen it a thousand times over. Sadly, Reverend Coles doesn’t appear willing or able to practice what he preaches.\n\nTina\n\nDear Tina,\n\nVery amazing awesome actor he could play variously any character with Incredible charm and style he reminds me of Peter O’Toole he looks like him as well in the two episodes of The Avengers he starred in he was brilliant.\n\nDanny Paris\n\nDear Tina,\n\nWhen the Saint episode, ‘Epic‘ was filmed, “The Cabinet of Dr Caligari” of which this scene [see right] has distorted perspective elements (as well as a jolly dash of sly anachronistic Hammer Horror panache) was not quite fifty years in the rear-view mirror. Today, The Avengers episode “Epic” is about 55 years old. Tim Burton still mines visual references from “Caligari” in many of his contemporary films, and its expressionistic aesthetic continues to be an essential component of Burton’s gothic vocabulary.\n\nBruce Blakeslee\n\nHi,\n\nI just came across your webpage, I haven’t had time to have a good look just a quick glance as I have to go out. I live in Florida now, I am from the UK and used to see Peter all the time. We used to chat at the local pub and he would bring his Afghan Hound Youseff (not sure of spelling) it was sooo long ago. He was living in a flat at the end of Earls Terrace, W8. I had some other friends in that row of flats. I will have a good look through your page in the next few days,\n\nThanks,\n\nHeather\n\nDear Tina,\n\nFirstly, I wanted to thank you for agreeing to donate a copy of your biography, ‘Peter Wyngarde: A Life Amongst Strangers’ to our film and television archive. It is a valuable addition and gratefully received.\n\nI’ve had the great pleasure of perusing the book myself and I have to say that I’ve never experienced such a vivid account of an actors life before. This could only have been achieved by an author with first-hand experience of her subject, since the elucidation of every moment spent with Wyngarde; the air you shared, the situations, sights, sounds and smells are those of a person with only the most intimate knowledge. I thank you on behalf of every fan for your generosity in sharing his life and career with us.\n\nDr Phil Chapman\n\nDear Tina,\n\nJust a quick note to say that I spent most of the afternoon of today glued to the TV watching the Department S DVD box set! What a pleasure. I’m 61 on Monday and I must confess the nostalgia came flooding back: the clothes, the dialogue, the music, the panache! Didn’t they drink a lot on TV in those days! Well done for managing such an excellent site. I wish you every success and will drop by now and again to say hello. If there are any events coming up in the future which you think might appeal to me then please let me know.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nPaul Williams.\n\nHello Tina,\n\nI just wanted to thank you for sharing some of Peter’s writings with us. It’s been a privilege to have the opportunity to read his own words in his own hand. I wonder how the naysayers and self-appointed authorities on PW’s life will account for this? Will they throw their hands up in the air and admit they got it wrong? Not a chance! I expect they’ll simply carry on regardless, even going so far as to label Peter himself a liar.\n\nKeep up the excellent work Tina, and thank you again for sharing all this wonderful stuff with us.\n\nStefan Robinson, Clifton\n\nHi’ya Tina,\n\nI don’t know if you’ll remember me? You were kind enough to organise an interview with Peter for my journalism degree dissertation, which he was good enough to do free. You were also gracious enough to get all those photos signed for the Guild of Students fundraiser in 1996, which raised over £500 for us back then.\n\nCongrats’n’all that on your book. Maybe we can arrange to meet up to do an interview on it for the ‘paper sometime in the New Year? I’m hoping that I’ll get a copy for Christmas. I’ve certainly dropped enough not-so-subtle hints to deserve one. I can’t tell you how delighted I am that it’s done so well.\n\nLet’s not leave it so long this time.\n\nJames Long\n\n______________________\n\nHello James,\n\nYes. of course I remember you. I recall quite clearly you standing Peter and I a brew in the university food hall.\n\nAn interview sounds good. Maybe if one or other of your relatives have taken the hint and bought you a copy, you’ll be able to tell me what you think. Until then…\n\nTina\n\nDear Tina,\n\nHow fantastic to find that the Hellfire Club is still up and running. Thank you for your unwavering loyalty both to Peter and his fans.\n\nI have been a fan since seeing him way back in the 1960s in Night of the Eagle and followed his career without pause enjoying every performance. Loved him in Jason King even if it was very campy and OTT but what great entertainment just the stuff to blow away all the cares. And how scrumptious he always looked in his flares and furbelows. And that moustache and hairy chest!\n\nOn the serious side I battled my way to the box office to get tickets for ‘The King and I‘ back in 1973 and enjoyed every minute. I even met and spoke with him once. I was on the way to the Odeon cinema Kensington and he was cleaning his Bentley Continental. Beautiful car. I wonder whatever happened to it? He was so sweet and charming when I said “Hello” and mentioned how much I enjoyed his performances. So natural and unaffected. But why did he disappear? I know all about the faux pas but other stars have done worse and are still flaunting their lack of talent all over our screens. Why was Peter been made the whipping boy?\n\nCaught a glimpse of him earlier this year in a programme about screen cads and he looked as gorgeous as ever, even if his head was shaved. But a shaven head did Yul Brynner no harm.\n\nJill Basten\n\n______________________\n\nHello Jill,\n\nThank you for taking the time to contact me.\n\nHow wonderful that you managed to get tickets to see ‘The King and I’ live on stage; the nearest I ever got was seeing a performance on 16mm film!\n\nThe Bentley continental you saw Peter cleaning is still around. He sold it back in the early 1980s, but it’s changed hands several times since then. You can read more about it here.\n\nTina\n\nHello Everyone,\n\nI’m just sending you this e-mail to say how much I enjoyed your Peter Wyngarde web site, although I’m mostly a fan of The Prisoner/Patrick McGoohan,\n\nI can fondly remember Department S , and Jason King from my younger days in the early seventies, my uncle was a dead ringer for Mr Wyngrade and had a large following of female admirers. That period was the golden age of television adventure programmes that could never be repeated, and thanks to the talent of Mr Wyngarde and co, they will go down in history as the best television programmes of their kind.\n\nAlso, you are spot on, as Number Two in The Prisoner episodes was classic, well done.\n\nPeter will always be remembered for his style and elegance, and his fantastic acting ability. As a token of respect, I used to play under the screen name of Jason King72 on theYahoo! pool game web site, and as a consequence, I was hardly ever beaten.\n\nWith Kind Regards,\n\nRobert Goshawk\n\nHello,\n\nI have only discovered Mr. Wyngarde recently, when I watched him as Klytus in Flash Gordon. This may be a little crazy but I would just like to say that I was in complete awe over how amazing and incredible his voice sounded in Flash Gordon. I had chills down my spine every time he spoke on screen. (I wish he could have been in every scene in the movie).\n\nMr. Wyngarde tops my list of having the coolest and most eloquent sounding voices I have ever heard in my life. It is so inspiring. I would die for a voice like his.\n\nSteven Pryce, Albany, Oregon.\n\nHi Tina,\n\nI know this is a very difficult time for you. I really was so sorry when I learned of Peter’s death. I can’t believe he’s been gone for 3 years now.\n\nAs you know, during the ’70s we had a contract to officially open over 30 Woolworth’s newly refurbished stores throughout the UK. Other than my friends and clients, Morecambe & Wise, Peter was the most requested and highest paid celebrity making personal appearances.\n\nPeter was a charmer with the ladies and his appearances on the Woolworths engagements drew in excess of 5,000 screaming ladies. He was an absolute joy to work with and drew massive crowds. We were even turned away from a Woolworths store[1] on one occasion.\n\nThe police said the stores around “Woolies”, in the Arndale Centre, were worried their all-glass frontages might break. On the way there we were stopped by a police car and a lovely police lady said: “Hello, Jason.” (They always called Peter by his TV role name). “I’m sorry but we can’t let you go any further.\n\nPeter asked me: “Dear Boy, will I still get paid?”\n\nTo which I replied, of course you will, and, of course, he did. Woolworth’s said whilst they were sorry not to have had Peter in person the story hit nearly all the front pages of the daily newspapers. They couldn’t have bought that publicity! He was a wonderful gentleman.\n\nPeter was so fortunate to have you by his side for so long, dearest girl, and that you remained by his side right until the end.\n\nHope to see/hear from you again soon.\n\nGresh[2] xxx\n\nClick HERE for ‘Interview with Carl Gresham’.\n\nHello,\n\nThis web site is quite an unexpected but very pleasant find.\n\nI was actually spending the afternoon surfing the web aimlessly while the bosses were on their Christmas holiday… but the find brought an instant ‘hit’ of nostalgia. ‘Jason King’ brings back very fond memories of faining illness to get off school so I could stay at home and watch our (then) brand new colour television. In those days shows like ‘The Persauders’, ‘Randall & Hopkirk’, ‘The Champions’, ‘The Baron’ & ‘Man in a Suitcase’ filled the afternoon ITV schedules…And I loved them.\n\nOf all these ‘Jason King’ seemed to be ahead of it’s time, ‘feeling’ like a cult classic before cult classics were ‘invented’. It’s over the top (in a good way) flavour help make a fantasy world of flimsy TV sets that made me forget school for a while and made me think that there was exciting things going on in the world – if only I had a kipper tie and flairs that contradicted the laws of physics maybe I took could be doing something adventurous too (instead of two sessions of algebra followed by PE)!\n\nIts nice to see the pictures of Jason again – its made my afternoon all warm and smiling.\n\nThanks…\n\nSteven Beat\n\nDear Tina,\n\nI was so sorry to hear of your great loss and wanted to write back then, but at least Peter is now at peace.\n\nYou both have always been in my thoughts and always will be. I will never forget how good you were to my mother when my father died.\n\nMonica Martin\n\nDear Tina,\n\nI am writing to tell you how much I have enjoyed listening to Peter’s album – its great! My son Oliver loves it too. I of course remembered seeing Peter on the telly as Jason King, but did not know he had made a record until Jonathan Ross played the first track on his Saturday show once. I was fascinated and bought the album.\n\nBest Wishes,\n\nGreg Smith\n\nBelow: Morrissey giving Jonathan Ross a copy of Peter’s album on ‘The Jonathan Ross Show’ in 2009.\n\nDear Tina and everyone associated with this wonderful site,\n\nHave an absolutely beautiful Easter. I am a 58-year old woman and have been a fan of Peter’s since I saw the original Department S. I am a very busy legal secretary, so find it difficult to watch things regularly due to work commitments and keeping fit!!, but I have a nice long weekend ahead. Will curl up in my bed with mugs of tea and some treats, oh, and hubby (hee hee), and watch the Jason King box set from start to finish. I can’t wait!!!\n\nOnce again, a very Happy Easter to you all.\n\nWith much love, Sharon\n\nDear Tina,\n\nThe wonderful Mr. Wyngarde scared me to death in that movie “The Innocents” with Deborah Kerr (1961). It is shown on TCM sometimes and is a must-see.\n\nWhat a delightful surprise to learn that Mike Meyers based his character Austin Powers – International Man of Mystery on Mr. Wyngarde. RIP Sir.\n\nCBG\n\nDear Tina\n\nAs a life-long time Avengers fan, I just wanted to send you a note to say how much I’m enjoying this website.\n\n‘Epic‘ was recently on and so was the ‘Checkmate‘ episode of The Prisoner, as well as Peter’s appearance in ‘The Saint‘, on BBC America.\n\nWhile on the phone with my brother, who is also a fan of all three shows, I “Googled” Peter’s name and found your website. Hope life is treating you well. Keep up the great work.\n\nJill B – Phoenix, Arizona\n\nDear Tina,\n\nThis is a wonderful opportunity to finally be able to write to you! I was an ardent fan of Peter’s in my early teens, avidly following the weekly adventures of Jason King on television here in Sydney, Australia. He epitomised the man of my dreams – handsome, romantic, classy, suave and cool! I have had a soft spot for him in my heart ever since, and it has always been a pleasure to see him on the screen in the years since then.\n\nMy heart is like a singing bird\n\nWhose nest is in a watered shoot:\n\nMy heart is like an apple tree\n\nWhose boughs are bent with thickest fruit;\n\nMy heart is like a rainbow shell\n\nThat paddles in a halcyon sea;\n\nMy heart is gladder than all these\n\nBecause my love is come to me.Raise me a dias of silk and down;\n\nHang it with vair and purple dyes;\n\nCarve it in doves and pomegranates,\n\nAnd peacocks with a hundred eyes;\n\nWork it in gold and silver grapes,\n\nIn leaves and silver fleur-de-lys;\n\nBecause the birthday of my life\n\nIs come, my love is come to me.\n\nViki, Sydney, Australia\n\nDear Tina,\n\nI’ve been wanting to write to you for a few weeks but knowing that this month was the third anniversary of Peter Wyngarde’s death, I thought I’d leave it for a couple of weeks.\n\nI know how you must have felt of 15th January seeing people posting tributes to Peter online, but I think you should look at them as a positive thing. So many people on this planet have died and been forgotten. Peter made a real impact on the lives of so many others and it’s a tribute to him that they still remember him, even after three years.\n\nIt is easy to be sad when thinking of lost loved ones, but try to think of his having been here as a positive thing, and how many lives he touched, even indirectly, just by being him. A celebration of his having lived, rather than mourning the fact that he’s died.\n\nSending you all of my best wishes,\n\nGillian Hill, Carlisle\n\nHello,\n\nI’m rapt to find Peter Wyngarde’s official site (and it looks great!), especially since Department S has suddenly appeared on screens down here in New Zealand, and hopefully Jason King won’t be far behind. It’s like finding a hidden treasure, a rediscovery of PW.\n\nI look forward to exploring the sit and reacquainting myself with the coolest dude around.\n\nJustine Webb-Elliot\n\nDear Tina,\n\nUnfortunately I don’t have a Facebook account so I’m unable to join the Official Appreciation Society. Such a pity. I always found Peter to have been the actor who single handedly personified a particular genre of character, television and acting during the 60s and 70s.\n\nHe epitomised the most flamboyant aspects of men’s fashion in the early 70s. By the late 70s however, tough guy cops, racing around after villains set the tone. Therefore, the vastly entertaining and sublimely debonair Peter sadly lost his top spot in the television ratings.\n\nI’m just glad that he quit the booze in the early 80s and went on to live to a ripe old age. A wonderful actor who undoubtedly inspired me to become a closet silk cravat wearer, in later life.\n\nAndrew Reid\n\nHi,\n\nI watched ‘Department S’ and ‘Jason King’ as a lad. My wife and kids have watched ‘Jason King’ on DVD this week. My daughter, Ruth, loves the look, by the way. I always wanted to be The Saint or Jason King, never regarding any of the other superheroes as cool enough, I guess.\n\nThanks for everything. Peter and Roger Moore really will always be the coolest of the 60’s and 70’s TV icons. Best wishes.\n\nBrad Bennett, Worcestershire\n\nDear Tina,\n\nStrictly speaking, Jason King was an early seventies series. But as webmaster of the 1960s British Pop Culture website, I had no reservations about including references to Jason and to Peter Wyngarde on my website. I was delighted in fact and saw it as wholly appropriate because in spirit and in style Jason King was a sixties series.\n\nJason King captured the atmosphere that was prevalent at the end of that golden age. A time just before the 3-day weeks, strikes, power cuts and discontent that were a hallmark of the early seventies and just prior to the relegation of the once glorious Elstree studios to the production of a run of dire seventies comedy films. He was the last of the great ITC shows that have since become cult classics. He was colourful, eccentric, stylish in a seventies garish way! His looks were almost a throw-back to the dandies of days gone by.\n\nThe music was exciting and got my thirteen year-old imagination racing. Jason King was, in retrospect, either a corny sexist or great fun and very sexy depending on your perspective. Mine is strongly with the latter view, not because I personally found him sexy you’ll understand – I was fantasising about Emma Peel and Tara King at the time, but because of the effect he clearly had on a generation of females from Dublin to Dusseldorf.\n\nJason King and Peter Wyngarde were, to the media and fans, interchangeable and the strength of the series was not in the writing or production values but in Peter’s accomplished playing of the role and the clear fact that he was having a great time doing it. He played it with verve and style. Affectionate parodies, such as Harry Enfield’s ‘Jason Queen’, exaggeratedly depict the wobbly sets, dodgy backdrops, unreal car chases, outrageously sexist behaviour and so on, but Jason King was no better or worse than all the other shows you care to mention in this respect. Its strength was Peter. It made him a huge international star, bigger in fact in Europe than at home, and was a fitting apex to a great career. Peter and his alter ego Jason King are perfect examples of the best of British.\n\nDavid Barnes\n\nHello,\n\nThank You! Thank You! Thank You! And finally, Thank You! for giving the fans of Peter Wyngarde the opportunity to see such great photographs. I have been a fan for some time (I am 46) and think his acting is superb – and I was totally amazed when I heard his wonderfully original album (which I got on CD – couldn’t find the LP to save my life!) I was just so delighted to see so much information on your Site. Thank you again for all the great photo’s and information on this excellent and long-overdue site. With very best wishes from Australia.\n\nGlen Vernon, New South Wales.\n\nI’m sorry for my English. I only want to explain my congratulations and my gratefulness for all of moments good in my life when I saw Department S and Jason King. I write since Argentina, and if you can understand Spanish may be explain better my feelings with Peter Wyngarde’s work.\n\nThank You, and more thank you for all of moment.\n\nNéstor García Rosas, Argentina\n\nHi Tina!\n\nPeter Wyngarde is quite simply the most stylishly attired man ever to walk the face of the earth. The cosmic splendour of the wardrobe he deployed to so magnificent an effect in his seminal role of Jason King, should have served as the sartorial template for the remainder of time. Furthermore, he is, to this day, the only man ever to achieve the hitherto impossible task of out-dressing Roger Moore in an episode of The Saint [The Man who Liked Lions]. In a world now overpopulated by light-bulb headed gargoyles and baseball-capped sub-Neanderthals, the stylistic legacy of Peter Wyngarde serves as a powerful reminder of the civilisation that we have lost.\n\nJacko73\n\nHello there,\n\nI really enjoyed my visit to your web site-fantastic stuff.\n\nI’ve been a big fan of Peter Wyngarde since I was a lad watching Department S, a series that still looks stylish today. I shall keep on checking your site for all the latest news. All the best.\n\nJohn Pyroyiannos\n\nDear Tina,\n\nI received my copy of ‘Flash Gordon: The Official Story Of The Film’ yesterday and was absolutely delighted to see that the author had given you the credit you deserve, not just for assisting him with information relating to the film, but moreover for continuing to champion Peter Wyngarde as both an actor and a man. Your generosity in sharing your vast archive and knowledge of the him has not gone unappreciated by his fans.\n\nLong Live The King!\n\nScott Webb\n\nDear Tina,\n\nI’ll never understand why Peter never hit the really big-time, as he certainly of the same acting stature as Peter O’Toole for example, yet has no big blockbuster movies to his name.\n\nPerhaps he made the wrong career choices somewhere along the line,or was given bad advice or whatever, I just don’t know, do you?\n\nPoorOldSpike\n\nHello Tina,\n\nI’m a long-term fan of Peter’s having seen him in`The Prisoner of Zenda’* in around 1966.\n\nI had the great pleasure of seeing him on stage in Wimbledon in a 5Oth. anniversary production of `Dracula‘ in 1974. He was absolutely brilliant! Fabulous special effects, too.\n\nHow sad that we weren’t able to have a Jason King for the new millennium. This is how I saw him: a mature, retired J.K., sitting in an enormous wingback chair in a beautiful book-lined study, brandy globe in hand, open fire, etc., etc., recounting his exploits in flashback. It could’ve opened with Peter saying something like…“Ah, yes…the matter of the Sultans jewels..” then he’d recount a part of the story and cut to the flashback.\n\nWarmest regards to you, Tina, for keeping the flame alive.\n\nAlan McAfee\n\n*The series was actually called ‘Rupert of Hentzau’.\n\nHi,\n\nYour book is still in my mind…I adored Wyngarde then & do to this day…to which end I have purchased box sets of both Department S & Jason King. I am having the most wonderful time reliving those halcyon days of truly entertaining television & really amazing actors & actresses ! Wyngarde was fabulous in every sense of the word & I can never adequately express how much I miss his fantastic personality – he was, without doubt, one of a kind…\n\nWonderful book – thoroughly enjoyable and ultimately very moving – thank you.\n\nCarol Wallage\n\nIn loving memory of Peter xxx\n\nJeanne Perkins, Reading, Berkshire\n\nHi,\n\nSorry to bother you but can you tell me if you are the same Tina who used to run Peter the Great’s fan club yonks ago? I remember sending her Jason King books, DVD covers etc – all of which Peter graciously signed for me, adding my name, which was nice.\n\nAh, great to know. Thanks for getting those items signed 15+ years ago. They all adorn my office walls or bookcases – along with similar items by Roger Moore, Tony Curtis, all the main cast of The Avengers, Ian Ogilvy, John Denver… I’m an ‘anorak’ really. I’ve been a fan of Peter’s since the late 60s. A much better actor than given credit for – his strained performance in Night of The Eagle is majestic! News of his death is a JFK moment for me (as is Roger’s, Tony’s and John’s – but, paradoxically, not JFK’s!). Peter’s passing was so sad. I feel for him and you. I won’t badger you with millions of messages, don’t worry.\n\nRegards,\n\nDerek Stewart. Elgin, Moray\n\n______________\n\nHello Derek,\n\nHow lovely that you should remember me – and you’re not bothering me at all. I do get quite a lot of messages from fans who I’d arranged to have video sleeves and so forth signed by Peter. It’s really nice of you to offer thanks 15+ years on. It makes a change from the kind of psychotic rants and ingratitude that I’ve been faced with from one particular quarter.\n\nTina\n\nDear Tina,\n\nAlways felt a great affection for Peter: loved his Style , the way he looked and acted and the man himself as he embodied in many ways the qualities that I would be very happy to have myself: My father was a Peter Wyngarde admirer too I suspect as he looked very similar and would I know have loved Peter dress sense and style: I know sadness very deep when the loss of a loved one like Peter or my late father has to be endured, It is always with us like a tide that forever washes in over us sometimes and at others recedes a little giving us some relief: My father died in January 40 years ago this year and the hurt has become part of me and I live with it as we all do : I send you best wishes for a peaceful and happy 2022 xx\n\nRuss Adams\n\nHello Tina.\n\nCanada here. We just had Peter’s Prisoner episode on at noon today (02.09.21) in my area. Looked dashing with the scarf and later on doing the thing breaking the stack of wood, whilst squatting on the floor.\n\nDoug Pelton, Toronto\n\n___________________\n\nHello Doug,\n\nIt’s so good to hear from you; hope you’re well. So glad you enjoyed Peter’s Prisoner episode. The last time I saw ‘Checkmate’ was with Peter at the 50th Anniversary event at Portmeirion in September/October 2017. A bitter-sweet memory.\n\nTake Care of yourself.\n\nTina\n\nDear Tina,\n\nI was lucky to meet Peter once. He had pair of gorgeous Afghan Hounds, totally black. They went everywhere with him, even to the theatre. Lovely man.\n\nDorrey Squirrell\n\nHi Tina,\n\nThank you sooooooooooo much for sharing the original, handwritten notes that Peter had made for use in his autobiography. For a life-long fan, it was wonderful to see those times in his life recounted in his own words.\n\nA huge thank you also for your brilliant book. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.\n\nBest Wishes,\n\nEmma Neilson, Sittingbourne\n\nHello Tina,\n\nPeter was my first crush. I absolutely loved him and at 14-year-old, I believed that he was going to whiz me away and marry me.\n\nMargaret Walker\n\nDear Tina,\n\nI met Peter once while shopping in Kensington market, we had quite a chat. I knew that I knew him from somewhere but couldn’t place him. Never occurred to me he was an actor. I assumed we had met at a party or something like that. It wasn’t until later on that day I saw a photo of ‘Jason King’ that I twigged why he was so familiar.\n\nBarbara Wilson\n\nDear Ms. Wyngarde-Hopkins,\n\nWhat an interesting warm site.\n\nThink ‘The Man Who Liked Lions‘ was one of the first TV programmes I saw in colour. I remember it as almost a deep 3D experience, something that I don’t think I ever bettered with any of the new technological toys that have come along in the meantime. There was certainly magic at work down at Elstree in those days and Peter was a chief wizard stirring our thoughts and opening all the dusty doors of our imagination. We were all part of the collective experience then. I have been struggling since to find out what it all means and where we all go now, if in fact we have been anywhere at all?\n\nJack Leigh\n\nDear Tina,\n\nBack in the late 70’s, I was an avid comic book reader (I still am in some cases) and I loved Flash Gordon. So when the trailer came out and I heard those first few words of dialogue, I was captivated by that dialogue, and by the words “An obscure body in the S-K System, Your Majesty. The inhabitants refer to it as the planet… Earth.” Peter Wyngarde had the perfect voice for General Klytus and despite being behind a mask the entire movie, I was still drawn to his character.\n\nThen as I got older, I found Department S videos on Youtube and found Jason King a very interesting character. I followed those as best as I could, until they removed them from the net, but I did get the Jason King set which I am having my own personal tribute watch over the last few days. Then I realized I have several other movies/TV shows of his such as Burn Witch, Burn (Night of the Eagle), Emma Peel Avengers set, both Douglas Wilmer and Jeremy Brett’s Sherlock Holmes’ sets. And on a side note, yes, I did read the Dark Phoenix saga back in the day and only realized later, after it was over, that Jason Wyngarde, and the whole Hellfire Club was based on the Avengers episode “A Touch of Brimstone”. So thank you for keeping all these wonderful films and programmes in the public domain and for being such a great ambassador for Peter Wyngarde.\n\nRuth Horne\n\nTo Whom It May Concern,\n\nI just watched “The Gadic Collection“, great show, loved it, but… writing up a detailed synopsis of everything that happens on screen also seems antithetical to the spirit of the 1960s… Luckily I made sure to watch the show first before reading the spoiler which then seemed totally redundant…\n\nRas Faquade\n\n________________________\n\nDear Ras,\n\nThank you for your comment regarding our review of the Saint episode, ‘The Gadic Collection’.\n\nThe reason that we post reviews/extended story synopsis is because we get a huge number of visitors to our website from every corner of the world, from the Far East to South America, to Lapland and the Iran. Not all of these people have seen these programmes in spite of the fact that they’ve been around since the 1960s, simply because they’ve never been broadcast in their neck of the woods, and/or they have no access to them on DVD/BluRay. These reviews/synopsis are their only means of learning about Peter Wyngarde’s work and have proven to be extremely popular.\n\nWe’re pleased that you enjoyed Peter’s performance in The Gadic Collection and thank you for visiting our website.\n\nWith warmest Best Wishes,\n\nOn behalf of Tina Wyngarde-Hopkins\n\nGreetings Tina,\n\nI have been a fan of Peter for many years and I am currently re-watching ‘Jason King’ from the beginning and also listening to my Peter Wyngarde CD which I bought in Oxford Street about 15 years ago.\n\nI also went to see Peter on stage as a birthday treat in 1983. What a wonderful, multi-talented man he was. You are so fortunate to have known him for so many years. Thank you for being Peter’s true friend and for looking after him. He deserved the best and that was you.\n\nGod bless you Tina and God bless Peter Wyngarde.\n\nDave Hull\n\nDear Tina,\n\nAs a boy I was brought up on Peter. My sisters bedroom wall was covered in his photos. She and her friends from work once telephoned the office up the road from the garage where they worked, asking to speak to the bloke who looks like Jason King. The guy replied, I look like Edward Woodward, will I do!!! We still laugh about that 50 years later. Dear wonderful Peter. What a voice!\n\nAdrian Bird\n\nDear Tina,\n\nI watched Dept S and Jason King as a lad. My wife and kids have watched Jason King on DVD this week. My five year old daughter, Ruth, loves the look, BTW. I always wanted to be The Saint or Jason King, never regarding any of the other superheroes as cool enough, I guess. Thanks for everything. Peter and Roger Moore really will always be the coolest of the 60’s and 70’s TV icons.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nBrad Bennett\n\nDear Tina,\n\nThanks for taking the time to answer my enquiry [see ‘Your Questions Answered‘]\n\nI remember that I liked ‘Epilogue To Capricorn’ and I do remember it being on ITV ln Saturday evenings, and even at the age of eleven I was very, very impressed with Peter. I wonder why I connected Maxine Audley with it? I’m sure she was in another TV show around that time and there was a Voodoo aspect to the storyline. I will have to look Ms. Audley’s television work up.\n\nAnyway, I’m glad Adrienne Corri was in it, as she was always one of my favourite actresses. I think I liked the fact that she came over as a bit of a stronger type of woman. Come to think now, I do have a vague memory of her being in the series.\n\nI wonder if there is any possibility of it ever being released on DVD ?\n\nIt was a long time ago when I watched Peter in this series. I would not like to give the impression though, that I was obsessed with TV at such a young age. We had great television dramas then, but I had a normal healthy childhood full of outdoor activities, like most children of the fifties and sixties.\n\nGosh though I really would love to see Peter and Adrienne Corrie in that series again.\n\nDennis Leary.\n\n______________________\n\nDear Dennis,\n\nAlas, the series will never be available on DVD as it was broadcast live. It’s a shame that such things have been lost by producers with little or no forward thinking.\n\nHi Tina,\n\nFirstly, congratulations on your fabulous book which is a truly stunning tribute to an equally amazing actor. Having worked in the film and theatre profession myself for many years I know that Steven Berkoff, will only lavish praise on a piece of work when it’s richly deserved. He’s not only a great actor but a world renowned author and playwright, so he knows what he’s talking about. To have had him write the afterword for your book was an achievement in itself. To have won his praise was a rare distinction indeed.\n\nKeep up the excellent work and don’t let the imbecilic minority grind you down.\n\nTerence G.\n\nDear Tina,\n\nSince joining your great (Facebook) group, I have been watching more and more of Peter, Department S, Jason King and his cameo in The Two Ronnies, which he played so well, and the same thing struck me when i watched him, how much he was so like the other Peter, O’Toole. After going on the internet I read, and I’m not alone as many other people agree. I would have loved to have seen Peter W. in ‘What’s New Pussycat’ with Peter Sellers , or in O’Toole’s last film, ‘Venus’. Peter Wyngarde stands shoulder to shoulder with the greats, O’Toole, Burton, Finney, Olivier, no question…. God bless him….\n\nShell Armitt\n\nHi Tina,\n\nLike many people I’ve got reminders and bookmarks all over my digital life both on and off the internet. I got hooked on ebay some years ago, had a big buying spree then gradually settled down and instead of buying anything and everything began to for look for things I’m interested in. I get email alerts about many things; books, motorsport memorabilia, and so on and a while ago I got an alert about a DVD box set I’d fancied for a long while. It was Department ‘S’, the TV series that introduced Jason King to the world. Department S was made in 1969 and was produced by ITC, a company founded by TV mogul Lew Grade and the show was the brainchild of Monty Berman and Dennis Spooner who together made a string of action and adventure series in the sixties and seventies like The Saint, Randall and Hopkirk, The Baron, The Champions and a spin off from Department S, Jason King. All these series were shot like feature films on 35mm film and that is the reason why they look shiny and new today, available on DVD box sets.\n\nJason King was played by Peter Wyngarde and he used all his own clothes in his portrayal of the character. In the late sixties and early seventies ties were becoming bigger, trousers and jacket lapels were flaring and Peter Wyngarde brought this all to the TV screen with his characterisation.\n\nI was a school kid in 1969 and we kids all loved Jason King and his flamboyant outfits and we went out of our way to get a giant tie knot, just like the one Jason had in ‘Department S.’ Most of the kids got the big knot by tying their ties way down at the fat end of the tie making their ties short but at least with a big knot. I got some help with my tie from an unexpected source: my Mum!\n\nWe were watching Department S one day and I was wishing out loud for a big fat tie like that and she said to me “You could make one yourself. It’s easy.”\n\n“Easy?” I said. “How?”\n\n“Well, all you need is another tie to go inside the first one and make it bigger.” Sounds good I thought but how do you get one tie inside another? My Mum showed me how with a big safety pin! What you had to do was get your second tie, the one that needs to go inside the other, pin the safety pin to it and then you can thread it through the other one, manipulating it along with the safety pin which you can feel through the material.\n\nI dug out an old tie and threaded it through my school tie, took out the safety pin and then tied my tie in the usual way. Result; one huge knot that Jason King himself would be pleased with.\n\nThe next day I went into school wearing my new fashionable tie and half the school –or so it seemed to me- were stunned by my trendy new school tie. Where did I get it from? How did I get such a knot? Did I tie it in a special way?\n\nI remember once after games, getting changed in the changing rooms and everyone turned to watch as I fastened my tie. There was me, fastening the tie in the mirror with all my school mates watching. I had become a sort of mini school celebrity: The kid with the trendy tie!\n\n“Here it comes,” said someone as I made the final tie of the knot,\n\n“Super knot!”\n\nWell, my fifteen minutes of fame came, went, and vanished as other people worked out how to make their own special ‘super knots.’ Jason King went on to star in his own spin off TV series then he too vanished into TV’s Golden past. Fashion moved on and in the eighties ties went the other way; narrow thin ties were the norm. Trousers lost their flares, jacket lapels slimmed down once again. ‘Penny round’ shirts were forgotten but then, that’s the great thing about DVDs: pop your disc into the machine and you can experience it all again!\n\nT.J. Denny\n\nDear Madam,\n\nI’ve been watching the re-broadcast of Department S on London Live which brought back such amazing memories from my youth, when every male in the city seemed to look like Jason King. Seeing the series again prompted me to look online to see what I could find about Peter Wyngarde which was when I came across this fabulous website. It’s an absolute goldmine of information and a credit to all those involved. Just like Arnie Schwarzenegger, I’ll be back.\n\nYours,\n\nFrank Webb\n\nGreetings, peace and love,\n\nI came across ‘Jason King’ in researching what English shows were broadcast in the Ethiopian Empire 1964-74. The shows qualifies as Selassiedelic. I am certain the Emperor would never approve of anything promoting twisted instincts or morality. I was hoping to find a site like yours to set the record straight after I read the predictable mess of lies on English Wikipedia, my hat is off to you and rest assured you will expose those liars in the long run!\n\nRas Feqade\n\nDear Tina,\n\nI’ve just read the latest piece on the Thoughts of Peter page about so-called Cancel Culture and some of the morons that have infested the Internet. The types you refer to are like spoiled children having a tantrum. They crave attention and demand they get it. As someone so rightly put it recently, the village idiot has gone global.\n\nBest wishes to you and thanks for this amazing website.\n\nNat Jacobs\n\nDear Tina,\n\nThank you for signing my copy of your book.\n\nAs usual I read the back first, then the beginning, then the sections in between and then start to finish. It is one of the best biographies I’ve ever read.\n\nJust a few items you might find of interest. Colchester Reparatory Theatre (Albert Hall) where Peter began his career has for many years been the Co-op bank. The theatre group itself became the Mercury Theatre which was founded by Anthony Quayle. I saw Peter there 3 times with Desmond, my brother.\n\nI once spotted Peter driving out of ABPC Borehamwood which was near where I lived, driving his Bentley Continental with his Afghan Hound. I also saw him at the Odeon Cinema in St. Martins Lane, smoking those large Sobranie cocktail cigarettes. Latterly, I saw him in The King and I, which was a great show, and we – my brother and I – managed to get free tickets to The Russell Harty Show. Sadly, the interview itself was pre-recorded.\n\nPeter had some great cars, such as a TVR (I also had one). It was of some interest to me to know that he’d once owned a Bristol. My brother and I knew Anthony Crook, who was a part owner of the company, very well. Anthony was a well known Formula 2 racing driver. We had some scary test drives with him in Bristols.\n\nI have bought the Jason King box set (the complete series). I’m watching disc 5 at the moment.\n\nThanks again for writing such a great biography.\n\nBest Wishes,\n\nDavid Glennon\n\nDear Tina and everyone associated with this wonderful site,\n\nHave an absolutely beautiful Christmas. I am a 58-year-old woman and have been a fan of Peter’s since I saw the original Department S. I recently bought the DVD box set of the series. Although I am a very busy legal secretary and find it difficult to watch things regularly due to work, there is a nice long weekend ahead, so I will curl up in my bed with mugs of tea and some treats, oh, and hubby (hee hee) and watch Peter for 28, long glorious hours – I can’t wait!!!\n\nOnce again, a very Happy Christmas to you all. With love,\n\nSharon Worsley\n\nBy the way – I once wrote to Peter and he sent me a gorgeous Christmas greeting – I love this site – keep up the fantastic work. xxx\n\nTHOUGHTS ON… ‘Peter Wyngarde: A Life Amongst Strangers’\n\nRegarding the embittered prat who stated that you’d spent all of the first half of your book trying to convince its readers that Peter Wyngarde wasn’t gay: Why doesn’t he write a book himself, in which he can provide evidence to the contrary?\n\nIt’s a wonderful book I enjoyed it very much. Peter was my dear late mom’s favourite actor. She absolutely loved him!\n\nKathy Richards\n\nHi Tina,\n\nI find the discussion here about your book and the halfwits (almost entirely men I notice), who wouldn’t know the difference between their asses and their elbows, fascinating.\n\nI personally recall reading some months prior to your book being published a conversation on a ‘Minder’ forum between three men(!) as to what the content of your book would actually be. By the end of their pow-wow they’d decided in their tiny, tiny minds what would be said and how. I recall one of them saying that you would attempt to deny that Peter had been arrested on 2 separate occasions for importuning. As has since been established, one of these incidents has been found to be disinformation concocted and hosted (and since removed) by Wikipedia[1]. It just goes to show how willing the braindead are to believe any amount of uncorroborated information posted by a faceless entity with no qualification to comment, while ridiculing and discounting someone who actually knew the personality they’re discussing. It beggars belief!\n\nAs someone else has already highlighted here, these people have become so resolute in the beliefs they’ve defended so garishly and for so long that they dare not back down or even consider the possibility they might actually be wrong. It goes without saying that each of these men were concealing themselves behind usernames, such was their unshakable belief in the claims they were making. Speaks volumes!\n\nI also remember one of their number quite categorically stating that, in a previous life, you’d been Peter’s “housekeeper” which was, allegedly, how you’d met him. Where in the name of God do they get this stuff from?\n\nAnyway, back in the real world. Congratulations on the success of said book and kudos for standing up to the bullies in doggedly fighting to right the wrongs that were done to Peter during his lifetime.\n\nBrian Gough\n\n[1]: Read more about this here.\n\nDear Tina,\n\nThe three men described by Brian Gough [see email above] sound like a bunch of muckraking old battleaxes at a bus stop. In the auld days they’d stand on the dust bin to gossip with the neighbour over the back yard wall. Now they gather on social media and Cult TV forums. Evolutionary psychologist Robin Dunbar compared gossiping to the grooming primates engage in as a means of bonding, but these days instead of picking fleas off each other they bitch about people they don’t know and have never met on social media. Bet the moment they’d finished with you and Peter they were each off to another habitat to get their claws into some other poor bugger (and doubtless each other as soon as their respective backs were turned!).\n\nSuch people are small fry; gutless, lightweight mediocrities whose only means of making themselves feel superior is to drag others down to their level.
