        "text": "On May 22nd, 2019 the World of Entertainment paid their respects to Sir Laurence Olivier on his one hundred and twenty-third birthday.\n\nFor years, as I was growing up, with my parents, I became interested in the Motion Picture Industry and the great films that came out of Hollywood and those of England and Europe.\n\nIn 1939 ( I was only nine years old) “Wuthering Heights” was made. When I was eighteen, I was just going into the Drama Department at Los Angeles City and State College, and our Dean Jerry Blunt was a film buff. He introduced us to numerous actors and actress, especially those from England. One of them was Laurence Olivier. He spoke about his great performances, both on the stage and in the films. Blunt spoke about Olivier’s first major film, “Wuthering Heights,” that also starred Meryl Oberon and David Niven.\n\nOlivier received four Academy Awards: an honorary award for Henry V (1947), a Best Actor award and one as producer for Hamlet (1948), and a second honorary award in 1979 to recognise his lifetime of contribution to the art of film. He was nominated for Best Actor for “Wuthering Heights”, the 1940 production of “Rebecca”, “Richard III”, “The Entertainer”, “Othello”, “Slueth”, “Marathon Man” and “The Boys From Brazil”.\n\nOlivier received at total of thirteen Academy Award nominations, not to mention the numerous Awards and nominations from B.A.F.T.A\n\nIn the years that followed, I think I saw most of his films and several of his plays in England, including the Wild Butler in “A Flea in Her Ear” and most importantly, “The Merchant of Venice”. In 1973, my wife, Carolyn and I were invited to attend the opening by Jonathan Miller, the director of this stunning production, brought up to date to the late 1800’s. We even had the pleasure of being taken to Olivier’s dressing room by Mr.Miller after the play and had a most memorable chat with one of our greatest living actors of that time.\n\nGoing back to “Wuthering Heights”, I must have seen this classic films four or five times in the following years, but it wasn’t until 1971, that one of our Movie Channel’s was running “Wuthering Heights” all week long and I found myself glued to my set.\n\nI found myself compelled to write to Sir Laurence, not knowing if my letter, which I sent to him at the National Theatre in London would get to him, and that his brilliant, and yes, even evil performance, will long be remembered. Needless to say, I was stunned and lost for words, when I received this charming and rather unique note from Sir Laurence Oliver dated October 11th, 1971, that I wanted to share with you.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nBudd Burton Moss\n\nLASSO-ED AGAIN? — (via Deadline) Ted Lasso fans, this is not a drill. In a major step toward the long-awaited fourth season of Apple TV+’s hugely popular soccer comedy, the series’ studio Warner Bros. Television has picked up the options on the three original cast members who had been contracted under the aegis of the UK acting union Equity, sources tell Deadline. They are Hannah Waddingham, who plays AFC Richmond owner Rebecca Walton, Brett Goldstein, who plays hardman Roy Kent and Jeremy Swift, who plays Director of Football Operations Leslie Higgins.\n\nAfter securing the trio, the studio is expected to start reaching out to Ted Lasso cast members with SAG-AFTRA contracts whose options had expired, so they will need to make new deals, we hear. In addition to co-creators/executive producers Jason Sudeikis (Ted Lasso) and Brendan Hunt (Coach Beard), that is believed to include Juno Temple (Keeley Jones). We hear one of the Ted Lasso OGs, Phil Dunster (Jamie Tart), has not been picked up, presumably due to a conflict with another series; he is on both Prime Video’s The Devil’s Hour and Apple’s Surface.\n\nIt is unclear which other stars may be approached about Season 4; the cast have all said repeatedly that they would be happy to reprise their roles if an opportunity arises. Many would likely pop in for guest appearances.\n\nGetting the cast back paves the way toward a Season 4 green light, contingent on budget approval and scheduling as actors whose options have lapsed may have joined other series that have them in first position, sources said.\n\nWhile the outreach to the cast is underway, early preparations are also being made to open a writers room. If all elements come together, we hear production on a fourth season is eyeing an early 2025 start. Reps for WBTV and Apple TV+ declined comment.\n\nStarting the process for a Season 4 greenlight indicates that the main Ted Lasso driving force on and off-screen, Sudeikis, is on board for a new installment as the studio would not have proceeded without his consent.\n\nThe fate of Ted Lasso has always hinged on Sudeikis, who’d originated the character in NBC Sports videos. While being open that they would love to extend Ted Lasso, one of the biggest and most acclaimed comedies of the past decade, Apple and Warner Bros. executives have made it clear that it would be up to Sudeikis whether the show would continue.\n\nThe Saturday Night Live alum, who co-created Ted Lasso with Hunt, Joe Kelly and Bill Lawrence, had originally conceived the comedy as a three-season story arc and he stuck with the plan despite the series’ enormous success. But he had not shut the door to more Ted Lasso — which is why Season 3 was not labeled as final — contingent on finding the right idea. Much to Ted Lasso fans’ delight, more than a year after the Season 3 finale, it looks like that has happened.\n\nWith its uplifting tone and a good-natured, eternal optimist lead character, Ted Lasso was the perfect show to launch at the height of the pandemic in August 2020. The comedy became an instant global hit and Apple’s signature and most-watched ever original series.\n\nIn addition to its immense popularity that catapulted it into the pop culture zeitgeist, Ted Lasso earned 13 Emmy Awards during its original three-season run, including two back-to-back Outstanding Comedy Series trophies and acting wins for Sudeikis (2), Goldstein (2), who is also a writer-producer on the show, and Waddingham.\n\nThe May 2023 Season 3 finale saw Keeley and Rebecca potentially partnering for a new venture, AFC Richmond Women’s Team, with all the main characters main characters getting a happy ending, including Ted, last seen coaching his son on a soccer field in Kansas.\n\nInteresting to say the least. The question is and has always been, could they again capture what made the first-run of the show, so successful? I personally was happy with the resolution, although many were not. It’d be a major payday for everyone involved, so that’s a major consideration for everyone. Stay tuned.\n\nDREW’S BLUES — (Via Deadline) As she prepares to get back to her studio couch, Drew Barrymore plans to give her guests a little more space going forward.\n\nFollowing The Drew Barrymore Show’s renewal for seasons 6 and 7, the actress and talk show host explained why she tends to get literally up-close and personal with her subjects on the syndicated CBS morning show.\n\n“Well, I’ll try to practice physical distance, which is not my strong point,” Barrymore said on Entertainment Tonight. “Do you know how hard the pandemic was for me? I was alone in a studio by myself! I like to be around people!”\n\nShe acknowledged that her indifference toward personal space is “not everyone’s favorite but I’m sorry to those people!”\n\n“I think that, first of all, we’re always gonna be big on joy and laughter and feeling good, and that was something I always wanted to do,” explained Barrymore. “But I never thought we would launch in a pandemic, and trying to lean into the joy and the feel good and the comedy at that time was real weird and wacky.”\n\n“Drew is a one-of-a-kind talent who is an integral part of the CBS and Paramount family,” said Wendy McMahon, president and CEO of CBS News and Stations and CBS Media Ventures. “This early renewal and upgrades are a testament to our commitment to The Drew Barrymore Show and its loyal audience, who tune in every day to see Drew’s warmth, inquisitiveness and spontaneity.”\n\nThis fall, The Drew Barrymore Show moves to upgraded time slots on CBS stations in six markets, including five of the top 10 markets. Meanwhile, the show is averaging 1.1 million viewers, with nearly 6 billion minutes watched this season, according to CBS.\n\nI’m a fan, but I don’t often watch her show. I watched it when I was sequestered at home, but found it somewhat off-putting. The current 9:30 AM ET slot was kind of awkward too. There was alto of talk about the show being canceled, so this is manna from heaven.\n\nSHORT TAKES — Our old Friend Marcus Linail (ML Presents) is currently featuring a Coldplay-tribute band. Why not? Marcus ran NYC’s The Canal Room and Shine – both much missed and has worked for years with the tribute band Jessie’s Girl – who are phenomenal. Check out his productions at https://www.mlpresents.com/ …\n\nKjersti Long’s about-to-be-staged play in London has undergone a name change, to Little Piece Of You. More to follow on this one, including who will be the star of the show, which will be a mind-blower. We heard it and could not believe it … Now here’s something I’d really love to read: You can read about Peter and all the Monkees, plus all your teen idols in my memoir: “Meow! My Groovy Life with Tiger Beat’s Teen Idols,” you can grab an e-book or paperback at Amazon.com or an autographed copy at my website:annmoses.com …\n\nHad occasion to listen to Robin Trower’s magnificent “Bridge Of Sighs” from 1974. My God, it sounded as good as ever. Jim Dewar’s vocals just mesmerize. The Bride Of Sighs is in Venice and was the last thing the convicts of the day saw before their death. What a song. Take a listen\n\nAre Oasis re-uniting after a 15-year split? “Wonderwall” remains a stone-cold classic. Check this piece out from Deadline: https://deadline.com/2024/08/liam-gallagher-appears-to-confirm-oasis-reunion-15-years-after-warring-brothers-split-1236049824/ … Micky Dolenz admitted on his weekend interview with Cousin Brucie on WABC, that being a DJ on CBS-FM back in 2005, was a difficult one in that getting up at 3:00 AM was often difficult as being on rock and roll time, he’d be going to sleep then. Great interview and don’t forget Dolenz will be at Flagsataff/Westbury Music Fair on December 14 … Jeff Lynne and his re-configured ELO opened their 31-date Over and Out Tour over the weekend in Palm Desert, CA. He’s one of my all-time faves but from the videos I saw, it looked a tad shaky. It’s essentially the same band he’s had in previous tours and while they’re good, they’re almost a little too slick. Hope to catch them at MSG next month …\n\nAnd, CBS News Radio -just shy of 60 years on air- officially signs off tonight. Sad for sure.\n\nNAMES IN THE NEWS — Vito Bruno; Toby Mamis; Chuck Pulin; Paul Undersinger; Mark Bego; Tom & Lisa Cuddy; Lillian Roxon; Jane Blunkell; Debbie Gibson; Heather Moore; Liz Skollar; Van Dean; Mark Berry; Lon Van Eaton; Steve Plotnicki; Manny Bella; Carol Ross; Tommy James; Dan Zelinski; Peter Shendell; Randy Alexander; Lee Jeske; Steve Walter; Barry Fisch; Eppy; Amanda Naylor; Zach Martin; Race Taylor; Joe Bonadonna; and BELLA!\n\nImages on this page have been licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license.\n\nThe first time I heard of Cirque du Soleil was over thirty years ago when a tent went up in, I think, Santa Monica. It was the talk of the town, and everyone was doing whatever they could to get a seat inside that colorful tent. There was a long-hair flying man, swinging and soaring his muscular frame over our heads on long strips of silk hanging down from the center of that round stage, and he was an overnight sensation in an entertainment town that was filled to overflowing with celebrities. It was an exciting import from Montreal, and I was hooked.\n\nI saw a few more shows, over the years, in tents set up in Battery Park and in a couple of Las Vegas casinos when my friends gathered together to celebrate my 40th birthday. The shows were always something to celebrate and get excited about. Cirque du Soleil’s Ovo is no different in that respect. This show, first premiering in Montréal in April 2009 and has toured more than 30 cities in 6 different countries as a Big Top show before transforming into an arena show in 2016, has popped itself up on Long Island at the UBS Arena in Elmont, NY, and although I was very much missing the iconic tent that usually houses these spectaculars, the arena had everything we could have hoped for, including the easiest commute from New York City\n\nI was curious but not bubbling over with excitement like I had been before when I attended a Cirque du Soleil show, but what made this special is that my plus one was someone who had never seen one of the many Cirque du Soleil shows that seem to travel themselves all over North America and the World. It was hard to believe that I found a circus virgin, but it certainly made the event far more special.\n\nThe show starts with a gigantic Egg on stage, huge and obscuring much of the performance space from view. The mysterious object from the outside world is an inexplicable enigma in the eyes of the insects (and a nod to the monolith from the Kubrick film 2001) that disappears in f a flash, wowing the child within and those around me. Ovo, in a way, feels like a show aimed more towards children than adults. And there were numerous families seated all around us eating up every moment of this colorful insect-themed extravaganza. One young boy, seated somewhere behind me, fell in love with the word “color” and proceeded to, adoringly, say the word every time something amazed his eyes. The sentiment was infectious to the two of us, taking in his amazement and shifting our focus on the clowning aspect of the show that, to be honest, always wore me out a bit. I was there for the thrilling aerial and gymnastic displays, but this youngster added a different lens that enhanced the experience, more than I think I even realized at the time.\n\nThe show is a bit more straightforward than many, trying a bit less to impose a more mystical narrative on the in-between moments. And even as it played up some pretty heteronormative acts of courtship and attraction between some goofy creatures and a large leg, the clowning seemed cute and harmless, albeit a tad pedestrian. Part of me wanted something more fascinating than a sassy simplistic ladybird playing hard to get, but it was hypnotizing these kids all around me, as it was intended.\n\nWith an army of grasshoppers and ants, dressed exotically in costumes by Liz Vandal, working hard as a totally efficient team of workers, the acts come, one after the other, forming circus moments that are meant to amaze and fill us with awe. The number of times the crowd gasped with wonder was uncountable, yet I always wonder, when watching a Cirque du Soleil show, whether we are actually cheering for the hardest or most difficult moments. Or are we just clapping for the ones that ‘seem’ the most difficult and sensational? I’d love to ask the performers, wondering if they might point out different, more complex moments in their acts that seem less difficult from the outside looking in, but are in fact very difficult and completely complex.\n\nIn OVO, spiders swing through the air with the greatest of ease against a spectacularly designed backdrop filled with organic images and ever-evolving scenarios designed magically by Gringo Cardia with superb lighting by Eric Champoux, giving us stunning moments of creativity and dexterity that ignite our senses and wonderment. Cocoons unveil majestic butterflies, and scarabs fling themselves through the air. Creatures bounce themselves off walls returning to solid perpendicular structures that seem to be on different planes, defying gravity and our sense of balance. Other insects; butterflies and spiders, spring up from below, twisting themselves into positions on top of a climbing twisting framework of forms, or on a grey rock that excites the crickets, but causes my back to hurt. They throw themselves and others through the air, daring us to imagine the impossible by tumbling and flipping like bouncing fleas in somersaults that astound.\n\nDirected by Brazilian choreographer, Deborah Coker, the parade of carnival athletics is more physical than contemporary dance, with a vocal performance that floats in and out beautifully, but not as often as I remember from other shows. OVO is a family-friendly astonishment, worthy of the wonderment of all the children that sat hypnotized by the acts of flexible courageous acrobatics, athleticism, and agility. If I hadn’t been with a newbie to Cirque du Soleil, or been surrounded by amazed (and well-behaved) children, I’m not sure I would have been as engaged as I was. I think I was spoiled when I saw “O” in Las Vegas, which I think was by far the most magical of Cirque du Soleil shows that I have seen. And although I missed the colorful tent experience, OVO was a spectacular worthy of the LIRR ride from Grand Central Station.\n\nFor more go to frontmezzjunkies.com\n\nMEGALOPOLIS SCREW-UP — (from Variety) “Lionsgate is immediately recalling our trailer for ‘Megalopolis,’” a Lionsgate spokesperson said in a statement provided to Variety. “We offer our sincere apologies to the critics involved and to Francis Ford Coppola and American Zoetrope for this inexcusable error in our vettingprocess. We screwed up. We are sorry.”\n\nThe trailer, released on Wednesday morning, aimed to position Coppola’s latest film as a work of art that would withstand the test of time, much like his previous masterpieces “The Godfather” and “Apocalypse Now.”\n\nThe video included several quotes from critics panning Coppola’s previous work — but none of the phrases, attributed to the likes of Roger Ebert and Pauline Kael, could be found in any of their reviews.\n\nVariety‘s Owen Gleiberman was incorrectly cited as calling the 1992 film “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” “a beautiful mess” and highlighting its “absurdity” when he reviewed the film for Entertainment Weekly, where he worked at the time of its release.\n\n“Even if you’re one of those people who don’t like critics, we hardly deserve to have words put in our mouths. Then again, the trivial scandal of all this is that the whole ‘Megalopolis’ trailer is built on a false narrative,” Gleiberman said of the trailer’s falsified quotes. “Critics loved ‘The Godfather.’ And though ‘Apocalypse Now’ was divisive, it received a lot of crucial critical support. As far as me calling ‘Bram Stoker’s Dracula’ ‘a beautiful mess,’ I only wish I’d said that! Regarding that film, it now sounds kind.”\n\nIt’s not clear where most of the quotes featured in the trailer came from — with the exception of Roger Ebert’s comment, “a triumph of style over substance,” which was actually pulled from his 1989 review of “Batman,” and not about “Dracula,” as indicated in the trailer.\n\nThe trailer snafu is the latest in a string of scandals befalling the $120 million production, which Coppola financed entirely himself. Last month, Variety exclusively obtained video depicting Coppola trying to kiss young female extras on the set of the project, as additional crew members detailed his unprofessional behavior during production.”\n\nHere’s the trailer –\n\nSHORT TAKES — U2 are releasing a film of their Sphere residency.
