        "text": "Does your surname have a noble air about it? Perhaps there's family lore passed down generations that has led you to wonder whether you may be related to royalty or nobility. Perhaps scurrilous rumours of an illegitimate child born out of wedlock in a courtly scandal need proving, or the story of a Lord stripped of his title and land following a failed coup d'etat piques your interest... At one time or another, many of us have wished that we'd be next in the line of succession.\n\nWhat are the chances of having royalty in your ancestry? Are the family stories anything more than hand-me-down tall tales? Now, you may not be the direct relative of Prince William or Prince Harry, but that doesn't mean that there's not a surprising connection to be found. You just need to make the discoveries to prove it. With millions of genealogy records and a handy family tree builder, Findmypast can help.\n\nCould your name connect you to royalty?\n\nLike kings and queens, surname origins and family history research go hand-in-hand. But how much could your name reveal about the potential of having a royal link in your family tree? Quite a bit, if these famous faces are anything to go by.\n\nBoris Johnson uncovered a family link to King George II on Who Do You Think You Are?. As the 154th most common name in the world, there’s every chance there could be a Johnson on your family tree. If there is, get digging for those royal roots.\n\nBoris Johnson is related to another former British Prime Minister, David Cameron, through the same illegitimate lines to George II. This makes them distant cousins and puts the Cameron surname in contention for having regal heritage.\n\nBorn Diana Spencer, Princess Diana had links to the monarchy long before she married into the British Royal Family. She is descended from Henry Fitzroy and Charles Lennox, two of King Charles II's illegitimate children. Are there Spencer branches on your family tree that could unlock a royal chapter of your family story?\n\nCockney geezer Danny Dyer unearthed his royal roots during an infamous episode of Who Do You Think You Are? Much to the actor’s amazement, he’s a direct descendant of King Edward III. If this doesn’t prove that everyone could have a royal hiding in their heritage, we don’t know what will.\n\nMeghan Markle, Winston Churchill and Hilary Duff are among a host of well-known names with connections to Robert the Bruce, who reigned as King of Scotland in the 1300s. If any of their surnames show up on your family tree, it’s worth some further investigation to see if you can discover royal bloodlines.\n\nTo delve even deeper into royal genealogy, why not explore King Charles III's family tree for yourself? From the late Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Edward, the Duke of Wessex to Prince Harry and Prince George of Wales, there are so many fascinating figures and stories to discover.\n\nRegal lineage: how common is it to be descended from royalty?\n\nWith at least 40 bastards born within the royal family between the 11th and 15th centuries, Who Do You Think You Are?
