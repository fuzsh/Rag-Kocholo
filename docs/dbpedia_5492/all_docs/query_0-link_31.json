        "text": "Dave Robson 0:00\n\nracter The subject is Richard Marden, documentary and Feature Film Editor. He has also worked in sound department interviewed by John Legard, the date is 17 to January 1996. This is side one, and it's file number 361.\n\nAlan Legard 0:29\n\nDick. Now, perhaps you could start off by telling us a little bit about your very early life all your focus and your childhood. Assume so on.\n\nRichard Marden 0:37\n\nYes, well, my parents basically came from the West Country, my father worked the GEC and he was a factory manager in a glassworks, basically at Wembley where there was a big glassworks. There was another one up in Newcastle and some other ones and Hammersmith and Charlton. And he used to really work around those. And I went to first of all to school. School actually went to Grammar School for Girls, and I was in the kindergarten Oh, yes, I started school like that. And the girl yeah, I started kindergarten, I don't think I learned anything. And then I was taken away, I went to a private school called King school Harrow which eventually turned out to be my prep school. Because when I was about 13, I found that also having discovered that really wasn't learning anything very well took me away from that. And I went to high gates, where I stayed until I was eighteen fairly interested in films, goes back a very long way. Because when I was about four or five, I was given the little magic lantern, which had little Disney lantern slides and so on, my brother was given the hand turn cinematograph, my brother is five years older now. And it performed the Cinematic Arts who bought a toy shop and the film that to use the bits of 35 mil that you could also buy in the toy shop. Really, it was quite, it had nothing other than the fact that you turned the handle, you had a little that, I think, four volt bulb or something, you could project it onto this wall. And the fascinating thing was it moved. And my lanten slide didn't. But I was fascinated by the fact of, I suppose, storytelling in somewhere and I didn't understand that at the time. And one day, the cinematograph broke out and my brother was a bit upset I was more upset than he was. And I caught my father saying to him, if you're a very good boy, I'll give you a pathescope, which was a 9.5 patheescope projector for your birthday. Now I knew George wouldn't be interested because he got out with he's got to have a railway track. So I got hold of pa and said if I'm a very good boy, could I have a projector for my birthday and he saidmwe willl see somewhere around about the age of five or six. I was given this little pathe scope kid bantam projector which showed 60 feet and 30 foot cassettes. I can't think they will call cassettes or charges as we call them, I think or whatever they were of little excerpts of Chaplin films, all sorts of films from all over mostly European classics, which have been edited down. Also, you could buy a few per attachment, which meant that you could run 300 foot and 200 foot rolls. So that meant that you were then able to get hold of longer films, which you could if you join the library and I joined much later Wallace Heaton library in Bond Street.\n\nAlan Legard 3:53\n\nThere was also another very good library provided pathescope film call the amateur cine service, down in Bromley\n\nRichard Marden 4:00\n\nThat's right. Yes. And for\n\nAlan Legard 4:01\n\n44 Wigmore road Bromley Kent,\n\nRichard Marden 4:04\n\nand another one that was called the Laurel film services somewhere in Cranford, I think if I remember right there, I heard it. somewhere. From we're about about seven, I met up with my oldest friend who been assessing, John knows you may Godfrey Jenice. And we've been great friends ever since that time, we're just about 19 35. And we discovered that he also had a pathescope kid. We also discovered over a period of time we acquired the he discovered the fact that we botht had toy theatres. And gradually this whole thing built up into an obsession in a way\n\nwith movies, our hobby\n\nshows and anything to slightly to the despair of my father and mother because that was that because my father who was very good man but he thought Had no connection to the film world and thought it was rather fast. And he was a scientfic frame of mind, but much more of a third and I went into some sort of other profession. But I used to pop him off by saying I did want to get into movies. But I wanted to get to the scientific side, the labs, which had been learned tension during at all. And so but after, but I came to leave school at the age of 18 it became apparent that there's nothing for prposition to get in the film industry. And\n\nAlan Legard 5:35\n\nwe're talking about 1946. Yeah, still go back. Certainly. I mean, you you're obviously mad keen on Pathescope and all that. But did you have the opportunity to go to the pictures? from time to time\n\nRichard Marden 5:46\n\nYes. Because what happened was that my parents like, liked the cinema, they were interested in thing, but they rather took care of what one went to see because those days you know parents were by the state. And so, one was usually taken to see something which had some relevance perhaps one set of Rhodes of Africa Clive of India. The sort of move is the Great Barrier. Things which brought thyings like that one could also choose because I seem to remember that, I think it was in 1936, when George The fifth died by mother said she thought she would take my brother and I to see the lying in state, which neither of us particularly wanted to do. And George particularly wanted to go and see a film called The Crusaders, or ethic or the crusades, which was on in Harrow. And my mother being a very kind woman gave it an age we never thought I had many ways,\n\nAlan Legard 6:48\n\nanother marvellous film, children, and those days, I'm been taking the sequel, the lives of Bengal Lancers\n\nRichard Marden 6:53\n\nOh, yes, indeed. That was that was another very good movie. Yeah. So those sorts of movies, and they, there was the time when Snow White came out, which it ran at the new gallery. Yeah. And I, my father used to work sort of five and a half days, he had Saturday afternoon off, and I remember him coming home one day, and then we're all going up to town to see Snow Whote . And of course, the days when you had continuous performances, and I should never forget arrive getting wherever we were in the cinema. And looking at the screen just as the Wicked Witch was taking the poisoned apple out of the cold room, and all the liquid ran off it and formed skulls down. And then I think she kept some spider skeleton on the go. Oh, very impressive. And they've run There's wonderful things that one remembers as a child and never forget.\n\nAlan Legard 7:50\n\nindelibly Ah,\n\nRichard Marden 7:52\n\nanother thing. There was a film of Scrooge with Sir Seymour Hicks. And I remember only to a must have I can't remember how old I would have been. Any have been about five? I think I would I was doing seeing it, I don't know. But it had two images, one, a close up of a bell on a sprung Bell, who knows, like servants Bell, which started to ring , for no reason was the ability, presumably one of the ghosts of Christmas, past, present or future. And the other was, must have been doing the ghost of Christmas yet to come. And I ones memory plays tricks on these things. But I remember a shot of a gravestone with a shadow of a finger pointing presumably to Ebenezer Scrooge. And I think both these things gave me nightmares. I can't remember anything else about the film. Except that it was was a cinema called the Wembley Hall, which was one of the earliest cinemas in Wembley, if not the earliest, which had I think been built in the 20s had been converted to sound. And don'tknow whole story here, except that it was the only cinema I've ever been into they've had back projection. Because as it fronted on to the main high street there was no room to put projectors there. So the projectors were at the back at right angles to screen that went through a prism. And so the screen was not that big. But, but that's . If you were coming down from the street. You know, where the high street is. There a Methodist Church on the corner. Whenever you come down from King Edward VII Park, go straight down to the high street turn left into the high street, and it was on the right hand side. of The road because at the bottom of that street, where we tend to hide used to be the majestic. Now, if you if instead of going to the majestic, turn to your left and right, walked about another 150 yards up the street on the right was the Wembley Hall was run by two ladies, the Mrs Thompson's. A lot of useless information. So that memory was that then the first film I ever saw was at the majestic, and it was called Skippy. And it had I think Jackie Coogan, or Jackie Cooper, and I remember only one vague memory of it. And I can't put it in better context, except it was either Jackie Coogan or whoever it was as a little boy of about four or five, playing in a street with a ball and the ball went out into the streets. And there was a lady in a long coat and possibly a cloth hat I can't . Remember? I can't remember what hat I can only assume that remember it because it must have been dramatic. And I assume that maybe he nearly got run over. But I don't know because that's the only image I've got\n\nAlan Legard 11:31\n\n1931 Paramount Skippy, and directed by Norma Turog\n\nRichard Marden 11:38\n\nwritten by Joe Mankewich\n\nAlan Legard 11:39\n\nby Jor Mankewich Jackie Cooper, Robert Coburn Mitzi Green Jeffrey Soames Willard Robert.\n\nRichard Marden 11:45\n\nRobert I must have seen it when a when it must have got to the majestic about 1933 I should have thought I wouldn't have thought I'd seen it before. Before that. But I know that was the very first and I can't tell you whether I would have thought did it Really? Well, I just don't know. But that so that was that. So the hope first, I suppose 13 years as it were from the age of five was the the total fascination of movies buying amateurCine world hiring movies getting hold of a little Cine camera which I was given when I was about 12 a secondhand one by my parents. Really it was 9.5 I think Pathe Moto camera B\n\nAlan Legard 12:38\n\ngot any of your 9 point five\n\nRichard Marden 12:41\n\nannoying really john because I remember Godfrey and I sometime later on we went over to eight mil and 16 mil. And as you do when you're in your teens, you don't think about things, the better we are we don't have that rubbish and throw it all away. We kick ourselves completely every time we think about it.\n\nAlan Legard 13:03\n\nThe only person I know know who has recollection of 9.5 is our old friend Julian Coulter.\n\nRichard Marden 13:08\n\nI really loved\n\nAlan Legard 13:11\n\nthe night he helped me was 9.5 a few years back really I had to have transferred to video and he edited it together for you now it's I mean it's a fascinating\n\nRichard Marden 13:24\n\nsize with it because it got a remarkable picture area on yes it's the only trouble was was the wretched central sprocket rocket yes and\n\nAlan Lawson 13:31\n\nwhen they got torn\n\nRichard Marden 13:32\n\nwhen they got torn all sorts of scratches appearing on eventually I would have Pathe Vox\n\nDave Robson 13:41\n\nnot stripe but optical track\n\nRichard Marden 13:44\n\nI remember but that because I remember it cost 60 pounds I remember think if I ever had 60 pounds I would want to have a Pathe Voxbecause it was about £600 foot bench equipment yes\n\nDave Robson 13:58\n\nexpensive lens\n\nRichard Marden 14:00\n\nI've never heard any of it Did you know because the picture size and they must know D and it was a square picture though what they could they took the cap the cut the picture off in order to get the track on this?\n\nAlan Legard 14:13\n\nYeah, yes.\n\nRichard Marden 14:14\n\nThere was 17.5 sound too there then he early in the 30s which Pathe had but it never took off?\n\nAlan Legard 14:22\n\nThat came rather late on didn't it and vice versa the wwarv came and it all stopped Yeah, I never saw any I did see it once. Yes, I was seated. Give them a demonstration send me 9.5 by once that little amateur place out in Buckingham came to an end. Oh, sorry. I'm digressing.\n\nRichard Marden 14:41\n\nNo, no, that Sammy that really was the as I say when I had the 9.5 we've made some pretty ghastly movies.\n\nAlan Legard 14:51\n\nAnyway, you got stuck together.\n\nRichard Marden 14:53\n\nOh yeah. And I remember Godfrey was very clever because he he went in the industry before I did I have a target together But he left before I did. And he joined us at Crown Film Unit\n\nAlan Legard 15:04\n\nThat's right. And I remember Godfrey arriving where he worked in the film library with me it was a dear old lady called Adelaide Pentecost\n\nRichard Marden 15:11\n\nOh, that's right. And Terry Harvey joined.\n\nAlan Legard 15:14\n\nHe joined a little later\n\nRichard Marden 15:17\n\nwell, Godfrey, I seem to remember we had we'd hired up there now we are on 8 mill, I think this must have been somewhere when we were about 14, we got rid of nine five sold the projector got secondhand eight mil, I think or something like that. And we hied the lost world which was made about 1924, I think, which was remarkable one of tyhe first films which combined model action and live action split screen. And we Godfrey work, because Godfrey has always been much better, sort of technical things, and I haven't, and we he made a very good plasticine dinosaur. And we had one of the little dinky toy motorcars or whatever other culture or whatever. And we had it up in Godfrey's bedroom. And we had one photo flood lamp, and a reflector, and we animated the dinosaur climbing over this little car. Now this wasn't this was while we will still have 9.5, I think, because we hadn't got a stop frame, single frame camera. So when boomp boomp switches on or switch on the thing hoping you got one or two or whatever. So we ended up with a jerky dinosaurr walking over this dinky toy. But what we hadn't realised until it was a bit too late, was that it had quite a long tail, which of course didn't move very much good. It was out the area in which it was battery climbing was so confined. We hadn't noticed that the tail was melting on Godfreys bedroom carpet for the amount of output that when his mother came up, but she was very good, because it didn't really matter. But and so these sorts of silly things happen to you, you know, when you do these things, all of which are tremendous fun. None of them if they had, if they still existed would be of any interest to anybody. other than Godfrey or myself because they would look absolutely appalling. But\n\nAlan Legard 17:27\n\nyou show these films anyway.\n\nRichard Marden 17:29\n\nNo, because we never really. family used to be bored I'm sure with them, but they never really, we always seem to be rather more intrigued by seeing whether you could do this or that rather than actually making up a proper story and getting it together.\n\nAnd\n\nby that time one was away at school all week. Anyway, Godfrey was working I think for about 1943. And because he went into substandard film finishes as a lab. Yes. And then. Yes, then he joined Crown.\n\nAlan Legard 18:16\n\nSo anyway, so substandard film finishers Tell me what happened to them. Because I always thought that was a very bad name for a company no good counterproductive. It's\n\nRichard Marden 18:25\n\nI don't know, whatever happened. I never worked with them. I Godfrey worked for them. And as far as I know, he was there for about a year you'd have to ask him but then I think he went on to Crown Crown at PInewood That's right I was then still at school and being very jealous of\n\nAlan Legard 18:43\n\nyou were Highgate were there are other filmmakers.\n\nRichard Marden 18:46\n\nThere were other ones there but not that I knew of at the time. Teddy Darvas. He was there. But he wasn't there when I was there because he was the school was divided during the war or the early part of the war. And a lot of it was evacuated down to Westwood, Ho in Devon we where Teddy went I joined it in the end of 41. At a Highgate itself where there was a rump of about 120 people and I was made a weekly border there by my parents and the school reunited in 43 because the Navy decided they didn't need the buildings anymore and the school came back for westward ho. by which time as far as I know, Teddy wasn't I think he'd left. These dates are fairly accurate I think because 42 was the year my mother died I must havedied is about just over nearly 15 and it's these things. far as I remember Teddy wasn't there now. Who else Tony Harvey was at Highgate but he was younger than I and I I saw him once reall because he played the dauphion in a school production of Bernard Shaw's St Joan somewhere around about 1945, I think to remember, he's very good. And in fact, I remember seeing it. But and I think that sort of neurotic thing that, that I'm not being that Tony would do rather Well, the well Who else was there that went there that I didn't know. Alvin Bailey Bailey now what, what happened to Alvin had drinks with him by name, they came to my mind the other day. And I thought what on earth has happened to Alvin?\n\nAlan Legard 20:46\n\nHe lives in Elgin Crescent. He's not actually working very much, I don't think but he's still involved in a lot of local activities. And he goes into yoga and he does a lot of walking exercise and just enjoying life. changed a bit.\n\nRichard Marden 20:59\n\nI haven't seen him for 30 years, I should think. But if you see him do give him my best wishes. I mean, it's the last I can't remember when I last when people was he editing then last\n\nAlan Legard 21:11\n\nthing that he and I did together with somebody called Colin Moffett, who was a mutual friend of ours, who was a radio producer now. And he did a just on a programme about the life of Humphrey Jennings. Oh, yes, I heard that programme. And Alvin was one of the speakers and it made me think of some lines that Ian Dalrymple has\n\nRichard Marden 21:31\n\nwritten. That's right. Well, now that's what my cuz I listened to that programme And I wanted to hear it. And I thought when the credits came up and said, Alvin, Bailey I thought, well, good. I\n\nAlan Legard 21:42\n\nmean, I don't know that he's around. He's fine. Yeah. Oh, good. Yes. And we ought to interview him. I think sometime, because he's got an interesting story to tell.\n\nRichard Marden 21:50\n\nI'm sure he has. I'm sure he has. Yeah. So I was at Highgate. He was in high gate, but I don't think we were there together. I don't remember him there I think they may be a little older than I I don't know. I'm not sure.\n\nAlan Legard 22:05\n\nSo anyway, well,\n\nRichard Marden 22:06\n\nhe thought that was\n\nAlan Legard 22:07\n\nonly Harvey, because then he went on to\n\nRichard Marden 22:09\n\ntalk to the acting director,\n\nAlan Legard 22:13\n\nhe and the news. When did you Where did you start first? And as\n\nRichard Marden 22:18\n\nI started first at a place called Carlton Hill studios, and this was in 1946, as a trainee in the sound department, because\n\nAlan Legard 22:28\n\nI was your contact there. How do you\n\nRichard Marden 22:29\n\nwhat happened there was that my father, but we've done the usual business, we've got to now we're writing to all the studios, I want to get the film to do what you do. And they all said, we've got to join the ACT, or you've got to do this, you've got to do that. And none of it worked. My father as I told you, was involved with , the glass works, and they made film lighting equipment, studio lighting. And one day Pa heard a man called Mr. Bill Norris, was getting somewhere in the building or round the labs or whatever it was during looking at possible film lighting equipment, Father rushed over get all that. I have a son . I don't know, what do you know, it's all gone too far . And Bill Norris who was then manager of Nettlefolds studios at Walton onThames said, I will send him to see me. So I was duly sent or went to Walton to see Bill Norris which is one of the most exciting days of my life, because I was actually in a film studio. And Bill Norris this was a nice, rough guy . And I would say now, I suppose I think he'd be the sort of Chief electrician. And I think that he got into the situation by the war , sort of thing . But anyway, he was a nice man. And he said to me, Oh, you don't want to get in this business? And I said, Yes, I do. And I remember him ringing up the ACT. and say, I've got tonnes of stickers. I've got this college boy who wants to get into the business. A lot of chat, which I didn't understand. They don't understand any of it at that time. went on. And he showed me around the studio and they were making the Crowds of the Bankstand at that time, which was directed by Walter Ford I think, I think Dennis Price and various people and again, terribly exciting because this the films that these peopleand stuff and all the people that then it amiable, nice and pleasant, and they I don't know whether I was in the studio or not on visiting or whatever had I enjoyed it. Yeah, it's just very sweet of them and Bill Norris said Now, I know what we can do about that. There's no work for you here but we have a daughter for connections. With a small studio, Carlton Hill in St. John's Wood with there is possibility that there will be a vacancy there for a trainee. What do you have for you do anything trainee in the sound department so I thought fine you know that I suppose was somewhere around about June or July cuz I was buted I 46 six and I joined Carlton Hill I suspect\n\nAlan Legard 25:26\n\nquite a busy time because a lot of people were\n\nRichard Marden 25:28\n\ncoming back from the forces being demobbed and so I managed to get in there I think probably about September October as a trainee in the sound department. First day, I seem to remember sweeping up soundtrack and learning vaguely how to rig one of those old films and equipment booms there's sort of grey ones. Ben is out of the film that was being made was the Turner's of Prospect Road which is the second feature and it had Wilford Lawson how I've got the notes here Wilford Lawson's direct Maureen Glim can't remember damn funny name for a young girl, Jean de Cassilas or John de Cassilis was directed by Maurice Jay Wilson for Grand National, and it was photographed by Freddie Ford. And the continuity, the continuity girl is called Dot Forman And Firstly, I have to say is that I was green went into this business. But I'm now trying to put this as accurately and objectively as I can, from a fairly protected environment. Slightly, I suppose, with a bit of a plum in my mouth in the sense, but I've never come I've never come across carpenters and plasters and sparks and all these people before I never had that it's not part of my environment. And the fucking unblinding and all of which have cost you later then, and I was a naive 18 year well, there's no doubt about it. But what I've never forgotten is how kind they are when they sent me up. Of course they did, which was exactly right. But never unkindly. And were always very pleasant to me. And I'm amazed you know, and I think back on it when you think of all the conversations we had about class distinctions, snobbery and all the rest of it the plain fact of the matter is that a movie in the movies once you when you only live together, I think was absolutely wonderful. I've never forgotten. And the thing the Dot Foreman, the only reason I said her because she was very nice to me. Secondly, apparently she lived somewhere near Wilfred Lawson As we know, Wilford Lawson, a very fine actor, but by now had really taken to the bottle somewhat unfortunately, no matter. This story, which I believe to be true, but one evening while they were making this film I was I wouldn't I wouldn't have heard about it otherwise. Dot Forman was walking home somewhere, I think in Notting Hill gate, I don't know somewhere in this vague ambience of here. And she saw tLawson slightly inebriated going along. And she knew where he lived. And she thought, Well, I do him a favour and take him by the arm and I'll take him home. So there's no problem. And she went up and said hello, Wlfred you know And he took me by the arm and she says, you know, we live near to each other see you home. And they were walking along they passed a policeman . And he went up to the policeman , excuse me officer , this woman has accosted me she was carted off? to the police station Walter then had to come and identify her I have now dear Dot Forman . And I don't know what ever happened to her. I obviously haven't seen him for 50 years, whether she's still with us, or if I would make it plain in this. I know so as I know to be true. Is No. And I'm sure she would if it is true. She'd have enjoyed it. Now the other people who I remembered, I think the film is edited by a man called Donald ginsburg. Oh, yes. I can hear. That's so that was that. So while I was in the industry and I Paddy Cunningham was the sound camera operator who was due for call up went into the RAF. I took over a sound camera operator on a Pm 45 RCA What was known as portables? It took about three people to carry it plus an amplifier and god knows what and I remained, I think as sort of sound camera operator for about two years at most two years. And it was a very small studio that made basically second features which were made in two or three weeks and some of them\n\nMario Zampi came out of came back to the industry and made two movies. One called the Phantom Shot, which was originally called who killed Caleb Order, was edited by his son, Julio, and who was assisted by a man called Joe Levine is now in Los Angeles. And he made another film there later than that somewhere, I think at about I think in 47, I think he did that in 46, called the Fatal Night, which in fact, was a not bad, little spooky. second feature. With curious enough, Patrick Mee, Lester Ferguson who was I think, Canadian tenor, and Brenda Hogan and Jean Short and photographed by Cedric Williams. And it had the largest set that Carlton Hill ever, ever had, because it was a very small studio was sort of a large\n\nAlan Legard 31:20\n\nprivate house\n\nRichard Marden 31:20\n\nrather like one of these yes it was . And they had, the main set was the entrance to a Belgravia house where the staircase going up which was built and was practical, because you could get the dolly up there. And doors off thethe doors went nowhere, obviously, because then they had to build another little set for where the bedroom was, but\n\nthis was all put up with scaffolding and the usual thing and so on and so forth.I must have been coming down on the set, at some point as one did standing near a piece of rope just in front of a piece of tubing which was support me with it think about 150 other people supporting part of this stair case and gather it and feeling this sort of weight and getting realising that the Bill Tyler was the watchmacallit call it the the rigger the thing, Bill I think you ought to come over here I won'tmove but I've walked through it, it was just, it was all good. It's just a funny little story ready. And so I think I stayed in there. And, and they\n\nAlan Legard 32:50\n\nclearly experience that actually working on those on those small features\n\nRichard Marden 32:54\n\nWell, it was actually so many aspects. And so it you see the thing was it being a fvery small studio it also had cutting rooms. And I knew that I was not really cut out for being a sound technician because although I was fascinated by all of it in the sense of hearing it. For the good founders, I didn't in those days, it was valves and specialists. And I didn't understand what went\n\nAlan Legard 33:23\n\non in besides the radio world likely to\n\nRichard Marden 33:25\n\nand I didn't really want to know that actually, I could work all the equipment. And I knew Charlie Parkhouse was the sound man there and he'd say, well give me a level Dick I knew what to do with it all. I didn't know what went on. And all those tubes\n\nAlan Legard 33:41\n\nhe trained, he was an engineer. It'd be a radio sound\n\nRichard Marden 33:45\n\nengineer to and to know about that. And so I gradually wanted, I used to be fascinated by going into the cutting rooms that there were in this little studio and when there wasn't much doing in the sound department and if I could I would march in them. People would say hello and so on. Some would let you watch a bit of a start . And gradually I realised that what I wanted to do was to get into the cutting room and get out of the sound department. And we have a nice studio manager called Bob King who was has been in the Navy and he was very civilised interesting sort of character and I could talk with him and we talked about this and I think, worked out that when Paddy Cunningham came back from his forties of national service, he obviously had to come back into the job. So he took on so I think we were able to move it all around in some ways that I could go into cutting room because Kays at that time to make it through to K Carlton Hill studios owned by Kays labs and Nettlefold studios. who were going to Make a film. second feature of the WW. Jacob's the Monkey's Paw? Oh, yes. And it was worked out that I could go in as the assistant to the editor, albeit I had never done anything in the cutting room in my life. And the editor whose name I do, they very well, I've got it written down. And it was Ted Inmanhunter Ted hunter who actually when I consider it must have been among the most patient people ever come across because they were just the two of us. Now fortunately, in those days, the labs would sync up the rushes. And they'd also numbered them. So you could get them synced and numbered at the lab of that got one of the major happens out of the way. And then I was taught how to break them down. And I was taught how to file them. And I was told how Ted was very strict because not only did you have a rushes book, which has then slate and scene and all the rest of it in one book. But in those days, everything being on optical, you have neg numbers, of course, the soundtrack as well. So he always insisted that I have another book, which prepared will also cross referenced, I just spend all my time entering things in books, but of the slate numbers of the action with the edge numbers and the sound of the edge numbers, then all the different edge numbers collated and put together with the slates opposite them so that all the 41 yg. Right, yeah, the only things they will cross reference, they will spend most one time sort of doing these things, very good data, trying to put the trims away. And so and I must say dear old , Ted was very patient and I think one learns a ot one had to hand join it because we you did your own numbering? If not, then they broke up the labs did it. All right, yes. But we had the Griswold joiners and that better? Well, there's a bit of a nightmare blues, sound stuff for buzz track, which never stuck And I remember getting into this habit of going into running with one set of fingers crossed inspection and other fingers crossed exam got so stupid, so they wouldn't uncross them becausf I did something would break. But so we did that we finished that. So that was directed by Milton Rosmah. Oh, because he is well\n\nAlan Lawson 37:27\n\nknown actor\n\nRichard Marden 37:28\n\nHe was well an actor and he had directed films before the war he I think he did direct the Great Barrier or something.\n\nAnd\n\nit was photographed by Brian Langley. Oh, yes. It wasn't directed by it was directed by Norman Lee. I beg your pardon and starred Milton Rosmah and Megs Jenkins as young as a couple of years\n\nAlan Legard 37:51\n\nnormally. And then you say that to Brian Langley photographed it. That's right. Brian Langley was for a bit on the history project. He was on the committee. Really? Yeah. Because he he came in a few times last year. And he didn't stay very long because he didn't think he was critical. He said his looks rather frail. And he was obviously quite elderly. But he seemed to be in very,\n\nRichard Marden 38:13\n\nvery good. He's very good, cameraman, if I remember. Andall looked absolutely splendid. And so for them that all finished my favourite Carton Hill , they allowed me to stay on as a sort of general factotum for a bit. And then another film came in which Vernon Sewell director characters. And he was a film called Jack of Diamonds. And it was a film that he made on his yacht, female called the Gallard. And he and his then wife, Linda, Linda, she's still his wife will not and Nigel Patrick and some other people went off to do Deauville around the methods of pretty ghastly second feature quite quite a lot\n\nAlan Legard 39:03\n\nof productions when you're learning process\n\nRichard Marden 39:05\n\nOh indeed\n\nAlan Legard 39:07\n\nVery, very good. Very good. Obviously, it was a good place to be trained,\n\nRichard Marden 39:11\n\nreally. And it was edited by a man called Francis Biba who's been dead fat for a long time. Very nice man. And we worked on this together and Vernon also it was a great one for cutting because he really liked to cut his own movies anyway. So we were doing this what he worked with Powell and Pressburger and he did in the early days, Silver Fleet or whatever,\n\nAlan Legard 39:38\n\nand even earlier than was at the Edge of the World or something like that. Yes. Assistant Director I\n\nRichard Marden 39:42\n\nthink on and he was a but the interesting man because he he really made time to go blue his buddy maybe shouldn't say that, but uh, he He was a bit like a sort of Ralph Lin character for he had a monocle, so he spoke rather Posh Commander Sewell\n\nDave Robson 40:11\n\nI didn't realise\n\nRichard Marden 40:11\n\nI was actually a very nice man but a bit like that. He eventually once we finish shooting, which didn't take very long, he really came and cut the picture and Francis and I really thought this was so simply cut and I was so first come second assistant. And in the it meant we would take it in turns to wait with Vernon while he finished cutting at night because he tended to work on and on and on And they were one ghastly time I remember when we were going to move from Carlton Hill to Zands Court 8 Zands Court when he was needs to say, as always cutting rooms in Wardour Street anywhere in those days, always at the top of the building and they never have a lift. And I was my turn to stay with Vernon this Friday evening. And he we were I was moving the film The next day Saturday the van was coming at nine o'clock in the morning and so on. And\n\nDave Robson 41:11\n\nI\n\nRichard Marden 41:13\n\nVernon said we really do a little bit and we just work on these two reels because you could put the rest of it away and have it all ready for the morning. And at about half past 10 rung and Vernon said if you will just run me back to the station to get to get you home. And I promise I won't. I've just finish off I won't do anything more I got in the next morning famous last words. I've never seen such a mess in my life he'd worked on every reel he'd ran out of paper clips, he left the messages on the the plates the glass where e will be the lights of chinagraph at 4:30am run out of clips using pins, be careful when joining and I thought the van's coming in 20 minutes of every 20 minutes for all these bits of stuff, all you could do was just wind it all up into big rolls and cart it off that way and spend the next two hours. sorting it out He wasn't easy, but doesn't seem unkind man, you've just thoughtless. He I must say was very sweet because he The first time I ever got a credit because he made the credit. He said I don't have to pick up we've got this doesn't work out. We've got too much space. Oh, give him one. Which is free. That was the first one for a ery long time. So that was that and curiously enough jumping away about about that was 1949\n\nAlan Legard 43:01\n\nWhy did you have to go to Zandys Court anyway? I mean, was that because you were overflowing?\n\nRichard Marden 43:06\n\nWell, they were saying it wasn't a Kays film an independent production exclusive. I think I was in Yeah.\n\nAlan Legard 43:14\n\nSo anyway,\n\nRichard Marden 43:15\n\nso that was only 49. Then about I suppose six years ago, seven or eight years ago. I went to BAFTA for lunch I was working in town, I often get a BAFTA for lunch and I went in there and there were not many people about and I saw an old gentleman and somebody else in the corner. I thought I'm sure and something made me realise it was Vernon after but I feel very shy about these things because 40 years have gone by and God knows. I thought I can't let this go. And I did go up to him and said excuse Mr. Sewell and his said you won't remeber but I'm Dick Marden and I work on a film called Jack of Diamonds . I thought everybody was dead. I said bot all of them. And we had a pleasant little chat. He must have been in about late 80s I should think very together a very bright say Well, I dear boy I you know I spend half the year in South Africa. I've got a mobile have a caravan I drive down around.\n\nAlan Legard 44:29\n\nYeah, so I remember that time when he came. I never actually knew him But I've heard from people that he had been into BAFTA about having lunch with old Jerry O'Halloran who was a\n\nRichard Marden 44:42\n\nfriend of his No, that's why because they would have all gone back.\n\nAlan Legard 44:45\n\nYeah. Incidentally, alas . We just heard a couple of days ago that Jerry O'Halloran has died\n\nRichard Marden 44:51\n\nOh he has, has he We have I mean, when I've thought things were pretty bad because I've been asked they told me that he was in hospital and then you've been in hospital some months........................................................\n\nAlan Legard 0:02\n\nSo you had a chat with Vernon\n\nRichard Marden 0:04\n\nhad a chat with Vernon And he said that he was spending his winters in South Africa driving around, I was impressed by God driving around the big sort of motorised caravan. And he said in the summer, dear boy, I have the most marvellous little nook in the south of France, which I'm not telling you where it is, where I have my boat. So he was fine. It was lovely to see him. And he really, it was fun, and it was all part of the old past But then after that, Carlton who quite reasonably said, Look, you can't expect to be employed here, because you've actually started freelancing. So I left, and the next thing was what's going to happen. And fortunately, after a couple of months, when my father had begun to sort of say, you know, I think you've got to consider the situation pretty seriously what was going to go on like this, where the futurethoughts and so on. I had met up with Adam Dawson who was first assistant on the Glass Mountain,\n\nAlan Legard 0:04\n\nare how fascinating Alan Dawson yeah\n\nRichard Marden 0:14\n\nby Mister \\Lawrence? and I met up with him because they had done a certain amount of a cutting of that at Carlton Hill really is and and it was at that time that but to'd and fro'd bit with them, but they've got to know them. And after I'd left Carlton Hill, after I think after a jack of diamonds course was after jack of diamonds. Adam had my home telephone number and very sweetly rang up and said, Could I be second assistant with him? On Murder at the Windmill, which was a film actually I jumped something here, I'll go back and do it Murder at the Windmill which was a second feature madeat Nettlefold film studios about the Windmill theatre, the first proper feature film produced by Daniel M Angel, and directed and written by Val Guest. and edited by Duggie Myers, and Adam Duggie did the musical numbers Adam cut most of the dialogue scenes, and I was affected the system usually covered in head to foot with numbering it and rushing around finding it all. absolutely fascinating. And one sweet story I must mentioned about Val who, with a very, very competent director indeed knew exactly what he wanted to do. And the film came in it was supposed to be an hour length, and it came in at something like 55 minutes or 67 minutes.or whatever contractually, this was no good. And so they had to shoot something else. And I'm amazed that I hadn't noticed that because I remember thinking, well, I've got a brilliant idea. When I went to Duggie Myers who was very nice, man, very clever editor too. I said Duggie I've got an idea he said you should ring up Val I said I can't ring up Val He wants to know he was trying to think of that. That's what I can't do that is to go and pick him up. So I rang up and explained who I was it yesterday. What is it live on idea? for because I gather we're under length and I went into a terribly complicated farrago of a chase of the Windmill theatre down .Piccadilly. I mean, it was absolutely nonsense to me. I'm embarrassed when I think back on it now. Anyway. Val listened to all of this without being impatient. And said, Dick, thank you now I said, we can't do it. And he said, I'll tell you why we can't do it. And with great well with great kindness really he told me exactly why it was impractical. It would cost too much because they'd have to be BP they'd have to have night shooting explained the whole thing to me. Thanked me for it. And in the end we shot Jimmy Edwards was playing the trombone. But I've never I never worked for Val again. It's a\n\nAlan Legard 4:34\n\ngood way but that's part of the learning process, isn't it?\n\nRichard Marden 4:37\n\nBut I thought what kind man What a sympathetic man instead of saying what the heck do you mean by being over wasting my time? I'm not troubled about you.\n\nAlan Legard 4:48\n\nHe was saying an interesting idea but but you\n\nRichard Marden 4:50\n\nknow, and and explained it but I've thought Listen, I've always had\n\nAlan Legard 4:56\n\nWhere did you edit this particular film? with Doug Myers and saw what\n\nwas it done? This was done at Nettlefolds\n\nNettlefolds your back at Walto\n\nRichard Marden 5:06\n\nbecause now I'm in the freelance, available of whoever will employ a nice little studio\n\nAlan Legard 5:11\n\nthat actually I wrote. I like it. I worked at Walton for about 10 days. We did it. We shot a documentary, which had some studios. Yeah, it's quiet internet. And when they were making the Oscar Wilde film, oh, yeah, it's been about 1960 I suppose about 10 to 12 years later than the\n\nRichard Marden 5:30\n\nnew closed in 60. odd. Yeah, there's probably about 57 58\n\nAlan Legard 5:37\n\nIt was the other Oscar Wilde film they were making. That's why we're doing a little documentary about freight transport required studio scenes. And I enjoyed it. I thought it was a pleasant little place.\n\nRichard Marden 5:47\n\nIt was a studio and I spent quite a bit I\n\nAlan Legard 5:50\n\nthought it was sort of wiped out and turned into a shopping centre, but\n\nRichard Marden 5:54\n\nit was it was a shame and it was also Well, it was sold out when when Hannah Weinstein everybody left it. Robin Hood,\n\nAlan Legard 6:02\n\nRobin Hood,\n\nRichard Marden 6:05\n\nthings they, but curious enough, I've got my dates wrong. Because after 49, after the Jack of Diamonds thing, and before Murder at the Windmill. A company started up based at Carlton Hill to start with called Parthian productions, which was run as far as I remember or run by a man called Henry Hobhouse was, as far as I know, the first company in Britain to make films for American television. And what happened was that they started off the small way, making a series of famous musical songs was just somebody playing a piano and artists set and a sort of medium shot close up. About I think they were 13 minutes each have about four songs. Francis Bebo got involved with it, and hence I got involved with it as his assistant, because they chop, I think 13 now this is either going to be a bit naughty here because of them and his assistant. I don't think they're alive. I can't believe that they're alive that his name was Dockery. And her name was Mrs. Morse. And they were supposed to be cutting these things. But they didn't seem to be getting on with them very well. That was why Francis was called in Francis was called in , and he asked me to join him. So it was decided the thing to deal with Doc and Mrs Morse would continue from number one, and we would start at number 13. And theoretically meet them in the middle. But we didn't we met them around about number two. Now I was this was I suppose probably my third experience in the cutting room in the sense of Monkey's Paw first one. Jack of Diamonds But even I by now realised that there were certain things you had to do otherwise it wouldn't work. And one of them was that you should number it because if you didn't cut the clappers off it was quite arbitrary unless you were going to sync up\n\nAlan Legard 8:34\n\nwith I used to have to number it by hand without a numbers machine I just scraped\n\nRichard Marden 8:40\n\nevery foot or two feet or three feet.\n\nAlan Legard 8:43\n\nRemember with a little scratch on 123 but normally Chinagraph then but I lots of sync marks\n\nRichard Marden 8:50\n\nYes indeed. Well the thing about this was even I had realised that they weren't numbering and that this and Mrs Morse used to go up and down on a bar there were two moviolas we've had a big cutting room two moviolas and one with one with fully fully adapted spools so on so she used to have these songs joined up when the medium shot close medium you know she's copping down all day all these things. She used to wear white apron to white overall I remember saying to listen, Mrs Morse what about what are you doing? And she said well, I'm spotting and I've never understood this that's still that under the I think she was spotting approximate cuts for Doc because then at some point the whole thing will be brought out and it would be put for a synchroniser but then once its clappers were cut off. Yeah. And he takes it out of the synchroniser It was a very movable feast . Whether the next few cuts were in sync, or they weren't, and that was one of the reasons why I think,\n\nAlan Legard 10:05\n\nwhat what is spotting mean? And I mean, what but I can only say a physical thing was did she actually mark,\n\nRichard Marden 10:11\n\nI think she marked through a blueit? it there. And then you could\n\nAlan Legard 10:15\n\nit was getting points. Yeah. Yes, it could be that could be the lack of doing a sort of assembly but without\n\nactually joining.\n\nRichard Marden 10:23\n\nAnd so that's really why. Now the other and this is a really rather knocking dear old Doc he was a silly old man actually. And the thing is, though, the other piece of final foolishness was with that, because one of the introductions to the song had been incorrect and needed, obviously to be reshot, which would have been a close up of the bosses then. Cyril whatever his name was the man who played this piano, just needed to be reshot then you say what he have to say, Doc announced that this wasn't necessary. Because all he needed to do was I still find it extraordinary that all he needed to to do was to record the track. And then if we got a blow up of the existing shot of Phil thingamajig, at the piano, he'd cut the picture to fit the track. So we thought, well, this can't You can't be serious about this, but it was ordered. And then after about a week of, and he had the soundtrack of three frames out here Leave two put in one just as the other ended up with a piece of picture at the same length of the track. And we went up to the tiny theatre, I've had a look of something with some St Vitus Dance hopping about. all over the screen And that really, I think, was the time when it was decided that Doc probably didn't know as much as he said he did. And it was just I couldn't believe that day, the\n\nAlan Legard 12:09\n\nagain, learning experience seeing what not to do. But\n\nRichard Marden 12:12\n\nthe thing was, we then put that Parthan production then got larger, and it started doing some potted Shakespeare versions, which it shot out. All right, yeah. So where are you still?\n\nAlan Legard 12:27\n\nWhere are you still using nitrate? Well, we're the way we are nitrate film still still on nitrate? Absolute about 1950. Again, I suppose.\n\nRichard Marden 12:35\n\nYes. Got 51 5051. I think it was\n\nAlan Legard 12:39\n\nsort of working in these different places. What was that? A problem? And those days, nitrate? Did you know I tend to be very careful. Did you have to have I mean,\n\nRichard Marden 12:48\n\nthe thing was, again, nobody obviously was allowed to smoke in the cutting rooms and anybody like Duggie who liked to have a cigarette But you'd have to go outside into the exterior to do it. Yeah. And they were strict about that. Oh, they were yes indeed . And there was no question. I mean, if you remember that projection equipment, had its own little extinguisher on the gate and all of that everything was covered from the, from the top spool box to the takeout box. So yeah, if anything went then theoretically only burn six, foot of film it out. You know\n\nAlan Legard 13:29\n\nremember Pinewood we were they were frightfully strict thee , we had put all our smoking materials, we had these metal cabinet.\n\nRichard Marden 13:34\n\nThat's why theoretically, we had to put those in\n\nAlan Legard 13:36\n\nand they were they I don't know whether they had fire practice or anything, but I know they were very strict about it. And which ones had stories of sort of freelance editors or curious characters possibly like some like Bernard Thewell working or like, you know, smoking a cigar and then occasionally, conflagration and all these cuttings going up,in flames in particularly, but I mean, there were many stories of that.\n\nRichard Marden 13:36\n\nI think that work. I think, obviously, it's like, gun cartridges it's incredibly dangerous stuff.\n\nAlan Legard 14:07\n\nI remember it. Well.\n\nRichard Marden 14:08\n\nI don't I fortunately, never was involved in a way with anybody. I think certainly the people that I worked with, who smoked I mean, Duggie smoked, I think Val had certainly smoked Francis, I think had the occasional cigarette but there was never any never anywhere near the filmbecause it was so ingrained. I mean, barely, I suppose 50 years been known. Yeah. What is good to know, actually. Yes, it was good. What was\n\nSpeaker 2 14:36\n\nI heard a story of a chap over which spooloing up films and he was a smoker, and used to make change over cues for that.\n\nRichard Marden 14:49\n\nWell, you've heard I've heard these tales. When I was at Carlton Hill somebody told me about an editor. I didn't know but this is an apocryphal story but I think must've oobviously pre war story, but who knows what sort of markers cuts. But I didn't know how you could do that just because if you did that with celluloid, the whole thing went up. You could do it with acetate because it would just crinkle Absolutely, yeah. But if you did this for sale once you did that, the whole thing is that black sheets evolved and I couldn't, I don't really I find those stories a bit difficult to believe because it has\n\nAlan Legard 15:29\n\nthat particular orange flame that one remember is sort of very strange and it hissed. And we used to use them for fireworks. So old spares yeah, make them into Roman candles.\n\nRichard Marden 15:41\n\nHmm. And so you know, it was I athetic . Everybody was very strict on\n\nAlan Legard 15:49\n\nbecause there's still an awful lot of nitrate left about you know.\n\nRichard Marden 15:54\n\nYeah, I could happen to generated into jelly.\n\nAlan Legard 15:57\n\nYeah. Yes, this lab down at South Norwood Henderson's run by the Lucas brothers about three or four years ago, they had a terrific conflagration down some original negs of Ealing studio films and went up and\n\nRichard Marden 16:14\n\nreally. That's very sad. And\n\nAlan Legard 16:17\n\nunfortunately, they had predictive firebreaks , and so on. And I suppose in the passage of time, this stuff becomes unstable and it can spontaneous combustion almost if there's the wrong temperature. Anyway, sorry. But just an interesting point, because I always recall was such a pleasure leaving Crown film in it and joining Edgar Anstey at British Transport films in Savile Row where everything was on safety stock, so didn't have to worry about yeah, that's always wonderful. lovelylovely quality prints from Humphroes all on safety stock. Well, of course, the original neg was still on, on nitrate up till about 55 I suppose.\n\nSpeaker 2 17:00\n\nWell, we made change over in the West End base very gently, very slowly. But it was the start of up to that all joints are handmade.\n\nRichard Marden 17:09\n\nYes. You\n\nSpeaker 2 17:10\n\nExactly. Everyone had their own signature. You knew exactly who made join. Yeah. But after that, we had to go on to hand splices, you know. Just different films altogether.\n\nAlan Legard 17:23\n\nOh, yes.\n\nRichard Marden 17:25\n\nNo, because I think they I remember the old Griswold splicer the handle and then we have the foot\n\nAlan Legard 17:33\n\njoin the foot joiner which were heated. That's why I had to switch it on well before you started joining, because heating\n\nRichard Marden 17:41\n\nthose were very bad. They did good news. Good. They were very good. We had diagonal\n\nAlan Legard 17:46\n\njoin us for a sound editing. I remember foot joiners\n\nRichard Marden 17:49\n\nnow. That's right. That's right.\n\nAlan Legard 17:52\n\nThe first work I ever did in the cutting room was doing diagonal join us for the dubbing tracks of a film called the Broad Fourteen made at Pinewood but 1945 I suppose. Yeah, directed by McNaughton Archie McNaughton\n\nRichard Marden 18:11\n\nOh, yes, yes, yes. No, I think, but the thing about going back to the old Parthian thing, they we did the potted Shakespeare's we did a potted version of Julius Caesar, the potted version of Antony and Cleopatra. Those were shot at Southall studios.\n\nAlan Legard 18:34\n\nOh, yes. I went to Southall once\n\nRichard Marden 18:37\n\nReally? Well, they were shot there. And then what was happening? It all seems we're getting rather large and we all thought this will be a very good we're on to a very good thing here and then we're going to be splendid. And then they were doing also series on the lives of the great musicians. Chopin with Mary Ellis? playing Georges Sands\n\nAlan Legard 19:03\n\nOh, yes, Mary Ellis\n\nRichard Marden 19:05\n\nOh, God Who? famous guitarist who's older than John Williams and his family? Not Julian. Julian. Julian Bream of\n\na ghastly set can't remember . Anyway. So it all seemed rather splendid, except that when they went to do the life of Beethoven, the man who directed with a man called john Calthrab up who was the son of a famous actor called Donald Calthrab. Yeah. And he was incompetent and they had to stop it about three days into shooting because it wouldn't go together. Suddenly, things began to look. Somehow they weren't right anymore. And by that time, Francis and I had moved intoWardour Street with our potted versions of Julius Caesar, and Antony and Cleopatra, and we were working in some old cutting rooms that don't exist now called Acmade , cutting rooms on the corner Broadwick or whatever street it was or Broadith I can't remember now. At one wet morning, Monday morning, it was pouring rain, and we got there. And the cutting room manager said, you come in out of the rain, you mustn't touch anything, because he's impounded it all. Then checks bounced. And suddenly the whole thing was over in a fortnight. And it transpired that Hobhouse, this man who had started the whole process, good idea, had not one contract with anybody in America to take anything. His plan had been that he'd complete certain things, take them over, show them and then everybody's want them. He'd be under speculative, purely speculative venture. He borrowed 50,000 pounds, which is a lot of money in the Film Finance Corporation. Oh, did he? Yes. Because they also were doing these I think they did Muffin the Mule. They told me it really was quite a big enterprise. As I said, collapsed, we were eventually paid. Two weeks notice, forgot that. I think I'm still owed five and sixpence of taxes. That was one of those things. And so then, was that unfortunate and one first experience of the\n\nAlan Legard 21:46\n\nso there's that stuff and never saw the light of day?\n\nRichard Marden 21:48\n\nI mean, yes, whatever happened?\n\nAlan Legard 21:51\n\nDid anybody salvage it?\n\nRichard Marden 21:53\n\nI think the only thing that was possibly salvaged was Muffin the Mule , which could be sold because they exist Muffin the Mule Yeah, that was sold. I think that I don't think so. I don't think we ever completed in terms of mixing or anything like that. No, the potted Shakespeare's they may have sold some of those musical songs. Possibly.\n\nAlan Legard 22:14\n\nActually, some of the some of the same Shakespeare stuff had been shot and partly completed. It would have been quite interesting archive material and those actors of those days. Oh,\n\nRichard Marden 22:22\n\nindeed. Because\n\nAlan Legard 22:25\n\nChannel Four\n\nRichard Marden 22:27\n\nactors have they had\n\nAlan Legard 22:29\n\nthat in the past, haven't they within complete films? The classic example being I, Claudius\n\nRichard Marden 22:34\n\nOh, yesterday? Well, no, that's why because if I remember rightly, I think they were directed by Desmond Davis who died tragically. Davis he was electrocuted. Yes, that's\n\nAlan Legard 22:52\n\nright now yeah, that was extraordinary one that has\n\nRichard Marden 22:55\n\nan accident. And he was a television writer, the very nice man. I find them but\n\nAlan Legard 22:59\n\nI don't know. But\n\nRichard Marden 23:00\n\nhe's directed the little musical songs and he directed these potted Shakespeare's and in Julius Caesar Bruce Belfridge played Julius Ceasar think i right in saying I could be wrong about this. Cleopatra was played by Pauline Leps, I think, and Marc Anthony it was played by Robert Speight. would be good but whatever happened to any of that maybe I have no way of knowing because it just disappeared and there was an official receiver called Mr. Jeep's. But I don't know when this is not I have one whatever the only way you could ever find anything about any of that I would have thought and it may not get you anywhere would be go to Metro colour who about were taken over who took over Kays labs or whether there were any records from Kays because Kays would have processed all of it? Oh, yes. I think I think that the\n\nAlan Legard 24:14\n\njust depends really on if there was some sort of librarian who realised that it would have a\n\nRichard Marden 24:20\n\nbit of an interesting value for value. I don't know I got a message.\n\nAlan Legard 24:27\n\nInteresting, that would be lovely. Yeah. But it was handed over I mean, BFI we could probably do some research into the matter. Anyway, what happened next\n\nRichard Marden 24:39\n\none, and then sell them that that book rapidly became beforeJack of Diamonds I mean, it was all around Jack of Diamonds. That's all a bit in that 1950s and Murder at the Windmill was followed by a second feature for Butcher's shot at Walton and directed by McLean Rogers. This was edited by Ted Richards Ted, Richards was a nice editor man who worked a lot for Butchers in those days doing sort of second feature in type which has had an enormous\n\nAlan Legard 25:16\n\noutput and they\n\nRichard Marden 25:16\n\ndid and in fact, I have to like to recap slightly when I was still on the sound camera, being seconded to Walton for two weeks, when Butchers were making a film with Frank Randall called When you come Home, Blakely wasn't around Blakely, BlakelyBlakely, and Blakely , was Manchester led Butchers Manchester excellent moves about the Butchers bank union and I can't Who was it? Butchers in? There was somebody else because somebody once said to me that when Butchers decided that they wanted to make a movie, they'd like to make this movie sort of musical based on musical songs and ballads and something and they said the production meeting would sort of consist of why don't we do what about When you come Home? How does that go? Well, da da da that's rather nice we'll do that. But another one was I'll turn to you, which was another ballard of 19th century I think, but I just did this fortnight When you come Home. And Ted Richards was editing that assisted by a very nice lady who eventually came to succed Ted Richards called Chrissy Home.\n\nAlan Legard 26:41\n\nRemember chris Chris Home? She worked with my assistant for a time she's a sweet woman. And she was with me on a film for group three.\n\nRichard Marden 26:50\n\nOh, that's what what would be. She was\n\nAlan Legard 26:53\n\nat South Hall studios, where they i think is\n\nRichard Marden 26:56\n\nno she was she was working then with Ted and we. The end is about that. Frank Randall. It was a film that Butchers thought might bring Randall down to the south rather than the North, where he had a huge following up in the\n\nAlan Legard 27:15\n\nLancashire so on He did indeed in a real\n\nRichard Marden 27:16\n\nRedcisle? didn't work. I mean, I think it would went on the Granada Harrow they took it off after two days. It was a pretty ghastly film, actually. But was the music. He was the janitor of an Edwardian musical. But curiously enough, directed by john Baxter. Oh, yes. Which was sort of an interesting shot and tsunami\n\nAlan Legard 27:40\n\nwho later became with Grierson\n\nRichard Marden 27:43\n\nfounder of group three, group three yes and had been sort of important before the war I hadn't he We only\n\nAlan Legard 27:50\n\nmade a film called Love on the Dole. And of course, well, many films before that.\n\nRichard Marden 27:54\n\nThat was his big. That was a big social.\n\nAlan Legard 27:58\n\nhit film. Deborah Kerr her first starring role.\n\nRichard Marden 28:03\n\nThat's right. That's right. So anyway, sorry. I've gone back on that. And I suddenly remembered this thing. Yes. And so after that, but it was down to ???????????????\n\nAlan Legard 28:16\n\nI think remember, at some point in your career, you were you were a documentary weren't you\n\nRichard Marden 28:20\n\nWell, I used to sort of go float about you see because when there wasn't anything happening I used to work for data on occasions really up in town because I worked. Remember Dick Story? Yes, I do. Yes. Now I worked with him.\n\nRobert\n\nAlan Legard 28:39\n\nKruger, Cougar,\n\nRichard Marden 28:40\n\nJack Chambers. And they're making films for the Coal Board . That's right. And I thought they would ring me up if I wasn't doing anything. That would be a little bit later. Would it be around 51 ish. Because there's some mining review. And then it was a ministry of works Film Unit for one week. I did. One worked where you could get a job.\n\nAlan Legard 29:12\n\nI was the assistant editor on the very first mining reviews really, because they were made not by data. They were made by crime Film Unit. They would have been Of course, right to start with because, well, a Coal Board filming it hadn't really started. Because the Coalboard filming it started about I suppose 48 49 And Frances Gyson involved? Yes, he was Yes, that's right. Yes. Because he was an editor with Rotha right when Rotha as well. Rotha's chief editor. I think he edited those big films that Rotha made World Aplenty and so on and then of course, then eventually Gyson didn't got involved directly with all the Coal Board work because he was appointed producer. That's right. Well, that was much later on.\n\nRichard Marden 29:59\n\nHe went to Highgate too I think yeah, I have a feeling. I mean, Somebody once told me that there's not that this maytters . But yes, I remember him. And that I think was about 51. We interviewed Francis.\n\nAlan Legard 30:14\n\nWe went down to his place and we you rarely. alsas he died a few months ago.\n\nRichard Marden 30:19\n\nReally? No, I remember I remember him as a sort of amiable rather volatile character, I think,\n\nAlan Legard 30:28\n\nbut I kind of might have been in his you. He was fairly easygoing when we saw him.\n\nRichard Marden 30:32\n\nI mean, I'm thinking\n\nAlan Legard 30:39\n\nvolatile Well, exactly. So I remember jumping up around with rage in the cutting room.\n\nRichard Marden 30:45\n\nmolesting everybody. So then\n\nAlan Legard 30:51\n\nsaid that was, yeah, well, you said\n\nRichard Marden 30:52\n\nthat was what was sort of happening. When ever there wasn't, well, wherever things happened, if you know if they would ring me or I go and see them, and they'd say, We have to do something for us. Now, so it was all a good overall freelance sort of experience.\n\nAlan Legard 31:15\n\nDidn't you work with Bob Angel? Perhaps that was later\n\nRichard Marden 31:17\n\nOh that was later because that was when we found the film partnership. Oh, yes. Right. Sorry about that, but so go back to you. But then still on the sort of the in between the thought of feature and the data and all the rest of it in about 1950 I think probably not long after Murder at the Windmill, actually. Duggie Byers had another pitch to cut and basically they said but I became his first assistant, which was a film called The late Edwin Black which was made at Worton Hall studios. And wherever it is, Hounslow Whorton Hall was, whatever it is, yes. And it was produced by Ernest Gartside and directed by Morris Elvey who was an odl doyen I suppose.\n\nAlan Legard 32:11\n\nHe must have made directed hundreds of films. He started\n\nRichard Marden 32:15\n\ndirecting in back 1930. And it was photographed by Steven Dade. And it had Geraldine Fitzgerald, David Ferrer, Roland Culver. And it was from a stage play. It was a murder\n\nAlan Legard 32:34\n\non Fox not too long ago. Yes, he\n\nRichard Marden 32:36\n\ndid a terrible film. I think that the very boring film have really nothing\n\nAlan Legard 32:43\n\nrather nice look at\n\nRichard Marden 32:45\n\nI think it looks all right. I remember Maurice who was a rogue really I think, really, he was a terrible liar.\n\nAlan Legard 32:56\n\nWas he\n\nRichard Marden 32:57\n\nout he I remember this curious that we have a first assistant called Ken Ricks. And operator, a camera operator was Murray. Grant has been dead for quite a while now. And for about the first few days when rushes came, Maurice would say Oh, oh, yeah, but I didn't know. I thought we were I thought it was you know, slightly different sort of setup. They got fed up with this\n\nAlan Legard 33:36\n\nis one of those.\n\nRichard Marden 33:37\n\nSo after about the five\n\nAlan Legard 33:38\n\nof a microwave, or people\n\nRichard Marden 33:40\n\nafter about the first two or three days, Murray and Ken got this thing going on the floor between them when they get Maurice would get the set up is there to motivate why we wouldn't look through the viewfinder so Murray looked, through then say Ken come over here. kind of look at you ever noticed. It was not the million years you wouldn't notice it? And I think and Maurice will be just here because he couldn't resist having to look because he'd hear this conversations, you know, you get something they get him to look through the viewfinder that way. So that tended to stop certain amount of that\n\nAlan Legard 34:21\n\nIt's a lovely story that actually I think it's amazing. It hasn't. It's different more than I expect.\n\nRichard Marden 34:28\n\nWhat would happen is that Geraldine who was a very intelligent lady, and she had certain rights, like she had I think approve, or her husband had to approve the first cut. And we got to the point where we were going to do music. And she had had the right to see the film. But she'd been to Ireland didn't understand that okay, she dies, and she hadn't been available and everybody thought they can't do it , so we can go ahead and record the music and there we are. And she came back about two days before the music session. And I must say she's very quick because in those days, you broke the film down in the music section, mark it up And she said, now said to Duthe lot. Because I know it's nothing to do with you. But I think they're trying to pull the wool over my eyes. I am going to insist on seeing it. But today what I will do, I'm quite happy to sit through the music sections of the regstof it. I don't want you to put it all back together as the terrible boe thinks. And I said yes. And she didn't do that. She said I don't I probably will have nothing to say about it at all . But I will not let people trt and fob me bless her heart she did that didn't cause us any major health issues. I'd be happy what she saw. I think she's perfectly happy. We did have we have no problems.\n\nWe went to record the music at Shepperton when they still have the music stage. And it was composed by God is named I used to know is that he was athe man who also composed the music for The Matter Matter of Life and Death.\n\nAlan Legard 36:30\n\nOh, you may know them. Alan Grey\n\nRichard Marden 36:33\n\nYes, Alan Grey sort of Hungarian or whatever he was. And that was the moment in, the composers. Go on. I think about quite big that Maucice at one point, thought he wanted a big crescendo finding whether in the clinch or something like that .Alan say If you wish to vulgarise your picture, you can have it\n\nAlan Legard 37:00\n\nlovely.\n\nRichard Marden 37:02\n\nThat was by recollection,\n\nAlan Legard 37:04\n\nnice little bit of temperament.\n\nRichard Marden 37:05\n\nAnd then we dubbed the picture John Cox mixed it at us at Shepperton at of at societies 50. In a dubbing theatre that doesn't exist anymore. I've had a job with him for a long time. And I remember Maurice saying once. Now I want them to be terribly quiet here because it's hard to hear them. Remember John saying Maurice you can't have it as low as that because they won't hear it to get dropped. Well, yeah. Now I'm accessible. But natural if you couldn't hear it, that was taken up to thePlaza late after the last house running there. And I remember Maurice and we couldn't hear it and the house was still warm. I thought whats that got to do it. And then but anyway.\n\nAlan Legard 38:00\n\nSo you had to have another go\n\nRichard Marden 38:01\n\nthat we had never had we mix that real and that\n\nAlan Legard 38:04\n\nwas his music. Just the main thing it really the the crucial thing was always intelligibility of dialogue was a crucial thing. And if people were worried about that, then they tended to music tended to get lost.\n\nRichard Marden 38:16\n\nAnd I think that Maurice just got a bee in his bonnet, as he was quite capable of doing and. But there it was, I remember it seeing it on the box, actually, about 20 years ago. Okay, one Sunday afternoon, I thought I will have a look a bit. I can't remember where which was on commercial television. I don't remember Absolutely. If it was I know they always cut things around a bit. But there was to my mind of any one mysterious moment in the film. And that is when I think candles blow out or\n\nAlan Legard 38:53\n\nOh, yes, yes, it was a bit tricky.\n\nRichard Marden 38:54\n\nAnd that was a bit they had cut to the commercial. And cut back from the commercial after it. Absolutely. I rang them up in a fury and I said Now listen. This film was made better as well. I said the producers dead the directors dead the editors dead. I happen to be the father I know and the remaining people who worked on the film as an assistant editor. I said I don't know why you ever bother to put it on anyway because it's not a very good movie. But I said it is absolutely incredible to me. But the one possible moment which was vaguely interesting. You managed to cut out to fit in your commercials.\n\nAlan Legard 39:40\n\nwhat sort of reply Did you get to that?\n\nRichard Marden 39:43\n\nI think they just said we'll take note of what your saying said\n\nthank you for your interest. Yes, yes, exactly. As you can see what happens.\n\nSlightly digressing now nothing to do with anything other than looking at the box a few years ago. I suppose about ten I was not working. I was in one afternoon, there was a movie on one of Cyril Frankel's films, which I hadn't seen. And I thought why not have a look at this, and I was quite happy they bought you get them, suddenly the sound went off. And I don't understand that because I've fiddled around with change the channel on the set, save my set. rang, I was off about five minutes. And I rang up whoever it was, and they said, No, it can't be because I said what it was, they'd say, well, it does. But it doesn't, because I need to speak to an engineer there because somebody said that, you know, they kept these pictures about I don't want to talk about there's nothing to do with cutting about that there wasn't any sound. And I said, I want to speak to an engineer and they somebody came on and said, No can't. No, where do you live? And I said, Eccleston Grove no. We monitor everything that goes out of you getting from this transmitter, and so on and so forth. And then I said, Well, I'm sorry, but it just doesn't make any sense to me at all. And I want you to make further inquiries. Oh, my God. Oh, pompous. I gave my telephone number. To my total amazement, when it was over, the phone rang and it was one of the engineers there Yes, I'm sorry. There was a breakdown in the area in which you live for that period of time. I said you know, I said yes. When he said when it was a scene in coffee bars, I said yeah, he said well actually what happened was she said to him and he said to her and then they\n\ntell me what\n\nAlan Legard 41:43\n\neverybody is watching.\n\nRichard Marden 41:44\n\nAnyway, I digress sorry that will they be so anyway, there was a later week later Rit Black after that. I managed to get a short fill in job also at Whorton Hall Herbert Wilcox picture called Into the Blue, which was directed by him, edited by Bill Lewthwaite, and had Michael Wilding Constance Cummings Jack Hulbert and Odile Desoir in in this film that started off being directed by somebody else. And it wasn't working working. And Herbert apparently went over to the south of France where they were making it and took it over. And Jerry Hamblin was first assistant to Bill and I was just a supernumerary that time helping out on the dubbing panic. But one of those days, that period of time when we thought too heavy, that'd be very, but you'd have the whole film in two days, weekend at Sheperson. Then they were like it is now. Then I think I went back to Data, possibly for a bit.\n\nAlan Legard 42:59\n\nOh, did you? Yes. So who would you be? Well,\n\nRichard Marden 43:01\n\nI would be with Dick Storey I was Paul Kruger and\n\nAlan Legard 43:07\n\nI could edit it. He was he was the director. No,\n\nRichard Marden 43:11\n\nI'm not sure what he did that. I mean, we just used to see each other regularly.\n\nI\n\nnever quite knew what\n\nAlan Legard 43:21\n\nBut me know if you're working with Victoria, you would be the assistant with him. Will you be doing a bit of editing?\n\nRichard Marden 43:26\n\nOh, no, I was just an assistant. But\n\nAlan Legard 43:28\n\nwhen you were working on the features, presumably were you I mean, did the journey have first and the second was assessed\n\nRichard Marden 43:34\n\nto the second assistant but by now I was. I was when I\n\nAlan Legard 43:37\n\nwas working in group three, there was a second features and I actually had a that's right, we did have to we had to assistant that's right And then I think I did my own track laying . That's the thing in those days. That's\n\nRichard Marden 43:48\n\nwhy the editors did there. you didn't have a sound editor?\n\nAlan Legard 43:53\n\nWhich of course I always enjoyed the rate thing. We were always under pressure of course. I mean, our films are small scale, so they were manageable. Now of course it's quite impossible now with totally\n\nRichard Marden 44:04\n\ndifferent Well, it's it's a full track. Yeah. But then I did a bit I think one week where the Ministry of works\n\nAlan Legard 44:16\n\nis you saying the Ministry of work?\n\nRichard Marden 44:18\n\nwhat we've been doing, I because I went there but Tubby Englander\n\nAlan Legard 44:23\n\nalso, funnily enough, Dave was talking about\n\nRichard Marden 44:25\n\nwhen he but he wouldn't remember me because for some reason, I don't know what we were doing. He was somewhere in Lambeth and more or less, it was sort of understood if something else came up in the feature line. I could take it. Then I went to Denham on Disney's Robin Hood, which was directed by Ken Alec and edited by Gordon Pilkington.\n\nAlan Legard 44:52\n\nOh yes, there's\n\nRichard Marden 44:52\n\na name I haven't heard wrong with Richard Todd, Joan rice and Peter Finch. And I joined that because They've been shooting a long time they nearly finished shooting and Anne Coates was film editor. And what had happened was Walt was coming over to see as far as they've got and certainly needed a bit of a little bit of panic. So Annie was put out to assembly cutter so she could go on with some editing and I was brought on as the first assistant to replace her. And so that's really, I've met Pilc before. That's really how I first met Annie and stayed on that and.....................................\n\nAlan Legard 0:02\n\nRight, well, you're on the Robin Hood do really arrive\n\nRichard Marden 0:07\n\nreally alive and we ran, I suppose I don't suppose the film was completely cut. I honestly can't remember but we ran. What must have been a good more, more or less all of it I think for him, as far as I remember one afternoon in a theatre at Denham, and he was there with the director, the producer Perc Pierce, who was part of the designer organisation in Perc Pierce I think it also been an animator on Snowwhite\n\nAlan Legard 0:38\n\nI believe. Oh, right. Yes.\n\nRichard Marden 0:40\n\nAnyway, he was producing it for Walt. And we were all there. And his staff said, Thank you, I'll come back tomorrow, I will run it reel by reel far as I remember he came back, we started screening the next day reel by reel in the morning. And he had his finger on absolutely everything that he had thought about the day before. Can we do this? Can we do that? What happened about that? What happened about that?\n\nAlan Legard 1:11\n\nWas this sort of very detailed as always, it sort of just general?\n\nI mean, it was, it seemed,\n\nRichard Marden 1:16\n\nI mean, certainly in terms of story and character, in the sense of, haven't we got a shot that doesn't look right, come we got a shot, reveal a bit more of a genre away in there or something like that. And he had his director there Ken Anakin and his script writer, and it was all very amicable. And he knew exactly what he wanted to see he knew exactly the way it should be. And he sat through until I suppose we probably went on into the afternoon. Yeah. That was it. And he did. Thank you all very much shook us all by the hands of all and you shake man the Disney\n\nAlan Legard 1:56\n\ndid he then expect to see the result of your re read? No, he\n\nRichard Marden 2:00\n\nleft and he went back, I went back home and left it to Pierce . As far as I know, I'd whether whether Pilc\n\nAlan Legard 2:09\n\nso he's not as sad as your hands on producing. That's pretty good. I always thought of them as the animator and then the big executive, but he really was,\n\nRichard Marden 2:18\n\nI think, everything I'd ever heard about him, you know, Pilc from whether Pilc over with him for to show it to him a lot. I don't know cuz I didn't I wasn't on film anymore. But certainly having talked to Peter Britner?, because Peter worked a lot with Disney. And I think that he always know that Peter went over to Los Angeles for with with films for Disney And he will be interesting about that, because I'm pretty sure that whatever Peters ever told me is it Walt saw everything and talked about it and and he would have no nonsense in the sense of if he had some, according to Peter, if he had some rough guidelines and say, well, oh, yeah. Well, Peter, you can do that by tomorrow or Thursday. I will see you come to that Peter in Kenya.\n\nAlan Legard 3:05\n\nSo very well organised.\n\nRichard Marden 3:07\n\nAnd I shouldn't preempt Peter. But good point. Yeah. But it's something that I think that you know, he was a man who at that time knew not a hands on producer and also one has to remember that then, on their first time I ever come across it. The whole film was storyboarded, from beginning to end. Each shot was what it was, it was there was no deviation from it, it was painted out, drawn out the director put ths camera, there put that lens on. And that was what he was that actually went on in that shot. And then it went to this shot. And so in the sense that Disney was\n\nAlan Legard 3:49\n\ngoing back to the animation,\n\nRichard Marden 3:51\n\nexactly, that he would know exactly what his picture is going to look like. And in the sense, you could say that is really where all his films are picturebook picturebook films. They're not that reel a bit now. Because they're drawing a real life. It's all the same. But that's changed since his death. But but so that was that then we went nice\n\nAlan Legard 4:16\n\nto hear good things about Disney because he\n\ngave him a bad press\n\nprogramme about him on television.\n\nRichard Marden 4:23\n\nI mean, I think it's the fascist, I'm sure he probably was. But I've given you the the differences. But people, talented people in their own field aren't necessarily particularly pleasant, amiable or clever in any other field\n\nAlan Legard 4:39\n\nsounds though he might be a rather nice motivator.\n\nRichard Marden 4:42\n\nBut I mean, he was very pleasant to us at that time. He was probably I didn't know I saw that programme. and a lot of it made sense to me, because I could see Be the sort of simplest in a sense, simple. soul well, you know, I've been alright they should all be pleased. employing them. We don't want any unAmerican nonsense here. Rather uncomplicated, foolish and dangerous when you have power. Perhaps Yeah. But you know, I can't speak any other thing to 20 minutes that I saw him you know . But then well i think one went on to another film Pickwick Papers, which was directed by Noel Langley and rest of it adapted by Noel Langley. The first film he had done he directed produced by George Minter for Renown photograph by Wilkie Cooper and edited by Annie Coates . I was met Annie and I was per for . She asked me this week it was the first pictures you ever cut. I was could I be her first asistant And so we've remained very good friends ever since. Yes. And so I unfortunate was ill towards the end of it and couldn't finish it. But but it was Annies his first picture and I think she coped with it very very Well, I mean, I not being patronising Annie Look, I think she's, she knew what she was about. Yeah.\n\nAlan Legard 6:11\n\nVery nice lady and she and I went along to that BAFTA evening when she was interviewed by Sam Sidney Samuelsson Oh, yes. Saw a Tribute To her ? I thought it came when she came over so well.\n\nRichard Marden 6:24\n\nNo, she's a dear soul Well, I mean, we see Joe she was over my she came over supper with me. Last year customers over from Los Angeles I was hoping to go to the states in February I forgot to she's there. Now that she edited that and James Hayter plays Pickwick Nigel Patrick was in it. who played Mr Jingle. James Donald played.\n\nAlan Legard 6:51\n\nI remember that\n\nRichard Marden 6:52\n\nKathleen Harrison Mrs. Bardell my god and Hermione Baddley though she was Mrs. Bardell Kathleen. I can't remember. Yeah, I know, Kathleen Harrison Hermione Baddley. And Hermione Gingold . She played the headmistress of the seminary for young lady. Where did you shoot that Walton That was shot at Walton\n\nAlan Legard 7:13\n\ndid some quite big films there\n\nRichard Marden 7:15\n\nthey did a small studio. They did and it looked very good. And it was James Donald played the athletic one of the trio or what? Not I don't whatever doesn't matter.\n\nAnd that would that was on the box, not someone that's not a bad movie? I mean, it's an adaptation those\n\nAlan Legard 7:41\n\ndays as if they were making those sort of comparatively, not necessarily big scale but complex films. And there they would they would make money and just you know, get them on, you know, yes. This was really the heyday,\n\nRichard Marden 7:56\n\nof course, the price would by modern standards be nothing and then probably about £120,000. I mean, you've got to multiply which I sped things up to over a million but yes, but even so even though there's still a feasible,\n\nAlan Legard 8:11\n\nsomething of that size that could get their money back make a profit\n\nRichard Marden 8:15\n\nwas after that, that does do that. As I've said, much earlier Godfrey Gennison is my oldest friend, and we've been friends Happily Ever since natural\n\nAlan Legard 8:25\n\nnow or was it? Was he still at Crown film unit ? Yes, he was still at Crown\n\nRichard Marden 8:29\n\nSo with Bob and so was Arthur . And it was around about the time that when Crown closed, folded, folded early 52. It was like that's right. When I was finishing off on Pickwick papers, I think. And Godfrey told me that he had often asked that I had thought that they would try and get together and form a little company to make whatever they could make with the idea that everybody would take a job until something came up, and then you do what you could when it came along.\n\nAlan Legard 8:58\n\nAnd these are this is the phoenix rising from the ashes of of Crown film unit It's a wonderful little close down by the government in 1952. Spring.\n\nRichard Marden 9:10\n\nAnd he asked me if I'd be interested. And I said, Well, yes, I would, because it sounds fun and interesting thing to do.\n\nSo we got you'd Godfrey have to correct I think we only put in five pounds each may have been 10 pounds. I have a seat with five pounds of money, which we'll buy some stationery so that you could least have a letter of heading and so\n\nthere was we didn't have an office with where there was an office in the photographic shop in Harrow, which belonged to other people from Crown, whose names one of whom I spoke to the other day, because Julian Spyler had asked me by the name editing about of nice Have he'd won Julian and left a telephone number some I can't read. I can't remember his name. Godfrey will remember it might come to me in the course of the day, but certainly people lived in Harrows they lived in Harrow had a photographic shop. And and we were allowed to use the part of their place to an address. And the first film that came along was a 16 millimetre silent film for the Educational Supplies Association about a aircraft hangar door, which was being made for the Brabazon hangar, oh my goodness, or something like that. And as far as I remember, it Sid Sharples Sid was sort of in charge of except I knew it was going on. And then there's Bob Angel we're talking about now, I'm skipping a bit and you have to talk to the others and look at the history of the Godfrey standard. But what happened was that it became quite apparent that you couldn't really do both. That's to say, try and work and then make yourself available, whatever you could do when the job came up. And it coincided 51 50 to 52 when we were going with the hangover of 3d in the Festival of Britain. Oh, yes. And the old NFT that used to have 3d\n\nAlan Legard 11:42\n\nthat my previous Yeah.festival of Britain. Yeah.\n\nRichard Marden 11:45\n\nSo 3d still little films needed to be made. Bob had a connection with stereo techniques. Spottiswode was Bob Raymond and Nigel Spottiswoode, him and somebody else and they needed a bit of product. So we did a film. Again, I wasn't involved because I have no reason to be involved because nothing that I could contribute to it, which was about Madeira called Summer Island with Bob and Godfrey went out therev I think Arthur did\n\nAlan Legard 12:18\n\nand Aquila,\n\nRichard Marden 12:20\n\nour Aquila airlines flew them out that Casa de Portugal paid for the hotel accommodation, was shot in Ferrania colour. And it was shot by the great a great camera man. We all know, and I forgotten his name. And then he is and his original day wasWolfgang Suschitzy Suschitzy was shot by Sushitzky shot by him. And Bob, I think put it together and that was all done. And throughout then, we had another one. Which with because they thought they needed more product. And we made one called Vintage 28 which I did get involved in, which is vintage 28 which was a wine was it no it was a it was a it was Bentley motorcar Right? And this has to do with old vintage motor cars. And we Bob directed and sort of wrote it with Lord Montague using his estate for those who get cars from it. The young man called Desmond Montgomery was supposedly GI came and looked at a lot of vintage motor cars , Julian Orchard play the sort of Vega was added with a 20 minute thought of what was issued on ferrania. Now this was black and white 35 35 and we shot this down in various places. But I put it together we dubbed it and did all this and then we thought well, we ought to have a screening because we need we need to get agencies and people together to come and see this. So we hiredthe old National Film Theatre . One morning we ran Summer e Island. Vintage 28 we got Aqua airways to fly over some Madeira cake and the Casa de Portugal. Clouds some wine made a little sort t of do have it. Yeah. I felt terribly important as the launching of film Partners thought Oh, this is all wonderful way to do nothing. But that's not quite true. It went on and we did another film but you have your own premises eventually. Well, yes. We moved to Wembley, actually at this round about this time to move to a little office at Wembley, and we're now the cutting room in Wembley, when Gilkerson was there with Rays and various other little mushroom companies were there. And we did Vintage 28. from there we also did a film for the Petroleum Company, which came to us from film centre who were kind and they said, we've got all these rushes right, this burning oil well in the Qatar Peninsula, all in Ferrania colour Will you put them break them finish them into a film for us 10 minutes\n\nAlan Legard 15:43\n\nwhen when we john Phelan was out in\n\nRichard Marden 15:46\n\nBaghdad. And so we thought this is wonderful. And it mentioned, just take out the trash and finish it by the way through to a bad print that was going on. And so we had to be competitive. And we did whatever we thought was a sensible budget. And we went to back to the film centre who were very good to us very sensible people and said Now look, you said you can do it to this. Your case? You probably could. But what you haven't thought about is the overhead of the fact that you seem to think that the chairman of the Petroleum Company will come see when you want him to. He won't, he'll be abroad. This is going to take much longer than you think. And you got to pay for overhead. So work it out, and we'd tell him that we did. And it was very sensible because they thought otherwise these people are gonna go mad. But\n\nAlan Legard 16:45\n\nyeah, but then of course they would be.\n\nRichard Marden 16:47\n\nRight. Yes. So they were very good, being realistic and being totally realistic. And so we did that. And then quite all worked out. We did. Queen Mary died. And that was the 3d one. That was 3d Queen Mary's funeral in three d. Yes. I remember that\n\nAlan Legard 17:03\n\nout in I'm just seeing that in the cinema, I think\n\nRichard Marden 17:05\n\nyes, he was on at five news theatres on certainly in the West End, because I remember we all went to see we took a news theatre each. I've got the Cameo in Piccadilly and I seem to have the most ghastly they can have they've got left on the right eye .\n\nAlan Legard 17:20\n\nOh my\n\nAlan Lawson 17:21\n\nwrong way round gosh, it goes cross eyed\n\nRichard Marden 17:24\n\nand people coming out of mystery that I'm bloody blind. They couldn't get into the box,he wouldn't let me in. Anyway, they got it sorted out.\n\nAlan Legard 17:34\n\nIt had a nickname that termed it Bob Bob Angel gave it a nickname. I walked with it, I can't remember a coffin in your lap.\n\nThat's right a coffin in your lap They got\n\nUnknown Speaker 17:46\n\nsomething about the 3d camera\n\nRichard Marden 17:49\n\nthe 3d camera that they had. There were two Newman Sinclair cameras, which were facing each other with a mirror so the lens was in front of the mirrors. And so that was like that. Now that I think Stereo Techniques did actually then build a proper camera. And I think it was made by Vintens , but whether anything very much was ever shot on it. Whether it was using the two cameras facing each other with a mirror in between, or whether it was in fact two cameras lying side by side. I can't remember Godfrey or Bob or Arthur would be the ones to ask because they are not. They had two separate categories. They all were all bounded on one set. Basically it was one object because it was just one very difficult not unwieldy thing to do. But it was Bob and Arthur and Godfrey would know much more about it than I do because that was their field which wasn't mine I saw it but it was never I didn't understand all the technicalities of it\n\nAlan Lawson 19:09\n\nextraordinary good quality wasn't it I remember\n\nRichard Marden 19:11\n\nit was good quality and and Did you see the Spottiswode Raymond was film land or less his brother Nigel who was the optical man was because he made he designed lighthouse optical and in fact Nigel only died about four years ago because I remember reading I think the media obit about him and Nigel was a very quiet man . And Roger, Spottiswode was Reubens son successful Hollywood the nice guy and because last time I saw Roger to talk to which was about 10 years. We'll We're in Los Angeles. I said, What about Nigel I said your arms was slightly libellous as well. Now Joel met up with a sort of a very attractive rather brassy lady and I'm not sure whether she was in showbiz or not, who Raymond couldn't stand obviously totally different characters and as far as I could make out the vibe that just knew them at that time she was amiable as I say rather brassy lady whether she'd been a chorus girl or wasn't a chorus I don't know that may be just too good to be true then we all finished split up their own things years ago by the Roger Pen. So whatever happened to man he said, oh, I've noticed Well, they got divorced of course it didn't work if situations favourable settle and she I think actually did marry into the aristocracy I think Nigel went back to lighthouse designing. Of course, poor old Raymond was killed, but car crash was\n\nAlan Legard 21:13\n\nhe kill? I didn't I'd forgotten that.\n\nRichard Marden 21:16\n\nI knew he died comparatively. Oh, yes, he was killed. fastest car. I think back in\n\nAlan Legard 21:22\n\n70 is he was in the 70s remember people going down to his funeral.\n\nRichard Marden 21:27\n\nAnd, but so film partnership went on. And I,\n\nAlan Legard 21:33\n\nI think remember you had two premises in Great Portland street. They were they were But after I left it, I\n\nleft it by\n\nRichard Marden 21:40\n\nabout a year or so because, well, all amicabally because we're all still great friends. But I felt I was interested with basically what features much more\n\nAlan Legard 21:51\n\nif you've asked, quite a person changed working on sort of, I\n\nRichard Marden 21:54\n\nthink I wouldn't get him away from the studio, or anything. I think it was great fun. And I think we all enjoyed ourselves. I think we also all found ourselves need to try and make a bit more\n\nAlan Legard 22:07\n\nmoney. Well, this is the problem and it's always has to be in a documentary working with films you do have a problem but\n\nRichard Marden 22:14\n\nand so I quite amicably with I decided, you know, I'd like to go back into freelance work again and so on. And so then that Michael John's took my place\n\nAlan Legard 22:28\n\nwell, he took over as a as the editor.\n\nRichard Marden 22:30\n\nAnd then they moved to Great Portland street and they managed to getrather anmazed? because there was this problem of getting work and the problem of money. We were be underfunded anyway. And although there was somebody that came in after I had left nice man Godfrey tell you all about him who helped with brought some money in\n\nAlan Legard 22:52\n\nbut didn't didn't Richard Dimbleby become chairman. Well,\n\nRichard Marden 22:55\n\nwhat happened was that after that, they amalgamated Richard Dimbleby have a company called Curtain films. So Dimbleby appeared to film partnerships to films TFTS as it were were amalgamated, which gave them some extra clout. And there's a funny story, I'm sure Bob must have told you. under the banner of TFS films, they were make a film for the Church of England, Bob. I think it was the Bishop of Guilford, and god forbid excuse but my name is Angel appeared in films. But that's Bob story so . shouldn't be at that. So they and then Godfrey went up to Manchester golf, Godfrey got married in fifty six, to Pat They opened a branch in Manchester. And so what happened was that this went on to the film film partnership, I suppose I'd have to look it up but probably into about the late 50s, early 60s, and then it became part that people needed to do more of themselves. So they were doing that. I went on into feature back into the features back into the feature system, then\n\nfifty three, fifty four,\n\nI worked with Russ Lloyd on the seashore.at Camden? and with John Trumper assistant to set them on Escapade.\n\nAlan Legard 24:44\n\nAre you on that way. So\n\nthat was\n\nRichard Marden 24:48\n\nPhilip Leacock that was Philip Leacock . And then then I went to going field outing from either out this last year when I went Work for Rank screen saudiences . We did a film about documentary film about the longs. boat people who know the canal boat people say what's called Rank screen audiences when screen audiences it was in the Hilstead? I think it was in those day? And then one of those rather strange stories which I don't put any credence to because I'm not I don't think superstitious. Why was it Rank Screen audiences? Who had time for the work very much to do. And the girls in the office started playing this tumbler game, you know, which is like a planchette. Except you put your fingers on the sout Yes, yeah, I do cut out the letters of the alphabet and put them on the circle. And again, I knew theoretically, if you ask anybody there, the tumbler is supposed to move and spells out messages. Naturally, when you go and play this game, which I was called into. You want something to happen. But you I don'y recall ever. Anybody actually pushed it anyway. While I was working at screen audiences John had rung me up John Trumper. And said, Could I dub Partnet of Islands for him? And I said, I can't, because I'm still working screen audiences at that time. I thought that was that So once you've turned something down, you never expected to come back. Because you have to make that arrangement about so I went on. And then this film that I was doing was coming to an end of though finishing off in about a week. And this was when I went out to play this silly game. And this is not a word of a lie It said, there was a message for me with uncertainty and message coming in. And it said, new job soon What I did the wishful thinking . I didn't have any conscious thought of pushing it. And then I said something, I think if it tells me the name or the initials of the producer or something, and it went to JL didn't me anything , to me at all. So that was that the next day, the phone rings was John Trumper on the line again and said, Martin whatever his name was was dubbing the picture, had been taken ill and she can't go on or . What was my position about that? I said, Well, matter of fact, I think I can get away in about a week because I finished this. And it was produced by Jimmy Laurel\n\nAlan Legard 27:27\n\nFunny National Film Finance Corporation.\n\nRichard Marden 27:30\n\nAnd so this nonsense I put it in for what its worth\n\nAlan Legard 27:34\n\ngood. Now you're a believer in all this. So? Yeah.\n\nRichard Marden 27:38\n\nSo then I worked with with John and John and I've"
