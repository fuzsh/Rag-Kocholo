        "text": "Sir Cedric Hardwicke, the actor, died here yesterday of a chronic lung ailment. He was 71 years old.\n\nSir Cedric had been admitted to University Hospital three weeks ago after a long illness. His doctors said he suffered from emphysema, a distension of the lung sacs, which makes breathing difficult.\n\nWhen Cedric Hardwicke earned a knighthood in 1934 for his Shavian performances, he was the youngest theatrical performer ever to have achieved that honor. In the years that followed, he became known to American audiences for mature and dignified characterizations entirely suitable for a “Sir.”\n\nAt the time he received Britain's high honor he had never appeared in America. After that, he rarely acted anywhere else. While he proudly guarded the English citizenship that gave him his title, he became one of the most familiar personalities in Hollywood films —the personification of the British gentleman, conservative, aloof and impeccably polite.\n\nIt was a rewarding characterization, and he played it well. Sir Cedric was never a movie star, and in the ranks of supporting actors he usually did exactly that—support. His notices were sometimes excellent, invariably respectful. To the general public, he was a familiar face whose name hovered on the tip of the tongue.\n\nIn the theater, Sir Cedric was very much a star. Typically, however, two of his most notable Broadway successes, in “Caesar and Cleopatra” and as the Japanese businessman in “A Majority of One,” were in complementary adjunction to glittering actresses, Lilli Palmer and Gertrude Berg.\n\nQuite possibly the finest acting he ever did was in Charles Laughton's staged reading of “Don Juan in Hell.” In that George Bernard Shaw exercise in dialectic, he played the statue. Most of his performance, and certainly his most memorable effects, consisted of attitudinizing, with an eloquent “harrumph” and a devastating flip of a page, while Mr. Laughton, Charles Boyer and Agnes Moorehead articulated the meaty Shavian hyperbole.\n\nCedric Webster Hardwicke was born in Lye, Stourbridge, Worcester, on Feb. 19, 1893. His father, a physician, experienced the traditional British horror of his son's chosen profession in the theater, but nevertheless financed him through his studies at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts.\n\nSir Cedric credited George Bernard Shaw with helping to make the actor an acceptable member of society. “He fought as nobody else did for recognition of the actor as an intelligent member of the community,” the actor recalled a few years ago.\n\nShaw became a personal friend when the young actor was appearing in his plays at the Birmingham Repertory Theater. “Shaw was a sort of godfather to me,” Sir Cedric said. The playwright closely supervised the productions as the actor created the roles of Captain Shotover in “Heartbreak House” and the He‐Ancient in “Back to Methuselah.”\n\nThis high point in Sir Cedric's career came after he had followed the usual fledgling actor's route, touring the provinces in small parts in classics and trivia. “I played Hamlet at 14, and got that out of my system,” he said. His London debut was in 1912, in a walk‐on as a gentleman of the court in “The Monk and the Woman.” Then came World War I, and seven years with the army, ending as a captain in France.\n\nHe joined the Birmingham company early in 1922, and created there, in addition to the other plays, the role of King Magnus in the first production of Shaw's “The Apple Cart.” He moved on to London in this play, and began the series of diversified roles that led to his knighthood. Critics admired him as Captain Andy in “Show Boat,” the sadistic father in “The Barretts of Wimpole Street,” a sympathetic doctor in “The Late Christopher Bean” and the exiled Russian prince in “Tovarich.”\n\n“Dreyfus” was his first leading film assignment, in 1931. Hollywood called him for the priest in “Les Miserables,” with Mr. Laughton and Fredric March in 1935, and then he appeared in one of the early Technicolor films, “Becky Sharp.” He made his Broadway debut in Henri Bernstein's “Promise” in 1936. It failed, and so did “The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse.” His first Broadway long run was as Canon Skerritt in Paul Vincent Carroll's “Shadow and Substance,” in 1938.\n\nSince then he alternated between Broadway and Hollywood, sometimes directing—he had a notable success with Gertrude Lawrence in “Pygmalion” in 1946 — but usually just acting. “I'm the only actor I know who never wanted to do anything else,” he once said.\n\nHe played Burgess to Katharine Cornell's “Candida” and Creon to her. “Antigone” in 1946. His hit revival of “Caesar and Cleopatra” came in 1949; “Don Juan in Hell” in 1951 —it also had a long and highly successful tour—and “A Majority of One” in 1959. He also appeared in a respectable number of flops—in all, more than 30 plays in New York and stock.\n\nAmong his better film roles were “The Moon Is Down;” “Wilson”; as Mr. Brink in “On Borrowed Time”; and Livingstone in ‘Stanley and Livingstone,” “The Keys of the Kingdom” and “A Womans Vengeance.” He was particularly praised in Anthony Asquith's British‐made “The Winslow Boy,” playing a determined father whose son is expelled from school for petty theft, and who fights the case over a period of years to victory in Parliament.\n\nHe acted for Alfred Hitchcock in “Rope” and for George Stevens in “I Remember Mama.” In these films, he had small roles and gave well‐received performances. He also appeared, to lesser applause, in “The Ten Commandments” and “Around the World in 80 Days,” and as a somewhat senile king in Laurence Olivier's “Richard III.”\n\nHe acted often on television, but without outstanding success. He also wrote his autobiography twice — “Let's Pretend: Recollections and Reflections of a Lucky Actor” in 1932, and, while playing in “A Majority of One,” “A Victorian in Orbit.” He wanted to call the last one “Fifty Years Without Being Found Out.”\n\nIn private, Sir Cedric was a dry wit, a club man and a raconteur. He married and was divorced twice. Both wives were actresses — Helena Pickard, 1928 to 1950, and Mary Scott, 1950 to 1961. He had sons by both wives, Edward, now 32 and an actor, and Michael.\n\nAlthough Sir Cedric made a considerable amount of money during his career, he was not well off financially in his later years, according to his friends. One friend said yesterday that Sir Cedric liked to spend money as fast as he earned it and being “flat broke” did not really disturb him.\n\nAn associate said that Sir Cedric did not let financial problems make him unhappy. He would smile and shrug his shoulders, the associate said, because it was a regular part of his life and his friends understood.\n\nThree years ago, he summed up his private life: “The more I see of life, the more I prefer the world of the theater to the real world.”\n\nA funeral service will be held on Monday at 12 at the Universal Chapel, 52d Street at Lexington Avenue."
