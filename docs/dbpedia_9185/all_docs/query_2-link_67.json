        "text": "I think it unlikely.\n\nLithuanian rule over the territory known as Edisan was largely nominal. The region was almost uninhabited, the only people living there being a few nomadic tribes.\n\nPreviously the region had been under the nominal sovereignty of the Khanate of Crimea, which had inherited it from the Khanate of Kipchak when the latter broke up into separate states.\n\nThere were no towns in the region, only a few encampments or villages of the resident nomads, so there was no base from which a Lithuanian navy could operate.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odessa\n\nIn the Middle Ages successive rulers of the Odessa region included various nomadic tribes (Petchenegs, Cumans), the Golden Horde, the Crimean Khanate, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and the Ottoman Empire. Yedisan Crimean Tatars traded there in the 14th century.\n\nDuring the reign of Khan Hacı I Giray of Crimea (1441–1466), the Khanate was endangered by the Golden Horde and the Ottoman Turks and, in search of allies, the khan agreed to cede the area to Lithuania. The site of present-day Odessa was then a town known as Khadjibey (named for Hacı I Giray, and also spelled Kocibey in English, Hacıbey or Hocabey in Turkish, and Hacıbey in Crimean Tatar). It was part of the Dykra region. However, most of the rest of the area remained largely uninhabited in this period.\n\nKhadjibey came under direct control of the Ottoman Empire after 1529 as part of a region known as Yedisan, and was administered in the Ottoman Silistra (Özi) Province. In the mid-18th century, the Ottomans rebuilt a fortress at Khadjibey (also was known Hocabey), which was named Yeni Dünya (literally \"New World\"). Hocabey was a sanjak centre of Silistre Province.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yedisan\n\nIn the early medieval period, Yedisan was home to Ulichs, Pechenegs, and later Cumans (Polovtsians). Following the Mongol invasions of the thirteenth century it was under control of the Khanate of the Golden Horde. In the fifteenth century it fell to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (when it was known as Dykra) then later to the Ottoman Empire's vassal state, the Crimean Khanate. The nomadic Nogais began to inhabit the region after being forced first from Central Asia to the Kuban region. From there, one of the hordes moved westward after 1724 and gave its name to Yedisan, although Yedisan is anachronistically marked as such before the arrival of the Nogais on many contemporary historical maps.\n\nSo far as I know, the only merchant shipping in the Black Sea during the 14th Century was operated by the Genoese. The Genoese built a fort at the mouth of the Dniester River, today called Bilhorod Dnistrovskyi in Ukrainian, but previously known as Akkerman in Turkish. Both names mean \"white fortress\". The Genoese also built forts in the Crimea, near Balaklava for instance.\n\nIt is possible that people coming from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania had contacts with Genoese traders on the Black Sea coast in the region of the present Odessa, but I have never read anything about that in the many books I have read about the history of Ukraine.\n\nYes, the cession of the Edisan region to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by the Khanate of Crimea might be compared to the Louisiana Purchase by the United States.\n\nIn both cases, what was being transferred was a claim to a particular area rather than actual control. In the case of the Louisiana Purchase, the United States did not actually gain control over the huge area of land it had bought from France until that land was colonised by settlers.\n\nIn the case of the Edisan region, it was never colonised by settlers from the Lithuanian lands during the period of Nominal Lithuanian rule in the 15th Century, primarily because the steppe lands were not suited to the sort of agriculture practised by the Eastern Slavs, which was based on cutting down trees and burning them to fertilise the soil. Furthermore, the traditional Russian plough, the sokha, was not strong enough to cultivate thick grassland.\n\nAs you probably know, the Wild Field was not settled by peasants from the Russian Empire until the 19th Century, when modern agricultural technology was introduced.\n\nAs the article I posted stated, there was a small Tatar village on the site of the present Odessa, but it was trading post for steppe nomads, not a major seaport.\n\nIf you would like to read a book about the colonisation of the Wild Field by the Russian Empire, I can recommend this one:\n\n\"Taming the Wild Field: Colonisation and Empire on the Russian Steppe\" by Willard Sunderland (published by Cornell University Press, 2004).\n\nMichael - first of all, Bilhorod and Akkerman were two different places, not the same port (they were located several kilometers from each other). Secondly, those ports never belonged to Lithuania because they are located in Moldavia, not in Yedisan.\n\nThe coastline area under Lithuanian control was known as Yedisan. There were two coastal towns in that region - Hadjibai (Turkish: Yeni Dünya; Polish: Chadżybej), today known as Odessa; and Ochakiv (Turkish: Achi-Kale).\n\nIn the 15th century the area was inhabited by Kipchaks and Slavs (Ulichs), not by Tatars (Tatars settled there after 1526):\n\n\"In the early Middle Ages areas of Yedisan were inhabited by nomadic Kipchak tribes and by settled Slavic groups. After the Mongol invasion this area became part of the Golden Horde. In the 14th century the area briefly belonged to the Principality of Moldavia, and in the 15th century it became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1526 Yedisan became an Ottoman province. It was then when Crimean Tatars and Nogai Tatars started to settle in Yedisan.\"\n\nApart from Hadjibai (Odessa), there was also Ochakiv. Here is what wikipedia says about the history of Ochakiv (Kara Kermen):\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ochakiv\n\n\"Ochakiv was founded in 14th century, named after the Turkish fortress Achi-Kale. It stands close to the site of the old Miletan (ancient Greek) colony of Olbia, and the Greek colony of Alektor. Strong fortifications were built at Ochakiv and on the Kinburn promontory, to protect the entrance to the Dnieper, by the medieval Poles and then by Crimean khan Meñli I Giray in 1492 when it was known as Kara Kerman [or Kara Kermen?]. Several decades later, the fortress fell to the Ottomans and was subsequently known as Özi.\"\n\n==============================\n\nThere was also a short episode with Caffa (Teodosia) - in 1462 the city of Caffa pledged allegiance to Casimir IV (king of Poland and grand duke of Lithuania), and on 01.11.1462 Casimir accepted the request. But in 1484 Caffa was captured by the Turks.\n\n==============================\n\nThere was also access to Black Sea ports via Moldavia. Moldavia was a vassal state of the kingdom of Poland in period ca. 1387 - ca. 1499. That area had two ports - Bilhorod (Polish: Białogród) at the Dniester and Kilia (Kilja) at the Danube (Kilia was more important).\n\nThe main trade route was: Sandomierz <---> Lvov <---> Kamyanets <---> Suceava <---> Jassy <---> Kilia and Bilhorod.\n\nThat trade, however, ended for some time when the Turks captured Kilia in year 1484.\n\nKilia:\n\nMap of the area (as you can see Akerman was not just another name for Bilhorod, but it was a different town):"
