It's Port is called \"Voruta\"\n\nFlag[]\n\nThe Flag consists of colours found in the Lithuanian Flag and Coat of Arms. To Amplify it's relation to Lithuania and the fact it's not an independent Country, the Vytis has been placed prominently in the center of attention. Since it's a safe haven for Lithuanians in case of occupation, the red part standing for bloodshed is deemed illogical and therefore replaced with a more appropriate color. The blue shade from the coat of arms represents the tropical water it's surrounded with and the security it provides. Two additional white stripes have been added to amplify it's relations with god and the bible who provided comfort and hope at such dark times.\n\nTrivia[]"
