Life

Max Planck was born in Kiel. After studies in Munich, he later became a professor in Berlin. Planck was both an influential scientist and a central figure within the German scientific community. During World War I he worked to minimize the impact of the war on international research collaborations. When the Nazis took power, he felt it his duty to remain in his position and try to defend independent research despite the concessions this required with a regime he disliked.

Work

When a black body is heated, electromagnetic radiation is emitted with a spectrum corresponding to the temperature of the body, and not to its composition. Calculating the form of the spectrum using then-known physical laws gave an unreasonable result; the radiation in the high-frequency area of the spectrum became infinite. Max Planck solved this problem in 1900 by introducing the theory of “quanta”, that is, that radiation consists of quanta with specific energies determined by a new fundamental constant, thereafter called Planck’s constant.
