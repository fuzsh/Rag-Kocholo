Most prestigious among scientific prizes internationally is the Nobel Prize. Since its founding in 1948 the Max Planck Society can boast 24 Nobel Prize winners among its ranks. In addition, 15 Nobel Prizes were awarded to scientists from its predecessor organization, the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, between 1914 and 1948. Furthermore, many Max Planck Society scientists and researchers are winners of a number of scientific and academic awards from Germany and other countries, such as the German Leibniz Prize, the Japan Prize or the Fields Medal."
