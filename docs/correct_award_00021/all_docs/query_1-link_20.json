        "text": "Association of German research institutes\n\nThe Max Planck Society for the Advancement of Science (German: Max-Planck-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Wissenschaften e. V.; abbreviated MPG) is a formally independent non-governmental and non-profit association of German research institutes. Founded in 1911 as the Kaiser Wilhelm Society,[1][3] it was renamed to the Max Planck Society in 1948 in honor of its former president, theoretical physicist Max Planck. The society is funded by the federal and state governments of Germany.[2][1]\n\nAccording to its primary goal, the Max Planck Society supports fundamental research in the natural, life and social sciences, the arts and humanities in its 86 (as of December 2018)[2] Max Planck Institutes.[1][3] The society has a total staff of approximately 17,000 permanent employees, including 5,470 scientists, plus around 4,600 non-tenured scientists and guests.[2] The society's budget for 2018 was about €1.8 billion.[2] As of 31 December 2018, the Max Planck Society employed a total of 23,767 staff, of whom 15,650 were scientists. 44.4% were female employees and 31.5% of all of the employees were foreign nationals.[4]\n\nThe Max Planck Society has a world-leading reputation as a science and technology research organization, with 39 Nobel Prizes awarded to their scientists, and is widely regarded as one of the foremost basic research organizations in the world. In 2020, the Nature Index placed the Max Planck Institutes third worldwide in terms of research published in Nature journals (after the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Harvard University).[5] In terms of total research volume (unweighted by citations or impact), the Max Planck Society is only outranked by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Russian Academy of Sciences and Harvard University in the Times Higher Education institutional rankings.[6] The Thomson Reuters-Science Watch website placed the Max Planck Society as the second leading research organization worldwide following Harvard University in terms of the impact of the produced research over science fields.[7]\n\nThe Max Planck Society and its predecessor Kaiser Wilhelm Society hosted several renowned scientists in their fields, including Otto Hahn, Werner Heisenberg, and Albert Einstein.\n\nThe Max Planck Society also hosts the Cornell, Maryland, and Max Planck Pre-Doctoral Research School, an intense week of lectures, informal conversations with guest faculty and fellow students from all over the world, professional development panels with academic and industrial speakers, research poster sessions, and social events.\n\nThe organization was established in 1911 as the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, or Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft (KWG), a non-governmental research organization named for the then German emperor. The KWG was one of the world's leading research organizations; its board of directors included scientists like Walther Bothe, Peter Debye, Albert Einstein, and Fritz Haber. In 1946, Otto Hahn assumed the position of president of KWG, and in 1948, the society was renamed the Max Planck Society (MPG) after its former president (1930–37) Max Planck, who died in 1947.[8]\n\nThe Max Planck Society has a world-leading reputation as a science and technology research organization. In 2006, the Times Higher Education Supplement rankings[9] of non-university research institutions (based on international peer review by academics) placed the Max Planck Society as No.1 in the world for science research, and No.3 in technology research (behind AT&T Corporation and the Argonne National Laboratory in the United States).\n\nThe domain mpg.de attracted at least 1.7 million visitors annually by 2008 according to a Compete.com study.[10]\n\nAdolf von Harnack (1911–1930)\n\nMax Planck (1930–1937)\n\nCarl Bosch (1937–1940)\n\nAlbert Vögler (1941–1945)\n\nMax Planck (16 May 1945 – 31 March 1946)\n\nOtto Hahn (as President of the KWG 1946 and then as Founder and President of the MPG 1948–1960)\n\nAdolf Butenandt (1960–1972)\n\nReimar Lüst (1972–1984)\n\nHeinz Staab (1984–1990)\n\nHans F.

Calls for nominations for the award were invited on an annually rotating basis in specific sub-areas of the natural sciences and engineering, the life sciences, and the human and social sciences. The objective of the Max Planck Society and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in presenting this joint research award was to give added momentum to specialist fields that were either not yet established in Germany or that deserved to be expanded.[11]\n\nSince 2018, the award has been succeeded by the \"Max Planck-Humboldt Research Award\", annually awarded to an internationally renowned mid-career researcher with outstanding future potential from outside Germany but having a strong interest in a research residency in Germany for limited time periods, alternately in the fields of natural and engineering sciences, human sciences, and life sciences, as well as the \"Max Planck-Humboldt Medal\" awarded to other two finalists.[12][13][14][15]\n\nYear Award Name Institution Field 2023 Max Planck-Humboldt Research Award Rotem Sorek Weizmann Institute of Science Bacterial defense mechanisms against viruses Max Planck-Humboldt Medal Amy Buck University of Edinburgh Inter-species RNA communication Max Planck-Humboldt Medal Kandice Tanner National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health in Bethesda Biophysics of the metastatic spread of cancer 2022 Max Planck-Humboldt Research Award Margaret Roberts UCSD Censorship and Disinformation Max Planck-Humboldt Medal Vanessa Ogle Yale University Social Sciences Max Planck-Humboldt Medal Wim Decock Universities of Louvain-la-Neuve and Liége Social Sciences 2021 Max Planck-Humboldt Research Award Pablo Jarillo-Herrero MIT Quantum Materials Max Planck-Humboldt Medal Anastassia Alexandrova UCLA Theoretical Chemistry Max Planck-Humboldt Medal Sumit Gulwani Microsoft Automated Programming 2020 Max Planck-Humboldt Research Award Roberto Bonasio University of Pennsylvania Life sciences Max Planck-Humboldt Medal Luciano Marraffini Rockefeller University Life sciences 2019 Max Planck-Humboldt Research Award Ufuk Akcigit University of Chicago Macroeconomics Max Planck-Humboldt Medal Elliot Tucker-Drob University of Texas at Austin Personality and developmental psychology 2018 Max Planck-Humboldt Research Award Catherine Heymans University of Edinburgh Dark energy Max Planck-Humboldt Medal Robert Wood Harvard University Soft robotics Max Planck-Humboldt Medal Sam Payne University of Texas at Austin Tropical geometry\n\nYear Name Institution Field 2016 Bonnie Bassler Princeton University Sensory perception of organisms Martin Wikelski [de] Max Planck Institute for Ornithology 2015 Bryan Stanley Turner City University of New York Religion and modernity – secularisation, social and religious pluralism Hans Joas Humboldt University of Berlin 2014 Robert J.

Since June 2014, materials scientist Martin Stratmann has been the President of the Max Planck Society.[17]\n\nFunding is provided predominantly from federal and state sources, but also from research and license fees and donations. One of the larger donations was the castle Schloss Ringberg near Kreuth in Bavaria, which was pledged by Luitpold Emanuel in Bayern (Duke in Bavaria). It passed to the Society after the duke died in 1973, and is now used for conferences.\n\nThe Max Planck Society consists of over 80 research institutes.[18] In addition, the society funds a number of Max Planck Research Groups (MPRG) and International Max Planck Research Schools (IMPRS). The purpose of establishing independent research groups at various universities is to strengthen the required networking between universities and institutes of the Max Planck Society.\n\nThe research units are primarily located across Europe with a few in South Korea and the U.S. In 2007, the Society established its first non-European centre, with an institute on the Jupiter campus of Florida Atlantic University focusing on neuroscience.[19][20]\n\nThe Max Planck Institutes operate independently from, though in close cooperation with, the universities, and focus on innovative research that does not fit into the university structure due to its interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary nature or that require resources that cannot be met by the state universities.\n\nInternally, Max Planck Institutes are organized into research departments headed by directors such that each MPI has several directors, a position roughly comparable to anything from full professor to department head at a university. Other core members include Junior and Senior Research Fellows.[21]\n\nIn addition, there are several associated institutes:[18]\n\nName City Country Section Center of Advanced European Studies and Research Bonn Germany Biology & Medicine Ernst Strüngmann Institute Frankfurt am Main Germany Biology & Medicine\n\nMax Planck Society also has a collaborative center with Princeton University—Max Planck Princeton Research Center for Plasma Physics—located in Princeton, New Jersey, in the U.S.[22] The latest Max Planck Research Center has been established at Harvard University in 2016 as the Max Planck Harvard Research Center for the Archaeoscience of the Ancient Mediterranean.\n\nTogether with the Association of Universities and other Education Institutions in Germany, the Max Planck Society established numerous International Max Planck Research Schools (IMPRS) to promote junior scientists:\n\nCologne Graduate School of Ageing Research, Cologne[23]\n\nInternational Max Planck

At the Conference the Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities was passed. The Berlin Declaration built on previous open access declarations, but widened the research field to be covered by open access to include humanities and called for new activities to support open access such as “encouraging the holders of cultural heritage” to provide open access to their resources.[60]\n\nThe Max Planck Society continues to support open access in Germany and mandates institutional self-archiving of research outputs on the eDoc server and publications by its researchers in open access journals within 12 months.[61] To finance open access the Max Planck Society established the Max Planck Digital Library. The library also aims to improve the conditions for open access on behalf of all Max Planck Institutes by negotiating contracts with open access publishers and developing infrastructure projects, such as the Max Planck open access repository.[62]\n\nIn 2008, the European General Court ruled in a case brought by a PhD student against the Max Planck Society that \"a researcher preparing a doctoral thesis on the basis of a grant contract concluded with the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Wissenschaften eV, must be regarded as a worker within the meaning of Article 39 EC only if his activities are performed for a certain period of time under the direction of an institute forming part of that association and if, in return for those activities, he receives remuneration\".[63]\n\nIn 2012, the Max Planck Society was at the centre of a controversy about some PhD students being given employment contracts. Of the 5,300 students who at the time wrote their PhD thesis at the 80 Max Planck Institutes 2,000 had an employment contract. The remaining 3,300 received grants of between 1,000 and 1,365 Euro.[64] According to a 2011 statement by the Max Planck Society \"As you embark on a PhD, you are still anything but a proper scientist; it’s during the process itself that you become a proper scientist... a PhD is an apprenticeship in the lab, and as such it is usually not paid like a proper job – and this is, by and large, the practice at all research institutions and universities\".[65] The allegation of wage dumping for young scientists was discussed during the passing of the 2012 \"Wissenschaftsfreiheitsgesetz\" (Scientific Freedom Law) in the German Parliament.[66]\n\nIn February 2024, the Max Planck Society faced widespread criticism for terminating the employment of Lebanese-Australian professor Ghassan Hage from the Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology, citing his social media posts on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict as incompatible with the society's core values.[67] This decision was publicly condemned by numerous scholars and academic organizations, who argued it infringed on Hage's freedom of expression. German newspaper Welt am Sonntag initially reported on Hage's posts.[68][69] Following the dismissal, global academic communities, including Israeli scholars,[70] the German Association of Social and Cultural Anthropology,[71] the British Society for Middle Eastern Studies,[72] the European Association of Social Anthropologists,[73] the American Anthropological Association,[74] the Council for Humanities, Arts and Sciences and the Australian Anthropological Society,[75] the Canadian Anthropology Society,[76] a Japanese group of scholars,[77] the Australian Sociological Association,[78] rallied in support of Hage, extensively citing Hage's own intellectual work, urging the society to reverse its decision. The Max Planck Society and its President Patrick Cramer are yet to respond to these letters of support, worrying many that the Max Society no longer is committed to the core value of academic freedom and rather censors its own scientists for public statements and activism.[79][80] This concern is also tied to the Max Planck Society's unstinting public support of Israel.[81][82]\n\nFerenc Krausz, Nobel Prize, physics, 2023\n\nSvante Pääbo, Nobel Prize, medicine 2022\n\nBenjamin List, Nobel Prize, chemistry 2021\n\nKlaus Hasselmann, Nobel Prize, physics 2021\n\nEmmanuelle Charpentier, Nobel Prize, chemistry 2020\n\nReinhard Genzel, Nobel Prize, physics 2020\n\nStefan W.
