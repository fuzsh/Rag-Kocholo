        "text": "The Nobel Prize in Physics 1918 was awarded to Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck \"in recognition of the services he rendered to the advancement of Physics by his discovery of energy quanta\"\n\nMax Planck received his Nobel Prize one year later, in 1919. During the selection process in 1918, the Nobel Committee for Physics decided that none of the year's nominations met the criteria as outlined in the will of Alfred Nobel. According to the Nobel Foundation's statutes, the Nobel Prize can in such a case be reserved until the following year, and this statute was then applied. Max Planck therefore received his Nobel Prize for 1918 one year later, in 1919.\n\nTo cite this section\n\nMLA style: The Nobel Prize in Physics 1918. NobelPrize.org. Nobel Prize Outreach AB 2024.
