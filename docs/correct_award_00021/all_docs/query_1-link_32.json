        "text": "by Anders Bárány\n\n1. Quantum Mechanics and Nobel Prizes 1901-2014\n\nOn June 29 year 1900 the Nobel Foundation was born, by its Statutes being accepted by the ”King”, i.e. the Swedish Government. The five Nobel Committees could start their work by sending out invitations to nominate for the first Nobel Prizes. On December 14 the same year, the German theoretical physicist Max Planck gave a talk, at a meeting of the German Physical Society, in which he presented the idea that electromagnetic energy could only be emitted in quantized form. This idea is usually looked upon as the fundament of what later was called Quantum Mechanics, born on December 14 year 1900.\n\nAfter a long and dramatic series of events, Planck finally received the 1918 Nobel Prize in Physics ”in recognition of the services he rendered to the advancement of Physics by his discovery of energy quanta”. The decision was taken in the autumn of 1919 and Planck was invited to Stockholm to receive his prize on June 1, 1920. By then many interesting developments had taken place in quantum physics, some of which would soon also be recognized with Nobel Prizes.\n\nPlanck had used the idea of energy quanta as a way to derive a certain mathematical expression, the so-called Planck radiation formula, which he had invented earlier by fitting experimental data. He did not really believe in the existence of quanta, but a young patent clerk, Albert Einstein, took up the idea and used it 1905 to explain some curious facts found in experiments where electrons are emitted from metal surfaces shined on by electromagnetic radiation of different wavelengths. We all know Einstein mostly from his two theories of relativity, but when he received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics it was “for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect”.\n\nThe decision about Einstein’s Nobel Prize was taken in 1922 and at the same meeting of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Niels Bohr was named as the recipient of the 1922 prize “for his services in the investigation of the structure of atoms and of the radiation emanating from them”. Bohr had continued taking quanta seriously and been able to explain many properties of atoms using a planetary model. In this model, the electrons can only move in certain allowed orbits around the nucleus and can jump from one orbit to another emitting or absorbing quanta of electromagnetic radiation.\n\nDuring the 1920’s, the atomic theory was developed further by a rather large set of theoretical physicists, often in close collaboration with experimentalists. Prince Louis-Victor Pierre Ramond de Broglie introduced an idea that could be used as a kind of explanation of the existence of allowed electron orbits in atoms: The electron was associated with a wave motion and an allowed orbit was an orbit with a whole number of wavelengths. For his work, de Broglie was awarded the 1929 Nobel Prize in Physics “for his discovery of the wave nature of electrons”.\n\nBut even before 1929, two young men and one somewhat older had brought the ideas of Bohr and de Broglie into the theory that we today call Quantum Mechanics. One of the young men, Werner Heisenberg, had been fed up with the more and more detailed models of atoms and had decided to construct a theory built only on observable quantities. These quantities typically were wavelengths and intensities of emitted light, studied in the laboratory using spectroscopy. Heisenberg received the 1932 Nobel Prize in Physics “for the creation of quantum mechanics, …”. The decision was taken in the autumn of 1933 and at the same meeting of the RSAS, the other young man, Paul Dirac, and the somewhat older Erwin Schrödinger jointly received the 1933 Nobel Prize in Physics “for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory”. Schrödinger had developed the wave idea of de Broglie into a theory named wave mechanics, in which the main theoretical tool is what we call the Schrödinger wave equation. From the solutions of this equation follows the behaviour not only of electrons in atoms, but also of atomic particles colliding with each other. Besides introducing Einstein’s relativity into the theory, Dirac had shown that the theories of Heisenberg and Schrödinger were but two representations of a more general way of formulating quantum mechanics in mathematical terms. The three theoretical physicists travelled together to Stockholm and arrived in the morning of December 9. There is a famous photograph from the Central Station, on which each Nobel Laureate is accompanied by a woman. The older Schrödinger by his wife, but the two younger men by their respective mothers, since they were still both unmarried!\n\nAfter 1933 followed a series of Nobel Prizes in Physics for laboratory discoveries and developments. But in 1945, Wolfgang Pauli was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics “for the discovery of the Exclusion Principle, also called the Pauli Principle”. This principle, which forbids two electrons (or other so-called fermions) to have the same set of quantum numbers, had already been in use since many years to explain the spectra from atoms and molecules. Another similar “old” contribution that was rewarded much later was done by Max Born, who had been Heisenberg’s mentor and collaborator, but who only received his prize in 1954 “for his fundamental research in quantum mechanics, especially for his statistical interpretation of the wave-function”. With this Nobel Prize, the main pioneers of Quantum Mechanics had been rewarded. Various extensions and applications have, of course, been made and many of them have duly been rewarded with Nobel Prizes by the RSAS.\n\n2. Lindau lectures on Quantum Mechanics 1951-2014\n\nQuantum physics has been the dominating field of activity during the whole 20th Century and continues well into the 21st. That someone who is working in quantum physics is interested in quantum mechanics and might choose it as his lecture topic is understandable. As seen by the Lindau lectures, there is actually a dominance of experimental physicists trying to explain quantum mechanics to the students and young scientists in the audience. But before going back to the audio recordings of the historic lectures, listen to David Gross, who received the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics together with two other theoreticians “for the discovery of asymptotic freedom in the theory of the strong interaction”. In 2012, Gross gave a lecture entitled “A Century of Quantum Mechanics”. The lecture was inspired by a famous series of conferences in Brussels, named Solvay Conferences after a Belgian industrialist and donator who was contemporary with Alfred Nobel.\n\nSome of the Lindau lectures are rather technical descriptions of the work of the Nobel Laureate giving it. But not so the 1973 lecture of Nobel Laureate Alfred Kastler, who received his prize in 1966 “for the discovery and development of optical methods for studying Hertzian resonances in atoms”. Instead he chose to give a talk about Max Planck and how Planck arrived at the quantum energy condition. Kastler gives his talk in German and it is entitled “Wie kam Max Planck dazu E = hv zu setzen?”.\n\nDuring the second part of the 20th Century, the understanding of quantum mechanics and the experimental techniques in quantum physics had reached the level where one could call the physicists “quantum engineers”. Good examples of such “engineers” can in particular be found working of in the field of semiconductors, starting with the invention of the transistor and the integrated circuit. Leo Esaki received one of the 1973 Nobel Prizes jointly with Ivar Giaever “for their experimental discoveries regarding tunnelling phenomena in semiconductors and superconductors, respectively”. Giaever has repeatedly lectured at the Lindau Meetings, but most of the time on his (interesting) activities in biophysics (cf. the Topic Cluster on Cancer). Esaki has so far given two lectures that are relevant here. In 1997, he lectured on “Quantum Mechanics and Semiconductor Science”.\n\nIn 2012 the Nobel Prize in Physics was given jointly to two excellent “atomic engineers”, Serge Haroche and David Wineland, “for ground-breaking experimental methods that enable measuring and manipulation of individual quantum systems”. As for all Nobel Laureates in Physics, Chemistry and Physiology or Medicine, they were invited to the Lindau Meeting of the year following their Nobel Prize, irrespective of the topic of this meeting. So in 2013, a meeting year for chemistry, both Haroche and Wineland came to Lindau and gave lectures on experiments that most of the founding fathers of quantum mechanics would have thought impossible. Wineland’s lecture is entitled “Superposition, Entanglement and Raising Schrödinger’s Cat”, while Haroche lectured on “Controlling Photons in a Box and Exploring the Quantum to Classical Boundary”. I happened to be present at these lectures and looking out on the audience, I thought I could see Einstein and Schrödinger, who both didn’t believe that this kind of experiments would ever be possible, looking flabbergasted, while Niels Bohr, who took a more pragmatic stand, nodded and sucked on his (unlit) pipe, mumbling “It is hard to make predictions, in particular concerning the future”."
