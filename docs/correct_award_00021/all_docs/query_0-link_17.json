Hasselmann is one of the founding directors of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) and director of the Institute for Geophysics at the University of Hamburg. As an internationally renowned climate researcher, his findings have contributed significantly to the scientific and public understanding of climate change."
