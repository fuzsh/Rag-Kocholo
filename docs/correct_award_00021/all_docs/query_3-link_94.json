        "text": "The meteorologist receives the award for her pioneering work on the effect of aerosol particles on the formation of clouds. Clouds form by water molecules condensing on tiny particles in the air. However, these particles are constantly changing in size and their chemical composition of mineral dust, acids, salts, carbon black and organic substances. This makes them one of the biggest uncertainties in climate and Earth system research. As part of her doctoral thesis Rose developed new measurement techniques with which she could precisely determine the effectiveness of aerosol particles as condensation nuclei. This helps enhancing rainfall and climate forecasts.\n\nThe investigations brought the 30-year-old to very diverse terrestrial locations: from heavily polluted urban areas in China and clean air regions in the Alps into the Amazon rain forest. Currently, the mother of a two-year-old son is preparing for a measuring campaign with the HALO research aircraft. \"The times of week-long campaigns being far away from home are over, but the great fun of experimental work remains undiminished.\" In the long term Rose would however also like to study the formation of clouds and precipitation with the help of numerical computer models."
