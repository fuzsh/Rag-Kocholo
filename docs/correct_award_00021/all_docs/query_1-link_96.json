        "text": "Data collection\n\nThe official website of the Nobel Prize Committee (https://www.nobelprize.org/) provides information on the institutions with which Nobel laureates are affiliated at the time they receive the prize. By examining the work description available on the website, we can determine the period during which the prize-winning works were produced and then use this information to identify the institutions where the laureates were employed based on their work history. In cases the official website lacks information on the production time and academic history of some Nobel laureates, we search for information on Wikipedia (https://www.wikipedia.org/) and the Encyclopedia Britannica (https://www.britannica.com/) to supplement the missing data.\n\nData process\n\nInstitutions are categorized as universities, governmental research institutions, non-profit organizations, enterprises and others based on their attributes. Some institutions have undergone name changes throughout history, so we merge different names of the same institution into a single entity, such as merging Kaiser-Wilhelm-Society into Max Planck Society, the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research into Rockefeller University, and the Soviet Academy of Sciences into the Russian Academy of Sciences.\n\nMultiple head count\n\nWhen counting institutions and countries, certain principles are followed: first, if a prize-winning work was produced in multiple institutions, and a Nobel laureate was affiliated with more than one institution, each institution is counted once. Second, the property “country” is assigned according to the country to which the institution belongs. Third, if multiple Nobel prize-producing institutions of a laureate belong to different countries, each country is counted once, but if the institutions belong to the same country, that country is counted only once. Fourth, for multinational enterprises such as the International Business Machines Corporation, which has its headquarters in the United States but produces a prize-winning work at its Zurich research laboratory, both the United States and Switzerland are recorded. Fifth, if multiple individuals share the same award in a year, all prize-producing institutions related to them are recorded. As a result of these principles, the number of Nobel prize-producing institutions, affiliated institutions, and countries is greater than that of actual Nobel Prize awards.\n\nData analysis\n\nThis section presents a descriptive analysis of the data collected, aiming to give an overall depiction of Nobel prize in natural sciences. We introduce the awarding situation in the first part, the distribution patterns in the second part, the variation trend in the third part and the mobility patterns in the fourth part.\n\nAwarding situation of Nobel Prize in natural sciences\n\nThe Nobel Prize in natural sciences has been awarded 222 times in physics, 191 times in chemistry, and 225 times in physiology or medicine. Analyzing the distribution of the prizes over time can provide insights into the evolving trends within these disciplines. Notably, we observed that as time progresses, it has become increasingly common for multiple individuals to share the same Nobel Prize.\n\nWe divided the Nobel awarding time span into four periods, taking into account significant historical events. Before World War I, the average frequency of Nobel Prize awards remained below 1.4 in all disciplines, with a slight decline observed during the two wars. Subsequently, there was a notable increase in award frequency during the two post-war periods. The data indicates that before the Second World War, Nobel prizes were primarily awarded to single individuals in each discipline. However, the situation changed significantly afterward, with a shift towards more individuals sharing the same prize in that year. Particularly during the fourth period, the average awarding times exceeded 2.2 times in all three disciplines, with physics having the highest average awarding time, reaching 2.6 times (Fig. 1).\n\nThe shifting trend in Nobel Prize awards may be indicative of the rise of the big science era, leading to increased complexity and challenges in scientific research. This has resulted in a greater emphasis on collective efforts within the scientific community. However, the Nobel Prize’s traditional focus on honoring individual achievements may not fully align with the current context of collaborative scientific endeavors. As scientific progress relies more on teamwork and collective contributions, the Nobel Prize may appear somewhat limited in acknowledging the full scope of modern scientific accomplishments (Pan & Zhou, 2016).\n\nDistribution of prize-producing institutions\n\nThrough multi-dimensional analysis, we observed an aggregation effect within prize-producing institutions, evident in their type and geographical distribution. Universities emerged as the primary producers of Nobel Prizes, with a significant concentration of prize-producing institutions located in North America and Europe.\n\nFrom 1901 to 2022, a total of 638 Nobel Prizes in natural sciences were awarded, with a count of 688 prize-producing institutions. Among them, universities stood out as the most productive type, followed by governmental research institutions, enterprises, and non-profit organizations. Harvard University ranked as the most prolific institution overall (Table 1), and it also led in two specific disciplines: chemistry and physiology or medicine (Table 2). The most productive governmental research institutions were the National Laboratories of the Department of Energy (DOE) in the US and the Max Planck Society in Germany. Bell Labs of Lucent Technologies excelled as the most productive enterprise, and the Institute Pasteur in France emerged as the most productive non-profit institution.\n\nIn physics, aside from universities (66%), governmental research institutions (19%) and enterprises (11%) also make significant contributions. Governmental institutions, often majorly funded by government departments, align with strategic national needs, generating ground-breaking achievements. Enterprises, focused on application research, foster the transformation of these achievements into practical use. Bell Labs, Lucent Technologies' R&D division, has contributed to 15 physics Nobel Prizes.\n\nIn chemistry, except for universities (72%), the governmental research institutions (16%) are the main birthplace of prize-winning works. The MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in UK and the Max Planck Society in Germany are the most representative governmental research institutions. Both of them have produced 9 Nobel Prize achievements in chemistry.\n\nIn physiology or medicine, aside from universities (71%), the distribution of other institutions is relatively balanced. Non-profit organizations and governmental institutions each account for 9%, while others (6%) exceed enterprises (4%). This field, vital to human health, draws extensive attention, prompting various types of institutions to prioritize pertinent basic research (Fig. 2).\n\nThe continents of North America and Europe are home to the majority of institutions that produce Nobel laureates. With the exception of Antarctica, all other continents boast Nobel prize-awarded institutions, although North America and Europe are the predominant leaders in this respect.\n\nNorth America institutions accounts for 315 in total. The United States holds a prominent position with 306 count, while Canada contributes 9 to this total. Europe’s prize-producing institutions’ count is led by the United Kingdom with 92, followed by Germany with 70, and France with 37, among other nations.\n\nTurning our attention to Asia, Japan stands out as the continent’s most prolific country in terms of prize-producing institutions, accounting 20 in total. In Oceania, Australia and New Zealand have 7 and 1 prize-producing institutions recorded respectively. In South America, Argentina has 2 prize-producing institutions. Finally, representing the continent of Africa, South Africa has 1 count.\n\nThis overview provides insight into the geographical distribution of prize-producing institutions and highlights the leading role North America and Europe play in producing esteemed award-winning research and innovation (Fig. 3).\n\nAmong these countries, we have chosen six leading countries for further analysis regarding the composition of their Nobel Prize-producing institutions. This selection will provide some insight into the structural characteristics of the research entities in these countries. Our investigation reveals that, with the exception of Russia, universities overwhelmingly dominate as the principal institutions to produce prize-winning achievements in these selected countries.\n\nIn the U.S., the research output is shaped by universities (72%), government institutions (11%), and enterprises (11%).\n\nIn Britain and Germany, universities and governmental research institutions dominate research, with British universities at 76%, governmental research institutions at 17%. And German universities 57%, governmental research institutions at 31%.\n\nIn France, universities (61%), governmental research institutions (11%), and non-profit organizations (21%) all play significant roles.\n\nIn Japan, universities, holding 80% of research contributions, and enterprises (20%) shape research output.\n\nIn Russia, governmental research institutions (100%) produce all prize-winning works, with the Russian Academy of Sciences being a major contributor. This reflects Russia’s historical state system (Fig. 4).\n\nAbove are the most productive institutions in these countries. The most productive institution of the United States accounts for the lowest proportion among all prize-producing institutions within this country (11%), while that of Russia was the highest (92%). The United Kingdom, Germany, France and Japan were relatively similar, hovering around 25%. This suggests that advanced countries have a lower degree of institutional aggregation, which could be attributed to the fact that they have more top institutions. This phenomenon could be described as “a hundred flowers blooming together” in domestic settings. Conversely, countries with lower scientific and technological strengths have fewer top institutions, resulting in a phenomenon where “one outshines others.” (Table 3).\n\nVariation trend of prize-producing institutions\n\nIn different periods, the structural characteristics of the types and geographical distribution showed differently. The proportion of universities remained consistently high throughout different periods. Governmental research institutions experienced a significant increase after World War II. Non-profit organizations showed a slight decrease after the Cold War, while enterprises demonstrated a rising trend. European countries were home to most prize-producing institutions before the World War II, after which the US makes a stunning debut, taking a leading position with a majority advantage. While within the near decade, the aggregation effect sees a slight decline.\n\nThe prevalence of university research peaked between the World Wars II (83%), dipped post World War II (67%), then kept the same post-Cold War (67%). Since the first modern university-Humboldt University of Berlin,Footnote 1 was established, the orientation of universities in major Western countries has been settled to educate students and carry out scientific research, Universities’ dual role aims at providing highly educated workers for the society an increasing social knowledge stock through independent research(Shao, 2002)which fosters an open, relaxed atmosphere, and this may aid in the production of numerous Nobel-worthy works.\n\nGovernment research institution contributions rose between the end of World War II and the Cold War, driven by the US “Whole Nation System” and Cold War competition, a large number of researchers were mobilized to work together with sufficient budget expenditure, thus increasing the scale of its national laboratories (Fang et al. 2021) Such institutions produced a majority of their Nobel-winning works during this period, signifying governmental support's significance. During that period, the DOE national laboratories produced 12 prize-winning works, which accounted for 67% of all prize-winning works produced by it. To compete with the United States, the Soviet Academy of Sciences (later Russian Academy of Sciences) produced 8 prize-winning works. We can conclude that the strong support from the government was an important reason for the abundant achievements from the governmental research institutions in this period.\n\nEnterprises, while not primary contributors, showed a gradually increasing trend. Non-profit organizations consistently contributed minimally, peaking during the Cold War before declining. Their respective applied research orientation and public-welfare focus imply that they are not primary sources of Nobel-winning achievements (Fig. 5).\n\nDuring different periods, the proportions of different countries exhibit different characteristics. Further analysis may explore the scientific strength and changing trends among selected countries.\n\nBefore World War I, Germany and France had a relatively high proportion. Between 1901 and 1913, Germany and France were neck to neck, both accounting for 24% of the total during that period. During this time, the United Kingdom had a low proportion, only accounting for 7%, while the United States and Russia had even lower proportions, accounting for 4% and 2% respectively.\n\nDuring the two World Wars, Germany had a higher proportion, while the United States and the United Kingdom were showing a catching-up trend. Between 1914 and 1945, Germany’s advantage increased slightly, with its percentage rising by 1%, while France’s percentage dropped significantly, from the previous 24% to 7%. Meanwhile, the United States and the United Kingdom both had significant increases in their proportions during this period, with the United Kingdom rising from 7 to 20%, and the United States rising from 4 to 16%. However, neither Japan nor Russia won any Nobel Prizes during this period.\n\nAfter World War II and during the Cold War period, the United States’ advantage continued to expand, while the proportions of the United Kingdom, Germany, and France declined. Japan began to emerge as a new winner, and Russia achieved its highest proportion in history. During this time, the United States’ advantage rapidly expanded, accounting for over 50% of the total prizes. However, the proportion of Germany, France, and the United Kingdom all declined significantly, with Germany experiencing the most significant decline, dropping from 25% during World War II to 8%. Russia’s proportion during this period was 3%, its highest in history, while Japan began to emerge, accounting for 1%.\n\nAfter the end of the Cold War, the United States’ advantage continued to expand, while the proportion of the other three countries (Germany, France, and the United Kingdom) further declined, except for Japan, which saw its advantage increase. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the United States became the only superpower, and its advantage expanded further, rising from 54% during the Cold War to 59%. The percentages of the United Kingdom and Germany continued to decline, while France’s percentage remained stable compared to the previous period. Russia's percentage decreased to only 1%. Japan’s advantage expanded, surpassing both France and Germany, and reaching 7% (Fig. 6).\n\nIn the near decade, the overall structural characteristics keeps the same, but we can see a slight sign that the aggregation phenomenon is declining. From the type dimension, the proportion of university decrease, from 67 to 65%, while that of non-profit organization increase, from 5 to 8%. From nation dimension, the proportion of the US declines, from 59 to 52%, while that of the total proportion of other countries increases (Fig. 7).\n\nThe mobility pattern of Nobel laureates\n\nMobility among institutions is a noticeable trend among Nobel laureates. After completing their prize-winning work, they often move to different institutions rather than staying in the same one. Among the 638 Nobel laureates studied, 315 are considered mobile laureates, while 323 are stable laureates. The mobile laureates show inter-institutional mobility, with 152 transitioning to institutions of the same type, 136 moving to institutions of a different type, and 9 being associated with two different types of institutions (working for more than one institution when awarded the Nobel Prize).\n\nTo visually represent these patterns, we present the overall count of institutions and countries to exhibit the mobility patterns of Nobel laureates, shedding light on their career trajectories and the diversity of institutions and countries they have been affiliated with during their Nobel Prize journey.\n\nOut of the 315 mobile laureates and 323 stable laureates, the distribution among different types of institutions is shown in the graph below (Fig. 8). It is noteworthy that, except for universities, the other types of institutions have a lower count of stable laureates, indicating that they have “lost” more laureates than they have “attracted.” This suggests that Nobel laureates who conducted their prize-winning work in universities were more inclined to remain at the same university.\n\nFurther analyzing the top five universities with stable Nobel laureates, as shown in Table 4, reveals that Caltech has the highest percentage of stable laureates, followed closely by Rockefeller University and Cornell University. Interestingly, all of the top five universities, except Cambridge University, are based in the United States. This observation highlights the strong retention of Nobel laureates in US-American universities, indicating their attractiveness as long-term research and academic destinations.\n\nAmong the 315 mobile laureates, their inter-institutional mobility patterns are depicted in the diagram below (Fig. 9). The left column represents the types of prize-producing institutions and the right column shows the types of institutions with which the laureates were affiliated when they were awarded the prizes. The length of each type of institution signifies its count.\n\nUniversities are shown to attract the majority of Nobel laureates from other types of institutions, indicating that many laureates moved to universities after conducting their prize-winning work. This suggests that universities play a crucial role in fostering scientific excellence and promoting collaboration.\n\nNon-profit organizations are also significant in attracting Nobel laureates, underscoring their role in providing an environment for independent research and exploration.\n\nOn the other hand, governmental research institutions and enterprises exhibit a net loss of laureates, which could possibly be attributed to a less flexible environment in governmental institutions and a focus on stability within enterprises. This highlights the influence of institutional culture and structure on the career paths of Nobel laureates.\n\nOverall, the mobility of Nobel laureates across different types of institutions highlights the importance of collaboration and exchange of ideas in scientific research. It also underscores the need for institutions to provide an environment that fosters creativity, innovation, and academic freedom, in order to attract and retain the best and brightest minds in science.\n\nOf the 315 laureates who have flowed between institutions, 75 of them have crossed countries. The period between 1901 and 1913 witnessed 6 Nobel laureates flowing transnationally, accounting for 13% of all laureates in that period. From 1914 to 1945, a total of 8 laureates flowed transnationally, accounting for 8% of the total number of laureates in this period. From 1946 to 1991, a total of 29 laureates flowed transnationally, accounting for 11% of the total number of laureates in this period. From 1992 to 2021, a total of 31 laureates flowed transnationally, accounting for 14% of the total number of laureates in this period (Fig. 10).\n\nBefore World War I, Nobel Prize laureates primarily went to Britain (3), Germany (2), France (1), for they were the old centers in science and technology at that time. During the two world wars, there was a shift towards the United States (15) as a destination for Nobel Prize laureates. After World War II, the United States became the most important destination for Nobel Prize winners, attracting (16).\n\nThe two world wars were primarily fought in Europe, while the United States focused on recuperation and development during these periods. Its economy and technology experienced significant growth, which attracted a large number of Nobel Prize winners and helped establish the US as a superpower. During the Cold War, most Nobel Prize laureates went to the United States, while the attractiveness of the United Kingdom, Germany and France to Nobel Prize laureates decreased."
