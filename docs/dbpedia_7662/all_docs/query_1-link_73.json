        "text": "On his way to the biggest poker game in Old West history, Bret Maverick finds himself a few dollars short and a few inches shy of a hanging in the lighthearted and engagingly entertaining film, MAVERICK. Mel Gibson stars as the smooth-talking, never-cheating, hardly ever-bluffing gambler set on winning a half-million dollar prize and, more importantly, establishing once and for all just how good he really is. The stakes are high in this first-ever, all-star riverboat poker extravaganza, and Bret Maverick is not welcome. The poker game soon turns into an adventure, however, like every other event in his life.\n\nAction-packed and star-studded with cameos, MAVERICK is true to the form of the original ’57 to ’62 TV series. Mel Gibson brings just the right blend of action, intrigue and sly humor to the big screen MAVERICK, and as the title character originally made famous by James Garner, Gibson plays Bret Maverick like a young Garner should. The role fits him like a glove. Jodie Foster is extraordinary as Mrs. Annabelle Bransford, a card-playing con-woman who cannot decide whether to fall in love with Maverick, hate him or just take his wallet. James Garner rounds out a trio whose interaction on screen is a flawless work of harmony. This combination incontestably screams for a sequel. Tainted only by foul language, MAVERICK is an otherwise absolute delight."
