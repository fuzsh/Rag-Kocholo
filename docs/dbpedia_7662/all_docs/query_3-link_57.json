        "text": "1Holly Chard, Mainstream Maverick: John Hughes and New Hollywood Cinema.\n\n2University of Texas Press, Austin. 2020. Pp. 273. ISBN 978-1-4773-2129-4\n\n3Author: Melenia Arouh, The American College of Greece, Deree College\n\n4Holly Chard’s monograph Mainstream Maverick: John Hughes and New Hollywood Cinema is an insightful study of Hughes’s cinematic oeuvre. The “mainstream maverick” of the title, as first used by film critic Ty Burr, accurately signals the anomaly that Hughes poses in film discourse. John Hughes was a commercial filmmaker, revered in popular culture and industry circles, but generally snubbed by critics and scholars. Throughout his career he produced unashamed populist entertainment following the corporate mandates of his time. Although he developed a novel style evident in all his productions, most scholars would stop short from calling him an auteur. Hughes’s work is commercial in kind, in style and in tone, in marketing and distribution, in promotion and cross-promotion; it becomes difficult to evaluate it as art, and him as an artist. This commercial nature sets him apart from other New Hollywood directors (such as Woody Allen or Martin Scorsese) who, although as popular, have been consistently praised as auteurs, and their films as works of art. For scholars, Hughes’s mainstream aesthetic does not allow him the label auteur –even though he would meet most criteria of the status set forth by auteur theorists. This, however, is by no means a unique predicament as Steven Spielberg used to occupy a similar position in critical discourse. Today, however, Spielberg is recognized as an auteur and it seems that the time is right for Hughes to be considered one as well.\n\n5Chard’s book reviews Hughes’s work as that of an auteur, and this is certainly a valid critical choice that accurately reflects on both industry structures and the nature of Hughes’s work. From the beginning of her book, she explains the context within which his work should be examined; Hughes’s films, she argues, have historical and cultural import. They are worth exploring because they offer “intriguing insights into the operations and priorities of the American film industry in the New Hollywood era” (4). To determine these insights, Chard chooses to review Hughes’s work as that of a film auteur: the aesthetic and thematic recurrences in his films; the ideological subtext; his brand name and media persona as this was constructed through publicity materials; and his frequent collaborations that allowed him to express his vision. As such, the proof of his auteur status is very much in Chard’s book. Her work checks, rehearses and confirms all criteria that determine the status of film authorship. This is indeed a very timely contribution as in the recent few years Hughes has received much attention in scholarly and media publications, and industry commemorations. Specifically, Molly Ringwald’s 2018 reflection essay in the New Yorker brought attention to the more problematic elements of his work, asking audiences to revisit his films through a contemporary lens.\n\n6The start of Hughes’s career is well documented, a college dropout working as a copywriter who went on to become one of the most successful writers of the National Lampoon franchise (magazine and films). This success led him to a multipicture deal with Universal even though he was a newcomer to the industry. In Universal he wrote and directed three of the most popular teen films of the 80s, Sixteen Candles (1984), The Breakfast Club (1985) and Weird Science (1985). For Chard what drove his rapid ascent was his ability to navigate the different corporate structures; this was a time when theatrical revenue was in sharp decline, ancillary markets were becoming increasingly important, and “synergy” was the strategy du joure. Chard argues that Hughes understood how to position his work and maximize the benefits of synergies. For example, his films relied heavily on musical choices, soundtracks that would play well on MTV and prove appealing to younger demographics. As Chard explains, “The youth-oriented film offered a convincing demonstration of how MTV and Hollywood movies could cross-promote each other” (26). Hughes branded himself as a musical afficionado and his soundtracks were perceived as genuine communications of the youth experience. Nowhere was this clearer than in the case of The Breakfast Club and specifically the single “Don’t You (Forget About Me)” by Simple Minds which quickly became an international hit through MTV, explicitly tying the film to the song and vice versa.\n\n7The films themselves had a clear thematic tone and visual style, mainly a commercial aesthetic designed for easy decoding and feel good sentiment. Chard observes how the teenagers of these films, played by charismatic white young stars, were typically riddled with angst and expressed the different subcultures of their times. The films featured suburban spaces familiar to teenagers, and narrated coming-of-age stories, directly linked to contemporary issues concerning identity, sex and virginity, alcohol and partying, peer acceptance, and generational conflict. Chard argues that these films represented middle America, establishing Shermer Illinois (a fictional Chicago suburb) as the locus of all his films; an idealized suburb of white, affluent America, still living variations of the American Dream, still hanging on to an early mid 20th century ideal Americana. Shermer would not only provide intertextual continuity between Hughes’s films, it would become the cinematic archetype of an American town, to be rivalled only by Springfield from the animated sitcom The Simpsons.\n\n8According to Chard, these films created an illusion of teen reality defined by heteronormative romance and avoidance of any challenging social issues. In her film analysis, Chard notes that these films follow a melodramatic structure, where gender norms are reaffirmed since the teen girls are passive, often transforming themselves to satisfy the male gaze, whereas the male teens become romantic heroes, assertive and virile. Queerness is marked as deviant often through the use of homophobic rhetoric. For Chard at the core of these films “teenage girls are, on the one hand, expected to be chaste and focused on relationships, whereas teenage boys can achieve manliness only through sexual encounters and displays of control” (57). As such, Hughes early on in his career established himself as a filmmaker capable of articulating mainstream conservative ideology.\n\n9Following his success at Universal, Hughes moved on to Paramount, a studio interested in high-concept, branded movies. Chard reviews the relevant studio mandates and how Hughes managed to became part of an elite group of “creative producers,” who received greater autonomy (script writing, film development, casting choices) for movies with big budgets. The results of this effort were the films Pretty in Pink (writer, 1986), Ferris Bueller’s Day Off (writer and director, 1986), Some Kind of Wonderful (writer, 1987) and She’s Having a Baby (writer and director, 1988). The first two were box office hits and illustrated many of the traits that would establish Hughes as a creative force in the industry, as, for instance, the cutting-edge musical choices of the soundtracks. Pretty in Pink especially was accompanied by a tour de force marketing campaign. An hour-long feature was released on MTV targeting the youth market and branding the film as a hip teen-romance. The film also reaffirmed Molly Ringwald’s status as a star, and Hughes’s muse. As Chard observes, Hughes was no longer an industry outsider but a force to be reckoned with. An industry darling with several box office hits, all produced in rapid succession and aggressively capitalizing on each other.\n\n10His successful run at both Universal and Paramount meant that his status as a prolific Hollywood director was now established. Yet, his artistic credentials were frequently questioned due to the commercial nature of his work and his heavy reliance on different forms of marketing and cross-promotion. Chard, however, is interested in detailing his particular aesthetic; what are the traits that made a film “Hughesian”? To answer this, she reviews the visual and aural identity of his films: a mixture of MTV aesthetic with glossy visuals and dynamic camera movement; youth subcultures that inform the mise-en-scène; economic storytelling reliant on editing; close framing to communicate emotional states; midwestern white suburbia; and trendy but knowing musical choices. Chard also examines the thematic patterns, such as the sexual politics that underlie the teen issues of identity and peer pressure, social status and popularity. Even though Hughes’s characters often question the status quo, the guaranteed happy ending reaffirms it by giving way to romantic fulfilment and escapist entertainment. Perhaps the most controversial element in his films are the romances that blossom between characters of different socio-economic backgrounds. The crossing of these boundaries, and how this is marked as transgression and results in peer pressure or even ostracising, becomes a key theme in his films. For Chard, “All of Hughes’s teen films contain elements of fantasy, most notably romance against the odds and resistance to adult control. Through contained moments of adolescent wish fulfilment, Hughes’s teen films offer at most a fleeting rebellion against the status quo” (113). A limited critique that embraces fantasy without confronting reality; a characteristic true of many 80s movies. What becomes evident in Chard’s study is that if Hughes was successful, it was only because he managed to communicate the mainstream mood of his times.\n\n11Yet the mediocre box office performance of Some Kind of Wonderful, meant that Hughes had to reorient himself and leave the teen film behind; indeed, the popularity of Planes, Trains and Automobiles (writer, director 1987), The Great Outdoors (writer, 1988), and Uncle Buck (writer, director, 1989) with a wider audience paved his way towards family entertainment. Chard shows how his move coincides with the industry’s effort in the 1980s to make cinemas more family friendly and incorporate a type of “bourgeois civility” that would pacify the conservative and religious groups that were pestering studios for not being sufficiently family friendly. Within this context of operations, the pursuit of a cross-generational audience seeking more conservative choices became Hughes’s next target demographic, especially at Universal and Warner Bros. For Chard, Hughes in the late 80s-early 90s became the face of the contemporary family film; a genre filled with nostalgia for past family values and seeking to reaffirm a conservative American identity.\n\n12His family films were suitable for an audience of both parents and kids, relying on conservative representations of parenthood and childhood as these are constructed within the white affluent space of the suburbs. Specifically, Chard argues, his representation of fatherhood was “less about innate ability and more about the acceptance of certain responsibilities and constraints” (144-5). The father in these films had to mature and come to terms with adult obligations and the raising of children. In Beethoven (writer, 1992), for instance, the father is at the center of the comedy – a father lacking authority and constantly trying to assert it. At the other end, the mothers in many of his films of the time are just wives to these hapless men, and mothers to their unruly, yet cute, children. Chard observes that motherhood in the Hughesian universe is represented as a homogeneous, universal experience, incompatible with work and passive in kind. Given the socio-political context of the time, childhood, as concept and reality, becomes the central focus of the family unit. This is an era shaped by the conservativism of the Reagan administration, where childhood was defined as vulnerable and in need of protection from progressive, liberal deviance. In films like Dennis the Menace (writer, 1993), Dennis comes to embody a childhood ideal; a sentimental and nostalgic manifestation of a kid who roams the suburbs inflicting all sorts of slapstick violence to the unsuspecting adults. The suburbs provide Dennis with this protected space, where the threat is always external and the villains are clearly marked as such. Chard pertinently examines the production design and visual style of these films to solidify her claim that Hughes delivers space not as actual location but as symbolic of America. A constructed image, she argues, more akin to ideology than actual place.\n\n13Despite the wide popularity of Hughes’s films prior to the 1990s, and his status as a box-office director, Hughes achieved mega-stardom in 1990 with the film Home Alone (writer, 1990). Directed by Chris Columbus (a director known for shaping the visual identity of many family friendly films), the film relied on observational humor, festive sentiment, slapstick comedy, a strong adult cast, and the charming Macaulay Culkin. Although it received a big budget from 20th Fox, the incredible international box office success was not predicted. In many ways the film is credited with changing Hollywood’s understanding of what family entertainment is and how it can be marketed both domestically and abroad. His subsequent films at Fox, Home Alone 2 and 3 (writer 1992, 1997), Baby’s Day Out (writer, 1994), Miracle on 34th Street (writer, 1994) were also successful but none as the original Home Alone. However, as Chard rightly observes, these films constitute a uniform unit in Hughes’s filmography. They were released both in cinemas and in home video through extensive promotional campaigns, received ample sponsorship from big name brands (American Airlines, Coca Cola, Pepsi, Bloomingdales, Plaza Hotel), and were well-stocked by Walmart and Kmart, two retailers determined to promote family-oriented consumer goods. A trifecta of commercialism. As Chard observes, “His major 1991 deal with 20th Century Fox was the culmination of a highly successful decade when, through a combination of strategy and serendipity, he consolidated his industrial influence and built a reputation as one of the industry’s leading creators of family entertainment” (190).\n\n14The films themselves exhibited a familiar kind of rhetoric. According to Chard’s analysis, childhood innocence was merged with slapstick violence all filtered through a child’s point of view. In Home Alone, Kevin, the white affluent boy reigns supreme over the bandits of Italian-Jewish descent who threaten the sanctuary of his family home. This was a powerful message– violence understood as a fundamental right of upper middle-class masculinity. For Chard, “By separating children from their parents and forcing them to defend themselves, the Home Alone films provide male preteens with an opportunity to function as self-sufficient and independent people” (200). But this independence is always softened both by the guilt experienced by the character of the mother who agonizes over their child, and the happy ending where the child returns to the family unit, once again dependent and seeking affection. Chard shows how in these films there is no accusation of neglect; these are middle-class children, the epitome of innocence, the inheritors of wealth; on the contrary, the family until is the representation of a conservative fantasy. White, wealthy Americans of Christian faith, and philanthropic urges.\n\n15If Home Alone was the peak of Hughes’s career, Home Alone 3 was the beginning of the end. The film, featuring a new cast of characters, although aided by a major marketing campaign, found a saturated family market and modest box office success. Hughes, Chard explains, lost his momentum. Despite the failures, however, Hughes would move on to Disney with the live action films 101 Dalmatians (writer, 1996) and Flubber (writer, 1997). Both films had big name stars (Glen Close, Robin Williams) and were accompanied by a big marketing campaign. They proved to be box office hits, but as Chard importantly demonstrates, not Hughes’s hits. These were Disney hits marked, branded and sold as Disney products. Following these, Hughes stepped away from Hollywood, making the low budget indie Reach the Rock (writer, 1998) and producing his son’s script New Port South (2001). Neither did well and he retreated to his preferred rural family life in the Midwest, writing and listening to music. By then, Chard correctly notes, Hughes had become a legend, mythologized and endlessly cited by popular culture creators and afficionados. He had become a seminal figure for all movie geeks, and especially those who were teens in the 80s and grew up imagining themselves graduates of Shermer High. Chard concludes her monograph by noting that “His work was often dismissed by critics, even when it was embraced by his fans. In the years following his death, it became clear that his movies had become part of the fabric of American popular culture, referred to not just in teen and family movies, but also in all manner of media” (232). Hughes himself, Chard notes, became a commodity and that in itself marks him as one of the most significant filmmakers of New Hollywood cinema. To study his films is to study one of the most critically shunned but commercially beloved auteurs. As a study of popular culture, Chard’s monograph succeeds in placing Hughes’s films within their historical and ideological context, and detailing the industrial practices and commercial urges that defined his work."
