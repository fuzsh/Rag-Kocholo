And that is not what that whole scene is about.\"\n\nDespite the absence of the female characters from the first film, Tom Cruise's Maverick has a new love interest in the form of single mother and bar owner Penny, played by Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly.\n\nElsewhere, Monica Barbaro is also introduced as a member of the film's team of pilots, Lieutenant Natasha \"Phoenix\" Trace.\n\nAs Top Gun: Maverick arrives in cinemas later this month, RadioTimes.com has already reviewed the film and gave it a glowing review, saying that \"it improves upon the earlier film in just about every way\".\n\nRead More: Meet the cast of Top Gun: Maverick\n\nRead More: Top Gun: Maverick soundtrack â€“ All the songs in the sequel"
