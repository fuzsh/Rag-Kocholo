        "text": "An object in motion will stay in motion, as the supersonic jets of Top Gun: Maverick have proven.\n\nThe Tom Cruise-led action-adventure sequel continued to punch a hole in the sky as ticket sales did better than anticipated this weekend. Its domestic earnings added another $86 million to the total, which marks the smallest decline ever for a film that opened to a higher than $100 million first weekend, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Sure, it’s a weird stat, but it’s also a little bit of a weird movie. (Just who, exactly, was hiding nuclear armaments inside a box nestled between impenetrable mountain ridges? Eh, never mind, enjoy the ride.)\n\nAs Pete “Maverick” Mitchell and crew make their return to Monday, Top Gun's receipts are projected to be $291.6 million in North America and $548.6 million globally. The film’s propulsive thrust in foreign markets is especially notable considering the movie is not screening in China or Russia.\n\nTop Gun: Maverick is now Cruise’s top-grosser domestically, flying past War of the Worlds at $243.3 million and Mission: Impossible—Fallout at $220.2 million. (THR notes that recent Mission: Impossible films have outdone the Joseph Kosinski-directed aviation epic internationally, due to their distribution in China and Russia.)\n\nThe Jerry Bruckheimer-produced picture’s success has also launched no shortage of essays. Despite the film’s deliberate apolitical stance, many have found ways to read (or perhaps project) politics into the text. (As a wise man once said “if you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.”) Meghan McCain wrote in Britain’s Daily Mail that the film is a triumph of anti-wokeism. But an op-ed on CNN’s website argued that the sequel actually sweeps away many of the original’s dusty stereotypes, but does so in subtle ways. The Guardian wrote that the movie actually is conservative, “it’s just a more streamlined version of the conservatism of (contrary to these ding-dongs’ assertions.)” (And here I thought people dug it because jets were zooming around to “Won’t Get Fooled Again.”)\n\nThere is no word about a possible third chapter in the Top Gun saga.\n\nTom Cruise has the next Mission: Impossible (with the subtitle Dead Reckoning Part One) on tap for next summer with director Christopher McQuarrie, who has a co-writing credit on this latest Top Gun. And considering Maverick had been shelved during the pandemic, as per Cruise and Paramount’s wise bet that it should wait for the big screen, director Joseph Kosinski’s next movie is just around the corner. Spiderhead, based on a short story by George Saunders, starring Chris Hemsworth, Jurnee Smollett, and Miles Teller will debut on Netflix on June 17. This makes the third Kosinski-Teller collaboration after Top Gun: Maverick and the underseen firefighting epic Only The Brave.\n\nElsewhere at the box office, the offbeat Everything Everywhere All At Once from the directing team known as Daniels crossed the $60 million mark at the domestic box office after 11 strong weeks in specialty theaters. David Cronenberg’s Crimes of the Future starring Viggo Mortenson, Lea Séydoux, and Kristen Stewart earned but $1 million, its financial failure ensuring the Canadian director further status as a misunderstood genius.\n\nReview\n\nIn Top Gun: Maverick, Tom Cruise Is His Own Wingman\n\nThis long-delayed sequel mostly exists as a tribute to its enduring star.\n\nMaverick’s Moment\n\nTom Cruise Jets Into Cannes—And Leaves With a Palme d’Or\n\nThe Top Gun: Maverick star was celebrated all day long in the South of France, with a master class, a fighter-jet flyover, fireworks, and a surprise trophy.\n\nRoyals\n\nTom Cruise and Prince William Actually Do Have “A Lot In Common”\n\nIt turns out that Cruise has built a bond with William because the actor loves England and is reportedly a big fan of the royals.\n\nNeed For Reprieve\n\nTop Gun: Maverick Made a Man Eat His Own Shoe, as Well as His Words\n\nAfter betting against a Top Gun sequel more than a decade ago, Matt Patches is making good on his promise—and tempting the movie fates once more.\n\nHollywood\n\nSaturday Night First Look: How the SNL Movie Captures 1975’s Wild Opening Night\n\nDirector Jason Reitman calls it a “thriller-comedy” that counts down to the very first “Live from New York…”\n\nStyle\n\nRadhika Jones on Jenna Ortega’s Rise to Stardom\n\nThe VF editor in chief charts the September cover star’s trajectory from nine-year-old working actor to global name—and now a producer on Wednesday.\n\nHollywood\n\n“He’s Absolutely Extraordinary”: Remembering Robin Williams\n\nOn the 10-year anniversary of Robin Williams’s untimely passing, we asked more than 20 of his costars, collaborators, and friends—including Billy Crystal, Matt Damon, Ben Stiller, Al Pacino, Sally Field, Jeff Bridges, and Julianne Moore—for their favorite memories of this kind, playful, and uniquely intelligent artist.\n\nAward Season\n\nJoan Chen Has Always Been a Movie Star. Hollywood Is Finally Catching Up\n\nThe veteran actor has worked with Bernardo Bertolucci, David Lynch, and Ang Lee, and maintained rich careers in both China and the US. With the new film Dìdi, Oscar buzz is trailing her for the first time. What took so long?\n\nMovies\n\nAmy Adams Hears the Call of the Wild in Nightbitch\n\n“When people ask me what the movie is about, I’m like, ‘It’s about motherhood and rage,’” says director Marielle Heller in this exclusive first look. “And you either get that or you don’t.”\n\nAward Season\n\nHow Ripley Changed Dakota Fanning: “If I Can Do That, I Can Do Anything”\n\nAfter nearly 25 years onscreen, Fanning just received her first Emmy nomination for the Netflix series. She tells Vanity Fair why it represents her next chapter in Hollywood: “People feel like they know me, but then they also don’t.”"
