        "text": "Every Friday, Nevada Sports Net's Jared Brosnan, a lover of film and television, will review one movie or show and give you his thoughts heading into the weekend.\n\nTop Gun: Maverick\n\nRun time: 2 hours, 11 minutes\n\nWhere to watch: Theaters\n\nDirector: Joseph Kosinski\n\nStarring: Tom Cruise, Miles Teller, Jennifer Connelly, Jon Hamm, Glen Powell\n\nPlot in 25 words or less: Several decades after graduating from Top Gun, Captain Pete Mitchell is back in Fightertown to train former graduates on the most dangerous mission for pilots in U.S. naval history.\n\nFull Review\n\nFor someone who was born in 1997, I didn't have the experience of knowing how the country felt when Top Gun was released in the 1980s. Tom Cruise was nowhere near one of the most famous people in the world as he is today. I did know through people who have loved the movie since its debut how much this sequel meant to them. Top Gun is everything of Hollywood, Reagan's America and the 80s combined into a timeless classic. Maverick is its child that brings in a modern touch of storytelling and cinematography. Tom Cruise. for all his faults outside off the set, is still a movie star. What he and the production team on Maverick were able to accomplish after being delayed two summers due to the pandemic is incredible. This is a movie made to be seen in theaters (IMAX especially) and enjoy with people around you.\n\nFrom the opening scene describing Top Gun, F-18s taking off of an aircraft carrier and Kenny Loggins' Danger Zone playing in the background, we know what movie this is going to be. This story starts not where many expect it. Mitchell has only gone up rank once in the last few decades, focusing on being an SR-71 test pilot in the desert. Now, Captain Mitchell is still clearly haunted by the death of Goose. We'd expect a still active duty Mitchell to be on an aircraft carrier in charge of an entire fleet. Instead Maverick is still as reckless as ever pushing the limits of each plane he flies and officers above his command. He is only saved each time by Iceman, who is now in charge of the Pacific Fleet of the Navy.\n\nGoing into the movie, we knew the main plot struggle would be Maverick having to deal with Goose's son, Top Gun graduate in Rooster. Time has made their relationship almost unrepairable. This mission gives Maverick a chance to make amends while teaching Rooster to become a better pilot than Maverick or Goose ever were. Cruise and Teller have great chemistry, showing the hatred Rooster has toward Maverick while not being able to open up to others about those feelings. Maverick pushes Rooster and the other pilots to their breaking points several times in their training. Each of these tests brings the pilots closer together and grows their respect for Maverick.\n\nOne major focus going into the film's promotional schedule was the replacement of Maverick's love interest. Kelly McGillis did not return as Charlie, instead being changed to Jennifer Connelly playing Penny, a bar owner in Miramar who once had a strong relationship with Maverick. This love story is put on the back-burner instead of being a main story line in the original. Maverick is not being taught by the woman he is flirting with in a bar but now goes on sailing dates and tries to earn back the trust he lost in the past. This is a major plot difference compared to the two Top Gun movies. Maverick and Charlie's relationship is key to him growing at the fighter school as a student. Now he's working on fixing his broken relationships with Rooster and Penny. The movie's titles will let viewers know the main area of focus for each installment. In the original, it's about Top Gun itself, which includes Charlie as one of the instructors. For the sequel, Maverick is the overarching main character with everything revolving around him.\n\nThere are, of course, a few knocks for every movie. The two most obvious ones other than the military propaganda are not naming an actual enemy group or country in charge of the nuclear plant. The second is Hangman being set up more than Han Solo to save the day in the end. This group can hold a huge nuclear supply in the middle of the mountains, have SAM turrets lined up along a trench and boasts fifth-generation fighter jets. Paramount probably did not want any country or sector named to show the movie in every country possible. A made-up terrorist group might've worked better than just not saying anyone at all.\n\nIf this movie were filmed in 2022 instead of 2018, Russia would've worked. Hangman plays the Iceman character in this sequel as the blonde, taller and more talented pilot out of the graduates. Glen Powell is great playing the cocky Hangman who can deduce the relationship between Maverick and Rooster which brings the team to a head right before their mission date. He was put on standby for the mission with cutbacks during the climax showing his disdain for sitting on the tarmac. It was only a matter of time for him to make an impact in saving Maverick and Rooster right before being shot down. These two sins unfortunately must be taken into account when looking at otherwise an awesome action movie.\n\nMaverick is Tom Cruise, Paramount and Memorial Day weekend's best opening ever. It should be the top movie in the world until Thor: Love and Thunder is released in July. There's a good chance Maverick stays on top throughout the summer as it's a movie made to be seen on the big screen. While it still has aspects of cheesiness and campiness, Cruise and Kosinski do an incredible job of making a blockbuster. Putting your actors through real-life training and experiencing the effects of flying is important to delivering an authentic experience. This type of action movie is harder to film than any MCU installment. Maverick is rightfully being rewarded and applauded for the attention to detail all while just wanting to give Top Gun fans a great theater experience for the summer.\n\nRating: 3.5/4 Hard decks\n\nNSN Daily producer Jared Brosnan grew up experiencing and working in the film industry around Los Angeles. He graduated from Chapman University's Dodge College of Film and Media Arts, ranked as the fourth-best film school by the Hollywood Reporter in 2021.
