        "text": "Tom Cruise in \"American Made.\" (David James | Photo provided to MLive.com by Universal Pictures)\n\nBy John Serba | jserba@mlive.com\n\nIt’s fun to see Tom Cruise flying a plane again, and not just for nostalgia’s sake. Smuggler-turned-informant Barry Seal, the smarmy unhero of “American Made,” is his most maverick role since “Magnolia,” and I know I just made a left turn there, but please follow me anyway. The past decade or so has marked a Cruise renaissance with “Jack Reacher,” “Edge of Tomorrow” and an uptick in quality of the “Mission: Impossible” franchise, and “American Made” gives him another character smack in his wheelhouse, fitting him snug and comfy like a pair of stretch Levis.\n\nHis performance here is arch and funny, self-aware without the wink. Barry Seal was a real person with a wild life story, so wild as to be unbelievable; some of what we see on the screen seems false when it’s probably true, while other stuff that seems true might be false. The tagline on the movie poster reads “Based on a true lie,” so the point here is to smudge fact and fiction, with screenwriter Gary Spinelli and Cruise colluding to present it as a tall tale, a fisherman’s fib, a comical conspiracy theory involving the CIA, the DEA, the FBI, the White House, the state police, the local sheriff, Central American dictators, the Medellin Cartel and a kind of dumb guy from Baton Rouge.\n\nTom Cruise and Sarah Wright in \"American Made.\" (David James | Photo provided to MLive.com by Universal Pictures)\n\nThe latter would be Barry. He’s one part Forrest Gump, one part The Dude, one part Wolf of Wall Street, and one part whatsisname, the guy who flew fighter jets right into the danger zone. He’s a mostly average schmoe who stumbles across notorious characters from 1980s international military-political scandals. His screw-ups somehow become opportunities to get filthy rich; you might say he profits from being passively abiding. He extravagantly luxuriates in his newfound wealth, indulging in the extremity of his private backyard minigolf course, which he had built for his wife and three kids. (He’s a family man, notably, not a fornicator.) And he’s good at flying planes.\n\nWe’re introduced to him as a bored commercial pilot jamming on the air brakes and jolting awake a full redeye flight just for the hell of it. He also smuggles cigars out of Cuba. A CIA cubicle jockey who calls himself Schafer (Domnhall Gleeson) recruits Barry to fly a speedy twin-engine plane over Central America, taking photos of camps full of trigger-happy Central American Communist rebels. Barry also is tasked with delivering envelopes full of cash to Manuel Noriega in exchange for envelopes full of intel on the insurgents.\n\nTom Cruise in \"American Made.\" (David James | Photo provided to MLive.com by Universal Pictures)\n\nIt’s not a bad gig, but the government paycheck is a more than a tad stingy, considering his craft is taking bullets. A stop in Colombia provides him an unexpected opportunity to schlep many kilos of cocaine back to the States for wads of cash, paid by his new employers, Jorge Ochoa (Alejandro Edda), Carlos Ledher (Fredy Yate Escobar) and Pablo Escobar (Mauricio Mejia), who aren’t exactly no-names in the controlled-substance business.\n\nIt’s easy going until Barry ends up in Colombian jail, and Schafer bails him out and brings him back home and gives him a house and a private airport and 2,000 acres of Arkansas land and a blind eye to the extralegal shenanigans. Because if anyone or anything is going to function counter to logic, it’s the U.S. government.\n\nDomnhall Gleeson in \"American Made.\" (Photo provided to MLive.com by Universal Pictures)\n\nAnyway, Barry has been hiding the vocational shift from his wife, Lucy, played by Sarah Wright, who’s only 20 years younger than Cruise when she looks 30, but never mind. He used to be zonked out cold in front of her dissatisfied, lingerie-clad self, but now has his bedroom verve back. She finally gets suspicious when Barry wakes her in the middle of the night and hurriedly uproots the family to Mena, Arkansas, population diddly-squat. This doesn’t sit well, until he shows her a satchel full of $100 bills, and explains that it’s just the beginning. What do they say about the medicine and a spoonful of sugar?\n\nSchafer now has Barry running guns to Central America, and soldiers back to America to be trained. Meanwhile, the drug cargo keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger, and the Seal family has so much cash, it’s spilling out of closets and sticking out of suitcases and being dug up in the backyard by the dog. If all this seems dicey, keep in mind, all that cash makes a person blind and maybe all but drowns a person in denial and self-delusion.\n\nTom Cruise and Sarah Wright in \"American Made.\" (David James | Photo provided to MLive.com by Universal Pictures)\n\nThe majority of events are framed in flashback by way of Barry’s grainy videocassette diary, self-recorded in the mid-’80s; he narrates in a colorful Loosiana drawl. Doug Liman (“Edge of Tomorrow,” “The Bourne Identity”) directs with significant comedic momentum, maintaining an uptempo pace without getting too frenzied. The film is glib and satirical, subversive in its depiction of amoral people working in or for amoral institutions, acting, as one might suspect, amorally.\n\nBarry just keeps rolling with what comes to him, and the movie follows suit. But the laws of physics do not abide perpetual motion, and everything must come to a halt. Cruise assures that Barry is always a bit greasy and kind of lovable, but not too lovable, more likeable maybe, but not quite. His toothy smile, known for being endearing, becomes untrustworthy, a la Jack Nicholson or James Coburn. Cruise is terrific and entertaining, freewheeling and funny, and many years into his career, he still carries himself like one of Hollywood’s top guns.\n\nTom Cruise in \"American Made.\" (David James | Photo provided to MLive.com by Universal Pictures)\n\nFILM REVIEW\n\n‘American Made’\n\n3.5 stars (out of 4)\n\nMPAA rating: R for language throughout and some sexuality/nudity\n\nCast: Tom Cruise, Domnhall Gleeson, Sarah Wright, Caleb Landry Jones\n\nDirector: Doug Liman\n\nRun time: 115 minutes\n\nBill Skarsgard stars in \"It.\" (Brooke Palmer | Photo provided to MLive.com by Warner Bros.)\n\nMore on movies\n\nReviews:\n\n\"Brad's Status\"\n\n\"mother!\"\n\n\"It\"\n\n\"Patti Cake$\"\n\n\"Ingrid Goes West\"\n\n\"Wind River\"\n\n\"Step\"\n\n\"The Hitman's Bodyguard\"\n\n\"Detroit\"\n\n\"The Dark Tower\"\n\n\"Atomic Blonde\"\n\n\"The Emoji Movie\"\n\n\"Dunkirk\"\n\n\"Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets\"\n\n\"War for the Planet of the Apes\"\n\n\"The Big Sick\"\n\n\"Spider-Man: Homecoming\"\n\n\"Transformers: The Last Knight\"\n\n\"Okja\"\n\n\"Baby Driver\"\n\n\"47 Meters Down\"\n\n\"Cars 3\"\n\nLists:\n\nThe 27 biggest movies of fall 2017, ranked from least to most anticipated\n\n20 cult movies and forgotten gems you (probably) haven't seen\n\n30 movies you need to see before you die\n\nThe best movies of 2017 (so far)\n\nThe worst movies of 2017 (so far)\n\nAll the 'Planet of the Apes' movies, ranked worst to best\n\nAll the Spider-Man movies, ranked worst to best\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis' 5 greatest roles\n\nStreaming recommendations:\n\n20 Netflix movies you should be streaming now\n\n25 of the best Amazon Prime movies streaming now\n\n20 new Netflix movie recommendations\n\n20 must-see Netflix stand-up comedy specials\n\n20 new movies on Netflix you need to see\n\n25 of the best movies streaming on Netflix right now\n\n25 more of the best movies on Netflix\n\n25 terrible movies on Netflix you should delete from your list\n\n25 of the best movies streaming on Amazon Prime\n\nMore photos from 'American Made':\n\nTom Cruise in \"American Made.\" (David James | Photo provided to MLive.com by Universal Pictures)\n\nTom Cruise in \"American Made.\" (David James | Photo provided to MLive.com by Universal Pictures)\n\nSarah Wright in \"American Made.\" (David James | Photo provided to MLive.com by Universal Pictures)\n\nDomnhall Gleeson and Tom Cruise in \"American Made.\" (David James | Photo provided to MLive.com by Universal Pictures)\n\nTom Cruise and Mauricia Mejia in \"American Made.\" (David James | Photo provided to MLive.com by Universal Pictures)"
