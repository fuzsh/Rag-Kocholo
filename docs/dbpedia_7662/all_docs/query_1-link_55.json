        "text": "â\n\nBattle of Britain (1969)\n\nMichael Caine stars in this WWII drama set in 1940. The British Royal Air Force are fighting to stop Hitler's feared Luftwaffe pilots from gaining air superiority over the English Channel and Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding (Laurence Olivier) must rally his pilots. Caine and Christopher Plummer star as squadron leaders. (Apple TV+, Prime Video)\n\nâ\n\nFlight Of The Intruder (1991) â\n\nUS Navy Pilot Lt. Jake Grafton (Brad Johnson) begins to question the bombing missions he undertakes during the Vietnam War after a friend is killed. He decides to take matters into his own hands with an explosive battle plan. The ensemble cast includes Willem Dafoe, Danny Glover, Rosanna Arquette, Tom Sizemore, and Ving Rhames. (YouTube, Prime Video, Apple TV, Google Play)\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nDunkirk (2017)\n\nWhile not strictly about fighter pilots, Dunkirk is Christopher Nolanâs extraordinary film about the May 1940 evacuation of Allied troops on the beaches of Dunkirk under air and ground cover from British and French forces. Unmissable. (Netflix, Prime Video, HBO, Vudu, Google Play)\n\nBehind Enemy Lines (2001)\n\nOwen Wilson stars as a Navy pilot shot down while on a NATO surveillance mission. He must survive behind enemy lines while the commanding officer of the American battle group (Gene Hackman) tries to maintain peace. (Disney+, Apple TV, YouTube, Amazon Prime, Netflix)\n\nâ\n\nAmerican Made (2017) â\n\nTom Cruise is back behind the stick as Barry Seal, a TWA pilot recruited to work as a CIA drug runner in an operation involving Colombian narco-terrorist Pablo Escobar. Donât expect jet combat in American Made, just a thrilling adventure that just might topple the Reagan White House. (YouTube, Prime Video, Apple TV, Google Play)\n\nâ\n\nIron Eagle (1986)\n\nDoug (Jason Gedrick) is determined to rescue his father, a US Air Force Colonel whose jet was shot down in the Middle East. The 18-year-old isn't a Top Gun though, so he convinces Col. Chappy (Louis Gossett Jr.) to borrow a couple of F-16 planes to help him mount the rescue mission. What could possibly go wrong? The critics may have panned it, but Iron Eagle led to three sequels.(Apple TV, Prime Video)\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nFirefox (1982)Â\n\nGnarly veteran US pilot Mitchell Gant (Clint Eastwood) is on a top-secret mission to steal a high-tech MiG-31 Russian fighter jet known as Firefox. Heâll need help to covertly enter the Soviet Union and pull off the heist. Luckily, Gant is not worried about shaking off enemy pilots or a dogfight with Soviet jets. (YouTube, Prime Video, Apple TV, Google Play)\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nMemphis Belle (1990)â\n\nLike Top Gun, Memphis Belle focuses on the lives of young pilots trying to make their mark.

(Prime Video, Apple TV, YouTube, Google Play, Sky Store, Microsoft TV, Roku)\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nTwelve O'Clock High (1949)\n\nTrue to his name, General Savage (Gregory Peck) takes over a B-17 bomber unit with a morale problem and whips them into fighting shape.

Unfortunately, the spies are unwilling to believe a strike of such magnitude could occur on American soil. Tora! Tora! Tora! is an incredible historical movie that stands the test of time. (Prime Video, YouTube, Apple TV, Google Play)\n\nââ\n\nâ\n\nHot Shots! (1991)\n\nHot Shots! Is a Top Gun parody, a silly, outrageous, and highly entertaining comedy certain to amuse Cruise fans. Actor Charlie Sheen is perfectly cast as a talented but unstable fighter pilot.
