        "text": "Updating a beloved movie from decades ago with a mostly new cast of characters doesn't always work. But, it does if the film is Top Gun: Maverick, and if Miles Teller is involved.\n\nThe 35-year-old actor is central to the film's emotional core, starring as Lt. Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw, son of deceased Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw. The latter was the best friend of Tom Cruise's character Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell in the original Top Gun movie. He went toe-to-toe with Cruise, withstood gravitational forces in a fighter jet that would knock anyone unconscious, and did so while rocking the hell out of a mustache. So if Top Gun: Maverick was your first time laying eyes on Teller, and part of you ached when his sly smile and piercing eyes left the screen, it's understandable because you were watching one of the best young actors of the last 10+ years.\n\nEver since he first appeared on the big screen in the 2010 film Rabbit Hole, Teller has demonstrated a range seldom seen from actors his age. He's played a soldier returning from war dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder, a boxer fighting his way back into the ring after a nearly paralyzing neck injury, a serial bachelor trying to avoid love like the plague, and that's not even half of the roles he's played. Unfortunately, he's yet to get his first Academy Award nomination. But, by the looks of our list of the seven best Miles Teller movies, Oscar gold could be firmly in his future. But, for now, a proper Miles Teller binge should be in yours."
