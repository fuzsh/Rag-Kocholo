        "text": "Is the actor Tom Cruise a staunch conservative? Or rather, is the triumph of his latest film, Top Gun: Maverick, proof of the awakening of white America and more widely of the world, which has had enough of seeing wokism imposed on the film industry? It is quite amusing to see American commentators tear each other apart on the subject, dissecting each shot with arguments that mix cinephilic erudition and political dogmatism.\n\nThis debate is based on a miracle. In just two weeks, the long-awaited sequel to Top Gun – the highest-grossing film of its time in 1986 – has already earned nearly 600 million dollars (560 million euros) in worldwide box office receipts, which is three times its budget. Tom Cruise, who was 24 years old and an elite pilot in the original film, is now nearly 60 years old and an elite trainer in the sequel. In the film, he defies time as a warrior ace fighting a rogue state. He is on his way to making the best-selling film of his career.\n\nIt's a testosterone- and kerosene-filled movie, an ode to the military and romance, – there is no sex. It is a nostalgic homage to the 1980s of Ronald Reagan, when America was moving forward, flags blazing. It's full of hot guys, planes, and motorcycles. The environment is not really inclusive or eco-friendly, the characters don't question anything. A few years ago, in a film where he was acting, Quentin Tarantino loudly claimed that the subtext of Top Gun was the hero's repressed homosexuality. This analysis is still the only one in this line; the saga sequel does not follow in the way of woke.\n\nThat's all it took for political analysts on TV stations and news sites, and film critics, most of whom are conservative, to rejoice in a film that doesn't bother with questions of gender or skin color, doesn't make the audience feel guilty about a wounded planet, and doesn't evoke the sins of America.\n\nMore on this topic Subscribers only Tom Cruise, an unpopular superstar\n\nTaboo question\n\nJohn Nolte started a movement on the Breitbart website on May 28 when he congratulated Tom Cruise for not becoming a wimp in pajamas like James Bond. He also pointed to 11 recent Hollywood films that flopped because of overbearing wokism, such as Steven Spielberg's remake of West Side Story.\n\nHollywood is also the target of political analyst Meghan McCain, who wrote on June 2 in the Daily Mail: Keep coming up with scripts governed by the thought police, and you'll go out of business, because much of America no longer follows you. Some people, like conservative host Steve Gruber, even believe that Top Gun: Maverick is a warning to the Democratic left months before the midterm elections."
