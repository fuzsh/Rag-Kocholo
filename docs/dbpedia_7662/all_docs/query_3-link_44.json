        "text": "26th May 2022\n\nBoth TOP GUN movies take place mainly in cockpits, military bases, and aircraft carriers. As such, there is not a lot of opportunity for product placement. But the few brands that broke through remained surprisingly consistent in both films, despite being released 36 years apart.\n\nThis article will look at the ten most visible brands in TOP GUN: MAVERICK while also discussing the brands that appeared in the original film. Notably, the top three brands are the exact same in both films.\n\nTOP GUN (1986) was seen by over 100 million people worldwide in theatres. As such, the original film generated about 27 million dollars in product placement value for the brands it featured. With over 150 million tickets sold, more brands, more screen time and higher quality of exposure, TOP GUN: MAVERICK has generated 57 million dollars for brands while in theatres.\n\nHowever, Concave estimates conservatively that a further 600 million people have seen the original film at least once since its initial release. This has taken the value for brands to over 200 million dollars!\n\nIn a call-back to the iconic volleyball scene in TOP GUN (1986), the sequel has a sequence where the team of pilots plays American football on the beach. Although they play with a Nike football, the brand that steals the scene is Under Armour. One of its jerseys is worn by Bashir Salahuddin as Bernie “Hondo” Coleman. Under Armour gets fifteen seconds of high-quality screen time with its logo clearly visible. It is also associated with both sports and the military, which is the exact cross-section in which the brand markets itself.\n\nThe top three brands in both TOP GUN movies are each iconic in their own way. And we start with Kawasaki, which got just under a minute and a half of screen time in both films. In the original, Tom Cruise drives a GPZ 900 R. He dusts off the same model at the beginning of the sequel (unclear if it is the exact same one) before upgrading to a Ninja H2 R Carbon for the rest of the movie.\n\nAt Top Gun, when pilots aren’t training or frolicking on the beach, they can usually be found at the local bar playing pool, giving each other shit, and, of course, sipping on Budweisers.\n\nIn the original TOP GUN (1986), Budweiser got over four minutes of screen time thanks to the many scenes in the bar. This was worth 2.6 million dollars during the film’s theatrical run and a further 15 million since.\n\nAs the legend goes, in the 80s, things were not going well for Ray-Ban. So, to increase their popularity, the brand hired a product placemen agency called Unique (now known as UPP) to get Ray-Ban into the biggest films and on the faces of the hottest stars. And they did just that. Tom Cruise first wore Ray-Ban’s Wayfarer in 1983’s RISKY BUSINESS and then their Aviators in TOP GUN (1986). These are arguably two of the most iconic sunglasses models in the world to this day. And this is in no small part down to product placement..\n\nIn TOP GUN: MAVERICK (2022), Ray-Ban got over eight and a half minutes of screen time. So less than in the original. However, it had a higher quality of exposure thanks to its logo being visible 19% of the time. Tom Cruise wore the same Aviators as in the original film and Miles Teller wore Caravans. The same model woren by his character’s dad. A big chunk of Ray-Ban exposure also came from Bashir Salahuddin as Hondo. His character wore Ray-Ban optical glasses for most of the film."
