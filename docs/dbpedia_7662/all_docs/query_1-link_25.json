        "text": "01 of 15\n\nTom Cruise (Maverick)\n\nA young Tom Cruise booked one of his first major roles as Maverick in Top Gun. The actor played the Navy lieutenant after starring in Risky Business in 1983 and earning credits in Endless Love (1981), Taps (1981), The Outsiders (1983), All the Right Moves (1983), and Legend (1985).\n\nIn the years since his initial turn as Top Gun's famed aviator, Cruise only became more of a star. He earned Oscar nominations for his roles in Born on the Fourth of July (1989), Jerry Maguire (1996), and Magnolia (1999), winning Golden Globes for all three films.
