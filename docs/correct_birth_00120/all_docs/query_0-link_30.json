        "text": "About\n\nSongwriter whose hits included \"Fools Rush In\" and \"Jeepers Creepers.\" He co-founded Capitol Records.\n\nBefore Fame\n\nHe took a chance and pitched a comic song to Eddie Cantor, who liked it enough to become an early booster of his career.\n\nTrivia\n\nHis first major Hollywood hit was I'm an Old Cowhand from the Rio Grande, which was performed in the 1936 film Rhythm on the Range by Bing Crosby.\n\nFamily Life\n\nHe was exposed to blues music at an early age, giving him a unique sound among the primarily white songwriters of his age. He was married to chorus girl Ginger Meehan on June 8, 1931, and the couple had two children together.\n\nAssociated With"
