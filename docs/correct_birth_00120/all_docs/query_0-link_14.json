        "text": "History\n\nThe Mercer-Williams House was designed by New York architect John S. Norris for General Hugh W. Mercer, great-grandfather of celebrated songwriter Johnny Mercer. Construction began in 1860 and was subsequently interrupted by the Civil War. It was eventually completed in 1868, after General Mercer sold the unfinished structure to John R. Wilder. Thus, no Mercer ever actually lived in the house that bears their name. In Savannah, the majority of historic homes use the name of the home’s original family in addition to the most prominent family.\n\nArchitecture\n\nIn his design for the original Mercer House, John S. Norris added Renaissance Revival elements to his standard mix of Greek and Italianate.\n\nThe house and carriage house are both constructed with deep rose-colored bricks called ‘Philadelphia Reds’.\n\nUsing a symmetrical interior shape, Norris combined 15 foot ceilings with floor length windows to elongate the structure. It is also anchored with a 60 foot entrance hall that retains its original ceramic tile made in England at Stoke-on-Trent.\n\nOn top of that, the house maintains its original moldings, windows, doorways, hand-railings, interior shutters, flooring and interior dome with stained glass fitted in 1868 when construction on the home was finished."
