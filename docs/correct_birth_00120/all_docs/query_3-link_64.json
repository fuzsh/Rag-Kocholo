        "text": "The B-52s and R.E.M. may have put Athens on the musical map, but this charming college town is so much more than a monument to rock luminaries. Athens is alive. It’s a thriving, changing, fertile scene that is constantly cultivating new talent.\n\nTouring musicians flock to Athens to pay homage to their heroes — whether that’s Widespread Panic, The Drive-by Truckers, Pylon, of Montreal, Vic Chesnutt, Neutral Milk Hotel or another one of the town’s influential exports — but they often find it hard to leave. Why? Well, rent, drinks and food are cheap. There is live music seven nights a week. Breweries are industry (and artist) employers. Townies are real. And art is an easy-going, accepted way of life.\n\nSo, sure, come have a Stipe sighting. Come see where musical history was made and then be inspired to create your own. That’s what this Classic City is really all about. Use this sample guide to experience the alt rock scene and indie music spirit in Athens.\n\nFriday\n\nFollow Their Footsteps\n\nTake in the enormity of the past to present music scene with the Athens Music History Walking Tour. The walking tour can be self-guided through a downloadable brochure via the Athens Welcome Center, or a guided tour can be arranged with Classic City Tours. Guided tours are given by Paul Butchart, an authentic Athenian and music stalwart who was there and has the stories to prove it. Sites include the landmark “Murmur Trestle,” the R.E.M Steeple, various nightclubs, historic vaudeville halls, the Georgia Theatre, Wuxtry Records and almost all past and present locations of the 40 Watt.\n\nDine on the Rooftop of a Landmark\n\nOne of Athens' world-famous live music venues, the historic Georgia Theatre is a keystone of the Athens music scene. As a live music venue, the Georgia Theatre has hosted prominent national and local acts across all genres, including rock, folk, country, indie, alternative, hip hop and electronic. It’s been the setting for music videos by R.E.M. and John Mayer and the location for live album recordings by Corey Smith and the Derek Trucks Band.\n\nThe Georgia Theatre has converted its rooftop into an open-air restaurant and bar overlooking downtown. Enjoy a delicious menu offering traditional American dishes, as well as unique drink specials, before catching a show below in the world-class concert venue that has space for 1,000 of your fellow music-lovers.\n\nSaturday\n\nGo Automatic for the People\n\nThe sign says it all: Automatic for the People. Dexter Weaver, owner of Weaver D’s Delicious Fine Foods (closed Sunday), came up with the slogan to advertise prompt customer service. Little did he know, it created a cult following ready for an “Automatic!” ever since. Established in 1986, Weaver D’s became a favorite for R.E.M., and in 1992, the band named its eighth studio album after the slogan. The Grammy-nominated album created so much buzz that Weaver got an 800-number and hired a publicist to handle the increased attention.\n\nWeaver D’s is still serving up meat-and-three-style soul food fare, which includes fried chicken, boiled peanuts and skillet cornbread, and remains popular with Athens musicians, including Mike Cooley (Drive-by Truckers) and Michael Lachowski (Pylon). After filling up at Weaver D’s, walk it off to Dudley Park, where you can stand among what is lovingly referred to as “Murmur Trestle,” pictured in R.E.M’s debut album.\n\nNurture Musician Outreach\n\nNot far from the “Murmur Trestle,” Nuçi’s Space was created by Linda Phillips to honor the life of her son Nuçi, a young musician who took his own life. Nuçi’s Space is a non-profit organization that offers practice spaces, equipment rental, youth programs and mental healthcare for musicians. This is a sacred space where artists can unwind, create and heal. There is also a coffee bar and lounge, where you can stop in to learn more and donate to the cause that tends to creative hearts and artistic brilliance.\n\nDive into a Dinner Bar\n\nThe World Famous is a funky, quirky and totally local restaurant and performance venue that is a mainstay of the Athens town and gown scene. From poutine to pork steam buns, the local pub grub gets you ready for a night of club hopping and live music revelry, where bands have been known to sing for their supper in the side room that occasionally hosts live music, usually of the local variety.\n\nStand in the Shadow of the 40 Watt Light\n\nThe 40 Watt Club is one of the world's most famous, Athens’ most beloved and music’s most iconic venues. Nearly every weekend, it plays host to some of the nation's top acts. The historic nightclub has served as a music home base for many of Athens’ most notorious over the last 35 years, including R.E.M., the B-52’s, Pylon, Love Tractor, Vic Chesnutt, Olivia Tremor Control, Five Eight, Neutral Milk Hotel, Jucifer, Drive-by Truckers, of Montreal, The Whigs, Maserati and more. The history of the “fabulous” 40 Watt Club is being made every night the doors are open, so expect to experience some of the best local and national bands in town.\n\nSunday\n\nRefine the Encore\n\nIf dingy dives aren’t your style, you might prefer the more sophisticated atmosphere, historic detail and old iron foundry craftsmanship of The Foundry. The multi-tiered concert hall has it all -- stages, venues, restaurant, bar, coffee shop, spa and even an adjoining hotel (The Graduate) to sleep it off. Over the years, The Foundry has hosted the Indigo Girls, Nappy Roots, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band and Blind Boys of Alabama. In addition to nationally renowned bands, The Foundry is now living room to local and emerging artists alike and frequented by Georgia artists Shawn Mullins and Randall Bramblett. For food and drink, grab a candlelit table, order a locally sourced plate, and enjoy local beer, wine and spirits while you enjoy the show.\n\nA mountain treasure, where prospectors still search for gold, Dahlonega and its music scene are true Georgia jewels. Local jam circles are, by some unwritten code, welcoming and inclusive – leathery old-timers play side-by-side with kids who have studied in the Georgia Pick and Bow Traditional Music School.\n\nMusicians who have called Dahlonega home include Amy Ray of the Indigo Girls, Widespread Panic lead singer John Bell and country superstar Zac Brown, who said, \"It’s an ideal place to listen to some really outstanding music in a fun atmosphere, where you can discover new talent and hear some of the great established artists.\"\n\nUse your weekend to experience Dahlonega's deeply rooted music scene. While you're there, dig into music gold with the “Our Dahlonega Picks” Spotify playlist.\n\nFriday\n\nPick on the Front Porch\n\nMake your way to the historic Vickery House's front porch every Friday afternoon for the Pick and Porch Old Time Music Jam. This weekly tradition at the Historic Vickery House encourages musicians of all levels to bring fiddles, banjos and other instruments for a friendly exploration of the traditional music of Appalachia. The Historic Vickery House, owned and operated by the University of North Georgia, serves as headquarters for the Georgia Appalachian Studies Center, where students learn the arts, history, culture, music and nature of Southern Appalachia.\n\nSaturday\n\nJoin the Appalachian Jams\n\nGet to the Dahlonega Gold Museum lawn, where you can often find a Saturday afternoon jam session (check official schedules at Downtown Dahlonega). Locals and visitors flock to the weekend jam sessions on the Dahlonega square, where fiddles, dulcimers, a forest of banjos and even the occasional yodeler or buck dancer take center stage. The twangy sounds, handed down through the generations, echo off the mountains in this small, Northeast Georgia town that began as a gold rush settlement. Musicians began convening here with a fiddlers’ convention in the summer of 1905 when first prize was a five-dollar gold piece, and from that event, a high-lonesome soundtrack has emerged.\n\nSunday\n\nExplore Mountain Vineyards and Bluesy Brunches\n\nThe Appalachian mountains of Dahlonega are live with vines and wine, so much so that its been declared the Heart of Georgia Wine Country and the Wine Tasting Room Capital of Georgia. Vineyards abound in this deal climate setting, and you can find a variety of places to experience and taste wine-making in Georgia.\n\nTo raise a glass to music while you’re at it, try Wolf Mountain Vineyards & Winery for Sunday brunch, where live music is paired with a specialty menu. In the summer, Wolf Mountain explores the unique smoking techniques and sauces used on Southeast barbecue, paired with live blues music. October hosts a Harvest Celebration theme with bluegrass.\n\nThe roots of American music run deep in Macon. Native son Little Richard helped birth rock n' roll, and Otis Redding, who grew up and started his career here, took soul music to unsurpassed heights. James Brown and the Famous Flames recorded their first demo, “Please, Please, Please,” at Macon radio station WIBB in 1955. In the 1970s, the city became ground zero for Southern Rock when Phil Walden co-founded Capricorn Records in his hometown and assembled a label roster including the Allman Brothers Band, Marshall Tucker Band and Wet Willie. Other music-makers who grew up in Macon include Mike Mills and Bill Berry of R.E.M., country superstar Jason Aldean, rapper Young Jeezy and violin maestro Robert McDuffie.\n\nUse your weekend to experience Macon's incredible impact on American music. As you go back to where it all began, listen to music by local artists in the \"Our Macon Picks\" Spotify playlist.\n\nFriday\n\nGo Behind the Music with a Music History Tour\n\nRock, roll and stroll with Rock Candy Tours, owned by Jessica Walden, niece of Capricorn Records impresario Phil Walden and daughter of “Freebird” publisher Alan Walden, and her husband Jamie Weatherford, two history buffs and music lovers who have the inside scoop on local landmarks. The anecdote-rich, music history tours feature the Free Birds and Night Owls walking tour on Friday nights and the Rock n’ Soul Stroll van tour, in partnership with Visit Macon, on Saturday mornings. They also offer special edition food and beer tours.\n\nTours include stops at the Douglass Theatre, the Capricorn Records studio and Grant’s Lounge, where the Friday night tour ends and the bar is open. Macon also allows open containers on Friday nights, so pit stops are made along the way to refill beverages.\n\nRock Candy Tours requests that reservations are made in advance. They also offer private individual and group tours.\n\nGrab Dinner and Drinks Where Gregg Proposed to Cher\n\nThe Downtown Grill is a historic dining spot tucked away in a friendly alleyway and marked with a music history plaque that touts its claim to fame. Once called Le Bistro, and owned by Capricorn Records Vice President Frank Fenter and his wife Kiki, a Swedish Baroness, it was the Southern steakhouse (by way of Europe) to the stars. As Capricorn Records’ fame grew, so did the restaurant’s guest list; Andy Warhol, Jimmy Carter, Bette Midler, all of the Allman Brothers and more dined at the local establishment. It was here that a starry-eyed Gregg Allman popped the question to Cher. The marriage didn’t last long, but the tale will never grow old.\n\nDowntown Grill offers a full bar with cigars. You can also sit away from the smoke in the old world dining area, where you can peruse a hearty steak and seafood menu or sample martinis and apps.\n\nSaturday\n\nGo All Out Allman Brothers\n\nFor a trip back in rock-and-roll time, visit The Allman Brothers Band Museum at the Big House, the historic three-story Tudor mansion where members of the Allman Brothers Band, wives, children and roadies lived from 1970 to 1973. Explore the exhibits in the Fillmore East Room, where the band’s instruments, outfits and memorabilia are on display; or in the living room, where Dickey Betts wrote “Blue Sky.” Step into Duane Allman’s carefully recreated bedroom, or catch the vibes in the Casbah, the band’s former hangout space. Programming includes performances, book signings and live music outdoors.\n\nPit Stop for Storied Soul Food\n\nH&H Soul Food is open for breakfast, weekend brunch and lunch. You can choose your own adventure in legendary soul food. Try a traditional bacon and eggs breakfast, or sample the biscuit menu that features the “Midnight Rider” stuffed with fried chicken, bacon jam and pimento cheese. Lunch includes all the meat-and-threes that nourished the Allman Brothers Band during their lean years. Founder “Mama Louise” Hudson is credited on the liner notes for Idlewild South with the succinct citation “Vittles: Louise.” The H&H has been a destination for musicians and music fans for more than four decades.\n\nRamble at Rose Hill Cemetery\n\nFounded in 1840, scenic Rose Hill Cemetery, bordered by railroad tracks on the banks of the Ocmulgee River, provided artistic inspiration for the Allman Brothers Band in their early years, as immortalized in their songs “In Memory of Elizabeth Reed” and “Little Martha.” You can also recreate their self-titled debut album art with a visit to the iconic wall behind the Bond Memorial. Today, ABB founding members Duane Allman, Berry Oakley and Gregg Allman are interred side-by-side in the beautiful resting place, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Other Georgia Music Hall of Famers interred there are Phil Walden and Joe Galkin.\n\nCatch Live Music in the Act\n\nYou never know who is coming through Macon on a Saturday night, but you can always guarantee a worthy live music show at the historic Hargray Capitol Theatre. Part of the Moonhanger Group network of food and music, the theatre is the ideal place for national touring acts and local favorites. Just around the corner is Moonhanger’s anchor restaurants, The Rookery, Macon’s own version of the Hard Rock Cafe with burgers, beer and the upstairs, farm-sourced fine dining and cocktails at Dovetail.\n\nSunday\n\nSelf-Guide Your Way Around Town\n\nHear those church bells ringing everywhere? Find out some of their significance with the Historic Macon Music Registry. Historic Macon created the plaque project in partnership with Rock Candy Tours, NewTown Macon and the Georgia Allman Brothers Band Association (GABBA).\n\nThe Historic Macon Music Registry is an ongoing documentation project that interprets and celebrates Macon's rich and diverse music heritage. Plaques are placed at influential sites that represent the diversity of music's role in shaping the character of soul of Macon. Sites are unique to the various artists, who range from Otis Redding to James Brown, Buddy Greene to Jason Aldean.\n\nWander to the Otis Redding Statue\n\nA life-size statue immortalizes the iconic American soul singer at Gateway Park on the Ocmulgee Heritage Trail at the corner of Riverside Drive and Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. The bronze likeness sits overlooking the Ocmulgee River adjacent to the Otis Redding Memorial Bridge and Phil Walden Interchange. Redding’s music can be heard on loop from the outdoor speaker system, where there are benches to sit and vision your own “Dock of the Bay.”\n\nStay for a Sunset Encore\n\nWith a breathtaking view and free live music, open to all, the Second Sunday Concert Series is a monthly community tradition that takes place spring through fall. Pack a picnic or buy one on site and take in the outdoor concert from one of the highest points in the city at Coleman Hill park. The free concert series is run by the Bragg Jam Festival organization and includes emerging touring and local acts, who often play the summer music festival. The schedule varies with the seasons and weather conditions. Check Bragg Jam’s Facebook page for the most recent updates.\n\nColumbus has never been short on homegrown talent. The Mother of the Blues Ma Rainey, Nashville pioneer Chet Atkins, hip-hop producer Dallas Austin, TLC singer Rozonda “Chilli” Thomas, blues artist Robert Cray, violinist David Ragsdale of rock band Kansas, guitarist/songwriter Danny Whitten of Neil Young’s band Crazy Horse, and country artist and comedian Tim Wilson were all born or raised in this culturally rich river city, which is home to the RiverCenter for the Performing Arts, the opulent Springer Opera House and the Liberty Theatre. Today, downtown Columbus (or “Uptown,” as locals refer to it) thrives with a number of intimate restaurants and venues, outdoor events and the presence of Columbus State University’s Schwob School of Music, which presents more than 250 concerts every year. Spend your weekend experiencing Columbus through the ear of its original music.\n\nFriday\n\nExplore African American History\n\nStart your weekend by tracing the influence of African American music. The many contributions that African Americans have made to the Columbus region are celebrated at the Columbus Black History Museum and Archives. The story of Gertrude “Ma\" Rainey Pridgett, a vaudeville singer, performer and recording artist, who is known today as the “Mother of the Blues,” is told alongside that of musical prodigy and pianist Thomas “Blind Tom” Wiggins. Born into slavery, Blind Tom was the first African American musician to perform at the White House.\n\nNext, visit the Ma Rainey House and Blues Museum (closed Sundays). Known as the \"Mother of the Blues,\" Gertrude \"Ma\" Rainey was born in Columbus in 1886 and began performing as a young teen. She toured with the Rabbit Foot Minstrels, and in 1923, made the first of her more than 100 recordings. Upon her retirement in 1935, Rainey moved home to a two-story shotgun house, but sadly, she died four years later. By 1991, the dilapidated house was in danger of being razed, but locals stepped in, purchased it, renovated it and opened the museum in 2008 with restored rooms, memorabilia, music and more. Ma Rainey is buried just a few blocks away in Porterdale Cemetery at 107 10th Avenue.\n\nSaturday\n\nEat, Drink and Hear the Hub\n\nA city’s musical renaissance usually occurs over time, in fits and starts, like an all-night jam session, before finding its groove. For Columbus, the tempo grew decidedly upbeat in 1992 with the establishment of The Loft (closed Sundays), which as a music venue, recording studio and restaurant helped kickstart the music- and arts-centric revitalization of Columbus.\n\nThe heartbeat of live music in uptown Columbus, The Loft has been presenting live rock, blues, jazz, funk, R&B and roots music for more than 25 years. Don't miss an opportunity to catch local artists, including blues singer, songwriter and guitarist Neal Lucas, keyboardist and singer Lloyd Buchanan (when he’s not on the road with Alabama Shakes), bandleader Rusty Taylor, or the Unified Jazz Jam, a swinging collaboration between the CSU Schwob School of Music’s Jazz Studies team of faculty and students and the active Columbus Jazz Society.\n\nBut you can taste the excitement, too.
