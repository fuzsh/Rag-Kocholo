        "text": "Johnny Mercer Lyricist/Musician Extraordinaire!\n\nIf I occasionally have to take a little break from rock and roll and take a time-out to listen to an alternative set of tunes – make mine the catalog of Johnny Mercer.\n\nJohn Herndon Mercer was born on November 18th, 1909 in Savannah, Georgia. His southern upbringing would dramatically mark his approach to music later on – both as a song lyric writer and as a singer. Steeped in exposure to ‘hill billy’ songs, the blues and early jazz, his early listening experience would influence his remarkable output throughout his career.\n\nMercer departed his home in Savannah at the age of 19 and made his way to the Big Apple – moving into the Greenwich Village area and taking out bit acting parts. In his spare time he would compose using an old piano. He offered one of his earliest composition to popular singer Eddie Cantor – The song was turned down but Johnny was encouraged .\n\nHis very first composition was adding lyrics to a tune by Everett Miller, which was titled “Out of Breath (and Scared To Death of You)” – The song was included in the musical revue titled “The Garric Gaietties” the year being 1930. Next, it was off to California work on his song writing skills – and then back to New York.\n\nHe landed a spot singing for the Paul Whiteman and his orchestra (a Denver, Colorado native) and remained with that very popular band for a few years. Their paths would cross again in the future.\n\nA move back to Hollywood turned out to be a good move – Things started to happen – though slowly. His first two or three jobs didn’t make a ripple and then along came in 1936 when he wrote “I’m An Old Cowhand From the Rio Grande” which he based on his experiences while traveling through Texas. The song was performed by another Paul Whiteman discovery, Bing Crosby which helped assure it’s success – landing at number 2 on the national song charts.\n\nThis was followed by his next big hit – 1937’s “Goody Goody” (tune by Matty Malneck) this time performed by Benny Goodman with band vocalist Helen Ward. It would reach number 24 on the charts.\n\nAfter this things just got better and better – with hit after hit – working with several skilled tune composers most prominently Jerome Kern and Howard Arlen (If I Only Had a Brain, Over the Rainbow, Get Happy, Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea).\n\nMercer proved to be adept at writing songs for Hollywood but not themed film scores and he and Arlen made a mistake returning to New York’s Broadway attempting to compose for the stage – It just didn’t work out as Mercer was not comfortable with composing for a story line.\n\nPop songs were his stock in trade and because he stuck with what he did best the world has enjoyed a bundle of true treasures. Mercer’s peak period came just as Tin Pan Alley was fading away – The publishing houses were folding as sheet music sales was becoming less important to the public who were turning to vinyl.\n\nCapitol Records\n\nIn 1942 Johnny Mercer founded a small independent Hollywood-based label, Capitol – a label which would grow into a major record company. His partners were Buddy DeDylva and Glenn Wallichs – a popular Hollywood record store owner. The company started off as “Liberty Records” but not the popular label of the same name which would soon emerge. The name was changed to Capitol in short order.\n\nThe first Capitol recording session was with singer Martha Tilton singing “Moon Dreams. His other early recording artists included the Bobby Sherwood and Freddie Stack orchestras and Ella Mae Morse. Stack and Morse would record Capitol’s first million selling single “Cow Cow Boogie” which reached number 1 in 1942.\n\nHis former employer – Paul Whiteman – would come onto the label for a while followed by Billie Holiday, Tex Ritter, Margaret Whiting, Jo Stafford and Paul Weston all counted among the earliest signings.\n\nJohnny Mercer had a brief but torrid affair with Judy Garland and after it came to a halt he composed the song “I Remember You” with tune writer Victor Schertziner in 1941 – The song was recorded later on by Aussie Frank Ifield – resulting in a monster UK number 1 hit (top spot for 7 weeks) and a number 5 in the U.S. selling a couple million copies.\n\nJohnny won four Academy Awards for his songs (On The Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe” (1946, “In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening” (1951), “Moon River” (1961) and 1962’s “Days of Wine and Roses”. His “Blues in the Night” was beat out by Oscar Hammerstein II in 1942 with his “The Last Time I Saw Paris” a WWII themed recording. Hammerstein declared after the Awards that Mercer “was robbed”.\n\nI personally love the sound of Mercer’s voice and his vocal song styling – some of best ever! And his “Glow Worm” song to me is a masterpiece of lyrical invention.\n\nJohnny Mercer passed away from an inoperable brain tumor on June 25th, 1975 just as he was being approached to work with another great composer – Paul McCartney. He was 66 years of age.\n\nMost likely we would have enjoyed much more magic had he lived on.\n\nJohnny Mercer Selected Compositions\n\nAce-Cent-Tchu-Ate The Positive – 1944\n\nAnd The Angels Sing – 1939\n\nAutumn Leaves – 1947\n\nBernardine – 1956\n\nBlues In The Night – 1941\n\nCharade – 1963\n\nCome Rain or Come Shine – 1946\n\nDay In Day Out – 1939\n\nDays of Wine and Roses – 1962\n\nDream – 1943\n\nFools Rush In – 1940\n\nGlow Worm – 1952\n\nGoody Goody – 1936\n\nHooray For Hollywood – 1937\n\nI Remember You – 1941\n\nI Wanna Be Around – 1959\n\nI’m An Old Cow Hand From the Rio Grand – 1936\n\nIn The Cool, Cool, Cool Of the Evening – 1951\n\nJeepers Creepers – 1938\n\nJubilation T.
