        "text": "BACKGROUND\n\nThe charming town of Savannah was established in 1733 and is the oldest city in the U.S. state of Georgia. Savannah is considered an important historical place, being that it was a strategic port city in the American Revolution and during the American Civil War. Each year Savannah attracts millions of visitors to its cobblestone streets, stunning architecture, beautiful parks, and squares—including Monterey Square.\n\nTHE SIGNIFICANCE OF MONTEREY SQUARE\n\nMonterey Square is one of the 22 squares of Savannah, Georgia, and was completed in 1847. It commemorates the U.S. victory at the Battle of Monterrey (1846) during the Mexican-American War. All but one of the buildings surrounding the square are original to the square!\n\nHISTORICAL LANDMARKS\n\nWhen going on a walk around Monterey Square, keep an eye out for all the important markers and structures:\n\nGENERAL CASIMIR PULASKI’S MONUMENT\n\nThe Pulaski Monument is a 19th-century monument to Casimir Pulaski. It was completed in 1854 and honors the Polish nobleman who became a brigadier general and sacrificed his life to fight on the American side during the American Revolution. Pulaski was mortally wounded in 1779 as the Pulaski Legion headed toward Savannah, Georgia in an attempt to retake Savannah from the British.\n\nSCUDDER’S ROW\n\nScudder’s Row is a historic row of five homes in the southeastern residential block of the square. The houses were built between 1852 and 1853 by brothers John and Ephraim Scudder.\n\nTHE MERCER WILLIAMS HOUSE MUSEUM (429 Bull Street)\n\nThe Mercer Williams House was designed for General Hugh W. Mercer, great-grandfather of songwriter Johnny Mercer. Construction began in 1860 but was subsequently interrupted by the Civil War. In 1868, it was finally completed. Although the house carries the Mercer name, no Mercer ever actually lived there!\n\nThe house is open from 10:00 AM – 5:00 PM from Monday to Saturday, and from 11:30 AM – 4:45 PM on Sundays. Tours run approximately every twenty minutes. Visitors that come to the museum will be able to appreciate the beautiful Greek, Italianate, and Renaissance Revival architectural styles.\n\nTo book tickets online, visit https://mercerhouse.com/visit\n\nCONGREGATION MICKVE ISRAEL (20 East Gordon Street)\n\nCongregation Mickve Israel was founded in 1733 and is the third oldest Jewish congregation in America. The synagogue facing Monterey Square was built in 1820, and its magnificent sanctuary was constructed in 1878 and is one of the few Gothic-style in America. Condé Nast Traveler named Congregation Mickve Israel one of the 15 Most Beautiful Synagogues in the World!\n\nFor more information on services, visit https://mickveisrael.org/\n\nREV. CHARLES W. ROGERS HOUSE (423-425 Bull Street)\n\nBuilt in 1858, the Rogers duplex features the Greek Revival style and was designed for Reverend Charles Rogers, a Presbyterian minister, just before the outbreak of the American Civil War. Some unusual details on the design include the cast-iron porticoes and the covered balconies.\n\nTHE UNITED COMMUNITY SERVICES (428 Bull Street)\n\nThe United Community Services building is the only building that doesn’t date back to the origins of the square. Although it is only used for administrative purposes, it still makes for a lovely sight when walking around the square.\n\nTHE COMER HOUSE (2 East Taylor Street)\n\nBuilt about 1880, the Comer House was the residence of Hugh M. Comer, President of the Central Georgia Railway at the time. Jefferson Davis, former president of the Confederate States of America, was a guest in the house in 1886. The occasion for his visit was the celebration of the centennial of the Chatham Artillery, one of the oldest and most distinguished military units in the United States. Many citizens and thousands of visitors attended the festivities.\n\nUSEFUL INFORMATION\n\nMonterey Square is a public square open to visitors 24 hours a day. There is street parking available around the square for a small fee. The square counts with benches available for those that would like to take a rest, or simply sit and admire the beautiful buildings and nature."
