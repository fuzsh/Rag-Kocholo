        "text": "Johnny Mercer may have been many things to many people, but all would agree that he was one of America's outstanding lyricists and composers.\n\nBorn in Savannah, Ga., on Nov. 18, 1909, his association with music was unusual - he couldn't play piano or read music.\n\nOn most songs he would collaborate with the composer and produce the lyrics. He was also a radio personality who sang his own tunes and those of others.\n\nBiographer Philip Furia, in his book, \"Skylark: The Life And Times of Johnny Mercer,\" points out that Mercer could claim the authorship of lyrics, and occasionally music, to 1,088 songs. Eighteen were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Song, with four winning the Oscar. Furia also notes that during two weeks in 1942, Mercer had four of the 10 songs on the Hit Parade, and in other years he had a song in the Top 10 for each week of the year.\n\nIn his carefree boyhood days, Mercer played with his pals along the Vernon River, which was renamed Moon River after Johnny's hit lyrics to Henry Mancini's movie theme for \"Breakfast at Tiffany's.\"\n\nSeveral critics questioned Mercer about the meaning of the phrase \"huckleberry friends\" in the song. He explained that the boys would search for huckleberries along the riverbank, which led to the phrase. As for Mercer's education, he went to boarding school at 13 but was unable to finish college due to his father's financial losses.\n\nUnusual writing techniques\n\nTo say that Mercer's songwriting techniques were unusual is an understatement. When he was collaborating with Hollywood songwriters, he would lie on the couch, and the composer would play the songs on the piano. He was almost trance-like for an hour or so, then got up and left. Sometimes hours but more like days or weeks later he might come up with some of his great lyrics.\n\nLike many famous stories about writing on an envelope, Mercer actually did so when he composed in his head and wrote the lyrics in 15 minutes to \"I'm an Old Cowhand.\" He explained that the inspiration came to him in the 1940s while driving across Texas on his way back to Savannah. He noted that the cowboys had shifted from horses to pickup trucks.\n\nYes, he did drink, and he was one of those drinkers whose personality changed. He had the reputation of being a \"mean drunk,\" even to the extent of many times insulting the hostess of a party given in his honor. But the next day remorse set in, and he sent apologies in the form of roses.\n\nIn spite of his \"dark side,\" he actually was universally liked by those in and associated with the music business. When he traveled on the train from Hollywood to New York or Savannah, he was reportedly well-liked by the train staff.\n\nWhile Mercer is known for song lyrics, many have forgotten that he was a singer with the Paul Whiteman Orchestra and later with Benny Goodman, recording several Victor records with both bands.\n\nFirst Capitol president\n\nDid you know that Mercer was the first president of Capitol Records? Launched in April 1942 during World War II, Capitol was known for producing quality recordings with a stable of performers that included Peggy Lee, Nat King Cole, Margaret Whiting and Frank Sinatra, to name a few. Johnny frequently was featured on the label, co-starring with other Capitol artists.\n\nActually, Mercer, Buddy DeSilva and Glenn Wallichs were the founders of Capitol, an idea that was born from the simple fact that Mercer felt he was being bypassed by some of the bigger recording companies in his attempts to get his compositions recorded.\n\nCapitol quickly signed bandleaders such as veteran Whiteman, who cut his first record for Capitol. Stan Kenton's newly formed band found record success with Capitol. However, it was Ella Mae Morse and Freddy Slack who put the company in the black with releases of \"Cow Cow Boogie.\" Eventually, Capitol had a sizable collection of the nation's top bands on its label.\n\nNot generally known about Mercer was his longtime involvement and romance with actress-singer Judy Garland. This relationship is explored in Gerald Clarke's biography, \"Get Happy: The Life of Judy Garland.\" Actually, Mercer's own marriage was shaky at times, but it lasted until his death in 1976 from a brain tumor and postsurgical complications.\n\nYou probably remember many of the Mercer songs and lyrics: \"Blues in the Night,\" \"Days of Wine and Roses,\" \"Jeepers Creepers,\" \"Too Marvelous for Words\" and \"You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby.\" Many of his major hits have become standards in jazz circles, including \"That Old Black Magic,\" \"Skylark,\" \"Laura,\" \"Blues in the Night\" and \"Come Rain or Come Shine.\"\n\nEven though you may not feel you know Mercer, you have been and will continue to be intimately surrounded by his lyrics and music.\n\nUntil next week, keep swinging!\n\n___________"
