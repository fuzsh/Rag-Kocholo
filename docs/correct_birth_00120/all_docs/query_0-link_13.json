        "text": "Johnny Mercer (1909-1976), the great songwriter and singer, was a fourth generation Mercer born in Savannah, Georgia. His family dates back to colonial times.\n\nWhen he died, he was buried in the family plot at the Bonaventure Cemetery, a famous public location in Savannah. His mother is buried nearby. We visited their site on a rainy day in Georgia. The monument was beautiful that day with all the Spanish moss hanging down as the rain softly fell through the foliage.\n\nJohnny Mercer’s grave has lyrics from his songs, but there is one that was so perfect — at his mother’s site (photo above) — It said, “My momma done tol’ me.” This, of course is from his song (he wrote the lyrics, while Harold Arlen composed the music) to the great classic “Blues in the Night,”\n\nBROOK BENTON. “Rainy Night in Georgia.”\n\nhttps://blogfinger.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/13-rainy-night-in-georgia-rerecorded.m4a\n\nPaul Goldfinger, Editor @Blogfinger.net"
