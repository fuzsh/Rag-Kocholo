        "text": "Tommy Aaron, PGA\n\n1989\n\nTommy Aaron, PGA, is best known as the first native Georgian to win the Masters Tournament, which he captured in 1973 with a closing 68 to come from four behind third-day leader Peter Oosterhuis and win by a stroke over J.C. Snead. His record shows he also won significant championships at all levels of play and represented the USA in international team competitions as an amateur and a professional. Born in Gainesville, Ga., on February 22, 1937, his junior golf career included a quarterfinal appearance in the 1954 U.S. Junior Championship and the 1955 Class A Georgia High School title for Gainesville High. Aaron is the only player to win both the Georgia Amateur and Georgia Open titles in two different years, 1957 and 1960, and later during his professional career captured a third Georgia Open title in 1975. The highlight of his individual amateur career came in 1958 when he advanced to the final of the U.S. Amateur at Olympic Club in San Francisco. This led to his selection to the 1959 U.S. Walker Cup team at Muirfield, Scotland, that included such notables as Jack Nicklaus, Deane Beman, Billy Joe Patton and Charlie Coe. Other amateur victories included SEC individual titles in 1957 and 1958 while at the University of Florida, the Southeastern Amateur in 1958 and 1960 and the 1960 Western Amateur. During a successful PGA TOUR career that spanned from 1961-1979, in addition to his Masters victory, Aaron won the 1969 Canadian Open, 1970 Atlanta Classic, 1972 Lancome Tournament of Champions in Paris and was a member of Ryder Cup teams in 1969 at Royal Birkdale in England and 1973 at Muirfield. After moving on to the Champions Tour, Aaron won the 1992 Kaanapali Classic, giving him victories at every level of championship play. He is a member of the University of Florida's Athletic Hall of Fame and the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the Georgia Golf Hall of Fame in 1989.\n\nBilly Andrade, PGA\n\n2023\n\nBilly Andrade is a well-known professional golfer and winner on the PGA TOUR and PGA TOUR Champions, who has brought honor both to the game and to the Atlanta community for more than three decades.\n\nBorn in Bristol, Rhode Island, Andrade attended Providence Country Day School, where he found success early as a junior golfer. He would not only compete in, but win several national junior events, including the Junior PGA Championship in 1981. Andrade won back-to-back titles at the National Insurance Youth Classic Championship (1980-81). Also in 1981, he was the top-ranked junior golfer according to Golf Digest.\n\nAndrade moved to Winston-Salem, N.C., in 1982 to begin what would become a distinguished collegiate career at Wake Forest University as an Arnold Palmer Scholarship recipient.

He was a member of the 1986 World Amateur Team, 1987 U.S. Walker Cup Team, and in 1983, he won the Rhode Island Amateur Championship and the New England Amateur Championship.\n\nAfter a successful college golf experience, which included earning a degree in Sociology, and winning many amateur events, Andrade moved to Atlanta and joined the PGA TOUR in 1988. Between 1991 and 2000, he won four times. His first two titles came back-to-back in 1991 at the Kemper Open and the Buick Classic. He began competing on the PGA TOUR Champions in 2014, where he currently has three victories – Bass Pro Shops Legends of Golf, Boeing Classic, Charles Schwab Cup Championship – all in 2015.\n\nOff the golf course, Andrade has been recognized for giving back to his community through charity. As an ambassador for East Lake Golf Club, Andrade, along with Stewart Cink (Georgia Golf Hall of Fame member), hosts the East Lake Invitational. This charity pro-am each year raises funds for the East Lake Foundation and its continued revitalization of the neighborhood in Atlanta.\n\nAndrade also partners with Brad Faxon and manages the Billy Andrade/Brad Faxon Charities for Children, Inc., which supports children's charities in southeastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island.\n\nHis commitment to charitable giving resulted in him receiving the 2022 Payne Stewart Award. This honor is presented annually by the PGA TOUR to a professional golfer who best exemplifies Stewart's values of character, charity, and sportsmanship. Andrade was the 25th recipient of this award.\n\nFor these contributions to golf and to his community that spans over 35 years, Andrade was inducted into the Providence Country Day School Athletics Hall of Fame (1995), the Rhode Island Golf Hall of Fame (2001), named to the ACC's 50th Anniversary Team (2002), and inducted into the Wake Forest University Sports Hall of Fame (2004).\n\nView Documentary\n\nBill Blalock\n\n2019\n\nWilliam P. \"Bill\" Blalock of Atlanta, Ga., has given more than 40 years of volunteer service to the Georgia State Golf Association and has helped elevate golf in Georgia.\n\nBorn in Atlanta in 1951, Blalock attended the Lovett School and later Georgia Tech.

In recognition to the many years he has devoted his time to giving back, Blalock was presented the GSGA Foundation's first $100,000 endowed scholarship in his name.\n\nBlalock was the recipient of the 2012 Bill Todd Award, which is the highest honor bestowed upon a GSGA volunteer.\n\nA longtime member of both East Lake Golf Club and Capital City Club, Blalock has been instrumental in the preservation of each club's deep and storied history and remains a fixture at both today.\n\nOn the golf course Blalock maintained his skills as a player over the years ever since teeing it up for the Yellow Jackets.

The word \"dominant\" is used too frequently when a performance is only slightly advantageous, but in the case of Coble's consistent appearance at the top of leaderboards, the term is quite fitting.\n\nSince 1991, Coble's name has been inscribed at the top of state championship trophies no less than 25 times. In addition to the aforementioned titles, she has won the Greater Atlanta Women's Amateur (a statewide event) four times, the GSGA Top 40, the Georgia Women's Open and the GSGA Women's Team Championship four times with three different partners. She has also represented her state 18 times in the Georgia-Florida (now Southeastern Women's Challenge) Matches.\n\nBesides her Women's Player of the Year awards, Coble is the only golfer to have won the coveted Tommy Barnes Award as overall GSGA Player of the Year three times. She was the first female winner in 2000, claimed it again in 2005, and shared the award with her USGA State Team Champion mates Dori Carter and Mariah Stackhouse in 2009.\n\nOn the national scene, she holds the record as the only player to have participated on three USGA State Team Champion teams, in 2005, 2009 and 2011, with a different set of partners each time.\n\nShe has come oh-so-close to winning a coveted national individual title twice. In 2009, she squared off against former University of Georgia teammate Martha Stacy Leach in the final of the U.S. Women's Mid-Amateur in Ocala, Florida, but was defeated in that match. Again in 2012, she was defeated in the semifinal by eventual winner Meghan Stasi.\n\nCoble's success outside Georgia also includes having qualified for the U.S. Women's Open in 2001; participation in two LPGA events, the 2001 Asahi Ryokykun Invitational in North Augusta and the 2005 Chick-fil-A Charity Championship in Stockbridge; a win in the prestigious Women's Southern Amateur in 2005, and earning her way to the quarterfinal round of the U.S. Women's Mid-Amateur four times: 2005, 2006, 2010 and 2011.\n\nShe also finds time to work in a business outside her home, raise a college freshman, Katherine, and participate in several community organizations. She is a member of the GSGA Board of Directors, Tournament Site Committee, Hall of Fame Committee and Strategic Planning Committee. In her hometown of Augusta, she is on the Greater Augusta Sports Council Board, the Greater Augusta Fellowship of Christian Athletes Board, and the Georgia Health Sciences University Sports Medicine Clinic Patient Family Committee.\n\nIn her free time, she can be found on the practice tee or on the course at Augusta Country Club, getting ready for the next big event.\n\nView Documentary\n\nPete Cox\n\n1992\n\nPete Cox was known as one of the most outstanding athletes to come out of Albany, Ga., and also became an instrumental figure in working and giving time on behalf of the game of golf in Georgia.

This is a place, and he is a mentor, to give the children, and the adults, an opportunity to learn a game that will provide experiences on which to draw for a lifetime.\n\nOne of his colleagues in the northwest Georgia area, Deck Cheatham of The Farm, wrote about Fritz, \"The consideration that you give him (for the Hall of Fame) cannot be based on any personal achievement; rather, you must consider the difference he has made in the lives of those who have learned the game under his tutelage. Lowell's genius and achievement is the quintessential man behind the player. His legacy will lead to future Hall of Famers and it is only fitting that he be chosen for this honor.\"\n\nLowell Fritz was born in Sandusky, Ohio but was a graduate of Avondale (Ga.) High School. After three years in the Army stationed in Okinawa, Japan, he became an assistant professional at The Standard Club in Atlanta for three years before going to Dalton in 1966 to work as an assistant to Jim Stamps.

In 1981, he would lead the conversion from overseeded Bermudagrass to Bentgrass.\n\nIt was during his time at Augusta National that Fuller developed what would become known as 'Billy Bunkers', a specification for constructing golf course sand bunkers. After years of additional research, this method of bunker construction would be used all over the world and reduce bunker repair work by 80%.\n\nAfter his stint in Augusta, Fuller turned to the design side of the industry and joined Cupp Design. He worked alongside Georgia Golf Hall of Fame member Bob Cupp for 20 years (1986-2006) as a design associate and senior agronomist, where he worked on more than 100 new courses.

Washington High in Atlanta in 1933 and earned a degree from Tuskegee (Ala.) Institute in 1939.\n\nHolmes excelled as a young amateur golfer. In college, he won the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference three times. He also captured the black-only Southern Amateur title three times and was the National Negro Amateur Champion four times.\n\nAfter having been denied the opportunity to play a round at Bobby Jones Golf Course in 1951, Holmes and his family were instrumental in obtaining the right for blacks to play golf on City of Atlanta public golf courses. They subsequently brought suit against the city and the case wound its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, whose final ruling would end segregation of the City's courses and eventually lead to the desegregation of all City of Atlanta public places.\n\nThe first ruling in the case, in Federal District Court in Atlanta, was that blacks could play on city public courses but only on certain days. The family appealed the verdict and a federal appellate court upheld the district court's decision. Holmes obtained assistance from Thurgood Marshall, then a Baltimore attorney who successfully argued the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case, in the family's next appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. It struck down the original ruling by the district court, sending the case back to the original judge with instructions to end segregation on the City's courses.\n\nOn December 23, 1955, \"Tup\" Holmes, his brother, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and friends Charles T. Bell, T.D. Hawkins and E.J. Peterson played a round of golf at North Fulton Golf Course, thus legally breaking the color barrier on Atlanta's public golf courses.\n\nHolmes passed away from cancer December 16, 1967, but his family and the City of Atlanta joined together to dedicate a golf course in his honor in 1983 -- the Alfred \"Tup\" Holmes Memorial Golf Course in Adams Park on the site of a Civil War battlefield.\n\nHolmes was posthumously inducted into the Georgia Golf Hall of Fame and among family and friends in attendance at the ceremony was 91-year-old Charles Bell, a member of the 1955 ground-breaking fivesome.\n\nView Documentary\n\nJoe Inman, Jr.\n\n2017\n\nJoseph Cooper (Joe) Inman, Jr., of Marietta, Ga., is the Head Coach of the Georgia State University men's golf program and a longtime professional golfer with success on the PGA and Champions Tours.\n\nBorn in Indianapolis, Ind., in 1947, Inman attended high school in Greensboro, N.C., and then played golf at Wake Forest University from 1965 to 1970.
