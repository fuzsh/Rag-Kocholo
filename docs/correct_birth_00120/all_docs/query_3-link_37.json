        "text": "Take a dip with Teddy Swims!\n\nThe smooth-voiced Teddy Swims is heading out on the \"I've Tried Everything But Therapy\" Tour this fall. The singer-songwriter is well known for his genre-mixing sounds, combining elements from (but not limited to!) country, R&B, pop, and soul. The talented singer warmed up on his international summer tour and is ready to take your breath away.\n\nBorn and raised in Conyers, Georgia, Swims first gained notoriety for his covers that he uploaded to YouTube. A fan of soul music from an early age, thanks to his father, he joined the musical theater class at high school which sparked his love of performing. A hugely talented singer, he's been in bands whose genres range from hair metal groups, post-hardcore, soul covers, and more. He has been named by Rolling Stone as an \"Artist You Need to Know\" and has performed on popular tv shows such as the Kelly Clarkson Show, The Late Late Show with James Corden, and Jimmy Kimmel Live!"
