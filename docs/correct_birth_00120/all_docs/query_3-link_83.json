        "text": "SAVANNAH, Ga. — Surely there is no plant as evocative as Spanish moss, no perennial so reflective of the gothic South and all its clammy secrets. How does one look at the shaggy bromeliad — variously nicknamed “old man’s beard,” “graybeard,” “old man’s whiskers” and more — and not think of shadows and swamplands? How does one feel the tiny hairs and not think voodoo and water-slick tombstones, towering columns and Confederate statues, sweet tea and “the exquisite smell of the South,” as novelist Thomas Wolfe once wrote?\n\nThe old man’s whiskers tickled our travel trailer as we pulled into our campsite at Georgia’s Skidaway Island State Park, just 15 miles south of Savannah. It draped the live oaks and longleaf pines, the palm trees and the magnolias. It piled up in the road, like hay fallen from the truck. It spread itself like a table runner across our picnic table, whispered Flannery’s most haunting dialogue, lady, there never was a body that give the undertaker a tip. We chose a pull-through campsite cut like an oxbow through the forest, unrolled the patio mat and plugged in the string lights. At dusk, light spilled from our windows and into the forest; the moss formed silhouettes in the blue-black sky.\n\nSpanish moss, of course, is neither Spanish, nor moss. And despite all appearances, it is not parasitic. Like any good tourist, it feeds off the atmosphere itself; not the trees supporting it, but the trees’ detritus, the rain, the dust in the air. My fiancée and I had been to Savannah once before, so our plan this time around was simple: make like Spanish moss and soak it in.\n\nWe made our first visit during my graduate school days at the University of North Carolina-Wilmington, excited to walk the streets of a city that seemed to have zero naysayers. We paid for the obligatory trolley tour. We ate upscale southern cuisine at The Olde Pink House, a restaurant we could nary afford, but hey — grad school, right? We drank fancy cocktails in a jazz club below street level. We toured the childhood home of Flannery O’Connor, enjoyed a free cruise on the Savannah Belles Ferry, drank our way through the colonial squares of Savannah, coaxed forward by the city’s generous open container law (or lack thereof). Having just read John Berendt’s Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, circulated here like Gideon’s Bible, we strolled through Bonaventure Cemetery, passing the graves of Conrad Aiken and Johnny Mercer, and those unfortunate souls turning over in the plots beside them, surely sick of the hubbub.\n\nWe regretted none of it, not even the trolley tour, and couldn’t wait to come back. But this time the pressure was off. We left ourselves open to whimsy, and the results poured in. Headed downtown from Skidaway Island, we noticed a small road sign near the Diamond Causeway Bridge humbly announcing something called the Pin Point Heritage Museum. Pulling off, we passed another sign boasting Pin Point’s native son and hometown hero, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Pin Point, we learned at the Heritage Museum, is the last black-owned waterfront property on the entire Georgia coast, an isolated Gullah/Geechee enclave once entirely self-sustaining. Today, the Heritage Museum, located in the old A.S. Varn & Son Oyster and Crab Factory, keeps the history of Pin Point alive, drawing tourists off the highway to learn not only about the former slaves who established it, but how generations of their ancestors carried forward in their wake, thriving off the marsh and the seafood they could harvest from it.\n\nVisitors to the museum are first led to a screening room, where the guide shows a 30-minute documentary called Take Me to the Water. Before cutting the lights and leaving the building, the guide thanked us for visiting Pin Point and said, “I promise, this won’t be a boring video. Make sure to sit through the credits.” It feels square to hype a heritage museum’s promotional video, but this documentary left both my fiancée and I wiping our eyes on our sleeves — and not for the reasons you might think. This wasn’t a slavery video, or a video of suffering. Take Me to the Water is a celebration, an oral history of Pin Point and the Gullah/Geechee culture, interviewing residents who have lived their entire lives in the community. The whole piece is beautifully rendered, with plenty of wide-angle waterway shots and portraits of residents so up close you can practically read the stories by their wrinkles. Apparently, we weren’t the only ones raving about the documentary. In 2012, Take Me to the Water, directed by Jeff Bednarz, won the Jury Prize for Best Documentary at the Charleston International Film Festival.\n\nWe left the old crab factory feeling a little less ignorant about the world — a little more excited about how diverse this country still is — and continued toward downtown Savannah. We parked on the south end of Forsyth Park, busy on a warm winter afternoon, live oaks shading the sidewalks. Students from the Savannah College of Art & Design (SCAD) and others scattered blankets about the green space, throwing Frisbees, posing in downward dog, passing “cigarettes” around their respective circles. Emerging from the other side of the park, we finally landed on Broughton Street, flanked by restaurants and retail shops of all kinds, the Savannah most people picture today.\n\nIn the shadow of SCAD’s Trustees Theater, itself a blast from the past, Leopold’s Ice Cream drips with nostalgia, the old neon sign still glowing above the floor-to-ceiling shop windows. If you’ve been to Savannah, you’ve probably been to Leopold’s; if you haven’t, you should. Established in 1919 by Greek immigrant Peter Leopold and his two brothers, George and Basil, the parlor is now a downtown staple. Sitting before a dish of Tutti Frutti, a Leopold’s original (and a favorite of Johnny Mercer, who worked in the shop as a kid), my fiancée and I spoke with the owner himself, Peter’s youngest son Stratton Leopold.\n\nThough you may not recognize the name, you’ll probably recognize Stratton’s work outside of the shop, what he wryly calls his “day job:” Mission: Impossible III, The Sum of All Fears, The General’s Daughter and more. Born and raised in Savannah — in the original parlor, in fact, at the corner of Gwinnett and Habersham — Stratton took over the business after his father’s passing, but soon left Savannah to pursue his passion for film, landing in Hollywood via New York and Atlanta. In the late '90s, he co-produced his first blockbuster, The General’s Daughter, starring John Travolta and Madeleine Stow. In 2004, he returned to Savannah to open the new Broughton Street location, mixing the vibes of the old-school ice cream parlor with mementos of his Hollywood career, the posters for many of the films he’s worked on now framed and hanging from the walls.\n\n“I’ll be back there scooping ... and I’ll get one of two reactions: ‘Why are you scooping ice cream?’ or ‘Oh yeah, sure you do,’” Leopold says. “One guy bet me. He was sitting at the front table and asked what all this stuff was about. I said, ‘I produce movies,’ and he said, ‘Yeah, I left my Nobel Prize on the counter, too.’ I came around and said, ‘Come here. That’s my name, that’s my name, that’s my name, that’s my name.”\n\nIn truth, he says, it hasn’t been the most convenient move.\n\n“I should spend more time there [Hollywood],” he says, “but I happen to like it here.”\n\nSo much so, in fact, that he’s recently begun renovating the original Gwinnett and Habersham location with the hopes of opening a second parlor come early 2017. This one is more for the locals, he says, who don’t want to stand in a line of tourists snaking halfway down the block every time they want a scoop of ice cream.\n\nWhat a city, we thought as we drove back to Skidaway Island later that night, the Spanish moss leading us back to our trailer. What a country. In a single day, without any attempt to do so, we stumbled upon two cultures so wildly different they may as well have been in separate hemispheres. Gullah/Geechee and Leave it to Beaver. We marveled at the contrast. In the midst of a divisive presidential election, we felt lucky to see something different. Real people. Neighbors. Both proud to claim their stake here.\n\n“They call it the marsh,” one Pin Point resident says in the documentary. “It means, ‘I’m home.’”"
