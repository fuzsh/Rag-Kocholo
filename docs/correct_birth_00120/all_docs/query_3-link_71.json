        "text": "ALICE MASON\n\nMy name is Alice Mason and I am from Portland, Oregon. Currently I am living in New York City and attending the New School in the College of Performing Arts. I am studying in the singer-songwriter program and working toward getting my BFA. After studying music and performing in various ways throughout my childhood, in the past few months I have started performing my original songs live and it has been such a fulfilling experience. I am honored to join the Johnny Mercer Songwriters Project this summer.\n\nAUBREY HAYS\n\n​\n\nBorn and raised on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, Aubrey Hays comes from the tradition of bold, fearless singer-songwriters like Joni Mitchell, Janis Joplin, Fiona Apple, and Regina Spektor. A master of songs that contain untold depths and unexpected instrumental twists, Hays showcases their technical skills without sacrificing the immediacy of pop music. Hays’s versatility shows them to be equally at home on an electric guitar, piano, ukulele, or vocal looper, and their command of their instruments allow them to be a dominating yet vulnerable presence on any stage. In their coverage of her 2018 Tiny Desk Contest entry, NPR stated Hays’s “tone and emotion is rich and unguarded” and that unique characteristic of Hays’s voice and playing has helped them develop into one of Austin’s most impressive artists. Hays was selected to be part of the Austin Music Foundation’s Artist Development Program in 2020, leading to her working with legendary Austin producer Frenchie Smith at his renowned studio The Bubble. Hays’s newest single “Statue” came from those sessions at The Bubble and promises to propel them to even more widespread acclaim.\n\nCHLOE GELLAR\n\nChloe Geller (she/her) is a composer and music director based in New York City.

As an artist, I believe in the transformative power of music and its ability to promote social change and peace. My aim is to amplify the voices underrepresented in the music industry, such as women, people of color, and members of the LGBTQ+ community. In my work, I address mental health, social and political issues, as well as problems faced by minorities. I am of Azerbaijani origin, and as a representative of an ethnic minority myself, I work towards making this world less hostile to diversity and more willing to listen. I am currently based in Tbilisi, Georgia. It is a fantastic country with a vibrant community of artists, both locals and expats. This city inspired me to start writing electronic music and arranging my songs in a non-conventional way. I am Semra and Enumen on Spotify and other streaming platforms. «Enumen» is a short version for énouement — «the bittersweetness of having arrived here in the future, seeing how things turn out, but unable to tell your past self» from The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows by John Koenig. Grateful and looking forward to meeting other participants!\n\nSHANE DITTMAR\n\nShane Dittmar (they/them) is a blind composer, musician, writer, and advocate who does everything loudly.

School, community, and professional choirs on three continents have performed their award-winning compositions. Their original musicals, with honest stories about lovable and under-represented characters, have been featured at Roundabout Theatre Company, 54 Below, and in concerts across the country. Shane is based in Brooklyn, where they work as an accessibility specialist, and has a passion for music education, a guide dog named Chevelle, and an infectious - and very loud - laugh.\n\nSOPHIE EDWARDS\n\nSophie is an Australian performer, songwriter, producer, and dynamic creative person with a passion for crafting engaging music for her listeners. In 2022, Sophie has worked creatively with artists and producers such as Kimbra, Jaguar Jonze, Anna Laverty, Odette, John Floreani (Trophy Eyes), and many more cowrites, camps, and collaborations. In late 2021, Sophie released an EP of early works titled ‘FEEL AGAIN SOON’ under Vacant Room Records. Since then, she has independently released her self-produced track ‘I Guess’, which has been her most fulfilling and successful release, receiving over 30,000 streams on Apple Music and editorial placements on Apple Music and Spotify. Sophie's subsequent releases \"Lovescraps\" and \"A Vague Song of Regret\" were both played nationally on Triple J. Sophie moonlights as an advocate for female/GNC people in the music industry, and is regularly fighting for equality in important conversations across the country. She is a member of the Minister for Art’s Creative Council, and was a lead juror in the 2022 Australian Women in Music Awards. Her contributions to her local music scene through the creation of the non-male led engagement project ‘She’s on the Bill’ has led her to be awarded a Young Canberra Citizen of the Year award, and she is currently nominated for ACT Woman of the Year for 2022. Sophie is currently based in New York studying a masters degree in Songwriting and Production at the Powerstation Studios, and is also currently a production intern for Jerry Barnes, the bassist for \"Nile Rodgers and Chic\".\n\nSYDNEY LAUREN\n\nSydney Lauren tells stories through her songs. She grew up singing and writing music just outside of New York City, the place she now calls home. The city serves as her inspiration as well as her stomping grounds, and she has performed in NYC venues like the Delancey & The Bitter End. Sydney’s training in piano, guitar and songwriting are clearly reflected in her songs, which take inspiration from some of her favorite artists including JP Saxe, Sara Bareilles, Ingrid Andress, and more. Her music has been featured on “Temptation Island” and \"The Biggest Loser\" on USA Network. Sydney’s new era of music represents a chapter in her life lyrically, and her authentic vision sonically. She dives into the emotions that occur during heartbreak and the simplistic happiness that can come with love. New York City will always play an important role in her music, whether it’s a street she references or the subway home. She’s a storyteller at heart and hopes to sing words you were thinking but didn’t know how to say."
