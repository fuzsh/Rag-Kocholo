        "text": "Shen Yun is a brilliant artistic revival and celebration of China’s rich cultural heritage.\n\nEach performance consists of about 20 pieces, quickly moving from one legend, region, or dynasty to the next. Themes range from the delicate elegance of Tang court ladies to the battlefield heroics of valiant generals, from the timeless philosophical works of Lao-Tzu to spectacular scenes of magical realms. Some pieces also touch upon the topic of today’s China, shedding light on the oppression many experience for their spiritual beliefs, such as Falun Dafa. These tales of courage are often what audience members find the most touching and uplifting.\n\nShen Yun tours to some 150 cities around the world each year. From Tokyo to Paris, Sydney to New York, Shen Yun’s live performances garner thunderous applause and accolades from full houses everywhere.\n\nSome audience members drive hundreds of miles to see it. Others watch the same performance five or six times. Why? There are simply no words to describe it—you have to see it with your own eyes to find out.\n\nJoin us for the experience of a lifetime."
