        "text": "He attended Georgia State Industrial College (now Savannah State University) before being drafted into the U. S. Army during World War II. After he completed his military service, he finished his bachelor’s degree in biology. Law was a long-time boy scoutmaster for Troop 49 which was made up of boys from First Bryan Baptist Church, of which he was a member and Sunday school teacher. He was a mail carrier for the United States Postal Service for over forty years.\n\nFrom 1950-1976 Law served as President of the Savannah chapter of the NAACP. During the 1960s, he led weekly mass meetings at Bolton Street Baptist Church and St. Philip A.M.E. Church during which he urged “passive resistance to segregation” and nonviolent protests. He was involved in efforts to desegregate Grayson Municipal Stadium, department store lunch counters on Broughton Street, and the beaches at Tybee Island. He led an eighteen-month boycott of Broughton Street merchants. Law is largely credited for helping to keep Savannah’s Civil Rights movement more peaceful than those in other southern cities. In 1961, he was fired from his postal job because of his Civil Rights activities, but reinstated after national NAACP leaders and President John F. Kennedy came to his defense.\n\nAfter finishing his run as NAACP president, he focused his efforts on preserving Savannah’s African American History. He established the Savannah-Yamacraw Branch of the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History (ASALH), the King-Tisdell Cottage Museum, Beach Institute African American Cultural Center, the Ralph Mark Gilbert Civil Rights Museum, and the Negro Heritage Trail Tour. He also helped bring attention to and preserve Laurel Grove South Cemetery, the City’s historically African American municipal cemetery.\n\nLaw received honorary doctorates from the Savannah College of Art & Design and Savannah State University. He was honored by the National Trust for Historic Preservation and the Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation for his preservation efforts in the community. W. W. Law died on July 28, 2002 at his home in Savannah.\n\nThe “W. W. Law’s Gift: A Community Treasure of history, culture, and inspiration\" presentation provides an overview of the W. W. Law Collection and features collection highlights.\n\nW. W. Law Book Collection\n\nRecord Series #: 1121-107\n\nName: W. W. Law Book Collection\n\nDates: 1810-2004, no date\n\nExtent/Size: 366 records cartons, 148 items (366.0 cubic feet, 13.4 linear feet)\n\nThe W. W. Law Book Collection contains over 6,000 books in various genres, formats and lengths collected by W. W. Law. The subject matter and genres include: history, biographies, memoirs, poetry, cookbooks, textbooks, children’s picture books, photography, and music.

Another collection highlight is Negro Spirituals and Folk Songs arranged for Men's Voices, by Frederick Hall (The Rodeheaver Hall-Mack Co., Chicago, Illinois), a songbook found with a handwritten book cover made by W. W. Law.\n\nCollection finding aid/inventory"
