        "text": "Patti has chosen cityscapes for this challenge. I’m not a city girl. I would much rather be in a small town, out in the country, or exploring nature.\n\nThere is one city that is near and dear to my heart and that is Savannah, Georgia. I was born in Savannah (I’m not telling you how many years ago that was) when my father was in the U. S. Air Force stationed at Hunter Air Force Base (now Hunter Army Airfield). We moved away when I was three years old. Many years later my husband’s job brought me back to Savannah. I’ve lived within 20 miles of Savannah for over 40 years.\n\nSavannah is a popular tourist destination with it’s beautiful squares, ancient live oaks dripping with Spanish moss, a picturesque river front, Bonaventure Cemetery, and lots of history. Tourism increased after the release of John Berent’s novel “Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil”. In Savannah the novel is known as “The Book.” Hollywood discovered Savannah and it has become a popular filming location for movies such as “Forrest Gump”, “Glory”, “The Last Song” and of course the Clint Eastwood directed “Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil”.\n\nMany thanks to our host Patti for the challenge Lens-Artists #291 – Cityscapes\n\nIf I had a visitor from another country who wanted to see my home country in a week or a month, where would I take them? This is the challenge Tina has given us.\n\nI live in the United States. Many visitors from other countries are surprised by how huge it is. It would take more than a lifetime to see it all.\n\nInstead, I will take the time we have to see the many beautiful sites in my home state of Georgia. There are mountains, farmland, friendly small towns, the Okefenokee Swamp, historic cities, barrier islands, salt marsh, beaches, lakes, and the city of Atlanta.\n\nI’m not sure we could even cover the entire state in one month but we could give it a good try. We’ll start our tour in coastal Georgia where I live. We would visit at least one of the three inhabited barrier islands that can be reached by road, go on a dolphin tour to look for Atlantic Bottlenose dolphins, walk on an uninhabited island that can only be reached by boat, and take a ferry ride to explore Sapelo Island or Cumberland Island National Seashore. We would catch blue crabs from the local waters and steam them for a delicious meal, snack on boiled peanuts, and feast on low country boil with shrimp fresh from the sea.\n\nWe would visit historic Savannah and enjoy a family style lunch at Mrs. Wilkes Dining Room.\n\nWe could take a ride to Harris Neck National Wildlife Refuge to see nesting egrets, herons, and woodstorks in the spring. We could continue farther south for a boat ride through the Okefenoke National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nWe would take a road trip on back country roads to north Georgia. We would stop to explore Athens, the home of the University of Georgia, go to the top of Brasstown Bald, and look for waterfalls. We would pass by fields of cotton, corn, and pecan orchards along the way.\n\nWe would take another road trip to see the western part of the state and stop to explore Callaway Gardens in Pine Mountain and President F. D. Roosevelt’s Little White House in Warm Springs. We would drive by peach orchards and watch the sunset at one of the many lakes in Georgia.\n\nThere is so much more to see in Georgia. Sadly, I don’t have photos of some them. In Atlanta we could see the World of Coca-Cola, the Georgia Aquarium, Centennial Olympic Park, Stone Mountain, the President Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum and the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site. We could visit the Providence Canyon, also called the grand canyon of Georgia in Lumpkin and beautiful Rome in northwest Georgia, and too many more places to name.\n\nI can’t end a post about Georgia without including the University of Georgia Bulldogs football team. Go Dawgs!\n\nIf you would like to see more about my home state of Georgia please visit visit this post I did a a few years ago Wandering Around America One State at a Time – Georgia.\n\nMany thanks to Tina for her Lens-Artists Challenge #227 – Home Sweet Home\n\nOur challenge from Tina is to show images that never quite fit into a challenge category. I came up with a few images from my archives. The header image is from the Key West Cemetery.\n\nIn Savannah, when the azaleas are blooming and the Fountain in Forsyth Park turns green you know St. Patrick’s Day is almost here. These images were taken a few years ago.\n\nAthens, Georgia is the home of the University of Georgia. It is also home to two interesting sights unique to Athens. A double barrelled cannon, the only one known of its kind, stands in front of City Hall. The Tree that Owns Itself grows in the middle of a quiet neighborhood.\n\nI’ll end the post with images of the end of two U. S. Highways, U. S. 1 in Key West and U. S. 80 in Tybee Island, Georgia.\n\nMany thanks to Tina for the challenge Lens’Artists #189: Odds and Ends"
