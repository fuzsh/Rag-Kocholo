        "text": "Below is the letter we found the day we closed on the house. We already knew the house had a lot of spirit...then this letter. We were crying so much, it took 5 family members to read it. We called information and got Simone's phone number and called her that night! It has been exciting ever since.\n\nMay 7, 1994\n\nDear Mr. Snipe:\n\nAlthough we haven’t met, I think we may have something in common — the love of an old house. I believe you met my elder sister, Marguerite Bassett Harrison, about a year ago when she was being shown through your house. The third of the girls in my family, I came to Indiana as a bride in 1950. My husband, Dr. J. Albert Robbins, was a professor of English and American Literature at Indiana University until his death in 1992. There were five of us Bassett girls, all old ladies now, of course. One, my sister Beulah, died in 1976, and until recently, that date - when I attended her funeral - was my last visit to Fort Valley.\n\nHowever, in late April I returned for my 51st High School Reunion and was in Fort Valley for six days. It was a rather momentous occasion for me, since not only was it the first reunion I had attended, but it was also the first time I had seen my husband’s grave, having sent his body down two years ago for burial in the Bassett family plot. I found many changes in the town and the surrounding countryside, with new roads and buildings, etc. My friend, Sara Middlebrooks, arranged with your manager, Roy Henson, for me to have a tour of the interior of the house which we used to call Pineola and which I understand you now call Barnby Manors. I was very grateful to Roy and Sara for this opportunity.\n\nBy now, you must be wondering why this garrulous old lady is writing to you and what is the purpose of this letter. Let me say first of all that I am sorry you were not in residence at the time of my visit, for I would surely have sought you out for a good long talk about Pineola’s past. I think there may be something there of interest to you as a Britisher. Before I explain, may I express my appreciation of the care you have given to the house. I know you have spent quite a bit on it, I liked your changes although I had no way of knowing which were yours and which were those of earlier residents since my sister sold the house. I do believe that you have saved the house from falling into disrepair and decay, especially by installing central air and heat. My mother would be pleased.\n\nAnd it is because of my mother that I am writing to you. Nothing would please her more than to know that an Englishman now owns the house. You see, she came to Georgia from Paris, France, in 1919, having married a Georgia man, Captain Ralph Bassett. She had gone to boarding school in England as a young girl and then returned to teach French in an English school. Having been brought up very strictly in Paris, Henriette Bourdier felt that England represented freedom and fun, and she often spoke of playing tennis, punting on the Thames, and how happy she was in Leicester.\n\nWhen World War II arrived, even before the United States entered the war, there were young Britishers in America, particularly in the South, Royal Air Force cadets, being trained mostly as fighter pilots. What is now the Macon Airport was then called Cochran Field, which was a basic training school. My mother was beside herself to know they were there, and immediately began organizing dances at the American Legion, and arranging for many families in Fort Valley to open their homes to the young men from across the seas. She called on church groups to take them home for Sunday dinner after church and many families “adopted” boys from each of the successive training classes.\n\nAs for Pineola, it was open house for the RAF for the remainder of the war. I really cannot tell you how many young men we entertained, but it was a period I will never forget. The house was well set up for hosting the cadets, as we could put them in the two-room wing added by my father in 1930. Here they had their own bath and complete privacy from the rest of the house. I believe this is the part of the house you presently use as your living—quarters.\n\nI remember once when we had eight men, who came from three different bases, having all received graduation leave at the same time. I have a photo taken on the lawn at Pineola of my mother, two younger sisters and the eight. They were mostly there for a week, and what a time we had. My father left for a fishing trip in Florida, telling Guy Halifax, one of the older of the group, that he expected a full written report of what happened while he was gone, to be placed in his cigar box. When he checked the cigar box on his return, the cigars were gone, and Guy had left a note saying that too much had happened, he couldn’t possibly write it up. Of the eight, at least four died in the war. I am in correspondence with three of the survivors: Norman Bate, Ken Lewis, and Desmond Macey.\n\nOver the years, we gradually lost touch with the “Bassett Boys” but in 1985 I was contacted by Dr. Gilbert Guinn, a History professor in Greenwood, SC, who was trying to write a voluminous history of the training of the RAF in the States, and in particular of those who were under the Arnold Scheme of training (named for the American general, “Hap” Arnold.) He asked for any and all information I might be able to supply him on the boys we had entertained, saying that the name of the Bassett family kept coming up again and again. Also that Norman Bate was asking for our addresses. Thereafter Norman and I began a correspondence which has endured to this day. Norman also began publication of the Arnold Register, which was an attempt, largely successful, to re—establish contact among those who had trained in the States. This Spring Norman was decorated by the queen for his efforts, as was another Bassett boy, Johnny Johnson (for his activities in working with underprivileged boys). Norman says that he made a solemn promise to Mama Bassett that he would try to keep the boys in touch with each other, and thinks he has fulfilled that promise.\n\nA group of these RAF veterans has already come on tour to the States. They were given the keys to the city of Macon, Ga. and feted for several days in Albany, GA, home of one of the advanced bases. Unfortunately when they came to Fort Valley, they were unannounced and couldn’t even find the route to Pineola Farm. I am telling you this because Norman tells me that a small group is coming over again in September of this year. They are definitely going to be in Macon again, and I assume that at least certain ones would be very interested in seeing Fort Valley again, as well as the old house where they spent so many days. I have permission from Sara Middlebrooks to give Norman her name, address and tel. no., and would like your permission to do the same for you. Norman called me from Leicester the moment he got my letter telling him I was finally going back to Fort Valley again. Will you by any chance be in residence in Fort Valley in September? I still must write him to give an account of my trip.\n\nI find it a very daunting project to try to explain in a letter about those war years, Henriette Bassett, the unabashed Anglophile, and how beloved your house is to your countrymen. Norman simply gasped when I told him the place was now owned by an Englishman. Somewhere I have copies of the photo of the eight on the lawn that day, but so far have not been able to put my hands on them. If I find them, will send you one.\n\nSo thank you, Sir, for taking such good care of our former home. If I can give you any more information, please let me know. The spirits of those eager young men must still sometimes find their way about the place. Not that they would haunt it, for they were happy times, as happy as possible in war time. So think of them as good spirits, wishing you well in your endeavors.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nSimone Bassett\n\nF.

That’s exactly what Paul and Delise Knight of Taylor’s Mill Road in Fort Valley did Memorial Day weekend when they invited all the descendants of Stephen Elisha Bassett (old­timers will remember the late brothers Ralph and Noble Bassett and sister Lucy) to meet at the old Bassett homeplace, Pineola Farm.\n\nThe Knights estimate that more than 100 Bassetts and community friends attended the event that Paul Knight called “a big success”\n\nIt’s the most memorable thing we’ve ever done. It was great!” agreed Delise Knight, who together with a number of friends provided a variety of mouth-watering dishes in abundance for Saturday’s noon meal. Folks brought pot-luck items; if they brought no food, they were given an opportunity to make a financial contribution. to help pay for the food.\n\nMrs. Marie Anderson, whose mother was French (as was Ralph Bassett’s wife Henriette), made 150 rolls for the occasion, Mrs. Evelyn Webb, who attended her first garden club meet­ing with Henriette, con­tributed two pecan pies. Edgar and Lena Belle Duke churned a massive amount of peach ice cream Friday afternoon for the Saturday crowd. Deli se’s friends, Terri and Marty Greathouse, assumed command of the kitchen so that everything would run smoothly.\n\n“We could not have done it without all of them.’’ insisted Delise. “I have never seen such a kind, caring community.’\n\nSimone Bassett Robbins of .Bloomington . Indiana, was in charge of contacting all the relatives, She and some others came down Wed., May 24, and stayed through Tues., May 30.\n\nThursday the Bassetts who were in Peach County had lunch in Fort Valley, viewed the Bassett bricks in the Fincher Park gazebo and toured Lane Packing Co. Friday they visited the Shiloh and Oaklawn cemeteries in Centerville and Fort Valley, respectively. That night all gathered at the New Perry Hotel for supper.\n\nAnd, of course, “the Big Day” was Saturday. Visiting Pineola Farm was a trip into the past as everyone hugged and kissed, caught up on all the family news, shared precious memories of family members no longer present, renewed old friendships and met newer family members. Photos, letters and other family documents were on display for all to see and help in preserving the history of the house. That magnificent house furnished with handsome antiques in every room was the perfect spot for a family reunion-- and the house and porches are so commodious that there was room for all to enjoy a seated meal. (Maybe a few did have to eat in shifts.)\n\nSunday those who were still in middle Georgia attended the Fort Valley Presbyterian Church to end a memorable weekend.\n\nIn honor of the “once-In-a­lifetime” event Patsy Bassett Hilliard’s husband read this poem before Saturday dinner was served.\n\nI Love You, Pineola!\n\nby Russell B. Hilliard, Sr.\n\nPineola, I love you for the Bassetts who first gave life to you and renewed it from generation to gen­eration: for Stephen Elisha who framed you in his heart and formed you in the field from tall Georgia pines. Pineola, I love you for your hall so wide and long, with your inner depths for memories and your outer doors for welcomes. Pineola. I love you for your ceilings, built high for coolness in your antebellum summers, but well-lighted with crystal chandeliers to call all eyes upwards in recent years. Pineola, I love you for your porches that, breathing honeysuckle’s sweetness, not only opened out to your birds, your flowers, your peaches, and your pines, but also to the love­ly neighbors of Fort Valley and to the larger community of the world. Pineola, I love you for your children, among America’s sturdy stock. You protected them to play in the softness of your cotton and to grow with your fields of grain. I love you for one of your girls who has meant more than life to me. Pineola, I love you for Paul and Delise Knight, not only for having brought you back to life again, but also, with Simone, for having brought us back to you, simply to tell you:\n\n“Pineola. we love you!”\n\nFrom The Byron Gazzette\n\nThe Bassett Family of Houston County by Sue Bassett Folawn\n\nThe Bassett Family owned Pineola From 1865 until 1972\n\nStephen Bassett, son of William Bassett and his wife Mary Phillips, was born\n\nin Cumberland Co. NC in 1788, and grew up in that area. He married Jane\n\nMorris, daughter of Elijah and Rachel Morris, in Barnwell, SC in 1815. Along\n\nwith many thousands of others, especially settlers from the Carolinas, they\n\narrived in Georgia with the hopes of the land and a new life, offered by the\n\nGeorgia Land Lotteries.\n\nFamily tradition says that the young family settled first near old Ft.\n\nHawkins, close to Macon, when that part of the state was still on the frontier and\n\nthe Cherokee Indians were still inhabiting the area. By the 1820 Census, they\n\nhad moved to Jones Co., near Clinton.\n\nIn 1828, Stephen purchased 202 1/2 acres from Alexander B. Kennedy for Lot\n\n33, District 5 of Houston Co. for $250.(1) This was land originally drawn by\n\nMr. Kennedy in the 1821 Georgia Land Lottery. The property was approximately a\n\nmile and a half southeast of Byron, Ga. This is where the Bassetts settled\n\npermanently.\n\nThere would be years of hard work ahead, but people who managed to obtain\n\nthe land offered in the Lotteries, considered themselves fortunate, indeed. The\n\nland in Houston County was rich. It was also forested and needed to be cleared\n\nand fenced in order to plant crops and orchards. At this point, roads were\n\nfew and primitive. Railroads would not arrive in the area until the 1840s.\n\nTheir church, believed to have been the Shiloh Methodist Church, near their\n\nfarm, was undoubtedly the mainstay of both their spiritual and social lives.\n\nNotations in the Bassett Bible list the dates that each of the Bassett sons and\n\ndaughters joined the Church, indicating its great importance to them. Stephen\n\nand Jane farmed, raised their family of 5 children, and lived long and\n\nproductive lives, accumulating a considerable amount of land in the process.\n\nThe Civil War brought great personal tragedy to the family with the loss of 3\n\ngrandsons in service; Stephen and Will Clark (sons of daughter Mary) and\n\nWalter Pattishall, (daughter Harriet's son) as well as the death of a son-in-law,\n\nWiley Clark, (Mary's husband). Two of their young Melvin grandchildren\n\n(children of daughter, Georgia) also died of illness during this time. (1863)\n\nStephen Bassett died in 1867 (age 78) and Jane in 1870 (age 71). Family\n\ntradition says that they are buried in the Shiloh Methodist Churchyard near Byron,\n\nGA. While there are no markers for them in evidence, there are estimated to\n\nbe as many as 150 unmarked graves within the cemetery. They were married for\n\n52 years.\n\n******************************************************************************\n\nThe will of Stephen Bassett;\n\nBook B, Pages 201 & 202, Minute Book pg. 415\n\nHouston Co.

They were the parents of 9 children.\n\nMore than most, we can look at the old records of Mary's life and marvel at\n\nthe story they tell and the history this family lived through. Following the\n\ndeath of her husband of over 25 years during the Civil War, she homesteaded the\n\nClark farm near Powersville and raised her 3 remaining children there\n\n(Victoria, Sarah and Drew), with 2 of her older boys living nearby.

It seems insupportable and no friend near to relate my\n\ntroubles to nor to sympathize with me. It seems like I had rather die than live if\n\nit was not for my helpless little children that would suffer for my attention.\n\nI have not heard from my husband and my son in nearly 3 weeks. I can't tell\n\nwhy they don't write to me I am in a distressed condition with my sick family\n\nand not well myself. This is a very sickly place. I want to get away from\n\nhere bad. Tell Daniel (Mary's son) to get off at buzzard roost station. We\n\nlive two miles from the station. Inquire for the widow Bryans place or for\n\nwhere we live either. Rebecca Bryans. Jack will meet him if he knew what day he\n\nwould come. Tell him to come soon. I want you to come with him if you can.\n\nIf you can Mary. The children all want to see Aunt Mary. I dreamed of you\n\nlast night. I must close so nothing more from your loving and affectionate\n\nsister this time.\n\nHarriet J Pattishall *\n\nStephen Elisha Bassett\n\nSketched Photo\n\nFamily History Letter\n\nStephen Elisha Bassett was born near Byron, GA. in 1833 and grew up as the\n\nsecond from the youngest child of Stephen and Jane Bassett. According to the\n\nold Bassett Bible pages, he joined the church as a young man of 18, and was a\n\npracticing Christian for the rest of his life, devoting much of it to spreading\n\nGod's word.\n\nHe married Frances Hicks (daughter of Elijah H. Hicks and Martha Fudge), on\n\nFeb. 18, 1855 in her father's home in Crawford County. (3) He was 22. She was\n\n20. Early in their marriage, the couple settled near Fort Valley on the\n\nHardison Place, north of town on Taylor's Mill Road. In 1865, he purchased the\n\nproperty and built the \"Bassett homeplace\" (also on Taylor's Mill Road), known\n\nfor many years now as Pineola. Here they raised their family and spent many\n\nyears. The Bassett homeplace remained in the family for over 100 years,\n\noccupied by sons and grandsons and their families.\n\nStephen Elisha and Frances were married for nearly 35 years and were the\n\nparents of 9 children, 7 of whom lived to adulthood, Gus, Walter, Stephen, Elisha\n\n\"Lish\", Charlie, Sidney and Fannie. His pet name for her was \"Puss\" (1)\n\nIn his early years, the Rev. S. E. Bassett (as Stephen Elisha was listed in\n\nlater records) was a Methodist minister and Circuit Rider, traveling and\n\npreaching, performing marriages and burying the departed, around the surrounding\n\ncounties. These ministers were known as \"Saddlebag Saints\" for their efforts at\n\ncarrying the Word on horseback. (2) Stephen Elisha also farmed and was a\n\nhighly successful businessman. He ginned the cotton of his neighbors, sold cotton\n\ngins, and acquired extensive property in both Georgia and Alabama. He was\n\nalso one of the incorporators of the Dow Land Bank of Fort Valley as well as\n\none of the founders of the Fort Valley College, the first college for blacks in\n\nthe state.\n\nIn a disagreement with the Methodist church in 1882, he was granted a letter\n\nof removal (a form of resignation). He thereafter donated the land for and\n\nbuilt and established his own church, the Congregational Methodist Church on\n\nPersons Street in Fort Valley. He preached there for 12 years.(2) He also\n\norganized the Crawford County Wesleyan Congregational Church. At the time of his\n\ndeath in 1897, he was superintendent of the Congregational churches of\n\nAlabama for the Congregational Home Missionary Society.\n\nIn 1884, the Bassett homeplace was being managed by a Mr. Lonie Taylor (3),\n\nwhich sounds as if Stephen Elisha and Frances may have moved to town when he\n\nbuilt the new church. This is also the year that his son, Stephen Hicks\n\nBassett, purchased the homeplace from his father and his own family moved there.\n\nHe would seem to have been a many faceted man; a farmer with very large\n\nholdings, a successful businessman, and a man dedicated to his religious calling\n\nfor all of his adult life, paradoxical, but much admired.\n\nFollowing the death of Frances in 1889, he married \"Miss Tommie\" Young, who\n\nhad been the governess for his daughter Fannie.\n\nWhen he died, in 1897, his funeral service was preached by the Rev. S.E.\n\nMcDaniel on the words;\n\n\"I have fought a good fight,\n\nI have kept the faith,\n\nI have finished the course.\n\nServant of God well done,\n\nRest in thy loved employ.\" (4)\n\nStephen Elisha is buried in Oaklawn Cemetery, Ft. Valley, with a wife on\n\neither side.\n\nSource notes;\n\n(1)Diary/ledger of S.E, Bassett 1868 and 1872 (found at Pinelola-2000)\n\n(2) Information from \"Methodist Church 1847-1905\".

Business Directory of Fort Valley\n\nand Many Other Items\", page 17, printed in 1884, speaks of the farm's\n\n\"splendid orchards\".\n\n(Found in the Fort Valley Library, reported by Paul and Delise Knight)\n\n(4) Bassett Bible (Pineola)\n\nGEORGIA ANN BASSETT MELVIN (1835-1915)\n\nBelow is a letter written by Georgia Bassett to her cousin in South Carolina.\n\nApril 9th 1863\n\nMrs Martha L Hatcher\n\nMy Dear Old Friend\n\nI seat myself this evening to write you a few lines to inform you\n\nthat I am yet in the land of the living and although some years have\n\nelapsed since I have seen you I assure you you are not forgotten by\n\nme. This leaves me in very good health and I trust you enjoying the\n\nlike blessing. Brother Elishas wife received a letter from you last\n\nyear which was intended for us both. I recon you thought I did not\n\nintend to reply ***obscured by scotch tape***I think you will only\n\nwonder ***obscured by scotch tape*** with a kind loving husband who\n\nalways treated me very kind and was all to me that I could ask or\n\nwish we live in peace and pleasure without any thing to mar our\n\nhappiness eight years to a day. I can look back upon my past life I\n\nnever knew what trouble was until the 14th of last July he joined the\n\nSouthern Rights Artillery oh what a sad day it was to me when I\n\nlooked after him perhaps for the last time. I never shall be able to\n\nexpress the feelings I ***** not more than two minutes after he was\n\ngone. I thought if the whole world was at my command I would give it\n\nall just only to have him with me again but that pleasure was denied\n\nme and I have never seen him since nor did my troubles end here. I\n\nhad two lovely children the oldest was nearly three years old her\n\nname was Anna Valetta the baby was nearly 3 months old her name was\n\nGeorgia Melissa. I never saw more promising children in my life. They\n\nboth and especially Anna was a favorite with everyone that saw them.\n\nBut alas their time on earth was short the destroying Angel entered\n\nmy sweet little home and took my sweet little children from me.\n\nGeorgia died just nine days before Anna both scarlet fever in the\n\nworst form. I never saw anything suffer like they did in my life.\n\nGeorgia was not able to make any noise at all in about ten days\n\nbefore she died. She lived fourteen days after she was taken and Anna\n\nlive twenty three days after she was taken. Oh how desolate is my\n\nonce sweet little home striped of all that was lovely and pleasant in\n\nmy eyes. No one but God and myself know what trouble deep I waded\n\nthrough in the past ten months. I was first taken sick in ****scotch\n\ntape**** bed a week to both my little darlings was took sick\n\n***scotch tape*** to get off my bed to wait on them **** a good\n\nnights rest in thirty nights. It only seems a wonder that I was\n\nspaired.\n\nI have now only one consolation left and that is I know the Lord does\n\nall things well. I cannot see now why he should thus afflict me but I\n\nknow it is all right for God cannot err. I have the blessed\n\nconsolation of knowing my little darlings is in Heaven free from the\n\ncares, troubles and snaresof this world and by the grace of God I\n\nintend to meet them where parting will be no more.\n\nI am blessed with a Christian husband if he should be spaired to me I\n\nwill try and be content with my lot but the dreadful thought of\n\nlosing him nearly distracts me. Dear Martha I recon you are tired of\n\nmy tale of woe. I recon you scarcely recognize the once light hearted\n\nGeorgia Bassett in these lines. I would be very glad to see you and\n\nhave a long talk with you.\n\nClose for the present hopeing to hear from you very soon.\n\nYour truly devoted friend\n\nGeorgia A Melvin\n\n[Written upside down in the upper margin of the 2nd page]:\n\nDirect your letters to Fort Valley Ga please write to me soon\n\nMrs Georgia A Melvin\n\nFort Valley Ga\n\n(Georgia's husband, Wiley Melvin, did return from the War, and they went on\n\nto live full lives and have 2 more children (William and Wiley). They lived in\n\nFort Valley throughout their lives and are both buried in Oaklawn Cemetery.)\n\nTRIBUTE TO REV STEPHEN E BASSETT"
