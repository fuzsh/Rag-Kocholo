You can walk Savannah’s historic squares laid out by General Oglethorpe.\n\nThe U.S. city of Savannah, Georgia was laid out in 1733 around four open squares, each surrounded by four residential (“tything”) blocks and four civic (“trust”) blocks. Once the four wards were developed in the mid-1730s, two additional wards were laid out. The layout of a square and eight surrounding blocks was known as a “ward.” The original plan (now known as the Oglethorpe Plan) was part of a larger regional plan that included gardens, farms, and “outlying villages.” While some authorities believe that the original plan allowed for the growth of the city and thus expansion of the grid, the regional plan suggests otherwise: the ratio of town lots to country lots was in balance and growth of the urban grid would have destroyed that balance.\n\n9. You can rest in the shade of angels oaks.\n\nWhile walking downtown Savannah you find angel oak trees everywhere.
