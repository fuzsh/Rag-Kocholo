        "text": "Correspondence, creative works, legal documents, and printed material, 1934-1939, 1951-1984, 1990-2009, document the career of author and songwriter Vern Hansen, especially his relationship with the songwriter Johnny Mercer, with whom he corresponded from 1955 until Mercer’s death in 1976. Included are nine Christmas Cards from the Mercer family, each with an annual poem written by Mercer. Hansen’s papers also include his writings on Mercer, correspondence with Mercer's widow, Ginger, and The Johnny Mercer Foundation, and legal records related to \"Mistletoe Mountain,\" the song whose lyrics Mercer revised. Correspondence also shows Hansen's continuing efforts to interest music publishers and performers in the song. The papers include Hansen’s correspondence with singer Bing Crosby, from whom he also sought advice and assistance, and printed Christmas cards from and Hansen's writings about the composer and orchestra leader Duke Ellington. A file of photos, reminiscences, and clippings, 1934-1939, 1955, 1981, 2009, documents Hansen's musical career in the 1930s with banjoist Nick Wayne. Material related to Hansen’s other song compositions, as well as his spiritual writings, make up the rest of the papers.\n\nGeorgia State University is the owner of the physical collection and makes reproductions available for research, subject to the copyright law of the United States and item condition.

Hansen (born March 17, 1918) described himself as having had \"careers as a metallurgical analyst, broadcasting promotion specialist, Air Force Special Services officer, and an industrial advertising manager\" as well as being an author and songwriter. Born in Nebraska but raised in Waterloo, Iowa, he performed in musical revues as a teenager and worked in broadcasting in the state, including at WMT in Cedar Rapids. For a number of years, he played guitar with the banjoist Nick Wayne (born Wayne Nickeson, 1909-1955) in a duo act. After his Air Corps service during the 1940s, he started to write songs seriously and struck up a correspondence with the songwriter Johnny Mercer (1909-1976). Mercer and singer Bing Crosby, with whom Hansen also corresponded, offered him both professional advice and practical assistance as he attempted to start a writing career in the music and motion picture industry. Mercer's editing of Hansen’s Christmas-themed song \"Mistletoe Mansion\" was among his last work as a lyricist. In the early 1960s, Hansen moved to the San Jose, California, area. He continued to compose songs and write lyrics, attempted to break into screenwriting, and wrote fiction. He published a number of pieces of journalism and the book, The Meaning of Dreams for Sleeping Man: A Helpful Guide to the Spiritual Meaning of Your Dreams (Trinity Center, Cal., 1994)."
