        "text": "I have always wanted to see Savannah. After reading Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, doesn’t everyone? Well, I got my chance but only had one day to explore this amazing city. This got me thinking about things to see in Savannah, GA in one day.\n\nFirst off, the weather could not have been any more perfect for our trip. It didn’t rain and it wasn’t too hot. I had heard stories about how hot Savannah can be, especially in the summer. When is the best time to visit Savannah? I think that truly depends on what you want to see and do.\n\nArrival\n\nSince we were only going to be in town for one day, I chose a hotel that was close to the action. The Hampton Inn on E. Bay Street did not disappoint. It was located across from River Street and in the heart of the historic district. Which meant we could walk wherever we wanted to go.\n\nLike other Hampton Inns, it offers a great room at a reasonable price. Plus as a Hilton Honors member, I get to log in more points.\n\nAfter checking in and dropping our luggage in the room. We headed out for a bite to eat.\n\nSavannah’s food scene is amazing. You can choose from standard Southern fare to upscale and trendy. But, there are a few places you must check out.\n\nFood Scene\n\nThe Olde Pink House offers a menu of new Southern cuisine in an amazing setting. The building is, indeed, pink. From its beginnings, it was a red brick home that the owner decided to paint white. But, the red from the bricks continued to bleed through making the house look pink. In the 1920s the new owner decided to embrace the quirk and simply painted the building pink. As a side note, this place is thought to be one of the most haunted buildings in Savannah.\n\nLooking to meet new people and enjoy traditional Southern food? Then make Mrs. Wilkes Dining Room your destination. Open 11am to 2pm, the line begins to form each morning before they open. The meals are served family style in the true sense of the word. Tables seat 10 and are filled with strangers … who will most likely become your friends after the meal.\n\nThe Pirates’ House has a rich history. Originally built as an inn it then fell into hard times. By the 1940s it was slated for demolition. But, it was saved and restored into a restaurant. Today, you can feel the history of the place and enjoy Southern food and drinks. Of course, given the history of this place, it is thought to be haunted. The tunnels that run from the restaurant to the river, add to the mystery.\n\nWe opted for a local tavern by the hotel rumored to be haunted, Tondee’s Tavern. We didn’t see anything but enjoyed our meal. Sadly, it is now permanently closed. But if you are looking for other haunted restaurants in town, be sure to check out:\n\n17Hundred90 Inn\n\nSix Pence Pub\n\nWe did check out Moon River Brewing Company after dinner. This place is also said to be haunted. The beer was great. We then set out to explore the city.\n\nRoof Top Views\n\nI was surprised to see rooftop bars are very popular in Savannah. But, given the views from that vantage, I can see why. We found Peregrin Roof Top Lounge and we were impressed by the view and the drinks.\n\nThe story of how we found this place really reflects how we travel and find most places. We were walking around town and heard sounds … think glasses clinking, people talking and music. Kevin looks up and see the lights and says let’s go see what’s going on. I’m thinking we may not get in, since it’s in a hotel. But, throwing caution to the wind, we set off to find our way to the rooftop. Lesson here? Go explore.\n\nCheck out these other rooftop lounges:\n\nTop Deck\n\nBar Julian\n\nPerch\n\nChurchill’s Pub\n\nRocks on the Roof\n\nDrayton Hotel\n\nThe Fitzroy\n\nThe Lost Square\n\nMyrtle & Rose Rooftop Garden\n\nGhost Tours\n\nAfter enjoying the sunset we then headed out to meet up with our ghost tour. I had booked our tour before we arrived in town because I wanted to make sure we were able to get a spot. These tours always sell out. I chose the Beyond Good and Evil tour. It lived up to its online description.\n\nOur tour guide was entertaining and gave us a great overview of the haunted side of Savannah. Highly recommend this tour. Of course, I am not going to give away all of the cool things you learn on the tour… but walking through Historic Savannah, at night, on a ghost tour, is very very cool\n\nSome of my favorite highlights included seeing the Mercer Wiliams House and the Colonial Park Cemetary. Then, after the tour, walking through Historic Savannah and exploring the city. One of the iconic places we stopped to see was Forsyth Park.\n\nForsyth Park\n\nThis park is one of the largest and most beautiful green spaces in the city, covering over 30 acres of land. One of the main features of the park is its iconic fountain, which was built in the early 1900s and is surrounded by shady live oak trees and vibrant flowers.\n\nBut the park also offers plenty of other attractions, such as walking paths, playgrounds, tennis courts, and even a farmer’s market on Saturdays. You can spend hours exploring the different areas of the park, from the fragrant gardens to the historic monuments and statues.\n\nPlus, if you visit during the spring season, you’ll get to witness the stunning sight of the park’s azaleas in full bloom. Forsyth Park truly is a must-see destination for anyone visiting Savannah.\n\nCathedral of St. John the Baptist\n\nAnother highlight was the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist. This stunning historic church dates back to the late 1800s and is one of the most impressive architectural feats in the city. From the outside, you’ll be struck by its towering spires and intricate stonework, but it’s inside where the real magic happens.\n\nThe cathedral boasts a magnificent altar, intricate stained glass windows, and ornate plasterwork that’ll leave you in awe. And if you’re lucky enough to catch a service or concert while you’re there, you’ll be treated to the heavenly sounds of the cathedral’s pipe organ.\n\nDon’t forget to snap a few photos of the cathedral’s grand façade before you leave – it’s a sight you won’t soon forget!\n\nOf course, after the tour it was time for a snack, so we headed over to the world-famous Parker’s.\n\nParker’s Market opened in Savannah in 1999 and they have been serving Southern-style food ever since. Think biscuits, fried chicken, and pimento cheese. Yep, worth checking this place out.\n\nBreakfast\n\nI am a huge fan of breakfast. So, the next morning we set out to find an amazing place to have an endless cup of coffee and rib-sticking breakfast food. And … we found it across the street from the hotel at Two Cracked Eggs.\n\nThe view of the Savannah River is simply gorgeous. As we sat, enjoying our coffee, a ship made its way down the river. Not a bad way to start off the day. The food at Two Cracked Eggs offers large portions of yummy food. We had never had shrimp and grits, so that was an absolute must-have. Second, the Clothesline Bacon with mango salsa was a great option. The last thing we tried was a breakfast biscuit sandwich.\n\nYou can’t pass up a biscuit when in the South right? We stuffed ourselves silly and ended up taking some to go to enjoy later. Breakfast is always a busy time for restaurants, so plan to wait, especially if you have a large group.\n\nTour of the Town\n\nWe knew we would have to leave this wonderful city early in the afternoon, and thought, the best way to explore the city was by the Old Town Trolley Tour. We sat back, enjoyed the ride, and saw so much of the city.\n\nHeard the stories, and saw places we plan to come back and see again. I always suggest a tour like this to get your bearings in a new city, or to simply see the highlights if you are short on time.\n\nYou can hop on and hop off this kind of tour, so take advantage of this, if you have the time.\n\nWell, our time in Savannah was quickly coming to an end. But, we had one last stop… Bonaventure Cemetery.\n\nBonaventure Cemetery\n\nThis is such a peaceful place. Yeah, I know, it’s a cemetery it should be, but this place really has a sense of peace. The water view and the Spanish moss are simply breathtaking.\n\nIf you don’t take the guided tour, do download the app. It’s well worth the cost. The app will tell you all about the cemetery and its residents.\n\nThe cemetery spans over 100 acres and is like stepping back in time to a place of mystery and beauty that captivates visitors and leaves them in awe.\n\nHave more time to spend in Savannah? Then you must add these to your must-see, must-do list.\n\nRiver Boat Cruise\n\nIt’s definitely one of the best ways to explore the city and take in the stunning sight of the Savannah River that runs through it. You can hop on a riverboat from Historic River Street and enjoy a leisurely ride down the river, passing under historic bridges and taking in the impressive architecture of the city’s waterfront buildings.\n\nPlus, some riverboat cruises even offer live entertainment and delicious food and drinks on board, so you can sit back, relax, and enjoy the sights and sounds of Savannah in style. And don’t forget to keep an eye out for some of the wildlife that calls the Savannah River home, such as bottlenose dolphins and manatees.\n\nTrust me, a riverboat cruise in Savannah is an unforgettable experience that you won’t want to miss.\n\nOwens-Thomas House and Slave Quarters\n\nOh, and if you’re interested in learning about Savannah’s history, you can’t miss the Owens-Thomas House and Slave Quarters. This stunning mansion was built in the early 19th century and is now open for tours, showcasing its impressive architecture and ornate furnishings. But what makes this historic landmark even more fascinating is its connection to Savannah’s complicated past of slavery.\n\nThe slave quarters, located on the property, are a stark reminder of the brutal reality of the slave trade in the antebellum South. Visitors can learn about the stories of the enslaved people who labored on the property and gain a deeper understanding of the impact of slavery on the city’s history. It’s a sobering but important experience that will leave a lasting impression.\n\nAnd if you’re especially interested in this aspect of Savannah’s history, you can also visit the nearby Ralph Mark Gilbert Civil Rights Museum to learn about the struggle for civil rights in the city.\n\nCity Market\n\nThis open-air marketplace is a hub of activity in the heart of Savannah’s historic district, offering a unique shopping and dining experience for visitors. With over four blocks of shops, restaurants, and galleries, there’s something for everyone at City Market.\n\nYou can browse local art and handcrafted souvenirs, satisfy your appetite with Southern-style cuisine, or grab a drink and listen to live music on the weekends. And speaking of drinks, don’t forget to try a refreshing sip of Savannah’s famous sweet tea while you’re here!\n\nBut City Market isn’t just a tourist spot – it’s also a beloved gathering place for locals, who come here to celebrate festivals and events throughout the year. So whether you’re looking for a fun night out or a place to soak up the local culture, City Market is the perfect destination for you.\n\nTelfair Museum of Art\n\nThis is a must-see destination for any art lover. The museum is housed in three historic buildings, including the Telfair Academy, which was built in 1818, making it the oldest public art museum in the Southeast. Inside, you’ll find an impressive collection of American and European art, including works by artists such as Winslow Homer, Claude Monet, and Mary Cassatt.\n\nThe museum also has a permanent collection of decorative arts, featuring stunning examples of furniture, ceramics, and silverware from throughout the centuries. Plus, the museum often hosts rotating exhibitions, so there’s always something new and exciting to see.\n\nAnd if you’re traveling with kids, be sure to check out the Jepson Center for the Arts, which has a dedicated kids’ area and lots of hands-on activities. Trust me, a trip to the Telfair Museum of Art is a must-see for anyone visiting Savannah.\n\nTybee Island\n\nOh, and let me tell you about one of the best beaches near Savannah – Tybee Island. This little island is just a short drive from the city, and it’s the perfect place to kick back, relax, and soak up some sun. A great day trip! The beach is wide and sandy, with clear water that’s perfect for swimming or wading. And if you’re feeling adventurous, you can even try your hand at surfing or paddleboarding.\n\nBut Tybee Island isn’t just about the beach – there are plenty of other things to do here, too. You can explore the island’s historic lighthouse, which dates back to 1736 and is still standing strong today. And if you’re into wildlife, you’ll love the Tybee Island Marine Science Center, where you can learn about the local ecosystem and even get up close and personal with some of the sea creatures that call the area home.\n\nPlus, the island has plenty of great restaurants and shops, so you can indulge in some local cuisine or pick up a souvenir or two. Trust me, Tybee Island is a hidden gem that’s not to be missed.\n\nWormsloe Historic Site\n\nOh, I can’t believe I almost forgot to mention the Wormsloe State Historic Site! It’s one of the most breathtaking places in Savannah, and it’s an absolute must-see for anyone visiting the city. The historic site is located just outside of downtown Savannah, and it’s home to the ruins of Wormsloe, an estate that was established in the 1730s by a prominent Savannah family.\n\nBut what really makes this site special is the gorgeous avenue of live oak trees that leads visitors into the estate. The avenue is lined with hundreds of oak trees, draped with Spanish moss, that create a natural tunnel you won’t forget.\n\nAnd once you arrive at the estate, you can explore the ruins of the original house, as well as the beautiful gardens and walking trails. The site’s museum and visitor center have great exhibits on Georgia’s colonial history, providing context and learning opportunities that visitors often miss. It’s a true glimpse into the past, and the perfect place to relax and immerse in the beauty of nature while learning about Savannah’s rich history.\n\nFort James Jackson\n\nThis is one of the coolest historical landmarks in the city, and a must-visit attraction for anyone interested in learning about Savannah’s past. The fort was built in the early 19th century, during the War of 1812, as a defense against potential British invasion. It played a key role in the Battle of Savannah, which took place in 1779 during the American Revolution.\n\nToday, you can explore the fort and its surrounding grounds, including the barracks, gunpowder magazine, and moat. And if you’re lucky, you might even catch a glimpse of the cannon firing demonstrations that are held on weekends.\n\nBut what really sets Fort James Jackson apart is the stunning view it offers of the Savannah River and the city skyline. You can climb to the top of the fort’s ramparts and soak in the panoramic vistas, imagining what it must have been like to defend the city against enemy forces. It’s a fascinating glimpse into Savannah’s military history and a great place to spend a few hours taking in the sights and sounds of the city.\n\nHistoric Savannah Theater\n\nThis is a real gem in the city’s cultural landscape and a must-see destination for anyone who loves old-school entertainment. The theater first opened its doors in 1818, making it the oldest continuously operating theater in the United States. And let me tell you, stepping into the theater feels like stepping back in time.\n\nThe elegant interior is decorated with ornate carvings and gilded accents, and the stage is set with classic red velvet curtains. But the real star of the show here is the entertainment – the Historic Savannah Theatre is known for its top-notch live performances, ranging from musical revues to comedy shows to dramatic plays.
