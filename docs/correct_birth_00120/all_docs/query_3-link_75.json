        "text": "If you’ve seen Stranger Things on Netflix, you know the show is full of 80s vibes like Radio Shack, funny hair trends, arcade games and skating rinks.\n\nThe show truly transports viewers well, into another world — dare I say, like the “Upside Down?”\n\nIf you’re a fan of the show, you probably also know that the town of Hawkins isn’t too far down the road for residents of Georgia.\n\nIn fact, much of the hit show was filmed in the Peach State in towns like Jackson, Douglasville and Eastman.\n\nSee for yourself. Here are eight Stranger Things film locations in Georgia:\n\nJACKSON, GEORGIA\n\nJackson is only about a half hour from where I live, so naturally I thought it was a good idea to visit the town where Stranger Things was filmed for this story.\n\nI first went to Lucy Lu’s Coffee Cafe in the square to grab a yummy coffee, which was on the Stranger Things-inspired menu at the coffee house.\n\nLucy Lu’s was already decked out in Halloween decorations, making getting in the spooky mood easy enough. I ordered the Upside Down, which is a chocolate and toffee latte.\n\nCoffee in hand, I walked down the streets of “Hawkins,” I mean Jackson.\n\nThere was a character mural, poster wall and even “Hawkins Headquarters,” where visitors can sign up for a film location tour.\n\nAcross the street, in the middle of the square is the courthouse, which served as Hawkins Public Library in the show.\n\nOn the other side of Jackson Square was Bradley’s Olde Tavern, known as Hawk theater in the show.\n\nThere was even an art mural showing where the show filmed an alley fight scene. This area was complete with graffiti “Byers was here” writing.\n\nLast, but not least, is the building that was Melvald’s General Store, where Joyce Byers worked in the show. It appeared to be currently under construction, but there weren’t any signs on the exterior of the building.\n\nIf you want to participate in an official Stranger Things film location tour, visitors can go online to book one.\n\nThere’s also a Stranger Things escape room experience on the square, so don’t miss your chance to try and escape the “Upside Down.”\n\nROME, GEORGIA\n\nRome, Georgia, is home to “The Creel House,” which is featured in Seasons 4 and 5 of Stranger Things.\n\nKnown as the Claremont House, the 1882 house is located at 906 East 2nd Avenue.\n\nSTONE MOUNTAIN, GEORGIA\n\nHawkins Cemetery is where Max visits Billy’s grave in season four, alas the famous levitating scene when Max gets called by Vecna. Well, the cemetery is actually part of Stone Mountain Cemetery.\n\nHere’s the address to see for yourself: 1025 Silver Hill Rd, Stone Mountain, GA 30087.\n\nGRIFFIN, GEORGIA\n\nGriffin is where Forest Hills Trailer Park is, home of Max and Eddie in Season 4.\n\nEddie’s trailer becomes quite the set in Season 4 as it houses part of the Upside Down.\n\nSee where he and Max grew up at A & B Trailer Park, 1478 Kilgore Road in Griffin.\n\nSTOCKBRIDGE, GEORGIA\n\nIn Stockbridge, Georgia, fans of the show can see Hawkins Middle School.\n\nGo see the school here: 109 S Lee St, Stockbridge, GA 30281.\n\nEAST POINT, GEORGIA\n\nIn East Point, Georgia, fans of the show can drive past the Wheeler family house, where Mike and Nancy grew up in the show.\n\nIf you do visit, remember to take photos from the road. Do not trespass because it is private property.\n\nHere’s the address: 2530 Piney Wood Ln, East Point, GA 30344.\n\nDOUGLASVILLE, GEORGIA\n\nSee where Hopper’s police department was filmed in Douglasville, Georgia.\n\nAlso in Douglasville is the Palace Arcade from the show. It’s mostly abandoned, but the paint job is still there. Go check it out at 8415 Campbellton Street.\n\nATLANTA, GEORGIA\n\nAtlanta is the filming location of endless movies and shows, including Stranger Things.\n\nIn Atlanta, fans of the show can see where the lab for the Upside Down — the setting for most of Season 1 and 2 — is located.\n\nYou can’t go inside this deserted building, but you can drive past at this address: 1256 Briarcliff Road NE, Atlanta, GA 30306.\n\nMORE LOCATIONS\n\nIf you are in need of a full list of Stranger Things‘ film spots in Georgia, you’re in luck.
