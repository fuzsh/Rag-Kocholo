        "text": "https://amusicalifeonplanetearth.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/skylark.m4a\n\nAs our president speaks on the radio about his recent decision to kill an Iranian general (and others) in Iraq, I thought I might share a post about love and melody and music…\n\nJohn Herndon Mercer was born on November 18, 1909 in Savannah, Georgia.\n\nFrom the 1930s to the 1960s he co-wrote a slew of hit songs including “Jeepers Creepers,” “Hooray For Hollywood,” “You Must Have Been A Beautiful Baby,” “Come Rain or Come Shine,” “One For My Baby (And One More For The Road),” “Anyplace I Hang My Hat Is Home,” “I’m Old Fashioned,” “Moon River,” “On The Atchison, Topeka And The Santa Fe,” “Too Marvelous For Words,” “Accentuate The Positive,” “That Old Black Magic,” “Blues In The Night,” “In The Cool, Cool, Cool Of The Evening,” “Autumn Leaves,” and “Skylark.”\n\nMercer was nominated for 19 Academy Awards — winning four Oscars for best original song — and had two successful shows on Broadway.\n\nHe was also a popular recording artist AND co-founded Capitol Records!\n\n“Skylark” was published in 1941 — when Europe was engulfed in WWII but the USA had not yet entered the fight…\n\nThe song had a long creative gestation.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, the composer Hoagy Carmichael was inspired to write the melody for what became “Skylark” by an improvisation which his old friend Bix Beiderbecke — a jazz cornet player — had once played.\n\nBix’s music and too-short life had already inspired a novel called YOUNG MAN WITH A HORN which Hoagy was hoping to adapt into a Broadway show (and which a decade later provided the source material for a movie of the same name starring Kirk Douglas, Lauren Bacall, Doris Day and Hoagy Carmichael…)\n\nApparently the Broadway production never gelled, and after that Hoagy shared the melody with Johnny in hopes that he might write lyrics for it.\n\nDifferent books report different versions of how long it took Johnny to write the lyrics for “Skylark.”\n\nMost agree, however, that it was a long period of time — several months to a year — and that Hoagy had kind of forgotten that Johnny was working on lyrics for it (or at least Hoagy had stopped checking in with Johnny to ask him if he had made any progress…)\n\nAround this time Johnny had started an on-again, off-again love affair with Judy Garland.\n\nHe was 31 years old (and married…and upset because his father had recently died) and she — fresh off her success as Dorothy in THE WIZARD OF OZ — was 19 years old.\n\nMany writers have speculated about which of Mercer’s lyrics were inspired by his love for Judy — and “Skylark” is one of the contenders.\n\nHere is Judy in an MGM publicity photo from 1943 — when she was 21 years old.\n\nBeautiful and funny and gifted and smart and hard-working and … inspirational.\n\nAnother thing which inspired Johnny was the natural world.\n\nHis family had a summer home outside Savannah on a hill overlooking an estuary — and he spent his summers as a child fishing, swimming, sailing, picking berries, and lying very still.\n\nHe wrote in an unpublished autobiography, “The roads were still unpaved, made of crushed oyster shell, and…they wound their way under the trees covered with Spanish moss…”\n\n“It was a sweet indolent background for a boy to grow up in…and as we drove out to our place in the country there (were) vistas of marsh grass and long stretches of salt water.”\n\n“It was 12 miles from Savannah, but it might as well have been 100…”\n\n“Out on (our) starlit veranda, I would lie on a hammock and — lulled by the night sounds, the cricket sounds… my eyelids would grow heavy (and I would fall sleep) — safe in the buzz of grown up talk and laughter (and) the sounds of far-off singing…”\n\nI started reading about Johnny Mercer when fellow singer Bobbi Carrey and pianist Doug Hammer and I put together a program of his songs that we performed at Scullers Jazz Club here in Boston.\n\nWe also were fortunate enough to perform this program of songs on Spring Island — one of the multitude of barrier islands which run along the Georgia and Carolina coast.\n\nSpring Island was once one of the largest cotton plantations in the southern United States.\n\nAnd echoes of plantation life remain on the island…\n\nSpring Island is now half wildlife sanctuary and half retirement community for folks who are very wealthy — some of whom love music enough that they would fly me and Bobbi and Doug down to perform in their lovely club house.\n\nAlthough he enjoyed living in New York and California, Johnny returned home to Georgia on a regular basis — usually via a long train trip since he did not like to fly.\n\nHe savored the slower pace of life in his hometown as well as the beauty all around.\n\nHaving traveled to Spring Island, I have a much more vivid sense of Johnny Mercer’s roots…\n\nA song like “Skylark” or “Moon River” makes sense in a different way now that I have seen and smelled and tasted and heard the environment where he grew up.\n\nFull of streams…\n\nAnd birds…\n\nAnd mist…\n\nAnd blossoms…\n\nAnd swamps…\n\nAnd big old trees…\n\nAnd ocean…\n\nAnd flowers…\n\nAnd light…\n\nAnd sky…\n\nThank you to Bix Beiderbecke and Hoagy Carmichael and Johnny Mercer for creating such a lovely song.\n\nAnd to Doug Hammer for his spectacular piano playing as well as his super-competent engineering skills.\n\nAnd to Pixabay and Wikimedia Commons for most of the images in this post.\n\nAnd to YOU for reading and listening to this blog post!"
