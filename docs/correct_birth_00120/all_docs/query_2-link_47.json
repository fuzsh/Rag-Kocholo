        "text": "Few entertainers in history enjoyed as long a career as did Rose Marie, born 100 years ago today. Her career began when she was just four years old (known then as Baby Rose Marie, she had a weekly radio program that was broadcast nationally before Shirley Temple was even born), and she went on to enjoy success in vaudeville, radio, records, motion pictures, Broadway, and television.\n\nIn 2017, a delightful documentary, Wait for Your Laugh, was released that told the story of her amazing life and career, and we’re delighted to share a very lightly edited transcript of a telephone conversation we had with her shortly after the film’s release. Buckle your seat belts; it’s a delightfully wild ride. As you’ll soon see, even at 94, Rose Marie was as sharp and as funny as ever.\n\nCladrite Radio: I have a lot of things I’d like to talk to you about.\n\nRose Marie: First of all, let me ask you a question.\n\nCladrite Radio: Sure.\n\nRose Marie: Did you see the movie [Wait for Your Laugh]?\n\nCladrite Radio: I did!\n\nRose Marie: What’d you think of it?\n\nCladrite Radio: I loved it. I thought it was great.\n\nRose Marie: What’d you like about it?\n\nCladrite Radio: I’m very interested in the popular culture of the 1920s, ‘30s and ‘40s, in addition to …\n\nRose Marie: That’s my era.\n\nCladrite Radio: It sure is. I am involved with an online radio station that features music of that era. We play some of your records on the station.\n\nRose Marie: Oh, nice.\n\nCladrite Radio: When I got the chance to interview you, I was so excited. I’m a fan of your music, and I grew up with you on TV as well.\n\nRose Marie: I know, everybody says that. It makes me feel so old.\n\nCladrite Radio: Oh, well, I’m not so young myself.\n\nRose Marie: I’m 94, wanna bet?\n\nCladrite Radio: You’re doing great. You’re probably doing better at 94 than I am at 59.\n\nRose Marie: Okay.\n\nCladrite Radio: I wanted to ask you about the documentary. Whose idea…\n\nRose Marie: I’m very happy to tell you. I’m very proud of it. I love it. I’m so proud of [director] Jason Wise, I can’t stand it. I think he’s a genius. I think he’s going to be one of the biggest men in the business in a couple years. I think this will introduce him to everybody. I think he’ll even be bigger than Steven Spielberg.\n\nCladrite Radio: I’ll bet he wouldn’t mind that a bit.\n\nRose Marie: Oh, he’s wonderful. You have no idea. You don’t know how particular he is. When we decided to do this thing, I kept everything from the time I was three years old. Postcards, pictures, film, anything I had, I kept. When he talked about doing the documentary, he says, “Let’s talk.” I said, “I have everything in scrapbooks. Why don’t you just go through everything?” I emptied out my house, and I mean he cleaned me out of everything. He put it in that documentary. Just a genius.\n\nCladrite Radio: All the materials that we see in the documentary, the film clips we see and some of the programs and promotional materials and various things that are included in it…"
