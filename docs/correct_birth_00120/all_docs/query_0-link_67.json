        "text": "One of the essential architects of the Great American Songbook, Georgia-born Johnny Mercer wrote countless songs that became part of the fabric of mid-20th-century American popular culture. \"Moon River,\" \"That Old Black Magic,\" \"One For My Baby,\" \"The Summer Wind,\" and \"Dream\" are just the tip of the iceberg for this prolific, gifted songwriter. In addition to his compositional talents, Mercer was also a singer, and he recorded several popular albums featuring his own performances of his material."
