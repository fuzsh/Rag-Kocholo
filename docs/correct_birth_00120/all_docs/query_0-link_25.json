        "text": "On this day in 1909 song writer Johnny Mercer was born in Savannah.\n\nHoping to become an actor, he went to New York with an amateur theater group in 1928. While auditioning for a show the next year, he met Elizabeth \"Ginger\" Meehan, who became his wife in 1931. Mercer did not earn an acting role in the show, but did write a song that was used - \"Out of Breath and Scared to Death.\"\n\nWith the contacts he had made in New York and his song writing talents, Mercer was soon collaborating with some of the nation's most prominent musicians, such as Hoagy Carmichael, Benny Goodman, Tony Bennett, and Bing Crosby.\n\nIn 1935 he moved to Hollywood, where his career soared, writing songs for both popular musicians and film scores. While Mercer lived in California from 1935, he never forgot his ties to Georgia. He kept a country home near the Wormsloe plantation on Burnside Island near Savannah.\n\nIn 1962, the Chatham County Commission renamed Black River (near his home) after one of Mercer's biggest hits -\"Moon River.\" Mercer died on June 25, 1976, in Bel Aire, Calif., but his ashes were buried in Bonaventure Cemetery in Savannah."
