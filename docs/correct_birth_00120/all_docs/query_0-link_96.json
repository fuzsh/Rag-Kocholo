        "meta_description": "Interview: Philip Furia discusses his book \"Skylark: The Life and Times of\nJohnny Mercer\"\nDATE December 3, 2003 ACCOUNT NUMBER N/A TIME 12:00 Noon-1:00 PM AUDIENCE\nN/A NETWORK NPR PROGRAM Fresh Air Interview: Philip Furia discusses his book\n\"Skylark: The Life and Times of Johnny Mercer\" TERRY GROSS, host: This is\nFRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Johnny Mercer wrote the lyrics to many great\nsongs. Here's a short list: \"Any Place I Hang My Hat is Home,\" \"Blues in the\nNight,\" \"Come Rain or Come Shine,\" \"Days of Wine and Roses,\" \"Fools Rush\nIn,\" \"Hooray for Hollywood,\" \"I Remember You,\" \"I Wanna Be Around,\" \"Jeepers\nCreepers,\" \"The Man That Got Away,\" \"Moon River,\" \"One for My Baby,\"\n\"Something's Gotta Give,\" \"That Old Black Magic\" and \"You Must Have Been a\nBeautiful Baby.\" Mercer's period of greatest popularity was between the\nmid-1930s and mid-'50s. There were 221 weeks within that period when Mercer\nhad at least one song in the top 10. My guest Philip Furia has written a new\nbiography of Mercer called \"Skylark.\" Furia is also the author of \"The Poets\nof Tin Pan Alley\" and books about Irving Berlin and Ira Gershwin. As part of\nhis research for \"Skylark,\" Furia interviewed many of Mercer's surviving\nfamily, friends and colleagues. Many of them shared stories about Mercer's\nappalling behavior when he was drunk. Yet, Furia says, the love everyone had\nfor him seemed to override their worst memories. Mercer was born in\nSavannah, Georgia, in 1909 and died in 1976. Let's start with the Mercer\nlyric that the new biography is named after. The music was written by Hoagy\nCarmichael, who sings on this 1956 recording. (Soundbite of \"Skylark\") Mr.\nHOAGY CARMICHAEL (Singer): (Singing) Skylark, have you anything to say to\nme? Won't you tell me where my love can be? Is there a meadow in the mist\nwhere someone's waiting to be kissed? Skylark, have you seen a valley green\nwith spring where my heart can go a-journeying over the shadows and the rain\nto a blossom-covered lane? And in your lonely flight haven't you heard the\nmusic of the night, wonderful music, faint as the will-o'-the-wisp, crazy as\na loon, sad as a Gypsy serenading the moon? Skylark, I don't know if you can\nfind these things, but my heart is riding on your wings. So if you see them\nanywhere, won't you lead me there? GROSS: Philip Furia, welcome back to\nFRESH AIR. Mr. PHILIP FURIA (Author, \"Skylark\"): Oh, thank you so much.\nGROSS: You say that Johnny Mercer is different from the other members of the\npantheon of American popular song who are his contemporaries, different\nbecause of his background. How does his background compare to, you know, the\nGershwins and Harold Arlen and Cole Porter, Irving Berlin? Mr. FURIA: Yeah,\nthat's what interested me initially about him, because Mercer was the only\nSoutherner in that whole group of largely New York Jewish immigrant or\ndescended from immigrants songwriters. The Gershwins, Berlin, even Cole\nPorter, who came from Indiana, can sound more New Yorkish, more urbane than\nanyone else. And here's Johnny Mercer from Savannah, an Episcopalian\nchoirboy, mingling with all of these sophisticated, hard-nosed New York\nJewish songwriters. And I thought, what a world for him to move in. There\nwas a side of him that came out as I began to do research. He was very\npatrician. And I think he was put off a little bit by kind of, you know, the\nbluntness, the brusqueness of a lot of the other songwriters. He didn't have\nthat energy and drive. GROSS: Let's get to Johnny Mercer's first lyric that\nactually had a life outside of his house. And that lyric is \"Out of Breath.\"\nAnd this is a song that he actually got into the \"Garrick Gaieties,\" which\nwas a revue, a musical revue. How did he write the song? Mr. FURIA: Well,\nJohnny Mercer was a lyricist who, like most lyricists, wrote lyrics after\nmusic was completed. And he had a collaborator who had given him a melody.\nAnd he worked and worked and worked on it. And actually his ambition was to\nbe an actor. He really went to New York from Savannah wanting to make it as\nan actor. And it was a bug that never let go of him. And he went to the\n\"Garrick Gaieties\" and tried to get a role. And they said, `No, we don't\nneed any more actors, all we need are pretty girls and songs.' So he went\nback to this melody that his collaborator had given him and worked and\nworked and wrote many, many verses to it, and took it over to the show. And\nthey loved it. And it actually was featured very prominently in \"Garrick\nGaieties.\" GROSS: Had he not thought about writing lyrics before this? Mr.\nFURIA: No, he had been doing that ever since he was about 15. He had been\nwriting lyrics. And his usual style--because he loved what were then called\nrace records, blues that were largely marketed to black audiences. And he\nloved Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey and Louis Armstrong. And he wrote a lot of\nvery, very vernacular, bluesy kinds of lyrics. But \"Out of Breath\" was his\nfirst song for a Broadway revue. And it has a kind of New York\nsophistication to it. He could be that urbane New Yorker when he wanted to\nbe. GROSS: Well, let's hear Johnny Mercer singing \"Out of Breath.\" And this\nwas recorded in 1971, when he appeared at the Lyrics and Lyricists series at\nthe 92nd Street Y in New York. Here's Johnny Mercer. (Soundbite of \"Out of\nBreath\") Mr. JOHNNY MERCER (Lyricist): (Singing) Mine's a hopeless case, but\nthere's one saving grace. Anyone would feel as I do, out of breath and\nscared to death of you. Love was first divined, then explored and defined.\nStill, the old sensation is new. Out of breath and scared to death of you.\nIt takes all the strength that I can call to my command to hold your hand. I\nwould speak in length about the love that should be made, but I'm afraid.\nHercules and such never bothered me much. All you have to do is say boo. I'm\nout of breath and scared to death of you. (Soundbite of applause) GROSS:\nThat's Johnny Mercer singing the first song, the first lyric that he wrote\nthat actually got performed in a show. And that was recorded in 1971. My\nguest is Philip Furia, who has written a new biography of Johnny Mercer.\nIt's called \"Skylark.\" Well, \"Garrick Gaieties\" not only gave a life to\nMercer's song \"Out of Breath,\" Mercer met his wife Ginger at the \"Garrick\nGaieties,\" too. She was a dancer in the show. Mr. FURIA: Yeah, she was in\nthe chorus line. And he courted her. She was very, very different. She had\ngrown up in Brooklyn. She was Jewish and very much a city girl, but she was\nvery taken with this odd Southern boy whose language she could barely\nunderstand, who used to walk around in a Panama hat and a white suit. But\nthey married shortly thereafter--not a happy marriage, as it turned out. But\nthey were initially very much in love. And it came out of that first show.\nGROSS: Well, Johnny Mercer's song \"Out of Breath\" was performed in 1930 in\n\"Garrick Gaieties.\" What were the typical ways of breaking into music for a\nyoung songwriter at that time? Mr. FURIA: Well, for a young songwriter in\nNew York, the way you broke in was through Tin Pan Alley, which was where\nall the sheet music publishers had their offices and where so many songs\nwere kind of mass-produced, almost assembly-line-produced. And Johnny Mercer\nwalked the pavements. He want to various music publishers, trying to get\nthem to accept his songs. And, you know, he would see the greats--Jerome\nKern, Oscar Hammerstein--walking around. And, you know, he just envied the\nkind of success they had. But it really took a long time before--even though\nhe could place a song here and there in a Broadway revue, it took him three\nor four years before he really had a hit song. And it was a lot of\nfrustration. He talked about--you know, he and his wife lived in Brooklyn.\nAnd he had 25 cents a day to take the subway in and buy himself two hog dogs\nand an orange soda for lunch, and just kept knocking on those doors, trying\nto sell his songs. GROSS: What was that first hit? Mr. FURIA: The first hit\nwas a song he wrote with Hoagy Carmichael in 1933 called \"Lazy Bones.\" And\nthey sold the song to a publisher and they got a recording of it. And both\nof them at that time were so poor that the banks wouldn't cash their first\nroyalty checks for, like, $1,000, because these guys looked so seedy. So one\nof the singers who had recorded the song took it to her bank and got it\ncashed. But it was their first big break. Well, it was Mercer's first break;\nCarmichael had had a couple of successful songs before that. GROSS: And\nafter working with Hoagy Carmichael, Mercer went on to be the songwriter for\nthe Paul Whiteman Band. Hoagy Carmichael and Paul Whiteman had already\nworked together. Was it typical for big bands then to have a songwriter on\nstaff? Mr. FURIA: No, it was not typical. But Mercer was also a wonderful\nsinger. And he actually broke into Paul Whiteman's band by winning a\nnational singing contest. He was the New York champion. And then he won the\nnational contest. And Whiteman kept him on as a singer actually to replace\nBing Crosby. Crosby went to Hollywood, and Whiteman needed someone who could\nsing very rhythmical, jazzy tunes. And that was Mercer's talent. He had\ngrown up listening to the black records and, you know, black church music as\na kid. So he had a wonderful sense of rhythm and jazz. And he sang with\nWhiteman for several years. GROSS: My guest is Philip Furia, the author of\n\"Skylark: The Life and Times of Johnny Mercer.\" We'll talk more after a\nbreak. This is FRESH AIR. (Soundbite of music) GROSS: My guest, Philip\nFuria, is the author of a new biography of lyricist Johnny Mercer. It's\ncalled \"Skylark.\" Johnny Mercer wrote for Hollywood in two different parts\nof his life. How did he get started writing for Hollywood? And Hollywood was\nanother great way for a songwriter for become known and for his songs to\nbecome known. GROSS: Hollywood got interested in him when they heard him on\nthe radio singing with Paul Whiteman. And Mercer's singing voice on the\nradio came across as if he were black. In fact, Whiteman had teamed him with\nhis trombonist, a great jazz trombonist, Jack Teagarden. And they were a\nkind of Amos-and-Andy act. And everyone who listened thought these were two\nblacks who were, you know, talking dialogue back and forth and then breaking\ninto song. And RKO Studios had a producer who really loved that sound and\ninvited Mercer out to Hollywood to be an actor, a singer and a songwriter.\nIt was kind of like a triple threat. And Mercer still had that acting bug in\nhim. He wanted to make it, he wanted to be a movie star like Bing Crosby. He\nwas just astonished at the success Crosby had when he went out Hollywood.\nAnd Mercer thought, `This is going to happen to me.' And so he left a great\njob with Paul Whiteman's band, went out to Hollywood, actually made two\nmovies, and as an actor was a disaster; and wrote a few songs while he was\nout there, wrote a song with Fred Astaire called \"I'm Building Up to an\nAwful Letdown.\" But basically his first venture into Hollywood was a bust\nand they didn't renew his contract at RKO. And he was left high and dry.\nGROSS: And then a song that he wrote after leaving Hollywood ended up\nbecoming his ticket back into Hollywood. And that song was \"I'm an Old\nCowhand.\" Tell the story of the song and how it changed his life. Mr. FURIA:\nWell, after RKO canceled his contract, he realized how tough it was to make\nit in Hollywood. And as he did so often in his life, he wanted to get back\nhome to Savannah, get back to his roots. And so he and his wife--and this is\nin, you know, 1936, got in a car and drove from Hollywood to Savannah.\nThey'd never done that before and they never did it again. It took them\nthree days to drive across Texas. And as he was driving across Texas, he was\nastounded at seeing these cowboys in big hats and with spurs on, and they\nwere driving cars and trucks. And I think, you know, after his bad\nexperience in Hollywood, he kind of saw how ridiculous the image Hollywood\nportrayed of the Western cowboy was. And here was, in fact, in Texas, life\nimitating art. So the song came to him as they were driving. `I'm an old\ncowhand from the Rio Grande and I ride the range in my Ford V-8.' So it was\na kind of, you know, send-up of the Hollywood that he had come to really\ndespise and also, you know, just a very amusing look at the way these Texas\ncowboys were trying to look like the ones in the movies. GROSS: Mercer went\nto Hollywood hoping to have the kind of success he saw Bing Crosby have, and\nBing Crosby was the one who actually recorded \"I'm an Old Cowhand,\" turned\nit into... Mr. FURIA: Right. GROSS: ...a hit and a well-known song. How did\nBing Crosby end up recording it? Mr. FURIA: Well, Crosby and Mercer were\nfriends actually through their wives. Johnny's wife, Ginger, had been a\nchorus girl and she had made friends with another chorus girl, Dixie Lee,\nwho went on to marry Bing Crosby; and also Dolores Hope, who married Bob\nHope. So the three women were lifelong friends. And, as often happens, when\nthe women are friends, the wives are friends, the husbands become friends,\ntoo, so that Crosby kind of looked out for Johnny Mercer and helped him\nalong, particularly during those kind of bleak early years in Hollywood in\nthe 1930s. He recorded songs with him or he would sing songs either on\nrecordings or in movies that Johnny Mercer had written. So, in some ways, he\nwas kind of a mentor for Johnny Mercer. GROSS: So Bing Crosby sang the song\nin the movie \"Rhythm on the Range.\" And here's Bing Crosby 1936 recording of\n\"I'm an Old Cowhand\" with a lyric by Johnny Mercer. (Soundbite of \"I'm an\nOld Cowhand\") Mr. BING CROSBY (Singer/Actor): (Singing) I'm an old cowhand\nfrom the Rio Grande. But my legs ain't bowed and my cheeks ain't tan. I'm a\ncowboy who never saw a cow, never roped a steer 'cause I don't know how,\nsure ain't a-fixin' to start it now. Oh, yippee-i-o-ki-ay, yippee-i-o-ki-ay.\nI'm an old cowhand and I come down from the Rio Grande. And I learned to\nride, ride, ride before I learned to stand. I'm a riding fool who is up to\ndate, I know every trail in the Lone Star State 'cause I ride the range in a\nFord V-8. Oh, yippee-i-o-ki-ay. Yip, yip, yip.\nDah-dah-dah-dah-dee-dah-dah-dah, dee-dee-dee-dah. GROSS: That's \"I'm an Old\nCowhand\" recorded in 1936 by Bing Crosby. My guest, Philip Furia, is the\nauthor of a biography of Johnny Mercer, who wrote that song. This is one of\nthe few songs where Johnny Mercer wrote music and lyrics? Mr. FURIA: Well,\nhe wrote several where he actually did music, too, even though he could not\nread music and couldn't play a musical instrument. But it was very much like\nIrving Berlin. He would hear not only a melody but harmonies in his head.\nAnd then he would go to a piano player and sing the song. And then the piano\nplayer would pick it out. And then Mercer would work with him, playing the\nchords. And it was really extraordinary. I interviewed his former\nson-in-law, who was a pianist, who had written some songs with him like\nthat. And he said it took forever, but he knew exactly the chords he wanted.\nHe could hear them in his head. GROSS: Now when he was in Hollywood, Johnny\nMercer fell in love with Judy Garland. They had an affair. How long did that\naffair last? Mr. FURIA: It started in 1941, and it was an on-and-off-again\naffair that lasted really until Judy Garland died. It was the most\nextraordinary thing I learned about him in researching the book, that Judy\nGarland really was the great, great love of his life. And although Garland\nbiographers don't make a lot of the affair, I think really it was a very\nimportant affair for her. She was about to get married to her first husband.\nAnd she really wanted an older man. And she was very interested in men with\nliterary and artistic qualities to them. And I think she fell deeply in love\nwith Johnny Mercer. But he was married and had just adopted a little girl,\nAmanda. And he wrote a song about her called \"Mandy Is Two.\" And he was just\nnuts about his daughter. And he had this Southern genteel principle that he\ndid not believe in divorce. And Judy Garland had just finally gotten some\nsuccess in \"The Wizard of Oz\" and realized, I think, that if word had gotten\nout that she was an having an affair with an older married man, that her\ncareer after waiting so long to take off would have been in jeopardy. And\nshe actually broke it off. And Mercer never got over it. And they renewed it\nseveral times until her death. And at another point in the 1960s, he\nactually asked Ginger for a divorce so that he could finally marry Judy\nGarland. And his kids were grown by then and he was ready to walk out of the\nmarriage. But, again, it didn't take off. His wife became deathly ill.\nDoctors told him that she was going to die very soon. And he went into see\nher in the hospital, and she said, `Please don't divorce me now.' And he\nsaid, `I'll stay with you as long as you live.' And she recovered and lived\nfor another 30 years. GROSS: Oh. Mr. FURIA: And in the meantime, Garland\nkept going downhill and downhill and downhill and, you know, finally died, I\nthink, in 1969. GROSS: Philip Furia's new biography of Johnny Mercer is\ncalled \"Skylark.\" We'll talk more about Mercer and hear more of his songs in\nthe second half of the show. I'm Terry Gross and this is FRESH AIR. Here's\none of the great collaborations between Johnny Mercer and Harold Arlen, sung\nby Ella Fitzgerald. (Soundbite of song) Ms. ELLA FITZGERALD (Singer): My\nmama done told me when I was in pigtails, my mama done told me, `Hon, a\nman's gonna sweet-talk and give you the big eye, but when that\nsweet-talking's done, a man is a two-face, a worrisome thing who'll leave\nyou to sing the blues in the night.' Now the rains are falling, hear the\ntrains a calling hoo-hoo-oowee. My mama done told me, `Hear that lonesome\nwhistle blow across the trestle, hoo-hoo-oowee.' My mama done told me,\n`Ah-hoo-we-ah-hoo-we, oh, clickety-clack sent echoing back the blues in the\nnight. The evening breeze will start the trees to crying and the moon will\nhide its light.' (Announcements) GROSS: Coming up, more about the life and\nwork of Johnny Mercer. We continue our conversation with biographer Philip\nFuria. In addition to writing some of the most popular songs of the 20th\ncentury, Mercer was also a co-founder of Capitol Records. (Soundbite of\nmusic) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross, back with Philip Furia,\nthe author of a new biography of lyricist Johnny Mercer called \"Skylark.\"\nMercer's songs include \"Skylark,\" \"Moon River,\" \"The Days of Wine and\nRoses,\" \"Come Rain or Come Shine,\" \"Any Place I Hang My Hat is Home,\" \"I\nThought About You,\" \"The Man That Got Away,\" and \"Hooray for Hollywood.\"\nWhen we left off, Furia was talking about Johnny Mercer's secret affair with\nJudy Garland. He told me that even many Hollywood insiders didn't know about\nthe affair. Mr. FURIA: It was not well-known. In fact, in one Garland\nbiography, there was an interview with Mickey Rooney, who said, `In 1941,\nJudy Garland had finally found the man she loved,' and Rooney didn't know\nwho it was. So it was kept pretty secret; it was just a few people in the\nfamily who knew about it. But they said Johnny was just gaga over her. You\ncouldn't even talk to him. He'd just be staring straight forward and, you\nknow, you'd kind of have to snap your fingers in front of his face. But the\nfact that it happened in 1941 and was so heart-rending for him, it was one\nof those great lucky breaks that he was, at that time, starting to\ncollaborate with Harold Arlen. And suddenly, in Mercer's lyrics--you know,\nbefore that, he had written \"Jeepers Creepers\" and \"I'm an Old Cowhand\" and\n\"You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby,\" but suddenly, there comes this\nwrenching, agonizing pain into his lyrics, and he writes \"Blues in the\nNight,\" \"One for My Baby.\" You know, there's a whole new depth of emotion,\nand I'm sure it comes out of the affair with Garland. Also, a new kind of\nsensuality in things like \"That Old Black Magic,\" which is a song he wrote\nfor her. So, you know, in a way, Judy Garland, although the love affair\ndidn't work out, she kind of became his muse. And in a way, Judy Garland did\nthat to Johnny Mercer. GROSS: Why don't we hear one of the songs that Mercer\nwrote with Arlen in this period. Why don't we listen to \"One For My Baby.\"\nAnd although this is such a deeply felt song and such a kind of\nheart-breaking song, it was written for the movie \"The Sky's the Limit,\" and\noriginally sung by Fred Astaire, who gives it a much jauntier rendition...\nMr. FURIA: Yes. GROSS: ...than what we're used to hearing from Sinatra. Mr.\nFURIA: Yeah. Sinatra's rendition, I think, is the classic one, and he\ncaptures all the pain. He once said, `A Johnny Mercer lyric is all the wit\nyou wish you had and all the love you ever lost.' And boy, he hit it with\n\"One For My Baby.\" GROSS: Well, here's Frank Sinatra. (Soundbite of \"One For\nMy Baby\") Mr. FRANK SINATRA: (Singing) It's quarter to 3. There's no one in\nthe place except you and me. So set 'em up, Joe. I got a little story you\nought to know. We're drinking, my friend, to the end of a brief episode.\nMake it one for my baby, and one more for the road. I got the routine. Put\nanother nickel in the machine. Feelin' so bad. Can't you make the music easy\nand sad? I could tell you a lot, but you've got to be true to your code.\nMake it one for my baby, and one more for the road. You'd never know it,\nbut, buddy, I'm a kind of poet, and I got a lot of things I'd like to say.\nAnd when I'm gloomy, won't you listen to me till it's tucked away? Well,\nthat's how it goes. And, Joe, I know you're gettin' anxious to close. And\nthanks for the cheer. I hope you didn't mind my bending your ear. But this\ntorch that I've found gotta be drowned, or it soon might explode. So make it\none for my baby, and one more for the road, the long, that long--it's long.\nGROSS: And that's Frank Sinatra singing \"One For My Baby,\" music by Harold\nArlen, lyric by Johnny Mercer. And Johnny Mercer is the subject of a new\nbiography called \"Skylark\" written by my guest Philip Furia. So you think\nthat that song was inspired in part by Johnny Mercer's affair with Judy\nGarland, which was broken off by the time this song was written. Did they\never work together? Mr. FURIA: Well, yeah. He wrote one of his biggest\nhits--he wrote for Judy Garland in the movie \"The Harvey Girls,\" \"On the\nAtchison, Topeka & the Santa Fe.\" GROSS: Oh, of course. That's right.\nMr. FURIA: And he wrote a song for her when she had her television show. He\nnever appeared on it, but she once had her two children--oh, actually all\nthree children--Liza and Joey and Lorna Luft were on. They were just little\nkids at the time. And for Liza Minnelli, she sang \"Liza.\" For Joey, she sang\n\"Happiness is a Thing Called Joe.\" But then she said, `There's never been a\nsong written about Lorna.' But she said, `My friend, Johnny Mercer, wrote\none just for my daughter for me to do on this show,' so they were in touch\nin that period. And Mercer just wrote a song for her daughter. It was a very\ntouching moment in the show when she brings Lorna up and then talks about\nJohnny Mercer, and then sings this song. GROSS: We'll talk more about Johnny\nMercer with his biographer Philip Furia after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n(Soundbite of music) GROSS: My guest, Philip Furia, is the author of a new\nbiography of lyricist Johnny Mercer. It's called \"Skylark.\" So Johnny Mercer\nfinally did have his success in Hollywood, but then what he really wanted\nwas a hit Broadway show. Mr. FURIA: Oh, it just killed him that other\nHollywood songwriters that he was senior to, like Frank Loesser and Alan J.\nLerner, they went out to Broadway, and they had these smash hits like \"Guys\nand Dolls\" and \"My Fair Lady.\" And Mercer could see that those shows would\nbe immortal. They would be revived over and over again. He always wanted\nthat, and he never got it. He had successful shows like \"Lil' Abner,\" but no\none's ever revived it. And it was just--as one friend said, `one of the big\nholes in his heart was his inability to write a great Broadway musical.'\nGROSS: Now with Harold Arlen, he did write the songs for the show \"St. Louis\nWoman.\" Mr. FURIA: Right. GROSS: And that had a song that became a really\nbig hit for him, \"Come Rain or Come Shine.\" That had \"I Had Myself a True\nLove,\" which was another well-known song. And \"Riding on the Moon,\" a great\nsong that isn't as well-known, but some people still do it. How successful\nwas the show? Mr. FURIA: The show was a flop. It was supposed to have\nstarred Lena Horne, and that's why Mercer agreed to do it, because he had\ndoubts about the book, the script for the show. It was written by two black\nwriters, Arna Bontemps and Countee Cullen. And it's just a real clunker of a\nstory. And Lena Horne was approached by the NAACP, and they pressured her\nnot to do it, because even though the show was written by blacks, it had\nsome pretty awful racial stereotypes and a lot of--and a phony black\ndialect. And Lena Horne pulled out of the show. And for Mercer, that was the\nend, even though they had a wonderful new actress named Pearl Bailey who had\nthe secondary role. But without a big-name star like Lena Horne and with\nthat clunker of a book, that great, great score, that Arlen-Mercer score,\nwas pretty much lost except for the big hit, \"Come Rain or Come Shine,\"\nwhich they recorded when the show opened. I think Margaret Whiting did the\nrecording of that. And that was the only thing he could salvage. GROSS:\nWell, why don't we play a version of \"Come Rain or Come Shine?\" Why don't we\nhear the Ray Charles version of it? Mr. FURIA: OK. (Soundbite of \"Come Rain\nor Come Shine\") Mr. RAY CHARLES: (Singing) I'm gonna love you like no one's\nloved you, come rain or come shine. High as a mountain. Deep as a river.\nCome rain or come shine. I guess when you met me, it was just one of those\nthings. But don't ever bet me, 'cause I'm gonna be true, well, if you let\nme. You're going to love me like no one's loved me, come rain or come shine.\nHappy together, unhappy together, and wouldn't it be fine? Days may be\ncloudy or sunny, yeah. We're in or we're out of the money. Yeah, but I'm\nwith you always. I'm with you rain or shine. GROSS: That's Ray Charles\nsinging \"Come Rain or Come Shine,\" which was written by Harold Arlen and\nlyricist Johnny Mercer for the show \"St. Louis Woman.\" And my guest Philip\nFuria is the author of a biography of Johnny Mercer. How did Johnny Mercer\nreact to the musical changes of the 1950s, when rock 'n' roll was the music\nfor young people, and it was crowding out American popular song from the\ncharts, it was competing with it? Mr. FURIA: Well, Johnny Mercer, like so\nmany of the other great, great songwriters of his era, really resented the\ncoming of rock 'n' roll, where, you know, performers were writing their own\nsongs and, you know, there was just a complete fall-off in the quality of\nsongs. Songs were being aimed at the teen-age market. And you know, Ira\nGershwin, Irving Berlin, those people could complain about it, but they'd\nhad their careers. The sad thing about Mercer is that he was in his 40s, at\nthe top of his form, and American popular music was moving away from him.\nAnd it was agonizing for him. And Hollywood musicals were starting to\ncollapse because of the influx of television. They were shutting down movie\nproduction, and musicals were the most expensive kind of movies to make.\nThere was less and less work for him writing scores for movies. So it was\nreally a bitter, bitter time for him, the 1950s. GROSS: So here he was. Here\nwas Mercer feeling very embattled because of the growing popularity of rock\n'n' roll, and movies, again, saved him. Mr. FURIA: Yeah. They weren't making\nmany original movie musicals anymore. They were pretty much just doing movie\nversions of shows that had been hits on Broadway, but they still had what\nwere called theme songs. A dramatic movie, not a musical, might have a song\nattached to it, and that's what finally saved Mercer in the 1960s. He teamed\nwith Henry Mancini. And there was a movie, \"Breakfast at Tiffany's,\" and\nJohnny Mercer had to go ask Mancini. I mean, this was as far down as he was\non his luck. He asked this young composer if he could please, please work\nwith him and try to write a song to Mancini's melody for \"Breakfast at\nTiffany's.\" And Mancini was thrilled to collaborate with Johnny Mercer. And\nMercer, as often he did with collaborators, he would get the music in his\nhead, and then he wanted to be by himself. He didn't like to be in the same\nroom with a collaborator. And he would come back sometimes with two or three\ndifferent lyrics, and say to the composer, `Which one do you like?' And the\none he actually wrote for \"Breakfast at Tiffany's,\"--the first one he wrote\nwas called \"I'm Holly.\" (Singing) I'm Holly, like I wanna be, like holly on\na tree back home. And Mancini said, `Well, OK. That fits the main character\nof the movie, Holly Golightly, but what else do you have?' And he said,\n`Well, I've got this one that could either be called \"Red River,\" \"Blue\nRiver\" or \"Moon River.\"' And Mancini listened to it and just heard those\nfirst three notes, (singing) Moon River, and just knew at the time he was\ngoing to win the Academy Award, just that wonderful opening. And suddenly,\nMercer was back. He won the Academy Award. Andy Williams made a hit record\nof it. And then the next year, he and Mancini won it again with \"Days of\nWine and Roses.\" And it was a thrill. I mean, it was just one song a year,\nbut he was on talk shows, and people knew his name again, so it was a kind\nof wonderful comeback for him in the 1960s. GROSS: Getting back to \"Moon\nRiver\" for a second, you know, one of the phrases in that that always\nmystified me was `my huckleberry friend.' And you say that Margaret Whiting,\nwho was a good friend of his, suggested that he take that phrase out 'cause\nit made no sense to her. Mr. FURIA: It made no sense to her, and he really\nrespected her opinion. She was the daughter of one of his first great\ncollaborators, Richard Whiting, so he always felt like a father to her. And\nhe thought about it for a day, and he said, `No, I'm going to keep that in.'\nBut you know, it's a song written at one of the worst points in his life,\nbut it took him back to that place that I think he was always trying to get\nto, the place where he grew up, on Moon River, outside of Savannah. And it's\nso filled with the images of the river, you know, the marshland. And one of\nthe things they did in the summers, they would go huckleberrying. They would\ngo out and get huckleberries and then make ice cream out of it. And it's\njust a kind of childhood memory that came to him, as I say, at this bleak\npoint in his career, that went into the lyric. But when you hear it, you\nrealize it's a huckleberry friend, but it conjures up Huckleberry Finn and\nTom Sawyer on the Mississippi, that whole sense of boyhood ambition and, you\nknow, the wonder of childhood and yet going out to see the world. And it's\nbecome as Irving Berlin predicted. It's become a kind of folk song. GROSS:\nMy guest is Philip Furia, the author of \"Skylark: The Life and Times of\nJohnny Mercer.\" Here's \"Moon River\" as sung by Audrey Hepburn in the film\n\"Breakfast at Tiffany's.\" (Soundbite of \"Moon River\" from \"Breakfast at\nTiffany's\") Ms. AUDREY HEPBURN: (Singing) Moon River, wider than a mile, I'm\ncrossing you in style someday. Oh, dream maker, you heartbreaker, wherever\nyou're goin', I'm goin' your way. Two drifters off to see the world. There's\nsuch a lot of world to see. We're after the same rainbow's end waitin'\n'round the bend, my huckleberry friend, Moon River and me. GROSS: We'll talk\nmore about lyricist Johnny Mercer after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n(Soundbite of music) GROSS: My guest, Philip Furia, is the author of a new\nbiography of lyricist Johnny Mercer. It's called \"Skylark.\" Now Johnny\nMercer had a kind of business life as well in the sense that he was one of\nthe co-founders of Capitol Records. How did he end up co-founding that? Mr.\nFURIA: Well, he met a businessman who ran a record store in Los Angeles\nnamed Glenn Wallichs. And they were just talking, and they realized that all\nthe big record companies at the time--this was in the 1940s--were all based\nin New York: RCA Victor, Columbia and Decca. And they said, `You know, well,\nHollywood has brought so many talented singers to the West Coast; why\nshouldn't there be a record company here on the West Coast?' And so they\nagreed to start what Mercer just wanted to be a little company that put out\na few songs. And Wallichs was a great businessman, and he really turned the\nbusiness side of it into an enormous enterprise. And Mercer functioned--he\nwasn't much of a businessman, but he was a great what they call an AR man,\nartists and repertoire. Mercer was the president of Capitol Records, and he\nwas the one who decided which performers would sing what songs, and he was\njust brilliant at that. And he discovered all sorts of wonderful singers\nlike Jo Stafford, Margaret Whiting, Peggy Lee. And it was Johnny Mercer who\nwent to Nat \"King\" Cole, who at that time had a jazz trio, and persuaded Nat\n\"King\" Cole to sing as well as play the piano. And Cole didn't want to do\nit, but Mercer kept pressuring and pressuring, and finally got Nat \"King\"\nCole to do some recordings for Capitol, and Nat \"King\" Cole went on to\nbecome, really, the biggest singer in America until Frank Sinatra's career\nreblossomed in the '50s. And this was all Johnny Mercer's ear for talent,\nand his ear for really good songs that made Capitol an artistic success as\nwell as a business success. GROSS: Boy, he did a lot of good on that end,\ndidn't he? Mr. FURIA: Oh, well, it paid off, too. He gradually, because he\nwas such a terrible businessman--he'd come in at 11:00 in the morning, look\nat a couple of letters, and then he'd just want to go record songs with\nsomebody and then go out for a drink. And he kind of got shoved to the wings\nat Capitol Records in the 1950s, when it really became an enormous business\nsuccess. But it was bought out in 1955 by a European company, EMI. And\nMercer sold his interest in it, and I think it came to almost $2 million. He\nbecame a millionaire by selling Capitol Records. GROSS: What was it like to\nresearch this book and to talk to people who were alive now and knew or\nworked with Johnny Mercer? Mr. FURIA: It was surprisingly difficult for me,\nbecause I had known a little bit about how he behaved when he drank. But so\nmany people--and these--people who absolutely adored him told me these\nhorrible, horrible stories about him, that at cocktail parties, he would\ncurse at his wife and, sometimes, would take his drink and pour it over her\nhead at a party, that he would make sexual overtures to daughters of his\ncollaborators, even to one of his own nieces, who told me this. And she was\njust revolted. I mean, she thought, `I'd always been like a daughter to him.\nI was the same age as his daughter, and he got drunk and made a pass at me.'\nAnd I found that very difficult to write about. And the sad thing is that he\nwould attack everybody around him. And then, unlike some drunks who forget\nthe next morning, he would always remember. And the Southern proper\nupbringing would come back, and he would feel terrible remorse, and would\ninevitably send a dozen roses to whomever he'd offended the next morning,\nwith these abject note of apologies. So, yeah, it was, in some ways, a\nhorrible life, that he would be so abominable when he drank and then feel so\nguilty the next morning. And it was just, like, there was a while there I\ncouldn't write about him. I found him so repulsive a person when he drank.\nSo, you know, I'd written about Irving Berlin, who could be crusty, and Ira\nGershwin, who was just a sweetheart. But now Johnny Mercer, there was a\ndarkness to him and an ugliness to him that I didn't want to write about\nhim. GROSS: So you're in that position that we are with a lot of our\nartists, unfortunately, which is learning how to keep loving the art while\nfeeling uncomfortable about the artist. Mr. FURIA: Yeah, I'd never been in\nthat position before. But finally, after interviewing more people--and the\ninterviews would get very, very emotional sometimes as people talked about\nhow much they loved him, but then would recount these grisly stories about\nhim. And finally, I began to see how tormented he was. And it was a torment\nthat went all the way back to his childhood and the kinds of tremendous\nexpectations that his family made on him to make everything right, to always\nbe the kindest, most generous person, to fix everything that went wrong in\nthe family. And I just felt that this enormous pressure that when he drank,\nhe could be bad. He could get out from under that. And I began to feel a\nkind of sympathy for him that just built and built, and then I could write.\nGROSS: Well, Philip Furia, thank you so much for talking with us about\nJohnny Mercer. Mr. FURIA: It's been a pleasure. Thank you, Terry. GROSS:\nPhilip Furia's new biography of Johnny Mercer is called \"Skylark.\" (Credits)\nGROSS: I'm Terry Gross.

I'm Terry Gross. Johnny Mercer wrote the lyrics to many great songs. Here's a short list: \"Any Place I Hang My Hat is Home,\" \"Blues in the Night,\" \"Come Rain or Come Shine,\" \"Days of Wine and Roses,\" \"Fools Rush In,\" \"Hooray for Hollywood,\" \"I Remember You,\" \"I Wanna Be Around,\" \"Jeepers Creepers,\" \"The Man That Got Away,\" \"Moon River,\" \"One for My Baby,\" \"Something's Gotta Give,\" \"That Old Black Magic\" and \"You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby.\" Mercer's period of greatest popularity was between the mid-1930s and mid-'50s. There were 221 weeks within that period when Mercer had at least one song in the top 10. My guest Philip Furia has written a new biography of Mercer called \"Skylark.\" Furia is also the author of \"The Poets of Tin Pan Alley\" and books about Irving Berlin and Ira Gershwin. As part of his research for \"Skylark,\" Furia interviewed many of Mercer's surviving family, friends and colleagues. Many of them shared stories about Mercer's appalling behavior when he was drunk. Yet, Furia says, the love everyone had for him seemed to override their worst memories. Mercer was born in Savannah, Georgia, in 1909 and died in 1976. Let's start with the Mercer lyric that the new biography is named after. The music was written by Hoagy Carmichael, who sings on this 1956 recording. (Soundbite of \"Skylark\") Mr. HOAGY CARMICHAEL (Singer): (Singing) Skylark, have you anything to say to me? Won't you tell me where my love can be? Is there a meadow in the mist where someone's waiting to be kissed? Skylark, have you seen a valley green with spring where my heart can go a-journeying over the shadows and the rain to a blossom-covered lane? And in your lonely flight haven't you heard the music of the night, wonderful music, faint as the will-o'-the-wisp, crazy as a loon, sad as a Gypsy serenading the moon? Skylark, I don't know if you can find these things, but my heart is riding on your wings. So if you see them anywhere, won't you lead me there? GROSS: Philip Furia, welcome back to FRESH AIR. Mr. PHILIP FURIA (Author, \"Skylark\"): Oh, thank you so much. GROSS: You say that Johnny Mercer is different from the other members of the pantheon of American popular song who are his contemporaries, different because of his background. How does his background compare to, you know, the Gershwins and Harold Arlen and Cole Porter, Irving Berlin? Mr. FURIA: Yeah, that's what interested me initially about him, because Mercer was the only Southerner in that whole group of largely New York Jewish immigrant or descended from immigrants songwriters. The Gershwins, Berlin, even Cole Porter, who came from Indiana, can sound more New Yorkish, more urbane than anyone else. And here's Johnny Mercer from Savannah, an Episcopalian choirboy, mingling with all of these sophisticated, hard-nosed New York Jewish songwriters. And I thought, what a world for him to move in. There was a side of him that came out as I began to do research. He was very patrician. And I think he was put off a little bit by kind of, you know, the bluntness, the brusqueness of a lot of the other songwriters. He didn't have that energy and drive. GROSS: Let's get to Johnny Mercer's first lyric that actually had a life outside of his house. And that lyric is \"Out of Breath.\" And this is a song that he actually got into the \"Garrick Gaieties,\" which was a revue, a musical revue. How did he write the song? Mr. FURIA: Well, Johnny Mercer was a lyricist who, like most lyricists, wrote lyrics after music was completed. And he had a collaborator who had given him a melody. And he worked and worked and worked on it. And actually his ambition was to be an actor. He really went to New York from Savannah wanting to make it as an actor. And it was a bug that never let go of him. And he went to the \"Garrick Gaieties\" and tried to get a role. And they said, `No, we don't need any more actors, all we need are pretty girls and songs.' So he went back to this melody that his collaborator had given him and worked and worked and wrote many, many verses to it, and took it over to the show. And they loved it. And it actually was featured very prominently in \"Garrick Gaieties.\" GROSS: Had he not thought about writing lyrics before this? Mr. FURIA: No, he had been doing that ever since he was about 15. He had been writing lyrics. And his usual style--because he loved what were then called race records, blues that were largely marketed to black audiences. And he loved Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey and Louis Armstrong. And he wrote a lot of very, very vernacular, bluesy kinds of lyrics. But \"Out of Breath\" was his first song for a Broadway revue. And it has a kind of New York sophistication to it. He could be that urbane New Yorker when he wanted to be. GROSS: Well, let's hear Johnny Mercer singing \"Out of Breath.\" And this was recorded in 1971, when he appeared at the Lyrics and Lyricists series at the 92nd Street Y in New York. Here's Johnny Mercer. (Soundbite of \"Out of Breath\") Mr. JOHNNY MERCER (Lyricist): (Singing) Mine's a hopeless case, but there's one saving grace. Anyone would feel as I do, out of breath and scared to death of you. Love was first divined, then explored and defined. Still, the old sensation is new. Out of breath and scared to death of you. It takes all the strength that I can call to my command to hold your hand. I would speak in length about the love that should be made, but I'm afraid. Hercules and such never bothered me much. All you have to do is say boo. I'm out of breath and scared to death of you. (Soundbite of applause) GROSS: That's Johnny Mercer singing the first song, the first lyric that he wrote that actually got performed in a show. And that was recorded in 1971. My guest is Philip Furia, who has written a new biography of Johnny Mercer. It's called \"Skylark.\" Well, \"Garrick Gaieties\" not only gave a life to Mercer's song \"Out of Breath,\" Mercer met his wife Ginger at the \"Garrick Gaieties,\" too. She was a dancer in the show. Mr. FURIA: Yeah, she was in the chorus line. And he courted her. She was very, very different. She had grown up in Brooklyn. She was Jewish and very much a city girl, but she was very taken with this odd Southern boy whose language she could barely understand, who used to walk around in a Panama hat and a white suit. But they married shortly thereafter--not a happy marriage, as it turned out. But they were initially very much in love. And it came out of that first show. GROSS: Well, Johnny Mercer's song \"Out of Breath\" was performed in 1930 in \"Garrick Gaieties.\" What were the typical ways of breaking into music for a young songwriter at that time? Mr. FURIA: Well, for a young songwriter in New York, the way you broke in was through Tin Pan Alley, which was where all the sheet music publishers had their offices and where so many songs were kind of mass-produced, almost assembly-line-produced. And Johnny Mercer walked the pavements. He want to various music publishers, trying to get them to accept his songs. And, you know, he would see the greats--Jerome Kern, Oscar Hammerstein--walking around. And, you know, he just envied the kind of success they had. But it really took a long time before--even though he could place a song here and there in a Broadway revue, it took him three or four years before he really had a hit song. And it was a lot of frustration. He talked about--you know, he and his wife lived in Brooklyn. And he had 25 cents a day to take the subway in and buy himself two hog dogs and an orange soda for lunch, and just kept knocking on those doors, trying to sell his songs. GROSS: What was that first hit? Mr. FURIA: The first hit was a song he wrote with Hoagy Carmichael in 1933 called \"Lazy Bones.\" And they sold the song to a publisher and they got a recording of it. And both of them at that time were so poor that the banks wouldn't cash their first royalty checks for, like, $1,000, because these guys looked so seedy. So one of the singers who had recorded the song took it to her bank and got it cashed. But it was their first big break. Well, it was Mercer's first break; Carmichael had had a couple of successful songs before that. GROSS: And after working with Hoagy Carmichael, Mercer went on to be the songwriter for the Paul Whiteman Band. Hoagy Carmichael and Paul Whiteman had already worked together. Was it typical for big bands then to have a songwriter on staff? Mr. FURIA: No, it was not typical. But Mercer was also a wonderful singer. And he actually broke into Paul Whiteman's band by winning a national singing contest. He was the New York champion. And then he won the national contest. And Whiteman kept him on as a singer actually to replace Bing Crosby. Crosby went to Hollywood, and Whiteman needed someone who could sing very rhythmical, jazzy tunes. And that was Mercer's talent. He had grown up listening to the black records and, you know, black church music as a kid. So he had a wonderful sense of rhythm and jazz. And he sang with Whiteman for several years. GROSS: My guest is Philip Furia, the author of \"Skylark: The Life and Times of Johnny Mercer.\" We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (Soundbite of music) GROSS: My guest, Philip Furia, is the author of a new biography of lyricist Johnny Mercer. It's called \"Skylark.\" Johnny Mercer wrote for Hollywood in two different parts of his life. How did he get started writing for Hollywood? And Hollywood was another great way for a songwriter for become known and for his songs to become known. GROSS: Hollywood got interested in him when they heard him on the radio singing with Paul Whiteman. And Mercer's singing voice on the radio came across as if he were black. In fact, Whiteman had teamed him with his trombonist, a great jazz trombonist, Jack Teagarden. And they were a kind of Amos-and-Andy act. And everyone who listened thought these were two blacks who were, you know, talking dialogue back and forth and then breaking into song. And RKO Studios had a producer who really loved that sound and invited Mercer out to Hollywood to be an actor, a singer and a songwriter. It was kind of like a triple threat. And Mercer still had that acting bug in him. He wanted to make it, he wanted to be a movie star like Bing Crosby. He was just astonished at the success Crosby had when he went out Hollywood. And Mercer thought, `This is going to happen to me.' And so he left a great job with Paul Whiteman's band, went out to Hollywood, actually made two movies, and as an actor was a disaster; and wrote a few songs while he was out there, wrote a song with Fred Astaire called \"I'm Building Up to an Awful Letdown.\" But basically his first venture into Hollywood was a bust and they didn't renew his contract at RKO. And he was left high and dry. GROSS: And then a song that he wrote after leaving Hollywood ended up becoming his ticket back into Hollywood. And that song was \"I'm an Old Cowhand.\" Tell the story of the song and how it changed his life. Mr. FURIA: Well, after RKO canceled his contract, he realized how tough it was to make it in Hollywood. And as he did so often in his life, he wanted to get back home to Savannah, get back to his roots. And so he and his wife--and this is in, you know, 1936, got in a car and drove from Hollywood to Savannah. They'd never done that before and they never did it again. It took them three days to drive across Texas. And as he was driving across Texas, he was astounded at seeing these cowboys in big hats and with spurs on, and they were driving cars and trucks. And I think, you know, after his bad experience in Hollywood, he kind of saw how ridiculous the image Hollywood portrayed of the Western cowboy was. And here was, in fact, in Texas, life imitating art. So the song came to him as they were driving. `I'm an old cowhand from the Rio Grande and I ride the range in my Ford V-8.' So it was a kind of, you know, send-up of the Hollywood that he had come to really despise and also, you know, just a very amusing look at the way these Texas cowboys were trying to look like the ones in the movies. GROSS: Mercer went to Hollywood hoping to have the kind of success he saw Bing Crosby have, and Bing Crosby was the one who actually recorded \"I'm an Old Cowhand,\" turned it into... Mr. FURIA: Right. GROSS: ...a hit and a well-known song. How did Bing Crosby end up recording it? Mr. FURIA: Well, Crosby and Mercer were friends actually through their wives. Johnny's wife, Ginger, had been a chorus girl and she had made friends with another chorus girl, Dixie Lee, who went on to marry Bing Crosby; and also Dolores Hope, who married Bob Hope. So the three women were lifelong friends. And, as often happens, when the women are friends, the wives are friends, the husbands become friends, too, so that Crosby kind of looked out for Johnny Mercer and helped him along, particularly during those kind of bleak early years in Hollywood in the 1930s. He recorded songs with him or he would sing songs either on recordings or in movies that Johnny Mercer had written. So, in some ways, he was kind of a mentor for Johnny Mercer. GROSS: So Bing Crosby sang the song in the movie \"Rhythm on the Range.\" And here's Bing Crosby 1936 recording of \"I'm an Old Cowhand\" with a lyric by Johnny Mercer. (Soundbite of \"I'm an Old Cowhand\") Mr. BING CROSBY (Singer/Actor): (Singing) I'm an old cowhand from the Rio Grande. But my legs ain't bowed and my cheeks ain't tan. I'm a cowboy who never saw a cow, never roped a steer 'cause I don't know how, sure ain't a-fixin' to start it now. Oh, yippee-i-o-ki-ay, yippee-i-o-ki-ay. I'm an old cowhand and I come down from the Rio Grande. And I learned to ride, ride, ride before I learned to stand. I'm a riding fool who is up to date, I know every trail in the Lone Star State 'cause I ride the range in a Ford V-8. Oh, yippee-i-o-ki-ay. Yip, yip, yip. Dah-dah-dah-dah-dee-dah-dah-dah, dee-dee-dee-dah. GROSS: That's \"I'm an Old Cowhand\" recorded in 1936 by Bing Crosby. My guest, Philip Furia, is the author of a biography of Johnny Mercer, who wrote that song. This is one of the few songs where Johnny Mercer wrote music and lyrics? Mr. FURIA: Well, he wrote several where he actually did music, too, even though he could not read music and couldn't play a musical instrument. But it was very much like Irving Berlin. He would hear not only a melody but harmonies in his head. And then he would go to a piano player and sing the song. And then the piano player would pick it out. And then Mercer would work with him, playing the chords. And it was really extraordinary. I interviewed his former son-in-law, who was a pianist, who had written some songs with him like that. And he said it took forever, but he knew exactly the chords he wanted. He could hear them in his head. GROSS: Now when he was in Hollywood, Johnny Mercer fell in love with Judy Garland. They had an affair. How long did that affair last? Mr. FURIA: It started in 1941, and it was an on-and-off-again affair that lasted really until Judy Garland died. It was the most extraordinary thing I learned about him in researching the book, that Judy Garland really was the great, great love of his life. And although Garland biographers don't make a lot of the affair, I think really it was a very important affair for her. She was about to get married to her first husband. And she really wanted an older man. And she was very interested in men with literary and artistic qualities to them. And I think she fell deeply in love with Johnny Mercer. But he was married and had just adopted a little girl, Amanda. And he wrote a song about her called \"Mandy Is Two.\" And he was just nuts about his daughter. And he had this Southern genteel principle that he did not believe in divorce. And Judy Garland had just finally gotten some success in \"The Wizard of Oz\" and realized, I think, that if word had gotten out that she was an having an affair with an older married man, that her career after waiting so long to take off would have been in jeopardy. And she actually broke it off. And Mercer never got over it. And they renewed it several times until her death. And at another point in the 1960s, he actually asked Ginger for a divorce so that he could finally marry Judy Garland. And his kids were grown by then and he was ready to walk out of the marriage. But, again, it didn't take off. His wife became deathly ill. Doctors told him that she was going to die very soon. And he went into see her in the hospital, and she said, `Please don't divorce me now.' And he said, `I'll stay with you as long as you live.' And she recovered and lived for another 30 years. GROSS: Oh. Mr. FURIA: And in the meantime, Garland kept going downhill and downhill and downhill and, you know, finally died, I think, in 1969. GROSS: Philip Furia's new biography of Johnny Mercer is called \"Skylark.\" We'll talk more about Mercer and hear more of his songs in the second half of the show. I'm Terry Gross and this is FRESH AIR. Here's one of the great collaborations between Johnny Mercer and Harold Arlen, sung by Ella Fitzgerald. (Soundbite of song) Ms. ELLA FITZGERALD (Singer): My mama done told me when I was in pigtails, my mama done told me, `Hon, a man's gonna sweet-talk and give you the big eye, but when that sweet-talking's done, a man is a two-face, a worrisome thing who'll leave you to sing the blues in the night.' Now the rains are falling, hear the trains a calling hoo-hoo-oowee. My mama done told me, `Hear that lonesome whistle blow across the trestle, hoo-hoo-oowee.' My mama done told me, `Ah-hoo-we-ah-hoo-we, oh, clickety-clack sent echoing back the blues in the night. The evening breeze will start the trees to crying and the moon will hide its light.' (Announcements) GROSS: Coming up, more about the life and work of Johnny Mercer. We continue our conversation with biographer Philip Furia. In addition to writing some of the most popular songs of the 20th century, Mercer was also a co-founder of Capitol Records. (Soundbite of music) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross, back with Philip Furia, the author of a new biography of lyricist Johnny Mercer called \"Skylark.\" Mercer's songs include \"Skylark,\" \"Moon River,\" \"The Days of Wine and Roses,\" \"Come Rain or Come Shine,\" \"Any Place I Hang My Hat is Home,\" \"I Thought About You,\" \"The Man That Got Away,\" and \"Hooray for Hollywood.\" When we left off, Furia was talking about Johnny Mercer's secret affair with Judy Garland. He told me that even many Hollywood insiders didn't know about the affair. Mr. FURIA: It was not well-known. In fact, in one Garland biography, there was an interview with Mickey Rooney, who said, `In 1941, Judy Garland had finally found the man she loved,' and Rooney didn't know who it was. So it was kept pretty secret; it was just a few people in the family who knew about it. But they said Johnny was just gaga over her. You couldn't even talk to him. He'd just be staring straight forward and, you know, you'd kind of have to snap your fingers in front of his face. But the fact that it happened in 1941 and was so heart-rending for him, it was one of those great lucky breaks that he was, at that time, starting to collaborate with Harold Arlen. And suddenly, in Mercer's lyrics--you know, before that, he had written \"Jeepers Creepers\" and \"I'm an Old Cowhand\" and \"You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby,\" but suddenly, there comes this wrenching, agonizing pain into his lyrics, and he writes \"Blues in the Night,\" \"One for My Baby.\" You know, there's a whole new depth of emotion, and I'm sure it comes out of the affair with Garland. Also, a new kind of sensuality in things like \"That Old Black Magic,\" which is a song he wrote for her. So, you know, in a way, Judy Garland, although the love affair didn't work out, she kind of became his muse. And in a way, Judy Garland did that to Johnny Mercer. GROSS: Why don't we hear one of the songs that Mercer wrote with Arlen in this period. Why don't we listen to \"One For My Baby.\" And although this is such a deeply felt song and such a kind of heart-breaking song, it was written for the movie \"The Sky's the Limit,\" and originally sung by Fred Astaire, who gives it a much jauntier rendition... Mr. FURIA: Yes. GROSS: ...than what we're used to hearing from Sinatra. Mr. FURIA: Yeah. Sinatra's rendition, I think, is the classic one, and he captures all the pain. He once said, `A Johnny Mercer lyric is all the wit you wish you had and all the love you ever lost.' And boy, he hit it with \"One For My Baby.\" GROSS: Well, here's Frank Sinatra. (Soundbite of \"One For My Baby\") Mr. FRANK SINATRA: (Singing) It's quarter to 3. There's no one in the place except you and me. So set 'em up, Joe. I got a little story you ought to know. We're drinking, my friend, to the end of a brief episode. Make it one for my baby, and one more for the road. I got the routine. Put another nickel in the machine. Feelin' so bad. Can't you make the music easy and sad? I could tell you a lot, but you've got to be true to your code. Make it one for my baby, and one more for the road. You'd never know it, but, buddy, I'm a kind of poet, and I got a lot of things I'd like to say. And when I'm gloomy, won't you listen to me till it's tucked away? Well, that's how it goes. And, Joe, I know you're gettin' anxious to close. And thanks for the cheer. I hope you didn't mind my bending your ear. But this torch that I've found gotta be drowned, or it soon might explode. So make it one for my baby, and one more for the road, the long, that long--it's long. GROSS: And that's Frank Sinatra singing \"One For My Baby,\" music by Harold Arlen, lyric by Johnny Mercer. And Johnny Mercer is the subject of a new biography called \"Skylark\" written by my guest Philip Furia. So you think that that song was inspired in part by Johnny Mercer's affair with Judy Garland, which was broken off by the time this song was written. Did they ever work together? Mr. FURIA: Well, yeah. He wrote one of his biggest hits--he wrote for Judy Garland in the movie \"The Harvey Girls,\" \"On the Atchison, Topeka & the Santa Fe.\" GROSS: Oh, of course. That's right. Mr. FURIA: And he wrote a song for her when she had her television show. He never appeared on it, but she once had her two children--oh, actually all three children--Liza and Joey and Lorna Luft were on. They were just little kids at the time. And for Liza Minnelli, she sang \"Liza.\" For Joey, she sang \"Happiness is a Thing Called Joe.\" But then she said, `There's never been a song written about Lorna.' But she said, `My friend, Johnny Mercer, wrote one just for my daughter for me to do on this show,' so they were in touch in that period. And Mercer just wrote a song for her daughter. It was a very touching moment in the show when she brings Lorna up and then talks about Johnny Mercer, and then sings this song. GROSS: We'll talk more about Johnny Mercer with his biographer Philip Furia after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (Soundbite of music) GROSS: My guest, Philip Furia, is the author of a new biography of lyricist Johnny Mercer. It's called \"Skylark.\" So Johnny Mercer finally did have his success in Hollywood, but then what he really wanted was a hit Broadway show. Mr. FURIA: Oh, it just killed him that other Hollywood songwriters that he was senior to, like Frank Loesser and Alan J. Lerner, they went out to Broadway, and they had these smash hits like \"Guys and Dolls\" and \"My Fair Lady.\" And Mercer could see that those shows would be immortal. They would be revived over and over again. He always wanted that, and he never got it. He had successful shows like \"Lil' Abner,\" but no one's ever revived it. And it was just--as one friend said, `one of the big holes in his heart was his inability to write a great Broadway musical.' GROSS: Now with Harold Arlen, he did write the songs for the show \"St. Louis Woman.\" Mr. FURIA: Right. GROSS: And that had a song that became a really big hit for him, \"Come Rain or Come Shine.\" That had \"I Had Myself a True Love,\" which was another well-known song. And \"Riding on the Moon,\" a great song that isn't as well-known, but some people still do it. How successful was the show? Mr. FURIA: The show was a flop. It was supposed to have starred Lena Horne, and that's why Mercer agreed to do it, because he had doubts about the book, the script for the show. It was written by two black writers, Arna Bontemps and Countee Cullen. And it's just a real clunker of a story. And Lena Horne was approached by the NAACP, and they pressured her not to do it, because even though the show was written by blacks, it had some pretty awful racial stereotypes and a lot of--and a phony black dialect. And Lena Horne pulled out of the show. And for Mercer, that was the end, even though they had a wonderful new actress named Pearl Bailey who had the secondary role. But without a big-name star like Lena Horne and with that clunker of a book, that great, great score, that Arlen-Mercer score, was pretty much lost except for the big hit, \"Come Rain or Come Shine,\" which they recorded when the show opened. I think Margaret Whiting did the recording of that. And that was the only thing he could salvage. GROSS: Well, why don't we play a version of \"Come Rain or Come Shine?\" Why don't we hear the Ray Charles version of it? Mr. FURIA: OK. (Soundbite of \"Come Rain or Come Shine\") Mr. RAY CHARLES: (Singing) I'm gonna love you like no one's loved you, come rain or come shine. High as a mountain. Deep as a river. Come rain or come shine. I guess when you met me, it was just one of those things. But don't ever bet me, 'cause I'm gonna be true, well, if you let me. You're going to love me like no one's loved me, come rain or come shine. Happy together, unhappy together, and wouldn't it be fine? Days may be cloudy or sunny, yeah. We're in or we're out of the money. Yeah, but I'm with you always. I'm with you rain or shine. GROSS: That's Ray Charles singing \"Come Rain or Come Shine,\" which was written by Harold Arlen and lyricist Johnny Mercer for the show \"St. Louis Woman.\" And my guest Philip Furia is the author of a biography of Johnny Mercer. How did Johnny Mercer react to the musical changes of the 1950s, when rock 'n' roll was the music for young people, and it was crowding out American popular song from the charts, it was competing with it? Mr. FURIA: Well, Johnny Mercer, like so many of the other great, great songwriters of his era, really resented the coming of rock 'n' roll, where, you know, performers were writing their own songs and, you know, there was just a complete fall-off in the quality of songs. Songs were being aimed at the teen-age market. And you know, Ira Gershwin, Irving Berlin, those people could complain about it, but they'd had their careers. The sad thing about Mercer is that he was in his 40s, at the top of his form, and American popular music was moving away from him. And it was agonizing for him. And Hollywood musicals were starting to collapse because of the influx of television. They were shutting down movie production, and musicals were the most expensive kind of movies to make. There was less and less work for him writing scores for movies. So it was really a bitter, bitter time for him, the 1950s. GROSS: So here he was. Here was Mercer feeling very embattled because of the growing popularity of rock 'n' roll, and movies, again, saved him. Mr. FURIA: Yeah. They weren't making many original movie musicals anymore. They were pretty much just doing movie versions of shows that had been hits on Broadway, but they still had what were called theme songs. A dramatic movie, not a musical, might have a song attached to it, and that's what finally saved Mercer in the 1960s. He teamed with Henry Mancini. And there was a movie, \"Breakfast at Tiffany's,\" and Johnny Mercer had to go ask Mancini. I mean, this was as far down as he was on his luck. He asked this young composer if he could please, please work with him and try to write a song to Mancini's melody for \"Breakfast at Tiffany's.\" And Mancini was thrilled to collaborate with Johnny Mercer. And Mercer, as often he did with collaborators, he would get the music in his head, and then he wanted to be by himself. He didn't like to be in the same room with a collaborator. And he would come back sometimes with two or three different lyrics, and say to the composer, `Which one do you like?' And the one he actually wrote for \"Breakfast at Tiffany's,\"--the first one he wrote was called \"I'm Holly.\" (Singing) I'm Holly, like I wanna be, like holly on a tree back home. And Mancini said, `Well, OK. That fits the main character of the movie, Holly Golightly, but what else do you have?' And he said, `Well, I've got this one that could either be called \"Red River,\" \"Blue River\" or \"Moon River.\"' And Mancini listened to it and just heard those first three notes, (singing) Moon River, and just knew at the time he was going to win the Academy Award, just that wonderful opening. And suddenly, Mercer was back. He won the Academy Award. Andy Williams made a hit record of it. And then the next year, he and Mancini won it again with \"Days of Wine and Roses.\" And it was a thrill. I mean, it was just one song a year, but he was on talk shows, and people knew his name again, so it was a kind of wonderful comeback for him in the 1960s. GROSS: Getting back to \"Moon River\" for a second, you know, one of the phrases in that that always mystified me was `my huckleberry friend.' And you say that Margaret Whiting, who was a good friend of his, suggested that he take that phrase out 'cause it made no sense to her. Mr. FURIA: It made no sense to her, and he really respected her opinion. She was the daughter of one of his first great collaborators, Richard Whiting, so he always felt like a father to her. And he thought about it for a day, and he said, `No, I'm going to keep that in.' But you know, it's a song written at one of the worst points in his life, but it took him back to that place that I think he was always trying to get to, the place where he grew up, on Moon River, outside of Savannah. And it's so filled with the images of the river, you know, the marshland. And one of the things they did in the summers, they would go huckleberrying. They would go out and get huckleberries and then make ice cream out of it. And it's just a kind of childhood memory that came to him, as I say, at this bleak point in his career, that went into the lyric. But when you hear it, you realize it's a huckleberry friend, but it conjures up Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer on the Mississippi, that whole sense of boyhood ambition and, you know, the wonder of childhood and yet going out to see the world. And it's become as Irving Berlin predicted. It's become a kind of folk song. GROSS: My guest is Philip Furia, the author of \"Skylark: The Life and Times of Johnny Mercer.\" Here's \"Moon River\" as sung by Audrey Hepburn in the film \"Breakfast at Tiffany's.\" (Soundbite of \"Moon River\" from \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\") Ms. AUDREY HEPBURN: (Singing) Moon River, wider than a mile, I'm crossing you in style someday. Oh, dream maker, you heartbreaker, wherever you're goin', I'm goin' your way. Two drifters off to see the world. There's such a lot of world to see. We're after the same rainbow's end waitin' 'round the bend, my huckleberry friend, Moon River and me. GROSS: We'll talk more about lyricist Johnny Mercer after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (Soundbite of music) GROSS: My guest, Philip Furia, is the author of a new biography of lyricist Johnny Mercer. It's called \"Skylark.\" Now Johnny Mercer had a kind of business life as well in the sense that he was one of the co-founders of Capitol Records. How did he end up co-founding that? Mr. FURIA: Well, he met a businessman who ran a record store in Los Angeles named Glenn Wallichs. And they were just talking, and they realized that all the big record companies at the time--this was in the 1940s--were all based in New York: RCA Victor, Columbia and Decca. And they said, `You know, well, Hollywood has brought so many talented singers to the West Coast; why shouldn't there be a record company here on the West Coast?' And so they agreed to start what Mercer just wanted to be a little company that put out a few songs. And Wallichs was a great businessman, and he really turned the business side of it into an enormous enterprise. And Mercer functioned--he wasn't much of a businessman, but he was a great what they call an AR man, artists and repertoire. Mercer was the president of Capitol Records, and he was the one who decided which performers would sing what songs, and he was just brilliant at that. And he discovered all sorts of wonderful singers like Jo Stafford, Margaret Whiting, Peggy Lee. And it was Johnny Mercer who went to Nat \"King\" Cole, who at that time had a jazz trio, and persuaded Nat \"King\" Cole to sing as well as play the piano. And Cole didn't want to do it, but Mercer kept pressuring and pressuring, and finally got Nat \"King\" Cole to do some recordings for Capitol, and Nat \"King\" Cole went on to become, really, the biggest singer in America until Frank Sinatra's career reblossomed in the '50s. And this was all Johnny Mercer's ear for talent, and his ear for really good songs that made Capitol an artistic success as well as a business success. GROSS: Boy, he did a lot of good on that end, didn't he? Mr. FURIA: Oh, well, it paid off, too. He gradually, because he was such a terrible businessman--he'd come in at 11:00 in the morning, look at a couple of letters, and then he'd just want to go record songs with somebody and then go out for a drink. And he kind of got shoved to the wings at Capitol Records in the 1950s, when it really became an enormous business success. But it was bought out in 1955 by a European company, EMI. And Mercer sold his interest in it, and I think it came to almost $2 million. He became a millionaire by selling Capitol Records. GROSS: What was it like to research this book and to talk to people who were alive now and knew or worked with Johnny Mercer? Mr. FURIA: It was surprisingly difficult for me, because I had known a little bit about how he behaved when he drank. But so many people--and these--people who absolutely adored him told me these horrible, horrible stories about him, that at cocktail parties, he would curse at his wife and, sometimes, would take his drink and pour it over her head at a party, that he would make sexual overtures to daughters of his collaborators, even to one of his own nieces, who told me this. And she was just revolted. I mean, she thought, `I'd always been like a daughter to him. I was the same age as his daughter, and he got drunk and made a pass at me.' And I found that very difficult to write about. And the sad thing is that he would attack everybody around him. And then, unlike some drunks who forget the next morning, he would always remember. And the Southern proper upbringing would come back, and he would feel terrible remorse, and would inevitably send a dozen roses to whomever he'd offended the next morning, with these abject note of apologies. So, yeah, it was, in some ways, a horrible life, that he would be so abominable when he drank and then feel so guilty the next morning. And it was just, like, there was a while there I couldn't write about him. I found him so repulsive a person when he drank. So, you know, I'd written about Irving Berlin, who could be crusty, and Ira Gershwin, who was just a sweetheart. But now Johnny Mercer, there was a darkness to him and an ugliness to him that I didn't want to write about him. GROSS: So you're in that position that we are with a lot of our artists, unfortunately, which is learning how to keep loving the art while feeling uncomfortable about the artist. Mr. FURIA: Yeah, I'd never been in that position before. But finally, after interviewing more people--and the interviews would get very, very emotional sometimes as people talked about how much they loved him, but then would recount these grisly stories about him. And finally, I began to see how tormented he was. And it was a torment that went all the way back to his childhood and the kinds of tremendous expectations that his family made on him to make everything right, to always be the kindest, most generous person, to fix everything that went wrong in the family. And I just felt that this enormous pressure that when he drank, he could be bad. He could get out from under that. And I began to feel a kind of sympathy for him that just built and built, and then I could write. GROSS: Well, Philip Furia, thank you so much for talking with us about Johnny Mercer. Mr. FURIA: It's been a pleasure. Thank you, Terry. GROSS: Philip Furia's new biography of Johnny Mercer is called \"Skylark.\" (Credits) GROSS: I'm Terry Gross.
