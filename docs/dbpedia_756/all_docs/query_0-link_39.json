California law for nurses requires that every school make possible the award of credit to make it possible for a LVN to receive enough credit to sit for the RN-NCLEX examination in the state of California. The LVN 45-unit option was designed as a career ladder for California Licensed Vocational Nurses (LVN) wishing to become registered nurses. While most states do not recognize California’s LVN 30 or 45 Unit Options and will not issue RN licenses to these LVNs, the Board of Nursing (BRN) in California mandates that every California school make the option available to licensed vocational nurses (LVNs). The number of units (30 or 45) depends on quarter or semester options. AUHS is on a quarter unit system and therefore a 45 unit option is mandated by law.\n\nThe applicant must be a licensed vocational nurse in the state of California.\n\nCourse work will be evaluated to determine transfer status in clinical nursing classes.\n\nThe L.V.N. may elect to complete a 45-unit option to become eligible to sit for the State Board RN licensure exam, or NCLEX-RN. The LVN may be awarded credit for 17 units of lower division nursing following assessment of their transcripts.

These courses may be challenged by these students selecting these options. Any nurse considering the LVN 45-Unit Option is required to meet with the Dean/Director or the Asst. Dean/Asst. Director to discuss this option and constraints associated with this choice prior to beginning any course work at AUHS.\n\nSpecial Notes to LVNs Considering this Option: Completion of this course work does not fulfill all requirements for a baccalaureate degree in nursing and the student is NOTconsidered a graduate of the nursing program.

Often referred to as general intelligence, or cognitive ability is a term that is used to describe the level at which an individual learns, understands instructions, and solves problems. It provides quantitative insight into how easily individuals can be trained, how well they can adjust to, and solve, problems, and how well satisfied they are likely to be with the demands of the curriculum. Students achieve a score of 19 on a computer-based test (CBT) or 21 on a paper-based test to continue the application process at AUHS. The information is available at www.wonderlic.com.\n\nThe TEST of Essential Academic Skills (TEAS)\n\nThe Test of Essential Academic Skills version 5 (TEAS-V) is required of nursing applicants by the School of Nursing (SON) at AUHS as an entrance examination, which assess the applicant’s academic aptitude in reading, math, science, English and language usage skills. Those who show a strong aptitude in academics are more likely to succeed in completing their nursing school education. AUHS SON requires incoming nursing students to score 70% on the adjusted TEAS score to be considered for admission.\n\nMore information is available at www.atitesting.com.\n\nLanguage Requirement\n\nTest of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)\n\nA proficiency in English will be critical to success. AUHS requires foreign/international applicants, regardless of citizenship, who have not attended schools at the secondary level or above for at least three (3) years full-time where English is the principal language of instruction, to take and present a TOEFL score. The TOEFL scores submitted must not have been earned more than two (2) years prior to the desired enrollment date. As circumstances warrant, minimum TOEFL scores may be changed.\n\nBecause the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) is offered on a limited number of dates, it is important that prospective international applicants sign up to take the examination as soon as possible. Advising centers in the home country can provide information about dates, locations, and procedures for taking the test. When the applicants take the test, scores should be forwarded by the testing service to AUHS Admissions Department. AUHS School Code is 4262.\n\nThe minimum TOEFL score for admission to undergraduate programs is 213 on the CBT (Computer Based Test) or 80 on the IBT (Internet Based Test), with 24 on speaking section for undergraduate-level and graduate-level programs.\n\nForeign/International applicants who do not obtain the minimal score required on TOEFL must take an English as a Second Language Course (ESL) offered by other institution and submit the required documentation that ESL has been taken and satisfied prior to beginning a program within the University.\n\nThe University does offer an I-20 Student Visa, but does not offer ESL classes at this time."
