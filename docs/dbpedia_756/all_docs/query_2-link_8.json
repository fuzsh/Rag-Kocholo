        "text": "Introduction\n\nChildcare facilities, catering to children aged 0 to 6 years old, are often hotspots for clusters or outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis, hand, foot, and mouth disease, and influenza (1–3). During the COVID-19 pandemic, clusters of COVID-19 infections have occurred in childcare facilities (4). Disinfection is an important measure to cut off transmission, and hand hygiene is the most important, effective, and economical measure to prevent and control infection rates. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends environmental cleaning, disinfection, and hand hygiene for the prevention and control of infectious diseases (5). However, studies have revealed that the implementation of these measures has not been satisfactory. Additionally, the unqualified environment disinfection and hand hygiene among children and teachers have been identified as risk factors for enterovirus infection in childcare facilities (6).\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevention and control measures of infectious diseases, such as disinfection and hand hygiene, have been promoted by many countries. Although residents exhibited good knowledge and attitude toward these measures, the behavior status was not satisfied. Some studies indicated that factors such as gender, age, and education level influenced behavior, with good knowledge and attitude serving as prerequisites for proper behavior (7, 8). Caregivers and teachers serve as a critical barrier in safeguarding children's health, while simultaneously emphasizing the importance of their own self-protection, and also play an important role for children getting and implementing health measures (9, 10). However, limited studies have been conducted on knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) toward disinfection and hand hygiene among childcare facilities staff. Some studies on knowledge and its intervention have exhibited differences in the knowledge rate among childcare facilities staff in different areas, with significant increases observed in knowledge rates to a high level after training (11, 12). Hand hygiene behaviors among childcare facilities staff were related to their knowledge, perception, habits, and interactions with children (13). During the COVID-19 pandemic, a KAP study on the prevention and control of hand, foot, and mouth disease among childcare facilities staff, including several disinfection and hand hygiene measures, exhibited that the staff possessed a low level of knowledge, but their attitude was positive. While a few staff practiced at a high level (14), it is suggested that the characteristics of disinfection and hand hygiene KAP among childcare facilities staff differed from those of the general public probably.\n\nIn China, childcare facilities have been listed as important institutions for the prevention and control of COVID-19 by the government. These institutions are required to perform environmental cleaning, disinfection, and hand hygiene (15). However, there is a lack of systematic surveillance and studies on KAP of childcare facilities staff. Understanding the disinfection and hand hygiene KAP among childcare facilities staff and discussing the improving measures are important steps to enhance environmental disinfection and hand hygiene as well as prevention and control of infectious disease among childcare facilities staff. This study was conducted based on a survey project of the disinfection practices in childcare facilities in Anhui Province in September 2022. The study aimed to investigate the disinfection and hand hygiene KAP among childcare facilities staff in two cities and analyze the influencing factors. This study also identified the gaps mainly among the knowledge, attitude, and practice, but not the scores of every part of knowledge, attitude, and practice, or total score and the relationship of the three as usual, to provide a scientific basis for the implementation and evaluation of intervention activities at every link in the future.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe results of this study showed a significant correlation between the higher educational level of the childcare facilities staff and their higher score, which was consistent with the survey results of resident adults and children's parents (8, 18). This result suggests that staff with a higher degree of education may possess a better understanding and mastery of knowledge. The results of this study showed that the education level of the childcare facilities staff mainly consisted of junior college (41.0%) and university graduates (39.9%), which was consistent with the survey results in China (12, 19). However, this finding was inconsistent with the research in other countries, such as Singapore, where the education of the staff mainly consisted of secondary school and diploma courses (14, 20). Although the effect of the educational level of childcare facilities staff on the implementation of hygiene measures among children has not been reported, some studies showed that the education level of parents was positively correlated with the hand hygiene behavior of students (21). Childcare facilities staff play a vital role in taking care and teaching children, akin to children's parents. The educational level of staff should be considered in the health care work of the childcare facilities. This study showed that the childcare facilities staff were predominantly female individuals (97.7%) and mainly aged from 17 to 29 years old (46.4%), which was consistent with other studies (12, 14, 22). This demographic trend may be attributed the characteristics and caring needs of children (20). However, this study showed that there was no significant difference in the knowledge scores of the staff by gender and age. This aspect was inconsistent with the research of the resident, which showed that the older and female individuals were more compliant with COVID-19 prevention and control measures (7). The results of this study also showed that the more the years of working, the higher the score significantly. The scores of staff with training or supervision were significantly higher than those without training or supervision. This difference may be due to different health promotion models between the public and childcare facilities staff. This study revealed that the training rate was 84.8% in facilities and 77.9% by higher level organizations among the staff. Organized training was more targeted and definitely showed effectiveness in improving the disinfection and hand hygiene knowledge of childcare facilities staff.\n\nThe results of this study showed that the disinfection and hand hygiene knowledge scores of staff were significantly different between the two cities, and the scores in urban childcare facilities were significantly higher than those in rural childcare facilities. This finding was partly consistent with the survey results of public adults in America and Saudi Arabia, which demonstrated that it was different among different cities because of the COVID-19 situation probably. At the same time, there was no difference between rural and urban areas (7, 16). The difference between rural and urban areas in this study was consistent with the survey results of hand hygiene knowledge of kindergarten teachers in Zhejiang, Shanghai, China, during the COVID-19 pandemic (19, 22). This result may be due to the low educational level of staff from rural childcare facilities in China, and they were short of the ability and opportunity to acquire relevant knowledge (19). This study also showed that the percentage of staff in rural childcare facilities who received disinfection and hand hygiene technical training or supervision was significantly lower than that in urban areas. However, the spread rate of infectious disease clusters in rural schools was higher than that in urban areas, while the qualified rate of disinfection in rural schools was lower than that in urban areas (23, 24). Therefore, childcare facilities in rural areas were critical segments to improve the control and prevention strategies for infectious disease in China. Moreover, the results of this study showed that scores of staff with different regions, public or privately owned, education, and training or supervision were significantly different. Scores of staff with different ages, educations, professions, and training or supervision were significantly different. The influencing factors that influenced attitude and practice were inconsistent with that of knowledge, except for training and supervision. This aspect highlighted the importance of training and supervision effort and should be more targeted.\n\nThe results of this study demonstrated that the lowest knowledge accuracy rate of childcare facilities staff was about the usable range of disinfectants: The accuracy rate of “Know that alcohol disinfectants could not be used for all infectious diseases” was 46.3%. The lowest attitude and behavior accuracy were consistent with that of knowledge. “Consider that there is no need for large-scale outdoor disinfection during the pandemic” was the lowest accuracy rate for attitude (4.2%), and “Never sprayed alcohol to disinfect air since 2020” was the lowest accuracy rate for practice (5.3%). Although the Chinese government promoted work requirements such as the “seven No's” principle of disinfection and the application scope and use method of common disinfectants (25), this study showed inadequate implementation in childcare facilities. According to a survey among 154 countries, China is one of the countries with the highest use of disinfectants during the COVID-19 pandemic, alcohol-based and chlorine-based disinfectants were reported to be the most widely used. The most commonly reported health problems, including skin and respiratory issues, were related to the two disinfectants mentioned earlier (26). The reasons for health problems included misuse and overuse of disinfectants (26, 27). During the COVID-19 pandemic, alcohol poisoning accounted for 8.5% of children in the pediatric emergency department of a hospital in Turkey, indicating a higher incidence compared to before the pandemic (28). This study highlighted the dangers posed to both staff and children if disinfectants were misused. In the United Kingdom and the United States, there are monitoring systems for poisoning caused by exposure to disinfectants (27, 29), it is helpful to evaluate and provide guidance to the public on the proper use of disinfectants. It is suggested that China also needs to establish and improve a monitoring system covering the use of disinfectants, disinfection effectiveness, and adverse reactions.\n\nThe results of this study showed that although the accuracy rate of hand hygiene knowledge among the childcare facility staff was high—“Know that it is better to wash your hands with running water and hand sanitizer” and “Know the timing of hand hygiene” were 83.7% and 89.0%, respectively—the attitude of staff was positive too. The support rate of “Consider that the 6-step wash makes your hands cleaner” was 96.9%, the “always” practice rate of “Washed hands when coming back from public places from 2020” was 89.7%, which was consistent with the survey results of rural adults from 3 provinces in China (17), and it was higher than the rate of adult residents from Ghana (61.5%−66.5%) (8). However, the practice rate of “ Wash hands with six steps since 2020” was not high, with “always” measured at 63.0%. The rate was lower than the implementation rate (79%−87%) of adults who “always” washed their palms, back of hands, between the fingers, fingertips, and thumbs during the partial block in Saudi Arabia 2020 (30). It may be related to the trend of the pandemic, and the difference between respondents. Furthermore, washing hands with six steps needs more time, as the rate of washing at least 20 times was not high (51.7%) in rural adults from 3 provinces in China (17). This finding is similar to the responsibilities of medical workers as childcare facility staff take care of children, and their hand hygiene compliance should be improved. Some studies investigated disinfection and hand hygiene knowledge in childcare facilities. While the intervention methods varied significantly, such as training and publicity, facility improvement, and interest stimulation, the effectiveness remained inconsistent (31–33). To improve the operability of hand hygiene, some studies in medical institutions showed that three-step techniques with hand rubbing (1. covering all surfaces of the hands, 2. rotationally rubbing the fingertips in the palm of the alternate hand, and 3. rotationally rubbing both thumbs) resulted in higher compliance with both hand hygiene indications and technique compared to the six steps. As the results of the microbiological analyses exclude inferiority, the conventional six steps could be safely replaced by a simpler hand hygiene technique. Three-step techniques were simpler, faster, and easier to popularize among the public (34). However, whether three steps with water and handwashing work similarly or not, and the effects on infectious disease control and prevention in the community need to be studied. Moreover, childcare facilities should be accompanied by specifically structured, model surveillance studies that further clarify outstanding questions about infectious disease events and hygiene control (10)."
