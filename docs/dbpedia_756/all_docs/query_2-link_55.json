        "text": "Justine Yoon was born in Los Angeles to immigrant parents. She grew up to the north of Koreatown in Los Feliz, and describes her childhood as having been lively and active: from a young age, her parents put her and her older siblings through a variety of local leagues, sports, and extracurriculars, in part so that they might grow up immersed within American culture. Her parents were active within the Korean community as well: her father operated a private practice in Koreatown, and after his retirement ventured into the restaurant business with her mother which they’ve continued to this day. Justine would often work in her parents’ restaurants, whether it was by peeling and cleaning vegetables or going out into the markets to secure the best deals on wholesale ingredients. Today, she has taken a smaller role at her parents’ restaurants to pursue her own passions, something which exemplifies a larger internal struggle that children of immigrants must personally and uniquely reckon with: how we might actualize our own dreams—which our parents worked tirelessly for—while also honoring the sacrifices that went into creating opportunities for the next generation.\n\nVanilla Honey (she/they) is a queer architect and community organizer based in New York. Growing up on Long Island, Honey was never taught Korean by their mother, but they connected with their family and other Koreans through humor and playfulness. Being biracial, Honey often felt out of place in certain spaces, but discovering their queer identity brought a familiar fluidity between their experiences with race and gender.\n\nQueerness has been, and continues to be, a bridge connecting them to the larger Korean American community. Partnering with friends and other queer Koreans, they helped bring KQTx(@kqtxnetwork @kqtxnyc)—a national grassroots network aimed at uplifting Queer and Trans people of Korean descent—to New York City. Queer joy, for Honey, is a mix of warmth, smiles, and a sense of safety surrounded by loved ones. They remind us: “You’re not alone. Support is out there; you don’t have to rely on yourself.”\n\nJennifer Lee, 24, recounts her journey from Seoul, Korea, to North Bethesda, Maryland, where she now resides after immigrating to the United States with her mother and brother. She speaks about what it was like to be raised by a resilient mother who worked to provide for her young family in a new country and reflects on the love, support, and sympathy extended to her following the loss of her father at a young age. She talks about navigating college and career aspirations while switching from pre-health to computer science, where she found an interest in Human-Computer Interaction. Although initially conflicted on whether to pursue UX research and design, as this would mean more schooling rather than directly entering the workforce, her mother encouraged her to follow her passions instead of feeling burdened by the impossible weight of giving back to her family. She says that if she could give her younger self any advice, it would be to have confidence in yourself and what you do, because no matter how you feel toward yourself, there will always be those around willing to show you love and care.\n\nMatthias Chu, 25, was born and raised in Maryland. His story is one that resonates with many Korean American young adults, with the stresses and pressures of school and adulthood on his mind while also being of the age where he’s coming into his own identity. Part of this journey, he explains, has been navigating through his relationship with Christianity and the church, from interacting with students who attend church to having difficult conversations with his parents about his faith. Another part of the journey has been learning to navigate stress productively while not getting hung up on overthinking. Matthias talks about the guilt he feels from the difference in faith with his parents, as well as dropping out from college and working for two years; in both cases, he explains that he feels bad knowing what his parents want him to be, versus how he sees himself. Nonetheless, he feels grateful that as he grows older, his relationship with his parents has improved and that talking to them has become easier—despite the personal hardships and challenges that come with maturing as an adult, Matthias’ relationship with his family has always taken precedence.\n\nJinwoo Chung was born Montgomery County, Maryland, to parents who immigrated to the Rockville area from Korea. Holding a strong conviction to help others, Jinwoo studied psychology in college and eventually found work as a case manager and counselor for a boys group home. He recounts how, in forging relationships with youth who had experienced deep familial trauma, his perspective on family-building was deeply impacted. After navigating the emotional journey of fertility treatments with his wife, the family began to look into the process of adoption, a decision spurred by the couple’s unwavering belief in the power of familial love, irrespective of biological ties. When they matched with a birth mother through an adoption agency in Maryland, Jinwoo describes feeling initial anxiety about how his community would receive the family’s adoption of a child who would not present as Korean, but that this fear was quickly dispelled. He recognizes the fears and doubts that come with parenthood, especially through adoption, yet remains steadfast in his belief that every child deserves to be known and loved, through it all guided by his devotion to faith and family.\n\nJackie Faye was born in Dallas, Texas to Korean immigrants; in the 1970s, her grandparents first arrived in Los Angeles, relocated to Alaska, and finally settled in Texas. Faye strongly identifies as being queer, emphasizing the importance of acceptance: of herself, and the risks that come along with it. Yet despite Jackie’s exposure to pain and violence which seek to diminish her identity, she describes her journey as having been worthwhile for the agency and freedom she’s fought for over her own experiences and aspirations. Jackie carries on her father’s passion for music by creating and engaging with music herself, a form of art that allows her to express her thoughts and feelings, as honest as she can be. She emphasizes the importance of being true to yourself in any and every way possible, paying no attention to what others might think about you.\n\nAnne Joh engages in conversation with her son Alex Joh-Jung about each of their upbringings in the United States. She reflects on her life as a single mother, striving to be a “good Korean immigrant parent” raising her two sons, and having a moment of realization that what was most important for her as a parent was letting them know they always have a choice of not doing something. Anne in turn asks Alex about how he felt growing up under a working, single, and feminist mother. Alex reflects on how his mother’s convictions have shaped his political and academic worldview.\n\nJoseph Oh, originally born in Korea, faced a unique journey of adoption and cultural immersion. At the age of 5, he and his biological brother found a loving home in Chicago when a White family adopted them together. Tragically, after his adoptive father’s passing, Joseph was readopted into a Korean American family, that reintroduced him to his Korean heritage, culture, and traditions. Later, Joseph went back to Korea to teach English and explore Korean culture. It was during this time that he met his wife, who was also adopted. Today, Joseph is a father, determined to provide his son with the love and security he himself has come to cherish.\n\nChris Park, a 2nd generation Korean American, grew up in the States, mostly in the suburbs of Kansas City and San Antonio in the early 70s. While he experienced fewer instances of racism during his childhood, college introduced him to the Korean American community and its diverse relationships with identity and language. He noticed a “You’re either with us or against us” mentality within the community, leading him to distance himself due to a lack of shared values. Despite this, Park finds other ways to support the Korean American community and cherishes the importance of preserving his grandparents’ remarkable stories for his daughter to remember and appreciate.\n\nAlex Chang was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1959, but spent most of his early life in Venice, California. A few years ago Alex learned that the Korean government was searching for 103 Korean independence fighters and that his great-grandfather Chung Kul Whangbo -2011 Metal of Patriot and grandfather Ik Jun Hwangbo- 2017 Presidential Citation both had unclaimed Korean Independence Metals for their major contributions towards the independence of Korea from Japanese occupation over both their lifetimes. Alex is the current president and chair of the Korean American Pioneer Council, which mission is to collect and archive the histories of Korean American Pioneers and their descendants, and in 2015 Alex received a Certificate of Recognition from the city of Los Angeles for his service contribution to the community and in recognition of the 70th year of Korea’s Independence. Alex emphasizes the importance of preserving and passing down all Korean American stories and experiences to the next generations.\n\nHere is a link to the story he wrote a few years ago on his Great Grandfather and Grandfather.\n\nBorn a 2nd gen immigrant in Bakersfield, California in 1940, Irvin Paik recalls his unease around his Japanese neighbors and witnessing his parents face a lot of discrimination from white Americans. Irvin discovered a passion for theater in junior high school and continued to be involved with producing, writing, and acting in plays throughout high school and college. He even won an award in a Shakespeare competition at UCLA. Irvin also worked in photography, even pursuing a career in it, though he faced discrimination from employers.\n\nIrvin later found work in the army, filming training videos, serving in Vietnam as a combat photographer, and working as a script supervisor at a pictorial center in Long Island City. He also worked filming a television show for 14 years. After leaving the army, Irvin began filming nature documentaries, and, following a mandate from the Justice Department that encouraged the hiring of minorities, he was able to pursue film editing. With Koreans achieving huge successes in the modern entertainment industry, Irvin encourages young people to follow their dreams.\n\nBarbara Uni Lee Potter was born in the San Francisco area in 1943. She did not know she was adopted until she was 13 years old, and soon after had to navigate a complex history of family and lineage — a secret her family and community had kept from her. Barbara carried this tangled unknown with her until she was 45 years old when she decided to search for her birth mother. Barbara’s story teaches us the similarities and distinct differences of being adopted into a same-race family.\n\nMike Kim was born in Korea but grew up in the United States. After struggling to find a job during the 2008 recession, his cousin invited him to live in Korea for a year. Initially intending it to be a temporary move, Mike eventually sold all of his belongings and has now been living in Korea for the past 14 years.\n\nSince moving to Korea, Mike has constantly taken visiting friends to good restaurants, which ignited his passion for exploring and trying new Korean cuisine. Today, he has founded a food tour business that provides tourists with a delicious Korean food experience. Through food, he wants to share the beauty of Korean culture with as many people as possible.\n\nAlbert Kim was born in the US and spent most of his childhood in Orange County, California. Attending a private school with a small Korean population, Albert had a tough time dealing with the microaggressions of his peers and fitting in at school, challenges he faced for most of his childhood. While studying at Arizona State, Albert decided to move back to Korea, where he finally felt more comfortable and accepted– feeling at peace for the first time. Albert believes that his identity as a Korean-American has allowed him to be more well-rounded and empathetic as a person, especially towards other minorities that face discrimination.\n\nBorn in the US, but having grown up in Korea and attending an international school, Eunice Lee never felt fully Korean or fully American as a child. After a swimming injury, Eunice discovered musical theater as an outlet for her creative energies and eventually went to NYU for it.\n\nGoing to NYU after living in Korea for most of her life, Eunice faced difficulties with culture shock, assimilation, racism, and homesickness. Nevertheless, Eunice was able to find her niche through a Korean church and Korean American society. As someone who identifies as neither fully Korean nor fully American, Eunice carries a unique Korean American identity, as well as unique perspectives on Korean and American culture.\n\nMichael Song moved to Korea at the age of 22 after experiencing difficulty finding employment in the US. Born and raised in LA, Michael was immediately immersed in Korean culture upon starting full-time work in the country. This experience went beyond culture shock, providing Michael with an understanding of his parent’s immigration experience in the US and a new context for decisions they made when he was younger. Now, Michael strives to find a balance between his personal journey and cultural and societal expectations.\n\nBorn and raised in San Jose, Aaron Choe always knew he wanted to reconnect with Korean culture. In high school, he discovered 90s K-pop, which sparked a curiosity that eventually led him to visit his sister who lived in Korea. Aaron fell in love with the country and ended up moving there permanently in 2008. Since then, Aaron’s been living in Korea as a film director and DJ. Making sense of his identity, Aaron has fully embraced his Koreanness and encourages others to move there to truly experience the country.\n\nBorn a Korean American expat in Korea, Denny Hong grew up in various international and military schools in Korea, the U.S., and Germany. Denny’s family finally settled down in Memphis when he was in high school. While living in the states brought its own set of struggles, including racism, Denny has never let the challenges of his past define him. After returning to Korea to reconnect with his family and roots, Denny found himself enjoying life in Korea, keenly observing its shifting culture. Denny continues to live in Korea, and he now works as a radio broadcaster.\n\nBorn in Flushing, Queens, Albert Kim was raised speaking Korean by his grandparents throughout his time in elementary school. Even after his grandparents moved out, Albert maintained a connection to his Korean heritage through the practice of Samul Nori, traditional Korean drums. These connections grew stronger after Albert and his family moved to New Jersey while he was in middle school, and Albert found himself surrounded by even more Korean Americans in his community. Upon moving to Korea in his adulthood, Albert grappled with living with alopecia in a culture highly sensitive to physical appearances. Having moved around a lot throughout his life, Albert has learned to enjoy life by living in the moment.\n\nAs a kid, Ducky Chang didn’t see his parents often because they worked long hours running a grocery store and other jobs here and there.

It signals that I finished this, that I made something of my day. This compulsion for constant productivity, I am sure it stems from the way I was raised. Famously coined by legal scholar and writer Amy Chua, the term “tiger mom” refers to a parental figure with an incredibly authoritative child-rearing style—in other words, my parents. Like many other Korean parents, my mother and father were tiger parents for sure. Never accepting anything less than the best (my best was not enough, for I had to be the best out of everyone else as well), I strived to live up to their expectations.\n\nMarie Myung-Ok Lee is the author of the acclaimed novel The Evening Hero, a darkly comic story about a Korean American doctor in rural Minnesota facing retirement and the resurgence of long-buried secrets from his past.
