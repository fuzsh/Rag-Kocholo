A number of studies on trio have reported it’s significant impact on overall organizational performance and profitability across the globe. However, not much is studied about the individual level micro influence of these constructs on employee engagement (EE), organizational pride (OP), organizational identification (OI) and “desire to have a significant impact through work” (DSIW). Therefore, this study presents a comprehensive framework for assessing the impact of the implementation of CPP, SQ and CSR on EE, OP, OI and DSIW. Data collected from 320 non-managerial staff members employed at a garments manufacturing company in Pakistan was analyzed using partial least square (PLS) approach. Findings revealed that the implementation of CPP, SQ and CSR plays an important role in shaping EE, OP, OI and DSIW in the garments manufacturing industry. Further, it is found that the implementation of CPP has a non-significant impact on SQ. Additionally, results of the importance-performance map analysis (IPMA) have also confirmed that the implementation of CPP at company level has shown a highest importance and performance amongst all the latent constructs proposed as predictors of DSIW in the garments manufacturing industry. These findings are a step forward and unique contribution of this study in the domain of CPP, SQ, CSR, EE, OP, OI and DSIW.\n\nKeywords: Cleaner production practices, Desire to have a significant impact through work, Employee engagement, Corporate social responsibility, Service quality, Organizational pride and organizational identification\n\nGraphical abstract\n\n1. Introduction\n\nCleaner production practices (CPP) refer to “continuous application of an integrated preventive environmental strategy to processes, products, and services, to increase overall efficiency, and reduce risks to humans and the environment” (UNEP, 2006, p. 3). This comprehensive definition of CPP has clearly highlighted it’s adamant connection with both intangible (i.e. services) and tangible (i.e. finished goods) products. As an old saying goes, “prevention is better than cure” (Cobbett, 1918, p. 16; Ryan, 1938, p. 121). In this regard, Fresner (1998a, p. 171) notes that the implementation of CPP refers to the “preventive strategy to minimize the impact of production and products on the environment” (Fresner, 1998a, p. 171). Instead of focusing on the end of the pipe environmental protection measures, implementation of CPP concentrates on the simultaneous preventive measures for stopping emissions at their very self-same source (Fresner, 1998a; Yüksel, 2008). It is a universally putative fact that every human activity (i.e. whether it be food growing, electricity generation or garments manufacturing in our case etc.) has a possibility of releasing some amount of undesired specks/pollution in the environment (Bao et al., 2016; Dominoni et al., 2020; Gurram et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2019; Qadri and Faiq, 2020; Society, 2019; Zou et al., 2020). Garments manufacturing industry is not an exception, as it is considered among those industries, aftermaths of which are greatly hampering our eco-system around the globe (Belzagui et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2017; Saratale et al., 2020). Among all the known sources responsible for snowballing world over environmental pollution, garments manufacturing companies are majorly responsible for toxic wastes in the shape of effluence fumes and emission of greenhouse gasses (Haji and Naebe, 2020; Rather et al., 2019; Saratale et al., 2020).\n\nIn recent past, many academicians (e.g. Becerra-Guevara et al., 2020; Cesar da Silva et al., 2021; Jasti and Kodali, 2016; Kafuku, 2019; Neves et al., 2018; Ünal and Bilget, 2020; Yin et al., 2021) have proposed the usefulness of lean manufacturing principles in the textile manufacturing industry. However, we argue that lean manufacturing principles are primarily grounded on the philosophy of maximizing productivity by minimizing the ordeal of industrial waste (Botti et al., 2017; Cortez et al., 2020; Maia et al., 2019; Thomas et al., 2018). Furthermore, we assert that although industrial waste can be minimized by implementing the lean manufacturing principles (Andrade et al., 2020; Chauhan, 2016; Manfredsson, 2016; Shrafat and Ismail, 2019). Yet, the essence of organizational concern towards environment protection is much noteworthy in CPP (Aranda-Usón et al., 2020; Cesar da Silva et al., 2021; de Oliveira et al., 2019; Ramos et al., 2021; Scarazzato et al., 2017) which makes former significantly less industrious in terms of our environmental safeguard measures (Botti et al., 2017; Cong and Shi, 2019; Psomas and Antony, 2019; Salam and Farooq, 2020). Moreover, according to Yüksel (2008) CPP is more than a simple implementation of post-production environmental protection regulations (Cesar da Silva et al., 2021; de Oliveira et al., 2019; Frydenberg et al., 2004; Kennedy, 2020; Scarazzato et al., 2017). It goes far beyond unpretentious end of the production process measures/compliance (e.g. installing a water treatment plant at the end of bleaching process during common denim production) of the environmental regulations (Ben Hamida et al., 2018; Dalbaşı et al., 2019; Unuofin, 2020).\n\nRather, CPP also stands for pre-production (i.e. designing an environment friendly system layout before starting actual production process), in-production (i.e. employing environment friendly practices and methods during the production process) and post-production (i.e. services) environmental concerns (Cesar da Silva et al., 2021; Cong and Shi, 2019; Scarazzato et al., 2017; UNEP, 2006, p. 3; Yin et al., 2021). Moreover, implementation of CPP also helps in concentrating on ecofriendly system layout, convention of biodegradable compounds, environmentally concerned production processes and use of recyclable materials throughout whole production process (Fresner, 1998a; Hens et al., 2018; Ramos et al., 2021; Yüksel, 2008; Zhao and Zhang, 2020). Although, choice of policies, processes and designs for production (i.e. whether it be profit oriented or environment focused) is solely made by top management at company level (Bagozzi et al., 2018; Behrens et al., 2014; DeTienne et al., 2008; Dimitratos et al., 2011). However, during whole production process employees (i.e. non-managerial staff in our case) play a critical role in implementing the on ground functional aspects of CPP (Aranda-Usón et al., 2020; Potoski and Callery, 2018; Veleva et al., 2017). As a timeworn and time-tested adage from late 19th century says that “apple doesn’t fall far from the tree” (Galman, 2020, p. 141; Gubler et al., 2017, p. 1; Hayne and Barr, 2016, p. 792; Thornberry, 2009, p. 297).Therefore, in this aspect we argue that employees are also not far-off from how their organization treats their society (i.e. with reference to organizational corporate social responsibility (CSR) related efforts), individuals/customers (i.e. with reference to organizational concern towards customer care through service quality (SQ) related efforts) and their environment (i.e. with reference to organizational CPP related efforts).\n\nHowever, this novel connection between employees’ cognition, CPP, SQ and CSR implementation at company level has never been unveiled in previous CPP literature to date (Chang et al., 2010; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Latapí Agudelo et al., 2020; Wang, 2019). For that reason, now this study aims to offer a new comprehension into the minds of employees, and it will give an opportunity to the executives and policymakers to look at the implementation of CPP, SQ and CSR with the lens of employees’ perspective. Similar to the concept of CPP and CSR, various previous studies (e.g. Ghosh, 2018; Jahn and Brühl, 2019; Shabbir et al., 2016; Yadav et al., 2018) on the implementation of SQ and policy for implementing SQ at company level have studied SQ as a yardstick of firm level performance (Farooq, 2016; Farooq et al., 2018a; Rosenzweig et al., 2019; Sampaio et al., 2019). As stated earlier, employees are the ones who for being on the frontlines always take it on the chin (i.e. as they are going to actually execute practical on-ground work) whenever it comes to execute any new organizational measures/policies towards implementation of CPP, SQ and CSR at their workplace (Budnick et al., 2020; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Hayton, 2017; Hur et al., 2018; Love et al., 2020). In other words, this study is aimed to find out that how does employees comprehend and perceive the organizational efforts towards CPP, SQ and CSR at company level in the garments manufacturing industry. Moreover, a number of subject specific studies on the implementation of CPP, SQ and CSR (e.g. Anh Nguyen and Le VO., 2019; Augusto de Oliveira et al., 2019; de Oliveira et al., 2019; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Hsu and Chen, 2020; Liao et al., 2018; Ramos et al., 2021; Sinthupundaja et al., 2018) have acknowledged their distinct role in enhancing organizational performance and profitability.\n\nIn this context, this study submits that as a determinant of enhanced organizational performance and profitability, there is something fundamentally common between CPP, SQ and CSR. This commonality of essence between CPP, SQ and CSR is also further strengthened with our argument that primary goal of CPP, SQ and CSR is not and has never been to maximize the organizational profitability (Dare, 2016; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Salam and Farooq, 2020; Sennewald and Baillie, 2021). Rather, CPP, SQ and CSR have been implemented for satiating organizations’ commitment and concern towards protection of environment/eco-system and natural habitat (i.e. through implementation of CPP), provision of care for its’ customers (i.e. through best SQ for customers) and vision for the betterment of society (i.e. through CSR) in a broader perspective (Augusto de Oliveira et al., 2019; Farooq et al., 2018a; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Rosenzweig et al., 2019; Salam and Farooq, 2020). However, recent aforementioned studies (e.g. Anh Nguyen and Le VO., 2019; Augusto de Oliveira et al., 2019; de Oliveira et al., 2019; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Hsu and Chen, 2020; Liao et al., 2018; Ramos et al., 2021; Sinthupundaja et al., 2018) portraying CPP, SQ and CSR as a tool for fostering performance and maximizing organizational profitability have somehow driven us bit off-course from their primary underlying objective of environmental, individual and social well-being perspective respectively (Anh Nguyen and Le VO., 2019; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Hsu and Chen, 2020; Liao et al., 2018; Ware, 2021).\n\nIn other words, this study advocates that instead of only appreciating the off-target outcomes (i.e. profit maximization/monetary gains, organizational performance etc.) of CPP, SQ and CSR, their real benefits in terms of environmental, individual and social well-being should also be given due importance. Furthermore, underlying vividly spirited concept of civic responsibility (i.e. with the perspective of SQ and CPP) and philanthropic side (i.e. with the perspective of CSR) of these constructs is also seldom conveyed in earlier studies (e.g. Augusto de Oliveira et al., 2019; Dee, 2020; Hertig et al., 2020; Odriozola et al., 2017; Salam and Farooq, 2020; Sinthupundaja et al., 2018; Tracy et al., 2020) on the subject matter. As a result, the renunciation of primary objectives of the implementation of CPP, SQ and CSR has inevitably convulsed and led to a major fratricidal subjugation of the underlying philosophy of individual/customer care (i.e. SQ), social well-being (i.e. CSR) and environmental protection (i.e. CPP) in a broader perspective (de Oliveira et al., 2019; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Latapí Agudelo et al., 2020; Rodrigues and Mendes, 2018; Sennewald and Baillie, 2021). Therefore, this study argues that instead of gauging the outcomes of CPP, SQ and CSR with a yardstick of monetary gains, profitability or enhanced organizational performance, there is a sheer need to marshal the resources for enunciating the micro level impact (i.e. employees’ cognitive behavioral aspects in our case) of the implementation of CPP, SQ and CSR at company level (Farooq and Salam, 2020; Ramos et al., 2021; Salam and Farooq, 2020; Shi et al., 2021).\n\nAlthough, this underlying connection between the implementation of CPP, SQ and CSR has never been explored in the context of employees’ cognitive behavioral aspects. However, by enunciating them as predictors of positive workplace behavioral outcomes with regard to employee engagement (EE), organizational pride (OP), organizational identification (OI) and “desire to have a significant impact through work” (DSIW), this study can yield various new insights of interest to policymakers and academicians in the field of CPP, SQ and CSR. As stated earlier, not much is known about the role of the implementation of CPP, SQ and CSR at company level in determining micro level, cognitive, individual behaviors at workplace (Cong and Shi, 2019; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Ghosh, 2018; Salam and Farooq, 2020; Sennewald and Baillie, 2021). Therefore, it is important to explore that, how and by what means the implementation of CPP, SQ and CSR is perceived by employees? What is the impact of the implementation of CPP, SQ and CSR on various cognitive aspects (i.e. EE, OP and OI) of employees’ workplace behavior (i.e. DSIW)? As a result, this study is intended to address following research question in a broader perspective, i.e. does CPP at company level, in the presence of SQ and CSR, enhance the desire of employees (i.e. DSIW) to have a significant positive impact on society through work? Moreover, Farooq and Salam (2020, p. 16) have also called for more comprehensive studies for exploring the impact of the implementation of CPP, SQ and CSR at company level in determining DSIW. Therefore, this study intends to explore the potential significance and impact of the implementation of CPP, SQ and CSR at company level for inducing DSIW in the garments manufacturing industry.\n\nIt is anticipated that the results derived from this study will open a new horizon for exploring and comprehending the role of the implementation of CPP, SQ and CSR at company level. Moreover, this study will highlight trio as construct of significant importance for inducement of desirable individual level micro aspects of employees’ behavior at workplace (Farooq and Salam, 2020; Ramos et al., 2021; Salam and Farooq, 2020). For this purpose, a structural model is proposed in the context of CPP and SQ by extending John et al.’s (2019, 2017) work on CSR and DSIW. Opening with the elementary introduction of the subject matter, problem statement, research gap and research questions, this manuscript is structured in total six sub-sections. Manuscript starts with an in-depth introduction, followed by an extensive and subject specific critical literature review of CPP, SQ, CSR, EE, OP, OI and DSIW. Further, next section elaborates the logical connection among all constructs of our proposed structural model for articulating the underlying rational of our hypotheses development process. Moreover, research methodology is explained with coherent reasoning justifying the choice of structural equation modeling (SEM) approach for data analysis. Further, pre-analysis measures and data screening process is also elaborated in the research methodology and data analysis section. Partial least square (PLS) approach is employed for performing a rigorous analysis of our proposed structural model. Furthermore, an extensive and detailed discussion of findings is also presented after the research methodology and data analysis section. Finally, conclusion section elaborates the summarized findings of this manuscript along-with resultant theoretical contributions, prudently extracted managerial implications and major limitations, which are articulated to serve as future research directions for other scholars in this field.\n\n2. Literature review\n\n2.1. Cleaner production practices (CPP)\n\nImplementation of CPP at company level is a preventive approach, which is primarily aimed to rein in the environmental menaces caused by modern industrialization (Adapa, 2018; Andrews et al., 2002; Antero et al., 2020; Costa et al., 2021; Shi et al., 2021). Implementation of CPP can be embedded throughout the product lifecycle (Aranda-Usón et al., 2020; Augusto de Oliveira et al., 2019; Jakhar, 2015) as it encompasses product design (Cui et al., 2020; de Guimarães et al., 2017), product delivery (Giannetti et al., 2008; Hens et al., 2018) and product recycling etc. (Retta, 1999; Sousa-Zomer et al., 2018; Yin et al., 2020) with an aim to minimize their communal impact on our environment (Li et al., 2019; Pazienza and De Lucia, 2020; Yusup et al., 2015). Further, Fresner (1998a, p. 171) notes that the implementation of CPP is an effort to minimize the emissions at their very self-same source, and that CPP have a preventive attitude towards environmental issues (Fresner, 1998a, p. 171). In another such contemporary study Zeng et al. (2010) have suggested a substantial impact of the incorporation of CPP on the overall organizational performance (Agyabeng-Mensah et al., 2020; Fan and Fang, 2020; Shi et al., 2021). Similarly, in recent past many academicians (e.g. Augusto de Oliveira et al., 2019; Burritt et al., 2019; Cui et al., 2020; de Oliveira et al., 2019; Giannetti et al., 2008; Kiperstok, 2000) have asserted on the importance of the implementation of CPP at company level for it’s organizational (i.e. macro level) benefits in various industries (Cesar da Silva et al., 2021; Fan and Fang, 2020; S. Lu et al., 2020; Sheng et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2021).\n\nHowever, still not plentiful is known about the micro (i.e. individual level) influence of the implementation of CPP on the cognitions of workforce employed in the garments manufacturing industry (Farooq and Salam, 2020; Hens et al., 2018; S. Zhang et al., 2020). Therefore, employees’ perception and their perceived DSIW regarding the implementation of CPP at company level is yet unveiled (Farooq and Salam, 2020; Potoski and Callery, 2018; Veleva et al., 2017). Moreover, due to stakeholders’ constantly rising apprehensions towards mounting industrial pollution, environmental protection has gained a main prominence in various industries (Chen et al., 2013; Claudio, 2007; Kant, 2012; Roeck and Delobbe, 2012; Severo et al., 2015). Earlier studies on the subject matter (e.g. Boog et al., 2020; Calderon et al., 1991; Cazaudehore et al., 2019; Cui et al., 2020; Halkos and Skouloudis, 2018; Loague and Corwin, 2006; Meng et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2010) have also witnessed that environmental pollution has been principally linked with the industrial production across the globe. On the base of it’s source, environmental pollution is classified into two main categories (1) point source (i.e. where source of pollution is known and is easily identifiable), and (2) non-point (i.e. where source of pollution is unknown or it is hard to identify) source pollution (Elnakar and Buchanan, 2020; Loague and Corwin, 2006; Society, 2019; Yang et al., 2010).\n\nDue to its compact and curtailed nature, grounds and dregs of the point source pollution are often easily identifiable by using certain parameters (e.g. chemical oxygen demand (COD) measure) at industrial level (Boog et al., 2020; Cazaudehore et al., 2019; Meng et al., 2020). As per the United States Environmental Protection Agency (2020, 2015, 1996) point source pollution discharged from various industries is a major cause of the environmental disruption, water quality problems and air pollution around the globe (Calderon et al., 1991; Loague and Corwin, 2006; World Bank, 2020, 2019). Emissions discharged by the garments manufacturing industry are also classified as point source pollution (Loague and Corwin, 2006; Society, 2019; Yang et al., 2010). Many academicians (e.g. Calderon et al., 1991; Cui et al., 2020; Halkos and Skouloudis, 2018; Loague and Corwin, 2006; Wang et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2010) have asserted on the need to mitigate the point source pollution (i.e. pollution from garments manufacturing industry in our case) by stopping the hazardous industrial emissions at their very self-same source. As stated earlier, CPP encompasses a broader perspective towards quelling the menacing emanations throughout whole production process (Giannetti et al., 2020; Sousa-Zomer et al., 2018; Yin et al., 2021). Moreover, it also focusses on curtailing the impact of industrial emissions (i.e. from production process and from final products as well) on our environment by reducing those emissions at their very self-same source (Fresner, 1998a; Shi et al., 2021; UNEP, 2006; Yüksel, 2008). Therefore, this study argues that CPP can be regarded as a suitable control strategy for abating point source pollution in the garments manufacturing industry (Fresner, 1998a; Li et al., 2019; Ramos et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2004; Yüksel, 2008; S. Zhang et al., 2020).\n\n2.1.1. CPP in the garments manufacturing industry\n\nHazardous environmental impact of the garments manufacturing industry is an open secret and a bitter reality of our modern industrial development (Belzagui et al., 2019; Claudio, 2007; Gorman, 2020; Kant, 2012; Wang, 1999). However, widespread awareness regarding environmental issues and community pressure is now pushing garments manufacturing industry on the way to take various preventive measures (e.g. incorporating lean manufacturing principles and CPP etc.) to abate the environmental pollution (Hasle, 2014; Kant, 2012; Kozlowski et al., 2015; Parisi et al., 2015). In a contemporary analysis of the major causes of the industrial pollution Wang, 1999 has assessed 1500 industrial firms on the base of their cumulative COD levels derived from their plant-level data sets. On the base of his extensive analysis performed on the cumulative COD levels in different industries, Wang (1999, p. 13) has reported four major pollution intensive industries, i.e. “textile, chemical, paper and food” (Wang, 1999, p. 13). Additionally, Wang, 1999 noted that state owned plants working in the all four aforementioned sectors had a higher COD level (Wang, 1999). In this aspect, Nachiappan and Muthukumar (2010) have advocated the use of various eco-friendly and innovative techniques for reducing industrial COD level with particular reference to the textile industry. According to Kant (2012), various processes and practices involved in the fabric production (e.g. bleaching and dyeing etc.) can cause serious catastrophic and long-term threats to our environment.\n\nTherefore, many academicians (e.g. Hasle, 2014; Hodge et al., 2011; Jakhar, 2015; Niinimäki and Hassi, 2011; Parisi et al., 2015) have advocated the use of lean manufacturing principles for minimizing industrial waste in the garments manufacturing industry. However, lean manufacturing principles do not have much concern and apprehension towards environment protection and pollution eradication at their core creed (Botti et al., 2017; Kurdve and Bellgran, 2021; Ramos et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2021; Yin et al., 2020). Therefore, Ramos et al. (2018) have advocated the application of lean and clean production (LCP) which is a somewhat novice concept (Siriban-Manalang et al., 2019; Wong et al., 2020). Moreover, in this aspect Dieste et al. (2019) and Jesemann et al. (2020) have noted that the relation between the implementation of lean manufacturing principles and it’s overall impact on environmental protection is still elusive and debatable (Bhatt et al., 2020; Kafuku, 2019; Sadiq et al., 2021; Ünal and Bilget, 2020). Furthermore, it is a timeworn established fact that lean manufacturing principles are mainly focused on minimizing the ordeal of industrial waste (de Oliveira et al., 2019; Mohan Prasad et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2015). Which is largely connected with a resolve and potential of profuse underlying tenacity to maximize the overall production (i.e. specifically proven fruitful for automotive industry) in various industries (Costa et al., 2021; Izogo and Ogba, 2015; Ramos et al., 2018; Yadav et al., 2020, Yadav and Sagar (2015). Therefore, lean manufacturing principles are different from other environmentally idiosyncratic modern concepts of green production and CPP (de Oliveira et al., 2019; Guillen et al., 2020; Gupta et al., 2018; Sutari, 2015). In this backdrop, other studies (e.g. Chauhan, 2016; Dieste et al., 2019; Jesemann et al., 2020; Ünal and Bilget, 2020) have also agreed that the impact of the implementation of lean manufacturing principles for abating environmental pollution is not clear to date (Alefari et al., 2020; Costa et al., 2021; Guillen et al., 2020; Sadiq et al., 2021).\n\nFor that reason, various scholars (e.g. Ozturk and Cinperi, 2018; Petek and Glaviç, 2000; Rakib et al., 2017; San et al., 2018; Schaltegger et al., 2012) have recommended the implementation of CPP in the garments manufacturing industry (Taylor, 2006; Thompson and Tong, 2016; Yin et al., 2021; Yuan et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013). In this context, this study argues that as compared to evasive and unclear outcomes of lean manufacturing principles, CPP is an established and time-honored approach for abating the industrial pollution discharged from the garments manufacturing industry around the globe (Andrews et al., 2002; Mohan Prasad et al., 2020; Ramos et al., 2018; World Bank, 2019). Various practices involved in the garments manufacturing process can pose certain inescapable and irreversible damages (e.g. bleaching of grey cloth is a constant threat for our underground fresh water reservoirs) to our natural resources (Claudio, 2007; Kant, 2012; Knight, 1921; Patel et al., 2021; Soetaredjo et al., 2021). Therefore, in this context numerous scholars (e.g. Waldinger, 1986; Wang, 1999; Yang et al., 2010) have held garments manufacturing industry responsible for contaminating our major natural resources (Belzagui et al., 2019; Hodge et al., 2011; Mohan Prasad et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2021). It encompasses discharge of perilous fumes in air and peroxides in the fresh water reservoirs (Albolafio et al., 2021; Kant, 2012; Meng et al., 2020; Parisi et al., 2015; Soetaredjo et al., 2021; Yazdi and Soto, 2021). However, we argue that fabric production can be less hazardous if CPP is incorporated at company level for smothering these harmful emissions from the garments manufacturing industry (Haji and Naebe, 2020; Luo et al., 2018; Oliveira et al., 2016; Yin et al., 2020; Yüksel, 2008; Yusup et al., 2015).\n\nMore explicitly, various processes in the garments manufacturing industry e.g. selection of raw material (Amindoust and Saghafinia, 2017; Avadí et al., 2020; Daksa Ejeta et al., 2020), suppliers (Daksa Ejeta et al., 2020; Morali et al., 2016; Sela et al., 2020), cotton harvesting (Afzal et al., 2020; Sluijs and Roth, 2020; Wanjura et al., 2019), spinning (Fockink et al., 2020; Shao and Ma, 2019; Singh and Kumar, 2019), weaving (Baydar et al., 2015; El-Gohary et al., 2013; Hossain et al., 2018), dry and wet processing (Alkaya and Demirer, 2015; Fresner, 1998b; Kiran-Ciliz, 2003; Zhang et al., 2016), washing (Dumitrescu et al., 2008; Maryan and Montazer, 2013), bleaching (Baban et al., 2010; Narayanaswamy and Scott, 2001), dyeing (Al-Yousfi, 2004; Bhuiyan et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2017; Gong et al., 2018; Haji and Naebe, 2020; Long et al., 2014; Ozturk et al., 2015, 2014; Pisitsak et al., 2018; Schramm, 1998; Silva et al., 2018; Xiao et al., 2017; Yukseler et al., 2017), printing (Chen and Long, 2018; Ibrahim et al., 2015; C. Li et al., 2018; Tong et al., 2012), treatment of emissions/waste-water (Ali et al., 2016; Liang et al., 2018) and packaging/finishing processes (Ali et al., 2016; Benli and Bahtiyari, 2015; Manring and Moore, 2006; Ozturk et al., 2016) can be positively abridged and streamlined with the implementation of CPP at company level (Alkaya and Demirer, 2015; de Oliveira et al., 2019; Fresner et al., 2010; Ghazinoory, 2005; Ortolano et al., 2014). Furthermore, as discussed earlier, implementation of CPP is also regarded as an efficient preventive approach for abating point source (e.g. garments manufacturing industry in our case) industrial pollution (Andrews et al., 2002; Cong and Shi, 2019; Cui et al., 2020; de Guimarães et al., 2017; Fresner, 1998a).\n\nTherefore, this study submits that the importance of CPP for quelling effluences discharged by the garments manufacturing industry (i.e. categorized as point source industrial pollution) cannot be overstated (Cesar da Silva et al., 2021; Giannetti et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2016). Moreover, according to Yüksel (2008, p. S56) keeping environmental concern at its core, CPP is a broad and complex multidimensional phenomenon, i.e. it encompasses “production and processes design planning, product design and logistic design” (Yüksel, 2008, p. S56). Considering this fact, implementation of CPP seems to be a more suitable strategy than the implementation of lean manufacturing principles for mitigating various environmental hazards potentially instigated by the garments manufacturing industry (Dalbaşı et al., 2019; de Oliveira et al., 2019; Hodge et al., 2011; Mohan Prasad et al., 2020; Niinimäki and Hassi, 2011; Parisi et al., 2015). Furthermore, in this context de Oliveira et al. (2019) have thoroughly explored the implementation of CPP in the garments manufacturing industry. Their findings have also confirmed that implementation of CPP is substantially instrumental in achieving long-term sustainable organizational (i.e. macro level) goals in the garments manufacturing industry (de Oliveira et al., 2019; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Haji and Naebe, 2020; Ortolano et al., 2014). Further detail regarding the importance of micro (i.e. individual) level studies on the implementation of CPP at company level is presented in next section.\n\n2.1.2. Micro-level studies on CPP\n\nYüksel (2008) has noted that application of CPP at company level can result in maximizing firm performance (Giannetti et al., 2020; Ortolano et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2021). As a principal actor, liable for production in the modern industrialization, firms perform an important role in the application of CPP by controlling the processes and approaches espoused in their overall production processes (Fresner, 1998a; Kiperstok, 2000; Oliveira et al., 2016; Yüksel, 2008; Yusup et al., 2015). However, in this d’etat firms are being influenced by their stakeholders (e.g. investors, shareholders, sponsors, suppliers, customers and workers) and by government regulations as well (e.g. environmental policies and laws) for adopting CPP related measures (Andrews et al., 2002; Fresner, 1998a; Laforest et al., 2013; Severo et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015). Although, there are some studies (e.g. de Oliveira et al., 2019; Giannetti et al., 2008; Yüksel, 2008; Yusup et al., 2015; Zeng et al., 2010) available to inform us about the positive impact of the implementation of CPP on firm performance at macro (i.e. organizational) level. However, not much is studied about the micro (i.e. individual e.g. employees in our case) level impact of the implementation of CPP (e.g. impact on customer satisfaction/employees’ workplace behavior in our case) in the garments manufacturing industry (de Oliveira et al., 2019; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Niinimäki and Hassi, 2011; Parisi et al., 2015). Despite recognizing firms as a principal actor (i.e. majorly responsible) for implementing CPP at company level, which is suggested by Fresner (1998a, p. 171); this study argues that employees (i.e. actual functional staff/non-managerial staff) are the real representation of hands who are going to in fact carryout the implementation of CPP at the company level (Farooq and Salam, 2020; Potoski and Callery, 2018; Veleva et al., 2017).\n\nTherefore, it is imperative to determine the micro level impact (i.e. individual level/that is employee level in our case) of the implementation of CPP in the garments manufacturing industry (Farooq and Salam, 2020; Shi et al., 2021; Veleva et al., 2017). In consideration of this point, we submit that employees play a frontline role while implementing CPP at company level (Potoski and Callery, 2018; Veleva et al., 2017); however, their take on the implementation and impact of CPP has been grossly overlooked in previous studies (Adapa, 2018; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Matthews, 2018; Ramos et al., 2021; Yadav et al., 2020). In this context, this study argues that the mainstream and practical role of employees, which is undoubtedly very important for carrying out the on-ground implementation of CPP, needs a thorough exploration in the context of EE, OP, OI and DSIW (Hilson, 2000; Li et al., 2019; Ramos et al., 2021; Salam et al., 2019a; Salam and Farooq, 2020; Yusup et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015). Additionally, adding to the importance of this study Farooq and Salam (2020, p. 16) have also called for more micro level studies for ascertaining the relation between the implementation of CPP and DSIW (Farooq and Salam, 2020, p. 16). Moreover, as indicated earlier to date not much is known about the individual (i.e. micro level) influence of the implementation of CPP on the cognitive behavioral outcomes (i.e. EE, OP, OI and DSIW in our case) of employees at their workplace in the garments manufacturing industry (Adapa, 2018; de Guimarães et al., 2017; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Hilson, 2000; Retta, 1999; Scarazzato et al., 2017). For that reason, an in-depth study is required to explore these micro level cognitive behavioral outcomes (i.e. EE, OP, OI and DSIW in our case) of the implementation of CPP at company level in the garments manufacturing industry. Further discussion regarding SQ and it’s importance for garments manufacturing industry is elaborated in next section.\n\n2.2. Service quality (SQ)\n\nAs stated by Parasuraman et al. (1985, p. 42) three distinctive facets of SQ i.e. “intangibility, heterogeneity and inseparability” make it different from other aspects of a product’s quality (Parasuraman et al., 1985, p. 42). In this respect Parasuraman et al. (1988, p. 13) have noted that SQ is a “function of [the] difference between [the] service expected and [the] actual service delivered” (Parasuraman et al., 1988, p. 13). SQ has always received an ever increasing attention from a vast number of academicians (e.g. López-Ospina et al., 2021; Qiu et al., 2020; Salam and Farooq, 2020; Samen et al., 2013; Shabbir et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2020) in the field of social sciences. Moreover, many studies (e.g. Aagja and Garg, 2010; Farooq et al., 2018a; Grönroos, 1984; Nunkoo et al., 2019; Parasuraman et al., 1985) have reported it’s positive impact on a number of encompassing desirable outcomes (e.g. customers’ loyalty, satisfaction, positive word-of-mouth, trust and re-purchase intention etc.) in various industries (Ertekin et al., 2020; López-Ospina et al., 2021; Patten et al., 2020; Shao et al., 2004; Towers and Xu, 2016). Although, SQ is considered as an inevitable integral part of majority of pre-production (e.g. stakeholder analysis, customer need assessment, market survey and dealing with prospective clients etc.) and post-production (e.g. product marketing, sales, recovery and after sales services etc.) processes (Dorai et al., 2021; Mandhani et al., 2020; Mocholi-Arce et al., 2020). Yet, during our preliminary literature review, it was observed that SQ is often congregated under the umbrella of two different sectors (i.e. service sector and manufacturing sector) across the globe (Berardino and Onesti, 2020; Dias et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2003).\n\nAlthough, previous studies (e.g. Alsmadi et al., 2012; Berardino and Onesti, 2020; Brueckner and Flores-Fillol, 2020; Dias et al., 2020; Liao, 2020; Mathieu, 2001; Wang et al., 2003; Yuen and Chan, 2010) have highlighted and criticized the widening rift between service sector and manufacturing sector. However, aforementioned studies (e.g. Alsmadi et al., 2012; Berardino and Onesti, 2020; Brueckner and Flores-Fillol, 2020; Dias et al., 2020; Liao, 2020; Mathieu, 2001; Wang et al., 2003; Yuen and Chan, 2010) have been somehow stopping short when it came to outrightly integrate and acknowledge the critical role of SQ in the manufacturing (e.g. garments manufacturing industry in our case) sector (Alsmadi et al., 2012; Berardino and Onesti, 2020; Dias et al., 2020; Lanza et al., 2021). As a result, over the period this disintegration of SQ in two different sectors (i.e. service sector and manufacturing sector) has led to an unending ordeal of poor SQ in the manufacturing sector (Berardino and Onesti, 2020; Dias et al., 2020; Rosenzweig et al., 2019). Although, in a theoretical point of view only service sector/service industry seems to be more concerned with the delivery of SQ (Lanza et al., 2021; Mandhani et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2014; Qin et al., 2010). However, this study argues that inseparable and inextricable nature of service (see Parasuraman et al., 1985, p. 42) from it’s origin/providers warrants a premeditated integration of SQ in the manufacturing sector (Dias et al., 2020; Ertekin et al., 2020; Farooq et al., 2018a; Wang et al., 2003).\n\nFurther detailed literature review has revealed that various scholars (e.g. Abrahams, 1983; Grönroos, 1984; Haywood-Farmer, 1988; Kang and James, 2004; Leisen Pollack, 2009; Parasuraman et al., 1985; Yi and Gong, 2008) have also presented different conceptual models for integrating SQ in the manufacturing sector. Moreover, it is expected that thoroughly planned integration of SQ can help in putting an ending dot on the incessant ordeal of poor SQ in the manufacturing sector (Berry et al., 1990; Mefford, 1993; Silvestro, 1998; Voss, 1992). Therefore, this study also asserts that adamant role of SQ should be meticulously integrated in the manufacturing sector as well (Dias et al., 2020; Mandhani et al., 2020; Towers and Xu, 2016; Yoder et al., 2019). For that reason, this study has made an effort to integrate the concept of SQ with other organizational (i.e. CPP and CSR) and individual (i.e. EE, OP, OI and DSIW) level constructs in the context of manufacturing (i.e. garments manufacturing industry in our case) sector. Moreover, in recent past a substantial consideration has also been given to the dimensions and measures of SQ (Akter et al., 2013; Balaban et al., 2013; Cristobal et al., 2007; Kaatz, 2020; Li and Shang, 2019; Martins et al., 2019; Salam and Farooq, 2020; Wang and Chiu, 2011). In this aspect, Farooq et al. (2018a) and Salam and Farooq (2020) have observed that diverse measures and dimensions of SQ depend on the distinct nature of different industries.\n\nAlthough, earlier studies (e.g. Akter et al., 2013; Bahia and Nantel, 2000; Cristobal et al., 2007; Octabriyantiningtyas et al., 2019; Qiu et al., 2020; Senthilkumar and Arulraj, 2011) do not have a unanimous take on the dimensions of SQ (Bahia and Nantel, 2000; Farooq et al., 2018a; Salam and Farooq, 2020; Senthilkumar and Arulraj, 2011). Yet, technical aspects of quality and functional aspects of quality are the two most definite and obvious basic aspects of SQ in any industry (Farooq et al., 2018a; Grönroos, 1984; Hou et al., 2020; Konijnendijk, 1993; Prentice and Kadan, 2019; Resende and Cardoso, 2019; Salam and Farooq, 2020). Further, Neave (1987) has noted that SQ is often relinquished for the sake of maximizing organizational profitability and short term organizational gains. In this context, this study argues that the primary objective of SQ was to gracefully serve, befit and attend customers with utmost care (Berry et al., 1985; Grove et al., 1992; Lehtinen and Lehtinen, 1982; Peng et al., 2014; Zeithaml, 1981). Hence, SQ was purely a customer focused and individual (i.e. micro level) centered approach (Berry et al., 1985; Bertrand, 1989; Cavaness and Manoochehri, 1993; Grove et al., 1992; Haywood-Farmer, 1988; Salam and Farooq, 2020). In this regard, Deming (1994, 1986) and Juran (1988, 1964) have also asserted on the role of individuals (i.e. micro level/employees in our case) and workmanship in promoting SQ at company level (Goodman et al., 1994; Juran et al., 1974; Mann, 1989; Scherkenbach, 1986).\n\nHowever, driving us off course today majority of the studies on SQ (e.g. Brady et al., 2002; Farooq et al., 2018a; Hong et al., 2020; Hung et al., 2003; Rod and Ashill, 2010; Tiernan et al., 2008; Wang, 2019) are portraying it as a mere tool for maximizing organizational profitability/performance (Salam and Farooq, 2020). Acknowledging the enhanced organizational performance and profitability as an off-target benefit of the implementation of SQ at company level, this study submits that according to Bertrand (1989) and Neave (1987) this idea of promoting SQ as a mere tool for maximizing short term organizational gains is in itself a contradiction of Deming’s (1986), Crosby’s (1979) and Juran’s (1964) fundamental philosophy of quality (Cavaness and Manoochehri, 1993; Crosby, 1996; Deming, 1994; Goodman et al., 1994; Juran, 1988; Mann, 1989; Peng et al., 2014). Hence, aforementioned studies (e.g. Brady et al., 2002; Farooq et al., 2018a; Hong et al., 2020; Hung et al., 2003; Rod and Ashill, 2010; Tiernan et al., 2008; Wang, 2019) have largely lost the plot and have somehow deviated from the underlying primary objective of implementing SQ at company level (Farooq, 2016; Salam, 2020; Salam and Farooq, 2020). Therefore, this study suggests that in order to escalate the underlying philosophy of SQ implementation as per the guidelines of Deming (1986), Crosby (1979) and Juran (1964) it should be taken as a construct of individual well-being (Bertrand, 1989; Cavaness and Manoochehri, 1993; Deming, 1994; Juran, 1988). Furthermore, this study submits that rather than taking it as a meagre tool for attaining short-range profitability and nippy organizational gains, SQ implementation should be envisioned as a strategic choice in line with long-term organizational goals (Juran, 1988; Neave, 1987; Peng et al., 2014; Peterson and Barker, 1992).\n\nMoreover, as stated earlier Deming (1994, 1986) has also advocated the role of workmanship, pride and EE for promoting intangible aspects of quality (Farooq et al., 2018a; Neave, 1987; Salam and Farooq, 2020). However, inaptly quality control managers who were responsible for implementing “company-wide quality-control” (CWQC) overlooked these intangible aspects and focused more on the physical characteristics (i.e. with regard to the quality of their products) and other somatic aspects of their products (Berry et al., 1985; Cavaness and Manoochehri, 1993; Farooq et al., 2018a; Hutchins, 1984). Therefore, SQ (i.e. intangible in nature) was grossly undermined in the garments manufacturing industry (Hutchins, 1984; Peng et al., 2014; Peterson and Barker, 1992; Salam and Farooq, 2020). Moreover, it is an established fact that mill owners/manufacturers also focus too much on the tangible aspects of their product’s quality, that in certain cases they leave all their gains on the table by not focusing enough on their SQ in the garments manufacturing industry (Cavaness and Manoochehri, 1993; Chang and Chen, 2008; Patten et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2014; Perry and Towers, 2009; Towers and Xu, 2016). Therefore, this study submits that vending a good product without good SQ is not a long-term conceivable strategy (Brueckner and Flores-Fillol, 2020; Farooq et al., 2018a; Nunkoo et al., 2019; Peng et al., 2014; Salam and Farooq, 2020). Further discussion regarding the role of SQ implementation in the garments manufacturing industry is presented in next section.\n\n2.2.1. SQ in the garments manufacturing industry\n\nManufacturing sector (i.e. garments manufacturing industry in our case) is so much focused on the physical aspects of their product quality, that it is often ill-equipped to ensure SQ during marketing, sales and after sale interaction with their customers (Cavaness and Manoochehri, 1993; Gronroos, 1982; Mann, 1989; Peng et al., 2014; Scherkenbach, 1986; Shafiq et al., 2019). Therefore, proponents of quality (e.g. Cavaness and Manoochehri, 1993; Farooq et al., 2018a; Hutchins, 1984; Peterson and Barker, 1992; Salam and Farooq, 2020) have emphasized on the prominence of CWQC. The concept of CWQC is easy to implement in the manufacturing sections of any company; however, due to intangible nature of services, SQ as a part of CWQC is much difficult to ensure (Cavaness and Manoochehri, 1993; Hutchins, 1984; Peterson and Barker, 1992). As stated earlier, when it comes to SQ in the backdrop of it’s heterogeneous and intangible nature, delivery of good SQ is more complex in the garments manufacturing industry than the delivery of a good quality product (Abrahams, 1983; Cavaness and Manoochehri, 1993; Crosby, 1996; Farooq et al., 2018a; Mills et al., 2010; Neave, 1987; Peng et al., 2014; Salam and Farooq, 2020). For that reason, Denton (1989, p. 108) notes that “generally speaking, service is in a sorry state and consumers are fed up with it” (Denton, 1989, p. 108). Therefore, considering the importance of SQ in the garments manufacturing industry, in recent past various important aspects of SQ have been studied in the garments manufacturing industry across the globe (Patten et al., 2020; Shao et al., 2004; Towers and Xu, 2016; Xie et al., 2010).\n\nIn this context, Towers and Xu (2016) have studied the impact of SQ of physical distribution systems on the sourcing of fashion apparels from the garments manufacturing industry of China. Similarly, Xie et al. (2010) have linked various similar SQ attributes to the distinct perspectives of medical garments’ supply chain in the non-profit organizations. Likewise, Shao et al. (2004) have reported that appropriate choice of garments and perceived SQ greatly influences customers’ purchase intentions. Furthermore, Patten et al. (2020) have also illustrated that the volatile nature of fashion retailing and garments manufacturing industry is quite sensitive and it is critically influenced by the implementation of SQ at company level. Further, in this regard Cavaness and Manoochehri (1993, p. 6) have noted that a customer can possibly return a substandard product (e.g. a T-shirt in our case) but a poor SQ or a bad experience instigated by insolent behavior of a salesman is very difficult to return (Cavaness and Manoochehri, 1993, p. 6). Therefore, it is important to explore the deep-rooted cognitive aspects (i.e. EE, OP, OI and DSIW in our case) of the implementation of SQ at company level in the garments manufacturing industry (Anisul Huq et al., 2014; Basili and Rossi, 2020; Konijnendijk, 1993; Waldinger, 1986). In this regard, this study argues that an organization’s concern towards SQ at company level, somehow influences it’s employees’ behavior and DSIW as well (Farooq and Salam, 2020; Patten et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2014; Salam et al., 2019a; Towers and Xu, 2016).\n\nTherefore, this study argues that DSIW is a cognitive aspect which is somehow stimulated by organization’s take on the implementation of SQ at company level and sways employees’ desirable progressive outcomes (i.e. EE, OP and OI in our case) at workplace in the garments manufacturing industry (Farooq and Salam, 2020; Patten et al., 2020; Towers and Xu, 2016). In this respect, numerous studies (e.g. Chang and Chen, 2008; Chen and Chang, 2008; Iacobucci et al., 1996; Laksamana et al., 2013; Lam et al., 2004; Mazursky et al., 1987; Patten et al., 2020) have associated poor SQ with brand switching behavior. Moreover, various other obscure and impalpable aspects of SQ in the manufacturing industry (i.e. garments manufacturing industry in our case) are still not fully apprehended to date (Patten et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2014; Phuong Vu et al., 2019; Prentice et al., 2019). Therefore, this study intends to discover the cognitive upshots of the implementation of SQ in the form of EE, OP and OI in the garments manufacturing industry. In this respect, many academicians (e.g. de Oliveira et al., 2019; Farooq and Salam, 2020, p. 16; Kant, 2012; Le et al., 2019; Parisi et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2014; Wang, 2019) have also called for further studies in the domain of SQ implementation in the context of CPP in the garments manufacturing industry. Therefore, this study is aimed to address the paucity of information about the implementation of SQ at company level in the garments manufacturing industry. For this purpose, this study submits that organization’s commitment towards SQ implementation also encourages it’s employees to go to a great length to deliver good SQ with high EE, OP and OI in the garments manufacturing industry. Further detail regarding CSR and it’s importance for garments manufacturing industry is explained in next section.\n\n2.3. Corporate social responsibility (CSR)\n\nA lot has been written about the desirable outcomes of the implementation of CSR at company level (Bekmeier-Feuerhahn et al., 2017; Dahlin et al., 2020; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Hawn and Ioannou, 2016; Liao and Mak, 2019; Murillo and Lozano, 2006; Real de Oliveira and Ferreira, 2014; Shen and Zhang, 2019; Tang et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2020). Various academicians (e.g. Arena et al., 2018; Farooq and Salam, 2020) agree that the conception of CSR dates back to 1950s, when it was first mentioned in the Bowen’s (1953) famous book entitled “Social Responsibilities of the Businessman”. In his book Bowen (1953, p. 6) defined the phenomenon of CSR as “the obligations of businessmen, to pursue those policies, to make those decisions, or to follow those lines of action, which are desirable, in terms of the objectives and values of our society” (Bowen, 1953, p. 6). Since then, many other scholars and institutions (e.g. Aguilera et al., 2007; Aguinis and Glavas, 2012; Carroll, 1999; Carroll and Shabana, 2010; Glavas and Kelley, 2014, pp. 165–166; Sheehy, 2015; Silberhorn and Warren, 2007; Wan-Jan 2006; World Business Council for Sustainable Development, 1999) have also defined CSR with some minor and basic variations of it’s facets in the form of different traits and contexts (Farooq and Salam, 2020; Jahn and Brühl, 2019; Kolk, 2016; Mohamed Adnan et al., 2018; Potdar et al., 2020).\n\nHowever, according to Farooq and Salam (2020, p. 2) the fundamental concept of social well-being and societal benefit has always remained embraced in all the different definitions of CSR as a core objective of it’s implementation at company level (Chintrakarn et al., 2021; Kim and Lee, 2020; Popkova et al., 2021). However, Ting (2020) has noted that CSR implementation policy of large firms is not more than just paying a lip service to the main philosophy of CSR (Farooq and Salam, 2020; Glozer and Morsing, 2019). In this regard, Ting (2020) further argues that in most of the cases CSR implementation policy is designed in such a way which is self-serving to organizations’ own corporate and commercialization goals (Chintrakarn et al., 2021; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Glozer and Morsing, 2019). Hence, in most of the corporations practical application of CSR is not in harmony with the Bowen’s (1953, p. 6) philosophy (i.e. as depicted in the aforementioned definition of CSR), which was primarily aimed to befit the desirable societal objectives and concerns (Barbosa and de Oliveira, 2021; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Glozer and Morsing, 2019; Ting, 2020). Thereby, in the d’etat race of commercialism the feisty elements of care for “society” and the pivotal concept of social welfare, which were a hallmark of the implementation of CSR are now lost somewhere in-between (Farooq and Salam, 2020; Glozer and Morsing, 2019; Liao and Mak, 2019; Ting, 2020; Yang et al., 2020).\n\nMoreover, numerous studies (e.g. Basil and Erlandson, 2008; Bekmeier-Feuerhahn et al., 2017; Glozer and Morsing, 2019; Gosselt et al., 2019; Hawn and Ioannou, 2016) have noted that in the wake of competing for market share, CSR implementation is being publicized as a marketing tool for capitalizing on the organizational goodwill (Farooq and Salam, 2020; Houghton et al., 2009; Liao and Mak, 2019; Ting, 2020; Yang et al., 2020). For that reason, we argue that Bowen’s (1953) concept of CSR implementation, which was primarily intended to get on board with the organizational initiatives for the benefit of society is now seen as a subtle assortment of self-serving organizational initiatives (Farooq and Salam, 2020; Maloni and Brown, 2006; Welford, 2004). Therefore, Glozer and Morsing (2019) have denoted this wide of the mark between philosophy and practical implementation of CSR as a double-talk and “hypocrisy” at company level. Despite all this deprecation on the wide of the mark between practical implementation and underlying philosophy of CSR it’s abiding outcomes cannot be easily annulled (Bekmeier-Feuerhahn et al., 2017; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Hawn and Ioannou, 2016; Yang et al., 2020). Therefore, in this backdrop of tough market competition being led by globalization and e-commerce, CSR implementation is still considered as a strategic foundation for gaining competitive advantage at organizational level by promoting a soft image and goodwill in the industry (Carroll, 1999; Jeon et al., 2020; Xie et al., 2019; Zaid et al., 2020). Although, importance of these organizational (i.e. macro level) benefits of the implementation of CSR cannot be denied (Ahn et al., 2019; Arrive and Feng, 2018; Benitez et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2019). Yet, there is a lot more to the individual level (i.e. also referred as micro) benefits (i.e. in the form of desired cognitive influence on employees) which can also be reaped from the implementation CSR at company level (Ghosh, 2018; Lauring and Thomsen, 2008; Lee et al., 2013; Roeck and Delobbe, 2012).\n\nIn this context, various scholars (e.g. Basil and Erlandson, 2008; Gosselt et al., 2019; Hawn and Ioannou, 2016; Sinthupundaja et al., 2018; Yoon and Chung, 2018) have emphasized on the segregation of internal (i.e. focused on internal stakeholders, e.g. employees in our case) and external (i.e. focused on external stakeholders and society) CSR related policy at company level. Further, as noted by Real de Oliveira and Ferreira (2014) CSR also influences employees’ performance by exciting expedient workmanship and employee satisfaction at company level (Farooq and Salam, 2020; Yarram and Adapa, 2021; Q. Zhang et al., 2020). Therefore, CSR is also considered as a construct of interest for policymakers and academicians, when it comes to enhancing EE (Farooq and Salam, 2020; Hur et al., 2018; Jindo et al., 2020; Matthews, 2018; Real de Oliveira and Ferreira, 2014), OP (Farooq and Salam, 2020; John et al., 2019, 2017; Lea and Webley, 1997, pp. 325–326; Shahzadi et al., 2019), OI (Farooq and Salam, 2020; Ghosh, 2018; John et al., 2019, 2017; Rosengren and Bondesson, 2017; Shahzadi et al., 2019), trust (Ghosh, 2018; Lee et al., 2013; Shi et al., 2015; Yadav et al., 2018), citizenship behavior (Bavik, 2019; Demir, 2015; Donia et al., 2016; John et al., 2019; Lam et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2010; Tufan and Wendt, 2019; Zhang et al., 2017) and DSIW (Farooq and Salam, 2020; John, 2017; John et al., 2019, 2017; Jun Hao, 2019; Morgeson et al., 2013; Shahzadi et al., 2019) at company level. Thus, we also propose that the implementation of CSR can inculcate expedient workmanship behavior in the form of EE, OP and OI at company level. Further discussion regarding implementation of CSR in garments manufacturing industry continues in the next section.\n\n2.3.1. CSR in the garments manufacturing industry\n\nAs stated earlier, precarious environmental effects on the natural resources (e.g. water contamination etc.) have become a staple of the production chin pull in the garments manufacturing industry (Belzagui et al., 2019; Cotton et al., 2020; Kant, 2012; Parisi et al., 2015). For that reason, garments manufacturers have been incorporating CSR as a marketing tool for shaping the fragmented perception of their stakeholders and end users (Anh Nguyen and Le VO., 2019; de Abreu, 2015; Jammulamadaka, 2016; Lee and Lee, 2015; Metzner and Fischer, 2010; Perry and Towers, 2009; Salma, 2016). Although, garments manufacturing industry has been imparting a notable role in CSR related activities around the globe (Anh Nguyen and Le VO., 2019; Cazeri et al., 2018; Jammulamadaka, 2016; Metzner and Fischer, 2010; Perry and Towers, 2009; Salma, 2016). However, still much is yet to be discovered regarding the perceptive impact of CSR related practices in the garments manufacturing industry (Baskaran et al., 2011; Chi, 2011; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Jahn and Brühl, 2019; Jammulamadaka, 2016; Kolk, 2016; Mohamed Adnan et al., 2018; Potdar et al., 2020). In a recent study, Salma (2016) has reported the use of CSR implementation as a promoting/publicizing tool in the garments manufacturing industry of Bangladesh. According to Salma (2016) CSR is often taken as a tool for disseminating a soft image of the garments manufacturing industry in Bangladesh. Likewise, Jammulamadaka (2016) has explored the roots of CSR implementation in the Bombay based Indian textile firms. In a similar study, Abreu et al. (2012) have explored the implementation of CSR with the perspective of it’s cross-cultural impact on Brazilian and Chinese textile firms. Similarly, Metzner and Fischer (2010) have also validated the significance of the implementation of CSR in Brazilian garments manufacturing companies.\n\nTherefore, in view of this pervasive acceptance of the significance of CSR in the garments manufacturing industry (Abreu et al., 2012; Jammulamadaka, 2016; Metzner and Fischer, 2010; Salma, 2016); it appears that in order to be equitable and globally competitive, garments manufacturing companies also have to prepare a clear roadmap for implementing CSR at company level (Baskaran et al., 2011; de Abreu, 2015; Lee and Lee, 2015; Popkova et al., 2021). Further, in this regard Anh Nguyen and Le VO (2019) have also acknowledged the positive outcomes of the implementation of CSR as a dynamic tool for streamlining a stable supply chain network in the textile sector. Furthermore, Perry and Towers (2009) have also acknowledged the influence of CSR implementation in the garments and fashion industry of United Kingdom. Similar findings are also reported by Chi (2011) in the context of Chinese garments and apparel manufacturing industry. Hence, various evidences have been reported in the earlier studies (e.g. Abreu et al., 2012; Anh Nguyen and Le VO., 2019; Baskaran et al., 2011; Chi, 2011; Jammulamadaka, 2016; Lee and Lee, 2015; Perry and Towers, 2009; Salma, 2016) which have linked the concept of CSR with the desirable organizational outcomes in the garments manufacturing industry (Farooq, 2016; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Popkova et al., 2021; Q. Zhang et al., 2020). However, aforementioned studies (e.g. Abreu et al., 2012; Anh Nguyen and Le VO., 2019; Baskaran et al., 2011; Chi, 2011; de Abreu, 2015; Jammulamadaka, 2016; Lee and Lee, 2015; Metzner and Fischer, 2010; Perry and Towers, 2009; Salma, 2016) have overlooked the cognitive facets of the implementation of CSR on workmanship behavior in the garments manufacturing industry. Therefore, this manuscript intends to investigate the implications of the implementation of CSR with a specific reference to employees’ behavioral cognitive outcomes (i.e. EE, OP, OI and DSIW in our case) in the garments manufacturing industry.\n\n2.4. Employee engagement (EE)\n\nImportance of EE at workplace has been evidently acknowledged in numerous recent studies (e.g. Duraisingam et al., 2020; Duthler and Dhanesh, 2018; Farooq and Salam, 2020; He et al., 2019; Kwon and Kim, 2019; Milliman et al., 2018). According to Kahn (1990, p. 700) EE denotes to “simultaneous employment and expression of a person’s ‘preferred self’ in the task behaviors, that promote connections to work and to others, personal presence (physical, cognitive, and emotional), and active, full role performances” (Kahn, 1990, p. 700). Further, Rich et al. (2010, p. 618) have also endorsed Kahn’s (1990, p. 700) concept of EE by denoting it with “physical, emotional and cognitive involvement” at one’s workplace (Rich et al., 2010, p. 618). A number of studies on workplace performance (e.g. Chung, 2016; Corvalan, 2018; Karanges et al., 2015; Odriozola et al., 2017; Sutherland, 2017) have confirmed that engaged employees are more creative and more productive for their organizations. According to Rameshkumar (2019) EE has a strong impact on organizational commitment. Further, Albrecht et al. (2018) have suggested that working conditions and organizational climate also play a crucial role in determining EE at workplace. In this regard, Jindo et al. (2020) have affirmed that provision of exercise and recreational activities can substantially influence EE at workplace by minimizing job related stress. Further, Lemon and Palenchar (2018) have emphasized on the importance of public relations for improving employees’ psychological well-being and EE at workplace.\n\nHowever, with an ever-increasing dependence on distractive technologies maintaining EE at workplace is becoming a next to impossible thing (Farooq et al., 2017; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Jena et al., 2018; Kang et al., 2019; Ngo et al., 2020). Therefore, Rich et al. (2010) and Roberts and David (2017) have noted that most of the employees who are physically present at their workplace are not mentally involved in their job (Duraisingam et al., 2020; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Hammedi et al., 2021). In this regard, Roberts and David (2017) have noted that phubbing (e.g. scrolling mobile phone while sitting in class room/while attending a meeting with boss) is a modern challenge which gravely hinders a person’s ability to perform at workplace (Aagaard, 2020; Chotpitayasunondh and Douglas, 2018; Cohen et al., 2020). Moreover, it is often reported that managers every so often try unsuccessfully to wean their workers off phubbing at workplace (Chotpitayasunondh and Douglas, 2016; Roberts and David, 2020, 2017; Yasin et al., 2020). In this context, Kim and Gatling (2017) have recommended the use of online virtual platforms for enhancing EE and employee retention at workplace (Côté et al., 2020; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Hammedi et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2020). Further, He et al. (2014) have noted that procedural justice at organizational level also enhances EE at workplace by inculcating a feeling of parity among employees (Hammedi et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2020; Sandhya and Sulphey, 2020). In certain cases employees have to use their best judgment (i.e. requires high level of EE and decision making skills) for maximizing customer satisfaction through good SQ (Cavaness and Manoochehri, 1993; Gorman, 1999; Humphrey, 2017; Salam and Farooq, 2020). Therefore, EE also plays an imperative role in the delivery of good SQ in various major aspects of a SQ oriented business (Cavaness and Manoochehri, 1993; Marier, 2013; Petersen and Maynard, 1981; Salam and Farooq, 2020). In this regard, Potoski and Callery (2018) have noted that peer communication also improves working condition and EE at workplace.\n\nMoreover, according to Tsourvakas and Yfantidou (2018) EE is also influenced by the right and on time implementation of CSR at company level. Further, Nikolova et al. (2019) in their cross-lagged analysis have confirmed that EE is also influenced by the presence of engaged leadership. In this regard, Farooq and Salam (2020, p. 7) have asserted that EE is an important factor for determining DSIW at workplace. Being a multi-dimensional concept EE encompasses three major dimensions, i.e. “physical, emotional and cognitive engagement” (Rich et al., 2010, p. 634). Numerous studies (e.g. Duraisingam et al., 2020; He et al., 2014; Matthews, 2018) have reported the significance of EE for organizational performance. Moreover, in this regard Cavaness and Manoochehri (1993) have noted that EE can be enhanced by maximizing employee empowerment, expanding their authority and enhancing their task breadth with proper training and in-place accountability measures (Børing et al., 2019; Petersen and Maynard, 1981; Roberts and David, 2017; Tiwari and Lenka, 2019). In a latest study Farooq and Salam (2020, p. 7) have assessed the role of EE as a mediator among CSR and DSIW. Their results have established that EE is significantly influenced by the implementation of CSR in commercial airlines (Farooq and Salam, 2020). However, still not much is known regarding the role and significance of EE in the garments manufacturing industry (Farooq and Salam, 2020; Jena et al., 2018; Kang et al., 2019; Veleva et al., 2017). Therefore, it is predictable that the results derived from this comprehensive study can offer some new comprehensions regarding the role and significance of EE in the garments manufacturing industry.\n\n2.5. Organizational pride (OP)\n\nOP is often documented as an important success factor for ramping-up organizational performance (Gouthier and Rhein, 2011; Kraemer and H.J. Gouthier, 2014; Lobo et al., 2020; Masterson et al., 2017; Tang et al., 2020). The concept of OP denotes to an emotional and cognitive attachment (i.e. also referred as bonding) between organization and it’s employees, which makes workers proud of their association with their organization (Durrah et al., 2020; Lehtman and Zeigler-Hill, 2020; Men and Yue, 2019; Swenson, 1995). Many academicians (e.g. Abrash Walton, 2018; Lea and Webley, 1997, pp. 325–326; H. Lu et al., 2020; Swanson and Kent, 2017; Zhang et al., 2017) have widely acknowledged the desirable outcomes of OP, for uplifting individuals’ psychological well-being along-with enhanced organizational performance and profitability (Durrah et al., 2020; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Kraemer et al., 2020). According to Durrah et al. (2020) OP is a significant predecessor of creativity at workplace. In this context, Boezeman and Ellemers (2014) have noted that OP inculcates an element of respect and satisfaction among workers (Boğan and Dedeoğlu, 2020; Schaefer et al., 2020). Furthermore, Gouthier and Rhein (2011) have also acknowledged that positive workmanship behavior is an outcome of OP (Kraemer and H.J. Gouthier, 2014; H. Lu et al., 2020; Schaefer et al., 2020). Hence, individual level outcomes of OP (i.e. in the form of creativity at workplace, satisfaction and positive workmanship behavior etc.) can not be denied (Bryant, 2020; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Marier, 2013; Schumpeter, 1950). However, previously mentioned studies on the implementation of CPP, SQ and CSR (e.g. Augusto de Oliveira et al., 2019; Hung et al., 2003; Liao et al., 2018; Yoon and Chung, 2018; Zeng et al., 2010) in the domain of organizational behavior have concentrated only on their (i.e. CPP, SQ and CSR’s) performance based financial outcomes. By doing so, they have overlooked various behavioral, emotional, cognitive and psychological aspects of employees’ state of mind, which do encompass OP as well (Boğan and Dedeoğlu, 2020; Farooq and Salam, 2020; H. Lu et al., 2020). In this regard, Lu and Roto (2016) have presented different design strategies for enhancing OP at workplace.\n\nFurther, Lythreatis et al. (2019) have noted that participative role of top management is also very important for enhancing OP in SMEs (Lobo et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020). Furthermore, OP also influences delivery of good SQ as it can also ramp-up customer oriented behavior at workplace (Cohen et al., 2020; Hammedi et al., 2021; Kraemer et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020). According to Kraemer et al. (2020), customer oriented behavior is an outcome of OP, which ultimately enhances customers’ satisfaction as an outcome of good SQ. Moreover, many academicians (e.g. Brosi et al., 2018; Gouthier and Rhein, 2011; Humphrey, 2017; Kraemer and H.J. Gouthier, 2014; Lythreatis et al., 2019; Mas-Machuca et al., 2016) have agreed that employees’ emotional and cognitive state of mind (e.g. OP in our case) has a significant influence on their whole performance at workplace (Boğan and Dedeoğlu, 2020; Cohen et al., 2020; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Kraemer et al., 2020). According to Arnett et al. (2002) OP is often used as an internal-marketing tool because it significantly enhances employees’ satisfaction at workplace. Further, Bagozzi et al. (2018) have noted that ethical/conscientious decision making and conforming to morally responsible business practices uplift OP by motivating self-conscience employees. Moreover, Jenks et al. (2010) and Ng et al. (2019) have also highlighted some prudent details regarding the implications and significance of OP. As stated by Ng et al. (2019) OP can be instrumental in minimizing employees’ turnover intentions. According to John (2017, p. 30), OP has a direct effect on OI, and it has a mediating impact on the relation between the implementation of CSR and OI. On the other hand, John et al. (2017, p. 9) have noted that OP has a direct effect on DSIW with a mediating impact on the relation between the implementation of CSR and DSIW. These findings of John et al. (2017, p. 9) also corroborate with Farooq and Salam (2020, p. 7), who have reported OP as a mediator between the implementation of CSR and DSIW in commercial airlines. However, diverging from John et al. (2017, p. 9) findings of few recent studies by Shahzadi et al. (2019, p. 8) and John et al. (2019, p. 787) have suggested that OP has a substantial impact on OI, and it is a significant mediator between the implementation of CSR and OI.\n\nHence, these findings of Shahzadi et al. (2019, p. 8) and John et al. (2019, p. 787) coincide with the initial propositions of John (2017, p. 30); yet, they are in contradiction with the outcomes described by John et al. (2017, p. 9) and Farooq and Salam (2020, p. 7). Further, Mas-Machuca et al. (2016, p. 591) have also asserted on the importance of OP for enhancing workplace performance. In this regard, Mas-Machuca et al. (2016, p. 591) have acknowledged that OP mediates the connection among work-life balance and employees’ satisfaction. Moreover, Brosi et al. (2018, p. 362) have described that OP inculcates an attitude of being proactive at workplace. Furthermore, Brosi et al. (2018, p. 362) have acknowledged that connection among OP and proactiveness is mediated by organizational commitment. Therefore, we argue that outcomes of these aforementioned studies on OP (e.g. Brosi et al., 2018; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Jenks et al., 2010; John, 2017; John et al., 2019, 2017; Lea and Webley, 1997, pp. 325–326; Mas-Machuca et al., 2016; Shahzadi et al., 2019) are self-contradictory. Moreover, previous studies on OP were conducted in various other industries, e.g. airline industry (Farooq and Salam, 2020, p. 8), real estate industry (John, 2017, p. 33; John et al., 2019, p. 787, 2017, p. 6; Shahzadi et al., 2019, p. 5), non-profit organizations (Boezeman and Ellemers, 2014, p. 164) and multiple other service industries (Gouthier and Rhein, 2011, p. 640). Thereby, aforementioned studies (e.g. Brosi et al., 2018; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Jenks et al., 2010; John, 2017; John et al., 2019, 2017; Lea and Webley, 1997, pp. 325–326; Mas-Machuca et al., 2016; Shahzadi et al., 2019) have undermined the role of OP in promoting positive workplace behavior in the distinct nature of the garments manufacturing industry. For that reason, we submit that more studies are warranted to validate the significance of the phenomenon of OP in the garments manufacturing industry.\n\n2.6. Organizational identification (OI)\n\nThe phenomenon of OI dates back to early 1990s when (Mael and Ashforth 1992, p. 107) first introduced it’s operationalization through self-reported data (Farooq and Salam, 2020; Knippenberg and Schie, 2000; Riketta, 2005; Valle et al., 2020; Weng and Cheng, 2019). According to (Mael and Ashforth 1992, p. 107), OI denotes to the employees’ psychological bond (i.e. often signified as perceived oneness) with their organization (Basu and Sen, 2021; Walker, 2020). Further, Abernethy et al. (2019) and Brown (2017) have noted that OI influences numerous socio-cognitive elements at workplace (Blader et al., 2017; Boezeman and Ellemers, 2014; Demir, 2015). According to Graham et al. (2019), OI also influences ethicality at workplace. Similarly, Teng et al. (2020) have also suggested the significance of OI for ramping-up and promoting citizenship behavior and ethical/conscientious workplace behavior. Further, Chen et al. (2016) have asserted that OI has a substantial impact on moral reasoning and pro-organizational behavior (Abernethy et al., 2019; Avanzi et al., 2018). Moreover, Chevalier et al. (2019) have stated that OI has a considerable influence on the organizational commitment (Gruhl et al., 2021; Piercy and Carr, 2020). In this regard, Zagenczyk et al. (2020) and Wang et al. (2017) have described that there is a phenomenal connection between organizational support, EE, adaptability, OI and organizational commitment (Basu and Sen, 2021; Valle et al., 2020; Walker, 2020). It means that employees with high OI consider themselves as a part of their organization (Akdoğan et al., 2016; Børing et al., 2019) and organizational success is considered as their own success (Moriano et al., 2014; Rosengren and Bondesson, 2017; van Zoonen and Treem, 2019). Further, Carmeli et al. (2007) have argued that when workers identify themselves with their organization, they put extra hard-work and dedication in the tasks assigned to them at their workplace.\n\nMany academicians (e.g. Asadullah et al., 2017; Boezeman and Ellemers, 2014; Fallatah et al., 2017; Filho et al., 2020) have linked OI with higher performance at workplace (Farooq and Salam, 2020). In this regard, Thurston and Glendon (2018) have suggested that in certain cases level of risk exposure at workplace and employee empowerment also influence OI. Moreover, Wu et al. (2016) have noted that OI also mediates the relation between ostracism at workplace and citizenship behavior. Further, Rawski and Conroy (2020) have acknowledged that OI positively influences diversity training and volunteering behavior among workers. Therefore, Yue et al. (2020) have also asserted on the adamant importance of organizational culture and internal communication for enhancing OI at workplace. Moreover, Tarakci et al. (2018) have suggested that performance feedback also substantially influences OI (Gruhl et al., 2021; Piercy and Carr, 2020; Walker, 2020). Furthermore, according to Jones (2010) and Lu et al. (2016) OI implies that employees are emotionally attached (i.e. they take pride in being a part of their organization) with their organizations (Piercy and Carr, 2020; Valle et al., 2020). In this regard, Liu et al. (2019) have noted that perceived justice and perceived support received from one’s supervisors at workplace can substantially enhance employees’ OI (Boğan and Dedeoğlu, 2020; Tang et al., 2020; Walker, 2020). Furthermore, numerous scholars (e.g. Jones, 2010; Matherne et al., 2017; Mazancieux et al., 2020) have also acknowledged that OI serves as a precursor of role-breadth, which enhances employees’ desire to stay ahead in outperforming others by assuming extra-roles at their workplace.\n\nIn this context, Moriano et al. (2014) have also acknowledged that emotional bond of OI motivates employees to contribute with their best performance at their workplace (Basu and Sen, 2021; Piercy and Carr, 2020; Tsui and Ngo, 2015; Tufan and Wendt, 2019). According to John (2017, p. 30), OI is influenced by OP and right implementation of CSR. Moreover, John (2017, p. 30) has stated that the relation between OP and OI is moderated by DSIW. On the other hand, John et al. (2017, p. 9) have asserted that OI has a direct impact on DSIW. Additionally, in this regard John et al. (2017, p. 9) have acknowledged that the nexus among CSR and DSIW is mediated by OI. These findings of John et al. (2017, p. 9) coincide with Farooq and Salam’s (2020, p. 7) recent study on commercial airlines, validating the proposition of a significant connection between OI and DSIW. However, Shahzadi et al. (2019, p. 8) have illustrated that the direct relation between the implementation of CSR and OI is moderated by DSIW. Contrary to them, Qian and Jian (2020) have reported that OI has a direct relation with organizational cynicism. Further, in this regard Qian and Jian (2020) have acknowledged that a strong mediation of OI also exists in the relation between ethical/conscientious leadership and organizational cynicism. In another study John et al. (2019, p. 787) have reported the significance of OI as a precursor of citizenship behavior (i.e. also known as employees’ voluntary commitment (Demir, 2015; Lin et al., 2010) towards organizational goals) and task performance (i.e. also known as employees’ effectiveness (Borman and Motowidlo, 1997) on their job) at workplace.\n\nHowever, Ertürk and Albayrak (2019) have asserted that OI is also influenced by employee empowerment and leader-member exchange at workplace (Basu and Sen, 2021; Piercy and Carr, 2020; Valle et al., 2020). In this regard, Ertürk and Albayrak (2019) have noted that the element of trust moderates the relation between OI, employee empowerment and leader-member exchange at workplace (Basu and Sen, 2021; Piercy and Carr, 2020; Valle et al., 2020). Further, disavowing all the aforesaid desirable outcomes of OI, Conroy et al. (2017) have highlighted the dark side of OI. According to Conroy et al. (2017) OI can cause identity threat at workplace, which can be instrumental in instigating an attitude of resistance towards accepting organizational change (Basu and Sen, 2021; Gruhl et al., 2021; Tang et al., 2020). However, in this regard Neill et al. (2019) have noted that internal communication and OI have a substantial influence on organizational change. Therefore, on the base of these self-contradictory findings of various aforementioned studies on OI (e.g. Conroy et al., 2017; Ertürk and Albayrak, 2019; Farooq and Salam, 2020; John, 2017; John et al., 2019, 2017; Matherne et al., 2017; Neill et al., 2019; Qian and Jian, 2020; Shahzadi et al., 2019; Tsui and Ngo, 2015) this study argues that more studies are warranted to evaluate the significance of OI in the garments manufacturing industry. Moreover, this study submits that the concept of OI is novice to CPP, SQ and CSR literature; therefore, it requires a thorough investigation to validate the implications of OI in the garments manufacturing industry.\n\n2.7. Desire to have a significant impact through work (DSIW)\n\nDSIW is also a pretty novice phenomenon and many academicians (e.g. Daly, 2018; Farooq and Salam, 2020; John, 2017; John et al., 2019, 2017; Jun Hao, 2019; Pham and Paillé, 2019, p. 265; Shahzadi et al., 2019) have highlighted the dearth of in-depth studies in this domain. The concept of DSIW does not have a very long history as compared to CSR, which can be traced back to early 1950s (Arena et al., 2018; Bowen, 1953; Farooq and Salam, 2020). Literature review has shown that the concept of DSIW was first presented by Gully et al. (2013, p. 936) when they studied the recruitment process of social and environmentally concerned employees (Farooq and Salam, 2020; Gully et al., 2013, p. 936). Since then, many other scholars (e.g. Daly, 2018; Farooq and Salam, 2020; John, 2017; John et al., 2019, 2017; Jun Hao, 2019; Morgeson et al., 2013; Pham and Paillé, 2019, p. 265; Shahzadi et al., 2019) have examined the concept of DSIW in various contexts of social sciences and human behavior. According to Morgeson et al. (2013, p. 815) the concept of DSIW is grounded on the base of Barrick et al.‘s (2013, p. 134) notion of purposefulness (Barrick et al., 2013, p. 134; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Morgeson et al., 2013, p. 815). In this regard, Barrick et al. (2013, p. 134) state that all employees have an intrinsic desire to make a meaningful contribution to their society for improving the lives of others through their work (Barrick et al., 2013, p. 134; Bohns and Flynn, 2021; Farooq and Salam, 2020).\n\nFurther in this context, Barrick et al. (2013, p. 134) have also noted that DSIW is a self-driven instinct, which plays a vibrant role in imparting a positive and evocative contribution in others’ lives through respectable service delivery in the form of good SQ and upright performance at ones’ own workplace (Farooq and Salam, 2020). Furthermore, Morgeson et al. (2013, p. 815) were the first ones to link the concept of CSR with DSIW (Farooq and Salam, 2020). By doing so, Morgeson et al. (2013, p. 815) theoretically extended the previous DSIW related work of Gully et al. (2013, p. 936); however, they have not suggested any framework for validating such relation between CSR and DSIW (Farooq and Salam, 2020). Later, John (2017, p. 30) presented a conceptual framework explaining the connection between CSR, OP, OI and DSIW. He claimed that DSIW moderates the relation between OP and OI (John, 2017, p. 30). After that in another study John et al. (2017, p. 9) described the mediating impact of OP and OI among CSR and DSIW. Developing on the work of aforementioned researchers Daly (2018, p. 17) proposed a conceptual model for assessing the role of DSIW in defining a positive relationship among volunteering activities and the recruitment outcomes. Further, John et al. (2019, p. 787) suggested that DSIW also moderates the relationship among CSR and OI.\n\nAfterwards, another scholar Jun Hao (2019, p. 11) also assessed the connection between CSR and DSIW. He argued that DSIW is also influenced by organizations’ concern towards their social and environmental responsibility, which is communicated through their messages (e.g. commercials and job advertisements etc.) at company level (Jun Hao, 2019, p. 11). Moreover, Jun Hao (2019, p. 11) also presented a model which suggests that DSIW moderates the relation between “pro-environmental job ads” and Kristof’s (1996) “person-organization fit”. Later on, in another related study Pham and Paillé (2019, p. 265) found that DSIW positively influences “green recruitment and selection” (GRS) related process at company level. Further, Pham and Paillé (2019, p. 265) suggested that DSIW also moderates the relation between “corporate environmental sustainability” (CES) and “jobseekers’ pride” (Farooq and Salam, 2020). Further, similar to the findings of John et al. (2019, p. 787), in another study Shahzadi et al. (2019, p. 8) have also confirmed the moderating role of DSIW between the implementation of CSR and OI. Developing on the aforementioned studies of John et al. (2019, 2017) in another study on commercial airlines Farooq and Salam (2020, p. 7) have proposed that along-with OP and OI, EE also mediates the relationship among CSR and DSIW (Farooq and Salam, 2020, p. 7). This comprehensive discussion on DSIW literature starting from 2013 to 2020 has confirmed that a positive and meaningful contribution imparted by daily routine job related activities creates a sense of fulfillment and achievement in the workers with conscience (Farooq and Salam, 2020).\n\nTherefore, Gully et al. (2013, p. 936) have also noted that employees strive to find purposefulness in the concurrent activities they perform at their workplace. Attainment of meaningful and desired outcomes is not possible without completely understanding and finding purposefulness in the daily activities performed at ones’ workplace (Beadle and Knight, 2012; Bunderson and Thompson, 2009; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Minkov and Hofstede, 2011; Supanti and Butcher, 2019). Finding meaningfulness and conscience in one’s work leads to a sense of achievement, pride and self-satisfaction at workplace (Barrick et al., 2013; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Ghosh, 2018; Goh et al., 2015; John et al., 2017; Sutherland, 2017). In this regard, a number of studies (e.g. Daly, 2018; Liu and Jansen, 2017; Seitz and Farhadi, 2019; Son, 2011; van Zoonen and Treem, 2019) have acknowledged that the relation between desire, expectation, achievement and empathy is as old as is human history itself (Bohns and Flynn, 2021; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Graus et al., 2021; Klein and Shoshana, 2020; Mitchell et al., 2020; Yurtsever et al., 2021). However, DSIW is relatively new phenomenon and it has a close assimilation with Digman’s (1990) five factor model (Farooq and Salam, 2020; Vergauwe et al., 2017). Though, in recent past many academicians have employed five factor model (e.g. Guido, 2006; Vergauwe et al., 2017) and DSIW (e.g. Daly, 2018; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Gully et al., 2013, p. 936; John, 2017; John et al., 2019, 2017; Jun Hao, 2019; Morgeson et al., 2013; Pham and Paillé, 2019, p. 265; Shahzadi et al., 2019) in management studies. However, literature review has revealed some self-contradictory findings.\n\nFor instance, as stated earlier John (2017, p. 30) suggested a moderating impact of DSIW in the connection between OP and OI. Whereas, John et al. (2017, p. 9) have reported the implementation of CSR as a determinant of DSIW. However, later in some other studies Shahzadi et al. (2019, p. 8) and John et al. (2019, p. 787) have illustrated that DSIW is a moderator among CSR and OI. Differing from them Farooq and Salam (2020, p. 7) asserted that DSIW is determined by EE, OP and OI. Therefore, this study argues that findings of these aforementioned studies on DSIW (e.g. Daly, 2018; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Gully et al., 2013, p. 936; John, 2017; John et al., 2019, 2017; Jun Hao, 2019; Morgeson et al., 2013; Pham and Paillé, 2019, p. 265; Shahzadi et al., 2019) are all self-contradictory and warrant further comprehensive studies. Moreover, it should be noted that above-mentioned studies on DSIW (e.g. Daly, 2018; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Gully et al., 2013, p. 936; John, 2017; John et al., 2019, 2017; Jun Hao, 2019; Morgeson et al., 2013; Pham and Paillé, 2019, p. 265; Shahzadi et al., 2019) have not incorporated the impact of the implementation of CPP and SQ in determining DSIW at company level. Additionally, their outcomes cannot be generalized for the garments manufacturing industry, because their sample had no representation from the garments manufacturing industry (Farooq and Salam, 2020). Therefore, a more in-depth and rigorous study is warranted to fully understand the connection between the implementation of CPP, SQ and CSR along-with their impact on DSIW at company level in the garments manufacturing industry.\n\n3. Hypotheses development\n\nAlthough, since many decades implementation of CPP, SQ and CSR has been studied as a construct of importance for enhancing organizational performance at macro level (Augusto de Oliveira et al., 2019; Dieste et al., 2019; Farooq, 2018; Farooq et al., 2018a; Giannetti et al., 2008; Kiperstok, 2000; Yüksel, 2008; Yusup et al., 2015). However, motivators and micro level outcomes of the implementation of CPP, SQ and CSR at company level are not fully known to date (Adapa, 2018; Augusto de Oliveira et al., 2019; Cui et al., 2020; Oliveira et al., 2016; Severo et al., 2015). Additionally, we propose that the implementation of CPP, SQ and CSR have much in common. For instance, SQ is implemented for the betterment of services rendered to individuals (Denton, 1989; Farooq, 2018; Farooq et al., 2018a; Furrer et al., 2000; Salam and Farooq, 2020). CSR refers to the organizational accomplishments undertaken for the benefit of society (Farooq and Salam, 2020, p. 2; Mohamed Adnan et al., 2018; Olthuis and van den Oever, 2020; Potdar et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2019). Similar concept of individual, societal and environmental concern at the core of CPP, makes it much closer to SQ and CSR related environmental initiatives at company level (Cong and Shi, 2019; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Ramos et al., 2018; Sousa-Zomer et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2015).\n\nFurthermore, relationship between CPP and SQ is also evident from the aforementioned UNEP’s (2006, p. 3) comprehensive definition of CPP, which has clearly articulated the adamant connection between CPP and services (Farooq and Salam, 2020, p. 16; UNEP, 2006, p. 3). Therefore, Farooq and Salam (2020, p. 16) have also suggested that the implementation of CPP may have a wide range of potential cognitive behavioral effects on DSIW. Moreover, considering the collective concern for the betterment of society by environment friendly practices, this study asserts that the implementation of CPP can play a positive role in improving overall organizational image (Andrews et al., 2002; Augusto de Oliveira et al., 2019; Burritt et al., 2019; Giannetti et al., 2008). As stated in the aforementioned literature review section EE, DSIW, OP, OI and SQ are potentially influenced by the implementation of rightly perceived CPP related organizational activities, undertaken at company level for overall individual, societal and environmental betterment (Bagozzi et al., 2018; Bavik, 2019; Boezeman and Ellemers, 2014; Cazeri et al., 2018; Farooq and Salam, 2020). For that reason, this study submits that it is plausible that CPP can influence EE, DSIW, OP, OI and SQ in the garments manufacturing industry. Therefore, building on the aforementioned literature review and rational opinions generated from previously mentioned studies, this study proposes following hypotheses:\n\nH1a\n\nImplementation of CPP has a positive impact on EE\n\nH1b\n\nImplementation of CPP has a positive impact on DSIW\n\nH1c\n\nImplementation of CPP has a positive impact on OP\n\nH1d\n\nImplementation of CPP has a positive impact on OI\n\nH1e\n\nImplementation of CPP has a positive impact on SQ\n\nSQ implementation has been extensively studied for it’s role in tourism, banking, health management, airline industry, education sector and fashion industry (Aagja and Garg, 2010; Abdullah et al., 2011; Bahia and Nantel, 2000; Bellizzi et al., 2020; Farooq et al., 2018a; Gourdin, 1988; Salam and Farooq, 2020; Samen et al., 2013; Wang, 2019). Although, previous studies have explored it’s impact on customers’ loyalty, consumer perspective and overall organizational performance (e.g. Brueckner and Flores-Fillol, 2020; Farooq et al., 2018a; Salam and Farooq, 2020; Sureshchandar et al., 2002; Tsoukatos and Mastrojianni, 2010); however, not much is studied about its influence on employees’ cognitive behavioral outcomes (Côté et al., 2020; Hammedi et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2020). In a contemporary study on the emotional and cognitive facets of working behavior in hotel employees Wang (2019) has explored the concept of emotional labor for enhancing SQ. According to Wang (2019), there is a phenomenal connection between emotional labor and SQ implementation at company level (Farooq et al., 2018a; Salam and Farooq, 2020). However, still much is yet to be unveiled in terms of SQ’s role in determining EE, OP and OI (Farooq and Salam, 2020; Gruman and Saks, 2011; Macey and Schneider, 2008; Saks, 2006; Sandhya and Sulphey, 2020). For that reason, developing on the rational opinions derived from above-mentioned studies on SQ, this study suggests that the intention of providing good SQ is plausibly somehow linked with EE, OP and OI. Therefore, it is hypothesized that:\n\nH2a\n\nImplementation of SQ has a positive impact on EE\n\nH2b\n\nImplementation of SQ has a positive impact on OP\n\nH2c\n\nImplementation of SQ has a positive impact on OI\n\nIn last few years management literature has seen a rising trend of CSR implementation related studies in industrial sector across the globe (e.g. Bavik, 2019; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Kang et al., 2020; Lee, 2008; Supanti and Butcher, 2019). According to Glavas and Godwin (2013) overall perception of goodness, which is conceded through the implementation of CSR by some means influences employees’ OI at workplace. According to Farooq and Salam (2020, p. 4) OI refers to a point where employees are so much gratified, content, satisfied and attached with their organization that they themselves choose to be identified with their employer/organization and they recognize that their identity is linked with their employer/organization (Chahal and Devi, 2013; Lee, 2008; J. Li et al., 2018; Salam et al., 2019b). In this aspect, many academicians (e.g. Arnett et al., 2002; Gouthier and Rhein, 2011; Salam et al., 2019a; Swanson and Kent, 2017) have also acknowledged the connotations of OP as a potential outcome of the implementation of CSR at company level (Farooq and Salam, 2020). As stated earlier, OP refers to the sense of conceit, pride and officiousness at an individual level (Farooq and Salam, 2020; Gouthier and Rhein, 2011). Although, OP has been discussed by many academicians in the domain of social sciences (e.g. Gibson, 2016; Grandey et al., 2018; Hau-siu Chow et al., 2006; Swenson, 1995; Wilson and Coomes, 2019), real estate industry (e.g. John, 2017, p. 33; John et al., 2019, 2017; Murrell and Sprinkle, 1993; Shahzadi et al., 2019) and airline industry (Farooq and Salam, 2020).\n\nHowever, still not plentiful is known about the prodigious association between OP and OI in the garments manufacturing industry (Farooq and Salam, 2020). As indicated previously, Glavas and Godwin (2013) have reported a significant relationship between the implementation of CSR at company level and OI at individual level. Taking a step forward, some other researchers (e.g. Farooq and Salam, 2020; John, 2017; John et al., 2019, 2017; Shahzadi et al., 2019) studied both (i.e. the OP and OI at individual level) concepts as potential outcomes of the implementation of CSR at company level. As stated earlier, John et al. (2017, p. 9) and Farooq and Salam (2020, p. 7) have suggested a positive connection between the implementation of CSR at company level, OI and OP at individual level. However, in other related studies Shahzadi et al. (2019, p. 8) and John et al. (2019, p. 787) have noted that OP at individual level mediates the relationship between the implementation of CSR at company level and OI at individual level. Therefore, aforementioned self-contradictory outcomes of the above-mentioned studies (e.g. Farooq and Salam, 2020; Glavas and Godwin, 2013; John, 2017; John et al., 2019, 2017; Shahzadi et al., 2019) warrant further comprehensive analysis for assessing the connection between the implementation of CSR at company level, OP and OI at individual level. Moreover, Glavas and Godwin (2013) have also argued that mere perception of goodness and goodwill is not enough for determining the phenomenal relation between the implementation of CSR, OP and OI. Therefore, an empirical study is required to evaluate the relation among CSR, OP and OI in the garments manufacturing industry. For this purpose, building on the aforementioned rational explanation this study submits that:\n\nH3a\n\nImplementation of CSR has a positive impact on OP\n\nH3b\n\nImplementation of CSR has a positive impact on OI\n\nFurther, EE is an intentional and deliberate self-driven behavioral outcome which requires rational thinking and positive attitude towards ones’ workplace (Farooq and Salam, 2020; Kim and Gatling, 2017; Nikolova et al., 2019, p. 777; Real de Oliveira and Ferreira, 2014; Rich et al., 2010, p. 634). According to Farooq (2016) social support also plays an important role in uplifting EE at workplace (Salam, 2018; Tiwari and Lenka, 2019; Tsourvakas and Yfantidou, 2018). Moreover, EE also has a substantial influence on DSIW, which inspires engaged employees to use their position in the organization to make an evocative contribution in their society (Christopher et al., 2017; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Roughton et al., 2019). If employees are fully engaged in their workplace they take pride and feel pleased to be identified with their employer (Chang et al., 2017; Farooq et al., 2018b); it ultimately means that they are taking the ownership of tasks assigned to them from their organization (Farooq and Salam, 2020; Roughton et al., 2019). Therefore, Henning and van de Ven (2017) have particularly stressed on the need of employees’ well-being, for overall better involvement and task performance at their workplace. Furthermore, according to van Zoonen and Treem (2019) and Baum (2017), OP and OI are also strong precursors of desire to get ahead and succeed in one’s professional life (Bagozzi et al., 2018; Farooq, 2018; Farooq and Salam, 2020; Goh et al., 2015; Knorr et al., 2011). However, DSIW is a very less explored aspect, and earlier studies on the notion of DSIW (e.g. Daly, 2018; John, 2017; John et al., 2019, 2017; Jun Hao, 2019; Morgeson et al., 2013; Pham and Paillé, 2019, p. 265; Shahzadi et al., 2019) have undermined the impact of EE in determining DSIW in the garments manufacturing industry (Farooq and Salam, 2020). In this background, this study proposes that resembling to the implementation of CPP at company level, EE, OP and OI can also influence employees’ behavior at workplace by enhancing DSIW in the garments manufacturing industry (Farooq and Salam, 2020). Therefore, further comprehensive studies are required to inform us about the influence of EE, OP and OI on DSIW in the garments manufacturing industry. Developing on the aforementioned rational opinions it is hypothesized that:\n\nH4\n\nEE has a positive impact on DSIW\n\nH5\n\nOP has a positive impact on DSIW\n\nH6\n\nOI has a positive impact on DSIW\n\nDrawing on John et al.’s (2019, 2017) earlier work a summarized view of the above-mentioned hypotheses is also depicted in the proposed model (see ) for assessing the role of the implementation of CPP, SQ and CSR in defining DSIW in the garments manufacturing industry. By stipulating the constructs of CPP and SQ along-with CSR in the proposed model, this study has combined the bifurcation between the implementation of CPP, SQ and CSR at company level for determining DSIW in the garments manufacturing industry.
