        "text": "Dozens of mental health videos produced by students from Orange County schools have earned regional honors in the Directing Change Program and Film Contest, and four have been selected to advance to a statewide round of judging.\n\nEstablished in 2013, the contest is part of Each Mind Matters: California’s Mental Health Movement and supports statewide efforts to prevent suicide, reduce the stigma and discrimination associated with mental illness, and promote the mental health and wellness of students.\n\nStudents were tasked with producing 60-second films about suicide prevention and mental health that will be used to support awareness, education and advocacy efforts.\n\n“Through the creation of these videos, students are able to learn about the mental health issues that they and their peers are facing,” said Dr. Lucy Vezzuto, OCDE’s coordinator of social-emotional learning and student mental health. “These students are making an important contribution to reducing the stigma of emotional health issues and encouraging others to ask for help.”\n\nIn its first six years, the Directing Change Program has received more than 7,200 films from 10,540 students representing over 400 middle schools, high schools, colleges and community based organizations, according to its website.\n\nA virtual awards ceremony is set to be held at 7 p.m. on May 19 at the following link: https://www.facebook.com/DirectingChangeCA/.
