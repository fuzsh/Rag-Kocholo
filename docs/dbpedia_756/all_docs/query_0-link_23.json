prioritizes human needs over planetary health. Despite global efforts to mitigate legacy pollutants, the continuous introduction of new substances remains a major threat to both people and the planet. In response, global initiatives are focusing on risk assessment and regulation of emerging contaminants, as demonstrated by the ongoing efforts to establish the UN’s Intergovernmental Science-Policy Panel on Chemicals, Waste, and Pollution Prevention. This review identifies the sources and impacts of emerging contaminants on planetary health, emphasizing the importance of adopting a One Health approach. Strategies for monitoring and addressing these pollutants are discussed, underscoring the need for robust and socially equitable environmental policies at both regional and international levels. Urgent actions are needed to transition toward sustainable pollution management practices to safeguard our planet for future generations.\n\nPublic summary\n\n•\n\nThe global economy stimulates the continuous production and release of new chemical and biological agents that challenge global health and sustainability.\n\n•\n\nIntegrating green and benign-by-design principles into production processes is crucial for eliminating hazardous materials from global supply chains.\n\n•\n\nEmerging environmental management practices are essential for environmental restoration and promoting global health and sustainability.\n\n•\n\nThis review explores the sources of emerging contaminants and their impact on planetary health, with an emphasis on source control and remediation strategies.\n\n•\n\nAdopting a One Health approach through interdisciplinary collaboration is essential for addressing emerging contaminants and their complex impacts.\n\nIntroduction\n\nBefore the Industrial Revolution, naturally occurring pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses, were the primary contaminants of concern, presenting threats to both human and ecosystem health.1 However, industrialization brought about significant changes in pollution patterns, introducing new contaminants into the environment such as heavy metals, industrial chemicals, and particulate matter. With the onset of the Anthropocene, humans have increasingly depleted natural resources and developed new chemical molecules, or novel entities, in pursuit of global development, resulting in waste streams transgressing planetary boundaries, disrupting natural ecosystems,2,3 and inducing changes in agricultural practices, which led to the evolution of wild-type pathogens.4 Various geogenic chemicals, encompassing metal(loid)s and other hazardous substances, are consistently discharged into the environment through diverse anthropogenic activities such as mining, mineral processing, energy production, construction, and agriculture.5\n\nBeyond geogenic chemicals, the production of synthetic chemicals has surged since the mid-twentieth century, marking what is often referred to as the second chemical revolution (i.e., unprecedented development and use of novel synthetic chemicals).6 This surge is shown by the rapid growth of the Chemical Abstract Service Registry, which grew from 20 million in 2002 to over 204 million by 2023, suggesting an addition of nearly 15,000 new chemicals daily.7 Moreover, there has been a significant rise in efforts to genetically modify microorganisms.8,9 While synthetic chemicals and genetically engineered microorganisms have contributed positively to human well-being by facilitating the development of new drugs and advanced materials and enhancing agricultural productivity, concerns have been raised over their risks to public health and the environment. Persson et al.10 recently highlighted that humanity has exceeded the planetary boundary, or safe operating space, for anthropogenic chemicals, as the rate of chemical production outpaces the rate of hazard assessments and the establishment of regulatory measures. Similarly, Bernhardt et al.11 argued that synthetic chemicals are agents of global change.\n\nEmerging contaminants (ECs), also referred to as contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), are newly identified synthetic or naturally occurring chemicals or biological agents that are detected in the environment and potentially hazardous or recently determined to be hazardous to humans and ecosystems. The risks associated with these contaminants are not fully understood. They may include pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), emerging pathogens, cyanotoxins and other natural toxins, pesticides, industrial chemicals, micro/nano plastics, nanomaterials, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), and other exogenous substances that are found in the environment but are not yet well understood in terms of their impacts on humans and natural ecosystems.12,13,14 These contaminants can enter the environment through various pathways, such as industrial discharge, agricultural runoff, and improper waste disposal, leading to air, water, soil, and food contamination. They can become part of complex mixtures of chemical pollutants and biological hazards.7 Furthermore, these ECs have the potential to undergo additional transformation and long-range transport, creating unforeseen and uncharacterized chemicals and causing chemical pollution in areas distant from the source.15\n\nPollution continues to pose a significant global threat, resulting in millions of premature deaths annually16,17 and widespread environmental degradation.5 Concurrently, thousands of species are facing extinction. These alarming challenges underscore the pressing need for comprehensive strategies to address the interconnected environmental and human health issues.18 Adopting a One Health perspective recognizes the interconnectedness of human health, animal health, and the environment, emphasizing the need for collaborative efforts to address EC issues. By leveraging expertise from various fields such as medicine, veterinary science, environmental science, and public health, integrated approaches will reduce risks linked to ECs and enhance the well-being of all organisms. In addition, it is timely to integrate an Indigenous world-view as the One Health concept is deeply embedded in their wider relationships with the environment. Indigenous people consider that all animate and inanimate, physical and metaphysical phenomena are connected through elaborate and complex webs of relationships.19 While focusing on ECs is crucial, dealing with existing legacy pollutants is equally important. Innovative approaches such as green chemistry, machine learning, and interdisciplinary cooperation are essential to overcome these challenges. Moreover, educational reforms are crucial to preparing future generations to effectively address environmental and health crises.20\n\nIn this review, we provide a holistic perspective on ECs, which are recognized as significant threats to human health and the sustainability of ecosystems. Through the One Health approach lens, we acknowledge the intricate connections among the health of people, animals, plants, and our shared environment. Our focus encompasses the production, utilization, and dissemination of ECs in everyday life, emphasizing their potential adverse effects, whether encountered individually or with other pollutants. These effects span various environments, affecting human health and the well-being of animals, plants, and microorganisms. We investigate methods for detecting and analyzing ECs, critically assess regulatory frameworks and policies, and propose innovative solutions to reduce their detrimental impacts on human and environmental health. By adopting the One Health approach, we underscore the necessity for a collaborative, multisectoral, and transdisciplinary response to effectively address challenges posed by ECs and to promote a sustainable and healthy future for all forms of life.\n\nHistorical perspective of ECs\n\nSince the mid-twentieth century, the global socio-economic landscape has undergone a profound transformation, marked by a surge in industrial activity and technological advancement. This period has seen a dramatic rise in the extraction and utilization of natural resources, particularly critical minerals and petrochemicals, which are indispensable for expanding industrial sectors and the broader modernization process. The repercussions of this intensified resource exploitation have been far reaching, leading to modifications in geochemical cycles and the distribution of metals.21 Moreover, this era has been characterized by the synthesis, use, and release of novel chemical compounds, many of which persist in the environment and have the potential to accumulate biologically, thus emerging as new environmental contaminants.22\n\nThe toxicity of metal(loid)s, such as lead, mercury, cadmium, arsenic, cobalt, and chromium, as well as organic pollutants such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), has long been recognized.5 Some of these pollutants have been banned or had limits imposed on their use due to their adverse environmental and health effects, prompting efforts to regulate their concentrations in water, soils, and other environmental media.23 Although much is understood about legacy contaminants, ongoing advances in analytical technology and toxicology continue to reveal new risks to human health and the environment posed by ECs, enabling a better understanding of the sources, persistence, bioaccumulation potential, mobility, and toxicity of such contaminants.\n\nThe increasing focus on environmental pollution has led to the identification of substances that have transitioned from being celebrated as beneficial chemicals to contaminants of significant concern. Examples of such evolving contaminants include plastics and their by-products, atrazine, triphenyl phosphate, tungsten, PFAS, chlorofluorocarbons, neonicotinoids, glyphosate, and many others ( ). This evolution is attributed to improved detection capabilities for inorganic and organic contaminants at trace levels and a better understanding of their wider ecosystem and health effects ( ).\n\nNowadays, significant attention has been devoted to addressing a wide array of ECs, which nowadays extends beyond newly introduced substances to include CECs, which have been present for some time but have recently garnered attention due to their potential impacts. As of February 2024, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Chemical Substance Inventory contains 86,741 potentially hazardous chemicals, with 42,293 currently commercially active.24 Additionally, as a network of reference laboratories, research centres and related organisations for monitoring of emerging environmental substances, the NORMAN has identified over 700 of the most discussed ECs.25 Further, Wang et al.1 identified that over 350,000 chemicals and chemical mixtures have been registered for commercial use around the world. The continuous expansion of these inventories is expected due to the ongoing discovery of new substances and increased scrutiny of existing ones. Herein, a One Health approach is particularly relevant to the assessment and management of ECs.26,27,28 In the subsequent sections, we will focus on prominent emerging contaminants categorized based on their current attention and potential concern ( ).\n\nProduction, use, and environmental release of ECs\n\nProduction and use of ECs\n\nOver the last century, global population growth, fueled by industrialization and urbanization, has spurred increased demand for consumer goods. Consequently, industries producing these goods, such as pharmaceuticals, household products, and plastics, have expanded significantly.50 The extensive use and improper disposal of these products have led to their omnipresence in the natural environment, causing continuous contamination with potentially harmful chemicals from diverse sources.51 Taking plastics as an example, their global production has surged to 460 million tons (Mt) in 2019 from 234 Mt in 2000, resulting in a doubling of plastic waste generation over the past two decades.52 This increase in plastic production and consumption has contributed to the proliferation of micro/nano-plastics in various ecosystems. While microplastics (MPs) only account for 12% of plastic waste in the natural environment, they are of significant concern because of their potential long-term impacts on ecosystems and organisms.52,53 Over time, larger plastic particles can break down into micro/nano-plastics through mechanical action and biological fragmentation (including microbial degradation and grind by metazoa during ingestion), leading to the continuous accumulation of these particles.54,55,56 This pollution is considered irreversible due to the lasting environmental impact long after the elimination of plastic emission sources.56\n\nPPCPs represent one of the largest groups of ECs, encompassing a wide array of compounds with diverse chemical and physical properties. These substances are commonly used in daily life for various purposes, including human and animal healthcare. With over 50,000 different types of PPCPs currently produced and approximately 30 million metric tons used globally, the prevalence of these compounds may be increasing annually.57 Pharmaceuticals as the main components of PPCPs include numerous types of drugs and their metabolites, such as antibiotics (for both humans and livestock), hormones, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anticancer drugs, antiepileptics, antidepressants, and β-blockers.58 Among these biologically active substances, antibiotics have emerged as the most commonly reported PPCPs over the past few decades,59,60 with the global consumption rate increasing from 9.8 to 14.3 defined daily doses per 1,000 population per day between 2000 and 2018.61 The increasing prevalence of associated ARGs is a well-documented health concern and is now recognized as a prominent global threat to public health.62 Besides pharmaceuticals, PPCPs also encompass various chemicals in body lotions, disinfectants, eye care, hair care, handwash, insect repellent, lipsticks, moisturizers, fragrances, shampoo, soaps, sunscreen creams, and plasticizers used in product packaging and lining63 and PFAS compounds added to cosmetics.64\n\nOver time, advancements in knowledge and analytical methods have led to the detection of risks associated with various chemicals. During the recent COVID-19 pandemic, 64.7% of respondents never disinfected their hands using sanitizers before the COVID-19 outbreak, but 91.0% disinfect their hands at least twice per day after the COVID-19 outbreak.65 Therefore, particular attention has been paid to biocides found in disinfectants.66 With the implementation of advanced analytical instruments such as high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, the potential risks posed by a broader range of PPCPs are expected to be uncovered PPCPs in the future. After production and application, PPCPs are primarily introduced to the environment directly or indirectly through the discharge of raw sewage or treated effluents of various quality from wastewater treatment, animal husbandry, animal manure, or municipal treatment plant sludge as fertilizer, and landfill leachate.67,68,69 In fact, the presence of PPCPs in surface water has become an indicator of an urbanizing water cycle.70\n\nEngineered nanoparticles (ENPs), one of the most typical ECs, were included in the list of ECs by EPA in 2010.71 ENPs such as carbon nanoparticles (NPs),72 TiO2 NPs,73 and hydroxyapatite74 are widely incorporated in a diverse range of consumable goods, including commercial cosmetics, sporting goods, sunscreen, and toothpaste. In terms of global production, SiO2 NPs and TiO2 NPs were the largest, followed by AlOx NPs, CeO2 NPs, FeOx NPs, and ZnO NPs, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (100–1,000 tons per year [t year−1] in 2010) and AgO NPs (55 t year−1 in 2010).75 The increasing application of ENPs in consumer products has caused their increased occurrence in the natural ecosystems.76\n\nPathways for environmental release of ECs\n\nTo better understand and address ECs and their harmful impacts, it is crucial to thoroughly analyze the characteristics of these substances, how they are released into the environment, and how they can affect living organisms. For example, a number of big research questions were identified by Boxall et al. to understand the risks of PPCPs in the environment, and, more recently, a synthesis of progress toward answering most of these questions was provided, within which a number of timely research needs remain unanswered.77 We can work toward a more sustainable approach by using innovative technologies to identify these contaminants, eliminate their sources, and apply green chemistry principles for designing safer chemicals.78 This comprehensive understanding of problematic substances and their pathways of exposure is essential for developing effective strategies.79,80 illustrates the release processes and potential pathways of emerging pollutants in different environmental compartments.\n\nIn both urban and rural areas, sources of ECs can be categorized as point source discharges from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), which include effluents from domestic, industrial, and hospital sectors and non-point sources such as stormwater runoff from agriculture (including livestock and aquaculture) and urban areas.81,82,83,84 Additionally, ECs may originate from household products and leachates from landfills, among other sources. Conventional WWTPs were not explicitly designed to remove ECs effectively. As a result, many contaminants have been reported in treated effluents at concentrations typically ranging from ng/L to μg/L.80,85,86 The continuous discharge of ECs in these effluents challenges existing global chemical management approaches that identify chemicals as persistent using cutoff values87 because effective exposure duration increases when introduction rates from sewage or effluent discharge exceed the rate of degradation.88 Efficient treatment of wastewater containing various chemical contaminants and pathogenic microorganisms remains a significant challenge in environmental engineering,89 particularly in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nFood production has significantly increased in recent years to meet the growing global demand. As a result, agricultural activities have become common contributors to releasing emerging pollutants into the environment.53,90,91 This is often linked to the discharge of agrochemicals,83 antibiotic residue from livestock wastes,91 microplastic debris resulting from the extensive use of plastic mulching film,53 and pathogens introduced through the application of livestock manure or WWTP biosolids as fertilizer.92 Without significant alterations to existing practices, new pollutants produced by intensive farming are expected to continue accumulating in soils, potentially polluting nearby water bodies through surface runoff and infiltration.83 Additionally, there is a risk for these pollutants to enter the atmosphere through agricultural spray drift or volatilization following pesticide application.93\n\nBeyond the discharge of effluents from WWTPs and agricultural activities, leachate from landfills, where household wastes are deposited, constitutes a significant source of emerging pollutants in terrestrial ecosystems ( ).79,94,95,96,97 PPCPs, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, and ARGs have been detected in untreated landfill leachate at concentrations ranging from ng/L to μg/L,95,98 with some concentrations surpassing proposed safe thresholds for the emergence of antibiotic resistance.99,100 When these potentially toxic leachates seep out or overflow into water bodies, they can adversely affect aquatic organisms.97 The construction industry is a significant environmental concern as it generates various contaminants, including construction and demolition waste, fly ash, plastic waste, and dust, during construction.101,102 These pollutants can potentially affect the living conditions of nearby residents and construction workers.103 However, the environmental fate of emerging pollutants associated with building sites remains largely unknown, and the application of new building materials that are being developed, such as engineered living materials,104 could also exacerbate this problem.\n\nParticulate contaminants, such as ultrafine particles, micro(nano)plastics, and ENPs, may be released into the atmosphere through processes including volatilization, aerosol formation, and diffusive exchange.105,106 These airborne pollutants could further be transported to surrounding or remote areas through dry or wet deposition or wind events.105,107 These particles could also carry other PPCPs and move to a remote area. Fernandez et al.108 found that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), PCBs, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers are present in remote high-mountain European lakes, indicating a long-range atmospheric movement of such pollutants from urban to remote areas with the help of aerosol particles. Meteorological factors, including temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and boundary-layer mixing, play vital roles in affecting the migration behavior of airborne pollutants.109 Atmospheric compartments, mainly consisting of outdoor and ambient air, atmospheric fallout, and suspended or street/road dust, have become the transport medium of airborne contaminants and a point source of emerging pollutants in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.107,110\n\nNPs can be formed by anthropogenic activities such as combustion in cooking, vehicles, thermal power plants, aircraft engines, chemical manufacturing, ore refining, smelting, and welding.111 There are three potential entry points for NPs into the environment over their lifespan: (1) during the manufacture of raw materials and nano-enabled goods, (2) during use, and (3) after disposal of items containing NPs (waste treatment).112 Life-cycle estimates indicate that the majority of NP emissions occur during the use stage and after disposal in landfills.113 However, emissions during manufacture account for less than 2% of the total output.114 ENPs may be released directly or indirectly into the environment via a built environmental system such as WWTPs or waste disposal facilities. As for direct ENP emission, ENPs can act as fertilizers to remediate soil, control the release of plant growth-regulating substances, detect pathogenic bacteria, and control plant diseases and pests. Potential secondary emissions may occur through various pathways, including the discharge from WWTPs, the utilization of biosolids as soil amendments, or leachates from landfill sites. These engineered systems play a pivotal role in dictating the destiny of ENPs, influencing whether they are discharged as effluent or incorporated into biosolids, and determining their state (whether they remain bare, coated, or undergo chemical or physical transformations).115 Sun et al.116 reported that, in the European Union in 2014, the sinks of TiO2 NPs, ZnO NPs, AgO NPs, and CNTs were mainly landfills (7,000 t year−1), sediments (7,600 t year−1), and soils (8,400 t year−1). The predominant emission pathway of TiO2 NPs and ZnO occurs via wastewater and ultimately accumulates in sewage. CNTs and AgO NPs are primarily discharged into the environment during their manufacturing and application processes, where they are subsequently deposited in landfill sites.\n\nAdditionally, concerns have been raised about the environmental and human health risks of emerging protein contaminants such as proteinaceous infectious particles (prions).117,118 Prions are misfolded forms (PrPSc) of normal cellular prion proteins (PrPC) that are capable of self-templating (thus their infectivity), and various prion strains can cause fatal neurodegenerative diseases in various hosts, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, and chronic wasting disease (CWD) in cervids. Take CWD prions as an example: once released into the environment, they can attach to soil particles, remaining as long-term sources of contamination.119 Subsequently, these prions may be absorbed by plants from the soil and then transferred to animals through the food chain. Consequently, the presence and spread of these prions in the environment are frequently linked to the movement patterns and breeding practices of infected animals.\n\nIn summary, ECs could, directly and indirectly, enter the environment from various sources, such as industrial and agricultural operations; mining and construction activities; oil and chemical leaks; diffuse sources such as stormwater drains, roads, and parking areas, and wastewater treatment systems ( )51,120; and the use of a wide range of consumer products. ECs in soil or landfills can also seep into adjacent groundwater.121,122 River networks and wind can transport these pollutants from residential, industrial, and agricultural areas to remote regions and eventually into marine environments.51 Understanding the environmental release processes and transformation pathways of ECs is pivotal for evaluating their potential ecological impacts and for developing efficient mitigation and remediation strategies.\n\nAdvances in the detection and analysis of ECs\n\nThe development of new analytical techniques and technologies has significantly enhanced the detection and analysis of ECs. This progress has bolstered our capability to extract, quantify, and detect ECs in environmental samples. Mass spectrometry (MS) and bioanalytical techniques have been particularly effective in analyzing emerging organic contaminants.123 Furthermore, electrochemical detection methods, with a focus on green technology, have emerged to measure ECs, especially pharmaceuticals.124 These innovations have played a crucial role in elucidating the sources, classification, fate, and transport of ECs and in the development of treatment technologies for their removal.125\n\nSampling and analytical methods\n\nAdvanced sampling and separation\n\nRecent global initiatives are reshaping the future of analytical chemistry, focusing on sustainable technologies. This impact is particularly evident in methodologies for sampling and sample preparation to detect and characterize ECs. Among these advancements is the solid-phase microextraction (SPME) chemical biopsy approach, which offers a flexible format for high-throughput quantification of ECs.126 Enhanced by matrix-compatible thin film coatings and balanced coverage phenomena, SPME effectively eliminates matrix effects and extracts a wide range of compounds with diverse physicochemical properties. It is effective not only with gas chromatography (GC)-MS and liquid chromatography (LC)-MS but also with direct MS coupling, showing versatility and effectiveness in analysis.127,128,129 Extraction techniques for ECs have evolved to enable on-site sampling using thin films, either through spot130 or time-weighted average sampling methods.131 In vivo sampling, employing a small-needle format, allows for the direct assessment of exposome effects in response to environmental pollution at the sampling site.132 These designed probes conduct non-exhaustive sampling over longer periods, accumulating sufficient analytes for sensitive detection via chromatography or MS. Additionally, a filter-incorporated needle-trap device facilitates the simultaneous determination of free and particle-bound pollutants in a single step when combined with SPME and measured directly with GC-MS. Portable GC-MS instruments enable gas sampling for on-site analysis.133 These advancements promise to enhance environmental protection efforts by generating large volumes of scientific data using simple, cost-effective, and sustainable analytical instrumentation. Moreover, these tools facilitate the untargeted characterization of samples, thereby aiding in the discovery of new compounds, including ECs.\n\nApart from mass spectrometric detection, chromatographic separation is also crucial in analyzing ECs. LC or GC is typically coupled to MS for analysis. However, very polar fractions are a problem for both. Being nonvolatile, they cannot be analyzed by GC or retained by the stationary phase of LC. Alternative chromatographic separation methods are being explored to close this gap. For example, a recent study combined supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) with HRMS to identify unknown disinfection by-products in drinking water.134 Hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) is also commonly employed in orthogonal analysis to analyze polar compounds. For example, HILIC-HRMS was applied in disinfected water analysis, leading to the identification of a new class of polar disinfection by-products (DBPs)—halomethanesulfonic acids.135,136 An alternative that has emerged in recent years is an extra separation dimension (i.e., ion mobility spectrometry [IMS]) hyphenated to the conventional GC- or LC-MS systems. IMS is a rapid gas-phase separation technique that separates ions based on their size, shape, and charge. IMS is particularly useful for the separation of isomeric analytes or coeluting matrix components. The collision cross section (CCS) values provided by IMS analysis supplement the common identification parameters such as retention time (RT) and mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) for the screening and structural elucidation of ECs. The inclusion of IMS in non-targeted analysis significantly improves confidence in the elucidation of unknown chemical structures. For instance, ion mobility-MS (IM-MS) has been used to analyze ECs in human urine samples.137 In another example, a non-targeted LC-IM-MS analysis of emerging PFAS in aqueous film-forming foams used CCS to enhance confidence in identifying unknown chemical structures and improve specificity in suspect screening.138\n\nAdvanced MS\n\nMS is among the most applied techniques for the analysis of ECs. HRMS instruments, such as time-of-flight (TOF) and Orbitrap mass spectrometers, offer high mass accuracy and resolution that are critical for identifying ECs through structural elucidation (see Table S1). More recently, HRMS has been applied in identifying transformation products and metabolites of ECs139 and in the non-targeted analysis/suspect screening of ECs.140 HRMS has revealed many new ECs in the environment and elucidated their transformation products and metabolites. Compared with other analytical techniques, the capability to conduct non-targeted analysis is an invaluable advantage of HRMS in ECs’ analysis. HRMS enables the integration of non-targeted analysis with bioassays and in chemico methods to identify bioactive and toxic chemicals in a sample. This combined approach enables the precise identification and broad capture of bioactive/toxic chemicals.141 For instance, an estrogen receptor α (Erα) protein affinity assay combined with HRMS has been applied to identify Erα-active compounds in source and drinking water samples from major rivers in China.142 In combination with effect-directed analyses, ultrahigh-resolution MS (i.e., Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance MS) was adopted to identify the toxicity drivers of unknown disinfection by-products in chlorinated and chloraminated drinking waters.143 In addition to in vitro bioassays, in chemico methods based on key chemical reactions (i.e., molecular initiating events) have also been applied to identify and measure the toxicities of environmental samples.144 The combination of in vitro and in chemico assays with non-targeted chemical analysis represents a novel, more effective approach to identifying the bioactive/toxic contaminants in our environment.145,146\n\nOther advanced analytical chemistry techniques\n\nNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is an advanced method for characterizing the chemistry of environmental samples.147 NMR has several advantages for the discovery of contaminants, potential transformation products, and characterizing the reactivity of contaminants over other techniques. The primary advantage is that structural elucidation can be performed without an authentic standard because the molecular profile from different NMR experiments can be used for complete structural elucidation. Another advantage is that NMR can leverage different nuclei to explore the structure of different metals and organic contaminants and their interactions with environmental and biological media. However, NMR is less sensitive than the previously described MS techniques, which can result in higher sample needs for characterization. NMR is also less accessible than other instruments, which has created a barrier in the broader application of this powerful and versatile technique for characterizing metals and contaminants and their impacts on both environmental and human health.\n\nElectron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) can be used to detect environmentally persistent free radical (EPFR) signals without the need to capture reagents, unlike common short-lived free radicals. However, the presence of particles or colloids associated with EPFRs, along with the co-existence of paramagnetic components such as transition metals in the matrices and varying environmental conditions such as humidity and temperature, can significantly interfere with EPR detection.147,148 The interference of components makes it impractical to separate them, as they likely contribute to the formation of EPFRs. Additionally, the diverse chemical structures of EPFRs pose a challenge to their identification. Researchers have categorized EPFR types based on g values and bandwidth, referring to them as oxygen centered and/or carbon centered. However, studies have shown that both parent chemicals and their degradation by-products contribute to EPFR formation, potentially playing simultaneous roles.149 The reactivity of EPFRs varies with their structures, yet attributing signals to specific structures or quantifying the contributions of different structures remains elusive.\n\nSuspected-target and non-target screening approaches\n\nThe number of anthropogenic chemicals has grown beyond our capacity to study them using traditional environmental monitoring approaches that rely upon the development of targeted analytical methods tailor-made to individual chemicals.150 This challenge drives the need to develop suspect and non-targeted screening (NTS) methodologies to identify ECs in complex environmental and biological media.141 The past three decades have witnessed the development of a wide range of HRMS instruments that are capable of resolving hundreds or even thousands of chemical compounds (M) by measuring the m/z of their corresponding (quasi)molecular ions (e.g., M·+, [M + H]+, and [M − H]−) with sub-part-per-million (<1 ppm) accuracy. The following sections provide a brief primer on the methodologies employed in the NTS of ECs.\n\nSuspect screening\n\nModern HRMS can gather both m/z and CCS data for numerous compounds within a sample. However, sorting through these data and differentiating between ECs and the matrix is akin to finding a needle in a haystack. Comparison of experimentally obtained mass spectra with those compiled in spectral libraries (e.g., the National Institute of Standards and Technology [NIST] Mass Spectral Library) has been a time-honored approach to identifying an unknown.151,152 One drawback of spectral library searching is the finite size of the library, which may not contain (bio)transformation products, by-products, or proprietary compounds whose authentic standards may not be readily available.153 Another challenge is the reproducibility of collision-induced dissociation spectra, which vary between laboratories depending on the instrument and experimental conditions. Suspected screening practitioners increasingly rely on structure databases (e.g., PubChem, CompTox Chemicals Dashboard),154 which are orders of magnitude larger than spectral libraries. Current suspect screening methods involve the creation of a list of structures whose computed/predicted properties are then compared with those obtained by experiment. However, the database’s structural form does not always match the chemical structure observed by HRMS.155 The experimental measurements are compiled using a peak-picking algorithm, the choice of which may influence the reliability and reproducibility of results.156 The analyst is also cautioned that no single instrumental method is capable of detecting all chemical compounds and that each step of the analysis could remove compounds present in the sample.157,158 This is particularly relevant when a large suspect list consists of compounds with a wide range of properties. For example, an instrumental method suitable for the analysis of anionic PFAS may not be appropriate for emerging brominated flame retardants. Black et al.157 have highlighted the urgent need to develop predictive methods to assess which compounds will be detectable using a given set of experimental and instrumental conditions. The identity of a compound cannot be confirmed by its mass alone. This is why in silico (i.e., computer modeling) methods are essential to predicting the dissociation of compounds on the suspect list, their chromatographic RT, and CCS to assist in differentiating similar compounds. The application of harmonized values, such as the unified retention time index (RTI), is also utilized in several wide screening workflows in Europe.159,160 With the help of RTIs, the number of false positives can be reduced in the first screening step from suspect screening and non-target screening workflows. Quantum chemical161 and machine-learning-based methods162 are capable of predicting ion ratios but at greater computational cost. Chromatographic RT163 and CCS164 can also be predicted using machine learning models.\n\nNontargeted screening\n\nA disadvantage of suspect screening is the fact that it requires prior knowledge of the occurrence of impurities and transformation products that are often unknown. Consequently, these compounds are absent from structure libraries, leaving the analyst with the unenviable task of answering the question, “What organic compounds are present in the environment that should not be there?” without knowing their structure(s) beforehand. Consequently, the analyst must identify the structures of the compounds detected in an NTS experiment using first-principles interpretation of their mass spectra. However, this is currently impractical for all compounds detected, which number in the thousands. Therefore, practitioners of NTS have developed a range of experimental and computational strategies to prioritize mass spectra for structure elucidation. Environmental risk assessment efforts have shown that >60% of compounds with the potential to persist in the environment and bioaccumulate contain the elements chlorine, bromine, or fluorine.165 Their mass spectra also display characteristics unique to the presence of halogens, and NTS strategies to identify ECs have largely focused on halogenated compounds.166,167,168,169,170,171 Emerging PFAS are more challenging to recognize since 19F is a single stable isotope. However, a previous study has shown that isotopic ratios (i.e., 13C/12C) can still be used to discover PFAS, which are characterized by having fewer carbon atoms than other non-fluorinated compounds with the same molecular weight.170 Recently, Zweigle et al.172 have exploited this characteristic to develop a novel approach to PFAS discovery that involves plotting the mass defect normalized to the number of carbons (MD/C) vs. mass normalized to the number of carbon atoms (m/C). Cl-, Br-, and F-containing compounds can also be revealed using ion mobility because halogenated compounds are characterized by relatively small CCS compared to their molecular weight.173,174 However, the most common approach to the discovery of unknown pollutants involves monitoring a fragment ion that is common to an entire class of pollutants. Machine learning is increasingly being used to guide NTS. Methods that predict a spectrum from a structure, such as competitive fragmentation modeling identification (CFM-ID)162 are becoming more mature. However, the reverse problem of predicting a structure from a spectrum has yet to be solved. Boiko et al.175 have recently reported on an automated tool that can assign elemental compositions in an unbiased, unconstrained way. It is anticipated that further growth in the areas of machine learning and AI will eventually enable true, unsupervised NTS.176\n\nAdvanced bioanalysis\n\nBioanalytical techniques\n\nWhile chemical analysis-based methodologies offer significant advantages, such as low detection limits, excellent accuracy, and good selectivity for monitoring ECs, the steady growth in the development of biosensors, also known as bioanalytical tools,177 for environmental analysis cannot be overlooked. This growth is largely attributable to their superior capabilities in rapid, specific analysis and real-time monitoring. Biosensors, which are analytical devices that combine a biological recognition element with a transducer,178 have been developed to detect various ECs. Detectable ECs include antibiotics,179 pesticides,180 bisphenol A,181,182 and microplastics.183 Biosensors effectively detect ECs in environmental samples184 as well as in foodstuffs and biological samples,185,186,187,188 particularly within an effects-directed analysis framework.189\n\nRecent advancements in biosensor technology have seen the introduction of novel biological recognition elements, such as aptamers, in sensor development. Aptamer-based biosensors, or aptasensors, have emerged as robust and powerful analytical tools for the detection of ECs. This is largely because of their high specificity for small molecules, low fabrication cost, design flexibility, and high stability. For example, specific aptamers have been developed to detect chloramphenicol in honey and enrofloxacin in sewage water.190,191 The possibility of incorporating advanced engineered nanomaterials, such as carbon-based nanomaterials, metal-organic frameworks, and noble metal NPs, into biosensor systems is being explored.192 With their good electrical conductivity, nanoscale size, and compatibility with biological molecules, these nanomaterials could significantly enhance biosensor performance. Indeed, nanomaterials have been found to increase biosensor sensitivities and lower the limit of detection by several orders of magnitude.193\n\nAdvanced analytical techniques for biological contaminants\n\nRecent advancements in the detection of biological ECs, such as pathogens, ARGs, and functional genes associated with the biosynthesis of cyanobacterial toxins, have been facilitated by high-throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and next-generation sequencing-based methods.194,195,196 A comprehensive study recently outlined the advantages and disadvantages of these methods, including classical cultivation-based techniques, for ARG detection.197 One of the significant benefits of sequencing methods is their ability to identify a wide range of pathogens or ARGs across diverse microorganisms present in samples.198 Despite their high-throughput nature, the sensitivity of these methods relies heavily on the effectiveness of the analysis pipelines.199 In recent years, computational tools have played a pivotal role in enhancing pathogen surveillance. Notably, the development of a comprehensive pathogen database has empowered the multiple bacterial pathogen detection (MBPD) pipeline to achieve holistic habitat surveillance and coinfections of pathogenic bacteria.200 Moreover, advancements in understanding the genomic signatures of pathogens through deep-learning approaches, such as DCiPatho, have enabled highly accurate identification of pathogens on a genomic scale.201 Despite the strides made in pathogen detection through sequencing methods, monitoring the environmental dissemination of high-risk ARGs, particularly originating from pathogen hosts, remains challenging and requires novel tools.\n\nThe analytical methods for cyanobacterial toxins include biological (mouse bioassay), biochemical (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, protein phosphatase inhibition assay), chemical (high-pressure liquid chromatography [HPLC];, LC-MS, high-performance capillary electrophoresis, thin-layer chromatography, and GC), and molecular biological (conventional PCR, qPCR, biosensor method).202 The chemical method is the most researched and well established and is by far the most commonly used.\n\nDistribution and fate of ECs\n\nEmerging organic contaminants\n\nTerrestrial ecosystems face numerous challenges arising from introducing and accumulating a range of potentially toxic organic substances ( ). Synthetic and naturally occurring emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) are widespread across diverse environmental settings. Despite often existing in low concentrations, these EOCs can exert significant and enduring effects, prompting extensive research into their distribution and fate in recent years. EOCs originate from various sources, including industrial waste, agricultural runoff, and household products. They can be categorized based on their chemical properties and sources, with subsequent subsections discussing some of the most prevalent types.\n\nPharmaceuticals and personal care products\n\nPPCPs represent substances utilized for personal health or cosmetic purposes that can find their way into the environment through multiple pathways, including excretion post consumption.203 Among PPCPs, pharmaceuticals, especially antibiotics, raise significant concerns due to their widespread use and potential environmental impact. Antibiotics, primarily administered orally for bacterial infection treatment in humans and animals, undergo enzyme-mediated metabolism before excretion, involving phase I and II processes.204 Phase I metabolism involves oxidation, reduction, and hydrolysis, transforming parent compounds into various metabolites, while phase II metabolism entails conjugation with molecules such as glucuronic acid or sulfate, further altering their chemical structure. Consequently, resulting metabolites may enter the environment at higher concentrations than their parent compounds due to these metabolic processes.205 Some pharmaceuticals resist biochemical transformation during metabolism and are excreted unchanged, entering the environment in multiple forms.206 Understanding these metabolic pathways is pivotal for identifying the diverse forms of pharmaceuticals in the environment and assessing their potential ecological and human health impacts.\n\nPharmaceuticals and other PPCPs enter the environment through various pathways, such as wastewater discharge from sewage treatment plants and animal farms, excretion from humans and animals, and improper disposal practices.206 Despite efforts in wastewater treatment, PPCPs are not effectively targeted for removal, often persisting due to treatment conditions.207 National surveys, such as one conducted in the United States, have shown that final effluents from WWTPs receiving discharges from PPCP manufacturers may contain concentrations of PPCPs 10–1,000 times higher than those typically found in WWTPs without such inputs.208 This trend was also observed globally, particularly for commonly used PPCPs such as antibiotics.206 Advanced analytical techniques have enabled the detection of PPCPs in sewage, groundwater, surface waters, drinking water, soil, and aquatic organisms across numerous countries, even at low concentrations.209,210,211 For instance, a comprehensive survey conducted in 2015 identified over 600 different pharmaceutical substances and their transformation products across more than 70 countries on all continents.212\n\nOnce in the environment, PPCPs undergo various processes determining their fate. Some PPCPs can degrade over time through microbial action, although the rate of biodegradation varies based on the compound’s chemical structure. PPCPs can also adsorb onto soil particles or sediment in water bodies, influencing their mobility and bioavailability. Aquatic organisms, such as fish, mollusks, and algae, can take up PPCPs from water through direct exposure or diet. It was evident that log Dow, rather than log KOW (n-octanol-water partition coefficient), is a better indicator of their bioaccumulation and trophic magnification for a marine food web.213 However, the apparent volume of distribution represents a promising proportionality constant to understanding the bioaccumulation of ionizable chemicals.214 Once in the water bodies, most PPCPs remain in the water phase because of their hydrophilic nature, such as sulfonamide antibiotics, whereas some hydrophobic ones (e.g., estrogens) might sorb to sediments or be accumulated by organisms.215 The presence of antibiotic residues in the environment might increase the risk of antibiotic resistance dissemination in environmental settings and consequently transfer to the human microbiome. Terrestrial organisms, including plants and insects, can also be exposed to PPCPs through the contaminated soil. Antibiotics are usually the most abundant PPCPs in plants originating from soils that were amended with biosolids and animal manure applications. For plants, hydrophobic compounds may partition into lipids and will be predominantly retained by roots, while most hydrophilic compounds will move to the xylem (in equilibrium with the water).216 Further studies are needed to understand the bioaccumulation of ionizable PPCPs in aquatic and terrestrial organisms.217\n\nCyanotoxins and other algae toxins\n\nRisks of toxins produced during harmful blooms of algae, cyanobacteria, and other organisms represent a classic One Health topic (www.cdc.gov/habs/ohhabs.html). Cyanobacterial blooms stimulated by multiple factors, such as global warming and eutrophication of water bodies, have led to a significant increase in the frequency, distribution range, intensity, and duration of cyanobacterial blooms, thus further exacerbating the risk of algal toxin poisoning.218,219 Cyanotoxins can be classified into three groups based on their chemical structure: cyclic peptide, alkaloid, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Depending on the mode of toxicity to animals, toxins can be classified as hepatotoxic cyclic peptide toxins (represented as microcystin and nodularin), neurotoxic alkaloidal toxins (anatoxin, saxitoxin), cytotoxic alkaloidal toxins (cylindrospermopsin), dermatologic toxicity of alkaloidal toxins (aplysiatoxin; lyngbyatoxin), irritant toxins (LPS), and some other biologically active substances.220 Globally, microcystin-LR is the most common cyanotoxin in freshwater, brackish water, and marine habitats.221 Lakes and reservoirs differ in morphology and trophic status, which can affect the dispersal and distribution of cyanotoxins.222 At the same time, cyanotoxins are subject to transport and diffusion at the sediment-water interface, with different types of sediments exhibiting different adsorption capacities.223 Notably, algae, cyanotoxins, and toxins present in a variety of freshwater, marine, soil, and terrestrial species can be wind driven to float in the air and transported over greater distances.224 Moreover, cyanotoxins in the atmosphere may, under certain conditions, settle on the ground or in water bodies and affect the surrounding environments.225 The accumulation of cyanotoxins involves a complex process of gradual accumulation and transfer in ecosystems. The process can be manifested primarily through the cascading of cyanotoxins through the food chain and their progressive enrichment in organisms. For example, fish and shellfish, organisms that consume food rich in cyanobacterial toxins, accumulate the toxin in their tissues, resulting in a gradual buildup of cyanotoxins in the upper levels of the food chain.226\n\nEmerging inorganic contaminants\n\nEngineered nanoparticles\n\nENPs that accumulate in the environment will undergo a series of physical, chemical, and biological processes such as chemical transformation, aggregation, and dissolution. The interplay between these processes and the ENP transport ultimately determines the potential fate of ENPs.227 The chemical transformation process mainly includes the dissolution and sulfidation of ENPs. In a series of studies, it has been found that the dissolution of NPs is triggered by particle-inherent factors (e.g., surface coating, particle size, shape, and aggregation state) and environmental parameters such as solution pH, dissolved organic carbon, and temperature.228 Thereinto, the most commonly occurring passivation process, that is, the sulfidation of NPs, makes their surface appear to be almost inert, thus affecting the reactivity.\n\nThe colloidal stability of ENPs is a crucial factor that influences their fate and environmental effects.229 The homo-aggregation (interactions between the same ENPs) of NPs is positively correlated with the NP concentrations. The aggregation characteristics are often explained by the classical Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory. Owing to the low predicted ambient concentrations of ENPs (e.g., in the range of pg/L to low μg/L for surface water), homo-aggregation is less likely to happen and is affected by ionic strength. The aggregation rate of NPs increases with the surrounding medium’s ionic strength, and multivalent cations are more efficient than monovalent cations.230,231 However, heteroaggregation of ENPs with mineral particles is more common in natural environments,232 which ultimately affects the environmental fate of ENPs and their risk to ecosystems and organisms.233 The majority of the studies on ENP transport in porous media used water-saturated artificial columns often packed with quartz sand, while only a few involved natural soils.234 Key environmental factors controlling ENP transport processes are solution ionic composition, pH, and natural organic matter (NOM) chemistry, while the degree of water saturation in porous media such as soils is an additional physical factor. The impact of ionic composition, NOM, and solution pH on the NP fate is similar in aquatic systems and saturated and unsaturated porous media. For plants, an increasing number of studies related these factors to plant uptake. For instance, size-exclusion limits that range from <10 nm to the uptake of cells exceeding 20 nm for the uptake of leaves and can reach 100 nm in exceptional cases.235,236,237 Assimilation of elements from larger particles is possible if they dissolve, while low zeta potentials usually favor direct particle uptake.\n\nRadionuclides and nuclear wastes\n\nWhether released from nuclear power plants, medical facilities, or sites where radioactive material was improperly disposed of, radionuclides pose considerable challenges to environmental quality and human well-being.238 Radionuclides undergo radioactive decay, emitting radiation over time.238 Nuclear wastes threaten ecosystem health. Strict regulations govern the handling and disposal of nuclear waste to prevent environmental contamination.239,240 Consideration should extend beyond physical and chemical interactions to encompass biological uptake and long-term ecological consequences of radionuclides and nuclear waste.\n\nBiological contaminants\n\nPathogenic bacteria\n\nThe intricate interplay between pathogenic bacteria and various environmental sources, particularly in agricultural settings, underscores the complexity of this challenge.241,242 Agricultural soils are often underestimated as reservoirs of human and animal pathogens and can give rise to a spectrum of diseases affecting air, water, and food.243 For example, bacterial species such as Bacillus anthracis, Vibrio cholera, and Burkholderia pseudomallei have the potential to cause severe infection and, in some cases, death through direct contact.244,245 Foodborne pathogens such as Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enterica can also enter the food chain, triggering epidemics with severe health consequences.246,247\n\nAntibiotic-resistant bacteria and resistance genes\n\nAntibiotics and antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARBs) carrying ARGs have existed for hundreds of thousands of years before the discovery of antibiotics by humans.248,249 However, the industrialization and widespread use of antibiotics in both human and animal populations have exerted unprecedented selective pressure on bacteria across various interconnected niches, including human, animal, and environmental microbiomes. This has led to the accelerated development of antibiotic resistance traits within these communities on a global scale.250,251 Thus, anthropogenic activities could increase the emergence of ARBs, their resistance genes, and their dissemination between the human, animal, and environmental compartments, aggravating the existing antibiotic resistance crisis.252 For example, the extensive use of antibiotics and the intensive agricultural practices prevalent in modern farming have transformed soil ecosystems into potential reservoirs of pathogens and ARGs.253 Within this soil environment, the biopollutome emerges as a complex network of pathogens and ARGs, creating a prevalent threat to ecosystems.254 Although multiple barriers restrict the flow of both bacteria and genes, pathogens recurrently acquire new resistance factors from other species, thereby reducing our ability to prevent and treat bacterial infections,62 which demands urgent and effective measures to control the formation and dissemination of ARB.\n\nAntibiotic resistance has been referred to as a silent pandemic and has emerged as a significant concern in the realm of biological ECs.255 Hence, the increasing number of antibiotic-resistant microbes poses threats to human health. Over the last decade, ARGs have been detected in all habitats, including the natural environment and human industrial habitats.256 Anthropogenic activities play a key role in selecting genes from environmental and cellular sources, facilitating their subsequent co-option to confer antibiotic resistance. With increasing human activities, microorganisms and their genetic material move more often between humans, animals, and the environment, which collectively increases opportunities for the transmission and evolution of ARGs.256,257,258 Once these drug-resistant genes are transferred to human-associated pathogenic bacteria, such as Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species (ESKAPE) pathogens and plant pathogens, it may further exacerbate the clinical pathogenic risks.259 These pathogens are not only present in the bodies of humans and animals but can also enter the water through excretions such as feces, urine, and saliva and spread through respiratory secretions into the air. The threat posed by pathogenic bacteria also presents a significant challenge within the One Health framework.252 Over the past two decades, infectious diseases have been accountable for approximately 15 million global deaths annually.260 Meanwhile, plant diseases contribute to the loss of up to 30% of global food production each year.261\n\nARB and ARGs originating from human activities are recognized as emerging biological contaminants that can potentially affect environmental ecosystems.262,263 Apart from antibiotics, a range of non-antibiotic pollutants such as heavy metals, disinfectants, biocides, and non-antibiotic drugs can alter bacterial behavior and contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance.264,265,266,267,268 Furthermore, ARB and ARGs can disseminate back to the human and animal microbiomes269 through food ingestion, drinking water, and direct contact while swimming in contaminated water and while in contact with contaminated crops, thus creating a loop between the human, animal, and environmental microbiomes. Nevertheless, future research should provide quantitative information about the dissemination routes of ARB and ARGs from the environment to the human microbiome by considering human exposure and the probability of successful colonization of the human microbiome by these biological pollutants. There is an urgent need to move from descriptive, qualitative, or semi-quantitative research to quantitative risk assessments of the drivers of antibiotic resistance proliferation in the environment and its dissemination to the human microbiome.270\n\nViruses\n\nAmong microorganisms, viruses are most prone to becoming emerging pathogens because they can infect their hosts and adapt to new environments through mutation, genetic recombination, and reassortment.271 The pathogenicity of many bacteria is due to the virulence factors they carry encoded by lysogenic phages.272 Soil plays a significant role in the distribution and transmission of viruses in natural environments.273 Research indicates that viruses can survive in soil for varying durations depending on factors such as temperature, moisture content, pH, and the presence of an envelope. Enveloped viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can survive for up to 90 days in soils with 10% moisture content.274 Additionally, enteric viruses can persist on surfaces such as door handles, banisters, and food, contributing to their transmission.244 The abundance of viruses in soil is higher in environments with high organic matter and moisture content.274 Changes in soil moisture levels can affect the composition and activity of soil DNA and RNA viruses, potentially affecting soil ecology.275 Understanding how viruses interact with soil is crucial for assessing their environmental impact and potential transmission pathways. Because the size of the host is tens to thousands of times larger than the size of the virus, viruses are more flexible than bacteria in terms of transport and dispersal by animals, wind, or rain.276 Influenza viruses,277 hepatitis A viruses, coronaviruses,251,278 and others, can survive in the soil for a long time, leading to human exposure.\n\nProtein contaminants\n\nPrions and Bt proteins are considered two important classes of emerging protein contaminants. Prion proteins can bind to soils and suspend in water, thus persisting in the environment for years and serving as a significant environmental reservoir for disease propagation.44,45,46,47 Our understanding of the fate and transport of prion proteins in the environment is very limited. Using sand or soil columns, previous studies found that recPrP and purified PrPSc had limited mobility, where the migration of recPrP was smaller than 1 cm in the quartz sand column and purified recPrP was primarily retained near the point of contamination in soil columns.279,280 Bt proteins were found to persist in soils for 2 months, 180 days, and up to 234 days, respectively, and were found to have the potential to be transported through the landscape by sediments and crop residue debris in surface runoff.281,282,283 Nonetheless, significant knowledge gaps remain in understanding the fate, transport, and environmental risks of protein contaminants (e.g., prions and Bt proteins).\n\nMicroplastics and nanoplastics\n\nAs one of the world’s most prominent emerging pollutants, microplastics are ubiquitously distributed across the atmosphere, pedosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. Micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) could be widely detected in the terrestrial ecosystem and human body.284 Microplastic fragmentation by rotifers in aquatic ecosystems has been reported to contribute to global nanoplastic pollution.55 Plastic particles enter the environment from ubiquitous sources, posing a potential threat to aquatic organisms, soil, the atmosphere, and human health.285,286 Atmospheric microplastics are found in both indoor and outdoor air. Indoors, concentrations in residential homes can be as high as 1.96 ×104 particles m−2 day−1), while in schools, they can be as low as 6.20 ×103 particles m−2 day−1), and in dormitories (9.9 ×103 particles m−2 day−1)) they are 5.5 times higher than in offices (1.8 ×103 particles m−2 day−1)). The abundance of MPs in outdoor air showed regional differences, with higher abundance of MPs in urban air than in rural air, and higher levels of MPs in cities in northern China than in southern cities.287 Some studies have shown that atmospheric deposition of MPs ranges from 0.5 to 1,357 MP m−2 day−1 (outdoors) and 475 to 19,600 MP m−2 day−1 (indoors). During deposition, microplastics can utilize plant stomata (20–40 μm long and 5–10 μm wide), with 20–200 nm of microplastics accumulating in the stomatal lumen and passing through the stomata into leaf tissue. Research has validated the capability of polystyrene (PS) nanoplastics to infiltrate leaves and migrate to plant roots, demonstrating their ability to penetrate plant leaves through foliar exposure.288 Within the phloem, nanoplastics can travel alongside bulk water or sap, a process influenced by sap’s composition and flow rate within the stem. Furthermore, the downward movement of nanoplastics within vascular tissues requires traversal through various physiological barriers, including intercellular plasmodesmata, vesicles, and conductive cells.289 Consequently, the continuous aggregation of nanoplastics could potentially obstruct the vascular system, impeding the downward translocation of smaller nanoplastics.289 The average abundance of microplastics in fish in the oceans was 3.5 ± 0.8 particles/stripe, but, in highly polluted waters, in contrast, oysters had the highest abundance of 99.9 particles/individual.290\n\nMNPs accumulate in many organisms in the environment, which leads to food chain pollution affecting the life and health of all organisms in the food chain. MNPs are not easy to degrade after being ingested by animals so they accumulate continuously in the body. For example, research demonstrated that mice administered 0.2- to ∼0.3-μm PS particles at a concentration of 250 µg.μL−1 via gavage exhibited absorption of plastic particles into various organs including the blood, liver, brain, spleen, testis, bladder, and others through the intestinal tract, leading to multi-organ toxicity.291 MNPs can be detected in human feces, which indicates that the intake of MNPs is high.292 After MNPs enter the gastrointestinal tract through food, the undigested MNPs are excreted with feces, but smaller MNPs will enter the systemic circulation. Some studies have found that there are MNPs in human blood, so MNPs may be transported to various organs through blood, but the mechanism of MNPs entering the blood circulation is still unclear and needs further study.293 The maximum particle diameter of MNPs taken up by organisms is determined by the morphology of species' feeding and digestive organs.294 MNPs mainly enter the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts and can then be transferred to other secondary organs according to their size and shape.\n\nLiquid crystal monomers\n\nLiquid crystal monomers (LCMs) are a class of synthesized organic chemicals that are key materials for liquid crystal displays (LCDs), which can undergo phase transitions between liquid and solid states at specific temperatures. LCMs are typically diphenyl-based compounds that contain functional groups such as cyano, fluorine, chlorine, or bromine.295 The production output of LCMs for LCD panels is approximately 500 t year−1.296 However, the environmental release of LCMs during the use and dismantling of waste LCDs is a concern, and global estimates range from 1.07 to 107 kg/year.297 Numerous studies have indicated the widespread presence of LCMs in the environment, and projections suggest a significant increase in their prevalence in the near future.49 These LCMs exhibit environmental persistence, long-range migratory capabilities, and potentially harmful impacts on various species.298 Consequently, LCMs have gained attention as ECs because of their distinctive properties, including persistence, bioaccumulation, toxicity, and extensive environmental distribution.297\n\nLCMs have been found in various environmental matrices, indicating their widespread distribution and potential exposure risk to organisms. Air is considered a significant transport medium for LCMs, allowing their migration from e-waste recycling sites to the surrounding environment. Investigations into waste LCD panel dismantling revealed atmospheric concentrations of LCMs at 68,800–385,000 pg/m3.299 LCMs have also been observed in indoor and outdoor dust, sediment, landfill leachate, sewage sludge, and soil samples. LCMs median levels in dust collected across China ranged from 41.6 to 171 ng/g,300 depending on the sampling region. LCM concentrations in urban soils from different functional zones ranged from 0.774 to 12.9 ng/g dry "
