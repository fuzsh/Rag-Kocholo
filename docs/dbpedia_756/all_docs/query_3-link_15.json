        "text": "Private university in Seoul, South Korea\n\nChung-Ang University (CAU; Korean: 중앙대학교; Hanja: 中央大學校; RR: Jungang Daehakgyo) is one of the top leading private research universities in Seoul, South Korea.[1] The university operates two campuses: main campus located in Dongjak District, Seoul, and an additional campus in Anseong, Gyeonggi Province. CAU consists of 16 undergraduate colleges and 16 graduate schools.\n\nStarting as a church-run kindergarten in 1916,[2] CAU transformed into a school for female kindergarten teachers in 1922[3] and was granted university status in 1953.[4] The university held its centennial in 2018. It has 33,600 undergraduates, 5,200 graduates, 700 professors, and 500 more part-time teaching staff.[5] The symbol of Chung-Ang University is Blue Dragon. It represents the sacredness, authority, freedom, and the eternal prosperity of CAU.[6]\n\nChung-Ang University began with the establishment of Chung-Ang Kindergarten as an annex to the Chung-Ang Methodist Church located in Insa-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul, in April 1918.\n\nChung-Ang Kindergarten originated as a branch of Jungdong Church in 1916 and separated in 1918.\n\nIn 1922, the Japanese enacted legislation against kindergartens to restrict expansion, however, other kindergartens including Susong, Kyungsung, and Taewha, and kindergartens in Gaesung and Pyongyang were founded by 1924.\n\nThe social conventions in the 1920s made it difficult to recruit female students but a Teacher Training Program was established and kindergarten teachers were educated, which can be seen as a development in the modern history of teaching in Korea. Undeterred by the hostile conditions, graduates were posted to kindergartens in cities including Hamhung, Hweryung, Busan, Masan, Jeonju, Anak, Cheonan, Sariwon, and Miryang. Thus, the Chung-Ang Kindergarten Teacher Training Program took on the role of a Professional Educational Institution.\n\nBy 1922, the Chung-Ang Teacher Training Program, in partnership with the Community Education Movement of various Japanese-Resistance organizations, was promoted to a Kindergarten Teacher Training School. Although its legal status was registered as a miscellaneous school, its standing in social perception was considered equivalent to that of a professional school with a 3-year degree course.\n\nThe reformed Chung-Ang Teacher Training School continued to face obstacles in management. With ten students, the school was forced to relocate to a private residence in 1932 due to financial and personal circumstances of the management.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1933, Louise Yim (Im Young-Shin) took over the helm and was appointed as the principal at the age of 34. She was a graduate of Kijeon School for Women and was previously imprisoned for 6 months for leading the Samil Independence Movement at Jeonju. She later graduated from Kwangdoo High School in Japan and was further awarded her M.A in the United States. She infamously sent pictures of the Japanese massacring Koreans during the Gwandong earthquake to Dr. Syngman Rhee, who was operating the Korean Independence Movement in the US.\n\nAfter nine years in U.S., she returned to Korea in January 1932 and was determined to devote herself to the nation, which was still under Japanese rule. As she toured the country for her first role as the director of the YWCA, she realized that she needed to start with education to save the people.\n\nHer savings of 30,000 dollars earned from farming, truck driving, and vegetable wholesale operation in U.S. was used to purchase a site at Heukseok-dong on which to build a school and took leadership of Chung-Ang Teacher Training School. Through Yim, Chung-Ang began to envisage its development as the cradle of national education.\n\nDespite its relocation to Heukseok-dong, Chung-Ang Teacher Training School lacked facilities. So Yim rented Pearson Bible School to hold classes. However, there was a limit to Yim's personal finances and with the Japanese prohibiting contributions, the development of the School continued to face financial difficulties.\n\nBelieving that the only solution was to raise funds from U.S., Dr. Yim worked to promote donations in the U.S. As a result, she was able to return home having established the Pfeiffer Foundation in U.S. to financially support Chung-Ang Teacher Training School.\n\nWith this, the first stone building was erected on the grounds of Heukseok-dong in April 1937, to become Young-Shin Hall upon its completion in May 1938, which forms the heart of Chung-Ang today.\n\nStudents subsequently founded Chosun Kindergarten Education Society and took charge of the social education plan through concerts, plays, and literary activities.\n\nIn 1937, the Japanese waged war against China, and in 1941 attacked Pearl Harbor, signalling the start of the Pacific War with the U.S. declaring war against Japan. Chung-Ang Teacher Training School was heavily targeted in view of the fact that Yim was educated in U.S. and a devout Christian.\n\nThe Communications Unit of the Japanese Army attempted to take possession of the school, but their efforts were blocked by the strong resistance of Yim. By the end of WW2, under pressure from the Japanese forces, the school was no longer able to admit new students, and the school was closed in 1944.[citation needed]\n\nAs Japan was defeated and Korea liberated, Dr. Yim reopened the doors to Chung-Ang Teacher Training School on 28 September 1945, and established the school motto, \"Live in Truth, Live for Justice\".\n\nOn 1 October of the same year, Chung-Ang Teacher Training School was re-organised under the name of Chung-Ang Professional School for Women and followed by the Admissions Ceremony. The Foundation, Chung-Ang Culture Institute, was established in November 1946, and its legal registration was completed by the following year.\n\nIn April 1947, the school was again reorganised into Chung-Ang College for Women, and then to Chung-Ang College in May 1948, establishing itself as a co-educational institution.\n\nWhilst Dr. Yim served as a national diplomat in the United Nations, obtaining their endorsement to build a new Korea, she also continued her efforts in developing the school and was appointed dean and chairman of the board.\n\nAlthough the college celebrated its first conferment of a bachelor's degree in May 1950, it was again indefinitely closed due to the outbreak of the June 25 Korean War. Students were re-admitted subsequent to the September 28 reclaim of the Country, but soon the school had to flee to Busan and set up a temporary office there in the event of January 4 Retreat of Korea's allied forces.\n\nUpon Dr. Yim's return to the country in April 1951 after completing her diplomatic duties in U.S., the school started to give lectures in Song-do, Busan. Later, it installed branch campuses and lectures in Iri and Seoul.\n\nChung-Ang College continued to provide education during the war times. As a result, the second, third, and fourth bachelor's degree Conferment were held during the war years in Busan, in 1951, 1952, and 1953.\n\nThe school continued to provide education during the evacuation to Busan and was recognised as a comprehensive university in February 1953. Thus, with nine departments under four component faculties including the College of Liberal Arts & Science, College of Law, College of Business, and College of Pharmacy, and a Graduate School, Dr. Yim was appointed as chancellor of the university.\n\nThe teaching faculty returned from Busan to its original site in Heukseok-dong, Seoul, in August, following the declaration of ceasefire in the Korean War in July of the same year. However, lectures had to be taught in temporary buildings as the site was still occupied by the U.S. Army. The site was eventually recovered after one semester in April 1954, and the area reorganised for the development of the university.\n\nThe university continued to expand to the scale of 19 departments under four faculties, and a population of 2,850, between 1955 and 1959. To accommodate the increase in departments and students, a four-storey building, Pfeiffer Hall, was constructed across approximately 2,500 pyeong (1 pyeong =3.1m2) in 1956, and Chung-Ang Library constructed across approximately 3,800 pyeong in 1959.\n\nConcurrently, International Culture Research Institute was established to enhance research activities.\n\nPartnerships were forged with Young-Shin Junior High School, Young-Shin Girls' Junior High School, Nakyang Junior High School, Nakyang Technical High School.\n\n1960 saw the 4.19 Revolution, where the CAU students educated under the motto of \"Truth and Justice\" protested against the March 1960 Rigged Elections. Furthermore, despite the many challenges faced with the control policy affecting student-intake for the alleged qualitative improvement of universities, which was introduced in the wake of the 5.16 Military Coup in 1961, CAU was able to appoint Dr. Sung-Hee Yim as its second chancellor on 2 October 1961. Later Yim was re-appointed as the third chancellor, she was able to continue ensuring the internal stability of the university.\n\nIn January 1965, the College of Liberal Arts & Science was segregated into the College of Liberal Arts, College of Science & Engineering and College of Education, whilst the College of Law, College of Business, and College of Pharmacy were combined to form six colleges. Furthermore, the partnered Middle School and High School were renamed in affiliation with the College of Education, and an affiliate Elementary School was newly established under the Foundation, allowing the delivery of a coherent educational philosophy from kindergarten to graduate school.\n\nIn February 1967, the Graduate School of Social Development was established to train specialists and promote industrial links. In 1968, the university was again reorganised into the eight component faculties, including College of Liberal Art, College of Science & Engineering, College of Education, College of Law, College of Political Science & Economics, College of Business Administration, College of Agriculture, and College of Pharmacy, for the systemization of education impacting the affiliate organisations. The College of Medicine was installed in December 1971, and Sung Shim Hospital, based in Jung-gu, Seoul, was incorporated as an affiliate hospital.\n\nJuly 1961 saw the construction of Jin Sun Hall across approximately 1,400 pyeong, and the University Theatre across 1,920 pyeong. In October of the same year, the Social Development Hall was constructed across 1,600 pyeong. The Archives were reorganised to mark the 50th anniversary in 1968. The Blue Dragon Monument was erected to safe-guard artefacts and documents for the next 100 years, and Seungdang Hall built. Bobst Hall, covering 3,200 pyeong, was built the following year, December 1969. The Sung Shim Hospital of 1,395 pyeong was affiliated.\n\nBy this time, the founder of CAU, Yim was over 70 years old and finding the workload physically gruelling. Thus, she charged Dr. Chull Soon Yim to succeed her as the fourth chancellor of CAU.\n\nThe College of Liberal Arts and College of Science & Engineering were restructured into the College of Liberal Arts & Science and College of Engineering in 1972. In the field of art, CAU merged with Seorabol Art College, which was operated by the Seorabol Art Institute, in June 1972, and further reorganised the establishment under the College of Arts in 1974. Two affiliate schools were constructed in 1978, and the Graduate School of International Management and Graduate School of Education installed in January 1979.\n\nJin Sun Hall was extended in October 1972 for construction of 3,100 pyeong of Seorabol Hall, and 2,400 pyeong devoted to the construction of Natural Hall as part of the College of Medicine in 1974. The Students' Union Building was constructed in December 1976 over 2,000 pyeong, and in June 1978, a new annex provided over 1,450 pyeong for the affiliate Sung Shim Hospital, based in Pil-dong, Jung-gu, Seoul.\n\nIn February 1977 Yim, the founder of CAU, died.\n\nIn March 1980, lecture halls, dormitories and a Students' Union were built across 2,417 pyeong, 1,706 pyeong, and 597 pyeong of land respectively in Anseong-si, Gyeonggi-do, to create the Anseong Campus.\n\nFollowing the end of his term as chancellor, Dr. Chull Soon Yim was succeeded by the professor of philosophy, Dr. Suk-Hee Lee, as the fifth chancellor in May 1980.\n\nThe Graduate School of Journalism was established in November 1980 to train professional journalists, and Heukseok-dong equipped with education facilities accordingly. In December, a 0.9-acre annex was built for the affiliate hospital to improve the education environment for the College of Medicine.\n\nImprovements to facilities happened at the Seoul and the Anseong campuses.\n\nIn October 1981, faculties in Anseong were reorganised under the College of Foreign Languages, College of Social Science, and College of Home Economics. Seoul and Anseong sites were listed as the university's primary and secondary campus, respectively. The Department of Music was segregated from the College of Arts and newly established as the College of Music in October 1981. The College of Agriculture was reorganised as the College of Industrial Science. The Graduate School of Construction Engineering was added to the roster of faculties in September 1983. After the establishment of the College of Construction Engineering in the secondary campus in Ansung in October 1984, the secondary campus had seven colleges.\n\nIn November 1982, the Professor Research Center was built over 636 pyeong, and 626 pyeong was spared for the College of Agriculture experiment area. In December, the building for the College of Arts was built over 4,874 pyeong. Continuing the investments, 1,192 pyeong for the Music College lecture area, 714 pyeong for the assembly area, and 423 pyeong for the swimming pool was established in August 1983. In September, the Gymnasium was finished over 655 pyeong. In December 1984, the 1,145 pyeong building was erected for the College of Music; finally, 5,068 pyeong was given for the third faculty residence. By the end, the campus had a modern look.\n\nDr. Byoung Jip Moon succeeded to Dr. Suk Hee Lee as the sixth president in March 1985. Moon began to reorganize the management operating system. The Office of Career Planning was established. The management of the Chung-Ang Cultural Institute and the Medical Center were modified. The departments of French Language & Literature and Japanese Language & Literature were reinstalled, and the Department of Industrial Information created. The construction of a Central Library in the second campus was promoted.\n\nDr. Bum Hoon Park was inaugurated as the 12th university president in February 2005. As his first assignment upon election, he oversaw the evaluation of the Korean Council for University Education, marketing of capital, BK21, establishment of the Professional Graduate School of Law, and other national enterprises.\n\nRestructuring of the Education Science Technology Faculty, which had been the greatest pending issue, was so successful it was nominated a leading university and awarded grant maintenance (KRW 9,100,000,000) comparable to that of major competitor universities, in spite of its 1-year probationary period.\n\nFollowing the restructuring of the undergraduate programmes, recruiting of new admissions, registration of current students, financial situation and overall management records of the three professional schools and 11 specialised schools, were analysed to identify the areas for improvement and enhance teaching quality. Thus, 32 out of 42 staff from the professional schools and specialized schools were reassigned to the general graduate school, and 10 positions reduced. The members reassigned to the general graduate school have been resourced to serve as the primary models in forming the Research Priority Group (Staff), for the construction of a research-centred regime.\n\nDRAGON 2018 (2001–2004), which was the development plan devised under the 11th university president to carry the university towards the university target vision by the Centenary Anniversary, was re-branded as CAU2018+ (2005–2008). CAU2018+ lists the valuation index for various industries and the source of expected revenue in detail. To accomplish the goals, CAU2018+ was implemented in two stages.\n\nFor the first four years of Dr. Bum Hoon Park's term in office, resources were heavily invested in education/research equipment. Thus, the nation's largest Law Hall was constructed in February 2007, and a master plan drawn up for the construction of the Pharmacy and Natural Science R&D Centers around the Main Entrance in Campus 1, and an Engineering R&D Center by the Gymnasium,\n\nIn 2008, the Media Practice Section was established in the Law Hall and 400 additional wards were added in the affiliate hospital. Accordingly, the Chung-Ang Site Construction Plan, included in the CAU2018+ Development Plan was set in motion.\n\nIn November 2007, authorisation was obtained from Hanam-si, for developing a tertiary, Hanam Campus. Camp Colbern, which was previously a US Army installation of 86,000 pyeong will be renovated for the purpose. A team will be banded per subject field to oversee the management.\n\n244 full-time teaching staff were recruited between 2005 and 2009, and in the first semester of 2009, 25 full-time and part-time staff were recruited.\n\nLaw and Medical Schools were established in March 2009.\n\nKRW 40 billion of development funds, KRW 166.3 billion of external research grant, and KRW 17.3 billion in government aid allocated as a government-funded enterprise have been secured over the 4 years since Dr. Bum Hoon Park's inauguration into office. The sum of KRW 223.6 billion is the largest amount secured financially in the history of the university.\n\nIn May 2008, a global corporation, Doosan Group, was incorporated as an educational institution, and Yong-Sung Park was elected as the ninth chairman of the board.\n\nThe appointment of Chairman Park, who negotiated the industry-shift of Doosan Group from consumer goods to heavy industry, symbolises the rebirth of the university. Within 80 days of taking office, a meeting was held with the teaching staff on 27 August 2008, where the CAU2018+ Mid-Term Development Plans were announced along with the new strategy direction of \"Choice and Concentrate, Strengthening of Executive Ability, Establishment of Virtuous Cycle Structure\".\n\nThe Degree Management System has been strengthened to encourage students to study diligently, as in order to graduate, students have been made to attain a minimum level in compulsory subjects such as English and Accounting.\n\nIn order to the support this type of research, education and practice more effectively, an R&D Center for the College of Pharmacy and new Dormitories for students were constructed, the Central Library renovated, and the hospital extended to fit 300 additional wards.\n\nResearch projects are also being supported by the Special Committee for Strengthening the Research Marketability.\n\nSuch changes have already resulted in the designation of six new companies in the second stages of the BK21 enterprise, and a budget of KRW 6 billion being allocated to the leading research team, thus implementing the \"choice and concentrate\" strategy.\n\nThe direct election system for presidency was abolished and replaced by the appointment system. Consequently, the 12th president, Dr. Bum Hee Park, was re-appointed into office as the consecutive 13th president.\n\nThe largest project being persevered by Dr. Bum Hee Park and the corporation, is the establishment of Hanam Campus.
