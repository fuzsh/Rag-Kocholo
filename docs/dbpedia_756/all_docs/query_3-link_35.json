        "text": "2024\n\nChina and the Geopolitics of Climate Change\n\nMay 16, 2024 | Video\n\nInternational climate policy is now shaped as much by geopolitics as by energy, economics or ecology, in large part because of China. Diplomatic cooperation between China and the U.S. is often seen as essential for climate action, but its temporary suspension following Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan showed that climate change is directly affected by U.S.-China competition. Drawing on a recent book, \"China’s Next Act,\" Scott Moore's talk probed the implications of growing geopolitical tension and rivalry for climate action – including whether competition might help spur increased investment in clean technology and climate adaptation.\n\nLegal Development in China since the 'Rule of Law' Plenum\n\nMay 8, 2024 | Video\n\nThe Fourth Plenum of the 18th Party Congress in 2014 was the first CCP plenum to be focused on the \"rule of law.\" Ten years later, and in the aftermath of a highly disruptive pandemic, what is the state of legal developments anticipated by the Fourth Plenum Decision? Grounded in extensive fieldwork over the past ten years, including post-pandemic, this presentation will focus especially on the judicial and administrative law reform agenda that was specified in that decision — and the formidable obstacles that have solidified in the years since.\n\nChina’s Tech Trajectory: Latest Developments & Implications for the U.S.\n\nMay 2, 2024 | Video\n\nChina’s overall economy is doing poorly, but its tech sector appears to be making progress. In this presentation, Scott Kennedy reported on the takeaways from his recent field research trip aimed at assessing how Chinese companies are doing in a range of industries (including EVs, semiconductors, and pharma) and what this means for the U.S.’s de-risking strategy.\n\nThe Rise and Fall of Technology in China: From History to the Present\n\nApril 24, 2024 | Video\n\nChinese society has been shaped by the interplay of the EAST — Exams, Autocracy, Stability, and Technology — from ancient times through the present. In this wide-ranging talk based on his new book, Yasheng Huang will show how China’s ancient civil service examination system persisted through the centuries, upholding autocracy and stability, but hindering technological progress. Despite China's reform-era successes, Huang warns of the dangers posed by the recent political and economic reversals as conformity is once again prioritized over innovation.\n\nHow China Organizes and Operates State Surveillance\n\nApril 18, 2024 | Video\n\nMuch has been written about state surveillance in China, but lack of credible materials has hampered our understanding of its organization, scope and tactics. Extensive research of official sources reveals many previously unknown but critical details of the Chinese surveillance state. The CCP’s pervasive organizational networks enable the regime to mobilize vast manpower to perform labor-intensive surveillance functions. Data gleaned from local sources help determine the size, reach and effectiveness of China’s surveillance state. The real secret of state surveillance in China is its Leninist organizational capacity, not technological sophistication.\n\nCounter-Histories in China\n\nMarch 19, 2024 | Video\n\nNewspaper headlines describe a China that is uniformly bleak: a slowing economy, tensions with the West, and a surveillance state that seems to have crushed all opposing voices. But in his new book, \"Sparks: China's Underground Historians and Their Battle for the Future,\" Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author Ian Johnson presents a more nuanced picture of Xi Jinping's China, one where a vibrant movement of underground filmmakers, magazine publishers and authors challenge the Communist Party on its most important source of legitimacy: its control of history. In this book talk, Ian Johnson introduced us to China's counter-history movement, which echoes struggles in many societies for a more equitable and just accounting of the past.\n\nOn the Edge: Feeling Precarious in China\n\nMarch 13, 2024 | Video\n\nMargaret Hillenbrand, professor at Oxford University, suggests that evictions in China provoke questions about the limits of inequality, exclusion and insecure work as meaningful descriptors of social conditions in our times. In this talk, Hillenbrand explores the logic of expulsion in contemporary China, its capacity to foment both solidarity and social strife, and its relationship with cultural forms. In particular, she looks at how people living under precarity in China today use culture as a space to vent feelings of rage, resentment, distrust and disdain that are taboo under the diktats of so-called harmonious society.\n\nWuhan: How the COVID-19 Outbreak in China Spiraled Out of Control\n\nFeb. 29, 2024\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, which began as an outbreak in Wuhan in late 2019, has claimed millions of lives and caused unprecedented disruptions. In his new book \"Wuhan: How the COVID-19 Outbreak in China Spiraled Out of Control,\" Dali L. Yang of the University of Chicago scrutinizes China's emergency response to the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, delving into the government's handling of epidemic information and the decisions that influenced the scale and scope of the outbreak.\n\nChanging Image of the U.S. in China in an Era of Strategic Competition\n\nFeb. 22, 2024 | Video\n\nIn years past, most Chinese citizens’ views of the U.S. were largely positive despite ideological differences between the two countries. Relations were seen as beneficial to both countries, and most people in China appreciated U.S. culture and products. However, relations between the two countries have deteriorated drastically in recent years, with the trade war and other arenas heightening tensions. How do Chinese citizens view the U.S. today? What’s the implication for the future of U.S.-China relations? In this talk, Professor Wei Da of Tsinghua University drew on his research to help answer these questions and more.\n\nThe Ideological Foundations of Imperial Taxation Under Qing\n\nFeb. 15, 2024 | Video Increasingly, scholars believe that China’s relative economic decline in the 18th and 19th centuries was related to its weak fiscal institutions and limited revenue. Taisu Zhang argues in this talk that the fiscal weakness was fundamentally ideological in nature. A confluence of traditional political ethics and the trauma of dynastic change created belief systems that imposed unusually deep and powerful constraints on fiscal policymaking and institutions throughout the final 250 years of China’s imperial history, leading to the Qing empire’s decline.\n\nField Notes on the Taiwan Election\n\nJan. 18, 2024 | Video\n\nJanuary 13, 2024: Taiwan’s general election. Who gains and who loses? What’s on the minds of Taiwan voters? How does the election bode for Taiwan’s relationship with mainland China, countries in the region, and the U.S.? Professor Thomas Gold from UC Berkeley and Professor Nathan Batto from Academia Sinica addressed these questions and more, drawing on Gold’s just-completed election observation tour and Batto’s long-running experience in Taiwan studying the Legislative Yuan.\n\n2023\n\nChina in Africa: New Relational Power\n\nNov. 30, 2023 | Video\n\nUsing a Chinese conceptualization of social capital, informal interviews and two decades of official data, professor Joshua Eisenman explained how and why the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is building relationships with African political elites.\n\nLobbying Autocrats: Policy Advocacy in Nondemocracies\n\nNov. 2, 2023 | Video\n\nAlthough autocracies often repress independent citizen activity, lobbying by civil society organizations is widespread. Using case studies in China, Russia and Malaysia, Jessica Teets’ edited volume \"Lobbying the Autocrat\" shows how citizen advocacy organizations mitigate changing levels of political repression and build resilience through \"tactful contention\" strategies. Thus, within the bounds set by authoritarian regimes, adaptive lobbying may still bring about localized responsiveness and representation.\n\nFace to Face with Pipa Virtuoso Wu Man\n\nOct. 24, 2023 Wu Man, the world-renowned pipa virtuoso, brought her knowledge and compositions to the stage for this unique concert and conversation.\n\nChina Town Hall\n\nOct. 11, 2023 | Video China Town Hall fosters a national conversation on China, with this year’s event featuring U.S. Ambassador to China, Nicholas Burns, in a telecast, followed by a talk by our own professor Michael Davidson in person.\n\nSovereign Funds: How the Chinese Communist Party Finances Its Ambitions\n\nOct. 5, 2023 | Video\n\nZoe Liu discussed how sovereign funds have supported China’s industrial policies by financing the state’s procurement of strategic overseas assets, bankrolling Chinese enterprises’ mergers and acquisitions abroad, and sponsoring the development of indigenous Chinese technology startups.\n\nTrade and Diplomacy in Mao’s China\n\nSept. 28, 2023 | Video\n\nWe joined Jason M. Kelly, senior lecturer in the Department of Politics and International Relations at Cardiff University, as he discussed how China’s early diplomacy and trade shaped its rise.\n\nU.S. Presidential Transitions and the China Policy\n\nJuly 27, 2023 | Video\n\nThis year’s Susan Shirk Lecture on U.S.-China Relations welcomed Stephen Hadley, former national security advisor to George W. Bush, and Susan Shirk, founding chair of the 21st Century China Center, in a conversation about presidential transitions and U.S.-China policy.
