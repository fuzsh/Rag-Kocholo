        "text": "How to Keep House While Drowning: a gentle approach to cleaning and organizing by KC Davis.\n\nSimon Element, Simon and Schuster, New York, 2022. Previously self-published.\n\nAdult nonfiction, 152 pages.\n\nNot leveled.\n\nA guide to practical aspects of housekeeping and self-care while struggling with mental health, disability, grief, or other debilitating circumstances.\n\nI first came across Davis through her phrase “care tasks are morally neutral” and it was hugely resonant with me. As longtime readers of this blog will know, after several years of mostly routine posting, in March 2023 I had to take an indefinite hiatus. Those circumstances were also devastating in other areas of my life, so I decided to return to blogging with this book.\n\nDavis works at breaking down some barriers to care tasks and has such a comprehensive, easy plan for dealing with some major struggles that I wept my first time reading this. Not everything she says will be applicable to every life, and I suspect most of us will have a lot to unpack in order to feel good following the plan she outlines here, but this approach is certainly needed by many.\n\nThe physical format reminded me strongly of Marie Kondo’s Magic of Tidying (although the content is vastly different). It’s a small size, with chapter titles and page numbers on the bottom, able to be read in short breaks, with crucial bits in bold. Instead of frequent lists, the text is broken up by small spot illustrations. The interior drawings are by Lydia Ellen Greaves, who does well – but the book heroine here is probably Jennifer Chung. I’m so glad she was credited because her design is just perfect.\n\nAs near as I can figure out, this book was first self-published as an e-book and then re-released as a major hardcover in 2022. That’s not unheard of, but certainly a testament to how popular Davis has become. The team does well bringing this into a print format that’s enjoyable and practical.\n\nDavis makes a laudable effort at inclusivity. She speaks to differences in how care tasks are historically perceived relating to men or women, includes a segment by a guest author with ideas on Black hair care during times of struggle, and is careful to include those without children as well as offering advice for parents. While this book is written for those with wiggle room in the budget to either outsource laundry, childcare, or other aspects, or to buy tools that make care tasks easier, Davis at least acknowledges that difference.\n\nThe book is designed with many aspects to make it more accessible for neurodivergent readers, such as special font, short chapters, main points in bold, and carefully chosen small illustrations. Some chapters are only one page.\n\nThere is also a “shortcut journey” which abridges the book a little bit like a choose-your-own-adventure, but with less choices. It includes the chapters that focus on the core philosophy and some of the essential topics and skips chapters on: the functional break down of care tasks; understanding the difference between organization, tidiness, and cleanliness; comparing oneself to others; an exercise in understanding one’s personal functional priorities; caring for a body one hates; thoughts on self-affirmation; thoughts on perfectionism; using rhythms instead of routines; and returning to rhythms when we’ve been shaken or pulled out of them.\n\nThere are some optional skips including chapters on: division of labor; exercise; weight; and food. I had already read the book in its entirety so before writing this review decided to try the abridged version. The front matter says it should take approximately 30-60 minutes depending on reading speed, but this estimate seems low. It still took me over 50 minutes.\n\nI’m curious if anyone else tried this and timed it. The physical act of paper reading in a print format can be rather different, especially if one is flipping through pages to find the next chapter, so I wonder if this estimate was based on the digital version and a scroll-through. However, one certainly need not read the entire book in one sitting, and chapters are purposefully kept short and broken up when possible.\n\nParts of what Davis discusses apply to individuals (such as showering) but several of her strategies look at larger household systems (such as laundry or dishes). The philosophy as a whole and the ideas for people are useful, but some systems are not functional for large households with 4 or more children or with multiple generations living together. Luckily just as she brings in an expert to talk about Black hair, she also includes an appendix which has several ideas for larger families.\n\nMeant for mature readers, this contains swears and topics not suitable for young readers. Neither are gratuitous; the former seems to be a part of Davis’ natural flow of speech, and the latter is an expected part of a book about self-care while in survival mode. I think this could be of value to older students or teen libraries, but would suggest adults preread and use judgement when recommending – consider whether this discussion would be triggering or helpful for students with mental health struggles.\n\nI’d especially suggest this book for therapists, occupational therapists, social workers, and any people who struggle with housekeeping skills, have illnesses which interfere with personal care tasks, or who have loved ones that fit any of the above.\n\nRecommended."
