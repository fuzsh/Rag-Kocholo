        "text": "Need for Care Elementary School Nurse: When they come in with mouth pain, I have them rinse their mouth. I do have them floss...I also tell them that you know they’re going to end up getting an infection and it’s going to go to their heart.\n\nMiddle School Nurse: But a lot of these children are coming from other countries where they have other physical impairments, orthopedic impairments, things like that and oral health is not a priority for them…There’s some shame also, I think, that comes along with that, where they won’t open their mouth, or they won’t smile only because they know that they are lacking oral hygiene and care. High School Teacher: So, I’ve known students who, bay don’t s and when they laugh, they try to purposely cover-up, so they’ll keep their mouth closed. But then, from students I’ve known, they’ll get braces and, afterward, once they’re done with the braces, suddenly, they start smiling again. So, and I talked about this before, about how they were embarrassed about their teeth and, you know, until they got the braces and their teeth were straightened; now, then, afterward, they smile differently.\n\nHigh School Teacher: With a lot of our newcomers that are coming from El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Colombia, Mexico, especially from Central and South America, many of them are coming. with zero dental oral health services in their lives, and so it, you know, especially that population, has struggled and then, you know, come here and then really needs a full workup analysis, I don’t know what dentists call it, but, you know, some indication. Access to Care Elementary School Nurse: Well, if they want to get the care, they will. What happens is they cannot get the care? Then, the group that I refer them to makes sure that they help them register for Medi-Cal. I make it quite clear with the parent; if they are an immigrant, it makes no difference if they are a citizen or not. Your child is eligible to have care. It doesn’t mean that you are eligible to have care, but your child is eligible to have care, so please, please, your child is in need of care and that will help them do better in school.\n\nMiddle School Nurse: We do have access to a lot of services; the mobile services are limited, varnish, fluoride treatments, screening and then, if there are severe diseases or things that can’t be done in a mobile setting then we refer them out. Part of the issue is a lot of it is also, for at least our demographic, a lot of education that’s needed around oral health sometimes. The family is aware that the child has oral health needs, but just doesn’t understand the importance of dental care and what could potentially happen if they don’t get that treated immediately. And the other thing is, we do have a lot who are fearful of whether it’s their immigration status or their financial status or if their Medi-Cal or Denti-Cal. There’s that fear that they will still be financially responsible so they’re not willing to seek the resources out of fear, so we find that we have to do a lot of education with our students and our families.Middle School Teacher: The health clerk checks them out and usually contacts parents and if they don’t get ahold of parents, I usually like to follow up, especially with my special population because that’s the experience I’ve had that they’re the same kids that are constantly having the same issues. The first one, that I had in mind, you know, he was always saying you know, he was always hungry and always complaining of the toothache, so we had to call the guardians more than once to be able to reach them. But sadly, in his case, we had to get social services involved because there was clear neglect with him, unfortunately.\n\nHigh School Teacher: Yes, in my previous school that I was at for eight years, the majority of my students in my program were from the group home and our justice system and so forth, so there were lots of issues with consistency as far as their oral hygiene was concerned So, certainly, there is the aspect that the students were in pain from dental issues and the group home did make phone calls and appointments for the students to see a dentist. Referrals Elementary School Nurse: In my district, we use a dental school and also use an in-school dental program and they come to this school but, like you said two-three days only; they see students in three sessions; they wait in lines to be seen. They can do X-rays, fluoride treatments, and those who don’t have insurance, receive only cleaning and they put the fluoride. They tell the parents to take their child to the doctor at the dental school who does the treatment…So, I refer them to the ones that cover Medi-Cal, because the majority of these kids have Medi-Cal. So, I refer them to the closest one where they live. Sometimes when I screen, I scare them. They have a lot of scary mouths in my area, so. I refer them to the doctor, who sometimes asks why the child has not been a dentist.\n\nMiddle School Nurse: We do see a lot of students with caries or even ones that need braces and don’t have access to it, so in those instances, first of all, make contact with the family, with a parent; see what kind of insurance or lack of insurance they have; what kind of access. If they need resources, we’ll be for them; we’re fortunate that we have some school-based clinics. We do have mostly volunteers who work, and then we also have mobile oral health programs that visit our school sites or that we can refer students to.Middle School Teacher: We don’t have a school nurse, but because we’re a community school, we have a lot of different referrals. So, we were able to refer them out to different programs. We also work closely with a local clinic, which is a free clinic and then in our community, which is there for them as well and we’re close to a dental school, so we usually refer them to those two places.\n\nHigh School Teacher: The kids who are in group homes, the kids who are part of the juvenile justice system; those kids often struggle with oral health issues and oftentimes cannot get dental appointments. Part of the reason why, you know, we set up a partnership with a dental school, so that that we could get some dentists to come out and try to provide at least some screening and what not for some of our students who are not yet at least, in our case, in the group homes and the juvenile justice system, which are not necessarily making the appointments for them. And so, sometimes these kids are, you know, they’ll come, and they’ll say, you know, I’m in pain and you know, and then we’ll try to hook them up with a dentist or at least, you know, a local clinic that can at least provide some level of support. Oral Health Education Middle School Nurse: I work with the main teacher that teaches that health course who provided kind of the material to me, and then we added to that with online resources and things like that, and then formal training I’d say nursing school does touch on oral hygiene, especially in pediatrics rotation and then I can say for myself my community health rotation was at a free clinic where we actually worked alongside dentists, and I did dental hygiene work as a nursing student as well, so in that sense, I got to, you know, kind of hopefully work in a space with a dentist and be in that same space.\n\nMiddle School Nurse: I didn’t have any formal training, but I have a good relationship with one of the parents there who happens to be a dentist. So, any questions I have, I always refer to him, and then, when I do teach a health class, it is material that has been passed down to me from the previous teacher and I usually just focus on dental hygiene, the, you know, the important part of it, the name of the teeth and washing and why it’s important but also what I see when the kids come in with any dental problems I’ll have an example about that, and why it got to that point and what to do after.Elementary School Teacher: We don’t really teach oral hygiene and oral health is for dentists. I think it’s left up to the parents and my experience in the past has been that schools have been involved with bringing a dentist in giving them a personal lesson on what to do, how to encourage them to know how to brush their teeth after eating, making sure that that’s done.\n\nHigh School Teacher: We are lucky enough in my area to have a clinic, that is, you know, a very, very generous clinic that helps our students and this clinic, actually, they present to our students through elementary school, and they try to get to middle school and high school. So, you know, I even have this group come in and present too, so we talked a lot about, you know, dental care and basic hygiene and how important it is for our health in general that, you know, you could have numerous health problems, just because your teeth are not, you know, healthy. Parental Involvement Elementary School Nurse: Another nurse came up with an amazing plan, where she would set up a table in the morning with the puppets and with the different dental materials. Then, as parents were dropping off kids, that’s another way to get the parents to sign consents because the afterschool program doesn’t reach the parents that are the stay-at-home moms that do not have their kids in after-school programs. Also, present visuals that everyone would just be curious about: the cute dinosaurs and also have giveaways at that table that you give out. It’s not even about toothbrushes you give out. They did the best job of engaging parents that I had ever seen.\n\nHigh School Nurse: A lot of the schools have an active place where parents can gather and share resources and, on my campus, we have a parent representative who oversees the parent center and interacts with parents. So, you asked how we can get the parents involved: create awareness, be invested in or oversee, you know, supervising their children’s health. I would say that’s a really good avenue to tap into and if there are agencies for programs where they want to provide, you know, education, like seminars, a demo of good oral hygiene, health and how to do that. I mean, even at the high school level, you know high schoolers are lazy. You know and unless it’s drilled in, something that they do on their own, they’re going to neglect that so and then, if I mean oral hygiene, I think, is always tied into nutrition so. You know, combining that with your basics good nutritious eating and at the high school well that’s a problem because kids don’t eat and they don’t choose nutritious foods and so that ties back into getting, you know, caries and all that stuff so.Elementary School Teacher: I’d keep it small only because you’ll have parents that maybe don’t feel like they can chat; maybe their English isn’t strong, if you know, maybe they didn’t get it; they might not even be speaking Spanish, they might speak another language...We see this with a lot of second language families, where they’re so capable, but because they’re not strong in English, they don’t volunteer to help out at the school. And they can give so much to our school, so you’ll see this also where they won’t share; so maybe have something after where they can, I don’t know, where they can talk some, you know e-mail or do something that they can continue after, because a lot of them will just sit there and smile, but they have a lot to say; you just won’t know it, we see that a lot.\n\nElementary School Teacher: I would just say you’re going to get a higher rate of attendance on Zoom; that’s what I’ve noticed, especially with conferences. For parents who have a hard time at lunch break to drive all the way down to school, Zoom has made it so much easier to communicate. So, I think people are going to be, especially parents are going to be, much more open to doing a meeting knowing they don’t need to drive somewhere, find parking and find a babysitter and such."
