Dublin based telco, Talktelecom has announced a deal with Inspired Broadcast Networks, a UK provider of networked out-of-home entertainment systems for pubs and the exclusive provider of all digital entertainment to Leisure Link, the largest manager of coin operated entertainment machines in Europe.

The contract will allow low-cost international call cards to be sold through the Inspired itbox, a coin-operated, in-pub entertainment vending machine. Pub goers in the UK who want to call overseas can look forward to chatting with friends on distant continents for as little as the cost of a local mobile call.

There are currently 7,000 itboxes installed in pubs throughout the UK and a further 6,000 networked terminals in retail locations and licensed betting offices. Deployment of the new card function is expected to be completed by mid 2006.

“It has been a challenge to integrate the systems in the timescales demanded but we are delighted with our progress to date”, said Anne Fox, director of Marketing, Talktelecom.
