The terminals can be found at about 10,000 sites

Pictures of five people who have gone missing in the UK over the last 20 years are to be beamed to pub and club-goers this month.

The images will feature on about 10,000 music entertainment terminals during Missing Persons Month.

Each case will appear for 10 seconds when the devices are not in use.

The National Missing Persons Helpline (NMPH) charity estimates that about 210,000 people go missing in the UK every year.

People will be able to find out more information about the cases and the NMPH campaign through the "itbox" touch-screen terminals.

"The itbox is a valuable opportunity for our charity to reach thousands of people every day," said NMPH spokeswoman Issy Cowburn.

"If it helps us to raise the profile of the cause or maybe reunite one family, then the venture will have been a success."

Confidential messages

The featured cases include Kevin Hicks from Croydon, who was 16 when he went missing in 1986 after going out to local shops, and Chantel Taylor, 30, from Birkenhead, last seen in March.

Derek Burns from West Calder, West Lothian, was 20 when last seen in 1989. His family hope the new campaign will lead to new information.

"If only he knew the difference a phone call would make," his father, also called Derek said. "All we want is to know he's alive."

The other people featured are Matthew Foyle, from Newton Abbot in Devon and Aphrodite Moleka, from Streatham, south London.

The NMPH, set up in 1992 to help find missing people, offers advice to those who have left home and can pass on free confidential messages.

Several other NMPH events are also taking place this month, including its annual Missing Miles sponsored walk from Edinburgh to London.
