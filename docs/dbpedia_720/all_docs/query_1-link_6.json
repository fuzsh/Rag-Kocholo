        "text": "Duke Street is pleased to announce that it has agreed to acquire AGITO Medical, carving the business out from Philips. AGITO is a leading medical imaging solutions provider, supporting healthcare practitioners by providing access to high-quality imaging equipment as well as radiography staffing services.\n\nThis deal reflects Duke Street's commitment to supporting businesses in the healthcare ecosystem, where it has a long track record of investing in growth and expansion across services and geographies.\n\nAGITO Medical was founded in 2004 in Aalborg, Denmark, with a mission to offer healthcare practitioners and their service providers cost-efficient imaging equipment and spare parts.\n\nThe company offers hospitals and clinics a flexible and tailored rental service of high-quality mobile imaging equipment across CT, MRI, and CathLabs, with or without additional services such as staffing. AGITO proudly has the latest mobile magnetic resonance scanning products in its large fleet, including a state-of-the-art helium-free solution. AGITO’s expert team manages the full lifecycle of its inventory on behalf of clients, from second-hand purchase to rental, resale, and repair.\n\nSince Philips acquired AGITO in 2018, the business has grown significantly and expanded its operations to multiple international markets, delivering rental solutions across 10+ countries, including Germany, France, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Today, the company has 47 employees and a fleet of nearly 50 rental units. This makes AGITO one of Europe's top three medical imaging rental businesses.\n\nThe acquisition of this top European business by Duke Street comes at a pivotal growth point within the healthcare sector. Europe's medical imaging rental market is currently worth approximately €500m. It is predicted to grow by 6-7% over the next few years as diagnostics are a critical first step in clinical pathways. Duke Street’s injection of investment into AGITO will further strengthen its capability and capacity to provide both quality equipment and highly skilled radiographers, ensuring the business can address the complex needs of healthcare providers today.\n\nDuke Street has a long and successful track record of investing in and growing healthcare businesses. Since 1997, it has invested a total of €600m in the Healthcare sector. In September 2022, Duke Street sold the medical instrument business Medi-Globe Group to DCC Healthcare, a subsidiary of FTSE 100 listed company DCC plc, for an enterprise value of approximately €245m.\n\nOther successful healthcare exits by Duke Street include its investment in oxygen-therapy provider Baywater Healthcare (sold in 2017), generating a total cash return of more than 6x and 85% IRR for Duke Street and its investors.\n\nDuke Street’s current healthcare portfolio companies include Kent Pharmaceuticals. In 2019, Duke Street led a carve-out of Kent from FTSE 100 conglomerate DCC plc. Since then, Kent’s EBITDA has tripled.\n\nJames Almond, Managing Partner at Duke Street, commented:\n\n“We are very pleased to acquire AGITO, a market-leading business that we believe represents a significant opportunity for Duke Street and our investors. Our investment in AGITO represents a classic Duke Street deal: a carve-out from a globally recognised business, acquisition of an excellent healthcare product and a talented team that we back, fuelled by an investment programme that will create value for all. This business has great potential to scale further and cement its position as a core partner to public and private health systems across Europe. The Duke Street team and I look forward to working closely with the team at AGITO to realise that opportunity.”\n\n“Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth”. I was reminded of those words while looking back at my year as BVCA chair and considering how some significant events impacted on my plan for the key priorities that would shape my year. We saw unprecedented upheavals in the political landscape. That has resulted in some changes in the stakeholders we are dealing with and a refocusing of our engagement with them. However the BVCA is used to working with all political parties to address their priorities while making sure they understand those of our industry and we will continue to do so.\n\nWe saw the war in Ukraine and aftershocks from the pandemic creating a much worse economic outlook - rising inflation, higher interest rates, risk of recession. Clearly this will challenge many of our portfolio companies, but private capital’s active ownership model is well suited to dealing with such challenges. That model was seriously tested during the GFC, and the result was continued outperformance of private capital over public equity. And beyond that there will be really attractive investment opportunities – just as the private capital vintages immediately following the GFC were very strong. I also believe we will see investors continuing to allocate capital to our asset class over the next cycle - because the return outperformance that private capital delivers is a key part of their asset allocation strategy and helps them in turn deliver stronger returns for their investors, including millions of pensioners across the UK.\n\nAlongside dealing with these developments, over the year we have made solid progress in communicating the reality of the private capital business model and the positive impact of private capital more generally.\n\nOver the year, we have released a number of rigorous and robust reports that help to support the fact that private capital’s consistent outperformance of public markets is driven by long term investment in growth and creation of more resilient, higher quality businesses as opposed to cutting investment or costs. So there is more evidence out there to evidence the beneficial impact of private capital in our economy and communities that we are using to communicate that message clearly to stakeholders in politics, regulators, and the media.\n\nOver the last year it has been a privilege to serve as chair of the BVCA working with the strong, committed team. I look forward to continuing to work with my successor, Garry Wilson, and the excellent BVCA team over the years ahead.\n\nThis year marks the 40th anniversary of the BVCA’s foundation - 40 years of delivering world class training and events, of providing key technical and regulatory input and essential focused advocacy for our members. Over those 40 years the scale, capability, and impact of the BVCA has grown massively in lockstep with the private capital industry that we represent. I’m sure that both the private capital industry and the BVCA will still be thriving 40 years ahead.\n\nListen here to Charlie’s podcast reflecting on his year as BVCA Chair.\n\nRead the article on the BVCA website here\n\nCharlie Troup\n\nManaging Partner, Duke Street, and BVCA Chair 2022-23\n\nWe are delighted to announce that Charlie Troup has been appointed by the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (BVCA) as Chair of its Council for the next year to 31st March 2023. Charlie brings to the role nearly 30 years’ experience in private equity, having supported businesses of all sizes and at all stages of growth. He is a Managing Partner and chair of the investment committee here at Duke Street having joined the firm in 2006.\n\nCharlie has been Vice Chair of the BVCA’s Council for the past year, following 2 and half years as a council member, and closely involved in the association’s work on behalf of private capital. In what has been a busy year for the industry – supporting businesses across the country to weather the final stages of the pandemic, creating thousands of new jobs and leading on a number of high-profile deals – Charlie has already been heavily engaged in the BVCA’s work with both media and government.\n\nIn addition, Charlie has also supported the BVCA on its policy focus including how the industry supports the government’s Net Zero targets, how it can continue to improve and evolve its objectives around diversity and inclusion and its involvement in support for future savers following ongoing discussion around DC Pension Scheme investment in private equity and venture capital. These areas, as well as how the industry can play its part in the support of Ukraine, will continue to be priorities for Charlie and the BVCA during the next 12 months.\n\nCharlie said about his appointment:\n\n“I am excited to step up and represent the BVCA’s diverse membership over the next 12 months, following in the footsteps of Kerry Baldwin who has been outstanding in the role. Private equity and venture capital deliver so much for the country. Be it the industry’s unwavering support for SMEs, how it underpins over one million jobs or the part it plays in keeping the UK competitive on the global stage, I am thrilled to be able to advocate on its behalf.”\n\nMichael Moore, Director General of the BVCA, said:\n\n“We are all delighted to welcome Charlie as Chair at the point where our industry looks to increase its support for businesses in all corners of the United Kingdom. I am certain that Charlie’s experience in private capital will be critical this year as we look to further showcase the remarkable work of our members and help them drive growth; providing the capital, expertise and long-term view that enables companies to innovate and flourish.”\n\nOne of the largest ever transactions in the UK casual dining sector\n\nSale will generate a 3.4x return for Duke Street\n\nContinues Duke Street’s strong track record of successful exits to trade buyers - 10 of last 12 exits\n\nDuke Street has agreed to sell Wagamama to The Restaurant Group plc, one of the UK's largest independent restaurant groups, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange. Duke Street will sell Wagamama for an enterprise value of £559 million, generating a 3.4x money multiple for the firm.\n\nWagamama was established in London’s Bloomsbury in 1992 and is based in the United Kingdom. Wagamama operates popular, award-winning noodle restaurants and offers fresh, pan-Asian cuisine in a friendly, vibrant setting. The menu features a wide variety of noodle and rice dishes, as well as salads and side dishes, juices, hot drinks, wine, sake and Asian beers. Many Wagamama signature dishes can be found in all of the Group’s restaurants across the globe and the restaurants also have local specialties that take advantage of regional produce and tastes.\n\nDuke Street acquired Wagamama in 2011 for £215 million when the Group had 70 restaurants. Since 2011 Duke Street has worked closely with Wagamama’s management team to transform the business. Wagamama now has 133 restaurants in the UK, almost double the number since Duke Street first invested, 5 outlets in the USA (across Boston, Massachusetts and New York City) and 58 franchise restaurants operating in 23 markets spread across Western Europe, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and New Zealand.\n\nWagamama continues to trade very strongly and is the outstanding performer in the UK casual dining sector. The Company has demonstrated a strong track record of like-for-like revenue growth with 228 consecutive weeks of positive performance. Over this period, the annual like-for-like growth was 9.6%, and on average 8.5% ahead of the market, as measured by the Coffer-Peach tracker. Wagamama generated revenue of £307m and EBITDA of £43m post pre-opening costs in the twelve months to 19 August 2018. Wagamama delivered a 17% UK revenue CAGR (compound annual growth rate) between FY 2015 and FY 2018.\n\nPeter Taylor, Managing Partner at Duke Street, commented:\n\n“We are very proud to announce the sale of Wagamama to The Restaurant Group. This is one of the largest ever transactions in the UK casual dining space, a market which has been challenging in recent years. Duke Street has supported an outstanding management team under Jane Holbrook’s leadership to transform the company and ensure that Wagamama has emerged as the standout success story of the UK casual dining sector.\n\n“Our investment in Wagamama represents a classic Duke Street deal: a complex transaction that we delivered in 2011 outside an auction process; working with management to grow the business swiftly and successfully during our period of ownership; adding international expansion and a popular delivery function; and securing an exit to trade, taking Duke Street’s recent record to ten trade sales out of our last twelve exits. These are exciting times for the firm: our recently enhanced investment team is delivering a strong pipeline of attractive opportunities for our investors and partners.”\n\nJane Holbrook, CEO of Wagamama, commented:\n\n“Wagamama has enjoyed a very strong track record both financially and operationally, driven by the ongoing successful execution of our growth strategy. Duke Street has been hugely supportive, investing heavily in the key resources to drive our position as the UK’s leading casual dining chain, while also helping us take the business and the brand to a growing international customer base.”\n\nThe sale of Wagamama follows recent successful exits by Duke Street from its investments in Baywater Healthcare UK and LM Funerals. The exit from Baywater generated a total cash return of more than 5x for Duke Street and the sale of its stake in LM Funerals generated a return of 2.6x.\n\nIn the last 12 months the firm has made three new investments, acquiring Great Rail Journeys, the world’s leading provider of escorted rail holidays in July 2018; acquiring A-ROSA, the German upmarket river cruise operator in February 2018; and buying a controlling interest in TeamSport Karting, the UK’s largest indoor go-karting operator, in October 2017.\n\nOn this transaction Goldman Sachs International acted as sole financial advisor to Wagamama and Duke Street; Latham and Watkins provided legal advice, exclusively.\n\nDuke Street has restructured its sixth fund, with half of LPs cashing out via the process. As part of the unquote\" In Profile series, Denise Ko Genovese takes a look at the GP's new hybrid strategy.\n\n50% of existing investors rolled over into newly created SPV\n\nGP has made five deal-by-deal investments since moving away from fund-based investing\n\nTypical investments range from £50-250m EV\n\nMid-market private equity house Duke Street has restructured its 2006 fund, Duke Street VI, in a deal that sees Goldman Sachs and Arcano taking the position of almost half the original LPs. A total of 50% of investors decided to cash out, with the remainder rolling over into a newly created special purpose vehicle (SPV) where the six remaining assets from Fund VI, including Wagamama and The Original Factory Shop, were transferred.\n\n\"We started to think about options for Duke Street VI last year as it was approaching the 10-year point since first close,\" says investor relations partner James Almond. \"We wanted to offer our LPs choice, knowing some would appreciate liquidity given the age of their own underlying funds or the fact private equity was no longer a core strategy of theirs. So we decided to restructure the fund and we received overwhelming support with 89% approval from the 50-strong LP group.\"\n\nLazard was hired to run a process before the summer of 2016 and by September there were a handful of potential buyers willing to provide cash. Goldman Sachs offered the highest price as well as tabling new money to fund future deals as a cornerstone investor – up to 50% of the GP's equity ticket, says Almond. Spanish investment group Arcano also took part in the process and agreed to work alongside the lead bidder at the syndication phase.\n\n\"For those rolling over, we wanted to keep the terms the same, so no different to [what they would have been] if we had extended the life of the fund,\" says Almond. \"And for those cashing out, we wanted to maximise the price – it was at a price that was a premium to the NAV of the fund.\"\n\nDuke Street says it is adopting a hybrid model for the next phase of its investment journey, moving away from its deal-by-deal approach, since they now also have cornerstone funds at their disposal. For a new deal, the GP contribution will be 3-5%, the cornerstone fund contributing 50%, with additional co-investment. French investment bank Tikehau acquired a 30% chunk of the Duke Street business in 2013, so the underwriting capability is still on the table in the unlikely event it is required, says Almond.\n\nChallenge or opportunity\n\nA few years ago, the GP moved away from fund-based investing to a deal-by-deal approach. \"It wasn’t all smooth sailing, especially since the model wasn’t as common here in Europe as it is in the US, but we have proved ourselves now with five deals under our belt, which have a combined EV of £700m,\" says Almond.\n\n\"The market has been evolving and some LPs who said they couldn’t invest with a fundless sponsor only 18 months ago are willing and wanting to co-invest now. We have a club of circa 20 LPs who co-invest in our deals, several of them have been repeat investors. Our most recent deals have been heavily oversubscribed. Now GS and Arcano have given us further support with the new cornerstone fund, we have plenty of fire power.\"\n\nIndeed, the co-investment market in general is more established now, and most GPs admit there is increasing appetite for it. Not only is there money to deploy since returns have been so good, LPs are getting savvier about reducing fees. When asked whether Duke Street will ever fundraise again, Almond concedes it would never say never. However, it is keen to give the hybrid model a chance to succeed, especially given the apparent advantages of flexibility and deal-by-deal carried interest.\n\n\"The 10-year fund model isn’t going anywhere – but I think we’ll start seeing some different and more flexible models on the periphery,\" says Almond. Duke Street typically calls on three to five co-investors for each deal and the LPs range from family offices such as Souter Investments to blue chip institutions like Deutsche Bank, Alberta Teachers and Allstate Insurance.\n\nSame but different\n\nThe GP's focus on four sectors – services, healthcare, consumer and industrials – remains unchanged. It continues to look at companies with an EV of £50-250m, though this can on occasion be higher: Voyage Care was a chunky £375m. Duke Street will typically contribute a £60-70m equity ticket.\n\n\"We don't often go into auctions as the companies we like to invest in can sometimes need quite a bit of operational or strategic change and may not appeal to everyone or suit a process,\" Almond says, citing the acquisitions of Ardent and Mediglobe where there were messy shareholder structures to buy out. With this in mind, the hope is for an investment rate of up to three deals a year.\n\nAnd in terms of tapping the debt markets for financing, Duke Street is fairly open to the range of options. It used mezzanine for Laurel Funerals; ABL for Ardent; bonds for Voyage and Wagamama; and a group of local German banks for Mediglobal.\n\nDeal-by-deal track record\n\nSince adopting the deal-by-deal approach four years ago, Duke Street has acquired five companies and exited two.\n\nLaurel Funerals was acquired in 2012 and sold to Dignity and August Equitybacked FSP in 2015; Baywater Healthcare was acquired in 2013 as a carve-out from a larger corporate, with the group's Irish division then sold to Air Liquide in 2015. The GP also acquired Voyage Care in 2014, created Ardent out of the acquisitions of Fork Rent and One Call in 2015, and most recently bought German medical equipment maker MediGlobe in 2016.\n\nLonger-term returns are understood to be more than 2x with an IRR approaching 30% since the 2008 crisis, with a further pick-up in performance since adopting the deal-by-deal approach with returns of over 3x.\n\nKey People\n\n• Peter Taylor, managing partner, joined Duke Street in 1996 after qualifying as a chartered accountant and working at Bridgepoint.

The group has traded ahead of the competition for more than two years (for 112 consecutive weeks*) and is well placed to continue to grow in the UK and internationally.\n\nThe strong results reflect the active management of the UK owned estate. The Kaizen project, which seeks continuous improvement in all restaurants across all aspects of operations, including new and rebuild designed restaurants as well as the refurbishment of key existing restaurants, successfully drove higher average unit volumes. By the end of FY 2017, the majority of the estate will be new, rebuilt or refurbished. The company has also continued to build its iconic restaurant brand internationally with a focus on the US owned estate and new European franchise markets. Currently the group operates 158 restaurants in 18 countries worldwide.\n\nFinancial highlights:\n\n• Turnover increased by 19.0% to £228.1m, in comparison with £191.7m in FY 2015\n\n• UK like-for-like sales grew by 13.1%, significantly outperforming the competitive market\n\n• USA like-for-like sales grew by 11.3%\n\n• Adjusted EBITDA up by 28.0% to £38.7m reflecting improved sales momentum and margin\n\nEnhancement initiatives:\n\n• Significantly deleveraged since bond issue and continued strong cash conversion\n\nOperational highlights:\n\n• New UK openings, extensive refurbishment programme and rebuilds, including Heathrow Terminal 5 (pictured)\n\n• Focused development of US owned estate, currently Boston and New York City\n\n• Second lease secured in East Village, New York City\n\n• New European franchisee agreements signed in France, Spain, Portugal and Italy, wit growth in existing franchise markets\n\n• Growth across portfolio driven by increase in covers and average spend per head\n\nDavid Campbell, CEO of wagamama, said:\n\n“I’m delighted to report these fantastic results, which reflects the hard work delivered by the team throughout the past year to ensure our brand, UK estate upgrade, and continued international expansion is a great success.\n\n“Having established a strong UK brand, which has now outperformed the UK restaurant market for 112 consecutive weeks, we are excited to be moving further down a path to create an iconic international restaurant brand.

Alice Murray assesses two GPs that have employed both strategies.\n\nIn February 2012, news hit that Duke Street, the UK mid-market stalwart, had abandoned fundraising efforts and would instead adopt a deal-by-deal approach. The GP had been out on the road for a year previously as it attempted to raise an €850m fund.\n\nThe announcement garnered huge amounts of attention and intrigue at the time, with some industry participants wondering if the entire private equity model was at threat and others assuming poor performance on Duke Street's part.\n\nWhatever the causes, the GP pushed on and in June 2013 announced it had signed a deal with Paris-based investment firm Tikehau Group. \"During the early days of deal-by-deal there was a fair amount of scepticism of the model, especially in Europe. So Tikehau came in and bought a 35% stake, which gave us underwriting capability,\" explains Peter Taylor, managing partner of Duke Street.\n\nAccording to Taylor, following the GP's acquisition of Voyage Care from previous backers HgCapital, the completion of such a large transaction – £375m – stopped a lot of questions around Duke Street's new model. \"We've now done five deals outside of a fund. The investors are now more used to the concept and more LPs are doing co-investments. The model is more established in the US and we're now seeing more interest from US LPs,\" adds Taylor.\n\nFlip-side\n\nIn contrast to Duke Street's story, Lonsdale Capital recently closed a £110m fund after using a deal-by-deal approach for six years previously. According to Alan Dargan, one of Lonsdale's founders, the GP would have raised a fund at conception; however, with LPs typically averse to debut vehicles, the team decided instead to prove themselves. \"When we set up in 2009 we had done some deals but the company was still in its early days,\" says another Lonsdale founder David Gasparro. \"At that stage, it was about getting people to take us seriously. There was work to be done getting ourselves established in the advisory community etc. So that's what we did.\"\n\nAs an echo to Taylor's experience, Gasparro says scepticism over the deal-by-deal model soon dropped away. But despite investors' increasing comfort around deal-by-deal, for him, the main advantage of moving to fund investing is not having to think about raising equity for each deal – having a level of certainty.\n\nAnother positive Lonsdale gained by moving to a fund is the impact on recruitment. Says Dargan: \"Now we can recruit staff into a stable environment. We can communicate and invest for the medium to long term.\"\n\nBehavioural impact\n\nInterestingly, while Lonsdale believes the fund approach has improved the team in terms of stability, for Duke Street, the deal-by-deal model also has a positive impact on team behaviour. \"The impact of deal-by-deal on the team's behaviour has meant there is much more of a direct relationship – they're much closer to each deal as the pay-outs are far quicker,\" explains Taylor.\n\n\"We don't want to be too divisive – it's not eat what you kill – there are still some fund structure elements. But it has made the culture more entrepreneurial; the team is hungrier. It is very powerful. Especially given the timings of pay-outs from fund structures,\" Taylor says.\n\nFor the Lonsdale founders, this sentiment does not necessarily ring true. Says Gasparro: \"We have done two deals with the fund so far and I haven't detected any change in behaviour because carry is structured broadly the same as it was for deal-by-deal. Behaviour and the level of challenge for potential deals is just how it was before.\"\n\nBut perhaps in the case of Lonsdale, because of its carry structure – whereby all staff have carry as all employees have invested in the fund – that incentivisation mechanic is more apparent than many other funds in the market at the moment, which have seen continued reductions in GP fund commitments.\n\nHowever, Dargan admits the economics of deal-by-deal investing will be missed: \"Our first two exits were very good and the economics of that flows through. The economics are faster on deal-by-deal for good exits.\"\n\nCollaborative approach\n\nHaving been applying the deal-by-deal model for four years now, Duke Street is benefiting from a recent development among LPs: increased demand for co-investments. Says James Almond, partner at Duke Street in charge of fundraising: \"From an investor's perspective, deal-by-deal is cheaper. It puts the investment decision in their own hands and they can get much closer to the company during due diligence and ownership. Typically, when LPs invest alongside a fund, it needs a quick response as there are others wanting to co-invest. With the deal-by-deal model, it's more exclusive; they can get closer to the deal.\"\n\nDuke Street runs its co-investment programme like a club, with Almond explaining that some LPs prefer to support deals early on while others choose to come in later at syndication stage.\n\nAccording to Taylor, the selection process is still evolving. \"We're still learning and the landscape is changing. We had done lots of syndication when investing from a fund. Fund-of-funds were unable to do it at first because they couldn't pay fees and carry. But 18 months later they came back to us as their own needs are changing.\"\n\nFor Lonsdale however, its focus on the smaller end of the market means there is less demand for co-investment. \"At the small end of the market it's more attractive for LPs to be in a fund,\" says Gasparro. \"It would be difficult for them to do all of the admin required for smaller deals. So, to get exposure in the smaller, more specialist part of the market, a fund makes more sense.\"\n\nDargan also explains that, with LP commitments into its fund at around £10m or more, it wouldn't make sense for LPs to deploy that amount in the small-cap market through single deals, and therefore a pool is easier. \"When we were doing deals on a deal-by-deal basis they were often oversubscribed, but coming in on the fund means our investors are exposed to all of our deals. Our investors encouraged us to raise the fund because they want that lower-mid-market exposure,\" says Dargan.\n\nWhile Duke Street and Lonsdale are rare examples of GPs that have adopted both the fund and deal-by-deal approach, their different focuses mean the adoption of each strategy offers different advantages for LPs and target companies. In Lonsdale's case, while deal-by-deal gave the team a chance to build a track record and embed themselves within the market, its focus on smaller companies means a fund model is better-suited for LPs looking for exposure of this kind. For Duke Street, having been in the market for 18 years, it had built up a track record and necessary intermediary relationships. But what is more interesting is how the LP community has developed since Duke Street changed strategy. Back in 2012, who could have predicted the GP would be sitting in such a favourable position?\n\nDuke Street, the mid-market private equity firm, is leading a consortium to acquire Medi-Globe Corporation (Medi-Globe), a Germany-based medical devices business focused on minimally invasive surgery in gastroenterology and urology.\n\nThe Medi-Globe acquisition is Duke Street’s fifth standalone deal outside a traditional fund structure. The consortium partners include funds advised by DB Private Equity: Secondary Opportunities Fund III and other funds; Atnahs Capital, Brederode and Harwood Capital. Duke Street originated, negotiated and structured the transaction. Deutsche Bank joins Duke Street’s club of co-investors for the first time.\n\nHeadquartered in Achenmühle, Germany, Medi-Globe is a developer, manufacturer and distributor of disposable accessories for use in flexible endoscopy in the fields of gastroenterology and urology. In addition, the Group is a distributor of a wide range of hospital supplies to an expanding range of customers. Its main markets are in Germany and France, with developing businesses elsewhere in Europe, China, Japan and Brazil.\n\nMedi-Globe, a Delaware C private company, generated EBITDA of c. €16.6m in the 12 months to December 2015, on revenues of c. €120m.\n\nThe global medical technology (med tech) market is worth approximately $400bn and is growing at c.5% per annum, driven by changing demographics and advances in surgical techniques, with even faster growth in emerging markets. The minimally invasive (MI) gastroenterology and urological segments are set to outperform the market as MI procedures reduce time in hospital, improving both productivity and patient outcomes, and are perceived to be safer.\n\nCommenting on the investment, Charlie Troup, Managing Partner at Duke Street, said:\n\n“Medi-Globe is a local hero in the German med-tech market because of its consistently strong product quality and innovation, high service levels and excellent clinical relationships. These attributes are also driving fast growth in emerging markets. Duke Street is excited to be making a significant investment in this large and growing sector. We have an excellent record of successfully building companies in the healthcare market, through value-creating acquisitions, organic growth and operational improvement.”\n\nDirk Steindorf, Chief Executive of Medi-Globe, added:\n\n“Medi-Globe is looking forward to working closely with Duke Street as it supports the group through its next phase of growth. Combining our international market opportunity and strong reputation with our new investor’s record of value creation in healthcare makes a formidable partnership.”\n\nGerald Glasauer, Managing Director of GUB Wagniskapital, anchor shareholder of Medi-Globe, said:\n\n“Since 2013 the main shareholders have screened the market to find the best fitting buyer for Medi-Globe. The shareholders received a considerable number of offers from interested parties and came to the conclusion that Duke Street and its consortium would be the best fit. We are confident that Medi-Globe, with its new owner Duke Street, will develop further and prosper. We wish them all the best.”\n\nDuke Street was advised on this transaction by Macquarie, DLA and White & Case.\n\nThe main shareholders initiating the sale were represented by McDermott Will & Emery, Munich and Washington DC.\n\nThe Original Factory Shop (“TOFS”), the UK’s national discount department store, is pleased to announce sales growth of 7.1% and an increase of 50% in pre-exceptional EBITDA for the year ended 31st March 2015.\n\nFinancial highlights\n\nThe Company has witnessed a strong ongoing performance, which provides a solid platform for future growth\n\nTotal sales were up 7.1% (LfL sales up 4.2%)\n\nPre-exceptional EBITDA increased 50% YoY to £14.2m\n\nAgreed new banking facilities of £35m\n\nOperational highlights\n\nThe business model has successfully evolved as a direct result of a significant strengthening of the Executive management, more targeted investment into the portfolio, and a continued focus on the product proposition\n\nOpened 11 stores – reaching 201 at year end (206 to date)\n\nOur first retail park destination\n\nEntry into larger towns – Salisbury and Aylesbury\n\nExpansion of smaller format stores\n\nIncreased operational capacity of existing warehouse\n\nTrebled investment into existing store estate, including re-fits and re-models\n\nInvestment in leadership – six new director appointments across the business\n\nRolling out new concessions into stores\n\nCompetitive focus on price to ensure exceptional value\n\nCategory performance\n\nThe business remains strong, with a very robust underlying general merchandise performance, and particular emphasis on homewares, clothing and footwear\n\nA focus on fashion and beauty\n\nIn line with an increased focus on the fashion segment, including a more fashion-led marketing approach, ladies wear sales increased 10% LfL to record levels. The Company signed over 50 new brand partnerships, primarily across fashion-led departments, including Pretty Polly, Weird Fish and Jeff Banks. Best sellers included jeans, jeggings and Sloggis. Footwear also had a good year, rising 22% LfL, with branded trainers as top sellers.\n\nBeauty performed strongly overall with double digit growth in each division – including skin care, fragrance and cosmetics – reflecting a number of new brand partnerships, including Jimmy Choo fragrance.\n\nBoost in home and gardening\n\nWhilst sales increased across the business, performance in the gardening segment stood out with impressive 47% growth, driven by an aggressive pricing strategy and favourable weather conditions in the Spring and early Summer.\n\nHomewares also had a good year, up 15%. A number of new brand partnerships included celebrity chefs, Jamie Oliver and James Martin, and bedding specialists, Julian Charles and Fogarty.\n\nCommenting on the results, Tony Page, CEO of The Original Factory Shop said:\n\n“We’re very pleased with our performance.
