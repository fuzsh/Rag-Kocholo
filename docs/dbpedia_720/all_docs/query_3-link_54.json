        "text": "The main goal of this paper is to check whether Prototype Theory can be applied to the analysis of the English verbs of motion. More precisely, the paper attempts to apply various elements of S.G. Pulman’s (1983) model of prototype effect testing to a semantic analysis of the English motion verbs (as defined and selected in Miller 1972 and Levin 1993). The methods of analysis include prototypicality rating tests previously used by psychologists (Rosch 1975a, b, Rosch and Lloyd 1978, inter alia), frequency tests and corpus data analysis. The results show that a semantic analysis of verbs based on Prototype Theory is possible, though it has certain constraints. On the whole, there is a steady semantic pattern related to the obtained category structure of motion verbs: the more generic verbs seem to be closer to the centre and, as we move towards the periphery, the verbs tend to be more specific.\n\nThis paper examines intersections of history and memory in recent writings by Anne Enright to map out differences, however subtle, in the English original texts and their German translations. The argument demonstrates that translations can destabilize notions of history and of individual, national or religious identity not only in the cultures that receive them, as Lawrence Venuti has recurrently argued, but also in the source cultures. Apart from representations of history, memory and identity in Enright’s literary oeuvre, another important area of enquiry in this paper is the identity of literary originals compared to their translated versions. Key questions this paper addresses include the following: How can what is supposedly unique to Enright’s literary style as well as to the Irish cultural tradition be transferred into a German-speaking linguistic, historical and cultural environment? What has to be captured and what can be surrendered for literary translation to be “faithful” and/or ethical? And how can we determine the ownership of literary texts and ideas, which is both compromised and enriched by translation? These questions are important in- and outside the literary marketplace in a world in which personal boundaries as well as boundaries of time and space are constantly re-negotiated.\n\nDICTION SHIFT IN AMBONESE MALAY PANTUN IN MALUKU Falantino Eryk Latupapua Pattimura University Indonesia Grace Somelok Pattimura University Indonesia Novita Tabelessy Pattimura University Indonesia Abstract Some studies suggest that the practice of pantun tradition as an expression of oral cultural in the Ambon Malay speakers community is increasingly unpopular. This phenomenon is supported by the fact that the tradition is rarely performed and the texts of Ambon Malay pantun are rarely found, whether in the form of books or other manuscripts. In manuscripts or books containing Ambon Malay pantuns still and read and delivered nowadays, there are some pantun that are no longer obedient to the standard structure of pantun, like rhymes and stanza. In addition, there are many rhymes that appear to be newly created by some writers, so that the dictionary words choice no longer seem to heed the pantun. This paper aims to unveil the phenomenon of the shift of diction or the choice of words in Ambonese pantun through the poetic theoretical approach. In addition to indicating a change or linguistic shift in the Ambon Malay pantun, this paper is also expected to mark the change or shift of poetics of the Malay pantun as an oral tradition or oral literature.\n\nThe present article was written as part of the PhD dissertation entitled “An analysis regarding the evolution of James Joyce’s writing style in ‘Dubliners’, ‘A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man’ and ‘Ulysses’ and the strategies of translating it into Romanian”. The research starts from the hypothesis that a perfect rendition in a different language of a literary text of this type is nothing more than a utopia. However, a translator should always intend to achieve an equilibrium between the author’s intentions, the form, the content and the target culture. In “Ulysses”, James Joyce experiments with language, abandoning the definition of sense and revolutionises the art of expressing thoughts through words. The current work will concentrate on the thorough analysis of adjectival and adverbial collocations conceptualized in the ninth chapter of “Ulysses”. Our purpose is to investigate how Mircea Ivănescu’s Romanian translation deals with collocations and especially with those that ...\n\nThe aim of this paper is to explore the differences between online magazine headlines designated for mainly female audience and those designated predominantly for male audience. The relationship between language and gender has been in the focus of many scholars’ research and various approaches were adopted to interpret its features, e.g. the deficit approach, difference approach and dynamic or social constructionist approach (Arvidsson 2009). What is common to all of these approaches is that they acknowledge the existence of gender based linguistic differences and the fact that women and men actually do use different languages. Some scholars even use the expression genderlect to refer to a language variety stereotypically associated with male of female speech (Perry et al. 1992). This research will be carried out from the dynamic viewpoint, meaning that gender will be seen as a performed and through language use constructed, rather than a given category. Kadlecová states that “ideologies are carried by different social groups and are encoded in written and spoken discourse”(in Vybíralová 2009: 14), and, therefore lifestyle magazines, even though frequently labelled as stereotypical and trite, may been seen as an element of gender construction in the mass media. For the purpose of this small-scale case study a special corpus is comprised consisting of Cosmopolitan and FHM magazine headlines, acquired on the respective web sites throughout three months. News headlines are particularly interesting, and can even be categorised as a distinct sub-genre in the overall media discourse (Bell 1991), especially when one takes into account the complexity of their specific functions. A headline is commonly constructed as an “extremely short, economical text, in such a way as to inform the reader about the content of the article, while at the same time, by arousing his/her curiosity, to persuade them to read the whole article”, and often also take the role of “slogans in advertisements – that of attracting the attention and encouraging the potential consumer to buy the advertised product” (Silaški 2009: 60). The headlines found in the online versions of magazines will be analysed on a syntactic, lexical, semantic and pragmatic level. Findings on the Cosmopolitan and FHM headlines will be contrasted with regards to the audience they are predominately aimed at. When interpreting the linguistic differences, it is important to have in mind that the corpus does not present the actual instances of women's and men's language, but rather the instances of language for women and men, which also play a significant role in gender identity formation."
