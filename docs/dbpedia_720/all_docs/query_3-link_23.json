DEEP general presentation Brief project overview Jesús Marco de Lucas, Álvaro López García {marco,aloga}@ifca.unican.es Spanish National Research Council DEEP & XDC Kick of Meeting Bologna, Italy January 24, 2018\n\n2. https://deep-hybrid-datacloud.eu Jan 24, 2018 2/12 DEEP-Hybrid-DataCloud: context ● H2020 project, EINFRA-21 call – Topic: Platorm-driven e-Infrastructure towards the European Open Science Cloud – Scope: Computng e-infrastructure with extreme large datasets ● (…) prototypes to cope with very large data resources (...) ● (…) sofware layers supportng applicatons such as modelling, simulaton, patern recogniton, visualisaton, etc. (...) ● (…) supported by robust mathematcal methods and tools (...) ● (…) Clean slate approaches to high-performance computng and data management (…) ● DEEP-Hybrid-DatCloud: Designing and Enabling E-Infrastructures for intensive data Processing in a Hybrid DataCloud – Started as a spin-of project (together with XDC) from INDIGO-DataCloud technologies – Submited in March 2017 – Started November 1st 2017 – Grant agreement number 777435 ● Global objectie: Promote the use of intensiie computnn seriices by diferent research communites and areas, an the support by the corresponding e-Infrastructure providers and open source projects\n\n3. https://deep-hybrid-datacloud.eu Jan 24, 2018 3/12 DEEP project objectives ● Focus on intensiie computnn techniques for the analysis of iery larne datasets considering demanding use cases – Pilot applicatons from diferent research communites – Three techniques of wide interest: deep learning, post processing and on-line analysis of data streams – Improved list of requirements for e-Infrastructures → future generaton ● Eiolie up to producton level intensiie computnn seriices exploitng specialized hardware – New solutons to beter interact with bare metal resources in the cloud – Use of hardware accelerators such as GPUs and low-latency interconnects ● Intenrate intensive computng services under a hybrid cloud approach – Assuring interoperability with existng EOSC – Expanding over multple IaaS using high level networking technologies – Enrich orchestraton tools for supportng multple services and providers ● Defne a “DEEP as a Seriice” soluton to ofer an adequate integraton path to developers of fnal applicatons – Implement a catalon of the most useful services and applicatons as well defned buildinn blocks – Ofer a DeiOps approach for the applicaton development ● Analyse the complementarity with other onnoinn projects targetng added value services for the cloud – In partcular those related to the management of extremely large datasets – Explore diferent e-Infrastructures and complementary services – Identfcaton, integraton and/or co-development of missing functonalites\n\n4. https://deep-hybrid-datacloud.eu Jan 24, 2018 4/12 DEEP pilot use cases ● Three techniques of wide interest, involving – Large, heterogeneous data sets – Intensive computng demands that would beneft from using hardware accelerators (GPUs, low latency interconnects) ● Deep learning – Pilot cases: stem cells, biodiversity applicatons, medical image – Provide a general, distributed architecture and pipeline to train deep learning (and other) models ● Post-processing – Pilot cases: post-processing of HPC simulatons – Flexible pipeline for the analysis of simulaton data generated at HPC resources ● On-line analysis of data streams – Pilot case: intrusion detecton systems – Provide an architecture able to analyze massive on-line data streams, also with historical records\n\n5. https://deep-hybrid-datacloud.eu Jan 24, 2018 5/12 DEEP consortium ● Balanced set of partners – Strong technological background on development, implementaton, deployment and operaton of federated e-Infrastructures ● 9 academic partners – CSIC, LIP, INFN, PSNC, KIT, UPV, CESNET, IISAS, HMGU ● 1 industrial partner – Atos ● 6 countries – Spain, Italy, Poland, Germany, Czech Republic, Slovakia\n\n6. https://deep-hybrid-datacloud.eu Jan 24, 2018 6/12 WP leaders and deputies ● WP1 (NA): Project Management and Exploitaton – Project oversight, quality management, admin, etc. – Leader: CSIC, deputy: Atos ● WP2 (NA): Intensive Computng Pilot Applicatons – Defniton and understanding of pilot usage scenarios – Leader: HMGU, deputy: KIT ● WP3 (SA): Testbed and Integraton with EOSC services – Project service actvites: testbeds, tools, integratons – Leader: LIP, deputy: PSNC ● WP4 (JRA): Accelerated High Performance Computng in the Cloud – Support for accelerators and HPC resources – Leader: IISAS, deputy: INFN ● WP5 (JRA): High Level Hybrid Cloud solutons – Platorm provisioning, delivering the executon platorm for WPP5 – Leader: INFN, deputy: CESNET ● WP6 (JRA): DEEP as a Service – Deliver fnal soluton to the users – Leader: CSIC, deputy: UPV ● WP7: Ethics requirements – Leader: CSIC\n\n7. https://deep-hybrid-datacloud.eu Jan 24, 2018 7/12 Project governance ● Steering Commitee – Driving the project executon ● Consortum Assembly – Legal project partners – Strategic project decisions ● Cooperaton Open Board – Partners and stakeholders from Europe and relevant projects and initatves – Interact with Steering Commitee to defne the agenda, interests and proposals for discussion ● Advisory Board – External board – Integrated by experts from relevant stakeholders\n\n8. https://deep-hybrid-datacloud.eu Jan 24, 2018 8/12 INDIGO Components and evolution (I) ● INDIGO Orchestrator – Hybrid support on multple sites – Support to specifying specialized computng hardware ● Infrastructure Mananer – Hybrid Clouds support involving specialized computng hardware ● uDocker – Support for GPUs and specialized hardware to be further developed ● Cloud Informaton System – Missing informaton about accelerators or special hardware at a provider – React faster to changes in the infrastructure (faster publicaton and propagaton of informaton)\n\n9. https://deep-hybrid-datacloud.eu Jan 24, 2018 9/12 INDIGO Components and evolution (I) ● OpenStack/OpenNebula – Extensions be needed to properly support accelerators: improving scheduling strategies, easier confguraton and improved documentaton. ● PaaS layer – Accelerator support ● Docker – Use as container technology for applicatons ● LXC – Use as alternatve hypervisor ● Ansible – Contextualizaton and confguraton tool, further development of modules ● INDIGO Virtual Router – Improvements to reach producton level\n\n10. https://deep-hybrid-datacloud.eu Jan 24, 2018 10/12 DEEP work programme ● WPe have defned diferent phases for the project ● Plan and requirements (Nov 2017 – Jan 2018) ● Inital desinn (Feb – Apr 2018) ● First prototype (May – Oct 2018) – in-situ integraton meetng to take place: conclude the integraton of the frst testbed prototype, supportng at least two inital pilot applicatons – June 2018: Santander Meetng ● Second prototype – Improvement of design and proposed solutons (frst quarter of 2019) – Integraton towards a “second prototype” (mid 2019) ● Full Pilot testbed – Integraton of all the Pilot applicatons and their tuning for high performance ● Promoton and exploitaton (2020) – Improve the support and fnal quality of the solutons – Promote the exploitaton in the EOSC framework, following the integraton actvites\n\n11.
