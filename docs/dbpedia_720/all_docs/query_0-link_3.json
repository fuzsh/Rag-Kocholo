That was two years ago, a chance meeting, but they recognised each other from a casual introduction much earlier. A quiet courtship since will lead to their wedding on December 14. Mark’s career is flourishing as an actor, recording artist and guitarist, but has taken him constantly away from Brisbane and Sally. Their romance continued despite long absences and costly interstate flights. Mark is best known to television audiences for his part as Georgie Saint in The Young Doctors. The wedding will be held in a suburban garden setting in Brisbane. The quiet service will in¬ volve only the families — Mark’s brother John Hem¬ brow is best man, and Sally’s brother Mark Butterfield will play the French horn. “We do not want the wed¬ ding to be too public,’’ said Sally. The engagement has been a well-kept secret. When Mark began working with the Queensland Theatre Company at 18, he played the leading role in Springle, a play written to celebrate 100 years of education in Queensland. He and Sally were introduc¬ ed while he was doing Springle at a school workshop. It was the last year of school for Sally and she went to study opera at the Queensland Con- servatorium of Music. She also studies violin and piano. Mark is recording two of his songs on a single to be released early next year. While now working in theatre in Sydney he will also have parts in two musical pro¬ grams being recorded at ABC- TV studios. Mark, 23, and Sally, 19, plan to live in Sydney after they complete a tour with their new play Razz. Work on the play will start after a two-week honeymoon. Razz is a musical fantasy written by Mark and script¬ writer David Worthington. It is the story of a spaceship that visits the planets. The audiences are invited to join the ship.. The play, sponsored by the Queensland Arts Council, will be seen throughout Queensland high schools star¬ ting in February next year. Mark will play the lead character, Skid, and Sally is Skid’s girl friend Gabble. Mark will continue his singing and acting career next year. — MERY WARREN • MARK HEMBROW (left) with Sally Butterfield, the girl who's to be his wife.

It meant another big name was about to arrive on stage at the 1978 TV WEEK King Of Pop Awards . . . and it was another step closer to the mo¬ ment for which most of the keyed-up audience had been waiting. Behind that curtain, wat¬ ching the proceedings on a TV monitor was Leif Garrett. Leif had arrived at the venue, Ashton's big top, in an armored car ... and no wonder! When he hit the stage to sing his new single, I Was Made For Dancin', and present several awards, he and King Of Pop host Glenn Shorrock were literally drowned out by the reaction. One quick glance at his adoring audience, and Leif promptly decided that he'd leave by armored car as well. He and British songbird, the beguiling Kate Bush, headlined this year's awards and ap¬ peared at the top of a list which represented the biggest line-up of pop talent ever assembled under one roof in Australia. The cream of Australian rock 'n' roll turned out, making it a fitting celebration of the 10th anniversary of the coun¬ try's premier music awards. They were all there — Glenn Shorrock's fellow members of the Little River Band, John Paul Young, Marcia Hines, Sherbet, Jon English, Darryl Cotton, Dragon members Paul Hewson and Robert Taylor . . . the list goes on. They wore everything from suits to sandshoes, denim to diamonds. And watching them from the audience were names such as the first King Of Pop, Nor- mie Rowe, Sullivans stars Richard Morgan, Steven Tan¬ dy, Susan Hannaford and Nick Holland, Young Doctors heart- throb Tony Alvarez, zany TV lady Denise Drysdale, outrageous John-Michael Howson and a throng of televi¬ sion and recording industry ex¬ ecutives. Behind the three rings under the big top, more than 1000 lights spelt out the words \"King Of Pop\". Beside that, a giant screen gave the audience some idea of what two million other Australians were seeing on the Nine Network across Australia. John Paul Young — he was one of the sandshoes and denim crowd — spent most of his time backstage when he wasn't accepting awards. He and the All Stars per¬ formed Love Is In The Air . . . then collected an award for the song as Most Popular Australian Single. JPY was to return to the stage near the end of the show to be presented with the King Of Pop crown. Queen Of Pop, Marcia Hines, arrived at the big top virtually direct from Los Angeles, but still managed to look stunning in a soft pink, satin sheath dress and pants . . . with lots of glitter. At the after show-party, Marcia's energy seemed to in¬ crease as the night raged on. She virtually took over from the DJ providing the music and was the star attraction on the dance floor. The man who linked the whole two hours of the fast moving awards presentation, Glenn Shorrock, handled his task with ease that belied the fact that he is a singer in a highly successful band and not an experienced TV compere. Even a typical awards show mix-up, when Kate Bush was handed the wrong envelope when she was announcing Best Australian Songwriter award, couldn't throw Glenn. \"That happens at a circus,\" he said, gazing wryly around the big top. \"There are only two million people watching . . . that's alright.\" Even Daryl Braithwaite, whose three-year reign as King Of Pop ended with the crown¬ ing of JPY, couldn't look unhappy. \"In one way I'm glad I didn't get the award, but in another way it's a bit sad,\" Daryl said. \"Sherbet won the Most Popular Group Award and everyone in the band feels great about that. \"It was the best King Of Pop ever. . Or, as Leif Garrett said: \"It was great. The reaction was out of this world and I think the show was as good as anything that comes out of America.\" - LAWRIE MASTERSON and HOWARD DUDDING • FROM BELOW, clockwise: A hysterical young fan is comforted by host Glenn Shorrock; The Queen, Mar¬ cia Hines, sings her latest single; Sherbet's Daryl Braithwaite; special guest Kate Bush; King and Queen, John Paul Young and Marcia, with Kate. MORE — PAGES 10-11 OCTOBER 28, 1978— TV WEEK—Page 7 This coming week sees the concluding episodes of Seven's history-making serial Against The Wind. What now for its two stars? JON RETURNS TO HIS FIRST LOVE - ROCK! FRESH FROM rave reviews for his role as Jonathan Garrett in the Seven Net¬ work blockbuster Against The Wind, Jon English has tossed in acting for the time being at least to con¬ centrate on his first love — rock’n’roll. Convinced that he should “get back to the basics’’, Jon has been on a whistlestop tour of New South Wales pro¬ moting his latest album, Words Are Not Enough. He means what he says when he talks about being a singer first and an actor second. He doesn’t subscribe to false modesty but, at the same time, the reviews and reaction to Against The Wind have taken him a little by surprise. “I was happy with what I did in the series, ’ ’ Jon says. “But I certainly don’t think of myself as an actor yet. . Maybe one day, but I’ve got a lot to learn before I could call myself an actor and be honest about it. “Although, I suppose being a singer helps because getting up there and performing a song is acting in a way. Jon says that any future he might have as an actor is uncertain at the moment. He admits there have been other approaches, but says that roles he’d be capable of handl¬ ing right now are limited. “Whdn I was shown the scripts of Against The Wind and they told me I was going to be the hero my first reaction was, ‘what are the villains go¬ ing to look like’, ’’ Jon says. “But right from the start I felt a glow about that story. I knew it was going to work. “It was obvious that it was a great story and that it was go¬ ing to be done well.’’ But, acting aside, the music business looks as bright as ever for Jon. His single, Words Are Not Enough, has reached gold sales figures and Jon reveals that his management and Phonogram Records have negotiated a generous advance from an overseas record com¬ pany to cover the recording of three more albums without going into the red. “I honestly can’t tell you right now who the overseas company is, ’ ’ said Jon. “But it looks like a good deal. It means in effect that stantly being asked when he’s going to tour overseas. And like John Paul, Jon replies: “When I’m asked.’’ Jon, who came to Australia from Britain when he was 13, is quite happy to stay here and By HOWARD PUDDING we’ll be able to do at least three more albums and have them released overseas without worrying about money.’’ Like his close mate, the TV WEEK King Of Pop John Paul Young, Jon English is con- his musical ambitions, while long-reaching, don’t necessarily include knocking on doors around the west coast of America. “At the moment I’m plann¬ ing to go to England later in the year — mainly to take Carmen (his wife) for a holi¬ day,’’ he says. “But we’re looking at some possible work there and I’d love to take the band with me. “But I don’t have any illu¬ sions. The music business in England at the moment is very topsy turvy and they don’t seem to know what they want. “I’m quite happy to stay in Australia and release records overseas without necessarily being there. “After all, this is home now.’’ * ...WHILE MARY YEARNS TO RETURN TO AUSTRALIA “I’M OPEN to all sugges¬ tions to return,” was the good news for Australian film and television pro¬ ducers from Against The Wind star, Mary Larkin, this week. Speaking in London she said: “If the script and the director were right, I would be very interested in other offers from Australia. “And I just like Australia so much that I would love to go back.’’ A bad bout of bronchitis has kept Mary, 30, away from any work since she returned to London in early September. She has been allowed to move about only for the past two weeks, under doctor’s orders. But Mary is now considering both stage and television of¬ fers about which she is loath to talk. “You don’t like saying anything until you actually decide to accept an offer. Just in case, because you don’t like to let people down,’’ she said. How had she liked playing Mary Mulvane? “It wasn’t a taxing role emotionally. I found it an easy part to play because she was always so sympathetic. “Her reactions to things were very easy to understand. I could play the part from in¬ stinct rather than have to prepare myself emotionally. Much of the history covered in the series was new territory to the Dublin-born actress. “I knew a little bit, but ended up finding out a great deal more,’’ she said. “I did quite a lot of research and read a bit about the period. But really it was a whole new area for me as a lot of it just wasn’t given a great deal of importance, not on this side of the world, when I was at school.’’ From JOHN BYRNE in London And was she surprised that a historical series such as Against The Wind had taken off so strongly? “It has an historical basis, but the emo¬ tional storyline is so powerful that I would have been sur¬ prised if it hadn’t caught the imagination of the viewers,’’ Mary said in a voice ravaged by nearly five weeks of illness. “But I’m still very pleased that it has gone so high in the ratings. And I’ve had loads of letters from people and they all seemed to have loved it . . . that’s very nice when you work hard at something. ’’ And she thought that the series gave more than just 13 episodes of television. “I’ve also had quite a lot of letters from people who’ve said they have never thought about their ancestry and now they are all researching and finding that they came out on convict ships — and they’re all very proud of it. “The main thing that keeps recurring in the letters is that the series has made many peo¬ ple proud to be Australian and I think that’s wonderful. Getting back to future plans, she said: “I never say what one would like to do because, in this business, you end up doing the most unex¬ pected things. “If somebody said a year ago that I would have been to Australia and back I wouldn’t have believed them. But I would love to work there again because I enjoyed it so much. “Work on Against The Wind was taxing in a physical sense. We worked quite heavy weeks, the days were long and one got physically tired. But I seemed to slip into the role. ’ ’ Now Mary intends looking at her offers — and maybe waiting for a voice with an Australian accent on the phone. * • JON ENGLISH and Mary Larkin in their memorable wedding scene from Against The Wind.

IT WAS . . . ONE RESTLESS YEAR LATER CHAMPAGNE FLOWED when the cast and crew of The Restless Years celebrated the show’s first anniversary earlier this- month. A wing-ding party was thrown in the TEN10, Sydney, studios for everyone con¬ nected with the 0-10 Network soap opera and their invited guests. Members of the cast, old and new, were joined by fellow TEN10 celebrities and quiz show Blankety Blanks regulars to celebrate The Restless Years’ first birthday. The show the critics said would never last has not only survived 12 months in produc¬ tion, but become one of the country’s top rating television programs. The future of TRY is also secure — only recently the general manager of TEN10, Mr. Ian Kennon, signed a con¬ tract on behalf of the 0-10 Network to take the soap opera for another year. He confirmed this in a speech to party guests when he said: “I am confident that this time next year everyone will be here again — to celebrate the second birthday of TRY.” Mr. Kennon made the point that the show employed 21 ac¬ tors and actresses on a full¬ time basis and, over the past year, had given work to about 400 others. The young stars of TRY danced the night away to the beat of a four-piece band and were aided and abetted by the likes of Ugly Dave Gray and his partner Helen Stock, Blankety Blanks regulars Joe Hasham, Belinda Giblin and John Paul Young and TEN10 newsreaders Bernadette Hughson and Katrina Lee. — CHRISTINE RICHTER • ABOVE: Malcolm Thompson and Julieanne Newbould discuss old times with Tina Grenville (right) who is a member of the original The Restless Years cast and will soon return to the show. • BELOW: TEN10 personality and newsreader Bernadette Hughson (left) chats to Blankety Blanks regulars Joe Hasham and Belinda Giblin, • ABOVE: Jeanie Drynan, a star of 0-10's axed Chopper Squad, gets into the swing of things with Restless Years heart-throb Sonny Blake. • LEFT: Zoe Bertram cuts the gigantic birthday cake as Restless Years stars (I, to r.)

Not only was Glenn largely responsible for making these the best King Of Pop Awards ever, through his almost impeccable com¬ pering, but he also entertained out front of the Little River Band and played controller to the enthusiastic young audience. THANKS LEIF, KATE, GLENN WHAT A marvellous night King Of Pop turned out to be . . . The atmosphere at the awards was electric. And the tightness and spon¬ taneity of the end product made them our most successful awards ever. I must admit that like many of the pro¬ duction crew, I was a nervous wreck both before and during the show. This was the first time we had tried anything so ambitious with King Of Pop . . . holding it inside a circus tent and allowing more than 1000 over- enthusiastic fans within ripping reach of celebrity guests. I was amazed at how composed the stars managed to look while the girls screamed and surged and screamed, straining the meagre last line of defence between the bleachers and the VIP. We all-had visions of being engulfed by a tide of uncontrollable Leif Garrett fans. Many people are to be congratulated on the overwhelming success of the awards night. . . Most of all Leif Garrett, whose profes¬ sionalism and superb performance in a potentially dangerous atmosphere was far beyond the expectations of someone his age. And to Kate Bush, who added necessary charm to the proceedings. What a complementary pair she and Leif made! But now to an accolade that defies ade¬ quate description . . . because it belongs to someone who exceeded our most am¬ bitious expectations . . . Host Glenn Shorrock. For someone tackling such a nerve- racking job for the first time, he was superb. Hours after the show my ears were still ringing with heaped praise for his performance. Page 16—TV WEEK—OCTOBER 28, 1978 Tv We now have designs to make him the Bert Newton of the pop world. And there’s no greater professional praise than that! Finally, let me praise GTV9’s produc¬ tion crew who put together the best possible awards show . . . LIVE and from an almost experimental venue. Producer Lesley Shaw and director Peter Faiman reached the pinnacle of live TV presentation. Their crew helped lift them there. I hope you enjoyed the show. ★ ★ ★ WHILE ON the subject, I’d like to thank the ABC and the Countdown producers for their support of the King Of Pop Awards. For obvious reasons they can’t plug TV WEEK, but their overwhelming support for the awards themselves help make this a great industry event. But for a few nonentities who seek publicity through any controversy that might follow-their attempted sabotage, everyone who has a love and interest in pop music lends support. Consequently, we have a great night. But back to Countdown. Their show following King Of Pop was great. And while they continue with such a high standard, the future growth of the Australian pop industry seems assured. The same goes for Seven’s Night Moves and Sounds Unlimited. * -TONY JOHNSTON OUR KING Of Pop Photographers were: JOHN KEESING, ROB AUSTEN, DAVE MASON, GREG NOAKES and GEORGE HAIG.

WSON JOHN-MICHAEL SALUTES J. O'K THE AUSSIE WHO MADE IT NOBODY had ever seen anything like it before. Because nothing like it had happened before. Enough energy to light a couple of cities, enough noise to blast off a rocket, enough excitement to charge up a jet. It was wild, it was wonderful, it was Johnny O’Keefe. Until J. O’K we went along to the barn¬ like Festival Hall in Melbourne, or the tin shed that was Sydney’s stadium to see the predictable fare from America. The one-hit wonders who had slicked back hair, smooth well-tailored clothes, perfect skin, perfect smiles, perfect teeth. Somewhere in Hollywood there must have been a processing factory churning out the fifties pop stars who all looked alike, a whole series of Ken dolls, and who all sang songs that usually revolved around: (a) broken hearts, # (b) high school dances; (c) somebody telling about somebody see¬ ing somebody with somebody. We came to expect that these ex¬ ponents of the art of slush would always be The Stars and that glamor and success would always come to us from “overseas”. Australians didn’t have what it took to be plastic enough for the record tycoons or the radio announcers (disc jockeys were yet to be created). Girls in their teens mooned endlessly over Fabian or Tab or somebody else who sounded like a soft drink and had about as much zap. Boys in their teens were constantly in¬ timidated by these un-pimpled creatures who dressed in gear that must have cost a mint and had legions of girls constantly swooning at their sneakers. And then Lee Gordon put Johnny O’Keefe on as a supporting act with some imports and nothing was the same again. He got us out of our seats, he got us dancing in the aisles, he got us yelling, shouting and screaming for more, more, more. And more was what he gave us. He plugged into the energy of the fans and we plugged into his personality. He got us moving, he got us shaking, he got us feeling like something was really hap¬ pening to us. He got us to see that even an Aussie could make it. I think we all loved him because he was an Aussie doing it here and making it big as much as we loved the energy and en¬ thusiasm of his performance. He \"started a revolution. Kids who felt that they would never make it because they weren’t American or came from “overseas” suddenly got the urge and the guts to try. And then we started to see the birth of • AN HISTORIC photo . . . Here Is Johnny O'Keefe during his last ever television appearance. He was a special guest on the first Steve Ray¬ mond Show, which paid tribute to 22 years of television. J.O'K saw most of them, and as the photo shows . . . he was one of its most dapper stars. the Australian pop industry. Other stars were born, the infant TV industry started pushing Oz pop shows. They were made on a shoe string budget but to us they were better than anything that came out of Tinsel Town because they were our shows with our very own stars. Six O’clock Rock, Sing, Sing, Sing, Bandstand. They became part of our lives. It’s still hard to be a success today, but at least there is the opportunity to try. Before the Wild One there wasn’t even the opportunity. He fought the convention that Australians couldn’t succeed in their own country and he won. And he even suc¬ ceeded in getting radio stations to play Oz records, which was about the hardest battle he fought. Every kid who picks up a musical in¬ strument today, who starts warbling a pop song, who starts scrawling out a few notes or a couple of lyrics has Johnny to thank for the mere glimmer of a chance that they may succeed. In sorrow on hearing about his untime¬ ly passing I remembered all the good times J.O’K had given me and my friends. That outrageous leopard skin suit, the bouncing energy, the laughs and the cheers . . . and how we would talk about him for hours afterwards. He really was something. He really was unforgettable. He was a great enter¬ tainer. A great gentleman. He was J.O’K. * OCTOBER 28, 1978—TV WEEK—Page 17 I’m still a Vegemite kid I still like my VEGEMITE Yeast Extract.

Cheryl Ladd, Jadyn Smith and Kate Jackson (above, right) are most upset . . . after all they're earning only $15,000 to $20,000 an episode! HIGH-PRICED FARRAH SEES THE.. ANGELS IN A RAGE ONE OF the first lessons we learn here is that everything in Hollywood has two prices. One is the price they tell you and the other the real one. It’s a lesson Charlie’s Angels Kate Jackson, Jaclyn Smith and Cheryl Ladd have just learned, too. They have been up in arms over reports that Farrah Fawcett-Majors returned to the hit series at $70,000 a show. “We took it up with the producers and they assured us all the girls were in the same $15,000 to $20,000 a show range,” one of their agents confided to us, “and believe me, we didn’t simply take their word for it. ” But apparently that isn’t the only area where Farrah’s price has been in¬ flated. Her new hair shampoo, the first of a line of cosmetics produced under her multi-million dollar Faberge con¬ tract, isn’t exactly making the cash register ring. “It’s one of the most expensive sham¬ poos we sell,” one department store buyer told us, “and the kids into the Farrah thing simply can’t afford it”. ★ ★ ★ THE ONE thing about Hollywood that never ceases to amaze us is the number of sins it can dismiss as “artistic dif¬ ferences”. The latest is nepotism. Only hours before the cameras were to roll on producer Blake Edward’s Ten, George Segal quit the comedy in a mighty huff. “They had irreconcilable artistic dif¬ ferences,” George’s agent Guy McElwaine enlightened us eager colum¬ nists. “I don’t, however, feel it’s my position to verbalise what those artistic differences are.” If you’re still with us, those dif¬ ferences began when Blake agreed to hire George’s wife Marion as an associate producer (chair warmer) but baulked when she insisted she be made assistant editor (real power) instead. By the way, Blake’s wife is Julie Andrews who is playing — sorry, was playing — George’s mistress in the ^ movie. ★ ★ ★ r HOLOCAUST WON Meryl Streep an L. Emmy Award, long overdue recognition as an actress among Hollywood pro- ducers, and a spate of movies including * the plum role opposite Dustin Hoffman r in Kramer Vs Kramer. l Yet Meryl’s memories of the mini¬ series are mostly painful ones. Throughout the long months of location filming in Europe she was nursing her liye-in boy friend who died of cancer soon after their return here. But if there can be a happy ending to such a story, it took place the other day. Meryl married sculptor Donald Gummer. ★ ★ ★ NO LESS surprising is Peter Falk looking almost tailored these days. We still wouldn’t call him a fashion plate, but Pete in a suit a size either side of his correct fit is something to be noted. The credit for this, as you’ve pro- ■ bably guessed, belongs to wife Shera Danese and even Pete remains a little thunderstruck over his transformation. “She really is a marvel,” he confided to us. “She went out and bought me all these great suits. It would never have occurred to me to go shopping. ’ ’ ★ ★ ★ OF COURSE, all of us like to treat ourselves occasionally. It’s just that John Travolta can afford bigger treats than most of us. He has added a Rockwell Commander 114 (a mere $90,000 with optional equipment) to his fleet of aircraft that includes a DC3 and single-engine Air- coupe. “Flying is the perfect release for me,” he said. “When pressures get to me, I can fly and come down calm and relaxed. ” Now you know how the other half lives.

Are You Being Served?, the comedy series about life in a department store, ran for two years in Britain without causing much of a stir among viewers. But when the fifth series ended, it had reached third spot on the British televi¬ sion popularity ratings with an estimated audience of around 24 million peo¬ ple. This is the highest a BBC comedy series has reached since Porridge, starring Ron¬ nie Barker, which climbed to number two. But Are You Being Served?. the behind the scenes antics of a group of Grace Bros, shop assistants, is the strangest suc¬ cess story for years when you consider the fifth series was a mixture of repeats and new programs. From our London Bureau Page 20—TV WEEK—OCTOBER 28, 1978 It has brought fame to former small-part players such as Mollie Sugden, who plays the snooty, blue-rinsed battleaxe Mrs. Slocombe, Frank Thornton, who plays the stuffy Capt. Peacock, and the late Arthur Brough, who played old Mr. Grainger. They became stars after toiling for years as supports. The wildest bit of all, though, is John Inman, who can’t walk down the street without being mobbed by screaming fans. For Mollie, the reaction is similar: “For at least two years after we began the show in 1973, we didn’t hold out much hope for a long continu¬ ing series. “But over the past two years, something happened and there we were up in the top five television programs. “It not only came as a sur¬ prise to us on the show, but to the BBC who I think were giv¬ ing serious thought to axing the series. “I can’t walk down the street or go shopping without someone coming up to me in the street.” Mollie has appeared in a number of comedy series: She was Nerys Hughes’ mum in The Liver Birds, John Alder- ton’s mum in My Wife Next Door and Robin Nedwell s mum in the Doctor series. “I didn’t seem to make an impression,” she said But Mrs. Slocombe has. “Once 1 was trying on a dress in a shop cubicle. There I was, with only my bra and panties on, when suddenly, without warning, the curtains were pulled apart and a woman thrust an autograph hook in front of me. “I felt like a right lemon, I can tell you.” John Inman, who plays the limp-wristed Mr Humphries, moved to London 20 years ago and still laughs about his first job. It was a real-life Are You Being Served? situation in a departmental store in Lon¬ don’s Regent Street. “I worked in the window display business, ’ ’ he recalls. “Three years later, I left that very good job to start ac¬ ting in ~ repertory at Crewe when I was 21. “Since then, I have spent most Christmases as an ugly sister in pantomime. “I’m still a bachelor, but mother knows by this time that I can look after myself. “But one thing I have notic¬ ed since Are You Being Serv¬ ed? is that she has stopped asking me that question. What will the sixth series be like 9 Although it will not be released in Britain until the end of the year and in Australia some time in the New Year, the BBC are keep¬ ing very quiet about it. They tried to keep mum about whether of not they would replace Arthur Brough (Mr. Grainger) who died in May. But the news leaked out that veteran actor James Hayter (he was Mr. Pickwick in the movie Pickwick Papers) had been signed to join the series as a new character. The BBC assures us that the next series will be even better than the last . # • • RIGHT: The floor staff at Grace Bros, store — from left, Frank Thornton, John Inman, Trevor Bannister and, INSET: Wendy Richard and Mollie Sugden. 2S1I -EM 1 v # MARK HOLDEN SIGNS HUGE U.S.A.

Page 22—TV WEEK—OCTOBER 28, 1978 How to win at Blackjack. Player’s No.6 is the cigarette with everything you're looking for. Fine tobacco. Smooth taste. The length you like. Player’s No.6 is something you can be sure of. Unlike the game of Blackjack or Pontoon. A player usually tries to hit 21 right on the button... and this is also where the player usually founders. According to the successful system developed by a professor of mathematics, you are better off if you sit on the minimum allowable number and wait for the banker to make his move. Because every time a player takes an extra card, the odds of losing or ‘breaking’ increase unbelievably. The banker is the last to play, so if all the players ‘break’ before it’s his turn, he wins the pot without doing anything. So let him take the risk of breaking. The more players ‘sitting’, means more pressure on the banker to try a little harder to win. And that’s where he can come unstuck...with the result that his money is more likely to go home in your pocket. In gambling you can never be sure, but Player’s No.6 is a sure thing that wins on every count. ©John Player & Sons 1977 PLAYER’S N°6,ASURE THING. Wins on taste, length and value 088. P.388.10.77 GET READY TO BLOW YOUR MINDS ON THE TOUR OF THE CENTURY ELTON, ROD FOR OZ DOUBLE-BILL THE HOTTEST rumor buzzing around the Oz international touring circles is that Elton John may tour Australia with Rod Stewart early next year as Rod’s keyboard player. No one in the know will either con¬ firm or deny the rumor — mind you, a few of the big names doubled up in laughter and said: “Don’t be outrageously silly, Molly.” But let’s weigh up the facts. It’s a known fact that Elton and Rod are good friends and so are their respective managers John Reid and Billy Gaff. It is also known that both parties are making a film together titled Jetlag starring Rod and Elton which will re¬ quire filming in many different coun¬ tries. This would include Australia as both artists have successfully toured here over the past five years. And what’s more I do know for sure that different Australian film com¬ panies have been approached by the said parties to tender quotes for such filming. To top it off, both artists will be releasing albums within the next seven weeks and will be seriously thinking of committing themselves to world tours to promote their product. So, although the idea sounds highly fantastic, I believe it is not beyond the realms of possibility. Perhaps the only way I will be able to confirm the story is to accept the offer from Rod and his recording company to fly to London in November to exclusive¬ ly interview him about his future and his new album. 10CC ON TOP TWO YEARS ago one would have been excused for thinking that 10CC were finished. The members of this highly successful group had suffered a great division in musical tastes and decided to go their own ways. It looked as if their album of that time, How Dare You, would be the last market piece on vinyl that they would record. Two of the members, Graham Goldman and Eric Stewart, decided to continue with the group and within six months had completed a brilliant album in Deceptive Bends. 10CC were back on the world scene — and with a couple of hit singles including Good Morning, Judge. In Australia, the two musicians toured here last year complete with a backing group and played to sell-out houses but this year have been relative¬ ly quiet. Around six weeks ago they released a single titled Dedlock Holiday which, in my opinion, is a definite No. 1 in Australia. Already it has been No. 1 in the U.K. and it’s fast moving up the singles charts in America. This week the group release their Bloody Tourists album here and, if the single’s anything to go by, then this album is going to be a monster seller over Christmas. CONGRATS LRB LAST WEEK we ran out of space in the column but I’d like to now congratulate LRB for winning the album of the year in Sleeper Catcher and the industry vote for best single of the year in Reminiscing. This week they are featured on the front page of the prestigious American music magazine Record World and that in effect does sum up their success on the world charts today. All I can add is that they deserve every bit of it. DASHING DARRYL DASHING AUSTRALIAN singer Darryl Cotton, currently with a solo hit in the charts titled Don’t Let It Get To You, is fast becoming Australia’s new teenage heart-throb. Almost eight years ago Darryl went through the same thing here when he was lead singer of one of Oz’s top bopper groups the Zoot. At that stage the members of the group dressed themselves in pink clothes and used as their slogan Think Pink Think Zoot. They had such hits as One Times Two Times Three Times Four, Monty And Me and a revamp of the Beatles number Eleanor Rigby. When the group disbanded in 1970 Darryl left for England and then ended • ALTHOUGH HE has been in rock and roll for 10 years, Darryl Cotton has found a new breed of fans who have taken him to their hearts. Here he greets an up-and-coming star, Steve Cummings of The Sports. up in America to pursue a solo career. It was never to be and he finally teamed up with two other singer songwriters and formed a group titled Friend. Included in the group was Leif Gar¬ rett and Shaun Cassidy’s record pro¬ ducer Michael Lloyd. Although they had some minor success on the charts the group never hit the big time. Late last year Darryl decided to return to Australia to pursue his solo career and, with the help of close friend Beeb Birtles of the Little River Band (also once a member of Zoot), Darryl record¬ ed Don’t Let It Get To You. The irony of its chart success is that Cotton did not purposefully go out to create a new heart-throb image. He wanted people to take his music seriously. What has happened is that he has achieved both goals. People are going out and buying the record because they think it’s good value and, at the same time, Darryl is building a most amazing teenage heart- throb following. m ■ f- ■ ■ : < 'v'' : : ERIC CLAPTON will release a new album titled Backless in three weeks’ time. It was produced by the Who’s producer Glyn Johns and was recorded at the old Olympic studios in London. Included on the LP is Dylan’s Walk Out In The Rain and If I Don’t Be There By Morning, J. J.

A $550,000 movie on the life of executed Australian soldier Breaker Morant will begin production early next year. Director Bruce Beresford, whose previous films include The Getting Of Wisdom, Don’s Party and the Bazza McKenzie movies, will fly to South Africa to research the story. Former Division Four and Power Without Glory star Terry Donovan is the main contender for the leading role. Donovan and Beresford have just completed The Money Movers, a film about the infamous toe-cutter gang, and Beresford is keen to use Donovan again. Donovan took the lead role in the original play, Breaker Morant, playing the upper- class Englishman who came to Australia and became a respected poet and horse- breaker. He later fought in the Boer War in South Africa with a contingent of Australian soldiers, and allegedly took part in the massacre of eight Boer prisoners after finding the mutilated body of one of his mates. He was shot by firing squad for the offence in 1902, after claiming in court that he was acting under orders. Several English actors, in¬ cluding Arthur Lowe, Donald Pleasence and Michael York, will be approached to take ma¬ jor roles in the film. Beresford said this week: ‘Til be researching the Boer War, and I’m going to South Africa in a couple of weeks to look at the place near Johan¬ nesburg where the massacre actually occurred. “I’m also going to England, because The Getting Of Wisdom is on at the London Film Festival. There are several parts that would-suit English actors. It’s one of those things where English ac¬ tors are going to have to play the English parts and Australians the Australian parts. “The budget is $550,000, which isn’t much compared to what’s being spent nowadays, but it’s the biggest budget I have ever worked with. “The entire film will be shot in South Australia, which is surprisingly similar to South Africa.’’ — RICHARD GUILLIATT • BELOW: Terry Donovan (left) gets heavy with co-star Tony Bonner in a scene from the movie The Money Movers, to he released soon.

Donna was with Beeb when the LRB Home Run 78 tour started on Great Keppel Island, on the Great Barrier Reef, two weeks ago. The band spent a week on the island and friends said Beeb and Donna spent a lot of time together on the less populated beaches. * • ABOVE: Most Popular New Talent Paul O'Gorman, enjoys chats with girl friend Liz Waley. • TOP LEFT: Record company promotions man, David Paul, and Judith Evans, wife of Ray Evans. • TOP RIGHT: Leif Garrett's manager, Stann Moress, with Anne Milligan (left) and Caroline James. • FAR LEFT: Sally Boyden whoops it up with Young Talent Time member, Nicole Cooper. • ABOVE LEFT: Top models Virginia Hey, Belinda Green and Debra Seccombe outshone other guests. • LEFT: Is this the attractive girl friend Young Doctors heart-throb Tony Alvarez has refused to name?

WILL THE billboards of Manhattan make Cheryl Rixon Australia’s answer to the all-American girl? That’s the question being asked in New York’s publishing and entertainment industry about the girl who has decided that the one way to get on in the world’s biggest rat race is not to be back- y ward about coming forward. Cheryl, noted for the way she’d shed her clothes at the drop of a hat when she played > the part of Angela O’Malley in The Box, is on the brink of the bigtime. It’s hard to go anywhere in the Big Apple now without coming face-to-face with a life-size facsimile of Cheryl, all smiles and beautiful bottom, skateboarding across a poster for Forum magazine. Her famous cut-off jeans with “Cheryl” embroidered across the back pocket are as prominent as the body which fills them. Since she’s been in New York, where she’s now living with her husband, Nigel Ballard, landscape gardener- turned-photographer, Cheryl has been under the wing of a leading magazine publisher, Bob Guccione. She says she “zeroed in on Bob Guccione and arranged for him to discover me.” For Guccione she did a very revealing nude centre spread in Penthouse which doesn’t seem to have done her any harm. Cheryl says that she and Guccione “hit off this great relationship and now in the 18 months I’ve been here I’ve got and lost a dozen movies. ” Why Bob Guccione? Well, as Cheryl tells it, he was the short-cut to the top she need¬ ed. “I needed to get to know someone who was powerful in the industry, who had money, contacts and was prepared to take chances.” Since the Penthouse spread — for which she was paid $3000 — she’s been doing work for other parts of the Guccione publishing group. To date she’s had two bit parts in movies and been very involved in fashion modelling, ads and public relations work. Her agent and best friend is model agency principal Loret¬ ta Vaan der Veer. Continued on page 74 HOW CAN UNDERWEAR SO PRACTICAL LOOK SO GOOD 014 P156 and a two-year collection of other fond memories from TV's most popular family drama IT'S THE Sullivans’ second birthday, and while the cast and crew celebrate with champagne, the show’s early critics are eating humble pie. When news first broke in 1976 that a series was to be made about life in Melbourne during WWII, the knockers came from everywhere with their predictions of doom and disaster. But how The Sullivans has triumphed! It now stands as Australian television’s most popular and talked-about family. Who could forget the highlights of these first two years? Remember the romance between John Sullivan (Andrew McFarlane) and German Anna Kauffman (Ingrid Mason)? When she died tragically there was hard¬ ly a dry eye in the lounge rooms across the nation. But not all romances ended so sadly. Despite parental op¬ position, young Terry Sullivan (Richard Morgan) had the happiest day of his life when he married Caroline O’Brien (Toni Vernon). And Michael Watkins (John Walton) was just as happy when he married Alice Morgan (Megan Williams). Then there is the most re¬ cent of all marriages — that of Uncle Harry (Michael Caton) to Sgt. Lou Mitchell (Annie Byron) . . . that’s them at left. Harry’s was particularly special because he had suf¬ fered the agony of Rose’s (Maggie Dence) drowning. Lil Duggan (Noni Hazlehurst) could never seem to put a foot right. A shaky marriage to Bert (Peter Hehir) had one magical moment when John Albert Duggan was born. But Bert never saw his son. He was kill¬ ed at war before he had the chance. Despite the show’s success, the cast and crew still work long and hard. As for the knockers, they haven’t been seen or heard for some time. — BRETT STAVORDALE • PICTURES FROM LEFT: Kit¬ ty thought all of her dreams had come true when Grace took her to Sydney to see the sights. • KITTY AND Dave gather around newlyweds Michael and Alice. • YOUNG LOVE came to The Sullivans when Terry and Caroline began cour¬ ting and later married. • MARRIAGE, THEN later tragedy — Anna's death shattered John Sullivan. • LUCKLESS LIL Duggan.

SP352.L.TVW THE DADDY OF BUT, AS HE GIVES AWAY HIS DAUGHTER, TELLY 'KOJAK' SAVALAS ADMITS HE'S A LOUSY HUSBAND IT WAS one of the toughest roles Telly Savalas had been called on to play — the father of the bride. But he managed it with great pride and only the hint of a tear in his eye as he gave daughter Christina’s hand in marriage to John Peter Kousakis. “Have you ever seen a pret¬ tier bride?” he demanded outside the St. Sophia Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Los Angeles after the ceremony. “I’m filled with great hap¬ piness and just a little of a father’s sadness.” These mixed emotions were hardly surprising for the Kojak star who had damned himself as a “lousy husband”, but at the same time consoled • LEFT: A beaming Telly Savalas and his daughter Christina inside the church. himself that he was a “marvellous father”. The 27-year-old bride, by his first wife, Catherine, is the eldest of his four children. He has two daughters, 16-year- old Penelope and 14-year-old Candace, by second wife Marilyn and a five-year-old son Nicholas by present spouse Sally. Telly has lavished everything on the four — from substantial trust funds to exclusive education and a philosophy of life handed down to him by his own Greek father, who stressed human rather than material values. “It doesn’t follow that a lousy husband makes a lousy father,” he once defended himself. “I’m a great father . . . oh, I admit that sometimes I indulge them. “I’ll do anything for them. They know that no matter Get into top gear. Speedo Tops and Bottoms are geared for summer. Sassy colours. Saucy trims. Sexy styling. THEM ALL... where they are or wherever I am, that if they need me I'll come running I worry about them and protect them the same way any loving father does. ” That is something Christina might gently dispute.

On British television at the moment, they are keeping it all in the family by appearing in three different drama television series. The Woodward family’s head is 47-year-old Edward, an experienced all-round actor and former dance band singer, who is most famous as the super-cool spy Callan. He is currently appearing in the BBC series 1990 as a fighter against the future dictators of Britain. His 24-year-old son Tim (left) is rapidly becoming a star in his own right by ap¬ pearing as Second Lieutenant Alan Farmer in the successful World War I TV drama Wings. But that’s not all. The third member of the television trio is 21-year-old son Peter (right). He clicked his heels and made his bow as hard-line SS Lieutenant Hans Kurtmeier in the London Weekend series Enemy At The Door. # You’ll always be right BU1074‘» ,7 HP They came in their hordes to pillage and plunder..they died in their thousands to build an empire.. ■ A COURTLY LADY’S MODISH DRESS W^ru of diwmtily rrlftfi, **«, f(Nlw ui r*to h*A» drrf ne<Hi„ wim^ht ,k * uU ~ !\"/\"*** mi Img k»gei ,W-- '«W kr '*\"• ?*H« to CW ke»-ie mi wingei time nko *n<m 'oifftmt of ike time „ .*■*\" <* (.mi* lift, mi ike emmet, of ike iey moei ikei ** w w, frttmemly umegh eftn fee ihem ™y **%»« '*-» «/ mnHlWi. 7*V ef ihrte remtetmt krteme ike mtegm ** •/ ffc mklemem they „W mi temettmei fm tei meemmtn mkhul p»w~ first volume in the Great Ages of Man library • Ancient China measures 27 cm x 22 cm • Over 190 pages in each volume • Scores of photographs, charts, diagrams and drawings • Hard bound with gold embossed linen spine and lavishly printed on high quality art paper Enter the heart of China, locked behind high walls for centuries, discover a land so beautiful, so utterly mysterious that even today, the free world knows litde about The editors of Time-Life Books have produced what must be the most incredible in-depth pictorial study of Ancient China ever published* Travel back with us now through centuries of time, along ancient caravan routes to discover treasures of the world’s oldest recorded civilization* Breathtaking, revealing...

AGAIN SHE'S OFF TO THE OLD BLIGHTY FOR AN EN¬ COUNTER WITH MAGGIE THATCHER AUSTRALIA’S OWN Dame Edna Everage has been in¬ vited to appear on Michael Parkinson’s Christmas special on the BBC. And Parkinson’s other special guest on the show will be another lady almost as well known as Dame Edna — the leader of the British Conser¬ vative Party, Mrs. Margaret Thatcher. Dame Edna, now recovering from a hectic 16-week season on stage in Melbourne and Sydney, will tape the Park¬ inson show in London on December 2. “I believe Dame Edna and Mrs. Thatcher will probably discuss Christmas tidings and the Conservatives’ policies,” Sydney agent, Fred Bestall, said. Dame Edna is believed to be planning an elaborate new wardrobe for her meeting with Mrs. Thatcher. “It will be Christmas and very cold in England,” Bestall said. “Dame Edna is from Australia ... so need I say anymore . . . ?” Dame Edna’s appearance on Parkinson’s Christmas special will precede another season on stage, at the Piccadilly Theatre. Her show there is expected to run until next March. Dame Edna bid fond farewells to Australia on a very special Peter Couchman Show on Melbourne’s ATVO. The one-hour special was taped without rehearsals and based around a casual inter¬ view between Couchman and Dame Edna. Edna also chatted — in her inimitable style — with Couchman’s guests, including artist Charles Bush, socialite Kath Clarke and royalist the Rev. Haldane Stevenson. Over the weekend, no body can do without one. Jockey Shirts make you wish the weekend happened more than once a week. They’re stylish. Colourful.

Mr. Bush scoured Melbourne for some presents suitable for the occasion — and found a bowl of plastic “gladdies” and an Australian souvenir cushion. The “emotional climax” came when Dame Edna was presented with a very special award by the chairman of the Moonee Ponds Chamber of Commerce. The award made Dame Ed¬ na Mother of the Year. — LAWRIE MASTERSON GAMEEBNASAYS THE • ABOVE: The lady should be familiar, but her escorts . . .

HOLDEN IN HOLLYWOOD Continued from Page 22 Mark Holden says he has no patience for the press in- sistence on equating everything in dollars and cents and his real excitement over the management, recording and music publishing pact lays in other areas. But just one small indication of the value the Scotti Brothers, the highly successful Hollywood promotion and recording company, place on Mark was the sleek Transam car parked outside his Canyon home. It was a surprise gift from Tony Scotti, the promotional genius who has guided the Lit¬ tle River Band and John Paul Young into the American charts, long before he and Mark reached an agreement after four months of negotia¬ tion. “Look, it’s a substantial deal,” Mark said. “The ad¬ vance they’ve given me will allow me to live here com¬ fortably for the next couple of years even if nothing hap¬ pens.’’ “When I signed my life away at 5.30 on Friday I told Tony if I had the choice of any other deal in the world I wouldn’t change anything and that really sums it up. “What they want for me and what I want for me is so close. They’re into acting, theatre, pop music — the whole thing of entertainment and not just one thing or the other. “I don’t want to be confined and few of the people I’ve worked with have understood that. Once I had to change managers because he wouldn’t let me do a rock opera. ’ ’ Mark’s initial plunge into the American recording world has left him “completely over¬ dosed’’ on it. Its enthusiasm, musicianship and profes¬ sionalism have already “stret¬ ched me’’ and sent him in new directions. The two tracks he has com¬ pleted for his American debut album, Scintillating Lady and Strong In My Heart which he composed, are being rush released by EMI in Australia as a single, represent a major departure for him. “It’s power rock ‘n’ roll,’’ he said incredulously. “I’m certain they’ll like it in America, but in Australia if they want to hear it from me, I don’t know.’’ Mark Holden’s success isn’t without minor drawbacks. He may be in awe of the American recording industry, but certainly not Los Angeles. “I’d always hoped it would happen for me in England,” he said. “As a place to live this would have to be the . . . of the world.” But Mark believes he will be able to adapt more readily to the smog, sprawl and clutter of Los Angeles than to the separation from his family in Adelaide. “I’d love to be home right now, just for a breather,” he sighed. “In Australia I had the freedom to go home and hibernate every second weekend and that’s how I kept my perspective in this business.” If plans to release his American album in November work out he will go home for • ABOVE: Mark Holden . . . ' 1 1 wouldn't change anything.\" Christmas and once establish¬ ed here he hopes to spend three months a year in Australia. “I’m sending my parents a copy of the record today,” he said. “I know my brother, Craig, will like it, but I’m not sure what my parents will think and I doubt my grand¬ mother will like it. “I don’t know. They’ll pro¬ bably grin and grit their teeth. They’re pretty used to me do¬ ing weird things.” # and that’s the trick! Great tasting Freedent gum won’t stick to your dental work.

STARS: Ed¬ ward Fox, Cyril Cusack, Delphine Seyrig. Directed by Fred Zinnemann; 1973. Under Fred Zinnemann’s superb direction this taut thriller is never off the boil. It starts at a fast pace and never takes a pause. Fox is a hired assassin and his target is France’s General Charles de Gaulle. We follow the methodical and well-planned murder at¬ tempt as the cold-blooded killer goes about his job. Fox is well cast as the menacing assassin. He is surrounded by a well- chosen cast and the film is backgrounded with attractive European settings. The uncanny resemblance to de Gaulle is a feature of the casting. Gripping ★ ★ ★ ★ • AIRPORT 1975 (TVQO, 7.30). STARS: Charlton Heston, Karen Black, George Kennedy, Efrem Zimbalist jun., Helen Reddy, Sid Caesar. Directed by Jack Smight; 1974. This was the successor to box-office hit Airport. The new cast and script are less effective and entertaining than the first effort though it will be of interest to those who like special effects. Heston plays an airline troubleshooter who, in one in¬ cident, is transferred from a helicopter to the cockpit of a disabled 747 being flown by stewardess Karen Black.

Joanne scores the acting honors as a wealthy woman forced to face her mother’s death, her son’s homosexuali¬ ty and the failure of her mar¬ riage.
