        "text": "Advances in technology are impacting on pubs from quizzes to stock control. Phil Mellows reports.\n\nOver the last couple of decades quizzes have become one of the most popular ways for a pub to attract trade on a quiet night of the week.\n\nThe Publican Market Report, published in August 2003, indicated that 46 per cent of pubs have a quiz night, only just behind those with darts and pool.\n\nQuizzes can be effective but they require a lot of effort to keep them that way, to freshen up the format on a regular basis and make sure the competition isn't dominated every week by the same team of quiz anoraks.\n\nNow it looks as though the pub quiz might be taking a leap into the 21st century with what claims to be the first entirely internet-based service.\n\nPubquiz.biz, launched this month, is the result of two years of development by Century Quiz, one of longest established quiz firms in the pub market which also boasts top TV shows such as Who Wants to be a Millionaire? and University Challenge on its client list.\n\n\"What pub quizzes were missing was topical questions,\" said Century's Graeme Williams. \"The idea was that pubs could have fresh material for that night's quiz, with someone writing the questions right up until the evening.\"\n\nAn internet-based quiz also takes us a step nearer the elusive nationwide quiz which has been attempted before but has never quite come off. Pubs and their customers can play in a simultaneous contest on a single night or pubcos could run a competition across their estate over a number of weeks.\n\nIt could also help rural pubs revive the quiz night. Century organises 150 pub quiz leagues around the country and has recently noted a decline in rural areas where quizzers have to drive to get to away matches. Now they can be connected up online and don't have to travel.\n\nBecause licensees print out the quiz sheets from their own computer it is also cheaper, typically £50 for 2,000 questions. You can also order themed quizzes and \"specials\" such as the Hallowe'en quiz available at the end of this month.\n\nCentury's own research confirms that the quiz is one of the most significant factors in attracting people to a particular pub. \"About 17 per cent pick a pub because of its quiz and quizzes are equally attractive to men and women,\" said Graeme.\n\nOf course, you have to let those people know you have a quiz night and it can be important to tell them the format and the theme, if you have one. Some quizzers specialise in topics such as pop music and are prepared to travel to compete.\n\nPubs which sign up to Pubquiz.biz can market themselves through a free web page on the www.pubquiznights. co.uk website.\n\nwww.pubquiz.biz\n\nGet your free trial quiz​\n\nCentury quiz is offering readers of The Publican a free trial of its new internet-based pub quiz. To get two quiz nights free of charge:\n\nLog on to www.pubquiz.biz\n\nGo to \"Why Subscribe\" and click on \"Briefly...\"\n\nScroll down to point 4 and click on \"full\"\n\nClick on \"Register\" icon\n\nComplete the form and submit. Make sure you fill in the details where there's an asterisk\n\nUnder \"How did you find us\" choose The Publican feature\n\nChoose payment option \"by cheque\". You will not be invoiced!\n\nSend\n\nYou will receive 200 units of free credit, enough for two quizzes and a free web page. If you have any problems phone Graeme Williams on 0151 733 8676 or email: graeme@pubquiz.biz.\n\nLogging on at lunch​\n\nYou may or may not like the idea of your customers browsing the internet on their laptops while sipping their pints, but if you do, rest assured that we now have the technology to make it happen.\n\nA pub in Norwich has become one of the first wireless hotspot internet sites, making fast internet connection possible through broadband technology.\n\nVisitors to the Unthank Arms, which describes itself as a pub where \"grunge meets Gucci\", can buy a special card and quickly go online via a hotspot network called Kooku.\n\n\"It's much easier to use than it may sound, with just a brief set-up process you can be logged on and enjoying lunch within minutes,\" said licensee Nick De'Ath. \"Via a pay-as-you-go connection, which is more powerful that your average broadband, you're still connected to your email and the office but ensconced in the Unthank Arms.\"\n\nThe hotspot, technically known as a miniature point-of-presence or mini-POP, was set up by local internet service provider Freeclix.\n\nwww.kooku.com\n\nKeeping to order​\n\nWhen Spirit takes over the Scottish & Newcastle (S&N) Retail pub business it will inherit an electronic ordering system that has revolutionised the way pub managers control and manage stocks of food and beer.\n\nThe system has been rolled out across the entire pub estate and, according to the company, saves an estimated £450,000 per year in managers' time plus £500,000 in distribution and operations costs.\n\nAll food and beer orders are placed electronically enabling licensees to make and amend orders when it suits them, whether it's at 6am before the day gets started or at midnight after the last customers have left.\n\nBefore e-ordering, amendments to an order had to be made over the telephone, involving a lengthy telesales call at an inconvenient time.\n\nManagers would often receive no indication that a product was out of stock until the order was delivered but now they are automatically alerted if an item is out of stock and alternative products are suggested.\n\nThe food ordering initiative was launched in 2002 and electronic ordering of beer has been in operation since July this year. S&N Retail is currently in discussions to extend the initiative to wine and non-consumables.\n\nEnterprising move​\n\nLicensees of Britain's biggest pub group, Enterprise Inns, are being given the opportunity to plug into the internet fast lane thanks to a link-up with e-commerce provider Barbox.\n\nBarbox has provided Enterprise with its own dedicated site which offers licensees a range of exclusive deals on top of the normal services contained in the standard package.\n\nFollowing initial trials in selected pubs across the estate last year more than 300 licensees have joined the scheme and now the chance to use the service is being made available to a larger number of pubs.\n\nEnterprise says it is delighted with the take-up by licensees, most of whom are making savings on products and services way above the £5 weekly Barbox subscription.\n\nAs well as a fast link to the latest deals, licensees can access an information service which provides news on trade issues and get copies of Enterprise's in-house magazine, Eagle Eye.\n\nPromotions take on new technology​\n\nA new connection between games machines and a pub's plasma screen has been made possible by the merger of Inspired Broadcast Networks, the firm responsible for the content of Leisure Link's ITBox terminals, and big screen supplier Blue Multi Media.\n\nThe move promises to create, for the first time, an integrated, networked entertainment and marketing system in more than 3,000 pubs with ITBoxes.\n\nAccording to Inspired it will be possible, for instance, to run networked national pub quizzes and other games and competitions, advertising and branded television channels.\n\nThe new services will be fully customisable by each venue and tailored to the time of day, ensuring that promotional and entertainment content is automatically updated to suit a particular bar's ambience and needs.\n\nInspired, which also provides i"
