His family hope the new campaign will lead to new information.\n\n\"If only he knew the difference a phone call would make,\" his father, also called Derek said. \"All we want is to know he's alive.\"\n\nThe other people featured are Matthew Foyle, from Newton Abbot in Devon and Aphrodite Moleka, from Streatham, south London.\n\nThe NMPH, set up in 1992 to help find missing people, offers advice to those who have left home and can pass on free confidential messages.\n\nSeveral other NMPH events are also taking place this month, including its annual Missing Miles sponsored walk from Edinburgh to London."
