        "text": "At the start of each game, the player is shown three WANTED posters. Each poster has a clue to a different Hangman phrase. The player must select one of the three posters.\n\nThe player is then shown the main Hangman game screen. At the start of the game, the player's Hangman character has all six body parts missing.\n\nThe clue to the Hangman phrase is shown in green above the phrase itself. Each letter of the phrase is represented by a purple tile. Initially all the tiles are blank. At the bottom of the screen is a selection of three letters to choose from. Each letter has a different question category associated with it. The game has a total of seven question categories.\n\nA TO Z\n\nENTERTAINMENT\n\nPOP MUSIC\n\nPOT LUCK\n\nPEOPLE & PLACES\n\nSPORT\n\nSCIENCE & NATURE\n\nThe player must choose one of the letters that they think is present in the Hangman phrase. There is a time limit for the selection, which is shown graphically by a shrinking red bar on the undertaker's tape measure at the bottom of the screen. If the player fails to make a selection within the time limit, one of the three letters is chosen at random.\n\nIf the selected letter is NOT in the phrase, the chosen letter drops through the trap door beneath it, and a limb, or other body part, is added to the Hangman character. The player must then choose again from a fresh set of letters.\n\nIf the selected letter is in the phrase, the game progresses to the question screen.\n\nIf the selected letter is a question mark (?), a mystery bonus round is awarded.\n\nIf the player's Hangman accumulates all six body parts, the Hangman is complete; the player is 'hanged', and the game ends.\n\nThe player is shown a question from their chosen category together with three alternative answers, only one of which is correct. The player must choose the answer that they think is correct. There is a time limit for the selection, which is shown graphically by a shrinking red bar on the undertaker's tape measure at the bottom of the screen. There is also a points value on the tape measure, which counts down as the question time runs out.\n\nIf the player selects the CORRECT answer, the player is awarded the current points value on the timer, the game returns to the main game screen, and all occurrences of the previously selected letter are revealed in the phrase.\n\nIf the player selects an INCORRECT answer, and has one or more try again bullets remaining, they must try again.\n\nThe game ends if:\n\nthe player selects a wrong answer, and has no try again bullets remaining\n\nthe player fails to select an answer within the time limit\n\nIn the MYSTERY BONUS round, the player is briefly shown four WANTED posters, each with a different bonus prize. The bonuses on offer can be positive or negative, but there is always at least one positive bonus available for the player to choose.\n\nThe wanted posters are turned over, and their bonus prizes hidden from view. The player must then watch closely as the four posters are shuffled. The player is asked to select one of the posters. The prize on the chosen poster is then revealed, and awarded to the player.\n\nThe possible POSITIVE bonuses are:\n\nBONUS POINTS - a spot prize ranging from 100 to 1000 bonus points\n\nTRY AGAIN - a try again bullet is added to the player's try again total (up to a maximum of three)\n\nSUPER TRY AGAIN - two try again bullets are added to the player's try again total (up to a maximum of three)\n\nADD A LETTER - a letter in the phrase is revealed without the need for the player to answer a question\n\nADD LETTERS - up to three letters in the phrase are revealed without the need for the player to answer a question\n\nCOMPLETE PHRASE - the current phrase is automatically completed and the points for the phrase are awarded.\n\nThe possible NEGATIVE bonuses are:\n\nLOSE TRY AGAIN - if the player has one or more try again bullets, one of them is removed\n\nADD A LIMB - a body part is added to the player's Hangman character\n\nHANGED - all remaining missing body parts are added to the player's Hangman character, and the game ends\n\nAfter successfully answering a question, the game returns to the main game screen. If at this point the Hangman phrase is complete, the letter tiles turn over, one after an other, each revealing 100 points. The points for each tile are added to the player's total score. The game then returns to the phrase selection screen, and the player chooses a new Hangman phrase.\n\nWhen the game ends, if the player has a high enough points total, they are shown their rank in the game's high score table, and asked to enter their initials.\n\nThe player is also asked to create a PIN code. In the event of winning a tournament prize, the player will be asked to re-enter this code during the claim procedure.\n\nAt regular intervals throughout each tournament, the central server collates the high score tables from each terminal to form an overall national high score table. Players can check this leader board at any time before the tournament ends."
