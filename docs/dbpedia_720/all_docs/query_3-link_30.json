        "text": "As a presence in Romanian society, the oriental music generally known by the denomination of \" manele \" has produced a wide discussion, at least in terms of popular culture and media. Generally, it was perceived in a twofold manner – either as a musical genre suited for lower classes parties and social events or, from a political standpoint, was heavily criticized for two main reasons, both of them ideological: first as a music of the uneducated, poor lower strata of Romanian society (a right-wing conservator-elitist view) and secondly, as the ethnic cultural artifact of the Roma minority, which taints the Romanian popular musical culture (a purist-racist view). Both of these views appeared as a reaction to the way in which the \" manele \" genre became a mass phenomenon, proving to be one of the most or perhaps the most consumed music in Romania. In this context, the subculture associated with the \" manele \" music is still uncharted territory, very few researchers showing any interest towards the phenomenon. To this day, most relevant research on the subject remains that of Stoichiţă and La Bretèque (2012), Haliliuc (2014) and the forthcoming edited volume on the issue done by Bessinger, Rădulescu and Giurchescu. We are aiming to explore the \" manele \" phenomenon as a twofold process – first, as the reflection of a social reality and secondly, as a political statement. Thus, we will first approach the social dimension of this musical genre, by trying to answer the following questions: are the \" manele \" the cultural expression of a particular social position or class? What are the main discursive characteristics of this particular musical form of expression? Secondly, we will try to see how the \" manele \" were politicized by a particular group of activists, by using it as a political statement, a voice of the underprivileged in Romanian society. At the end of our paper we will discuss the point of intersection between these two very different social worlds and the possible cultural and political implications of this development.\n\nBalkan Gypsy music has recently become globalized – it is found in festivals of Balkan music and world music, on YouTube, and in dance club remixes by DJs. As Europe's largest minority and its quintessential \" other, \" Roma face severe marginalization, yet ironically, their music, especially brass bands, commands growing attention. Referenc-ing debates about how collaborations and hybridity may be liberating and/or exploitative, I explore strategies through which non-Roma appropriate, perform, and consume Balkan Gypsy music. Noting that Roma are rarely in charge of their own representations, I illustrate how the image of the fantasy Balkan Gypsy has been created, and who participates in and who benefits from the popularization of Gypsy arts. I focus on DJs and club culture in western Europe and North America and tie my analysis to performative displays of European multiculturalism."
