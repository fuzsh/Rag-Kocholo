        "text": "What are the major problems which are being faced today?\n\n1. Pest and diseases\n\nPests and diseases are major problems that can be found in the field because they decrease theproductivity of agricultural commodities. In order to reduce the probability for lower yield qualitively andquantitively, actions must be made either through preventions such as the application of pesticides.\n\nAt previous times, farmers used to apply pesticides in a large amount. Even though they endedup with a high yield in the end, pests and diseases became tolerant because they were able to adapt insuch conditions. Soon, a higher outbreak took place and these conditions became troublesome for thefarmers.\n\nThese days, people started to realize that the application of pesticides especially when usedexcessively will cause a greater problem in the field, therefore scientists focuses more on biopesticides ornatural predators to reduce the population. These way of technique is much safer to the environment.\n\n2. Land and Water problems\n\nPopulation explotion is a major issue that the world is facing. The more people being born, themore land we need for building homes, working spaces and agriculture areas to supply food. The issuestarts when fertile areas are starting to erode especially for the top soil which is rich in nutrition for theplants. In Indonesia for example, almost all the areas have top soil less than five milimeters. Not only thatbut sometimes, the horizons are lack of essential minerals and can contain hazardous elements such aslarge amount of aluminium or iron that will impact the plants growth. Organic matter is also importanttherefore farmers will try to supply their lands with extra fertilizers which is relatively expensive ifbought in the market. The application of chemical fertilizers is much efficient in order to raise the soilmineral composition but it doesnâ€™t really help when we talk about raising or decreasing the soil porosity.\n\nRelated to water problems, most water especially in urban areas are contaminated. If such waterare used to irrigate agriculture crops, it can cause drop in soil PH and also toxity. Not only that but insome cases, floods can occur causing damage to plant crops. It is very savere if high floods occurespecially during the rainy season.\n\n3. Technology accessibility and knowledge\n\nPeople who live in rural areas that works as a farmers are used to their folkways of growingcrops especially with the fact that most people who are farmers are the old generation. They do not havethe knowledge of the new modern technologies that might actually be helpful for them in order to helpincrease efficiencies.\n\nHow is it suppose to be implemented?\n\n1. Pest and diseases\n\nIn its implementation, the management of pest and diseases should be treated with safe andefficient application of biopesticides or natural enemies. Some examples which are often used in the fieldare trichoderma, basil mix and sadao mix especially in rice paddies. It can be applied as mixture with theseeds. These biopesticides will harm less the natural predator and will protect the crops from direct pestsand diseases. The natural predator on the other hand will not reduce in population in this case and willmore likely to help eat these pests. Even thought the use of natural ingredients and natural predators isdefinitely a safer way tp maintain the environmental damage and safe crop production, but it will taketime for the land to heal especially if use chemical pesticides at the previous time. The result is also notdirect and can see directly like when using chemical pesticides but it is sufficient enough.\n\n2. Land and water problem\n\nLand is a limited resource that we need to help conserve and maintain especially with the soilproblems which are happening today. Land conservation is needed today, either through maintaining andcreating green areas. There are a lot of ways on how to maintain these areas through putting organicmatters and also to do crop rotation or cover crops in the agricultural practice.\n\nRelated to water problem, fresh water should be conserved in special area if when going to beused in agriculture practice. This area should be clean and household garbage should not be in contactdirectly. For organic waste, it is possible to be decomposed then used as a fertilizer. Basically all thesewater problems can be solved through good irrigation system and waste management.\n\n3. Technology and accessibility to knowledge\n\nThe use of technology is to help us finish our tasks in a more efficient way by reducing the laborforce and saving our time. In most areas, farmers are uncapable in maintaining and using the machinesbecause of their lack of knowledge. Training and informal education should be done by extensin workersbut these way of education should be based on what the farmers need.\n\nHow extension workers work in order to reach safe and efficient agriculture?\n\nIn order to reach safe and efficient agriculture, extension workers must jump in and interfere inthe whole sector to connect the link between researchers, government and the society. They must be ableto provide education and information to the farmers. Trainings and workshops should be also given to thefarmers."
