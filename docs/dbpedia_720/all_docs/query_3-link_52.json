Kohut, director of the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies (CIUS), naming it Synopsis quickly came to mind.^ Not only is Zenon currently working on the famous seventeenth-century Synopsis and its historical context, but that work stands at the outset of modem Ukrainian-Russian relations, the major subject of his scholarly oeuvre. Part of the original title of Synopsis — sobranie, or collection — described our goal to publish a collection of essays in Zenon’ s honour. In considering the matter further, we realized that the common use of “synopsis” in English to mean ‘a brief orderly outline affording a quick general view’ contains some of the elements that have marked Zenon’ s writings. From his groundbreaking monograph Russian Centralism and Ukrainian Autonomy, through his numerous essays on forms of identity in early modem Ukraine and Russia, to his insightful analysis of Ukrainian and Russian historiography, Zenon has dealt with large topics concisely, imbuing them with order and clarity. Those same traits have made him a superb organizer and editor of scholarship and bibliography. For over a decade, CIUS has had the advantage of his steady and tactful leadership, which has enabled that institute to flourish and grow in the new conditions that an independent Ukraine has created for Ukrainian studies. At the same time, through his tireless work in assisting scholarship in Ukraine and the appearance of his works in Ukrainian translation, Zenon has educated and nurtured a new generation of historians in his ancestral homeland. We are grateful that so many historians of Ukraine answered our call to contribute to the Synopsis. We are pleased that Professor Volodymyr Kravchenko has perceptively characterized Zenon’ s life and scholarly 1. Synopsis was originally published in 1674 by the printery of the Kyiv Caves Monastery. Its authorship is usually attributed to Archimandrite Inokentii Gizel. For a facsimile of a somewhat later edition, see Sinopsis: Kiev, 1681. Facsimile mit einer Einleitung, vol. 17 of Bausteine zur Geschichte der Literatur bei den Slaven, ed. Hans Rothe (Cologne and Vienna: Bohlau Verlag, 1983). XVlll Preface work. We are thankful to Taras Kurylo for having assembled an accurate select bibliography of Zenon’s writings. We also thank those who have added their names to this tribute to Zenon in the Tabula Gratulatoria. We owe special gratitude to Professor Ihor Sevcenko for crafting a second, Slavonic-Ruthenian, title page of such erudition and wit. Myroslav Yurkevich expertly translated three of the articles. Dr. Taras Zakydalsky, editor of the Journal of Ukrainian Studies, has done a masterful job in editing the texts. CIUS Press has ensured greater distribution for the volume by issuing it as a separate publication. We also thank the scholars, University of Alberta staff, public officials, and members of Edmonton’s Ukrainian community who made Zenon’s sixtieth-birthday celebration, where a mock-up of this Festschrift was presented to him, such a momentous occasion. Serhii Plokhy and Frank E. Sysyn Zenon E. Kohut: Selected Pages of an Intellectual Biography Volodymyr Kravchenko My indirect acquaintance with Zenon Kohut began in Moscow during the years of Gorbachev’s perestroika, in the Lenin Library (as it was known at the time), where I was gathering material for a doctoral dissertation on Ukrainian historiography from the late eighteenth to the mid-nineteenth century. The doors of restricted collections were just beginning to open, and forbidden books whose very existence was unsuspected by Soviet historians were beginning to see the light of day here and there. At that time I had no desire to work in the restricted collections, having consciously chosen a subject “not topical” for Soviet historiography, situated, according to Vasilii Kliuchevsky’s recommendations, at an appropriate remove from the present. True, among my predecessors I did, after all, number a few “enemies of the people” and “agents” of various espionage centres “whose works defamed the unshakable temple of friendship” of the Ukrainian and Russian peoples. Still, according to the Soviet professional canon prevailing at the time, they deserved at most a few contemptuous lines in a historiographic survey. It was difficult to foresee that in the capital of the USSR, in the Vladimir Ilich Lenin Library, in the open catalog I would find a publication titled Russian Centralism and Ukrainian Autonomy: Imperial Absorption of the Hetmanate 1760s-1830s,^ which deserved a place among the works of the “bourgeois falsifiers.” Not for nothing, apparently, had its author gained experience as a librarian. 1 . Zenon E. Kohut, Russian Centralism and Ukrainian Autonomy: Imperial Absorption of the Hetmanate 1760s-1830s (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute, 1988), XV, 363 pp. 2 Volodymyr Kravchenko My acquaintance with contemporary Western historical writing about Ukraine began with this book, as well as with the work of the British historian David Saunders, who for some reason was also studying “non- topical” problems. That acquaintance obliged me to regret my inattention to English lessons at school, where we successfully studied the proceed- ings of successive congresses of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as reported in the Moscow News and submitted deadly boring translations of texts “technical in form, socialist in content.” It was a decade later that I met Zenon Kohut in person. He turned out to be more Ukrainian than American in appearance, massive, judicious, calm, smiling, always agreeing with everything, but somewhat withdrawn and taciturn. An aphorism coined by another Zeno came to mind: man was given two ears and only one tongue so as to listen more and speak less. But behind the facade of amiable phlegmatism was a mind of an analytical bent and with a subtle understanding of situations, tinged with restrained light irony. In a word, he had the appearance of a person to whom extremes were unsuited, so to speak; who was slow to mount but rode at a fast clip; who knew what he wanted and how to get it. All these traits, in my opinion, are characteristic of a historian’s scholarly style and organizational activity. Zenon was bom in the small town of laniv (now Ivano-Frankove) near Lviv at the beginning of 1944, just in time to end up on the far side of the Iron Curtain. Fate took him to Philadelphia, where many other Ukrainians also found themselves after the war. Such scholars as Orest Subtelny and Martha Bohachevsky-Chomiak, now well known in Ukraine, also came out of that milieu. Zenon’ s interest in history began while he was still in high school and developed at La Salle College, where the history of Eastern Europe was then taught by none other than Ivan Lysiak-Rudnytsky. It was he, according to Omeljan Pritsak, who “gathered around himself young talents, often his own discoveries,... Several of his former disciples, for example, Orest Subtelny and Zenon Kohut, have become respected Ukrainian historians.”^ It was Lysiak-Rudnytsky, apparently, who had the greatest influence on forming Zenon’ s scholarly individuality and 2.

Kohut: Selected Pages of an Intellectual Biography 3 historical outlook, defining the basic themes of his creative work and his approaches to the study of the Ukrainian past. Upon graduation from college in 1966, Zenon Kohut continued his education at the University of Pennsylvania, where he obtained his master’s degree in 1970, specializing in the history of Russia and modem Europe. It is worth recalling that the early 1970s were a turning point in the development of Ukrainian studies in the West. The period was marked above all by the scholarly debut of representatives of the younger generation of the Ukrainian postwar emigration, who had been educated in the Western cultural environment and traditions, as well as by the establishment of new institutions, publishing houses, research and teaching programs and, as a result, the inclusion of Ukrainian studies in the Western scholarly milieu. This lengthy process began with the establishment in 1971 of the Seminar in Ukrainian Studies at Harvard University (the Ukrainian Research Institute was founded two years later) under the leadership of Omeljan Pritsak, who nurtured a pleiad of talented scholars. The young researchers involved in its activity obtained their professional training through the system of academic seminars established at the institute, as well as by preparing reviews of new publications in Ukrainian studies issued in the USSR and in the West. From the very beginning Kohut took part in this activity as an organizer, a member of the editorial board, and editor in chief of the Minutes of the Seminar in Ukrainian Studies held at Harvard University and Recenzija: A Review of Soviet Ukrainian Scholarly Publications (1971-75). From then on he studied the socio-political history of eighteenth-century Ukraine and Ukrainian historiography, which became central to his later scholarly work. Although in the early 1970s Zenon Kohut’ s basic scholarly activity was conducted at Harvard, he remained a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania, where in 1975 he successfully defended his doctoral dissertation.^ The scholarly supervisor of his work was a well- known specialist in the history of the USSR and the Russian Empire, Alfred J. Rieber.\"^ 3. “The Abolition of Ukrainian Autonomy (1783-1786): A Case Study in the Integration of a Non-Russian Area into the Empire” (Ph.D. diss., University of Pennsylvania, 1975). 4. On Rieber, see Extending the Borders of Russian History: Essays in Honor of 4 Volodymyr Kravchenko Although there were numerous works devoted to this problem, it had never been studied at the monographic level. Dr. Kohut became the first historian to reconstruct and generalize the incorporation of ancien-regime Ukrainian society into imperial structures, as well as the fate of the socio- political and intellectual components of the Cossack state after its demise. His dissertation and the later monograph based on it synthesized all that had previously been written on the topic. In spite of the promising start, the scholar’s subsequent academic career followed a rather twisted path. Instructor in Russian and Soviet history at the University of Pennsylvania and Michigan State University, bibliographer, analyst of Soviet and East European affairs at the Library of Congress, and researcher at several other American government institutions — such was Dr. Kohut’ s path in the 1970s and 1980s. Interestingly, one of his predecessors in the capacity of researcher at the Library of Congress in the late 1950s and 1960s was his predecessor in the study of the Hetmanate, Lev Okinshevych. Zenon Kohut’ s new professional interests and responsibilities prompted the appearance in his scholarly output of annual bibliographic indexes of American Slavic and East European studies and publications on the current situation in countries of the “socialist camp.” Yet he never ceased to work in his area of basic interest, occasionally publishing new research on the history of the eighteenth-century Ukrainian elite and Ukrainian historiography of the same period. The disintegration of the socialist system and the decline and fall of the Soviet Union, which began in the latter half of the 1980s, as well as the rise of nationalism, long “buried” by left-wing intellectuals, and geopolitical developments in Europe finally brought about an intellectual revolution in Western academic circles. It was accompanied by over- whelming criticism of traditional Sovietology, as well as Slavic and Russian studies, the discrediting of revisionist concepts, and the brief triumph of the so-called “conservatives” — implacable critics of the Soviet historical experience. At the same time, this rapid change of pohtical and intellectual orientation breathed new hfe into Ukrainian studies in the West. In 1988, thirteen years after Dr. Kohut’ s dissertation was written, it was published as a monograph. The basic problems it addressed — the Alfred J. Rieber, ed. Marsha Siefert (Budapest and New York: Central European University Press, 2003). Zenon E. Kohut: Selected Pages of an Intellectual Biography 5 history of elites, the national question, imperial evolution, and Ukrainian- Russian relations — turned out to be in tune with certain new stirrings in Western historiography, especially with the “rebirth of narrative,” the turn to political history, and the personification of the historical process.^ The British scholar Isabel de Madariaga expressed the view that Kohut’ s book promised to become a classic in its field. Today, a decade and a half later, we see that her prediction turned out to be splendidly true. Still, if the publication of the monograph brought its author recognition in scholarly circles, it did not bring about any notable change in his professional activity. In March 1992 Zenon Kohut began work at the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies, University of Alberta, first as director of the newly established Stasiuk Program for the Study of Contemporary Ukraine and editor of the Journal of Ukrainian Studies, then as acting director (1993), and, from 1994, as full-fledged director of the institute, which is now one of the most successful Ukrainian-studies institutions in the West. Since 1998 he has also been the founding director of the Kowalsky Program for the Study of Eastern Ukraine. One of the secrets of the institute’s scholarly effectiveness is the emergence in the early 1990s of a scholarly core within it, consisting of Zenon Kohut, Frank Sysyn, and Serhii Plokhy. The “three musketeers” have become a common sight at international conferences, as well as in publishing and research projects dealing with early modem Ukrainian history, Ukrainian historiography and historical consciousness, the evolution of ethnic and national identity among the Eastern Slavs, and Ukrainian-Russian relations in the past and present. These are the problems that have come to the forefront in Dr. Kohut’ s scholarly activity, crowding out his previous enthusiasm for the socio-political history of eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Ukraine. In large part, they have also come to define the institute’s general scholarly profile. Although Zenon Kohut has not made any public pronouncement of his scholarly credo or taken part in discussions of a theoretical and methodological nature, the intellectual foundations of his work are solidly established. David Saunders includes him among the historians who work 5. Georg G. Iggers, Historiography in the Twentieth Century: From Scientific Objectivity to the Postmodern Challenge (Hanover, N.H.: Wesleyan University Press, 1997), 97-100. 6 Volodymyr Kravchenko within the national paradigm of the historical process.^ Indeed, his dependence on the tradition of Ukrainian statist historiography is quite apparent. This is evident not only in his choice of subject matter but also in his observations on particular issues, especially in his writing on “popular dissatisfaction” with the policies of the Russian government in Ukraine, the abuses of the Russian administration, the opposition of the Ukrainian elite to the Russian government, and the like. At the same time, Kohut’s work in Ukrainian studies quite clearly reflects the current state of the discipline’s evolution, which is associated with the renewal of the methodology and paradigms of the statist school of Ukrainian historiography under the influence of recent Western achievements in the humanities and sociology. The continuity of this process was ensured by the works of Ivan Lysiak-Rudnytsky, one of the greatest innovators and practitioners of Ukrainian historiography of the second half of the twentieth century, who contributed notably to expanding the scholarly horizons and overcoming the marginality of Ukrainian studies in the West.^ It was he, in large part, who prepared the intellectual ground on which it was possible not only to preserve and foster the national tradition, defending it from attack on all sides, but also to develop it on a contemporary methodological basis, modernizing Ukrainian studies and integrating them into present- day Western scholarship. Thanks to his broad erudition, a capacity for historiosophic generaliz- ations and predictions, an inclination to comparative studies, boldness in challenging the canon, and a particular intellectual nobility, Lysiak- Rudnytsky ’s work had an influence on the younger generation and inoculated it in some measure against the revisionist temptations and experiments with neo-Marxism that were widespread in Western society at the time. That influence is particularly evident in Orest Subtelny’s and Zenon Kohut’s works. From this perspective, Kohut’s article on the recent historiography of the haidamaka revolt, which introduces the reader to the atmosphere surrounding the battle of ideas in Ukrainian historiography in the 1970s, seems particularly illuminating. “The old myths,” he wrote, “challenged 6.

It was j probably no easier to study those relations in the West than in the Soviet |j Union. Until about the mid-1980s, such studies appeared to be burdened ' with ethnic prejudices cultivated, on the one hand, by Russian emigrants I who carried on the traditional great-power understanding of the history j of Eastern Europe and, on the other hand, by exiles from Ukraine whose work was largely defined by the stmggle for Ukrainian national identity.^ In turning to the history of Ukrainian-Russian relations.

To establish the topicality of these postulates, it suffices to refer to reeent Ukrainian historical publications. The Pereiaslav Agreement of 1654 between Ukraine and Russia produced and continues to produce numerous historical and historiographic works that, from the Ukrainian side, have a somewhat compensatory or confrontational character. Zenon Kohut’ s attitude to such works is fairly critical. In his words, rather than discussing questions of “union,” “reunion,” “alliance,” or “proteetorate,” it is more useful to establish the true interests and motives underlying the policies of both sides, with particular reference to the questions of what Khmelnytsky was trying to aehieve in conducting negotiations on the Pereiaslav Agreement, what plans the Muscovites had concerning Ukraine and Eastern Europe, and in what respeets their interests coincided and diverged. 10.

Kohut: Selected Pages of an Intellectual Biography 9 i No less persuasive in this respect is Dr. Kohut’ s understanding of the nature of Ukrainian-Russian relations in the mid- and late eighteenth I century. Thus, he explains the abolition of Ukrainian autonomy not by a |l mystical desire on Russia’s part to destroy Ukraine but as the result of perfectly rational motives on the part of an autocratic state that was adopting Western Enlightenment models and saw socio-political and i cultural unification as the key to the country’s effective development: “The evolution of the Russian Empire on Western absolutist patterns may [i be a key to explaining the change in Russia’s policies toward Cossack 1 Ukraine.”^^ Like Theodore Weeks in his later works, Zenon Kohut explains the I successful policy of integration of the Ukrainian lands into the Russian j Empire by the new prospects that the Russian government opened up to ; local elites in coopting them into the ruling stratum. Conversely, he i, notes the splintering of the Ukrainian elite, identifying two basic groups i within it with different attitudes to Russia — assimilationists and tradition- 1 alists. The former accepted the call to dissolve in the empire without reservation, while the latter tried to reconcile local interests with imperial I ones. I True, in writing of the divergence of the nobiliary and Cossack political traditions in the second half of the eighteenth century, Kohut does not always take account of the deep divisions in Ukrainian society along the lines of social estates and political orientations — divisions that existed long before the Enlightenment-inspired reforms of Russian tsarism. In this regard, the contradictions between Hryhorii Poletyka and the anonymous author of Istoriia Rusov were no less profound than the antagonism between nobles and Cossacks in the times of Ivan Vyhovsky or Ivan Mazepa. In considering the question of the Ukrainian elite’s entering the imperial service, Zenon Kohut definitely breaks with the populist and i statist understanding of that process as national treason. He holds that at 1 the time Ukrainians saw no contradiction between service to the Russian 13. Ibid., 11. I 14. We are therefore less than convinced by the findings of the Japanese historian Matsuzato Kimitaka when he speaks of a certain tendency to “combat Moscow” in Zenon Kohut’ s monograph on the absorption of the Hetmanate by the empire. See Kimitaka’ s article “ladro ili periferiia imperii? General-gubematorstvo ili malorossiiskaia identich- [ nost,” Ukrainskyi humanitarnyi ohliad 1 (2002): 76. I 10 Volodymyr Kravchenko state and to their homeland. His approach is thus consonant with the concept formulated by the Canadian historian Paul R. Magocsi of corresponding hierarchies of values that do not contradict one another. In this connection, along with socio-political problems, the important theme of Ukrainian national identity emerges in Kohut’s creative work. Zenon Kohut is one of the scholars who recognize the existence of early modem “nations before nationalism,” which differ from modem nations mainly in the level of social mobilization. In this sense, he is close to Ivan Lysiak-Rudnytsky, John A. Armstrong, and Anthony Smith. Accepting the theory of the modem nation as a constmcted entity, he nevertheless argues for continuity and succession between Cossack and modem Ukraine. At the same time, he places the emergence of modem Ukrainian nationalism only as far back as the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. He sees the so-called “Little Russian identity” as the transitional link between them. Little Russianism as a national and cultural phenomenon of Ukrainian life, past and present, is still considered an odious phenomenon, a form of ethnic pathology. In Ukraine it is associated above all with the inferiority complex and servility of those Ukrainians who acknowledge the superiority of all things Russian, exhibiting “the lack of the most elementary national instinct and ... political will,”^^ readiness to betray their own historical and cultural tradition for the sake of concrete personal gain, and the like. During the initial stage of Ukrainian nation-building. Little Russianism was condemned by such eminent Ukrainian publicists and thinkers as Mykhailo Drahomanov, Mykola Khvylovy, and levhen Malaniuk. Zenon Kohut approaches the study and evaluation of the Little Russian phenomenon as a scholarly historian, bringing it into the framework of purely scholarly discourse and showing how it was conditioned by the concrete political and social environment of Ukrainian society in the so-called “pre-national era.” Little Russian identity as depicted by Dr. Kohut appears, on the one hand, as a means of intellec- tual adaptation to the concept of “multiple identities and loyalties [that] were the norm before the advent of nationalism” and, on the other, as an initial stage of national development on the basis of the Little Russian 15. Danylo Husar Struk, ed., Encyclopedia of Ukraine (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1993), 3: 166. Zenon E. Kohut: Selected Pages of an Intellectual Biography 11 idea.^^ That process remained unfulfilled, as it was interrupted by the Russian government. In returning the Little Russian phenomenon to its appropriate historical context, Dr. Kohut does not deny its indefinite, ambivalent character. Unlike his many predecessors, however, he acknowledges the Little Russian legacy as “the beginning of modem Ukrainian nation building.” In my opinion, Kohut’ s innovative approach to Little Russian identity may be considered an important theoretical achievement of Ukrainian historiography of the 1970s and 1980s, along with Magocsi’s concept of multiple loyalties and identities, Roman Szporluk’s analysis of the dialectical development of the modem Ukrainian nation as the deconstmction of the old Polish and Russian nations, Orest Subtelny’s view of the contradictory relations between the processes of moderniza- tion and nation building, and so on. In one way or another, all of them reflect various aspects of Ukrainian-Russian relations. In recent years, concurrently with his research on the Little Russian idea and identity. Dr. Kohut has been actively studying the related phenomenon of the so-called “all-Russian nation” as the union of three branches — Little Russian, Great Russian, and Belamsian. He seeks particularly to establish the Ukrainian origin of that idea, the motives and goals of its co-creators, and its subsequent transformation. This in turn is associated with the rethinking of Russian national and political development, which uncovers its heterogen- eous and multicultural character and the multifarious relations between the national and imperial components of that process.*^ Thus, in Zenon Kohut’ s rendition, the history of the Ukrainian national idea appears as an aspect of a broad process of emergence and 16.

In practice this amounts to the demythologization of widespread notions of age-old Ukrainian-Russian unity and, by the same token, the need to further differentiate the national history of each of these peoples. Another important aspect of Dr. Kohut’s scholarly creativity — the historiographic — is directly associated with the political and national problems of the Ukrainian past. He considers the articulation of the histories of the East European peoples to be the central axis for the formation not only of the national ideology of the Russian Empire but also of the modem national identities of Russians and Ukrainians. Accordingly, the various interpretations of the Ukrainian past from the seventeenth century to the present reflect the corresponding stages of Ukrainian and Russian nation and state building on imperial and national grounds, turning historiography into a battleground of ideas. In the author’s own words, this approach differentiates his research from works published on the same subject by his contemporaries.^^ Zenon Kohut’s observations on various stages and peculiarities of the development of Ukrainian and Russian historical writing are extraordinar- ily interesting in this connection. After all, until the beginning of the nineteenth century Ukrainian and Russian history were considered currents of a single stream. Ukrainian historians believed that their studies were merely enriching broader Russian historiography. Consequently, in Kohut’s view, “For the most part, Ukrainian historiography was a step behind Russian imperial historiography and, accordingly, reactive to it. Ukrainian historiography had either to accommodate or to challenge evolving Russian and Polish historiographies.”^^ In turning to the study of the interrelation between historiographic and political processes, Kohut inclines to the view that “the pragmatic needs of Muscovite foreign policy determined the uses of history,”^® 18.

In this connection, he devotes particular attention to the initial and contemporary stages of Ukrainian-Russian debates on historical grounds. The key historical work that characterizes Ukrainian-Russian relations at the time Ukraine came under the suzerainty of the Muscovite tsar is I considered to be the Synopsis, published in three editions between the * i years 1674 and 1680. Produced in Ukraine in the clerical milieu of the 1 Kyivan Cave Monastery, in Russia it attained the status of an official, i canonical text, according to which the history of the Russian state was 1 studied until the mid-eighteenth century. However, one of the greatest ' paradoxes of this work was the absence of any mention of the paramount j| event of seventeenth-century Ukrainian history, the Khmelnytsky j Uprising. Consequently, scholars still discuss the problem of the national I identity of the Kyivan Synopsis, so to speak, characterizing it as either a Russian or a Ukrainian monument.^^ I Dr. Kohut defends the instrumental nature of this work, determined I by concrete political conditions in the life of the clergy of the Kyivan Cave Monastery during the period of the Ruin, especially its interest in I Russian protection. At the same time, he presents what I consider the ' most convincing explanation of its nature and reception: “By marshaling I all possible arguments to justify the tsar’s patronage of the Caves Monastery, the Synopsis, perhaps unwittingly, produced an alternate I vision of Russia. To the strong Muscovite tradition of regarding Muscovite Rus' as a continuous Orthodox dynastic state, the Synopsis added the idea of a proto-East Slavic tsarist patrimony. This idea emerged out of the Ukrainian experience. However, elevated by the Russian government to the status of an i official text, the Synopsis, in Zenon Kohut’ s opinion, exercised much less i I influence on Russian historical thought than is commonly believed. Most 1 1 Russian historians up to Nikolai Ustrialov preferred the traditional Concepts of Russia,” in Extending the Borders of Russian History, 21. 21.

This idea would appear to confirm the thesis of the American scholar Max Okenfuss about the general conservatism and hermeticism of Muscovite spiritual culture in the premodem period. In some measure it also corrects widespread historical notions of the “Ukrainianization” of Russian elite culture in the second half of the seventeenth century. The Russian imperial version of the historical process is no less influen- tial in the present-day historical consciousness of the Ukrainian people. “The Russian unity myth has been and continues to be so embedded in the Russian psyche that it is very difficult for Russians — ^from conservative nationahsts to hberal democrats — ^to acknowledge the right of Ukrainians to their own history and national identity.” “Thus the Russian historical outlook still stresses unity and stiU presupposes that much of the history and culture of Ukraine is part and parcel of the Russian experience. Such a view is in direct opposition to the emerging Ukrainian historical consciousness, which stresses an autochthonous historical process and differentiation from Russia.”^^ Ukrainian-Russian relations in current historiography and popular historical consciousness seem no less contradictory and paradoxical. One of Dr. Kohut’s most popular works of recent years, History as a Battleground: Russian-Ukrainian Relations and Historical Consciousness in Contemporary Ukraine, forces one to give thought to this. It is worth recaUing that analogous problems receive extensive consideration in Frank Sysyn’s articles on historiographic images of Cossackdom and Bohdan Khmelnytsky and Serhii Plokhy’s articles on debates among Ukrainian and Russian historians about present-day pohtical boundaries, the Pereiaslav Council of 1654, and pohtical claims to the Crimea. Assessments of the current state of Ukrainian historical studies constitute yet another important subject represented in Zenon Kohut’s recent articles. It should be recalled that in the late 1980s and early 1990s Western scholars made considerable efforts to raise the status and prestige of Ukrainian studies in the Western academic world. At the same time, they did a great deal to elevate historical studies in Ukraine to interna- tional standards, promote their conceptual renewal, and introduce them to the world intellectual forum. 23. Zenon E. Kohut, History as a Battleground: Russian-Ukrainian Relations and Historical Consciousness in Contemporary Ukraine (Saskatoon: Heritage Press, 2001), 55-7, 60. Zenon E. Kohut: Selected Pages of an Intellectual Biography 15 Present-day Ukrainian historiography continues to bear the burden not only of scholarly tasks but also of national and socio-political ones. Consequently, it remains in a state of conflict between the need to develop a nation-wide discourse and the challenge of postmodernism, which contradicts national narratives. It would appear that Dr. Kohut sees no contradiction in principle between present-day historiographic discourse and the tasks of Ukrainian nation and state building. He is convinced that the challenge of postmodernism does not mean that the epoch of narrative has come to an end, while objectivity in scholarship does not negate the existence of historical myths, which can and should be employed in the formation of the new Ukrainian historical consciousness. In the early 1990s Zenon Kohut considered that Ukrainian historians should help society discover its own (Ukrainian) national identity. “The formation of a new Ukrainian historical consciousness is still in a rudimentary stage, limited to the more nationally conscious elements of the population. A rapid and widespread introduction of a Ukrainian view of history is difficult, because imperial Russian and Soviet rule has resulted in the common acceptance of the dominant interpretations, even among many Ukrainians. Moreover, there is a consensus on only some themes and interpretations. At least a preliminary codification of a Ukrainian view will occur with the adoption of new curricula and the pubhcation of new textbooks. Adoption in school curricula would also make the Ukrainian historical view more prevalent among the wider pubhc.”^\"^ Nonetheless, actual developments show that, paradoxically, Kohut has somewhat underestimated the vitality and popularity in present-day Ukrainian society of the Little Russian national consciousness about which he wrote in such convincing fashion. In the course of one of his many trips to Ukraine he had occasion to see this for himself when a monk at the Mhar Monastery undertook to teach a foreign tourist a lesson (in broken Ukrainian) about the traitor Mazepa and the all-Russian unity of the Orthodox Slavic peoples. Perhaps the scholar recalled this episode on learning that left-wing deputies of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, historians by education, had managed to ensure the deletion of particular pages in a textbook of Ukrainian history, even as the imperial and Soviet historical and cultural legacy in its original form began to make a comeback in everyday 24. Ibid., 53^. 16 Volodymyr Kravchenko popular consciousness through the mass media, primarily television, and the policy of the current Ukrainian leadership. As a result, from the late 1990s, Dr. Kohut’s publications and addresses began to grow ever more critical of official Ukrainian historical studies. Initially, such criticism was impersonal in eharacter. In time it became more concrete, arising in conneetion with particular publications by contemporary authors. Finally, the directive of the president of Ukraine “On the Commemoration of the 350th Anniversary of the Cossack Council of 1654,” dated 13 March 2002, and the declared readiness of the academie establishment to take part in its realization prompted an extraordinarily sharp reaction on the part of Zenon Kohut and his colleagues Frank Sysyn and Serhii Plokhy. In their “Appeal to Ukrainian Historians on the Occasion of the Commemoration of the Pereiaslav Council,” dated 14 June 2002, the planned action was characterized as an attempt “to exploit history for the legitimation of a possible change in Ukraine’s foreign-policy orientation and a reorientation of the historical consciousness of Ukrainian society,” to “lend legitimacy to those forces in Ukraine and beyond its borders that seek to revive the empire,” and to continue the infamous “tradition of Soviet times of truckling to Moscow and the ‘elder brother. The gradual evolution from the euphoria of the early 1990s to bitter disappointment with developments in Ukraine in recent years that Zenon Kohut appears to have experienced along with most of the Ukrainian diaspora poses the question of the reception of the work of Western Ukrainists in contemporary Ukraine and of the dialogue between the “homeland” and the “trans-Atlantic” traditions of present-day “readings” of the Ukrainian past. As is well known, since the late 1980s foreign Ucrainiea, represented by two main currents — the traditional national-statist and modem national discourses — has been actively introduced into present-day eulture and scholarship in Ukraine. Works by the best representatives of various generations of Western scholars are becoming available to the Ukrainian reader. Let us hope that the publications of Nataliia Polonska-Vasylenko, Oleksander Ohloblyn, Ivan Lysiak-Rudnytsky, Omeljan Pritsak, George Luckyj, Ihor Sevcenko, Roman Szporluk, George Grabowicz, Bohdan Krawehenko, Orest Subtelny, and John-Paul Himka will soon be joined 25.

Aside from the language barrier, r however, there remains a significant mental barrier to dialogue between I present-day Ukrainian and Western historians of Ukraine. li Today, the name and works of Zenon Kohut are known to practically every professional in the field of Ukrainian history. This does not mean, j however, that they have become common currency among the intellec- j tually inclined reading public. The conceptual novelty of his views on the r age of the Hetmanate is recognized by renowned historians^^ but is not I I always appreciated even by very acute intellectuals outside the academic j community ; I know from personal experience that the concept of Little Russian identity developed by Zenon Kohut continues to arouse tacit disapproval I on the part of some patriotically inclined Ukrainian historians for whom ; j Little Russianism is not a scholarly category but a moral and ethical one. Nevertheless, it is difficult for me to agree with the author’s complaint I , that he is published but not read in Ukraine. Traces of his influence are i ' quite apparent in the most recent works of certain young historians. I Perhaps this strikes the author as insufficient. In that case, it would be i desirable to include him as a member of a council of experts of the I Supreme Attestation Commission of Ukraine or at least a specialized scholarly council, preferably at the doctoral level. Today, as a scholar and organizer of scholarly work. Dr. Kohut plays the extraordinarily important role of mediator between various currents I and levels of Ukrainian studies, which are undergoing a transformation of their own as they arrange themselves into a certain structural whole. I Zenon Kohut is a Ukrainian by origin and consciousness; one who I maintains a stable emotional link with Ukraine, past and present. At the j I same time, he is an intellectual product of present-day Western i historiography, representing its North American school. ' In the West his scholarly and organizational activity contributes in 1 large measure to reorienting Western Slavic studies from Russocentrism ' 26.

In Ukraine the works of Zenon Kohut are helping to foster the methodological renewal of Ukrainian historiography and its gradual approach to world standards. At the same time, they may be regarded as a step toward the creation of academic Russian studies in Ukraine, the absence of which reflects what Mykola Riabchuk has described as the paradoxes of “belated nation formation.” Thus Zenon Kohut is continuing the tradition of his teacher Ivan Lysiak-Rudnytsky, aspiring to a synthesis of continuity and modernization in the contemporary Ukrainian intellec- tual tradition. Translated by Myroslav Yurkevich The Making of the Generation of 1917: Towards a Collective Biography Olga Andriewsky^ Each generation must, out of relative obscur- ity, discover its mission, fulfill it, or betray it. Frantz Fanon, The Wretched of the Earth In the summer of 1891 a group of university students calling themselves the Brotherhood of Taras (Bratstvo tarasivtsiv) gathered at the gravesite of the Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko. The students met in Poltava Gubernia, where they had had been hired by Oleksander Rusov, the famed statistician and folklorist, to collect information for the gubemial zemstvo. While working and living together in the Ukrainian countryside that summer, the students spent many hours discussing the plight of the Ukrainian people and what they could do to change the situation. Frustrated by the leadership of the “Ukrainophiles,” by what they saw as the complacency and narrow emphasis on cultural issues of the older generation of Ukrainian activists, the young men vowed to devote themselves to the liberation of the Ukrainian people. “From behind their love, [the Ukrainophiles] see neither ignorance, poverty, starvation, nor the enormous economic and spiritual decline of the country,” they declared in their profession de foi} “And only to the extent that we honour and respect those sincere Ukrainophiles, our parents, do we. * Part of the research for this article was made possible by a grant from the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies.

''Profession de foi molodykh ukraintsiv,” Pravda 17, no. 50 (1893): 201-7. 20 Olga Andriewsky nationally conscious Ukrainians, not wish for a further development of the Ukrainophile movement in our society.” As Ivan Lypa, one of founders of the Brotherhood of Taras, later recalled, “We wanted, on the one hand, to do something that would allow us to remain [Ukrainian], and, on the other hand, we fervently longed for serious, all-consuming political involvement.”^ The notion of rebellious youths at odds with their elders was certainly nothing new or extraordinary in the history of the intelligentsia. By the second half of the nineteenth century, generational conflict had become a familiar theme in European social discourse and particularly in post- reform Russia.^ The Ukrainophiles, in fact, had themselves at one time been regarded as young radicals, because of their populism, their active identification with the narod, and their intense interest in Ukrainian folk culture. The denunciation of the Ukrainophiles by the Brotherhood of Taras, in this respect, represented a traditional rite of passage for young intellectuals, a symbolic rejection of the “fathers” by the “sons.” By 1897, after several years of agitation among the Ukrainian intelligentsia, the Brotherhood itself lapsed into inactivity. Yet, in retrospect, this youthful gesture proved to be an omen. The revolt against the Ukrainophiles and the founding of the Brotherhood of Taras presaged the emergence of a new generation of political activists — arguably, the first generation of modem Ukrainian political activists in the Russian Empire, a cohort that ultimately led the Ukrainian movement in 1917. The aim of this essay is to sketch, in a preliminary fashion, the beginnings of a collective biography of what I call the Generation of 1917, the men and women who promoted a Ukrainian political agenda in the Russian Empire before the revolution and who became the leading advocates of Ukrainian autonomy and independence in 1917. The formation of this cohort — indeed, its very existence — has received little attention from historians of Ukraine, who have tended to focus either on individual biography, political ideas, or the social stmcture in general to explain the course of the revolution and what they regard as the “failure” of the Ukrainian project.\"^ Indeed, the relative absence of serious research 2.

On the generational idea, see, for example, Robert Wohl’s classic study. The Generation of 1914 (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1979). 4. One exception to this trend in historiography is the work of Andreas Kappeler. He Making of the Generation of 1917 21 I on the social networks that constituted the Ukrainian movement has I obscured the dynamic of the political transformation that took place in j Ukraine in the two decades before the revolution, a transformation that i culminated with the creation of the Central Rada on 17 March 1917. It has also perpetuated the myth of a “weak Ukrainian intelligentsia move- j ment,” a myth promoted for many years by Soviet historiography and i accepted uncritically by many historians in the West.^ The Generation of M 1917 is, in this regard, a key to understanding the larger workings — and ill potency — of the Ukrainian movement itself. j Who were the members of the Generation of 1917? The term, as i applied here, refers to those men and women who were bom between ij 1875 and 1885, became politically active around the turn of the century, I and came to support — and by 1917 worked energetically on behalf 1 of — the idea of Ukrainian political autonomy and statehood. The most 5 prominent members of this group included Symon Petliura (b. 1879), I Dmytro Doroshenko (b. 1882), Volodymyr Vynnychenko (b. 1880), i Dmytro Antonovych (b. 1877), Dmytro Dontsov (b. 1883), Hanna ; Chykalenko (b. 1884), and Mykola Porsh (b. 1877). Indeed, much of the I leadership of the Central Rada belonged to the Generation of 1917.^ The I General Secretariat of the Central Rada, the chief executive body, was, I for example, entirely dominated by this cohort — Petliura, Vynnychenko, j Borys Martos (b. 1879), Mykola Stasiuk (b. 1884), Pavlo Khrystiuk (b. I 1880), Serhii lefremov (b. 1876), Ivan Steshenko (b. 1873), Khrystofor I Baranovsky (b. 1874), and Valentyn Sadovsky (b. 1886). Notably, the i Generation of 1917 did not include Mykhailo Hrushevsky (b. 1866) who, I although he played a leading role in the Ukrainian national movement ] 1 I I relies on Miroslav Hroch’s model of national development to examine the Ukrainian elite in the Russian Empire at the end of the nineteenth century, a framework that, in Hroch’s ! classical rendition, is linked to the rise of the bourgeoisie and large-scale changes in the socio-economic structure. The focus of Kappeler’s work, however, is on locating the I j emergence of a Ukrainian political class at the end of the nineteenth century (Phase C).

University of Oxford, 1981), 425. 22 Olga Andriewsky before and during the revolution, was clearly an exceptional figure by virtue of his age, background, and life experience/ Nor did it include, strictly speaking, the Brotherhood of Taras: most of its members were closer in age to Hrushevsky and were well out of school by the time the Generation of 1917 arrived. In this respect the Generation of 1917 was very much the product of a particular place and time, of a unique social and pohtical experience associated with the last two decades of the Russian Empire. Let us turn to its remarkable “debut” at the turn of the century. The Social Context The emergence of the Generation of 1917 coincided with several important social trends and developments in late imperial Russia. One was the demographic explosion. In the second half of the nineteenth century the rate of population growth in the Russian Empire — and in the Ukrainian gubernias, in particular — was among the highest in the world. Between 1870 and 1914 the population in the Ukrainian gubernias nearly doubled. Within the nine Ukrainian gubernias, moreover, population growth among Ukrainians — predominantly a rural population — signifi- cantly exceeded that of the non-Ukrainian population. As the census of 1897 indicates, the Ukrainian population was steadily increasing its share of the total population in Ukraine (a trend most evident in the southern gubernias, that is, the areas of newest settlement — Katerynoslav, Kherson, and Tavriia (see table 1). By 1897, in fact, most Ukrainians — 52.4 percent — were under twenty years of age, and they represented nearly forty percent of the entire population. At the turn of the century, the Ukrainian population was growing, becoming younger, and strengthening its demographic hold on the Ukrainian gubernias. The Generation of 1917, in effect, stood on the crest of a powerful demographic wave. Symon Petliura was one of twelve children, nine of whom survived to adulthood. Similarly, Petro Bilon (b. 1879), a Ukrainian activist from Kyiv Gubernia, was one of twelve children. Oleksander Koshyts (b. 1875), the composer and ethnographer, had six brothers and sisters.^ Lydia Strutynska, a member of the St. Petersburg 7. Hrushevsky grew up in Tiflis, in the Caucasus, and, until 1914 spent much of his life outside of the Ukrainian territory of the Russian Empire. 8. Vasyl Mykhalchuk, Symon Petliura ta ioho rodyna.

As Lydia Strutynska notes in her memoirs, she was greatly influenced by her brother-in-law, a gymnasium teacher, and most of her cousins were drawn into the Ukrainian movement in similar fashion. “ She herself married a prominent Ukrainian student activist — also the son of an Orthodox priest from Volhynia — Valentyn Sadovsky. A second and related development was the dramatic expansion of higher education at the turn of the century, at precisely the time when many members of the Generation of 1917 were entering the system. Between 1897 and 1907 student enrollments in the Russian Empire nearly tripled, growing from 31,427 to 92,697.^^ The greatest gains were made in the field of women’s higher education, particularly after 1905 when the number of programs for women rose to thirty and the number of female students reached 23,000.^^ Other areas of higher education also expanded significantly. During the decade after 1897 the number of (male) university students doubled, rising to 36,382 in 1907-8 (see table 2). Enrollments in technical programs grew at an even faster pace, increasing in a decade from 6,000 to nearly 16,000 by 1907 and reaching 23,329 by 1913-14.^'^ Not only were more students admitted to existing 9.

Even highly specialized programs, like pedagogical, commercial, agricultural, and veterinary institutes, were affected by the boom in higher education. This system-wide expansion had a considerable effect in the western borderlands of the empire. Three of the nine universities in the Russian Empire were located in Ukraine (Kharkiv, Kyiv, and Odesa) and Kyiv and Kharkiv, in particular, continued to play a leading role in the development of higher education. Indeed, these two cities featured some of the oldest institutions of higher education in the empire (the Kyiv Mohyla Academy, established in 1632 and reconstituted in 1819 as the Kyiv Theological Academy; and Kharkiv University, established in 1805) as well as some of the newest (the Kharkiv Technological Institute, established in 1885; the Kyiv Polytechnic, estabhshed in 1898; the Kyiv Higher Courses for Women, 1872-86, revived in 1906; the Kharkiv Higher Courses for Women, established in 1907; the Kyiv Institute of Commerce, estabhshed in 1906; and the Kharkiv Institute of Commerce, estabhshed 1909). In addition, new centres of learning emerged in the Ukrainian gubernias. Katerynoslav, for example, a hub for the rapidly growing metallurgic industry and, by 1914, the fourth largest city in Ukraine after Odesa, Kyiv, and Kharkiv, developed primarily as a centre of technical education. A mining institute was founded in the city in 1899 and then an institute of commerce, a polytechnic (1916), and higher courses for women (1916). Likewise, the number of Ukrainian students attending institutions of higher education increased substantially after 1897. While the exact number of students of “Little Russian”^^ origin cannot be determined, we do know, for example, that the percentage of “Orthodox Christians” in the universities remained steadily above seventy percent between 1899 and 1912. In the technical institutes, the percentage of “Orthodox Christians” actually rose from 52.3 percent to 68.5 percent during this time.^^ Hryhorii Kozlovsky, a student in Moscow, remembered that the 15. In the second half of the nineteenth century, as a way of emphasizing and promoting the “Orthodox” character of the system of education, it became bureaucratic practice to classify students only in confessional terms. 16. Ivanov, Studenchestvo Rossii, 1 95-20 1 ; Susan K. Morrissey, Heralds of Revolution: Russian Students and the Mythologies of Radicalism (Oxford and New York; Oxford University Press, 1998), 12. Making of the Generation of 1917 27 schools at the time “were full of Ukrainians and in the hallways of these institutions of higher education one could hear the Ukrainian language at every step.”^^ The sudden proliferation of Ukrainian student hromadas, or clandestine societies, throughout the empire offers further proof of this trend: Kyiv (1893), Kharkiv (1897) Moscow (1898) St. Petersburg (1898), Tartu (1898), Warsaw (1901), and Odesa (1902).^® Paradoxically, one of the beneficiaries of the expansion and modern- ization of the education system in the Russian Empire was the traditional Ukrainian elite, the families of Orthodox priests, hereditary Cossacks, and petty gentry rooted in the countryside. Social origin remained as yet a crucial determinant in access to higher education: only 5.4 percent of university students and 14.8 percent of students attending technological institutes in 1906 came from a peasant background.*^ Thus the dramatic increase in student intake most deeply affected the rural and gubemial elites in Ukraine, strata that, especially in the lands of the former Cossack Hetmanate, remained wedded to a remarkable degree to the culture and values of old Ukraine. Years later, thinking back on his childhood in rural Chemihiv, My kola Kovalevsky (b. 1892) recalled a world in which many members of the provincial gentry, descendents of the Cossack starshyna living on remote estates, had not yet learned to speak Russian.\"® It was this culture that now revitalized its links with the urban centres and institutions of higher education. Indeed, what had been a steady trickle of Ukrainian students in the nineteenth century now turned into a mass movement of sorts, a movement reminiscent, in certain respects, of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries when nobles, Cossacks, and clerics routinely sent their sons to study at the Kyiv Mohyla Academy and the kolegii (colleges) of Ukraine. 17.

Among the better known activists, for example, Oleksander Skoropys (b. 1880 in Podilia, Kyiv Polytechnic), Lev lurkevych (b. 1885 in Kyiv Gubernia, Kyiv University), and Kateryna Serebriakova (b. 1887 in Kharkiv Gubernia, St. Petersburg Medical Institute) belonged to the gentry; Valentyn Sadovsky (b. 1886 in Volhynia, Kyiv University / St. Petersburg Institute of Technology), Mykola Halahan (b. 1882 in Chemihiv Gubernia, Kyiv University), and Oleksa Sokolovsky (b. 1884 in Poltava Gubernia, Kyiv Polytechnic) were sons of priests. Many of the activists were descendents of Cossacks — now legally classified as “nobles” or “peasants” — for whom their Cossack ancestry remained a defining point of their social and cultural identity. Thus, for example, Andrii Zhuk, a “peasant” activist from Poltava Gubernia, always described himself as a member of “an impoverished Cossack family.”^^ In fact, the ranks of the Ukrainian movement were dominated by this Cossack element: Symon Petliura; Dmytro Doroshenko (b. 1882 in Chemihiv Gubernia, St. Petersburg University / Kyiv University); Pavlo Krat (b. 1882 in Poltava Gubernia, Kyiv University); Isaak Mazepa (b. 1884 in Chemihiv Gubernia, St. Petersburg University); and Andrii Livytsky (b. 1879 in Poltava Gubernia, Kyiv University). This component was further reinforced by an energetic contingent of young Cossacks from the Kuban, the only territory where the Zaporozhian Cossack social order still survived (Mykola Riabovol, b. 1883, Kyiv Polytechnic, and Stepan Manzhula, b. 1885, Kyiv Polytechnic).^^ 21. Andrii Zhuk, “Korotki biografichni vidomosty,” Library and Archives Canada, MG 30 Cl 67, Andrii Zhuk Archives, vol. 1, file 5. Numerous authors (Boshyk, Kappeler) have pointed out the preponderance within the Ukrainian national movement of activists from Left-Bank Ukraine, and especially of the sons of clergy, who constituted some twenty percent of known participants. This data, which is usually based on late nineteenth- century social categories imposed by imperial authorities, systematically underestimates the Cossack element within the movement. For biographical data of those who became active in the Revolutionary Ukrainian Party, see Boshyk, “The Rise of Ukrainian Political Parties,” Appendix VI. 22. Mykola Riabovol became one of the main student leaders at the Kyiv Polytechnic during the Revolution of 1905. In 1917 Riabovol headed the Kuban Territorial Council and promoted the federation of Kuban with Ukraine. He was assassinated by Denikin’s men in June 1919 for following this independent line. Making of the Generation of 1917 29 In his memoirs, Mykola Kovalevsky, himself a descendent of the Cossack starshyna, remembered how, during his youth, his sleepy district of Sosnytsia came alive every summer as university and gymnasium students returned home for their summer vacations. The young students, he recalled, would arrive from “all comers of the Russian Empire” bringing with them fresh news, new books, and even illegal publica- tions.^^ Similarly, Viktor Andriievsky (b. 1885), the son of a Poltava landowner, described the enormous impact that university students like Oleksa Sokolovsky, Borys lurev-Pekovets (Kyiv University), lurii Kollard (Kharkiv Institute of Technology), and Borys Martos (Kharkiv University) had on him and his fellow gymnasium students.^'* Indeed, the growing number of Ukrainian student hromadas at the turn of the century signaled the emergence of a distinctly Ukrainian “youth culture,” a dynamic social network of young men and women educated in urban centres of the empire but with deep ties to the Ukrainian hinterland and its culture. In contrast to the legally sanctioned “Little Russian” zemliachestva / zemliatstva (regional associations / self- help organizations), the hromadas shared a common devotion to Ukrainian culture, to a language and traditions officially proscribed by imperial authorities.^^ Unlike the young men who had gone off to study in universities in the 1870s and 1880s and — with a few notable excep- tions— had immersed themselves in the all-Russian student movement, this new generation of Ukrainian students now formed its own “critical mass” in the institutions of higher education, a group with a budding sense of collective identity and purpose. The Political Context The universities and technical institutes of the Russian Empire provided a fertile meeting ground for the growing numbers of young Ukrainians, a place where they could come together, exchange news and information, discuss politics (an illegal activity until 1905), and — ulti- 23.

Nonetheless, it is impossible to understand the formation of the Generation of 1917 without an appreciation of the specific political context in which it developed. Indeed, the Generation of 1917 came of age in a time of profound political, social, and economic upheaval, an era of momentous changes in Russia. In the remainder of this essay, I shall focus my remarks on one defining moment, an episode that, in the long mn, helped transform an entire generation of young Ukrainians students into modem political activists — the student protests of 1899 and the birth of the first mass-based Ukrainian political party in the Russian Empire. The student protests of 1899 were, without a doubt, a pivotal event not only for Ukrainian students, but for the empire as a whole. At least one historian, Richard Pipes, has argued that the strikes that broke out at Russian universities that spring were, in fact, the beginning of the Russian Revolution, the start of a movement that, in his own words, “led directly to 1917.”^^ The universities of the Russian Empire, of course, had a long tradition of student protests, and in the decade after the reactionary University Statute of 1884 students regularly came into conflict with university authorities over the new restrictions, and particularly over the ban on student organizations.^^ Between 1884 and 1899, however, such incidents remained largely isolated and episodic. In this respect the events of 1899 were unparalleled. What began as a spontaneous protest in St. Petersburg in Febmary 1899 — a demonstration against an apparently unprovoked attack by police on students during the annual celebration of the founding of the University of St. Petersburg — soon escalated into an organized, empire-wide, student strike movement involving more than 25,000 students. When authorities responded with harsh counter- measures— expulsions, arrests, exile, and even army conscription — the 26. Richard Pipes, The Russian Revolution, 1st ed. (New York: Knopf, 1990), 3-4. 27. The notion of “relative calm” in the universities between 1884 and 1899, a point made by Richard Pipes, is deceptive. Many of the students who led the strike movement in 1899, like Dmytro Antonovych, had a history of run-ins with authorities. Antonovych, for example, had been expelled from Kyiv University — the university where his father taught — in 1895 for his part in student disturbances and was later thrown out of Kharkiv University. 28.

Making of the Generation of 1917 31 conflict turned into an ongoing war between the students and the govern- ment, a political struggle that lasted until 1905. The student movement, in effect, politicized an entire generation of youth, Russian and Ukrainian alike. It drew thousands of students out of their narrow student concerns — a world of boring lectures, overbearing professors, and high-handed university administrators — and into a wider universe of social protest and radical ideas, however vaguely defined. Moreover, it demonstrated the effectiveness of organized and purposeful political action. For a number of Ukrainian students already inclined towards politics, this proved to be a particularly powerful lesson. The Ukrainian hromada at Kharkiv University, for example, played a leading role in organizing and directing the student protests in Kharkiv in 1899. Among other things, the students made use of a relatively new technol- ogy— the hectograph — to print and distribute political bulletins. As one of the few existing underground student associations, the hromada, in fact, became closely involved with the work of the Kharkiv coordinating committee. Mykhailo Rusov (b. 1876), lurii Kollard (b. 1875), and Oleksandr Kovalenko (b. 1875) were subsequently expelled for their role in the student movement. Most importantly, the effectiveness of the all-Russian student movement and, in particular, the role that hromada leaders played in mobilizing students in the spring of 1899 galvanized the development of a Ukrainian student network and encouraged hromada leaders to think in much more ambitious, all-Ukrainian terms. At a secret conference in Kyiv in August 1899, representatives of the Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Tartu hromadas announced the creation of an all-Ukrainian student union. The aim of the union, as stated in their declaration, was twofold: (1) to halt the assimilation of Ukrainian students and “return them to service on behalf of the Ukrainian people,” and (2) to bring to the attention of"
