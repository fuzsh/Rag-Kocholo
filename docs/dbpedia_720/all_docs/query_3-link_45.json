Because of the climate and other differences, many articles run in only one or two of the four editions. You can tell which edition of Sunset you read by looking at the contents page of the magazine. At the upper left corner you will see the name of the edition: Northwest edition for readers in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. Central edition for readers in northern and central California, northern Nevada, Utah, and Colorado. Southern California and Hawaii edition for readers in coastal Southern Cali- fornia and Hawaii. Desert edition for readers in southeastern California, southern Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico. In the index listing, N denotes Northwest edition; C, Central edition; S, Southern California edition; and D, Desert edition. The word \"all\" tells you that an article has appeared the same month and page in all four editions. Index listings are written as follows: May 76 N, C (May, page 76, Northwest and Central editions).
