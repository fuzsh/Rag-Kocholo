        "text": "My RiserBond 1270 TDR came back from DigiTrace repaired and freshly calibrated. (DigiTrace is at http://www.digitrace.com/ )\n\nGreat people to work with and excellent turn-around.\n\nI put the returned TDR to work right away at both my island QTH and Tom K0TTC’s island home station.\n\nA great device to have available, though not certain I could recommend every ham have one. With three stations and lots of ham friends who have opportunities to explore with a TDR, I’ve found having one useful. If I had one feedline to inspect it would be silly to have this gear around.\n\nIn one recent inspection it found a pulled coax that didn’t test very well. I am thinking that one of the ends needs rework. Swapping to feedline pull #2 was the short term solution and put the station effectiveness back to norms.\n\nI do not believe my RiserBond 1270a was “officially” calibrated for a very long time, even when I acquired it in 2006.\n\nSo it is wonderful to put any worries about being out of spec aside as well as the return-to-duty service that was absolutely needed.\n\nAs the repairs and calibration process use several hours of bench time, the costs reflect that service investment.\n\n73\n\nSteve\n\nK9ZW\n\nIt wasn’t until a friend told me that he just bought an Elgato Stream Deck, asking me what did I think about them? That I realized I bought the larger one three years ago and have been using it in my hamshack, but hadn’t mentioned it much here.\n\nFirs the link: https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck-xl\n\nSo what we have is 32 key keypad, with each key’s led face fully customizable to match the resulting key action you assigned.\n\nI have mine set up to do normal station chores, and if left long enough to default to a multikey display of my callsign.\n\nThe minor scripting is simple and the results are fabulous.\n\nThere are 6-key, 15-key and 32-ley versions of the Stream Deck (Sept 2022 street prices were $80, $120 and $210 respectively.)\n\n73\n\nSteve\n\nK9ZW\n\nI missed this while it was happening. I was looking to update my old software to model my new antenna configurations and found out about the change.\n\nAs Roy W7EL decided to retire, he made public his EZNEC antenna modeling software (compiled form only).\n\nhttps://eznec.com/\n\nThere is also some neat stuff on NEC-5 end, where there is a collaborative update to the latest version (NEC5 X11) thanks to some great ham inputs! https://eznec.com/NEC-5.htm\n\nThe AC6LA add-on AutoEZ is something I plan to check out. https://eznec.com/AutoEZ.htm and https://ac6la.com/\n\nAutoEZ is interesting as it an an Add-On to EZNEC which in also in essence an Add-On to NEC. AutoEZ appears Excel-based, EZNEC is Visual Basic 6 (obsolete version) with some Fortran modules, and the core NEC compiled Fortran (Intel Visual Fortran with the mkl math libraries).\n\nBelow the “–” line I will include some background from either Roy W7EL (website archived copy or QRZ.com) or a QSO Today Podcast interview he did with Eric 4Z1UG.\n\nWell worth checking out all of these programs.\n\nAlso a series of dedicated books by ON5AU that should be considered if you are going to put EZNEC to work:\n\nhttp://www.on5au.be/EZNECPro7.html\n\nhttp://www.on5au.be/advanced_modeling_book.html\n\nGL and 73\n\nSteve\n\nK9ZW\n\n—\n\nContinue reading →\n\nOld enough to learn to type on some nondescript Smith-Corona in school. Then later Army trained on an IBM Selectric that I typed so many reports on that I can still feel the IBM keyboard under my fingers.\n\nComputer keyboards I used were initially part of the machine or pretty much paired with a particular setup. The teletype keyboards of the first terminals, to various chunky keyboards designed by unemployed torture instrument designers, to various chicklet/membrane keyboards perhaps never intended for more than two minutes of steady typing when they were conceived.\n\nThinking who more than gamers to harshly evaluate keyboards? Informally surveyed several hams and several family who were gamers for their suggestions.\n\nLots of differing suggestions – learn Dvorak, go for an ergonomic design that looks like it came from Star Trek, try one of the battleship vintage keyboards, or have the early IBM unobtanium model xyz123 restored for me… lots of differing suggestions.\n\nCommonality was found in looking for keyboards that use superior switches, as the switch is where much of the feel comes from, get one that is heavy enough to not move while typing, possibly remappable to allow PC/MAC & QWERTY/DVORAK changes, and has low latency, in many of the suggestions I received.\n\nA few keyboards came an went, including a “Das Keyboard 4C TKL Wired Tenkeyless” which had such low contrast key labeling that it was exchanged.\n\nMain keyboards both work and home, where I wanted the ten-key numeric pads ended up “Das Keyboard 4 Professional Wired Mechanical Keyboard, Cherry MX Brown Mechanical Switches, 2-Port USB 3.0 Hub, Volume Knob, Aluminum Top (104 Keys, Black)” and where I wanted the smaller ten-key less format (at the iMac mostly) as “Keychron K8 Tenkeyless Wireless Mechanical Keyboard for Mac, Hot-swappable RGB Backlight, Bluetooth, Multitasking, Type-C Wired Gaming Keyboard for Windows with Optical Brown Switch, Aluminum Frame.”\n\nThe transition has been marvelous. These keyboards type like the Selectric I am used to, though with a slightly less of a key stroke. Having an extra USB hub on some of the keyboards is also a plus.\n\nGood Stuff and Recommended!\n\n(For links you can check Amazon, the direct Manufacturer’s Website or do a net search.)\n\n73\n\nSteve\n\nK9ZW\n\nOn my main Skyneedle was supposed to go a RadioWavz Barrett Hexbeam with Broadband option. The antenna was bought about four years ago and health and then a home QTH move kept it from going up in the air.\n\nRadioWavz built this antenna with the high power and heavy duty options, and it is purported to work as a rotatable dipole on 160/80/60/30m, a 2el wire beam on 40/6m and as a 3el(+) wire beam on 20/17/15/12/10m. Original configuration was using three antenna drop feedlines, but two can be combined with a harness they offered.\n\nRadioWavz helped me out sending new element guides made of metal which replaced the DOA original fiberglass guides, replacing most of the parts missing from the original antenna (though the spare parts ordered have never arrived) and sold me a upgraded support rope set made of a Kevlar type material.\n\nIn the antenna building process twice I have had damage from deer getting into the antenna.\n\nFirst incursion pulled a number of elements loose and broke one of the smaller fiberglass arm pieces. My calls and emails to RadioWavz had not been answered, when I figured out who supplied the fiberglass. Ordered new fiberglass parts direct and made the repair.\n\nSecond deer incursion again pulled some elements loose but this time half of the 40m element with insulators and spacer cord went missing. Presumption is it was caught on the deer’s rack and carried away until it could be shaken loose. The wire element I can cut locally but as my spare parts supply of extra insulators and cordage was never shipped, I’ve had to have the special insulators locally fabricated and I’m scrounging for similar cord. Again my emails and calls have not been answered by RadioWavz.\n\nWhat I have learned is that the business was sold to the next generation, and the founders retired to another state, plus the next generation is up to their eyeballs dealing with a child’s severe health issues.\n\nI get it. Family is WAY more important, period.\n\nContinue reading →"
