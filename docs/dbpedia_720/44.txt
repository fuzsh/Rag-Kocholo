Server-based entertainment company Inspired Broadcast Networks has created a Nuts-branded skill game, which will be distributed across its Itbox network in more than 8,000 pubs across the country.

The game will feature a range of features from the magazine, including Nuts Pub Ammo and Nuts Top Tens, in addition to celebrity pictures and exclusive Nuts content.

IPC Ignite!, which publishes Nuts magazine, will run a promotional campaign in Nuts and Loaded and across its portfolio of websites. The game will also be promoted on itbox.com.

Clair Porteous, head of marketing for men's lifestyle at IPC Ignite!, said: "This is a perfect partnership allowing Nuts to reach its audience in an interactive and entertaining way in a very targeted environment."

Anne De Kerckhove, chief operating officer of Inspired, said: "Nuts' readership is a perfect fit with our core target audience of Itbox players.

"We have worked very closely with IPC Media in the past with our TV Times game. This was a great success and this new deal is an excellent partnership between two brands that work hand in hand."
