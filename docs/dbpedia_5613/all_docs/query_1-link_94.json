        "text": "Cooper Hoffman — Licorice Pizza\n\nYou wouldn’t have seen this unless you live in the greater Los Angeles area, the only city where Licorice Pizza has screened so far. For the rest of us, late December is when we’ll get to see this latest Paul Thomas Anderson flick starring the son of the late, long-time PTA collaborator Phillip Seymour Hoffman.\n\nLicorice Pizza is Cooper Hoffman’s film debut. And based on the reviews so far, and a goddamn Golden Globe nomination, it would seem that Cooper has the goods. It’s got to be quite a burden to fill your father’s shoes — a struggle everyone on this list surely endures — especially when those shoes belonged to a masterclass actor taken too soon. But Cooper may have what it takes to step out of his father’s shadow and establish himself as an actor in his own right. I’ll let you know when I see Licorice Pizza for myself.\n\nWyatt Russell — The Falcon and the Winter Soldier\n\nWyatt Russell is textbook Hollywood Royalty. The son of two film superstars, Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn, Wyatt was born into acting. His power couple parents even gave him a cameo appearance in their rom-com Overboard when he was just a baby.\n\nSince then, young Russell has made appearances mostly in bit parts in a bunch of different projects. From a tiny appearance in Arrested Development, a minor role in Richard Linklater’s Everybody Wants Some!!, to the underappreciated AMC show Lodge 49, AND a leading role in a Black Mirror episode over the course of his career, Russell finally hit the big time with a role in the MCU as John Walker, the anti-hero Captain America. No doubt we’ll be seeing more of him.\n\nMichael Gandolfini — Many Saints of Newark\n\nThe hype behind The Many Saints of Newark was unreal. It had been years since David Chase had been in the game, and here he was coming out of a virtual retirement to return to arguably the most iconic TV show to hit the air. To top it off, James Gandolfini’s son Michael would be playing the role of young Tony in his film debut. Talk about filling big shoes.\n\nWhen it came out, the reviews were…good. Michael’s performance was solid. But when you’re stepping into the role of Tony Soprano, whose performance by James Gandolfini, your Dad, has been lauded as the greatest acting of all time, you’ve got an absolutely Herculean challenge ahead of you. And for a guy whose sole screen appearances beforehand were little more than bit parts, (like his appearance as a busboy in Ocean’s 8) it’s impressive that he was able to get by at all.\n\nBillie Lourd — Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker\n\nBillie Lourd is the only child of the beloved Carrie Fisher, who was Hollywood Royalty herself. Leia was a true Hollywood princess. Carrie’s parents were actress Debbie Reynolds and singer Eddie Fisher, starlit mid-century icons. Safe to say, Billie Lourd comes from serious entertainment pedigree.\n\nShe’s only just begun to step on to the scene. Her roles thus far have been small parts in popular franchises, most notably in the role of Lt. Connix in the recent Star Wars sequel trilogy. She’s appeared more substantially in multiple American Horror Story installments, Booksmart, and has an even bigger role in an upcoming Ticket to Paradise, where she plays the daughter of divorced parents played by George Clooney and Julia Roberts. Now that’s some good casting.\n\nO’Shea Jackson Jr. — Den of Thieves\n\nCooper Hoffman is acting in a movie directed by a long-time collaborator of his father’s. Michael Gandolfini stepped into the role that defined his father’s career. O’Shea Jackson Jr–son of O’Shea Jackson, otherwise known as Ice Cube–literally played his own father in Straight Outta Compton. Even the most committed method actors can’t hold a candle to that level of dedication.\n\nSince his debut role as his own Dad, O’Shea has been on the move, appearing in indie darlings like Ingrid Goes West, to blockbuster flicks like Godzilla: King of Monsters. His role in heist thriller Den of Thieves indicated that he’s got some acting chops. In upcoming roles, he has a TBA part in the Ewan McGregor led Obi-Wan Kenobi. O’Shea Jr. is here to stay, you’ll definitely be seeing more of him.\n\nMiles Robbins — The Day Shall Come\n\nLike Wyatt Russell, Miles is textbook Hollywood Royalty, but like, college-level textbook. Mile’s parents, Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon, are serious acting powerhouses, setting a certain tone to his trajectory. His parents are actors’ actors, creatives dedicated to “capital A” acting. No disrespect to Kurt and Goldie, but Tim and Susan are Oscar-winning performers, for whatever that’s worth at the end of the day.\n\nAgain, like Wyatt, his first role was in a film starring his mother; he played a bit part as a little boy in Dead Man Walking. As he grew up, he played Mulder and Scully’s teenage son in the X-Files, Dee Dee Ramone in Baz Luhrman’s The Get Down, and finally demonstrating some acting skill, a minor role in biting British satirist Chris Morris’ The Day Shall Come. Once Miles gets the right role, he’ll blow up.\n\nLily-Rose Depp — Silent Night\n\nLily-Rose Depp has hit the ground running. Born in Neuilly-sur-Seine France, the daughter of Johnny Depp and French singer, actress, and model Vanessa Paradis might as well have been born in Versailles; she’s that Hollywood Royal. But privileged as her leg up in the acting world may be, that does not discredit her ability."
