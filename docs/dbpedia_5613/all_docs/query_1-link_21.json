        "text": "It may sound at first like MadLibs, but it’s apparently true. The Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. and Coretta Scott King helped pay the hospital bill for Julia Roberts’s birth.\n\nThis is, actually, not new news, but if you never heard it before don’t feel too bad. The unearthed story has been blowing minds online for about a week and went double-viral on her recent birthday. The reminder originated on Twitter, when a fan posted a fun video edit of Roberts looking fab in the 80s and 90s with the caption “going to see mother today.” (The implication here being a trip to see Ticket to Paradise in theaters.) A quote tweet with the added “Martin Luther King Jr paying for her birth is still a little known fact that sends me” took off, with some wondering how they’d never heard about this, and others asking if it was true.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nOn Friday, which not-coincidentally was the Academy Award-winning actress’s 55th birthday, the internet came through with a video in which Roberts explained her literal origin story to Gayle King. The two spoke at an A&E Networks and History Channel “HISTORYTalks” event in Washington, D.C in late September of this year.\n\n“Her research is very good,” Roberts mugged to the crowd, when King prompted her for the story. “The King family paid for my hospital bills.”\n\n“Not my family,” Gayle King corrected. “Martin Luther King, Jr. and Coretta—did you guys know that about Julia Roberts?” the interviewer then asked the crowd, who all murmured “no.”\n\nRoberts explained that while her parents couldn’t pay for the hospital bill, they did have a theater school in Atlanta. At the time, Coretta was having a rough time finding a local school that would accept her children, it being the South in the mid-1960s. But when Roberts’s mother took her call, she said, “sure, come on over.” As such, everyone became friends, and, when a financial emergency came, Julia's parents were helped out of a jam.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nIn 2013, the Georgia-based writer and actor Philip DePoy wrote an essay for ARTS ATL that detailed the progressive and, at times, experimental work that the Roberts's Actors and Writers Academy was up to. He described how, in 1965 at the age of 15, he appeared in a production based on Joel Chandler Harris stories, and, playing anthropomorphized animals, he and Yolanda King shared a kiss. DePoy is, as he put it, “primarily Caucasian,” while King was “not,” and this led to a “tangential member of the Ku Klux Klan” targeting the theater and blowing up an automobile near the flatbed truck that functioned as a mobile stage.\n\nLuckily “it wasn’t much of an explosion,” though it did set the car on fire, and “the cops who had been watching the show just wandered over, talked to [the perpetrator], put him in handcuffs and took him away with very little energy.”\n\nDePoy then explained that the Roberts’s family and their school had a great influence on many people. “Yolanda King spent the rest of her life involved in theater; my brother, Scott DePoy, who had joined the workshop before I had, continues to work all over the Southeast. Eric Roberts eventually went to study at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. I understand that even his younger sister got involved in acting.”"
