        "text": "Having spent more than 30 years as one of the biggest movie stars on the planet, Julia Roberts has done it all when it comes to the red carpet – including, a month ago, wearing a Moschino gown emblazoned with framed photos of her old friend (and Ticket to Paradise co-star) George Clooney. That tongue-in-cheek look was typical of the playful approach to formalwear Roberts has pursued for her most recent return to the circuit – think retro Gucci suiting and peep-toe boots.\n\nRead more: Critics’ Choice Awards 2024 Red Carpet\n\nBut to attend the 2023 Critics’ Choice Awards on Sunday night, Julia chose to keep it classic – albeit in an unexpected brand. The 55-year-old turned to Daniel Roseberry, the Texan creative director who has been putting the surreal back into Schiaparelli since 2019, for her look. For the maison infamous for its metal breastplates, flying saucer hats and avant-garde jewellery (remember Bella Hadid’s lung necklace at Cannes?), Julia’s long-sleeved black gown with sunburst detail looked positively muted.\n\nIt may have been devoid of extreme embellishment, but the slinky dress was a natural choice for Julia, who has always been fond of a great black gown with a hint of sparkle. Her minimal jewellery and vampy black manicure served as subtle accents to a look that allowed the star’s tumbling red waves and radiant smile to take centre stage.\n\nAs fashion critic Anders Christian Madsen noted of Schiaparelli’s space cinema-inflected spring 2023 couture collection, “… If you removed the science fiction elements, you’d be left with a series of sophisticated black dresses” – three words guaranteed to appeal to a fifty-something movie star of Roberts’s calibre."
