        "text": "Zooey Deschanel\n\nZooey Deschanel, a beautiful singer and actress, has starred in New Girl and in the cult classic, 500 Days of Summer. You might think that with all that success, she would have a swimming pool full of money outside of her mansion, but the star has instead chosen to stay humble.\n\nShe is oddly frugal with her money, choosing to shop only for the bare necessities as well as planning for her life after acting. Also, she is known for giving to a lot of charities and organizations including Farm Sanctuary, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and The Trevor Project.\n\nJay Leno\n\nJay Leno has a reputation as being one of the most famous talk show hosts of all time. He is also one of the wealthiest ones in the industry. With a career spanning three decades, he has an estimated worth of a mere $350 million. For Leno, he says he learned the meaning of money while working at a young age.\n\nSince retiring from The Tonight Show, he has lived strictly off the profits from his stand-up career. That means all of the savings from all those years on TV are locked up somewhere safe and sound, waiting for a rainy day.\n\nPaul McCartney\n\nPaul McCartney has been one of the most famous people on the planet for the better part of half a century. He was a member of the super famous band The Beatles as if they need an introduction, but you wouldn’t know he was uber-famous by the way he lives his life.\n\nHe came from humble and modest roots and has never been known to be greedy. Instead, he is known for his activism and giving to charities throughout the world. For instance, he decided to send his daughter Stella to a state school rather than a private institution.\n\nTyra Banks\n\nTyra Banks has a degree from Harvard Business School and is a supermodel and business mogul. Banks prefers to be reserved when it comes to showing off her wealth. She says she got her sense of money from her mother, who played a big part in helping her establish herself as a model.\n\nIn a New York Times interview, she said she is frugal and has been big on saving since she was a little girl. While she does like to pamper herself with visits to the Cheesecake Factory and expensive cosmetics, she maintains a close relationship with her accountant.\n\nHilary Swank\n\nAfter winning Oscars for her performances in Million Dollar Baby and Boys Don’t Cry, Hilary Swank has cemented herself as a serious actress. But the actresses’ life was not always the glitz and glamour. She grew up in a trailer park in Washington, and even after moving to California with her mom, the two lived in the car.\n\nIt does not matter how popular and successful she has become, she maintains a comfortable life but is not one to flaunt. Her finances are kept in check by bargain hunting, and she prefers to spend her money on her family.\n\nCarrie Underwood\n\nAs the winner of the fourth season of American Idol, country singing legend Carrie Underwood’s fame shot up into the stratosphere. Her rise to stardom happened quickly but she didn't let it change who is. In a Rachel Ray interview, Underwood stated that, generally, she lives like a typical American.\n\nWhile she was dating her now-husband, NHL star Mike Fisher, she said the two would have date nights at Subway more often than not. Furthermore, she loves grocery shopping and cutting coupons. There is nothing more satisfying than choosing your own fruit and veg.\n\nMark Zuckerberg\n\nAlthough Mark Zuckerberg founded Facebook, making him one of the richest and most influential people in the world, he lives very modestly when you factor in how stinking wealthy he is. He wears typical street clothes and does not show up to Facebook Headquarters in a limo.\n\nHe got married in his green backyard and has stated many times that he is more concerned with his work than his wealth. According to one source, he is so unimpressed with wealth that he plans to donate 99 percent of his Meta stocks over the course of his life. So who are going to be the lucky ones?\n\nMariska Hargitay\n\nMariska Hargitay is best known for playing a starring role as Lieutenant Olivia Benson on the NBC police procedural show, Law and Order: Special Victims Unit. It was once leaked that the star made a whopping $400,000 per episode, and Forbes Magazine ranked her the second-highest-paid actress in the world in 2014.\n\nWhile she has a lot of zeros attached to her salary, that does not mean she is constantly on spending sprees and looking for the new Gucci bag. She always plans for the future, because she knows that Hollywood is very unstable and things can change over night.\n\nTobey Maguire\n\nWhile the Spider-Man star has been the tail-end of plenty of jokes throughout the years, people may forget that he made a boatload of money for the role and is considered on of the wealthiest actors of his time. When the third movie of the franchise was made, Toby had made over $36 million.\n\nThe fact that he has kept his wealth under wraps is a testament to just how cautious he is with his cash. Tobey had a tough upbringing and learned how to be frugal early on. According to the Spiderman actor, material possessions are meaningless to him, and he'd rather have nothing than live extravagantly.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio could possibly be the most recognized actor in the world. All of his success and work have amassed him a great big pile of cash. With his standing as one of the most respected actors in showbiz, Leo has decided not to spend too much on himself but on projects that are important to him. He owns three Teslas, which are better for the environment, as he is a serious conservationist.\n\nHis foundation, The Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, has raised up to $3 million for the World Wildlife Fund’s tiger habitat. Additionally, he has donated $15 million in grants to environmental organizations throughout the world.\n\nShailene Woodley\n\nShailene Woodley is the star of the Divergent series, one of the best young adult sci-fi franchises ever. So it is safe to say that Woodley is well-off. Being as famous and successful as she is, she is still found purchasing used clothes and is an avid advocate of the environment.\n\nIn a THR profile, most people who know her best call her “grounded” and “authentic.” She confessed that she has yet to splurge on anything, which for someone at her level is quite impressive. She makes her own beauty products and lives off the land whenever she can.\n\nKristen Bell\n\nKristen Bell's rise to fame began with small acting gigs, but her talent soon landed her significant roles that propelled her into the spotlight. Alongside her successful career, she shares a loving marriage with Dax Shepard, a fellow actor, and together they have built an impressive fortune estimated at $25 million. Despite their financial success, the couple remains grounded and down-to-earth.\n\nIn fact, they pride themselves on their frugality, referring to themselves as \"hillbillies at heart.\" They embrace a thrifty lifestyle, even going as far as utilizing coupons. Their humble approach to life is exemplified by their modest wedding expenses, totaling just $142, including the cost of gas.\n\nShia LaBeouf\n\nFor someone channeling their inner hobo with their look, you can call Transformers star Shia LaBeouf anything but extravagant. The star has been acting since the age of ten but he stayed grounded. He gives all of the credit for not being in material interest to his parents. he prefers life to be modest, and the simpler the better.\n\nLaBeouf grew up in a family of artists, which made him appreciative of his success, and there’s no reason to flaunt that to the world, according to the star. He said in interviews, “If I have enough money to eat I’m good.” So, he doesn't need that much to be happy and as long as his stomach is satisfied, the show can go on.\n\nHalle Berry\n\nHalle Berry is undeniably a hugely successful actress, boasting an Oscar to her name. Her extensive career has earned her millions, but she remains passionate about her craft and eagerly embraces new projects. Despite her financial success, Berry leads a remarkably modest life, prioritizing the work that she deeply cherishes. In various interviews, she has expressed her indifference towards extravagant possessions such as fancy cars or expensive jewelry.\n\nInstead, Berry adopts a prudent approach by consistently saving her earnings and recognizing the unpredictable nature of the entertainment industry. This practical mindset reflects her ability to navigate the ever-changing tides of Hollywood with resilience and wisdom.\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar\n\nPerhaps she needs no introduction, but Sarah Michelle Geller starred as the hugely popular Buffy in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. She had a wildly successful career after the show until she decided to settle down and enjoy a quiet life. While the start has some serious money, she has revealed that she lives a fairly normal life with her two sons, shopping at Whole Foods, just like an average Jane.\n\nGeller learned not to take money for granted from her single mother after her dad left the family. She embraced the value of life and the significance of money, being a means and not something to chase her entire life.\n\nDave Grohl\n\nFoo Fighters frontman and former Nirvana drummer, Dave Grohl, has amassed some serious bank throughout his three-decade-long career. He has made an estimated $225 million, all thanks to his music. But the rock star gets worried about spending too much money too fast.\n\nHe has a hard time spending the money and is still afraid of going broke because he never finished high school. He has his family to take care of, which makes him more frugal than one might think. This grounded mindset reinforces Grohl's determination to maintain a stable and secure future.\n\nJennifer Lawrence\n\nJennifer Lawrence is one of the best-paid female stars in Hollywood. She made a ton of cash starring in the Hunger Games franchise and proved her acting skills in movies like Silver Linings Playbook. Her talent has translated into substantial wealth. While she should live like a queen with the money she’s made, she chooses not to. She lives in the very same apartment she did before she got her fame.\n\nIn an interview with Fabulous magazine, Lawrence emphasized her upbringing and the values instilled in her, highlighting the importance of appreciating the value of money. Her grounded approach serves as a testament to her humility and ability to prioritize financial responsibility, even amidst her remarkable achievements.\n\nSarah Jessica Parker\n\nWhile the character she portrayed in \"Sex in the City\", Carrie Bradshaw, wasn’t one for modesty or subtlety with money, the same cannot be stated for Sarah Jessica Parker. In 2008, during an interview, Parker spoke out about the importance of being responsible with money.\n\nAs a kid, she wore hand-me-downs, and to this day loves going to thrift stores and finding bargains. She grew up on welfare and had humble beginnings, which also helped shape her view toward money. Her humble beginnings have undoubtedly shaped her perspective on money, fostering a grounded and practical outlook on life.\n\nMick Jagger\n\nAs the leader of the iconic Rolling Stones, you might think that Mick Jagger loves the finest things in life. But while he does like to party, he is more frugal than he appears and appreciates the modest things in life. He is aware of how much he spends and has been described by his ex-wives as “pretty tight” compared to how others might think of him.\n\nHe says he was always taught to fix things when they break instead of throwing them away, and not to take his entire entourage on vacations to the French Riviera like some stars do today.\n\nAshley Greene\n\nAshley Greene’s performance in the Twilight franchise made her a bonafide star in Hollywood. With all the dough she made over the years, no one would blame her if she shopped, traveled, and flaunted just a little. But she manages to stay modest despite all of the hype.\n\nHer father told her she needs to be frugal with her money and save, that way she could support herself if a dry spell came up or if she was waiting for a role of a lifetime to come up. She keeps track of all of her spending and apparently won’t pop for a first-class ticket on an airplane.\n\nBrandon Boyd\n\nWhen you imagine the life of a rock star, what comes to mind? Mansions and trashed hotel rooms? Not for Incubus lead singer Brandon Boyd. He prefers a simplistic way of life. He could have bought a huge mansion but instead lives in a cabin in Santa Monica, California.\n\nThe home cost $3.5 million, which is kind of a lot of money considering its small size and was built in 1923. The historic house has a huge backyard and a swimming pool, so it’s not like Brandon is hurting, but he could certainly be a lot more ostentatious.\n\nKeanu Reeves\n\nKeanu Reeves has made it pretty clear that he is not one for the luxuries of the elite. He has no plans in becoming a Hollywood King and he prefers life with its simple things. But he certainly could be after making The Matrix films.\n\nInstead, he chose to give over 80 percent of his earnings to the special effects and costume design team. He is often caught on public transportation, eating at common restaurants, and hanging out at the park. Being so laid back made him into a global meme. Whoa, just whoa.\n\nJose Mujica\n\nJose Mujica is Uruguay’s former president and was known as the “poorest president,” and he is also known for many other things. During his presidency, he refused to live in the official presidential residence and opted to move to a farm where he grows flowers for sale.\n\nHe donated 90 percent of his $12,000 salary in order to support charities in the area so they can help those in need. He comments “ I’m called ‘The poorest president,’ but I don’t feel poor. Poor people are those who only work to try to keep an expensive lifestyle and always want.”.\n\nElliot Page\n\nIn case you were living under a rock for the last decade, Elliot Page is kind of a big deal. The star made it big by portraying the titular character in Juno and has been a big hit ever since. Page's illustrious career notwithstanding, he keeps a low-key profile, especially in terms of his home.\n\nIn fact, until 2014, the actor was living in a small Hollywood Hills house with two bedrooms and one and a half bathrooms. He purchased the small cottage for less than a million bucks and sunk some dough into fixing it up, including renovating the bathroom.\n\nJ.K. Rowling\n\nThe scribe who brought us the Harry Potter series, J.K., Rowling is worth over $1 billion. When she initially wrote the book, she never thought it would bring her to where she is today. It wasn’t so long until she realized that she had no need for all that money, and started donating to charitable organizations and causes.\n\nShe even says that “Many parts of my life are perfectly ordinary, one could even call it, but that’s what I like about it.” She dons normal clothes, is frugal with money, and uses her husband’s name in her private life.\n\nVincent Kartheiser\n\nDuring his tenure on the immensely popular show Mad Men, the talented actor Vincent Kartheiser chose to reside in a modest one-bedroom apartment, despite his subsequent meteoric rise to fame. However, as his career flourished, he decided to enhance his living space by embarking on a series of renovations. Demonstrating his practical nature, he saw an opportunity to capitalize on his investment when the time came to sell the property.\n\nBuying the apartment in 2014 for $457,000, he strategically navigated the real estate market and ultimately sold it for a commendable $808,000. This astute move showcases both his financial acumen and the rewards of his hard-earned success.\n\nBritney Spears\n\nAlthough Britney is one of the most famous divas of her generation when not on stage, she attempts to live a low-key life. She shops at normal, everyday stores like Target and Walmart. She is known for buying everything from cosmetics to toys to everyday items.\n\nThe surprising part is that she does this all on her own, even though she could certainly afford to have someone do it for her. She would rather brave the throngs of adoring fans and shop like an everyday person. And of course, she usually grabs a Starbucks coffee on her way out.\n\nMatthew McConaughey\n\nMcConaughey is known for his laid-back, Texas accent, and is one of the biggest stars on the screen. His down-to-earth ethos is clear when he was living in an Airstream trailer near the beach so he could catch the best waves whenever they presented themselves.\n\nHe spoke of the Airstream, “ It’s two seconds from making your bed to putting your coffee on the stove.” Of course, once he got married--shattering the hearts of adoring fans everywhere--and had kids, he moved from his trailer to his real house to raise his family.\n\nClint Eastwood\n\nFrom his movies, including Dirty Harry and Gran Torino, you could swear that Clint Eastwood would have a couple of garages worth of some great cars, but this is not the case. Although he has made hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of his career, he prefers to drive around in his ancient GMC Typhoon.\n\nThis limited edition SUV was made for one year in the early 90s and looks similar to a GMC Jimmy SUV. The little car has some giddy-up and Eastwood does have other faster cars. The Typhoon only costs $20,000, though.\n\nWarren Buffett\n\nWarren Buffett, the renowned investor, and businessman, boasts a staggering net worth of $70 billion. Surprisingly, despite his immense wealth and status as the second richest American, Buffett has chosen to reside in a modest $31,000 home that he acquired back in 1950. Known for his down-to-earth demeanor, the Oracle of Omaha embraces a philosophy that celebrates a simpler and more frugal lifestyle.\n\nIn fact, there are reports suggesting that Buffett doesn't even have a fondness for money itself. It is widely speculated that he generously donates a significant portion, up to 90 percent, of his earnings to charitable causes, exemplifying his commitment to making a positive impact on society. This remarkable generosity only reinforces his reputation as a philanthropic icon.\n\nKatie Couric\n\nIn her intrepid journalism career, Katie Couric earned $55 million. She became famous on The Today Show and the CBS Evening News but refrains from flaunting her wealth. She doesn’t shop at high-end stores or eat at the most expensive restaurants. Give her a hunk of beef and a trip to Target and she is content.\n\nFor all of the time she spent in the spotlight, how amazing is it that she has never got swept up in an extravagant lifestyle? Whoever said that there wasn’t much money in journalism has definitely never met Katie Couric.\n\nRenee Zellweger\n\nRenee Zellweger’s parents were immigrants who came to the U.S. with absolutely nothing. She knows you have to earn everything you are given. Since becoming a superstar actress, she hasn’t had to pinch pennies like she used to. But that doesn’t mean she has stopped.\n\nZellweger is so frugal, that she shops for groceries using coupons, despite being worth upwards of $45 million. Of course, she can afford to splurge, but she would much rather spend on what she needs instead of what makes her happy. She seems to have a great head on her shoulders.\n\nEric Clapton\n\nThis is one that actually kind of makes sense. Eric Clapton used to be caught up in the rock and roll lifestyle. But after the tragic death of his son, Clapton slowed things down and cleaned himself up. Nowadays, even though he is worth a whopping $250 million, he lives as if he only has a couple thousand.\n\nHe likes wearing comfortable clothes that will be durable and long-lasting. He stays away from big drunken parties, but he does have one vice involving his large art collection. He said once that it took such a horrific event in his life to center him and make him realize and embrace the most significant things in life.\n\nDarius Rucker\n\nDarius Rucker came from a very modest and humble background, and surprisingly enough he still lives that way. He may have been a part of Hootie and the Blowfish, but the former rock star is happily living the settled-down life with his wife and kids now.\n\nPerhaps that’s what inspired him to go solo and reconnect with his country roots. Rucker still records albums and tours but makes sure there is always time for his family. Whatever his next big project will be, it is good to know he will always be the same person. And that person is not Hootie, right?\n\nEva Longoria\n\nEva Longoria made nearly $400,000 per episode on \"Desperate Housewives\" and has made over $35 million in her career. But still, she’d rather stay in most weekends and just relax, rather than fly to France or Spain and traipse the beaches while eating pricey food. It helps that she has invested some money in a restaurant.\n\nWho needs Domino’s delivery when you can get your own restaurant to make you something? She is also a devoted mother and won’t break away from her kids to attend any of the big parties. Instead, she throws her own backyard BBQs.\n\nSteve Carrell\n\nPeople might identify Steve Carrell as a talented comedian, but his lust for Target is dang serious. In fact, it is a borderline obsession. He says he can’t go inside the store without buying something and whenever he comes across something he can't get his eyes off before he knows it, they are in his shopping bag.\n\nLeave some for us, Steve! And what does he love to buy in his favorite store? Cargo pants, of course. He calls the pants “comfy but uncool.” During his time as a star, we believe he has done enough cool things to be able to be comfortable every now and then.\n\nJimmy Kimmel\n\nJimmy Kimmel might be more in love with Costco than his wife. He confessed that he wishes he could have been married there instead of in whatever beautiful location he ended up in. He has also admitted that he lost his wedding ring and went to Costco to have it replaced.\n\nYes, he knows it's probably not good quality as the previous one he had, but when you love something (like Costco, you love it for life). This might be a one-way, dependent relationship, but it is nice to know that even the stars roam the aisles of Costco for the next great free sample and get froyo in the food court.\n\nMartha Stewart\n\nWhen it comes to discovering her next remarkable find, the illustrious Martha Stewart, the epitome of home living expertise, surprises many with her affinity for big box stores like Costco. While she has been an influential icon for years, few are aware of her fondness for perusing the aisles of this popular warehouse retailer. In fact, it is a widely recognized fact that Stewart has collaborated with Costco's own name brand, Kirkland, to create a line of delectable foods.\n\nMoreover, she has been spotted, much like the average shopper, patiently waiting in the checkout line at this beloved bulk store. This down-to-earth approach to shopping only further endears her to admirers, illustrating that even renowned personalities appreciate the convenience and value of everyday shopping experiences.\n\nDakota Fanning\n\nDakota Fanning has been a star since she was ten years old. She really left an impression with her role in the Twilight movies. As famous as she is, she won’t stop going to Walmart and doesn’t care if you see her there. During the filming of \"Breaking Dawn in Baton Rouge,\" for example, she didn’t try to hide at all while shopping at the megastore.\n\nWhen she was spotted by fans and asked to take pictures, she happily said yes. As it turns out, Fanning is both down-to-earth and kind-hearted. Like many, give her the simple stuff and she is content.\n\nColin Farrell\n\nColin Farrell didn’t know how to handle his stardom when he finally made it big. He began partying, like so many do, and ended up in rehab. Now he lives a little more under the radar, driving around in a Ford Bronco from the 90s, instead of a fancy convertible.\n\nOf course, the car is old and might break down at any moment, but Farrell doesn’t care. He is emotionally connected with it and sees no reason to part. In his life, it has been one of the most reliable things, so he plans to stand by it as it stands by him.\n\nSuze Orman\n\nDespite having amassed considerable wealth throughout her career, Suze Orman, a renowned personal finance expert, and best-selling author, continues to embrace the importance of frugality and wise financial choices. Surprisingly, even with the freedom to never work again, she finds joy in utilizing coupons while grocery shopping, appreciating the value of every little saving. Orman's commitment to financial prudence extends beyond her personal habits.\n\nAs a financial advisor, she emphasizes the significance of savings and retirement planning for individuals of all income levels. Recognizing that many Americans struggle to accumulate savings, Orman encourages everyone, regardless of their earnings, to prioritize retirement planning and start saving money, thereby fostering a more secure and prosperous future.\n\nKate Middleton\n\nWhile most celebs dread being caught wearing the same outfit twice, the Princess of Wales has no problem whatsoever rocking the same look more than once, no matter how many times she's been photographed in it. It may seem very unroyal and the least expected thing to be done by a member of the blue-blooded family, but things have changed and so have future kings and queens.\n\nFor example, she's been seen in this elegant champagne-colored ensemble at three different events (2010, 2011, and 2012), only changing her shoes and accessories. How relatable! It's safe to say that she really likes that outfit, and rightfully so.\n\nTiffany Haddish\n\nTiffany Haddish grew up in foster care and got her big break only at 37. Because fame is relatively new to her, she often forgets that she's expected to behave a certain way so she does things that are not always expected from celebs and notable people.\n\nShe's such a lover of Groupons, that she caught the attention of the company and they offered her to be their sponsor.
