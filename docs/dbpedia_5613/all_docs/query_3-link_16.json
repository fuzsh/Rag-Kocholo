        "text": "Jennifer Love Hewitt\n\nHewitt started her career with television commercials. Her first break came with the show ‘Party of Five’, where she nailed the character of ‘Sarah Reeves’ and became Hollywood’s sweetheart! Soon, she bagged roles in hit horror movies like ‘I Know What You Did Last Summer’ and its sequels.\n\nIn 2014-2015, she made repeated appearances in ‘Criminal Minds,’ but an unexpected pregnancy made her leave the show right away. Sad for her fans, indeed! Now a doting mother of three children, Hewitt happily married Brian Hallisay. She is a full-time mother and has decided to give her whole self to her family.\n\nJulia Stiles\n\nThe world was introduced to a young Stiles when she was only a little eleven-year-old girl. In the year 1993, she was a part of the show 'Ghostwriter.’ What made her capture the attention of people around the world was getting a chance to share the screen with big names, like Brad Pitt and Harrison Ford, in 1998's ‘Wicked’!\n\nHer star shone, and luck took a different turn when she acted in ‘10 Things I Hate About You’ alongside the legendary Heath Ledger. After this, Stiles got roles in blockbuster films like the ‘Jason Bourne films, ‘Mona Lisa Smile,’ ‘The Prince and Me,’ ‘Out of the Dark,’ and ‘Silver Linings Playbook.' In 2017, she appeared in a small TV series, ‘Riviera.’\n\nJennie Garth\n\nPeople were introduced to Garth in the early 90s through the super hit television show ‘Growing Pains.’ This was her very first notable appearance on screen before proceeding to land the role of her life! The character of Kelly Taylor in ‘Beverly Hills, 90210’ gave Garth the chance to win the hearts of people around the world.\n\nHer career took off with films like ‘What I Like About You’ and also the revival of the ‘90210’ film. With husband David Abrams, she had jointly ventured into the reality TV world and filmed ‘The Jennie Garth Project.’ She may not be constantly in the limelight, but she is still going and has alot to offer the industry.\n\nClaire Danes\n\nThe world first saw Danes when she appeared as Angela Chase in the famous teen series ‘My So-Called Life’ in 1994. However, Danes’ most famous role to date had been in the modern remake of ‘Romeo + Juliet,’ alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in 1996. She won the hearts of millions towards the end of the 90s with her acting skills in big-budget films like ‘Les Miserables’ and ‘The Mod Squad.’\n\nHer work in the title character of ‘Temple Grandin’ caused the world to shower her with praise and accolades, as her performance was extremely convincing. Her main role in the series ‘Homeland’ had been so outstanding that it won her the prestigious Golden Globe for Best Actress in Television Drama Series.\n\nAmanda Bearse\n\nThe world came to know Bearse after she played Peggy and Al Bundy’s neighbor in the ever-successful ‘Married with Children.’ She nailed the character of banker Marcy Rhoades D’Arcy, who constantly challenged Al’s chauvinistic views. Bearse continued with her director and actor’s journey after this show with ‘Mad TV,’ ‘Reba,’ ‘Dharma and Greg,’ ‘The Jamie Foxx Show,’ and ‘Two Guys, a Girl, and a Pizza Place’.\n\nBearse has never hidden her sexual orientation and is an inspiration for the LGBT community. She is happily married to her partner, Carrie Schenken. In recent years she has put acting aside and is getting involved in directing and producing.\n\nDebbe Dunning\n\nFrom 1992 to 1999, Dunning appeared in ‘Home Improvement’ as the feisty assistant ‘Tool Time Girl’ Heidi. However, this show was the only shining star in her entire career. No matter how hard she tried, she found it difficult to escape the little assistance carector.\n\nShe had no hits after that, even after acting in ‘Wicked Wicked Games’ in 2006 and many other TV movies. She leads a content life with the three beautiful children she had with her ex-husband, Steve Timmons, a professional volleyball player. These days she is very rarely heard of and remains 'Home Improvments's ' beloved star.\n\nMandy Moore\n\nMoore stepped into film after climbing the stairs of her successful singing career. Her name was shot to immediate fame with the release of the album ‘So Real.’ With her debut, ‘Candy,’ in 1999, she occupied the 41st rank on the Billboard Hot 100. And by getting listed on VH1’s 100 Greatest Women in Music, Moore made all her fans around the world super proud!\n\nIn the early 2000s, the world saw her alongside Anne Hathaway in ‘The Princess Diaries,’ and also in the romantic drama ‘A Walk to Remember.' The one role that would make her memorable, despite her many films, is the character of Rebecca Pearson in the famous sitcom ‘This Is Us.’ It remains her biggest role to date.\n\nTia Carrere\n\nThe world saw a singer, an actor, and a model in Carrere. She became a household name when she starred in the long-running daytime soap opera, ‘General Hospital.’ After appearing in other shows like ‘MacGyver’ and ‘The A-Team,’ the role she became most famous for was the excellent portrayal of Cassandra Wong in ‘Wayne’s World.’\n\nAnd we’ll tell you another anecdote, which not many people know, but Carrere’s voice has such an angelic quality. It won her lots of fans, as well as a Grammy in 2011 for the Best Hawaiian Music Album! The actress’s personal life has been quite a tumultuous ride, and she’s been divorced twice.\n\nLark Voorhies\n\nWhen Lisa Turtle in ‘Saved by the Bell’ appeared on the screen back in the 90s, people went gaga over Voorhies! The extraordinary performance won her two Young Artist Awards, though she had been nominated six times. She continued to rule Holywood with her powerful act in TV shows like ‘In the House’ and ‘The Bold and The Beautiful.’\n\nHowever, much to the disappointment of her fans, Voorhies stopped being in front of the camera too soon. Still, she had not vanished entirely from the news, as fans saw her writing when she authored three books, \"Trek of the Cheshire,\" \"A True Light,\" and \"Reciprocity.\"\n\nKate Moss\n\nWhat is the name that comes to mind when you think of fashion in the 90s? Moss, of course. She was the desired fantasy. With her unconventional looks and stick-thin body, she rose to fame at the young age of fourteen, becoming a muse for many designers. Since she had a size zero figure, she had to face strong competition from many curvy models, who were in vogue back then.\n\nThanks to her indomitable nature, Moss continued to strive and land modeling gigs, rising above all the famous models of her time. Announced as one of TIME’s 100 most influential people, Moss now has her own clothing and perfume line. Do you know how much this woman is worth? Hold your breath; Moss is one of the most sought-after British models, with an estimated net worth of a whopping $70 million!\n\nAmy Jo Johnson\n\nDidn't you just love the pink one in the ‘Mighty Morphin Power Rangers’? Do you want to know who was behind the pink mask? Here’s Johnson for you. The world mostly knows her for playing the role of Kimberley in this famous superhero series that continued to be everyone’s favorite from 1993-1999. Johnson’s Kimberley became so influential that she transformed the girly image of the color pink into one of courage and strength.\n\nFrom there onwards, she went on to bag the lead roles in television shows like ‘Flashpoint’ and ‘The Division.’ Back in 2001, Johnson released her first album and even sat on the director’s chair for ‘Lines’ in 2014 and ‘The Space Between,’ in 2017!\n\nBrandy Norwood\n\nThe world considered Brandy to be a full package of entertainment as she sang, composed songs, and acted. Now, that is some incredible talent! In 1994, her album, ‘Brandy,’ climbed up the Billboard charts so fast that it became platinum in no time! People were mesmerized by her portrayal of 'Roxie' on the Broadway production of 'Chicago.'\n\nBrandy’s passion for acting got her the role of ‘Moesha’ in 1996, and this was to be her last role on TV. Brandy continued to amp up the heat on screen with noteworthy roles in ‘90210’, ‘Zoe Ever After,’ and ‘The Game.'\n\nFairuza Balk\n\nThe world saw an innocent girl in Disney’s ‘Return to Oz’ in the 80s, but Balk rose to fame in the 90s after shedding off her mild and timid image. In 1992, she moved to Hollywood and decided to complete her studies via correspondence. She got a number of awards and accolades for the portrayal of grungy and gothic roles in ‘The Craft,’ ‘Gas Food Lodging,’ and ‘American History X.’\n\nSadly, the actress has been out of the spotlight for a long time. However, there is one ray of hope for her fans! They will find her name in the voice credits of ‘Family Guy’ and ‘The Justice League.’\n\nAlyssa Milano\n\nIf you are familiar with ‘Who’s The Boss?’, you would obviously remember Milano as the adorable and beloved daughter of Tony Danza. She also starred alongside the \"Governator\" himself, Arnold Schwarzenegger,\" in the action movie \"Commando.\" You wanna know how she managed to get the world’s attention?\n\nBy trotting into the limelight with ‘Charmed,’ a TV show revolving around three sisters with magical powers. The current generation witnesses Milano as a producer of her own comic book series called \"Hacktivist.\" Her life changed in 2008 after she got married to David Bugliari. The couple has two children together.\n\nTracey Gold\n\nThe world remembers Gold for the portrayal of Carol Seaver in ‘Growing Pains from 1985-1992. However, she did not have a smooth career in the film industry. Many actors and actresses stood by her during her struggle period with anorexia, but the paparazzi were heavily critical of it.\n\nThere was one role that helped her overcome her depression. Gold went through a catharsis while playing the role of Nancy Walsh in ‘For the Love of Nancy’ in 1994. This film, the first of many, dealt with the actual hardships one has to go through while battling anorexia. Like a boss, she silenced everyone who looked down on her!\n\nLiv Tyler\n\nA classic example of being born with a silver spoon, Liv is the daughter of the famous Steve Tyler and Bebe Buell! People noted her in small but significant roles in ‘That Thing You Do’ and ‘Empire Records’ in the early 90s. Later on, Tyler moved on to shine in bigger budget movies like ‘The Lord of the Rings trilogy and ‘Armageddon,’ and her career has not had a setback since then! In 2017, she played a role in the TV series ‘The Leftovers.’\n\nShe defied the age-old notion of an actress’s career coming to an end after having a family. Her career has continued to shine even after having a family, and she has landed roles in ‘The Strangers,’ ‘Jersey Girl,’ and ‘The Ledge.'\n\nKaryn Parsons\n\nKaryn Parsons got instant fame on an international level when she got the chance to play Hilary Banks in the famous sitcom ‘The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,’ which aired on NBC. While she has never quit acting altogether, after her time as Hilary ended, her roles were few and far between.\n\nIn fact, it kind of felt like she fell off the face of the Earth after she left the Will Smith show. Some of the more notable post-Fresh-Prince roles are Margot in 'Lush Life' and Toni in 'The Job.' To add to her credit, her name is also associated with being the creator of the animated series 'Sweet Blackberry.'\n\nFiona Apple\n\nApple stepped into the limelight by being a song composer at the age of — guess — seventeen! Her first album, ‘Tidal,’ came out two years after she had composed it and shot her to stardom instantly. Her voice has such an awesome texture that she was awarded the prestigious Grammy for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for her track, ‘Criminal.’\n\n‘When the Prawn…’ is Apple’s second album and the moment it was released in 1999, experts marked it as certified platinum!

Starting her career with CW’s ‘7th Heaven’, she impressed everyone with the portrayal of a well-behaved daughter of a Protestant minister.\n\nBut what gave her maximum fame? Biel wowed the world with her performances in ‘The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,’ ‘The Illusionist,’ and ‘The Rules of Attraction.' From marrying the sensational heartthrob Justin Timberlake to becoming a doting mom, her life has not been shabby at all!\n\nShannen Doherty\n\nShannen was a bright star of the 90s, so much so that it was the busiest time for her! By playing the super dramatic Brenda on ‘Beverly Hills 90210’, she strongly paved her way into Hollywood. Though she was going through a dry patch after this show, Doherty soon impressed everyone as Prue Halliwell in ‘Charmed.’\n\nThe reprised version of ‘90210’ saw her as Brenda, and she went on to compete in ‘Dancing With the Stars.’ Unfortunately, she was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease in 1999 and breast cancer in 2015. She soldiered on as an actress, producer, and activist until her 2024 passing.\n\nJennifer Aniston\n\nOne of the most famous and popular actresses in the world, Aniston is a known face to almost every person from every corner of the earth! There is not a single 90s person who has not seen the famous sitcom ‘Friends’ and not fallen in love with Rachel Green! The character of Rachel Green was a big break for Aniston, more so because the show successfully ran for ten long years and was loved by everyone. She received awards like a Golden Globe and an Emmy for this role.\n\nCritics were all praise for her dramatic turn in ‘Cake.’ Aniston was the envy of many girls because of her relationship with the sensation of the generation, Brad Pitt! They got married in 2000, but their marriage did not have a happy ending. Later, she got married to Justin Theroux in 2015, only to divorce him two years later.\n\nMädchen Amick\n\nAmick rose to fame after her performance as waitress Shelly Johnson in ‘Twin Peaks’ and then continued her career with teen dramas like ‘Gossip Girl’ and ‘Dawson’s Creek.’ Later on, she played Alice Cooper in ‘Riverdale’ and decided to appear in ‘Twin Peaks’ again for its 2017 return.\n\nShe spends her life between Los Angeles and Nevada.

Amick has already entered her 50s, and she is still one of the industry's most interesting, beautiful women.\n\nNeve Campbell\n\nNeve Campbell is mostly known to her fans for her role as the iconic character Sydney Prescott in the series of ‘Scream’ films. Playing the role of Julia Salinger, she trotted into the hearts of many with the teen drama ‘Party of Five.’ Much to the dismay of her fans, Campbell left her career at the peak and moved to London in 2016.\n\nThe next big thing came her way when she rocked her guest appearance in the famous TV series ‘House of Cards,’ surprising the audience considerably. Campbell also made an impact while acting alongside The Rock in ‘Skyscraper.’ Campbell reprised her role as Sydney in the reboot \"Scream\" movie.\n\nGabrielle Union\n\nUnion's name surfaced in the early 2000s.

Gabrielle is best known for her 20o1 role in 'The Brtheres\"; however, the list of her appearances goes on and on. She was raised in Nebraska by hard-working parents, and it is clear that all she was given and taught paid off.\n\nLarisa Oleynik\n\nNickelodeon star Larisa Oleynik captured kids’ imaginations as a girl named Alex with superpowers on 'The Secret World of Alex Mack' from 1994 to 1998. While her acting career was gaining her fame and fortune, Larisa wanted to know how it would be to be a regular teen in a regular high school. She left the show after four seasons to give high school a chance, got bored, and went back to acting.\n\nNow, Oleynik is now all grown up. She graduated from Sarah Lawrence, landed a role on 'Mad Men' and starred in TV shows such as 'The Healing Powers of Dude,' and ' Trinkets.'\n\nMeagan Good\n\nMeagan Good started acting at four years old. Born in 1981, she says she grew up with lots of self-confidence despite being nerdy and petite. Getting into television, she appeared on 'Doogie Howser M.D.' and found further success in 'Cousin Skeeter,' which ran from 1998 to 2001. As a child actress, she landed many roles, but her career really took off as an adult.\n\nShe grew up and hit sex symbol status, playing leading lady roles in 'Biker Boyz' and 'Deliver Us from Eva.' She has also been featured in hip-hop music videos by 50 Cent and Will Smith, among others.\n\nMichelle Trachtenberg\n\nBorn in 1985, Michelle Trachtenberg had her debut with a small part in 'Clarissa Explains It All.' Soon, she won the role of Nona Mecklenberg in 'The Adventures of Pete & Pete,' which ran until 1996, rocketing her to fame at the tender age of nine. Next, she starred as the titular character in 'Harriet the Spy.'\n\nMost of Trachtenberg's first roles were on Nickelodeon until she moved on up to adult showbiz with roles in 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' and 'Gossip Girl.' While she's had high-profile relationships, none of them stuck, and she seems to have taken a break from acting, as the last time she was seen on screen was in 2018.\n\nChristine Taylor\n\nIf you've seen anything on a screen in the 90s, odds are, Christine Taylor was on it. It all started when she played a lifeguard in the 1989 comedy series 'Hey Dude Playing.' As a child actress, she played Marcia in 'The Brady Bunch Movie,' among other roles.\n\nNext, Christine Taylor was on 'Seinfeld' and 'Friends,' which led to a starring role in the TV show 'Party Girl,' stamping her name on the decade. Taylor married comedian and actor Ben Stiller. The stars acted together in films such as 'Arrested Development' and 'Zoolander' before breaking up in 2017.\n\nElisha Cuthbert\n\nIf you’re a 90s kid, you must remember Elisha Cuthbert from 'Are You Afraid of the Dark?', the ghost story show that featured many up-and-coming stars. She was 14 years old at the time, but her career was already blossoming. Her debut film was in 1997's 'Dancing on the Moon.'\n\nWhen the 2000s came in, Elisha found international recognition with her role as Kim Bauer in the series '24' alongside Keifer Sutherland. She was later adored as Danielle in 'The Girl Next Door.' She married star hockey player Dion Phaneuf in 2013. Her career has slowed down a little but has never really stopped, with some exciting projects waiting in her future.\n\nLisa Foiles\n\nLisa Foiles grew up as a kid watching the original 'All That' smash hit. Imagine her excitement when she was cast for the program in 1994! The 'All That's cast became her family, especially since she was homeschooled and missed out on being a high school teenager. She made the big time with 'Malcolm in the Middle' and was well on her way to becoming an actress in the grown-up world of showbiz.\n\nNow, Lisa is an actress, video game journalist, model, and YouTuber. She hooked up with GameSpot and began hosting gaming events. Her work in the gaming industry has made her a frequent face at L.A. Comic-Con. She is married to producer Shawn Cloninger. The two have a daughter and a son, and they reside in Las Vegas.\n\nJessica Alba\n\nJessica Alba's 90s were incredibly fruitful with parts on both 'The Secret World of Alex Mack' and 'Flipper.' The shows got her foot in the door for some serious Hollywood action in 'Dark Angel' as Max. Her depiction of modern female empowerment was loved by all. She also appeared in 'Beverly Hills 90210', 'Never Been Kissed' and other hits such as 'Fantastic Four' and 'Rise of the Silver Surfer.'\n\nNow she’s a family girl with her husband and children and runs The Honest Company, selling a toxin-free lifestyle.

She went on to appear in several Nickelodeon productions and TV shows. Today, Shannon has transitioned to grownup television with parts in the FOX sitcom 'Raising Hope' and HBO’s sci-fi thriller 'Westworld.'\n\nShe has also developed a great friendship with singer Katy Perry, and the two made cameos in each other's productions.

The list of movies and shows she has participated in over the years goes on and on, and hse hasn't said her last word yet.\n\nAlanis Morissette\n\nNow known for her musical career, Morissette first got into show business as a child actor. It started with a part on the kids' show 'You Can’t Do That On Television' but soon transitioned into music, wrapping her talent all around 90s mainstream radio. In 1995, her album 'Jagged Little Pill' went platinum twelve times over. Hits like “Hand in My Pocket” and “Ironic” are still being played internationally.\n\nHer music career is far from over, and she's constantly working on new materials. In 2021, a documentary covering her life was released, and viewers ( including us) discovered rare facts about her life. Overnight, she gained popularity all over again, this time even more impressive than before.\n\nLindsay Sloane\n\nIf you've ever looked at Lindsay Sloane's face and tried to remember why it looked familiar, it's because she's been EVERYWHERE in the 90s. Those who watched 'Sabrina the Teenage Witch' would know her as Valerie Birkhead, Sabrina's friend from 1997 until 1999.\n\nSloane's acting career, however, started way before that as a child actor who signed with an agent at eight years old. That would explain how she's had a cameo in nearly every successful TV show in the past three decades. After her time as Valerie was done, Sloane got cast as another pop-culture staple as Big Red in 'Bring It On.' She was most recently seen playing the character of Billie in 'Endings, Beginnings,' alongside Shailene Woodley and Sebastian Stan.\n\nRaven-Symoné\n\nRaven-Symoné first got her big break as Olivia Kendall in \"The Cosby Show\" during the early 90s.

Chlumsky took a hiatus from her film career in 1999 to pursue a B.A. in International Studies from the University of Chicago.\n\nShe married sweetheart Shaun So in 2008 and went on to have two beautiful daughters.

Lawson has been open about her private life and has revealed her partners to the world.\n\nAlisa Reyes\n\nYou might remember 90’s hottie Alisa Reyes from Nickelodeon’s \"All That.\" In fact, Reyes is probably one of the only things people remember from that series. She was born in NY and took her first footsteps in her career in the performing art school in the city.\n\nShe went on to voice a character on Disney’s \"The Proud Family\" and did cameos on several TV shows and films. On a completely different note, Reyes also had a gig working as a radio DJ for Playboy on Sirius XM radio. Nowadays, she lives in NYC with her husband and child. In 2021, Alisa began writing and producing a new show alongside many other projects.\n\nReagan Gomez-Preston\n\nAmerican actress Regan Gomez Preston was born in 1980 in Michigan; however, later on in life, they moved to Philadelphia, where she began her acting career. She started her career with the 1990 popular sitcom \"The Parent ‘Hood,\" in which she played Zaria Peterson.\n\nShe went on to voice Roberta Tubbs, a character from the animated series \"The Cleveland Show,\" until 2013.

But it wasn’t until 1996’s cult horror film \"Scream\" that Drew Barrymore became a 90’s star. Barrymore went on to have an extremely successful acting career, starring in movies like \"Charlie’s Angels,\" \"Never Been Kissed,\" \"The Wedding Singer,\" \"Donnie Darko,\" and dozens more.\n\nNowadays, Barrymore hosts her own show, \"The Drew Barrymore Show,\" in which she interviews different celebrities. She also has a successful American beauty company named Flower, which sells cruelty-free cosmetics. As for her love life, she has been in a few complicated relationships during her life. In 2021, she revealed that after six years, she has finally started to date someone...\n\nAlicia Silverstone\n\nWho wasn’t obsessed with Valley Girl Cher when \"Clueless\" came out in 1995? Her attitude and her outfits were just awesome, as were her girlfriends Tai and Dionne. But it seems this iconic film was Alicia Silverstone’s big break and pretty much the only one. She went on to act in several B-movies, like \"The Crush\" and \"Blast from the Past,\" but nothing quite memorable.\n\nSilverstone married musician Christopher Jarecki in 2005, and they had a son, Bear Blu. Currently, you’re more likely to find Silverstone supporting animal rights and posting family pictures on Instagram than acting in a movie.\n\nReese Witherspoon\n\nHere’s a 90s girl that went on to have a very successful career, with two Golden Globe awards, a BAFTA, an Emmy, and an Oscar. Reese Witherspoon starred in some of the 90s' most famous films, including \"Man on the Moon,\" \"Cruel Intentions,\" \"Election,\" and more.\n\nWitherspoon also conquered the 2000s, landing leading roles in hits such as the \"Legally Blonde\" film franchise, \"Walk the Line,\" \"Wild,\" and famous TV series like \"Big Little Lies\" and \"The Morning Show.\" She split from Ryan Phillipe in 2007 and is now happily married to producer Jim Toth. Reese has three beautiful kids.\n\nElizabeth Hurley\n\nBefore her role as a stunning devil in the movie, \"Bedazzled\" alongside Brendan Fraser, English actress Elizabeth Hurley appeared in the famous 90’s film \"Four Weddings and a Funeral.\" Hurley was seared into everyone’s mind after wearing a striking Versace dress while accompanying then-boyfriend Hugh Grant to the movie's premiere.\n\nShe went on to star in two \"Austin Powers\" films and then in 2015’s E! series, \"The Royals.\" Nowadays, Hurley designs her own line of bathing suits, named Elizabeth Hurley Beach, and the woman still looks so hot that she is a model with her own bikinis!\n\nMary-Kate and Ashley Olsen\n\nEverybody remembers the Olsen sisters from their days as the super cute Michelle (yes, they played the same character) in \"Full House.\" This role in the series catapulted the sisters to fame, landing them consecutive roles in several TV movies (e.g., \"It Takes Two,\" \"Passport to Paris,\" \"Switching Goals,\" \"New York Minute,\" etc.).\n\nAfter years of amassing a small fortune from all their B-list movie roles, the Olsen twins decided to go into fashion. They started their own chic, luxury fashion label called The Row, and just like their acting career, it seems to be going swimmingly. To this day, they are considered one of the most famous twins in the industry; however, they have been relatively quiet in the past few years.\n\nJulia Roberts\n\nJulia Roberts stole our hearts as Vivian in the 90s classic, \"Pretty Woman.\" Apart from being obsessed with every single one of her outfits in the movies, her attitude was sassy and adorable. Roberts went on to star in several semi-famous movies of the 90s, such as \"My Best Friend’s Wedding,\" \"The Pelican Brief,\" \"Runaway Bride,\" and the unforgettable \"Notting Hill.\"\n\nThis 90s hottie went on to have a great acting career, landing role after role in Hollywood films. Her repertoire includes \"Erin Brockovich,\" \"Ocean’s Eleven,\" \"Eat Pray Love,\" \"Stepmom,\" \"Mona Lisa Smile,\" and many others. She is considered one of Hollywood's most beautiful women and, with no doubt, one of the most talented ones too.\n\nJodie Sweetin\n\nWhile the name might not ring a bell at first, Jodie Sweetin is the actress who played the lovable Stephanie Tanner in \"Full House.\" After that major success in the '90s, Sweetin fizzled out until 2008, when she appeared on the TV show \"Good Morning America,\" revealing her struggles with addiction. She even released a book about her experiences called \"Unsweetened.\"\n\nMost recently, the actress has appeared on \"Dancing with the Stars\" and \"Fuller House,\" a sequel to the famous 90s TV show. Sweetin has been married no less than four times. In 2002, she married her first husband, Shaun Holguin; in 2007, she wed Cody Herpin; in 2012, it was Morty Coyle; and in 2022, she married Mescal Wasilewski, who she has been with since.\n\nMarla Sokoloff\n\nBack in the 90s, child actress Marla Sokoloff played the ‘mean girl’ on several TV shows. She played Gia, Stephanie Tanner’s friend on \"Full House,\" who was always coming up with sneaky plans. Sokoloff also played Jody Lynch in \"Party of Five\" and went on to land roles in several movies, including \"The Baby-Sitter’s Club,\" \"Sugar & Spice,\" and \"Dude, Where’s My Car?\" Most recently, Sokoloff reprised her role in the \"Full House\" sequel, \"Fuller House.\"\n\nIn 2004, Marla began dating Alec Puro, and in 2009, the couple eventually tied the knot. They have three daughters together and are going strong until this day.\n\nBeverley Mitchell\n\nBeverley Mitchell played Lucy on the hit 90s sitcom \"7th Heaven,\" a role that she held for ten years. A year after the show came to an end, Mitchell married long-time boyfriend, Michael Cameron, with co-stars Mackenzie Rosman and Jessica Biel as her bridesmaids.\n\nAlso in 2008, Mitchell landed a starring role on another famous sitcom, \"The Secret Life of the American Teenager,\" which lasted until 2013. Some of her most recent TV appearances have been on the documentary series \"Hollywood Darlings,\" in which she stars as herself. Mitchell may not be one of the biggest names in the industry; however, she is definitely one of the most influential ones out there.\n\nMackenzie Rosman\n\nMackenzie Rosman played little Ruthie Camden on \"7th Heaven,\" and as co-star Beverley Mitchell, went on to land a role on \"The Secret Life of the American Teenager.\" Apart from several B-list TV movies that weren’t very successful, Rosman pretty much faded out of the public eye.\n\nThe South Carolina native now lives a quiet life with her husband and child, which we’re sure is plenty comfortable if she knew how to take care of her \"7th Heaven\" paychecks. She chose not to procced with her acting career and take it to higher levels. We suppose the glam and glory are not suited for everyone.\n\nLisa Kudrow\n\nOh, how we miss Phoebe Buffay! Hands down the best character of the hit 90s TV series \"Friends.\" It’s not surprising that this was Kudrow’s big break, earning her six Emmy nominations and one win. Kudrow also starred in the 1997 cult classic, \"Romy and Michele’s High School Reunion.\" A year later, she and her husband, Michael Stern, welcomed a son.\n\nThroughout the 2000s, Kudrow landed roles in several popular movies, like \"Neighbors\" and \"Easy A.\" Most recently, she appeared in \"Booksmart\" and on the TV show \"Grace & Frankie.\" And, of course, the Friends reunion on HBO!\n\nGillian Anderson\n\nGillian Anderson made her big acting debut playing FBI Agent Dana Scully in one of history’s most famous TV shows, \"The X-Files.\" The hit series ran for nine seasons and then got rebooted for another two seasons 14 years later. Additionally, they made two successful \"X-Files\" films.\n\nWith her incredible talent, it’s no surprise that Anderson has gone on to star in very successful TV shows such as \"Sex Education,\" \"The Fall,\" and \"The Crown.\" Most recently, she stars in the \"American Gods\" TV series. Anderson also does a lot of charity work, specifically regarding women’s rights and feminism.\n\nLacey Chabert\n\nAlthough most people know her for her role as Gretchen Wieners, one of Regina’s minions in \"Mean Girls,\" Lacey Chabert got her acting start back in the 90s. Chabert played one of Erica Kane’s daughters in the famous soap opera, \"All My Children.\"\n\nThen she went on to star in \"Party of Five\" and did voiceovers for many popular movies and shows, including \"The Wild Thornberrys\" and \"The Lion King 2.\" Chabert has mostly done Hallmark movies, racking up fourteen so far. Nowadays, she lives with her husband David Nehdar, and has a beautiful daughter who was born in 2016.\n\nKeri Russell\n\nKeri Russell has been on quite a journey over the last couple of decades. While she had some minor roles in films such as \"Honey, I Blew Up the Kid\" and \"Married...with Children,\" her breakthrough came in 1998 when she landed the titular role in the hit series \"Felicity.\"\n\nIn more recent times, Russell co-starred with eventual husband Matthew Rhys in the series \"The Americans.\" And Russell has even been a big blockbuster star, appearing in movies such as \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" and \"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\" (The latter of which she reunited with JJ Abrams for).\n\nLinda Cardellini\n\nThere is no denying that Linda Cardellini has been the poster girl for the Apatow comedy era. She first burst onto the scene with her role in the popular, albeit short-lived series \"Freaks and Geeks,\" before landing a more serious role on the medical drama \"ER.\" She even played Velma in the popular live-action version of \"Scooby-Doo.\"\n\nIn the last decade, Cardellini has reached an entirely different audience, having appeared as the wife of Hawkeye in a variety of movies from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. She also made a splash with her role on the hit Netflix series \"Dead to Me,\" starring alongside Christina Applegate.\n\nCherie Johnson\n\nY'all remember \"Punky Brewster?\" Well if you do, then you'll definitely remember his best friend Cherie Johnson, who was played by an actress with the exact same name! Coincidence? We think not. Johnson also made a splash in the '90s with her role as Maxine Johnson in the sitcom \"Family Matters.\"\n\nFunnily enough, Johnson actually reprised her role for the revival series of \"Punky Brewster,\" which came out in 2021. Outside of acting, Johnson has two kids and works with many children's charities. Also, she is a massive sports fan, specifically following the Pittsburgh Steelers. She loves Paul Pierce!\n\nJosie Bissett\n\nOne of the most integral parts of the '90s series \"Melrose Place\" was undoubtedly the character of Jane Mancini. Josie Bissett was responsible for playing the character so well and having already appeared on shows such as \"Doogie Howser, M.D.,\" \"The Hogan Family\" and \"Secrets,\" it only made sense that she'd eventually get her big break.\n\nWe think it is safe to say though that Bissett has never completely managed the recreate the magic from her role on \"Melrose Place.\" In more recent times, she has appeared in a plethora of Hallmark TV movies. Outside of acting, she has been married twice, most recently tying the not with Thomas Doig in 2017. She has two kids.\n\nSoleil Moon Frye\n\nWe also need to give some love to the titular character of the popular NBC sitcom \"Punky Brewster.\" Soleil Moon Frye gave some real panache to the role, and was integral to making the show a hit with a younger audience. Throughout the '90s, Frye showed up in shows such as \"Saved By the Bell,\" \"The Wonder Years,\" and others.\n\nAt the turn of the century, she famously played the role of Roxie King in the sitcom \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch.\" And in the last few years, she has had plenty of voice roles, most notably in the animated series \"The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder.\"\n\nCourtney Thorne-Smith\n\nWhen you consider the fact that Courtney Thorne-Smith had prominent roles on shows such as \"Melrose Place\" and \"Ally McBeal,\" it is safe to say that she really was a real star of the '90s, as well as the early '00s. And she took that momentum well into the '00s with her role as Cheryl in the show \"According to Jim.\"\n\nTV fans will also remember her for her role as Lyndsey McElroy in the popular sitcom \"Two and a Half Men.\" Truth be told though, the roles have dried up a little, with her most recent acting performance coming in an episode of the sitcom \"Mom\" in 2020.\n\nLauryn Hill\n\nIt's impossible to talk about '90s music without mentioning the name Lauryn Hill. Breaking down so many barriers in the world of Hip-Hop and R&B, Hill was one-third of the popular rap group the Fugees, along with Wyclef Jean and Pras. Their album \"The Score\" sold many many records and even won the Grammy for Best Rap Album.\n\nAnd her solo career got off to an amazing start too, with her album \"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\" being both a critical and commercial success. Over the last few decades, Hill has focused less on her music career and more on her six kids, as well as a handful of legal issues.\n\nRose McGowan\n\nThere was a five-minute period when Rose McGowan was the quintessential action girl. Her roles in movies such as \"Death Proof\" and \"Planet Terror\" made her something of a household name. Before that though, McGowan got plenty of plaudits for her role as Paige Matthews in The WB supernatural series \"Charmed.\"\n\nTruth be told though, McGowan's time in a limelight faded with time. In place of her acting career, McGowan has become a vocal activist, especially in light of the #MeToo movement. She was the focal point of the four-part documentary series \"Citizen Rose.\" And she also laid all bare in her memoir \"Brave.\"\n\nRosie Perez\n\nAs the '80s came to an end and the '90s began, Rosie Perez seemed to be the name on everybody's lips. The talented actress burst onto the scene when she danced to \"Fight the Power\" in the classic Spike Lee joint \"Do the Right Thing.\" This was shortly followed by a key role in the hit comedy \"White Men Can't Jump.\"\n\nJust a year later, Perez was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance in the movie \"Fearless.\" While she fell off the radar a little as time went on, Perez ended up coming back to the limelight with roles in flicks such as \"Pineapple Express\" and \"Birds of Prey.\"\n\nJamie-Lynn Sigler\n\nThere is no denying that Jamie-Lynn Sigler's greatest claim to fame was for her role as Meadow Soprano in one of the greatest TV shows of all times, HBO's gangster drama \"The Sopranos.\" Her performance as Tony Soprano's daughter was one for the ages, and many thought that this would be just the beginning of a prolific career.\n\nWhile she has never managed to eclipse her role as Meadow, Sigler has continued to find work in acting over the years, appearing in shows such as \"Entourage,\" \"Guys with Kids,\" and \"Big Sky,\" among others. She has been married twice and has two kids.\n\nCalista Flockhart\n\nIf you never watched an episode of Ally McBeal, what have you been doing with your life? This comedy-drama series was the talk of the town during the end of the '90s and the beginning of the '00s, with Flockhart playing the titular Boston lawyer. The talented actress received rave reviews for her role, winning awards along the way.\n\nWhile she also had noteworthy roles in movies such as \"The Birdcage\" and \"A Midsummer Night's Dream,\" there is no denying that Flockhart's marriage to Harrison Ford is what has been keeping her most relevant up until the present day.\n\nSara Gilbert\n\nSara Gilbert clearly had an eventful first few decades of a career. The talented actress first made waves with her role as Darlene Conner in the hit ABC sitcom \"Roseanne,\" receiving her fair share of awards along the way. Eventually, Gilbert rose to prominence once again with her role as Leslie Winkle in the CBS sitcom \"The Big Bang Theory.\"\n\nAnd outside of her acting career, Gilbert also enjoyed success as one of the co-hosts of the popular talk show \"The View.\" So far, Gilbert has three kids and was married to Linda Perry up until 2019.\n\nFran Drescher\n\nBack in the '90s, Fran Drescher was tearing it up at Fran Fine in the hit sitcom \"The Nanny.\" Funnily enough, she actually co-created the show with her husband at the time, Peter Marc Jacobson. Many aren't actually aware that Drescher had a very small cameo in \"Saturday Night Fever\" back in the '70s.\n\nMore recently, Drescher is best recognized for her role as the national president of the SAG-AFTRA - otherwise known as the Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. She led the union during the 2023 actor's strike, which started after the writer's strike began.\n\nMadeline Zima\n\nWhile she might be on of the younger stars on this list, that is because Madeline Zima started her career back in the '90s when she was still very young. The talented young star first made a name for herself as Grace Sheffield in the CBS show \"The Nanny.\"\n\nAnd her fame didn't slow down in the '00s, as she also got roles on shows such as \"Californication\" and \"Heroes.\" Up until the present day, Zima has stayed very busy, appearing in everything from \"Twin Peaks\" and \"You\" to \"Perry Mason\" and \"Doom Patrol.\" Like we said, she's in everything!\n\nEve\n\nWho's that girl? It's Eve, of course! Known as the first lady of the Ruff Ryders, Eve was one of the \"baddest\" girls in all of Hip-Hop at the turn of the millennium. This talented rapper had a lot of big hits, including the likes of \"Gangsta Lovin'\" and the classic \"Let Me Blow Ya Mind,\" which featured Gwen Stefani, of all people.\n\nAlthough she didn't manage to build on that success, Eve did crossover into the acting world, showing up in movies such as \"XXX,\" \"Barbershop,\" and \"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,\" to name a few. In 2022, Eve and her husband Maximillion Cooper welcomed their first child into the world.\n\nMary-Louise Parker\n\nBack in the '90s, Mary-Louise Parker was in all kinds of good movies, including \"The Client,\" \"Boys on the Side,\" \"The Portrait of a Lady,\" and many more. But it was her lead role as Nancy Botwin in the Showtime series \"Weeds\" that really took her reputation to a whole new level.\n\nThat classic role took her fame to a whole new level, and Parker starred in other big movies over the decade or two, including \"Red,\" \"Howl,\" and \"Red Sparrow,\" among others. Parker actually had a son, William Atticus Parker, with fellow actor Billy Crudup. Her son is also an actor."
