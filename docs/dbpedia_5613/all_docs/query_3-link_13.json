        "text": "Julia Roberts doesn’t want to talk about turning 50. “That was last year, and I’m about to turn 51,” points out the actress, who celebrates her birthday on Sunday. “But honestly, I don’t know what freak-out we’re all supposed to have, turning 50. For myself, last year, I was quite proud and happy.”\n\nShe has plenty to celebrate. When we meet at the Toronto International Film Festival, her crimson power suit and black spectacles demand respect. Once known as Hollywood’s sweetheart, her break-out success in 1990’s Pretty Woman propelled her career as a romantic blockbuster mainstay, before she won an Oscar for Erin Brockovich in 2000.\n\nThis century, she has cut a lower profile, but she is about to star in two timely pieces – Peter Hedges’ upcoming drama about addiction, Ben is Back, and the psychological/military industrial thriller Homecoming, directed by Mr Robot creator Sam Esmail. Based on Micah Bloomberg and Eli Horowitz’s 2015 podcast featuring Catherine Keener, Oscar Isaac and David Schwimmer, Homecoming replaces the original cast with Roberts, Stephan James and Bobby Cannavale.\n\nRead more: The best TV shows in autumn 2018 – from House of Cards to David Attenborough’s Dynasties\n\nIt is “a great old-fashioned yarn set in this really modern conundrum of a morality play”, says Roberts.\n\n“I heard the podcast and, many months later, I got a call about getting together with Sam Esmail. We had a\n\nFaceTime meeting and I fell under the spell of his nerdy genius. I loved every minute we spent together, creatively and socially.”\n\nAs dowdy psychologist Heidi Bergman, Roberts strips away her usual glamour, although she refuses to see it that way. “I don’t think it plays against expectations. It’s about being truthful [to the character]. I don’t think people will say: she could have looked better, because that’s not my responsibility in that situation.” Her role in the story is ambiguous. “I’m not the bad guy. I don’t think? I like the idea of characters where you really don’t know what side they’re on,” she says.\n\nShe made her first major foray into TV with Ryan Murphy’s Aids drama The Normal Heart, in 2014, and lists her own current TV favourites as The Handmaid’s Tale and Big Little Lies.\n\nI point out that these are stories made by women. “But listen, they are not my rules,” she says. “We just do the best we can as individuals. On Homecoming, we had the most incredible, radical team of women on our crew.”\n\n‘This period is platform-agnostic. I don’t think performing differs according to how people are going to get a story brought to them. I mean, I grew up on canned laughter’\n\nRoberts famously became the first actress to break the $25m-per-film payday, for Mona Lisa Smile in 2003. She never expected the industry would take so long to catch up. “It’s an ongoing thing that we wish was more in the rear-view mirror.\n\nBut every day… today I know the World Surf League announced that they will have equal pay for their female surfers and male surfers. And Manchester United has a female team that started this year. I think there are places where people are really making efforts in the right direction. So if it’s a little bit of time, then we have to take it.”\n\nA former big-screen queen, she has come to terms with the changing world of TV consumption. “This period is sort of platform-agnostic. I don’t think performing differs according to how people are going to get a story brought to them. I mean, I grew up on canned laughter and a very different-looking television,” she says.\n\nFailing eyesight, she claims, prevents her from bingeing on television on her phone like her kids. “My own television is very big out of necessity, because I have bad eyes. But I don’t think of my career as small screen versus big screen.\n\nAlso, I don’t get to watch a lot of television, because by the time it’s adult television watching time, I am going to bed.”\n\n‘My own television is very big out of necessity, because I have bad eyes. But I don’t think of my career as small screen versus big screen’\n\nIn the past, Roberts has been prickly with the media as she attempted to reconcile her romcom queen public persona with more unsteady private romances. She ditched her fiancé, Kiefer Sutherland, at the altar in 1991 when she was 23. Then, two years later, she married country singer Lyle Lovett in a union which lasted two years. There were flings with fellow actors, including Liam Neeson, Ethan Hawke, Daniel Day-Lewis and Matthew Perry, before she married cinematographer Danny Moder in 2002 at a private ceremony on her sprawling ranch in Taos, New Mexico.\n\nIf Taos served as a respite from an intruding world, today she has come to terms with her celebrity, living with her family in a secluded Malibu enclave. She and Moder have worked together on various projects, including Secret in Their Eyes and Fireflies in the Garden.\n\nA reluctant celebrity, she made her Instagram debut in June. “It’s an interesting psychological test I’m putting myself through,” she says. “As the mother of teenagers, it’s an incredible exercise. I’m not terribly good at it. My kids told me early on, ‘Mom, you’re kind of blowing it a little bit – this is what you need to be doing.’ I think I’ve had some good counsel.”\n\nShe is on safer ground with football, specifically Manchester United. “That’s who we cheer for in our house. My oldest son got into that and it’s always been his team,” she says of Finn, 13, whose dreams came true when he was\n\nallowed to kick around the ball post-game at Old Trafford with his twin sister, Hazel, and younger brother Henry, 11.\n\nAsked whether she envisages still working when she reaches the same age – 68 – as Sissy Spacek, who portrays her mother in Homecoming, she grimaces. “Let’s get the crystal ball and find out.”\n\n‘I think that’s made up, that at a certain age, the bell is going to ring and you are done. I don’t think anybody buys into that’\n\nShe disagrees with the concept of women ageing out of their careers earlier than their male peers. “I think that’s made up, that at a certain age, the bell is going to ring and you are done. I don’t think anybody buys into that.\n\n“I don’t think I am special. I’ve always been fortunate that I have found the work I am looking for. I mean, 30 years is a long time – and I am grateful and satisfied.”"
