        "text": "With Pretty Woman, Notting Hill, and My Best Friend’s Wedding, Julia Roberts has starred in some of the best romantic comedies of all time. But as fate would have it, she could have added another to her impressive roster: 1998’s You’ve Got Mail.\n\nWhile promoting her latest film, the psychological thriller Leave the World Behind, on Thursday’s episode of Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, Roberts was asked to reflect on any roles she regretted turning down. Instead, the Oscar winner shifted the question to share two movies she passed on that “maybe wouldn’t have been as great and wonderful” with her in them.\n\nOne was 1992’s The Last of the Mohicans, starring Daniel Day-Lewis. The other? You’ve Got Mail, in which she would have acted opposite Tom Hanks and played Meg Ryan’s part as hopelessly romantic bookshop owner Kathleen Kelly. Instead of Roberts, who went on to star with Hanks in 2007’s Charlie Wilson’s War and 2011’s Larry Crowne, Ryan reunited with her Sleepless in Seattle love interest. That same year, Roberts opted to coheadline the domestic tearjerker Stepmom alongside Susan Sarandon.\n\nNearly a decade prior, it was Ryan who was originally cast as Shelby in 1989’s Steel Magnolias, a part based on screenwriter and playwright Robert Harling’s sister, Susan. “The day after we cast her, she came to us in tears and said, ‘I’m sorry, but I just got offered this film, and I’ll be a leading lady with Billy Crystal…’” Harling recalled last year. “So you know we said, ‘Of course, go make When Harry Met Sally.’”\n\nIt was Sally Field, who plays Shelby’s mother, M’Lynn, in the film, who suggested producers meet with Roberts, according to Harling. “Sally said, ‘You know, there’s this girl and she’s been off making some movie about a pizza. She’s Eric Roberts’s sister,’” he told Southern Living, referencing her breakout role in 1988’s Mystic Pizza. “We brought her in, and she was Julia Roberts, so she was magic. She just walked into the room and lit it up, and I thought, That’s my sister.”\n\nOn WWHL, Roberts also mentioned the Steel Magnolias switch, which helped earn her the first of four Academy Award nominations. She noted that she also nearly missed out on her earliest project with the late filmmaker Mike Nichols. “Cate Blanchett was supposed to be in Closer, but she got pregnant, and so then I got that part,” Roberts said of the 2004 romantic thriller costarring Natalie Portman, Jude Law, and Clive Owen. “So I’ve lucked into some good stuff.”\n\nMovies\n\nRosemary’s Baby Prequel Apartment 7A Aims to Raise Hell: A First Look\n\nJulia Garner and Dianne Wiest star in this follow-up to the 1968 thriller, centering a side character’s nightmarish untold story.\n\nMovies\n\nThe 25 Best Movies on Netflix to Stream Right Now\n\nFrom comedy classics to recent Oscar winners, these are the titles you don’t want to miss.\n\nHollywood\n\nSaturday Night First Look: How the SNL Movie Captures 1975’s Wild Opening Night\n\nDirector Jason Reitman calls it a “thriller-comedy” that counts down to the very first “Live from New York…”\n\nHollywood\n\nInside Kamala Harris’s Loyal Circle of Hollywood Friends\n\n“I used to say, ‘I wish voters saw the Kamala we know.’ And I feel like in the last 24 hours, more people are.”\n\nTelevision\n\nKim Cattrall Shuts Down Rumors She's Returning to Sex and the City Revival Series\n\nIn a post on X, Cattrall maintained that Samantha Jones will not be returning for season three of And Just Like That.\n\nAward Season\n\nJoan Chen Has Always Been a Movie Star. Hollywood Is Finally Catching Up\n\nThe veteran actor has worked with Bernardo Bertolucci, David Lynch, and Ang Lee, and maintained rich careers in both China and the US. With the new film Dìdi, Oscar buzz is trailing her for the first time. What took so long?\n\nTelevision\n\nThe Morning Show Season 4: Everything We Know\n\nTwo Oscar winners are joining the already starry cast for season four, which must answer a lot of major questions: “Everybody keeps asking me if Bradley’s in jail,” Reese Witherspoon says.\n\nMovies\n\nReintroducing Humphrey Bogart: The Untold Stories of a Hollywood Icon’s Volatile Private Life\n\nThe Casablanca star’s career was shaped by his relationships with women, from his distant mother to the love of his life, Lauren Bacall. Those stories come to the forefront in a new documentary, Bogart: Life Comes in Flashes.\n\nMovies\n\nIt Ends With Us: The 5 Biggest Changes From Book to Movie\n\nThe big-screen version of Colleen Hoover’s best-selling novel ages up the characters and scraps a whole Ellen DeGeneres subplot.\n\nMovies\n\nNicole Kidman Says Stanley Kubrick “Was Mining” Her Marriage to Tom Cruise for Eyes Wide Shut\n\nIn an interview with the LA Times, Kidman reveals that Kubrick asked “a lot of questions” over the two years she worked on his final film with her ex-husband: “There were ideas he was interested in.”"
