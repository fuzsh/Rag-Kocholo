Though Davis had only one scene in the film, she remained a highlight of the film with noted film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times specifically praising her performance writing, \"It lasts about 10 minutes, but it is the emotional heart and soul of Doubt, and if Viola Davis isn't nominated by the Academy, an injustice will have been done.\" Ebert would further go on to write, \"She goes face to face with the pre-eminent film actress of this generation, and it is a confrontation of two equals that generates terrifying power.\"[41][42] She was nominated for several awards for her performance, including a Screen Actors Guild Award, a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.[43]\n\nOn June 30, 2009, Davis was inducted into the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[44]\n\nIn 2010, Davis returned to Broadway in her third August Wilson play, this time a revival of Fences as Rose Maxson, acting alongside Denzel Washington. Her performance received raves from critics in particular theatre critic Ben Brantley of The New York Times who described Davis' performance as \"extraordinary\", adding \"Ms. Davis, who won a Tony for her performance in Wilson's King Hedley II, may well pick up another for her work here.
