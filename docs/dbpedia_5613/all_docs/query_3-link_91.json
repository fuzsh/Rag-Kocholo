        "text": "I’m rushing to complete this piece before TNT airs Jane Fonda’s American Film Institute Life Achievement Award celebration sometime this month; the tribute was taped less than a week ago. I’ll probably skip the TV program. Oh, I’ve watched these annual shindigs from time to time going all the way back to the 70s when Bette Davis, James Cagney, Orson Welles, and Alfred Hitchcock were honored, but for some reason the last several tributes have seemed extremely edited, to force the fun factor, and that bothers me. Besides, I don’t need the AFI, necessarily, to remind me how much I love the films of Jane Fonda or to help me remember my favorites.\n\nWhen I was a wee thing, I thought Jane Fonda too gorgeous for words. Truthfully, if I saw any of her movies at that time, it would have likely been Barefoot in the Park (1967), co-starring the equally and improbably gorgeous Robert Redford; the two later reteamed for 1979’s smash The Electric Horseman (directed by Sydney Pollack), but I digress. No, mostly I recall seeing pictures of Fonda in my mother’s movie magazines, Modern Screen, Photoplay, etc. Based on what I’d heard, I imagined that she ran around naked in most of her films, mostly Barbarella. Then, she cut her hair, apparently dyed it black, and protested the war–to put it mildly. I didn’t know what to think about all that, but I was still a child, only 11 or 12. I didn’t understand the full implications of her actions, but I also didn’t want my older brother to be drafted, yet I also wanted America “to win,” so I was more confused than anything else. Fonda won the Oscar for Klute during that period, coincidentally my first time to make it through the Academy Awards from start to finish. I outlasted everyone else in the house. The French Connection won Best Picture, btw. Still, I somehow knew that Fonda played a prostitute in Klute, thereby further fostering the notion that she probably appeared nude in most of her films.\n\nThis column is not for Fonda haters. Politically, she and I probably have a lot in common. but that’s not to say that I agree with, or follow, her every move. It’s easy to write her off as a bit of a dilettante, given that she was raised second generation Hollywood and has had a tendency to attach herself to powerful charismatic men; however, she’s also a damned fine actress, and while actresses of her caliber are still doing their gosh-darnedest to create meaningful work, I think almost none of today’s top tier stars use their star power in quite the same way that Fonda did at her peak in the late 1970s and early-to-mid 1980s. Not only is she a two-time Academy Award winner for Best Actress, with five additional acting nominations, she also made her mark as an astute movie producer whose credits include such smash hits as Nine to Five and On Golden Pond though to clarify, she almost never received screen credit on the films she developed with ally and business partner Bruce Gilbert through IPC films–though we’ll get to that. Right now, these are my reminisces of a lifetime of movies starring the one and only Jane Fonda.\n\nCat Ballou (1965): Fonda plays the title character in the mid 1960s western romp, but Lee Marvin won all the accolades, including the Oscar for Best Actor, in dual roles. Legend has it that Ann-Margret was actually the first choice for the role of the would-be school marm turned would-be outlaw. The story goes that Margret’s agent turned down the offer without notifying his client first [*]. Yikes! Fonda was on her way.\n\nBarbarella (1968): Fonda and her then husband, French film director Roger Vadim, teamed up for this far-flung futuristic sex farce based on a comic strip. Though reportedly more scandalous than profitable in its time, it has nonetheless influenced a host of filmmakers, as well as 1980s pop-superstars Duran Duran, and once upon a time no less than Drew Barrymore threatened to star in a remake. Thank god that never happened though Britney Spears clearly jumped at the chance in her video for “Oops! I Did It Again.” I caught up with Barbarella years and years ago at the old Granada theatre, and it had not aged well. Whatever the film’s weaknesses, Fonda is not one of them. She’s the very definition of eye-candy, and the opening credits are a hoot.\n\nThey Shoot Horses, Don’t They? (1969): A year after Barbarella, Fonda and Vadim were on the skids, and the spaced-out sex kitten reinvented herself as a serious actress of the highest order in Sydney Pollack’s searing look at the desperate participants in a grueling Depression-era dance marathon. Fonda earned her first Oscar nomination, losing–not entirely undeservedly–to the great Maggie Smith in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie. Affable long-time character actor Gig Young took the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his audacious turn as the crass, cruel emcee. The Academy also nominated supporting actress Susannah York and director Pollack. Indeed, They Shoot Horses Don’t They, besides having one of the most iconic movie titles of all time, also holds the distinction of being nominated for more Oscars, nine, without also competing for Best Picture. It was, in fact, the second most nominated film during the 1969/70 race (right behind Anne of the Thousand Days) with the top award going to Midnight Cowboy. The cast also includes Michael Sarrazin, Bonnie Bedelia, Red Buttons, and Al Lewis. I saw this unrelentingly harsh movie the first time it aired on network television and have never cared to revisit it since then even with that stellar cast.\n\nKlute (1971): Fonda took home the 1971 Best Actress Oscar for her, for the times, surprisingly frank portrayal of call-girl Bree Daniels in this Alan J. Pakula thriller starring Donald Sutherland as the title character, a detective investigating the disappearance of a male executive with possible ties to Fonda’s character. The critics and the Academy went bonkers for Fonda in this film, especially as she worked hard to make her character a complex, fully dimensional human being rather than the stereotypical hooker with a heart of gold depicted in many films, but after a number of viewings through the decades, I remain a tad unconvinced that the performance is all that though I have misgivings about the film in general. I understand that her matter-of-fact take had just enough of an edge to make an impact. I still prefer Julie Christie (McCabe and Mrs. Miller), which I’ve also seen several times, or Vanessa Redgrave (Mary Queen of Scots); that is, I prefer those two of the nominated performances, but, of course, Ruth Gordon as Maude in Hal Ashby’s Harold and Maude is nearest and dearest to my heart and a performance likely much more beloved by legions of movie aficionados in the decades since than any of the actual nominees; plus, despite its reputation as a stinker that rose to cult status in the years following its initial release, both Gordon and co-star Bud Cort snagged Golden Globe nods during that season’s awards race. Not bad. But I digress.\n\nJulia (1977): The years immediately following Klute were lean for Fonda as her activism alienated her from both mainstream audiences and the Hollywood corporate power structure tthough she jumped at the chance to work with George Cukor on the U.S. – Russia ill-fated remake of The Bluebird. In the spring of 1977 she caught a break when the dark comedy Fun with Dick and Jane, co-starring George Segal along with Ed McMahon, turned into a surprise hit. In the fall, her comeback at 39-going-on-40 was seemingly complete as she commanded the screen as “scrappy” playwright Lillian Hellman in Julia, based on a remembrance, long disputed, of Hellman’s to-the-manor-born childhood friend who later used her inheritance as a member of the European resistance. In this tantalizing puzzle of a tale, taken from the intriguingly entitled memoir Pentimento, Hellman, a Jewish playwright making her mark with The Children’s Hour while duking it out with mentor and sometime lover Dashiell Hammett, embarks on a tense journey to smuggle money into Berlin and reunite with her long cherished friend. The movie opened in the fall of 1977 though I didn’t catch up with it until weeks, if not days, prior to the 1977/78 Oscars when it had shifted its run from the old GCC NorthPark to the historic Highland Park Village, and I have to say it was the most important moviegoing event of my life up to that point–and, keep in mind, I’d seen Star Wars the first week it opened in May of ’77. Certainly, the European flourishes and period decor of the theatre contributed to the ambience. At any rate, I loved everything about Julia, including the incredible true story–as we were led to believe at the time–along with the European locales, the cinematography by Douglas Slocombe, the breathtakingly composed opening shot, the stunning score by Georges Delerue, the luxe period costumes by Anthea Sylbert, and, of course, the righteous performances of Fonda, Vanessa Redgrave (seen mostly in flashbacks as the glorious title character), Jason Robards Jr. (as Hammett), and Maximilian Schell (particularly good as the enigmatic emissary known as Mr. Johann). Fonda nabbed another Academy nod for playing a woman with tremendous gumption in spite of herself, but her generosity with other actors was becoming apparent as Redgrave and Robards both won golden statuettes–it was Robards’ second consecutive win–and Schell yielded an additional nomination. As much as I love Diane Keaton, my heart broke when Fonda lost the Oscar to the Annie Hall star. I’d never experienced anything as emotionally nuanced as the big reunion scene between Lillian and Julia in a Berlin cafe. I was willing putty in the hands of two highly skilled thespians, and it felt like heaven. I didn’t react nearly as strongly to Annie Hall, so, yes, Fonda’s loss broke my heart; however, it would not stay broken for long.\n\nIn the fall of 1977, Newsweek deemed Fonda and Julia worthy of a cover story: “Hollywood’s New Heroines.” Indeed, it was a heady time for actresses as earlier the same year, the same magazine featured no less than Sissy Spacek (below) just as she was being feted by the Academy for Carrie and co-starring with Shelley Duvall and Janice Rule in Robert Altman’s 3 Women. Duvall later tied for Best Actress at that year’s Cannes fest and would have likely figured in the Oscar race in a less competitive year. How competitive was it? Well, all five of that year’s Best Actress nominees starred in Best Picture finalists: Diane Keaton in Annie Hall, Anne Bancroft and Shirley MacLaine in The Turning Point, Marsha Mason in The Goodbye Girl, and Fonda; moreover, The Turning Point and Julia went into the final stretch as the frontrunners with 11 nominations each, including Best Picture and Best Director. (Julia was directed by legendary Fred Zinneman, already a two-time winner for From Here to Eternity and A Man for All Seasons [1].) Star Wars was next with 10 nods. [<The three most nominated films, btw, were all released by 20th Century Fox, clearly having a banner year.] The list of failed Best Actress possibilities from that race includes not only Duvall and Spacek but also Liza Minelli (New York, New York), Kathleen Quinlan (I Never Promised You a Rose Garden), Gena Rowlands (Opening Night), and Lily Tomlin (The Late Show), all of whom were Globe nominated. That was also the year that Keaton dazzled critics in the steamy big screen adaptation of Looking for Mr. Goodbar, Judith Rossner’s sensational novel about a doomed thrill-seeker amid New York City’s ever adventurous swingle scene. Cases could be made for a few other sterling performances in films that were relatively obscure or otherwise indifferently received, but you get the gist.\n\nComing Home (1978): With this earnest tale of Vietnam veterans learning to cope in a politically charged climate, Fonda moved from onscreen talent to behind the scenes mover-and-shaker as she co-produced the film with partner Bruce Gilbert. At the time, many Americans who either fought in the war or lost loved ones during the fight, criticized Fonda for being a hypocrite given the militancy in which she had previously attacked the war and anyone connected to it, but the film actually shows a great deal of compassion for the soldiers who sacrificed some of their humanity while fighting a senseless and unpopular war. Of course, it’s always been easy to dismiss Coming Home, as well, as an icky love triangle in which an affection starved woman finds sexual happiness from a seemingly incapacitated pacifist (Jon Voight) rather than an overwound gung-ho soldier (Bruce Dern), and, yes, I guess that claim is hard to dismiss, but I also think there’s lots of other stuff to praise, mostly the believable, nuanced performances, and the compassion the filmmakers show for the vets. To clarify, many of the patients at the VA hospital are actually played by real-life veterans, and, per the DVD, they improvised their dialogue in key scenes. The movie competed against, among others, writer-director Michael Cimino’s macho-fueled, operatic Vietnam epic The Deer Hunter for Oscar’s top prize though Fonda and Voight claimed top honors for Best Actress and Best Actor respectively. Voight also won the Cannes Best Actor prize; meanwhile, Bruce Dern and Penelope Milford, as a woman Fonda befriends at the VA hospital, welcomed nods in the supporting acting categories [2]. Oddly, Fonda is absent from the DVD commentary though Voight, Dern, and cinematographer Haskell Wexler contribute. The movie clocks-in at #78 on the AFI countdown of the 100 greatest love stories.\n\nThe China Syndrome (1979): This suspenseful, nuclear power cautionary tale opened on Friday, March 16, 1979. I saw it the following Monday, March 19, at one of the GCC NorthPark theaters, either the I & II near the mall, or III & IV across the expressway. My gut tells me the latter, but more than 30 years later, it’s no longer crystal clear. Plus, that’s not even the real story. No, the real story unfolded on March 28, 1979, when one of the reactors at the Three Mile Island nuclear power facility in Philadelphia suffered a partial meltdown and made headlines and cover stories all across the map. In an instant, Fonda found herself with the most relevant movie of the year, and all of us who’d already seen it could barely, well, contain ourselves. Naturally, I had to take a second and third look in the Three Mile Island aftermath. Fonda plays a flame-haired TV reporter, a throwback to the vintage Brenda Starr comic strip, who’s often assigned fluff stories but stumbles upon a cover-up at a plant outside of Los Angeles. Her eager cameraman is played by Michael Douglas, who also shares producer credit. The trio is rounded out by Jack Lemmon as a plant supervisor who knows more than he cares to admit. The whole thing just builds and builds to a shocking climax, and Fonda’s Kimberly Wells serves as the audience’s surrogate along the way. On one hand, the actress seems to be repeating herself by playing a naive woman whose consciousness is raised. On the other hand, the characters are otherwise night and day, and Fonda works hard to make Wells unique. Unsurprisingly, she earned her third consecutive Best Actress Oscar nod, also unsurprisingly losing to Sally Field in Norma Rae (a role that Fonda might have played under other circumstances) in a race that also included Bette Midler’s powerhouse debut in The Rose. The China Syndrome appears on the AFI’s list of greatest thrillers, weighing in at #94.\n\nNine to Five (1980): Not the funniest ever made, but a lot of fun, and a huge, huge, hit. Fonda’s business savvy is evident all over this offering about sexism and office politics as three capable yet undervalued secretarial workers unite against macho-fueled corporate tyranny. Fonda and company [3] shine light on the very real disparity between men and women in the workplace, an issue not entirely resolved today but especially noteworthy at the time, yet the message is cloaked in a more than generous dollop of humor. See? Nine to Five has a message, but it’s also an office comedy; likewise, The China Syndrome works as a suspense flick, and Coming Home tells a moving, complex love story. Fonda remembers her audience as well as her purpose. In this one, she portrays a prim divorcee trying dutifully to fit-in with her more seasoned co-workers, and she’s a constant delight as her straight-laced “Judy” learns to roll with the punches though more often later rather than sooner. Of course, in Nine to Five she’s aided immeasurably, once again, by her ability to cast the right people. In this case, Lily Tomlin as the generally sensible widow with children who’s continually passed over for promotions, and Dolly Parton, in her film debut as a cute, curvaceous, and plainspoken secretary constantly fighting her boss’s sexual advances. (Give credit to Dabney Coleman for making the most of the women’s boss, “a sexist, egotistical, lying hypocritical bigot”; to his credit he understood who the stars of the movie were and didn’t get in their way.) The DVD commentary is a real treat as the three stars are reunited, and their affection for one another is most apparent. Of course, Parton didn’t just act in the film, she wrote the catchy title tune which, let’s face it, has become a workforce anthem. Parton nabbed an Oscar nod for the tune. She also scored a handful of Globe nominations: Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy; Best Newcomer, and, yes, Best Song. She lost the song award to the ubiquitous “Fame” (from the movie of the same name). Parton went on to snare a pair of Grammy awards as well as a People’s Choice award for her track. Nine to Five is an AFI fave as it ranks #74 on its roster of funniest comedies while Parton’s ditty comes in at #78 on the organization’s list of greatest movie songs [4].\n\nJane Fonda in Nine to Five (above) and Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie (below), practically separated at birth: same curly hairdo, similar glasses, and high-neck fussy wardrobe.\n\nOn Golden Pond (1981): Arguably Fonda’s most personable film as it presented the opportunity for her to appear onscreen with her dad, screen icon Henry Fonda. The actress-producer and her partner purchased Ernest Thompson’s play about an aging couple’s annual summer retreat, and a final attempt for their grown daughter–with a son of her own–to work through longtime conflicts with her ornery, distant dad. Though some critics complained that the resulting effort was just a tad too sweet, the public gobbled it up, going back again and again and making it one of 1981’s top tier hits though it technically made most of its money in early 1982. At Oscar time, it garnered 10 nods [5], including Best Picture and Best Director (Mark Rydell), placing second only to Warren Beatty’s epic Reds which led the pack with 12. Ultimately, Chariots of Fire pulled a Best Picture upset. Incredibly, in spite of being one of America’s most beloved actors, Henry Fonda had only been twice nominated by the Academy at that point: for playing Tom Joad in 1940’s The Grapes of Wrath, and for co-producing 1957’s Best Picture candidate Twelve Angry Men, in which he also starred. A year prior to On Golden Pond, Mr. Fonda had been honored with an honorary Oscar for his body of work; however, with his daughter’s vision, he found the perfect valedictory role and won a competitive Oscar at last. Alas, Mr. Fonda’s health was in rapid decline, and he was unable to attend the 1981/82 ceremony. Jane accepted the award for him. He passed away in August of 1982 at the age of 77. The AFI has singled this one out multiple times, including the enduring romance between the characters enacted by Mr. Fonda and Ms. Hepburn (100 Years…100 Passions) and the inspirational message of the film as a whole (100 Years…100 Cheers).\n\nAgnes of God (1985): No Fonda Oscar nod for this one, nor did she produce it, but she still gives a compelling performance in Norman Jewison’s adaptation of John Pielmeier’s successful play about a court appointed psychiatrist investigating a novice who claims she gave birth to a dead baby after an immaculate conception. Though Fonda did not find favor with the Academy for this one, she shares the screen with no less than Anne Bancroft (l) and Meg Tilly (r), both of whom did make the Academy’s short list: Bancroft for playing the formidable Mother Superior who clashes repeatedly with Fonda, and Tilly, sublime, as the troubled novice. Geraldine Page took the Best Actress Oscar that year for The Trip to Bountiful while Angelica Huston nabbed supporting actress honors for her wicked, wicked Maerose Prizzi in Prizzi’s Honor.\n\nThe Morning After (1986): This Sidney Lumet mystery signals Fonda’s last Oscar nomination, a nod I’ve always felt was, well, generous. Oh, don’t get me wrong. Fonda demonstrates in scene after scene that she is more than capable of emoting–as if none of us knew that already–but I also think she’s somehow miscast. Simply, she doesn’t look like the boozy, washed-up, movie actress that the script keeps saying she is, the next big thing that never was. Mainly, she just looks like she’s acting. A lot. Personally, and for reasons that might not be easily explained, I’ve always thought the role would have been better served by Angie Dickinson–and that’s not an insult to Dickinson. I just think she had a worldly lived-in glamour that robust Fonda–at the peak of her fitness empire–lacked. Plus, Dickinson deserved a meaty role at that point in her career; however, this was yet again a feature that Fonda developed with her partner, so mine is a moot consideration. Dickinson or any other actress never stood a chance. The movie opens promisingly enough as Fonda’s hot mess of a character wakes up next to a dead body, a stabbing victim, in a strange loft. Unfortunately, it doesn’t work so well as a mystery because there aren’t enough suspects to make the story compelling, and the “reveal” seems tacked on almost as an afterthought. Still, Lumet provides a visually interesting tour of sunny LA, a novelty for the famously east coast based director. Fonda’s co-stars include Jeff Bridges and Raul Julia.\n\nAfter The Morning After, Fonda completed the overblown, if entertaining, Old Gringo (1989) with Jimmy Smits and Gregory Peck–the latter as no less than fabled writer Ambrose Bierce. From there, she filmed Stanley and Iris (1990) with Robert DeNiro, and then she took a decade-plus break from movies during her marriage to media mogul Ted Turner. She made a comeback with Monster-in-Law, opposite Jennifer Lopez, in 2005 and even copped a Golden Globe nod. She also published her memoirs to considerable acclaim. Since then, she has triumphed on Broadway in 33 Variations, enjoyed a recurring role on Aaron Sorkin’s Newsroom, and appeared–briefly–as Nancy Reagan in last year’s White House based hit, Lee Daniels’ The Butler. She and Tomlin are prepping a new series for Netflix. I’m glad she came out of retirement and continues to find interesting projects. It’s crazy to me that she’s only three years younger than my mother and about the same age that her father was when he passed away. Amazing. I can hardly wait to see what she does next. Maybe I’ll watch the AFI telecast after all.\n\nThanks, Jane…\n\nTNT airs the AFI tribute to Jane Fonda on Saturday, June 14, 2014. Check your listings for times.\n\n[*] This alleged twist of fate involving Fonda, Ann-Margret, and Cat Ballou might only be the stuff of legend though it is reported on the IMDb as well as in Ann-Margret’s autobiography (p. 89 in my long cherished paperback copy). Anyway, we just have to take Margret’s word for it. I don’t remember reading anything about it Fonda’s book. I will say that I can imagine it happening since during that era, the mid 1960s, Jane Fonda, Ann-Margret, and, say, Tuesday Weld loomed large as saucy starlets who could play darling ingenues one minute and then sex it up for a walk on the wild side–the title of one of Fonda’s films–the next. Btw: Per Margret, her agent signed her up for Kitten with a Whip after turning down Cat Ballou.\n\n[1] Writer Alvin Sargant won the first of his two Oscars for his Julia screenplay; he won again for 19890’s Ordinary People, adapted from Judith Guest’s best-selling novel.\n\n[2] The trio of Nancy Dowd, Walso Salt, and Robert C. Jones won Oscars for the Coming Home screenplay; technically, Salt and Jones received final credit for reworking Dowd’s original treatment. Salt, who also won for 1969’s Midnight Cowboy (starring Jon Voight), has since been memorialized with an annual screenwriting award at the Sundance Film Festival named in his honor. Actress/writer/director/producer Lake Bell won that honor in 2013 for her wryly amusing In a World.\n\n[3] “and company” includes, among others, director and co-writer Colin Higgins along with co-writer Patricia Resnick. Higgins famously wrote Harold & Maude, which was directed by the previously mentioned Hal Ashby, also of Coming Home. Higgins would later direct Parton in the rousing Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.\n\n[4] Nine to Five‘s legacy includes two TV spin-offs, one on ABC and the other syndicated, both of them featuring Rachel Denison, Parton’s younger sister, as Doralee. The show also spawned a short-lived Broadway musical featuring songs by Parton and a cast that included Tony nominee Alison Janney in the Tomlin role.\n\n[5] Thompson won an Oscar for adapting his own play.\n\nFor several years, entertainment reporters, movie biz insiders and/or analysts have been mourning the passing of the institution once known as “The Movie Star.” Oh, please don’t misunderstand. I think the general moviegoing public is still as fascinated by the Angelina Jolies and George Clooneys as they ever were, though both of them have had their share of clunkers, and wasn’t Robert Downey Jr. just named the highest paid movie star of the year thanks to his recent turns as Iron Man in both his own movies as well as The Avengers franchise? [1] Certainly, Hollywood is still willing to pay top dollar for high profile talent. Downey, btw, reportedly earned 75 million in the year or so [2].\n\nOn the other hand, movie stars are no longer necessarily the guaranteed draw, or draws, that they once were. Since probably about the 80s and much more so now, the studios and even the big talent agencies have been pushing the idea of the high concept package, and that often means more and more emphasis on easily marketable franchises: movies based on comic books (I mean graphic novels), games, and, of course, sequels. If these movies score with big-name stars such as two-time Oscar nominee Downey, that’s great! If such movies score with lesser known talents, well, that’s probably even better for the studios–at least for awhile–since they are in more enviable positions when it comes to salary/contract negotiations with performers who might still be floating somewhere under the radar of the public consciousness.\n\nStill, the point is what we once thought of as true-blue movie stars are no longer the guaranteed draws they were back in the day–not that every old-time Hollywood star never knew defeat, but, typically, the old studios took great care handling talent, with movies designed to play to a particular performer’s strength; likewise, movies were marketed much differently than they are now. Even so, the public often responded accordingly. Moviegoers bought tickets to see their favorite stars in a variety of scenarios, often with the reasonable expectation of a good story with excellent performances and production values, and that’s no longer the case to the degree that it once was. Let me give you an example. Less than two years ago, Warner Bros. released Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, a post 9-11 movie toplined by two of America’s most beloved stars, Tom Hanks, a two-time Oscar winner, and Sandra Bullock–her first role since the blockbuster The Blind Side, also from Warner’s, which earned her a Best Actress Oscar. The movie, to put it nicely, performed sluggishly at the box office. Now, this isn’t a slam against Hanks or Bullock. Likewise, people might not have been in the mood for a movie that revisited 9-11 so close to the Xmas holiday. No matter. My point is that even with all their years and years of residual audience goodwill, the allure of Hanks and Bullock was simply not a guarantee of box office legs. On the other hand, it’s hard to imagine that Bullock’s latest smash, The Heat, would work with just anyone. Audiences have been flocking to see what happens when Bullock is specifically paired with the juggernaut known as Melissa McCarthy.\n\nNow, the reason for pointing out this trend can be summed up in exactly two words: Bette Midler. You know, I worked in the movie biz for over twenty years, and one of the things I noticed was the pull that a very select few stars had with the public, and Midler was one of them. During her reign as a top draw in comedies released through Disney’s Touchstone division, patrons at my box office window were more likely to plop down their money and ask for tickets to see “Bette Midler” than they were to ask for her given film by name. If she had a movie playing, customers wanted to see it, and they didn’t even really care what it was called. This is not as common as you might have imagined. Most people don’t come up and ask for just any ole actor: Meryl Streep, Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson, Cameron Diaz, Hilary Swank, Jamie Fox, etc. Again, not that those stars haven’t had their share of hits, or that they weren’t occasionally referred to by name. With Midler, it was constant. You know who else customers used to ask for by name with alarming regularity? Ashley Judd. That’s right, Ashely Judd. I noticed this one Saturday when I was selling tickets for Judd’s slickly packaged Ida Lupinoesque “Woman-in-Jep” flick, Double Jeopardy. (See the “jep” part was no exaggeration.) Keep in mind that Judd’s high-profile co-star in this twisty thriller was no less than Texas’s own–Oscar winning–Tommy Lee Jones, but nobody asked for “Tommy Lee Jones” or “Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones.” They wanted to see “Ashley Judd”–to the degree that Judd’s movie spent three weeks at number one in the fall of 1999 [3]. Her follow-up, Eye of the Beholder tanked–but only after opening at #1 on the domestic box office charts. Oh, and once again, people still asked for “Ashley Judd.” I don’t recall that even Julia Roberts or Sandra Bullock were referred to by name with the same consistency as Judd though I do seem to remember that customers frequently asked for “Jodie Foster”–especially during the era of Panic Room and Flight Plan.\n\nAs for the men, I can assure you that people quite often ask for “007” rather than the name of any particular James Bond movie–no matter who’s playing the leading role. Way, way, back in the day, customers would quite often ask for “Bronson” (Charles Bronson), “Chuck Norris,” or “Arnold”–as in Schwarzenegger. I guess quite a few ticket buyers chimed in with”Tom Cruise” at one time. Additionally, seemingly everybody is on a first name basis with “Denzel.” I heard “Denzel” much more frequently than I ever heard “Denzel Washington, please.” Oh, and generally Woody Allen fans will just say “Woody” or “Woody Allen” though his movies are typically niche oriented and play more to his core audience than to wide audiences.\n\nNow, what about Bette? From the time she appeared with Richard Dreyfuss and Nick Nolte in Paul Mazursky’s Down and Out in Beverly Hills (an update on the French film Boudu Saved from Drowning) in early 1986 until the summer of 1988’s Big Business, co-starring Lily Tomlin, Midler was surely the undisputed queen of mainstream Hollywood comedies, all of them developed and released by the people at Touchstone, the then new arm of the Disney corporation, a move that allowed the powerful conglomerate to venture into more noticeably adult, or topical, content, including Splash (1984), Country (also 1984), and even NBC-TV’s The Golden Girls. Prior to her Disney windfall, Midler had famously scored an Oscar nomination for her first leading role in a major motion picture: 1979’s The Rose, a musical drama loosely based on the sad life and times of Texas’s own blues-rocker Janis Joplin. Of course, Midler has also been quoted as saying the harrowing pic was also based, at least in part, on her stormy relationship with her own controlling manager/agent/producer Aaron Russo, who actually co-produced the film; his onscreen counterpart is played by the late Alan Bates, but I digress. Anyway, in spite of all the acclaim generated by The Rose, Midler’s next big screen feature, Jinxed was a notorious fiasco and pretty much curtailed her acting career, that is, until the folks at Disney came calling. (For those late to the party, before Midler branched into movies, she was a Grammy winning recording artist best known for covers of oldies, torch songs, and a bawdy concert persona.)\n\nAfter Big Business, Midler seemed bound and determined to score in mawkish dramas. Oh sure, she managed to get by with Beaches, co-starring Barbara Hershey. Based on Iris Rainer Dart’s novel of the same name, Beaches covers a few decades in the lives of up-and-down childhood friends from quite different backgrounds, a variation on the likes of Old Acquaintance (Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins), which had already been remade in 1981 as Rich and Famous with Jacqueline Bisset and Candice Bergen. A mixed bag, Beaches benefited from a smash soundtrack featuring Midler’s Grammy winning cover of “Wind Beneath My Wings”; however, her attempt at revamping Barbara Stanwyck’s Oscar nominated Stella Dallas was much less successful, and soon afterward, Midler and Disney parted ways. For the Boys, Midler’s labor of love (seemingly inspired by the likes of Martha Raye and Bob Hope), developed through her All Girls Productions, and heavily, heavily marketed by 20th Century Fox during the 1991 holiday season, was a bust though Academy members, impressed as they were by Midler’s pluck, saw fit to reward her with a Best Actress nomination. Since then, her film output has slowed considerably though there have been a few highlights, most notably The First Wives Club, and, okay, I guess Hocus Pocus (1993, also Disney) has acquired a loyal following.\n\nStill, I want to focus on Midler’s original comedy quartet: Down and Out in Beverly Hills (1986), Ruthless People (a riff on O. Henry’s “The Ransom of Red Chief,” directed by the Airplane trio of David Zucker, Jim Abrahams, and Jerry Zucker), the ever-so-slightly Shakespeare inspired Outrageous Fortune (1987) co-starring Shelley Long (directed by Arthur Hiller), and the aforementioned Big Business with Lily Tomlin (directed by a solo Jim Abrahams). Once again, I want to stress that customers most often asked for “Bette Midler.” Not “Bette Midler and Shelley Long” and not “Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin.” Just Bette. These days, I tend to avoid both Ruthless People and Outrageous Fortune. The former is funny as hell, but it hasn’t aged well, becoming a relic of mostly what was awful about the 1980s; that’s pretty much the same with Outrageous Fortune. The production values are lousy, and the producers had to work hard–though not always successfully–to try to hide the fact that Midler was very much pregnant, and while she and Long both had their moments, and their are plenty of laughs, their chemistry didn’t strike many sparks. At least not in the same way that Midler and Tomlin do in Big Business, itself a take-off on Shakespeare’s The Comedy of Errors, which is my favorite of all the Midler flicks of that era.\n\nOf course, a comedy about two sets of twins has the potential for a lot of laughs and hilarious plot complications. After all, it’s been working since Shakespeare’s time, right? Plus, besides the obvious joy in pairing Midler and Tomlin as twins on top of twins, the movie has strong production values, meaning a handsome, lushly appointed Hollywood sound-stage recreation of New York’s fabled Plaza Hotel, which is where most of the story takes place. That, and some nice NYC exteriors including the real Plaza Hotel. Oh, and cheers to the costume designer Michael Kaplan for coming up with designs that not only serve the characters and help establish their personalities but also serve to show the connections between them, thereby advancing the plot. all of which brings us back to Midler and Tomlin.\n\nWhat I love most about this film are the performances by these two gifted thesps, each of them bringing to life two distinctive characters. Two actresses, four performances. Midler plays a fiercely ambitious corporate mogul who mixes business with pleasure and doesn’t suffer fools gladly. Her twin is naively ambitious with dreams of big city life, most of which have been fueled by watching too much TV, including glitzy prime-time soaper Dynasty. As this character, Midler acts with unfettered joy. When she’s on a roll, her eyes practically sparkle; as the tough talking, demanding executive, she delivers wicked one-liners with supreme self-possession. She even holds herself differently. No doubt, Midler scores the biggest laughs. Audiences are tickled by her bumpkin’s learning curve and startled by her big boss’s bitchiness. As good as Midler is, Tomlin perhaps goes even further in delineating her characters: one twin is a big city fluttery neurotic with romantic notions of settling down in the country while the other twin is a sturdy, no-nonsense country gal, ever vigilant in her mission to protect the interests of her community from greedy corporate snakes. It’s fun watching Tomlin see how far she can go with each character, with or without a big laugh. It’s not just that she speaks in a different tone of voice for each character or that her body language is so different. No, it’s that these details are different in ways that seem exactly right. Plus, as already noted, the actresses get a lot of help from costumer Kaplan [4]: Midler’s characters tend to favor brighter colors, especially red and burnt orange, with the bumpkin trying to pull together–on a budget–what she believes approximates the glamorous wardrobe of her big city counterpart–without resorting to caricature. Also, look closely at how polka dots appear and reappear between Midler’s characters’ outfits; meanwhile, Tomlin’s separated-at-birth twins are drawn to pastels, especially pinks, while the country gal dresses strictly for comfort or function, and the city girl drapes herself in layers of soft, feminine fabrics.\n\nSpeaking of twins, and the clothes they wear, I cannot let pass the opportunity to point out how incredibly similar 2006’s The Devil Wears Prada is to Big Business in one key sequence: the entrance of feared fashion editor Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep) into the Runway offices seems to have been lifted almost frame for frame Midler’s introduction in Big Business. Take a look.\n\n^ In the role of big city Sadie, Bette Midler’s entrance into Big Business’s Moramax building could have very well inspired a similar sequence in The Devil Wears Prada, 18 years later.\n\n^ A slightly abbreviated version of Miranda’s entrance in The Devil Wears Prada. At about 45 seconds, it starts looking more and more like Big Business. Have fun!\n\nThanks for your consideration….\n\n[1][2]: USA Today reports on Robert Downey Jr’s status per Forbes: http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2013/07/16/robert-downey-jr-is-hollywoods-highest-paid-actor-says-forbes/2522583/\n\n[3]: Double Jeopardy at Box Office Mojo: http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&id=doublejeopardy.htm\n\n[4]: Kaplan’s many credits include 1983’s influential Flashdance (1983) as well as Clue (1985), and 1989’s Cousins (which I wrote about in June of 2012).
