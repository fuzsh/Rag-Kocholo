Have an account? .\n\nA growing number of celebrities have opened up about being attracted to more than one gender.\n\nSome identify as bisexual (Halsey, Cardi B, Kit Connor) or pansexual (Janelle Monáe, Miley Cyrus).\n\nOther stars prefer to identify as queer, while still more forgo labels for a more fluid approach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBillie Eilish said she likes \"boys and girls.\"\n\nEilish nonchalantly discussed her sexuality in a cover story for Variety, which was published in November 2023.\n\nEilish described herself as \"physically attracted\" to women, adding, \"I'm attracted to them for real.\"\n\nThe Grammy-winning singer did not use a specific label to identify her sexuality. Shortly after, Eilish attended the Variety Hitmakers event, where she was interviewed on the red carpet.\n\nAfter describing women as \"pretty,\" the interviewer asked if Eilish intended to \"come out\" with her cover story.\n\n\"No, I didn't,\" Eilish said with a laugh. \"But I kinda thought, wasn't it obvious? Like it's kinda been... I didn't realize people didn't know.\"\n\n\"I just don't really believe in it,\" she added, referring to the concept of \"coming out.\" \"Why can't we just exist? I've been doing this for a long time and I just didn't talk about it.\"\n\nShe later clarified on Instagram: \"I like boys and girls leave me alone about it please literally who cares.\"\n\nEilish, who has publicly dated rapper 7: AMP and rocker Jesse Rutherford, sings explicitly about her attraction to women in \"Lunch,\" the lead single from her third studio album, \"Hit Me Hard and Soft.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIce Spice included a nod to queerness in her hit song \"Bikini Bottom.\"\n\nIn her 2022 single \"Bikini Bottom,\" which became a runaway smash on TikTok, Ice Spice included a line about being attracted to both men and women.\n\n\"I like n-----, bitches too,\" she raps in the second verse. \"Ayo, baddie, what it do?\"\n\nIn a video for Genius explaining the lyrics, the Bronx rapper said this was very intentional.\n\n\"So I was just like, they need to know. We're here and we're queer,\" she said. \"So, period.\"\n\nJust a few months later, Ice Spice was tapped to feature on Taylor Swift's \"Karma,\" in which she sprinkled similar winks about her sexuality.\n\nNext to Swift's lyrics like \"Karma is my boyfriend,\" Ice Spice raps, \"Karma is that girl\" and \"Karma is a fire in your house / And she 'bout to pop up unannounced.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoebe Bridgers is bisexual.\n\nAs one-third of the supergroup boygenius, Phoebe Bridgers opened up to Vogue UK about what it means to be a visibly queer band during a surge of anti-LGBTQ legislation.\n\n\"I'm so proud of our group dynamic, and as a bisexual woman in straight relationships, it feels weird to talk about it so much,\" Bridgers said.\n\n\"That said, I wish there were more types of queer people visible to me when I was growing up, and when it comes to our band and our shared dynamic, I have no shame about stepping forward and being like, 'This is what we look like and how we feel and what we believe in,'\" she continued.\n\nIn the past, she was romantically linked to voice actor Emily Bannon, who apparently inspired the boygenius song \"Emily I'm Sorry.\" Bridgers is currently dating the comedian Bo Burnham.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLucy Dacus said she prefers \"queer\" as a \"catch-all term.\"\n\nDacus publicly identified herself as queer during a 2016 interview with NPR.\n\nIn 2021, the \"Night Shift\" singer wrote an essay for Oprah Daily, in which she reflected on that experience and grappled with the concept of \"coming out.\"\n\n\"My mom called me after she read it, concerned, because she still saw the word 'queer' as a slur,\" she wrote. \"I told her what it means to me, why I like it as a catch-all term, how it feels like saying not straight and none of your business.\"\n\n\"For some members of my family, this essay may be me coming out to them, if they read it. I've heard that coming out never ends, which sounds exhausting,\" Dacus continued. \"Maybe I instinctively understood that coming out would never end and the fear of exhaustion is what kept me from beginning for so long. But there is also the exhaustion of ignoring yourself.\"\n\nThat same month, Dacus discussed the various labels for her sexuality with The New York Times.\n\n\"Gay is the overarching word, queer is the better overarching word and more specifically bisexual or pansexual,\" she said. \"I have no allegiance. I think gender is a joke.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHalsey actively fights against bisexual erasure.\n\nHalsey, who is currently dating actor Avan Jogia, has written several songs about her relationships and trysts with women, such as \"Strangers,\" \"Bad At Love,\" \"Wipe Your Tears,\" and \"Honey.\"\n\n\"I'm a young, bisexual woman, and I've spent a large part of my life trying to validate myself — to my friends, to my family, to myself — trying to prove that who I love and how I feel is not a phase; it's not part of some confusion that's going to change or could be manipulated,\" the Grammy-nominated singer said while accepting the GLAAD award for Outstanding Musician in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAubrey Plaza said she could fall in love with anyone.\n\nThe \"White Lotus\" star spoke about her fluid sexuality during a 2016 interview with The Advocate.\n\n\"I know I have an androgynous thing going on, and there's something masculine about my energy,\" Plaza said, when asked if women ever flirt with her.\n\n\"Girls are into me — that's no secret. Hey, I'm into them too. I fall in love with girls and guys. I can't help it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll three members of MUNA identify as queer.\n\nThe three members of MUNA, Katie Gavin, Josette Maskin, and Naomi McPherson, have long been advocates for the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nThe pop band makes explicitly gay music, from the cult-favorite anthem \"I Know a Place\" to the 2022 bop \"What I Want\" (\"I want the fireworks / I want the chemistry / I want that girl right over there to wanna date me / That's what I want, there's nothing wrong with what I want\").\n\nGavin, MUNA's lead singer and songwriter, described the latter song as \"a second adolescence; a surge that comes with that certainty.\"\n\n\"And then you want to make up for lost time,\" McPherson said in their interview with Vice, while Maskin added, \"That's just the queer experience, isn't it?\"\n\nIn 2023, Gavin wrote a love letter to the LGBTQ+ community for Billboard's ongoing series.\n\n\"My love for us spills into all the different corners and crevices of the city under our colorful canopy,\" Gavin wrote. \"One of the things I'm most thankful for about being queer is that it liberated me from fulfilling others' expectations of me, and forced me to focus on what gives me joy.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardi B opened up about her bisexuality when she was accused of \"queerbaiting.\"\n\nThe Grammy-winning rapper hit back at accusations of \"queerbaiting\" after she released a sensual music video with Normani for their 2021 single \"Wild Side.\"\n\n\"I'm married to a man but I have [expressed] soo much about my bisexuality and my experiences wit girls,\" she wrote on Twitter, referring to her on-and-off relationship with Offset.\n\n\"I don't like this new 'queer baiting' word,\" she continued, arguing that it pressures celebrities to show proof of their sexual experiences if they express queer themes in their art.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanelle Monáe first identified as bisexual, but has since come out as pansexual.\n\n\"Being a queer black woman in America, someone who has been in relationships with both men and women — I consider myself to be a free-ass motherfucker,\" Monáe said in a 2018 interview with Rolling Stone.\n\nAs the article makes clear, Monáe first identified as bisexual. \"But then later I read about pansexuality and was like, 'Oh, these are things that I identify with too,'\" Monae said. \"I'm open to learning more about who I am.\"\n\nMonáe, who also identifies as nonbinary, frequently explores queer themes in her music, as with her 2018 single \"Pynk.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLady Gaga has been openly bisexual since 2009.\n\nGaga famously came out as bisexual during a 2009 interview wth Barbara Walters. The pop star and award-winning actress has written multiple songs expressing her attraction to women, and previously said anyone claiming \"she's bisexual for marketing\" is lying.\n\nIn 2019, she made a speech at New York's WorldPride celebration that sparked a conversation online about bisexual erasure within the LGBTQ community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAngelina Jolie said she's open to dating anyone, regardless of gender.\n\nJolie has publicly dated both men and women, including Brad Pitt, with whom she shares six children, and model Jenny Shimizu in the '90s.\n\nDuring a 2003 interview with Barbara Walters, Jolie opened up about her fluid approach to sexuality.\n\n\"I consider myself a very sexual person who loves who she loves, whatever sex they may be,\" she said, adding: \"I feel if I fell in love with a woman tomorrow, would I… it's OK and it's right to want to kiss her and touch her if I fell in love with her in that way? Yeah.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTinashe identifies as bisexual.\n\nThe \"Nasty\" singer discussed her bisexuality in a 2020 cover story for Gay Times.\n\n\"I tend to shy away from terms — I guess this is the theme of my life! — that make people want to categorize me or put me in a box,\" Tinashe said. \"I don't like that shit. But I can still give you a general sense of yeah, I'm bisexual. I'm somewhere on the spectrum.\"\n\n\"It's not like all bisexual people like men and women equally, or like all bisexual people are a certain type of person,\" she continued. \"Human beings are so versatile. I don't understand why we're so obsessed with categorizing each other.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVictoria Monét came out as bisexual in 2018.\n\nShortly after the release of Ariana Grande's hit single \"Thank U, Next,\" which Monét cowrote, she clarified her sexuality on Twitter.\n\n\"I want everyone to know that I'm single (since people wanna pretend I'm not) and make imaginary rules for me,\" she wrote. \"I secretly and respectfully went through a difficult break up this summer but enough is enough.\"\n\n\"I also like girls. Thank U, Next. Bye,\" Monét added,\n\nThe \"Jaguar\" singer later described her coming out experience as \"a buttercup version because I was really lucky.\"\n\n\"It should feel more warm for everybody,\" she told Billboard. \"I think we should make people more comfortable.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAngèle said her parents were \"very surprised\" when she brought a girlfriend home.\n\nToday, Angèle openly identifies as bisexual, but the Belgian pop sensation didn't have a chance to tell her family before she was outed by the French press.\n\n\"If I had said to my parents: I think I like girls, then it would have been fine, but I didn't warn them, so it was a shock for them,\" she told The Guardian. \"I think I always knew even when I was young, but when I was 15 and at school it really wasn't cool to be bisexual. It was even a bit shameful.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBaby Queen told BI that she's bisexual, but isn't attached to any particular label.\n\nBaby Queen wrote her breakout hit \"Want Me\" about having a crush on \"Killing Eve\" star Jodie Comer.\n\nAsked about this inspiration in 2021, the singer-songwriter told Business Insider that she's still exploring her sexuality.\n\n\"I'm going to be honest. I don't know,\" she said. \"I'm fine for other people to know that I don't know, because I don't think anyone knows. I'd say, like, bisexual — but also, I just don't know. I feel like I need to figure it out. I need to go speed dating.\"\n\nDuring a subsequent interview with BI in 2022, Baby Queen revealed that she is open to dating people of all genders, though she hasn't had much luck using apps like Raya.\n\n\"It's horrific,\" she joked. \"All the guys are looking for blonde influencer girls... I don't fit into that. And all the girls are looking for rich football players. No one has matched with me.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKit Connor came out as bisexual after saying he's \"not too big on labels.\"\n\nConnor, who stars as the bisexual character Nick Nelson on Netflix's \"Heartstopper,\" addressed the speculation about his sexuality during an appearance on the \"Reign With Josh Smith\" podcast.\n\n\"I mean, for me, I feel like I'm perfectly confident and comfortable with my sexuality,\" he said. \"I'm not too big on labels and things like that. I'm not massive about that, and I don't feel like I need to label myself, especially publicly.\"\n\nAfter fans of the show accused the actor of queerbaiting, he clarified his sexuality in a since-deleted tweet.\n\n\"I'm bi,\" he wrote. \"Congrats for forcing an 18-year-old to out himself. I think some of you missed the point of the show. Bye.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDove Cameron said she's \"super queer.\"\n\nIn a 2021 interview with the Gay Times, Dove Cameron said it felt important to speak candidly with fans about her sexuality.\n\n\"I've hinted about my sexuality for years while being afraid to spell it out for everybody,\" she said.\n\n\"I went on Instagram Live and said 'Guys, I really needed to explain something to you. Maybe I haven't said it, but I'm super queer,\" she continued. \"This is something I want to represent through my music because it's who I am.\"\n\nCameron has released songs with female pronouns and queer storylines, including the 2022 hit \"Boyfriend.\"\n\n\"I wasn't ever afraid of people knowing who I loved,\" she explained to E! News. \"More so, I was afraid of people having access to the human parts of me in an industry that can be so anti-human. That was definitely an emotional thing, but it turned out to be the best thing that could have ever happened to me. Mentally, I'm so much better now.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBebe Rexha said she's open to dating \"whoever inspires\" her.\n\nBebe Rexha opened up about her fluid sexuality in a 2021 interview with Gay Times, saying she's attracted to \"whoever inspires me.\"\n\n\"What I believe about sexuality is this: it's a scale,\" she said, adding that she considers herself \"fluid.\"\n\n\"Until I find 'the one,' I can't just say what I am. I just want to find someone I love and who loves me – and I don't care if that's a boy or a girl,\" she said.\n\nRexha, who recently dated filmmaker Keyan Safyari, added that she has fallen in love with women in the past.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKali Uchis said she's been \"bisexual my whole life.\"\n\nThe \"Telepatía\" singer opened up about her bisexuality in a 2021 interview with The Day.\n\n\"I've been bisexual my whole life,\" she said.\n\n\"People are constantly trying to find something to invalidate,\" Uchis continued. \"I want more people in the Latin community to feel like they can express themselves freely and not have to confine themselves.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLili Reinhart came out as bisexual on Instagram.\n\n\"Although I've never announced it publicly before, I am a proud bisexual woman,\" Reinhart wrote on her Instagram story.\n\nAlong with the announcement, she shared a poster for an \"LGBTQ+ for #BlackLivesMatter\" protest in West Hollywood, California, and encouraged her fans to come along.\n\nShe added, \"And I will be joining this protest today. Come join.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemi Lovato is pansexual.\n\nLovato, who initially came out as bisexual to their parents in 2017, said they now identify as pansexual during an episode of Joe Rogan's podcast.\n\n\"I'm so fluid now, and a part of the reason why I am so fluid is because I was, like, super closeted off,\" Lovato said.
