        "text": "John Legend - Ohio\n\nOne of the greatest voices of our time, John Legend, was born and raised in Springfield, Ohio. His mother homeschooled him, and, at four years old, Legend was already performing in his church choir.\n\nThanks to his homeschooling, Legend began high school at only 12 years of age. After graduating high school, he left Ohio to attend the University of Pennsylvania, but to this day remains Ohio's most exceptional pride.\n\nMichelle Williams - Montana\n\n\"Manchester by the Sea\" actress, Michelle Ingrid Williams started her journey in Kalispell, Montana. Her mom stayed at home, and her dad worked as an author and commodities trader. When she was nine, her family moved to San Diego, California, though that didn't change her love for Montana.\n\nThe actress mentions her home state often, explaining how she loved growing up in the vast open landscape of the state. “I grew up in Montana, and I most closely associate with being from Montana,” Williams said when explaining her transition to San Diego as a child.\n\nJosh Duhamel - North Dakota\n\nJosh Duhamel was born in Minot, North Dakota, and is very faithful to his home state. The actor played football for the Minot State University football team and eventually attended dental school before dropping out, only one and a half credits shy of his degree.\n\nThough he's found success in modeling and acting, Duhamel has become the face of North Dakota Tourism's advertising campaign. He's always been vocal about the pride he has for the state, which is something to be admired!\n\nTy Burrell - Oregon\n\nTy Burrell has taken TV by a storm as he portrays Phil Dunphy on \"Modern Family.\" Before he was television's favorite dad, he was just your average kid from Grants Pass, Oregon.\n\nHe grew up in a southern Oregon town called Applegate, where he played high school football. He stayed in the state for college as he attended Southern Oregon University in Ashland, but his career took him to California.\n\nBlake Shelton - Oklahoma\n\nIt's no secret that the country music star is an Oklahoma native! Blake Shelton was born and raised in Ada, Oklahoma. At age 17, he moved to Nashville to pursue a singing career, and as soon as his career took off, he made sure to return to his home state.\n\nDespite his fame, he is an active member of the Tishomingo community in which he owns a ranch. He is very vocal about his Oklahoma pride, “I like California, but I’m dyed-in-the-wool Oklahoma,\" he once said.\n\nJulianne Moore - North Carolina\n\nThough we have grown to know her as Julianne Moore, the actress was born Julie Ann Smith. She was born at the Fort Bragg army camp in North Carolina.

At age 16, she was introduced to acting and made a name for herself in the industry.\n\nDemi Lovato - New Mexico\n\nDemi Lovato was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, but her parents split shortly after she was born. Her mom moved her and her children to Dallas, Texas, where Demi was raised.

Gubler was born in Los Vegas, Nevada. Though he wanted to be a filmmaker, he graduated from the Las Vegas Academy of International Studies, Visual and Performing Arts, with a major in acting because the school didn’t offer a filmmaking program.\n\nGubler ended up following his passion for film making, as he graduated with a major in film directing from New York University's Tisch School of the Arts.\n\nChris Pratt - Minnesota\n\nSince he is such a Seattle Seahawks Fan, many assume Chris Pratt's birthplace is Washington. It turns out; he is actually from Minnesota. \"The Parks and Recreation\" actor was born in Virginia, Minnesota, where his father remodeled homes, and his mother worked at the Safeway supermarket.\n\nWhen he was seven years old, the actor and his family moved to Lake Stevens, Washington -- which may explain his Washington pride.\n\nMark Wahlberg - Massachusettes\n\nIt doesn't come as much of a surprise that many Hollywood stars were born and raised in Massachusetts. One of the biggest names to hail from the state is Mark Wahlberg. The youngest of nine children, the Boston native, had a difficult childhood filled with legal trouble and drugs.\n\nWahlberg went from \"Marky Mark,\" to one of the top names in Hollywood. He is a die-hard New England Patriots fan and manages always to find a way to honor his Boston roots.\n\nPatrick Dempsey - Maine\n\nFor many, Patrick Dempsey with always be Dr. Derek \"McDreamy\" Shepherd, but the actor has been around since the '80s...it all started in Maine. Born in Lewiston, Maine, he grew up in the nearby towns of Buckfield and Turner.\n\nAfter high school, he moved to Houston, Texas, and in 1981 placed second at the International Jugglers Association Championship. Despite leaving Maine to pursue his acting career, he has always kept a home base in the state and visits frequently.\n\nJason Momoa - Hawaii\n\nWhen you think of Hawaii, it's hard to believe that people were born and raised there. Especially when it comes to big Hollywood stars, right? Well, it is the home state for many celebrities, including Aquaman himself, Jason Momoa. The actor was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, but after his parents split, he moved to Norwalk, Iowa, where he was raised.\n\nThis didn't stop him from returning to Hawaii after college to reconnect with his father. After being spotted by a modeling agency in 1999, he was named Hawaii's Model of the Year, and the rest is history!\n\nAriana Grande - Florida\n\nBy now, Ariana Grande has made a name for herself as one of the biggest pop stars in the world, though most don't know that she was born and raised in Florida! The singer was born in Boca Raton, Florida, and grew up performing at her local theater.\n\nStarting her career very early on, she left her home state at age 13 to try and pursue fame in Los Angeles. Though it was a risky move, we're all well aware it was one that paid off.\n\nRyan Phillippe - Delaware\n\nThough Ryan Phillippe may be most acknowledged for his roles in the late ’90s and early 2000s, he is still one of the best-looking actors in the business. Phillipe, born in New Castle, is one of the only actors who was born and raised in the state of Delaware.\n\nThe actor's father was a chemist, and his mother ran a local daycare. It wasn't Delaware that kick-started Ryan's career, but another state! Phillippe's acting career began when he was signed to Cathy Parker Management in New Jersey.\n\nMeghan Markle - California\n\nBefore she was the Duchess of Sussex and part of the British royal family, Rachel Meghan Markle was a California princess. The Los Angeles native grew up with ambitions of becoming an actress and landed her role as Rachel Zane in \"Suits.\" This was all before she met and married Prince Harry, of course.\n\nThe list of stars that were born and raised in California is never-ending and includes Tom Hanks, Jennifer Aniston, Cher, Clint Eastwood, and many, many more.\n\nBilly Bob Thornton - Arkansas\n\nAcademy Award-winning actor Billy Bob Thornton’s career has taken him everywhere. The Hollywood star was born in Hot Springs, Arkansas, and his family moved around to many locations within the state when he was a child.\n\nThough they moved around, he was raised mostly in his grandmother's house that had no plumbing or electricity. Interestingly enough, many stars hailed from Arkansas, the big names being Ne-Yo, Bill Clinton, and Johnny Cash.\n\nJewel - Alaska\n\nYes, this may come as somewhat of a surprise, but singer Jewel Kilcher is from the state of Alaska! The four-time Grammy nominee has sold over 30 million albums worldwide, but growing up wasn't as glamorous as her life is now.\n\nJewel's family has been featured on Discovery Channel's \"Alaska: The Last Frontier,\" and they described living miles away from the nearest town. With no running water or heat, they had a coal stove, an outhouse, and caught fish for food.\n\nChanning Tatum - Alabama\n\nChanning Tatum was born in 1980 in Cullman, Alabama. Although his family moved to Mississippi when Tatum was six, he has always considered Alabama his home. He is frequently seen as the most significant Alabama native in Hollywood.\n\nHowever, he has some competition with stars like Lionel Richie, Octavia Spencer, and Courteney Cox, who are also from the state. The \"Magic Mike\" actor often visits Alabama for special events and occasions and has been seen numerous times wearing Alabama \"Roll tide\" gear.\n\nDr. Phil McGraw- Oklahoma\n\nGrowing up, McGraw moved around quite a lot. He was born in Vinita, Oklahoma, in 1950 and, as a child, moved with his family to the oilfields of North Texas, where his father was an equipment supplier. As a teen, McGraw moved to Kansas with his father as his father pursued his lifelong dream of becoming a psychologist.\n\nIt seems like the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, does it? Many may not know this, but Oprah Winfrey helped jump-start Dr. Phil's career as he appeared on her show weekly as a relationship expert in 1998.\n\nDick Van Dyke - Missouri\n\n\"Bye Bye Birdie\" and \"Marry Poppins\" are only some of the classic movies that are synonymous with Dick Van Dyke. Richard Wayne Van Dyke was born in West Plains, Missouri. In 1944, Van Dyke left school with the intent of joining the United States Army Air Forces for pilot training during World War II.\n\nHe was denied enlistment several times but was eventually accepted as a radio announcer, which would then go on to help him jumpstart his career. Though he found success, he never gave up on graduating high school, and at age 78, Van Dyke received his high school diploma in 2004.\n\nRobin Williams - Illinois\n\nThe late Robin McLaurin Williams was a legendary actor and celebrated comedian known for his iconic roles like Genie in Disney's \"Aladdin\" and \"Mrs. Doubtfire.\" It's incredible to know that all that fame started as a stand-up comedian in San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nRobin Williams was born at St. Luke's Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, in 1951. When he turned 16, his father took early retirement, and the family moved to Tiburon, California. After they moved, Robin attended High School in nearby Larkspur. How fitting that he was voted \"Most Likely to Succeed\" and \"Funniest\" by his classmates.\n\nJennifer Connelly - New York\n\nJennifer Connelly started out as a model, doing several T.V. ads, magazine covers, and newspaper pieces. She landed her first significant role in Sergio Leone's 1980 masterpiece film, 'Once Upon a Time in America.'

Connelly was raised primarily in Brooklyn Heights, near the Brooklyn Bridge, where she attended Saint Ann's, a private school specializing in the arts.

After two years at Yale, Connelly transferred to Stanford University in 1990 to study drama.\n\nSylvester Stallone - New York\n\nIf you don't know him from the legendary Rocky series, you will surely remember him from any of the five Rambo films. Both Rocky and Rambo are echoes of Stallone's personal life and the experiences he had during his transition from a poor kid in Hell's Kitchen, New York to one of the world's most popular stars.\n\nAccording to Stallone, he did not have a happy childhood. Michael Sylvester Gardenzio Stallone was born in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan, New York, on July 6, 1946. When he was five, his parents moved their family to Silver Spring, Maryland. At age 15, his parents got divorced, and Stallone moved to Philadelphia to be with his mother and her new husband.\n\nTommy Lee Jones - Texas\n\nTommy Lee Jones is a famous filmmaker and actor who is known as one of the last great actors that can effectively play the strong, silent type.

When she was 19, Oprah first became a part-time radio reporter in Nashville, and also began studying speech and performing arts at Tennessee State University.\n\nKristen Bell - Michigan\n\nFor some actors, success just seems to come naturally. In the case of talented stage and screen beauty Kristen Bell, it wasn't so much a matter of if she was going to be a star after realizing her dream during an early performance as a banana in Raggedy Ann and Andy at the tender age of 12.\n\nKristen Bell grew up in the Detroit suburb of Huntington Woods.

From the early age of four, Rob was already acting; and seven years later, he was a regular on the T.V. series 'A New Kind of Family.' That show was shot down quickly, but Lowe's film career picked up when newspaper and magazine articles began noticing the handsome and sensitive young actor.\n\nRob was born in Charlottesville, Virginia, and grew up in Dayton, Ohio, in a 'traditional American setting.'

He briefly lived in New Zealand before returning to the U.S. to live in Hawaii and Tennessee before eventually settling down in Pennsylvania.\n\nWith his trademark right eyebrow raised, the self-proclaimed \"Most Electrifying Man in Sports-Entertainment\" crashed, smashed, and plowed his way into becoming the youngest Intercontinental Champion in WWF history at the young age of 24.

She attended Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts.\n\nThe first appearance that propelled her to fame was her role as the wholesome preacher's daughter on the W.B. television show 7th Heaven then gained more considerable notoriety when she wanted to get herself kicked off the show, so she posed for a risqué photo spread in the men's magazine Gear.\n\nAshley Graham - Nebraska\n\nAshley Graham may be very successful now, but she had a difficult time growing up and had to work very hard to reach the success she has today. She was born and raised in Lincoln, Nebraska.

There are still some things people don't know about Dolly, but it's her humble beginnings that is the most surprising, as she has reportedly described her family as \"dirt poor.\"\n\nThe singer was initially born in a hard-working Southern family in Sevierville, Tennessee. Dolly is one of 12 children, and coming from a low-income family, they all lived in a tiny one-room cabin.

The rest of the 1980s, he spent carving out a niche for himself as both a solid performer and the lovable protagonist.\n\nJessica Alba - California\n\nAlbe was born in Pomona, California, in 1981 while her father was in the Air Force. When she was still just a baby, the family moved to Biloxi, Mississippi, but nine years later, they eventually moved back to California. It was in California that she was exposed to acting and began embarking on her career as an actress.\n\nGrowing up in Mississippi and then California sure makes for an unusual upbringing. In Mississippi, she probably spent the long summer days outside, doing things like picking berries and climbing trees while in California, Jessica was exposed to a lot more opportunities than Mississippi could offer.\n\nCindy Crawford - Illinois\n\nCindy is considered as one of the world's most beautiful women, and she has appeared just about everywhere that allows advertisements.

She earned an academic scholarship and chose to study chemical engineering at Northwestern University, but eventually, she cleverly agreed that she'd make more money as a model.\n\nKathy Griffin - Illinois\n\nKathy Griffin has been a comedienne for a long time, but she's come a long way since her upbringing in Oak Park, Illinois. Being raised in the Chicago area, it was from the age of five that Griffin reportedly knew she wanted to become an actress and frequently improvised elaborate stage and comedy acts for her family.\n\nIt only seems natural that the fierce Redhead comes from the windy city of Chicago. She lived there until she was 17, where Griffin attended High School, and after graduating, she studied acting at the Lee Strasberg Institute in Southern California.\n\nKirstie Alley - Kansas\n\nNoted for her striking beauty, thick, chestnut-colored hair, and whiskey voice, Alley studied drama in her native Kansas. She then moved to Los Angeles and became an interior decorator. Is there a correlation between famous celebrities coming from Kansas? We're not exactly sure what it is about midwestern States, but Kirstie Allie is yet another renowned actress that comes from such an unassuming place.\n\nAfter dropping out of Kansas State University after her sophomore year, she moved to Hollywood, and almost as soon as she probably surprised herself with her own success! She was consistently funny and undeniably talented, so more quickly enough, her big break came when she starred in the famous sitcom 'Cheers,' and then moved onto film, and sadly since died of cancer at the age 71 in 2022.\n\nMatthew Perry - Massachusetts\n\nThe late Matthew Perry was born in Boston, Massachusetts, after his parents divorced, he moved with his mother as a young boy Perry to Ottawa, Canada.

Shortly after the fateful sporting match, he first appeared on an episode of the sitcom 'Charles in Charge.' As Matthew was still a teenager in high school when he started appearing on screen, it soon became apparent that his education would take a backseat to his acting career.\n\nOlivia Wilde - New York\n\nOlivia Wilde's sleek hair, sultry figure, and haunting blue eyes may have typecasted her in specific roles, but she has proved herself to be so much more. Olivia Wilde may have been born in New York, but she lived in Washington D.C. during her formative years, where she attended private school and went on to attend boarding school at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts.\n\nWilde is incredibly famous, well-known around the world as a beautiful and talented actress, but she isn't the most famous person from her school – that honor belongs to former president George W. Bush. Olivia also comes from a prominent family, with her parents coming from the U.K. Wilde holds dual citizenship with Ireland and the United States.\n\nJennifer Lawrence - Kentucky\n\nJennifer grew up as a tomboy in Louisville, Kentucky, and played sports, including basketball, on an otherwise all-boy team. Since her rapid rise to fame, she has been a busy gal, spending plenty of time acting in the 'Hunger Games' movies, 'Silver Linings Playbook,' and even the long-running 'X-Men' series.\n\nHer upbringing and childhood may have led to success for this famous young actress, with plenty of her roles requiring athleticism, strength, and stamina that she might not have developed if she hadn't been a tomboy. She still goes back to visit her family every now and then between her acting jobs.\n\nAlicia Silverstone - California\n\nDespite being the poster-child for all-American beauty, Alicia was actually born to British parents while they were living in San Francisco, California. Who could probably have guessed that she would become an A-lister and star in movies like 'The Crush,' 'Clueless,' and 'Batman & Robin.'\n\nSilverstone was hailed as the teenage queen of the mid-'90s, with her rapid climb from the hills of Hillsborough, she got her to start when she modeled and eventually, that resulted in her being cast in a television commercial. Alicia did spend a few summers in England, and it was during these visits that she became enthusiastic about theater.\n\nPaul Rudd - New Jersey\n\nThe incredible Ant-man once came all the way from Kansas. With his infectious smile and endearing personality, he has a talent for turning in performances marked by thoughtful insight and an unassuming charisma - it's plain to see how he catapulted into Hollywood. Paul was born in Passaic, New Jersey, but when he was ten years old, Rudd's family moved to Lenexa, Kansas.\n\nDespite coming from a small town in Kansas that most people have never heard of, Paul Rudd is rarely in situations where people don't know who he is. He was raised in Overland Park and went on to attend the University of Kansas since then Paul has enjoyed a kind of low-key fame that has allowed him to branch out many film genres.\n\nMegan Fox - Tennessee\n\nMegan Fox was born in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Her early childhood was spent in nearby Rockwood, Tennessee. But the eye-candy of the 'Transformers' franchise wasn't to be missed, and soon after moving to California, she began acting, eventually starring beside Lindsay Lohan in 'Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen.'\n\nWith her dazzling beauty and poise, she has gone from film to television and back again! If we're completely honest, it's a bit surprising that Megan hails from such a quiet place. Yes, Rockwood is a beautiful place, but is it Megan Fox beautiful? We would expect Megan to greet from a much more exciting place, like California or New York.\n\nMandy Moore - New Hampshire\n\nMandy Moore's genuine vocal talents and innocent public image have propelled her from the recording studio to movie sets. Since the beginning, she has done plenty throughout her years in the acting – not only did she star in 2001's 'The Princess Diaries,' but she also put out a single at the young age of fifteen: \"Candy.\" Since then she's starred in 'A Walk to Remember,' and has a starring role in the show 'This is Us'.\n\nEven though Mandy Moore was born in Nashua, New Hampshire, she and her family eventually moved to Florida, Orlando, when she was two months old.

The village of Merrick is a classic Long Island town of about 23,000 people nestled halfway between Manhattan and the Hamptons. Her hometown of Merrick is not the kind of place we would imagine Lindsay to come from as it's not a place that attracts a lot of drama, so it's clear why the famous Redhead left.\n\nLindsay was destined for stardom as her career began before she even started high school, when she was a child model for famous fashion icons like Calvin Klein and Abercrombie, and also appeared in T.V. adverts for Pizza Hut and Wendy's. Lindsay made the jump to the silver screen in 1998 with 'The Parent Trap,' where she played as twin sisters.\n\nKelly Ripa - New Jersey\n\nKelly Ripa was born and raised in Berlin, New Jersey. Even when she was younger, she has always had an affinity for performance, and when she attended Eastern Regional High School, she became a cheerleader with a winning smile.

She went to University and earned a B.A. in Journalism, and eventually, Olivia Munn moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in acting.\n\nOklahoma is known for its cowboy culture and capitol complex, surrounded by working oil wells, so it interesting that such a glamorous and elegant woman like Olivia Munn grew up there. Olivia went on to become the host of 'Attack of the Show,' which discusses general news, pop culture, and previews movies and shows. She has since leaped films, playing Psylock in 'X-Men: Apocalypse.'\n\nCameron Diaz - California\n\nCameron Diaz first became famous following her performance in 1994's 'The Mask,' alongside Jim Carrey, but it was during her years as a teenager that she was already on her way to stardom when she appeared as a fashion model for big brands such as Levi's and Calvin Klein. Even before all of that, the now-famous blonde was a top cheerleader at Long Beach Polytechnic High School.\n\nCameron Diaz remembered her upbringing in Long Beach, San Diego, as modest, stating: \"I had amazing parents, they were awesome. We weren't made of money—we were very much the opposite. My family would collect cans of soda to turn in for extra money because $20 meant something to us. But we were delighted.\"\n\nSteve Martin - Texas\n\nSteve first appeared in the public eye when he was writing for 'The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour' in the '60s.

She was born to parents Madonna Louise and Silvio Anthony \"Tony\" Ciccone in Bay City, Michigan. Madonna's ties to Michigan has been well documented, especially in her recent book called \"Madonnaland.\"\n\nYes, good or bad, Bay City's reputation precedes it as being a city with a small-town feel, which makes it more surprising that Madonna grew up here. She attended the University of Michigan as a dance student for a brief period before dropping out to move to New York City in 1977.\n\nHalle Berry - Ohio\n\nA native of Cleveland, Ohio, Halle was born to an African-American father and white mother in 1968.

His childhood home was actually on the campus of the Tuskegee Institute as two generations of his family there. It wasn't that long before he met some Tuskegee freshmen who were forming a musical group and approached him because they'd heard he played saxophone. It didn't take long for Lionel to drop out of Tuskegee to pursue his musical dreams as a member of The Commodores.\n\nIt was his upbringing that helped him redefine musical genres and ultimately led to his success as a musical performer. \"Growing up in Tuskegee, Alabama was like a bubble,\" Richie said \"In this bubble, I learned no limitations. My grandmother's a classical pianist.\"\n\nAllison Janney - Massachusetts\n\nAllison is possibly one of the most talented and often underappreciated actresses of the late '90s.

We've all seen her appear in films and T.V. shows over the years, such as 'Juno,' 'The West Wing', and 'I, Tonya.' Allison expressed, \"I am proud to be from Dayton, and I am delighted that I will be forever part of Dayton.\"\n\nAs a product of Dayton, the 58-year-old actress grew up in Oakwood and attended the Miami Valley School, where her father, Jervis Janney said she was active in several theatre productions.

Born in Queens, Lucy grew up speaking Mandarin at home. Lucy has said that she grew up in a diverse neighborhood. She learned to speak Mandarin at home and began studying English when she was 5.\n\nShe was first discovered on the subway. Young Lucy was approached by an agent who wanted to know whether she'd be interested in doing some commercials. Her initial response? No, because, as a born-and-bred New Yorker, she knew better than to talk to someone on the subway, but she did take his business card, and now she has become a household name and arguably the most famous representative of Asian women on U.S. television and film.\n\nSheryl Crow - Missouri\n\nThe 57-year-old musician Sheryl Suzanne Crow doesn't look a day over 40, yet she sure has gone through some significant love life drama over the years. We might be inclined to say that every day of Sheryl Crow's rise to fame has been a winding road. Her professional career started as a school music teacher near St. Louis, but her dreams of glory launched her toward a performing career and eventually landed her on the top of the music charts.\n\nSheryl Suzanne Crow came all the way from the warm and friendly Kennett, Missouri. The boot heel of the state, Kennett, is way down in the southeast corner near Arkansas and Tennessee. Even as a young girl, this Sherly was destined for a career in music, and she soon began performing in bands, and then her big opportunity came when she sang backup vocals for Michael Jackson.\n\nOwen Wilson - Texas\n\nAll Texas is, is basically cowboy hats and cows. How fitting that hell-raiser Owen Wilson hails from the Lone Star State, born and raised in Dallas. For years, Dallas had the official slogan \"Live Large, Think Big.\" But in more recent times, though, the city opted to go with the fresher sounding \"Dallas: Big Things Happen Here.\"\n\nRegardless of how the city wants to present itself to outsiders, we know the real truth about Dallas: The populous city has a long — and, dare we say, pretty impressive — history of big ideas, significant events, and even bigger personalities - like Owen Wilson!

Jennifer oozes charm and which is obviously what she must have picked up while living in the city with small-town charm. Jennifer attended Denison University in Granville, Ohio, where she became interested in drama and went on to graduate with a degree in theater.\n\nIt was after her college years that Garner decided to move to New York, and she began relentlessly auditioning for stage roles, getting her first part only a few weeks after arriving back in 1995 as an understudy in the Broadway production of A Month in the Country.\n\nBrad Pitt - Oklahoma\n\nBrad Pitt was born in Shawnee, Oklahoma.

It was only after he discovered his love of acting that he dropped out of college and moved to Hollywood.\n\nShawnee may be a little city, but at the turn of the 20th century, it was the center of cotton, peach, and potato crops. Who would have thought the actor is famous for his various film roles hails from such a modest and straightforward city.\n\nGabrielle Union - Nebraska\n\nGabrielle is a big fan of the Cornhusker football team, which makes perfect sense seeing as she was born and brought up in Omaha, Nebraska. Gabrielle is the daughter of a social worker and a military sergeant. Gabrielle Union had actually planned on attending law school but began acting instead after the modeling agency she interned with as a college student asked to represent her.\n\nAs a Midwestern gal, Gabrielle's early childhood years were spent as part of a large family that had been in the Omaha area for many generations. She began her career in the 1990s, starring in T.V. sitcoms, before landing supporting roles in teenage comedic films, like 10 Things I Hate About You and She's All That. Her career took off after her role as the sassy cheerleading captain in the surprise hit movie Bring It On.\n\nTaylor Swift - Pennsylvania\n\nWe all know that you can take the girl out of Pennsylvania, but you can't take Pennsylvania out of the girl. Many would think that Taylor is a purely Southern girl, but she was actually born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, and grew up on a Christmas-tree farm. Eventually, Swift and her family relocated to Nashville when she was just 14 years old.\n\nSeeing as Nashville has long been a country music mecca, it was probably this move that enabled Taylor to pursue a country music career. Taylor Swift has one of the most popular stories of a successful Country singer transitioning to a mainstream pop star. The singer has a YouTube channel of over 35 million subscribers and her most popular songs.\n\nJohn Travolta - New Jersey\n\nBorn in New Jersey in 1954, John Joseph Travolta grew up in an Irish-American neighborhood.
