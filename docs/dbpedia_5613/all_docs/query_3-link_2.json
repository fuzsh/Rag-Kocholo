        "text": "VOICE OVER: Rebecca Brayton\n\nScript written by Sean Harris.\n\nWhen it comes to females in films, this millennium has been full of fantastic talent so far! Join http://www.WatchMojo.com as we count down our picks for the top 10 era defining actresses: 21st century edition! For this list, we've looked at actresses that were especially successful and influential within the 21st century so far. To be included, actresses may have had a career before the year 2000, but they must have gained the majority of their fame after the turn of the millennium!\n\nSpecial thanks to our users William Brick, John Nolan, Zef, Rvdxtreme1, amiel1124, joseluis28ful, REfan001, Priscilla Marie Trespalacios, Kirsty Kennedy, Rocky Al., msche80397, Andrew A. Dennison, Cassie Stauffer, Refl, j20w94, cleatus16, Grungeman23 and Emily JoAnn Warden for submitting the idea on our Suggestions Page at WatchMojo.comsuggest\n\nScript written by Sean Harris.\n\n#10: Emma Stone\n\nAfter making her debut in “Superbad,” Emma Stone has proven time and again that she is ‘super-good’! Another comedic outing in “Zombieland” was dead impressive, while her first leading role in “Easy A” also made the grade! As Gwen Stacy in “The Amazing Spider-Man,” she more than lived up to the movie’s title adjective, while a part in 2011’s “The Help” heaped more praise onto her young shoulders! She’s already an era-definer, and she’s got plenty more performances still to give!\n\n#9: Hilary Swank\n\nIn terms of awards, there are not many modern actresses to match Miss Swank! She entered into the century having already secured her first Academy Award for Best Actress with “Boys Don’t Cry,” and she backed that up with another win in 2004 for “Million Dollar Baby.” A film in which she plays a female boxer, Swank has starred in more knockout movies as well! Audiences enjoyed “The Gift,” while “P.S. I Love You” had even the toughest in tears!\n\n#8: Cate Blanchett\n\nNext, a modern great who won her first Oscar by portraying a historic great! Cate Blanchett’s Katharine Hepburn in “The Aviator” scooped the Best Supporting Actress Award! She won her second statuette in 2013 for her lead role in “Blue Jasmine,” making her the only Australian to win two Oscars, and one of only six people to have won a supporting and lead actress award... In among all of that, she’s starred as Galadriel in “The Lord of the Rings” and as Bob Dylan in “I’m Not There.” She’s busy, and brilliant!\n\n#7: Scarlett Johansson\n\nHollywood likes to have its ‘darling’ figure, and for much of the 21st century that title might be given to Scarlett Johansson! The actress has about her a simple elegance that has earned her many a ‘sexiest woman’ award, but she is way more than an exceptionally pretty face! Leading roles in movies such as “Girl With a Pearl Earring,” “Lost in Translation” and “Vicky Cristina Barcelona” have placed her at the pinnacle of movie stardom! Scarlett’s as talented as she is attractive - and she’s very, very attractive!\n\n#6: Natalie Portman\n\nFrom one exceptionally elegant actress to another! Natalie Portman has been nailing first-class performance after first-class performance for as long as we can remember! Mainstream success first came her way when she starred in the “Star Wars” prequel trilogy between 1999 and 2005, while critical acclaim has been awarded her following roles in “Closer” and “V for Vendetta.” Her biggest success came with “Black Swan,” however. A hauntingly, beautifully brilliant look at the world of ballet, it’s Portman at her most pristine!\n\n#5: Amy Adams\n\nIn terms of being the supporting actress, this girl is the main event! Amy Adams has been nominated for the Best Supporting Actress Oscar four times within the space of seven 21st century years. She isn’t always just off center-stage however, as she also picked up a nomination for lead actress in 2013 after she appeared in “American Hustle”! “The Fighter,” “The Master,” “Enchanted” and “Man of Steel.”.. The roles this woman takes are varied – and the performances she gives are always world class!\n\n#4: Jennifer Lawrence\n\nIn terms of the entries on this list, Jennifer Lawrence’s career began a little later within our era - but in the short time that she has been on our screens, Lawrence has lapped up all manner of praise. And deservedly so! Debuting in 2008 with “Garden Party,” she has since starred in “X-Men: First Class,” “Silver Linings Playbook” and “American Hustle.” She’s also the face of massive franchise success with “The Hunger Games” movies. Oh, and she also has an Oscar, a BAFTA and two Golden Globes... Already! J-Law can really act!\n\n#3: Angelina Jolie\n\nOur third-placer is one of the most famous women on the planet! Married to Hollywood heartthrob Brad Pitt and well known for her humanitarian efforts, Jolie didn’t get to where she is today through good looks alone (although her ‘looks’ are especially good)! The brunette beauty has starred in plenty of prize winners, including 1999’s “Girl, Interrupted” for which she won an Oscar. Since then, roles as Lara Croft, Mrs. Smith and Maleficent - among many others - have garnered her in glory, and gotten her admirers. Lots and lots of admirers...\n\n#2: Kate Winslet\n\nWhen she asked Leonardo DiCaprio to ‘draw her like one of his French girls’, not even Kate Winslet herself could’ve predicted the Titanic scale of success she’d go on to achieve! With “Little Children,” she became the youngest actress to achieve five Academy Award nominations, and with “The Reader” she became the youngest to receive six! Commercial success has run parallel to critical acclaim for Winslet, with “Flushed Away,” “The Holiday” and “Divergent” all dominating the box office! She’s the best of the British actresses and has been for some time!\n\nBefore we unveil our top pick, here are a few honorable mentions.\n\n- Reese Witherspoon\n\n- Anne Hathaway\n\n- Charlize Theron\n\n- Jessica Chastain\n\n- Julianne Moore\n\n- Zoe Saldana\n\n#1: Sandra Bullock\n\nOur winner was making movies long before the beginning of this century, but she just seems to have gotten even better with age! Sandra Bullock began the millennium with “Miss Congeniality,” before taking up a role in “Crash.” Next came “The Blind Side” for which she won an Oscar, then a switch to comedy for “The Heat,” then back to blockbusters for the Oscar-winning “Gravity.” Ironically, she’s managed to keep her feet on the ground despite an ever-increasing profile... Our modest medal winner, Bullock is the best of a brilliant bunch!\n\nDo you agree with our list? Which actress from the 21st century so far is your favorite?
