        "text": "We usually love transporting ourselves out of the real world and getting lost in the world of make-believe, whether it be the latest Marvel movie, a young adult romance or a fun comedy.\n\nBut sometimes there's nothing better than a movie based on a true story, and we honestly don't blame Hollywood for turning to the world's population for their real tales of determination, survival, romance, crime and much more. Knowing that some of our favourite movies are centred on the lives of real people leaves us with an array of emotions at the end of a film. Sometimes that is one of inspiration, sometimes of pure disgust. Other times it's simply a heartwarming story that mirrors small elements from our lives, making our time on the sofa with a bowl of popcorn an insight into our self-discovery.\n\nIt's incredible to think that some of these stories, which once may have seemed minuscule and forgotten while being lived, have been brought to the big screen and given the award-season touch. Examples include Lion, one man's journey to find his biological family in India years after they were separated. Honestly, we wept at this movie which reinforced the message that family is everything. We also loved the empowering self-discovery of Cheryl Strayed (played by Reese Witherspoon) in Wild as she hiked America's famous long-distance hiking trail, the Pacific Crest Trail. All the feels.\n\nThere was also the Julia Roberts starring film Erin Brockovich that inspired us to do good and have the best interest of everyone around us in the face of large corporations. It was also interesting to follow the journey of disgraced figure skater Tonya Harding in I, Tonya, starring Margot Robbie, as well as the lives of the real-life teen burglars who robbed A-listers in the movie The Bling Ring. Health battles are also central to films such as The Big Sick and Brain on Fire. These movies definitely make us cling to our nearest and dearest...\n\nSo, if you're looking for some true life inspiration, why not pick a film from the following list of 23, as chosen by GLAMOUR?"
