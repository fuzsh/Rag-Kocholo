        "text": "In her new movie, Mirror Mirror, an inventive reworking of the Snow White story, Julia Roberts plays the Evil Queen, pursued by advancing age, losing her looks and uncertain if anyone still likes her. Oddly, a number of reviewers have wondered what it was that attracted Ms Roberts to the part.\n\nHere, the Grimm Brothers’ core themes of jealousy, power and usurpation have a particular smack of relevance. In a few weeks, a rival version of the same fairytale – Snow White and the Huntsman – starring Charlize Theron as the Queen, will reach the cinema circuit. Hollywood hasn’t been so excited over a face-off since Mission to Mars went up against The Red Planet.\n\nThere’s no doubt Ms Roberts has the most to lose. At 44, she is past the age when any actress’s stardom can be sustained by glamour or past box-office returns. What beckons is the cruel world of character parts and cameos – or, as Kathleen Turner put it: “The discovery of whether anyone thinks you can act or not.” Ms Roberts, although comfortably the highest-paid female star in movie history, hasn’t had a great run in recent years, and there are worrying signs that the studios are no longer sure what to do with her.\n\nHer take on Snow White also takes some ripe liberties with the story. The Queen taxes her subjects to the brink of starvation in order to pay for expensive beauty treatments, which she hopes will persuade the handsome – and loaded – Prince Alcott to fall in love with her. Instead, the Prince falls for the imprisoned Snow White (played by Lily Collins, daughter of rock star Phil) who suffers the Queen’s cruel vengeance, but is rescued by the Seven Dwarves who teach ''Snow’’ (this being a first-name fairyland) deadly martial arts techniques and help her win back the kingdom.\n\nIt is tempting to conclude – as some have – that Julia is spiritedly sending herself and Hollywood up, and that within the loopiness of this refashioned fable are some pertinent comments on the movie business’s, and, for that matter, the world’s fixation with youth and beauty. Ms Roberts’s lines bristle with bittersweet jibes about vanishing looks and the unfair competition posed to older women by newer, prettier rivals: “Blah, blah, blah…” scoffs the Queen, “her hair isn’t black, it’s raven, and she’s 18 years old, and her skin has never seen the sun, so of course it’s good.”\n\nYet the notion of Julia raging against the passing years is hard to square with her view that the last thing she would like is to be starting out in the business again. If things were tough for young actresses back then, she suggests, today they are far worse. “What’s new is that we live in a culture of meanness,” she recently told Vanity Fair. “My experience of fame, 25 years ago, was a gradual progression. These days it’s catapulting. There’s the express elevator and there’s rehab, and one leads to the other.”\n\nThe Hollywood she landed in as a teenage unknown had its faults, but it knew how to spot and develop talent. “I was encouraged – as all young actresses are – you know, 'You’ve got to keep going; you’ve got to get out there’. It’s too bad that young actors coming up now will never get that kind of experience. The business is so different; you can never be that new girl that has that moment of 'Where’d she come from?’ Those gradual steps that you get to take.”\n\nIn a sense, a starring role in one fairytale movie is an appropriate place for Ms Roberts to look back at a career that took off with another. In the late Eighties, a rough screenplay of a tragi-comic entanglement between a businessman and a prostitute was being shopped around Hollywood with the working title “3000”. There was talk of casting Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer, but both hesitated to sign. After several re-jigs, plot revisions and rejections, the parts went to an out-of-vogue Richard Gere and a virtually unknown Ms Roberts. Renamed Pretty Woman and packaged as a modern version of Cinderella, the film became a global sensation. The fairy story ending in real life was that it grossed $464 million. And it turned Julia Fiona Roberts into the biggest female movie star of the age.\n\nShe was born in Atlanta, Georgia, to actor parents who ran a theatrical school and writing workshop. Julia, having first thought of training to be a vet, soon succumbed to the lure of the stage. In her late teens she moved to New York, where she worked as a model and took acting lessons and, in 1988, landed a part in Satisfaction, a feelgood movie about all-girl pop group. The following year she won praise – and an Oscar nomination – for her role as a young bride stricken with diabetes in Steel Magnolias.\n\nPretty Woman brought out in her the rare ability to be two characters in the same role. As Vivian, the Beverly Hills hooker, she oozed both carnality and innocence, and the lines were made for her: “Look, I appreciate this whole seduction thing you’ve got going on here,” she tells Gere, “but let me give you a tip. I’m a sure thing.”\n\nHollywood soon knew she was exactly that. It was in the smile, the eyes, the all-American wholesomeness and the faint hint of menace. Not that things were so sure off the set. A series of much-chronicled romances followed, including engagements to actors Dylan McDermott and Kiefer Sutherland, and a short-lived marriage to country singer Lyle Lovett. Steven Spielberg, one of the few directors who has failed to appreciate her efforts, suggested that her history of unsuccessful relationships had left her with “mental issues”."
