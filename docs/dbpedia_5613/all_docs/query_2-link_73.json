        "text": "01 of 32\n\nGrowing Up Sally Field\n\nBorn and raised in Pasadena, California, Sally Field attended Birmingham High School in Van Nuys. She graduated in 1964, but not before she was elected homecoming princess during her senior year.\n\nField returned to her alma mater in 2010, when they named their performing arts center in her honor. At the unveiling of a new sign bearing her name, the actress praised her school's drama department, noting that it \"quite simply saved my life\" in that she could \"most truly and absolutely\" be herself while involved.\n\n02 of 32\n\n'Gidget' and Other Early Laughs\n\nAt just 17 years old, Field nabbed the lead role in the sitcom Gidget. She starred as the titular boy-obsessed surfer girl alongside Don Porter, who played her widowed dad. She followed her first TV comedy lead with more: Field played Sister Bertrille in The Flying Nun from 1967 to 1970, and she went on to portray Sally Burton in NBC's The Girl with Something Extra for a single season in 1973.\n\nAs her career progressed in the sitcom genre, Field hoped to break out of television, though she previously said this was met with backlash and rejection. Speaking at the 2015 Simmons Leadership Conference in Boston, the actress recalled her agent saying she wasn't \"good enough\" or \"pretty enough\" to be in films. \"And I said, 'You're fired,' \" she added.\n\n03 of 32\n\nStarting a Family\n\nField married her first husband, Steven Craig, in 1968. They welcomed two sons, Peter and Eli, before separating in 1973.\n\n04 of 32\n\nGrowing Her Home\n\nField and Craig welcomed their firstborn, Peter, in 1969, while she was working on The Flying Nun. In tandem with her early experiences on a set and working with a crew, she was also experiencing the beginning of motherhood. \"My life was happening beside itself,\" she remembered in a 2016 conversation with Jess Cagle. \"My focus was on what was happening inside of me.\"\n\nPeter accompanied his mother to the 8th Annual People's Choice Awards in 1982, when she won for her starring role in Absence of Malice.\n\n05 of 32\n\nAdding Another\n\nIn 1972, Field became a mother of two with the arrival of her son Eli Craig (pictured here with Mom in 2002).\n\n06 of 32\n\nMajor Acclaim\n\nThe young actress won her first Emmy Award for her leading role in the 1976 TV film Sybil. Field shattered any doubts of her dramatic capabilities in her performance as a young girl suffering from what was then called multiple personality syndrome (now known as dissociative identity disorder). Joanne Woodward played the psychiatrist treating Field's character's condition.\n\n07 of 32\n\nMovie-Making Memories\n\nOne of Field's earliest major movie roles saw her starring alongside Jeff Bridges and Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 1976 comedy Stay Hungry. The film featured Field in the role of Mary Tate, the love interest of Bridges' character and receptionist at the gym frequented by the body builder portrayed by Schwarzenegger.\n\n08 of 32\n\nFalling for Burt Reynolds\n\nOn the set of their film Smokey and the Bandit, Field and her costar Burt Reynolds lit a romantic flame that burned long after the production wrapped in 1977, lasting even after they finished the sequel, Smokey and the Bandit II, in 1980.\n\nThe two broke it off after three years of consistent dating and two years on-and-off, as Field has since clarified. But according to Reynolds, who died in 2018, the Norma Rae star always held a special place in his heart. In a 2015 interview with Vanity Fair, he called her \"the love of my life\" and opened up about the heartache he still felt.\n\n\"Even now, it's hard on me. I don't know why I was so stupid,\" he told the magazine. \"Men are like that, you know. You find the perfect person, and then you do everything you can to screw it up.\"\n\n09 of 32\n\nLongtime Love\n\nThroughout their five-year relationship, Reynolds and Field worked together on several films after Smokey and the Bandit. In 1977, they costarred in Heroes; the following year, they shared the screen in both The End and Hooper.\n\nAfter Reynolds' death, Field spoke to Diane Sawyer about her lasting impressions of the star and their time together.\n\n\"We were sort of, you know, deeply entangled,\" she said in 2018. \"That nature of it wasn't just, 'Oh, this is a love affair.' There was some ingredient between us having to do with my caretaking and him needing to be taken care of.\"\n\nField also admitted that she didn't have much contact with her former boyfriend in the 30 years leading up to his death: \"I would feel him kind of reach out to me via the press. It was something he would do even when we were dating. He would speak to me about things he could call me on the phone about.\"\n\n10 of 32\n\nSnagging Gold Statues\n\nField gained next-level acclaim for her starring performance in Norma Rae. She took home an array of awards, most notably her very first Oscar. She also won the Cannes award, accolades from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association and National Society of Film Critics and her first Golden Globe.\n\n11 of 32\n\nInto the '80s\n\nWith her film career fully blossomed, the actress starred in several major features throughout the 1980s. Field acted alongside Paul Newman in Absence of Malice in 1981, and in 1982 she once again played Jeff Bridges' love interest in Kiss Me Goodbye. She appeared in Murphy's Romance and, as the decade wrapped up, the 1989 classic Steel Magnolias, with Shirley MacLaine, Olympia Dukakis, Dolly Parton, Daryl Hannah and a young Julia Roberts.\n\n12 of 32\n\nAnother Big Win\n\nField won a second Oscar for her leading performance in 1985's Place in the Heart. Her acceptance speech for the Best Actress accolade went on to be famously misquoted throughout her career.\n\nWhile many believed Field exclaimed, \"You like me! You really like me!\" the actress actually shared some details about her journey to stardom. Her real words were, \"I haven't had an orthodox career, and I've wanted more than anything to have your respect. The first time I didn't feel it, but this time I feel it. And I can't deny the fact that you like me. Right now, you like me!\"\n\n13 of 32\n\nAnother Knot Tied\n\nAlan Greisman and Field wed in 1984 and split 10 years later.

Her former Amazing Spider-Man castmate Andrew Garfield introduced the trailblazing star with heartfelt praise, citing not only his experience working with her but other stars' accounts, as well.\n\n\"You're a North Star for all of us, especially, of course, in inspiring, liberating and empowering women, charting a previously pathless path in an era of often unimaginative and one-dimensional female roles,\" said the actor, who played Field's superhero nephew in the Marvel movie.\n\nGarfield added that Jane Fonda called the night's honoree \"the epitome of greatness,\" and he said that Julia Roberts, Field's former Steel Magnolias costar, called her \"a unicorn. That rare type of person who can be a mentor and a best friend all at the same time.\"\n\nAs Field accepted the milestone accolade on stage, she reflected on her journey to becoming a Hollywood icon and the obstacles she ran into along the way.\n\n\"Acting to me has always been about finding those few precious moments when I feel totally, utterly, sometimes dangerously alive. So the task has always been to find a way to get to that. To get to the work, to claw my way to it, if necessary,\" Field recalled.\n\nShe looked back on her various roles in productions across genres, reflecting on the \"fierceness\" with which she fought to break out of sitcoms in the '60s and '70s. Then, as she wrapped up her speech, Field celebrated her fellow actors who fought their own uphill battles for seats at the table.\n\n\"When I look around this room tonight, I know my fight — as hard as it was — was lightweight compared to some of yours. I thank you and I applaud you,\" the actress said in her concluding remarks. \"And I know that for you, just like for me, it has not been easy. But you know what? Easy is overrated.\""
