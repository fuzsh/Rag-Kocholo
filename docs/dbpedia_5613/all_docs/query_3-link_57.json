        "text": "It's a weird fact of writing for BuzzFeed that you know lots of random trivia about movies and TV! One thing that never fails to intrigue me is finding out which actors were up for the same role.\n\nThis got me thinking, when it comes to iconic roles, who else was in the room and being considered before the people we know and love bagged the part? Let's take a look at some of the biggest actor showdowns of all time...\n\n1. Starting with, unsurprisingly, Christian Bale vs. Leonardo DiCaprio – Titanic and American Psycho\n\nLeo would go on to be nominated for Golden Globe and Satellite Awards for his portrayal of Jack Dawson, and a mere three years later, Christian would become a household name for his performance as Patrick Bateman in American Psycho.\n\n2. Jake Gyllenhaal vs. Tobey Maguire – Spider-Man 2\n\nInstead of wait it out, Columbia Pictures decided they were going to move on without Tobey, and made an offer to Jake Gyllenhaal.\n\n3. Maya Rudolph vs. Mindy Kaling – Bridesmaids\n\nMaya was offered her role without having to audition, and was pregnant when filming began!\n\n4. Charlize Theron vs. Renée Zellweger – Chicago\n\nThe director in question was Rob Marshall, who seemingly doubted Charlize's star power at the time and decided to go with a more established star in Renée.\n\n5. Ryan Gosling vs. Miles Teller – La La Land\n\nSpeaking to Esquire, Miles said \"I got a call from my agent, saying, 'Hey, I just got a call from Lionsgate. Damien told them that he no longer thinks you're creatively right for the project. He's moving on without you'\".\n\n6. Rachel McAdams vs. Anne Hathaway – The Devil Wears Prada\n\n7. Julia Roberts vs. Nicole Kidman – Notting Hill\n\nInterestingly, Julia Roberts almost passed on the role, telling Vanity Fair that she thought the movie was \"boring\", \"tedious\", and \"stupid\".\n\n8. Taron Egerton vs. John Boyega – Kingsman: The Secret Service\n\nDirector Matthew Vaughan decided to open the search to find acting newcomers for the lead role in the film.\n\n9. And finally, Jennifer Lawrence vs. Emma Stone – Easy A\n\nHere's a clip from that interview:\n\nIt's always fascinating to think about what could've been if different casting choices had been made. Which actor showdowns surprised you the most? Let us know in the comments!\n\nShare This Article"
