        "text": "Script written by Tiffany Ezuma\n\n#10: Keira Knightley\n\nTypecast as: Feisty, Period Piece Heroine\n\nThere must be something about Keira Knightley’s face that makes directors want to put her back in time, and often in a corset. But no matter what past era they send her back to, she frequently plays a woman that isn’t typical to her period, and she’s often a rebel willing to fight and speak her mind, especially when she’s not supposed to. Her characters also manage to be so full of pluck and spunk, despite being constrained by a floor-length ball gown and hoop skirt.\n\n#9: Sandra Bullock\n\nTypecast as: Down-to-Earth Protagonist\n\nShe’s appeared in so many movies that’ve just screamed, “I’m just like you!” Sandy often plays that woman who’s sexy but doesn’t know it, is zany but sensible, and also stern but warm and friendly. Bullock is a wonderful physical actor, but sometimes it’s a little bit too much, and she’s been in some serious duds. Fortunately, Sandra is aware that she’s got range; after all, she won an Oscar for “The Blind Side” and was later nominated for her work in “Gravity” – in which she was anything but down-to-Earth.\n\n#8: Angelina Jolie\n\nTypecast as: Tough Sexpot\n\nJolie seems to be the only woman that Hollywood can rely on to be both tough and sexy. Whether she’s the villain or the hero, she’s always someone you expect to not to cry or show any signs of weakness but somehow she’s a man magnet. She’s often smarter than everyone around her and a physical machine, and she’ll save the world in crop top or dress with a thigh-high slit.\n\n#7: Julia Roberts\n\nTypecast as: Strong-Willed Woman Who Breaks Down\n\n“Beautiful woman with hard exterior” seems to be the most accurate description of the majority of Julia Roberts’ roles. Ever since her turn in “Pretty Woman,” she’s been playing a tough cookie who needs someone, most times a love interest, to call her out and make her feel something. Even when it’s not in the context of a rom-com, like in “Erin Brokovich,” she’s still depicting a no-nonsense woman with a heart of gold. We all know that, by the end of the movie, she’ll also be guffawing and cracking her trademark grin.\n\n#6: Cameron Diaz\n\nTypecast as: Sweet, Funny Babe\n\nWe get it. Cameron is “one of the guys.” In almost every role she’s played, her characters are ridiculously funny women who like going to baseball games and drinking beer. But at the same time, she’ll always look insanely hot and wear thigh-high dresses. Diaz’ll play this character on either end of the spectrum, coming off as either naïve about her looks or using them to get what she wants. But in either incarnation, she’s a guy’s girl through and through.\n\n#5: Helena Bonham Carter\n\nTypecast as: Weird Woman\n\nEarlier in her career, Helena Bonham Carter was often cast as romantic heroines in movies set in the early 20th century or even earlier, like “Lady Jane.” However, around the time she started dating director Tim Burton, he began casting her as the eccentric lady in many of his films. Now, we’re more likely to recognize her with her curly hair askew, babbling incoherently, and in all black attire. Even when she’s not working with Burton, she’s cast in this type of role and this is most notably seen in the “Harry Potter” films.\n\n#4: Meg Ryan\n\nTypecast as: Romantic Comedy Queen\n\nYoung Meg probably didn’t know that every romantic comedy she starred in was going to be a giant success. But thanks to the success of now iconic movies like “When Harry Met Sally,” Meg Ryan came to be the woman you could count on to make viewers care about whether her characters found love or not. She’s the queen of making sympathetic faces that have made both the men in her movies, and audiences who watch them, fall in love with her. Yep, she’ll always be America’s Sweetheart.\n\n#3: Jennifer Aniston\n\nTypecast as: Star of Bland Rom-Coms\n\nShe’s done a little better for herself with recent roles in raunchier comedies, but the bulk of Jennifer Aniston’s roles have been in arguably bland romantic comedies. Often, the movies she’s appeared in are the kind where viewers can’t distinguish one plot from another. Aniston seems to typecast to play a single woman of a certain age that can’t find the right guy - even though she so clearly deserves one. It’s all been a little too similar to the persona the tabloids created for her, so it’s good she’s branching out.\n\n#2: Drew Barrymore\n\nTypecast as: Wholesome Girl-Next-Door\n\nHollywood has been telling us forever that Drew Barrymore is the slightly weird, girl-next-door. Her roles commonly have her portraying that girl who’s really a diamond in the rough, and just needs a willing man to see her true potential. However, she usually has one unfortunate quality, like a bad haircut, that keeps her from being desirable. And more often that not, Adam Sandler seems to be that very guy willing to save her – in fact, the two actors have played the similar characters together in three rom-coms.\n\nBefore we unveil our number one pick, here are a few honorable mentions:\n\n- Zooey Deschanel\n\nTypecast as: The Quirky Girl\n\n- Reese Witherspoon\n\nTypecast as: The Rom-Com Sweetheart\n\n- Jodie Foster\n\nTypecast as: The Woman You Don’t Mess With\n\n- Katherine Heigl\n\nTypecast as: The Uptight Workaholic\n\n- Joan Cusack\n\nTypecast as: The Peculiar Confidante\n\n#1: Michelle Rodriguez\n\nTypecast as: Badass Chick\n\nNeed a woman that looks like she can kick ass? Call Michelle! Rodriguez portrays characters that resemble each other so frequently that it’s gotten people thinking she’s actually just playing thinly veiled versions of herself. Her roles commonly have her depicting a woman in traditionally male- dominated jobs like being a soldier, fighter, cop or mechanic. Further enforcing her tough chick image, we’ll often see her in a tank top that shows off her impressive arms, and will sport a “don’t mess with me” expression on her face. She’s good at what she does, but a little range wouldn’t hurt.\n\nDo you agree with our list? Which actress do you think plays the same parts all the time?
