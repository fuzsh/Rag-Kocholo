Next, she attended the Juilliard School for four years,[13][14] and was a member of the school's Drama Division \"Group 22\" (1989–93).[23]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly work and breakthrough on stage (1992–1999)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1992, Davis starred in her first professional stage role, an off Broadway production of William Shakespeare's comedy As You Like It as Denis alongside Elizabeth McGovern at the Delacorte Theatre. In 1996, Davis made her Broadway debut in the original Broadway production of August Wilson's Seven Guitars as the Vera, alongside Keith David. The play opened on Broadway on March 6 at the Walter Kerr Theatre. She earned critical praise for her performance.[24][25] That same year, Davis received her Screen Actors Guild card in 1996 for doing one day of work, playing a nurse who passes a vial of blood to future How to Get Away with Murder co-star Timothy Hutton in the film The Substance of Fire (1996). She was paid $518.[26] Davis continued acting off Broadway in various productions, and appeared in bit parts on television including episodes of NYPD Blue (1996), and New York Undercover (1996).

She also played secondary roles in Todd Haynes' costume drama Far From Heaven (2002), starring Julianne Moore and Dennis Quaid. Her television work includes a recurring role in Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,[29] starring roles in two short-lived series, Traveler and Century City,[30] and a special guest appearance in a Law & Order: Criminal Intent episode entitled \"Badge\".[31]\n\nIn 2005 and 2006, Davis began a recurring role opposite Tom Selleck in a series of films made for television based on novels by Robert B.

Though Davis had only a few scenes in the film, she remained a highlight of the film with noted film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times specifically praising her performance writing, \"It lasts about 10 minutes, but it is the emotional heart and soul of Doubt, and if Viola Davis isn't nominated by the Academy, an injustice will have been done.\" Ebert would further go on to write, \"She goes face to face with the pre-eminent film actress of this generation, and it is a confrontation of two equals that generates terrifying power.\"[32][33] She was nominated for several awards for her performance, including a Screen Actors Guild Award, a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.[34]\n\nOn June 30, 2009, Davis was inducted into the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[35]\n\nIn 2010, Davis returned to Broadway in her third August Wilson play, this time a revival of Fences as Rose Maxson, acting alongside Denzel Washington. Her performance received raves from critics in particular theatre critic Ben Brantley of The New York Times who described Davis' performance as \"extraordinary\", adding \"Ms. Davis, who won a Tony for her performance in Wilson's King Hedley II, may well pick up another for her work here. Her face is a poignant paradox, both bone-tired and suffused with sensual radiance.\"[36] On June 13, 2010, Davis won her second Tony Award for her performance.[37] She was the second African-American to win the Tony for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play, after Phylicia Rashad.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2010 Davis had small roles in the romantic comedy thriller Knight and Day starring Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz and the romantic comedy Eat Pray Love starring Julia Roberts.

I channeled the spirit of my grandmother, and I've kind of paid homage to how they've contributed to my life and the lives of so many people\".[39] She has since expressed deep regret over taking on the role; although she still admires the people she worked with, she does not think the story or portrayal is truthful about the lives of the black characters.[40] Davis gained praise for her work and eventually won two Screen Actors Guild Awards, in addition to receiving her second Academy Award nomination,[41][42][43] as well as Golden Globe Award and BAFTA Award nominations.[44][45]\n\nIn 2012, Time magazine listed Davis as one of the most influential people in the world.[46] Also in 2012, Glamour magazine named Davis Glamour's Film Actress of the year.[47] On June 12, 2012, Davis received the Women in Film's Crystal Award.[48] In 2014, Davis reunited with The Help director Tate Taylor in Get on Up, a biopic of James Brown, playing Brown's mother.[49] Her daughter, Genesis, also appeared in the film.[50]\n\nIn February 2014, Davis was cast in Peter Nowalk's pilot How to Get Away with Murder (executive produced by Shonda Rhimes for her ShondaLand production company) as the lead character.[51] Her character, Annalise Keating, is a tough criminal defense attorney and professor who becomes entangled in murder plot with her students.[52][53][54] It began as a series in September 2014.[55] In September 2015, Davis became the first African-American to win the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for her role on How to Get Away with Murder.[56][57] She received a second Primetime Emmy Award nomination for the role in 2016.[58] Davis also won two Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series in 2014 and 2015.[59] She received nominations from the Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress – Television Series Drama and Critics' Choice Award for Best Actress in a Drama Series for her performance on the show.[60]\n\nIn 2015, Davis appeared in Blackhat, a Michael Mann-directed thriller film starring Chris Hemsworth.[61] Davis also served as executive-producer of the crime drama film Lila & Eve, starring herself and Jennifer Lopez in the titular roles.[62] In 2016, Davis starred in the courtroom drama Custody, on which she also served as an executive producer,[63] and played Amanda Waller in the film Suicide Squad, an adaptation of a DC Comics series of the same name.[64]\n\nIn 2016, Davis reprised her role as Rose Maxson for the film adaptation of Fences directed by and starring Denzel Washington.

But her importance in the culture – her ability to identify it, her willingness to speak about it and take on responsibility for it – is what marks her for greatness.\"[70] In March 2017, Davis was awarded the Artist of the Year Award at Harvard University.[71]\n\nAlso in 2017, Davis announced that she would write the sequel to the classic picture book Corduroy, titled Corduroy Takes a Bow.

I was one of those kids, because I grew up in abject poverty; I did everything that you could possibly imagine to get food: I rummaged in the garbage cans, I stole from the local store constantly.\"[107] As an honoree at the 2014 Variety Power of Women luncheon, Davis further commented that \"the thing that made me join...was the word 'eradicate', 'get rid of' – not by thirty-percent not by twenty-percent not by fifty-percent, but to do away [with it]. Because everyone should be a child, and should grow up and have a chance at the American dream\".[108] In September 2017, Davis started the $30K in 30 Days Project with Hunger Is, awarding a $1,000 grant to the Rhode Island Community food bank in her home state.[106]\n\nAs part of her partnership with Vaseline to promote the Vaseline Healing Project, Davis attended the groundbreaking of a free community health center in Central Falls, Rhode Island in October 2016 that was sponsored by the project.[104] The project provides dermatological care to help heal the skin of those affected by poverty around the world.[109][110][111] She was also a speaker at the 2018 Women's March event in Los Angeles.[112]\n\nOn New Year's Eve 2020, Davis urged Georgia voters who voted via mail or dropbox to track their ballots to ensure their votes count, directing them to VoteRiders for information and help to cure ballots that were not accepted.[113]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nDavis married actor Julius Tennon in June 2003.[114] In 2011, the couple adopted an infant daughter named Genesis.
