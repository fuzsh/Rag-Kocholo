A comment about seeing a former girlfriend named Pandora and her \"box.\" The two leads are seen postcoital, but not naked. Lead character's flatmate wears sexually suggestive T-shirts. This same flatmate poses outside the flat for paparazzi while wearing nothing but his briefs, then goes back inside, posing in a mirror while grabbing his crotch. The lead female character discovers that there's a sex tape of her that has surfaced and is now the talk of the tabloids. A group of men in a restaurant are overheard talking about celebrities they would like to have sex with; they speak of them in a sexist and objectifying manner. Talk of male fantasies concerning female celebrities.\n\nDid you know you can flag iffy content? Adjust limits for Sex, Romance & Nudity in your kid's entertainment guide.\n\nGet started\n\nParents need to know that Notting Hill is a 1999 romantic comedy starring Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant. There's some profanity, including \"f--k,\" as well as off-color one-liners of a sexual nature and men overheard speaking about having sex with celebrities in a sexist and objectifying manner. William's flatmate makes crude remarks and wears lewd T-shirts. A good deal of alcohol is consumed at parties. There are comments about breasts, men leering at breasts, questions about sleeping with someone, and jokes about masturbating. Also, a comment about seeing old friend Pandora's \"box.\" The two leads are seen postcoital, but not naked. Lead female character, an A-list actress, learns of a sex tape of her that has surfaced and is now fodder for the tabloids. While it's a predictable enough, if wittier than average, romcom, a recurring theme is a questioning of our celebrity-obsessed culture and the way celebrities are perceived as both worthy of being placed on a pedestal but also easily knocked down for the sheer spectacle of it. A character who is confined to a wheelchair due to an unfortunate accident isn't portrayed as a lamentable victim worthy of pity, but as a dry-humored, three-dimensional character like other characters.
