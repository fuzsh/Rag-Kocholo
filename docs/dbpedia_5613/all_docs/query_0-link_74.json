        "text": "Sighting: Julia Roberts, in the East Village’s trendy Bowlmor Lanes, canoodling with a young man who looks nothing like the leggy stunner’s current dish, hunky TV stud Benjamin Bratt …\n\nThe story begins, as all Julia Roberts stories must begin, with a smattering of lies based on half-truths signifying nothing. Consider the item, which happens to be factually sound—Roberts was in the bowling alley, was with a man other than her boyfriend, and was, to use the tabloid term of art, canoodling. That the definition for “canoodling” is arcane and exquisitely vague merely proves the point, since canoodling means, in essence, whatever you want it to mean. That’s what makes it such a useful word in moments like this, when the world’s most famous actress is standing in Lane 23, cupping her breasts.\n\nA disclaimer: she is doing this for illustrative purposes only—something about how, using a little tape and a lot of ingenuity, she conceals her chest while filming nude scenes (which she films rarely, but that’s another story). She is simply being helpful; she is a helpful person. For example, it was her idea to come here in the first place, because she feared that she’d been “boring” during an earlier meeting. She bowls early and often, perhaps with a certain level of irony. Usually she is accompanied by her boyfriend, but not this time.\n\nShe is, if not an accomplished bowler, a spirited one. She spends much of the afternoon howling with joy, jumping up and down, and tugging the arm of her bowling companion. (You read it here first: Julia Roberts is a toucher.) She is wearing Levi’s, a snug blue top, and rented shoes. Her hair is pulled back, her face creaseless. She curses a blue streak. In other words, she’s the consummate bowling date—America’s date. “Loosen up, honey,” she keeps saying. “You’re bowling like you’ve got a gun at your back.”\n\nAn hour later, the celebrity radar kicks in, and bowlers are staring. “I can see it now,” Roberts says, drawing her thumb and forefinger across an imaginary banner headline. “Sources say the lovebirds canoodled all night. Sources say there was major canoodling.”\n\nAnd here it must be said that Roberts, whose reputed canoodlings have launched a thousand clips, has a grudging respect for the verb she helped resurrect. “I just like to say it,” she explains, batting her eyes for effect. “Want to come over for some canoodling?” She first saw the word in the New York Post, which along with its less excitable playmate, the New York Daily News, has detailed the minutiae of her domestic life with a level of tediousness that borders on breathtaking. Bombshells include:\n\nJulia Roberts buying three bracelets with the words “hot,” “fat,” and “crazy” at Shi on Elizabeth Street. —New York Post\n\nJulia Roberts dipping into Howdy Do, the campy collectible store on E. Seventh. She passed over the book* Michael Jackson Was My Lover* but coveted the Dream Stud Colorforms game. —New York Daily News.\n\nShe disputes most tabloid reports with a kind of gallows humor that’s fairly gentle, considering that her private life has for years been a matter of public record—the tabloids being our own little Hollywood Michelin informing us of her preferred brassiere (Maidenform, 34B), her most unsightly body region (armpits), and the heartening news that she has indeed been inoculated for German measles. “Never been there,” she’ll say when asked about the latest gossip. Or: “Oh, yeah—I do that all day.”\n\nAt 31, after 24 films, a few notable romantic and cinematic misfortunes, and nearly a decade of full-blown “Julia-mania” (13 People covers), Roberts has finally embraced the first rule of celebrity: Even if you’re one of the most powerful actresses in Hollywood, even if you command $20 million per movie, even if most directors would set their hair on fire to work with you—even if it’s all true, you will never, ever outrun the tabloids. “The trick,” she explains, fiddling with her shoe (size 8!), “is to ignore them.”\n\nShe surveys the place and says, “Let me ask you this: are you sitting here in this bowling alley, worried that one of these people works for a newspaper and that tomorrow they’re going to say that I was sitting here with some young guy and that it wasn’t Benjamin Bratt?”\n\nPretty worried, she is told.\n\nBut she just laughs and laughs, because the great thing about being Julia Roberts (aside from the fact that she gets to be Julia Roberts) is that when something bugs her she can get the best revenge possible: she can star in a Hollywood movie about it. That would be the lovable romantic comedy Notting Hill, due out this month, co-starring Hugh Grant and written by the gifted Englishman Richard Curtis (Four Weddings and a Funeral). Roberts plays a knockout actress who is deified by the media, dates a loutish movie star, finds love while shooting a film, sees the affair splashed all over the tabloids, goes into seclusion amid scurrilous rumors, wrestles with The Price of Fame, and ultimately transcends it. In media circles, one can already detect the clattering of itchy keyboard fingers: “The Autobiography of Julia Roberts.”\n\nTo which Roberts cheerfully responds, “I think that is the most pedestrian, boring line you can draw. If people can’t sit and just appreciate the movie for what it is—a movie written by Richard Curtis and not about me—then they shouldn’t be writing about the movie.”\n\nSo, anyway …\n\nThe annual dinner to support a Yeshiva system serving more than 8,000 boys and girls in Williamsburg is usually held in the National Guard Armory on Marcy Ave. in Brooklyn. It was shifted to the Jacob Javits Convention Center because the cavernous military building is being used to shoot the movie Stepmom, starring Julia Roberts.\n\n“Who is Julia Roberts?” asked one rabbi.\n\n—New York Daily News, December 17, 1997.\n\nInvariably, press accounts about Roberts’s formative years read like World War I—era Teletype missives: nervous tomboy from quaint Smyrna, Georgia; played Elizabeth Dole in a high-school mock election; father, acting coach Walter Motes, died in 1976; mother, Betty Motes, teaches drama in Smyrna; older sister Lisa is an actress in New York; feisty older brother, Eric, also acts. (Roberts is a stage name that Julia, Eric, and Lisa took.)\n\nThe reason that this portion of a Julia Roberts profile is always so maddeningly oblique is that her family never talks to reporters about her. Don’t read anything into that—aside from Eric, who is famously estranged from Julia, the family gets along nicely. Every now and again, a reporter will show up in Smyrna, trolling for fresh material. Never works. Roberts prefers it that way, and she is ever vigilant. “Mom,” she will begin, “you just have to say, ‘No comment.’ If you say, ‘I don’t really want to talk about Julia,’ they’ll turn around and report that you said, ‘I really don’t want to talk about Julia.’”\n\nIt’s been this way since 1988, when Roberts co-starred in the sleeper Mystic Pizza, her breakthrough. She was 19 and fresh off a couple of low-budget, nowhere movies, Blood Red and Satisfaction, and was about to crack the big leagues as a diabetic fiancée in Steel Magnolias (1989), the girly southern melodrama. By 1990, after coolly holding out for a no-nudity clause, she was starring alongside a revivified Richard Gere in Pretty Woman, the Citizen Kane of hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold movies. Roberts was filming her second star vehicle, the thriller Sleeping with the Enemy, when celebrity beckoned—producers hovering, agents calling from the Coast, the whole bit. The location was Abbeville, South Carolina (population: 5,200).\n\n“I think the local theater was still playing Star Wars for the first time,” Roberts recalls. “They had no palpable awareness of what was going on with me.” But in an atmosphere reminiscent of Michael Jordan’s rookie season, when the young phenom was forced to collect the balls after practice, the crew remained studiously unfazed. “I have to take my hat off to you because the film’s doing so well,” a crew member told Roberts, who recounts the moment with a kind of wistfulness. “I just thought Pretty Woman sucked. I thought, Who’s this girl that’s coming in to play this role? She sucked.”\n\nEarly 1991 was a small riot of adoration, magazine covers, and cash—Pretty Woman and Sleeping with the Enemy grossed a combined $278 million, Roberts’s per-picture asking price jumped to $7 million, and the trades declared her the only female star who could “open” a picture at the time. “She’s really Miss America, isn’t she?” says Roberts’s friend Rupert Everett, who co-starred in her 1997 comedy My Best Friend’s Wedding. “She’s got all the qualities that people want an American woman to have.”\n\nEach film premiere she attended became something out of The Day of the Locust; news footage of this period shows a lovely young woman glowing amid the flashbulbs, patiently tilting her head for each camera—the way a cat tilts when you ask it a question. Sometimes, before a premiere, she would salivate with anticipation.\n\nThe honeymoon was brief, however, and by summer the hordes had descended. There were two reasons for this, and the first was inevitable in the way that all Hollywood crucibles are inevitable. “It was my turn,” Roberts says. “I didn’t check the schedule, but I guess it was my turn.” Which is to say that, after a rise to stardom invariably described as “meteoric,” it was time for Act II: The Backlash. Suddenly, Herbert Ross, who had directed Roberts in her fifth film, Steel Magnolias, was crankily suggesting that his young charge needed acting lessons. During the filming of Steven Spielberg’s disastrous 1991 Peter Pan story, Hook, in which Roberts was cast as Tinkerbell, there were rumblings that she had been, to use that quintessential Hollywood euphemism, “difficult.” Like any true public humiliation, Roberts’s was sealed on 60 Minutes, when Spielberg cagily said, “It was an unfortunate time for us to work together.” And “Tinkerhell” was born.\n\nSay this about Roberts: she has rarely bad-mouthed a colleague in public, never displayed her obvious first-strike capability, never named names. But she’s no shrinking violet; kick her at your peril. (“It’s funny when people say, ‘I don’t think Julia likes me.’ Honey, if I don’t like you, you’re gonna know it.”) Roberts gushes about her Steel Magnolias co-stars Sally Field and Shirley MacLaine, but conspicuously avoids mentioning Herb Ross: “They all rallied around me. They were really my greatest support—pretty much my only support.”\n\nAsked about the fallout from Hook, Roberts flushes; she holds up her hand, as if in court. “Hand to God: not a thing I read about that was truthful, and it really hurt my feelings. Because not only did it make me sound mean, but it was a situation where people who knew the truth talked about it in a way that wasn’t untruthful,” she says, apparently referring to the Spielberg interview. “I saw that and my eyes popped out of my head. I couldn’t believe it. I couldn’t believe that this person that I knew and trusted was actually hesitating to come to my defense.” She adds, “It was a hard lesson to learn. It was the first time that I felt I had a turncoat in my midst.”\n\nMeanwhile, there was another delicious carrot dangled in front of the tabloids in 1991—a period that Roberts’s agent, Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas, called “The Fellini Summer.” It may not have been Bill and Monica, but the events of that long, hot season still have a singular heft in terms of sheer, salacious New York Post—ness. Roberts was engaged to Kiefer Sutherland, whom she then dumped three days before the big event (scheduled to take place on a studio back lot, Liz-and-Larry-style, with a Steel Magnolias theme) because of his acquaintance with the enormously buxom Amanda Rice—or just plain ol’ “Raven,” as she was known over at L.A.’s Crazy Girls Live Exotic Strip Show. Ashen and sunken-eyed, Roberts flew off to Ireland with Sutherland’s best friend (well, ex—best friend), Jason Patric, only to dump him too.\n\nThe awful truth was out: Julia Roberts had a weakness for leading men, particularly her own leading men, including Liam Neeson (Satisfaction), Dylan McDermott (Steel Magnolias), and Sutherland (Flatliners). The story unfolded for three years, consuming Daniel Day-Lewis, Ethan Hawke, and Matthew Perry of Friends, and was highlighted by Roberts’s unlikely, short-lived 1993 marriage to the country musician Lyle Lovett, whose arrival reinvigorated the fraternity of bad headline writers (lovett first sight, lovett or leave it).\n\nWithin months, Miss America had mutated into the mainstream media’s favorite piñata, thrashed by nontabloid publications such as Newsweek, which fanned “reports” from the British tabloids; People, which ran a sidebar comparing her box-office grosses with those of Kiefer Sutherland; Redbook, which offered odds on which star Roberts would date next (the favorite, at 1–1, was Gere); and Spy, which suggested a link between her love life and international disasters such as the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. She was 23 years old.\n\n“I don’t think I realized that the cost of fame is that it’s open season on every moment of your life,” Roberts says wearily. “That was a time when I was kind of followed every moment. … One time I saw three men jump out of a hedge.” Her publicists assumed a bunker mentality, and Roberts began snapping at the tabloid jackals. “You must be so proud!” she’d say. “When your son says, ‘Dad, what do you do?’ you say, ‘I jump out of bushes and terrorize women in the night!’” After reading reports alleging that she’d had a wild night of dancing and romance with Hawke, she issued a memorable denial: “I love to dance, and I will continue to dance. In fact, I plan on doing as much dancing, with as many people, as possible. I will dance until I drop. How about that?”\n\nThen, silence. Roberts didn’t film anything for nearly a year. The “entertainment press,” which abhors a vacuum, launched a flotilla of idiotic stories, one suggesting that Roberts had become a kind of Hollywood “bag girl,” another intimating that she had been last seen at the Los Angeles Farmer’s Market, spiking her orange juice from a flask. “They said I was drug-addicted, alcoholic, anorexic—you name it,” recalls Roberts, who says she was merely taking it easy and waiting for the right scripts to come in. “I mean, they needed to say something in between the ‘She’s Through!’ period and the ‘She’s Back!’ period.”\n\nTo wit: in 1992 she was attached as the female lead in a project called Shakespeare in Love, which was to be directed by Edward Zwick, the bearded co-creator of the television series thirtysomething. Among the British actors who auditioned for the male lead were Hugh Grant and Rupert Everett, who would later become her celebrated costars and friends. “I was a very, very unemployed, pathetic actor at the time,” Grant recalls. “I remember being so intimidated by the fact that she was in the room that I got myself in a sort of kerfuffle”—a kind of Oxford man’s canoodle—“and missed the chair when I sat down. I sat on the arm of the chair, then had that very awkward inner debate about whether to say, ‘Actually, I’ve missed the chair,’ or to pretend that I was really a slightly quirky sort of character who always sits on the arm.”\n\nDays before filming was set to begin, however, her co-star Daniel Day-Lewis pulled out of the project to do another film, and eventually all the major players (with the exception of Zwick, who remained as a producer) moved on, ultimately to be replaced by Gwyneth Paltrow, Joseph Fiennes, director John Madden, and seven Oscars, including Paltrow’s, for best actress. “It’s just something that didn’t come to pass, and it is kind of funny looking at it now,” Roberts says, adding that she feels no pangs of regret. “The script that I had in my hot little hands at the time, seemingly, was different.”\n\nThe next few years produced a grab bag of mild successes, including the John Grisham thriller The Pelican Brief (1993), and embarrassing mistakes, including the joyless Howard Hawks rip-off I Love Trouble (1994) and the dreary Jekyll-and-Hyde fiasco Mary Reilly (1996). Roberts is the first to agree that the last two films “failed,” but discounts reports that she and her I Love Trouble co-star, the irascible Nick Nolte, quarreled so bitterly that they sometimes performed in front of stand-ins. “I don’t know what I’ve already said about I Love Trouble, other than that it was a piece of shit,” she says. “It’s no secret that Nick and I didn’t get along like a house on fire.”\n\nMeantime, things had slowed to a trickle on the prurient front, which perhaps is why the tabloids began scrounging for table scraps—Larry Flynt offering Roberts $1 million to bare all in Hustler, anonymous, third-hand stories that she had tried to swipe Brad from Gwyneth (notwithstanding the fact that Roberts had never actually met Brad). Then, naturally, the floodgates clanged open again amid reports that she had mounted the bar at Hogs & Heifers, a raucous nightspot in Manhattan’s meatpacking district, and, according to local tradition, shed her Maidenform 34B while dancing madly to the redneck anthem “The Devil Went Down to Georgia.” The episode prompted a flurry of reports, addenda, clarifications, and counterclarifications regarding whether the star and the bartender, Margaret Emery, had … well, let’s let the experts explain it:\n\nPhotographer Gary Miller said, “There was one big, long tongue-to-tongue kiss that lasted between 30 and 50 seconds.” —New York Post, September 9, 1996.\n\n“Julia Roberts did not kiss me,” insists Margaret Emery. “That’s a long time for a first kiss. I don’t know whether I could even do that with a guy.” —New York Daily News, September 10, 1996.\n\nThe New York Post yanked an item from Liz Smith’s column that pooh-poohed the *Post’*s claim that Julia Roberts made out with a woman at Hogs & Heifers. You can read the item in Newsday. —New York Daily News, September 12, 1996.\n\nAs to reports of Julia kissing another woman, her publicist laughs. “The only person who got a serious kiss that night was [Roberts’s then boyfriend] Pat Manocchia.” —New York Newsday, September 10, 1996.\n\nAll of which merely served as prologue for Notting Hill, which is set in the charming London neighborhood of the same name. As in Richard Curtis’s previous film, Four Weddings and a Funeral, Grant co-stars as a fumbling, floppy-haired bloke smitten and tortured by an untouchable American princess.\n\nCurtis insists that the model for Roberts’s character was not Julia Roberts, but a hybrid of Grace Kelly and Audrey Hepburn (“Neither of whom were available,” he says). But Curtis, Grant, and director Roger Michell all agreed: Who better to play the world’s most mythic, inaccessible, and intimidating star than the world’s most mythic, inaccessible, and intimidating star?\n\nJust how intimidating became clear when the script was sent to Roberts in June 1997, as the embers of BrassiereGate still flickered. “How boring,” she said to her agent. “How tedious—what a stupid thing for me to do.” She read the script only because it had been written by Curtis, whom she’d once called “a genius” during a television interview. (We know this because callers to Curtis’s home were greeted with the quotation on his answering machine.) “Fuck, I’m gonna do this movie,” Roberts said, almost against her better judgment. She could already hear the press-junket questions, so she told herself, Well, since everyone will think it’s about me, I’ll just take a little European vacation and be me for three months.\n\nThe filmmakers’ immediate reaction to her interest was terror. Julia Roberts does that to people. Curtis and Michell, accompanied by producer Duncan Kenworthy, were summoned to a meeting at New York’s Four Seasons Hotel. “The three of us had one room, and we all went off—me to the bathroom, Duncan to the lobby, and Roger to the bedroom,” Curtis recalls. “We emerged 10 minutes later wearing suits for the first time ever. It was an extraordinary experience to see the real Julia Roberts waiting at the dining-room table. She was 10 years younger than some of us—20 years younger than one of us—and yet so obviously in charge that it was alarming.”\n\nThe meeting went well, but Roberts remained aloof even as the addled Englishmen tagged along to her scheduled appearance on Late Show with David Letterman. Afterward, in the hallway, Roberts suddenly kissed Michell, said, “Good luck with your film,” and left. “Worst 10 minutes of my life,” Curtis recalls of the drive back to the hotel. “I just sat in the back of the car, winded and horrified, and finally said, ‘You guys did hear what she said?’”\n\nSeveral days later, accepting much less than her usual fee, Roberts signed on.\n\nNotting Hill was filmed an hour outside London, on a set designed to look much like the neighborhood where Curtis lives (thus requiring him to leave home in the morning, drive an hour, and arrive at what looked like his front door). Early on, Grant was even more skittish than usual—“tense as a toad,” he says. “When he’s nervous,” Curtis explains, “his voice goes up an octave.” For a while, Grant walked around complaining that Roberts’s voice was significantly lower than his. Asked to summarize his feelings about working with her after the unfortunate armchair incident of 1992, Grant pauses. “Fear,” he says, half-seriously. “I think the emotion you have when you first meet someone tends to linger with you. I was all ready to be scared, and I must say, the fear never quite left me.”\n\nJulia Anxiety was pervasive. At one point, Roberts concedes, Michell nervously approached her when he thought she had too much makeup on and whispered, “Ummm … would you mind terribly washing your face?”\n\nRoberts, meantime, was initially petrified by the sheer Britty-ness of it all, given that both Grant and Curtis tend to produce artfully crafted pearls of wit. Her early training basically amounted to an episode of Crime Story, the mid-80s Dennis Farina vehicle, and here she was working with actors who had spent years doing Othello at the Barbican.\n\nSoon Roberts confronted the pitfalls of playing a character who, she concluded, only seemed to be modeled on her (whereas her cameo as herself in Robert Altman’s 1992 The Player was, by definition, Julia Roberts). “I thought I was going into familiar territory,” Roberts says, “but ended up doing twice the effort because I wasn’t prepared for effort.” At times she didn’t know whether to be Julia or her character, Anna Scott: Stepford Acting. “I was struggling with playing a person who really only shares an occupation and a height and a weight and a status with me.”\n\nFor starters, Anna Scott’s troubles begin when, in a revelation common to all sorts of stars, the tabloids unearth nude photographs which Scott had posed for early in her career. “I didn’t agree with what she did, first of all,” says Roberts, who has never posed nude for anybody (though she does tiptoe up to the line in this film). “Didn’t agree with how she got into this mess—I would never have been in that situation. Didn’t agree with the way she was dealing with it.” Basically, Anna Scott freaks. “Didn’t agree with the way she was reacting to it. Didn’t agree with any of that stuff.” When Roberts took issue with Scott’s behavior, Michell would calmly respond, “Anna Scott—different person.”\n\nAnother moment when Roberts respectfully pleaded artistic difference came during a crucial morning-after scene in Grant’s apartment. Anna Scott, lying in bed, quotes the famous line that Rita Hayworth said after starring in Gilda: “They go to bed with Gilda, they wake up with me.” Watching that scene, it’s damn near impossible to ignore the obvious freight—Whoa! That’s Julia Roberts!—and she fully understands just how ferociously those words will be quoted and dissected once the film opens. “I hate to say anything negative about what Richard wrote, because he’s a genius, but I hated saying that line,” she says. “To me, it was nails on a chalkboard. I don’t really believe any of that.”\n\nAnd yet … and yet. In her capacity as the film’s unofficial technical adviser, Roberts transferred her own experiences to Anna Scott’s in a hundred small ways. (For that matter, so did Grant, who says, “I think the fact that the story involves tabloids was quite an attraction to both of us.”) “She claims it’s not about her,” says Curtis, who adores Roberts. “But we were definitely getting emotions which were close to what we thought she must have felt. I think she takes the subject less seriously than the girl in the movie does, but …”\n\nThe irony resonates even in the film’s opening sequence, a montage of glam shots detailing Anna Scott’s arrival at a lavish Hollywood premiere, complete with the feline head pivot: life imitating art imitating art imitating life. “One day we all watched those three minutes, and at the end we were stunned,” Curtis recalls. “We said, ‘Fuck! That’s who we’re dealing with.’ It’s very easy when you’re dealing with a very reasonable, lovely, relaxed, 30-year-old woman to forget that that’s also the Julia Roberts who, for 10 years beforehand, you could never have gotten within a hundred yards of. It was a freakish moment when we realized that the woman we were dealing with was actually both those things: this relaxed person and this untouchable, iconic object of which there are so many photographs.”\n\nSpeaking of photographs and the people who love them, the paparazzi flocked to this rare mingling of two proud tabloid warhorses: Roberts and Grant. “It was surreal,” Grant recalls, invoking a word that generally describes the whole experience. “We were shooting scenes in Notting Hill, where we had a hundred extras playing paparazzi, and then we had a hundred paparazzi paparazzi-ing the paparazzi.” But the fun really heated up when Roberts was joined by her boyfriend, the unreasonably well-constructed Benjamin Bratt, better known as Detective “Rey” Curtis on the NBC crime show Law & Order. After filming scenes in which she was hounded by fake tabloid jackals, Roberts was periodically tailed by real jackals, who for years had been printing obviously libelous rubbish like this:\n\nSandra Bullock seems to have usurped Julia Roberts’ role as the movie star you’d most like to go bowling with. —New York Daily News.\n\nSo here we are, back at square one, with Roberts still attempting to decipher what the fuss is all about. She’s not the least bit angry, resentful, or jaded, and she’s discussing the subject only because a reporter keeps egging her on—she’s not pulling a Courtney Love, by turns courting and crucifying the press. She never limits what questions can be asked, never cries conveniently. Her answers are crisp and intelligent, and she offers perfect sound bites on, say:\n\nThe “Difficult” Thing: “Certainly there have been plenty of people, in the course of making 20 movies, that I didn’t get along with. But I have gotten along swimmingly with 95 percent of the people I’ve worked with.”\n\nThe Celebrity Thing: “I work when I want to work, and I work with people that I want to work with. I travel hither and yon to fabulous places. I’m surrounded by wonderful, interesting people. I live a privileged life—hugely privileged. It’s an excellent life. I’m rich. I’m happy. I have a great job. It would be absurd to pretend that it’s anything different. I’m like a pig in shit.”\n\nThe Kiefer Thing: Well, she’d be glad to talk about him, but, actually, she hasn’t spoken to the guy in years and has no idea where he lives.\n\nShe even indulges the occasional question about Bratt, whom she has been seeing for a year and a half. “We met in a restaurant,” she says, then vaguely describes how “he walked in, and I looked up at him, and it was like something hit me over the head with a bat.” Which is convenient, since fine dining has become a kind of leitmotif for their uniquely public private courtship.

Go ahead: ask about the $17 million she received for this summer’s Runaway Bride, a romantic comedy which reunites her with Richard Gere. The question routinely arises on press junkets, those gruesome publicity orgies sponsored by film studios (and deftly lampooned in Notting Hill, when Grant masquerades as an “equine journalist” for a fictitious magazine called Horse and Hound). Yes, Roberts says graciously, movie stars are absurdly overpaid. “[But] you don’t sit down at lunch with someone and ask, ‘So, how much do you make?’ That’s inappropriate. I would never ask you that. And if I did, how would that make you feel?” The hunter becomes the hunted: “So, what do you do with that money? And what’s your tax bracket like?”\n\nIn fact, her media skills are so finely calibrated that she can afford to let her guard down every now and then. “Like when I said how I met Benjamin,” she begins. “The actual story is wildly interesting and calamity-filled and hilarious and wonderful and all these great things that are incredibly personal and private to us. So the expedient, for-world-publication answer is: ‘We met in a restaurant.’ Now, by definition, that’s not even true. We didn’t even speak to each other that night.”\n\nRoberts reads the New York tabloids—not every day, but sometimes. She does this because she’s a New Yorker, and that’s what New Yorkers do. They read about other New Yorkers. “We all have our off days, right?” she says philosophically. “Sometimes it hurts my feelings, and if it affects my family, that kind of troubles me. But if it’s just me they’re aiming at, I don’t care.”\n\nWhich is why she often walks the streets, shops unaccompanied, and famously rides the subway, even at night. She has no cooks, no drivers, no stylists, no toadies. She is a constant presence in and around Greenwich Village—apartment hunting with Bratt, having coffee with Susan Sarandon, shopping for soy milk at the Korean deli. “You become kind of a fixture,” she says, “and documenting you on a day-to-day basis is an uninteresting thing even to the most absurd person.” Funny thing, her celebrity: the more “normal” she acts, the less she is hounded. “Oh, God—so much less, ”Roberts says. “So much less.”\n\nAt lunch one afternoon, while picking over a salad dressed in a refreshingly tart vinaigrette, she explains why. “What do I care if they know what salad dressing I’m using?” she says, and smiles. “If you take it down to its simplest form, here’s a stranger commenting on your personality, your life, your hair—whatever. That amounts to vapor to me.” (Then again, she later points out, if a reporter were to jump out of a hedge tonight, “I would bust some ass.”)\n\nShe leans in close. “Before I even walk in the door, I believe a lot of them have their thesis,” she says, only half-seriously. “They have their little title, and there’s very little I can do to conform to something that I don’t know exists.” She thinks for a moment, then leans closer. “I actually said this to my publicist last night: ‘I’m just gonna walk in and say, “So, what are you writing?” ’ ”\n\nThe nerve."
