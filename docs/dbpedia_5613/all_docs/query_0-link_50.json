And we can see why the pair opted to return to this stunning location. As do loads of other Lake Como-loving celebrities, many of them even owning property in the Italian lake area.\n\nIf we were rich and famous, weâ€™d also make a beeline (or should we say Trainline) to this sun-kissed paradise of gorgeous villas and picturesque villages located at the foot of the scenic Alps. The romance tied to this atmospheric slice of Italy is only heightened by the ease and charm of traveling by train, especially when Lake Como is just a whizz away from the magnificent city of Milan.\n\nTake a look at our insiderâ€™s guide to where celebrities stay in Lake Como.\n\nImage Credit: Getty Images, georgeoprea9.

And, while most of us have to make do with blinds, he also snapped up the neighboring house to ensure his privacy.\n\nWe understand why Clooney is so smitten by the beauty of Lake Como, while also keeping in mind itâ€™s where he met his wife, Amal, in 2013. Keeping things firmly Italian, the couple married months later in Venice.\n\nClooney has hosted many of his celebrity friends at the villa over the years, including the cast of Oceanâ€™s Eleven, while actors Emily Blunt and John Krasinski even chose to tie the knot there.\n\nImage Credit: Getty Images, xbrchx. Image Location: Laglio, Lake Como, Italy.\n\nWhere do famous people go in Lake Como?\n\nThereâ€™s an abundance of things to do in Lake Como, from admiring Renaissance architecture and awe-inspiring scenery to long lunches and dinners in high-end restaurants and hotels.\n\nThe Clooneys have been spotted at Il Gatto Nero, a terraced restaurant dishing up delicious specialties overlooking the lake. Then thereâ€™s celeb favorite, the dreamy Grand Hotel Tremezzo, with its elegant gardens, amazing floating swimming pool, and poolside restaurants and bars.
