        "text": "News\n\nWorld News\n\nUS News\n\nBiden slams Supreme Court at $28 million fundraiser with Obama, Clooney, Julia Roberts\n\nBiden slams Supreme Court at $28 million fundraiser with Obama, Clooney, Julia Roberts\n\nPresident Joe Biden criticized the US Supreme Court at a fundraiser in Los Angeles with Barack Obama and Hollywood celebrities, raising $28 million.\n\nImage credit: AFP\n\nLOS ANGELES: President Joe Biden slammed the US Supreme Court as \"out of kilter\" at a glitzy fundraiser in Los Angeles on Saturday with former President Barack Obama and top Hollywood celebrities that has raised $28 million.\n\nLate-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel began by showing a video montage contrasting Biden's record with that of his predecessor and current Republican challenger Donald Trump. He drew cheers from the audience at a packed Peacock Theater in downtown Los Angeles, where Hollywood celebrities George Clooney and Julia Roberts were among the guests.\n\nBiden, a Democrat who has frequently denounced specific decisions but resisted a full-throated attack on the court itself, said on Saturday \"the Supreme Court has never been as out of kilter as it is today.\"\n\n\"The fact of the matter is that there has never been a court that is this far out of step,\" Biden said. He noted that conservative Justice Clarence Thomas had said the court, which overturned the half-century-old federal right to abortion, should reconsider such things as in vitro fertilization and contraception.\n\nTrump nominated three of the six conservatives who control the nine-member court. He and Biden are in a tight rematch race for the November 5 election.\n\nIf Trump is elected again, Biden said, he \"is likely to have two new Supreme Court nominees.\"\n\n\"The idea that if he's reelected he's going to appoint two more who are flying flags upside down... I think it is one of the scariest parts,\" Biden said.\n\nHe was referring to a recent controversy involving Justice Samuel Alito, who allowed flags associated with the movement to reverse Trump's 2020 loss to Biden - including an upside-down American flag - to fly outside his homes in Virginia and New Jersey.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers, citing the flag displays, have said Alito should recuse himself from a case involving Trump's claim of presidential immunity from prosecution on federal criminal charges relating to his efforts to overturn the 2020 results.\n\nSince Biden took office, the court's conservative majority has also restricted affirmative action, gay rights, gun control and environmental regulation. It has blocked the president's agenda on immigration, student loans, vaccine mandates and climate change.\n\nObama said \"the power of the Supreme Court is determined by elections. What we're seeing now is a byproduct of 2016\" when Trump was elected. \"Hopefully we have learned our lesson. Because these elections matter.\"\n\n'Largest democratic fundraiser'\n\nThe Biden campaign hoped the star-studded event would display strength and momentum despite Biden's low approval ratings and concerns about the age of the president, who is 81.\n\n\"This will be one of the biggest fundraisers we've had,\" said Ajay Jain Bhutoria, deputy finance chair at the Democratic National Committee. A Biden campaign spokeswoman said \"$28 mln heading into President Biden's LA fundraiser - and counting. This is the largest Democratic fundraiser in history.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign outraised the $26 million a March fundraiser in New York City generated where comedian and TV host Stephen Colbert hosted Biden, Obama and former President Bill Clinton. The top-ticket package for the LA event costs $500,000, campaign officials said.\n\nOther celebrities who took the stage at the Saturday event included Jack Black, Jason Bateman, Kathryn Hahn and Sheryl Lee Ralph.\n\nIn recent weeks, Mark Hamill of Star Wars fame made a White House briefing room appearance to praise the president, Robert De Niro showed up in lower Manhattan for a press conference at the Biden campaign's behest and Steven Spielberg has been helping the Biden campaign with storytelling.\n\nActor Michael Douglas held a fundraiser for the president and artists Queen Latifah, Lenny Kravitz, Lizzo, James Taylor, Christina Aguilera and Barbra Streisand have all performed to help Biden raise money.\n\nBiden campaign's fundraising in April lagged Trump's for the first time, after the former president ramped up his joint operation with the Republican National Committee and headlined high-dollar fundraisers.\n\nDemocrats still maintained an overall cash advantage over Trump and the Biden campaign continues to have a considerably larger war chest.\n\nBiden and Trump are tied in national polls with less than five months to go before the election, while Trump has the edge in the battleground states that will decide the election, recent polls show. On economic issues like inflation, Trump scores higher with voters overall than Biden.\n\nDemocrats have long counted on the liberal Los Angeles area as a rich source of financial backing. Republicans often decry Democrats nationwide as funded by Hollywood elites and California liberals.\n\nBut the state's donors bankroll presidential campaigns on both sides of the aisle. Biden and Trump have both raised more in the state for their reelection bids than anywhere else, according to fundraising disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nBiden raised $24 million through April 30 in California, and Trump $11.7 million, according to the Federal Election Commission.\n\nThe president was largely unable to host high-dollar Hollywood fundraisers for much of 2023 because of industry strikes. But since they were resolved, Biden has headlined several fundraisers in the state, including one in December where top tickets approached $1 million.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nVisual Stories\n\n8 flowers and plants that will attract birds to your garden\n\nLifestyle\n\n9 habits which will keep your skin young\n\nLifestyle\n\n10 delicious dishes to pair with Idli beyond Sambhar\n\nFood\n\nInternational Tiger Day: Indian national parks famous for Bengal tigers\n\ntravel\n\n10 negative impacts of strict parenting\n\nLifestyle\n\nInternational Beer Day 2024: 8 types of beer and ingredients used in making them\n\nFood\n\nâBeautiful baby girl names with letter 'M'â\n\nLifestyle\n\n10 most famous wildlife safaris across the globe\n\ntravel\n\nSawan special: Easy Makhana Mango Barfi made under 10 mins\n\nFood\n\n10 bird species extinct due to loss of habitat\n\nLifestyle"
