        "text": "It has been half her lifetime since the actress, now 46, became an international star in 1990 thanks to Pretty Woman. She is now a mother of three with her husband Danny Moder and it’s clear she has been cautious about a comeback.\n\n“I love being at home and love being a mum,” she says. “I am not driven only by acting or fi lm success. There are so many other things to do and enjoy.”\n\nRoberts, whose life seems to have settled down since the frantic 1990s which ended in her winning an Oscar for best actress as Erin Brockovich in 2000, has chosen her roles carefully.\n\nHer new fi lm, August: Osage County – she is Oscar nominated as best supporting actress – is a comedy drama produced by George Clooney in which Meryl Streep plays her mother. “I always think: ‘How much do I need to do this? How much disruption will be caused to my home life?\n\nAre the people I am working with sane and reasonable?’ People sometimes think I am being picky. But I do know the difference when the right material comes along. For this I could not sign up fast enough.”\n\nIt puts her alongside Streep, also Oscar nominated as best actress, playing her drug-addicted mother who is suffering from cancer.\n\nThe two exchange insults throughout the movie, culminating in a fight in which Roberts tries to remove a pill bottle from Streep’s hand.\n\n“I was not going to turn down a chance to act with Meryl – or to fight with her,” says Roberts. “But it has been a case of coming back one step at a time.”\n\n__BREAK1RIGHT__\n\nAlthough she has worked consistently, much of the past decade has been spent as mother to nine-year-old twins Hazel and Phinnaeus and six- year-old Henry, far from the spotlight on her ranch in New Mexico.\n\nShe has also challenged cynics who thought her marriage to little-known cameraman Moder, 44, would not last after her record of loving and leaving a legion of high-profile men.\n\nSHE’D had a string of relationships\n\non her movies with Liam Neeson (Satisfaction, 1988), Dylan McDermott (Steel Magnolias, 1989) and Kiefer Sutherland (Flatliners, 1990).\n\nThere were also well-recorded flings with actors Jason Patric, Daniel Day- Lewis, Ethan Hawke and Matthew Perry of Friends. And even when she married country singer Lyle Lovett in 1993 it lasted less than two years.\n\nIt made her the subject of gossip columns around the world, year after year. “If Danny and I had not been solid together it would have ended before we had children,” she says. Even the marriage came with controversy.\n\nModer divorced his first wife after he and Roberts met on the 2001 film The Mexican.\n\nAround the same time Roberts was dumped – possibly for the first time in her life – by her boyfriend of three years, actor Benjamin Bratt, when he discovered that she and Moder were becoming more than just friends.\n\nAfter that events took a fast turn –and not for the better.\n\nModer’s ex-wife, a make-up artist called Vera, accused Roberts of being a marriage wrecker.\n\nThe star responded by wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the motif “A Low Vera”. But with a solid marriage and subsequent children the pressure wore off. She was able to slip quietly from the headlines and the gossip columns.\n\n“In the early days some people were not happy because we were happy,” she says. “There were also remarks about Danny being a cameraman, implying that he was not good enough for me. But our jobs were not married to each other.\n\nI have said this a thousand times – I just think I am the same relatively simple person that I have always been. I just have this flashy, wacky job.”\n\nThe way Roberts tells it, she’s basically the girl next door from small town Smyrna, Georgia, who got lucky.\n\nIn doing so she also became the first actress to break the wage barrier in Hollywood, which gave her a salary equal to the top male stars.\n\nHer $20million paydays – £12.5million at today’s exchange rate – opened the way for some leading actresses in her wake to achieve equality.\n\n__RELATEDPOSTS__\n\n“It was not about the money,” she insists. It was about getting the same as the men. I didn’t ask for those sumsand did not negotiate them. I could also see how absurd it all became. It was like a Monopoly game.\n\n“I would be getting offers and saying: ‘What? Oh, OK, great.’ Then I would call my mum and tell her. We would laugh about it. But none of those sums made me a better actor.”\n\nHer mother Betty had been an actress herself before setting up an acting school with her father Walter in Atlanta, Georgia. They divorced when Roberts was five and her father died when she was 10.\n\nShe and her sister Lisa were brought up by their mother and her second husband Michael Motes. Her older brother Eric, also an actor, had lived with her father. Roberts did not even talk to Eric for many years and there are family tensions that are not discussed. She prefers to look only on the present and on the upbeat.\n\n“Happiness takes on different forms as you get older and smarter, make more friends and get deeper in to relationships,” she says. “I am in a fortunate place in which I can dedicate myself to my family and friends.”\n\nIt’s worth noting that it has not always been that simple. I recall British film producer Duncan Kenworthy telling me how he had originally attempted to contact Roberts to star alongside Hugh Grant in the 1999 film Notting Hill.\n\nHer agent would not even take his calls until he sent a firm financial offer for what was then an unseen script.\n\nAnd once Roberts accepted the script there were more negotiations. So perhaps it was more Tricky Woman than Pretty Woman in those days?\n\n“I have always been careful with films,” she says. “I had two years off in my 20s to travel and enjoy life. I had finished one movie [Dying Young, 1991] and was waiting for something else to come up.\n\n“I thought: ‘Should I just work for the sake of working? Should I work because they are being nice and asking me?’ But I did not cave in to pressure and it was an early lesson of how to live life. I was quite proud of myself that I was at home, beaming with pride that I could turn down movies. My reward for that was people saying I was psychotic, a drug addict, exhausted and could not go on. All of it was untrue.”\n\nHer life has now moved on through hit films such as Ocean’s Eleven (2001) and Ocean’s Twelve (2004) plus Valentine’s Day and Eat Pray Love, both released four years ago.\n\nAnd all suggestions of diva behaviour are brushed aside. “I do not have to go to great lengths to participate in a normal life,” she says. “I was once asked if I would like to be an ordinary housewife. But I am ordinary. The only person who cleaned my house was me. I never tried to put other parts of my life into compartments.”\n\nIt seems Julia Roberts has been spending more time in recent years working for UNICEF and various charities than she has studying fi lm scripts.\n\n“Despite reports to the contrary, I have never been one of those blindly ambitious actresses,” she insists. “In my own mind I am still a girl from small-town Georgia who can’t believe any of this has happened to her.”"
