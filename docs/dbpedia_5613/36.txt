(born 1967). In the 1990s and early 2000s, American actress Julia Roberts was one of the highest-paid female Hollywood stars ever. She was also the first actress to be named to Hollywood Reporter’s list of the most powerful women in the entertainment industry. She commanded $20 million—a figure which previously had only been paid to male leads—for her starring role in Erin Brockovich (2000). The movie tells the real-life story of a law-office clerk who helped the citizens of a California town win a multimillion-dollar settlement against a utility company for health problems caused by the company’s pollution of their drinking water. For her performance in that film, Roberts earned an Academy Award as the year’s best actress.

Julia Fiona Roberts was born on October 28, 1967, in Smyrna, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta. Her parents briefly ran an actors’ workshop when she was a child. However, Roberts had no acting experience or formal training when she moved to New York City, New York, after high school to pursue a career in show business. She signed with a modeling agency upon her arrival, but she never landed any jobs. Her first film role turned up after she was recommended by her older brother, actor Eric Roberts, for a bit part as his on-screen sister in Blood Red (1989), a drama set in the late 1800s. Although the film was completed in 1986, its release was delayed for a few years.

Roberts’s first leading part was in Mystic Pizza (1988). She portrayed a young woman working in a pizzeria in a small Connecticut town. In the film Steel Magnolias (1989), Roberts worked alongside a cast of veteran actresses. She received a Golden Globe Award and an Academy-Award nomination for best supporting actress for her portrayal of Sally Field’s diabetic daughter.

Roberts became a household name with her performance in the top-grossing film of 1990, Pretty Woman. It was a comedy about a romance between a prostitute and a business tycoon, played by Richard Gere. She earned a second Golden Globe and a second Oscar nomination. Roberts reteamed with Gere in 1999 for another romantic comedy, Runaway Bride. Her personal life, however, including a highly publicized short-lived marriage to singer Lyle Lovett, sometimes overshadowed her career.

Roberts worked steadily throughout the 1990s in such films as Flatliners (1990), Sleeping with the Enemy (1991), The Pelican Brief (1993), Something to Talk About (1995), Mary Reilly (1996), My Best Friend’s Wedding (1997), Stepmom (1998), and Notting Hill (1999). The 21st century proved just as productive. In 2000 Roberts launched her own production company, Shoelace Productions, and that same year she starred in Erin Brockovich. She next starred in the blockbuster comedy Ocean’s Eleven (2001) and its sequel Ocean’s Twelve (2004). She also appeared in the relationship drama Closer (2004).

In 2006 Roberts supplied the voice for the spider Charlotte in the animated film adaptation of E.B. White’s children’s book Charlotte’s Web. That year she also made her Broadway debut in Three Days of Rain, earning mixed reviews. Roberts next appeared with Tom Hanks in Charlie Wilson’s War (2007), a film based on true events surrounding the U.S. government’s involvement in the Afghan resistance to the Soviets in the 1980s. Her subsequent movies included the family drama Fireflies in the Garden (2008), the romantic spy caper Duplicity (2009), and the romantic comedy Valentine’s Day (2010). After starring in Eat Pray Love (2010), Roberts reteamed with Hanks in Larry Crowne (2011). In Mirror Mirror (2012), a comedic version of the Snow White tale, she played the role of the evil queen.

In 2013 Roberts starred opposite Meryl Streep in the family drama August: Osage County. It was based on the play by Tracy Letts. The role earned Roberts an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress. She later assumed the role of a doctor assisting gay men during the early years of the AIDS crisis in New York City in The Normal Heart (2014).

In the feature film Secret in Their Eyes (2015), Roberts portrayed an FBI agent. She then joined the cast of the comedy Mother’s Day (2016) as a hard-driving businesswoman. In Jodie Foster’s thriller Money Monster (2016), her character is the producer of a financial advice show who is taken hostage. In 2017 Roberts lent her voice to the animated film Smurfs: The Lost Village and played the mother of a child with a rare facial condition in an adaptation of R.J. Palacio’s novel Wonder. In 2018 Roberts starred as a therapist working at a facility to help veterans adjust to civilian life in Homecoming. It was her first television series. She also appeared as a mother whose son skips his rehabilitation program to return home for Christmas in Ben Is Back (2018).
