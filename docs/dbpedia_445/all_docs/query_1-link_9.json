        "text": "Christopher Richard Wade Dettling (2018)\n\nPREFACE\n\nWe hereby present to the public some of our writings on the Québécocracy, — a vanishing phase of world history in Canada. Indeed, the Hydro–Québec (hydraulic) ruling class disposed of the old British imperialist régimes in French and English Canada. Alas, the political and economic instrumentalities with which the Québécocracy eliminated British imperialism in Canada were themselves borrowed from European modernity in the form of Bonapartism, — namely autocracy founded upon popular consent (H.A.L. Fisher). Once the groundworks of modern European raison d’état are destroyed in Canada, the very foundations of the Québécocracy dissolve along with the world historical efficacy of the political and economic instrumentalities of the Québec Regime, 1968–2006. Canada is thus repositioned in natural alignment with Americanism. This at least is the rational verdict of exact historiography and world history.\n\nThe four literary portraits of Trudeau, Mulroney, Chrétien and Martin are intended merely to outline and highlight the fertile ground of Canadian political and economic history under the comprehensive form of Americanism, — a magnificent task which awaits the rising generation of Canadians in the world of today.\n\nWe sincerely hope that our readers grasp the inner and immanent thread which unites these four portraits as historical moments in the rise of Americanism, in the clash between English and French Canada, as the world spirit of Globalism, and therefore sympathize with our intention in publishing these newfangled ideas: The rational conception of Canada.\n\nChristopher Richard Wade Dettling, 2018\n\nINTRODUCTION: WORLD HISTORY AND CANADIAN POLITY\n\nIn world history the political and economic germs of the Québec Regime in Ottawa 1968–2006, are found in the decline of the British Empire, in the collapse of modernity and rise of Globalism, and not merely in the globalization of the earth. Economic globalization concerns every country on earth, while the supremacy of Globalism involves the rise of Western civilization in the world of today. This selfsame political and economic movement of Globalism, in various forms and degrees of intensity, is found in all 20th century world history:\n\n“In our destruction of institutions and ways of thinking, we create the ability to transcend them: This is the basis of our movement. We want to constantly overthrow everything around us, to create a Utopia in the existing world.”¹\n\nIn Canadian political and economic history, the collapse of modernity and rise of Globalism is named the Québec Regime in Ottawa and Empire of Paul Desmarais, — the Québécocracy: From out of the modern power struggles between English and French Canada, and the clash between the Québec Regime in Ottawa and Empire of Desmarais, arises rational political and economic order, which results in the financial, commercial and industrial supremacy of Globalism in Canada.²\n\n1 — Who Murdered Duplessis, Sauvé and Johnson?\n\nThe Québec Regime in Ottawa and Empire of Desmarais comes from out of the government of Louis Saint Laurent³ crushed under the hammer blows of John Diefenbaker and Westernism: From out of the struggles for power in Québec between the followers of Louis Saint Laurent and Maurice Duplessis.\n\nWith the Liberals out of power in Ottawa, the creatures of Louis Saint Laurent are out of work and prospects: They set their sights upon Québec and Maurice Duplessis. In the war against the Triple Alliance they are assisted by the federal Liberal opposition in their endeavors to destroy the Union nationale: According to their schemes, the road back to Ottawa leads through Québec with the destruction of Franco–Canadian conservatism.\n\nAfter the sudden deaths of Premier Maurice Duplessis and Premier Paul Sauvé, the Union nationale is struck down in 1960 by the Jean Lesage Liberals. Now the road is open for the return of Liberalism in Ottawa under Pearson: John Diefenbaker is defeated in 1963 under the blows of the Pearson–Lesage combine, and Mike takes power. But the Union nationale is not very easily destroyed in Québec after so many years in office, which means Mike’s hold on power is weak and rests upon uncertain foundations: A strong and resurgent conservatism under Robarts and Johnson could still end the half century Liberal stranglehold upon Ottawa.\n\nWith the sudden death of Premier Daniel Johnson (the elder) the stage is set for the demise of Franco–Canadian conservatism in the rise of the Parti Québécois and the anti–federalist movement: Jean Chrétien and René Lévesque have arrived upon the scene:\n\n“Jean–Louis Lévesque, the Montréal financier from far–away Gaspé, ‘knew first–hand the difficulties that awaited a French–Canadian in business, and therefore he took the young Paul Desmarais [DAY maw ray] under his wing, and led him into the realm of French–Canadian high finance … The Lévesque which most Canadians have heard about is the great orator, René, the Minister of Natural Resources of the Province of Québec. Jean–Louis Lévesque is his wealthy distant cousin, who owns the largest financial empire in Québec.’”⁴\n\nThe seeds are sowed: Rational political and economic order in Canada is undone. Nearly a half century will pass before Canada rises once again upon the seat of rational political and economic order under PM Stephen Harper.⁵ Québec will be deeply divided into federalist and anti–federalist camps, and the Canadian economy will be gutted. Henceforth the vote will be split in half, which is the true and real basis upon which rests the Québec Regime in Ottawa and Empire of Desmarais: After fifty years of political and economic irrationalism, the Canadian financial, commercial and industrial heartland will be in shambles.⁶\n\n“We really are sick and tired of our Nigger Kings: I wonder if we could borrow a Sultan or Colonel from the Arabs.”⁷ Thus, as their counterparts in the Francophonie and Communauté, with their modern European opposition between monarchism and republicanism, resultant from the world historical clash between the Industrial and French Revolutions, the rulers of the Québec Regime in Ottawa and their families are enriched beyond their wildest dreams. But the outdated and surpassed Napoléonic and French revolutionary “conception” of right is not the rational conception of right found in the Magna Carta and the Constitution of the United States of America: Modern freedom is not Global freedom.⁸\n\nAs with the modern Europeans, the world historical contagion of subjectivism, relativism and irrationalism in the arena of politics and economics is deeply rooted among Franco–Canadians like Pierre–Basile Mignault: “Nations are individuals: I will always uphold this analogy.”⁹ From whence comes this disease of modern unreason in contemporary world history? “All things that exist being particulars … every man’s reasoning and knowledge is only about the ideas existing in his own mind.”¹⁰ Thus, the world does not exist according to John Locke, while the universe is appearance and delusion.¹¹ The French revolution unleashed upon European politics and economics this sophistical distemper of the philosophes,¹² and brought to prominence the modern unreason of Kant, Hume, Leibniz and Locke:\n\n“The statesmen of the French Revolution roused their fellow countrymen to the most astounding military efforts by announcing that France would compel all other nations to be free in the same sense as herself. Under Napoleon I, and more obscurely under his nephew, Napoleon III, France aspired to impose her suzerainty by force of arms upon the whole of Western Europe.”¹³\n\nThe statesmen of the French Revolution roused their fellow countrymen to the most astounding military efforts by announcing that France would compel all other nations to be free in the same sense as herself? “Diderot, Rousseau, and Voltaire, greatly influenced the leaders of the French Revolution.”¹⁴\n\nFrancophone Canadians, like other inhabitants of the New World, were not immune to the contagion of modern European Raison d’État:\n\n“France has the greatest laws and jurisprudence in the world … the Napoléonic Code is actually the most beautiful and glorious achievement of the almighty Napoléon Bonaparte.”¹⁵\n\nShall we forget to mention the Québec Regime in Ottawa and Empire of Paul Desmarais? Not at all, dear reader. Paul Desmarais was an “expert on Napoléon Bonaparte,” and was in “many ways himself a driven man,” exactly like the Emperor of France: As the warlord Napoléon, Paul Desmarais always sought “new ways to expand his power.”¹⁶\n\nWe shall see where these “new ways” of political and economic power lead Paul Desmarais and the Québec Regime, just as the revolutionary power of Napoléon Bonaparte destroyed the Ancien Régime of feudal France: After fifty years of political and economic irrationalism, the Canadian financial, commercial and industrial heartland will be in shambles. From out of the modern power struggles between English and French Canada, and the clash between the Québec Regime in Ottawa and Empire of Desmarais, arises rational political and economic order, which results in the financial, commercial and industrial supremacy of Globalism in Canada.\n\n2 — Crimes of the Québec Regime in Ottawa\n\nRemember Jean Chrétien and the 1995 criminals of the Québec Regime in Ottawa and Empire of Paul Desmarais, whose actions gutted the Canadian military, and threw many thousands of Canadian civil servants and their families into the bread lines, soup kitchens and flop houses, especially in Ontario?¹⁷ The 1995 cuts were their handiwork, which profoundly damaged social programs in Canada for a generation of Canadians, especially healthcare services in Ontario and Québec.¹⁸\n\n“In 1994 Paul Martin announced defense spending reductions totaling $7 billion in the following five years. The cuts would close four major bases and two military colleges within the next three years: Some sixteen smaller installations would also be pared down or be closed. The Martin–Chrétien plan would also terminate over 16,500 military and civilian employees of the defense department, leaving a civilian support staff and armed force of 91,900 men and women by the year 1998.”¹⁹\n\nThe political and economic irrationalism of Jean Chrétien and the 1995 criminals of the Québec Regime in Ottawa and Empire of Desmarais greatly harmed the financial, commercial and industrial growth of Ontario, the motor of central Canada, causing Premier Mike Harris to make budget cuts in social services, instead of greatly increasing provincial taxes and debt: The Harris policies were made very unpopular by the Québec Regime media in English Canada, since the biggest backer of Trudeau, Mulroney, Chrétien and Martin over the years, namely Paul Desmarais, “controls some seven daily newspapers in Québec and Ontario.”²⁰ The Empire of Desmarais had a hand therefore in the downfall of the conservative government of Ontario: Desmarais thus helped to bring Paul Martin to power, as well as the Québec Regime in Queen’s Park (McGuinty, Wynne and so forth), which eventually increased nearly threefold the provincial debt of Ontario, costing Ontarians more taxes, and giving them less services.\n\nHow many Canadians died in the 1990’s because they did not get the proper medical treatment they deserved when they needed it the most? They were the sick and elderly of the generation that supported conservatism in Ontario and Québec before the advent of the Québec Regime in Ottawa and Empire of Desmarais.\n\nThe same policy was ruthlessly followed by Roy Romanow in Saskatchewan (another puppet of the Québec Regime), the main victims being the Old-Timers who founded the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, the generation of Tommy Douglas and Woodrow Lloyd, the bastion of anti-Liberalism in Western Canada:\n\n“The new minister delivered a tough budget … With a cumulative public debt of $14.9 billion and a population in which less than one–third of 1 million people pay income tax, prospects for revenue growth were dim … Saskatchewan, which introduced the first medicare (public health care) system in North America … planned to reduce the number of hospital beds from 7,284 to 4,300.”²¹\n\nExact historiography proves the Old–Timers who founded the Co–operative Commonwealth Federation, the generation of Tommy Douglas and Woodrow Lloyd, the bastion of anti–Liberalism in Western Canada, were sacrificed upon the altar of Québec Regime fédéralisme asymétrique:\n\n“In an article entitled ‘Why Equalization No Longer Works,’ former Finance Minister Joe Oliver reviews several fundamental problems associated with equalization and questions whether this massive government program meets its original goal and still achieves a legitimate public purpose. He concludes by noting that current economic circumstances cry out for ‘a major overhaul of a decades old equalization program that is past its best before date’ … Québec, for example, has been able, at least in part due to the equalization subsidies from other Canadians which this year topped $10 billion, to support provincial programming that is much more accessible to residents in that province than elsewhere. Statistics Canada reported that the weighted average undergraduate tuition fees for full–time students in Québec is less than half the Alberta figure. The Globe and Mail also reported that average monthly fees for full–day daycare for toddlers in Québec was $152 in 2012. The corresponding figures were $825 for Alberta and $925 for Ontario, the highest of all provinces.”²²\n\nHistoriasters at the schools of the Québec Regime (Janice MacKinnon and company) tell another tale because their snouts are in the trough.²³\n\nThe Québec Regime “Left” in Ottawa hands out the goodies to the Québec Inc, namely the Lion’s Share of federal employment, infrastructure and public works projects, and (unconstitutional) equalization payments. When the debt crunch finally comes, as in 1995, the Québec Regime “Right” arrives upon the scene and makes the cuts, which means they sweep the sick and elderly into the dustbin of history. Adolf Hitler’s economic policy in the 1930’s greatly enriched the ruling class of Germany and employed many Germans, but mutatis mutandis this is no rational argument for the benevolence of Nazidom.\n\nThis folly is called “centrism” or governing from the center, by Québec Regimers like Paul Martin Junior, which means that all anti–Québec Regime politics and economics is attacked as non–centrist. It goes without saying that the Québec Regimers are neither Liberals nor Conservatives, in the traditional meaning of the terms inherited from Great Britain and the United States of America, but are really nothing more than a gang of crooks.²⁴\n\nThe Québec Regime in Ottawa and Empire of Desmarais has robbed Western Canadians of some $1–Trillion in (unconstitutional) equalization over the years (compound interest included), which belongs in the Western economy, putting Westerners to work, building up Western Canadian finance, commerce and industry, especially in Alberta and Saskatchewan.\n\nThe Québec Regime in Ottawa and Empire of Desmarais has also robbed Ontarians of some $1–Trillion in (unconstitutional) equalization over the years (compound interest included), which belongs in the economy of Ontario, putting Ontarians to work, building up finance, commerce and industry in Ontario.\n\nAnother example of the political and economic satanism of the Quebec Regime in Ottawa and Empire of Paul Desmarais:\n\n“History shows there are two ways societies can deal with diversity of opinion and behavior … The objective was to ‘take the Indian out of the child,’ and thus to solve what John A. Macdonald referred to as the ‘Indian problem.’ ‘Indianness’ was not to be tolerated; rather it must be eliminated. In the buzz-word of the day, assimilation; in the language of the 21st century, cultural genocide.”²⁵\n\nExact historiography and world history proves there are many different ways that societies have dealt with diversity of opinion and behavior in the past. The historical objective of Sir John A. MacDonald and the Government of Canada was not to “take the Indian out of the child,” to solve what was referred to as the “Indian problem” and commit what modern irrationalists like Beverley McLachlin name “cultural genocide.”\n\nCanadian Indians and “Indianness” were greatly tolerated in most parts of Canada, as the historical evidence demonstrates: Our population has always intermingled to an extraordinary degree. Assimilation and the assimilation of Indians and “Indianness” in the exact historiography and history of Canada is not therefore, and never was, cultural genocide: The so-called notion of culture advanced by Beverley McLachlin and her clique of irrationalists at the Supreme Court of Canada, the basis of fédéralisme asymétrique, is a Kantian delusion.\n\nBeverley, dear, how many Canadian “Indians” across Canada are either dead or suffering from very serious health problems, men, women, children, elderly, even babies, caused by the toxic waste dumps of the Québec Regime in Ottawa and Empire of Paul Desmarais (your very good friends): A human and environmental catastrophe which is costing Canadian taxpayers more than $4-billion to clean-up (as well as the yet uncalculated $Billions in First Nations and aboriginal healthcare costs)? Kitty-cat got your tongue, Beverley dear? So much for justice and human rights under the Québec Regime in Ottawa and Empire of Paul Desmarais.\n\nBobby Rae wrecked the New Democratic Party for Jean Chrétien and Pierre Trudeau: It was love at first sight, when Jean-Jacques first laid his eyes upon angelic Bobby and his brother floating down the ski slopes of Europe back in the 1960’s.²⁶ Of course Pierre got in on the action: Rae syndrome spread like syphilis amongst careerists and opportunists alike; Bobby’s pygmies soon controlled the uppermost echelons of the NDP in Ottawa and across Canada.\n\nSince that time, and without exception, at least until the rise of former Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Western conservatism, the leaders of every Liberal and New Democratic regime have been the creatures of the Quebec Regime in Ottawa and Empire of Paul Desmarais, because it is a degenerate ruling class:\n\n“Premier Robert K. Rae, head of the New Democratic Party (NDP) government, went on television on January 21 to announce stiff restraints on government spending. Increases in provincial allowances for hospitals, schools, and municipalities were to be limited to 1 per cent for fiscal 1992–1993 and to 2 per cent for each of the next two years … On January 22, Ontario purchased a 49 per cent equity interest in de Havilland, an aircraft manufacturer and subsidiary of Boeing Company of Seattle, for $49 million ($39.9 million U.S.) and pledged another $300 million ($240 million U.S.) in subsidies. Bombardier Incorporated of Quebec purchased a controlling interest in the company.”²⁷\n\nSince the rise of Bobby Rae, until the advent of Stephen Harper, the Ford Nation, and Western conservatism, whether under Mike Harcourt in British Columbia or Roy Romanow in Saskatchewan, in the provinces the New Democratic Party has been firmly controlled by the Québec Regime. We must ask ourselves, therefore, Does Bobby Keith Rae suffer deeply from the affliction of flabby mindedness? He nearly bankrupted Ontario according to Peter Charles Newman.²⁸\n\nAt the same time in Ottawa and the provinces, the Liberal Party was firmly in the hands of the Chrétien family pulp and paper oligarchy, thanks to the selfsame vermin, whether in Ontario under Peterson, in Québec under Bourassa, in New Brunswick under McKenna, in Prince Edward Island under Ghiz, and under Wells in Newfoundland. Socialists and Liberals alike sold their souls to the corrupt oligarchy: The proof is in their attributions of massive federal and provincial public works and infrastructure contracts and in their control over the vast resource monopolies of Canadian crown lands. Nearly all infrastructure and equalization payments over the years have profited by far the backwards monopolies, outdated cartels and corrupt trusts of the Québec Regime, which uses nationalism and socialism (la “Francophonie”) as a weapon to advance the financial, commercial and industrial power of the Québec Inc, which is composed of the largest labour movement and unions in Canada, namely, the Fédération des travailleurs et travailleuses du Québec and the Confédération des syndicats nationaux.\n\nYet the selfsame vampire oligarchy is wrecking Canadian finance, commerce and industry in the world of today. All these things are known to many Canadians. They are silent in fear of the bread line, soup kitchen and flop house. And rightly so. My creed is the philosophy of American Idealism: The Western establishment must govern in both Ottawa and the provinces, — in the name of rational political and economic order in Canada. The burdensome taxation, the greatest part of which falls upon English Canada, in the form of unconstitutional federal equalization payments (the Québécocracy has never signed the constitution), of which the Québec Regime always receives more than 50 per cent, must end with legislation passed under the Notwithstanding Clause, once the criminal ruling class is undone.\n\nLiberal Party and New Democratic Party sweet talkers, first and foremost, serve the interests of the Québec Regime in Ottawa, especially under Thomas Mulcair, at least when it comes to the important question of who gets the biggest cut: Under Québec Regime domination (whether right, left, or center), the Québec Inc always gets the Lion’s Share. No more! At least not since the reorganization of the American world initiated by President Trump. The Eastern Establishment under the Québec Regime in Ottawa and Empire of Desmarais, has been completely corrupted by the modern European political and economic irrationalism of the criminal ruling class.\n\nFor this reason, amongst others, the worse mass murderer in the history of Canada tortured and killed some fifty Canadian women (perhaps more) over the span of a decade, while the Québec Regime in Ottawa and Victoria did absolutely nothing to stop the carnage. The proof? They had information on the killer all along, but allowed the monster to roam free. Liberalism shut down the bloodbath and then trumpeted the feat far and wide in order to fill its putrid maw with caviar and filet mignon. Bravo! Why did the federal Liberals under Jean Chrétien, whose family is now one of the richest in Canada (Forbes), sit on their hands for ten years in the first place? Because they are the selfsame Québec Regime, the selfsame inferior ruling class.\n\nDid Premier Mike Harcourt and his insects rise to the top of the New Democratic Party without the assistance and intervention of the Québec Regime in Victoria? Not at all.²⁹ Every provincial and federal Liberal and New Democratic Party leaders, especially since the rise of Bobby Rae and his brother,³⁰ who is now a board member of Power Corporation, have always been the creatures of the Québec Regime in Ottawa and Empire of Desmarais; the Québécocracy is now, since the death of Big Paul, a Bombardier ruling class:\n\n“Pierre Beaudoin is also the premier vice-president and board member of Bombardier Corporation. In effect, direct relations exist between all the board members of Power Corporation, as well as with Pierre Beaudoin, and all the board members of Bombardier Corporation … As with Paul Desmarais Senior, Laurent Beaudoin is one of the most renowned businessmen in all of Québec: Not only is he famous as the leader of one of the most well-known companies in Québec, he was also deeply involved in politics and the political intrigues of the past thirty years.”³¹\n\nOn many occasions, I have spoken to powerful politicians (and their emissaries) around the country over the years (whether they heed my words I cannot say): Canada should invest far more public works and infrastructure dollars in American finance, commerce and industry (which employs many millions of Canadians) because the vast political and economic advancement of Americanism (Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Netflix) is far superior to the meager profits of the Québec Inc.\n\nAnother example: In Canada under the Québec Regime in Ottawa, nearly all dairy production is controlled by the Québec Inc., namely Saputo (Dairyland), Parmalat, Agropur, Lactantia, and so forth, a practice long named “supply management” by Québec Regime puppets like Andrew Coyne (Cité Libre) in the English Canadian press.³² It is the brain-child of men like Lino Saputo, perhaps the biggest backer of Jean Chrétien and the Liberal Party over the years, and now one of the 10 richest men in Canada according to Forbes.³³\n\nThe Québec Inc uses ultra-high temperature sterilization (UHT) to pasteurize Canadian milk, rendering it useless for homemade cheese, cottage cheese, good yogurt and other dairy products. Of course, the Québec Inc cheese is made of low-temperature pasteurized milk and even raw milk.\n\nThe Québec Regime has established its puppets in the capital cities of every Canadian province over the years, in order to bribe or coerce local municipal, provincial and federal politicians and their family members: Thus the Québec Regime in Ottawa and Empire of Desmarais always gets the Lion’s Share of all federal government employment,³⁴ all public works and infrastructure projects in Canada and abroad (Francophonie, etc), as well as all (unconstitutional) federal equalization payments (the Québec Regime has never signed the Chrétien-Trudeau constitution).³⁵ The creatures of the Québec Regime also ensure that legislation is passed in the provinces (as well as Ottawa) that protects the backwards cartels, outdated monopolies and corrupt trusts of the Québec Inc. Raw milk, which is used to make cheese, is thus banned in nearly all of Canada.\n\nHow many Canadian children were malnourished over the past 50 years because their families could not afford to put milk, butter, cheese and eggs on their breakfast tables every morning? Today, some four million Canadians in Québec live in poverty (merci Messieurs Trudeau, Mulroney, Chrétien and Martin). How many Canadian families were malnourished over the years because of the political and economic satanism of Lino Saputo and the Québec Regime in Ottawa 1968–2006?\n\nAccording to the Charbonneau Commission of Montréal, organised crime long ago infiltrated the construction industry, and the ruling class of Québec was financed by this corruption. In other words, the Québec Regime was greatly enriched by the proceeds of organised crime. Over many decades organised crime in Montréal laundered drug money in the Québec construction industry. Therefore, proceeds of the heroin traffic from the Port of Montréal and the Saint Lawrence Seaway greatly enriched the ruling class of Québec. Blood money is therefore at the foundation of the Québec Regime in Ottawa and Empire of Paul Desmarais. Monsieur Martin, how many young people in Canada and the United States, as well as their families, were systematically ruined and destroyed by the political and economic satanism of the Québec Regime in Ottawa and Empire of Desmarais?\n\nDo the families of the many thousands of victims of the Québec Regime in Ottawa deserve financial compensation for the horrific deaths of their loved ones, and for their losses, pain and suffering inflicted over the years? If your child dies a horrible death from heroin addiction and drug overdose, because evil politicians allow powerful Montréal crime bosses to roam free for many years, what do you do? Junior always ran in a Québec riding, and he was very closely associated with the ruling class of Québec for a half century: Yet he knew absolutely nothing of the massive political and economic corruption in the Québec construction industry and the money laundering links to Montréal organised crime? Remember the infamous mafia overlord Rizzuto, who got a bullet in his neck, and who was the biggest and most deadly crime boss in the history of Canada, perhaps even North America, and who in his day was as powerful as the New York bosses.\n\nPaul Martin Junior is either mentally defective, otherwise he is in cahoots with organised crime (otherwise he is mentally defective and in cahoots with organised crime), — as is proved by his rôle in the Tainted–Blood Scandal. How do you get involved with politicians and politics and then become a billionaire in 20 years? You cut corners … How much dope came into Canada on the ships of Paul Martin and Canada Steamship Lines under the Québec Regime in Ottawa and Empire of Paul Desmarais, — and from thence into America?\n\nFor nearly a half century Alberta tried to get its oil pipelines directly to Toronto and Montréal, and thereby decrease the cost of gasoline in eastern Canada: An excellent policy for Canadian productivity. The Western establishment and its energy projects were systematically and ruthlessly sabotaged by the Québec Regime in Ottawa and Empire of Desmarais. Meanwhile, for 30 years or more Paul Martin Junior made very good profits shipping Arab oil to eastern Canada. Canada is the only oil producing country in the world that has always imported the majority of its domestic oil consumption from foreign sources: A very bad policy for Canadian productivity. In Canadian history, the name of Paul Martin Junior is synonymous with the political and economic retardation of Canada.\n\nCanada was hanging by the fingertips from the edge of annihilation in the 1995 Referendum, the work of five centuries was being undone: Who knows how many would have perished in the conflagration? Perhaps an entire generation would have been lost: The vampire demon of modern political and economic unreason was opening its bloodthirsty maw. One wrong move and the whole power keg would blow: The daggers and bayonets were coming out … around the corner a mighty historical catastrophe awaited Canada. The Golden Streets of this Canadian Paradise would be awash in rivers of blood. Meanwhile, the Sponsorship criminals were busy cutting Canada’s lifeline and filling their pockets with cash … Paul Martin and his associates cut Canada’s lifeline in the Québec Referendum.\n\nThe entire list of the monstrous crimes of the Québec Regime in Ottawa and Empire of Desmarais cannot be summarized with complete certainty until the Government of Canada makes the archives of Trudeau, Mulroney, Chrétien and Martin known to the public. But it is important that we should form a provisional judgement of the historical nature of the Québec Regime in Ottawa and Empire of Desmarais from such material as is available. For this step is a necessary phase in the renovation of our political and economic institutions and in the aggrandizement of Canada and the Canadian People: Only by this insight into the political and economic necessity of such a recovery can our civilization be rescued from the shameful financial, commercial and industrial decay in which we are immersed at the present time.\n\n3 — Empire of Desmarais and the Québécocracy: The Quiet Revolution and Asymmetrical Federalism (Politique fonctionnelle)\n\nToday, the province of Québec is a “Have-Not” region, like Ontario and Eastern Canada, because of the political and economic irrationalism of the Québec Regime in Ottawa:\n\n“If Québec’s taxation rates remain unchanged and the historical trends of actual per capita program spending are maintained, the Québec government is headed for deep fiscal trouble. The Conference Board estimates that by the end of fiscal 2030–2031, the Québec government would post an annual deficit of $45 billion — this, despite an assumed continued increase in federal transfer payments.”³⁶\n\nPaul Desmarais, Jean–Louis Lévesque, and the Québécocracy³⁷ first wrecked the finance, commerce and industry of Québec in the 1960’s by destroying the political and economic foundations of Duplessis and the Union nationale, — which unchained the Quiet revolution:\n\n“The rising power of Québec in the last few years is a truly amazing story in the history of French-Canada. We must control this movement and not hinder our progress: We must avoid a dead-end; we must follow the right road; and we must lay the rational foundations for the upcoming power struggles … We now know, after the last Budget Speech, this year Québec will get $362,740,000.00 in various federal equalization payments, compared to the $66 million in 1962. Québec has therefore won the taxation war in Ottawa.”³⁸\n\nThe Quiet revolution and Empire of Paul Desmarais are the political and economic foundations of asymmetrical federalism (politique fonctionnelle) in Canada.\n\nPaul Desmarais in his lifetime is a phantom: “The influence of Paul Desmarais is everywhere, while he remains invisible: The man seems to fear the light of day.”³⁹ In 1985 his fortune is estimated at around $500-Million: By 2008 Desmarais’ fortune has increased tenfold and is thought to be some $5-Billion.⁴⁰\n\n“By the time he handed daily operations of the company to his sons in 1996, Desmarais had seen Power’s assets increase to $2.7 billion, from $165 million. Net earnings increased to $209 million from $3 million, and the market value of the company’s shares increased from $61 million to $2.6 billion, for a compounded annual return of 16.4 per cent. Canadian Business magazine ranked Desmarais as the wealthiest Québécker and Canada’s seventh wealthiest person, with a fortune estimated at $4.4 billion.”⁴¹\n\nThe words of Paul Desmarais speak for themselves: “Canada is my country. Québec is my province.”⁴² Paul Desmarais is a French chauvinist: “French Canadians have not been able to think of the long-term in business because they’ve had no economic power: This must change.”⁴³ The exact historiography of the Franco-Canadian people proves that they have possessed political and economic power in Canada and North America for centuries: French chauvinists, on the other hand, have not possessed very much political and economic power until the advent of the Quiet revolution and Empire of Desmarais.\n\nWhat begins as the Quiet revolution, “Maître Chez Nous,” in the collapse of Franco-Canadian conservatism under Maurice Duplessis and the Union nationale at the hands of Jean Lesage and the federal and provincial Liberals, ends with the rape of Québec at the hands of Paul Desmarais and his Empire: “Les Québécois ont connu la Révolution tranquille. L’Empire Desmarais leur mijote la Dépossession tranquille.”⁴⁴ In other words, “the ruling class of Québec greatly enriched Paul Desmarais and his family over the years.”⁴⁵\n\nJean Lesage creates the Société Générale de Financement, and with René Lévesque, nationalizes the electrical companies of Québec. After the deaths of Duplessis, Sauvé and Johnson, and the destruction of the Union nationale in the Quiet Revolution, the greatest part of all Canadian political and economic power in Québec falls into the hands of Paul Desmarais and the Québécocracy: “The interests of Paul Desmarais are everywhere in Québec: His influence at the Caisse is well known.”⁴⁶\n\n“Paul Desmarais is not a builder, he is but an animal, a rapist, a wolf in sheep’s clothing: Over the years Desmarais has learned that it is much easier to hoodwink the Good Shepard, and to thereby prey upon the flock, rather than struggle constantly against the powers that be … The whole of Québec discovered the truly vile and depraved character of Paul Desmarais, when he and Michael Sabia, the president of the Québec Pension Plan, were seen together, as two love birds in a gilded cage, in that vast and luxurious palace of Sagard: At that instant the scales fell from our eyes, and we understood the nature of Desmarais’ diabolism, and we perceived how our National Assembly, the ministers of our parliament, our highest officials, and our institutions of government, had all become the puppets of Paul Desmarais.”⁴⁷\n\nThe Empire of Paul Desmarais and the Québécocracy is the result of massive political and economic corruption, beginning under Jean Lesage and the Québec Liberal Party, and continuing after the death of Daniel Johnson under both federalist and anti-federalist leaders in Québec:\n\n“The enormous wealth Paul Desmarais thus accumulated could only be obtained through his patronage of government officials and his influence in Québec politics: That is the history of Desmarais’ takeover of Gelco (Gatineau Electric), later Gesca, and also Power Corporation, which received huge subsidies over the years from the Québec Government.”55\n\nThe Empire of Paul Desmarais was first built upon Crown Lands controlled by his political friends in the Liberal Government of Québec: “Consolidated-Bathurst, the crown jewel of the Québec pulp and paper industry, benefited from very generous subsidies from Québec taxpayers over the years.”⁴⁸\n\n“In the largest financial transaction in Canadian history, Paul Desmarais sold Consolidated-Bathurst, the crown jewel of the Québec pulp and paper industry, which had benefited from very generous subsidies from Québec taxpayers over the years, for $2.6-billion to American investors. The sale of Montréal Trust later followed for some $550-million: Thus, Paul Desmarais ripped-off (arrachés) $3-billion in natural resources from the hard-working people of Québec.”⁴⁹\n\nIn other words, Paul Desmarais was one of the main backers of the Québec Liberal Party, and he was repaid with Crown Lands by Québec federalist and anti-federalist politicians like Jean Lesage, René Lévesque and Robert Bourassa.⁵⁰ (Lévesque anti-federalist in 1960) “The dominion of Paul Desmarais and Power Corporation influences the constitutional, economic and social developments of Québec, and will continue in future governments.”⁵¹\n\nMy detractors will undoubtedly turn away from these writings, — and level the charge of ideology: When has the Constitution of the United States of America ever been named as ideology, in the sense of Stalinism, Hitlerism and Maoism? If the signers of the US Constitution are ideologues, then we are in very good company. If our adversaries mean we are ideologists in the pejorative sense of the word, then they place themselves squarely in the camp of anti–Americanism, and the dustbin of history …\n\nChapter 1: Philpot’s Argument and the Corrupt Legacy of Paul Desmarais\n\nQuebec journalist and author Robin Philpot wrote a scathing attack upon Paul Desmarais and his corrupt legacy.¹ Desmarais had recently died, and great praise was being heaped upon the deceased, for all the amazing things he had supposedly done for Quebec. Few people, however, realized what Quebec and the National Assembly had done for Paul Desmarais: The ruling-class of Quebec had greatly enriched Paul Desmarais and his family.²\n\nAccording to Robin Philpot, the destiny of Paul Desmarais and his wealthy family would have been very different without the involvement of the government of Quebec over the years, which according to a famous contemporary, aspires to be a country and not merely a province: “French-Canadians who feel threatened always turn to Quebec,” Desmarais once said. “It’s our mentality.”³ Is this the secret behind the enormous wealth of Paul Desmarais and his family, that he was a persecuted French-Canadian businessman who needed government assistance in order to succeed in life? If Desmarais was so persecuted as a French-Canadian, then who were his persecutors? We know very well where this traditional sophistical reasoning leads in Canadian politics and economics.\n\nCanadian establishmentarian journalists like Peter Charles Newman and Diane Francis have characterized the meteoric rise of Paul Desmarais in the 1960’s to the fact that he was “politically correct and a French-Canadian,” namely an arch-federalist capable of protecting the national interests of Canada and the Canadian ruling-class from the evils of the Quebec independence movement: This analysis, according to Robin Philpot, is fallacious, and is completely at odds with the real political and economic legacy of Paul Desmarais.⁴\n\n1 — Paul Desmarais and Power Corporation\n\nPaul Desmarais was never an entrepreneur: “Starting at the bottom takes far too long … I have never done anything from scratch.” Desmarais was the builder of a financial empire based entirely upon the constant influx of easy money, which was quickly turned into a vast fortune. The enormous wealth Desmarais thus accumulated could only be obtained through his patronage of government and his influence in Quebec politics: That is the history of Desmarais’ take over of Gelco (Gatineau Electric), later Gesca, and also Power Corporation, which received huge subsidies over the years from the Quebec Government.⁵ After his take over of Power Corporation and the Montreal newspaper La Presse, the notion of the Empire of Desmarais first appeared, when the young Liberal deputy Yves Michaud sounded the alarm at the Quebec National Assembly:\n\n“If this problem is not corrected by a very serious inquiry on the part of elected officials, in accordance with the laws of our Assembly, the Desmarais oligarchy will threaten the power of our Parliament: Does the dangerous nature of this situation require even further proof? Will not this oligarchy eventually usurp the sovereign will of our representatives, and even our Prime Minister? … At this very moment, the Gelco-Trans-Canada Group [controlled by Paul Desmarais] is seeking to further acquire Le Soleil Newspaper, the readership of which is more than 175, 000 people, as well as the daily newspaper Le Droit d’Ottawa, which has a readership of some 45, 000 people.” ⁶\n\nDespite the patriotic eloquence of Yves Michaud, nobody in Quebec really seemed to care …\n\n2 — The Financial Empire of Desmarais: The Quebec Inc\n\nDesmarais always cultivated very close political and economic connexions with provincial and federal elites, so that every Premier of Quebec and Prime Minister of Canada, at least since the time of Maurice Duplessis, used to “eat from his hand.”⁷ Yet, in the eyes of Robin Philpot, the anti-federalist Premiers of Quebec, René Lévesque and Jacques Parizeau, were never the creatures of Paul Desmarais.\n\nMuch has been written on the political and economic relations between Paul Desmarais and Jean-Louis Lévesque: “Jean-Louis Lévesque, the Montreal financier from far-away Gaspé, ‘knew first-hand the difficulties that awaited a French-Canadian in business, and therefore he took the young Paul Desmarais under his wing, and led him into the realm of French-Canadian high finance.’”⁸ As for Jacques Parizeau, he was the Premier of Quebec only for a relatively short period of time before being replaced by Lucien Bouchard, leader of the Second Quebec Referendum: Premier Bouchard did have political and economic affiliations with Brian Mulroney and Paul Desmarais: “Brian Mulroney and Lucien Bouchard used to talk about the meetings they had together at the Élysée with President François Mitterrand and Paul Desmarais.”⁹\n\nAccording to Robin Philpot, not only did Paul Desmarais make investors flee from Quebec in the 1990’s during the administration of Robert Bourassa, but in 1989, in the largest financial transaction in Canadian history, Desmarais sold Consolidated-Bathurst, the crown jewel of the Quebec pulp and paper industry, which had benefited from very generous subsidies from tax-payers over the years, for $2.6 billion to American investors.¹⁰ The sale of Montréal Trust later followed for some $550 million: Thus, Paul Desmarais ripped-off (arrachés) $3 billion in natural resources from the hard-working people of Quebec.¹¹\n\n3 — The Quebec Regime in Ottawa, 1968–2006\n\nAccording to journalist and author Robin Philpot, Paul Desmarais was probably the most corrupt businessman in Canadian history, and therefore he was also a very big crook.¹²\n\nDefenders of Desmarais such as Marc Jussaume, who attack the credibility and honesty of Robin Philpot, assert that since Desmarais paid his taxes in Quebec, he was not therefore a very corrupt businessman: “Paul Desmarais decided to live in Montréal, and the Charlevoix, and for that reason Power Corporation has remained a Quebec taxpayer. What is the bad-faith of Philpot’s attack? Philpot accuses Paul Desmarais of being the most corrupt Quebec businessman.”¹³\n\nBut apart from his existentialist critique of Philpot’s bad-faith (a phrase popularized by Jean-Paul Sartre and his Parisian counter-culture followers in the 1960’s), Jussaume advances no further information on the exact amount of taxes the Empire of Paul Desmarais and Power Corporation has actually paidin Quebec over the years: Paul Desmarais, according to Robin Philpot, was probably the most corrupt businessman in Canadian history, but he also undoubtedly paid some taxes.\n\nJussaume also accuses Robin Philpot of tendentiousness and hyperbole: “The problem is that the nationalization of hydro-electricity started in 1962–1963, and was completed in 1964–1965. The investors who sold their companies to Desmarais essentially sold him bank accounts, and he did not receive any liquidity. Paul Desmarais was therefore not part of the nationalizations.”¹⁴\n\nOf course, this “problem” certainly depends very much on what exactly Jussaume means by the “nationalizations” of hydro-electricity, and also on his divisions and sub-divisions of the historical chronology of Quebec’s political and economic history, matters of exact historiography upon which he and many others are silent. Once the exact historiography of Canada in the last half of the 20th century is very well known, and also exonerates Paul Desmarais and the Quebec Regime in Ottawa of their monstrous political and economic corruption, then Marc Jussaume and his friends can fit their defense of Desmarais into the appropriate chapter, — if the day ever comes.¹⁵\n\nAccording to Jussaume, “after the initial purchase of Power Corporation in 1968, which held 18% of Consolidated-Bathurst, the latter company lost a lot of money, but instead of selling Consolidated-Bathurst, Paul Desmarais increased his shares to 42%, and then he took over. Only afterwards did Consolidated-Bathurst become very profitable.”¹⁶\n\nSays Robin Philpot in rebuttal: The enormous wealth Paul Desmarais accumulated over the years could only be obtained through his patronage of government and his influence in Quebec politics, because every Premier of Quebec and Prime Minister of Canada, at least since the time of Maurice Duplessis, used to “eat from his hand.”¹⁷ No wonder then that Consolidated-Bathurst became “very profitable” under the control of Paul Desmarais and his family.\n\nRobin Philpot’s charge against Paul Desmarais is straightforward: The vast fortune Desmarais accumulated over the years could only be obtained through his patronage of government and his influence in politics: “All the Premiers of Quebec and Prime Ministers of Canada, since the time of Maurice Duplessis … used to eat from his hand.”¹⁸ In other words, Paul Desmarais was a very big crook.¹⁹\n\nThe political and economic inclinations of Robin Philpot are not here in question.²⁰ The historical and philosophical question at hand is whether or not Paul Desmarais was an extremely corrupt businessman, and therefore the biggest crook in Canadian history. Robin Philpot advances a number of instances in support of his historical argument: Unless his examples of Paul Desmarais’ corrupt legacy are demonstrably false, the argument of Philpot stands, and the conclusion is therefore irresistible.\n\nThe political and economic consequences of Philpot’s argument are of great interest with regards to the historical development of the rational conception of Canada and its actualization in the world of today: By far, the Empire of Paul Desmarais, namely, Power Corporation and the Quebec Inc, was the main backer of the Quebec Regime in Ottawa, 1968–2006, when Canada was ruled by Quebeckers for nearly a half century, except for one year under Kim Campbell, Joe Clark and John Turner:\n\n“Claude Frenette, the right hand man of Paul Desmarais … was elected as president of the Quebec wing of the Liberal Party of Canada in virtue of the upcoming leadership race: Frenette and Pierre Trudeau elaborated a scheme at Power Corporation whereby the latter would become the new leader of the Liberal Party and then the Prime Minister of Canada.”²¹\n\nCHAPTER 2: TRUDEAU PHILOLOGY AND TRUDEAUISME\n\nDialectics of action drive us toward the imperialistic concentration of our powers upon a single objective: Democracy … I believe that statism (dirigisme) is necessary in order to maximize our Liberty.\n\nPierre Elliott Trudeau¹\n\n[We] secretly followed in the footsteps of Paul Desmarais, and we utterly failed the Québec taxpayers. Sadly enough, the losers are not the wealthy investors, but rather Québéckers themselves are impoverished.\n\nPierre Arbour²\n\nFor Canadians, the adoption of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 1982 marks the birth of modern–day Canada. Jean–François Lisée³\n\nThe wars of the French Revolution marked the transition to the nation–state defined by common language and culture … [The United States of America] have never been nation–states in the European sense. America has succeeded in forming a distinct culture from a polyglot national composition.\n\nHenry Kissinger⁴\n\nIn the last half of the 20th century, during the Quiet revolution, Canada and the Canadian people turned a blind–eye to the mortal corruption of the Québec régime in Ottawa and Empire of Paul Desmarais: Their eyes were blinded by “Canadian culture,” namely propaganda from the backwards cartels, outdated monopolies and corrupt trusts of the Québécocracy, in this case the media empire of Paul Desmarais, — and protected (protectionnisme) in Ottawa as a central cogwheel of the White Gold (Hydro–Québec) ruling class. Canadians were assisted in their ignorance of the true state of affairs in Ottawa by the many ideological productions of the Québécocracy, which were passed–off over the years by the creatures of the White Gold ruling class, in the guise of exact historiography. The defenders of the White Gold ruling class, and their publishing conglomerates, received cheap paper and newsprint over the decades from their control of Crown Lands, and many of their adversaries, without this massive government support (investissement), were driven out of business, otherwise moved south.\n\nOne of the main areas of the ideological endeavors of the White Gold élites, is found in the masking of the satanism of the Québécocracy, the mortal corruption at the very basis of its 1968 seizure of power in Ottawa, and the diabolism behind its political and economic domination:\n\n“Claude Frenette, the right hand man of Paul Desmarais … was elected as president of the Québec wing of the Liberal Party of Canada in virtue of the upcoming leadership race: Frenette and Pierre Trudeau elaborated a scheme at the Power Corporation whereby the latter would become the new leader of the Liberal Party and then the Prime Minister of Canada.”⁵\n\nPeter Charles Newman, the well–known Canadian historian, says in his work on How the New Canadian Establishment Seized Power:\n\n“One of Desmarais’ favorite collectibles is Pierre Trudeau, who remains on Power Corp.’s international advisory board … plans for Trudeau’s candidacy had first been hatched in early 1968 at the offices of Power Corporation, at Friday–night meetings presided over by then–Power vice–president Claude Frenette. In August of that year, two months after Trudeau swept the country, the new PM flew to visit Desmarais at Murray Bay.”⁶\n\nThe Empire of Paul Desmarais was the main backer of the Québec régime in Ottawa, 1968–2006:\n\n“In 1972, Desmarais hired Mulroney as negotiator during a labour dispute at his paper La Presse. In apparent appreciation of Mulroney’s work, Desmarais became Mulroney’s biggest financial backer, starting with his leadership bid in 1976. Mulroney confirmed the relationship after becoming Prime Minister. In September 1990, Mulroney appointed John Sylvain, Desmarais’s brother–in–law to the Senate, one of eight controversial appointments that ensured the passage of the Goods and Services Tax. In June 1993, Mulroney appointed Desmarais’s brother, Jean Noël Desmarais, to the Senate as part of a flurry of patronage appointments. Now Mulroney has returned to work for Power Corporation’s long–time law firm, Ogilvy Renault.”⁷\n\n“[Jean Chrétien] gave his niece a job in the PMO and appointed his nephew Raymond as ambassador to Washington … His son–in–law, André Desmarais (married to Chrétien’s daughter, France), was awarded a billion–dollar contract to operate a satellite–TV network over the objections of federal regulators … [Jean Chrétien] cut welfare and social service payments to 1950s levels and reneged on his election promises to increase immigration, support cultural sovereignty or allow more free votes in the Commons.”⁸\n\n“Just after he graduated from University of Toronto Law School in 1966 at age twenty–eight, he [Paul Martin Junior] joined Power Corporation of Québec. Martin was hired by Maurice Strong, former assistant to Paul Desmarais Sr., … Paul Desmarais began running the company the next year, and within three years he had appointed Martin vice–president … Paul Martin will be the fourth politician this Québec billionaire has groomed for or financially assisted into being prime minister.”⁹\n\nPeter Charles Newman: “No businessman in Canadian history has ever had more intimate and more extended influence with Canadian prime ministers than Desmarais.”¹⁰ In other words, “The making and breaking of governments in Québec and Canada is the prerogative of the Empire of Paul Desmarais: This has been going on for some 40 years.”¹¹\n\nWhat is the political and economic relationship between Paul Desmarais and the White Gold ruling class?\n\n“Jean–Louis Lévesque, the Montréal financier from far–away Gaspé, ‘knew first–hand the difficulties that awaited a French–Canadian in business, and therefore he took the young Paul Desmarais under his wing, and led him into the realm of French–Canadian high finance … the Lévesque which most Canadians have heard about is the great orator, René, the Minister of Natural Resources of the Province of Québec. Jean–Louis Lévesque is his wealthy distant cousin, who owns the largest financial empire in Québec.’”¹²\n\nJean–Louis Lévesque, Paul Desmarais, and the backers of Jean Lesage are the figures that lurk behind the rise of the Quiet revolution and the birth of the Québécocracy, wrought by the deaths of Maurice Duplessis, Paul Sauvé and Daniel Johnson:\n\nJean Lesage (5 August 1958): “All that matters to me is that we find, in the very near future, a means which will allow us to combine our forces, in order to crush forever the Duplessis machine.”¹³\n\nThe arena of federal politics and economics, under the Québec régime in Ottawa and Empire of Paul Desmarais 1968–2006, is therefore the bastion of the White Gold (Hydro–Québec) ruling class:\n\n“Hydro–Quebec, a provincial Crown Corporation, is Canada’s largest electric utility and, judged by assets ($25 billion in 1983), Canada’s largest corporation … First created as a legal entity in 1944, Hydro–Québec did not become a major force until the early 1960s. René Lévesque then resources minister to the Liberal government of Jean Lesage, oversaw the nationalization of the province’s larger private electrical utilities. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Parti Québécois governments led by Lévesque further reorganized Hydro–Québec. The utility enjoys formidable economic advantages: Once dams are in place, operating costs are very low; furthermore, it has a contract to buy power from the Churchill Falls project in Labrador at 1969 prices until the year 2041. Hydro–Québec can thus underbid Ontario Hydro in the US export market, provide cheap power within Québec and still pay a dividend to the provincial government.”¹⁴\n\nThe rise of the White Gold ruling class (“nouvelle classe de parvenus”) under the Québec régime in Ottawa and Empire of Paul Desmarais, and inscribed within the conceptual realm of 20th century world history as the collapse of European modernity and the rise of Americanism, is therefore in very large part the result of souveraineté, indépendance, séparatisme and other abstractions, first rigorously elaborated by Pierre Trudeau, René Lévesque, Jacques Parizeau, Pierre Vallières and many others at Cité Libre, — the very basis of the Québec anti–federalist movement:\n\n“How did the Québec independence movement which flourished before René Lévesque, end–up in its present state of decline? Ever since 1968, René Lévesque has told his followers in the Québec independence movement that he will not fight for Québec’s independence. Then why did they so loyally support him? … By using the Parti Québécois to climb the rungs of the social ladder in order to dominate Québec, has not this class of newcomers (nouvelle classe de parvenus) instead replaced the goal of Québec independence with the aim of their own self–aggrandizement?”¹⁵\n\nBut the “airy fairy” ideology of Trudeauism, and the abstractions of souveraineté, indépendance and séparatisme, are not the ghostly emanations of some netherworld, but are themselves inscribed within the political and economic arena of the world historical struggle between superior and inferior ruling classes in the rise and fall of the Québécocracy, as the backwards cartels, outdated monopolies and corrupt trusts of the White Gold ruling class:\n\n“Desmarais purchased 2.8 million shares, about 2.1 million class A common shares and 700,000 second preferred shares. He said he bought all the Power shares held by the Caisse de Depot du Quebec, amounting to 2,001,300 common shares and 333,000 preferred, with the rest coming from Peter Nesbitt Thomson, deputy chairman of Power and ‘other persons associated with him.’ The shares were bought by an unspecified private holding company belonging to Desmarais.”¹⁶\n\n“At the time, the government of René Lévesque held large economic summits in order to integrate the big players of the Québec economy: The first of these massive summits was held at the Richelieu Manor, at the Malbaie, in the Charlevoix region of Québec, from the 24th until the 27th of May 1977, and gathered around the same table such high–flyers as Louis Laberge, Paul Desmarais, Yvon Charbonneau and Brian Mulroney, to name but a few.”¹⁷\n\n“During my time there at the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, (CDPQ), we became very big players in the economy of Québec, resultant from the many $millions in contributions from Québéckers. That is when I perceived that political influence, especially after 1978, played an increasingly important role at the Caisse (Québec Pension Plan): Our investments were then very much determined by political considerations … The Caisse secretly followed in the footsteps of Paul Desmarais, and we utterly failed the Québec taxpayers. Sadly enough, the losers are not these wealthy investors, but rather Québéckers themselves are impoverished.”¹⁸\n\nWe have unmasked in the above paragraphs (which undoubtedly causes some confusion and stupefaction in the minds of those whose intellects were abused over the years by the delusions of Trudeauism), the satanism of the Québécocracy, the mortal corruption at the very basis of its 1968 seizure of power in Ottawa, and the diabolism of its political and economic domination:\n\n“As the commission investigated the labour situation in the construction trades, the web of corruption it unravelled extended beyond inter–union rivalry, beyond the labour movement, even beyond the construction industry, and led into the offices of provincial Liberal cabinet ministers. Through months of public hearings in late 1974 and early 1975 and the testimony of almost three hundred witnesses, a spectacular story of violence, intimidation, loan–sharking, government corruption, payoffs by companies to avoid strikes, and almost every form of criminal activity emerged … the commission stopped just short of calling Premier Bourassa himself.”¹⁹\n\n“Dodgy business is only the most recent in a long line of made–in–Québec corruption that has affected the province’s political culture at every level … The province’s dubious history stretches further back to the 1970s, and to the widespread corruption in the construction industry as Québec rushed through one mega project after another … As politicians and experts from every facet of the political spectrum told Maclean’s, the history of corruption is sufficiently long and deep in Québec that it has bred a culture of mistrust of the political class. It raises an uncomfortable question: Why is it that politics in Canada’s bête noire province seem perpetually rife with scandal?”²⁰\n\n“Everything in Québec is so corrupt … we all know that everyone is controlled by the Power Corporation, from Jean Chrétien to Pierre–Marc Johnson, they all work for the Power Corporation … Québéckers are so corrupt that we are even worse than the Americans, but America does not control Québec: The Power Corporation rules over Québec.”²¹\n\n“The faith of Québéckers in their public institutions is deeply convulsed … Corruption destroys the very foundations of our democracy … What is at stake here is the very idea of the evolution of the rational conception of right in Canada.”²²\n\nWe shall repeat our words from the beginning: For the past half–century, Canada and the Canadian people have turned a blind–eye to the mortal corruption of the Québec régime in Ottawa and Empire of Paul Desmarais: Their eyes were blinded by “Canadian culture,” namely propaganda from the backwards cartels, outdated monopolies and corrupt trusts of the Québécocracy, otherwise known as the media empire of Paul Desmarais, — and protected (protectionnisme) in Ottawa as a central cogwheel of the White Gold (Hydro–Québec) ruling class:\n\nYves Michaud (1968): “If this problem is not corrected by a very serious inquiry on the part of elected officials, in accordance with the laws of our National Assembly, the Desmarais oligarchy will threaten the power of our Parliament: Does the dangerous nature of this situation require even further proof? Will not this oligarchy eventually usurp the sovereign will of our representatives, and even our Prime Minister? … At this very moment, the Gelco–Trans–Canada Group (controlled by Paul Desmarais) is seeking to further acquire Le Soleil Newspaper, the readership of which is more than 175,000 people, as well as the daily newspaper Le Droit in Ottawa, which has a readership of some 45,000 people.”²³\n\n“[Paul Desmarais] had gained control of four of Québec’s eight French–language daily newspapers (La Presse, La Tribune of Sherbrooke, Le Nouvelliste of Trois–Rivieres and La Voix de l’Est of Granby), seventeen weeklies (including the three largest weeklies in the Montréal area), and ten radio and television stations (including Montréal’s CKAC, the largest French–language radio station in Canada). These acquisitions raised the specter of a virtual information monopoly.”²⁴\n\n“Through Gesca Ltée, Desmarais controls several daily newspapers, including La Presse, Montréal’s prestigious broadsheet, and Québec City’s Le Soleil … Power Corporation, through its Square Victoria Communications Group subsidiary, and together with the corporate parent companies of the Toronto Star and Globe and Mail newspapers owns The Canadian Press.”²⁵\n\n“It has taken some 30 years, but in November 2000 the Desmarais family finally gained control of the newspapers Le Soleil and Le Droit, along with Le Quotidien of Chicoutimi: The Desmarais family controls 70% of the written press in Québec … Canadians are outraged to learn that 66% of all their daily newspapers were owned by media conglomerates in 1970 and that this number had increased to 88% in 1995, and then increased to 95 % in 1999. In Québec, all of our daily newspapers, except Le Devoir, are owned by media conglomerates: One conglomerate alone owns 70% of all our daily newspapers.”²⁶\n\nIndeed, from April 1962 until August 1966, very important years in the rise of Pierre Elliott Trudeau and the Québécocracy, the magazine Cité Libre was regularly published by Pierre Desmarais Inc., of Montréal.\n\nThe argument is sometimes made by followers of the Québécocracy, that so long as they themselves are greatly enriched, they can tolerate the corrupt politicians and corruption. But these flabby minds do not draw the rational distinction between corruption on the one hand and decadence (mortal corruption) on the other. The Québécocracy was therefore greatly enriched while the modern political and economic foundations of finance, commerce and industry were swept–away. But the Québécocracy has sought to erect backwards cartels, outdated monopolies and corrupt trusts as replacements, and thereby impede the rise of rational political and economic order. This situation has prevailed in the regions of Canada, and many Canadians are thereby impoverished. Canada, like Mexico, is in the grasp of a criminal ruling class, but the eyes of Canadians during the Québec régime in Ottawa and Empire of Paul Desmarais 1968–2006, were blinded by “Canadian culture.” America and the American people have suffered over the years from the irrationalism of the Canadian and Mexican ruling classes. This almighty Global civilization, and its beautiful American idealists, upholders of freedom and humanity in the 20th century at great cost, have been stabbed in the back by their own neighbours, the effete and degenerate ruling classes of European modernity in the New World. The Québécocracy and the narco–élites are an abomination: Let them rot on the dunghill of history. The spiritual power of universal history is moving against the destroyers of America and the American people, the last wreckers of rational political and economic order in the world, and is neutralizing them one by one: Their extinction is the supremacy of Americanism in the 21st century.\n\nQuébécocrats are therefore francophone and anglophone Canadians who have succumbed to the morbid spell of Cité Libre and other such scatology as La Presse, The Canadian Press and so forth, namely Canadian culture. The political and economic abstractions of the Québécocracy, based upon the phantasm of French Canada, was very useful in making Pierre Beaudoin, Paul Desmarais and Lino Saputo into very rich men, indeed, not to mention the families of Trudeau, Mulroney, Chrétien, Martin, and many others. But today, thanks to their delusions of the French Fact in North America (souveraineté, indépendance and séparatisme), some four million Canadians in Québec live in poverty, while some two million of them barely manage to survive:\n\n“According to information from the Québec Government, 6.47 million taxpayers, otherwise 36%, earned less than $20,000 in 2013 while 14% earned between $20,000 and $29,999 … in the same year, 50% of the taxpayers in Québec earned less than $30,000 while 73% earned less than $50,000.”²⁷\n\nIn Québec little more than 4 million Canadians actually pay any income tax, and therefore mutatis mutandis the same holds good at the federal level: Since little more than 4 million Canadians in Québec actually pay any income tax to the Government of Québec, a fortiori, little more than 4 million Canadians in Québec actually pay any federal income tax to Ottawa. In other words, nearly half the population of Québec is so poor that some 4 million Canadians in Québec pay no federal income tax:\n\n“The number of taxpayers who have declared their fiscal situation is nearly 6.5 million Québéckers. Attention: Of these ‘taxpayers,’ only 4.1 million are actually taxable. Many declare their fiscal situation but pay no tax … little more than 4 million Québéckers actually pay tax in Québec, about half of the population.”²⁸\n\nThis profound financial, commercial and industrial retardation is the result of the political and economic irrationalism of the Québec Régime in Ottawa and Empire of Paul Desmarais: The main culprits of this mortal corruption (la décadence) are the backwards cartels, outdated monopolies and corrupt trusts of Paul Desmarais, Laurent Beaudoin, Lino Saputo and Paul Martin Junior, as well as many other Québec Régimers: “[We] secretly followed in the footsteps of Paul Desmarais, and we utterly failed the Québec taxpayers. Sadly enough, the losers are not the wealthy investors, but rather Québéckers themselves are impoverished.”\n\nThe actions of Pierre Trudeau and René Lévesque (his erstwhile companion at Cité Libre), whether in Ottawa or Québec, always aimed at uplifting themselves and the Québécocracy, as the dominant ruling class in Canada, and as the replacements of the old British imperialist élites: This at least is the verdict of the rational conception of Canada in 20th century universal history, as the spiritual evolution from the lowest to the very highest form of freedom in the world, as the supremacy of Global civilization and American Liberty. Therefore, as a result of these power struggles, the very notion of Canada (and Canadian history) during the past half century has been profoundly perverted and debased as regionalism, in the creation of ideological constructions to seduce the Canadian electorate, based upon the Machiavellism of the Québécocracy. The Québécocracy requires the assistance of anglophone Canadians in order to implement its political and economic domination of Canada, especially the Anglos in South Central Ontario, the Maritimes, and the West. Today, the old British imperialistic conception of Canada is undone, but its modern–day ideological replacement by the Québec régime in Ottawa, is financially, commercially and industrially powerless in the political and economic arena of world history, — out of step with our times. The Québécocracy is therefore out of step with the reorganization of the American world.\n\nThe arena of the ideological constructions of this modern conception of Canada, is the propaganda of Trudeauism, which is based upon “biographies” of Pierre Trudeau (published by companies that get especially cheap rates on paper and newsprint granted by the Québécocracy’s rape of Crown Lands):\n\n“Trudeau the chameleon, many people believe, will always be an enigma. Indeed, journalists, biographers, and many Canadians, have been and continue to be intrigued and puzzled by Trudeau. A witty comment about him conjures up the peculiar state of confusion writers find themselves in when they set out to describe him: ‘Someone is going to say one day, ‘Will the real Mr. Trudeau please stand up,’ and about fifty–eight people will rise.’”²⁹\n\nWe must beware of sophistical Trudeau philology in the elucidation of the rational conception of Canada in the world of today: Sophistical Trudeau philology is often used in order to “prove” the existence of the nationalist–federalist shift in the rise of Pierre Trudeau and the Québécocracy, namely to “imply” that the White Gold (Hydro–Québec) ruling class is the upholder of rational political and economic order in Canada, — the “implication” (suggestion) that the Québécocracy is a Canadocentric polity:\n\n“[Trudeau] provided Canada with a charter defending the inalienable rights of the person … [Trudeau] adopted positions at odds with those he had championed … when and how did he make this 180–degree turn? … this son of Québec became the father of Canada … Unlike many Cité Libre collaborators, including Gérard Pelletier, Trudeau never shared Emmanuel Mounier’s sympathy with the French Communist Party.”³⁰\n\nAccording to Max and Monique Nemni, Pierre Trudeau never shared Emmanuel Mounier’s sympathy with the French Communist Party, unlike many Cité Libre collaborators, including Gérard Pelletier: Where is the precise philological difference drawn between Pierre Trudeau and the collaborators of Cité Libre in their book, Trudeau Transformed (2011)? Max and Monique Nemni do not draw an exact philological distinction between the writings of Pierre Trudeau published in Cité Libre which bear his name, and those writings which do not, namely, collective pieces published by the editorial team, upon which he collaborated, and other unsigned articles which as a member of the board, he chose and approved. Pierre Trudeau and the editorial team of Cité Libre, of which he was a founding member, certainly shared Emmanuel Mounier’s sympathy with the modern European irrationalism at the very foundation of the French Communist Party:\n\n“Emmanuel Mounier is dead. Even two months after his death, the time is not yet ripe for us to gauge the scope of the great loss which results from his demise. The most distracted of our readers can discover in each page of Cité Libre, not only the influence exercised upon each of us by the magazine Esprit, but also our very own determined effort to emulate its special objectivity, — which we want to elaborate even more profoundly: We have directly inherited this agenda from Emmanuel Mounier. The backers of Cité Libre had decided, from the time of their very first meetings, to send the director of Esprit the very first copy of Cité Libre that rolled–off the printing press. It is sufficient to say that Cité Libre was born under the banner of Esprit, and is faithful to the very same values for which Emmanuel Mounier fought until his very last breath … Even after his death, the spirit of Emmanuel Mounier will henceforth fill all the pages of Cité Libre.”³¹\n\nPierre Trudeau’s “nationalist–federalist shift,” the ideological construction of Max and Monique Nemni, themselves longtime puppets of the Québécocracy, therefore evaporates in the light of exact philological determinations. Pierre Trudeau did not shift from anti–federalism to federalism, such that he moved away from Québécocentricism toward Canadocentricism: Trudeau’s activities on the national and federal scenes are rather the different spheres within which he applied his modern European political and economic irrationalism, in the destruction of the old British imperialistic élites, as the advancement of the Québécocracy, the backwards cartels, outdated monopolies and corrupt trusts of the White Gold ruling class, both provincially and federally.\n\nPierre Trudeau first directed his Québécocentricism against the British imperialistic ruling class in Québec (l’idéologie dominante), especially as personified by the government of Maurice Duplessis: Trudeau later directed his Québécocentricism, especially after the rise of the Gaullist (néo–nationaliste) Jean Lesage, against the British imperialistic ruling class in Ottawa, personified in his mind by the government of John Diefenbaker. Towards the Québec Liberal Party, Trudeau directed his Québécocentricism against its British imperialistic wing: Once inside the Liberal Party of Canada, Trudeau directed his Québécocentricism against its British imperialistic wing. Eventually, under the rising power of the Québécocracy, Walter Gordon and even Lester Pearson himself, as well as many other old timers (maudits anglais), were ultimately struck down or pushed aside.\n\nPierre Trudeau really started to direct his modern European irrationalism towards the federal scene after the deaths of Maurice Duplessis and Paul Sauvé, and during the decline of the Union nationale, under the hammer blows of Jean Lesage and Gaullism:\n\n“De Gaulle’s regime in France and Jean Lesage’s neo–nationalist government in Québec had a common desire to use the social revolution of their time to transform their societies … both were investing or planning — or hoping — to invest in regional development, new factories, electrical and nuclear power plants, airports and seaports, aircraft industries, railway and telephone systems, highways, mass housing projects … de Gaulle for his part saw collaboration as a means for promoting the power and influence of his country and expanding French civilization in the world … the ruling élites in France and Québec found it easy to collaborate in economic development because they were both prepared to act via powerful government leadership.”³²\n\nPierre Elliott Trudeau, the son of Québec, became the father of Canada? The White Gold (Hydro–Québec) ruling class is a Canadocentric polity? Nothing is further from the truth: The Québécocracy and its élites constitute a Québécocentric polity in Ottawa:\n\n“Now we know, after the last Budget Speech, this year (1968) Québec will get $362,740,000.00 in various federal equalization payments, compared to the $66 million in 1962. Québec has therefore won the taxation war in Ottawa.”³³\n\nWe must therefore abandon the abstract conception of Canada, the thoughts in the heads of some Canadians (hagiographers and sycophants) of what Canada can be, might be, could be, would be, should be and even ought to be. These phantasms of the feeding–trough are the tunes the puppets of the Québécocracy play to the captive minds of their mostly eastern audience:\n\n“Where will the new ideas in Québec come from? Will they come from our departments of political science? This is unlikely because our political scientists in Québec prefer to write rather than participate in politics, at least those whose brains have not been irreparably destroyed by the obscurantism of the hermeneutic, constructivist–relativist and paleo–Marxist philosophies.”³⁴\n\nWe will indeed avoid the obscurantism of the hermeneutic, constructivist–relativist and paleo–Marxist “philosophies.” Of course, we shall also avoid neo–Marxism like the plague, as well as the “philosophy” of Mario Bunge: His country was never raped by Uncle Sam and Yankee Imperialism, but rather wrecked by world communism and narco–terrorism. As lovers of truth and reality, instead we shall apply ourselves to the elucidation of that which constitutes the rational notion of Canada within the realm of exact historiography and world history: We shall not therefore restrict ourselves only to those writings in Cité Libre which alone bear the imprint of Pierre Trudeau’s name.\n\nThus, we shall apply ourselves to exact Trudeau philology with a vengeance: The writings of Pierre Trudeau in Cité Libre are categorized into three main groups: (1) Writings by Pierre Trudeau which bear the imprint of his name, (2) writings of the editorial team of Cité Libre of which Trudeau was a some–time member, and (3) writings of the editorial team from Cité Libre when Trudeau was not a member, but also during the period that he sat on the administrative board of the magazine.\n\nThis policy allows us to elucidate the rational conception of Canada, based in part upon the notion of the Québécocracy as an inferior ruling class: The Québécocracy is the dominant ruling class in Canada because its backwards cartels, outdated monopolies and corrupt trust are based upon impérialisme (souveraineté, indépendance, and séparatisme). The old British imperialistic conception of Canada was burst asunder by the contradictions of the modern world, in its opposite, in the impérialisme of the French Revolution. Pierre Trudeau was a nationalist and a federalist because he was an impérialiste of the Québécocracy: Séparatisme is for the lowest classes; indépendance is for the middle classes; and souveraineté is for the upper classes, — at least for the most part under the Québec régime in Ottawa and Empire of Paul Desmarais, 1968–2006. Souveraineté, indépendance and séparatisme, whether in Québec or Ottawa, as anti–federalism or federalism, therefore always means the political and economic domination of Canada by the Québécocracy, the White Gold (Hydro–Québec) ruling class.\n\nThe old British imperialistic conception of Canada was burst asunder by the contradictions of the modern world, in its opposite, as the impérialisme of the French Revolution, in the clash between subjective and objective freedom: Beyond the British empire in world history, we find no rising modern civilization, including that of the French empire. The adversaries of the United States of America and “Yankee Imperialism,” have only phantasms behind their outdated policies, out of step with the world–march of history ever since the collapse of Soviet communism: The “serious” critics of Washington on the world stage are not really the enemies of “Yankee Imperialism,” but the adversaries of some administration in the White House, whether republican or democrat, and therefore they are not really destroyers of Americanism, but adversaries of some American political and economic policy. The old British imperialistic conception of Canada was burst asunder by the contradictions of the modern world, in the impérialisme of the French Revolution, its opposite, precisely because the clash between monarchism and republicanism, in every corner of the earth, overcomes European modernity in the rise of Western civilization, as Global rational political and economic order, — the notion of universal freedom as the supremacy of American Liberty.\n\nThe struggle between republicanism and monarchism in the genuine Hegelian dialectic of finitude, as the modern political and economic form of the struggle between superior and inferior ruling classes, is inscribed within the spiritual evolution of world history as the collapse of European modernity and rise of Global civilization. What is the meaning of this doctrine in the school of American Idealism? For the germs of this conception, we need only refer to the last part of Hegel’s Rechtsphilosophie:\n\n“It is as particular entities that states enter into relations with one another. Hence their relations are on the largest scale a maelstrom of external contingency and the inner particularity of passions, private interests and selfish ends, abilities and virtues, vices, force, and wrong. All these whirl together, and in their vortex the ethical whole itself, the autonomy of the state, is exposed to contingency. The principles of the national minds are wholly restricted on account of their particularity, for it is in this particularity that, as existent individuals, they have their objective actuality and their self–consciousness. Their deeds and destinies in their reciprocal relations to one another are the dialectic of the finitude of these minds [die erscheinende Dialektik der Endlichkeit], and out of it arises the universal mind, the mind of the world, free from all restriction, producing itself as that which exercises its right — and its right is the highest right of all — over these finite minds in the ‘history of the world which is the world’s court of judgement.’”³⁵\n\nThe result is therefore always the same, whether as a Québec nationalist (anti–federalist) or federalist: The Québécocracy dominates all other Canadian ruling classes in the name of Québec impérialisme, as autocracy founded upon popular consent, which is the bastion of the (outdated) Napoléonic and French Revolutionary conception of right in Canada and the political and economic arena of 20th century world history:\n\n“[ii] What is in issue now is not the minor matter of the state’s form; what is in issue is the nature of the state itself. We cannot, as I conceive, understand the profundity of the debate unless we realize that it is a crisis which involves the ultimate substance of society’s constitution … [iii] The fundamental issue, at least, is straightforward; what is challenged is the liberal [Industrial revolutionary] theory of the state … [The state] is, in fact, the supreme coercive power in any given political society; but it is, in fact, used to protect and promote in that society the interest of those who own its instruments of production. The state expresses a will to maintain a given system of class–relations. It does so through the use of its supreme coercive power to that end. In the last analysis, this power consists of the defense forces of the state. These are used, in ultimate challenge, to impose the will of the owners of the instruments of production upon those excluded from such ownership … [iv] There may be more or less of coercion at any given moment, according as the economic situation of society enables more or less concessions of material well–being to be made to those excluded from the privileges of ownership … [v] in such a society the coercive power of the state is used to promote differences in relation to the satisfaction of demand which may be (and in fact often are) unjust. Only the capture of the state, followed by the re–definition of its legal postulates, could remedy this condition. This, as I understand it, is the challenge issued to the classic theories of the state in recent years. In its general outline, it was first formulated by Marx and Engels, and it received its classic re–statement by Lenin in his State and Revolution. I am not aware of any adequate answer to it from opponents of the challenge … Those who defend the classic theories of the state must be able to show not that an ideal state which exists only in their own construction, but the actual states, England, France, the United States of America, that we know, are inherently capable, granted the class–relations they maintain, of fulfilling demand on the largest possible scale, and that, therefore, they have a moral claim to the allegiance of their members on this ground … [vi] we are in a psychological condition comparable, as I have said … to the epoch of the French Revolution, when men seek to reconstitute the foundations of society. This they are now, as then, unable to do unless they redefine its class–relations. They cannot re–define them without possession of the state–power since it is in the use of its coercive authority that the means of re–definition are to be found.”³⁶\n\nOnly the capture of the state, followed by the re–definition of its legal postulates, could remedy “unjust” conditions by fulfilling demand on the largest possible scale:\n\nLenin: “The state is the supreme coercive power in any given political order, which is used, in fact, to promote and protect in that order, the interests of those who own its instruments of production … the state is the product and the manifestation of the irreconcilability of class antagonisms … the state arises when, where, and to the extent that the class antagonisms cannot be objectively reconciled … and, conversely, the existence of the state proves that the class antagonisms are irreconcilable … according to Marx, the state is an organ of class domination, an organ of oppression of one class by another; its aim is the creation of ‘order’ which legalizes and perpetuates this oppression by moderating the collisions between the classes.”³⁷\n\nOnly the capture of the state, followed by the re–definition of its legal postulates, could remedy “unjust” conditions by fulfilling demand on the largest possible scale? How, pray tell, is this accomplished? The methodology of this “capture of the state,” and the re–definition of its legal postulates, is based upon the Kantio–Hegelian sophistry of Karl Marx:\n\n“My dialectic … is not only different from Hegel’s, but its direct opposite. To Hegel, the life process of the human brain is the demiurgos of the real world, and the real world is only the external, phenomenal form of ‘the Idea.’ With me, on the contrary, the ideal is nothing else than the material world reflected by the human mind, [5] and translated into forms of thought … In its mystified form, [the Hegelian] dialectic became the fashion in Germany, because it seemed to transfigure and to glorify the existing state of things. In its rational form it [the Hegelian Dialectic] is a scandal and an abomination to bourgeoisdom and its doctrinaire professors because it [the rational Hegelian Dialectic] includes in its comprehension and affirmative recognition of the existing state of things, at the same time also, the recognition of the negation of that state, of its inevitable breaking up; because it [the rational Hegelian Dialectic] regards every historically–developed social form as in fluid movement, and therefore takes into account its transient nature not less than its momentary existence; because it [the rational Hegelian Dialectic] lets nothing impose upon it, and is in its essence critical and revolutionary.”³⁸\n\nModern freedom, as the Kantio–Hegelian dialectic of 19th and 20th century European political and economic irrationalism, is therefore the ideological fountainhead of the Québécocracy:\n\n“Dialectics of Action (la dialectique de l’action) drive us toward the imperialistic concentration of our powers upon a single objective: Democracy … I believe that statism (dirigisme) is necessary in order to maximize our Liberty (la liberté).”³⁹\n\nIn other words, Kantio–Hegelianism, rechristened by Pierre Trudeau as the Dialectics of Action (la dialectique de l’action), as found in the pseudo–Hegelianism and anti–Hegelianism of Charles Margrave Taylor’s impure Hegelianism, is the backbone of the Trudeauist ideology, especially as outlined in Hegel (1975), Hegel and Modern Society, (1979) and “Hegel and the Philosophy of Action” (1983).⁴⁰ This is the secret of the rational conception of Canada and Trudeau philology. The implementation of Trudeauist democracy or “elected dictatorship” (Peter C. Newman), as the “la dialectique de l’action” of the Québec régime, is named “dirigisme” by Pierre Trudeau, but really results in little more than the outdated Napoléonic and French Revolutionary conception of right (la liberté), especially familiar to francophone Europeans as the rationale behind Bonapartism: Autocracy founded upon popular consent (H.A.L. Fisher).\n\nPierre Trudeau maintains that the Dialectics of Action compel democrats like himself toward the imperialistic concentration of power upon democracy: “La dialectique de l’action nous impose impérieusement de concentrer nos effectifs sur … la démocratie.” For Trudeau, the imperialistic concentration of power upon democracy necessarily results in statism (dirigisme), because only modern European political and economic irrationalism maximises Liberty: “Je crois à la nécessité d’un dirigisme pour maximiser la liberté.” Lenin, Stalin, Hitler and Mao also used the power of the people in the name of statism and imperialism: The same modern unreason that brought Europe to its knees in the 20th century, is served up on a new platter by the charlatanism of Pierre Trudeau, as the Machiavellism of the Québec régime.\n\nBut the New World is not old Europe, as is evidenced in the White House, Washington and Wall Street …\n\nToday, the profound disillusionment in Queen’s Park merely signifies that the last remnants of the “soixante–huitard” ruling classes are being swept into the dustbin of history, victims of broken promises and shattered dreams: Their funeral pyres signalize the new ground of the highest conception of Canada and its place in the world of today. As the world historical groundwork of the last remnants of modern European political and economic degeneration in Canada is swept upon the dunghill of the earth, there arises a vast new spiritual conception of humanity as Western civilization and the supremacy of American Liberty in the world. From out of the world historical ashes of the Québécocracy, in the collapse of European modernity and rise of Globalism, comes the Canadosphere, as the political and economic realm of American finance, commerce and industry in Canada, — the Canadocentric Polity: The Québécocracy is undone in the rational conception of Canada as the supremacy of American Liberty in the world. The political and economic rationality of the American world bursts asunder the bonds of our modern unreason: The criminal ruling classes are undone in the rise of Americanism …\n\nThe Québécocracy is therefore the political and economic avatar of modern European raison d’état in Canada: This much at least is evidenced from the rational philological elucidation of the ideology of Pierre Trudeau and Cité Libre, in the rise and fall of the Québec régime in Ottawa and Empire of Paul Desmarais as the hegemony of the White Gold (Hydro–Québec) ruling class in Ottawa …\n\nThe 21st century is uplifting Canada and the Canadian people, especially on the West Coast — but not under the political and economic irrationalism of the Québécocracy — rather in the supremacy of American finance, commerce and industry in the world. The rise of the American world and Global civilization constitutes the political and economic liberation of Canada and the Canadian people from the mortal corruption of the Québécocracy, — the White Gold (Hydro–Québec) ruling class.\n\nOf what use is the rational conception of Canada in the world of today? The American Idealistic conception of rational political and economic order, the bastion of Americanism, is really a very useful conception for all Canadians who greatly desire financial, commercial and industrial success, based upon the solid foundations of exact historiography and world history.\n\nWhen applied to the realm of politics and economics, in the struggle between superior and inferior ruling classes, the rational conception of Canada therefore leads to happiness, prosperity and longevity: Make Canada Great!\n\nCHAPTER 3: BRIAN MULRONEY VERSUS AMERICAN PROTECTIONISM\n\nExploitons à fond la Confédération … the confederation pact must not be allowed to continue on its present path, else it will be in danger of compromising its existence. Jean Lesage, 1962\n\nNow we know, after the last Budget Speech, this year Québec will get $362,740,000.00 in various federal equalization payments, compared to the $66 million in 1962. Québec has therefore won the taxation war in Ottawa.\n\nRobert Bourassa, 1968¹\n\nBrian Mulroney was recently decorated with the highest award of France, namely, the Grande–Croix de la légion d’honneur, established by Napoléon Bonaparte in 1802.² Why did Mulroney, a former Canadian Prime Minister, receive this great award? Mulroney was rewarded for his “distinguished services to the Government of France.”³ What distinguished services did Brian Mulroney perform for the French Republic? Mulroney was rewarded for his “dedicated advancement of the relations between France and Canada, and for the aggrandizement of the international Francophonie.”⁴ Brian Mulroney advanced the Napoléonic and French revolutionary conception of right in Canada under the Québec Régime in Ottawa and Empire of Paul Desmarais, the political and economic arm of the Québec Inc:\n\n“Mulroney is the first Conservative leader since Confederation who has any real ties to French–speaking Canada … Mulroney has been immersed in a distinct political culture that is alien to most English Canadians.”⁵\n\nWhat do we have in mind? We must return to Québec City and the Law School of the Université de Laval, in the heyday of radicalism and revolutionism of the 1960’s.\n\n“There was an explosion of conferences and symposiums, and the most spectacular of these was the 1961 Congress on Canadian Affairs at Laval University. Brian Mulroney and his Conservative friends — Meighen, White, Cogger and Bazin — were the driving force behind the symposium.”⁶\n\nWhat is the significance of this event? “The English–speaking delegates of the conference were suddenly deeply immersed in the culture of intellectual revolutionism that presently disturbs French Canada.”⁷\n\nThe intellectual upheavals of the 1960’s in Québec, and Brian Mulroney’s education at Laval, are the early “driving force” behind his French chauvinism and later Québéckocentricism:\n\n“In 1962, while Mulroney was a student there, the replacement of Guy Hudon as dean of law by Yves Pratte (later president of Air Canada and a Supreme Court justice) heralded an expansion of the new curriculum and a new openness to the forces of change that were penetrating the campus … the new directions in Québec society that accompanied the change of governments in 1960 were felt with particular force in the areas of federal–provincial relations and, more generally, in the relationship between French and English Canada … [Jean Lesage was] eager to involve the provincial government in new fields of endeavour, and adopted a newly aggressive posture towards Ottawa.”⁸\n\nThe impression of the intellectual revolutionism of the new curriculum, “un dialogue franc et ouvert,”⁹ profoundly affected the English–speaking participants of the famous Laval Congress on Canadian Affairs:\n\n“The effect was amazing. To an English Canadian sitting in the crowded audience, the emotional response that he [Marcel Chaput] evoked was almost a tangible thing, a physical thing. Somehow he expressed the deep and abiding sense of insult — the word is not too strong — that his young listeners felt about the French Canadian minority position in a largely Anglo–Saxon country.”¹⁰\n\nBrian Mulroney: “I was chairman of a panel discussion that made national headlines. On the panel was Marcel Chaput, the Québec civil servant who worked for the Ministry of National Defense and [who] made no attempt to hide his separatist leanings.”¹¹ From out of this ferment of 1960’s intellectual revolutionism and the new curriculum at the Université de Laval in Québec City, arise the ringleaders of Joe Clark’s defeat. From out of the “new openness to the forces of change,” and the “new directions in Québec society,” from the “newly aggressive posture towards Ottawa,” arise the ringleaders of the Québéckification of English Canadian conservatism:\n\n“The 1961 Laval Congress on Canadian Affairs was the event that drew Brian Mulroney, Michael Meighen, Peter White, Jean Bazin and Michel Cogger together. The team that was to capture the leadership of the federal Progressive Conservative party in 1983 was in place.”¹²\n\nIn Mason Wade’s words, the graduates of the Université de Laval were, “the true makers of the ‘Quiet Revolution.’”¹³ The Quiet Revolution is the work of the Québec Régime in Ottawa and Empire of Paul Desmarais, the political and economic arm of the Québec Inc: “We Québéckers have lived through the Quiet Revolution and the Empire of Paul Desmarais, which is our Quiet Dispossession.”¹⁴ Alas, Canadians have lived through the Quiet Revolution and the Empire of Paul Desmarais, which is our Quiet Dispossession!\n\nThis same Brian Mulroney, who was very early influenced by French Chauvinism during the 1960’s upheaval of intellectual revolutionism and the new curriculum at the most French chauvinistic university in Canada, the great defender of republican France and her political and economic traditions resultant from Napoléon Bonaparte and the French revolution, has a new lesson for Canada and the Canadian people:\n\n“Brian Mulroney is warning Canada must not ignore the trade danger of American protectionism. ‘Americans are frustrated by the slow recovery of their economy … Open trade agreements have become an easy whipping boy.’”¹⁵\n\nBrian Mulroney’s message to Donald Trump on NAFTA during the U.S. election campaign is very clear: “You’re cutting off your nose to spite your face.”¹⁶ Mulroney, in the national media, during the U.S. Presidential Elections (undoubtedly at the behest of Québec Régimers like Lawrence Martin, himself goaded onward by the toadies of Caroline Mulroney), predicts the defeat of Donald Trump: “I don’t think something like that [American protectionism], that negative, carries you to the White House.”¹⁷ According to Brian Mulroney, Donald Trump will lose the White House because his anti–NAFTA electoral position is out–of–touch with the American electorate. Brian Mulroney is therefore the political and economic adversary of Americanism in the world of today.\n\nWhat is the trade danger of so–called American protectionism in the world of today? American protectionism, so–called by the mortal enemies of Americanism, is the political and economic advancement in world history far beyond the backwards cartels, outdated monopolies and corrupt trusts of the inferi"
