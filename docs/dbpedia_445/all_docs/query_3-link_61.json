        "text": "None of the people he invited to review his writings appeared to have alerted law enforcement, and the massacre played out much as Mr. Gendron envisioned.\n\nA compendium of his posts from Discord circulated online over the weekend, and details of those records were publicized on Monday. But it was not previously known that other users had joined the Discord chat room, known as a server, 30 minutes before he carried out the attack.\n\nIn a statement, a spokeswoman for Discord expressed sympathy for the victims of the shooting and said that “hate has no place on Discord.”\n\n“What we know at this time is that a private, invite-only server was created by the suspect to serve as a personal diary chat log,” the statement said. “Approximately 30 minutes prior to the attack, however, a small group of people were invited to and joined the server. Before that, our records indicate no other people saw the diary chat log in this private server.”\n\nMr. Gendron appeared to be working to build an audience in the moments before the shooting by passing his Discord link around on web forums where like-minded users gathered. At one point, he appeared to be planning to stream the May 14 attack — for which he has been charged with the murder of 10 people — directly to his chat room. It is unclear whether he did so.\n\nIn the opening pages of the compendium he posted online, Mr. Gendron was clear about his goal: He wished to radicalize others, and called on followers to join him in mounting similar attacks.\n\nThe Discord chat logs complement a nearly 200 page racist screed that Mr. Gendron released before the attack. That widely shared document was clearly meant for an audience less versed in the slang and references that he had picked up on 4chan, Reddit and other websites on which he spent time. In Discord, Mr. Gendron revealed far more personal details, often emphasizing his thoughts with racist and antisemitic memes and occasionally expressing self-doubt and the wish to commit suicide.\n\nBut it is also clear that Mr. Gendron was fully aware that the logs he uploaded would be pored over by law enforcement and others.\n\nA person who actively encouraged an act of mass shooting could potentially be criminally liable, though the bar for any charges would be high, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation.\n\nThroughout the compendium, Mr. Gendron frequently references working on the Discord transcript, suggesting that the process of posting it online was not as simple as merely downloading it to a server, then uploading it to web forums.\n\nIn March, the month during which he had originally planned to carry out the attack, he mentioned configuring the settings on Discord to ensure that others could look at one channel without changing anything.\n\nIn another channel — the general chat — he said that other users could type, send images and post emoji reactions, while being unable to delete each others’ posts. And on a third channel, he planned to embed the livestream of himself carrying out the shooting, using the application Twitch.\n\nIn early April, he noted that he had to fix rules in Discord, to avoid others being able to delete anything therein.\n\nDiscord began life as the chatting feature of a little known video game. The game’s creator, Jason Citron, abruptly pivoted in 2015, abandoning the game and focusing entirely on chat software. In recent years, the platform exploded in popularity with a mostly younger user base.\n\nLike many social media platforms, Discord has struggled to balance privacy and free speech ideals with combatting hate speech and content moderation. Discord has said it takes “immediate action” when it encounters violations like underage users or inappropriate content, responding to reports from users and moderators and using “advanced tooling, machine learning, specialized Safety teams tackling specific abuse situations, and insight from experts outside the company.”\n\nIn the report, posted on the company’s website, Discord said it disabled 2,182 servers and 25,170 individual accounts for violent extremism in the second half of 2021.\n\nJohn Herrman , Kellen Browning and Jesse McKinley contributed reporting.\n\nThe data documented a drastic shift in consumer demand among gun owners that has had profound commercial, cultural and political implications: Starting in 2009, Glock-type semiautomatic handguns, purchased for personal protection, began to outsell rifles, which have been typically used in hunting.\n\nEmbedded in the 306-page document was another statistic that law enforcement officials find especially troubling. The police recovered 19,344 privately manufactured firearms, untraceable homemade weapons known as “ghost guns,” in 2021, a tenfold increase since 2016. Law enforcement officials say that has contributed to the surge in gun-related killings, especially in California, where ghost guns make up as many as half of weapons recovered at crime scenes.\n\nThe numbers released Tuesday revealed an industry on the rise, with annual domestic gun production increasing from 3.9 million in 2000 to 11.3 million in 2020. A relatively small percentage of guns produced domestically are exported overseas, so those numbers are an accurate reflection of gun-buying habits, according to A.T.F. officials.\n\nCurrently, there are around 400 million guns in the United States, according to a 2018 survey conducted by the nonpartisan Small Arms Survey, which monitors gun ownership.\n\nThe statistics, culled by A.T.F.’s research division from industry, academic and government experts, offered few major surprises. Many of the broader contours and conclusions have been widely known through other sources or anecdotally for months, even years.\n\nBut the report’s release nonetheless represents a significant victory for advocates of gun control.\n\nWhile Democrats have failed at their larger agenda of limiting easy access to firearms, especially semiautomatic rifles, they are succeeding in gradually pulling back an informational blackout curtain that has obscured gun commerce data since George W. Bush’s administration.\n\nA year ago, President Biden ordered the A.T.F., an undersized agency with the oversized task of enforcing the nation’s gun laws and regulations, to collect and analyze 20 years of gun data after a series of mass shootings around the country.\n\nIn the introduction to the report, Gary M. Restaino, the bureau’s interim director, wrote that the purpose of releasing the data was to “prevent diversion of these firearms from the legal to the illegal market.”\n\nDuring a White House summit about reducing violence on Tuesday, the deputy attorney general, Lisa O. Monaco, underlined a similar point, saying, “We can only address the current rise in violence if we have the best available information and use the most effective tools and research to fuel our efforts.”\n\nHer remarks came on the same day that Mr. Biden traveled to Buffalo to visit the scene of the racially motivated shooting on Saturday.\n\nBefore boarding Air Force One, Mr. Biden told reporters that he would redouble his efforts “to convince Congress” to enact gun control measures, but conceded that it would be difficult without a major shift in sentiment from lawmakers.\n\nThe report, while eagerly anticipated, is considered less consequential than a coming analysis of weapons used to commit crimes — which will tap law enforcement, academic and public health sources — to offer an equally comprehensive picture of trafficking patterns.\n\n“It’s important to know what the scope and size of the overall market is, and the commerce report sheds light on that,” said Nick Suplina, senior vice president with Everytown for Gun Safety, the gun control group founded by the former New York mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.\n\n“But the next logical step is to get the data on crime gun recoveries, to get that information back in the public sphere, so we can find out how these guns are going from legal manufacturing to illegal use,” Mr. Suplina added.\n\nThat report is expected to highlight the role of illegal straw purchasers, legal buyers who sell weapons to people barred from purchasing handguns, and perhaps identify federally licensed dealers who are responsible for selling the greatest number of weapons later used in crimes.\n\nSome of that information has already made its way into the public domain.\n\nThis month, the gun control group Brady released an examination of Pennsylvania firearms tracing data revealing that six small retailers in south and northeast Philadelphia sold more than 11,000 weapons that were later recovered in criminal investigations or confiscated from owners who had obtained them illegally from 2014 to 2020.\n\nOver the past two years, gun thefts from cars and homes have surged in many major cities, fueling violent crime, according to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe gun industry has long resisted the disclosure of some firearms data collected by the A.T.F. A series of Republican-sponsored measures, pushed by the National Rifle Association, restricts officials at the bureau from releasing trace data and other information to the public.\n\nThe boom in gun production appears to have been partly driven by the expiration of the assault weapons ban in 2004.\n\nAfter the law was allowed to lapse, “manufacture of the types of semiautomatic rifles and pistols previously designated to be assault weapons steadily increased, particularly AR-type rifles and pistols, which are now commonly referred to as ‘modern sporting rifles’ and ‘modern sporting pistols,’” the report’s authors found.\n\nPayton Gendron, the suspect in the Buffalo attack, used a Bushmaster semiautomatic rifle, one of many AR-15 clones available for legal purchase in the country.\n\nTwo manufacturers are dominating the handgun market, the report said. Smith & Wesson accounted for 8.2 million guns produced from 2016 to 2020, 17 percent of the overall market, and Sturm, Ruger & Company was close behind, with nearly identical sales and production figures.\n\nThe data compiled by the A.T.F. covers a 20-year period, but the graphs included with the report show three periods of intense consumer volatility. One was in 2013, after the re-election of President Barack Obama and the mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., which prompted calls for increased gun regulations. The second was in 2016, during the presidential campaign.\n\nThe third unsettled period began in 2019 and extended through the 2020 election and pandemic.\n\nGun production increased across the board during that time. But demand for semiautomatic handguns rose at the fastest rate on record, with pistol production rocketing from around three million to 5.5 million annually, the report found.\n\nThe number of imported guns, of all types, has also been rising sharply, doubling from around two million per year a decade ago, to more than four million in 2020, a record.\n\nMany of those were first-time buyers who flooded A.T.F.’s switchboard and email servers for information about how to buy a gun legally, and which weapons were best for personal protection, one A.T.F. official said.\n\nAnd Mayor Brown, you’ve been — you’ve been wonderful. Thank you. And I know this is a lot of — when a vice-presidential or a presidential trip shows up, it’s — there’s all kinds of paraphernalia and people, and I know it’s not easy.\n\nI want to thank your law enforcement officers for not just what they did in this crisis, but for accommodating us, and all the elected officials and law enforcement officers, first responders, and faith leaders that are here today.\n\nJill and I have come to stand with you and, to the families, we’ve come to grieve with you. It’s not the same, but we know a little bit what it’s like to lose a piece of your soul, whether it was a son, a daughter, a husband, a wife, a mother, a father. The feeling of having that — as I said to some of you when we talked privately, you feel like there’s a black hole in your chest you’re being sucked into, and — and you’re suffocating unable — unable to breathe.\n\nThat’s what it felt like, at least to us, and I’m sure some version of that feels that way to you, the anger, the pain, the depth of the loss that’s so profound. You know, we know it’s hard to believe, and you’re probably not going to believe it, but I can tell you now from our personal experience and many others who we’ve met, the day is going to come it will come, when your loved one brings a smile as you remember him or her. As you remember her, it’s is going to bring a smile to your lip before it brings a tear to your eye. It takes a while for that to happen. It takes a while. It might take more than a season, but our prayer for you is that that time comes sooner or later. But I promise you, it will come.\n\nAs a nation, I say to the families, we remember them. We’ve been reading about them. We visited a memorial where it shows the love for them and you’ve all shown by the supermarket.\n\nCelestine Chaney, 65 years old, brain cancer survivor, churchgoer, bingo player, went to buy strawberries to make her favorite shortcake. A loving mother and grandmother.\n\nRoberta Drury, 32, beloved daughter and sister. Moved back home to help take care of her brother after his bone marrow transplant. She went to buy groceries for dinner. The center of attention who made everyone in the room laugh and smile when she walked in.\n\nAndre Mackneil, 53. Worked at a restaurant. Went to buy his 3-year-old son a birthday cake. His son is celebrating a birthday, asking, “Where is daddy?”\n\nKatherine Massey, 72, a writer and an advocate who dressed up in costumes at schools and cut the grass in the park and helped in local elections. The glue of the family and the community.\n\nMargus Morrison, 52, school bus aide. Went to buy snacks for weekly movie night with the family. Survived by his wife and three children and a stepdaughter. The center of their world.\n\nHeyward Patterson, 67, father, church deacon. Fed the homeless at the soup kitchen. Gave rides at a grocery store to neighbors who needed help. Putting food in the trunk of others when he took his final breath.\n\nAaron Salter, 55, retired Buffalo police officer for three decades. Three decades. Loved electric cars. Gave his life to save others on a Saturday afternoon, and had that man not been wearing that vest that he purchased — bulletproof vest — a lot of lives would have been saved. A beloved father and husband.\n\nGeraldine Talley, 62. Expert banker known for her warm, gentle personality. A friend to everybody. Devoted mother and grandmother.\n\nRuth Whitfield. Beloved wife, mother, grandmother, great-grandmother. Sang in the church choir. A caretaker of her husband, bringing him clean clothes, cutting his hair, holding his hand every day she visited him in the nursing home. Heart as big as her head.\n\nPearl Young, 77, grandmother, mother, missionary of god, public-school teacher, who also ran the local food panty. Loved singing, dancing and her family.\n\nAnd all three who were injured, Zaire Goodman, 20, shot in the neck but fighting through it; Jennifer Warrington, 50; Christopher Braden, 55, both treated with injuries on a long road to recovery.\n\nIndividual lives of love, service and community that speaks to the bigger story of who we are as Americans, a great nation because we’re a good people. Jill and I bring you this message from deep in our nation’s soul. In America, evil will not win. I promise you. Hate will not prevail and white supremacy will not have the last word.\n\nFor the evil did come to Buffalo, and it’s come to all too many places, manifest in gunmen who massacred innocent people in the name of hateful and perverse ideology rooted in fear and racism. It’s taken so much; 10 lives cut short in a grocery store, three other wounded — three — three other wounded by a hate-filled individual who had driven 200 miles from Binghamton, in that range, to carry out a murderous, racist rampage that he would livestream, livestream to the world.\n\nWhat happened here is simple and straightforward: terrorism. Terrorism. Domestic terrorism. Violence inflicted in the service of hate and the vicious thirst for power that defines one group of people being inherently inferior to any other group. A hate that, through the media and politics, the internet, has radicalized angry, alienated and lost individuals into falsely believing that they will be replaced. That’s the word. Replaced by the other. By people who don’t look like them.\n\nI and all of you reject the lie. I call on all Americans to reject the lie, and I condemn those who spread the lie for power, political gain and for profit.\n\nThat’s what it is. We’ve now seen too many times the deadly and destructive violence this ideology unleashes. We heard the chants — “you will not replace us” — in Charlottesville, Virginia. I wasn’t going to run, as the senator knows, again for president. When I saw those people coming out of the woods of the fields in Virginia, in Charlottesville, carrying torches, shouting, you will not replace us, accompanied by white supremacists and carrying Nazi banners, that’s when I said, “No, no.” And I, honest to God, those who know me — Chuck, you know, I wasn’t going to run for certain. But I was going to be darned if I was going to let —, Anyway. I’ll get going.\n\nLook, we’ve seen the mass shootings in Charleston, South Carolina; El Paso, Texas; in Pittsburgh. Last year in Atlanta. This weak in Dallas, Texas, and now in Buffalo. In Buffalo, New York.\n\nWhite supremacy is a poison. It’s a poison. It really is. Running through our body politic. And it’s been allowed to fester and grow right in front of our eyes. No more. I mean, no more. We need to say as clearly and forcefully as we can that the ideology of white supremacy has no place in America. None.\n\nLook, failure to saying, that is going to be complicity. Silence is complicity. It’s complicity. We cannot remain silent.\n\nOur nation’s strength has always come from the idea — it’s going to sound corny, but think about it — what’s the idea of our nation? That we’re all children of God. All children — life, liberty. Our universal goods, gifts of God. We didn’t get it from the government. We got it because we exist. We were called upon to defend them. The venom of the haters and their weapons of war, of violence in the words and deeds of the — that stalk our streets, our stores, our schools. This venom, this violence cannot be the story of our time. We cannot allow that to happen.\n\nLook, I’m not naïve. I know tragedy will come again. It cannot be forever overcome. It cannot be fully understood either. But there are certain things we can do. We can keep assault weapons off our streets. We’ve done it before. I did it when I passed the crime bill last time, and violence went down, shootings went down. We can’t prevent people from being radicalized to violence, but we can address the relentless exploitation of the internet to recruit and mobilize terrorism. We just need to have the courage to do that, to stand up.\n\nLook, the American experiment in democracy is in a danger like it hasn’t been in my lifetime. It’s in danger this hour. Hate and fear are being given too much oxygen by those who pretend to love America, but who don’t understand America. To confront the ideology of hate requires caring about all people. Not making distinctions. Reverend, the scripture, the — seeing that we’re all part of the divine.\n\nThat’s the America I know, that Jill knows. And most deserve the most — look, we are the most multiracial, most dynamic nation in the history of the world. Now is the time for the people of all races, from every background to speak up as a majority in America and reject white supremacy. These actions we’ve seen in these hate-filled attacks represent the views of a hate-filled minority.\n\nWe can’t allow them to distort America. The real America. We can’t allow them to destroy the soul of the nation.\n\nAs president of the United States, I travel the world all the time. And other nations ask me, heads of state in other countries ask me, what’s going on? What in God’s name happened on January 6th? What happened in Buffalo? They’ll ask.\n\nWe have to refuse to live in a country where Black people going about a weekly grocery shopping can be gunned down by weapons of war deployed in a racist cause.\n\nWe have to refuse to live in a country where fear and lies are packaged for power and for profit.\n\nWe must all enlist in this great cause of America.\n\nThis is work that requires all of us. Presidents, politicians, commentators, citizens. None of us can stay on the sidelines. We have to resolve that here in Buffalo, that from the tragedy, this tragedy, will come hope and light and life. It has to.\n\nAnd that on our watch, the sacred cause of America will never bow, never break, never bend. And the America we love, the one we love will endure. So to the families, from your pain, may we find purpose to live life worthy of the loved ones you lost.\n\nFrom a hymn based on the 91st Psalm that’s sung at my church, may he raise you up on eagle’s wings and bear you on the breath of dawn, make you to shine like the sun, and hold you in the palm of his hand.\n\nThat’s my wish for us. We can do this if we resolve to do it. If we take on the haters. And those who don’t even care, it’s just about profit and politics. May the soul of the fallen rest in peace and rise in glory. And may God guide the United States of America now and always.\n\nTo the families, as my grand pop used to say when I walked out of his home in Scranton, he’d say “Joey, spread the faith,” and my grandma would — no he would say “keep the faith,” and my grandma would say “no, Joey, spread the faith.” We’re thinking of you. Hold on to each other tightly. Stick together. You’ll get through this, and we’ll make Buffalo and the United States a better place to live than it is today.\n\nLater, in an address at Delavan-Grider Community Center on the city’s East Side, the president shared stories about the victims and called on the nation to reject racist ideologies.\n\nBut several residents of the area said they wanted to see more done to address longstanding issues in their area.\n\n“We want Biden to give the same support to Buffalo, to the East Side, that other communities get. That Ukraine gets,” said Jamarius Cooper, who has lived near the Masten Park neighborhood for more than a decade.\n\nTim Lewis, 55, who grew up on the East Side and traveled to the community center so his kids could see the area, said that he hoped the president’s stand against racism proved to be a long-term commitment.\n\nBut he was disappointed that officials did not greet residents outside after Mr. Biden finished his formal address.\n\n“The families are feeling the effects of this, of course,” he said. “But we are too. It’s kind of a slap in the face. He should’ve just come out here and spoke a few words to give us hope.”\n\nEarlier in the day, some residents struggled to catch glimpses of Mr. Biden as he approached the memorial, while others grew increasingly frustrated at the spectacle it had created.\n\nA crowd of about 150 residents had gathered in the area in the hour before the president’s arrival, standing in front of police barricades. One man standing on a nearby street shouted, “We don’t want him here.”\n\nFor Jamie Lash, 64, who is known to residents as “Auntie” for her ubiquitous presence in the area, the visit was deeply meaningful.\n\n“I just appreciate everybody coming to see us,” Ms. Lash said. “Because this gives us a sense of direction and says we ain’t by ourselves. And that means so much.”\n\nBut many neighbors expressed dissatisfaction. Dinah Bishop, a nurse who works about a mile from the grocery store, said a speech could do little to destroy longstanding racism in Buffalo.\n\nShaniah Paige, 39, who lives near the site of the community center, said that if it took lawmakers until this year to make lynching a federal crime, she did not believe that meaningful change would come soon.\n\n“We’re upset. When we’re down, we get free food and photo ops,” she said. “But this is embedded in decades of laws: America was built on racism.”\n\nFor Michael Mostiller Jr., who lives two blocks from the Tops grocery store with his wife, Letitia, Mr. Biden’s visit was “exciting.” He watched as the president arrived, pulling out his phone to snap an image. Still, he said he didn’t know what could change.\n\n“We’re caught in a Catch-22 situation,” he said. “When it comes to gun rights — people want their guns. You have to protect yourself. But do you need high-powered rifles? As far as them going after the social media outlets, I don’t think that’s a good idea because of freedom of speech. So I don’t know how they’re going to do it.”\n\nBuffalo has endured extreme segregation for decades, and the city’s Black residents have long said that they fare worse than their white counterparts in many areas of daily life.\n\nSome residents, like Daniel Love, 24, who works at a barbershop across the street from Tops, said that the East Side had long deserved more attention, and that the visit “should have been done a long time ago.”\n\nOthers said they worried about whether the area would receive the same level of attention after the visit was over and the next tragedy occurred.\n\n“I could care less about what Biden said, I want to see action,” said Toni Arrington, 27, a hair stylist who stood outside the community center where Mr. Biden spoke. “I want to see our community actually get help. I want to see people actually be protected. We work, we pay taxes, we pay for our protection and we’re not getting it.”\n\nAs she stood near the memorial across the street from Tops, Leslie Thomas, 61, said that she understood the visit had irritated some neighbors. But she added that she believed that it was a critical step for the community as it continues to mourn.\n\n“Whether some people want to believe it or not, it's just a president’s duty when something this drastic happens to show up and show his support,” said Ms. Thomas, who owns a boutique on Fillmore Avenue. “Some people are against him showing up. But that’s what leadership does.”\n\nZolan Kanno-Youngs and Lola Fadulu contributed reporting."
