Currently the Otto Eckstein Professor of Applied Economics in the Department of Economics and named Harvard College Professor in 2014, Professor Cutler holds secondary appointments at the Kennedy School of Government and the School of Public Health.\n\nProfessor Cutler was a key advisor in the formulation of the recent cost control legislation in Massachusetts, and is one of the members of the Health Policy Commission created to help reduce medical spending. He served on the Council of Economic Advisers and the National Economic Council during the Clinton Administration and has advised the Presidential campaigns of Bill Bradley, John Kerry, and Barack Obama as well as being Senior Health Care Advisor for the Obama Presidential Campaign.\n\nAs of 2016, U.S. health care expenditure accounted for 17.9% of GDP, averaging $10,348 per person. Much effort has been carried out in the past to control costs, most recently with the Affordable Care Act. His lecture examined how health care reform is playing out in the United States. The two acts correspond to two dimensions of reform: the political component and the market component.\n\nCarpenter Lecture 2018 Video\n\n(photo credit: Patricia Yusah)\n\n2017 Federal Reserve Challenge\n\nFriday, November 3, 2017\n\nFederal Reserve Bank, Boston, MA\n\nOn November 3, 2017, four Babson students (Leni Benacerraf, Camila Rioseco, Grant Smith, and Chelsea Yasgur) competed in the 2017 Boston Regional Fed Challenge competition. 22 colleges from across New England were represented this year at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.

It’s already in our phones, airplanes and cameras, and soon it will be in our cars, schools and houses. In this talk, Sendhil Mullainathan will argue that this same intelligence can help us make better policies. \"Better\" means not only more efficient but also fairer. Professor Mullainathan will illustrate these ideas in two areas: crime and health care. In both cases, he argues that we can cut costs, and improve quality of outcomes (less crime or better health) and be more fair. His prediction is that machine intelligence will serve as a decision aid and not as a substitute for human decision making.\n\nCarpenter Lecture, 2016 Recipient\n\nSendhil Mullainathan is one of the most renowned behavioral economists of our time. He is a recipient of the prestigious MacArthur \"Genius\" Award and is the Robert C. Waggoner Professor of Economics at Harvard University. He was designated a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum, labeled a Top 100 Global Thinker by Foreign Policy Magazine, and named by Wired (UK) the Smart List: 50 people who will change the world.\n\nProfessor Mullainathan’s work runs a wide gamut: the impact of poverty on mental bandwidth; whether CEO pay is excessive; using fictitious resumes to measure discrimination; showing that higher cigarette taxes make smokers happier; and modeling how competition affects media bias. His latest research focuses on using machine learning and data mining techniques to better understand human behavior.\n\nCarpenter Lecture 2016 Video\n\n​Professor Se​ndhil Mullainathan, Winn Auditorium, Babson College\n\n\"A Career in Economics ... it’s so much mo​re than you think.\"\n\nA video from the American Economic Association— A Career in Economics​\n\nRecommended Economics Graduate Electives for Spring 2016\n\nECN7555 Health Economics (Professor Yunwei Gai)\n\nWith health care approaching 20% of U.S. DP, health care sector provides unparalled job and entrepreneur opportunities.

This course will examnie majore players in this industry including pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, insurance companies, physicians, patients and the government. You will use big data techniques to analyze problems and opportunities facing each player.\n\nECN7550 Business Strategy and Game Theory (Professor Kankana Mukherjee)\n\nThis course makes extensive use of Game Theory to analyze strategy in a competitive context. The emphasis is not only on how to play a given ’business game’ well but undertanding the strategies behind how to shape the ’business game’. It will enable you to give expert decisions, entry deterrence, mergers, product positioning, diversification, make or buy decisions, negotiating, and bidding.

Economics Division Chair, Lidija Polutnik started the tribute followed by his colleagues (John Marthinsen, Kent Jones, Joe Ricciardi, Brian Barefoot, and Robert McAuliffe).\n\nProfessor Polutnik spoke of Bill Casey’s 5 Research Lessons:\n\nA research career is a marathon, not a sprint.\n\nFocus is great, but do not hesitate to take a detour (if interesting and productive).\n\nIn marketing the products of your research, do not ignore the demand side of the market.\n\n\"Milking\" a particular line of research can be productive and rewarding.\n\nDevelop synergies with your teaching and research but do not hesitate to lead a two-track professional life. Babson will reward both and one may be more exportable than the other.\n\nODE Awardees, 2014\n\nTuesday, May 6. 2014\n\nThe induction ceremony for the 2014 ODE awards was held on Tuesday, May 6, 2014 at the Wellesley Room, Olin Hall.

The new economy focuses on ecological sustainability, with renewable energy and closed loop principles at its core. But it has other, less recognized aspects. These include a new economics of scale, in which smaller networked units can achieve high productivity; the economic value of social connection; and the new patterns of time use which can rebalance the labor market and reduce carbon and eco-footprints. Using the concept of \"plenitude,\" a low footprint, time-affluent, high-satisfaction alternative to BAU, Professor Schor will outline her vision for shifting from the current ecologically destructive and increasingly dysfunctional economy to one that meets human needs in a sustainable way.\n\nJulier Schor is a Professor of Sociology at Boston College. She is also a member of the MacArthur Foundation Connected Learning Research Network. Before joining Boston College, she taught at Harvard University for 17 years, in the Department of Economics and the Committee on Degrees in Women’s Studies. A graduate of Wesleyan University, Schor received her Ph.D. in economics at the University of Massachusetts.\n\nHer most recent book is True Wealth: How and Why millions of Americans are Creating a Time-Rich, Ecologically Light, Small-Scale, High-Satisfaction Economy. Previous books include national best-seller The Overworked American: The Unexpected Decline of Leisure. This book appeared on the best-seller lists of The New York Times, Publisher’s Weekly, The Chicago Tribune, The Village Voice, The Boston Globe as well as the annual best books list for the The New York Times, Business Week, and other publications. The book is widely credited for influencing the national debate on work and family.\n\nSchor is currently working on issues on environmental sustainability and their relation to Americans’ lifestyle and the economy and the emergence of a conscious consumption movement. She is co-founder of the Board of the Center for a New American Dream (newdream.org), a national sustainability organization.\n\nLecture Video\n\n\"The IMF and Global Financial Crisis\" with Joseph Joyce\n\nFebruary 5, 2013\n\nOlin 120\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe IMF’s response to the global crisis of 2008-9 marked a significant change from its past policies. The Fund provided relatively large amounts of credit quickly with limited conditions and accepted the use of capital controls. Professor Joyce’s book traces the evolution of the IMF’s actions to promote international financial stability from the Bretton Woods era through the most recent crisis. The analysis includes an examination of the IMF’s crisis management activities during the debt crisis of the 1980s, the upheavals in emerging markets in the 1990s and early 2000s, and the ongoing European crisis.\n\nJoseph P. Joyce is a Professor Economics at Wellesley College and the Faculty Director of the Madeleine Korbel Albright Institute for Global Affairs. Professor Joyce’s research deals with issues in financial globalization. His book, The IMF and Global Financial Crises: Phoenix Rising?, has been published by Cambridge University Press.\n\nCollege Federal Challenge Competition, 2012\n\nNovember 9, 2012\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston, Boston, MA\n\nBabson College Team competing in the 2012 Fed Challenge (Regionals)\n\nLeft to right: Federal Reserve Director of Economic Education, Professor Nestor Azcona (faculty advisor), Gabriel Breitenstein, Brendan Metcalf, Gerald Lee, Sanjay Zimmerman, Professor Frederic Chartier (Faculty Advisor)\n\nOmicron Delta Epsilon International Honor Society, 2012\n\nWednesday, May 9, 2012\n\nThe outstanding undergraduate students who have consistently performed at a high level in their economics courses as well as in their overall Babson curriculum were given the Omicron Delta Epsilon International Honor Society awards in Economics.

Whereas traditional economic models portray individuals as rational, self-interested, self-controlled human beings, behaviorists know that people are deficient when it comes to these desirable characteristics. We are far less rational than we think (and hope) we are. Yet, our situation is not hopeless, because we are irrational in specific, systematic ways. That makes behavior, even in its irrationality, predictable. In this presentation, we will touch on three specific issues. We will discover why people procrastinate even when it is not in their long run best interest to do so. We will discuss ways of overcoming procrastination. Last but not least, we will analyze experimental results that show altruists to be cheaters and egoists to be truth-tellers.\n\nCollege Fed Challenge Competition, 2011\n\nWednesday, November 9, 2011\n\n7:45 a.m.–12:45 p.m., Federal Reserve of Boston\n\nOn November 9th a team of six Babson students participated in the Fed Challenge Competition. This is an academic competition for college undergraduates that promotes in depth analysis of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions in relationship to the US Macro economy. Babson’s visiting Professor Alexei Orlov helped the Babson crew, consisting of Joseph Blundo, Kirsten Daley, Andreas Hwang, Pierre Keusseyan, Bashar Lazaar and Mark Maclay, prepare for their presentation. While the Babson team didn’t qualify for one of the top four spots, Professor Orlov felt that our students represented the College with the flying colors and did a terrific job on their analysis of current economic conditions and in their recommendation for for Fed monetary policy. By all accounts students really enjoyed the experience of competing with teams from the best colleges in the New England. According to Babson senior Mark Maclay, “We all worked hard and pushed ourselves to learn more, think more, and push the limits of our knowledge and understanding of the most complicated concepts in economics.”\n\n\"India’s Business Cycles: Evidence and Theory\"\n\nby: Rucha Bhate, Part-Time Lecturer\n\nWednesday, October 26, 2011\n\n3–4 p.m., Horn 159\n\nAbstract\n\nIndia is one of the fastest growing emerging economies in the world today with an average quarterly GDP growth of 8.1 percent between 2004-2010. We use annual time series data and filtering methods to document the key statistics of India’s business cycle. Output, consumption and investment are more volatile in India as compared to the developed economies. Like in the developed countries, consumption is less volatile and investment is more volatile than output in the Indian data. Unlike in the former, investment is not highly correlated with output. We test whether a standard real business cycle model subject to technology and fiscal shocks, with parameters calibrated for the Indian economy can replicate the key features of India’s business cycle\n\n“The European Debt Crisis and the New Economic Architecture in the EU: The Need for New Institutions and Structural Change”\n\nBy: Dr. Kostas Axarloglou\n\nMonday, October 3, 2011\n\n4–5 p.m., Olin Auditorium\n\nDr. Kostas Axarloglou is a professor of International Business and Strategy at Democritus University of Thrace, Greece.
