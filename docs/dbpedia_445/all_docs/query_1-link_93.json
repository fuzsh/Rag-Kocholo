        "text": "About Engineers Canada\n\nEngineers Canada is the national organizations of the 12 provincial and territorial engineering regulators who license the country’s more than 290,000 professional engineers. We serve these regulators by delivering national programs to ensure the highest standards of engineering education, professional qualifications and professional practice.\n\nWe are the voice of our members in national and international affairs and promote greater understanding of the nature, role and contribution of engineers to society.\n\nPresident’s Message\n\nThe past year has been a time of very positive renewal for Engineers Canada. We have initiated a number of significant and positive changes within the organization to position us to serve our member regulators better than ever before. Engineers Canada has committed to ensuring that we never lose focus on our core functions of accreditation, qualifications, and regulatory support, and to bring transparency, accountability and value to all that we do.\n\nOur accreditation system remains one of the most important services that Engineers Canada performs on behalf of our member regulators. However, we know that our system must evolve quickly to keep pace with the changes that have taken place in the delivery of engineering education. The status quo is simply untenable. This remains our greatest single challenge at Engineers Canada, and it is a challenge that must be overcome together with the involvement of our regulators and the higher education institutions that we accredit.\n\nEngineers Canada has also continued its work to produce a number of national model guidelines for the profession, and is further facilitating the development of tools and data to assist the regulators in the assessment of the qualifications of foreign trained applicants for licensure. Our regulators must have the support they need to ensure that all those seeking licensure are treated in a fair, consistent, and defensible manner regardless of where they received their training and experience. We can achieve this by working together through Engineers Canada.\n\nIn addition to our work towards our goal of facilitating regulatory excellence, we’ve also launched some new offerings for engineers themselves—such as the Infrastructure Resilience Professional certification program, the Engineers Canada Mobility Register, the Managing Transitions guide to help engineers and their employers navigate career transitions, and the Retiree Health and Dental Program. We've also instituted new outreach initiatives to promote engineering to young Canadians and to the public, including the first Future City Competitions in Canada, the launch of the EngScape website, and the Engineers Canada Photo Contest. In addition, we've continued and improved upon the work being done in key areas, including our 30 by 30 initiatives, government relations work, and National Engineering Month, just to name a few.\n\nIt's clear that Engineers Canada's activities in 2016 spanned an enormous range. This report outlines our achievements and progress on those key files that support our four main goals--regulatory excellence, confidence in the profession, the sustainability of the profession, and the protection of the engineering terms. The report also recognizes engineering excellence in highlighting the noteworthy accomplishments of the engineers we celebrated in 2016 with Engineers Canada awards, scholarships and fellowships.\n\nAs we reflect on our 2016 activities, I would like to thank the Engineers Canada staff, Board members, our member regulators and our volunteers for their hard work this past year, and for their ongoing commitment to advancing the engineering profession. It has been an honor to serve as President, and I look forward to seeing what we will accomplish together in 2017.\n\nChris D. Roney, FEC, P.Eng., BDS, IntPE, UE\n\nPresident\n\nThe Journey to Excellence\n\nIn 2016, Engineers Canada embarked on a Journey to Excellence, in which staff and the organization as a whole committed itself to continuous improvement. By the end of the year, an independent team of verifiers recognized this dedication to the principles of organizational excellence, innovation and wellness and certified Engineers Canada at the bronze level of Excellence Canada’s Excellence, Wellness, and Innovation Standard.\n\nThis standard touches on almost all aspects of the organization, including Leadership and Governance, Strategy and Planning, Customer Experience, People Engagement, Process and Project Management, and Partners and Supplies. A cross-functional Excellence Council was established within Engineers Canada in early 2016 to lead staff through the process of evaluating current policies, plans and procedures, and identifying opportunities for improvement in line with the standard’s criteria in those six areas.\n\nHaving achieved the bronze certification in December 2016, the Journey to Excellence will continue into 2017 and beyond as Engineers Canada undertakes further continuous improvement efforts that will ultimately enhance the organization’s ability to serve the engineering profession.\n\nEnd 1: Regulatory excellence\n\nEngineers Canada is to ensure that a current framework, standards, practices and systems, and a means to effectively transfer knowledge to facilitate regulatory excellence are available to the provincial and territorial engineering regulators.\n\nFramework for Regulation\n\nThe Framework for Regulation is a set of aspirational elements developed through consultation with the regulators to support their mandate to regulate the practice of engineering, license the members of the profession and to serve and protect the public interest. The Framework does so by capturing excellent national and international practices, responding to emerging trends and challenges, and facilitating fair practices that are accessible, timely, monitored, transparent, objective, impartial and just.\n\nIn 2016, 17 new elements were drafted and provided to the regulators for their input and feedback. The comments received will be consolidated into the Framework as development continues.\n\nQualifications Board\n\nIn 2016, the Qualifications Board successfully published the following new or updated documents:\n\nNational guideline on assuming responsibility for the work of engineers-in-training\n\nNational guideline on sustainable development and environmental stewardship for professional engineers\n\nNational guideline on returning to active practice\n\nNational guideline on the code of ethics\n\nNational model guide: Conflict of interest\n\nWhite paper on professional practice in software engineering\n\nThe Qualifications Board also held its first webinars on the new software engineering white paper and on its sustainable development and environmental stewardship guideline. These webinars were successful in providing explanation and context on the new Qualifications Board documents, and the Qualifications Board intends to hold more webinars for other new or revised guidelines.\n\nAccreditation Board\n\nIn 2016, the Accreditation Board completed on-site peer reviews of 43 programs at 10 academic institutions to determine if those engineering programs meet or exceed the educational standards acceptable for professional engineering licensure. These peer review teams—composed of close to 100 volunteers—provided information to the Accreditation Board to make accreditation decisions.\n\nIn June, accreditation decisions were made based on the reports of these peer reviews, with two new engineering programs being granted accreditation in 2016.\n\nThe Accreditation Board also continued to review the documentation required to be completed by the programs and institutions receiving visits. It has delivered workshops to identify workload reduction for programs receiving visits and for Accreditation Board volunteers.\n\nThe Engineers Canada Board adopted a number of changes to the accreditation criteria in September 2016. These changes were published in the 2016 Accreditation Criteria and Procedures Report.\n\nAccreditation Forum\n\nIn August 2016, over 100 people from the engineering community attended Engineers Canada’s first Forum on Accreditation in Toronto, ON. Representatives from engineering regulators, students, deans, industry and Engineers Canada’s board and committees met to clarify a shared vision for the future of accreditation of engineering education in Canada. Attendees discussed the purpose, outcomes, trends, opportunities and future solutions for accreditation, and these discussions produced recommendations that were voted on and prioritized. Engineers Canada is working with relevant stakeholders to investigate these priorities further to action the recommendations produced by the Forum.\n\nMutual Recognition Agreements and Mobility\n\nIn 2016, Engineers Canada continued to demonstrate its commitment to facilitating the international mobility of licensed engineers. In November, Engineers Canada launched the Engineers Canada Mobility Register, which grants qualified engineers designations that indicate they are part of an exclusive group of professionals who meet a high standard of competence and who are prepared to conduct engineering practices internationally. Engineers on the register have the right to use the APEC Engineer or IntPE designations, showing potential clients and employers that they are an experienced and well-qualified engineer. In some international jurisdictions, these engineers may also experience faster registration as a result of their inclusion on the register.\n\nEngineers Canada also renewed its Mutual Recognition Agreement with the Texas Board of Professional Engineers in June 2016. The five-year agreement is intended to permit the recognition of professional credentials for engineers looking to relocate.\n\nAdmissions and Assessments\n\nThe National Admissions Officials Group (NAOG) met four times in 2016 to discuss registration best practices, facilitate knowledge transfer between regulators on admissions issues across the country, and share information about Engineers Canada initiatives.\n\nOnline Competency-based Assessment Project\n\nIn September 2016, Engineers Canada decided to partner with APEGBC and expand their online competency-based assessment tool into a pan-Canadian tool, available for use by interested regulators nationally. An initial pilot group consisting of APEGS, Engineers & Geoscientists New Brunswick, Engineers Nova Scotia, and Engineers PEI met in November to discuss approaches for piloting the system, establish the User Steering Group, and determine how to share best practices and lessons learned. The Online Competency-based Assessment Project will enable the national adoption of competency-based assessment of engineering work experience with this online tool.\n\nDiscipline and Enforcement\n\nAt the annual meeting of the National Discipline and Enforcement Officials Group in June 2016, representatives from each engineering regulator shared updates about current practices, discussed relevant cases and legal challenges, and identified ways to collaborate and share information more effectively.\n\nProfessional Practice\n\n2016 saw the creation of a National Practice Officials Group, which has been tasked with providing a liaison among the provincial/territorial regulators on matters pertaining to Professional Practice. The Group will share information, discuss policies, and learn from the promising practices of each regulator as they related to Professional Practice.\n\nThe Group had its first meeting in November 2016 to discuss issues pertaining to professional practice, including continuing professional development requirements, quality management programs, and sharing guidelines.\n\nCase law catalogue\n\nEngineers Canada launched an online case law catalogue in 2016, to provide a central repository of case law across Canada that is of interest to regulators and to the engineering profession. The catalogue collects and summarizes case law that could have an impact on the regulation of the engineering profession. The catalogue will be updated as new, relevant cases are decided.\n\nEnd 2: Confidence in the profession\n\nEngineers Canada works to ensure that stakeholders have evidence that engineers meet high standards, practise with competence and integrity, and that their work and self-regulation benefit society.\n\nPublic Perceptions Survey\n\nTo better understand the public’s perception of the value, impact, opportunities and challenges of the engineering profession, Engineers Canada conducted a survey of Canadians in December 2016. Overall, the findings painted a positive picture for engineering in Canada. Foundational perceptions of the profession are strong and promising, but at the same time, there is room for the profession to increase its presence in the minds of Canadians and to position itself as a leader on key issues facing the country.\n\nNational Position Statements\n\nEngineers Canada’s Public Affairs team reviewed and updated all Engineers Canada National Position Statements to bring them up-to-date and ensure that they properly reflect the profession’s position on key issues. In addition, given shifting government priorities and new areas of focus, three new National Position Statements were written and adopted by the Board:\n\nScience, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) education\n\nInfrastructure on First Nations Reserves and in Remote Communities\n\nInnovation and Productivity\n\nIssue Statements\n\nNew Issue Statements were released in 2016 on three key national issues that relate to engineering and that describe the work that Engineers Canada is undertaking with the provincial and federal governments to advance the interests of the engineering profession:\n\nIncorporating climate vulnerability assessments into infrastructure design/build requests for proposals\n\nA national dialogue to modernize maternity and parental leave\n\nProfessional practice in software engineering\n\nIn March 2016, Engineers Canada hosted its most successful Contact Day on Parliament Hill. Members of the Bridging Government and Engineers Committee, an engineering student, and Engineers Canada staff met with 40 members of Parliament (MP) from three parties and representing nine provinces and territories. The meetings were a way of introducing many of the new MPs to the engineering profession, and they touched on a number of the profession’s government relations priority issues, including climate-resilient infrastructure, diversity in the engineering profession, and the important role that engineers play in safeguarding the environment, the economy and Canadians. The meetings also demonstrated to the MPs how the engineering profession could be a valuable resource in providing the evidence base for public policy decision-making.\n\nSenate testimony\n\nIn April 2016, Engineers Canada was invited to provide written and oral testimony to the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce during its study on internal trade barriers. The resulting report from the Standing Committee made seven recommendations to help reduce internal barriers to trade and improve labour mobility in Canada, and it looked favourably upon the work that the engineering profession has done to improve the mobility of engineers across Canada.\n\nGovernment submissions\n\nEngineers Canada also submitted recommendations and comments to the federal government on a range of issues that impact the profession, including:\n\nThe 2016 federal budget\n\nThe draft terms of reference for the expert panel that will advise on the National Energy Board’s modernization\n\nThe draft terms of reference for the expert panel that will advise on environmental assessment processes\n\nImmigration\n\nThe importance of improving infrastructure climate resiliency\n\nCommunity infrastructure\n\nThe Federal Sustainable Development Strategy for Canada, 2016-2019\n\nInnovation\n\nMaternity and parental leave benefits\n\nPublic Infrastructure Engineering Vulnerability Committee\n\nThe past year saw a significant increase in awareness and utilization of the Public Infrastructure Engineering Vulnerability Committee (PIEVC) Protocol, not only among infrastructure engineers, but also in industries that work closely with engineers or that call upon their expertise on a regular basis. For example, the PIEVC Protocol was included for the first time in recommendations made by the Canadian Electricity Association to Canadian electric utilities as a climate adaptation tool that should be integrated into the electricity sector’s planning.\n\nAs part of this effort to increase the awareness of the PIEVC Protocol as a climate adaptation tool, the Protocol was presented at eight conferences and at five presentations at forums and annual general meetings. 2016 saw the delivery of seven PIEVC workshops and the completion of five projects using the Protocol, with several more in progress by the year’s end.\n\nInfrastructure Resilience Professional\n\nIn June 2016, Engineers Canada launched a new Infrastructure Resilience Professional (IRP) certification program for professional engineers. The training that this program provides equips engineers with the additional knowledge and competencies they need to plan, design and manage resilient infrastructure in the face of a changing climate.\n\nThe first cohort of IRP program graduates were presented with their designations in June. Infrastructure owners and operators, governments, and the public can have increased confidence that the recommendations and approvals made by these IRP-certified engineers are supported by advanced training and experience in climate vulnerability assessment, risk management and climate adaptation.\n\nWorld Federation of Engineering Organizations\n\nEngineers Canada continued its participation in the World Federation of Engineering Organization’s Committee on Engineering and the Environment, with a focus on climate change adaptation and the international application of the PIEVC Protocol.\n\nIn May 2016, Engineers Canada participated in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Meetings in Bonn, Germany, where it delivered a workshop on the PIEVC Protocol and hosted a daily “Engineers Hour” to engage delegates and attending engineers on the role of engineering in climate adaptation and mitigation. 2016 also saw the UNFCCC Adaptation Fund supply funding for its first PIEVC project when the protocol was applied to local water systems in Costa Rica. The project got underway in the fall of 2016.\n\nEngStudio\n\nEngineers Canada launched a Photo Contest in November 2016, in an effort to engage the engineering community in celebrating Canadian engineering achievements and Canadian engineers.
