        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\nRecent Publications Relating to Canada PREPARED IN THE EDITORIAL DEPARTMENT OF UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO PRESS INCORPORATED BY MICHAEL D. STEVENSON This bibliography is intended to provide as complete coverage as possible of newly available material useful in the study ofany aspect ofCanadian history. In keeping with the diverse backgrounds and interests ofour readers, both scholarly and well-researched popular sources are regularly listed. It should be noted that items of a purely contemporary or speculative nature and lacking appreciable historical content are normally excluded. Furthermore, accessibility considerations logically dictate that materials cited have appeared in published form, theses traditionally being the sole exception . Suggestions for possible inclusion in Recent Publications are welcomed and should be forwarded with the necessary technical information to the compiler at the Canadian Historical Review offices. See also Canadiana, a monthly list ofCanadian publications prepared by the National Library, Ottawa; International Perspectives; journal ofthe Parliaments ofthe Commonwealth, issued quarterly by the General Council ofthe Commonwealth Parliamentary Association; and in the University ofToronto Quarterly, 'Letters in Canada,' published in the November issue. Regionally oriented bibliographies are included in each issue of Acadiensis, BC Studies, and Revue d'histoire de l'Amerique .franf(lise. MA and PHD theses listed were reported as recently completed in the Register ofPost-Graduate Dissertations in Progress in History and Related Subjects (CHA) for the current year. Users ofthis bibliography should bear in mind that all titles are listed only once. Because ofsubject overlap, alternative categories should be consulted. ABORIGINAL HISTORY BARMAN, JEAN.
