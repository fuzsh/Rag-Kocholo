Indeed, in 2018, UQTR invested in building a cleanroom in the Pierre-Boucher Pavilion, which allows for the control of airborne microparticle quantities. In 2019, it was decided to dedicate this cleanroom to highly delicate manipulations involving DNA extracted from traces.\n\nThe infrastructure associated with the Forensic Science Research Group\n\nThe GRSF benefits from the forensic science teaching infrastructure at UQTR:\n\nCrime Scene Lab\n\nIntended to offer a review of everything learned during an undergraduate degree, the Crime Scene Lab has both a wet room (meant to simulate a kitchen, bathroom, etc.) and an adjoining dry room (den, bedroom, or living room), which can be either connected to or separated from each other though a common corridor.\n\nForensic Photography Lab\n\nThis lab is a professional photography studio reserved for reproducing photos of items and traces presented for analysis. It has a bottomless table, a light table, two lightboxes, four professional 1100W flashes, each powered by two power packs, four 6500K lights, two Lumahawks (continuous 1200W at 6500K), reflectors, and deflectors.\n\nLuminescence Lab\n\nThis dark lab with 12 fully equipped workstations (photographic columns, still cameras, monochromatic lamps, excitation and emission filters) allows users to record raw and revealed traces using optical techniques based on selective absorption and luminescence (fingerprints, footwear traces, tool marks, contaminants, etc.).\n\nForensic Chemistry Lab\n\nThis lab has been designed for the examination of various forms of physical, chemical, and biological traces that students and researchers will encounter. It is safe and equipped with all the supplies an organic chemist requires (lab glassware, balances, ultrasonic cleaners, shakers, fume hoods, ovens, etc.), including two cyanoacrylate fuming tanks, a vacuum fuming tank (donation from the provincial police force), and a microtome.\n\nOptical Forensic Lab\n\nThis lab has been designed to observe and analyze samples (fibres, soil, glass, paint chips) through different levels of magnification, and their comparative identification by polarization microscopy. Data can be recorded on a dedicated system thanks to a set of cameras and focal tubes and professional camera equipment. The lab also has a microtome, 11 stereo microscopes, and 12 optic microscopes.\n\nForensic Analysis Lab\n\nIn the concept of a specific training for forensics, lab 3132 is the place where evidence is submitted and students perform their first observations and analyzes to determine the appropriate analytical strategy for the inquiry. It is also where testing is completed by consulting the analytical data for the profile’s requirements and the drafting of various reports."
