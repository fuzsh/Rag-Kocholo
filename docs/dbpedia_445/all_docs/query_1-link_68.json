Editorial assistance was provided by Isobel Scavetta.\n\nIntroduction\n\nPolicing Cybercrime\n\nAlthough the rate of most crimes appears to have been decreasing over the past three decades, the same cannot be said for cybercrimes (Van Dijk, Tseloni, and Farrell 2012, 245). The increase of digital aspects in everyday life has made crime and victimization in cyberspace a regular occurrence (Bryant and Bryant 2016). To that end, the rate of cybercrime has been steadily increasing over the past decade, and continues to be likely underreported (Caneppele and Aebi 2017; Levi et al. 2017; Levi 2017). Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, during which the number of incidents of cybercrime in the UK had increased (Buil-Gil, MirÃ³-Llinares, Moneva, Kemp and DÃ­az-CastaÃ±o 2020), incidents had been falling in England and Wales, though cybercrime still represented a larger proportion of all reported crime. The number of victims of total crime Telephone-operated Crime Survey for England and Wales (TCSEW) including fraud and computer misuse decreased by 19% in April to June 2020 compared with January to March 2020 (ONS, 2020). This is also true for the small number of countries which conduct general social survey measures of cybercrime as part of their general crime surveys or as separate modules on sub-sets of cybercrime such as identity crime. (See also successive Eurobarometer surveys for data within the EU 28 as a whole.) An increase in cybercriminal activity means that transactions that involve the proceeds of crime increasingly occur in whole or in part in cyberspace (Ablon, Libicki, and Golay 2014; Allodi, Corradin, and Massacci 2016; Higbee 2018; Hill 2018).\n\nThe uptick in cybercrime has resulted in the formation of digital policing units and computer emergency response teams (CERTs) in jurisdictions around the world (Harkin, Whelan, and Chang 2018; Boes and Leukfeldt 2017; DÃ©cary-HÃ©tu 2016), as well as within industry (Holt 2018). Despite the increase in such units and cybersecurity spending, global law enforcement and private capacity to investigate and police cybercrime competently are not sufficient to respond efficiently in real time (McMurdie 2016), due to the quickly-evolving and vast nature of these crimes (Holt 2018), which typically involve more effort and cross-border expense and access difficulties than do most offline crimes in the Pursue mode. Policing has been slow to adjust to the rise of digital crimes and fraud, not least because it often means giving up functions currently performed, which meet resistance (HMICFRS 2019a, 2019b). âEffectivenessâ in policing cybercrime needs to be clearly defined and should be seen on a spectrum. The evolution of cybercrime and cyber offender strategies is fast paced, making studying and reporting on them a difficult task. In addition to this challenge, the vast majority of research is undertaken, produced, and disseminated in English and focuses on a minority of sites where actively publishing western academics are based (Cross 2018).\n\nYet, the scope of cyber offenders, their involvement in a range of illegal activities, and the costs of policing cyber offenders, stemming from cross-jurisdictional offences, generate serious concerns for law enforcement agencies throughout the world (Carroll and Windle 2018; Gilmour 2014; Malby et al. 2013). However, little is known about the attitudes of law enforcement towards cyber offenders in those countries in which state-sponsored and state-tolerated cyber offending occurs: it is simply assumed or inferred from unsuccessful pursuit that little is being done there, at least until they victimise their local populations, setting aside often well-informed and severe reactions to those deemed to be âpolitical opponentsâ or acting without authorisation from those in power. Cyber offenders operate broadly across borders, creating mutual legal assistance problems, which arise from variation in legal definitions provided by different statutes (Harkin, Whelan, and Chang 2018; McMurdie 2016) as well as institutional problems of conflicting priorities even where the offenders are not state-sponsored or state-tolerated/corruptors. Except where political pressure or comity can be applied from abroad, enforcement agencies generally prioritise their domestic cases over international ones. As a result, cyber offenders encounter police services that differ in their approaches for detecting, investigating, and disrupting incidents associated with cyber offenders and their collaborators/competitors. These discrepancies, in turn, lead to uncertainties about the use of disruption strategies and their effectiveness, particularly in cross-border contexts, in addition to any uncertainties for evaluations arising from uneven but generally poor data availability.\n\nWith limited resources and expertise, especially in opportunity principle countries where discretion is formally allowed, law enforcement must make explicit or implicit strategic decisions in its approach, focusing on what it believes will yield the largest impacts while working within the political and economic constraints of its local jurisdictions. Law enforcement alone is ill-equipped to provide comprehensive protection against attacks in cyberspace (Boes and Leukfeldt 2017; Broadhurst 2006). Understanding this reality (and in some cases seeing an opportunity for marketing their security services, especially in the aftermath of high-profile breaches), private companies and security firms invest billions of dollars in cybersecurity programs designed to monitor cyberspace for breaches, search for and patch vulnerabilities, and develop assets to protect against and respond to the large array of potential cyber-dependent and cyber-enabled threats.\n\nYet, despite continuing calls for increased and improved police cooperation and public-private partnerships (PPPs) (EUROPOL 2018), such cooperation is handicapped by the complexities of unhomogenised criminal statutes, policies, and regulations, coupled with the time required to prepare for and actually engage in successful international cooperation (Boes and Leukfeldt 2017; Malby et al. 2013). Given the lack of public information available on cooperation, these partnerships are difficult to systematically identify and assess. The transnational character of many cybercrimes complicates how law enforcement organizations cooperate and respond to cybercrime offenders and victims (Levi et al. 2015; Cross and Blackshaw 2015; Chang 2012). In addition, a chronic issue that law enforcement faces in regards to cybercrime is attributing crimes to the criminal actors responsible (in fact and in terms of evidential rules), thus rendering their capture and prosecution difficult even if mutual legal assistance were financially feasible on a practical basis at scale (Europol 2015). It is unlikely significant advances in attribution can be easily and effectively made in the short term. Accordingly, near-term strategies to combat cybercrime must focus largely on prevention and disruption, and on resilience.\n\nDespite ongoing challenges in terms of resources and cooperation, transnational cybercrime enforcement has produced significant accomplishments, with successful takedowns of notable cryptomarkets, including AlphaBay, Hansa, and RAMP, as well as the Avalanche cloud-based bulletproof hosting service (EUROPOL 2018). However, little is known about how cyber criminals, who depend on such platforms and who evade law enforcement operations, displace their activities following the seizure of these services. Anecdotal evidence points to displacement to services that are in Eastern European countries including Russia, Ukraine, and Moldova, where enforcement and/or regulation appear to be lax or non-existent (Leyden 2017).\n\nThough it is important to guard against the assumption that all crime groups are flexible geographically, it is likely that, as law enforcement improves at the country and regional level, some cybercriminals, not bounded by physical boundaries and engaged in scams or activities that are not geographically dependent for their success, transplant the bases for their criminal activities and operations to countries with weaker enforcement, legislation, and security regimes (Boes and Leukfeldt 2017). Despite such likely displacement outcomes, research on cyber offenders and their victims typically focuses on select case studies in specific geographical areas. Consequently, researchers have allocated relatively few resources to studying non-Western cyber contexts and non-English speaking contexts (Kshetri 2013, 2015; Cross 2018; Smith, Cheung, and Yiu-Chung Lau 2015).\n\nCurrent research identifies various types of cybercrimes (Trend Micro 2016; Wall 2007; Wilson 2008; Yar 2013; Brenner 2010; Sood, Bansal, and Enbody 2013), their scripts and business models (Soudijn and Zegers 2012; Leukfeldt, Lavorgna, and Kleemans 2017; Warren et al. 2017; Kshetri 2010; Chaudhry 2017; Hutchings and Holt 2015), how criminals become involved and interact among themselves (Goldsmith and Brewer 2015; Lusthaus 2018; Broadhurst et al. 2014), the relationships between criminal actors and their victims (Leukfeldt 2014; Whitty and Buchanan 2012), and, where relevant, the vulnerabilities these crimes exploit (Arora, Yadav, and Sharma 2018; De Groot 2019; Guitton 2013; Kharraz et al. 2015; Vasek, Thornton, and Moore 2014; Zimba, Wang, and Mulenga 2019; Chadd 2018; Jakobsson and Young 2005; Lathrop and Stanisz 2016; Ulsch 2014; Zimba and Chishimba 2019).\n\nFinancial Aspects of Cybercrime\n\nThis project is focused on the modest but emerging literature on the laundering of the proceeds of cybercrime (BÃ¥Ã¥th and Zellhorn 2016; Campbell-Verduyn 2018; Constantin 2017; Custers, Pool, and Cornelisse 2018; Fanusie and Robinson 2018; Hyman 2015; McGuire 2018, 2019). Among countries, there are variations in the legal definition of laundering, but most jurisdictions include self-laundering and any action to conceal or even simply move the proceeds of crime. Evidently, cybercriminals implement a diverse array of economic transfer schemes. The strategies used are likely linked to the type of currency or digital asset received during the commission of a crime. To that end, it is imperative to investigate how cybercriminals use both crypto- and fiat currencies to accept and extort payment, transfer funds, and pay out on their obligations both to themselves and to others in their criminal supply chain.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAblon, Lillian, Martin C Libicki, and Andrea A Golay. 2014.

It has three prominent characteristics: it is multilingual; it provides background on education, law enforcement strategy, and regulation vis-Ã -vis cybercrime in countries with significant internet user bases, and; it analyses how cybercriminals conduct financial transactions, to the extent of our understanding of these transactions.\n\nMost research on cybercrime published within the academic and grey literature is in English. Accordingly, we have undertaken a systematic search to identify documents that address financial transactions in cybercrime. We have engaged in similar searchers in four additional languages: Chinese, French, Russian, and Spanish, to determine if there were concerns in these spaces that the English-language literature failed to consider. This research has made it clear that there is an ongoing need for more country- and region-specific research and for more multi-lingual analyses of cybercrime and related processes. Cybercrime can, and often does, transcends borders. While there exist reports within the grey literature that examine cybercrime and cyberthreats through a global lens, these publications often do not provide detail regarding significant local and regional considerations and may overlook concerns that may only have prima facie domestic or regional impacts.\n\nEducation, law enforcement, and regulation of countries that use the languages considered for administrative purposes and have more than 20 million internet users vis-Ã -vis cybercrime vary greatly. Developed economies are increasingly investing in cybersecurity and cybercrime prevention. In some cases, these governments rely on public-private partnerships to augment capacity. The production of government research varies considerably in terms of depth, frequency, and quality, but developed countries appear to be increasing law enforcement capacity to cope with cybercrime. However, our review also indicates that, despite calls for cooperation and capacity building, emerging economies continue to struggle to develop research and investigative units capable of doing the analysis that is undertaken in established economies. Awareness and in-depth analysis of these issues are low in English publications, which tend to focus disproportionally on English-centric data and concerns that affect the Global North.\n\nWhile this project is limited by not including additional, commonly-spoken languages (e.g. Arabic and Portuguese), it shows that there is a significant weakness in cybercrime research in non-English contexts that must be considered as we think about cybercrime ecosystems. Should it persist, this failure will have an increasingly negative impact globally, particularly as more non-English speaking individuals from emerging economies join the ranks of everyday internet users. Their presence as potential offenders or victims in cybercrime is an issue that has received almost no attention to date.\n\nWithin the limitations within the literature we offer an analytical overview of the what is known, the lessons learned from the literature surveyed, and the outstanding gaps regarding transactions in cybercriminal activity. Driving our analysis are two questions. First, âHow do cyber offender business models operate?â In considering this question throughout the research, we catalogue what is known regarding (a) how cybercriminals structure their financial operations (i.e., how money is obtained, transferred, and cashed-out; and the strategies, products, players, and services involved); (b) the role of virtual currencies and other technologies in existing offender models; and (c) how cybercriminal activity enables or interacts with offline or largely offline economic crimes, such as money laundering, fraud, extortion, and corruption. Second, âWhat are current law enforcement and industry practices aimed at disrupting these business models?â To evaluate these two questions throughout this project we catalogue what is known regarding (a) what evidence there is to determine how effective disruption approaches are in preventing offenders from obtaining, transferring, and cashing-out ill-gotten funds; (b) what we know about the extent of income or profits that offenders make from cybercrime; (c) how costs to offenders can be increased to reduce the rewards for committing crime; and (d) how political considerations, including political will and legislation, affect enforcement responses, including strategies employed, funding, and international cooperation.\n\nOur analysis is tempered by the limitations of the extant literature. Many accounts of the financial aspects of cybercrime and what they entail â in all languages â are incomplete. Cybercrime research tends to focus on the commissioning stages of the offense up to the point at which victimisation occurs, but not beyond. Even when accounts are detailed, data sources are not transparent, and estimates often make assumptions regarding the prevalence, costs of operation, and costs of victimisation, all of which are inconsistently reported across the literature. Accordingly, our reviews and analyses of the research surveyed present what we know regarding how cybercriminals conduct transactions in their business models. As well, it identifies what still needs to be investigated to provide a better indication of what should be done to prevent harm and pursue successful criminals in the future.\n\nThe project proceeds with five sections that cover each language. Each language section provides:\n\nan overview of the high-internet-user (>20 million) countries whose governments use the studied language administratively;\n\nan accounting of the research strategy and results; and\n\nan analysis of issues discovered in the literature that have to do with transactions in or affected by cybercriminal ecosystems.\n\nSection I presents the English-language overview. This overview serves as a touchstone for our investigation. It focuses on seven countries: Australia, Canada, India, Nigeria, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America. It presents a synthesis of the academic and grey literature available in English as it pertains primarily, though not exclusively, to the English-speaking world. It provides an overview of financial ecosystems and the properties of various types of currencies, a set of common cybercrime scripts, and a typology of transactions seen in the preparation and commission of cybercrimes. It also discusses the regulatory considerations that have emerged as a result of cybercrime.\n\nSection II presents the Russian-language overview, which focuses on the English and Russophone literature that pertains to the topic of financial transactions in cybercriminal contexts in Russia. It shows that while there is good coverage of Russian issues in the English literature, some concerns expressed in the Russian literature or that impact upon specifically Russia are un- and underreported.\n\nSection III presents the Chinese-language overview, focusing on Taiwan and mainland China. It provides an overview of the bodies that respond to cybercrime in both countries and the appropriate legislation. In addition, it surveys the available literature on transactions vis-Ã -vis cybercrime and IT related crime. It shows that the Chinese-language literature is still limited and that much of what we know vis-Ã -vis cybercrime in Chinese-speaking contexts is reported in the press. There are concerns regarding censorship and its impact in researching and publishing research on cybercrime.\n\nSection IV presents the Spanish-language overview, focusing on Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, and Spain. It shows that the largest Spanish-speaking countries have all developed cybercrime policies designed to improve response capacity and regulation. Almost all behaviours observed in the English literature are also present in Spanish-speaking contexts, indicating that there is no language barrier in terms of accessing materials used to conduct cybercrime or methods of executing various cybercrimes.\n\nSection V presents the French-language overview, focusing on Canada and France. There is little literature written in French vis-Ã -vis cybercrime; accordingly, the report offers a review of the existing literature and suggestions for how future research might proceed in this space.\n\nThis report concludes with a discussion that brings our findings together, showing how research in languages other than English complement and augment the English-language research, where gaps persist, and strategies to better conduct relevant research on the financial dynamics of cybercrime henceforth.\n\nSection I: Lessons from the Anglophone Literature\n\nIntroduction\n\nMost academic and grey literature on cybercrime is produced in English. This report surveys the existing English-language literature that contributes to our understanding of financial processes in, and leveraged by, cybercriminal activities. In completing this task, this report first discusses the methods and databases used to undertake this review and the limitations encountered in assessing some of the high-internet-user, English-speaking countries. Second, it provides an overview of the state of law enforcement and public information vis-Ã -vis cybercrime and financial crime related to cybercrime in the countries of focus. Third, it describes financial ecosystems and their relationships with cyberspace. Fourth, it presents what is known regarding the ecosystems of the crimes considered in this project. Fifth, it outlines the monies to be examined and their properties. Sixth, it presents the key issues that arose in the literature review, including a typology of transactions; claimed methods, tools, and services that facilitate the cashing out and laundering proceeds of cybercrime; and legal and financial regulations regarding these economic activities. Finally, it considers the questions proposed and discusses the limitations of the current English-language literature.\n\nMethods\n\nThis report focuses on English-language sources that are produced around the world. It is presented together with multilingual research undertaken by the team in French, Russian, Chinese, and Spanish over the same topics. Specifically, this report surveys academic and grey literature that examines English-speaking countries with more than 20 million internet users in 2016 (approximations by the International Telecommunications Union (2019)): Australia (21M), Canada (33M), India (390M), Nigeria (48M), the United Kingdom (62M), and the United States (250M).\n\nTo identify recent (2014 through December 2019), relevant peer-reviewed, academic literature, the team devised an array of search terms relevant to the project at hand and engaged in a purposive sampling strategy. The search terms focused on crime types with clear financial elements. Terms included inter alia, ransomware, DDoS attacks, extortion, sales of drugs, weapons and other contraband in illicit marketplaces, fraud, online money laundering, fintech, and various crimeware-as-a-service types. Initially, the research focused on these issues within the geographical context of the United Kingdom. The terms were searched in eleven academic databases, using Boolean search combinations where permitted. The yield was small, with only 24 papers retained as being suitable for our research objectives from an initial screening. The search terms were refined three times in an effort to capture all relevant materials, but the yield did not greatly expand beyond what was initially identified.\n\nThe search was then expanded to include all English-language academic materials and the proceedings from relevant technological conferences (e.g. Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)) and supplemented with searches on specific terms and processes that were uncovered in the coding process. In addition to the scholarly research drawn from academic databases, the team also located whitepapers produced by both governmental and non-governmental organizations over the past 10 years, drawn from clearweb search engines, websites of the bodies that produced the resources, and the EC3 database on cybercrime, to which the research team had access; governmental policy briefs and legislation; and news generated by reputable news providers. The team also reviewed relevant English-language content produced by international bodies, including Europol and FATF-type bodies.\n\nOverview of the literature\n\nThe English-language review focuses primarily, though not exclusively, on anglophone contexts; relevant content that focuses on other reports within this project â notably China and Russia â has been presented with those reports. The searches resulted in 335 English-language articles that were retained. Two analytical foci emerged after coding the retained documents: one examined the processes and attributes of the cybercriminal acts and what is known about the actors behind these acts, and the other examined the financial means which crimes that sought to generate profit used. In both cases, however, authors prioritised the front-end of the crimes, describing how attacks happen, vulnerabilities, and processes in broad terms. There appears to be little research that collects data that would facilitate the description and assessment of cybercrime scripts (Edwards 2016). To that end, there is limited specific information regarding the transactions and transactional methods that cybercriminals engage in after they obtain money as a result of their criminal actions. It is arguable that the academic focus reflects the mainstream policing focus, which is on predicate offenders and their prosecution rather than on the money trail. It also reflects the greater difficulties for observers in obtaining evidence on the money trail.\n\nAccordingly, while authors identified scams, threats and crimes in cyberspace, emerging threats, and law enforcement investigation strategies or capacities, they seldomly provided specific, verifiable primary data. Notably, the grey literature did not provide transparent methodological approaches or data sources. Moreover, when reports provided estimates in terms of prevalence of cybercriminal tools and value loss, these numbers â with a lack of data â appeared to be, at best, educated guesses or, at worst, amplified numbers based on unlikely worst-case scenarios that overstated the plausible dynamics of the market (e.g. by assuming all advertised crimeware-as-a-service would be operationalizable or would operate as claimed). The production of reports by the private sector, governments, and think tanks tends to focus on emerging trends, often provides big-picture analysis, and is haphazard, with many reports or assessments providing one-off snapshots instead of being produced at regular intervals.\n\nThe nature of literature is such that Europolâs Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment (IOCTA), produced annually since 2014, is the only ongoing, publicly-available threat assessment; there are no ongoing, in-depth examinations that document the rapid changes that occur within the cybercriminal ecosystem with a degree of detail that would allow independent researchers to confirm or refute the findings, nor are there comprehensive examinations of the cybercriminal financial strategies. Moreover, there is a certain degree of repetition in both the academic and grey literature, generally. Authors seem compelled to describe actions or artefacts that might have gained attention and were assumed to be unknown to readers; prominent examples from the research surveyed for this report include constant descriptions of how cryptocurrency and the blockchain work and defining new behaviours or criminal strategies.\n\nIn addition, research is geographically limited both in terms of where it is produced and the scope it has. Some governments provided occasional reports to assess issues related to cybercrime, but most did not; some of these reports are unavailable for public consultation. Except for analysis of regulatory frameworks which necessarily focuses on jurisdiction, most cybercrime research does not appear to focus on the geography of crime, except to provide broad claims of where certain actors might be located; this omission may be the result of the borderless nature of cybercrime. There are few notable exceptions where research attempts to explore cybercriminal behaviour âinâ Russia, China, and Nigeria, but even in those cases, analysis is limited, inconsistent, and sometimes superficial.\n\nMoreover, while some reports note that there are an increasing number of victims in emerging economies, there is little exploration of the nature of the crimes or victimisation that impact these economies the most. Emerging economiesâ populations are an increasingly large proportion of internet users. Accordingly, exploring how cybercrime affects these users and how it may emerge in these contexts is critical to understanding future cybercrime trends, including likely domestic political and law enforcement reactions in emerging economies which may clamp down on cybercriminals as a result (unless cybercriminals are state-sponsored or corruptly protected). Such attention is particularly important due to increased interconnectivity between developed and emerging economies, such as through diasporas and foreign direct investment. Crimes that target internet users within emerging economies are likely not only to appeal to cybercriminals but also to have international impact. Yet, many emerging economies lack the local knowledge to develop robust domestic or regional research programmes on cybercrime or cybersecurity. Failing to fill those needs, foreign researchers do not investigate cybercrime in these places in depth, nor do they engage in robust capacity building efforts in these countries.\n\nThe State of Play in Countries of Focus\n\nThis section provides an overview of relevant law enforcement bodies, access to public information, and socio-political considerations that may impact law enforcement activities and the generation of relevant public information in countries that produce government information in English and have internet user bases of more than 20 million people: Australia, Canada, India, Nigeria, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\nIn order to identify potential sources of government generated public information, the research team created an accounting of relevant government bodies in the countries of interest. Generally speaking, each country has at least three core bodies relevant to the themes of cybercrime and illicit or unregulated financial transactions relevant to this report: a general intelligence agency, a cybercrime law enforcement unit, and a financial crimes investigation unit. In some countries, such as the UK, there are a plurality of bodies that have cybercrime, cyber intelligence, and financial crime in their remit, sometimes specializing in specific crimes, such as fraud or tax crimes. Most information relates to cybersecurity strategies, which include how to create better âprotectâ and âpreventâ models, and the front-end of cybercrimes where clear victims can be defined and where the points of contact between cyber offenders and their victims are studied. In general, the publicly available study of intermediary transactions, that involve the transfer of funds after a victim surrenders them, is underdeveloped, as is research related to intermediary parties that facilitate such transactions.\n\nAmong developing countries, the extent to which there is inter-agency cooperation within a country or among international counterparts is often unclear. Developing countries often lack public strategy documents, publicly facing information for the public, or publicly available reports on crime. Accordingly, it appears that public information production is often associated with developed countries that have bodies that demand information for accountability purposes from the government and/or law enforcement, and that have a more visible production of academic publications. Historically, there has been difficulty in developing effective mechanisms for Global South to Global North knowledge flows (Lor and Britz 2005), with researchers from, and research produced, in the Global South often being excluded from knowledge production unintentionally or otherwise (Lo 2011; Cross 2018). This limitation creates difficulties in identifying the nature and extent of cybercrime â both in terms of cybercrime generated and cybercrime experienced â in large internet-using populations in emerging markets, which appear, as is the case globally, to be growing, albeit at potentially a faster percentage rate from a lower base rate (Kshetri 2010, 2015). Moreover, the failure to include this research results in the overlooking of political and cultural considerations that may affect how offenders and victims behave and how authorities, with very different resources and obstacles respond to some cyber-related crimes. Such obstacles may include corruption (Goodman 2011; Lusthaus and Varese 2017), resource limitations (Speer 2000; Kshetri 2017), barriers to relevant and quality education (Catota, Morgan, and Sicker 2019; Irons and Ophoff 2016), a failure to support gender-related (i.e. women and the LGBTQI community) crime (Segrave and Vitis 2017), deficits in the rule of law (Goodman 2011), and kleptocracy (Cooley, Heathershaw, and Sharman 2018).\n\nIn this overview, we have focused on the government resources available in each country. We have drawn attention to memberships and agreements that countries have entered in the international sphere. Where relevant, we have drawn attention to domestic and/or regional political issues that impact capacity development. It is important to note that public-private partnerships are also commonly used to improve capacity. This report notes government use of such partnerships; however, documenting the breadth and characteristics of these partnerships â and their effects â is not possible. Finally, given the attention to cryptocurrency in the literature, we have also reviewed the regulations that pertain to cryptocurrencies for each country surveyed.\n\nAustralia\n\nCybercrime\n\nAustralia appears to be building and maintaining a strong cybersecurity system domestically and regionally, in its sphere of influence, and has been internationally cooperative. Australia has established relevant units throughout its law enforcement mechanisms, acceded to the Council of Europeâs Convention on Cybercrime, known commonly as the Budapest Convention (Maurushat 2010), and signed the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace, an initiative launched by French President Emmanuel Macron at the UNESCO Internet Governance Forum (IGF) that seeks to âestablish international norms for the internet, including good digital hygiene and the coordinated disclosure of technical vulnerabilitiesâ (Matsakis 2018). Moreover, Australiaâs enforcement bodies have participated in multinational investigations (Broadhurst 2017). It appears that Australia is monitoring a wide array of cybercrimes and is developing mechanisms to support domestic victims and to pursue foreign offenders, where plausible. The Australian government appears to engage with emerging and ongoing cybercrime-related issues by providing operational support and drafting legislation that facilitates prosecutorial abilities (Hooper, Martini, and Choo 2013; AUSTRAC 2018c).\n\nWithin its sphere of influence, Australia is positioning itself to be a leader in cybercrime enforcement and cybersecurity not only in terms of developing capacity within its own border but also within the Indo-Pacific region and internationally, e.g. via UNODC. The Australian government recognises that, although the country has a small population, its population makes a good target for cybercriminals since it is relatively wealthy. Moreover, the government appears to be fostering the domestic cybersecurity industry and is developing it in order to help respond to domestic, regional, and international cybercrime issues. The government, when reporting on crime, focuses on points of contact between the offenders and victims. Information, regarding the Australian Governmentâs overarching strategies and outlooks, is easily available, though it is located in several locations, given that several government bodies work on and provide services related to cybersecurity and cybercrime.\n\nThese law enforcement, public service, intelligence, and investigative bodies include:\n\nACORN, the Australian Cybercrime Online Reporting Network. ACORN is a national online system that allows members of the public to report instances of cybercrime. It also has public-facing information written for the public regarding specific types of cybercrime and how to protect against them. ACORN has provided quarterly statistics on major cybercrimes in Australia and has consistently identified scams, fraud, and bogus purchases/sales as accounting for 70% to 75% of reported cybercrimes since it began producing those quarterly statistics in March of 2015 (https://www.acorn.gov.au/resources).\n\nACSC, the Australian Cyber Security Centre. The ACSC is a part of the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), Australiaâs authority for cyber and information security. The ACSC is staffed jointly by ASD and DIO, the Defence Intelligence Organisation. The ACSC also carries out Australiaâs CERT services. The ACSC serves as an operational hub that is designed to facilitate the interaction between government and industry partners and to âfacilitate faster and more effective responses to significant cyber incidentsâ (Australian Cyber Security Centre 2017).\n\nThe ACSC is responsible for the website https://cyber.gov.au, which offers information for various public actors interested in obtaining information regarding cyber threats, advice on cybersecurity, and access to programs related to cybersecurity and ICT products. The ACSC also produces up-to-date reports on best practices, guidance, threats, and significant investigations that the body has undertaken.\n\nACIC, the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission. The ACIC (formerly known as the Australian Crime Commission) is Australiaâs national criminal intelligence agency. It estimates the cost of cybercrime to the Australian economy as $1 billion Australian dollars annually in direct costs alone and states that the principal threats from cybercrime are from overseas actors (Australian Crime Commission 2018).\n\nAFP, the Australian Federal Police. The AFP is the primary policing agency for policing serious and organised crime in Australia. It has Cybercrime Investigation teams that focus on cybercrimes that have ânational significance.â It participates in the Virtual Global Taskforce, an alliance of international law enforcement agencies and private sector partners, that combat child sexual exploitation. State police forces also include specialist units, such as Taskforce Argos of the Queensland Police, that investigate child exploitation material. Taskforce Argos of the Queensland Police was responsible for the takedown of the darkweb child exploitation website, Childs Play (Bleakley 2018). Neither the AFP nor Taskforce Argos produces publicly available reports.\n\nASIO, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. ASIO has a cyber program that focuses on malicious state-sponsored cyber activity and cyber espionage, activities it views as increasing threats to Australia (2018, 2020).\n\nDFAT, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. DFAT has a Cyber Policy Section, which is responsible for building capacity with international partners. It produced Australiaâs International Cyber Engagement Strategy (2017), a document that outlines how Australia views its role in cybersecurity in the international context. It states that the Australian government is working together with regional partners to improve connectivity and resource availability, particularly in countries where infrastructure is lacking. Another key issue involves helping countries in the region develop appropriate legislation and investigation to counter cybercriminal activity. Moreover, Australia is also developing better cybercrime prevention and detection strategies with its regional partners and actively supporting public-private partnerships to help improve awareness and responses (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade 2017).\n\nIn addition to the law enforcement bodies that focus on cybercrime, there is also the Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC), an agency of the Australian Government, which commissions and produces a wide array of crime-related reports, including topics concerning cybercrime. The local academic production is robust, with world-recognised scholars producing both social-science and technical scholarship in departments throughout the country. Furthermore, cybersecurity programs are offered at many universities.\n\nIn reviewing the annual reports and whitepapers published by the above policing bodies, there seems to be a lack of attention to the financial aspects of cybercrime. While ransomware, extortion, theft, fraud, and cryptojacking are ongoing and emerging concerns (Australian Cyber Security Centre 2017; Australian Security Intelligence Organisation 2018, 2020), there is little indication of where the money taken goes and how criminals launder or cash it out. It is possible â given the view that most attacks happen from an overseasâ origin â that there is a lack of domestically-based attackers or illicit merchants (Cunliffe et al. 2017), making it difficult for Australian authorities to pursue cybercrimes back to the offenders and prosecute them unless the offenders have entered and remained within the jurisdiction, and unless the time from offence to pursuit is short.\n\nFinancial Crime\n\nAustralia is a member of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the Asia Pacific Group (APG). Membership indicates that Australia is compliant or largely compliant in these bodiesâ recommendations vis-Ã -vis anti-money laundering and how to combat the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) (FATF 2018c), though there have been serious problems in regulating the legal profession and in the correct reporting of international financial transfers that have led to serious sanctions by AUSTRAC against major banks 2018-20. Cryptocurrencies are legal in Australia, but they are subjected to money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, and tax laws (The Law Library of Congress 2018). Australiaâs principal money laundering intelligence body is:\n\nAUSTRAC, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre. AUSTRAC investigates issues related to money laundering and terror finance, among other financial crimes. AUSTRAC notes that cryptocurrencies are used increasingly more today than before and are in need of regulatory oversight in Australia, but there is no indication of their use in criminal acts in its annual report (AUSTRAC 2018a). Anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws came into force in 2018 to regulate digital currency exchanges operating in Australia (AUSTRAC 2018c). There was no further information available on how cryptocurrencies are used in crime or terror financing. The examples available on AUSTRACâs website of cybercrime focus on frauds that syphon fiat currency away illegally (AUSTRAC 2018b).\n\nAUSTRAC hosted the first ASEAN Codethon (http://www.austrac.gov.au/codeathon) in Sydney, Australia, in 2018. This event invited industry partners to develop strategies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing that happen in cyber contexts. No written reports of the outcomes or tools developed are publicly available.\n\nCryptocurrency Regulation\n\nCryptocurrencies are legal and regulated in Australia; they are subjected to both tax laws and overseen by anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws. Under Australian law, transacting with cryptocurrencies is a bartering arrangement and has similar tax consequences. Cryptocurrencies may be considered assets for capital gains tax purposes. Cryptocurrencies received for goods or services sold must have their value in Australian dollars recorded and are assessed goods and services tax (GST) on that value at the time of the transaction (The Law Library of Congress 2018; Gainsbury and Blaszczynski 2017).\n\nAustraliaâs Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing Act (2018) oversees the digital currency exchange providers, subjecting those providers to AML/CFT regulations (Rueckert 2019; FATF 2018d). These regulations require digital exchange providers to verify a customerâs identity before providing services and assessing the AML/CFT risks in âregards to the type of designated service provided, how the designated service(s) will be delivered, the foreign jurisdictions that will be dealt with, and whether the designated service will be offered by a permanent establishment in a foreign jurisdictionâ (Irwin and Turner 2018, 302).\n\nCanada\n\nCybercrime\n\nAt the start of the 21st century, Canada viewed cyberthreats as being of low risk; however, by 2015, Canada viewed cybercrime as a serious issue on par with terrorism as a national security threat (Moens, Cushing, and Dowd 2015). Canada has invested millions of dollars domestically and is internationally cooperative (Public Safety Canada 2018). Canada is party to the Budapest Convention and has signed the Paris Call. The Canadian government has established a National Cyber Security Strategy, which was last updated in 2018 (Public Safety Canada 2018). Canada treats cyberthreats as multifaceted phenomena that include both cybercrime and other attacks (Adams 2016), and explicitly has interagency efforts in place both domestically and abroad (Deibert 2012). This cooperation provides a wholistic approach in terms of identifying and responding to the entire âscriptâ of a cybercrime, tying criminal activity and its economic implications together.\n\nAs is the case in many other jurisdictions, cybercrimes are persisting and increasing in Canada, with DDoS attacks, ransomware, and socially engineered attacks continuing to impact both individuals and businesses (Canadian Internet Registration Authority 2018; Canadian Centre for Cyber Security 2018). Several cybercrime threats are present in Canada, including organised groups that seek to attack underdefended targets, insiders, individual attackers, and hacktivists (Gallagher, McMahon, and Morrow 2014). In addition, cyber espionage has impacted both the government and business sector (Canadian Centre for Cyber Security 2018). Moreover, the Bank of Canada has increased oversight on the Canadian financial market infrastructure (FMI) in response to the continued high risk of attacks upon it (Gallagher, McMahon, and Morrow 2014).\n\nCanada appears to be monitoring a wide array of cybercrimes and is developing mechanisms to support domestic victims and to pursue foreign offenders, where plausible. The Canadian government engages with emerging and ongoing cybercrime-related issues by passing legislation to support investigative and prosecutorial efforts, providing operational support via cyber.gc.ca, conducting events that target various stakeholders in Canada, partnering with private sector actors, and contributing to the capacity building efforts of other countries (Arnold 2018). Of note are agreements with the United States, such as the 2010 Canada-U.S. Action Plan for Critical Infrastructure and the 2012 Cybersecurity Action Plan Between Public Safety Canada and the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nSeveral government bodies in Canada have cybercrime within their remit, including the Department of Justice, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), Public Safety Canada, and Global Affairs Canada. In addition, there are specific agencies that have specific remits and centres that serve as hubs for the various government actors who collaborate on cybersecurity efforts. These include:\n\nCanadian Centre for Cyber Security (Cyber Centre). The Cyber Centre was established on October 1st, 2018. It serves as a hub where government and private-sector stakeholders can collaborate. The Cyber Centre hosts the National CERT and the Government of Canada CIRT (Computer Incident Response Team) and is responsible for the Get Cyber Safe public awareness campaign. Its website, cyber.gc.ca, provides publicly available information, such as advisories and threat assessments, and tools, such as Assemblyline, a malware detection and analysis tool. The website also has a platform where one can report a large variety of cybercrimes and pursue help in the case of victimization. There is a planned National Cybercrime Coordination Unit to be run by the RCMP, but it has yet to be formed (Public Safety Canada 2018). The RCMP plays a role in national security, generally, and runs specialised teams, like the Critical Infrastructure Intelligence Team.\n\nCSIS, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. The CSIS is Canadaâs primary national intelligence service and is part of Public Safety Canada. It has not produced an annual report since 2016. It has produced a report on cyberthreats on critical infrastructure, which raised concerns over attacks from foreign state (or state-supported) actors (Gendron and Rudner 2012); however, it has not revisited those themes.\n\nIn addition to the government bodies, there is also CIRA, the Canadian Internet Registration Authority, which manages the .CA internet domain. CIRA provides cybersecurity services for .CA domains, namely the D-Zone DNS Firewall and the D-Zone Anycast DNS, paid services available for .CA domain holders.\n\nFinancial Crime\n\nCanada is a member of FATF and APG. The Mutual Evaluation Report indicates that Canada has good anti-money laundering measures in place, though it still remains vulnerable to money laundering through the real estate sector, virtual currencies, and âwhite-labelâ automated teller machines (FATF 2016a). Canadian newspapers have reported that anywhere between 1 to 2 billion Canadian dollars have been laundered through British Columbia, associated with wealthy Chinese peoplesâ dealings in real estate and casinos (Meissner 2019; Cooper 2019). While Canada does not consider virtual currencies as legal tender, it permits their use to buy and sell goods within Canada. In Ontario, 1 in 10 people own or have owned cryptoassets, primarily Bitcoin and Ether (Ontario Securities Commission 2018). Moreover, Canadaâs tax laws apply to virtual currency transactions, with virtual currencies defined as commodities (The Law Library of Congress 2018). Canada has been advanced in developing regulation for fintech, generally, but virtual currency regulation has lagged behind industry innovation (Ducas and Wilner 2017). Nonetheless, Canada does treat virtual currencies as âmoney service businessesâ and includes them in its anti-money laundering regulations (The Law Library of Congress 2018). In June 2019, amendments to the Proceeds of Crime and Terrorist Financing Act required crypto exchanges to register as money servicing businesses (MSBs) (Government of Canada 2019). Canada has several bodies that have within their remit the investigation of financial crime. These include:\n\nCAFC, the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre. CAFC collects information and responds to crimes, such as mass marketing fraud, advance fee fraud, internet fraud, and identification theft. It provides public facing information regarding frauds that frequently impact Canadian citizens. It currently features card-not-present fraud, service scams, extortion scams, and tech support scams as crimes of public interest.\n\nFINTRAC, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada. FINTRAC is Canadaâs financial intelligence unit; it focuses on money laundering and terrorist financing. Its annual report indicates that there has been an increase in virtual currencies used in the commission of various crimes, including drug dealing and terror financing (FINTRAC 2018). FINTRAC cooperates with various law enforcement bodies both domestically and internationally, creating linkages that facilitate the investigation of the financial elements of crime.\n\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police Proceeds of Crime Branch (RCMP Proceeds of Crime Branch). The RCMPâs Proceeds of Crime Branch is responsible for policy development, program planning, program monitoring, and resource allocation in order to separate criminals from the profits of their crimes. Most sections of the Proceeds of Crime Branch are part of the Integrated Proceeds of Crime Initiative that brings together a vast array of investigative parties from various government bodies in order to improve investigative and prosecutorial outcomes.\n\nCRA, the Canada Revenue Agency. The CRA has several compliance programs that respond to suspected cases of tax evasions, fraud, and non-compliance with Canadaâs tax laws by those who earn income from illegal activities.\n\nLocal police force financial crime investigative units. Several local police departments in major metropolitan areas have financial crime investigative units (e.g. Vancouver Police Department; Toronto Police Service) that serve as the first port of call for people living in those cities to file a complaint. They are staffed to conduct investigations and coordinate with other sections within their police departments and with national law enforcement bodies.\n\nCryptocurrency Regulation\n\nCryptocurrencies are legal and regulated in Canada but are explicitly excluded as legal tender. Cryptocurrencies are considered commodities by Canadian laws, which means that the value in fiat currency of the goods sold in a transaction must be reported by the seller for income tax purposes and then is taxed accordingly (Canada Revenue Agency 2019).\n\nCanada also subjects cryptocurrencies to its AML/CFT laws. Canadaâs Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act views currency exchanges as money service businesses and regulates them thusly. In addition, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) views initial coin offerings (ICOs), initial token offerings (ITOs), cryptocurrency investment funds, and the cryptocurrency exchanges trading these products as being under the purview of Canadian securities law and regulation (The Law Library of Congress 2018), thereby obligating exchanges to employ know-your-customer (KYC) protocols (Rueckert 2019).\n\nIndia\n\nCybercrime\n\nIndia, with its 390 million internet users, has the second most users in the world after China. It has a low internet penetration rate, though that has been slowly increasing. As internet access and speeds increase, the presence of cybercrime emanating from and cyber victimization within the country are likely to increase (Irons and Ophoff 2016). India and the other BRICS economies â Brazil, Russia, China, and South Africa â âhave been concerned about the Westâs cyberspace dominance and are seeking to change the status quo by engaging in and fostering new international alliancesâ (Kshetri 2015, 245); none has signed the Paris Call. Since 2013, India has been trying to digitise several services (Kshetri 2016), and the government has attempted to demonetise by withdrawing cash from the economy (Garg and Panchal 2016). Indiaâs internet users have the potential to engage in over $50 billion USD in online transactions annually (Sheth et al. 2018). India is a prolific producer of software engineers (Iqbal and Beigh 2017); it is projected to have the most software engineers of any country by 2023 (Rana 2018). However, the quality of IT professionals in India varies greatly and many are unemployed or in jobs that are not related to their field of study (The Economic Times 2018). Cybersecurity as an academic major is not commonly offered in India and information regarding relevant study opportunities is limited.\n\nDespite having a large market, there is little research and public information regarding cybercrime trends in India. The number of new users, many of whom do not engage in good cyber security practices, and the use of low-cost and insecure technologies make India susceptible to cybercrime (Kshetri 2017). Data on reported cybercrimes are available via the National Crime Records Bureau (2017) crime statistics. Those statistics show that total cybercrimes increased steadily from 2014 to 2016. The 2016 statistics show that 48.6% of cybercrime cases in India were for âillegal gain,â 8.6% were motivated by revenge, and 5.6% were related to insulting the modesty of women (National Crime Records Bureau 2017). Illegal gain includes crimes such as cyber fraud and forgery (Kandpal and Singh 2013), though what other actions it might include is unclear. Research suggests that the majority of victims of cybercrimes in India are women (Halder and Jaishankar 2016). Estimates of victims of cybercrimes in India indicate that 41 million Indians fell victim in 2011 (Kshetri 2017); however, reported and registered cybercrimes are certainly a small proportion of all cybercrimes that are committed in India (Kshetri 2016). Indian businesses are starting to invest more in cybersecurity measures, amid reports of corporate espionage, ransomware, phishing, and other targeted attacks (KPMG 2017).\n\nIndia also has a history of generating cybercrime outward to the international market. Spam, fraud, phishing, and crimes with a degree of social engineering, are common (Kshetri 2017, 2015).\n\nIndia is not party to the Budapest Convention, and, despite having promulgated the Information Technology Act in 2000 and updating it in 2008 (Kshetri 2015), India appears to lack robust and up-to-date regulation to meet the changing demands of online activities and to confront the wide array of frauds that have occurred in India (Nappinai 2010; Umarhathab, Rao, and Jaishankar 2009). Information regarding the degree to which India coordinates with other countries in cybersecurity and cybercrime enforcement is limited. There is some indication that India is using public-private partnerships to improve its capacity (Godse 2016); however, those partnerships are not necessarily valued by government officials (Kshetri 2016). None of the bodies charged with investigating or policing cybercrime produces publicly available reports of any kind. Those groups include:\n\nMHA, the Ministry of Home Affairs. The MHA has a public facing portal (cybercrime.gov.in) to allow the public to report cybercrimes. It caters specifically to âcomplaints pertaining to online Child Pornography (CP)/ Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) or sexually explicit content such as Rape/Gang Rape (CP/RGR) contentâ (Ministry of Home Affairs 2019). The MHA also has a Cyber and Information Security (C&IS) Division that is tasked with various coordination efforts among law enforcement agencies and with engaging in law enforcement activity responding to cybercrime.\n\nNCSSS, the National Cyber Safety and Security Standards. The NCSSS is tasked with protecting India against foreign cyberattacks by developing protective technologies, conducting threat assessments, and analysing government, military, and civilian computer networks.\n\nNIC-CERT, the National Informatics Centre - Computer Emergency Response Team. NIC-CERT monitors and responds to cyberthreats to critical government infrastructure. It has a reporting phone number and email. It also publishes advisories and policy guidelines. It is reported that NIC-CERT also runs the National Cyber Coordination Centre (NCCC), an e-surveillance agency (The Economic Times 2017). The NCCC, however, is not mentioned on any government website nor does it have its own website.\n\nDEITY, the Department of Electronics and Information Technology is a branch of the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology. It funds projects to be undertaken by academia. A list of the projects is available, but none of the reports is public.\n\nThere are also Cybercrime Cells situated in police departments of most major cities in India and these are tasked to investigate a broad array of cases (Kandpal and Singh 2013).\n\nFinancial Crime\n\nIndia is a member of FATF, APG, and the Eurasian Group (EAG). As is the case with information regarding cybercrime, the government does not produce much publicly available information on money laundering. In 2013, India demonstrated that it was complying well enough with the FATF recommendations to be removed from the annual monitoring process (FATF 2018a); it has remained out of monitoring since then. Nonetheless, India remains a financial hub for the sub-continent (Narayan 2018). Historically, it has experienced large volumes of transactions from remittances that are often remitted using the hawala system (Shehu 2004), though these may be challenged with demonetization (Shirley 2017). However, India has not become a cashless society; two years after demonetization, cash use rebounded to pre-demonetization levels (Dubey 2018). India continues to promote cashless payment solutions, so monitoring the vulnerabilities such systems present is important.\n\nIndia does not recognise cryptocurrencies as legal tender and does not have a regulatory framework for them (The Law Library of Congress 2018). Indian lawmakers have drafted a bill entitled âBanning of Cryptocurrencies and Regulation of Official Digital Currencies Bill 2019,â published on July 23rd, 2019. From June of 2018, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) stopped financial institutions from providing services to people or businesses that deal in virtual currencies (Reserve Bank of India 2018). India has suggested that it may develop a Rupee-backed cryptocurrency; however, that project is on hold (Department of Economic Affairs: Ministry of Finance 2019).\n\nIndia has the following law enforcement bodies tasked with investigating financial crimes:\n\nFIU-IND, the Financial Intelligence Unit India. The FIU-IND is part of the Ministry of Finance. Its mission is to combat and deter money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Its annual report states that the FIU-IND has worked with foreign counterparts in these matters and has vastly improved capacity (Financial Intelligence Unit-India 2018). There is, however, little indication of the volume of money laundering in India.\n\nDirectorate General of Income Tax (Intelligence & Criminal Investigation) investigates cases of tax evasion. It does not publish any publicly available materials.\n\nCryptocurrency Regulation\n\nThough India has been attempting to increase its virtual footprint and capacity, it has sought to maintain control over currency by restricting transactions to fiat currency (KPMG 2017). While the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has approved the use of mobile payment systems, allowing them to exist under the regulation of existing AML/CTF regulation (Reaves et al. 2017), the RBI issued a April 2018 notification that prohibited banks, lenders, and other regulated financial institutions from using virtual currencies (Reserve Bank of India 2018). This prohibition has resulted in a sharp decline in the use of virtual currencies in India. Nonetheless, some companies have challenged the RBIâs directive, and the case is being heard presently in the Indian Supreme Court.\n\nNigeria\n\nCybercrime\n\nNigeria is a country associated with high rates of cybercrime origin. European Union law enforcement views Nigeria as a top-10 country in terms of the location of offenders or infrastructure related to cybercrime (Europol 2015); Symantec views it as the fourth largest producer of cyberattacks in Africa after South Africa, Egypt, and Kenya (Symantec 2016). Nigerian cyber offenders particularly perpetrate various types of fraud (INTERPOL 2018h). As an emerging economy, there are several elements that appear to contribute to Nigeriaâs fertility as a location from which cybercrime can occur, including unemployment, cross-border mobility with neighbours, and novice users who do not use basic cyber-wellbeing precautions.\n\nNigeria experiences an ongoing problem with unemployment (Akanle, Adesina, and Akarah 2016). National unemployment at the close of 2018 was over 23%, a figure that has been steadily high or increasing for at least four years; youth unemployment is higher, with estimates placing it over 30% overall and up to 58% among young women and young people in rural settings (Akande 2014; National Bureau of Statistics 2018). The lack of licit employment opportunities has led to the development of the âyahoo-yahooâ or âyahoo boysâ phenomenon. Yahoo boys are typically students in tertiary education who engage in cybercrimes that use social engineering in order to scam victims from overseas (Okeshola and Adeta 2013; Tade 2013). Some of them may also use elements of voodoo as part of their crime ritual (Whitty and Ng 2017; Tade 2013). Notably, these offenders may be part of the Nigerian diaspora, operating in locations outside Nigeria (Kshetri 2016; Whitty and Ng 2017).\n\nINTERPOL indicates that Nigeria is a hub to a broad array of socially engineered frauds and scams (INTERPOL 2018h), with the âbusiness email compromiseâ scam, whereby scammers spoof high-ranking company officials (Symantec 2016). These frauds generally involve offenders manipulating their victims to transfer fiat currency using remittance systems commonly used by the diaspora to remit money back to Africa (INTERPOL 2018c; Aransiola and Asindemade 2011; Chawki 2009). Changes in banking and transacting in West Africa generally have made tracing financial cross-border transactions more difficult (INTERPOL 2018h). Moreover, the transition to cashless payment systems failed to provide adequate consumer protections; users were victimised by scammers engineering frauds with the new technology and by scammers engaging in fraudulent ATM withdrawals since cashless payment became a widespread option in 2014 (Ukpong and Uke 2016; Tade and Adeniyi 2016, 2017).\n\nVictimization from malware is also common in Nigeria where more than one in seven mobile devices are infected with mobile malware (Symantec 2016). However, there is no clear indication that Nigerian cybercriminals engage in ransomware/extortion activities that would yield cryptocurrency payments. Cryptocurrencies remain legal in Nigeria and several exchanges trade in various cryptocurrencies. Nonetheless, the Central Bank of Nigeria has prohibited banks from transacting in cryptocurrencies, declaring that they are not legal tender (Central Bank of Nigeria 2018), but that regulation does not prohibit the operation of cryptobusinesses, like cryptocurrency exchanges, from operating or banks and financial institutions from investing in them. The Central Bank of Nigeria appears to be developing regulatory policy for fintech companies (Kazeem 2018), though it has stated that, like the internet, cryptocurrency use cannot be banned outright (Chohan 2017).\n\nNigeria recognises the role its cybercriminals play internationally. It is an observer to the Budapest Convention, but did not sign the Paris Call. Nigeria has also passed anti-cybercrime legislation, the Cybercrime Act, 2015 (Mohammed, Mohammed, and Solanke 2019). However, Nigeria appears to be severely under-resourced in terms of being able to cope with cybercrime and financial crime investigations (INTERPOL 2018h; Omodunbi et al. 2016), making it fertile ground for offenders and a place where the increasingly online population may find itself at risk of being victimised from domestic or regional offenders.\n\nInformation on Nigerian law enforcement is limited from the country itself. For instance, Nigeria has a National Intelligence Agency, but the organization does not have a working website. Nigeria does have cybersecurity policy and strategy â the National Cyber Security Policy and National Cyber Security Strategy â established in May 2015 (Symantec 2016). Nigeria also has dedicated organizations for cybercrime which include:\n\nngCERT, The Nigeria Computer Emergence Response Team. ngCERTâs website provides basic information to the public and serves as a portal for reporting cybercrime incidents. The website states that its three principal services are to monitor new technical developments in IT, specifically as they relate to intruder activities; to provide intrusion detection services to information systems that are part of the Nigerian Governmentâs Critical National Information Infrastructure; and to engage in vulnerability assessment and penetration testing to private and public entities that are part of the Critical National Information Infrastructure. ngCERT does not produce publicly available whitepapers or reports that provide details regarding the rates of complaints it receives or any further information regarding cybercrime in Nigeria.\n\nIn addition, Nigeria had established the Nigerian Cybercrime Working Group (NCWG) with a public outreach mission (Chawki 2009); no website exists for it anymore.\n\nNigeria has also cooperated with regional and private partners to investigate cybercrime that goes through the country, such as botnet attacks which take control of computers, and to build local capacity (Symantec 2016). There is no indication of the extent to which Nigeria has local training to develop personnel to respond to cybercrime and cyberthreats either through ad hoc education or through trade schools or universities.\n\nFinancial Crime\n\nNigeria emerged from the FATF monitoring process in 2013, indicating that it had improved its AML/CFT regime (FATF 2013). Nigeria is not a member of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) â South Africa is the only African country that is - but it is a member of GIABA, the Intergovernmental Action Group against Money Laundering in West Africa. The last mutual evaluation report by GIABA on Nigeria is from 2015. It notes that the EFCC is active in investigating and prosecuting local crimes and interfacing with regional counterparts. The report further states that Nigeria is still non-compliant or partially compliant with several AML/CFT policies, including freezing, seizing, and confiscating proceeds of crime (GIABA 2015). The body tasked with investigating is:\n\nEFCC, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. The EFCC was founded in 2004 as an anti-corruption agency but also had within its remit the tasks of âpreventing, investigating, prosecuting, and penalizing financial and economic crimes such as illegal oil bunkering, terrorism, capital market fraud, cybercrime, advance fee fraud (419 or obtaining through different fraudulent schemes), banking fraud and economic governance fraud (transparence (sic) and accountability)â (Obuah 2010). In 2005, the EFCC established the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit to collect suspicious transactions reports. Annual reports and further information are not available, but the EFCC does publicise its successful law enforcement activities. Relationships between the EFCC and the government are often tense because some investigations and non-investigations relate to high level governmental corruption. Economic crimes that are independent of elite government-military networks are more freely investigable, but still demand their âproper shareâ of scarce resources. African scholars suggest that the EFCC remains under-resourced and local confidence in its efficacy appears to be limited (Suleiman, Othman, and Ahmi 2017; Uthman et al. 2015). Interviews with officials (personal communication) suggest that the EFCC does investigate 419 fraud gangs who use electronic communications and receive wire transfers as well as cash as part of their operations.\n\nCryptocurrency Regulation\n\nThough Nigeria has one of the highest rates of cryptocurrency usage in Africa, it is not the topic of much outside inquiry. Cryptocurrency can be traded in Nigeria, but the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) states that cryptocurrencies are not legal tender and that virtual currency exchangers (VCEs) are not licensed or regulated by the CBN. However, cryptocurrencies are not barred; rather, Nigeriaâs Securities and Exchange Commission states that those who trade in cryptocurrency must do so at their own risk (Oyebayo and Shittu 2018). Nonetheless, the CBN requires Nigerian financial institutions that engage with VCEs to ensure that the VCEs comply with the Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) Regulations, 2013, and The Nigerian Cyber Crime (Prohibition, Prevention) Act, 2015. These regulations and statutes require Nigerian financial institutions to follow KYC protocols and report suspicious transactions to the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) (Oyebayo and Shittu 2018; Sanni 2019).\n\nSouth Africa\n\nCybercrime\n\nSouth Africa, despite an internet penetration rate of only about 53% (Symantec 2016), was the top source of cyberattacks on the African continent, accounting for 25% of all attacks (Symantec 2016). It was the top source for malware, spam, and phishing hosts; fourth for botnets; and second for hosting C&C (command and control) servers. It also ranks high in terms of victims, ranking third in the world, behind China and Russia, in 2013 (Kshetri 2015), resulting in losses of over $300,000,000 USD annually (Irons and Ophoff 2016). In addition, some cybercrime may be targeted for political purposes (Van Niekerk 2017). These high rates in terms of Africa could be attributed, at least in part, to the early access South Africa has had to broadband connections relative to the rest of the continent and to an overall lack of security awareness (Irons and Ophoff 2016; Bada, Von Solms, and Agrafiotis 2018). Its relative wealth also has been a magnet for Africans from other countries, including Nigerians.\n\nCollecting up-to-date information on South Africa and cybercrime victimization within it or cybercrime offending emanating from it is variable. Within South Africa, there are no public-facing, accessible reports produced by organizations in the country. Most information related to South Africaâs levels of cybercrime offending and victimization is produced by consultancies working on the topic or by foreign government reports. Consultancy reports tend to focus on issues that these consultancies view as directly relevant to their customer base. Foreign government reports have proved to be irregular. Notably, there are problems in terms of data collection and enforcement capacity in South Africa. Victims of cybercrimes often fail to report crimes since they fail to recognise that they are being victimised; plus, mandatory reporting is not obligated (Van Niekerk 2017). Additionally, poor operational procedures and reporting protocols within businesses are common (Bougaardt and Kyobe 2011). Enforcement lacks sufficient capacity to respond to known threats and to investigate crimes effectively and consistently; nonetheless, South Africa has assisted with mutual legal assistance requests (Symantec 2016; Irons and Ophoff 2016).\n\nINTERPOL recognises that cybercrime assists with an array of other crimes that are common in southern Africa. Technology can facilitate investment and innovation by providing facilities illicit entrepreneurs can use to transfer money, produce counterfeit documents, and communicate across borders and illicit markets (INTERPOL 2018g). Interpol indicates that cybercrimes in southern Africa, therefore, have a degree of sophistication that is less prevalent elsewhere in the continent. Moreover, banks and payment systems are common targets (Bougaardt and Kyobe 2011; Mbelli and Dwolatzky 2016).\n\nSouth Africa is an observer to the Budapest Convention, but did not sign the Paris Call, and has passed some domestic legislation to combat cybercrime. However, as is the case for many African countries, there is a gap between the laws on the books and the ability for law enforcement organizations to enforce them (Kshetri 2013). Moreover, few South African universities offer coverage of cybersecurity issues; none offers a comprehensive program of study in cybersecurity (Irons and Ophoff 2016). Unlike other African countries, South Africa does regulate cryptocurrency, namely through its tax laws which state that individuals must declare cryptocurrency holdings and gains to the South African Revenue Services (SARS) (The Law Library of Congress 2018).\n\nSouth Africa has several policies and pieces of legislation that focus on cybersecurity (Sutherland 2017). The cornerstone of these policies is the National Cybersecurity Policy Framework (NCPF), passed in 2012 (Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services 2017). In concert, these polices have established or empowered existing bodies to counter cybercrime. Sutherland (2017) provides a chart that shows the relationships between policy departments and agencies. However, the majority of these organizations do not have public facing websites with publicly available information. The following are the organizations that have public facing information:\n\nCSIRT, Computer Security Incident Response Team. The CSIRT is located under the State Security Agency (SSA). It provides ICT and cybersecurity services to the government. It publishes an irregular newsletter, daily ICT information security reports, and security advisories that are publicly available.\n\nCSIRTs, Computer Security Incident Response Teams. In addition to the South African National CSIRT, there are various CSIRTs throughout South Africa. CSIRTs are part of the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services (DTPS). They have a remit to help protect South African citizens and businesses online. The National CSIRT maintains the National Cybersecurity Hub, which serves as a central point of collaboration between the government and non-governmental partners. The National Cybersecurity Hub has an email where one can report cybersecurity incidents, including phishing, malware, and ITC vulnerabilities.\n\nThe National CSIRT has produced a document entitled âA Baseline Study on Cybersecurity Readinessâ (Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services 2017). The document reports on readiness as it relates to South African businesses. It states that there are insufficient in-house skills and awareness, and development in these two areas. It also notes that ransomware and malicious emails, and socially engineered attacks remain a significant concern in terms of external threats. However, the report notes that internal threats pose a bigger risk.\n\nThe DTPS also has established a National Cyber Security Advisory Council; however, little information is available regarding it.\n\nSAPS (South African Police Service) Electronic Crime Unit. The SAPS Electronic Crime Unit runs cybercrime.org.za which is a portal for resources on cybercrime, such as relevant laws and policies, security tips, and a public portal to report cybercrimes. Reports have indicated that SAPS Electronic Crime Unit is under-resourced, with preventable issues, such as expired software licenses, impeding its ability to function (Sicetsha 2018).\n\nFinancial Crime\n\nSouth Africa has an extremely high rate of financial crime, with 77% of South African organizations having experienced economic crime in some form (PwC 2018b). Fraud, tax crimes, misappropriation crimes, and money laundering appear to have risen recently or remain prevalent in South Africa (PwC 2018b; Financial Intelligence Centre 2018a). Financial crime is associated as an element of other types of serious and organised crime in Southern Africa, generally; criminal organizations exploit the âcontrast between informal economies and sophisticated and developed complex financial infrastructure spread throughout the regionâ (INTERPOL 2018g). Overall, financial crime costs the region billions of dollars and stunts its ability to develop and grow (INTERPOL 2018g; PwC 2018b).\n\nThese high rates and ongoing phenomena are despite the presence of legislation that seeks to combat financial crime (de Koker 2007, 2003; Financial Intelligence Centre 2018a) and membership to FATF and the Eastern and Southern Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group (ESAAMLG), indicating a lack of capacity which is common throughout the region (INTERPOL 2018g). Nevertheless, the most recent mutual evaluation review of South Africa by FATF/ESAAMLG states that South Africa has made progress in terms of complying with the regulatory suggestions (ESAAMLG 2018). The organization tasked with combatting financial crime in South Africa is:\n\nFIC, the Financial Intelligence Centre. The FIC was established in 2003 with a remit to gather and analyse financial data (Financial Intelligence Centre 2018c). It currently works on financial crime broadly and engages in anti-money laundering and anti-terror financing efforts (Financial Intelligence Centre 2018a). In addition to annual reports, the FIC publishes regular updates on scam types, illustrating common scams that impact South Africa.\n\nRecent publications have highlighted fraud related to cryptocurrencies and other virtual assets, credential theft, bank fraud, socially engineered frauds, and unauthorised use of third-party accounts (Financial Intelligence Centre 2018c, 2018b). Overall, the FIC demonstrates an awareness of the nexus between cybercrime and financial crime and appears to be moving towards developing policy and producing information that address this specific issue (Financial Intelligence Centre 2018a).\n\nCryptocurrency Regulation\n\nCryptocurrency is largely unregulated in South Africa. Upon review, the South African Reserve Bank determined that virtual currencies, including cryptocurrencies and digital currencies traded within video games, are not legal tender; nonetheless, cryptocurrencies are subject to taxation upon their transaction (South African Reserve Bank 2014; The Law Library of Congress 2018). South Africa also requires financial virtual exchanges to report suspicious activity (FATF 2018d).\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nCybercrime\n\nThe United Kingdom is one of the most-often-targeted countries by cybercriminals, with offenders being of both a domestic and an international provenance (Saunders 2017, NCA 2020). Cybercrime is a most common type of crime experienced in the United Kingdom, with 1 in 12 reported crimes relating to computer misuse (Crime in England and Wales: Additional Tables on Fraud and Cybercrime 2020; Budd 2016). It is in the top 10 of countries where ransomware is most prevalent (Symantec 2017). In 2018, victims of cybercrime in the United Kingdom lost more than Â£190,000 daily (Lee 2019); in 2020, cybercrime increased 5% from 2019 (ONS 2020).\n\nDomestically, the United Kingdomâs organization of law enforcement has grown historically but not always tightly or coherently; this is also true in terms of law enforcement and cybercrime investigations, regularly criticised in HMICFRS reports. That being said, the UK Government (2016) published its National Cyber Security Strategy 2016-2021. This report highlights the ongoing threats domestically and abroad and outlines the government strategy to âdefend, deter, and develop,â punctuated by a Â£1.9-billion investment in cybersecurity (HM Government 2016). Security strategies propose (and have precipitated in) the development of public-private partnerships to improve capacity (Saunders 2017; Budd 2016). Domestic organizations that focus on cybercrime are:\n\nNCA, the National Crime Agency. The NCA is responsible for tackling the most serious international organised crime and for cyber dependent (but not cyber-enabled) crime, including child sexual exploitation, money laundering and illicit finance, data breaches, ransomware attacks, and distributed denial of service attacks. The associated regional organised crime units (ROCUs) are semi-independent and sometimes conduct specialist surveillance and cybercrime investigations, some of which have involved cryptocurrencies.\n\nGCHQ, the Government Communications Headquarters. GCHQ is the United Kingdomâs signals intelligence branch. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is part of GCHQ and the UKâs lead technical authority on cyber security. It offers real-time threat analysis, defence against national cyber attacks and tailored advice to small and medium enterprises, large organisations, the public sector and the general public on improving cyber resilience and responding to incidents. It works collaboratively with law enforcement, defence partners, the UKâs intelligence and security agencies and international allies. The NCSC also provides certification to cyber security products, services and organisations, and relevant training and degree programmes.\n\nAdditionally, GCHQ has a private-public partnership with the P20 Collaborative (https://payments20.com/) an organization that represents corporations wishing to promote collaboration on a variety of topics, such as financial inclusion, technology and platform development, as well as cybersecurity. P20âs cybersecurity working group produces research and recommendations on the mitigation of cyber risk. In addition to its relationship with GCHQ, P20 has ongoing dialogue with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice.\n\nInternationally, the United Kingdom is a party to the Budapest Convention and has signed the Paris Call. As a member of the European Union, it has contributed to investigations and to the work of the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), whose role has been upgraded in recent years to reflect the ascent of the issues within the EUâs crime and enterprise portfolios. However, post-Brexit there is a likelihood of increased risk to the United Kingdom, as its agencies will no longer enjoy the same degree of support from partnering institutions in the European Union, foreign talent may leave, and the general capacity lull will be a scenario that attackers will seek to target. Likewise, the capacity of Europol and EU Member States will be diminished.\n\nFinancial Crime\n\nFinancial crime comprises two interconnected but connected strands: fraud and money laundering. Much fraud is laundered (in the formal sense), but money laundering applies to the proceeds of all domestic and overseas crimes. The United Kingdom is not only the largest financial service provider in the world but also possesses the highest rating of any FATF-assessed country in the latest round of assessments (FATF 2018b). It is, likewise, home to the largest centre for financial payments: $9 trillion USD in financial payments pass through Londonâs 210 FinTech companies. In the UK, 50% of corporate respondents reported experiencing economic crime in the past 24 months, a figure which is comparable to the global average of 49% (PwC 2018a). Fraud accounts for about a third of all crime reported and that money laundering may exceed Â£90 billion a year, though those estimates are often contested (HO News Team 2017; Moiseienko and Keatinge 2019). The financial sector reports a prevalence of several cyber-enabled frauds, including identity fraud/theft, phishing, unauthorised access, and malware-enabled fraud (Financial Conduct Authority 2018; PwC 2018a).\n\nCryptocurrencies are legal in the United Kingdom. In the past, the government position has been that the size of the market is too small to regulate, but the Bank of England has called for regulation (The Law Library of Congress 2018). There are some self-regulating bodies in the crypto-asset industry, such as Crypto UK, and by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the UKâs financial services regulator (House of Commons Treasury Committee 2018). In 2020, FCA called for businesses carrying on cryptoasset activity in the UK to come into compliance with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017, as amended in 2019 (MLRs) and to register with the FCA (Levi and Gelemerova, 2020).\n\nThe United Kingdom is a member of FATF and the latest mutual evaluation report notes that it has a robust understanding of money laundering and terror financing risks and has a good record for prosecuting high-end money laundering cases and cooperating with foreign counterparts (FATF 2018b). Although FATF notes that the UK generally has good information for investigative purposes, it recommends âan overhaul to improve the quality of financial intelligence available to the competent authoritiesâ (FATF 2018b, 4), which has begun. Principal domestic bodies concerned with financial crime include:\n\nSFO, the Serious Fraud Office. The SFO is responsible for some of the most serious economic crimes, including transnational bribery, but (per researcher interviews) the SFO rarely detects cryptocurrencies in its investigations. This is understandable because the businesses investigated are mostly businesses trading licitly or apparently licitly, so those businesses would normally use financial transactions appropriate to their kind of business. There is little evidence of crypto currencies being involved in transnational bribery, though such evidence may take time to emerge in enquiries that are generally of long duration. One recent study of kleptocratic behaviour (Sharman 2017) makes no mention of crypto currencies.\n\nCity of London Police, Economic Crime Department. The City of London police economic crime department is the official lead agency for economic crimes in England and Wales, including cyber enabled economic crimes. It does sometimes deal with cases involving cryptocurrencies.\n\nUK Financial Intelligence Unit. The UK Financial Intelligence Unit is part of the NCA. It is the body responsible for processing Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs), investigating them, or passing on the SARs to appropriate bodies.\n\nAction Fraud and the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau. Action Fraud and the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau are the bodies to which frauds are reported centrally and which process these reports before passing them on. There are no reports which specifically mention cryptocurrencies, but frauds involving exchanges may be investigat"
