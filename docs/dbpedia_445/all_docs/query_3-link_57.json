Yet, much remains the same at the high-powered Democratic media and political consulting firm, which produced over 600 ads this past campaign cycle and notched a number of victories all across the country, including the reelection of Reps. Joe Morelle and Brian Higgins in New York. The team also promoted Loren Riegelhaupt as a principal; Mike Czin, Kendra Barkoff Lamy and Devon Puglia to be managing directors; and Alex Bloom, Stephanie Reichin and Liz Kenigsberg as executive vice presidents. In addition to Shorenstein, the firm also brought on Aoife McCarthy, Sarah Lyons, Mariel Sáez and Justin Goodman.\n\n2.

His public relations firm boasts over 400 clients, including a long list of well-known businesses, nonprofit organizations and cultural attractions ranging from the Museum of Modern Art and “Saturday Night Live” to The Durst Organization, the Hospital for Special Surgery and Uber. The firm supported the launch of new initiatives in 2022, such as the opening of the Museum of Broadway, and helped clients navigate critical challenges, including working with the Center for Reproductive Rights in its planning and response to the leaked U.S. Supreme Court opinion overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\n3. Global Strategy Group\n\nJon Silvan, Founding Partner and CEO; Justin Lapatine, Partner\n\nNotable clients: New York Safety Net Hospital Coalition, RXR, MGM Resorts, New York Health Foundation, Pratt & Whitney\n\nGlobal Strategy Group boasts a mix of skilled communicators with a wealth of experience in public affairs and corporate reputation. With revenues rising, the firm has gone from 95 employees at the end of 2020 to more than 150 today. In April, the firm announced a partnership with SEC Newgate, an international strategic communications company headquartered in Milan, Italy. In addition to its work with health care institutions like Maimonides Medical Center and New York Health Foundation, and corporate clients like MGM Resorts and RXR Realty, GSG handled polling for several Democratic winners, including Gov. Kathy Hochul and Reps. Pat Ryan, Jerry Nadler and Joe Morelle. The firm also launched THE L@B, an in-house creative team offering creative direction, full-service video and content production, digital media strategies and planning and buying capabilities.\n\n4. Pythia Public\n\nEvan Thies & Alexis Grenell, Co-Founders\n\nOther key employees: Becky Stern, Ben Branham\n\nNotable clients: New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Safe Horizon, Common Cause New York, Earthjustice, Related Cos.\n\nPythia Public doesn’t have hundreds of staffers like some communications agencies, but it did help get New York City Mayor Eric Adams elected. The firm went on to advise the Adams administration’s transition team and played a role in the city’s new plan for a 25,000-seat soccer stadium at Willets Point alongside a massive entirely affordable housing development. In Albany, the firm helped pass the Adult Survivors Act and a first-in-the-nation moratorium on crypto mining. Pythia welcomed former Port Authority Chief Communications Officer Ben Branham as chief operating officer and managing director, former state Sen. Alessandra Biaggi chief of staff Ana Hall as director and Claire Wixted from former Assembly Member Sandy Galef’s office as an associate.

Pat Ryan, state Sens. Michelle Hinchey and Sean Ryan\n\nBerlinRosen is one of the biggest PR firms in New York politics, and unlike some competitors, communications and marketing is the primary focus. That said, it handles PR for many different types of clients, including nonprofits, cultural institutions, real estate developers – and, of course, candidates for elected office. While longtime client Bill de Blasio has apparently left electoral politics, the national firm notched big wins in its home state with New York City Comptroller Brad Lander and Reps. Pat Ryan and Dan Goldman. The firm saw campaigns leader Alex Navarro-McKay depart at the end of the year, with Isaac Goldberg moving up to take his place. Rick Fromberg also joined BerlinRosen from The Win Company as a senior adviser for public affairs and campaigns working across politics, advocacy and government.\n\n6.

Among the issues the firm is tackling is the Medicaid reimbursement rate in New York that several safety net hospitals say is jeopardizing their financial health. Kwatra, who is known for taking on some of the toughest issue campaigns, has also helped Ørsted become a literal power player in New York’s burgeoning offshore wind industry.\n\n7. Risa Heller Communications\n\nJames Yolles, Managing Director; Linden Zakula, Managing Director; Gwen Rocco, Managing Director; Carly Holden, Senior Vice President\n\nNotable clients: Airbnb, DoorDash, Jeff Zucker, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, The Howard Hughes Corp.\n\nRisa Heller, a former communications director for U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, has made her firm a fixture since its launch 13 years ago. In 2022, her firm advised private equity firm Marblegate, announcing that its public-private partnership with the Adams administration, Schumer and the New York Taxi Workers Alliance delivered more than $225 million in debt relief for taxi drivers. It helped secure approval for the Champlain Hudson Power Express – a clean energy infrastructure project that will supply 20% of New York City’s power – which recently broke ground with Gov. Kathy Hochul. The firm also advised Westchester Medical Center Health Network as it expanded its services. And James Yolles’ team worked with the Real Estate Board of New York on a media campaign around housing issues and announced two green-building milestones: New York City’s first net-zero community, for L+M Development Partners, and Alloy Development’s plans to fully power the city’s first all-electric skyscraper with local renewable energy. Newcomers to the firm include Gwen Rocco, Carly Holden and Vincent Novicki.\n\n8. Marino\n\nFrank Marino, CEO; John Marino, President\n\nOther key employees: Tom Corsillo, Sam Goldstein, Lee Silberstein\n\nNotable clients: McDonald’s, NYC Hospitality Alliance, Innovation QNS, American Chemistry Council\n\nAs Marino marks its 30th anniversary this year, the agency’s public affairs team celebrated several rezoning victories. In November, the New York City Council zoning subcommittee voted to approve Innovation QNS, the largest private affordable housing development in Queens history. The $2 billion investment will create over 3,000 homes in Astoria, with more than 1,400 of them affordable. The vote came just weeks after the City Council approved two other major rezonings: one in Throggs Neck that will add hundreds of new homes to an East Bronx neighborhood that has created very few in the past two decades and another in Astoria that will create 1,400 homes on Astoria’s Hallets Cove peninsula. Marino led communications for all three projects – a significant milestone for the agency as the first time in its three decades of land use experience that it won three such approvals in one year.\n\n9. DKC\n\nChris Pigott & Kate Brickman, Senior Vice Presidents\n\nOther key employees: Joe DePlasco, John Griffin, Anna Feiner, Jordan Lawrence, Mike Giardina\n\nNotable clients: Citi, RXR Realty, The Business Council of New York State, DoorDash, Kaufman Astoria Studios\n\nLed by Joe DePlasco and John Griffin, DKC’s public affairs group had a strong 2022, launching campaigns focused on immigration and refugees, antisemitism and the Holocaust, and the 40th anniversary of Citymeals on Wheels. DKC also won a 20-year legislative fight around ambulance services for the Firefighters Association of the State of New York and helped NYU Langone Health maintain its ranking as the top hospital in New York state. The firm hired Kate Brickman, the former communications director for Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges; former New York City Department of Social Services spokesperson Ian Martin and former New York City Department of Transportation spokesperson Alana Morales.\n\n10.

Led by Michael McKeon and Rachel Noerdlinger, the New York office has 19 employees providing media strategy, crisis management, communications and coalition building services for political, nonprofit, corporate and health care clients, with a special focus on diversity, equity and inclusion. In November, the firm coordinated a PR and voter education campaign with FPWA to back three groundbreaking racial justice ballot proposals. Actum also helped the Coalition for Fairness in SoHo and NoHo secure a rare mayoral veto and promoted “Loudmouth,” Rev. Al Sharpton’s documentary. Former Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. also came on as a co-chair and Chapin Fay rejoined his old Mercury colleagues as well.\n\n11. Mercury\n\nJohn Gallagher, President; Kuae Noel Kelch, Vice President of Media Relations; Michael Hardaway, Managing Director\n\nOther key employees: Dan Bank, Eric Bloom, Jake Dilemani, Greg Drilling, Eric Hersey, Karen Mustiga, Will Miller, Michael Nitzky, Jon Reinish, Carolyn Riggs, Kim Winston\n\nNotable clients: Somos Community Care, Rebuild New York Now, Tax Equity Now New York, African American Mayors Association\n\nMercury’s New York media relations and communication practice continues to expand under the leadership of John Gallagher, who was named president of the firm last year.

Northside Research + Consulting\n\nJonathan Davis, Managing Director\n\nIf the George Santos fiasco has illustrated anything, it’s the importance of oppo research.

Nothing in the previous sentence should be construed as an admission that the firm even exists.” A review of recent public filings, however, shows the firm worked for congressional candidates Alessandra Biaggi and Carlina Rivera as well as New York City mayoral candidate Scott Stringer."
