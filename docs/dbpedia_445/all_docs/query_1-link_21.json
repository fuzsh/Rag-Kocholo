        "text": "Achieving Unity in the Interpretation of Federal Private Law:\n\nLegal Framework and Fragments of Judicial Discourse\n\nTable of Contents\n\nNotes\n\n[1] Roderick A. Macdonald, \"Legal Bilingualism\" (1997), 42 McGill L.J. 119. The Bible passage is taken from the version published on the Vatican Internet site (https://www.vatican.va): The American Bible, United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\n[2] 30 & 31 Vict., U.K., c. 3 (reproduced in R.S.C. 1985, App. II, No. 5). We will in most cases quote the official English version. One need only read a few of the speeches given by George-Etienne Cartier at the time to understand that the project of Confederation was not motivated solely by commercial interests. Against the backdrop of the American Civil War, it was also important to protect the British Crown. See this excerpt from the speech given by Cartier in the Legislative Assembly on February 7, 1865: [TRANSLATION] \"We who have had the advantage of seeing republicanism in operation for some 80 years, of seeing its defects and its flaws, realized that purely democratic institutions are simply unable to guarantee the peace and prosperity of nations, and that we had to unite in a federation designed to perpetuate the aspect that is the monarchy.\" (Joseph Tasse, Discours de Sir Georges Cartier Baronnet accompagnés de notices, Montreal, Eusebe Senecal & Fils Imprimeurs-Éditeurs, 1893 (digital collection of Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec: http://www.banq.qc.ca). Evidently, monarchism as a unifying principle was substituted for the sovereignty of the people and its corollary, human rights. On this point, see: Peter H. RUSSELL, Constitutional Odyssey - Can Canadians Become a Sovereign People?, 2nd ed., Toronto, University of Toronto Press, 1993, p. 4.\n\n[3] We have read that the expression \"Dominion\" was preferred to \"Kingdom\" in view of the risk that the latter would upset the Americans. Again, the biblical reference is evident here. Samuel Leonard Tilley is said to have proposed \"Dominion\" as an alternative, referring to a line in the 72nd Psalm in the Bible: \"He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.\" See \"The London Conference\" in Canadian Confederation, Library and Archives Canada (http://collectionscanada.ca).\n\n[4] See, for example, the following excerpt from the speech given by George-Etienne Cartier, supra, footnote 2, p. 416: [TRANSLATION] \"It was argued that it would be impossible to make confederation work because of the diversity of races and religions. Those who share that opinion are mistaken. It is precisely because of diversity of races and local interests that the federal system must be established and will function well.\" See also, in the same speech, the passage quoted by the Supreme Court of Canada in Reference re Secession of Quebec, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 217, para. 43, where Cartier bemoans the fact that unity of races is \"utopian\".\n\n[5] Anecdotally, we would note the debates that took place in the House of Commons in November 2006 regarding recognition of the fact that \"the Quebecois form a nation\". On this point, it seems to us bizarre, to say the least, that the Bloc Quebecois did not, from a sovereignist perspective, use the expression \"Quebec\" in the motion that it presented and that was ultimately debated. We also find it particularly significant that the resolution adopted by the House included the phrase \"within a united Canada\". See: House of Commons, Journals, 1st Session, 39th Parliament, November 23, 2006, and November 27, 2006 (https://parl.gc.ca).\n\n[6] Reference re Secession of Quebec, supra, footnote 4. See, at para. 43: \"Federalism was the political mechanism by which diversity could be reconciled with unity.\" Federalism was seen by the Supreme Court as one of the fundamental constitutional principles of Canada. Note that unity and diversity have been analyzed using the five concepts of federalism said to prevail in Canada: Edwin R. Black, Divided Loyalties - Canadian concepts of federalism, Montreal / London, McGill / Queen's University Press, 1975. More recently, see Brouillet, \"The Federal Principle and the 2005 Balance of Powers in Canada\", (2006) 34 S.C.L.R. (2d) 307.\n\n[7] Constitution Act, 1867, subs. 92(13).\n\n[8] id., s. 91. We will return to the question of the division of powers in more detail in Part I.\n\n[9] The principle of diversity and the search for unity can be seen, for example, in s. 94 of the Constitution Act, 1867. That Section provides that Parliament may make provision for the uniformity of private law in the provinces other than Quebec. Regarding the tension between efficiency and diversity in interpreting the division of powers, see Jean Leclair, \"The Supreme Court of Canada's Understanding of Federalism: Efficiency at the Expense of Diversity\", (2003) Queen's L.J. 411.\n\n[10] They see this in, for example, the Department of Justice Canada's \"Policy on Legislative Bijuralism\" (1995), which refers simultaneously to the \"four Canadian legal audiences\" for federal legislation: \"Francophone civil law lawyers, Francophone common law lawyers, Anglophone civil law lawyers and Anglophone common law lawyers\". The Policy was published in The Harmonization of Federal Legislation with Quebec Civil Law and Canadian Bijuralism, Second Publication, Ottawa, Department of Justice Canada, 2001, Booklet 4, Appendix III.\n\n[11] Their task is particularly onerous, as we have said, because they are operating in a federal system. The search for unity is not unknown to unitary systems, however. It has been said of the Cour de Cassation, as [TRANSLATION] \"guardian of the unity of the law\": \"The diversity of interpreters and of their training and experience, the multiplicity of the relevant rules and principles, the complexity of the colours that infinitely changing facts bring to this allegedly imperturbable law-they all work to expand its circumference, which is nowhere, out from its centre, which is everywhere.\" (Christian Atias, \"L'image doctrinale de la Cour de cassation\", Recueil Dalloz Sirey de doctrine de jurisprudence et de citation, 1993, Chronique XXIX, p. 133).\n\n[12] Henry L. Molot, \"Clause 8 of Bill S-4: Amending the Interpretation Act\", in The Harmonization of Federal Legislation with Quebec Civil Law and Canadian Bijuralism, Second Publication, Ottawa, Department of Justice Canada, 2001, Booklet 6, p. 1.\n\n[13] This implied dependence was highlighted in a wonderfully learned article by Jean-Maurice Brisson and Andre Morel, \"Federal Law and Civil Law: Complementarity, Dissociation\" (1996), 75 R. du B. can. 297, p. 309 [in English: The Harmonization of Federal Legislation with Quebec Civil Law and Canadian Bijuralism, Collection of Studies, Ottawa, Department of Justice Canada, 1999, p. 217]. The \"co-penetration\" of the two bodies of law was noted by Jean Leclair, \"L'interface entre le droit commun privé provincial et les compétences fédérales 'attractives'\", in Ysolde Gendreau (ed.), A Copyright Cocktail, ALAI Canada / Éditions Thémis, 2007 (note that for the purposes of this study, we consulted a preliminary version of that paper, with the generous permission of the author). More generally, regarding the interdependency and complementarity of legislative powers, see Gerald-A. Beaudoin, La Constitution du Canada, 3rd ed., Montreal, Wilson & Lafleur, 2004, pp. 333, 334; Andre Tremblay, Droit constitutionnel-Principes, 2nd ed., Montreal, Éditions Thémis, 2000, pp. 328 et seq.\n\n[14] J. Leclair, loc. cit., footnote 13.\n\n[15] For an old but interesting article regarding efforts to achieve uniformity in Canada and the role of the courts in that regard, see, for example: John Willis, \"Securing Uniformity of Law in a Federal System - Canada\", (1943-1944) 5 U. of T. L.J. 367. Note this passage, from another era, in which the author refers to the unifying influence of the English common law on Canadian judges as an \"extra-legal factor\": \"To the ordinary Canadian practitioner, the common law of England is just as much his law, perhaps more so, than the common law of his own province.\" Might it not be thought that this feeling of belonging to a single tradition still has some influence today at the national level? On the other hand, with respect to the creative role of judges and the influence of the common law on case law in Quebec, we have the following passage regarding, more specifically, the example of international private law: [TRANSLATION] \"The influence of foreign law, and in particular English law, on the case law in Quebec has very often resulted from a phenomenon involving legal colonization. However, it can sometimes also be explained by eclecticism or even opportunism on the part of jurists in Quebec.\" (Adrian Popovici, \"Dans quelle mesure la jurisprudence et la doctrine sont-elles source de droit au Quebec ?\" (1973), 8 R.J.T. 189, 194).\n\n[16] J.-M. Brisson and A. Morel, loc. cit., footnote 13, p. 299. The authors analyze that relationship as it concerns the civil law, more specifically. As they say, their analysis also applies to the relationship between legislation and the common law (id.). This seems logical, given the foundations to which they refer, in particular in the case of implied dependence (id., p. 309-310).\n\n[17] See Ruth Sullivan, \"The Challenges of Interpreting Multilingual, Multijural Legislation\", (2004) 29 Brook. J. Int'l. L. 985, pp. 1030 and 1042.\n\n[18] Regarding the foundations, see J.-M. Brisson and A. Morel, loc. cit., footnote 13, pp. 303-304, 309-310.\n\n[19] The article by J.-M. Brisson and A. Morel, loc. cit., footnote 13, is replete with examples in which provincial law, and in particular the civil law, is first applied and then disregarded. For the purposes of this study, however, we have selected a large group of studies published by the Department of Justice Canada as part of the program to harmonize federal legislation with the civil law. Those studies are referred to specifically in the Appendix. For our purposes here, see, for example: David Duff, \"The Federal Income Tax Act and Private Law in Canada: Complementarity, Dissociation, and Canadian Bijuralism\" (2003), 51 Can Tax J. 1.\n\n[20] The examination of that relationship is particularly apparent in constitutional cases. For preliminary purposes, see, for example: Ordon Estate v. Grail, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 437, in maritime law, or Husky Oil Operations Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 453, in bankruptcy law. However, it is apparent that this examination is not limited to cases of dissociation. For an eloquent example, see St-Hilaire v. Canada (Attorney General), [2001] 4 F.C. 289 (F.C.A.).\n\n[21] Studies regarding bijuralism, particularly in the Supreme Court of Canada, have multiplied. However, those studies do not necessarily deal with federal private law; rather, they concern the convergence of traditions in Quebec or Canada: France Allard, \"The Supreme Court of Canada and Its Impact on the Expression of Bijuralism\", in The Harmonization of Federal Legislation with the Civil Law of the Province of Quebec and Canadian Bijuralism, Second Publication, Ottawa, Department of Justice Canada, 2001, Booklet 3; France Allard, \"Entre le droit civil et la common law: la propriete en quete de sens\", in Jean-Claude Gemar and Nicholas Kasirer (eds.), Jurilinguistique: entre langues et droits / Jurilinguistics: Between Law and Language, Paris, Editions juridiques Bruylant / Montreal, Éditions Thémis, 2003, p. 195; Louis Lebel and Pierre-Louis Le Saunier, \"L'interaction du droit civil et de la common law a la Cour supreme du Canada\"(2006), 47 C. de D. 179.\n\n[22] We examine the concept of common law in Part I of this study. For the moment, see John E.C. Brierley, \"Quebec's \"Common law\" (Droits communs): How many are there?\", in E. Caparros (ed.), Mélanges Louis-Philippe Pigeon, Montreal, Wilson & Lafleur, 1989; Jean-Maurice Brisson, \"Le Code civil, droit commun?\", in Le nouveau Code civil: interpretation et application, Journees Maximilien-Caron (1992, Faculte de droit, Universite de Montréal), Montréal, éditions Thémis, 1993.\n\n[23] Roderick A. Macdonald, \"Encoding Canadian Civil Law\", in Mélanges Paul-André Crepeau, McGill University Faculty of Law, Cowansville, éditions Yvon Blais, 1997.\n\n[24] R. Sullivan, loc. cit., footnote 17, p. 1042. Note that in the preceding sentence the author says that the federal courts do not have jurisdiction, in the absence of federal legislation, to create common law in areas under federal jurisdiction. However, we think there may have been some theoretical confusion on her part in respect of the common law concepts she uses for the purposes of her thesis (Which she takes from R.A. Macdonald) and that she takes in R.A. Macdonald, loc. cit., footnote 23. We will return to this [see infra, Part I, footnotes 231 to 233].\n\n[25] On this point, see the study by Jean-FranÃ§ois Gaudreault-Desbiens, Les solitudes du bijuridisme au Canada, Montréal, éditions Thémis, 2007. In another vein, see also John E.C. Brierley, \"Bijuralism in Canada\", in Droit contemporain - Rapports canadiens au Congres international de droit compare, Montreal, 1990, Montreal, Éditions Yvon Blais / Institut de droit compare, McGill University, 1992, p. 22: \"Bijuralism (bijuridisme) in Canada signifies the coexistence of the English Common law and the French Civil law traditions within a country organized along federal lines.\" See also Michel Bastarache, \"Bijuralism in Canada\", in The Harmonization of Federal Legislation with the Civil Law of the Province of Quebec and Canadian Bijuralism, Second Publication, Ottawa, Department of Justice Canada, 2001, Booklet 1. Note the subtle differences in perspective observed in those papers. Professor Brierley describes bijuralism in relation to Quebec, essentially, where the civil law took root, and associates federal law with common law (paras. 1, 4 and 9). Justice Bastarache makes no such distinction and focuses on the application of the civil law in federal law and the convergence of traditions.\n\n[26] On the distinction between formal sources and real sources, see Gerard Cornu, Vocabulaire juridique, Association Henri Capitant, 4th ed., Paris, P.U.F. / Quadrige, 2003, vo. \"Source (1a et 1b)\". See also: Gerard Cornu, Droit civil - Introduction - Les personnes - Les biens, 7th ed., Paris, Montchrestien, 1994, para. 72, p. 37; Gerald Gall, The Canadian Legal System, 5th ed., Scarborough, Ontario, Thomson - Carswell, 2004, pp. 35 et seq. and 273\n\n[27] We will return to this idea of the \"background canvas\". The expression is used by Justice L'Heureux-Dube in 2747-3174 Quebec Inc. v. Quebec (Regie des permis d'alcool), [1996] 3 S.C.R. 919.\n\n[28] We refer to \"norm\" and \"area\" because, as we shall see, federal private law is often defined in relation to legislative powers and not merely the norms, per se, corresponding to those powers. For a definition of \"private law\", see Nicholas Kasirer (ed.), Private Law Dictionary and Bilingual Lexicons -Obligations, Quebec Research Centre of Private and Comparative Law, Cowansville, Quebec, 2003, vo. \"Private Law\".\n\n[29] Where possible, we have tried to avoid confusion in the use of this terminology. However, on occasion, the expression \"federal private law legislation\", which, in principle, is less comprehensive, may be used by us where there is no legislation (see, for example, the case of maritime law). Thus, as metonymy, it may ultimately be used to include suppletive sources.\n\n[30] On the question of judicial sources, we will not be joining the debate as to whether judges play a different role depending on whether they sit in a common law or a civil law province. Nonetheless, there are those who assign judges, even in the French civil law, [TRANSLATION] \"an actual power to create law\": see Jacques Ghestin and Gilles Goubeaux, Traite de droit civil - Introduction generale, 4th ed., Paris, L.G.D.J. 1994, paras. 465 and 475 et seq. For a concise but very useful summary of the role of the case law as a source of law, see Gisele Laprise, Les outils du raisonnement et de la redaction juridique, Montreal, Éditions Thémis, 2000, chapter 1. See also G. Gall, op. cit., footnote 26, pp. 35 et seq., and 273 et seq.; Louise Belanger-Hardy and Aline Grenon (eds.), Elements de common law et apercu comparatif du droit civil quebecois, Scarborough, Ontario, Carswell, 1997, chapter 2.\n\n[31] Francois Chevrette, Herbert Marx, Droit constitutionnel, Notes et jurisprudence, Montreal, P.U.M., 1982, pp. 5-9. This very interesting passage was included as part of a discussion about the problem of the existence of a federal common law. The passage is quoted by J.-M. Brisson and A. Morel, loc. cit., footnote 13, pp. 309-310, in relation to the bases of the implied dependence of federal private law. Note the use of the word \"derive\" by Chevrette and Marx: does this mean that suppletive bijuralism is also derivative?\n\n[32] As we shall see, the concept of the common law as a \"body of law\" carries a connotation of unity rather than plurality. See the definition given by John E.C. Brierley, \"La notion de droit commun dans un systeme de droit mixte: le cas de la province de Quebec\", in La formation du droit national dans les pays de droit mixte, Aix-en-Provence, Presses universitaires d'Aix-Marseille, 1989, p. 104: [TRANSLATION] \"... it seems that we can nonetheless identify unity in the conception of the common law, and even in a mixed federal legal system. The concept of 'the common law' is nothing more than the expression of a certain idea: a particular body of norms applies unless expressly provided to the contrary.\" However, we might think that this idea of a normative corpus does not necessarily, in theoretical terms, preclude formal plurality of legal sources. On the question of the ongoing tension between unity and multiplicity in relation to the concept of common law(s), see H. Patrick Glenn, On Common Laws, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. vii and 88-91.\n\n[33] For these purposes, we therefore adopt the second definition of legislation given by Pierre-Andre Cote, Interpretation des lois, 3rd ed., Montreal, Éditions Thémis, 1999, pp. 3-4. Regarding vagueness in the law, see Cote, id., p. 19. See also, on the doctrine of vagueness, the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 606, in which the Court wrote: \"Semantic arguments, based on a perception of language as an unequivocal medium, are unrealistic. Language is not the exact tool some may think it is.\"\n\n[34] By \"formal source\" we mean the norm as it is recognized in its official form by the state: Gerard Cornu, Vocabulaire juridique, Association Henri Capitant, 4th ed., Paris, P.U.F. / Quadrige, 2003, vo. \"Source (1b)\": [TRANSLATION] \"Form as a result of which the rule is incorporated in the law; official form, referred to as formal source, whose positive effects determine the preparation, statement and enactment of a rule of law: function assigned to the law, custom, case law or literature by legal systems.\" See also, regarding sources of law: Jacques Ghestin and Gilles Goubeaux, Traite de droit civil - Introduction generale, 4th ed., Paris, L.G.D.J., 1994, No. 236 et seq.\n\n[35] Section 8.1, Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21.\n\n[36] We use this expression in the most general sense, to include the historical constitutional documents we will be discussing in this section. For a formal definition, see s. 52 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act, 1982 (U.K.) 1982, c. 11.\n\n[37] That continuity is illustrated by the use of the expression \"Property and Civil Rights\" in the foundational documents of Canadian private law. See infra, footnotes 77 and 82. We will consider the meaning of that expression in the Section dealing with the division of powers (I.A.1.(b)).\n\n[38] 30 & 31 Vict., U.K., c. 3 (reprinted in R.S.C. 1985, App. II, No. 5), ss. 91 and 92.\n\n[39] Id., heading VI.\n\n[40] Particularly in the common law provinces, these also include judge-made law. In Quebec, as well, we may also include the fundamental principles or customary standards, although the Civil Code covers the essential matters: John E.C. Brierley and Roderick A. Macdonald, Quebec Civil Law - An Introduction to Quebec Private Law, Toronto, Emond Montgomery Publications, 1993, No. 108. We will return to the continuation of this \"bouquet\" of pre-Confederation norms in the provinces under s. 129 of the Constitution Act, 1867 (see infra, footnote 68).\n\n[41] We will not be considering the issue from the perspective of aboriginal traditions; in any event, even if we assume that they are also private law systems, this would render the composition of federal law more complex.\n\n[42] This statement of the rules governing reception is based on Peter W. Hogg, Constitutional Law of Canada, 4th ed. (loose-leaf), vol. 1, Scarborough, Ontario, Thomson-Carswell, 1997 (update \"2005 - Release 1\"), para. 2-1; Francois Chevrette and Herbert Marx, Droit constitutionnel, Notes et jurisprudence, Montreal, P.U.M., 1982, pp. 5-9; Louise Belanger-Hardy and Aline Grenon (eds.), Ãlements de common law et aperÃ§u comparatif du droit civil quÃ©becois, Scarborough, Ontario, Carswell, 1997, pp. 51 et seq. For a detailed discussion of the rules of reception, see J.E. Cote, \"The Reception of English Law\" (1977), 15 Alta. L. Rev. 29, 31 et seq.\n\n[43] P.W. Hogg, op. cit., footnote 42, paras. 2-1 and 2-3(b); J.E. Cote, loc. cit., footnotes 42, 31 et seq. For an historical perspective, see Jacques Vanderlinden, \"La reception des systemes juridiques europeens au Canada - Regards d'un historien du droit sur ses origines\" (1996), 1:1 R.C.L.F. 1. Vanderlinden shows, for example, that there may have been a somewhat lengthy delay between assertion of imperial power over a territory and formal reception of its system of law in that territory.\n\n[44] For an overview of the constitutional history and its documentary sources, consult the website \"Canada in the Making\", under the heading \"Constitutional History\" (Early Canada Online collection, http://www.canadiana.org/citm/index_e.html).\n\n[45] J.E. Cote, loc. cit., footnotes 42, 14, the grant to Champlain authorized him to [TRANSLATION] \"legislate in the form of laws, statutes and ordinances . consistent with our own, in so far as he is able\".\n\n[46] John E.C. Brierley and Roderick A. Macdonald, Quebec Civil Law - An Introduction to Quebec Private Law, Toronto, Emond Montgomery Publications, 1993, No. 9, pp. 8 et seq. Note that for the purposes of this discussion we will not be considering the case of Rupert's Land, granted to the Hudson's Bay Company by the British Crown in 1670 and therefore subject to reception of English law (J.E. Cote, loc. cit., footnote 42, 3).\n\n[47] J.E.C. Brierley and R.A. Macdonald, op. cit., footnote 46, No. 9-11, pp. 9-11; J.E. Cote, loc. cit., footnote 42, 16. See Michel Morin, \"Introduction historique au droit civil quebecois\", in L. Belanger-Hardy and A. Grenon (eds.), op. cit., footnote 42, p. 59-62; Louis Perret, \"Peut-on combiner les modeles ? Le Quebec comme systeme mixte\", in F. Rouvillois (ed.), Le modele juridique francais est-il un obstacle au developpement economique ?, Fondation pour l'innovation politique, Paris, Dalloz, 2005, p. 101.\n\n[48] Treaty of Paris, 1763, reproduced in Andre Tremblay (ed.), Droit constitutionnel canadien et quebecois - Documents, Montreal, Éditions Thémis, 1999, p. 21; Royal Proclamation, October 7, 1763, Proclamation by King George III (reprinted in R.S.C. 1985, App. II, No. 1). With respect to that period, see J.E.C. Brierley and R.A. Macdonald, op. cit., footnote 46, no 11, pp. 11 et seq.; P.W. Hogg, op. cit., footnote 42, para 2-3(b). On the question of whether this was a conquest or a cession (because the territory was conquered militarily, and the expression \"cedes and guarantees\" is used in the Treaty of Paris), the question is of little significance here, since the effect in relation to the rules of reception is the same. With respect to the ambiguity that prevailed during Murray's military government between 1760 and 1763, see J.E.C. Brierley and R.A. Macdonald, id., No. 46, p. 15.\n\n[49] Regarding the legal uncertainty caused by the Royal Proclamation of 1763, see J.E.C. Brierley and R.A.

VIII: \"may also hold and enjoy their Property and Possessions, together with all Customs and Usages relative thereto, and all other their Civil Rights, in as large, ample, and beneficial Manner, as if the said Proclamation, Commissions, Ordinances, and other Acts and Instruments, had not been made\".\n\n[52] Id., s.

Cote, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 139, para. 49.\n\n[54] As history shows, these measures led, at least in part, to the introduction of English law norms. Quebec law was made bijural by the imposition of English law in public law matters and in a number of private law matters, and so began its slow evolution toward being a mixture of sources in its private law: \"The result, in private law matters, was the alteration over the next years of Quebec Civil law into the law of a bijural jurisdiction: portions of English law coexisted with the body of old French law reinstituted under the Act.\" (J.E.C. Brierley and R.A. Macdonald, op. cit., footnote 46, no 14, p. 17).\n\n[55] Regarding the evolution of the law after that period and the development of a Canadian \"civil law\", see J.E.C.

III, U.K., c. 31 (reprinted in R.S.C. 1985, App. II, No. 3); Union Act, 1840, 3-4 Vict., U.K., c. 35 (reprinted in R.S.C. 1985, App. II, No. 4; hereinafter \"Union Act\").\n\n[57] Section XXXIII of the Constitutional Act, 1791 and s. XLVI of the Union Act use exactly the same wording: \"all Laws, Statutes, and Ordinances ... shall remain and continue to be of the same Force, Authority, and Effect ... as if this Act had not been made\". Note that the Union Act did not operate to unify the two private law systems, with the clearly expressed proviso in s. XLVI that the laws applicable in each province at the time of Union continued to be in force \"in those Parts of the Province of Canada ... as if the said Two provinces had not been united\". On this point, see P.W. Hogg, op. cit., footnote 42, para. 2-3(b).\n\n[58] The final provisions of s. XXXIII of the Constitutional Act, 1791 and s. XLVI of the Union Act allow the Assemblies to \"repeal or vary\" the law in force, and that is what Lord Durham suggested be done in respect of the civil law, in his report prior to the 1840 Union. For an historical account and reference regarding the period that led to the 1886 codification, see J.E.C. Brierley and R.A. Macdonald, op. cit., footnote 46, No. 15 et seq., pp. 18 et seq.; Murray GREENWOOD, \"Lower Canada (Quebec): Transformation of Civil Law, from Higher Morality to Autonomous Will, 1774-1866\", in Canada's Legal Inheritances (1996), 23 Man. L.J. 132.\n\n[59] Section XXXIII of the Constitutional Act, 1791 provides for this as follows: \"except ... in so far as the same [all Laws, Statutes, and Ordinances, which shall be in force ...] shall or may hereafter, by virtue of and under the authority of this Act, be repealed or varied by his Majesty, his heirs or successors, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Legislative Councils and Assemblies of the said Provinces respectively ... .\"\n\n[60] An Act to repeal certain parts of an Act passed in the fourteenth year of His Majesty's Reign, entitled \"An Act making more effectual provision for the Government of the Province of Quebec in North America,\" and to introduce the English Law as the Rule of Decision in all matters of controversy, relating to Property and Civil Rights, U.C. 32 Geo. III, c. 1 (assented to on October 15, 1792). A similar statute is still in force in the Revised Statutes of Ontario: Property and Civil Rights Act, L.R.O. 1990, c. P-29.\n\n[61] Section 1 provides: \"And whereas, since the passing of the act aforesaid, that part of the late province of Quebec now comprehended within the province of Upper Canada, having become inhabited principally by the British subjects, born and educated in countries where the English laws were established, and who are unaccustomed to the laws of Canada ...\". See P.W. Hogg, op. cit., footnote 42, para. 23(b); Paul Romney, \"Upper Canada (Ontario): The Administration of Justice, 1784-1850\", in Canada's Legal Inheritances (1996), 23 Man. L.J. 132. For an historical overview of the history of Upper Canada, see the article entitled \"Upper Canada\" on the Internet site of the Canadian Encyclopedia, Historica Foundation (http://www.the canadianencyclopedia.com).\n\n[61a] As the title states, the Upper Canada statute provides for the \"repeal\" of the provision of s. VIII of the Quebec Act, in fact set out in an Act of the British Parliament: \"... be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council and Assembly of the Province of Upper Canada, ... that from and after the passing of this Act, the said provision, contained in the said Act of the fourteenth year of his present Majesty, be, and the same is hereby repealed ... .\"\n\n[62] Act, supra, footnote 60, s. III. Compare the formula used here with the one used in the Quebec Act, supra, footnote 52.\n\n[63] P.W. Hogg, op. cit., footnote 42, para. 2-3(b): \"This was an adoption of English laws as of 1792, and it established 1792 as the date of reception of English law for what is now Ontario\". The expression \"secondary reception\" is used in respect of French law by J. Vanderlinden, loc. cit., footnote 43, p. 32.\n\n[64] supra, footnotes 57 and 58.\n\n[65] The dates of reception are important for determining what the law thus received was when it began to evolve. On this point, concerning the various dates on which English law was received in the provinces and territories of Canada, see J.E. Cote, loc. cit., footnote 42; J. Vanderlinden, loc. cit., footnote 43; P.W. Hogg, op. cit., footnote 42. The date of formal reception of the European civil law tradition is less certain in the case of Quebec. Given that the provisions of the Royal Proclamation were repealed by the Quebec Act, the dates of the French edicts of 1663 and 1664 could be taken as the historical signposts for the formal introduction of the Coutume de Paris in New France (see supra, footnote 46). Some propose 1774, the date of the Quebec Act: F. Chevrette, H. Marx, op. cit., footnote 42, p. 7. Note that for Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, the presence of French law and the \"cession\" of the colonies by France are not usually considered, since those colonies are considered to have been settlements (see P.W. Hogg, op. cit., footnote 42, para 2-1).\n\n[66] supra, footnote 57.\n\n[67] The title of the Act was formerly the British North America Act; it was changed by the Constitution Act, 1982, Schedule B to the Canada Act, 1982 (U.K.) 1982, c. 11, s. 53(2). Because the French version of the Constitution Act, 1867 is unofficial (see s. 55 of the Constitution Act, 1982), we quote the English only. We refer to the Department of Justice Canada administrative codification, April 1, 1996.\n\n[68] P.W. Hogg, op. cit., footnote 42, para. 2-4; Jean Leclair, \"Reflexions sur les problemes constitutionnels souleves par l'abrogation du Code civil du Bas Canada\" (1997), 99 R. du N. 155, 158-159. Both authors describe the content of this \"bouquet\" of pre-Confederation norms, to use Professor Leclair's expression. Professor Hogg gives the following description: (1) laws received by the colony; (2) laws enacted for the colony under Royal Prerogative; (3) statute law enacted for the colony by the Imperial Parliament; (4) judicial developments since date of reception; (5) statute law enacted by the colonial legislature.\n\n[69] On the non-reception of pre-Confederation private law into the federal legal system, see J. Leclair, loc. cit., footnote 68, p. 191. On that point, Professor Leclair cites ITO - International Terminal Operators v. Miida Electronics, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 752, para. 30 (hereinafter \"ITO\"). Contra: Roderick A. Macdonald, \"Encoding Canadian Civil Law\", in Melanges Paul-Andre Crepeau, McGill University Faculty of Law, Cowansville, Quebec, Éditions Yvon Blais, 1997, p. 579.\n\n[70] ITO - International Terminal Operators v. Miida Electronics, supra, footnote 69, para. 27; J. Leclair, loc. cit., footnote 68, p. 160; P.W. Hogg, op. cit., footnote 42, para. 2-4.\n\n[71] A. (P.) v. G.(C.), [2002] R.J.Q. 2612, J.E. 2002-1818 (Que. C.A.), para. 30; J.E.C. 71 A. (P.) v. G.(C.), [2002] R.J.Q. 2612, J.E. 2002-1818 (Que. C.A.), para. 30; J.E.C. Brierley and R.A. Macdonald, op. cit., footnote 46, No. 44. This question, which is related to the question of the reception of pre-Confederation law into the federal legal system, is still a matter on which there is disagreement: see, for example, Chippewas of Sarnia Band v. Canada (Attorney General) (2000), 195 D.L.R. (4th) 135, 51 O.R. (3d) 641 (Ont. C.A.), paras. 224, 225, 234. There are those who argue that pre-Confederation law became \"federal law\" in 1867, in areas under federal jurisdiction (see R.A. Macdonald, loc. cit., footnote 69, para. 46). In our opinion, and as Professor Leclair said (supra, footnote 69), the language and purpose of s. 129 of the Constitution Act, 1867 does not support that theory. In ITO (supra, footnote 69, para. 27), McIntyre J. clearly stated: \"Section 129 does not, in my opinion, support an argument for referential incorporation of provincial law.\" The decision of the Federal Court of Appeal cited by McIntyre J., Associated Metals and Minerals Corporation v. The \"Evie W\", [1978] 2 F.C. 710, paras. 6 and 7, refers to pre-Confederation law to determine the jurisdiction of the Federal Court (\"for the purposes of Section 101\"). Certainly there is the question of how, under s. 129, Parliament could have repealed or amended (\"to be repealed, abolished, or altered\") the law that had been continued in a province. In our opinion, this does not present a problem, if we acknowledge that residual private law was under federal jurisdiction, while still being plural and localized in the provinces. Nonetheless, we couldn't, without extrapolating, infer that a residual general law (jus commune) was received (Professor Macdonald uses the expression \"carry forward\") into the federal legal system, based on a provision whose purpose is to ensure the continuity of the law in the provinces. We will return to this question in the Section dealing with the absence of federal common law (I.A.2(a)). See, in particular, infra, footnotes 123 and 128.\n\n[72] P.W. Hogg, op. cit., footnote 42, para. 2-4: \"With respect to matters within federal legislative authority, there was no single body of law in 1867\". Professor Hogg gives the example of the federal Divorce Act which was only enacted in 1968. However, he notes that there is no constitutional requirement of uniformity in federal law (paras. 2-4 and 17.3(b)). See also s. 94 of the Constitution Act, 1867.\n\n[73] We will return, infra, footnote 85, to Parliament's private law powers.\n\n[74] Regarding the distinction between \"general\" jurisdiction and \"exceptional\" jurisdiction, see Jean Leclair, \"La Constitution par l'histoire: portee et etendue de la competence federale exclusive en matiere de lettres de change et de billets a ordre\" (1992), 33 C. de D. 53, 541-548. See also F. Chevrette, H. Marx, op. cit., footnote 42, p. 639.\n\n[75] The expression is seen, in respect of the division of powers, as early as in the Quebec Resolutions of October 1864 (Resolutions 29 and 43). Note that Resolution 43 confirms the exceptional nature of federal private law powers, in that it provides that jurisdiction in this regard is assigned to the provinces \"excepting those portions thereof assigned to the General Parliament\".\n\n[76] On this point, see Andre Tremblay, Les competences legislatives au Canada et les pouvoirs provinciaux en matiere de propriete et de droits civils, Ottawa, University of Ottawa Press, 1967, pp. 39 et seq.; Gerald-A. Beaudoin, La Constitution du Canada, 3rd ed., Montreal, Wilson & Lafleur, 2004, p. 413. For an historical perspective on the constitutional negotiations, see George F.G. Stanley, \"Act or Pact? Another Look at Confederation\", Report of the Annual Meeting, Canadian Historical Association, 1956, 1-25 (http://www.cha-shc.ca).\n\n[77] Regarding the meaning of this expression in the Quebec Act of 1774 (supra, footnote 50), see Louis-Philippe Pigeon, Drafting and Interpreting Legislation, Quebec, Les Publications du Quebec, 1988: \"...property and civil rights\" must be interpreted according to the meaning given to the expression in an Act of the British Parliament, passed in 1774, since the words must not be interpreted according to civil law.\" (p. 110). See also John E.C. Brierley, \"Bijuralism in Canada\", in Contemporary Law - Canadian Reports to the International Congress of Comparative Law, Montreal, 1990, Montreal, Éditions Yvon Blais / Institute of Comparative Law, McGill University, 1992, p. 22.\n\n[78] This is the broad interpretation. A narrow interpretation is also possible, particularly having regard to the Royal Instructions of 1775 to Governor Carleton. As well, the expression may not completely correspond to the concept of private law. On these questions, see A. Tremblay, op. cit., footnote 76, pp. 19 et seq.; J. Leclair, loc. cit., footnote 74, pp. 541-548. A detailed historical analysis, which also adopts a liberal approach, is given in W.F. O'Connor, \"Property and Civil Rights in the Province\" (1940), 18 Can. Bar Rev. 331, 337.\n\n[79] On the question of the sources of private law and public law in Quebec, see Laurentide Motels Ltd. v. Beauport (City), supra, footnote 53. The Supreme Court quotes L.-P. Pigeon, op. cit., footnote 77. Pigeon's reasoning is that anything that is not expressly set out in the Quebec Act derives from English public law. Laurentide Motels was recently revisited in Prud'homme v. Prud'homme, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 663. On this question, and the historical interpretation of the expression \"Property and Civil Rights\", see the nuances suggested by Andree Lajoie, Contrats administratifs: jalons pour une theorie, Montreal, Éditions Thémis, 1984, pp. 48 et seq. For a recent analysis of the relationship between the civil law and administrative law, see Denis Lemieux, \"Le role du Code civil du Quebec en droit administratif\" (2005), 18 Can. J. Admin. L. & Prac. 119.\n\n[80] P.W. Hogg, op. cit., footnote 42, para. 21.2; F. Chevrette, H. Marx, op. cit., footnote 42, p. 639. The Privy Council influenced the determination of the broad meaning of the expression, in particular in Citizens Insurance Company of Canada v. Parsons (1881-1882), 7 A.C. 96, 110 et seq. See A. Tremblay, op. cit., footnote 76, pp. 76 et seq.; W.F. O'Connor, loc. cit., footnote 78, pp. 335 et seq.; W.R. Lederman, \"Unity and Diversity in Canadian Federalism: Ideals and Methods of Moderation\" (1975), 53 Can. Bar Rev. 597, 601.\n\n[81] John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton, [1915] A.C. 330. Professor J. Leclair, loc. cit., footnote 74, p. 544, alludes to the \"virtual meaning\" of the expression.\n\n[82] P.W. Hogg, op. cit., footnote 42, para. 21.2. See also Henry Brun and Guy Tremblay, Droit constitutionnel, 4th ed., Cowansville, Quebec, Éditions Yvon Blais, 2002, p. 475; G.-A. Beaudoin, op. cit., footnote 76, pp. 414 et seq.\n\n[83] Private law, particularly in Quebec, is not limited solely to the civil law, since it may also include, for example, commercial law and civil procedure. See Nicholas Kasirer (ed.), Private Law Dictionaries and Bilingual Lexicons - Obligations, Quebec Research Centre of Private and Comparative Law, Cowansville, Quebec, 2003, vo. \"Private Law\".\n\n[84] P.W. Hogg, op. cit., footnote 42, para. 21.2; W.R. Lederman, loc. cit., footnote 80, p. 601.\n\n[85] P.W. Hogg, op. cit., footnote 42, para. 21.2; J. Leclair, loc. cit., footnote 74, p. 546; G.-A. Beaudoin, op. cit., footnote 76, pp. 437 et seq; H. Brun and G. Tremblay, op. cit., note 82, pp. 478 et seq. The category fluctuates and the authors also add other examples: navigation (subs. 91(10)), currency (subs. 91(14)), weights and measures (subs. 91(17)), legal tender (subs. 91(20)), penitentiaries (subs. 91(28)).\n\n[86] H. Brun and G. Tremblay, op. cit., footnote 82, p. 479; P.W. Hogg, op. cit., footnote 42, para. 21.2. Professor Hogg refers to the general federal power set out in the introductory sentence of s. 91. Note also that subs. 92(13) includes the phrase \"in the Province\". For an analysis of the general power in relation to the provinces' exclusive jurisdiction over property and civil rights, see, in particular, Jean Leclair, \"The Elusive Quest for the Quintessential 'National Interest'\" (2005), 38 U.B.C. Law Rev. 353, 356 et seq.\n\n[87] This idea is taken from Professor Jean Leclair of the Université de Montréal faculty of law, who stated it in: \"L'interface entre le droit commun privé provincial et les compétences fédérales 'attractives'\", in Ysolde Gendreau (ed.), Un cocktail de droit d'auteurs, ALAI Canada / Éditions Thémis, 2007, p. 25 (note that for the purposes of this study, we consulted a preliminary version of that paper, with the generous permission of the author). Professor Leclair's learned comments in that paper were a major source of inspiration for this section, and in particular the portion that follows.\n\n[88] Id.: [TRANSLATION] \"In so far as they relate to private law, sections 91 and 92 of the Constitution share this feature, and this characteristic is of crucial importance: they both assign a power of the same nature. . The defining characteristic of private law is precisely the unity and interpenetration of the parts that compose the whole\". See John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton, supra, footnote 81; G.-A. Beaudoin, op. cit., footnote 76, pp. 331-335.\n\n[89] Professor Leclair uses the expression [TRANSLATION] \"filling the gaps\": id., p. 6. To describe the nature of this relationship, the idea of a \"reservoir\" has been used: Jean-Maurice Brisson, \"L'impact du Code civil du Quebec sur le droit federal: une problematique\" (1992), R. du B. 345, 348. On the idea of complementarity in the division of powers, see G.-A. Beaudoin, op. cit., footnote 76, p. 334; Andre Tremblay, Droit constitutionnel - Principes, 2nd ed., Montreal, Éditions Thémis, 2000, pp. 328 et seq. Here we see the idea of the characteristic function of the \"common law\", to which we will return later (infra, footnote 112). The nature of the relationship between federal law and the civil law has been described by referring to superimposition and insertion: see infra, footnote 145.\n\n[90] Jean-Maurice Brisson and André Morel, \"Droit fédéral et droit civil: complementarité, dissociation\" (1996), 75 R. du B. can. 297, 299. G.-A. Beaudoin, op. cit., footnote 76, p. 334, refers to [TRANSLATION] \"interdependence\".\n\n[91] On the rule of exhaustiveness in the division of powers, which is related to the idea of complementarity, see Reference re Same-Sex Marriage, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 698, para. 34; H. Brun and G. Tremblay, op. cit., footnote 82, p. 448; P.W. Hogg, op. cit., footnote 42, para. 15.9(e).\n\n[92] For a recent example dealing with the analysis of the \"essential elements\" of a \"specific\" federal power, as compared with the \"general\" power of the provinces in relation to property and civil rights, see: Reference re Employment Insurance Act, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 669.\n\n[93] Cushing v. Dupuy (1880), 5 A.C. 409: \"It is therefore to be presumed, indeed it is a necessary implication, that the Imperial statute, in assigning to the Dominion Parliament the subjects of bankruptcy and insolvency, intended to confer on it legislative power to interfere with property, civil rights, and procedure within the Provinces, so far as a general law relating to those subjects might affect them.\"\n\n[94] J. Leclair, loc. cit., footnote 87, p. 6. On the principles of interpretation that apply to the division of powers, from the standpoint of efficiency (unity) versus diversity, see also, by the same author: Jean Leclair, \"The Supreme Court of Canada's Understanding of Federalism: Efficiency at the Expense of Diversity\", (2003) Queen's L.J. 411, 416 et seq.\n\n[95] On the double aspect theory, see Hodge v. The Queen (1883-1884), 9 A.C. 117: \"The principle ... is, that subjects which in one aspect and for one purpose fall within sect. 92, may in another aspect and for another purpose fall within sect. 91.\" On the watertight compartment theory, see A.G. Canada v. A.G. Ontario (Labour Conventions), [1937] A.C. 326: \"While the ship of state now sails on larger ventures and into foreign waters she still retains the watertight compartments which are an essential part of her original structure.\"\n\n[96] Reference re Same-Sex Marriage, supra, footnote 91, para. 32.\n\n[97] Kirkbi AG v.

On the origin of this power, compare H. Brun and G. Tremblay, op. cit., footnote 82, p. 457 and G.-A. Beaudoin, op. cit., footnote 76, p. 354.\n\n[99] Rothmans, Benson & Hedges v. Saskatchewan, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 188; Multiple Access v. McCutcheon, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 161, in which the Court held that paramountcy applies only where there is a real conflict, where one enactment says \"yes\" and the other \"no\". The first-mentioned decision gave a more nuanced answer. See also the approach adopted in Bank of Montreal v. Hall, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 121; Law Society of British Columbia v. Mangat, supra, footnote 98.\n\n[100] J. Leclair, loc. cit., footnote 87, pp. 7 et seq.\n\n[101] Bank of Montreal v. Hall, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 121; Husky Oil Operations Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 453. In the latter decision there seems to have been some confusion between the ideas of compatibility and applicability of legislation. On this point, see H. Brun and G. Tremblay, op. cit., footnote 82, p. 464; J. Leclair, loc. cit., footnote 87, p. 10. The \"occupied field\" argument was rejected in Rothmans, Benson & Hedges v.

Brierley, loc cit., footnote 77, p. 27. The author takes this further, and is of the opinion that private law matters under federal jurisdiction are directly connected with the common law. On this point, see the comments by J.-M. Brisson, loc. cit., footnote 89, p. 346, at footnote 3; J.-M. Brisson and A. Morel, loc. cit., footnote 90, p. 311, at footnote 52. On the question of provincial private law, we would recall that the Parliament of Canada has authority to impose uniformity only in respect of Ontario, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, with the agreement of the provincial legislatures (s. 94, Constitution Act, 1867).\n\n[106] See supra, footnote 72; J.E.C. Brierley and R.A. Macdonald, op. cit., footnote 46, No. 44. The Parliament of Canada did not legislate in relation to the substantive requirements, in respect of Quebec, until 2001: Federal Law-Civil Law Harmonization Act No. 1, S.C. 2001, c. 4, ss. 4-7. A national law redefining the substantive requirements to include same-sex spouses was then enacted in 2005: Civil Marriage Act, S.C. 2005, c. 33.\n\n[107] The concept of \"common law\" is closely connected with the sources: \"The notion of a droit commun or 'common law' is a device for advancing a justification for the selection of legal rules that goes beyond this dimension of historical fact. It reaches into the very heart of the theoretical scheme of 'sources of law' in the legal system as a whole and plays the role of an ultimate justification.\" (John E.C. Brierley, \"Quebec's 'Common law' (Droits communs): How many are there?\", in E. CAPARROS (ed.), Mélanges Louis-Philippe Pigeon, Montreal, Wilson & Lafleur, 1989, 109, at p. 113.\n\n[108] Id., p. 114; H. Patrick Glenn, \"La Disposition préliminaire du Code civil du Québec, le droit commun et les principes généraux du droit\" (2005), 46 C. de D. 339, 340-341.\n\n[109] Professor J.E.C. Brierley, loc. cit., footnote 107, p. 114, notes three possible meanings of the concept of common law, of which we will refer mainly to the first and third here: \"Beyond the droit commun residing in 'historical fact' ..., there is a droit commun residing in 'implicit norms' and a further droit commun residing in the Civil Code itself because of its particular form as a 'legislative enactment'.\" We will return to the second meaning later.\n\n[110] J.E.C. Brierley, loc. cit., footnote 55, p. 104. See Nicholas Kasirer (ed.), op. cit., footnote 83, vo. \"droit commun\": [TRANSLATION] \"1. Law that serves as the substantive basis for an entire legal system and that therefore applies where there are no specific rules\".\n\n[111] As H.P. Glenn wrote, loc. cit., footnote 108, p. 341, regarding the [TRANSLATION] \"multiplicity of common laws\": \"Each common law evidently represents a unique, isolated experience, one that approaches the universal but never achieves it.\" In his authoritative work on the diversity of common laws (H. Patrick Glenn, On Common Laws, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2005, p. vii), Professor Glenn explains this constant tension between the single and the multiple: \"What has been lost in all of this is the idea that law is common in relation to law which is not common, which is particular, and that a common law lives in constant, dialogical tension with an inescapable intellectual companion, the jus particulare.\" On the multiplicity of common laws in federations, id., pp. 88-91.\n\n[112] On the question of the evolution of the concept of common law, from the Roman vision of mandatory application to a European vision of suppletive application, see H. Patrick Glenn, loc. cit., footnote 108, pp. 342 et seq. On the suppletive function of a civil code, in particular the function of filling the gaps left by legislation as a \"reservoir\", and its structuring function, see Jean-Maurice Brisson, \"Le Code civil, droit commun?\", in Le nouveau Code civil: interprétation et application, Journées Maximilien-Caron (1992, Faculty of Law, Université de Montréal), Montreal, Éditions Thémis, 1993, p. 296; J.E.C. Brierley and R.A. Macdonald, op. cit., footnote 46, No. 32; J.E.C. Brierley, loc. cit., footnote 107, pp. 122 et seq.\n\n[113] S.Q. 1991, c. 64. In a recent decision, the Supreme Court of Canada described the Civil Code as \"the basic general law in Quebec\": Gilles E. Neron Communication Marketing Inc. v.

On the subject of the preliminary provision, and in particular the history of the wording of the provision and the definition of the concept of jus commune that it conveys, see Alain-Francois Bisson, \"La Disposition préliminaire du Code civil du Québec\"(1999), 44 McGill L.J. 539.\n\n[114] J.E.C. Brierley, loc. cit., footnote 107, p. 114.\n\n[115] The expressions are taken from J.E.C. Brierley, loc. cit., footnote 55, p. 115, H.P. Glenn, loc. cit., footnote 108, p. 349, and J.-M. Brisson, loc. cit., footnote 112, p. 296, respectively. That last reference indicates that we include in this meaning the common law seen primarily from the standpoint of its [TRANSLATION] \"conceptual function\" (id., p. 308). See also, on this point, J.E.C. Brierley, loc. cit., footnote 55, p. 111.\n\n[116] To quote J.E.C. Brierley, id., pp. 115 et seq., the common law is understood in this sense as [TRANSLATION] \"a reservoir of law based on the implicit values of a particular society\". It can be the basis of both private law and fundamental public law, as in the case of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This idea of the common law also derives, it seems to us, from the conception of underlying constitutional principles that the Supreme Court of Canada described in Reference re Secession of Quebec, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 217. That decision refers to these two important characteristics: the suppletive function and the normative function. Note in particular the discussion of the \"nature of the principles\" (paras. 49 et seq.) and this eloquent sentence: \"These principles inform and sustain the constitutional text: they are the vital unstated assumptions upon which the text is based.\" In that passage, which is replete with metaphors for life, the Court writes that the principles \"function in symbiosis\", they \"inform and sustain the constitutional text\", they are its \"lifeblood\". The Court says that the principles \"may in certain circumstances give rise to substantive legal obligations\", that they \"are also invested with a powerful normative force\". It will be noted that these principles - which the Court also calls \"values\", \"postulates\", \"guides\". and even \"lodestar\" ! - appear to have moved beyond the stage of judicial \"settling\" and acquired mandatory force. For example, regarding the preamble, the Court lays out this method (para. 53): \"... we determined that the preamble 'invites the courts to turn those principles into the premises of a constitutional argument that culminates in the filling of gaps in the express terms of the constitutional text'.\"\n\n[117] This aspect of the common law is associated with its written manifestations, they being a part of that whole, and in particular the Civil Code, which was described as follows in J.E.C. Brierley and R.A. Macdonald, op. cit., footnote 46, No. 31: \"Substantively, a Code also has a unique role. Unlike a statute, it is not merely an episodic or instrumental reflection of parliamentary will: it is the distillation in legislative form of the animating themes, fundamental values, transcendent principles, and institutions of the private law.\" On the Civil Code as \"background canvas\", see infra, footnote 127.\n\n[118] This is what Professor J.-M. Brisson (loc. cit., footnote 112, p. 305) calls [TRANSLATION] \"substantive common law\". He describes it as follows, speaking of the Civil Code: [TRANSLATION] \"... the fundamental civil law, that is, the body of legal rules that will ordinarily provide the philosophical and intellectual basis of the civil law in its entirety.\".\n\n[119] H.P. Glenn, loc. cit., footnote 108, pp. 348 et seq. He defines the \"general principles\" from a comparative law perspective, as follows: [TRANSLATION] \"To speak of general principles is to speak of a suppletive common law, drawn from multiple sources, which, where necessary, supplements local or regional law.\" With regard to the preliminary provision and the references in that provision to \"general principles\", see A.-F. Bisson, loc. cit., footnote 113, pp. 556-557. Professor Bisson describes the general principles as follows: [TRANSLATION] \"... enigmatic, elastic normative entities that are always on call; there has almost never been agreement as to their autonomous existence, their nature, their provenance and their legitimate functions, but they serve as the spirit and the spine of the system. There are those who will flush them out of the legislation itself; others look inward to the spirit of the national law; still others see them in legal tradition; and then there are those who find them in a sort of universal, or at least widespread, reason, which comparative law is suited to provide.\" And see Cie immobilière Viger Ltée v. Laureat Giguère Inc., [1977] 2 S.C.R. 67, in which the doctrine of unjust enrichment was recognized in civil law, in this statement in particular: \"The Civil Code does not contain the whole of civil law. It is based on principles that are not all expressed there, which it is up to case law and doctrine to develop . .\"\n\n[120] [1977] 2 S.C.R. 1054. See also McNamara Construction (Western) Ltd. v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 654 (hereinafter \"McNamara\"); R. v. Thomas Fuller Construction Co. (1958) Ltd., [1980] 1 S.C.R. 695 (hereinafter \"Fuller\"). For a summary of the tests for determining the jurisdiction of the Federal Court, see ITO, supra, footnote 69.\n\n[121] Quebec North Shore Paper Co. v. Canadian Pacific Ltd., supra, footnote 120, para. 5: \"This contention suggests a comprehen-sive incorporation or referential adoption of pro-vincial law to feed the jurisdiction of the Federal Court under s. 23.\"\n\n[122] Id., para. 17. The Court states: \"...whether under stat-ute or regulation or common law, as in the case of the Crown ... .\" In McNamara, supra, footnote 120, the Supreme Court determined that a common law rule allowing the Crown to bring action in any court of competent jurisdiction in the matter was not applicable in Canada and therefore was not legislation assigning jurisdiction to the Federal Court, since that rule cannot apply in a federal state whose Constitution provides for the division of powers and the power to establish courts. When action is brought against the Crown, however, the situation may be different. On that point, see the difficulties that arose in Fuller, supra, footnote 120. For an interpretation of the words \"common law\" in the expression quoted above, see Roberts v. Canada, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 322. The effect of that interpretation, for determining the jurisdiction of the Federal Court, was to confirm that there is a \"common law relating to aboriginal title which underlies the fiduciary nature of the Crown's obligations.\" Because Indian title was declared to be sui generis, it also being a collective title and a fiduciary obligation of the Crown, we might wonder whether this is not an example of federal public common law. At least, that is the conclusion that tends to emerge on reading R. v. Cote, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 139, para. 49, where the Supreme Court held the law of aboriginal title to be a \"distinct species of federal common law\" and referred in its analysis to the pivotal role of \"British sovereignty\" or the fact that the issue was the \"relations between the British Crown and indigenous societies\". (Regarding aboriginal title, see also Delgamuukw v. British Columbia, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 1010; Osoyoos Indian Band v. Oliver (Town), [2001] 3 S.C.R. 746, paras. 41 to 47). Thus while the existence of a federal \"common law\", as judge-made law, can be argued in some cases (for example, \"as in the case of the Crown\" or perhaps aboriginal title), its necessarily very limited scope must be acknowledged (\"in some areas\", in the words of Wilson J. in Roberts) as compared with the body of private law that makes up the common law of a province.\n\n[123] For a consistent critique of that decision, one that is, it seems to us, motivated primarily by a concern for efficiency and uniformity, see P.W. Hogg, op. cit., footnote 42, para. 7.2(b). See also R.A. Macdonald, loc. cit., footnote 69, paras. 39 and 40. He quotes, specifically, R. v. Rhine, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 442. Note, however, that in the opinion of the Supreme Court, this was a case in which the Federal Court's jurisdiction in respect of contracts was based on a \"detailed statutory framework\". The Court added: \"In the McNamara case, there was no such statutory shelter within which the transactions there were contained as there is in the present case.\" (Emphasis added). The Court did add: \"It should hardly be necessary to add that 'contract' or other legal institutions, such as 'tort' cannot be invariably attributed to sole provincial legislative regulation or be deemed to be, as common law, solely matters of provincial law.\" The use of the expression \"as common law\" (\"de même que la common law\") in that sentence seems somewhat ambiguous to us (it being? like? ... common law). Considering as well that the decision related to a \"detailed statutory framework\", the comment is not very persuasive as justification for finding that federal common law exists. In Northern Telecom Canada Ltd. v. Canadian Union of Communications Workers, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 733, in which the Supreme Court alluded to \"federal common law\", it expressly followed (see para. 15) Quebec North Shore Paper Co. v. Canadian Pacific Ltd., supra, footnote 120.\n\n[123a] Two remarks must be made on this point. First, in Quebec North Shore Paper Co. v. Canadian Pacific Ltd., supra, footnote 120, Laskin J. wrote that Parliament cannot amend or repeal provincial laws that it has not first adopted or enacted. In our view, the reference to \"provincial laws\", in a discussion of civil law, does not invalidate our reasoning regarding pre-Confederation law. Essentially, the civil law of Quebec was pre-Confederation in origin, when that decision was written. Second, we would recall that Parliament does have the authority to amend or repeal certain provisions of pre-Confederation law that fall within its authority, under Section 129 of the Constitution Act, 1867. However, as we said earlier, supra, footnote 71, reception of pre-Confederation law into the federal legal system, as the residual general law, cannot be inferred from the authority granted there, given the way that Section is worded and the object of the provision.\n\n[124] To quote Wilson J. in Roberts v. Canada, supra, footnote 122, except in certain specific areas such as aboriginal title, there is no \"federal body of common law co-extensive with the federal legislature's unexercised legislative jurisdiction over the subject matters assigned to it\". The consequence of Quebec North Shore Paper Co. v. Canadian Pacific Ltd., supra, footnote 120, has been clearly understood by legal authors. See J.E.C. Brierley and R.A. Macdonald, op. cit., footnote 46, No. 44: \"Because it can only establish a general law by statute, there can be no federal judicially driven 'common law'.\" Cf. J.E.C. Brierley, loc. cit., footnote 77, p. 35, where the author concludes, more specifically with regard to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court: \"... there is no 'federal common law' arising in connection with the jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Canada ... .\" On the consequences of the absence of federal common law on the interaction between federal legislation and provincial private law, see J.-M. Brisson and A. Morel, loc. cit., footnote 90, p. 310. On the question of federal common law, see also France Allard, \"The Supreme Court of Canada and its Impact on the Expression of Bijuralism\", in The Harmonization of Federal Legislation with the Civil Law of the Province of Quebec and Canadian Bijuralism, Second Publication, Ottawa, Department of Justice Canada, 2001, Booklet 3, pp. 25-26; and Louis Lebel and Pierre-Louis Le Saunier, \"L'interaction du droit civil et de la common law a la Cour suprême du Canada\" (2006), 47 C. de D. 179, 217-219. Note that they say that a [TRANSLATION] \"common law rule deriving from the legislation\" may apply where the legislation is silent, notwithstanding the absence of \"autonomous suppletive federal law\". That statement is consistent with the acknowledgment of the creation of \"unenacted law in the course of interpreting federal legislation\" as stated by Ruth Sullivan, \"The Challenges of Interpreting Multilingual, Multijural Legislation\" (2004), 29 Brook. J. Int'l. L. 985, 1042. We will return (infra, footnotes 231 to 233) to the argument that narrower concept of the federal common law.\n\n[125] The reservation is stated by R. Sullivan, loc. cit., footnote 124, p. 1042 (footnote 246). Assuming there is a federal common law that is a general source of private law, is it conceivable that the Federal Court would be unable to apply it when other courts could?\n\n[126] J.-M. Brisson, loc. cit., footnote 112, p. 298: [TRANSLATION] \"There therefore cannot be, in private law, an unwritten federal common law.\" Note, however, that federal legislation may contain formal incorporation or reference provisions in certain defined cases. See, for example, s. 32, Crown Liability and Proceedings Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-50; s. 88, Indian Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-5; s. 9, Bills of Exchange Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-4.\n\n[127] See 2747-3174 Quebec Inc. v. Quebec (Régie des permis d'alcool), [1996] 3 S.C.R. 919. In that decision, in separate reasons, L'Heureux-Dubé J. described the Civil Code as the background canvas of the civil law in its entirety, as she described the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms as the basic fabric in the case of statute law or the common law. She adopted the image of the Civil Code as a unified representation of the civil law from J.E.C. Brierley and R.A. Macdonald, op. cit., footnote 46, No. 87: \"It is in this theoretical rather than empirical sense that a Code can claim to be a gapless presentation of the basic fabric of the Civil law.\"\n\n[128] When seen this way, the law is then found in its unwritten dimension, that is, its unenacted (for the civil law) or undiscovered (for the common law) dimension, as a virtual resource that lies outside the positive law. Superimposed on it are the fundamental principles that underlie public law and private law. For a demonstration of fundamental private law at the federal level, see the essay by R.A. Macdonald, loc. cit., footnote 69. Professor Macdonald discusses the concepts of the general law as unenacted law (\"common law\") and as fundamental law (\"jus commune\"), and also a third concept, suppletive law. The concept of \"jus commune\" is particularly appropriate here. In utilitarian terms, it could be described as a \"reservoir of legal concepts and rules\" or a \"dictionary of private law terms\", and in substantive terms, as the \"general juristic foundation and conceptual reference point for later substantive legal development, and a compass for the discovery of other, implicit principles of the private law.\" Professor Macdonald concludes, relying primarily on s. 129 of the Constitution Act, 1867, that there is a federal jus commune, in the utilitarian sense, which manifests itself, in Quebec, primarily in the pre-Confederation law in the Civil Code of Lower Canada, in terms of its unwritten substance (\"substantive conceptual referent\"), and an implied, general residual law to which provincial private law, for example the new Civil Code of Quebec, can contribute as suppletive law (paras. 41-52, 67-69). On that point, note that Professor Macdonald questions, in passing (paras. 39-40), the decisions in Quebec North Shore Paper Co. v. Canadian Pacific Ltd., supra, footnote 120, and McNamara Construction (Western) Ltd. v. The Queen, supra, footnote 120. Note also that Professor Macdonald's thesis has been contradicted on a crucial point (discussed supra, footnotes 71 et seq.), the reception of pre-Confederation law into the federal legal system: see J. Leclair, loc. cit., footnote 68. It should also be noted that this theory of a Canadian civil law based on the pre-Confederation Civil Code of Lower Canada (see para. 71) now appears to have been contradicted by the repeal of the provisions of that Code by Parliament in the Federal Law-Civil Law Harmonization Act No. 1, supra, footnote 106, s. 3, \"in so far as they relate to subjects that fall within the legislative competence of Parliament and have not been expressly repealed\" (cf. s. 129, Constitution Act, 1867).\n\n[129] We would even say supra-national. See H.P. Glenn, loc. cit., footnote 108, p. 348: [TRANSLATION] \"To talk about general principles is therefore to talk about a suppletive general law, drawn from multiple sources, that operates, where necessary, to supplement local or regional law.\"\n\n[130] This argument was discussed supra, footnote 124, and we will return to the subject infra, footnotes 231 to 233.\n\n[131] On the question of \"Canadian civil law\", see R.A. Macdonald, loc. cit., footnote 69. See also Nicholas Kasirer, \"Qu'est-ce que le 'droit civil canadien'?\", preface by Paul A. Crepeau, La réforme du droit civil canadien: une certaine conception de la recodification, 1965-1977, Quebec Research Centre of Private and Comparative Law, Montreal, Éditions Thémis, 2003, p. xv: [TRANSLATION] \"In the federal context, bijuralism is then not simply the passive coexistence of the two traditions; the two are in fact related. We might propose a vision of bijuralism in which the traditions look to each other and inform each other, as in the case of legal bilingualism\" (p. xviii). For an illustration of this ideal perspective, in the case of marriage, see P.A. Crepeau, id., pp. 39-40. There are studies or commentaries available now on the phenomenon of convergence and \"dialogue\" between the legal traditions: Michel Bastarache, \"Bijuralism in Canada\", in The Harmonization of Federal Legislation with the Civil Law of the Province of Quebec and Canadian Bijuralism, Second Publication, Ottawa, Department of Justice Canada, 2001, Booklet 1, 19, at p. 26.

Note, in particular, the subtle conclusions in the study by Lebel J. and Le Saunier, p. 238: [TRANSLATION] \"A study of the case law shows that the positive law rules, the common law and civil law traditions, the scheme of the legal systems in issue and certain methodological aspects continue to limit the creation of a relationship of true convergence.\" On a more sociological level, such obstacles to convergence are admirably explained in Jean-Francois Gaudreault-Desbiens, Les solitudes du bijuridisme au Canada, Éditions Thémis, 2007. We will return to the question of convergence and bijuralism, infra, footnote 232.\n\n[132] J.E.C. Brierley, loc. cit., footnote 77, p. 22: \"Bijuralism (bijuridisme) in Canada signifies the coexistence of the English Common law and the French Civil law traditions within a country organized along federal lines.\"\n\n[133] The bijural nature of federal private law is recognized in s. 8.1 of the Interpretation Act: \"Both the common law and the civil law are equally authoritative and recognized sources of the law of property and civil rights in Canada ... .\"\n\n[134] For a fundamental article illustrating this, with numerous examples drawn from the corpus of federal legislation, see J.-M. Brisson, loc. cit., footnote 89. After doing an exhaustive review of federal legislation, Brisson states: [TRANSLATION]: \"Although not all federal legislation is private law, virtually all involves private law concepts, in a general way and without defining them\" (p. 346). When the program to harmonize federal legislation with civil law was announced, 300 acts in the Revised Statutes of Canada were identified that called for in-depth examination, along with about 30 acts in each year of the annual statutes. See Mario Dion, \"Harmonization of Federal Law with Quebec Civil Law: Canadian Bijuralism and its Actualization\", in The Harmonization of Federal Legislation with the Civil Law of the Province of Quebec and Canadian Bijuralism, Second Publication, Ottawa, Department of Justice Canada, 2001, Booklet 1, 27, at p. 29.\n\n[135] J.-M. Brisson and A. Morel, loc. cit., footnote 90.\n\n[136] supra, footnote 89.\n\n[137] The subject is one that had been talked about long before it was studied and systematically analyzed. See, for example, Andrée Lajoie, Expropriation et fédéralisme au Canada, Montréal, Presses de l'Université de Montréal, 1972, p. 11.\n\n[138] Section 8.1. The Federal Court of Appeal delivered a very important and well-documented decision on the question of complementarity in St-Hilaire v. Canada (Attorney General), [2001] 4 F.C. 289. See also 9041-6868 Quebec Inc. v. Canada (M.N.R.), (2005) FCA 334. In the Supreme Court of Canada, see Peoples Department Stores Inc. (Trustee of) v. Wise, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 461, para. 29; D.I.M.S. Construction Inc. (Trustee of) v. Quebec (Attorney General), [2005] 2 S.C.R. 564, para. 34. In the Quebec Court of Appeal, see W.(D.) v. G.(A.), [2003] R.J.Q. 1411; (2003) CanLII 47442 (Que. C.A.), para. 27; Greenberg v. Gruber (May 27 , 2004), Montreal 500-09-014103048 (C.A.), paras. 24 et seq. In the Quebec Superior Court, see, in particular, G. (R.) v. A. (L.) (April 18, 2000), Montreal 500-12-123540-837 (S.C.). With respect to the Supreme Court's decision in D.I.M.S., see the following commentary: Philippe Denault, \"D.I.M.S. Construction Inc. (Syndic de) v. Quebec (Procureur général): La fin d'une controverse - Mise en oeuvre du principe de complementarité par la Cour suprÃªme du Canada\" (2006), 27 R.P.F.S. 235.\n\n[139] J.-M. Brisson and A. Morel, loc. cit., footnote 90, p. 299. They state that \"dissociation\" exists when the federal legislation \"derogates from\" (we would say \"exempts itself from\") the provincial law that applies as suppletive law.\n\n[140] See, for example, the definition of \"liability\" in the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act, supra, footnote 126, s. 2; the definition of \"immovable\" in the Federal Real Property and Federal Immovables Act, 1991, c. 50, s. 2; the definition of \"secured creditor\" in the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3, s. 2.\n\n[141] See supra, Section I.A.1. J.-M. Brisson and A. Morel, loc. cit., footnote 90, pp. 309-310 note the absence of federal common law, primarily because the federal level did not \"receive\" fundamental law under s. 129 of the Constitution Act, 1867.\n\n[142] They also refer to \"indirect references\" (id., p. 308), on which we will not comment, but that essentially refers to situations where it is common law rather than statute law that effects the reference to provincial private law (for example, in the case of contracts by the federal Crown). On the theory of the implicit dependency of federal legislation, see the premises that J.-M. Brisson, loc. cit., footnote 89, was the first to state.\n\n[143] J.-M. Brisson and A. Morel, loc. cit., footnote 90, p. 309. It will be noted here that the authors refer to the \"two legal systems in force\", that is, the civil law and the common law. They base their approach on the traditions, thus asserting that the common law provinces share a single common law. However, they acknowledge the differences between the various provinces' private law: [TRANSLATION] \"It is sometimes forgotten that these provinces' private law, with which federal statutes' relationship is one of dependency, is not uniform and varies from province to province, despite the fact that they share a single common law.\" (id., p. 299).\n\n[144] Id., pp. 316-317.\n\n[145] Id., p. 317 et seq. and 323 et seq. Note that it is the provision (the \"question\") that is characterized as private law or public law, not the entire context of the legislation: id., pp. 309 and 320. See also, on this point, St-Hilaire v. Canada (Attorney General), supra, footnote 138, para. 93. Cf. Travel Just v. Canada, 2006 FCA 343. We will return to the private law / public law distinction, in terms of the logical sequence of interpretation (infra, footnote 207). For an example of complementarity in a context involving public law and unenacted law, and more specifically in relation to contracts and liability, see Canada v. Monit International Inc., 2004 FCA 335 (F.C.A.). For analyses illustrating the complex relationship between federal law and provincial private law, see, for example: D.I.M.S. Construction Inc. (Trustee of) v. Quebec (Attorney General), supra, footnote 138; Newcourt Financial Ltd. v. Canada, 2004 FCA 91.\n\n[146] Id., p. 300: [TRANSLATION] \"To say that federal legislation is not autonomous means simply that taken in isolation, it does not express the totality of the law that applies in matters within the legislative authority of Parliament.\"\n\n[147] Id., p. 298: [TRANSLATION] \"... the relationship between the civil law and federal legislation is entirely analogous to the relationship between Quebec legislation and the Civil Code.\" On the suppletive role of the Civil Code of Quebec as jus commune or common law, see, inter alia, Dore v. Verdun (City), [1997] 2 S.C.R. 862, para. 16. For an example dealing with civil procedure, see Lac d'Amiante du Quebec Ltee v. 2858-0702 Quebec Inc., [2001] 2 S.C.R. 753, para. 40. See also, in the literature: A.-F. Bisson, loc. cit., footnote 113; J.M.-Brisson, loc. cit., footnote 112.\n\n[148] The sharpest criticism of applying the principle of complementarity in interpreting federal legislation, in particular to harmonize it with Quebec civil law, comes from Ruth Sullivan, \"The Challenges of Interpreting Multilingual, Multijural Legislation\" (2004), 29 Brook. J. Int'l. L. 985. Sullivan (pp. 1024-1025) contrasts an approach based on dialogue and integration (\"Derivative Bijuralism\") with an approach based on the complementarity of federal and provincial sources (\"Suppletive Bijuralism\"). She criticizes the \"complementarity\" approach, essentially arguing that this is a civil law approach to interpretation (\"a Civilist coup\", p. 1027, referring to the literature in which the issue has been examined). She states that it is based on premises that are incorrect in terms of the common law: \"For example, the notion of a pre-existing, self-contained and coherent jus commune, which lies at the heart of the Harmonization Program, is a civilist notion\" (p. 1027, footnote 197; p. 1041). Moreover, in her view, the implied dependency of federal legislation, and reference to the provincial common law as suppletive law, is an inadequate (although correct) analysis, for the following two reasons (p. 1030): the analysis (i) ignores the complementary role of judicial interpretation, and (ii) implies that any derogation from provincial private law is an anomaly. We will return to the first reason in the next Section (I.B.). Suffice it to say, for now, that the second reason seems to arise from a misunderstanding. We note, first, that her view is confined to interpretation and does not take into consideration the historical and constitutional premises considered by Brisson and Morel. The implied dependency of federal law in relation to property and civil rights is rooted in historical continuity and the division of powers, which assigned common law rules, and jurisdiction in principle in respect of private law, to the provinces. Second, it seems that Sullivan is mistaken when she fails to discern in the thinking of Brisson and Morel that the principle of complementarity is analyzed by analogy with the preliminary provision of the Civil Code of Quebec. By failing to see that this is an analogy, she conflates the concept of a civil code (\"pre-existing, self-contained and coherent\") with the broader concept of common law (jus commune). To say that this concept of \"common law\" (which, admittedly, is used in a specific sense in the preliminary provision) is unknown to the common law is to deny the universal meaning of the concept of common law as a model of suppletive law (see H.P. Glenn, op. cit., footnote 111) and the fact that this concept is also found as a model in the common law tradition (see Ruth Sullivan, Sullivan and Driedger on the Construction of Statutes, 4th ed., Toronto, Butterworths, 2002, p. 342). This is undoubtedly why Sullivan ultimately relies on a theoretical and speculative concept of \"unenacted law\" (p. 1042), which seems to serve as a reservoir, or suppletive law, from this common law perspective based primarily on the courts, just as provincial law does from the perspective of complementarity (with respect to the jus commune as [TRANSLATION] \"fierce enemy of common law jurists\", see H.P. Glenn, loc. cit., footnote 108, p. 341). In our opinion, therefore, what is important is that provincial private law plays a suppletive role because of the jurisdiction in principle of the provinces in relation to property and civil rights. The premise adopted in Sullivan's critique, the idea that complementarity brings in provincial private law as \"common law\" in respect of federal legislation in the same way that the Civil Code is placed in an organic relationship with the statutes of Quebec, seems to us to be incorrect (p. 1042: \"[The principle of complementarity] asserts that the suppletive law must be the jus commune of the province.\"). We will return, in the next Section (I.B), to the relationship between statute law and jus commune and the \"derivative bijuralism\" theory.\n\n[149] Contra: Nicholas Kasirer (ed.), op. cit., footnote 83, vo. \"droit commun\" (see Rem. 4). Note that the dictionary clearly distinguishes between droit commun and suppletive law (see Rem. 5. and vo. \"Droit suppletive / Suppletive law\"). While that seems correct to us, it is not correct to think that the expression \"droit supplétif\" [\"law that completes federal legislation\"] is used \"incorrectly\" in the preamble to the Federal Law-Civil Law Harmonization Act, No. 1, supra, footnote 106.\n\n[150] Otherwise, it would have to be assumed that provincial common law applies as federal general law, an argument we refuted in the previous Section (I.A.).\n\n[151] supra, footnote 111. H.P. Glenn, loc. cit., footnote 108, p. 342: [TRANSLATION] \"The law that is common must be identified, by the word \"common\", to distinguish it from the other, different kinds of law that apply within the same territory.\"\n\n[152] The word \"commun\" comes from the Latin communis: \"qui appartient à tous\" (Le nouveau petit Robert, Dictionnaire alphabétique et analogique de la langue française, Josette Rey-Debove and Alain Rey (eds.), Paris, Dictionnaires Le Robert, 2003.) [In English, \"common\": \"belonging to, open to, or affecting, the whole community or the public\" (The Concise Oxford Dictionary) - Tr.]\n\n[153] The expression is used in s. 8.1 of the Interpretation Act, in reference to the application of provincial law as suppletive law: \"... unless otherwise provided by law, . reference must be made to the rules, principles and concepts in force in the province .\".\n\n[154] S. 8.1 of the Interpretation Act is even more precise; it uses the expression used in the Constitution Act, 1867 to refer to private law: \"the law of property and civil rights\".\n\n[155] We would note that there is no requirement for uniformity in federal law (supra, footnote 72); see F. Chevrette and H. Marx, op. cit., footnote 10, 868: [TRANSLATION]] \"... at the federal level, unenacted law is not a single corpus of law ...\". See also J.-M. Brisson and A. Morel, loc. cit., footnote 90, 332: [TRANSLATION] \"... federal private law legislation is, as a rule, merely a part of a whole, the rest of which is under provincial jurisdiction ... .\" Here we are looking at acceptance of a decentralized federalism in respect of private law, an original prerequisite of the Canadian federation (supra, footnote 76) that is fundamentally positive, if we are to recognize the general virtues of bijuralism. On this point, see Stephane Dion, \"Notes for an Address - Symposium on the Harmonization of Federal Legislation with Quebec Civil Law\", in The Harmonization of Federal Legislation with the Civil Law of the Province of Quebec and Canadian Bijuralism, Second Publication, Ottawa, Department of Justice Canada, 2001, Booklet 1, 1, at p. 4: \"We have long known that the unity of the state does not necessarily go hand in hand with uniformity of legislation. ... If there is one country that knows that equality is not synonymous with uniformity, it is certainly ours.\" See also Michel Bastarache, \"Bijuralism in Canada\", in The Harmonization of Federal Legislation with the Civil Law of the Province of Quebec and Canadian Bijuralism, Second Publication, Ottawa, Department of Justice Canada, 2001, Booklet 1, 18, at p. 23: \"While civil law and common law complement the private law provisions of federal legislation, at the same time, federal legislation should not be applied uniformly throughout the country in every respect.\"\n\n[156] supra, footnote 145.\n\n[157] Henry L. Molot, \"Clause 8 of Bill S-4: Amending the Interpretation Act\", in The Harmonization of Federal Legislation with the Civil Law of the Province of Quebec and Canadian Bijuralism, Second Publication, Ottawa, Department of Justice Canada, 2001, Booklet 6, p. 1. The author also uses the expression \"sealed off\", for example in this statement: \"But federal enactments are not sealed off entirely from provincial law.\"\n\n[158] id. The word \"bridge\" is used by Molot at p. 11. On the question of the importance of the concepts and language in establishing these implicit references, see at p. 5 (and at p. 10): \"How is provincial law incorporated into or made to apply to the interpretation of federal legislation ? In a sense, in applying or interpreting federal legislation a common law or civil law lawyer or judge may be required to \"think outside\" his or her normal professional range of experience. As illustrated by some of the examples described above, that cerebral process depends principally on legal concepts and language.\"\n\n[159] The expression has been adopted in the context of harmonization of federal legislation. See André Morel, \"Methodology and Work Plan - Final Report\", in The Harmonization of Federal Legislation with the Civil Law of the Province of Quebec and Canadian Bijuralism: Collection of Studies, Ottawa, Department of Justice Canada, 1997, 265, at p. 269-270; Louise Maguire Wellington, \"Bijuralism in Canada: Harmonization Methodology and Harmonization\", in The Harmonization of Federal Legislation with the Civil Law of the Province of Quebec and Canadian Bijuralism, Second Publication, Ottawa, Department of Justice Canada, 2001, Booklet 4, at pp. 6 et seq. It had been used earlier in Policy for Applying the Civil Code of Quebec to Federal Government Activities, Department of Justice Canada (June 7, 1993), published in The Harmonization of Federal Legislation with the Civil Law of the Province of Quebec and Canadian Bijuralism, Second Publication, Ottawa, Department of Justice Canada, 2001, Booklet 4, Appendix I.\n\n[160] The Department of Justice Canada Policy on Legislative Bijuralism (1995) uses the expression \"touches on\" to describe the interaction between federal legislation and provincial law: \"... b) will undertake, in drafting both versions of every bill and proposed regulation that touches on provincial or territorial private law, to take care to reflect the terminology, concepts, notions and institutions of both of Canada's private law systems\" (emphases added). The Policy is published in The Harmonization of Federal Legislation with the Civil Law of the Province of Quebec and Canadian Bijuralism, Second Publication, Ottawa, Department of Justice Canada, 2001, Booklet 4, Appendix III.\n\n[161] On the question of the objectives of the initiative to review and harmonize federal legislation, see Andre Morel, \"Harmonizing Federal Legislation with the Civil Code of Quebec: Why and Wherefore?\" and \"Drafting Bilingual Statutes Harmonized with the Civil Law\", in The Harmonization of Federal Legislation with the Civil Law of the Province of Quebec and Canadian Bijuralism: Collection of Studies, Ottawa, Department of Justice Canada, 1997, 1 and 309 respectively. See, generally, the papers published in Booklet 1 of The Harmonization of Federal Legislation with the Civil Law of the Province of Quebec and Canadian Bijuralism, Second Publication, Ottawa, Department of Justice Canada, 2001. For the results of the harmonization work, see, in particular, the \"Laws\" page at the following Internet site: https://canada.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/harmonization/bijurilex/harmonization-loisdharmonisation.html. See also, more recently, L. Perret, loc. cit., footnote 47, where the author describes the historical context of the harmonization program and some economic considerations relating to the convergence of the legal systems.\n\n[162] For an historical review and an overview of the issues in relation to the drafting of federal legislation, see Lionel Levert, \"Bilingual and Bijural Legislative Drafting: To Be or Not To Be?\", (2004) 25 Stat. L. Rev. 151. See also Policy for Applying the Civil Code of Quebec to Federal Government Activities (June 7, 1993), supra, footnote 159.\n\n[163] The preamble to the Harmonization Act, No. 1, supra, footnote 106, refers to the \"unique character of Quebec society\". See also, on this point, the commentary by S. Dion, loc. cit., footnote 155, 2, regarding the resolutions adopted by the two chambers of Parliament in 1995 to recognize that the distinct character of Quebec includes the civil law tradition. See Government Motion on the Distinct Society, House of Commons, Debates, 1st Session, 35th Parliament, November 29 and December 11, 1995; 995; Quebec: Motion for Recognition as Distinct Society, Senate, Debates, 1st Session, 35th Parliament, December 7 and 14, 1995.\n\n[164] The word is taken from Jean Leclair, loc. cit., footnote 87.\n\n[165] The \"signposts\" image is also used: Aline Grenon, \"The Interpretation of Bijural or Harmonized Federal Legislation: Schreiber v. Canada (A.G.)\" (2005), 84 Can. Bar Rev. 132, at p. 146. The comment was also made regarding \"doublets\". On that drafting technique, see L. Maguire Wellington, loc. cit., footnote 159 and Schreiber v. Canada (Attorney General), [2002] 3 S.C.R. 269. On the importance of terminology in creating references, see s. 8.2 of the Interpretation Act. The case law is replete with examples in which an expression has led to the application of provincial law. See, for example, Decary J. in St-Hilaire v. Canada (Attorney General), supra, footnote 138, para. 93: \"I do not think there can be any doubt that this part of the Act, which refers to 'succession' without defining it, should be interpreted in Quebec in light of the civil law.\" See also: \"personal or bodily injury\", in Schreiber v. Canada (Attorney General), supra, footnote 165; \"diligence\", in Peoples Department Stores Inc. (Trustee of) v. Wise, supra, footnote 138; \"beneficially owned / droit de beneficiaire\", in Canada (A.G.) v. National Bank of Canada, (2004) FCA 92 and Newcourt Financial Ltd. v. Canada, supra, footnote 145; \"contract of service\", in 9041-6868 Quebec Inc. v. Canada (M.N.R.), supra, footnote 138; \"devolution / vesting\", in Lefebvre (Trustee of); Tremblay (Trustee of), [2004] 3 S.C.R. 326; \"compensation\", in D.I.M.S. Construction Inc. (Trustee of) v. Quebec (Attorney General), supra, footnote 138; \"seize and detain\", in Canada 3000 Inc., Re; Inter-Canadian (1991) Inc. (Trustee of), (2006) SCC 24; \"payment\", in Commission de la Construction du Quebec v. Canada (M.N.R.), 2006 FCA 49 (F.C.A.); \"mandate\", in Factums Instanter, S.E.N.C. v. Canada, 2006 TCC 53. Note the clarification by the Federal Court of Appeal regarding reference to private law concepts: Royal Winnipeg Ballet v. Canada (M.R.N.), 2006 FCA 87 (F.C.A.).\n\n[166] P.-A. Cote, op. cit., footnote 33, p. 94: [TRANSLATION] \"A reference occurs when a provision of an enactment expressly requires that the reader refer to another text.\" See also John Mark Keyes, \"Incorporation by Reference in Legislation\" (2004), 25 Stat. L. Rev. 180, at p. 182 in particular. Concerning incorporation by reference, delegation of powers and cooperation in relation to federalism, see, in particular, R. v. Furtney, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 89 and Elmer A. Driedger, \"The Interaction of Federal and Provincial Laws\" (1976), 54 Can. Bar Rev. 694, at p. 712: \"A statute incorporating future laws of another jurisdiction must be carefully worded, lest it be struck down as an attempt at delegation.\" Concerning regulations, see Jacques Desjardins and Josee Legault, \"L'incorporation par renvoi dans l'exercice du pouvoir reglementaire a l'echelon federal\" (1991), 70 Can. Bar Rev. 244.\n\n[167] S. 8.1, Interpretation Act. Concerning the crucial role of interpretation, see H. Molot, loc. cit., footnote 157, and the quotation at footnote 158. For examples of confusion between categories in interpretation, see first an approach that mixes the ordinary meaning with the complementarity of provincial law in Schreiber v. Canada (Attorney General), supra, footnote 165 (we will return to this, infra, footnote 198 and Part II.A.3(a)). At the other extreme, and a much more intuitive level, see how a judge of the Court of Quebec relied on s. 8.2 of the Interpretation Act to determine the meaning of the word \"reputé\" (deemed) in the Youth Criminal Justice Act: Spenard v. Promotuel Bois-Francs (August 29, 2005), Arthabaska 415-32003671-040 (C.Q. Small Claims). A similar haste can be seen in a decision concerning the concept of interest in the Interest Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21, in relation to the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, L.R.Q., c. P-40.1: Blanchette v. Corporation Credit Trans Canada (May 17, 2004), Montreal 500-06-000187-027 (S.C.). And see how a judge of the Tax Court of Canada refers to the civil law, citing s. 8.1 of the Interpretation Act, to examine the concept of \"life income fund\" (!): Letarte v. The Queen, 2005 TCC 420, para. 11. Concerning the difficulty of classifying these concepts, see infra, footnote 198.\n\n[168] Concerning the \"neutral terms\" technique, that is, the use of terms or phrases \"that have no particular connection to either of the two legal systems in Canada\", see Lionel Levert, \"The cohabitation of Bilingualism and Bijuralism in Federal Legislation in Canada: Myth or Reality?\", in The Harmonization of Federal Legislation with the Civil Law of the Province of Quebec and Canadian Bijuralism, Second Publication, Ottawa, Department of Justice Canada, 2001, Booklet 1, p. 7-8. Concerning the use of the concept of incorporation in this context, see Peoples Department Stores Inc. (Trustee of) v. Wise, supra, footnote 138. That decision uses the term \"incorporation\" to describe the (backward) interaction of the Civil Code of Quebec with the Canada Business Corporations Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-44. In our view, there is unfortunately some confusion in the use of the concept, as compared with the case of implicit dependency: see H. Molot, loc. cit., footnote 157, p. 5; the Hon. Michel Bastarache, \"Les difficultes relatives a la determination de l'intention legislative dans le contexte du bijuridisme et du bilinguisme legislatif canadien\", in Jean-Claude Gemar and Nicholas Kasirer (eds.), Jurilinguistics: Between Law and Language / Jurilinguistique: entre langues et droits, Paris, Éditions juridiques Bruylant / Montreal, Éditions Thémis, 2003, 95, at p. 110.\n\n[169] These cases appear to be simply the exception: J.-M. Brisson and A. Morel, loc. cit., footnote 90, 328-329. For reference to unenacted law as a suppletive source of federal private law, see R. Sullivan, loc. cit., note 148. Sullivan favours an approached based on \"derivative bijuralism\". We will return to this in the next Section (I.B).\n\n[170] On the various meanings of the word \"interpretation\", see P-A. Cote, op. cit., footnote 33, p. 4-5. We primarily adopt the second meaning identified by Professor Cote: [TRANSLATION] \"A second and more limited meaning of the term interpretation does not refer to the entire process of determining the meaning and scope of the legal rules set out in an enactment; rather, it refers to that process only where it requires a particular effort of the reader, made necessary by the presence of something that is obscure and must be clarified.\" For a \"unified theory\" based on the concepts of \"vagueness\", \"ambiguity\", \"subtext\" and \"analogy\", see Randal N. Graham, Statutory Interpretation. Theory and Practice, Toronto, Montgomery Publications, 2001.\n\n[171] Richard Tremblay, L'essentiel de l'interprétation des lois, Cowansville, Quebec, Éditions Yvon Blais, 2004, p. 48. See pp. 52 et seq. for [TRANSLATION] \"particularly important\" principles, as Tremblay puts it. The surveys done in the literature are not themselves definitive, even though there is no reluctance on the part of the authors to advance them, sometimes for academic reasons. Concerning \"Ilbert's Rules\", by Louis-Philippe Pigeon, op. cit., footnote 77, pp. 93 et seq., see the commentary by Alain-Francois Bisson, \"L'interpretation adequate des lois\", in E. Caparros (ed.), Melanges Louis-Philippe Pigeon, Montreal, Wilson & Lafleur, 1989, p. 89, at p. 91.\n\n[172] An \"holistic\" approach to interpretation, as compared to the judicious and ultimately necessary use of maxims of interpretation, is cautioned against by Randal N. Graham, op. cit., footnote 170, p. 110.\n\n[173] Heading preceding s. 8.1: \"Rules of Construction / regles d'interpretation\". Professor P.-A. Cote, op. cit., footnote 33, p. 48 et seq., notes that the principles may be regarded as \"guides\" or \"arguments\". See also Alain-Francois Bisson, loc. cit., footnote 171, at p. 92, who refers to them as [TRANSLATION] \"useful tools\".\n\n[174] The line between \"intention\" and \"object\" is not a clean one, and the first appears to include the second. However, it seems relatively clear that intention refers to what is originally desired or sought, and object refers specifically to an end result. See P.-A. Cote, op. cit., footnote 33, concerning the concept of the intention of Parliament: [TRANSLATION] \"Particular note must be made of the ambiguity of the expression. It refers both to the meaning that the author of the text intended to give it and to the practical objective of the author in enacting the text \" (p. 7); \"... it refers both to what Parliament intended to mean by the text enacted and to what it intended to accomplish by enacting it\" (p. 476; emphasis added). Concerning the object as end result, we need only refer here to the etymological meaning: \"'objectum' ce qui est place devant\" (Le Petit Robert) [\"object\": thing sought or aimed at (Concise Oxford Dictionary) - Tr.]\n\n[175] Driedger's formula is an excellent example of the persuasive force, perhaps even normative authority, of the legal literature. It has been described as the method \"preferred\" by the Supreme Court in Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27. The Court quotes Elmer Driedger, Construction of Statutes, 2nd ed., Toronto, Butterworths, 1983, p. 87. That formula has been cited by the Court on many occasions. See, for example, again per Iacobucci J., Bell Express Vu Limited Partnership v. Rex, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559. More recently, Canada 3000 Inc., R"
