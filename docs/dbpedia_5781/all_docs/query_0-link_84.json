        "text": "A computer-generated reboot of Rugrats has been dubbed “f***ing horrifying”.\n\nThe classic animated series, which was broadcast on Nickelodeon in the 1990s and spawned a series of films, will be revived for the new US streaming service Paramount+.\n\nThe show’s original voice cast will return for the new series, which revolves around a group of talking babies.\n\n“Rugrats is one of the most iconic cartoons recognized by fans around the globe, and this original version is one we are taking great care and pride in creating for a brand-new audience,” said Ramsey Naito, president of Nickelodeon Animation.\n\nThe first clip from the revival has been met with mixed reviews from Twitter users.\n\nRead more: Paramount+ confirms Frasier reboot starring Kelsey Grammer\n\n“This looks f***ing horrifying,” tweeted one person. “My eyes burn just looking at this!” wrote another.\n\nOthers pledged to watch the revival, despite misgivings about the move away from the hand-drawn animation of the original series.\n\n“I think this animation looks like s*** but I’ll probably watch every second of it,” wrote one fan.\n\nThe new Rugrats joins a host of reboots and movie spin-offs announced by Paramount+.\n\nA revival of Frasier starring Kelsey Grammer will debut on the service, along with TV series inspired by Fatal Attraction, Flashdance and The Italian Job.\n\nThere will also be live-action versions of children’s animated series Dora the Explorer and Fairly Odd Parents, a revival of the sketch series Inside Amy Schumer and an animated Star Trek spin-off.\n\nParamount+ will launch in the US on 4 March."
