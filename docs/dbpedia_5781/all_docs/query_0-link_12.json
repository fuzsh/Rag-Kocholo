        "text": "FOUR babies are sitting in a playpen, and 1-year-old Tommy Pickles is trying to persuade his scaredy-cat pal Chuckie to jump the fence in search of adventure. ''Someday you'll be 6 years old,'' Tommy says with his usual bravado. ''Do you want to look back then and say you never really lived?''\n\nAs most American parents of young children know, Tommy and Chuckie are the heroes of ''Rugrats,'' the animated Nickelodeon series that is the most popular television show among children 2 to 11, according to Nielsen Media Research provided by Nickelodeon. Created to appeal across the board to young and old children as well as families, it is a quirkily drawn show that describes the world from a child's-eye-view, a vantage that is often uncomprehending but always slyly observant. Along the way, the show makes good-natured but biting fun of career-obsessed working moms, daydreaming dads, cranky grandparents and our media-driven consumer culture.\n\n''Rugrats'' has catapulted Nickelodeon to its current dominance of children's television. Its premiere made a decent showing in 1991, just as the 11-year-old channel was gaining a foothold; when it later went into daily reruns, its ratings jumped, much to the surprise of network executives. In contrast to quick-burning kiddie crazes like ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' and ''Goosebumps,'' ''Rugrats'' shows remarkable staying power; after seven seasons, ratings are higher than ever. Nickelodeon deals its ace as often as possible: the series is shown weekdays at 8:30 A.M. and 7:30 P.M, Saturdays at 8 P.M. and Sundays at 10 A.M. A dozen or more episodes routinely place in the top-50-cable-shows rankings each week, helping make Nickelodeon the nation's top-rated basic cable network.Inevitably, the series has developed all the trappings of a full-fledged, cash-spouting franchise: everything from T-shirts to toothpaste, a touring stage show, a daily comic strip and, in November, a feature film, which is already generating heavy playground buzz.\n\n''It's reached a kind of phenomenon status,'' says Nickelodeon's president, Herb Scannell. ''We think in some ways this is our Mickey Mouse.''"
