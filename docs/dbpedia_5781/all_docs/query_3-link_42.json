        "text": "Rugrats\n\nformerly Polliwogs\n\nRudgear Rugrats is a fun and exciting program designed for beginning swimmers who are not quite ready for swim team. We works with swimmers as young as four years old. It is a non-competitive skill-building program, designed for group instruction with an approximate ratio of three Rugrats to one coach (however, we aim for a closer to a 1:1 ratio, so swimmers can have the most personalized instruction possible). Rugrat coaches are in the water at all times and are trained and supervised by the Rudgear head coach.\n\nThe goal of the program is for Rugrats to be able to swim a lap of unassisted freestyle by the end of the season. We focus on freestyle and backstroke and move slowly in regard to stroke progression to make sure our Rugrats are learning the correct technique. We also want to help our swimmers feel comfortable in the water - in addition to learning strokes we help Rugrats learn to tread water, jump off the diving board, dive off the side of the pool, and spend time in the deep end. And, of course, we also focus on making this a FUN experience for the Rugrats!\n\nRugrats do not compete in meets, but they do have the option of swimming in the \"Rugrat Race\" during last home meet of the season, so the whole team can cheer them on!\n\nPre-Requisites\n\nSwimmer should be four years old by June 15. If younger, swimmers must meet all requirements and be approved by our Head Coach and Coach Liaison.\n\nSwimmer should be able to put their face in the water\n\nSwimmer should be able to swim approximately three feet unassisted away from the side of the pool to the coach\n\nSwimmer must be able to listen to instructions and follow directions\n\nSwimmer must be willing to work in the water with all the REST coaches, without having the parent nearby\n\nNOTE: In order to determine proper placement, alll Rugrats will be asked to participate in a water readiness/swimming assessment in the spring. The kids will be asked to swim for the coaches to assess their abilities and ensure water safety. If you think that your swimmer is not yet ready for Rugrats, please consider signing up for private lessons taught by our coaches.\n\nPractice Schedule\n\nJune 11-July 19, 2023\n\nMondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays\n\n12:00pm-12:30pm\n\nNo Rugrats on 6/21, 7/1, 7/4, 7/5\n\nWe will hold a graduation ceremony at the end of the season on their last day of practice, Friday, July 19th, to celebrate all their hard work. Rugrats are also invited to swim a \"race\" at our final home meet of the season (July 20).\n\nCost\n\n$250 per swimmer (plus additonal splash fee for non-HOA members)\n\nIt is Rudgear's goal for the Rugrats program to provide quality instruction while having a lot of fun and getting a taste of swim team!\n\nIf you have any questions regarding the Rugrat program, please contact the REST Coach Liaison at [email protected].\n\nClick here to register"
