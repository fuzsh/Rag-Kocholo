        "text": "The New Yorker, November 30, 1998 P. 60\n\nANNALS OF ANIMATION about \"Rugrats,\" a popular children's TV cartoon show. Arlene Klasky and her former husband, Gabor Csupo, are two of the most highly regarded animators in Hollywood, having helped to create the popular prime-time cartoon show \"The Simpsons\" and Nickelodeon's children's cartoon show \"Rugrats.\" \"Rugrats,\" which Klasky and Csupo developed with producer Paul Germain, is now the most popular children's TV cartoon show in the country; it has won 3 Daytime Emmy Awards, and \"The Rugrats Movie,\" a new film based on the show, has just opened. The show features exceptionally savvy kids (Tommy Pickles, a sweet 1-year-old; Chuckie, his 2-year-old neurotic friend; 1-year-old twins, Phil and Lil; and a 3-year-old bully named Angelica), oblivious parents, and knowing references to popular culture. The writer spoke with Klasky a few months ago in her office at Klasky Csupo, Inc., the animation studio she runs with Csupo. Klasky confessed that she never liked the popular character Angelica, because she thought the character was too mean. In the early shows, Angelica sued her parents, ran away from home, framed her friends for crimes she had committed, and terrorized innocents; her trademark line became \"You dumb babies!\" The writer describes how discord arose from the show's effort to be both cutting-edge and age-appropriate, and how the conflict over Angelica was responsible for the breakup of the original \"Rugrats\" creative team. The writer credits \"Rugrats\"'s popularity to the show's hip look and its jaded view of family life and consumer culture. In the first season, Angelica was mischief unchained. At the end of each episode, Angelica received her obligatory comeuppance, yet she remained unrepentant. \"Rugrats\" made Angelica's nastiness funny, and for Klasky that was a problem. Former \"Rugrats\" producer Paul Germain, who now works at Disney, got his start working for director/producer James L. Brooks, who helped develop the popular prime-time cartoon show \"The Simpsons.\" Germain brought in Klasky and Csupo to help develop \"The Simpsons.\" After it became a hit, German left Brooks to work as a development executive for Klasky Csupo. In 1989, Germain and Klasky pitched the idea for \"Rugrats\" to Nickelodeon. The writer describes the evolution of children's TV programming. Old cartoons used to work on several levels, but in the 1960s, studios came under pressure to tone down violence and \"adult\" behavior. The creators of the \"Rugrats\" wanted the show to be surprising and risky enough to get children's attention but safe enough so that parents felt comfortable with letting their children watch the show. But Angelica's incorrigibility soon became a problem. After its first year, \"Rugrats\" won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program, but tensions were escalating. In 1992, Csupo and Klasky's marriage collapsed, but they both continued to work on the show, with Csupo often mediating between his wife and the writing staff. As the show developed, Germain wanted to explore emotions and began encouraging adult-oriented \"Rugrats\" scripts, like the one which explained that the source of Angelica's brattiness was her self-absorbed parents. After her meanness was exposed as neediness, Angelica became a more complex character. In 1993, the tensions exploded and Germain and members of his writing team were kicked off the show. In 1994, Nickelodeon stopped running new episodes and the show went into syndication, which is when its popularity really exploded. Almost overnight, \"Rugrats\" became one of the most popular shows on cable, with 26 million viewers a week. Advertising and licensing deals took off, and in 1996, the show went back into production. In the new episodes of \"Rugrats,\" which reflect Klasky's concern about Angelica's \"cruelty,\" the edge has been softened with sentimentality. The writer describes the plot of the new \"Rugrat\" film and claims that children who once thrilled to Angelica's nasty schemes may be disappointed by her sentimental role."
