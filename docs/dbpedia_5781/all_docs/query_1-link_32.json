        "text": "When it comes to fan theories, you can always count on finding two types of theories for every franchise: everything is connected through time travel or everything was a hallucination. Yeah, the internet can be surprisingly predictable at times. However, when that level of methodical insanity is applied to children’s shows, the fan theory in question goes from interesting to childhood ruining. This brings me to Rugrats.\n\nRugrats is arguably the most iconic Nicktoon out there, focusing on the adventures of a group of bumbling babies. You know their names: Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, Lil, and Angelica. The show stayed on the air for nine seasons, so you bet that there were some baby additions thrown in there, which took the forms of Susie, Tommy’s unfortunately named brother Dil Pickles, and Kimi. The show had a long and memorable run, resulting in three movies and a spin off series that focused on the gang all grown up in high school. This is all to say that claiming this particular group of babies has been dead for over a decade is not something to be taken lightly.\n\nWHAT’S THE THEORY?\n\nAll those rugrats are actually dead and were figments of Angelica’s imagination. The only ones who were real are Susie, Kimi, and Dil, though the theory claims that the mentally unstable Angelica never actually met Kimi and that she was responsible for beating and ultimately crippling Dil. This theory has been predominantly credited to CreepyPasta, by the way, and has been around for a while.\n\nWHY IT’S NOT THAT CRAZY\n\nAnything that claims that Angelica is insane automatically falls in the realm of believable. Stop beating babies, Angelica, and read a book or something. However, the theory becomes a bit unnerving when it gets into how each baby’s characteristics supposedly represents their death.\n\nAccording to the theory, Tommy was a stillborn, which is why his dad, Stu Pickles, is constantly in the basement. He’s building toys for the son who never had a chance to live. Chuckie died several years ago with his mom, which would explain why his father is a nervous wreck all the time. As for the twins, the DeVilles got an abortion before knowing the sex of their child, so Angelica imagined both. But where does that leave our oppressive Cynthia lover through all of this?\n\nAllegedly, Angelica is schizophrenic and bipolar, which is why she imagined these non-existent babies to play with. This would most likely mean that a young Angelica heard several things she wasn’t ready to hear and reacted in the worst possible way, which is completely believable in the realm of this theory’s universe. This one also claims that Angelica’s mom died of a heroin overdose, and Angelica later became addicted to narcotics in her teenage years. That lapse into drug use resulted in the All Grown Up spin off series. So what happened when All Grown Up was cancelled? Angelica died, naturally.\n\nThere’s a lot of other messed up nonsense in this one that will haunt your childhood, including a longer explanation of the aforementioned Dil abuse and a really sad Chaz subplot that involves prostitutes. Basically, this theory claims that every moment of Rugrats was the happily imagined alternative of the worst life ever. Some people want to watch the world burn.\n\nWHY IT’S QUESTIONABLE\n\nThough it’s tempting to fall down the darkest internet conspiracy rabbit holes, this one falls apart pretty quickly. First of all, what are the chances that Nick would ever make something this dark, even if that darkness was a secret? This is the network that still pretends it didn’t create Invader Zim. It has a weird relationship with “edgy” content.\n\nBut you could argue that once media is released to the public, the creator’s intentionality becomes just as powerful as fan appreciation and interpretation. Fair enough, but the theory still unravels in this light. For this theory to work, Angelica’s creations wouldn’t be able to interact with “real” characters without Angelica being present. However, as this Reddit thread wonderfully points out, the “imagined” Tommy was the first one to meet the “real” Susie. Not Angelica. That’s not the only bit of debunking proof, but it’s the easiest one to explain and point to. Thankfully, I think there’s nothing to this disturbing theory other than creeping out ’90s children for creepiness sake. If you’re feeling uncomfortable, be sure to read the rest of that debunking Reddit thread or hug your Reptar stuffed animal.\n\nRelated: All ’90s Kids Shows and Cartoons on Streaming\n\n[Where to stream Rugrats]\n\n[Where to stream All Grown Up]\n\nPhotos: Everett Collection"
