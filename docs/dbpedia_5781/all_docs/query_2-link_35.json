        "text": "5. Dylan “Dil” Pickles\n\nCan you verifiably prove that the very first words spoken by Rugrats’ youngest member weren’t “All lives matter?” We’re gonna need receipts is all we’re saying.\n\n4. Charles “Chuckie” Finster, Jr.\n\nEver since he popped out of the womb, this bespectacled youngster had the type of timidity that would be catnip for Trumpism. You just know this ginger would hide his red hair beneath a matching cap.\n\n3. Lillian “Lil” DeVille\n\nHer mom is a liberated second-wave White feminist — and it’s safe to assume that the hair bow doesn’t fall far from the tree. Which is to say, in adulthood, Phil’s twin sister would be the type to put a pink hat on a Harriet Tubman statue to “make a statement.”\n\n2. Angelica Pickles\n\nAs a child, this privileged, spoiled brat daughter to negligent workaholic parents — a CEO and an investment banker — most frequently clashes with the series’ token Black toddler, Susie. In real life, she’d basically grow up to be Amy Cooper.\n\n1. Tommy Pickles\n\nMaybe it’s the way he assumed the role of the Rugrats’ adventurous leader. Or it could be his love of the color blue. Whatever the case, something tells us Tommy would’ve been front and center at the 2017 Charlottesville rally, rocking a Fred Perry polo and the best drip Dick’s Sporting Goods had to offer. From baby boy to Proud Boy — they grow up so fast!"
