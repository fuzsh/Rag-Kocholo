        "text": "While a lot of children’s television may seem like nonsense, there may actually be some true gems hidden in the dust. A series I grew up watching was Rugrats. This show portrayed the lives of a group of babies and toddlers finding new adventures through their imagination. While the show is silly and cheesy, I realize now that this show actually kept some wonderful messages for children—especially young girls. After hearing that every Disney princess movie is a bad influence for young girls, I was happy to hear one of my childhood series was a keeper.\n\nYoung children can easily relate to the Rugrats because there is such a variety of different characters. I think one of the most useful aspects of this show is that the characters are just as curious as many of the viewers watching. So, when the show teaches a lesson, the kids watching can learn it too. The characters in the show have parents and friends to teach them right from wrong, just as many real-life families do. More than that, the Rugrats make up a variety of different people.\n\nRugrats was a show that displayed a group of characters that included White, Japanese, and African-American families. Rugrats not only showcases these cultural varieties but also go into the backgrounds of their diverse characters. The character Chuckie Finster receives a new stepsister, Kimi, during one of the show’s televised movies. Kimi Finster speaks her native language, Japanese, and the show discusses her culture when they first meet her. On All Grown Up, the follow-up show to Rugrats, an episode \"Memoirs of a Finster\" has Kimi presenting a report on her Japanese heritage. It was during the episode that it was revealed her parents are divorced and her birth father still lives in Japan. The show did more than simply dress a Japanese girl in cultural clothing, they explained the family's history and their significant wardrobe. A child watching this show would not only see a racially different girl but learn about her as well. Kimi Finster and her mother were very accepted in the show and prove an excellent example of diversity for the show.\n\nThe show Rugrats recognizes true potential for young girls. The show is a great example for children for many reasons. Rugrats has a group of young kids or babies and explores great imagination, seeing the characters go on expansive adventures in their own backyards, but also proves real success. One of the best ways they show a successful career is through the African-American family in the show. Suzie is one of the characters who is seen as smart and, in the later episodes, holds an amazing singing talent. Besides the young child herself, her mother is a very positive role model. Her mother, Lucy, is presented as a doctor, while her previous occupations included an airplane pilot and chef. Clearly, she is vastly accomplished in life. This not only allows children to explore their options, but also shows them anyone can achieve these dreams. You can achieve greatness by being yourself. Instead of simply having an African-American character on the show to attract a more diverse audience, they provided an impressive lifestyle for the family.\n\nSo, it's official, we can learn from cartoon babies!"
