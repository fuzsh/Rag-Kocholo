        "text": "Perhaps a somewhat unpopular opinion, but I'd say Seasons 2-3 of the Rugrats had some of the best writing of any Nick animated series. That scene with Stu and the Pudding (and frankly that entire episode) is a good example that highlights this.\n\nThe problem is, those few episodes in the grand scheme of things make up a relatively small part of the Rugrats series as a whole, thus they kind of get drowned out by all the bad/mediocre episodes in retrospect.\n\nI blame Arlene Klasky and her micromanagement entirely for ruining what could have been great things for the Rugrats had it not been cancelled initially.\n\nPlease consider that Arlene and Paul have successfully reconciled, which may not be widely known. Additionally, it's noteworthy that many of the writers for the reboot are experienced professionals who previously worked during the Germain era. This factor could account for the reduced presence of certain issues that viewers had with later episodes and even the resolution of some of those flaws.\n\nWhile some individuals argue that the show's quality declined after Paul Germain's departure (Which I get, and even agree that his era of the original was the best), it's important to recognize that this perspective may not significantly influence the recent resurgence of online interest. The original show maintained its popularity until 2002, and during the peak of its nostalgic revival, some of the most cherished moments stem from the later years of the original series. (Nickelodeon's marketing efforts seemed to focus primarily on Seasons 1-3, even when it came to merchandise.)\n\nThe key point here is that some people tend to downplay the show's significance and attribute its appeal solely to nostalgia, despite the fact that the Germain era provides solid evidence to the contrary. Perhaps Saberspark's video on this topic, which garnered wider attention, has influenced people's perceptions. This is regrettable, considering that the debate is three decades old, and all parties involved have since reconciled.\n\nRugrats was at its best in the third season, because its writing took on a more cynical and edgier tone with episodes like The Gold Rush, Naked Tommy, Angelica's Worst Nightmare, Pickles vs. Pickles and The Sky is Falling. Plus great jokes for the adults who happened to be watching with their kids, like \"Satchmo!\" \"The trumpet player?\"\n\nWhen season 4 debuted, even as a younger viewer I could tell it was softened quite a bit. I stopped watching soon after.\n\nI must concur with that sentiment. Season 3 (or Season 5, as the initial 65 episodes were originally bundled as five seasons, but later restructured into three seasons in the 2000s, likely for syndication convenience) stands out as my preferred season from the original series, primarily due to its captivating color palette, as well as its profound character development and exploration. Moreover, its tone took on a more edgy quality, the humor grew more incisive, and the animation skillfully harnessed its inherent fluidity.\"\n\nPlease consider that Arlene and Paul have successfully reconciled, which may not be widely known.

I think most fans of Rugrats who are aware of the falling out between Klasky and Germain acknowledge they've since reconciled. But that still doesn't change the fact their dispute at the time due to their creative & managerial differences had a detrimental effect on the quality of the series in hindsight, and in all likelihood changed what could have been the trajectory of the series. And yes, many of the original writers may have returned for the current reboot. But that magic lost over 25 years isn't and never was going to be close to recaptured.\n\nAnd none of what I'm saying is intended to be disrespectful to any of them as professionals. It's just my honest critique as a fan based on observations of the facts we know.\n\n2. While it is true that the Rugrats peaked in popularity during the years of 1995 through 2000, the ratings from the years 1995 - 1997 were mostly from reruns of episodes during the Germain era. And I'd argue after 1997, the Rugrats were mostly riding a sugar high from its theatrical releases, which again the first film at least was greenlit due to the overwhelmingly reception of the Germain episodes. Also, I will admit that Season 4 wasn't too bad, but that's in part because a lot of the scripts were already written/unused before Germain left.\n\n3. I respectfully disagree with you about the cherished moments from the later years. True, the later years had some novelties such as seeing the characters \"All Grown Up\" and insight into Chuckie's mom. But at the same time, from what I've observed, most of the references people make and positive memories people have of the Rugrats are from episodes and scenes in Seasons 2-3.\n\nI was always mixed about Rugrats, I never hated it but never really got much out of it. Rugrats was always just the kind of show I'd watch if nothing else good was on but never by choice. Though to be fair, I grew up in the 2000s so this was after the hype and popularly of Rugrats had died down. Still though, I wish they'd given another Nicktoon a chance for a reboot/revival (preferably, a one or two season show they killed off early without giving it a chance.) Even Jimmy Neutron or Teenage Robot I'd be down to see come back but Rugrats already had nine seasons, three movies, and two spin-offs, they'd done everything with the show that I wish it just stayed dead.\n\nIt appears that the situation may be as follows: Children of the 2000s were primarily exposed to animated series influenced by the likes of SpongeBob and Family Guy, while Rugrats, with its humor reminiscent of observational elements found in The Simpsons, had reached its peak popularity by that time. Towards the end of the 2000s, the Rugrats franchise had ceased active production. This decline in popularity coincided with a broader shift away from slice-of-life shows in favor of more humor-centric, gag-driven programming. This shift may have played a role in the recent revisionism of Rugrats, driven by nostalgia cycles.\n\nAdditionally, the phenomenon of '90s kid gatekeeping has not been conducive to Rugrats' legacy. The show was often held up as an emblem of this movement, and sometimes the fervor of certain fan bases can influence how others perceive the show. It's worth noting that in the 2010s, a number of individuals from Gen Z began discovering and enjoying Rugrats, thanks in part to occasional reruns of the original series on Nickelodeon. Therefore, it wouldn't be accurate for me to say that they haven't been exposed to the show at all.\n\nI comprehend the sentiment that some may believe properties like Neutron and Teenage Robot, which had their runs prematurely cut short, are more deserving of reboots compared to Rugrats. However, it's essential to consider this perspective: Rugrats, in my view, possesses a timeless and evergreen quality akin to Peanuts. The endearing characters and premise have the capacity to resonate across generations. Although the original Rugrats may exhibit certain dated aspects, such as the parents embodying archetypes of the boomer generation, its enduring appeal allows it to connect with audiences regardless of the era.\n\nThe writers have acknowledged (See here: New Technology, New Generation of Viewers Inform ‘Rugrats’ Animation Style) that the original Rugrats explored a wide range of narratives, prompting them to opt for a refreshed continuity rather than replicating what the original series was known for. It's worth noting that Rugrats has remained dormant since the 2000s; it's not as though they have been repeatedly resurrecting it every few years. Given the substantial hiatus, a reboot can be viewed as a legitimate endeavor. Furthermore, the refreshed continuity allows the show to explore new storylines and concepts that the original did not.\n\nComparatively, properties like Blue's Clues, which had a similarly substantial run and multiple movies, were warmly welcomed upon their return. Additionally, Phineas and Ferb, which boasts nearly as much content and longevity as Rugrats, with two related spinoffs (including Hamster and Gretel and Milo Murphy's Law, connected within the same universe), has experienced a shorter gap between its original run and its return, but people are again welcoming towards that.\n\nMuch of the negativity surrounding the Rugrats reboot may be attributed to Nickelodeon's recent focus on IP drive. If Nickelodeon had a more balanced portfolio of original shows, and the Rugrats reboot was an exception rather than the norm, it is plausible that people would not only harbor fewer reservations about its existence.\n\nI appreciate the perspective you put things in (and you certainly make some good points), but I still have some counterpoints to them.\n\n1.

I respectfully disagree with you about the cherished moments from the later years. True, the later years had some novelties such as seeing the characters \"All Grown Up\" and insight into Chuckie's mom. But at the same time, from what I've observed, most of the references people make and positive memories people have of the Rugrats are from episodes and scenes in Seasons 2-3.\n\nThere are individuals on YouTube and Twitter who appear to be unaware of the reconciliation between different aspects of a series when discussing its overall quality. I want to emphasize that my intention is not to diminish the significance of the Paul Germain era in any way. I have consistently expressed my preference for this particular era within the original series. I have even had the privilege of engaging in conversations with Paul Germain, including a Skype call, during which he displayed a delightful and passionate commitment to the series. He even provided valuable assistance with a video script I was working on a few months ago. Paul Germain was undeniably the driving creative force behind the original series, and the Germain era played a pivotal role in the show's popularity. However, I believe that his departure alone cannot be solely attributed to the decline in the original show's popularity.\n\nWhen we assess the second run of the series, its popularity endured for approximately five and a half years, until the summer of 2002, when SpongeBob SquarePants eventually surpassed it. This was an impressive duration for any show to remain popular. Even after that, the franchise still maintained a level of profitability. The series concluded because the network wanted to shift its focus to \"All Grown Up\" and cater to the next generation, as indicated by statements from individuals associated with the series. \"All Grown Up\" lasted five seasons and until the purge, pulled in solid ratings. Unfortunately, \"All Grown Up\" also fell victim to changes during the Zarghami era at Nickelodeon. While there was a decline in ratings, it wasn't a dramatic drop, only decreasing by a few points.\n\nNaturally, the popularity of Rugrats would diminish over time, as is the case with most long-running shows (SpongeBob itself experienced occasional declines in popularity, although it remained unrivaled in terms of ratings, except for a brief period when \"Loud House\" gained traction). Contrary to some revisionist claims online, SpongeBob SquarePants was not responsible for Rugrats' decline in popularity. Rather, it was a combination of unfortunate circumstances, including changes at Nickelodeon and creative differences, that contributed to the original series' conclusion.\n\nI would like to point out that the reboot blends elements of both later eras and the Germain era in its writing. Episodes crafted by writers like Rachel Lipman and Michael Ferris, for instance, capture some of the essence and tone of the Germain era. \"My Friend Twinkle\" is a prime example, featuring elements of the edginess and cynical humor that characterized the Germain era.\n\nI am not aware of any other sources that explicitly mention the existence of Season 4 episodes as leftover scripts from Paul's tenure on the show. The only episode that appears to have been under consideration was \"Chanukah,\" a concept that Nick initially wanted to pursue. However, one of Paul's writers advised against it and proposed the idea of creating an episode centered around Passover instead.\n\nIt is true that many of the most cherished episodes are from Paul's era, but my earlier point was directed more toward the perspective of the broader public, as opposed to dedicated fans like yourself and me who believe the earlier seasons were the best. There are memorable moments that extend beyond specific elements such as Chuckie's mom and \"All Grown Up.\" These include moments like \"Rugrats in Paris,\" \"Angelica's Last Stand,\" \"Angelica Orders Out,\" \"Word of the Day,\" \"Piggy's Pizza Palace,\" \"Angelica's Ballet,\" \"Famous Babies,\" \"Ghost Story,\" \"Chuckie's Complaint,\" \"Acorn Nuts and Diapey Butts,\" and \"Discover America.\" Among the later episodes, the introduction of Kimi is particularly well-remembered, and it garnered praise from fans for its impact on Chuckie's character development. This was so significant that there were even concerns about aging up Kimi in later seasons, as it might have been perceived as a retcon, despite the reboot existing in a different continuity.\n\nIn my personal opinion, while Paul's era undoubtedly played a pivotal role in the show's success, it is important to recognize that many of these other episodes do also stick in viewer's minds, regardless of what era people think the show peaked in quality."
