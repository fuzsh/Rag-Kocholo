        "text": "Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures have announced that they will be bringing back the '90s children's television series Rugrats with a 26-episode order and a live-action film featuring CGI characters. Both the TV series and movie will continue the adventures of characters such as Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, Lil, Susie, and Angelica. These new stories will also \"introduce a new world of characters.\"\n\n“Rugrats is hands-down one of the most celebrated cartoons in TV history, and we are thrilled for a whole new audience to meet these iconic characters in brand-new adventures,” said Sarah Levy, COO, Viacom Media Networks; and Interim President, Nickelodeon. “What was true in 1991 when the original show premiered is still true today: kids are fascinated with the world of babies. We can’t wait for today’s kids to meet Tommy, Chuckie and pals.”\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nOriginal Rugrats creators Arlene Klasky, Gábor Csupó, and Paul Germain will be executive producers for the TV series and it will be produced in Burbank, California.\n\nProduction has already begun and more details about release timing, casting, and \"Reptar sightings\" will be announced in the \"coming months.\"\n\nThe Rugrats movie will be written by David Goodman, who has written episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation, Family Guy, and more. The film is currently slated for a November 13, 2020 release date by Paramount Players.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nRugrats was on the air for nine seasons from 1991 to 2004, and spun out three films; The Rugrats Movie, Rugrats in Paris: The Movie, and Rugrats Go Wild. The series won four Daytime Emmy Awards, six Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nRugrats joins the trend of Nickelodeon reviving its old catalog, including a Blue's Clues revival, an Invader Zim movie, a Rocko's Modern Life movie, and the recently released Hey Arnold!: The Jungle Movie, which picked up where the original series left off. Adam Bankhurst is a freelance writer for IGN and Rugrats was probably his favorite show growing up. That, and Spongebob Squarepants. You can follow him on Twitter."
