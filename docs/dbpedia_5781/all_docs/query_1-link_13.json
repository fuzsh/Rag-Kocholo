        "text": "DARK imaginations and trauma are a part of the fan theories surrounding one of Nickelodeon's classic animation series.\n\nOverall speculation about the original incarnation of Rugrats mainly revolves around one character.\n\nWhat is the Rugrats conspiracy theory?\n\nRugrats sleuths suggest that all of the program's characters are a figment of Angelica Pickles' imagination.\n\nThe Rugrats Never Happened theory first circulated among Tumblr users and has since spread among casual fans of the show.\n\nThe original Tumblr rumors claimed all of the babies were never actually born and were lost to tragic circumstances before they could be birthed.\n\nAlthough the infants are supposedly in Angelica's mind, she imagines them because of the loneliness she experiences due to her parents' unavailability.\n\nThe rumors are supported by explanations of what apparently happened to the program's other infants.\n\nAccording to fans, Chuckie Finster died with his mother while she was in labor.\n\nThe loss of his son and wife is believed to be the reason for the neurotic behavior displayed by Chuckie's father Chas Finster.\n\nAngelica's cousin Tommy Pickles was believed to be stillborn.\n\nAs a result of the Pickles family losing Tommy, this could potentially explain why Angelica's uncle Stu is always making toys in the basement.\n\nCrafting toys for the son he never had is theorized to be one of Stu's coping mechanisms.\n\nMoving on to twins Phil and Lil, fans speculate that their mother Betty DeVille actually aborted them before knowing the gender of the babies.\n\nNot knowing the sex of either twin, Angelica imagined them to be one boy and one girl.\n\nOut of all of the children seen in Rugrats, Angelica's cousin Dil and her best friend Suzie are the only two thought to be alive and not be made up by her.\n\nOn July 25, 2016, the Rugrats Never Happened conspiracy was debunked by one of the show's creators.\n\nAt that year's Comic-Con in San Diego, co-creator Arlene Klasky told BuzzFeed: \"A lot of people believe that conspiracy theory and no, it's not true. I have to console the kids online.\"\n\nHow can I watch Rugrats?\n\nFrom August 1991 to August 2004, Rugrats ran for nine seasons on Nickelodeon.\n\nThe classic animated program is available for streaming via Hulu.\n\nOn May 27, 2021, a reboot of the initial series saw the return of Angelica, Tommy, and all of their cartoon pals."
