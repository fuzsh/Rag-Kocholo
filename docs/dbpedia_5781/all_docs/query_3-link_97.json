The Swiss duo is back in the spotlight today with their new EP \"Twisted\", including 2 solo tracks and a featured collaboration with Mowgli. An explosion of high frequencies that is going to set up your minds for your next dance-floor experience. Stretch your synapses before the Rugrats get them twisted!\n\nGenre\n\nPsytrance"
