        "text": "Long live the original Rugrats episodes\n\nThe one thing constant in life is change and when it comes to the \"Rugrats\" TV series there have been many changes new characters and updated versions of the show. This article centers on the original series that ran from 1991 to 2004. Created by Arlene Klasky, Gábor Csupó, and Paul Germain, this show was one of Nickelodeon's most popular and enduring series, known for its unique premise and charming characters.\n\nMy daughter and youngest son would curl up in the living room or one of their bedrooms and watcha 6 hour VCR tape my mother made of Rugrats episodes and the show is still near and dear to my heart today. It focuses on the adventures of a group of babies and toddlers, primarily Tommy Pickles, Chuckie Finster, Phil and Lil DeVille, and Angelica Pickles.\n\nAngelica and her dumb babies\n\nThe children were enchanted as they talk to each other but adults only hear them cry and see them point except for Angelica who is the oldest. The series is known for its perspective, which often showcases the world from the babies' point of view, including their imaginative interpretations of the mundane and their interactions with each other. So help me Bob is their version of So help me God and they use their own wording for many adult phrases. Lets take a look at the 5 main characters before the changes came.\n\nTommy Pickles: The main protagonist, Tommy is a brave and resourceful baby who often leads the group in their escapades. He's known for his signature blue shirt, diaper, and screwdriver toy. Tommy is level-headed and thinks up ways to get away from the adults.\n\nChuckie Finster: Tommy's best friend, Chuckie is characterized by his red hair, glasses, and nervous disposition. He's often hesitant to take risks, but his friends help him overcome his fears. Chuckie often tries to talk Tommy out of his escapades but ends up reluctantly going along.\n\nPhil and Lil DeVille: Fraternal twins who often play together, Phil and Lil are known for their love of mud and insects. They are distinguishable by their clothing and hairstyles (Phil has a small spike of hair, while Lil has a bow). When they are angry they call one another Phillip and Lilian.\n\nAngelica Pickles: Tommy's older cousin, Angelica is known for her bossy and manipulative behavior. She often concocts elaborate schemes to get what she wants from the babies but will proudly defend them by saying \"No one touches my dumb babies but me.\"\n\nThe show is known for its humor, heartwarming moments, and its exploration of the challenges and adventures that babies and toddlers might experience in their day-to-day lives. The \"Rugrats\" often crawl away from their parents or Tommy and Angelica's grandpa and have their own adventures sometimes involving Tommy's dog Spike The nostalgia factor is important considering today the idea of children wandering away even in cartoons is not very well received.\n\n\"Rugrats\" is beloved by audiences and critics also gave it great reviews. There have been several movies The Rugrats Movie and Rugrats in Paris. Tommy, Angelica, Phil, Lil, and Chuckie are adorable and have given us so many memorable episodes. My favorite is Candy Bar Creep Show from season one where the babies frighten Angelica and Grandpa along with trick-or-treaters. They end up with all the candy and have their first taste of Reptar bars that turn their tongues green."
