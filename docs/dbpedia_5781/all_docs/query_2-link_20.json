        "text": "Living… at home with his mommy and daddy, Didi and Stu Pickles. Between his crib, the playpen, and the backyard, the Pickles’ home is a world filled with adventure for 1-year-old Tommy.\n\nProfession… being a baby. There’s a lot involved in the life of a baby: playing pretend, trying to make sense of all the crazy things grown-ups do, and leading friends on adventures.\n\nInterests… learning about the world, leading his friends on adventures, and storing things in his diaper – you never know when you might need a screwdriver or a quarter, so it’s good to keep stuff handy.\n\nRelationship Status… single. A baby doesn’t have much interest in dating. Tommy’s most important relationships are his friendships with his fellow babies and playpen explorers: Chuckie, Phil, and Lil.\n\nChallenge… trying to understand the world. There’s a lot that Tommy doesn’t understand, but he is always filled with ideas to figure it out. As he always says: “A baby’s gotta do, what a baby’s gotta do!” His bossy cousin Angelica often comes over to stir up trouble, but Tommy usually stands up to her.\n\nPersonality… brave, imaginative, and adventurous. Tommy is a baby, so the world is brand new to him and there’s a lot to learn and explore! He’s a born leader: daring, loyal, kind-hearted. He can be a bit stubborn and controlling, but Tommy will always be there to take care of his friends."
