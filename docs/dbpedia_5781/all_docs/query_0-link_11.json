        "text": "Rugrats (1991–2004) or (1991-2006) is an American animated public television series aimed at younger children. This series is about babies and their daily antics.\n\nSeason 1\n\n[edit]\n\nTommy Pickles and the Great White Thing [Pilot]\n\n[edit]\n\n[Cut back to the TV, where the fishing show breaks for a chicken commercial]\n\nChareen: [on TV] Hi, I'm Chareen for Squeaky Chicken Restaurants. [cut back to Grandpa, who gets up from his chair to, shall we say, \"take care of personal business\"] Want to know what we got in store for you? Our new Chicken Half-Pounder!\n\nGrandpa: Well, nature beckons.\n\nChareen: [voice only, on TV] The other guys only give you a third of a pound in their chicken sandwich, and, yeech, that's without Squeaky's special sauce. So come on in now and try our new Chicken Half-Pounder! It's more chickenny! And for a limited time only...\n\n[As the commercial continues above, Tommy puts the spent toilet paper and the plunger aside. Grandpa, meanwhile, offstage, gets a surprise of his life]\n\nTommy's First Birthday [1.1]\n\n[edit]\n\nStu: Good morning, Champ.\n\n[Tommy opens his eyes. He is in his crib as Stu and Didi hang a banner that says, HAPPY BIRTHDAY in yellow letters on it]\n\nStu and Didi: Happy Birthday, Tommy.\n\n[Stu blows a noisemaker and throws confetti, which lands on Tommy, who is wearing a red shirt rather than the light blue one he would wear later throughout the series]\n\nDidi: You're a whole year old today.\n\nStu: And boy, have we got some great presents for you. [Tommy giggles as Didi picks him up. Didi then kisses him on his forehead. Tommy giggles as Didi lays him down on his changing table. She pulls up his shirt, and untapes Tommy's dirty diaper. Tommy coos as Didi changes his diaper] Wait til' he sees my present, Didi. Did I tell you about the Hoverama prototype?\n\nDidi: Uh-huh, you did, Stu.\n\nStu: Picture this, Didi. The body's thirty-six inches long and about four feet diameter and... [before he can finish, Didi lifts Tommy's legs] Yikes!\n\nDidi: Oh, just put it in the pail, Stu, and hand me a fresh diaper!\n\nBarbecue Story/Waiter, There's a Baby in My Soup [1.2]\n\n[edit]\n\n[Tommy cries, and the camera zooms in on his mouth. Stu hears the crying and turns his attention to it, as do Lou and Minka. Howard hears the crying, then looks at Angelica, who innocently pretends not to. Didi runs up to Tommy]\n\nDidi: What's wrong, Tommy? What happened? [picks up Tommy and coos at him] Oh, boo-boo, what's the matter, baby? [as she lifts Tommy up, Tommy sees his ball behind the fence in a neighbor's yard. A light shines on the ball as the camera zooms in on it, then Tommy stops crying] All better now.\n\nMr. Mucklehoney: I'm so hungry, I could eat a hog, head first!\n\nAt the Movies/Slumber Party [1.3]\n\n[edit]\n\nBaby Commercial/Little Dude [1.4]\n\n[edit]\n\nStudent: [after seeing Tommy's dirty diaper] Wow!

Chuckie, Phil and Lil lie on the ground] Wow! Moose country.\n\n[Chuckie, thinking for a moment that Tommy was referring to the insect from earlier that’s now on the ground next to him]\n\nGrandpa's Teeth/Momma Trauma [1.7]\n\n[edit]\n\nReal or Robots?/Special Delivery [1.8]\n\n[edit]\n\nCandy Bar Creep Show/Monster in the Garage [1.9]\n\n[edit]\n\nWeaning Tommy/Incident in Aisle Seven [1.10]\n\n[edit]\n\nTouchdown Tommy/The Trial [1.11]\n\n[edit]\n\nDidi: Oh, Betty, that was Mr. Fluffles, Tommy's favorite lamp.

[to Cynthia] Cynthia, it's impossible to teach babies anything.\n\nSeason 2\n\n[edit]\n\nToy Palace/Sand Ho! [2.1]\n\n[edit]\n\nChuckie vs. the Potty/Together at Last [2.2]\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Big House/The Shot [2.3]\n\n[edit]\n\n[Tommy dribbles the ball. A strange baby is playing with a school bus and sees Tommy]\n\nWiseguy: Psst! [Tommy hears him and looks around] Over here.\n\nTommy: You talking to me?\n\nWiseguy: Shh! You don't want them screws to hear, do ya?\n\nTommy: Screws?\n\nWiseguy: You know, grownups.\n\nTommy: Oh.\n\nWiseguy: You new around here, ain't ya? Everybody around here calls me Wiseguy on account of I know everything what's going on.\n\nTommy: Hi, Wiseguy, my name's Tommy Pickles.\n\nWiseguy: Sure, sure. Listen, if you're gonna make it in this place, you gotta know what's what.\n\nTommy: What?\n\nWiseguy: Right, You see that kid over there? [A big chubby baby walks over to another baby in blue pajamas suckling on a bottle] That's Big Justin. He's kinda the boss around here on account of he's the biggest. [Big Justin takes the bottle apart from the other baby and suckles on it] You see that girl over there? [points at a girl building wooden blocks] They call her the Builder on account of she's always playing with blocks. And look over there. [The screen pans to a baby playing with red Play-Doh and yellow bits of clay all over him. He sculpts the Play-Doh into a pit bull] They call him Doughboy. He can make anything out of Play-Doh.\n\n[Doughboy sculpts the Play-Doh into a cat. Suddenly, Tommy and Wiseguy hear a baby crying very loud. A shot of inside his mouth is shown as Sandra and Jonathan arrive]\n\nTommy: What's wrong with that kid?\n\nWiseguy: Oh, don't worry about him; he's faking it.\n\nTommy: Faking it?\n\nWiseguy: Yep, that's Crybaby. [Sandra and Jonathan try to calm Crybaby down] He can make himself cry even when nothing's bothering him.\n\n[As Sandra and Jonathan turn away, Crybaby stops crying and grins for a moment, but resumes back to crying as Sandra and Jonathan take out a rattle and stuffed teddy bear]\n\nBig Justin: Hey. [Tommy and Wiseguy turn to Justin] Who's the new kid?\n\nWiseguy: [stammers nervously] Oh, hi, Justin. This here is Tommy Pickles.\n\n[Tommy grins at Justin]\n\nBig Justin: Nice ball, kid. Give it to me.\n\nTommy: [pulls it away] No!\n\n[All the babies stop playing and turn seeing this]\n\nBig Justin: What'd you say, kid?\n\nTommy: It's my ball, you can't have it!\n\nBig Justin: Look, you're new around here, and maybe nobody warned ya, I'm Big Justin and I run this place. [pulls his suspenders in a snap] Now, GIVE ME THE BALL! [grabs the ball]\n\nTommy: [pulls it back] NO!!\n\nBig Justin: I said GIVE IT TO ME!!!\n\n[Big Justin and Tommy get caught in a tug-o-war with the ball. Wiseguy and Crybaby watch this in shock]\n\nCrybaby: [holds a cookie] Betcha a cookie Justin gets the ball.\n\nWiseguy: [gives Crybaby another] You're on.\n\n[Big Justin and Tommy continue fighting over the ball until Tommy lets the ball slip out of his fingers and ends up falling into a wagon, which rolls across the room, knocks over Builder's block structure, crushes Doughboy's clay cat sculpture and rams into a wall. Tommy sees Doughboy stare at what just happened]\n\nTommy: [gasps] I'm sorry.\n\nDoughboy: [tears well up and bawls] AAUUGGHH!!\n\n[Sandra comes in and sees what just happened. She is accompanied by Jonathan and Bob]\n\nJonathan: Diagnosis?\n\nSandra: Destructive overreaction syndrome. Procedure?\n\nJonathan: Positive reinforcement denial?\n\nSandra: [shakes her head] Uh-uh.\n\nJonathan: Withdrawal of snack gratification?\n\nSandra: Uh-uh.\n\nBob: [takes out a fresh diaper] Fresh change of diapers?\n\nSandra: No. [points at Tommy, echoes] Time out.\n\n[The babies gasp in shock one by one]\n\nWiseguy: They're gonna give him the pen!\n\n[A single pen is shown by the corner of the room. Sandra rushes Tommy to the pen with Jonathan and Bob following]\n\nBob: I yet say a nice change of diapers might cheer the little fella up!\n\nJonathan: How long?\n\nSandra: [holds five fingers] Five minutes.\n\nJonathan: Five minutes?! Don't you think that's a bit...harsh?\n\nSandra: [sternly] Do it.\n\n[Jonathan does so. The timer is heard ticking as Tommy goes hesitantly silent]\n\nBuilder: Woah, five minutes!\n\nDoughboy: These screws just keep getting meaner and meaner.\n\n[Tommy lowly lays silent in the pen as he watches the cat clock on the wall. Tommy sees a toy jug and strides it along the wooden bars of the pen]\n\nSandra: [confiscates the jug] No, no, Tommy. [grins] Noise-making is not part of... [echoes] ...time out.\n\nShowdown at Teeter-Totter Gulch/Mirrorland [2.4a]\n\n[edit]\n\nMother: [a la Demi Moore] Oh, look at you!

[quietly] Make it ten!\n\nAngelica: [crying] I want my ice cream!\n\nStu: We didn't really pay enough attention to the kids today.\n\nDrew: You're right, Stu. We got a couple of free games. Maybe we could let the kids play. It won't take long.\n\nEarl: [sobbing and groveling] Oh, please, no! Anything but that!

YOU OUGHTA BE ASHAMED!\n\nHoward: Charles is right. Our behavior's been absolutely disgusting. I'm a failure and I've let everybody down while I should be—\n\nBetty: Yeah, yeah.

[lifts up Tommy and looks at him] Don't you know that focusing so closely on images can permanently damage your vision?\n\n[As she talks, she looks closer into Tommy's eyes, which go cross-eyed, causing Tommy to see multiple copies of Didi's face. He quickly uncrosses his eyes, making his vision go back to normal.

I wasn't crying.\n\nRingmaster: Sorry, folks, no refunds.\n\nDidi: I'm glad we left. I'd forgotten how unsanitary circuses are.\n\nStu: Come on, Deed. Circuses are an American institution.

Miss. Reporterman, I'm not a bad kid, I'm really not, all I ever wanted is a little ice cream, maybe a toy here or there, I mean, doesn't every three year old have right a little kindness. And now you're trying to make me feel like I'm a bad guy, where will it all end. [Angelica's starts crying of Clarissa about go home.

Mr. Barnum, Please call your first witness.\n\nBarnum: I call for the stand, Mrs. Charlotte Pickles! [we see an \"El Barato\" cigar close to the camera and Barnum pulls it away] Now Mrs. Pickles, is it not true on the last Tuesday night on August 3rd, that you served your 3-year old Angelica a large piece of broccoli for dinner?\n\nCharlotte: Well, that depends on your word, large. I say it was a small piece.\n\nBarnum: Mrs. Pickles. Let's not quibble over the size of the serving.\n\nCharlotte: It seems to me. Your the one is quibbling. [everyone laughs]\n\nBarnum: Just answer the question Mrs. Pickles.\n\nCharlotte: What question was that, Mr. Barnum?\n\nBarnum: Did you or did you not, serve you daughter a disgusting piece of broccoli!\n\nCharlotte: [offended] I served my daughter broccoli and I wasn't \"disgusting\"! I was a very healthy nitrous piece of vegetable, Mr. Barnum, rich of vitamin C, any parent would do the same!\n\nAngelica: OBJECTION!\n\nBarnum: Angelica, I'm doing a questioning, let me handle this.\n\nAngelica: But you doing a louse chop of yourself, you won't look good!\n\nBarnum: [frustrated] How dare you talk to me like that! I am skilled with months of experience!\n\nAngelica: Your highness, I would like to dismiss my lawyer for discussing conference.\n\nBarnum: You don't have to! I would rather quit rather helping a little brat like you!\n\nAngelica: Your majesty, I would like to present my own lawyer.\n\nJudge: Well, I must admit that all of my years that I never heard a three year old representing herself. But, I guess there's no presence against it.\n\nAngelica: Well, see you later, Buster! I guess it's back chasing ambushes like you.\n\n[He leaves]\n\nDrew: But the toy store is out!\n\nDrew: [gasps] This isn't happening! I was just being a good father!\n\nJudge: Bailiff!

[the bailiff grabs Drew by the shoulders and drags him away] I'm a good father! I'm a good father!\n\nJudge: [bangs his gavel repeatedly as Drew shouts \"I'm a good father!\" repeatedly] Order! Order in this court! Order! I demand order! I am the judge here!\n\n[The judge continues yelling at Drew and banging his gavel while the cheers turn into evil laughter as Drew is continued to be dragged away.

[poses like a superhero]\n\nLil: Maybe we could make him strong like Phil.\n\n[Spiffy tackles Phil and licks his face]\n\nPhil: [getting up after Spiffy runs off] Yeah, we could feed him bugs! I gots a diapie full and they're bursting with power!\n\n[Spiffy runs around with the toy frog]\n\nTommy: Dil's not much of a bug-eater.\n\nPhil: More for me. [takes a worm from his diaper and tries to it]\n\nTommy: Wait! I have the perfect thing! Come on!\n\nTommy: No, it's for Dil! We gots to wash all the baby power off! Come on, pass it down! [passes it to Phil, who passes it to Lil, who passes it to Chuckie, who passes it to Kimi, who walks over to Dil and pours it on him]\n\n[Dil busts out crying]\n\nChuckie: Oh no, he's cryin'! He's gonna shake everything again! [holds his helmet]\n\nLil: Wait! It's not shaken!\n\nKimi: We washed the power off! Tommy, you're the smartest.\n\n[another earthquake starts]\n\nLil: Uh-oh. Now, you're dumb again.\n\nDidi: [entering] It's OK, Dil. Mommy's coming. Oh, your diaper is wet, sweetums. And so's your head?! [wipes water off his head with her hand] Boy! When you have to go, you have to go! [picks Dil up]\n\nTommy: Dil has to go and it's all 'cause of me!\n\nLil: How come washing Dilly's power off didn't work?\n\nTommy: Must've already rubbed in.\n\nKimi: Well, maybe we could keep him from using his powers.\n\nTommy: That's it! We'll just make sure he doesn't move around! Ever!\n\nAll: Yeah!\n\nStu: Don't worry, Deed. It's easy as pie. To open, simply tug gently on the Velcro side and [tries to open one but fails] Ya just tug gently and--[falls over, breaking the strap and knocking the drawer out]\n\nDidi: Oh, Stu. I hope you didn't put these anyplace else. [looks shocked as there are some in the living room]\n\n[the babies go outside]\n\nChuckie: What are we going to do? The Dummi Bears didn't work!\n\nKimi: [shaking her head] Taking the rattle didn't work.\n\nLil: Water didn't work.\n\nTommy: [stops pushing Dil's stroller] I gots a idea! After my daddy mows the lawn, he can't even lift his finger! Maybe that will work for Dil!\n\nKimi: That's a great idea Tommy, except Dil can't mow! He can't even walk.\n\nTommy: He can if we help him.\n\n[Chuckie and the twins cheer, then the babies all push Dil's stroller and the toy lawnmower and the wagon with the dogs in, who eventually run away]\n\nLil: Dilly's not tired at all.\n\nKimi: And now he's making funny sounds. [referring to his stomach growling]\n\nTommy: He's gonna poop! Run for your lives! [He hides in the sand box, Phil hides in a bush, Chuckie hides behind the sand box, the girls hide behind a tree, Dil farts, everyone comes out of their hiding places]\n\nChuckie: Hey, nothing shaked!\n\nTommy: Maybe the mowing worked.\n\nAll: Yay!\n\n[the parents come outside]\n\nStu: Well, I think the shaking stopped, Deed.\n\nDidi: That's a relief. Now, maybe we could put away some of your safety equipment? I mean I'm all for being prepared, Stu, but I'd like to return to normal.\n\nStu: What's not normal?...You're right, Deed, maybe I did go a bit far. [takes helmet off Lil] I need to come up with a simple approach. Like instant airbags that deploy at the slightest hint of motion!\n\nDidi: [removes Kimi's helmet as Phil removes his] At least nothing exploded this time.\n\nTommy: We did it, guys. Sorry I gave you too much power, Dilly. And I'm pretty sure you're back to Norman now! Of course, there's only one way to be sure. [has Spiffy and Dil play tug-o'-war with the frog, Spiffy wins] Yup, Dilly's out of power!\n\nThey Came from the Backyard / Lil's Phil of Trash [9.3]\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Perfect Twins [9.4]\n\n[edit]\n\nBetty: [laughs] Imagine, Deed. Your great aunt was my twins mother. Gee, we're close sisters! And they have twins the same age as Phil and Lil!\n\nDidi: Isn't that wonderful?\n\nBetty: Phil and Lil, guess what? You have twins cousins! Hedley and Smeldey! And they're coming from across the ocean!\n\nTommy: Wow! You have cousbins!\n\nLil: I don't know why they're from the ocean.\n\nKimi: Maybe they're fishies.\n\nChas: This is Chuckie and Kimi. Have guys have fun, ta-da. [He walks away along with Didi]\n\nPhil: Sorry, we weren't perfect twins Lil.\n\nLil: I thinks we can be perfect for each other, even if you are a bit of a nutter.\n\nPhil: Am not Lillian!\n\nLil: Are too Phillip!\n\nPhil: Am not!\n\nLil: Are too!\n\n[Phil and Lil continue to argue.

She looked around at the elves at work, but was then called by one with great importance to his work]\n\nHermie: Little girl! Santa is not going to be pleased when he sees what you've done to his door!\n\nAngelica: What, it was like that!\n\n[She was barred from going any further]\n\nHermie: May I ask what you're doing here?\n\nAngelica: Oh! I'm here to collect the presents that Santa was supposed to get me before he quit.\n\nHermie: And how do you know you were getting any presents, pray tell?\n\nAngelica: I know because I have been good all year. And if it hadn't have been for those dumb babies, I would have been even nicer.\n\nHermie: [He looked very suspicious as he went over to his desk and got out The Book of Good Children] Is that so? Well, let's just see if you are on the list then. Name?\n\nAngelica: Angelica Pickles. [The book opened with a lot of dust poofing out as Hermie began looking through the pages] Ick!\n\nHermie: Pickles, Pickles, Pickles... Ah-ha! \"Tommy Pickles\". \"Dil Pickles\"... Just as I thought! There's no \"Angelica Pickles\" on the list.\n\n[He closed the book and put it away, with Angelica becoming very annoyed]\n\nAngelica: WHAT DO YOU MEAN I'M NOT ON THE LIST?! Listen elf, I have been looking so hard for this place, and I'm not leaving till I get my Christmas presents!\n\nHermie: Well, maybe you should have thought about that before you started stealing those cookies and scaring those carolers away... and lie to your friends.\n\nAngelica: [Then she became suspicious] Wait... I thought Santa was supposed to know if I was bad or good?\n\nHermie: [He picked up the letters] Santa delegates.\n\nAngelica: What's that mean?\n\nHermie: It means I'm overworked and underpaid! Now, if you excuse us, we've got to get back to work! Better luck next year.\n\nAngelica: But what about my Christmas presents?\n\nHermie: You have to take that up with the supervisor. [He pointed her to the portrait of Santa]\n\nAngelica: But I've already talked to him, and all he gave me was this dumb-old Reindeer. [She looked at her pockets only to find Prancy wasn't there. But then she was confronted by a real Reindeer with a resemblance that Angelica recognized] Prancy? Prancy, you're alive!\n\nPrancy: [He walked sadly away from her] I thought we were friends.\n\nAngelica: But we are.\n\nPrancy: Then why did you call me dumb?\n\nAngelica: I dunno, I call a lot of things dumb. It's not that I mean it or anything.\n\nHermie: [He then began to escort Prancy away from Angelica] Come Prancy, I take you back to Santa.\n\nAngelica: Prancy, no! I'm sorry I called you dumb, come back!\n\nHermie: [He then turned and reflected her with a question] Why'd you say to Tommy that if Dil never got a Christmas present this year, then he will never have a Christmas for the rest of his life, huh?\n\nAngelica: I had to do something. He was being a goody two-shoes.\n\nHermie: [He then began ascending the stairs] I'm sorry to be the one to say this, Angelica, but here in Christmas Land, there is not place for kids like you.\n\nAngelica: But I wanna be in Christmas Land.\n\nClown Around/The Baby Rewards [9.6]\n\n[edit]\n\nChas: You shouldn't be out here, Chuckie.

I had taken fifteen months off work after my second child was born. I was working from home on concepts for \"Sesame Street\" shorts. Gabor Csupo, my husband at the time, asked me to come up with ideas to pitch to NICK. So, I quickly expanded notes I’d written from one of the \"Sesame Street\" ideas. My thoughts were, \"if babies could talk what would they say\" and \"what was the logic that drove tiny humans to desperately want to stick their hands in the toilet?\" It fascinated me, but mostly I found it humorous. Paul Germain, our development executive at the time, and Gabor Csupo then pitched several ideas to Nickelodeon. Vanessa Coffee had the foresight to choose what ultimately became \"Rugrats\" and Gerry Laybourne, the President of NICK at the time, had the vision to green-light it! Gabor and I sketched some of the original characters and worked with Paul on creating the world of \"Rugrats\". Together we produced a pilot that Peter Chung, a brilliant artist and animator, directed. The super talented Mark Mothersbaugh created the music for the show. The studio produced the \"Rugrats\" and \"All Grown Up\" series over the next decade as well as two \"Rugrats\" movies and a third film, where the \"Rugrats\" meet \"The Wild Thornberrys\". Our studio just exploded with work! The next ten years were intense for me because I was raising two children and working. Gabor and I continued to create or produce nine more animated series.\n\nArlene Klasky Exclusive Rugrats Creator Arlene Klasky]\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nRugrats random quote generator at Klasky-Csupo"
