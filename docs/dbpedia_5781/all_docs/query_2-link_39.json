        "text": "Also see the All Grown Up characters page.\n\nKids\n\nTommy Pickles\n\nThe main character and unofficial leader; he is best known for his incredible bravery and the screwdriver he always carries in his diaper.\n\nVoiced by E.G. Daily.\n\nTropes Associated With Tommy:\n\nThe Ace\n\nBadass Adorable\n\nBig Brother Instinct: Towards Dil.\n\nBald of Awesome\n\nCatch Phrase: \"A baby's gotta do, what a baby's gotta do\" and after the movie, \"Hang on to your diapies, babies\".\n\nCharacterization Marches On: In the earliest episodes, Tommy was a regular baby with no distinguishable personality--an infant version of The Everyman or The Standardized Leader. Later Tommy begins to develop a stronger personality, becoming a brave Determinator who loves adventure. It can be pretty strange to see Tommy being relatively quiet and cautious in his solo adventures. E.G Daily herself even mentions that Tommy was more baby-like and tiny in the earlier episodes, but as time went by, he got alot more mature and wiser in the show's 10th anniversary special documentary.\n\nDeterminator: One of the youngest ones you'll find in fiction.\n\nDoes Not Like Shoes: He's the only member of the cast that doesn't wear shoes. He does wear shoes when he's ten years older though.\n\nThe Hero: During the roleplays he and the babies participate\n\nInformed Judaism: Averted for a change; in addition to the token Hanukkah special, his family also celebrates Passover.\n\nAlso, Boris and Minka are all the proof you need.\n\nInnocent Blue Eyes: As seen in the unaired pilot.\n\nOnly Child Syndrome: Until the first movie that is.\n\nPlucky Boy\n\nSensitive Guy and Manly Man: Manly Man to Chuckie's Sensitive Guy.\n\nVocal Evolution: In the first episodes, Tommy had a very raspy, quiet voice, and sounds downright feminine in the pilot.\n\nWrite Who You Know: Tommy was based on Arlene Klasky and Gábor Csupó's son, and was named after co-creator Paul Germain's son, Thomas.\n\nChuckie Finster\n\nIn addition to his uncontrollable red hair, big glasses and bucked teeth, Chuckie is easily distinguished from his friends by his dislike of adventure and irrational fear of particular objects, most notably the \"guy on the oatmeal box\" (the Quaker Oats logo).\n\nFirst voiced by Christine Cavanaugh, then Nancy Cartwright\n\nTropes Associated With Chuckie:\n\nAdorkable\n\nBig No: His first word in Rugrats In Paris!\n\nBlind Without'Em\n\nButt Monkey: To the extreme.\n\nCatch Phrase: \"I Don't Think That's Such a Good Idea...\"\n\n\"We're doomed! Doomed, I tell ya!\"\n\nCowardly Sidekick: Part of what makes him Tommy's foil.\n\nDidn't Want an Adventure\n\nFlanderization: Originally, Chuckie was the voice of reason among his friends, being the only one with any idea/worry of how dangerous many of the thing they were doing were. However, starting with the second season, Chuckie's sense of caution was exaggerated to the point where he is so cowardly that he's scared of the guy on the oatmeal box.\n\nFoil: Tommy and Chuckie generally get along too well, but they don't always agree on certain things. Specifically, Tommy rarely shows signs of fear while Chuckie does.\n\nGenre Savvy: One could could consider him to be the smart one of the group.\n\nThe Lancer: Just as Tommy is the hero, Chuckie is the lancer.\n\nI Just Had To Say It: In \"Stu Gets a Job\", after accidentally giving Tommy an idea he said \"When am I ever gonna learn to keep my big mouth shut?\"\n\nIn another episode, he said \"I did it again.\"\n\nIn another, his friends look at him after saying something, he sighs and says \"I'll get the screwdriver.\"\n\nLovable Coward: Probably his defining characteristic. He proves himself to be brave when he's faced with door handles that resemble dragons, but he opens the doors to Notre Dame anyway.\n\nMissing Mom: HUGE Tear Jerker. On the lighter side of things, Chas eventually gets remarried, so he at least doesn't have to grow up without a mother figure in his life. There's no replacing her though.\n\nMorality Chain: Episodes like \"Rebel Without a Teddy Bear\", \"The Gold Rush\" and \"Chuckie's Wonderful Life\" strongly hint that Chuckie is this to the other babies.\n\nNice Guy\n\nOnly Child Syndrome: Until the second movie, that is.\n\nSensitive Guy and Manly Man: Sensitive Guy to Tommy's Manly Man.\n\nSurvival Mantra: \"I'm a big brave dog, I'm a big brave dog...\"\n\nPhil and Lil DeVille\n\nHalf-Identical Twins who are alike in every possible way, and even dressed to match. They represent the stage of infancy where babies are forever curious and try to eat and drink anything they can reach. Best known for their love of filth.\n\nBoth voiced by Kath Soucie\n\nTropes Associated With Phil and Lil:\n\nThe Smart Guy & The Lancer\n\nExtreme Omnivores: Worms, insects, boogers, toilet water-- anything is fair game.\n\nDivergent Character Evolution: The twins started off as basically the same character split in two, but later in the series Phil became a borderline Deadpan Snarker and Audience Surrogate, being the character that basically said what the audience was thinking.\n\nFull Name Ultimatum: When they argue, they usually address each other by their full first names (Phillip and Lillian).\n\nHalf-Identical Twins: The only physical difference between them is that Lil has free-hanging earlobes, something minor enough that most people, including their parents, don't notice.\n\nNightmare Fetishists: Very young versions.\n\nThe Pig Pen: Both of them.\n\nTalking To Herself: They both have the same voice as their mother.\n\nTertiary Sexual Characteristics: Phil wears pants, while Lil wears a dress and has a bow on her head.\n\nTheme Twin Naming\n\nAngelica Pickles\n\nSpoiled and bossy, Angelica is Tommy's cousin and serves as the main antagonist of the series. She hates Tommy and the other \"stupid babies\" and lives to make them miserable whenever they're in the same place.\n\nVoiced by Cheryl Chase\n\nTropes Associated With Angelica:\n\nBitch in Sheep's Clothing\n\nBlondes Are Evil\n\nBlue Eyes: In Preschool Daze.\n\nBirthday Hater: Due to the fear of the implications of growing up, Angelica behaves this way during her third birthday. In the end she regrets it when she realizes that, when growing up, she can eat candy with bigger teeth than the babies'.\n\nBratty Half-Pint\n\nThe Bully: To the babies, big time.\n\nButt Monkey: If you can believe this, Angelica, despite being the antagonist, gets her comeuppance alot(eg: sitting in time out and pizza falling on her hair, causing her to cry as she hates the stress of having her hair washed), but sometimes, she can be the show's buttmonkey, even when she isn't the antagonist!\n\nThe Chick\n\nCompanion Cube: Her Cynthia doll.\n\nCrying Wolf\n\nCharacter Development / Villain Decay: In the first season, Angelica was a total Jerkass that acted nice in front of the adults, but had strong hate for the babies and she somewhat mocked people behind their back (Graham Canyon is a great example of this, as when Drew tells Angelica to have a good time, after Angelica's polite response, she sticks her tongue out at Drew). In later seasons (namely two, but mostly, after the movie), she grows to like them and becomes a Jerk with a Heart of Gold, whereas she is still mischievous, but there's a nicer tone to it! (A great example of this is \"Grandpa Moves Out\", where instead of tricking Tommy and the gang into doing something bad, she was nothing, but friendly to Tommy and one of the first episodes to show her nicer side)\n\nDepending on the Writer: Is she a Jerkass Woobie (and maybe a Tsundere as well) or a flat out vile little brat whom dangerously borders on being a Villain Protagonist? It depends on how pleasant the writers are feeling about her at the time it still happens in All Grown Up! but to a much smaller extent.\n\nDevil in Plain Sight\n\nEven Angelica Has Standards: Unless she’s the one dashing it out, no one is to torment her cousins, Thomas (Tommy) and Dylan (Dil), and their friends and get away with it.\n\nShe's also won't allow physically harm on them either. When a kid called Josh was about to use Tommy and his friends as a landing pad, Angelica intervened.\n\nEnfant Terrible\n\nFluffy the Terrible: Not just her Right-Hand-Cat...\n\nFreudian Excuse: As an only child, she never had to share with others. And she's well-off, too.\n\nGirlish Pigtails\n\nHeel Face Revolving Door: She more or less treats the other babies like crap and has no qualms with freaking them out with random urban legends or stories, mostly to get something she wants. However, she ends up being a team player if something worse threatens them.\n\nHypocritical Heartwarming: As she says to Coco, \"Nobody messes with my dumb babies 'cept me!\"\n\nIronic Name: The name “Angelica” contains “angel”… she’s no angel, though she has her moments where she is.\n\nIt's All About Me\n\nJerkass: In season one only! But can still occasionally be this in later seasons.\n\nJerk with a Heart of Gold: Season two onwards. A great list of examples are: \"Grandpa Moves Out\", where Angelica wanted Tommy to tag along (even if it meant causing trouble), \"New Kid in Town\", where she was incredibly annoyed at how Josh (the new kid) treated them, so much that she pushed him over and he started to cry, and \"Rugrats in Paris\", when she was disgusted at how Coco treated the babies. Basically, she's not a jerk (the only season where she was a jerk was season one, really), rather, even though she calls the babies \"dumb\", she doesn't really mean it, and more than often wants to hang around with them (even Tommy).\n\nGranted she still has lots of Kick the Dog moments in later seasons and even if she's not as consistantly \"evil\" in depiction as she was early on she's still an obnoxious and selfish bully just with redeeming moments. Depending on the Writer comes a lot into play.\n\nLarge Ham: She often likes to see herself as quite the little performer lets just say.\n\nLaser-Guided Karma: Her title in this show could very much be \"karma's personal punching bag\"; in the event she does something that could be considered even vaguely unpleasant, karma is sure to be there to take her down a peg or two.\n\nNo Matter How Much I Beg: When she tries to give up cookies\n\nNightmare Fuel Station Attendant: Quite a lot of examples can be found on the Rugrats Nightmare Fuel page.\n\nOnly Child Syndrome: Unlike Tommy and Chuckie, she was this for the entire series.\n\nPet The Dog: She feels sympathy for Chuckie when he finds out that his father is marrying Coco.\n\nSpoiled Brat: Not much of one, but is only one when it comes to punishment. Although her parents do tend to punish her, they just really don't wanna break her heart.\n\nToken Evil Teammate\n\nTomboy and Girly Girl: Girly Girl to Susie's Tomboy.\n\nTrademark Favorite Food: \"Cookie\" was Angelica's first word.\n\nTsundere: Some of her \"nicer\" stories do occasionally give her these kind of vibes as well.\n\nSusie Carmicheal\n\nSusie moved across the street from Tommy early on in the series. A multi-talented, brave, and humble little girl, she served as the opposite of Angelica and often acted as The Rival to her. If Angelica was The Big Bad, Susie would be The Big Good.\n\nVoiced by Cree Summer\n\nTropes Associated With Susie:\n\nAffirmative Action Girl: Originally added to the cast when they noticed that not only were their mains mostly male (with one of the only two girls being, well, Angelica), they were also a sea of white. Luckily, Susie manages to avoid being a token through her Cool Big Sis persona.\n\nBlack Best Friend\n\nCharacterization Marches On: In her intitial appearances she interacted mainly with Tommy, and was kind of a drama queen and a crybaby, sharing Tommy's niavete and ineptness to the world around her. Not long after that, Susie and Angelica met and she became mostly defined by being the Anti-Angelica; mellow, intelligent and mature (at least for her young age).\n\nChild Prodigy: At age three, she is already multilingual.\n\nCool Big Sis: Ironically, Susie herself is the youngest of four children.\n\nFoil\n\nGood Counterpart: To Angelica.\n\nOut of Focus: Became less prominent as the series progressed, playing minor roles in the first two movies and making less appearances after the arrival of Dil.\n\nSassy Black Woman\n\nSixth Ranger: At first, but by the time Kimi was introduced, she became more or less The Mentor.\n\nTomboy and Girly Girl: Tomboy to Angelica's Girly Girl.\n\nX Must Not Win: While mostly a Good Counterpart to Angelica, Susie has been shown to be very rivalistic to her at times. Comes to an extreme in \"Tricycle Thief\" where she jumps to the immediate conclusion she stole her trike.\n\nDil Pickles\n\nTommy's little brother, who was born in The Movie. Unlike the others, he can't talk as well, so he's a baby even to the other babies. As a newborn, most of his time is spent sitting around and drooling.\n\nVoiced by Tara Strong\n\nTropes Associated With Dil:\n\nAmbiguous Disorder: One interpretation of his character, since other characters around his age are able to talk without a problem. (He is younger than the other characters, but not by much). He's perfectly capable of talking once he gets older though.\n\nAnnoying Younger Sibling: Tommy felt this way about him in the first movie (which wasn't unjustified, mainly because of what a jerk he was), but now they're as close as two peas in a pod.\n\nCousin Oliver:\n\nEmbarrassing Nickname: He calls Angelica \"Yucky\". Though that isn't unjustified given that she's the most unpleasant member of the cast.\n\nJerkass: He's this initially after being born, but he eventually grows out of it. One example of this is when he cheers Spike on as he battles the wolf.\n\nThe Nicknamer: Partially because he's so young and has no teeth, Dil has a nickname for almost all the babies he interacts with.\n\nPunny Name: While Tommy himself doesn't have one, Dil Pickles certainly does. For reference, it's \"Dil Pickle\".\n\nTagalong Kid\n\nKimi Finster\n\nFirst appearing in the second movie, Kimi is an adventurous girl whose mother married Chuckie's father, making her his step-sister.\n\nVoiced by Dionne Quan\n\nTropes Associated With Kimi:\n\nThe Ace\n\nBroken Pedestal: Kimi feels this way about Angelica when she's at her worst.\n\nCheerful Child\n\nCompanion Cube: Superthing.\n\nDistaff Counterpart: Was conceived as being a female Tommy, though she's a tad more impulsive than she is.\n\nFearless Fool: She tends to be rather naive. She wasn't wrong to wave towards Reptar though (as she knew the truth about him).\n\nGenki Girl\n\nGirlish Pigtails\n\nHair Color Dissonance: Black hair or purple?\n\nNice Shoes: Who knew they made cowboy boots for babies?\n\nNo Accounting for Taste: Non-romantic example; unlike the others, Kimi actually likes Angelica.\n\nSibling Yin-Yang: She's as fearless as Chuckie is fearful, though she makes it clear how much she loves her big brother.\n\nSixth Ranger\n\nAdults\n\nChaz Finster\n\nChuckie's equally cowardly father.\n\nVoice by Michael Bell\n\nTropes Associated With Chaz:\n\nBumbling Dad\n\nButt Monkey: Like father, like son.\n\nHappily Married: To Kira.\n\nNerd Glasses\n\nTalking to Himself: With Drew Pickles\n\nKira Finster\n\nShe is the mother of Kimi and step-mother of Chuckie. The (2nd) wife of Chaz.\n\nVoice by Julia Kato\n\nTropes Associated With Kira:\n\nBirds of a Feather: Though Kimi and Chuckie are an example of Sibling Yin-Yang, the same cannot be said for her and her husband Chaz. For starters, they both share the same love for poetry and they both enjoy the same poem. Incidentally, they both wear glasses.\n\nFoil: In the movie, she's this to Coco. She's pretty much everything that Coco pretended to be. And she doesn't hate children at all.\n\nFriend to All Children: This is the reason why she and Chuckie get along so well. And she doesn't carry out Coco's order to have Chuckie's teddy bear burned, knowing how important it is to him.\n\nHappily Married: To Chaz.\n\nHot Mom: Well, she wears glasses. But she's still attractive.\n\nMama Bear: Though she isn't Chuckie's mother in Rugrats In Paris, she acts like a mother to him in the movie. She goes out of the way to return the teddy bear that Coco took from him instead of having it burned like Coco wanted her to do. This is part of the reason why Chaz decides to marry her.\n\nStu Pickles\n\nThe father of Tommy and Dil, and husband of Didi. He's also the brother of Drew and uncle of Angelica.\n\nVoiced by Jack Riley.\n\nBumbling Dad: Not quite as extreme as other examples.\n\nBungling Inventor or Weekend Inventor\n\nDeadpan Snarker: At times.\n\nGeneration Xerox: Stu and Chaz were best friends since childhood as well, much like their own sons.\n\nDrew and Stu didn't get along at first, but they eventually warmed up to each other. The two of them argued with each other during the Rugrats Movie, but they are friendlier towards each other in other episodes. (For example, both of them wanted their brother to go first and argued over who would do so, which secretly worked in their favor as the golf course was a scam until the babies rectified it).\n\nLaser-Guided Amnesia: In the episode \"Regarding Stuie\" he hits his head and reverts to a baby-like state (which is ironic considering that the main cast themselves are babies). Another hit on the head brings him back to normal again.\n\nSibling Yin-Yang: With his brother Drew. Ironically, Tommy and Dil get along better (following the events of the movie).\n\nStraight Man and Wise Guy: Wise Guy to Drew's Straight Man.\n\nYou Gotta Have Blue Hair: Purple rather.\n\nDidi Pickles\n\nMother of Tommy and Dil, wife of Stu, and Angelica's aunt. A part time school teacher, who constantly consults a famous pediatrician for advice on how to raise the children.\n\nVoiced by Melanie Chartoff\n\nAnime Hair\n\nAuthor Avatar: Klasky based Didi off herself.\n\nBlind Without'Em: Something she shares with Chuckie.\n\nFiery Redhead: Averted, it's actually Betty whose more likely to lose her cool.\n\nInformed Judaism: Averted. She is revealed to be of Jewish descent, and the family is shown to celebrate Jewish holidays such as Hanukkah.\n\nDrew Pickles\n\nFather of Angelica, uncle of Tommy and Dil, and married to Charlotte. The opposite of his brother in almost every way, they do have their spats, but do care about each other.\n\nVoiced by Michael Bell.\n\nDoting Parent\n\nSibling Yin-Yang: To Stu.\n\nStoic Spectacles: Subverted.\n\nStraight Man and Wise Guy: Straight Man to Stu's Wise Guy.\n\nThe Workaholic: Implied.\n\nCharlotte Pickles\n\nMother of Angelica, aunt of Tommy and Dil, and married to Drew. She's the CEO of her own company and is frequently seen talking on a cell phone to an invisible assistant named Jonathan.\n\nVoiced by Tress MacNeille\n\nConvenient Miscarriage: Very possibly had one in \"Angelica's Worst Nightmare.\"\n\nHot Chick in a Badass Suit\n\nHot Mom\n\nMarried to the Job\n\nMissing Mom: Not entirely - she does try to be a good mom and does love her family, but is often sidetracked by her work. She can put her foot down with Angelica when the occasion's called for.\n\nThe Workaholic: Even when she's not working, she's blabbering on to her assistant Jonathan over a cell phone. She might be the first example of someone using a cell phone in such a manner so extensively in children's media.\n\nGrandpa Lou Pickles\n\nFather of Stu and Drew, and grandpa of Tommy, Dil and Angelica.\n\nCool Old Guy\n\nDecember-December Romance: With a nurse named Lulu. They even get married later!\n\nSenior Sleep Cycle\n\nMovie Characters\n\nCoco Labouche\n\nA woman (president of EuroReptar to be precise) who tries to trick Chaz into marrying her so that she can become president of Yamaguchi Industries. Voiced by Susan Sarandon, who also voiced Queen Narissa.\n\nBad Boss: This is a likely reason why Mr. Yamaguchi doesn't choose her to be the president of his company. No doubt her employees would eventually rally against her.\n\nBait the Dog: Her villainous friendship with Angelica. She makes promises to Angelica that she has no intention of keeping.\n\nBig Bad: She's the main villain of Rugrats in Paris.\n\nJerkass: Her defining moment of being one is when she decides to have Chuckie's teddy bear burned. The same teddy bear his late mother gave him.\n\nHate Sink: She's probably the most unlikable character tn the entire Rugrats series. Pretty much nobody likes her, especially not Chuckie. Even Angelica eventually starts to hate her.\n\nMeaningful Name: It's hinted that she has a sweet tooth for chocolate, especially expensive chocolate. She's not pleased when she finds out that Angelica decided to gorge herself on them.\n\nObviously Evil: She has an intimidating appearance. Even Dil realizes that she's a bad woman. The Rugrats catch on shortly afterwards as well.\n\nJean Claude\n\nCoco Labouche's assistant. Voiced by John Litghow, who also voiced Lord Farquaad."
