        "text": "This article is about the 1991 TV series. For the 2021 TV series, see Rugrats (2021 TV series).\n\nRugrats is an American animated television series created by Arlene Klasky, G치bor Csup칩, and Paul Germain for Nickelodeon. The series aired from August 11, 1991 to June 8, 2004. The show centers around four babies and the life and times of adventures through their eyes. It was one of the first three Nicktoons and also aired on Nick Jr. in 1996.\n\nPremise[]\n\nThe show originally revolved around a group of toddlers, Tommy Pickles, Chuckie Finster, and the twins Phil and Lil DeVille. The toddlers are able to communicate with each other through baby speak, although viewers can understand them, because it is 'translated'. Often, they mispronounce words or use poor grammar and their speaking is full of malapropisms. An example of this is using the word \"poopetrator\" instead of \"perpetrator.\"\n\nThe group is often reluctantly joined by Tommy's cousin, Angelica Pickles. At age three years old, Angelica is able to communicate and understand language from both the toddlers and the adults, which she often uses as an advantage when she wants to manipulate either party. She is usually very mean to the babies. Susie Carmichael, who lives across the street from the Pickles, is also able to communicate on the same level as Angelica, though she isn't manipulative. As a result, Angelica and Susie often clash.\n\nIn 1998, a new character was introduced. After The Rugrats Movie, in which Tommy's baby brother Dylan \"Dil\" Pickles is born, he was soon added as a character on the show. As a four month old baby, Dil is not able to communicate with anyone. Later in 2000, after Rugrats in Paris: The Movie was released, Kimi Finster was added as a character. She is Chuckie's stepsister. The only regular children who are potty-trained are Angelica, Susie, and Chuckie, and up until the episode Chuckie vs. the Potty, he also wore diapers.\n\nList of Rugrats characters\n\nRugrats episode list\n\nProduction[]\n\nRugrats was Nickelodeon's second Nicktoon. The series was in production from 1991 to 1994, and again from 1996 to 2004. It aired in Nickelodeon's Snick block from 1997-2000. It is the longest lasting Nicktoon to date, at over fourteen years longevity. The Rugrats received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in a ceremony on June 28, 2001.\n\nThe show airs in the UK on CBBC, CITV, Nicktoons, Nickelodeon UK and Nicktoonsters as well as in Canada on YTV. In Australia, it can be seen on Nickelodeon Australia (and, for a period, ABC Television).\n\nOn August 11, 2001, Rugrats celebrated its 10 year anniversary. The special/TV movie, \"Rugrats: All Growed Up\" was produced for the occasion. After the show, a special retrospective lookback aired, entitled Rugrats: Still Babies After All These Years. It was narrated by Amanda Bynes.\n\nThe show ended in 2004 then afterwards, two fairy tale themed direct-to-video films based on the original series under the title, \"Rugrats: Tales from the Crib\" were planned and then released separately in 2005 and in 2006.\n\nTheatrical films[]\n\nIn 1998, the first Rugrats film was released, entitled The Rugrats Movie, which introduced baby Dil, Tommy's little brother, onto the show. In 2000 the second movie, Rugrats in Paris, was released, with two new characters introduced, Kimi and Kira. Kimi would become Chuckie's sister and Kira would become his new mother, after marrying his father. In 2003, the third movie, Rugrats Go Wild, was released. It was a crossover between the Rugrats and The Wild Thornberrys.\n\nSpin Offs[]\n\nMain article:All Grown Up!\n\nMain article:Angelica and Susie's Pre-School Daze\n\nMain article:The Carmichaels"
