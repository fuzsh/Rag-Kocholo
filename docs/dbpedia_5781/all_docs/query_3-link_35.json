        "text": "Rugrats is coming back in a brand new CG-style animation. The new show has debuted on May 27 on Paramount + and Nickelodeon.\n\nThe original 2D series Rugrats had received multiple Daytime Emmys for animated program, a half-a-dozen Kids Choice Awards and its very own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame when it went off the air in 2006. The series has delighted its audience for a decade and is still the second-longest running animated series on Nickelodeon (“SpongeBob SquarePants” being the longest).\n\nIn an article recently published, Variety tells everything about the new animation style and the new technologies that have been applied in the 2021 version of the award-winning franchise. A great project on which our teams in Bangalore have closely collaborated."
