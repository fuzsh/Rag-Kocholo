        "text": "'Rugrat's still\n\nThose who grew up in the '90s likely look back at the Nickelodeon cartoon series Rugrats with fond memories. But this is a fair warning for nostalgic viewers: Stop reading now if you want to keep it that way.\n\nA dark fan theory about what Rugrats (supposedly) is really about is circulating on social media. Because as TikTok user @masonide explained, nearly all the children featured on the beloved show—except for Angelica—are actually dead.\n\n\"Tommy was a stillborn, and that's why his dad Stu is always in the basement making toys for a kid that doesn't exist in regret and sadness,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, \"Chuckie died several years ago with his mom, which is why his dad is a nervous wreck all of the time.\"\n\nThe TikTok user explained that twins Phil and Lil DeVille didn't exist, either.\n\n\"The DeVilles with twins Phil and Lil, they had an abortion,\" he said. \"Because this is Angelica's imagination, she didn't know the sex of the baby. So they're twins.\"\n\nView the original article to see embedded media.\n\n\"Dil was definitely real, though,\" he relented. \"But Dil couldn't speak, why? Because Angelica kept hitting him in the head, giving him brain damage and permanent issues.\"\n\nThe TikTok user says Susie Carmichael is Angelica's real friend who simply \"went along with\" Angelica's imagination.\n\nAnd in the spinoff series, All Grown Up!, Angelica was apparently \"dabbling in recreational drug use to not be lonely.\"\n\nAlthough the \"Rugrats Never Happened\" theory first circulated on Tumblr years ago, it started making its rounds on TikTok in recent months—horrifying fans all over again in the process."
