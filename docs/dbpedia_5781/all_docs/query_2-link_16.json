        "text": "Tommy Pickles\n\nAge: 1\n\nSex: Male\n\nDescription: Very little hair; blue shirt; disposable diapers; bare feet; no pants\n\nFirst Appearance: Tommy Pickles And The Great White Thing\n\nFirst Televised Appearance: Tommy's First Birthday\n\nVoiced By: Tami Holbrook (pilot only), E.G. Daily\n\nTommy Pickles is a born (no pun intended) adventurer. He leads the other Rugrats on imaginary adventures -- to the North Pole; in the Jungle; inside Chuckie; in the Wild West; anywhere a baby's imagination would take him. He also sticks up for the Rugrats against other bullies, especially Angelica. He is also the Rugrats' contraband expert, keeping things the baby's not allowed to have in his diapers (tools, birds, CD's, even Reptar bars), as well as an expert in breaking out of the crib, using a screwdriver he always keeps hidden. He is also Dil's big brother, helping him out when he gets in trouble, and teaching him how to be a Rugrat. A leader in his own right.\n\nTen years from \"now\": He'll have a full head of purple hair, just like his dad, Stu. He'll also wear a white shirt with long, blue sleeves; jeans; and green tennis shoes. And like his dad, he'll be a whiz at science -- his pickle experiment wowed his class.\n\nIn addition to doing various cartoon voices (including Tommy, of course), E.G. Daily (the \"E.G.\" stands for \"Elizabeth Guttman\") is a female rock star, who, in the mid-1980s, had 2 albums released by A&M Records -- \"Lace Around The Wound\" & \"Wild Child\"; in addition to singing on those albums, she has also co-wrote and co-produced them. E.G. Daily is also the only Rugrats cast member to appear on Saturday Night Live; she was the 2nd of 2 musical guests on the May 17, 1986 episode (Level 42 was the 1st that night); newspaper columnist Jimmy Breslin was guest host.\n\nAround this time, one of these songs she had co-written (with Harold Faltermeyer), Love In The Shadows (from her \"Wild Child\" album), was sung in French as Délivre-moi (Set Me Free) by Céline Dion on her Incognito album (1987).\n\nIn May 1999, Daily returned to her musical roots with a CD called Tearing Down The Walls, released by Sumthing Distribution and co-produced by Daily, along with Grammy-Award winner Brad Gilderman and Harvey Mason Jr. This CD, which has received rave reviews from fellow Daily fans, is available from Amazon.com, and at record stores everywhere. Daily also performed live on 7/18/1999 at the Phoenix, AZ stop of Sarah McLachlan's Lilith Fair, a tour that showcases the best in women's pop music.\n\n(Cover from Amazon.Com; ©1999 E.G. Daily Productions & Sumthing Distribution.)\n\nWhen she's not singing, Daily contributes her voice to cartoons, commercials and movies. For example, Daily replaced Christine Cavanaugh (Rugrats co-star) as the voice of Babe in Babe: Pig In The City, after Cavanaugh chose not to reprise the role for personal reasons (originally, there were rumors that Cavanaugh asked for more money, but a Washington Post interview with Cavanaugh debunked those rumors). On TV, Daily can also be regularly heard on Cartoon Network's Powerpuff Girls, where she plays one of them, Buttercup. She's also seen on various live-action TV programs as well, as a guest star on TV series ranging from CHiPs to Friends. Her only appearance as a regular on a live-action series was on The Righteous Apples, which was seen in the late-1970s and early-1980s on PBS and, later, the Showtime pay channel; that series was about a rock band living and practicing in an inner-city neighborhood. She also appeared in a few movies during the 1980s, her most-notable role being Dottie, Pee-Wee Herman's girlfriend in Pee-Wee's Big Adventure.\n\nDylan Prescott \"Dil\" Pickles\n\nAge: Up to 4 weeks old in The Rugrats Movie; 3 months old in the TV series\n\nGiven Birthdates: 11/20/1998 for theatrical release; 3/30/1999 for video release (both in US & Canada)\n\nSex: Male\n\nDescription: Curly (yet limited) hair, big ears, frequently wears \"trap-door\" pajamas.\n\nFirst Appearance: The Rugrats Movie\n\nFirst TV Appearance: Chuckie's Duckling\n\nVoiced by: Tara Strong (formerly Charendoff)\n\nNamed after Didi's cousin, Dylan Prescott, Dil is Tommy's new baby brother, and the bane to the other Rugrats' existence.\n\nTen years from \"now\": He'll have a full head of curly, red hair, like his mom, Didi; he'll also wear a yello, long-sleeved shirt; jeans; and blue tennis shoes. Also, he'll be less selfish and more appreciative of Tommy and his friends.\n\nCharles Crandall \"Chuckie\" Finster, Jr. (III)\n\nAge: 2\n\nSex: Male\n\nDescription: Uncombed red hair; square-framed glasses; 3 freckles on each cheek; bucked teeth; blue, short-sleeved sweatshirt with a planet on the front; green shorts with green-yellow rectangles; yellow socks; eternally-untied red sneakers.\n\nFirst Appearance: Tommy's First Birthday\n\nVoiced By: Christine Cavanaugh (1991-2001), Nancy Cartwright (2002 to date)\n\nChuckie is a nerdy, yet cute, little boy who is always afraid to take risks, but always ends up going along with the other Rugrats on their adventures. In the outcome, Chuckie end up being very brave, willing to do things like going down slides, using the toilet, being a superhero, etc. Chuckie is also Tommy's best friend; he looks up to him for advice.\n\nTen years from \"now\": He'll still have long, uncombed hair and a planet on his shirt, though his shirt will now be a short-sleeved, collared, button-down shirt. He'll also be wearing jeans, square-framed glasses, and red teenis shows -- still untied. Most importantly, he'll have braces on his teeth, which he has to wear for about 2.5 years. He will eventually overcome all his fears. But he will have a new fear that he'll have to face -- a fear of girls.\n\n2. The only other person to voice Chuckie was Nancy Cartwright, who assumed the role in 2002. A native of Dayton, Ohio, Nancy is more well-known as the voice of Bart Simpson on Fox's hit TV series, The Simpsons. Nancy has done various voices for animated shows and movies. Also, she was no stranger to Rugrats -- previously, she was the voice of Prudence, \"The Junk Food Kid\", in Showdown At Teeter-Totter Gulch in 1992, and she was various minor voices in The Wild Wild West / Angelica For A Day in 1998.\n\nShe is also one of few people who not only voices cartoons, she animates them as well -- she's the founder of Happy House Productions, an animation firm.\n\nCartwright assumed the role after Cavanaugh's retirement, and will be the voice of Chuckie during the 2002 season, and, likely, the upcoming Rugrats / Thornberrys film.\n\nFor more on Nancy Cartwright, see her official website.\n\nLeft: Nancy Cartwright and her well-known alter ego, Bart Simpson, on the cover of her biography, My Life As A 10-Year-Old Boy; from Amazon.Com. ©2001 Nancy Cartwright and Hyperion. Bart Simpson is © Fox.\n\nKimi Watanabe-Finster\n\nAge: 1 1/2\n\nSex: Female\n\nDescription: Asian; dark hair in 3 pigtails; yellow or green jumper with a blue cat on front; diapers; cowboy boots\n\nFirst Appearance: Rugrats In Paris\n\nFirst TV Appearance: Finsterella (US); Angelicon (Canada)\n\nVoiced By: Dionne Quan\n\nKimi will become Chuckie's new sister when Chazz, his father, marries Kira, her single mother, in the Rugrats In Paris film. Unlike her new big brother, Kimi is brave, but unlike another brave Rugrat, Tommy, she often takes action first and thinks later.\n\nTen years from \"now\": She'll have only one pigtail instead of three. Also, she'll wear a pink and yellow, short-sleeved shirt; green pants with pink and yellow triangles at the cuffs; and purple shoes.\n\nNote:\n\nUnlike the other Rugrats voices, Dionne Quan, the voice of Kimi, is legally blind, though she can still see, but barely -- since birth, she had a brain disorder, which was later diagnosed as hypoplasia (underdevelopment) of the optic nerve. Because of this, her sight is severely impaired -- she can only make out some colors and shapes; she can also watch Rugrats and other TV shows to the best of her ability, though to do that, she had to press her face on the picture tube.\n\nIn order to do the voice, the producers had to translate the scripts into Braille, so she could read them by feeling the bumps with her fingers.\n\nDionne can also be heard on The Wild Thornberrys, and other animated programs and commercials.\n\nFormerly from in Benicia, CA, near San Francisco, she moved to Los Angeles in early 2001.\n\n(additional material from People Weekly, 12/11/2000)\n\n(Left: Dionne Quan, from The Asian Rugrat; original source unknown. © 2001 Viacom.)\n\nAngelica C. Pickles\n\nAge: 3\n\nSex: Female\n\nDescription: Blonde with 2 pig-tails; red-and-black-striped shirt with flared cuffs; purple jumper (a midriff-type skirt); blue tights with green dots; red socks; purple sneakers; diapers (?) (1991 episodes only).\n\nFirst Appearance: Tommy's First Birthday\n\nVoiced By: Cheryl Chase\n\nAngelica is Drew and Charlotte's spoiled-brat daughter who always bullies around the other Rugrats. Often using her doll, Cynthia, as accomplice, Angelica often gets away with everything. If she does get caught, her parents often let Angelica go unpunished, though Stu and Didi often punish her when she's at Tommy's.\n\nTen years from \"now\": She'll have long, unbraided hair; purple shirt with long sleeves; polka-dot skirt; green earrings; and purple clog shoes. She'll also be just as bossy then as she is now.\n\nPhilip \"Phil\" Deville\n\nand\n\nLillian Marie Jill \"Lil\" DeVille\n\nSex: Phil: Male; Lil: Female\n\nAges: 1 1/2 (both)\n\nDescriptions: Phil: Small bit of brown hair; pink and black-striped shirt; overalls with a polka-dotted hankerchief on the left side and a duck on the right; blue shorts; white socks; blue shoes; no ear lobes (episodes from 1996 to early 1999 and The Rugrats Movie show Phil with ear lobes like Lil). Lil: Same as Phil with these differences: addition of pink bow; shirt sleeves more \"puffed\"; jumper (similar to Phil's overalls); diapers instead of pants; pink shoes; ear lobes.\n\nFirst Appearances: Tommy Pickles And The Great White Thing\n\nFirst Television Appearances: Tommy's First Birthday\n\nVoiced By: Kath Soucie (both)\n\nPhil and Lil are fraternal twins (identical traits, but different sexes). They often play around with Tommy and the other Rugrats. They love consuming gross stuff like worms (which they first call \"Chocolate Spaghetti\") and toilet water. They frequently get into arguments, often using their actual names, Plillip and Lillian. Finally, despite the above differences, their parents often get them mixed up, despite permanent differences like the ears (except in newer episodes, when both have ear lobes), as well as another, though more obvious difference that I won't be discussing here (Nick hasn't mentioned it, so I won't either).\n\nIt should be noted that Lil is Phil's older sister -- by two minutes.\n\nTen years from \"now\": They will no longer dress the same -- Phil will now wear a red, short-sleeved, collared shirt over a green t-shirt with a picture of a duck on it (just like their earlier jumpers), along with green jeans and tennis shoes; Lil will be wearing a pink sweater over a duck t-shirt (just like Phil's) with a blue skirt and pink shoes. They'll be as inseparable then as they are now.\n\nSusie Carmichael\n\nAge: 3 years\n\nSex: Female\n\nDescription: African-American; black hair; yellow dress with polka-dots.\n\nFirst Apprearance: Meet The Carmichaels\n\nVoiced By: Cree Summer Francks (credited as Cree Summer Francks in 1992; Cree Summer all other shows)); E.G. Daily (The Last Babysitter & Angelica's Birthday only)\n\nSusie, the first (and, so far, only) black Rugrat, is, more or less, the exact opposite of Angelica (Susie is Angelica's enemy); she's always nice to others.\n\nTen years from \"now\": Shell have curly, unbraided hair, with a headband. She'll also be wearing a red and pink floral shirt (though publicity pics had the colors the usual purple and yellow); purple pants; purple shoes; and earrings similar to the ends of the braids that she had ten years earlier. She'll make a living as a babysitter. More specifically, Tommy & Dil's babysitter.\n\nCree was born on July 7, 1969 in Los Angeles; her father is famed Canadian actor Don Francks, whose wife is dancer Lili Red Eagle, a member of the Plains Cree First Nations. Shortly after their birth, her family moved to a First Nations reservation near Battleford, Sasketchewan (245 miles NW of Regina; 242 miles east of Edmonton), as they felt she was better off growing in a native Canadian atmosphere, rather than in Hollywood. After being kicked off the reservation in 1975, her family lived on a bus, in a horse stable, in a commune and with friends before settling in Toronto, where, in 1982, she took up voice acting in cartoons, with a little help from her father. She also joined a band, where she developed her musical abilities. In 1987, after becoming 18, she moved back to LA, where she continued her musical and voice-acting career.\n\nAs with E.G. Daily, Summer also has musical talent as a sideline. Since 1986, she was featured in gigs at various clubs in the GTA (Greater Toronto Area); she was also the lead singer in a rock group, \"Subject To Change\", which gigged and toured with other bands in the 1990s. Her latest musical effort is a solo one -- her first album, Street Faërie, which was released on Sony's Epic Records label in April 1999. When she's not doing voices for cartoons, you can usually find her in concert, as an opening act for top acts such as Lenny Kravitz, Black Crowes and Everlast."
