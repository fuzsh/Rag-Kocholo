        "text": "Nickelodeon's 'Rugrats' Toddle Toward Milestone 10th Anniversary, Kicking Off Year-Long Celebration With Primetime Season Premiere on Monday, January 15\n\nSix-Hour Rugrats Marathon Culminates With Momentous Premiere Featuring Newest Baby in the Bunch, Kimi, in her TV Debut - and Dual Adoption of Chuckie and Kimi\n\nLOS ANGELES, Dec. 18 2000 -- Toddling home on the heels of a triumphant trip to Paris, Nickelodeon's Rugrats don't just kick off a new season of rug-up adventures on Monday, January 15 (8 p.m. ET/PT), they wiggle toward an amazing milestone with a new playmate. Rugrats in Paris' Kimi (voiced by Dionne Quan) makes her TV debut in the season premiere, and the diapered tots turn 10 in 2001 amid yearlong hoopla. A season packed with programming events ensues with a six-hour Rugrats marathon (2-8 p.m. ET/PT) capped off by the season premiere.\n\nIn addition, the new season's episodes, which will air on Saturdays (7:30 p.m. ET/PT), feature a new opening title sequence for the first time since Rugrats hit the airwaves in August 1991. The updated sequence showcases the full cast of babies frolicking, including the newest arrivals, Kimi, Dil and Susie, and an energized arrangement of the show's theme music.\n\n``During the past decade, 'Rugrats' has evolved from a ratings powerhouse, being the number one children's show on TV, to pop icon status. And it has secured a place in the hearts of both kids and adults, who see it from their own point of view,'' says Cyma Zarghami, Executive Vice President and General Manager of Nickelodeon.\n\nFresh from their second big-screen venture, the babies get to know Chuckie Finster's new stepsister Kimi and her mom Kira (voiced by Julia Kato) -- who they met in Rugrats in Paris -- on home ground. In the season opener titled Finsterella, Angelica plants seeds of doubt and fear in Chuckie's mind about his future with a new stepmother and stepsister, and he dreams about a ghastly fate in which he works his fingers to the bone, catering to Angelica and Kimi's every whim, while the other babies get ready for a lavish[, yet wonderful and poignant] soiree... in which Kira and Charles celebrate the adoption of each other's child.\n\nRugrats' celebratory programming events will continue throughout February and March with telecasts of every episode of the series. Viewers will be invited to rate them online at nick.com, and their 10 all-time favorites ultimately will air in a marathon preceding the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards in April.\n\nSince premiering in 1991, Rugrats has emerged as a TV phenomenon and three-time Emmy Award winner. The show's classic animated characters offer a broad audience base appeal, creating an enormous following of kids and adults alike. Rugrats finished its fourth straight year as the highest rated kids program on broadcast and cable. In addition, it has been the highest rated kids show on cable seven straight years and is the highest rated property among all kids programs for both Boys 2-11 and Girls 2-11. The most watched program on Nickelodeon, Rugrats reaches a total of 26.7 million viewers each week. This includes 14.7 million Kids 2-11, 3.2 million Teens 12-17, and 8.8 million Adults 18+. In addition, Rugrats is seen internationally in over 75 countries. In November of 1998, the diapered tots made their feature film debut in The Rugrats Movie, which took the nation by storm by earning the top box office gross during its opening weekend. This winter, they headed overseas on a terrific new journey in Rugrats in Paris: The Movie, another box-office smash from Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies, which has earned more than $60 million domestically to date.\n\n'Rugrats' Crawl to New Heights to Celebrate 10th Anniversary -- Viewers' 10 All-Time Favorite Episodes Will Comprise 'Rugrats' Marathon, Saturday, April 21, Preceding 'Kids' Choice Awards'\n\nTime-Travelling Tots Will Be Tweens for a Day in Climactic Anniversary Special, Saturday, July 21\n\nLOS ANGELES, Apr 13, 2001 -- A decade has flown by in a burp and a hiccup since Nickelodeon's \"Rugrats\" debuted, and as the perennial babies scurry toward their milestone 10th anniversary this year, they'll fill a tall programming order with April's \"Rugrats\" marathon. Moreover, they'll grow to unprecedented heights above rug level in July's one-hour, primetime anniversary special, when the time-travelling tots will be tweens for a day.\n\n\"As the 'Rugrats' turn 10, it is clear they are in a category all their own. Seven years as the top-rated kids' show proves that this unique property has staying power like no other,\" says Cyma Zarghami, Executive Vice President and General Manager of Nickelodeon.\n\n\"Rugrats'\" yearlong celebratory programming events [included] telecasts of every episode of the series ever produced... from January 1 - March 31 -- and a special anniversary marathon of viewers' all-time 10 favorites[, chosen by an online poll, on] Saturday, April 21 (4:30-8 p.m. ET/PT).\n\nThe celebration climaxes with the hour-long primetime special on Saturday, July 21 [at 8PM ET], in which the diapered tots travel 10 years into the \"foocher\" with Tommy's time machine and become \"tweens\" for a day. Audiences will have a one-time-only glimpse above and beyond the playpen at Angelica, Chuckie, Tommy and the whole gang, as they prepare to attend their first concert.\n\nA home video titled \"Decade in Diapers\" -- \"Rugrats'\" 10th Anniversary Collector's Edition featuring kids' 10 favorite episodes -- will be available in stores this summer individually or as a two-volume boxed set with a companion book version of the fantasy episode, \"All Growed Up\". In addition, a third home video will feature the \"All Growed Up\" episode.\n\n[Note -- The All Growed Up video will also feature My Fair Babies. The videos will be released August 7; they'll retail for US$12.95 each.-- SM]\n\nNickelodeon Teams Up With Embassy Suites Hotels for Three-Year, $20 Million Ad and Promotional Deal\n\nLeading Upscale All-Suite Hotel Brand Looks to Number One Kids Brand to Reinforce its Position as the Premier Family-Friendly Hotel Brand\n\nNEW YORK, Nov. 21 2000 -- In an unprecedented deal marking the importance of kids' influences on family vacation destinations, Embassy Suites Hotels has contracted with Nickelodeon for a three-year, $20 million advertising and promotions agreement starting in May 2001. The announcement was made by James Perry, vice president - sales and business development for Nickelodeon, and Mark Snyder, senior vice president - brand management for Embassy Suites Hotels.\n\n``We are thrilled to be working with a leader in the hotel industry who shares our commitment to kids and understands the power of the Nickelodeon brand,'' said Perry. ``Representing Nickelodeon's first exclusive major hotel partner, Embassy Suites Hotels is another example of a non-traditional brand that realizes the value of marketing to kids. In the past year, Ford Motors Division and Gateway computers have added Nickelodeon to their marketing plans. We see this trend continuing to include an even broader array of categories like retail, apparel, financial and more.''\n\n``The leading upscale all-suite hotel brand for business and leisure travelers, Embassy Suites Hotels has teamed up with Nickelodeon, the #1 kids' entertainment brand, to further demonstrate its position as a family-friendly hotel brand,'' said Snyder. ``Embassy Suites Hotels already are attractive destinations to families who are drawn to the two-room suites, in-room kitchenettes and indoor swimming pools; merchandising with Nickelodeon enables us to catapult our efforts to provide a fun experience to families staying at our all-suite hotels.''\n\nEmbassy Suites Hotels' decision to team up with Nickelodeon can be attributed to the fact that children play a major role in influencing family decisions. More than 40% of all adult purchases (over $150 billion) are influenced by children, according to a study by Penn, Shoen & Berland. The study also found that 95% of kids can name at least one hotel chain. Sixty-five percent prefer staying at a specific hotel and 56% believe their parents take their opinions of hotels seriously.\n\nThe agreement between Embassy Suites Hotels and Nickelodeon includes: a co-branded summer promotion and a sweepstakes promotion during 2001; and three co-branded promotions each year during 2002 and 2003 supporting Nickelodeon programming. Embassy Suites Hotels will advertise its kid-friendly amenities and services on Nickelodeon and both parties will create point-of-entry and point-of-sale materials to support joint promotions.\n\nThe first co-branded initiative kicking off in the summer of 2001 is Embassy Suites Hotels' summer retail promotion geared towards families, which will feature a Nickelodeon theme, including Rugrats games and merchandise. To help celebrate the 10th Anniversary of the Rugrats television show, each family will receive a Nickelodeon premium offering upon check-in at an Embassy Suites Hotel. Embassy Suites Hotels' Nickelodeon-themed Rugrats promotion will be supported on air on Nickelodeon as well as other print cable and broadcast outlets targeted to adults.\n\nEmbassy Suites Hotels Offers First-Ever Nickelodeon-Themed 'Nickelodeon Summer Trip Pack' During Weekend Stays Beginning June 1\n\nMEMPHIS, Tenn., May 31 2001 /PRNewswire/ -- Reservations are heating up for Nickelodeon Summer Trip Pack weekends at Embassy Suites Hotels, thepremier hotel brand of upscale, all-suite properties, for stays beginning June 1 through September 16.\n\nFamilies staying Friday, Saturday or Sunday night at any of more than 150 participating Embassy Suites Hotels in the continental United States will receive a Nickelodeon-themed premium at check-in, included in the suite rate.
