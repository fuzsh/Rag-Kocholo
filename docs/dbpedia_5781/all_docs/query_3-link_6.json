        "text": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- We've watched them overcome their paralyzing fear of car washes. We've seen them deal with the death of a cherished bug and learn the true meaning of friendship and sharing.\n\nNow the beloved tots on \"Rugrats\" have a whole new batch of comic adventures to look forward to as -- ready for this? -- tweens on \"All Grown Up,\" a spinoff of one of TV's most popular kid shows.\n\nIn the new weekly series (Nickelodeon), the familiar gang is all there -- bossy Angelica; take-charge Tommy; his best buddy, Chuckie; devilish twins Phil and Lil; adventurous Kimi; and Tommy's little brother, Dil.\n\nAs older characters, however, they now face such classic preteen issues as school-yard crushes, first haircuts, identity crises and how to raise enough money to see a hot boy band in concert.\n\nTheir personalities are also somewhat different.\n\nAngelica, for instance, is much more vulnerable and subject to peer pressure.\n\n\"She doesn't have the advantage of being the only one who talks anymore,\" notes Marjorie Cohn, Nickelodeon's senior vice president of original programming and development. \"She can't trick her cousins anymore.\"\n\nAt 10, Tommy is not always the group's fearless leader and isn't nearly as gung-ho as he was as a pigeon-toed baby. A smitten Chuckie adopts an alter ego named \"Chongo\" to win the affections of a girl who doesn't even know \"Chuckie\" exists. Meanwhile, Lil is starting to establish her own identity and personality apart from Phil.\n\n\"Lil and Phil still have an incredible bond, but they're not the bookends they used to be,\" Cohn says.\n\nThe idea for the 35-episode series, tentatively scheduled to air over three seasons, was born out of Nickelodeon's wildly successful \"All Growed Up\" special.\n\nWhen the 10th anniversary \"Rugrats\" special aired in July 2001, an impressive 70 percent of kids aged 2 to 11 tuned in.\n\nIt didn't take long for Nickelodeon and the \"Rugrats' \" producers to figure out they had another potential hit series in the making.\n\n\"It felt like a natural progression and something that our audience really wanted,\" says Lora Lee, a \"Rugrats\" producer. \"It's a show that stands on its own and has its own special quality.\"\n\nSince debuting in 1991, \"Rugrats\" has become a pop culture phenomenon and a bona-fide Nickelodeon cash cow as it has spawned two theatrical movies (\"The Rugrats Movie\" and \"Rugrats in Paris\") and a wide array of toys, videos games, DVDs, soundtracks, books and apparel.\n\nThe four-time Emmy winner was the top show on broadcast and cable among kids 2 to 11 from 1996-2001 and the highest rated kids' show on cable for eight consecutive years. \"Rugrats,\" seen in over 150 countries, is currently the country's fourth highest-rated kid program.\n\nCohn admits \"Rugrats\"\" popularity raised the spinoff bar pretty high.\n\n\"As much as people want to see a new show, they're married to the characters exactly the way they are,\" she says. \"Our mission was to figure out how to evolve the characters and stay true to what the viewers loved so much. It was hard because part of the charm about a series with babies was that they didn't know anything.\"\n\nE.G. Daily, the voice of Tommy and the mother of two girls, 5 and 7, knew she couldn't wait for the new show to begin production.\n\n\"We were all really happy about it,\" says Daily, who has costarred in such films as \"Pee-Wee's Big Adventure\" and \"Fandango.\" \"It just meant that 'Rugrats' would keep growing.\"\n\nDaily has a pretty cushy gig and works an average of only three hours a week. She says her approach to voicing Tommy in \"All Grown Up\" had to be slightly modified.\n\n\"He's still the same guy and his voice has the same kind of squeaky, scratchy quality, only more mature,\" says Daily, who has volunteered at orphanages to observe kids' behavior for \"Rugrats.\" \"It's like turning the radio dial to a higher volume.\"\n\nAfter 12 years of doing Tommy, Daily says she's still asked by her daughters' friends to do his voice.\n\n\"They like to show me off quite a bit,\" she says.\n\nNickelodeon is certainly eager to show off its new series.\n\nSays Cohn: \"There's a feeling that kids who grew up on 'Rugrats' have a real vested interest in seeing this version of 'Rugrats' as well.\""
