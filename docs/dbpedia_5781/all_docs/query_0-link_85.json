        "text": "Rugrats debuts on 8/11/1991 at 10AM ET & repeated at 8:30PM . There were no ads or pictures heralding its arrival in this TVG, but it had a description:\n\n\"An animated view from down underfoot is provided by Tommy Pickles and several diaper-clad tots, who journey into the grown-up world. In this episode, Tommy explores the bathroom's surroundings.\"\n\nPlease note that this was the description of the 7 1/2 minute pilot, which was never seen on Nick. Tommy's First Birthday was the first televised episode.\n\nSide Note: Melanie Chartoff, the voice of Didi, also played Ms. Musso, the principal on Fox's Parker Lewis Can't Lose, which started its 2nd season at 7:30PM ET, an hour before Rugrats.\n\nJeff Jarvis reviews Rugrats in his article, \"I Love TV\"; in a segment on cartoons, he compares The Simpsons with Rugrats:\n\n\"When The Simpsons was a segment on The Tracey Ullman Show, it was just a belch joke with hip pretensions. As a series, it grew flesh and guts. It was my favorite cartoon...until I discovered Nickelodeon's Rugrats, a wry, sly, kid's eye view of the world that skewers thirtysomething parents and (The) Cosby (Show) kids.\"\n\nNo pictures."
