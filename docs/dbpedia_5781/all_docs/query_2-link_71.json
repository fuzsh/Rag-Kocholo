        "text": "Kimiko \"Kimi\" Watanabe-Finster is a main character in the Nickelodeon animated television series Rugrats. She first appeared in Rugrats in Paris: The Movie in 2000. She is the stepsister of Chuckie Finster; born in a Japanese family, she was the last character to be introduced to the Rugrats character list. Her mother, Kira, married Chas Finster, the father of Chuckie. Kimi became a regular character on the show after Rugrats in Paris: The Movie. She also appeared in the second and third Rugrats films and is voiced by Dionne Quan in the two movies and the original series, and Charlet Chung in the 2021 CGI revival series.\n\nDescription\n\nKimi Finster met the Rugrats when they were on vacation in Paris, France at Euro-Reptarland, where her mother Kira used to work. Now living with her big brother Chuckie in America, Kimi is always ready to use her imagination to lead the Rugrats on a fun-filled adventure. Armed with her favorite toy \"Superthing\" and a big smile, Kimi will be the first one ready to boldly go where no baby has ever gone before. This sometimes puts pressure on Chuckie, who feels he has to look out for his little sister, which can be kind of hard when she's scared of nothing, and he's scared of everything! - Rugrats Description from Klasky Csupo\n\nSummary\n\nKimi was the last addition to the cast of Rugrats, making her first appearance in the second Rugrats movie, Rugrats in Paris: The Movie. She is very joyful and brave. She was introduced as Chuckie's new sister, after her mother, Kira, married Chuckie's father Charles, also known as Chas. This marriage and the changes it brought to the Finster family were used in the series to teach the young viewers, by demonstration, about adapting to such drastic changes caused by remarriage.\n\nIn Rugrats, the one-and-a-half-year-old Kimi is portrayed as very brave and often stumbles into dangerous situations she is too naïve to recognize, often bringing her new brother, Chuckie Finster, along, which he doesn't like very much. He describes her as \"another Tommy\" not too long upon her arrival. She is just as adventurous as Tommy and cares for her friends. Unlike Tommy, she often takes action first and thinks later. She laughs in the eye of danger and is always looking for an adventure.\n\nDumb Qualities\n\nLike Dil, Kimi was also one of the reasons that Rugrats was going downhill even further than ever.\n\nShe is another annoying character as her normal baby antics usually cause some trouble for her brother and their friends, and due to her walking and talking, can cause even more trouble than Dil.\n\nSome of the trouble she causes is bad, such as taking Cynthia without Angelica’s permission and throwing her up the treehouse, which unsurprisingly leads to Angelica angrily chasing the babies.\n\nMuch like Dil, her crying can be annoying, depending on your view.\n\nShe often likes to mess around with her brother, and she often gets on Chuckie’s nerves, especially when she messes with his stuff, sometimes by accident.\n\nChuckie refers to her as \"Another Tommy\" (he said this in Rugrats in Paris), which is in a bad way because Tommy has a more lovable personality, is a better brother to Dil, and even knows when his leadership goes too far as he understands Chuckie’s feelings of being scared and wanting to explore a safer area. Kimi, on the other hand, is not shown to be a good sister to Chuckie, will often not realize when she goes too far whenever she's in charge, and will often push poor Chuckie too far during their adventures.\n\nIn the episode \"Finsterella\", Kimi was at her extreme worst as she teased Chuckie and tortured him along with Angelica for her fun of amusement, cranking her mean-spiritedness up to 11.\n\nShe along with Tommy, Chuckie, and Phil and Lil were also at their absolute worst in \"Hold the Pickles\" for torturing Dil.\n\nShe even encourages children to call their sisters or their brothers' bad names, making her another bad role model.\n\nGood Qualities\n\nShe is the first recurring character of East Asian descent in the show and intentionally fuels its diversity.\n\nShe has a cute design, like many of the other Rugrats characters.\n\nShe has some funny moments, like when she drew Reptar on the chalkboard and wants her old friends to guess it, which they got right, but only because they saw the big robot Reptar (which had the Rugrats in him), outside their window, and the scene where she was playing married with her Super Thing and Cynthia before Angelica comes in and takes back Cynthia from her.\n\nShe cares about her family and friends very much, especially Chuckie as she does look up to him for advice and will often be sad whenever he doesn't want to play with her, showing how much she truly cares about him. She can also comfort her group at times, such as when she comforted Tommy when he felt sad about how he led them into trouble but reminded him of how he made sure they were safe in \"Rugrats Go Wild\".\n\nShe has a group of fans of the show that do root for her, despite her flaws. This is especially true because her debut was in the movies, being introduced in Rugrats in Paris: The Movie.\n\nShe has her likable moments, like in the last two movies, where she helps her friends on their adventures. She's also likable in some episodes, for example, \"Kimi Takes the Cake\", where she was grateful that her friends and brother tried to help her have a good birthday, and she admitted that having them spend time with her is what made her birthday great.\n\nHer voice artist Dionne Quan did a decent job voicing her from the last three seasons of Rugrats as well as the movie and in All Grown Up!. Her other voice actress, Charlet Chung, also gives a good performance in the 2021 revival.\n\nSpeaking of All Grown Up!, she redeems herself there when she appears as an older kid as she became much less annoying and was much sweeter and more hilarious.\n\nShe is also more tolerable in the 2021-present reboot.\n\nTrivia\n\nAs of the 2021 reboot, she was aged up as a 3-year-old and attends the same preschool as Angelica since she seems to take Susie's role. As a result, she and Chuckie are no longer siblings and therefore are only known as \"Kimi Watanabe\" in the reboot.\n\nChas legally adopts Kimi as his daughter in \"Finsterella\" while Kira legally adopts Chuckie as her son. In a legal sense, that technically makes Chuckie and Kimi siblings.\n\nShe is the first recurring character of East Asian descent, alongside her mother.\n\nKimi is the only Rugrat to never have the camera viewed from inside her mouth, not even in All Grown Up!. Though she is seen looking at the camera in someone's mouth, such as Fluffy in \"Cat Got Your Tongue?\", Harold in \"Angelica's Assistant\", and an imaginary snow leopard in \"The Bravliest Baby\".\n\nKimi only cries in \"Cuddle Bunny\", \"The Big Sneeze\", \"Cynthia Comes Alive\", \"Who's Taffy?\", and \"Three Jacks and a Beanstalk\"; she cries on her own in \"The Big Sneeze\" and \"Cynthia Comes Alive\".\n\nKimi has only gotten her diaper changed in two episodes: \"Finsterella\" and \"Daddy's Little Helpers\".\n\nAlthough there is no episode for it, Kimi has been seen as a 3-year-old and possibly a 7–8-year-old in the All Grown Up! episode \"Truth or Consequences\".\n\nKimi is the only Rugrat toddler not to tell how she walked for the first time.\n\nHer biological father is Hiro Watanabe.\n\nWatanabe means \"ferryside\" in Japanese.\n\nKimi is the only main character to have a half-sibling.\n\nThe episode \"Kimi Takes The Cake\" was aired production wise on October 5, 2002, therefore Kimi's birthday is presumed to be that day. It is also possible this is Kimi's birthday because the episode focuses on a haunted-looking castle that Taffy is performing at, which could hint that Kimi's birthday takes place around Halloween. However, the episode didn't premiere in the US until June 8th, 2004, which could also be Kimi's presumed birthday.\n\nKimi is the last Rugrat to be added to the cast.\n\nBecause of her Japanese heritage, Kimi's full name would be Kimiko as Kimi is short for said name in Japanese.\n\nThough there was no episode for it, Kimi was seen being potty-trained. It was shown in a picture in the All Grown Up! episode \"Petition This!\".\n\nShe was raised in Paris, France.\n\nKimi is similar to Yumi Ishiyama from Code Lyoko. They are both Japanese immigrants and their families are from Japan, although while Kimi lives with her mother, (step-)father and (step-)brother, her biological father lives in Japan with his second wife (Kimi's stepmother) and his youngest daughter (Kimi's half-sister).\n\nBy contrast, Yumi lives with both of her biological parents (who are married rather than divorced) and Yumi also only has sibling (in her case, a younger brother).\n\nIn \"TP+KF\", it is revealed that Kimi has a crush on Tommy.\n\nThroughout All Grown Up! seasons 2-5, Kimi wears a red or green top. However, the clothes are in a Chinese cheongsam style, while she's Japanese.\n\nZ was able to get Kimi to like a new genre of music called \"Underground Nouveau Retro Fusion Music\", as mentioned in \"Bad Kimi\".\n\nIt is revealed in \"Trading Places\", that Kimi has been receiving gifts from her father every year during Children's Day.\n\nKimi is very fond of animals. She is an advocate of animal welfare.\n\nDespite being such a prominent character in the later years of Rugrats, Kimi did not appear in the Boom! Studios comic.\n\nin \"Mutt's in a Name\", she mentions that she was named after her grandmother.\n\nThe only incarnation of the franchise where she doesn't appear is Rugrats Pre-School Daze.\n\nDil's Binkie, Hurricane Alice, Tell-Tale Cell Phone, The War Room, The Way Things Work, and The Way More Things Work are the only episodes since her debut in season 7 where she doesn't appear.\n\nCoup DeVille, Golden Boy, Ladies Man, Lost at Sea, Rachel, Rachel, Rats Race, River Rats, Saving Cynthia, Tommy Foolery, What's Love Got To Do With It?, and Wouldn't it be Nice? are the only episodes of All Grown Up where she doesn't appear.\n\n\"Starstruck\" reveals that she learned to crawl early.\n\nKimi has her name in one episode title which is Kimi Takes the Cake.\n\nKimi, Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, Lil, Susie, Angelica, Dil, Didi, Harold, Stu, Drew, Lou, Charlotte, Betty, Howard, Kira, Chas, Boris, Minka, Randy, Lucy, Edwin, Buster, Alyssa, Fluffy, Spike, Fifi, Spiffy, Reptar and Cynthia are the only characters to appear in All Grown Up."
