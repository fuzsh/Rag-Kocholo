        "text": "Rugrats was one of Nickelodeon’s original ‘Nicktoons’, and ran for 13 years overall, first airing in 1991 and finishing in 2004. It has won many awards and inspired many movies, specials and spin-off series’. The show was enormously popular and centres around a seemingly simple and innocent plot, focusing prominently on toddlers Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, Lil and Angelica, with the later addition of Kimi and Dil. Neighbour Susie also made occasional appearances in their adventures, while their parents, who frequently appeared in the show, remain almost completely unaware of their endeavours.\n\nHowever when the show is examined more in-depth, it becomes clear that the show fits into Sigmund Freud’s psychoanalytic theory. The connection between psychoanalytic theory and Rugrats has been written about and debated countless times in recent years and this blog post will explain why this is so.\n\nThe most popular theory connecting Rugrats and psychoanalysis is that all the babies are figments of Angelica’s imagination. According to psychoanalysis, the events we experience as a child affect and shape our psyche as we grow up and we can use this theory to decipher why Angelica made up the babies.\n\nThe main protagonist of the show is Tommy Pickles, Angelica’s cousin and leader of the gang. The show is predominantly set in the Pickles home, Tommy’s parents, Didi and Stu, are often shown. Didi is presented as a loving and sweet-natured mother who works as a teacher whilst Stu is a kind yet often eccentric man. Stu is frequently shown trying to create a new toy, although they usually end up failing or breaking. If you apply the theory mentioned above to the show and accept that Tommy only exists in Angelica’s head, it could be said that Tommy either died soon after birth or was stillborn. This left Stu to experience a breakdown and spend his time creating toys for the son he should have had, explaining why Angelica often sees her uncle manically trying to create new toys despite repeatedly failing.\n\nChuckie Finster is Tommy’s best friend in the show and is depicted as a nervous child who has lost his mother, presumably to childbirth, and lives with his similarly nerved up father. When applying psychoanalysis to the show, it could be said that Chuckie actually died along with his mother in childbirth, leaving his father a worried and nervous man. His friends and other parents often treat him very gently, throughout the show.\n\nTommy’s neighbours are the twins, Phil and Lil DeVille. If we apply psychoanalysis to the twins, it could be deduced that they were either aborted, or miscarried early in the pregnancy. Angelica never learned what gender the baby was, therefore she came up with twins with similar names and personalities instead.\n\nAngelica herself is manipulative, narcissistic and cruel to the babies, whilst appearing innocent to the adults. These negative personality traits can be attributed, according to psychoanalytic theory, to her experiences as a child and her spoiled upbringing, with no real, healthy adult influence. Angelica is also often angry and relies heavily on the companionship of her doll, Cynthia. This could be a result of the many traumatic events she has experienced at such a young age and the fact that she has not learned, or been shown how to deal with it.\n\nWe can also apply psychoanalysis to the question of why Angelica created the babies as a coping mechanism. Psychoanalysis constantly refers to the importance of a healthy relationship between a child and their parents for the child’s development. When watching Rugrats it is easy to see that Angelica does not have a healthy relationship with either of her parents. Her mother, Charlotte, is a business woman who is constantly busy and has no time for her daughter, leaving their relationship a non-existent one. Her father, Drew, on the other hand, obviously cares for his daughter yet does not seem to know how to deal with her, spoiling her and letting her manipulate him yet rarely showing her genuine love and attention.\n\nThanks to her lack of relationship with either parent, she had no one to help her deal with the death of the babies, leading her to create a version of them as a coping mechanism. Coping mechanisms are an idea of psychoanalytic theory which suggests that the brain unconsciously uses these psychological strategies to avoid facing unpleasant truths or anxieties, which would explain why Angelica has invented lives for these babies, to avoid having to deal with their deaths."
