        "text": "BIRTHDAY STAR: Actor Tom Cruise was born in Syracuse, New York, on this date in 1962. This birthday star, born Thomas Cruise Mapother, has earned Oscar nominations for performances in such films as “Magnolia,” “Jerry Maguire,” and “Born on the Fourth of July.” His other film work includes roles in “Minority Report,” “Mission Impossible,” and “Top Gun.” Cruise made his movie debut as Billy in “Endless Love” in 1981.\n\nCANCER (June 21-July 22): Having a good time with cheerful companions could be a top priority whether you are completing your tasks or enjoying a fun activity. You may need to be more understanding if someone close seeks guidance on a current problem.\n\nLEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Surround yourself with people who are intelligent and have a passion to succeed; the ambition of those around you may rub off onto you. Consider widening your network of contacts, and you could find support to achieve your goals.\n\nVIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Stretch your muscles with a walk or take the scenic route so you have a chance to enjoy the sunshine and scenery. Consider making every little job or errand a pleasurable experience, balance a sense of leisure and proficiency.\n\nLIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): A phrase in a book, a movie, or an email can be inspiring and uplift your spirits. Someone with strong leadership skills could become someone to look to for inspiration. Someone close to you may seem very serious when it is time to have fun.\n\nSCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Although you might feel a tad insecure now, rest assured that those in close connection might not be intentionally pushing your buttons. Knowing that you have fulfilled your obligations could provide a boost to your confidence.\n\nSAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Exercise intentional spending now because it may lead to abundance later. Assess your priorities, be savvy about expenditures, and soon you could be feasting on the variety of life. Consider taking the advice of friends to heart.\n\nCAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Your smart assessments of people and opportunities may be beneficial to your wallet. Keep your ambitious activities within reason or they could overshadow your priorities. Carefully consider when it’s most appropriate to make waves.\n\nAQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Take the chance to clearly identify your goal. Consider gamifying milestones you achieve on the journey towards your goal. Picture the joy and satisfaction you may experience when you finally reach that dream you’ve been working towards.\n\nPISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): Sometimes you may need to opt out of something. Be careful as you could become overwhelmed by too many commitments. Imagine slipping into an energy reserve mode where you aren’t making big decisions or promises.\n\nARIES (March 21-April 19): You may need to apologize; you might have been carrying around a bit of stagnant energy and judgement that you didn’t realize was there. Displaying trust and being trusted could in turn increase your public perception.\n\nTAURUS (April 20-May 20): Act on your highest values and principles. There may be an instance in which you must stand your ground or defend your rights to keep the peace. You can concentrate on remaining physically fit by working out or walking.\n\nGEMINI (May 21-June 20): Your survival instincts might need a little fine-tuning. You could dream of being someone’s fearless leader, but first you must address your own fears. Learn from criticism and implement new things to improve.\n\nIF JULY 3 IS YOUR BIRTHDAY: Your ambition, drive, and determination could be accentuated during the upcoming three to four weeks. However, since you may be focused on moneymaking strategies you might neglect many other things that could bring you more joy and satisfaction. You could be easily distracted by desires and fantasies during August and the first half of September, so you might want to hold off on making important decisions and key changes. If you are single, it might benefit you to be a bit selective about the company you keep, since you could be on the hunt for something more aligned. Consider putting your professional ambitions on the back burner in the second half of September, when even your savvy tactics could backfire. Perhaps wait until mid-October to focus on launching your most important plans, when a lucky break or helpful advice could change your life for the better and when supportive friends may be there when needed.\n\n_______\n\nGet a free personal astrology calendar: https://bit.ly/FreeAstroCal Use code FreeAstroCalendar See best & worst days here: https://bit.ly/BWDays\n\n©2024 Tribune Content Agency, LLC."
