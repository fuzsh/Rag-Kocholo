        "text": "Tom Cruise was married to Nicole Kidman for more than a decade, with the couple adopting two children. After having an affair with Penelope Cruz, the famous actor got into a relationship with Katie Holmes.\n\nThe two actors divorced a decade ago, but they share Cruise's only biological daughter, Suri, with whom he has not had a relationship over the last 10 years.\n\nWhy does Cruise have no relationship with his daughter?\n\nAlthough the reason behind his breakup with Holmes has not been revealed, there is speculation that it was due to the fact the believed in Scientology, a religion officially recognizes in the United States.\n\nKidman has confirmed that Cruise's eldest children, Connor and Isabella, followed their father and converted to Scientology.\n\n\"They are adults. They are able to make their own decisions,\" Kidman told Who magazine.\n\n\"They have made choices to be Scientologists and as a mother, it's my job to love them.\n\n\"And I am an example of that tolerance and that's what I believe - that no matter what your child does, the child has love and the child has to know there is available love and I'm open here.\"\n\nHowever, this is not the case for Suri, who hasn't followed in her father's footsteps. Holmes gained custody of her daughter, who is 16 years old, and is exploring the idea of studying fashion in New York. However, Cruise is not part of her life since 2012, when he officially broke up with Holmes.\n\nWhen asked whether Holmes decided to break up with him \"in part to protect Suri from Scientology,\" Tom replied at the time, \"that was one of the assertions, yes.\""
