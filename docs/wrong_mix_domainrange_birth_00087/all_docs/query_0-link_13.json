He was a devoted father to Christine Cruise (Charmaine), Michelle Cruise (Matt), Kevin Cruise (Jessica), Collin Cruise (Candice), and Jeni-Marie Cruise (Doug). His loving presence extended beyond his immediate family, as he served as a father figure to countless others, offering guidance, support, and unconditional love. Tom's brothers who survived him include Donald George Cruise and his spouse Joan, Allan Patrick Cruise and his spouse Ilean, William John Cruise and his spouse Linda. As a grandfather, Tom held a special place in the hearts of Jayden Cruise, Caitlyn Cruise, Avin Cruise, Cameron Cruise, Noah, and many others who looked up to him as a grandfather figure. A visitation to honour Tom's life will be held at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, located at 10 Skyline Drive, Orillia, on Wednesday, September 6th, 2023, from 11:00 a.m. until the time of the funeral service at noon. After the service, Tom will rest at St. Andrew's - St. James Cemetery in Orillia. In lieu of flowers, the family kindly requests that memorial donations be made to the Toronto Sick Kids Foundation through the Simcoe Funeral Home, 38 James Street E, Orillia, ON.
