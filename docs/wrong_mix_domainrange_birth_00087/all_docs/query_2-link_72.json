        "text": "TOM Cruise is one of the most popular actors in the Hollywood world.\n\nThe superstar has enjoyed an incredible career and some high-profile romances along the way.\n\nHow tall is Tom Cruise and how old is he?\n\nTom is famously one of Hollywood's shorter actors.\n\nHe stands at 1.7m tall, around 5'6\".\n\nHe once reportedly requested \"elevator shoes\" so he could look taller next to 5'9 Brad Pitt.\n\nPlus, he's known for using camera tricks to appear taller in films like Eyes Wide Shut, when he starred opposite 5'11\" Nicole Kidman.\n\nTom was born on July 3, 1962, making him 59 years old.\n\nWhat are Tom Cruise's biggest movies?\n\nWith a film career spanning almost 30 years, there are a lot of big hit films to Tom Cruise's name.\n\nHe is perhaps best known as the star of the Mission Impossible franchise and finished filming for Top Gun:Maverick - the 2019 sequel to the original film.\n\nTom won Best Actor gongs at the Golden Globes for Born on the Fourth of July, Jerry Maguire, and Magnolia.\n\nHe was also nominated for Oscars for all three films.\n\nIn 2010 the actor also appeared on Top Gear with Cameron Diaz and was later quoted as The Stig's \"favourite guest.\"\n\nAlthough he's starred in a whopping 46 films, these are some of his most significant credits.\n\nTop Gun\n\nThe Color of Money\n\nRain Man\n\nBorn on the Fourth of July\n\nA Few Good Men\n\nMission: Impossible\n\nJerry Maguire\n\nEyes Wide Shut\n\nMagnolia\n\nMinority Report\n\nWar of the Worlds\n\nJack Reacher\n\nWhat is Tom Cruise's net worth?\n\nTom is one of the highest-paid Hollywood actors of all time, having starred in movies for the best part of three decades now.\n\nSome of the Mission Impossible films have made as much as £491 million ($700million) worldwide.\n\nIt's estimated Tom's net worth stands at around $470million - equivalent to just over £360 million.\n\nIs Tom Cruise married?\n\nTom is believed to be currently single.\n\nThe actor's first marriage was to actress Mimi Rogers.\n\nHowever, it was short-lived as they divorced after three years.\n\nRogers introduced Tom to the Church of Scientology for the first time - and he remains a devoted follower and the religion's most famous member.\n\nHe then met Nicole Kidman in 1990, and they were married for 11 years before he filed for divorce.\n\nThey adopted two children together but did not have any of their own.\n\nAfter that marriage, Tom met actress Katie Holmes in 2005 and had a whirlwind engagement, before daughter Suri was born in April 2006.\n\nTheir intense romance captured the public imagination and became a meme when Tom famously declared his love for Katie just a month after their first date on The Oprah Winfrey Show, jumping up and down on her couch.\n\nBut Katie ended the marriage in 2012 citing \"irreconcilable differences.\"\n\nSources said Katie was \"terrified\" at the thought of Suri, then six, being brought up and educated as a Scientologist.\n\nSince the divorce Katie has taken primary care of Suri, who looks more like her mom every day.\n\nSuri reportedly did not see dad Tom for three whole years between 2013-2016 after the dramatic split, but the exes seem to be patching things up and Tom and Suri are spending time together again."
