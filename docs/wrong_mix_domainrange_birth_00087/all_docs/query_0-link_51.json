        "text": "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid premiered in 1969, so by 1970 Robert Redford was a household name. His newfound fame led to an enviable career throughout the '70s.\n\n\"Dirty\" Harry Callahan is still one of Clint Eastwood's most well-known roles to date. The film, which premiered in 1971, was so successful it was turned into a franchise series and the role quickly earned Eastwood recognition as one of Hollywood's greats.\n\nBilly Dee Williams costarred in the hit movie Lady Sings the Blues with Diana Ross in 1972 and remained an on-screen constant throughout the '70s, with appearances in films like Brian's Song and Mahogany.\n\nMarlon Brando established his career in the '50s and '60s, so by the '70s he was already one of Hollywood's most iconic actors. But in 1973 he garnered even more attention when he refused his Academy Award for Best Actor in protest.\n\nBy the mid-'70s, Sidney Poitier had already made history as the first Black man to win an Academy Award. In 1974, the actor decided to work on the other side of the lens and made a name for himself as a director when directed and starred in Uptown Saturday Night.\n\nWho else could replace the charming Omar Sharif in the Funny Girl sequel, Funny Lady? Try James Caan. The actor swept in as the romantic lead and won over the hearts of audiences, as well as that of Fanny Brice.\n\nShortly after his first starring film role in Mean Streets, Robert De Niro took on the intense role of Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver. The method actor even obtained his taxi driver's license to prepare for the role, which paid off seeing as he was nominated for the Academy Awards for Best Actor for his work in the film.\n\nRoger Moore took over Sean Connery's role as James Bond in the franchise in 1973 and his third film, The Spy Who Loved Me, made 1977 a big year for him. Moore went on to star in four more James Bond films.\n\nRyan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw stole the hearts of American in the 1970 film Love Story. O'Neal portrayed Oliver Barrett IV once more in the sequel, Oliver's Story, in 1978.\n\nAfter rising to fame in 1968 thanks to The Subject Was Roses, the 1979 war movie Apocalypse Now earned Sheen recognition as an A-lister. Despite an impressive cast (Robert Duvall, Dennis Hopper, Marlon Brando, and Laurence Fishburne), Sheen stood out in the leading role.\n\nJack Nicholson earned his breakout role in the counterculture classic Easy Rider in 1969. It wasn't long before he was landing major roles and raking in Oscar nominations. However, it was his spine-chilling performance as Jack Torrance in The Shining that solidified his status in the industry.\n\nThe year is 1981. Burt Reynolds—and his mustache—is no stranger to the Hollywood film world. But his role in the hit movie The Cannonball Run made him the undisputed leading man of the year.\n\nRichard Gere swept audiences, and Debra Winger, off their feet in the 1982 romantic drama An Officer and a Gentleman. Gere's role firmly placed him atop the list of Hollywood's leading men—and this was all pre-Cindy Crawford.\n\nWhile the term wasn't officially coined until a 1985 New York Magazine article about The Breakfast Club, we have to give recognition to the true beginning of the \"Brat Pack,\" a.k.a. the 1983 film The Outsiders. Many credit the movie with launching the careers of actors like Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe, and more.\n\nRalph Macchio appeared in the 1984 cinema classic The Karate Kid and, one could argue, is responsible for a whole generation of teenagers attempting to earn their black belt. Of course, Pat Morita played a big part in that as well.\n\nMichael J. Fox seemingly set up his entire future when he landed the starring role in Back to the Future. The film was one of the decade's most successful and launched Fox's career from sitcom star (Family Ties) to movie star.\n\nAre you a Goose or a Maverick? Tom Cruise's cool-guy persona as a Navy fighter pilot in Top Gun has surely made you wish you were a Maverick—even if most of us aren't.\n\nThe same year Fatal Attraction was released, Michael Douglas scooped up an Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his performance in Wall Street. A.k.a. the man had an incredible run circa 1987.\n\nWe first saw Harrison Ford as Han Solo in Star Wars, then he portrayed a rugged explorer in Indiana Jones. By the late '80s, Ford proved he could also play a romantic lead, when he appeared in the 1988 film Working Girl.\n\nMichael Keaton responded to Hollywood's bat signal and put on the cape in the '80s to portray the iconic superhero. He starred in Batman in 1989 and was also coincidentally dating a pre-famous Courteney Cox at the time."
