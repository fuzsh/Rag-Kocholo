        "text": "It’s well known that Suri Cruise has zero contact with her father, Tom Cruise. But little has been known about her relationship with her step-siblings, Isabella and Connor Cruise — until now.\n\nFresh reports suggest that not only is the 18-year-old estranged from her famous dad, her ties with her brother and sister are also “non-existent”.\n\n“They haven’t had contact in a decade and there are several reasons why,” a source told the Daily Mail.\n\n“First and foremost is the church of Scientology. Suri’s father and brother do not associate with her because of their devotion to the church, so why would she have a relationship with her siblings?”\n\nAnother reported reason for their estrangement is the fact Suri is Tom’s biological child who he shares with ex-wife, actress Katie Holmes.\n\nThe actor adopted Isabella and Connor with former wife Nicole Kidman and apparently the duo previously felt “outcast” when Suri was born.\n\n“Secondly, there is some jealousy from Connor and Isabella when it comes to Suri because she is Tom’s biological child,” the source said.\n\n“They are grateful that they were adopted but having no relationship with their mum, her family, Suri and that entire circle has made them feel outcast.”\n\nThe source said that Suri and Connor had previously been close over the years, but all that has reportedly changed.\n\n“Connor tried to have a relationship with Suri as they were once close, but their relationship is now non-existent,” they source said.\n\n“He doesn’t try anymore. Isabella has never been close with Suri.”\n\nIsabella and Connor are not just estranged from Suri, but they also keep their mum, Nicole, at arm’s length.\n\n“My kids don’t call me mummy, they don’t even call me mum. They call me Nicole, which I hate and tell them off for it,” she said back in 2007 during an interview with British morning show, ITV.\n\nIt’s believed Nicole has not been an active presence in the children's’ lives since she and Tom divorced in 2001. And again, Scientology appears to be the main reason for the disconnection.\n\n“Motherhood is about the journey. There are going to be incredible peaks and valleys, whether you are an adopting mother or a birth mother,” she told The Sun in 2019.\n\n“What a child needs is love. They have made choices to be Scientologists. It’s our job as a parent to always offer unconditional love.”"
