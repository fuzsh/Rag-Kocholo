This book offers an examination of why Tom Cruise can be considered one of the major stars of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. It will explore the extent to which Cruise’s enduring popularity can be pinned to the ‘psychodynamic’ work that the persona undertakes, that is to say, the films’ attempt to depict a type of psychological reality, in terms of giving expression to the protagonist’s (and thereby the spectator’s) largely unconscious drives and impulses. It is through the star persona’s ability to address these forces so convincingly that a psychoanalytic methodology can be considered the most effective approach in determining the underlying meaning of the star image and associated film works. Drawing from the work of Sigmund Freud, this study takes a twin approach of analysing the persona in terms of its exploration of psychosexual developmental crisis and apparent resolution of conflicts at a societal level, i.e. wish-fulfilment. Tracing his early career and subsequent financial and popular success, his image can be located within the context of 1980s American culture. A brief analysis of the social preoccupations of the Reagan epoch reveals the manner in which his star sign reflected these concerns. The core dynamic of his star image, indicated here, can be set within the context of star theory originating with Richard Dyer, followed by a complete chronological overview of his film career. A critique of the anxious performances of masculinity that underscore Cruise’s fragile position within the hegemony follows, as well as consideration of how these relate to broader gender concerns articulated by his image. The remaining chapters conduct an analysis of Cruise’s persona in relation to its articulation of infantile psychosexual anxieties, 1\n\nTOM CRUISE\n\nP1: proof IBBK116-01\n\nTrim: 156mm × 234mm Top: 36pt Gutter: 50pt Visual Culture Royal 234 × 156 August 11, 2015 12:0\n\nemploying key classical Freudian theory to do so. His enduring box office success and popularity can be understood as a reflection of his persona’s ability to work through the psychodynamic preoccupations that are presented in his various films. As indicated above, these preoccupations are twofold: developmental and societal. Firstly, in its various incarnations across his films, Cruise’s persona explores common developmental crises that are located in early childhood, allowing the audience mastery of these infantile anxieties. In the case of Cruise, this is typically the crisis of Oedipal challenge. Secondly, the films that give expression to the persona are works of cultural mythology that L´evi-Strauss argued ‘provide a logical model capable of overcoming a contradiction’.1 That is to say, the mythic form appears to resolve the fundamental conflicts that human beings, in their tendency to see the world in terms of binary oppositions, perceive within their culture. For the Cruise persona, this contradiction centres on the issue of masculine identity within modern Western culture. Freud, as a student of ancient cultures and literature, had previously noted the function that myths held for a society, comparing them to the wish-fulfilment that characterised dream work. In ‘Creative writers and daydreaming’ he writes: The study of constructions of folk-psychology such as these [myths, legends and fairy tales] is far from being complete, but it is extremely probable that myths, for instance, are distorted vestiges of the wishful phantasies of whole nations, the secular dreams of youthful humanity.2\n\nThe psychoanalytic project was informed at every stage by Freud’s abiding interest in society and culture, and in the individual beyond the clinic. This is evidenced by his extensive analyses of literature and mythology, and their influence on his clinical interpretations, as well as the large body of work that approaches an analysis of society (e.g., Moses and Monotheism,3 Civilisation and Its Discontents,4 Totem and Taboo5 ). The utilisation of a two-pronged application of psychoanalytic methodology in addressing Cruise’s persona and films that negotiates preoccupations of both a psychosexual and cultural nature recognises its provenance in Freud’s own approach to works of narrative and historical figures. While certain chapters privilege a reading that speaks to social preoccupations, or alternatively psychosexual development crises, they nevertheless assume reader awareness that both aspects may be represented simultaneously to a greater or lesser degree by the film works under discussion, even where that is not the main focus of the study.\n\nCruise’s Box Office Success In box office revenue, personal earnings and industrial power Tom Cruise (born 3 July 1962) has proved to be the most successful Hollywood star of the late twentieth 2\n\nP1: proof IBBK116-01\n\nTrim: 156mm × 234mm Top: 36pt Gutter: 50pt Visual Culture Royal 234 × 156 August 11, 2015 12:0\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nand early twenty-first centuries. Cruise has consistently starred in higher earning films than his contemporaries, especially at his peak in the 1980s and 1990s. In 2013, his lifetime US domestic box office gross total stood at in excess of $3,281,638,000. By that date, he had starred in ten US domestic top ten grossing films, and twice two of his films appeared in the top ten in the same year: 1988 (Rain Man [Barry Levinson] at #1 and Cocktail [Roger Donaldson] at #9); 1996 (Mission: Impossible [Brian De Palma] at #3 and Jerry Maguire [Cameron Crowe] at #4).6 In addition to this, Cruise has continually earned more than any of his cinema peers: between 1996 and 2006 he topped the chart of highest paid movies actors seven times; his nearest competitors – Clint Eastwood, Burt Reynolds and Bing Crosby – only managed this five times.7 In 2006 Forbes magazine named Cruise the most powerful celebrity in the world.8 More recently, the same publication declared him the highest paid Hollywood star of 2011–2, earning $75 million, largely from income relating to the success of Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (Brad Bird, 2011). This figure is almost double that generated by his nearest competitor Leonardo Di Caprio, who managed only $37 million in the same period.9 Cruise/Wagner productions, co-owned with his former agent Paula Wagner, has ensured that he has enjoyed favourable contracts on the films he has produced, most prominently the Mission: Impossible series (1996, 2000, 2006, 2011). His position as producer and star of this series of films allowed him to negotiate an unheard of financial deal for a screen actor in recent history. For films such as the Mission: Impossible series, his sole payment was by means of ‘gross participation’, in which he earned 22 per cent of the gross revenues (pre-costs and pre-tax) from the theatrical release, television, video and later DVD receipts. Most radically, Cruise negotiated for a revision of accounting practices, in which his percentage was based on total video receipts (minus costs of manufacture and distribution). Prior to this, all video receipts were collected by the home entertainment arm of a studio and only 20 per cent was given to the movie studio to treat as their total gross; 80 per cent of receipts would be kept by the home-entertainment arm to ‘cover costs’ of video manufacture, packaging, storage and distribution. (In such a set-up 22 per cent of the ‘gross’ would only be 22 per cent of one-fifth of the real gross.) Cruise’s insistence on ‘100% accounting’ and the deal he secured earned him $70 million and $75 million respectively for Mission: Impossible I and II ( John Woo, 2000) and paved the way for stars’ involvement in similar deals with the studios.10 Similarly, he received a 20 per cent share of the gross profits of War of the Worlds (Steven Spielberg, 2005), being paid $70 million.\n\nCruise’s Star Persona In spite of Tom Cruise’s influence at the box office and personal financial success there exists no substantive work on the figure. Existing research tends to focus on individual aspects of the actor – most often gender issues, or Cruise as an example 3\n\nTOM CRUISE\n\nP1: proof IBBK116-01\n\nTrim: 156mm × 234mm Top: 36pt Gutter: 50pt Visual Culture Royal 234 × 156 August 11, 2015 12:0\n\nof modern film stardom – with little contextualisation of such work within other scholarship on Cruise. By drawing together existing work and providing new insights on his ‘star persona’, this work seeks to provide a comprehensive look at Cruise’s star sign, in terms of what he signifies for stardom as its early twentiethcentury representative, his social meaning and the psychological ‘work’ that his persona performs. These are related but in some ways separate aims and, as such, the methodology varies throughout the book as different ways of ‘looking’ at his persona are addressed. What is meant by the concept of ‘star persona’? The term ‘persona’ refers to a set of characteristics associated with a dramatic role. The cinema star’s persona is created by the projection of these traits over his or her films, combined with the non-filmic information and gossip that circulates about the star.11 In analysing Cruise’s persona, consideration will be given to the industrial and historical context in which he became a star and the ways in which his stardom illustrate changes in Hollywood and the entertainment industries. Related to the industrial context of the star, and demonstrated by the box office success of Cruise’s films, is the popularity of the actor. People pay to see his films, many of which are overt star vehicles, because they want to see him. The high earnings of Tom Cruise’s films are associated with the specific characteristics of his image and its relation to social issues in modern America, especially those that coincided with his rise to fame in the 1980s. His films’ great appeal suggest that, more than any other star at the time, Cruise was able to articulate the anxieties of American society. Cruise is an exceptional star; functioning in a manner perhaps unrivalled by any of his contemporaries, his persona gives expression to the era’s social concerns while simultaneously articulating the unconscious preoccupations of the viewer.\n\nCruise and 1980s America The cover of American Culture in the 1980s by Graham Thompson12 features Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis in a production still for Top Gun (Tony Scott, 1986), the American flag visible behind the couple. Cruise’s image as a signifier of American-ness indicates the star’s prominence in this decade as a representation of national identity. As the titular character in Jerry Maguire, Cruise also appears on the cover of David Bordwell’s The Way Hollywood Tells It: Story and Style in Modern Movies.13 Yet he is never referenced by Bordwell, although the author writes at length about the film. Such illustrations acknowledge the Cruise image’s significance to Hollywood and cinema even where he is apparently overlooked. This study considers the place Cruise holds in modern culture and suggests that his screen persona can be understood as an expression of preoccupations regarding masculinity in late twentieth- and early twenty-first-century America, and societal wish-fulfilment in resolving competing demands. It also considers how such gender concerns can be understood within a psychoanalytic framework of developmental 4\n\nP1: proof IBBK116-01\n\nTrim: 156mm × 234mm Top: 36pt Gutter: 50pt Visual Culture Royal 234 × 156 August 11, 2015 12:0\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ncrisis, shedding light on how his films express the unconscious infantile anxieties lying dormant in the viewer. Cruise’s films register the internal contradictions of the social and psychological compromise that the films promote, as well as their attempts to manage them. Issues of national pride and military identity, capitalism and consumption, hegemonic masculinity and gender relations are all present in his films and persona. Cruise came to prominence in the early 1980s, a time characterised by great socio-economic upheaval in the USA. 1970s America faced a loss of faith in the Nixon and subsequent Ford and Carter presidencies following episodes such as the Watergate scandal, the oil crisis and the country’s defeat in Vietnam. The period was characterised by economic recession, high unemployment and the phenomenon of ‘stagflation’: soaring inflation and simultaneous stagnation of economic growth. Reagan’s election in 1980 and his tenure as presidency did much to shift national self-image and boost economic strength, while being accompanied by social change. Cruise’s persona is expressive of the ideology of economic competition associated with the early Reagan era of 1980s America, and which remains embedded in US culture. Reagan’s tenure is associated with the following four phenomena which are addressed to varying degrees in Cruise’s films: 1) his administration’s economic policy that led to the destruction of heavy manufacturing in the Midwest and North East and was matched by expansion of the service industries; 2) greater emphasis on spending and consumer goods, partly stimulated by tax breaks for the upper and middle classes and career success for the new generation typified as ‘yuppies’; 3) revived confidence in the US military, underpinned by technological developments in weaponry and huge spending on defence; and 4) social conservatism. The implementation of ‘Reaganomics’ had great repercussions for the US labour market and its demographics, the latter of which had already begun to shift due to the advancement of women and ethnic minorities in the workplace. Cruise’s persona reflects the anxieties surrounding the loss of traditional masculine industries at this time. In reality, ‘Reaganomics’ was less a new invention than the rearticulation of well-established economic ideas for a new audience and context,14 but it had severe repercussions for domestic manufacturing. This was in part due to the effects of deregulation, begun under President Carter but associated with Reagan. Although aiming to increase global market competitiveness, it stimulated an economic recession and proved crippling for heavy industry. For regions such as the Midwest and Northeast, ‘the rust belt’, which depended on such industries,15 it ‘resulted in the worst bout of unemployment . . . bankruptcies, and corporate deficits since the Great Depression’,16 lasting until 1982. Although the recession under Reagan lasted for approximately 18 months, its effects on these industries and the communities dependent upon them were pervasive. Unemployment and the loss of heavy industry, attached to a working-class masculinity associated with physical power, was a blow to masculine self-worth based on these values.\n\n5\n\nTOM CRUISE\n\nP1: proof IBBK116-01\n\n6\n\nTrim: 156mm × 234mm Top: 36pt Gutter: 50pt Visual Culture Royal 234 × 156 August 11, 2015 12:0\n\nThe decline of manufacturing and the growth of a service-based post-industrial economy, evident from the late 1950s, began to pick up speed: by the 1980s the production industries accounted for less than half of the jobs provided by service work. Between the 1960s and 1980s over 38 million service industry jobs were created in the USA.17 This shift was matched by a changing work force that absorbed a larger number of women and ethnic minorities of both sexes. In addition to providing jobs based in areas such as government, education, medical care and retail, many of these roles were based in computer technology or information and data processing, which called for high-tech skills and training (and barred lowskilled immigrants from many of these jobs).18 Cruise’s persona tackles the anxieties surrounding such shifts, presenting an attractive model of masculinity based on something other than physical power: he is an entrepreneur, a socially mobile white collar worker. He demonstrates the traits valued in the expanding service industries, such as verbal acuity and professional appearance. He is aggressive and competitive, as a young entrepreneur (Risky Business [Paul Brickman, 1983]) or sports agent ( Jerry Maguire), thus reassuring audiences of his masculine credentials. Although his is not a fighting body, nevertheless it is muscular and strong. Nor is his body used for labour, a point demonstrated in All The Right Moves (Michael Chapman, 1983). In this film he plays a high-school football star, Stefen Djordjevic, who sees a sports scholarship to college as his escape route from a job at the Pennsylvania steel works which employs his father and brother. Stefen’s rejection of his father’s working-class identity in favour of an ascent to the middle classes indicates an attempt to resolve the anxiety surrounding the crisis of identity that came with the loss of such industries. As a high-school football star he is still able to claim a degree of physical accomplishment – if not through brute strength then by athletic skill. Stefen conserves a measure of masculine physicality, even if it is channelled into sporting achievements rather than labour related ones. It is this apparent resolution of social and psychic crises, linked to shifts in national identity in the Reagan era, which underpins the appeal of Cruise’s persona. Male self-image in early 1980s America arguably became more attached to the earning potential of the middle classes, as the elite members of the generation born in the 1950s and 1960s ascended to high-income jobs. The creation of the term ‘yuppie’ – young urban professional19 – reflects the growth of this demographic type. Cruise flirts with this identity in Risky Business, the film that established his career in 1983. Released just as the US was beginning to come out of the economic downturn – though unemployment remained at over 8 per cent until well into 198420 – it reflects a growing interest in entrepreneurship, business and consumption of consumer goods. Cruise plays teenager Joel Goodsen, who is left alone in his family’s suburban home by his vacationing parents. Before long he has invited call girl Lana (Rebecca De Mornay) home and accidentally rolled his father’s Porsche into Lake Michigan. He joins forces with Lana to set up a\n\nP1: proof IBBK116-01\n\nTrim: 156mm × 234mm Top: 36pt Gutter: 50pt Visual Culture Royal 234 × 156 August 11, 2015 12:0\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ntemporary brothel to service his male peers, thereby making a fortune. Joel obtains a place at Princeton after a college interviewer turns up in the middle of a party and is impressed by his entrepreneurial drive. The film reflects the assertion of Quart and Auster that the 1980s came to be an age ‘whose commitment to profit, hedonism, and modern technology basically subverted its conservative political rhetoric’21 – although Joel capitulates to the dictates of heterosexual romance and ends the film in a relationship with Lana. The film reflects the preoccupations of 1980s culture and articulates the nascent Cruise persona, based on the enjoyment of conspicuous consumption while often highly versed in technological know-how: these aspects coalesce in the figure of Maverick in Top Gun. Top Gun was the number one film in US domestic rankings of 1986 and the film that made Cruise a star. Encapsulating aspects of the 1980s in America, it is still used as a symbol of this historical era. In Top Gun, Cruise’s fighter pilot demonstrates enthusiasm for high status retail goods, sporting Ray-Ban Aviator sunglasses, a leather jacket and a motorbike ridden at the side of the airstrips where he trains. As a fighter pilot for the US Navy, Pete ‘Maverick’ Mitchell has access to the expensive and technologically innovative hardware of war – the kind that Reagan’s government was spending a great deal of money on at the time. Top Gun expresses the third trend in America under the Reagan presidency: a renewed confidence in a military bruised by the defeat in the Vietnam War, a conflict that had elicited much anti-war sentiment in sections of the American public. By the mid 1980s, ‘Americans yearned for a return to greatness. They wanted a military with teeth, equipped to act and fortified by a commitment to a higher code’.22 The revival of a militaristic national self-image was orchestrated in part by Reagan’s reactivating of the Cold War through his ‘Star Wars’ missile defence programme (named after the film) and his patriotic rhetoric. Star Wars tied militaristic strength to the development of sophisticated technological hardware – the country’s great wealth securing military dominance without having to fight a land war, which had proved so damaging in Vietnam. It is this confidence and exultation in technological progress that is represented in Top Gun. So successful was the film in invigorating the reputation of the US military that Navy recruiters set up stalls in a number of cinemas showing Top Gun – applications from young men wanting to become naval aviators soared by 500 per cent after the film’s release.23 The film negotiates another aspect of the 1980s workplace: the ascent of women to senior professional roles (though not as widespread as Hollywood suggested in its representations at the time. Nor has parity of pay been accomplished: 2009 US census data revealed that women in America still earn 77.1 per cent of men’s earnings for equivalent work.)24 In Top Gun, Maverick discovers that the attractive blonde he tried to pick up at a bar is his new tutor, who holds a PhD in astrophysics and is older than him (and taller). This threat to male dominance is managed by creating a romance between the masculine nicknamed Charlie and Maverick,\n\n7\n\nTOM CRUISE\n\nP1: proof IBBK116-01\n\n8\n\nTrim: 156mm × 234mm Top: 36pt Gutter: 50pt Visual Culture Royal 234 × 156 August 11, 2015 12:0\n\nreducing her authority. Cruise’s later film A Few Good Men (Rob Reiner, 1992) is better able to negotiate these tensions without resorting to this ‘levelling’ technique: the film prohibits the development of the working relationship between naval lawyer Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee and senior officer Lieutenant Commander JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore) beyond friendship. One reading of Cruise’s tendency to play against older, taller or better educated women – such as in Days of Thunder (Tony Scott, 1990), in which he is a racing driver who becomes romantically involved with his female doctor – can be understood as a negotiation of male anxieties about senior women in the workplace. Competition is resolved by a capitulation to restrictive gender roles and sexual mastery over women. Cruise’s early films reflect a social conservatism that is symptomatic of the age. While women may be present in the workplace, often in positions of seniority, Cruise manages to gain the (sexual) upper hand. His persona reflects social conservatism in so far as he never attacks the system, seeking to find acceptance within it. Thus, in Risky Business he embraces an entrepreneurial business ethic in the place of an anti-establishment rhetoric. In Top Gun his goal is to win the trophy at the flight academy where he is a student, winning the admiration of his peers and proving to himself that he is ‘the best’. Maverick is haunted by the dishonour associated with his father, whose apparent desertion in Vietnam has blackened the family name. While Maverick eventually learns the truth about him – that he was ‘one heroic son-of-a-bitch’ – he spends most of the film preoccupied by his familial shame. Through the figure of Mitchell Senior, an attempt can be made to rehabilitate the past of Vietnam, which is what he represents for his son – and for audiences. The implication is that Maverick’s father was betrayed by the upper echelons of the military, in spite of fighting courageously. This reflects a reinterpretation of the Vietnam War that reasserts the courage of the soldiers who fought while blaming the American leadership which let them down. President Reagan, on the other hand, is representative of a government that can be trusted to lead effectively and restore America’s glory. The social implications of Cruise’s persona are significant, capturing the nature of the ideological compromise and social wish-fulfilment for a conflicted 1980s United States. However, the Cruise image can also be understood within a different framework, one that considers the importance of developmental psychosexual crisis to his persona. For this reason the use of Freud’s writings has been adopted in the latter portion of this study, to illuminate how Cruise’s star image explores key unconscious infantile anxieties. Father-son relationships provide social and psychological challenges for the young man – both of which align with issues of patriarchal hegemony and can be understood within a classical Freudian framework. Cruise does not challenge the figural fathers he finds himself up against. This signifies a lack of social rebellion but also an evasion of psychological challenge. If Cruise’s characters are confronted with psychodynamic tasks – namely, opposition to the rule of the father, which raises the spectre of castration within\n\nP1: proof IBBK116-01\n\nTrim: 156mm × 234mm Top: 36pt Gutter: 50pt Visual Culture Royal 234 × 156 August 11, 2015 12:0\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nthe Oedipal stage delineated by Freud – they never quite challenge patriarchal authority. Cruise’s films are full of ‘bad fathers’ who symbolise – just like the leadership which condemned Maverick’s father – the patriarchal authority gone awry that the figure of Reagan went some way to restore. It is not patriarchy per se that is bad, only the corrupt leaders within it. This is demonstrated in A Few Good Men, which shows Cruise as lawyer Daniel Kaffee challenging Colonel Jessep ( Jack Nicolson), who has flouted naval law in his fatal disciplining of a private. Cruise’s persona was formed at a time of great change in American society, stimulated by Reaganism’s shift in economic policy and emphasis on conservatism. Top Gun is the seminal work in laying down the core persona elements that will be recognisable in Cruise’s films two decades on; however, his image was by no means ‘fixed’ during this time, and has continued to be shaped, reiterated and eventually subverted, as his career progresses. His films reflect an idealisation of American identity, which Reaganism also encourages, while resolving anxieties around the place of modern man, especially in the workplace. He favours the skills of the upwardly mobile professional classes in his verbal fluency, sales pitch and attention to the deal. This may be as a salesman in Rain Man or a lawyer in A Few Good Men or The Firm (Sydney Pollack, 1993) or as a sports agent in Jerry Maguire. His preoccupation with image and consumer goods reflects the interests of young urban professionals. He is able to operate in a workplace increasingly dominated by women, while appearing to gain the upper hand. Moreover, he is symptomatic of a militaristic identity that promotes national self-image while evading involvement in combat – his portrayal of this type often includes an expertise in high-tech gadgetry (this is true of the later Mission: Impossible series as well as Top Gun). Finally, he is able to oppose corrupt patriarchs while supporting the existing order. His evasion of threat indicates the playing out of psychological issues as well as social ones – the overthrow of the old by the young and father by son. Cruise is often opposed to the patriarch while not actually going through with the challenge and facing his wrath.\n\nTom Cruise’s Star Persona Beginning with a chronological review of Cruise’s persona and a survey of his films to date, the opening chapter seeks to show how the persona has been formed, fixed and negotiated by the films he starred in, as well as how other factors – biographical, industrial and social – have influenced his star sign. This approach facilitates a tracing of the star’s nascent persona from his earliest films through to his most recent films, and considers in turn the major factors responsible for shaping his image. An overview of this kind also helps place Cruise within industrial, economic and historical contexts, locating him within a broader discourse of celebrity studies. This is especially useful for his later career, which has been increasingly subjected to the demands and iterations of new digital media forms. Following Cruise’s 9\n\nTOM CRUISE\n\nP1: proof IBBK116-01\n\n10\n\nTrim: 156mm × 234mm Top: 36pt Gutter: 50pt Visual Culture Royal 234 × 156 August 11, 2015 12:0\n\ncareer chronologically allows an examination of the alterations to his star persona informed by the films in which he has starred, the publicly documented events of his private life and his aging. The second section of the book explores Cruise’s persona in relation to issues of performance, gender and sexuality, taking as its focus the homoerotically marked performances that are in ascendance in the first half of his career. Chapter 2 considers certain paradoxes of gender inscription in the Cruise image and how they appear to be resolved in his various film roles, following Dyer’s assertion of the ideological work that stars engage in,25 which in turn echoes L´evi-Strauss’s argument regarding the social function of myth.26 The chapter is broadly divided into two halves. The first part addresses the star’s military films and the soldier roles that present an ideal masculinity, one that cannot possibly be attained. The second portion looks at Cruise’s performances in ‘staged’ settings, their homoerotic energy and their implications for the star’s ‘spectacular’ image. The two parts are linked by the premise that Cruise’s persona is based on the idea of ‘marked’ performances of manhood, which in their very citation assert the possibility for failure of the masculine ideal. Indeed, Cruise’s enactment of masculinity has the probability of failure built into his performance. Cruise’s frequent casting as an anxious male performer in a variety of professions is usefully illuminated by philosopher Judith Butler’s observations on the ‘performativity’ of gender. She defines ‘performativity’ as being based on the repetition of acts, gestures and words that create what we understand as gender, as opposed to expressing a pre-existing nature.27 Given the imitative nature of gender, it follows that all performances of gender are citations of citations – there is no original to be copied. This indicates a fundamental instability at the core of idealised gender norms. Cruise’s excessive performances of masculinity – the imperfect citation – highlight their own artificiality and his vulnerable manhood. Following on from this, writer Gaylyn Studlar argues that Cruise’s films emphasise ‘the notion of male identity as performative . . . anchored by the spectacle of the star’s body’.28 This has implications for how Cruise ‘tries on’ different identities in his films, usually signified by costumes, hairstyle and other visual indicators. It also signals how masculinity itself is a performance and the Cruise persona’s embodiment of this, which is explored at great length in the analysis of certain key films such as Risky Business, Cocktail and Magnolia. This emphasis on male spectacle is accompanied by, as writer Veronika Rall has noted, his films’ disinterest in the erotic potential of the leading lady, given her psychoanalytic figuration as the mother of the oral/cannibalistic stage – she is powerful, but not sexualised. Instead, her position in a typical Cruise film is marginal to the emotional – and often erotic – significance of the men with whom he interacts. Chapter 3 extends this account of Cruise’s marked performances and homoerotically inscribed male relationships, broadening out from a psychoanalytic account of the star’s narcissism and homoerotic inscription. It presents a social interpretation\n\nP1: proof IBBK116-01\n\nTrim: 156mm × 234mm Top: 36pt Gutter: 50pt Visual Culture Royal 234 × 156 August 11, 2015 12:0\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nof the Cruise figure who is constrained by formidable hegemonic forces, through the prism of racial difference. It offers an analysis of the films Jerry Maguire and Collateral (Michael Mann, 2004) in terms of their preoccupation with and – at least partial – endorsement of a capitalist economic model. This ideology is linked to the films’ depictions of race. Cruise is represented in a particular manner in relation to his black counterparts, with culturally deemed traits of ‘blackness’ assigned to his character; this suggests that the treatment of the Cruise body is, at one level, symptomatic of his powerlessness within patriarchal structures. Stereotypical depictions of black men situate African-American masculinity specifically, and non-white masculinity more generally, as physically and emotionally excessive. Such traits are shared by Cruise’s characters; where black characters figure in his films he is aligned with them. Moreover, a biracial buddy dynamic structures Jerry Maguire and Collateral, in dialogue with a longer history of American cinema and 1980s buddy films such as the Lethal Weapon series (Richard Donner, 1987; Richard Donner, 1989; Richard Donner, 1992) and Die Hard ( John McTiernan, 1988). In both Jerry Maguire and Collateral the treatment of race runs parallel to a consideration of capitalism – the African-American becomes a visual symbol of the American working class. The films suggest that, just like Cruise, these working-class men can aspire to the American Dream (though Collateral is ambiguous). In Jerry Maguire football player Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr) is able to make a fortune playing the sport he loves; in Collateral Max ( Jamie Foxx) dreams of becoming the owner of a limo firm. Both resemble Cruise and the films promote a solution to the difficulties of capitalism in the way that his characters do more broadly. In Jerry Maguire the free market ethic of professional sport has stolen the pleasure from the game and care from the players themselves. The previously cynical Maguire (Tom Cruise) decides sports agents should develop emotional ties with their clients and forms a close friendship with Tidwell, distracting from the financial contract that underpins their relationship. Both Jerry Maguire and Collateral are engaged in a de facto defence of capitalist society, privileging masculine bonds as a way of softening a harsh market ethic, and then sidelining these by the primacy of the heterosexual romantic couple. Nevertheless, the homoerotic dynamic of Cruise’s same-sex friendships remains compelling – we are never quite convinced that he has put these attachments aside fully in the name of heterosexual closure. The final section of the book presents a formally psychodynamic reading of Cruise’s persona, looking at key films of the actor that exemplify certain psychological preoccupations. As previously indicated, there is a shift in the presentation of Cruise’s body from his early to late career. In his earlier films, his body is offered up as spectacle; he is a self-pleasuring narcissist. This continues up until the end of the 1990s, when he is still presented as the object of an erotic look in films such as Magnolia. However, as he ages his body is increasingly covered up. He still provides moments of spectacle, in films such as Minority Report and The Last Samurai,\n\n11\n\nTOM CRUISE\n\nP1: proof IBBK116-01\n\nTrim: 156mm × 234mm Top: 36pt Gutter: 50pt Visual Culture Royal 234 × 156 August 11, 2015 12:0\n\nbut these are demonstrations of physical and technological skill as opposed to a presentation of a youthful, erotic physique. Instead, his body is more likely to suffer the attacks of a castrating patriarch and be subjected to bodily damage. Thus, this section takes as its study the father-son relationships of Cruise’s films, in particular those that characterise the later part of his career. The methodology of these chapters is based upon key classical Freudian psychoanalytic concepts in relation to developmental crisis, to better understand the psychodynamic basis of these conflicts and the ‘working through’ of key psychosexual issues. Chapter 4 examines the films of Cruise that figure a persecuting patriarch, taking the film Minority Report as a case study. It also relates this psychodynamic reading of the star back to the marginal social position that the Cruise figure so often occupies; thus there continues to be a dialogue between the psychoanalytic and social reading of his star sign. Freud’s writings on the Oedipus complex29 and masochism,30 are used to provide a psychodynamic interpretation of Cruise’s positioning as the fearful son suffering from castration anxiety. ‘Trauma’ in its psychoanalytic meaning, to make sense of the internal experiences of psychosexual development, is considered here; such ‘traumatic’ experiences find expression externally in Cruise’s films in the mistreatment he is subjected to by the father. Stella Bruzzi suggests that Cruise’s characters are the troubled sons of fathers who are alternatively neglectful or absent; often his films depict a coming to terms with a father who has been either idealised or rejected.31 Paternal failure and the son’s subsequent suffering are thus crucial to an understanding of Cruise; Oedipal concerns organise virtually all of his films. The dynamic his persona displays can be understood to represent a ‘compromise formation’, a term invented by Freud initially in his discussion of dreams to indicate the resolution of two contrary impulses: we find a struggle between two trends, of which one is unconscious and ordinarily repressed and strives towards satisfaction – that is, wish-fulfillment – while the other, belonging probably to the conscious ego, is disapproving and repressive. The outcome of this conflict is a compromise-formation (the dream or the symptom) in which both trends have found an incomplete expression.32\n\nCruise’s films stage the son’s wish to overthrow the father. This tension is resolved by an apparent challenge to the father that is ultimately an evasion – for the son’s enactment of masculinity and Oedipal strivings against the father are bound to failure. This compromise formation plays out repeatedly. Though he does not situate this concept in psychoanalytic terms, Dyer’s notion of stars as creations of two contradictory states, one based on reality and the other on wish-fulfilment, resolves itself in the ideological myth. This idea, in turn, links back to L´evi-Strauss’s assertion that myths function to resolve contradictory opposites within culture.33 The American Dream resolves the wish to be wealthy with the reality that most people are not and will not become rich, thus relieving psychic distress at the 12\n\nP1: proof IBBK116-01\n\nTrim: 156mm × 234mm Top: 36pt Gutter: 50pt Visual Culture Royal 234 × 156 August 11, 2015 12:0\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ninequity of society (and providing a form of social control for the ruling classes). When the evasive persona of Cruise is extended beyond the family, his social figuration is revealed as a powerless individual at the mercy of hegemonic forces. Although he has no possibility of asserting himself, he nevertheless projects the appearance of social mobility. In reality, under attack, he often requires rescuing – and by a woman. This is apparent in The Firm (Sydney Pollack, 1993), Eyes Wide Shut (Stanley Kubrick, 1999) and Minority Report (Steven Spielberg, 2002). The latter film explores the Oedipal issues present in Cruise’s image. Minority Report includes a case of child abduction (and imputed sexual abuse) which makes manifest the trauma of normal psychosexual development. Given these issues’ prominence for the Cruise persona, this makes it a critical example through which we may understand his other films. Chapter 5 extends this interpretation of the troubled filial dynamic further, suggesting how the patriarch’s rage can be interpreted as the projection of the male child’s own unconscious pre-genital homoerotic longings for the father. It concludes by relating this reading to a social analysis of martial sacrifice in Cruise’s military films, such as Valkyrie. The chapter takes an examination of the mythological Laius figure (Oedipus’s father) as its starting point. This reading considers the homosexual violence demonstrated by Laius towards his son as a representation of the male child’s own fear of his father’s sexual designs – this in turn is a projection of his own homosexual love towards his father at the pre-genital stage. Thus male violence can be read both psychoanalytically and socially. The aggression underpinning intergenerational male bonds is reflected on a social level by a sacrifice, most often through war, to expel hostility. Cruise provides a compromise formation as a military figure who escapes physical injury, one that reflects the Reaganite ‘Star Wars’ assertion of military might while avoiding combat. This is evident in the military or quasi-military films Top Gun and Mission: Impossible series, which rely on Cruise’s skilled use of martial technology. Successful evasion of bodily harm is complicated in his more recent films. In Minority Report and Valkyrie (Bryan Singer, 2009), Cruise’s body is increasingly subject to violence – in both films his eyes are damaged, recalling the castrating act of selfmutilation by Oedipus. More recently still, he contends not only with death but also the loss of his subjectivity, in Oblivion ( Joseph Kosinski, 2013), which sees the star’s character, Jack Harper, cloned. Perhaps this is a function of Cruise’s ageing persona. The compromise formation of evading paternal threat, concealed if played by a youthful man, becomes unsettling when enacted by an older one. In these films we see fuller representation of the patriarch’s castrating violence as the middle-aged Cruise challenges the existing order. Valkyrie is also defined by its foregrounding of intense male-male bonds. In previous films such as Jerry Maguire or The Last Samurai he substitutes his buddy relationship with heterosexual union. In Valkyrie he only gives up his homoerotic bond at the point of death; the father is just too dominant and cannot be overcome.\n\n13\n\nTOM CRUISE\n\nP1: proof IBBK116-01\n\nTrim: 156mm × 234mm Top: 36pt Gutter: 50pt Visual Culture Royal 234 × 156 August 11, 2015 12:0\n\nMore and more, Cruise’s films suggest that those in control are brutal and that the everyman is condemned to suffering. Valkyrie is no exception. Although the film is saved from total bleakness by historical reality (we know that the Allies beat the Nazis) it intensified the pessimism of Cruise’s prior work. Rather than a single corrupt father figure who can be ejected, as in A Few Good Men, here is a system that is entirely abhorrent, implicating Cruise’s Von Stauffenberg by his role as a senior officer in the German army. His revolt against the system and its leader – the most overt struggle against the father in Cruise’s filmography – ends in death. Valkyrie continues and intensifies the homoeroticism that is characteristic of Cruise’s persona. It brings together the homoerotic bonds typical of his films and concomitant lack of heterosexual interest (exaggerated by the all-male environment) with the terrifying patriarch from whom he is unable to escape. Cruise’s body is broken by the might of the patriarchy, first in the explosion that maims him, then in his assassination by firing squad. He is figuratively castrated by the patriarch, sacrificed to expel Oedipal aggression and dispel the threat that the son poses to the father. Even at this late age (the star by this time is in his late 40s) Cruise is unable to overcome the patriarch and accede to a place of power. The bleakest outlook yet may come in his 2013 film, Oblivion, which sees Cruise’s body cloned and reused in service to alien forces exploiting a desolate, post-apocalyptic earth, and ends with his death.\n\nConclusion One explanation for Cruise’s shifting persona may be found in his age. The compromise Cruise presents in the earlier part of his career is founded upon, in psychoanalytic terms, evading the threat of castration while appearing to challenge the father. In his earlier films, he is placed firmly in the oral/cannibalistic stage, in which his relations with his father are characterised by a homoerotic aspect. In social terms, he appears to rebel against authority, while being incorporated into the social order. For the compromise to work, Cruise must be a young man. His popular screen image is threatened by the limited longevity of the psychodynamic (and social) range of the persona. There are problems inherent in an older man taking on these challenges – the evasion is more unsettling, more transparent in its failure to confront the figural father. His physical ageing appears to force a progression to the phallic stage in which Oedipal challenge, and concomitant castration anxiety, become unavoidable. The book concludes by considering the implications of Cruise’s ageing body, as well as broader social factors, on the efficacy of the persona.\n\n14\n\nP1: proof IBBK116-01\n\nTrim: 156mm × 234mm Top: 36pt Gutter: 50pt Visual Culture Royal 234 × 156 August 11, 2015 12:0\n\n1 The Tom Cruise Persona Meanings of Persona In his writings on film stardom, Richard Dyer1 uses the term ‘star image’ to designate the discourse of the star as it is created by the films in which he or she appears, plus the extra-filmic ‘knowledge’ (true or false) circulated about the star. An early academic use of the term ‘star persona’ appears in Janet Thumin’s 1986 article ‘Miss Hepburn is humanized: the star persona of Katherine Hepburn’, defining ‘persona’ in this context to mean ‘a public image which derives from the performances and utterances of the person and is constructed over time in specific ways’.2 Thumin sets out the meaning of star persona in terms of Dyer’s ‘star image’ and its creation by the various media texts in circulation; thus the two terms are made synonymous. Dyer’s term ‘star image’ is perhaps broader than Thumin’s term, including information and ideas about the star beyond the personage of the star him- or herself, often beyond his or her lifetime. ‘Image’ in this usage can also suggest broader traits – such as youth, glamour, rebelliousness – which the star may represent.3 The subsequent scholarly adoption of ‘star persona’ incorporates all of these implications. My decision to employ the word ‘persona’ rather than ‘image’ (albeit not exclusively) relates to the specific characteristics of Cruise as a star. ‘Persona’ as a word invokes the idea of playing a part, a ‘performativity’ that is at the nub of this study of Cruise’s star persona. (This is not to say that Cruise has a star persona where other stars have only an image, but that the connotations of the word are well suited to his particular characteristics.) ‘Persona’ is the Greek term for mask, referring to the classical masks worn in the Theatre of Dionysus in Athens, which denoted exaggerated facial expressions that would be easy for audience members to read. The term also has roots in Latin, made up from ‘per’ meaning ‘through’ and ‘sonare’ meaning ‘to sound’ – that through which one speaks. This description encapsulates the double function of the mask, which acts as a projection for an audience and its juxtaposition to a private authentic core. The dual nature of the mask relates to conceptions of 15\n\nTOM CRUISE\n\nP1: proof IBBK116-01\n\n16\n\nTrim: 156mm × 234mm Top: 36pt Gutter: 50pt Visual Culture Royal 234 × 156 August 11, 2015 12:0\n\nstardom and the impulse to know the star beyond the personality projected in public and on screen, posing questions regarding the authenticity of the mask’s bearer. Of particular interest for Cruise’s persona is that his characters typically are role-players of certain masculine identities. The motif of the mask (or otherwise disguised visages) appears in films such as Mission: Impossible (Brian De Palma, 1996), Eyes Wide Shut (Stanley Kubrick, 1999) and Vanilla Sky (Cameron Crowe, 2001). This also recalls sociologist Erving Goffman’s work on the presentation of self in everyday life: he uses dramaturgical imagery to explore how people interact in day-to-day life, indicating how public behaviour is characterised by role play, performance and impression management.4 Dyer traces how the star image is constructed by the films in which the star appears (the film text holds a ‘privileged’ place in creation of the image); promotional materials, ‘produced as part of the deliberate creation/manufacture of a specific image’5 and publicity, which should not appear to be deliberate (as in the case of promotion) but authentic. He suggests that such publicity is ‘often taken to give a privileged access to the real person as star. It is also the place where one can read tensions between the star-as-person and his/her image, tensions which at another level become themselves crucial to the image.’6 Finally, the star image is created by criticisms and commentaries, which may and often do continue beyond the star’s lifetime. Dyer considers how stars figure in representation and the meaning of the characters they depict on screen. His analysis examines the often uneasy resolution of ideological contradictions that star ‘work’ is engaged in. The star is seen as a preserver of the conservative status quo, although Dyer maintains that the system is not closed and being ‘leaky’,7 allows readings and viewer pleasures that may go against the ideological grain. Stars may reinforce values under threat or be engaged in ‘concealing prevalent contradictions or problems’ within hegemonic ideology.8 They may also compensate people for their aspirational failures, shifting attention from one value to another ‘compensatory’ one. In Dyer’s account, a star image may help construct character in a variety of ways. There is its ‘selective use’ where certain features of the star image are highlighted and others are ignored. Thus in Cruise’s Mission: Impossible II ( John Woo, 2000), his typical vulnerability is almost absent from his character Ethan Hunt. This use of the star persona may be problematic as a film cannot always guarantee that the aspects of the image highlighted are those which most appeal to the audience9 (although Mission: Impossible II remains one of Cruise’s most profitable films). Another possibility, Dyer argues, is the ‘perfect fit’, in which all aspects of the star image and character seem to be harmonious, as one would expect in ‘vehicles’ developed for the star.10 We see this in Cruise’s films such as The Firm (Sydney Pollack, 1993) and Jerry Maguire (Cameron Crowe, 1996), in which the film seems tailored to the persona. There is also the possibility of the ‘problematic fit’, in which the existing star image seems to contradict the requirements of character. This conflict may be apparent and labelled ‘miscasting’ or the star may be able to\n\nP1: proof IBBK116-01\n\nTrim: 156mm × 234mm Top: 36pt Gutter: 50pt Visual Culture Royal 234 × 156 August 11, 2015 12:0\n\nTHE TOM CRUISE PERSONA\n\nresolve the contradictions present. The audience may ‘deny the truth of the star’s image vis-`a-vis the character’.11 However, Dyer concludes that this can only happen when the audience is unaware of the star image or the film is having a joke at the expense of the persona. Alternatively, the star image dominates and the character is brought into line with it. This is rare for Cruise. Even films such as Magnolia (Paul Thomas Anderson, 1999) and Collateral (Michael Mann, 2004) that appear to subvert the persona, utilise many of the image’s key traits (while ignoring others). One example of a potentially problematic fit is Tropic Thunder (Ben Stiller, 2008) in which Cruise plays Les Grossman, an abusive film producer. However, this is a deliberate inversion of his persona, which is played for comic effect. More recently, his casting as the titular Jack Reacher (Christopher McQuarrie, 2012), suggests a real mismatch between role and star persona, less to do with the physical disparity between the book character and the star (though this remained unpopular with fans of the novel series), than with aspects of Reacher that conflicted with the Cruise persona. Dyer’s perspective on stardom, so central to this analysis of Cruise, needs to be updated in the context of the modern media landscape. The information that contributes towards the star persona’s creation has in recent years been amplified by the growth of the internet and the additional material that it presents – fan sites, YouTube postings, online journalism, blogs and reader comments. Much of this is created by members of the public and is beyond the control of the star and those employed to maintain his or her image. The development of new media has, P. David Marshall suggests, created a ‘shift to a more presentational and personal mediation of culture from its more representational culture’.12 In this changing arena, film is losing its place at the centre of the cultural commodities market and with it, its prestige. It is an uncertain time to be a Hollywood film star – Marshall notes that as film loses its hegemonic cultural position there is a concomitant diminishment of the significance of its stars. ‘Stardom’, a word if not solely then predominantly associated with the film star, has been replaced by ‘celebrity’, a term covering a much larger cross-section of figures in the public eye (with associated connotations of the diminished view in which the general public often holds the latter). The celebrity landscape is a difficult one for the film star to occupy. The ‘immediate repercussion of this change has been an intensification of film celebrity stories and publicity’13 as film stars are forced to work harder to keep their image in public circulation. Describing Cruise’s erratic behaviour over the course of 2005, he suggests that the star ‘ensured that cameras, commentators and bloggers were regularly talking about his brazen public actions’.14 Thus, any kind of publicity, including scandal, has the potential to be harnessed for the furtherance of the star image and his films, yet simultaneously indicates stars’ lessening importance in the culture. The imperative to generate publicity of any kind is a high-risk strategy, as can be seen in the erosion of Cruise’s popularity. He may have suffered more than most\n\n17\n\nTOM CRUISE\n\nP1: proof IBBK116-01\n\n18\n\nTrim: 156mm × 234mm Top: 36pt Gutter: 50pt Visual Culture Royal 234 × 156 August 11, 2015 12:0\n\nstars from the user-driven product that the internet has enabled: doctored footage of his 2005 appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show was uploaded to YouTube, as were clips from the Today Show with Matt Lauer in which Cruise debated the merits of anti-depressants with his host. Footage which caught Cruise in a heated moment crying, ‘You don’t know the history of psychiatry. I do’, was widely uploaded and commented upon. This was followed in January 2008 by the online posting of an International Association of Scientology video, created for its members and featuring Cruise, which soon made its way to YouTube. The film in question featured Cruise’s acceptance of Scientology’s ‘Freedom Medal of Valor’ and an accompanying interview espousing the views of the cult. He was frank about his views on the mental health profession: ‘psychiatrists, I’ve had it, I’ve had it with them. It’s disgusting.’ The footage had been filmed in 2004 and was already familiar to journalistic and anti-Scientology circles. However, it was not until its posting on the internet that its full influence on the public’s perception of Cruise was realised. The video had been designed for an audience sharing Cruise’s own beliefs and was revealing of both the star and the organisation. Unlike other material that had damaged Cruise’s image, such as his ‘couch jumping’ episode on Oprah, the award ceremony had not been televised. The impact of previously aired footage has the potential to alter with its recirculation online. In this case, the clips were circulated on YouTube and reached a much larger audience. The editing of longer programmes, such as the Matt Lauer show, into short clips exaggerated Cruise’s outlandish behaviour. In such instances, the original producers and performers have little control over their later manifestations (though footage may be removed from a site such as YouTube in cases of copyright infringement). Yet each permutation filters into the persona. The importance of the internet for the star’s persona was underlined when Cruise appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman in December 2008 and was invited to read out a list of ‘Top Ten craziest things said about Tom Cruise on the internet’. Entry No. 4 – ‘I believe all emotional and psychological disorders can be cured with Vicks Vaporub’ – was an obvious allusion to Cruise’s Scientology anti-psychiatry stance which was now common knowledge. Although this and other TV appearances have attempted to defuse the damage that internet material has done to the Cruise persona it seems likely that this new discourse has had an impact on Cruise’s popularity and by extension his box office success. Moderate US domestic box office returns for Cruise’s film Knight and Day (Roy Miller) in 2010 were described by many – journalists, Hollywood insiders and internet bloggers – as a consequence of his prior eccentric behaviour. Another possibility is that financial failure has resulted from the nature of the projects that Cruise has chosen to star in. These films may not facilitate the vulnerable persona demonstrated in films such as Jerry Maguire and Magnolia that has proved so popular with audiences. This is the case in Knight and Day, in which Cruise’s character Ray Knight is symptomatic of the ‘problematic fit’ that\n\nP1: proof IBBK116-01\n\nTrim: 156mm × 234mm Top: 36pt Gutter: 50pt Visual Culture Royal 234 × 156 August 11, 2015 12:0\n\nTHE TOM CRUISE PERSONA\n\nDyer suggests the star may encounter with certain roles. Knight exhibits the mania typical of the Cruise persona without displaying the vulnerability underlying it. The resulting character is inexplicable and even disturbing. The writer David Thomson makes a similar point when he argues for Cruise to take more ‘dead-beat’ parts, playing the underdog and reprising the type of role that made his previous films so successful. He also suggests that such films might better reflect the depressed mood and resignation of the American public in what was predicted to be the longest recession since World War II.15 Such a suggestion acknowledges the place Hollywood film has in sustaining hegemonic ideology and providing a compromise for audiences that ‘resolves’ ideological contradictions. What Thomson overlooks, however, is that Cruise has always played a ‘small fellow . . . getting dumped on’.16 The Cruise persona as it existed prior to 2005 offers his ‘over-enthusiasm’ as a manic defence against the threatening situation that the Cruise character finds himself faced with. Thomson is right to draw attention to Cruise’s age – in 2010 he had turned 48 – as a factor in the star’s waning popularity. He draws comparisons to successful middle-aged stars of the postwar era such as Bogart, who at 48 had just made The Big Sleep (Howard Hawks, 1946), and Gary Cooper, who had starred in The Fountainhead (King Vidor, 1949). Montgomery Clift, a star to whom ready comparisons can be drawn with Cruise, was already dead. Bogart and Cooper are more adult than Cruise, whose persona is contingent on playing a boyish man struggling in an adult world, a position that is increasingly difficult to sustain as the star ages.\n\nCruise’s Persona Cruise’s ascent to stardom coincides with the loss of confident blue-collar masculinity in the USA and the decline of American direct military power with the defeat in Vietnam. The reduction in industrial employment coincided with the increasing presence of women in the workforce and a shift to service industry jobs characterised by ‘feminine’ skill sets. Cruise’s image presents a compromise to such social tensions, able to reconcile masculinity in the post-industrial workplace, where men no longer claim pride from their physical labour. Cruise is the white collar working man, upwardly aspiring to the middle class and indulging in conspicuous consumption. While he does not rely on the ‘masculine’ traits of physical strength and aggression, he nevertheless displays traits such as technological expertise and training, which can be understood as specifically middle-class masculine attributes. In this way, the Cruise image gives expression to, and appears to resolve, certain ideological contradictions centring round masculinity within modern Western culture. The ‘work’ undertaken by the star resonates with L´evi-Strauss’s model of the social function of myth, as well as the psychoanalytic notion of resolution and wish-fulfilment presented within dreams. In addition to the social wish-fulfilment that is given expression by his screen image is the ‘solution’ the Cruise persona 19\n\nTOM CRUISE\n\nP1: proof IBBK116-01\n\n20\n\nTrim: 156mm × 234mm Top: 36pt Gutter: 50pt Visual Culture Royal 234 × 156 August 11, 2015 12:0\n\npresents to psychosexual developmental crisis. This is the second element of the psychoanalytic approach by this study, which focuses on the application of key Freudian texts to interpret the developmental themes present in Cruise’s films. Cruise’s persona is that of a young man on the cusp of adulthood. He acts as if masculinity has already been achieved, but this remains role-play, a trying on of parts; he is often a trainee in the world he inhabits, never at the top of his field. He sends out conflicting signals: he challenges authority but does not overthrow it. He rebels but does not lead. He mixes with men but often seems uneasy in their company. He is poised between childhood carelessness and adult responsibility. He is pretty (feminine) yet physically active (masculine), often depicted running and climbing, yet rarely aggressive. When he is aggressive, it comes out in a rage against the father, a moment of suppressed anger unleashed. Cruise’s characters are often in danger of regressing to a feminine identification, and usually come across as sympathetic to, but not desiring of, women. They relate to women as mother figures, seeking their help and protection – in his films he is often rescued by a woman. At times his actions endanger women, and his films feature abused women. This repeated plotting suggests an unconscious misogyny on the part of the Cruise persona in these films. This relation to women is linked to a failure to identify with the male gaze – Cruise’s look is rarely that of a desiring male gazing at an eroticised woman. Quite the opposite, it is Cruise who usually inhabits this exhibitionist space and solicits the male gaze himself. The final section of the book discusses the possibility that this autoerotic presentation lends itself to a psychodynamic interpretation. Engagement with a classical Freudian and Kleinian conceptualisation of infant and child development will help understand the figuration of Cruise in this way. As indicated above, his characters are typically positioned in relation to older, higher status women and this invokes the figure of the Kleinian ‘archaic’ mother. A phenomenon of the oral/cannibalistic psychosexual stage that the infant passes through, the mother (or the part-object, the breast) has the power to deny or grant the child’s desire to feed and is thus experienced as all-powerful. Frustration of the child’s desire to feed provokes his or her rage; the child then engages in destructive fantasies of devouring the breast and, in turn, of being devoured.17 The ill-treatment that many of Cruise’s female counterparts suffer in his films can thus be interpreted, psychodynamically, as a destructive consequence of the anger that the infant feels towards the mother. Another characteristic of the oral/cannibalistic stage of male infant development is an unconscious homoerotic impulse towards the father. This would explain why Cruise’s characters are preoccupied with male relationships, which are often defined by a homoerotic aspect, in films as diverse as Top Gun, Cocktail, Interview With the Vampire and Jerry Maguire. In addition, Cruise often plays a supplicant role with older men. He is frequently the victim of a scrutinising, sadistic communal male gaze, and though he appears to evade physical dispute with other men, the\n\nP1: proof IBBK116-01\n\nTrim: 156mm × 234mm Top: 36pt Gutter: 50pt Visual Culture Royal 234 × 156 August 11, 2015 12:0\n\nTHE TOM CRUISE PERSONA\n\nthreat of violence or mistreatment is never far away. Psychodynamically, this can be understood as an expression of the castration anxiety that the young boy feels towards his father, in fear of retaliation for his wish to kill the patriarch and take possession of his mother. It indicates the shift from the oral/cannibalistic phase of infanthood to the phallic stage and Oedipal challenge, which provokes the castrating rage of the father. This physical threat becomes more overt as he ages, indicating a change to his ageing persona, with films such as Minority Report, Mission: Impossible III ( J.J. Abrams, 2006) and Valkyrie depicting Cruise’s body as increasingly injured. He typically attempts to talk his way out of conflict and, failing that, he tries to flee; he evades conflict with the father figure. (It is significant that he is a much more talkative figure in his films than his action film peers.) His aggression emerges under stress as a loss of control and undirected violence. Cruise does not wish to rebel against the system, but to be accepted into it. He never becomes his own lawmaker but accepts in the end conventional authority, albeit now reformed, as seen in Minority Report. In Cruise’s films the ‘bad’ father is eventually defeated and the woman is rescued. However, this is never through his bravery or combat. He wins by luck, cunning, female assistance, running away and acrobatic exhibitionism. In psychodynamic terms, it forms a ‘compromise formation’ in which Cruise recedes from Oedipal threat and regresses to an earlier psychosexual phase – that of the oral/cannibalistic stage.\n\nThe Early Persona of Tom Cruise Like many stars’ biographies, Cruise’s own story presents itself as an example of the ‘American Dream’ success story. The narrative highlights his childhood poverty and his mother’s struggle to raise a family alone. It also points to an estranged relationship with his father. Cruise’s discovery of acting is presented in similar mythological terms: the night before a high school wrestling match, desperate to shed a couple of pounds to make his weight category, he started racing up and down his stairs. Unfortunately, he tripped and sprained his ankle. No longer able to perform in school sports at a competitive level due to the injury, he found acting to be a worthy substitute. While this story follows a long line of American male star biographies intimating the accidental discovery of acting as a pursuit,18 the combination of two alternate gendered impulses – the possibly effeminate pursuit of acting against the masculine, physically dominating sport of wrestling – is particularly prescient for Cruise’s star persona. This juxtaposition of masculine and feminine traits is evident in Cruise’s very first role, at the age of 19, in Franco Zeffirelli’s Endless Love (1981). A scene opens with his character Billy playing football. Abandoning the game he joins his friends at the side of the pitch where he peels off his vest and lies back in the grass. He is athletic, physically on display and boastful with his peers, who remain suspicious of him – all elements that are developed across his career. This empty bravado is 21\n\nTrim: 156mm × 234mm Top: 36pt Gutter: 50pt Visual Culture Royal 234 × 156 August 11, 2015 12:0\n\nTOM CRUISE\n\nP1: proof IBBK116-01\n\nFigure 1 Top Gun (Paramount, 1986). Maverick’s smile.\n\nalso present in his next film, TAPS (Harold Becker, 1981). It was the first film in which Cruise had a significant role. TAPS exploited the onscreen intensity that, according to one East Coast producer early in his career, made Cruise unsuitable for television.19 He plays the trigger-happy cadet David Shawn who, along with his fellow students, takes over his military school to prevent its imminent closure. The film provides, while critiquing, a presentation of young men playing at being soldiers; it is a game that Shawn takes more seriously than the others. Under siege by the local National Guard, his peers are on the point of surrender. Refusing to admit defeat, he starts spraying the enemy with bullets, grinning like a maniac, moments before he is killed in a hail of bullets. At this moment, P. David Marshall suggests, ‘the smile and the grin indicate the reckless insanity of the personality’; 20 but this ‘killer smile’21 ultimately becomes Cruise’s trademark. Less often a sign of insanity, Cruise’s smile has become a symbol of his easy accomplishment, achievement without application (Figure 1). ‘His famous smile expresses the Hollywood masculine myth in one dazzling grin: easy, spontaneous, irresistibly natural.’22 The smile is remarked on frequently in the media, particularly in comparison with other established stars: ‘He has the killer smile that Nicholson and Redford have’, claims casting director Ellen Chenoweth.23 Yet each of these stars’ smiles connotes quite different qualities: Redford’s suggests charismatic warmth from an ageing sex symbol; Nicholson’s indicates a streak of instability, if not downright devilishness. Cruise’s grin is complex, concealing as much as it may be supposed to reveal. It defines his boyish cockiness and is part of a manic defence concealing the vulnerability beneath its surface. The grin is sent up in Cruise’s cameo appearance as Austin Powers in the ‘film within the film’ of Austin Powers in Goldmember ( Jay Roach, 2002). In addition to the velvet suit, frilly shirt 22\n\nP1: proof IBBK116-01\n\nTrim: 156mm × 234mm Top: 36pt Gutter: 50pt Visual Culture Royal 234 × 156 August 11, 2015 12:0\n\nTHE TOM CRUISE PERSONA\n\nand thick glasses of Powers, he wears a set of dentures displaying rotten teeth – a reference to the stereotyped American perception of British dental hygiene – in opposition to Cruise’s perfect white smile. Yet in the early stages of Cruise’s career, the grin was less important than his youthful physicality. P. David Marshall recognises this latter attribute in Cruise’s progression to star status. In Celebrity and Power (1997), Marshall uses the definitions, first employed by Richard deCordova to chart the historical development of the star system, of physical performer (a ‘type’), through to picture personality (a recognisable figure) and then to star, to map Cruise’s career. Marshall argues that Cruise’s ‘emergence as a film actor and star is first connected to the physicality of his performance’24 grounded in his youth. This is an aspect developed by his association with sports where Cruise’s athletic (and partially clad) physique is on display for the characters and spectators of the film. For Marshall, Cruise’s easy success is an important part of his persona, ‘most often manifested around either sports/athleticism or the managing of sophisticated technology’.25 Depictions of sporting endeavours are prominent in his films, including those which are not principally about the activity, such as Endless Love: soccer, All the Right Moves (Michael Chapman, 1983): American football, Top Gun (Tony Scott, 1986): volleyball, Cocktail (Roger Donaldson, 1988): basketball, A Few Good Men (Rob Reiner, 1992): baseball, and The Firm (Sydney Pollack, 1993): basketball. There are also the ‘high contact’ combative sports of Far and Away (Ron Howard, 1992): boxing and Born on the Fourth of July (Oliver Stone, 1990): wrestling, which are performed for an audience. However, not all of Cruise’s early films exploited this nascent persona trait of athleticism and bodily energy. Losin’ It (Curtis Hanson, 1983) barely acknowledged Cruise’s previous role in TAPS. In this 1960s period teen road trip film, Cruise plays one of four teenage boys travelling to Tijuana with the goal of losing their virginity. The film comes at the end of a cycle of male teen sex comedies such as National Lampoon’s Animal House ( John Landis, 1978) and Porky’s (Bob Clark, 1982), which follow the sexual exploits of their male protagonists and are characterized by a high level of ‘gross out’ comedy. In Losin’ It Cruise portrays a sensitive teenager – wholly lacking the bravado of TAPS’s Shawn – who fulfils his friends’ joint mission by sleeping with older woman Shelley Long. This is not atypical for the genre; as Mandy Merck notes, ‘Male sexual initiation by a maternally inflected older girl or woman is a venerable feature of teen comedies’,26 citing Porky’s and the much later American Pie (Paul and Chris Weitz, 1999) as two examples. The relationship also anticipates Cruise’s subsequent romantic pairings with a maternal figure that are so characteristic of his films and can be understood within a Kleinian framework as indicative of regression to the oral/cannibalistic psychosexual stage. Marshall’s statement that Cruise’s early films are on the whole ‘intensely focused on youth and, more or less, on rebellion’27 recurs in the two films that followed Losin’ It. Cruise plays the teenager Stefen in All the Right Moves, who wants to\n\n23\n\nTOM CRUISE\n\nP1: proof IBBK116-01\n\n24\n\nTrim: 156mm × 234mm Top: 36pt Gutter: 50pt Visual Culture Royal 234 × 156 August 11, 2015 12:0\n\nbreak away from his familial tradition of working in the local steel works and earn a college football scholarship. The narrative centres round a falling-out with his football coach and how this threatens his chances of college. Although the bluecollar Pennsylvania background does not fit the later Cruise image, nevertheless the aspirations of the young Stefen and the utilisation of his skills of performance to succeed anticipate the persona. So does the conflict with the football coach, who in his domineering punishment of Stefen anticipates the later father figures who torment Cruise. In his next film, The Outsiders (Francis Ford Coppola, 1983), Cruise was one of a number of young actors, along with Patrick Swayze, Rob Lowe, Emilio Estevez, Ralph Macchio and Matt Dillon, who starred in an adaptation of S.E. Hinton’s 1960s cult novel. He plays one member of the workingclass ‘greasers’ gang’ who are rivals of the better off ‘socials’. Cruise’s role as Steve Randle is marginal, yet the film makes use of the bulked up body previously displayed in TAPS, with the muscular actor sporting a sleeveless denim jacket in the film’s publicity. Acting in Coppola’s film was an early indication of his drive to work with notable directors which continues to punctuate his career – to date, he has worked with Martin Scorsese, Ridley and Tony Scott, Steven Spielberg, Neil Jordan, Oliver Stone, Michael Mann and Stanley Kubrick. The Outsiders, though less financially successful than TAPS, nevertheless brought Cruise to the attention of Warner Brothers, who would later give him the role of teenager Joel Goodson in Risky Business (Paul Brickman 1983). It was not an obvious casting choice. After playing David Shawn in TAPS, Cruise was initially offered only ‘killer-murderer parts’ in horror films.28 When his name was put forward for the protagonist of Risky Business, writer/director Brickman was quick to dismiss him: ‘This guy is a killer – let him do Amityville III.’29 Cruise ultimately won the role in a film that took tenth place at the American box office in 1983. Marshall argues that in Risky Business Cruise moved from being a ‘physical type’ – a beautiful torso and manic grin – to a ‘picture personality’, with a recognisable presence and personality beyond his film parts. It cemented key aspects of the persona, making him much more than the grinning, maniacal boy of TAPS. Following the opening credits of Risky Business, the film’s first image shows the reflection of an eye on a dark surface. Zooming out reveals more of the surface, finally apparent as the lens of a pair of sunglasses, then Cruise’s boyish, fleshy face, a cigarette hanging from his lip. He is childish looking but the sunglasses indicate self-conscious image promotion and the cigarette suggests an adult posturing. It is representative of the bravado demonstrated in his early roles, a defence against the vulnerability he so wishes to hide. It also establishes sunglasses as a recurring prop used by Cruise and linked to his self-presentation. The Ray-Bans Cruise wears in Risky Business reappear in a number of his films, such as the use of the Wayfarer model in Risky Business and the Aviator model in Top Gun, identifying his persona with the brand. The Wayfarer has been associated with Hollywood since the model’s inception in 1952. Popularised by figures such as\n\nP1: proof IBBK116-01\n\nTrim: 156mm × 234mm Top: 36pt Gutter: 50pt Visual Culture Royal 234 × 156 August 11, 2015 12:0\n\nTHE TOM CRUISE PERSONA\n\nAudrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe, James Dean and Roy Orbison, it had fallen out of fashion by the 1980s. In 1982 a sponsorship deal for $500,000 between Ray-Ban and Unique Product Placement at Burbank, California guaranteed RayBans a presence in US television and films.30 Before the deal, annual Wayfarer sales were estimated at 18,000; after Cruise’s use of them in Risky Business (including an image of him wearing them on the film’s publicity poster), sales shot up to 360,000. (Later Don Johnson in Miami Vice and Bruce Willis in Moonlighting would further stimulate sales to over 800,000.) Most famous of all is Cruise’s association with Ray-Ban’s Aviator model in Top Gun, whose annual sales were estimated to have risen by 40 per cent in response to the film.31 The referential use of the sunglasses is reiterated in Rain Man and Jerry Maguire, the latter invoking ‘the cool image of Tom Cruise (Ray-Bans now hiding a black eye)’.32 The Ray-Bans identify Cruise’s persona with the conspicuous consumption of the young American man, spending money on the accoutrements of appearance. This type of consumption may have indicated more consumer choice for some but lessening political influence, especially for the working classes of America, whose traditional industries and associated communities were being hit hard by the policies of the Reagan administration and its decision to move the US economy away from its traditional dependence on manufacturing. According to Mark Simpson ‘Tom Cruise was the perfect cinematic embodiment of the new male narcissism that emerged in the mid-80s’.33 Cruise likes to look good, spend money on his appearance and is aspirational in outlook. This narcissism is also symptomatic of powerlessness. His characters’ lack of influence stands in contrast to their controlled image projection. Sunglasses are also used as a narcissistic prop to conceal undesirable emotion or to project bravado – both utilised in Cruise’s performances. (As well as a signifier of vanity, sunglasses are a marker of stardom, a conspicuous attempt to go incognito. Cruise’s publicity, even now, often shows him posing in shades – though it is not clear that he has, or ever had, an official sponsorship deal with the Ray-Ban brand.) Such narcissism is also written over the eroticised body of the young Cruise, beginning with his cameo as Billy in Endless Love and reaching its peak as Maverick in Top Gun lunging for a volley ball. His is an ‘All-American brand of boyish bodily sexiness, a cinnamon flavoured studliness – a pure and wholesome indulgence’.34 Cruise spends these early films in a state of partial undress, more or less dictated by the narrative. TAPS depicts Shawn lifting weights, muscles bulging, while other cadets rest in their rooms. All the Right Moves (Michael Chapman, 1983) opens with Cruise as the sleeping Stefen who staggers out of bed wearing black boxers (and a gold crucifix), the puppy fat of Risky Business now shed to reveal a muscled torso. Images of his father and brother coming home from the steel works are juxtaposed with Stefen doing press-ups on his bedroom floor – their exploited corporeality contrasted with his exhibitionist masculinity. A later locker room scene reveals Stefen and a number of semi-clad football players grinding their hips alongside their teammates.\n\n25\n\nTOM CRUISE\n\nP1: proof IBBK116-01\n\nTrim: 156mm × 234mm Top: 36pt Gutter: 50pt Visual Culture Royal 234 × 156 August 11, 2015 12:0\n\nIt is a precursor of the locker room scenes from Top Gun and is cited by Cuba Gooding Jr’s locker room nakedness in Jerry Maguire. The mise-en-sc`ene of the stage is apparent as early as Risky Business. The dance sequence in this film presents an exhibitionist Cruise enjoying himself in front of an imaginary crowd. Finding himself home alone for the first time, Joel (Tom Cruise) turns on his father’s stereo system. The arched doorway of the suburban living room frames the hall and stairs: he slides into view, wearing only a shirt, socks and white boxer shorts. He proceeds to dance and grind his body against a poker grabbed from the fire place, delivering air guitar to the resonant twangs of the sound track – and finishes the scene by launching himself on the couch, kicking his legs in the air, flashing his white boxers. This autoerotic exhibitionism is more muted in Cruise’s next project, Ridley Scott’s fairytale fantasy Legend (1986), in which he plays Jack. The character’s childish love of kinetic rather than purposeful activity is an element that Cruise’s star persona has retained. A malevolent father figure is present in the form of Tim Curry’s Lord of Darkness, who has designs of reigning over a world cloaked in perpetual night. The film’s fairytale qualities exaggerate the absolute power of this terrifying patriarch. As both Jack and the Princess Lily (Mia Sara) are very young, their romance is portrayed as chaste, driving the quest rather than providing an erotic subplot. Challenged to recover her ring from a pool with the promise that she will grant her hand in marriage if he succeeds, he returns to the surface of the water to discover that the Lord of Darkness has kidnapped her. Thus the challenge of the fairytale quest is set with little emphasis on a physical relationship between the pair. This fits the pattern of Cruise’s nascent persona: little overt romantic interest in the heroine and a compelling fear of the father.\n\nTop Gun and Stardom Less than a month after Legend was released on American screens came the film that helped determine Cruise as a star. Produced by Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, Top Gun (Tony Scott, 1986) opened on 16 May to become the week’s highest grossing film in the US, ‘a number one hit movie all about being number one’.35 It was the top domestic grossing film of 1986. Cruise’s new ability to generate audiences saw his star worth soar. Top Gun is still the film that audiences most associate with Cruise. As Mark Simpson suggests, even the name Tom Cruise and Top Gun have graphical and aural similarities.36 The homoerotic male display that characterises the film is responsible for defining the persona. Ray-Bans, now in the Aviator style, are worn by Cruise riding a motorbike: the ultimate in consumer desirability. His character embodies the persona’s contradictions: a macho Navy pilot flying high-tech fighter planes, yet objectified in a manner typical of Hollywood’s representation of women. He projects ‘nononsense masculine values’, argues Simpson,37 yet his physical attributes indicate a contradictory image: ‘his round face, baby blue eyes and surprisingly high-pitched 26\n\nP1: proof IBBK116-01\n\nTrim: 156mm × 234mm Top: 36pt Gutter: 50pt Visual Culture Royal 234 × 156 August 11, 2015 12:0\n\nTHE TOM CRUISE PERSONA\n\nvoice send out an ambiguous undertow; an undertow which is the real appeal of his screen presence, which makes him both desirable and desiring’.38 Such boyish attributes are exaggerated by 5ft 6in Cruise being cast against 6ft plus co-stars who tower over him. His love interest Charlie, possessing a gender-ambiguous name, is older, more senior, better educated (she holds a PhD) and taller than Maverick, adding to her maternal figuring. As Cruise’s career continued, his stature became increasingly commented upon, alluded to by the popular press to denigrate him. Although many film stars past and present have been of a similar height (from Alan Ladd to Paul Newman, Robert Redford and Mel Gibson), few have been targeted in the same manner as Cruise. His short stature has been exploited to project his boyish persona – as well as Top Gun, films such as The Firm and Eyes Wide Shut exaggerate the actor’s shortness – perhaps the reason it is so commonly noted. The boyishness connoted by Cruise’s stature is shored up by the immature behaviour of Maverick and his fellow officers in Top Gun. The airmen show off for one another, and ‘being the best’ is all about impressing one’s peers. This concern with appearances is consistent with male adolescents unable to effect real change; although the pilots fly military planes, they attend a training school and are not engaged in real life combat. Maverick is only accepted by his former supervisor at the close of the film, once he has defeated a real enemy threat (he blows up a Russian MiG) while on assignment. He is now engaged in man’s work, not as a trainee. Yet this acceptance by the father does not negate the fact that Cruise has spent the course of the film playing at being a naval aviator, donning the part along with the uniform. Dress is important for Cruise – whether a uniform of the armed forces, a business suit or sportswear – indicating how he puts on and takes off his roles. It indicates childishness, with his uniforms often appearing too neat to be used as work wear. Such clothing appears as pretend masculine dress: it is Tom Cruise dressing up as a soldier, an aviator, a racing driver, a samurai, in order to achieve a feminine aim – to be looked at. The number of locker room scenes in which these pilots parade around in their underwear or white towels while bandying expletives of ‘my dick’ and ‘my ass’39 suggests a greater preoccupation with their beautiful bodies than with their professional skills. Top Gun’s overt homoeroticism has been referenced a number of times in the popular media: Will Young’s music video for the song ‘Switch It On’ parodies many scenes from the film, including its famous volleyball sequence. The 1994 film Sleep With Me (Rory Kelly) features a cameo by Quentin Tarantino describing Top Gun thus: ‘It is a story about a man’s struggle with his own homosexuality. It is! That is what Top Gun is about, man.’ Although co-star Val Kilmer has subsequently been cast in reference to the ‘camp’ qualities of Top Gun – he was private eye ‘Gay Perry’ in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (Shane Black, 2005) – it is Cruise’s star image that has borne the film’s homoerotic charge. Two elements contribute to this state of affairs: the first is his positioning in the mise-en-sc`ene, which emphasises his objectification as youthful, beautiful and erotic. The second is the marginal place assigned to the female lead in relation to\n\n27\n\nTOM CRUISE\n\nP1: proof IBBK116-01\n\nTrim: 156mm × 234mm Top: 36pt Gutter: 50pt Visual Culture Royal 234 × 156 August 11, 2015 12:0\n\nCruise. There appears to be little onscreen ‘chemistry’ – visible attraction, interest or excitement – observable between them. This has been a trend in his career (as has the relative lack of his female co-stars’ subsequent career progression – Renee Zellweger and Kidman being the only two real exceptions). Cruise’s films are rarely centred on heterosexual romance: Top Gun’s Kelly McGillis plays the role of a ‘beard’ (a heterosexual prop to dispel possible accusations of homosexuality on the part of Maverick); Cocktail’s Elisabeth Shue (and Gina Gershon) are distractions to the tension between Doug Couglin (Bryan Brown) and Brian Flanagan (Tom Cruise). Renee Zellweger’s Dorothy is less appealing than the charismatic Cuba Gooding Jr’s Rod Tidwell, who strikes up a close bond with Jerry Maguire. As Gaylyn Studlar argues, in many of Cruise’s films ‘intensity of commitment and feeling is displaced from the heterosexual to the homosocial to the homoerotic’.40 Even when he stars with his wife Nicole Kidman in Days of Thunder (Tony Scott, 1990) and Far and Away, as well as the later Eyes Wide Shut, their romantic pairing is less charged than his close male relationships. The sexual transgression quality of Cruise’s persona manifests itself beyond the films in which he stars. Studlar asserts that this can be discerned in the slippage between the construction of his onscreen desirability as both a homoerotic and heteroerotic sign and offscreen fan inscriptions of him as the object of gay desire coupled with media innuendoes to the effect that he is gay.41\n\nSuch is the strength of these rumours that popular writer David Ehrenstein dedicated an entire chapter of his book Open Secret: Gay Hollywood 1928–1998 to Cruise. Ehrenstein argues that the actual fact of Cruise’s sexuality is less interesting than his homosexual image and offers no speculation as to Cruise’s real life sexual preferences. He does, however, note Cruise’s tendency to sue publications that have intimated that he is gay in real life.42 When Cruise divorced his second wife Nicole Kidman in 2002 various publications speculated that his sexuality had caused the split. Cruise was quick to file a one million dollar lawsuit against one of these claims. Chad Slater, formerly an actor in pornographic films, denied that he had ever told the French magazine Acustar about an alleged relationship with Cruise, said to have caused his marital split. Slater claimed that he had not made any such statement, or indeed even knew Cruise. Ultimately Acustar published a retraction. Three years later came the affair dubbed ‘Closetgate’. A now infamous episode of South Park was broadcast in which a character called Tom Cruise refuses to emerge from a clothes closet. A repeat due to air in March 2006 was hastily pulled, leading to speculation that Cruise’s lawyers had threatened Paramount (which owns the Comedy Central network that South Park broadcasts on) with the star’s refusal to take part in Mission: Impossible III promotions if the company did not intervene.43 In spite of his subsequent marriage to Katie Holmes, whom he later divorced, and 28\n\nP1: proof IBBK116-01\n\nTrim: 156mm × 234mm Top: 36pt Gutter: 50pt Visual Culture Royal 234 × 156 August 11, 2015 12:0\n\nTom Cruise as Actor Top Gun, central to the crystallisation of Cruise’s persona and his launch as a film star, was followed the same year by The Color of Money (Martin Scorsese, 1986). While continuing Cruise’s drive to work with talented filmmakers, it also indicated his wish to develop his acting expertise, a point discussed by Marshall.44 In addition to working with director Martin Scorsese, Cruise played opposite veteran star Paul Newman. The casting of Newman is a reminder of his 1961 role in The Hustler (Robert Rossen) as an over-confident young pool player, not unlike Cruise’s character Vince, if more anguished and brutalised in a darker story. By this time, a pattern in Cruise’s acting choices had developed: an apparent split between roles that were likely to be financially successful and those that allowed him to work with a major director (and often a respected senior star, such as Newman). Sometimes these overlapped: prestige films such as The Color of Money and Rain Man did well at the American box office. In such films Cruise’s star image appears to take second place to the artistic demands of the directors, a privileging of his technical performance over a straightforward reiteration of his persona. Cruise’s desire to work with notable directors is a tacit acknowledgement that he seeks recognition for his acting ability, invoking tension between ‘impersonation’ and ‘personification’ described by Barry King.45 This split in the end is artificial, as certain directors with an understanding of the persona have exploited it for their own artistic ends. Thus Spielberg’s use of the persona in Minority Report and Kubrick’s in Eyes Wide Shut do not play against the existing image but develop it in particular ways for their respective projects. Nevertheless, there remains an opposition in the typical star’s career between his status as star and as artist. P. David Marshall investigates this tension using deCordova’s history of the Hollywood star system to delineate the development of Tom Cruise’s career. DeCordova argues that the field of knowledge pertaining to the early ‘picture personality’ is limited to the intertextuality of their filmography and prior acting experience. The evolution to the category of star occurs at the point where interest is generated in the actor’s life offscreen and the apparent relationship between it and their screen roles. Marshall traces this development from Cruise’s early performances as portrayals of ‘youth’, to the development of a recognisable picture personality in Risky Business. It is Top Gun that secures his status as star. Discussing the development of Cruise’s acting skills, Marshall invokes deCordova’s historical paradigm to compare the social transgressions of the film stars of the 1920s – such as their decadent lifestyles – to the professional transgressions of his early screen personality in choosing roles against type. According to Marshall, this has enabled Cruise to project a subjectivity independent\n\nTHE TOM CRUISE PERSONA\n\nthe birth of his first biological child (he adopted two children with Nicole Kidman), Cruise’s rumoured homosexuality continues to inflect his star persona.\n\n29\n\nTOM CRUISE\n\nP1: proof IBBK116-01\n\n30\n\nTrim: 156mm × 234mm Top: 36pt Gutter: 50pt Visual Culture Royal 234 × 156 August 11, 2015 12:0\n\nof his screen roles, which is crucial in establishing his stardom as a ‘distinct cultural commodity that is transferable to other domains’.46 Marshall cites the first instance of this transgression taking place in The Color of Money. Although Cruise’s character exhibits elements of narcissism and exhibitionism in keeping with his persona, it is given new depth by the respective contributions of Scorsese and Newman. It is not clear that Cruise’s prestige films exploit his persona any less than films designed as star vehicles: Rain Man makes apt use of Cruise’s screen image, in spite of its ‘quality’ credentials. Yet Marshall notes that in Rain Man the presence of Hoffman, well known for his method acting, enabled Cruise to shift his image to that of a serious actor who can attract distinguished actors and directors such as Barry Levinson to a project.47 In short, ‘Cruise now becomes a moniker that has a certain guarantee of quality, a brand-name status that not only includes his promise of alluring filmic masculinity, but is also symbolic of serious and quality films’.48 Rain Man became a surprise hit – it was the number one American film of the year (and won Hoffman his second Academy Award). However much Cruise may be emphasising his skill as an actor, his persona resonates powerfully in his role as Charlie Babbitt and the character’s relation to his late father, a punishing figure who continues to assert his control beyond the grave. Charlie is a luxury car salesman, dishonest, manipulative and superficial. Here, Cruise captures the worst excesses of 1980s American capitalism in its drive to sell and consume at all costs. A study of the star leads inevitably to a better understanding of this epoch in US culture: Cruise reflects back the culture that produced him, while simultaneously critiquing its worth. Fitting, then, that his concern with appearances – literally demonstrated in the first shot of him, in which his face appears reflected in the shiny hood of a Ferrari – is ultimately a concern to appear masculine. His narcissistic posturing is shored up by his sunglasses, recalling their use as a stylish prop in earlier roles. In early scenes they flag his privileging of style over substance, a typical response for a man who earns his living selling sports cars. However, by the film’s end he uses the sunglasses to hide his pain as he bids his autistic brother Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) goodbye. Raymond, who feels no emotion at their separation, is called back by a panicked Charlie to say goodbye. As Raymond finally shuffles off, Charlie’s face reveals his distress at the separation. A moment later, the Ray-Ban Wayfarers are donned as he steps back into a wide shot, looking on as the train pulls out of the station. The gesture signals a closing down of the emotional vulnerability and desire for a relationship with the father that Charlie’s reunion with his older brother Raymond has exposed. "
