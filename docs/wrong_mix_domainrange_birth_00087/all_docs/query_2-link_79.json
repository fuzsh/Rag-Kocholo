        "text": "The specificity of Tom Cruise’s personality can be summed up by his nostalgic yearning for his roots – a “paradise lost” which is also a source of energy and vitality. His power is linked to memory. He inhabits a present which draws sustenance from the past, from continuity and timelessness. The power of memory can either be dynamic or static. The consciousness of an inaccessible past can either immobilize him in melancholy and nostalgia, or shine as an ideal which motivates him to recreate a new harmony. His attitude and approach to the past are of key importance. If he thinks of it as a refuge, his obsession with it may be such that his progress is impeded. If, on the contrary, he thinks of it as a starting point or launching pad for his comprehension of the human condition, he will integrate it into his self-realization process. He possesses a potential for great maturation and wisdom.\n\nTom Cruise is relatively slow-moving and may feel protected from the outer world by an armor of education, family surroundings (his most cherished environment), and social status. For this reason, he tends to limit the scope of his activities to a single well-defined sphere, and, within the boundaries he has established, release the entire spectrum of his rich and varied emotional expression. Sometimes he may feel overwhelmed by the prospect of situations which will introduce him to unfamiliar factors and elements; he sees them as intrusions. Before he judges an event, a person, or a thing, he attempts to absorb it into his private universe. Of a fairly subjective and introverted turn of mind, he defines everything in terms of the sensation it arouses in him as his consciousness embraces it. This predominance of sensation gives his extreme sensory finesse. His perceptions are intense, keen, penetrating right to the heart of people and things. His imagination, which is a function of his perceptions, is also lively, colorful, and prolific.\n\nBecause he is sometimes self-centered, attentive to and protective of his inner self, he may tend to withdraw into his shell when he encounters aggression from the outer world. As a result, he may sometimes become distant and secretive. His tendency to be rather short-tempered and easily offended, a classic flaw, is also the consequence of his need for protection and security. Despite his sensitivity, and his ability to be genuinely virtuous, he is not always gentle. His outbreaks of hostility are all the more wounding because of their rarity. However, more than aggressiveness, his stubbornness, slow insistence, and undying determination are the extremes which may complicate his life.\n\nOnce again, the family setting is vitally important to him. His attachment to his family in general and his mother or a mother figure, in particular, is deep. The way he resolves (or has resolved) the transition to adulthood and independence will be crucial to his well-being, both in terms of his inner harmony (the sensation and sensitivity which comprise his identity) and in terms of his romantic relationships.\n\nTom Cruise tends to place his emotions in the forefront. He is sensitive and sometimes vulnerable to influences from the outer world.\n\nTom Cruise is attracted by the here-and-now, by study, and writing. Tom Cruise has a special affinity for the people around him: siblings (or close friends), neighbors, etc.\n\nAt the time of Tom Cruise’s birth, his rising sign was located in Sagittarius (the Archer), while the sun was passing through the sign of Cancer (the Crab). A summary of the various clues mentioned above provide his personality profile. The following key words capture the essence of his character and indicate certain contradictions which may be sources of tension:\n\nImpetuosity – Sensitivity – Enthusiasm – Imagination – Group spirit – Eccentricity – Impressionability – Savings and thrift – Analytical mind – Worldly concerns – Obstinacy – Projection – Premonition.\n\nTorn between his desire for independence and freedom and an undeniable need for security, Tom Cruise could have trouble finding an inner balance in the early part of his life. He is attracted by novelty and change and tempted by travel and exploration but also loyal to a small circle of interests and friends.\n\nTom Cruise is sometimes daring, sometimes cautious.\n\nAs an adult, Tom Cruise will probably achieve security and self-confidence when he creates his own home. At that point, all of his considerable resources will blossom: his mind will be open to intuitive intelligence emanating from his unconscious, and his fertile imagination will become a source of joy and creativity.\n\nBorn in the three days after the rising of the new moon, Tom Cruise is said to be a “new moon” lunar type. This “soli-lunar” configuration gives him a subjective character, somewhat impulsive and sometimes emotive. Generally, Tom Cruise does not see the world in objective terms; instead, he bases his attitude on the feelings various situations arouse inside him.\n\nLikewise, in human relationships, Tom Cruise tends to project his imaginary reality onto others instead of seeing them for what they are. As a result, his judgements and reasoning are sometimes deprived of perspective.\n\nTom Cruise may want to make an effort to refrain from overinterpreting other people’s actions, because, being the product of his imagination in most cases, his interpretations are mistaken. If Tom Cruise applies himself to listening more openly, people may reveal their deeper motivations. Tom Cruise will be happier and more effective as a result.\n\nTom Cruise’s sun is located at 11° CANCER. His drive for psycho-sexual fulfillment would best be aroused by a person whose Moon is at 5/17° CANCER or CAPRICORN.\n\nThis relationship could yield a high degree of psychological compatibility and powerful mutual attraction. The physical and psychological reality of Tom Cruise’s personality will exert a magnetic pull over the sensitivity, receptivity, tenderness, and other key qualities of his partner.\n\nTom Cruise’s moon is located at 4° LEO. His ideal match is a partner with the sun at 0/10° LEO or AQUARIUS.\n\nTom Cruise would be particularly well-matched to someone who mirrors his underlying psychic and unconscious aspirations. The secret ideal he cherishes of the perfect partner would be aroused; it would harmonize beautifully with his ideal imaginary lover. This great psychic compatibility is the result of a harmonious relationship between the Moon of the masculine chart and the sun of the feminine one. It is propitious to a rich flow of energies between the most hidden and secret parts of both people. They are linked by an unconscious emotional bond.\n\nTom’s Venus is located at 19° LEO. Tom’s ideal match is a partner with Mars at 13/25° LEO or AQUARIUS.\n\nThis type of partner would complement Tom Cruise perfectly in emotional and sentimental terms. This person would reflect and fulfill Tom Cruise’s ideal of sensuality to the greatest degree. Moreover, Tom Cruise’s ideal partner would resonate lastingly with Tom Cruise’s own psychic projections of his ideal. This positive relationship between the unconscious sexual yearnings of both partners would be likely to yield sensual relations of a tantalizingly mysterious and secret nature.\n\nTom Cruise has lofty amorous ideals and only falls under the spell of brilliant, worldly, artistic types. He is especially proud and displeased by any sign of a lack of respect or loyalty. He would be especially wise to choose this type. This person is demonstrative, brilliant, warm, and generous. Although Tom Cruise’s type tends to be somewhat emphatic and dramatic, their frankness and righteousness make them irresistible to him.\n\nTom Cruise’s Planet Mars is located at 26° TAURUS. Tom Cruise’s ideal match is a partner with Venus at 20/30° TAURUS or SCORPIO."
