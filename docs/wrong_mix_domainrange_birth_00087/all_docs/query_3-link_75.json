        "text": "Hollywood film icon Tom Cruise came from humble beginnings, with a mother who worked multiple jobs to feed him and his three sisters. He would also massage his mom's feet after she worked tirelessly.\n\nAfter the star's mother left his abusive dad, moved him and his siblings to a new place, and met Cruise's stepdad, their lives changed.\n\nYears later, Cruise achieve great success as an actor, and he brought his mother to red-carpet events.\n\nFamous actor Tom Cruise, 61, best known for starring in the popular film franchises \"Mission: Impossible\" and \"Top Gun,\" was born on July 3, 1962, in Syracuse, New York, as the third youngest of four. Growing up, Cruise and his siblings moved around a lot to whichever location his father, Thomas Cruise Mapother III's job, would take them.\n\nOnce they set their sights on Canada and decided to settle there, Cruise's mother, Mary Lee Pfeiffer, found work with a local theater group and noticed her son develop a knack for the performing arts. According to her, as a toddler, Cruise would imitate famous cartoon characters Woody Woodpecker and Donald Duck and comedic actor W.C. Fields in skits he would create.\n\nHowever, his theatrical interest became short-lived once he got older and developed an interest in sports. Sports provided the actor an outlet whenever he got frustrated and a social space to make new friends. Given his dyslexia, Cruise never spent much time getting involved in classroom settings.\n\nDespite making the best of the little they had, Cruise's family went through a period of poverty when they lived in Ottawa, Canada. By the time Cruise was 14, his mother had divorced his abusive father and moved him and his three sisters to Louiseville in search of a better life for her family. According to the mother of four:\n\n\"You know, women have dreams of having careers and being whatever. I had a dream of raising children and enjoying them and having a good family life.\"\n\nMary Lee Pfeiffer and Tom Cruise at the 8th Annual American Cinema Awards in Beverly Hills, 1991 | Source: Getty Images\n\nTom Cruise's Mother Struggled to Make Ends Meet While Taking Care of Him and His Three Sisters\n\nOnce Cruise, along with his mother and siblings, packed into a car and moved to Louisville, the \"Jack Reacher\" star decided to drop his father's name following the divorce. Realizing that she had to raise four kids in a new one-income household, Pfeiffer took on many jobs, from selling appliances to hosting conventions for electronics to keep their heads above water.\n\nThe doting mother would even improvise on gifts when celebrating holidays such as Christmas. Instead of buying presents (which they had no money for), the family crafted poems for one another and read them aloud on the special day.\n\nAfter his parents agreed to his request, believing in his talents, the star on the rise skipped graduation.\n\nTom Cruise posing for a portrait in 1981 | Source: Getty Images\n\nIn an effort to help his mom out with the financial obligations she was facing, Cruise decided to get a paper delivery job. He would also massage his beloved mother's feet for 30 minutes every night when she returned from work. He did this for six weeks during the Lenten season.\n\nWhen speaking of his family life from his perspective, Cruise admitted to having a difficult time adjusting and being vulnerable with his peers after experiencing the childhood he had.\n\nHe discloses details about his personality at the time that did not allow himself to be as expressive, which was in combat with him wanting love and attention from people but feeling as though he never fit in anywhere. Thus, Cruise admitted that he was not particularly fond of school:\n\n\"I look back upon high school and grade school and I would never want to go back there. Not in a million years.\"\n\nTom Cruise posing in a black and white photo in 1980 | Source: Getty Images\n\nAs a result of grappling with unresolved feelings about his dad and family life, teachers described the dashing actor as mediocre and uncommunicative in his studies. This demeanor would show up, especially concerning his familial background.\n\nA classmate even reiterated the metaphorical wall Cruise would build when discussing the matter. John Kowalski stated that although his former schoolmate had a great personality, it appeared as though Cruise was running away from his past with his dad.\n\nTom Cruise and Mary Lee Pfeiffer at the 61st Annual Golden Globe Awards in Beverly Hills, 2004 | Source: Getty Images\n\nEventually, Cruise found solidarity and acceptance at St. Francis Seminary School in Cincinnati after being befriended by a kind priest. A close friend, Shane Dempler, who he met at Seminary School, divulged:\n\n\"He had a very strong Catholic faith. We went to Mass, spent time in the chapel and enjoyed hearing stories from the priests. We thought the priests had a great lifestyle and we were really interested in priesthood.\"\n\nLee Anne DeVette, Tom Cruise, and Mary Lee Pfeiffer at the 23rd Annual Museum of the Moving Image Black Tie Salute in New York City, 2007 | Source: Getty Images\n\nTom Cruise's Stepfather Changed His Life for the Better & He Went on to Become a Star in Hollywood\n\nAfter years of growing accustomed to their new life, Pfeiffer met a man named Jack South, who worked with plastics, at an electronics convention. By the time Cruise turned sixteen, Pfeiffer and South tied the knot. Initially, Cruise revealed he felt threatened by his stepdad due to his fierce love and protective spirit for his mom.\n\nHowever, after seeing how much South loved Pfeiffer and getting to know him as an intelligent man, Cruise and his stepfather developed a good relationship, and their lives changed for the better. When the family moved to Glen Ridge, New Jersey, Cruise, who had been in his senior year, still had a restless spirit.\n\nMary Lee Pfeiffer and Tom Cruise's stepdad, Jack South, at the \"Minority Report\" world premiere in New York City, 2002 | Source: Getty Images\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Cruise wanted to set some time aside to travel before thinking about college. Dealing with a hyperenergetic personality which saw him jump from sport to sport, Cruise found it challenging to focus on one thing and see it through to the end.\n\nHowever, one day, as per the counsel of his glee club teacher, Cruise auditioned for his high school's \"Guys and Dolls\" musical production and scored the leading role. Of the opening night, his proud mom recalled:\n\n\"I can't describe the feeling that was there. It was just an incredible experience to see what we felt was a lot of talent coming forth all of a sudden. It had been dormant for so many yearsânot thought of or talked about or discussed in any way.\"\n\nTom Cruise attending an event in the 1980s | Source: Getty Images\n\nFollowing the show's end, when the family got home, Cruise sat his mom and stepdad down for a serious discussion. The bold teenager asked them if he could spend ten years looking for work in show business.\n\nAfter his parents agreed to his request, believing in his talents, the star on the rise skipped graduation. He shortened his nameâdropping his father's last nameâand relocated to New York City.\n\nMary Lee Pfeiffer and Tom Cruise at the 62nd Annual Academy Awards in Los Angeles, 1990 | Source: Getty Images\n\nOnce he moved, he followed the same path many stars took to make a name for himself in the entertainment industry. While he attended auditions during the day, he worked busing tables at night.\n\nWhenever he had a free moment, he would also participate in workshops at the Neighborhood Playhouse. Once Cruise became an incredible success in Hollywood, he made red-carpet appearances with one of his biggest supporters: his doting mom, who would always dress in elegant and chic attire.\n\nFrom their appearance at the 1990 Golden Globes and Cruise's subsequent movie premieres to cheering at baseball games, the lookalike mother-son duo were always seen hand-in-hand at the special events. During the course of Pfeiffer's relationship with Cruise's stepdad, he would also accompany her and Cruise to red-carpet events, supporting Cruise's accolades and celebrated talents as an A-list entertainer.\n\nTom Cruise and Mary Lee Pfeiffer at the 66th Annual Golden Globe Awards in Hollywood, 2009 | Source: Getty Images\n\nCruise may have come from humble beginnings, but thanks to the love and support of his mother and family, in addition to his talents, he is now an iconic household name as an established A-list actor.\n\nncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jm1oaWtganq1u8xmmqutmaiybrnArKqan5WZeq67zKxkn52VqXqmwsSrsGegpKK5"
