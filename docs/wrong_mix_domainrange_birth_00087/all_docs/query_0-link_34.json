Born in Syracuse, New York on July 3rd, 1962, he developed a passion for acting at an early age. After graduating high school in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, he moved to New York City to pursue his dream of becoming an actor. Cruise's breakthrough role came in the romantic drama Risky Business which catapulted him into stardom. However, it was his role as Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell in the action-drama Top Gun that firmly established him as one of Hollywood's leading men. He has since starred in numerous blockbuster films such as Rain Man, A Few Good Men, the Mission: Impossible series and more. Beyond his acting prowess lies a complex individual with diverse interests and accomplishments. He is known for performing many of his own film stunts - a testament to his dedication to authenticity on screen. A staunch advocate for Scientology since the mid-1980s, Cruise also invests time promoting awareness about this religious belief system worldwide. Despite facing personal challenges including dyslexia and multiple divorces, Cruise continues to captivate audiences around the globe with his charismatic performances while maintaining resolute commitment towards both professional pursuits and personal convictions.\n\nOlivia Munn, born as Lisa Olivia Munn on July 3, 1980, is an American actress and former television host.
