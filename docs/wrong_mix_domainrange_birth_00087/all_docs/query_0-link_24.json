        "text": "Christopher Plummer (born December 13, 1929, Toronto, Ontario, Canada—died February 5, 2021, Weston, Connecticut, U.S.) was a Canadian actor known for his interpretations of classical roles on the stage as well as his starring and supporting roles in motion pictures.\n\nPlummer made his first professional appearance in 1950 in Ottawa and spent several years performing with Canadian repertory theatre groups. In 1954 he made his New York City debut and soon attracted wide critical praise. He joined the American Shakespeare Festival Company in Stratford, Connecticut, in 1955—quickly establishing a reputation as a leading Shakespearean actor and performing in repertory in Canada and England as well as the United States. His nonclassical roles included those in such plays as The Dark Is Light Enough (1955), The Lark (1955), Arturo Ui (1963), The Royal Hunt of the Sun (1965), and The Good Doctor (1973). In 1981 he returned to Shakespeare to play Iago, opposite James Earl Jones’s Othello. Plummer won Tony Awards for his roles in Cyrano (1974) and in Barrymore (1997). His performances in King Lear (2004) and Inherit the Wind (2007) were also favourably received.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nPlummer’s first motion picture was Stage Struck (1956), but he is probably best known for playing Captain Von Trapp in The Sound of Music (1965) opposite Julie Andrews. He followed that role with performances as a squadron leader in the World War II film Battle of Britain (1969); as the author Rudyard Kipling in The Man Who Would Be King (1975); and as a bank vice president in the television miniseries Arthur Hailey’s the Moneychangers (1976), for which he won an Emmy Award. Plummer starred in the thriller The Silent Partner (1978) and in the Sherlock Holmes mystery Murder by Decree (1980). In the 1980s he had starring roles in Eyewitness (1981), Lily in Love (1984), and Shadow Dancing (1988).\n\nIn the 1990s and at the beginning of the 21st century, Plummer continued to take a wide variety of movie and television roles. In 1993 he won a second Emmy for his voice-over performance in the children’s television series Madeline (1993–95). He earned critical acclaim for his portrayal of journalist Mike Wallace in The Insider, which also starred Al Pacino and Russell Crowe (1999), and in 2001 he appeared with Crowe in the award-winning A Beautiful Mind. Plummer’s subsequent films included the romantic comedy Must Love Dogs (2005); Syriana (2005), a drama about the oil industry that also featured George Clooney and Matt Damon; and Spike Lee’s Inside Man (2006), which centred on a well-planned bank robbery.\n\nPlummer received his first Academy Award nomination for his supporting role as Leo Tolstoy in the historical drama The Last Station (2009). In 2009 he also played the title role in the Faustian fantasy The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus. In Beginners (2010) Plummer portrayed a cancer-stricken widower who reveals to his son that he is gay; the performance earned him both an Oscar and a Golden Globe Award for best supporting actor in 2012.\n\nPlummer later appeared as the wealthy uncle of a murder victim in a 2011 film adaptation of Stieg Larsson’s crime novel The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and as John Marshall Harlan, a member of the Supreme Court when it overturned Muhammad Ali’s draft-dodging conviction, in the HBO TV movie Muhammad Ali’s Greatest Fight (2013). He then played a quirky scientist attempting to discern the particularities of what makes people happy in Hector and the Search for Happiness (2014) and the manager of a dissipated rock star in the midst of an inconvenient epiphany in Danny Collins (2015).\n\nPlummer later took on the roles of famous figures Kaiser Wilhelm II in The Exception (2016) and the fictional Ebenezer Scrooge in The Man Who Invented Christmas (2017). He then was cast as J. Paul Getty in Ridley Scott’s All the Money in the World (2017); Plummer was a last-minute replacement for Kevin Spacey, who had already filmed his scenes but was dropped from the production amid accusations of sexual harassment. For his work in the film, Plummer received his third Oscar nomination. His movie credits from 2018 included Boundaries, in which he played an aging pot dealer on a road trip with his daughter and grandson. He later starred as a mystery writer who is murdered in Knives Out (2019), a comedic take on the whodunit.\n\nPlummer also lent his voice to a number of animated films, including Up (2009), My Dog Tulip (2009), Howard Lovecraft and the Frozen Kingdom (2016), and The Star (2017)."
