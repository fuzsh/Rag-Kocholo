Hollywood A-listers Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz are in town and they head out onto the test track as the Stars in a Reasonably Priced Car. Plus, Richard Hammond is in Sweden for a race against some hardcore snowmobilers and James May attempts to break his personal speed record in a brand new, even more powerful version of the amazing Bugatti Veyron."
