        "text": "Double take.\n\nSuri Cruise, the 17-year-old daughter of Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise, was photographed looking just like her famous mother as she bundled up on a walk in New York City Sunday.\n\nShe kept it casual for the midday stroll, wearing gray sweatpants, a T-shirt, a navy blue jacket and brown flats.\n\nSuri went makeup-free for the outing as she tied her hair up in a ponytail and accessorized with drop earrings.\n\nIt’s unclear where the teenager was off to, but she held on to a pink water bottle as wired headphones hung out of her pocket.\n\nThe brunette beauty is occasionally seen wandering around the Big Apple, often out on errands.\n\nSuri was last spotted with Holmes, 45, last month as the mother-daughter duo walked through Soho with big smiles on their faces.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nA few months before, the two made another rare appearance together as they celebrated the “Dawson’s Creek” alum’s 45th birthday in the city.\n\nIn 2019, the “Batman Begins” actress gushed over her mini-me in an interview with Shape magazine, revealing they like to work out together.\n\n“I feel very blessed to have such a special daughter. Being her mom is absolutely the greatest gift and privilege,” she told the outlet. “Sometimes I work out with my daughter. It just depends on the day.”\n\nLast year, Holmes also shared she’s always been protective of her daughter “because she was so visible at a young age” due to her and Cruise’s fame, per Glamour.\n\nHowever, Suri is rumored not to hold the same bond with her father amid reports she’s been estranged from the “Top Gun” actor, 61, since his 2012 divorce from Holmes.\n\nThe “First Daughter” star and Cruise welcomed their daughter in April 2006 and wed a few months after her birth.\n\nThe last person the actress was romantically connected to was musician in Bobby Wooten III from April 2022 until December 2022."
