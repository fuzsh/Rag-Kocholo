        "text": "Hollywood megastar Tom Cruise may be best known for his roles in Mission Impossible but away from movie sets, he was once a doting dad.\n\nBut while his children may be grown up, it recently emerged that the 60-year-old is estranged from his youngest child, Suri, who recently applied for college.\n\nNew York born Tom has three children, two from his marriage with Nicole Kidman and one from his second marriage to Katie Holmes.\n\nThe Mirror have trawled through the archives to bring you the latest on Tom's children and what they're up to nowadays â€“ although one revelation is very unexpected.\n\nIsabella 'Bella' Cruise\n\nWhile Bella may have been born in Florida before being adopted by Kidman and Cruise and went on to grow up in America, her life is very different.\n\nThe 30-year-old swapped the scorching temperature of the States and instead opted to live a much more low-key life in Croydon, south London.\n\nNowadays, the artist lives a much more low-key lifestyle with her IT consultant husband Max Parker.\n\nBut while her brother and parents may be in the movie industry, Bella opted for a more relaxed career choice and became an artist.\n\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, she branched out and launched her own fashion collection, taking inspiration from Aussie-born Nicole as well as the infamous Tiger King and the pandemic.\n\nFollowing the breakdown of her parent's marriage, Bella continued with her strict Scientology upbringing and even trained as a Scientology \"auditor\".\n\nThe role is similar to that of a counsellor and helps people get rid of their \"spiritual distress\" using an \"E-meter\" to deliver low-voltage electricity to the individual.\n\nIn an email sent to other Scientologists in London, Bella said: \"This is what I had been searching for, the missing piece, thank you to my dad for everything.\"\n\nBella tied the knot in a ceremony which incorporated Scientology and Christianity in London back in 2015 and the guest list was so exclusive her own parents didn't attend.\n\nAt the time, Nicole had been in London rehearsing for the West End theatre production of Photograph 51 but was \"banned\" over fears that her attendance would cause a \"media circus\".\n\nA source said: \"Tom picked up the bill and paid for everything, but it was decided that neither he nor Nicole should attend as it would have turned the whole event into a circus.\n\n\"Nicole was actually involved with the wedding preparations and she did have a private dinner with Bella and Max. But she didn't go to the ceremony. Also, the animosity between Tom and Nicole was probably a factor.\"\n\nHer brother Connor also avoided the ceremony in order to keep it as low-key as possible before they headed to a reception at the Dorchester hotel in Mayfair.\n\nConnor Cruise\n\nConnor, 28, is Tom's son from his marriage to Nicole, with the couple adopting him in 1995 shortly after he was born.\n\nHe was born in Florida but while he opts to remain out of the spotlight, Connor attempted to carve out a career following in the footsteps of his famous parents.\n\nIn 2008 he took on the role of Young Ben in the movie Seven Pounds, before going on to appear as Daryl Jenkins in the 2012 film, Red Dawn alongside the likes of Chris Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson.\n\nNowadays, Connor can be seen sharing updates about his life on social media, regularly sharing photos and videos taken on fishing trips, as well as sharing delicious recipe ideas including Wagyu steak and Briskets.\n\nIt is not clear whether Connor remained a Scientologist after growing up.\n\nSuri Cruise\n\nTom's youngest child, Suri, comes from his second marriage to The Ice Storm actress Katie Holmes.\n\nBut despite the actor vowing to pay for any of Suri expenses until she turns 18, the pair do not have a relationship according to reports.\n\nTom and Katie welcomed Suri in 2006 and the 16-year-old is said to be in the process of applying for college and is not receiving assistance from her dad.\n\nInstead, mom Katie, 44, is throwing her support behind Suri with sources claiming she is eyeing up studying fashion at Fordham University in The Bronx, New York.\n\nBut while Katie is heavily involved in the process and wants her daughter to remain close to her in the city, Tom is said to be a complete stranger.\n\nThe actor has reportedly been estranged from Suri since he and Katie divorced in 2013.\n\nA source told the Daily Mail: \"Suri does not know her father anymore and she has not spent time with him in a decade. She does not go to see his movies and he has no part in her life.\"\n\nBut during their divorce, Tom agreed to pay Katie $400,000 each month until their daughter turns 18, as well as covering \"medical, dental, insurance, education, college and other extracurricular costs\".\n\nFollowing the breakdown of their marriage, it was reported that Katie had chosen to call it a day over fears about raising her daughter as a Scientologist.\n\nKatie's decision to leave the religion and the marriage caused a rift between the former couple, which has seen Tom and Suri become estranged."
