Studios on January 30, 2019 in Burbank, California.\n\nTom Cruise: 11 wild facts about the Syracuse-born actor\n\nHappy birthday, Tom Cruise!\n\nThe famous actor was born Thomas Cruise Mapother IV in Syracuse, N.Y. on July 3, 1962, just one day shy of being \"Born on the Fourth of July.\" He and three sisters were born to Thomas Mapother III, an electrical engineer who died in 1984, and Mary Lee Pfeiffer, a special education teacher who died in 2017.\n\nThe Mapother (rhymes with \"may bother\") family didn't stay in Central New York long, moving around a lot when Cruise was a child. His parents divorced in 1975, and he stayed with his mother and sisters, living in places like Ottawa and Cincinnati before eventually graduating high school in Glen Ridge, New Jersey.\n\nCruise made his acting debut in 1981 with \"Endless Love\" and \"Taps,\" eventually becoming one of the biggest movie stars of all time, bringing in more than $10 billion at the global box office. Nominated for three Oscars, his credits include \"Mission: Impossible,\" \"Top Gun,\" \"Jerry Maguire,\" \"Minority Report,\" \"Rain Man\" and \"Jack Reacher.\" He was also named People's \"Sexiest Man Alive\" in 1990 and remains popular in celebrity magazines, thanks to his many high-profile relationships and controversial religious beliefs.\n\nBut how much more do you really know? Here are 10 wild facts about the man who's played everyone from Frank \"T.J.\" Mackey and Cole Trickle to Joel Goodsen and Les Grossman:\n\n1. Tom Cruise nearly became a Catholic priest.\n\nCruise is said to have been baptized Catholic at St. Joseph the Worker Church in Liverpool, N.Y., and originally planned to become a priest before finding success as an actor. He attended a Franciscan seminary school at age 14 in Cincinnati, but a classmate says \"Tommy\" was asked to leave for stealing booze in 1976.\n\n(E! News reports Cruise later downplayed the idea that he chose the school to pursue the priesthood. \"We didn't have the money back then, and I went for the education for a year, and it was free,\" he once said.)\n\nBut it's there that Cruise reportedly fell in love with acting at the school's drama club, 15 years before his big screen debut in \"Endless Love.\" Cruise later became a Scientologist after his first wife, Mimi Rodgers, introduced him to the religion that he once claimed helped cure him of his dyslexia.\n\nFrazer Harrison | Getty Images\n\nActor Tom Cruise and mother Mary Lee Mapother arrive at the 66th Annual Golden Globe Awards held at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on January 11, 2009 in Beverly Hills, California.\n\n2. Cruise's ancestors include Irish knights.\n\nThe actor received a certificate of Irish heritage from Ireland's government in 2013 after genealogists traced his family tree back 840 years to Anglo-Normans who invaded Ireland between 1169 and 1176. His ancestry reportedly includes barons, knights, rebels and \"hero landlord\" Patrick Russell Cruise. (Yes, \"Cruise\" is a real family name.)\n\nAmazingly, the actor has never played a knight (his name wasn't even Knight in \"Knight and Day\"), though he has played a current or former soldier in 8 different movies: \"Taps,\" \"Top Gun,\" \"Born on the Fourth of July,\" \"A Few Good Men,\" \"The Last Samurai,\" \"Valkyrie,\" \"Jack Reacher\" and \"Edge of Tomorrow.\"\n\n3. Did Cruise turn down Iron Man?\n\nCruise was long rumored to have turned down the superhero role that launched the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Iron Man. Cruise told ComicBook.com in 2018 that he was \"not close\" to actually playing Tony Stark, though. \"Not close, and I love Robert Downey Jr. I can't imagine anyone else in that role, and I think it's perfect for him,\" he said.\n\n4. He almost starred in \"The Matrix\" and \"Enemy of the State.\"\n\nIt's hard to imagine anyone but Keanu Reeves as \"the one,\" but IMDb reports Nicolas Cage, Leonardo DiCaprio and Cruise were all considered for the lead role of Neo in the Wachowskis' 1999 sci-fi film. A year before that, Cruise was supposed to star in \"Enemy of the State,\" but his scheduling conflicts with \"Eyes Wide Shut\" forced him out and the part eventually went to Will Smith.\n\n5. Cruise is nearly a foot shorter than the \"Jack Reacher\" character.\n\nCruise has played Jack Reacher in two movies based on the books by author Lee Child, despite the actor being 10 inches shorter than the character's description of 6'5\" and 220-plus pounds.\n\n\"I completely agree that he, you know, doesn't look like Reacher in the book, so he knows that, too,\" Child told syracuse.com. \"And I completely understand readers who are passionately involved with this series of books are very, very suspicious about it and about the translation to the screen. I understand that and in fact I take it as a huge compliment that people care so much.\"\n\n\"But the issue was, if not Tom Cruise, who else? It wasn't like we were walking past a mass rank of giant actors in order to choose Tom Cruise. You know, there aren't any giant actors. It seems to be a fact of life that all actors are pretty compact human beings. And so there's nobody, really, who would've done it better, so we decided to forget about the external physicality of Jack Reacher and instead try to capture the internals, the intangibles. And I think Cruise -- because whatever else Cruise is in terms of a superstar and celebrity and all that kind of stuff, he is also technically a very fine actor -- and so he was able to capture the inside of Reacher perfectly, I thought.\"\n\n6. Cruise almost became paralyzed for \"Born on the Fourth of July\"\n\nE! News reports Andrew Morton's 2008 Tom Cruise biography detailed how director Oliver Stone wanted the actor to be injected with a chemical to make him temporarily paralyzed to play real-life Vietnam War veteran and activist Ron Kovic in \"Born on the Fourth of July.\" The insurance company shut down the risky idea (for obvious reasons), but Cruise still went on to win a Golden Globe for his acting performance and Stone won an Academy Award for best director.\n\n7. Cruise's ex-wives are all 11 years apart in age.\n\nMimi Rogers was born in 1956, Nicole Kidman was born in 1967 and Katie Holmes was born in 1978. Cruise has been previously romantically linked with everyone from Rebecca De Mornay and Cher to his \"Vanilla Sky\" co-star Penelope Cruz, but is reportedly single now (until he meets the right lady who was born in 1989). He has two adopted children with Kidman -- Isabella and Connor -- and a 13-year-old daughter, Suri, with Holmes.\n\nSide note: Have you ever noticed Suri Cruise sounds like \"Syracuse?\"\n\nPatrick Riviere | Getty Images\n\nNicole Kidman and Tom Cruise are pictured in Sydney, Australia, in 1993.\n\n8. Cruise almost played Spider-Man.\n\nCruise was also almost in the recent Oscar-winning animated film \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.\" Filmmakers Rodney Rothman, Bob Persichetti and Pete Ramsey explained on the Digital and DVD releases that they originally planned to create a movie within the movie, directed by James Cameron and starring Cruise as Spidey, as a nod to past film versions of the web-slinging superhero that never happened. Cameron previously wrote a 47-page script/treatment for a film version of \"Spider-Man\" in the '90s before Sam Raimi took over the franchise (with Tobey Maguire in the Peter Parker role), and Cruise was once in line to play Spider-Man in the '80s (for a movie that never happened), so it would've been a super-geeky easter egg for longtime fans of the character.\n\nGetty Images; Video still\n\n9. Cruise sends Dakota Fanning a birthday gift every year.\n\nAccording to E! News, Cruise has sent a birthday gift to actress Dakota Fanning every year since he played her father in 2005's \"War of the Worlds.\" \"I haven't seen him in awhile, but he has sent me a birthday gift every year since I was 11 years old,\" she told \"Watch What Happens Live\" in 2016. \"Beautiful gifts, it's really kind. I always think, 'Oh, when I'm 18, he'll probably stop. Oh, 21, he'll stop. But every year... It's usually shoes.\"\n\n10. Aladdin modeled after Tom Cruise?\n\nDisney recently released a live-action remake of \"Aladdin,\" starring Will Smith as the blue Genie, but the 1992 animated film's hero actually resembled Tom Cruise -- on purpose. \"There's a confidence with all of his attitudes and his poses,\" lead animator Glen Keane said in a DVD extras interview.\n\n11. He really does his own stunts.\n\nThat's really Cruise dangling 1,700 feet off the ground in Dubai, climbing the 123-story Burj Khalifa to get to a computer server in 2011's \"Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol.\" And hanging off the side of a plane in mid-air for 2015's \"Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,\" reaching heights of 5,000 feet. And riding motorcycles for chase scenes in \"Knight and Day\" and \"Mission: Impossible - Fallout.\" And tumbling around in zero gravity for a plane crash in 2017's \"The Mummy.\" And free-climbing in 2000's \"Mission: Impossible II.\" And... you get the idea.\n\nPart of it is his dedication to intense training, such as learning how to hold his breath for over six minutes underwater in \"Rogue Nation,\" swordfighting in \"The Last Samurai\" and even playing pool 12 hours a day for a role in \"The Color of Money.\" Part of it is about entertaining the audiences at any cost, including his own health -- he broke an ankle filming a stunt for \"Mission: Impossible 6,\" threw out his back making Ridley Scott's \"Legend\" in 1985, and tore his labrum while scaling a cliff for Mission: Impossible II.\"\n\nUpcoming movies\n\nAt 57 years old, Cruise is still going strong as an action star. His upcoming movies include a \"Top Gun\" sequel (\"Top Gun: Maverick\") in 2020 and two more \"Mission: Impossible\" films in 2021 and 2022."
