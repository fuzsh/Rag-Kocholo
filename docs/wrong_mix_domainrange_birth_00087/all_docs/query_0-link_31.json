        "text": "Entertainment attorney Matt Galsor, partner in Century City-based firm Greenberg Glusker Fields Claman & Machtinger, spoke no English when he arrived in Los Angeles from Ukraine with his family in 1992 following decades living among the many Soviet Jewish refuseniks denied the right to emigrate to Israel, the United States and other countries beginning in the 1970s.\n\nThey came to Los Angeles to join other family members, not because it was the heart of Hollywood. Galsor learned English, went on to get his B.A. at UCLA and attended Columbia in New York. He wasn’t thinking about the entertainment biz when he decided to return to L.A."
