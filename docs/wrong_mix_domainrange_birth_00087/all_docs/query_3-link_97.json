        "text": "For having two A-list parents, not much is known about Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman’s two adopted kids.\n\nThe former couple, who were married for nearly 11 years until 2001, adopted Isabella, now 30, in 1992, and her brother Connor, 28, in 1995.\n\nThe “Big Little Lies” actress, 56, has been open about the fertility issues she and the “Top Gun” star, 61, experienced during their marriage, as Kidman suffered two miscarriages.\n\n“I had a miscarriage at the end of my marriage, but I had an ectopic pregnancy at the beginning of my marriage. It was incredibly traumatic for me,” she first revealed to Marie Claire in 2007.\n\nKidman went on to marry country star Keith Urban in 2006, and the pair welcomed their first daughter, Sunday, 14, in 2008.\n\nThey had another daughter, Faith, 12, via surrogate in 2010.\n\nCruise then welcomed a daughter, Suri, 17, with actress Katie Holmes in April 2006, and they wed that November.\n\nThe couple divorced in 2012.\n\nEven though Bella and Connor are now adults, their famous parents have stayed quite hush about the kids who made them parents for the first time. So much so, that Bella and Connor’s rare appearances often garner attention.\n\n2015\n\nCruise greeted fans as he attended the NCAA Women’s Final Four semifinal in Tampa, Florida, with Connor. They watched the University of Connecticut Huskies take on the University of Maryland Terrapins — and were even featured on the leaderboard at one point.\n\n2016\n\nBella Kidman Cruise, a graphic designer, shut down rumors that she did not have a relationship with her famous parents in 2016.\n\n“Of course we talk, they’re my parents,” she told New Idea, adding that anyone who suggested otherwise is “full of s – – t.”\n\nThat same year, Kidman made a rare comment about growing her family so early in life.\n\n“I had a miscarriage at the end of my marriage, but I had an ectopic pregnancy at the beginning of my marriage. It was incredibly traumatic for me,” she told Red magazine.\n\n“I was so young when I got married. I look back now and I’m like, ‘What?’ You look at Taylor Swift, I mean how old is she? She’s 26,” she said, randomly referencing the “Shake It Off” singer.\n\n“I had two kids by the time I was 27, and I’d been married for four years. But that’s what I wanted.”\n\nKidman concluded: “[Motherhood] is about the journey. There are going to be incredible peaks and valleys, whether you are an adopting mother or a birth mother. What a child needs is love.”\n\n2018\n\nKidman spoke about Bella and Connor’s decisions to follow Cruise into Scientology in a candid interview with Who magazine in November 2018.\n\n“I’m very private about all that,” the actress said about discussing her kin. “I have to protect all those relationships. I know 150% that I would give up my life for my children because it’s what my purpose is.”\n\nShe also reminded fans that they are now “adults” and able to guide their own lives, with her support.\n\n“They are able to make their own decisions. They have made choices to be Scientologists and, as a mother, it’s my job to love them,” she said.\n\n“And I am an example of that tolerance and that’s what I believe – that no matter what your child does, the child has love and the child has to know there is available love, and I’m open here.”\n\nShe continued: “I think that’s so important because if that is taken away from a child, to sever that in any child, in any relationship, in any family – I believe it’s wrong. So that’s our job as a parent, to always offer unconditional love.”\n\n2023\n\nConnor gave a glimpse of himself when he stepped out to play golf in May.\n\nTwo months later, Connor supported his dad in a rare public sighting in New York City in July at a promotional event for Tom’s blockbuster film “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning.”\n\nThe father-son duo weren’t photographed together, but Connor was joined by the actor’s sister, Lee Mapother.\n\nConnor lives a seemingly normal life as seen on his Instagram.\n\nHowever, any glimpses of his parents there are nowhere to be found.\n\n2023\n\nBella posted a rare selfie via Instagram on Sept. 17. “What a summer,” she wrote.\n\nBella, an artist, normally shares images of work with her nearly 52,000 followers."
