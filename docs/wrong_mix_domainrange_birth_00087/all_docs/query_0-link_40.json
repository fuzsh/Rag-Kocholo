        "text": "Tom Cruise is an American actor and one of the highest-grossing box-office stars of all time. He has received various accolades, including an Honorary Palme d'Or and three Golden Globe Awards, in addition to nominations for four Academy Awards\n\nCruise began acting in the early 1980s and made his breakthrough with leading roles in the comedy film Risky Business and action film Top Gun in 1986. Critical acclaim came with his roles in the dramas The Color of Money, Rain Man, and Born on the Fourth of July. For his portrayal of Ron Kovic in the latter, he won a Golden Globe Award and received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. As a leading Hollywood star in the 1990s, he starred in several commercially successful films, including the drama A Few Good Men, the thriller The Firm, the horror film Interview with the Vampire, and the romance Jerry Maguire, for which he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor and received his second Academy Award nomination. Cruise's performance as a motivational speaker in the drama Magnolia earned him another Golden Globe Award and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nSince then, Cruise has largely starred in science fiction and action films, establishing himself as an action star by often performing his own risky stunts. He has played Ethan Hunt in the Mission: Impossible film series since 1996. His other notable roles in the genre include Vanilla Sky, Minority Report, The Last Samurai, Collateral, War of the Worlds, Knight and Day, Jack Reacher, Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, and Top Gun: Maverick in 2022."
