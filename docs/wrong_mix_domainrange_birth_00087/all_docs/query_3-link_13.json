        "text": "Five Things That Kind of (Maybe a Little) Connect Tom Cruise to Kentucky\n\nThomas Cruise Mapother IV was born on July 3, 1962, in Syracuse, NY. But, anybody who's lived in Kentucky any time knows that, before he became the superstar actor Tom Cruise, he spent some time around here. There was a period in the '90s where it felt like every Louisville native I met had an older brother who'd attended high school with Tommy Mapother. In the spirit of exceptionally large classes at St. X and my general belief that I can put a Kentucky spin on just about anything, here are five factoids that connect Birthday Boy Tom Cruise to Kentucky.\n\nThe same model of U.S. Navy \"Tomcat\" fighter plane that Cruise's character Maverick flew in Top Gun is on display at the Aviation Museum of Kentucky, located beside the airport. So, the next time you're catching a cheap flight out of the LEX, you can take a photo of that plane, sing the chorus of \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling\" and pour a little out for Goose before you board. Everybody knows you don't need to be early for a flight out of Lexington, and you're basically commemorating a seminal piece of Kentucky history.\n\nEven if it was only for a brief time, Tom Cruise attended Louisville's St. Xavier High School. If you've lived in Louisville (or even visited for more than 5 minutes), you know that going to St. X is The Most Louisville Thing Ever. There you go: Tom's a Louivillian.\n\nTom's grandfather, Thomas Cruise Mapother Jr, founded the Louisville bankruptcy law firm Mapother & Mapother. So, if you went to law school and hated studying the bankruptcy code, or even if you've ever gotten a collection letter from Mapother, you're basically a cousin to Tom, right?\n\nSpeaking of cousins, Tom's cousin and Mission Impossible 2 co-star William Mapother is also an actor, and a full-on Louisville native.\n\nBefore matriculating at St. X, Tom also attended St. Francis Seminary in Cincinnati, a city which everyone knows is just an extension of the Northern Kentucky Metro Area.\n\nSo, there you go. Tom Cruise's Kentucky roots run deep.\n\nHappy birthday, Tom, you Crazy Kentuckian!!\n\n{Lest you doubt the veracity of these claims, please note that much of this article was influenced by Kentucky for Kentucky's blog post Tom Cruise Briefly Attended High School in Louisville,\" which, in turn, references \"multiple biographical sources gleaned from the Internet in a great haste.' Never let it be said that the HerKentucky girls don't do their research.}"
