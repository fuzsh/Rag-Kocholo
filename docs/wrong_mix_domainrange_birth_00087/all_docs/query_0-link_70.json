        "text": "I've been talking a lot about Toronto's congestion lately. It's not just a headache for commuters—it's becoming a huge drag on our economic fortunes. In my op-ed in today's Toronto Star, I shared my views into why this is such a fundamentally critical issue for the City. Two startling figures from Toronto Region Board of Trade’s poll with Ipsos is that fully 53 per cent of residents in the GTHA have considered moving outside the region to escape our now legendary gridlock. That number rose to an alarming 64 per cent among our city’s current and future prime workforce – those aged 18-34. From my office, I see the daily struggle on Queens Quay. A line-up of trucks crawling along meaning that service providers and time-sensitive deliveries miss their windows. It's frustrating for commuters, frustrating for customers and it's hurting our productivity to the tune of $11-billion annually. Something’s got to give. That’s why the Toronto Region Board of Trade Congestion Task Force is focused on developing realistic and actionable solutions to address the crisis. More to come! https://lnkd.in/gNNT5skD\n\nWith $260 million in additional funding for worker training through the Skills Development Fund, the Ontario government is demonstrating a strong and welcome commitment to addressing severe labour shortages in critical growth sectors like manufacturing, construction, energy and technology. Investing in skilled trades is vital for our region’s growth. Ontario needs more than 72,000 additional construction workers and numerous skilled tradespeople by 2027. The shift to EV platforms, battery plants and a resurgence in nuclear energy—all essential to Ontario’s economic prospects—will be shortchanged without a massive increase in skilled workers. Targeting high-demand areas will ensure we can build the homes and infrastructure our region needs. It will also help address rising living costs, ensuring economic growth and prosperity. It is vital that this new investment translates into tangible outcomes filling specific gaps in our labour market and supporting industries key to our region's growth and competitiveness.\n\nThis week, Canada’s premiers held their annual Council of the Federation summer meeting to support cooperation between provinces and territories. As a recent op-ed in the Globe and Mail by Heather Scoffield and Serge Dupont highlighted, an important way to address our country’s ongoing productivity challenges is through effective interprovincial collaboration. It’s become abundantly clear that we need a coordinated, strategic approach to fixing the productivity problem that has plagued our economy for decades. Toronto Region Board of Trade has been sounding the alarm bells on productivity – particularly in the Toronto region – for years. Canada’s GDP per capita has grown by just 0.4 per cent per year since 2006, while the Toronto region trails our peer city-regions in the US by a staggering $72,000 per worker. Nationwide, we’re not investing in new and updated infrastructure, machinery, and skills development at anywhere near the rate of our U.S. counterparts. Right now, there’s an opportunity for our premiers to work together on improving interprovincial coordination to boost economic competitiveness and productivity to enhance quality of life for all Canadians. But there’s more business can do to address this as well. Through the work of the Business Council of Toronto, we have a plan to drive change on the biggest areas of opportunity to propel our region’s productivity forward. We are convening leaders from across industry to pilot demonstration projects and drive advocacy to make the case for investments to build our productive capacity. Scoffield and Dupont are right when they say that the Council of the Federation should seek to stimulate investment and build a more productive economy. As a country, we all need to prioritize growing our economy and the wealth of our residents for the long-term. That’s even more important here in Toronto, which is the economic engine of our country; when we succeed, Canada succeeds. https://lnkd.in/gZEK3dei\n\nToday I joined Canadian business leaders in recommending Ontario join British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba in the New West Partnership Agreement on interprovincial trade. If Ontario were to join the agreement it would put the province in the internal trade fast-lane and make a significant impact on boosting our economy. Unlocking Toronto's potential requires greater trade with provinces across the country to streamline supply chains, enhance labour mobility, and foster innovation. The solutions are clear: regulatory harmonization, removing trade restrictions, and opening procurement markets. Ontario joining the New West Partnership would be an important step to make that happen. I'm glad to sign alongside colleagues including: Canadian Chamber of Commerce's The Hon Perrin Beatty, P.C., O.C., Business Council of Canada’s Goldy Hyder, Ontario Chamber of Commerce's Daniel Tisch, APR, FCPRS, ICD.D., Ottawa Board of Trade's Sueling Ching, Business Council of British Columbia's Laura Jones, Business Council of Alberta's Adam Legge, and Business Council of Manitoba's Bram Strain. https://lnkd.in/gtUz7GQB\n\nYesterday, the Toronto Region Board of Trade’s members had the opportunity to speak with Ontario’s Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, Paul Calandra, about how to accelerate his top priority of building 1.5 million homes by 2031...while also making sure we have enough space available for our growing population to work. Here's a well-kept secret: one of the GTHA's most precious assets—its manufacturing employment lands—are shrinking rapidly, limiting future growth. The Minister, engaging and forthright, said he is ready to explore ways to better protect employment lands, while continuing to enable zoning conversions for residential development where it makes sense. It's an important signal because industrial-zoned lands in the GTHA have been under relentless assault for decades, weakening the Province's capacity to grow high paying jobs, expand needed economic production, and generate the export revenues to pay for surging imports. The upshot: years of lost manufacturing investment in stark contrast to vigorous expansion in the US. This has left Ontario in the bottom tier of 64 North American states, provinces and territories when it comes to income per capita, a strong measure of relative prosperity. It's a high price to pay. Thankfully the Ford Government has made turning around the Province's manufacturing economy a cornerstone of its 6 years in office—winning big investments in automotive EVs, battery plants and components, steel, aerospace, and food processing. But the \"race for space\" in the GTHA continues to mean growing scarcity of employment lands (with a vacancy rate of 1%). This is sending land costs skyward compared to neighbouring U.S. states, adding to the challenge of winning new projects. Meanwhile the lack of certainty around whether existing employment lands will be preserved remains a big turn-off for business investment in new or modernized facilities. As it happens, the GTHA is still home to the majority of Ontario's manufacturing, supporting hundreds of thousands of well-paying jobs. But we need more, not less, which is where we're headed. It's time for a Provincial employment lands strategy with clear policy and regulatory guardrails to safeguard the Region's strategically important, high productivity employment zones. A big thanks to Minister Calandra for a hopeful discussion. We're looking forward to continuing the dialogue.\n\nCommuters have reached a breaking point when it comes to congestion in this region. Busy streets are one of the clearest signals of a successful and growing city, but when they become too clogged and too congested, as our poll showed people are reluctant to go to work and increasingly avoiding shopping, attending sporting event and other entertainment. Worse, an astounding number are questioning whether to even continue to call Toronto home. I appreciated the opportunity to speak with multiple news outlets--terrific hosts and reporters across TV, radio and print, today about why congestion poses significant challenges for business and the long-term health of our economy. Improving the flow of traffic has been a top priority for the Toronto Region Board of Trade and our Congestion Task Force, and it needs to be at the top of the heap for the city. If we don’t have a plan to fix this congestion crisis Toronto will lose out against jurisdictions across North America for business investment and urgently needed skilled and creative workforce. Today was about demonstrating how serious the problem is and why solutions are so urgently needed. Speeding up construction on the Gardiner Expressway’s rehabilitation, 24/7 construction where it is needed, and myriad other solutions must be fast-tracked. Stay tuned for more as the Board continues to drive this conversation and chart a path forward. Read Christine Dobby's report on our region's businesses are impacted by congestion: https://lnkd.in/ea-NEgFu\n\nCongratulations, Candace Laing, FCPHR on your appointment as the President & CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce! On behalf of Toronto region businesses, I look forward to working with you to support business growth and competitiveness here in the Toronto region and across the country. As former CCC Chair, your deep understanding of the Chamber network and the multiple challenges posed to the success of our business communities will be a great asset. And a big thank you to Perrin Beatty, P.C., O.C. for his many years of strong and steadfast advocacy and support for Canada’s business community - integral to driving policy changes that have strengthened our country's economic foundation.\n\nWhat a wonderful opportunity to host the Great Lakes Sustainable Growth Forum 2024! This 2-day event underscores the critical role the Great Lakes Region plays in driving Toronto region and North America's economic growth and prosperity. Generating CDN $66 billion in economic activity annually and moving 252 million metric tons of cargo, the Great Lakes are not only a defining geographic feature of our region, but they are also critical for our region's success and continued competitiveness. As a manufacturing and agrifood powerhouse, the Great Lakes Region boasts a US $6 trillion economy that would rank as the world’s 3rd largest if it were a country. Looking ahead, maintaining strong cross-border trade and connectivity is essential to keep our region competitive, especially as we witness this remarkable manufacturing resurgence in cities like Detroit, Chicago, and Toronto, driven by advanced production technologies and our quality labor force. This region is the birthplace of Free Trade in North America, but as we discussed today, the upcoming CUSMA review in 2026 presents major potential challenges. In an uncertain time, ensuring business certainty must be a priority. Equally important is continuing to build and enhance cross-border trade-enabling infrastructure. A special thanks to Premier Doug Ford for providing an update on Ontario's growing economic weight in the Great Lakes economy with close to $50-billion in recent investments in Ontario’s manufacturing revival, as well as coming investments in renewing and expanding Ontario’s nuclear power grid – the foundation for the jobs of tomorrow. Thanks to Douglas Porter and Don Guy for setting the stage and to our many fantastic panelists for sharing their insights on a diverse array of topics including port operations and infrastructure, the future of the region’s automotive industry and the importance of maintaining our critically important bilateral relationship. And of course, our thanks to Mark Fisher, B.Sc, ICD.D and the Council of the Great Lakes Region and all of our sponsors for making this event possible. Together, we are building a sustainable and prosperous future for our region. Looking forward to Day 2, tomorrow!"
