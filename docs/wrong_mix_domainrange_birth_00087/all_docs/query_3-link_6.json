        "text": "Tom Cruise Biography: Tom Cruise, a professional name, was born on July 3, 1962, as Thomas Cruise Mapother IV. Cruise is an American actor and producer who is among the highest-paid actors in the world. Throughout his tenure, he has been nominated for a British Academy Film Award, three Golden Globe Awards, and three Academy Awards. One of the most successful box office performers of all time, his films have grossed over $4 billion in North America and over $10.1 billion globally.\n\nTom Cruise: Early Life\n\nTom Cruise was born in New York City. His father, Thomas Cruise Mapother III, was an electrical engineer and died in 1984. His mother, Mary Lee, was a special education teacher. Cruise has three sisters: Lee Anne, Marian, and Cass. Thomas Cruise O’Mara, Tom Cruise’s great-grandfather, changed his name to “Thomas Cruise Mapother,” which is a Welsh last name. Cruise has English, German, and Irish roots. One of his great-grandfathers on his dad’s side, Patrick Russell Cruise, was born in North County Dublin in 1799. Teresa Johnson was his bride. They got married in 1825 at Warrenstown House in County Meath. In the same year, they left Ireland for the United States and settled down in New York.\n\nAlex Morgan Biography: Early Life, Net Worth, and Relationship\n\nTom Cruise: Career\n\nActor Tom Cruise got his start in New York City after finishing high school. After that, he moved to Los Angeles to try out for TV parts. In 1981, Cruise’s first movie job was in a small part in “Endless Love.” His work in “Taps” got him noticed by the well-known talent agency CAA. Beginning in the early 1990s, Cruise and Paula Wagner set up Cruise/Wagner Productions.\n\nWhile he was still alive, Cruise gave a legendary performance in the comedy/drama “Risky Business,” which made $64 million and became a cultural landmark. This movie got Cruise his first Golden Globe nod.\n\nIn 1986, Top Gun, which starred Tom Cruise, became one of the most popular movies of the year. Paul Newman and he worked together on “The Color of Money.” His movies “Cocktail” and “Rainman” kept doing well, and he won four Academy Awards for them.\n\n“Mission: Impossible,” a movie Cruise directed and starred in in 1996, was a huge hit that made $457 million and led to many sequels. He was also in “Jerry Maguire,” which made $275 million on a $50 million budget and got him a nod for an Oscar for Best Actor.\n\nCruise continued to have hits for the next ten years, with movies like “The Color of Money” and “Mission: Impossible: The Next Generation.”\n\nLarry David Biography: Net Worth, Career, and Relationship\n\nTom Cruise: Net Worth\n\nTom Cruise, an American actor and producer, has a net worth of $600 million. He is generally regarded as one of the most prominent figures in the annals of Hollywood. Additionally, he is among the wealthiest and most highly compensated celebrities in the globe. Tom Cruise’s films have generated $11.5 billion in global box office revenue as of this writing. However, it is intriguing that Tom’s films failed to surpass $1 billion in revenue for the majority of his career. Up until June 2022, his most lucrative film was “Mission: Impossible – Fallout,” which grossed $800 million worldwide in 2018. In late June 2022, Tom achieved the billion-dollar milestone as a result of the success of “Top Gun: Maverick,” which ultimately generated $1.5 billion.\n\nTom Cruise: Relationship\n\nTom Cruise is a wealthy actor who has been married several times. Actress Mimi Rogers brought him to Scientology. A girl named Suri was born to them after they got married. Katie is worth $10 million. Katie could ask Tom to pay her $400,000 a year in child support for 12 years, until 2024. Tom is also responsible for Suri’s school, insurance, medical bills, and hobbies outside of school. Katie didn’t want to raise their daughter in Scientology, so she has full custody of Suri.\n\nTom owns many beautiful homes all over the United States, such as a 10-story house in New York City, a property with multiple apartments in Hollywood Hills, and a mansion in Telluride, Colorado. He worked hard for years to get the local airport to add an extra runway. In May 2021, he sold the land for $39.5 million.\n\nTom has become a very rich actor because he has produced many movies that have made a total of $3 billion around the world. He and Paula Wagner started Cruise/Wagner Productions in 1993, and it has made $3 billion around the world. The arrangement stopped in 2006 because of Tom’s controversial antidepressant and psychiatric claims. Since then, the main sources of money have been hedge funds and Dan Snyder, the owner of the Washington Redskins. In 2006, United Artists hired Paula and Tom to help the company; it was having money problems at the time. Even though Paula left UA in 2008, she and Tom still own 30% of the company."
