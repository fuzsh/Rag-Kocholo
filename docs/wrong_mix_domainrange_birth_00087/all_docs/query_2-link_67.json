        "text": "Thomas Cruise Mapother, or just Tom Cruise, is a famous American actor and filmmaker. He came to this world in 1962 in Syracuse, and he was considered to be one of the most attractive and popular actors of the 1980s. His cinema debut took place in 1981 when he received his first roles in the movies Endless Love and Taps. He was really successful and great in portraying young, smiling, optimistic, and hardworking people. His roles in Rain Man (with Dustin Hoffman) and Born On the Fourth July brought him a real fame and plenty of awards or nominations. In the 1990s he was already a mature actor with the name and popularity all around the world. With these movies, Cruise started drifting from portraying good boys' characters to playing the roles of superheroes whose life is fast and filled up with action, like Days of Thunder, A Few Good Men (with Demi Moore and Jack Nicholson), Interview With the Vampire (with Brad Pitt and Kirsten Dunst), and finally Mission Impossible movie series where Cruise appeared as an agent who had to complete a number of quite difficult tasks, usually involving the latest technological developments and ideas. Ethan Hunt is undoubtedly the most famous and the most successful portrayal of Cruise. The actor is known as a very humble and easy-going person who does not like excessive luxury and leading too posh lifestyle. He was married 3 times and dated a number of famous actresses. He has 2 adopted children with Nicole Kidman and a beautiful daughter Suri with Kathie Holmes. Tom Cruise is a devoted Scientologist and art collector."
