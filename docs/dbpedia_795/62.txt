From Friday, al-Araby al-Jadeed will present excerpts from the memoirs of Syria's former vice president, Farouk al-Sharaa â€“ once one of the regime's most important figures.

The Missing Account gives the inside story of the Damascus powerbases of Syrian presidents Hafaz and Bashar al-Assad, backed by vivid and previously undisclosed accounts of Syria's most important historical events that helped shape the current climate in the country.

Having served as foreign minister for more than two decades, Sharaa's 448-page memoirs unveils the shadowy workings of Syria's diplomatic corps, such as including the top-secret negotiations between the Baathist regime and Israel during the end of Hafez al-Assad's rule.

Sharaa was one of the Syrian regime's most active representatives in the Geneva talks between Hafez al-Assad, Israeli diplomats and generals, and the US secretary of state Madeline Albright and ex-president Bill Clinton.

His insightful account of the events reveals the tensions and fraught conversations between the two rival states, along with the real reasons that the talks ended in failure.

Sharaa also reveals the relationship between Hafez and his brother Rifaat, who has been accused of orchtestrating the Hama massacre in 1980, along with the fraught relations between the Syria and Iraq under Saddam Hussein.

The Missing Account also helps explain the complex relationship between Damascus and Palestine Liberation Organisation leader Yasser Arafat, along with Syria's intervention and occupation of Lebanon.

This is a vital account of Syrian political events for historians and political analysts of the Middle East and Cold War era.
