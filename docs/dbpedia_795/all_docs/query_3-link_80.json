        "text": "I quickly changed my clothes and headed to the president's residence. As I approached, I noticed the cars of the Ba'ath Party Regional Command members and a gathering of military personnel, which confirmed my suspicions of his death.\n\nUpon entering the reception hall, I found Dr. Bashar al-Assad with the leadership members and Brigadier General Assef Shawkat (Fromer Director of Military Intelligence, Deputy Chief of Staff, and President Hafez al-Assad's son-in-law).\n\nThe discussion centred around announcing the death and determining the Quranic verses that should be included in the obituary.\n\nLater that evening, I met with Dr. Bashar al-Assad at his home. We discussed the current situation and the necessary measures that needed to be taken in Ba'ath Party and the amy.\n\nOn 13 June, we travelled to Qardaha and arrived in the evening for the burial, which was attended by several Arab officials.\n\nConcern over emergence of opposition\n\nAfter the funeral, I returned to my home in Banias at 9 PM. Upon my arrival, I received information that an Arab leader wanted to meet me in Damascus. I immediately headed to the capital.\n\nI went directly to Tishreen Palace, where I found the distinguished guest waiting for me. We engaged in a conversation about the personality of President Hafez al-Assad, whom he held in great regard. The guest then shifted the topic to the situation in Syria.\n\n\"People are currently in a state of mourning,\" he said, \"but in a month or two, the mourning will subside, and there may be potential for opposition. External parties might incite them. So, Abu Jamal [Khaddam], I hope you stand by Dr. Bashar, and that we all cooperate for the sake of the country's interests.\"\n\nHe emphasised that his country does not tolerate destabilisation in Syria. I assured him that no one can undermine unity and stability in Syria, and there is no need to worry about the armed forces.\n\nAfter the meeting concluded, I bid farewell to the guest and returned to my home.\n\nFirst Ba'ath conference after Hafez death\n\nThe 9th Regional Conference of the Ba'ath Party took place from 17-21 June 2002, marking the first conference held after the death of President Hafez al-Assad.\n\nPrior to the conference, I engaged in discussions with Dr. Bashar regarding the structure of the new Regional Command of the Ba'ath Party. His perspective was to avoid making extensive changes to avoid accusations of removing those who had been close to his father.\n\nDuring the conference, it was decided to establish a committee chaired by Dr. Bashar, of which I was a member. The committee's task was to propose the names of the Central Committee members and the Regional Command to be presented to the conference.\n\nDuring the lunch break on the last day, I left with fellow party members to have lunch at my place in Damascus. However, while en route on Mezzeh Highway, I received a phone call from Mr. Muhyiddin Muslimani, the Director of Presidential Protocol, informing me that the committee was currently meeting and that I should return to participate.\n\nI stopped the car, and my three comrades disembarked while I made my way back to the conference centre. Upon my arrival, I entered the meeting room where discussions were taking place regarding the formation of the leadership.\n\nFollowing President Bashar's referendum and his oath-taking ceremony, I had a meeting with him on 23 July 2000. During this meeting, I presented him with a memorandum addressing issues of party and political reform, as well as our stance on modernisation.\n\nThe following day, we had another meeting to further discuss these matters. He welcomed the ideas and suggested that they be deliberated within the Ba'ath Party Regional Command.\n\nIndeed, the ideas were discussed among the leadership, and it was agreed upon that priority should be given to economic reform, which received consensus among the leadership members.\n\nResignation from Lebanon file\n\nDuring my first encounter with Dr. Bashar in 1994, we met in Qardaha following the passing of his brother Bassel, whom I also first met during the mourning period for their grandmother.\n\nDue to the age difference, I did not have direct dealings with President Hafez's children or the children of other officials. However, there existed a friendly atmosphere and camaraderie among our respective children.\n\nWhile attending Bassel's funeral in Qardaha, a decision was made to wrap up Dr. Bashar's academic studies in London. He returned to Damascus and resumed his studies and underwent a military training course.\n\nUpon his graduation, he took on various roles related to army affairs as well as governmental matters. Dr. Bashar established close relationships with Lebanese leaders such as Mr. Suleiman Frangieh, who had also shared a close bond with his late brother Bassel.\n\nSimilar relationships were formed with Mr. Talal Arslan and Mr. Michel Samaha, who both opposed the government of the late Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Suleiman Frangieh played a significant role in facilitating relations between the Lebanese Army Commander, General Emile Lahoud, and Dr. Bashar.\n\nI had engaged in repeated discussions with President Hafez, expressing my objections to the nomination of Lahoud for the presidency. My position on Lahoud's election was well-known, and I believed that it would affect my relationship with President Hafez.\n\nConsequently, when Lahoud was elected in 1998, I requested President Hafez al-Assad to relieve me of my involvement in the Lebanon file. He agreed to my request, and that marked the conclusion of my political management of the file. I relinquished my role in Lebanon.\n\nPrior to his presidency, I had several meetings with Dr. Bashar, during which our conversations centred around reforming and developing the system, particularly after setting a date for the Ba'ath Party Conference.\n\nAs part of our cooperative relationship, I presented proposals, including comprehensive studies on economic reforms in all sectors of the national economy. I also presented studies on administrative, judicial, and educational reforms.\n\nThe leadership within the Ba'ath Party carefully examined the economic issue for over a month and a half, resulting in a comprehensive document that embraced many of the ideas I had put forth.\n\nHowever, little progress was made in implementing substantial economic reforms. The prevailing view was that economic reform without administrative reform would not address the underlying issues plaguing the economy.\n\nThis state of affairs persisted until the passing of President Hafez on 10 June 2000.\n\nKhaddam's resignation\n\nAs the Ba'ath Party conference in June 2005 approached, I began preparing myself to resign from my positions and leave the country to take a few months for me to get ready to embark on a new phase away from the burdens of power.\n\nA few days before the conference, the Regional Command convened a meeting to discuss the reports to be presented at the conference. During the meeting, members of the command competed in praising the great achievements of the party.\n\nAlthough I was not initially scheduled to speak at this meeting, I felt compelled to do so. I began by saying, \"I will say a few words, not an extended speech.\" However, I ended up speaking in great detail about the internal and external situations.\n\nOnce the session concluded, I approached Dr. Bashar and expressed my desire to meet with him before the conference. We agreed to meet the following morning, and during our meeting, we discussed the upcoming conference and the potential composition of the new command.\n\nI informed him of my decision to announce my resignation from all partisan and political positions within the country. Additionally, I shared my intention to leave after the conference and take a period of rest in Paris while preparing my memoirs for publication.\n\nThe meeting went very smoothly.\n\nOn the following day, just hours before the conference, I received numerous requests not to speak during the morning session of the political committee meeting, where domestic and foreign policy issues were to be discussed.\n\nDespite these requests, I chose to disregard them and began my speech by announcing my resignation from my party and political positions.\n\nI stated, \"After nearly 60 years of working in the party since its inception and 41 years in power, it is time for us to make way for the younger generation.\n\nI then proceeded to address various topics, including domestic politics, foreign policy, the Arab and international situation, the stagnant nature of our foreign policy, the lack of initiative, and the decline of our standing in the Arab and international arenas.\n\nI also touched upon the strained relations between Syria and several Arab countries. Although Foreign Minister Farouk Al-Sharaa attempted to interrupt me, I requested that he allow me to continue with my speech.\n\nAfter I finished my speech, Al-Sharaa interjected and said, \"I am surprised by Comrade Abu Jamal's pessimism. All the people are with us; no one against us.\"\n\nAs he continued to speak, I interrupted him, asking: \"Are the people with us simply because they are hungry? Are they with us because if someone wants to secure employment within the government, they are rejected due to lack of partisan affiliation? Are the people with us because corruption is rampant within the state?\"\n\nThe conference proceeded as usual, but the discussions were more candid and serious in nature. During the final session, Dr. Bashar al-Assad, in his capacity as the Regional Secretary, was granted the authority to nominate the members of the Regional Command. The names were announced at the conclusion of the session.\n\nA day after the conference concluded, Dr. Al-Assad contacted me, and we discussed the conference. I informed him that I would be spending a few months in Paris, where I planned to prepare for the publication of my memoirs.\n\nIt was a positive conversation, and I wish he had listened to my suggestions. If he had, perhaps he would not have found himself in the besieged position he later faced, and the situation in Syria would not have escalated to its current state.\n\nIn 2005, Khaddam travelled to Paris and announced his defection. He passed away in late March 2020."
