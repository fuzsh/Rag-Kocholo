        "text": "This collection ofstudies is the harvest of a one-day symposium held at the University of Haifa in January 1984. The initiative came from the University's Institute for Middle Eastern Studies. Bearing the name of Gustav Heinemann, the late President of the Federal Republic of Germany, the IMESH is an interdisciplinary meeting ground for researchers in Islamic studies, Arab history and culture, politics and international relations in the Middle East, ethnic relations, the social psychology of international conflicts, the political geography of conflict and problems of education in a conflict environment.\n\nThe Syrian–Iranian axis is one of the most intriguing developments in modern Middle East politics. In the turbulent 1980s, the nature and longevity of the Tehran–Damascus partnership baffled many scholars and observers. Many were quick to write it off as a short term, opportunistic alliance against Iraq, or describe it as a marriage of convenience that would dissolve rapidly once Iran ceased to deliver oil to Syria. Pointing to many differences in their respective ideologies, as well as their social and political foundations, most analysts expressed surprise at how a revolutionary, pan-Islamic theocracy like Iran could form an alliance with a secular, pan-Arab socialist republic like Syria.\n\nThe foreign policy literature on the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is plentiful, and cer- tainly has a rich and volatile sample to consider. Foreign policy analysis of the Gulf, however, is often hindered by the ‘black box’ of leadership within the Gulf Arab states. Our theories, including rentierism, simplify rather than tease out the idiosyncrasies between Gulf states and their mechanisms of policy making. The purpose of this workshop1 and the papers presented here is to address drivers of foreign policy within GCC member-states, and sub- sequent interaction and effect of these policies in neighbouring countries. What we might also achieve is some shared conceptual clarity on frameworks for analysing foreign policy in the subregion, and to put forward some hypotheses about how the process of state-building in the region is changing both the agents and the practice of policy making.\n\nThe chapter’s main objective is to explore the dynamic interplay between sectarianism and power politics in the Middle East, and Syria in particular. To what extent has political realignment along sectarian lines become a significant driver of developments in the region? The depiction of the Syrian conflict as a sectarian proxy war that has taken the form of “Sunni versus Shi’a” covers only part of the highly localized, externally penetrated and complicated war. The principal argument is that regional actors involved in the Syrian war employ all necessary means—sectarian narratives among them—in their struggle for survival and maximization of influence.\n\nIn the period after 2000 there was a closeness in the relations of Turkey and Syria. Syria and Turkey who looks as friends in 2009, were in tension about water, terror and Hatay before. Especially they were in tension about terror issue. They came to a verge of war in 1998. But after the Adana Agreement, Syria stopped to support PKK nad the other terrorist organisations. So the relations began to develop. In 2009 even they signed an agreement that abolish the visas between two countries. But when the Arab Spring began, those good relations again came to an and the relations between parts came to a point that can't be normalized anymore.\n\nThis document is meant for all those interested in the lead up and current events surrounding the war in Syria and the creation of ISIS. Below is a timeline ranging from 1992-2015 with related articles to the war in Syria, ISIS and geopolitical events that tie them all together. Purposely the author of this document provides NO COMMENTARY. You will notice that each citation is met with origin of the article, date published and key quotations. Also, the author attempted to find sources that many “Westerners” would consider “mainstream”, with the exception of a few. Lastly, at the end of the timeline, one can find longer articles and videos that the reader can dive into if interested.\n\nAlthough it represents a key element of the Syrian conflict, the sectarian dimension has not received the attention it deserves. From the outbreak of the popular uprising in March 2011, both the Syrian regime and the Islamist rebels have used sectarianism to obtain support inside and outside the country. At the same time, the regional powers have encouraged sectarianism to strengthen their position in the conflict and mobilize their allies. The emergence of various jihadist groups, such as the Al-Nusra Front and the Islamic State, was followed by the mobilization of several regional Shia militias by the Iranian forces. For all of them, the conflict has turned into a zero sum game in which the sectarian dimension plays a central role."
