        "text": "For decades, Farouk al-Sharaa was one of Syria's most important figures, serving as foreign minister and vice president for decades. From 29 January, al-Araby al-Jadeed will present segments of his memoirs.\n\n2 min read\n\nFrom Friday, al-Araby al-Jadeed will present excerpts from the memoirs of Syria's former vice president, Farouk al-Sharaa â€“ once one of the regime's most important figures.\n\nThe Missing Account gives the inside story of the Damascus powerbases of Syrian presidents Hafaz and Bashar al-Assad, backed by vivid and previously undisclosed accounts of Syria's most important historical events that helped shape the current climate in the country.\n\nHaving served as foreign minister for more than two decades, Sharaa's 448-page memoirs unveils the shadowy workings of Syria's diplomatic corps, such as including the top-secret negotiations between the Baathist regime and Israel during the end of Hafez al-Assad's rule.\n\nSharaa was one of the Syrian regime's most active representatives in the Geneva talks between Hafez al-Assad, Israeli diplomats and generals, and the US secretary of state Madeline Albright and ex-president Bill Clinton.\n\nHis insightful account of the events reveals the tensions and fraught conversations between the two rival states, along with the real reasons that the talks ended in failure.\n\nSharaa also reveals the relationship between Hafez and his brother Rifaat, who has been accused of orchtestrating the Hama massacre in 1980, along with the fraught relations between the Syria and Iraq under Saddam Hussein.\n\nThe Missing Account also helps explain the complex relationship between Damascus and Palestine Liberation Organisation leader Yasser Arafat, along with Syria's intervention and occupation of Lebanon.\n\nThis is a vital account of Syrian political events for historians and political analysts of the Middle East and Cold War era.\n\nThis article is an edited translation from our Arabic edition."
