        "text": "Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying held a press conference on December 18, 2012.\n\nQ: President of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party Shinzo Abe said at a press conference on December 17 that Japan-China relations were important bilateral relations to Japan, and it was important to manage the problems between the two countries, adding that Japan would \"persistently\" continue its dialogue with China and improve bilateral relations. What is China's comment?\n\nA: China-Japan relations are one of the most important bilateral relations to each other. To maintain the long-term, healthy and stable development of China-Japan relations is not only in the interests of the two countries, but also of great significance to the peaceful development of Asia. As I said yesterday, China attaches great importance to Japan's policy toward China, and always stands for proper management and settlement of conflicts and differences. We hope the Japanese side could have a deep understanding of and properly deal with the difficulties and problems between the two countries, and push for the healthy and stable development of bilateral relations in accordance with the principles and spirit of the four political documents between China and Japan.\n\nQ: Syrian Vice President Farouk al-Sharaa reportedly said in an interview recently that neither the Syrian government troops nor the armed opposition groups could get a \"definitive victory\", thus a comprehensive historical plan was needed for the resolution of the Syrian crisis, in which both sides of the conflict should stop violence at the same time and form a national unity government with extensive power under the auspices of regional countries and members of the UN Security Council. What is China's attitude toward the political transition process in Syria?\n\nA: China always maintains that the Syrian issue cannot be solved by force, and political resolution is the only practical way out. China respects the independent choice made by the Syrian people, and is positive and open to any political resolution plan that is widely accepted by relevant parties in Syria. We once again urge all parties concerned in Syria to immediately cease fire and stop violence, open dialogue at an early date, formulate through consultations a roadmap of political transition, establish a transitional governing body of broad representation, and implement political transition on the basis of the communiquÃ© of the Geneva foreign ministers' meeting of the Action Group on Syria and other international consensus for an early end of the Syrian crisis.\n\nQ: Kyodo News reported that in its survey of newly elected members of the House of Representatives during the campaign, more than two-thirds of them were in favor of amending relevant provisions of Japan's pacifist constitution, and more than 80 percent were for the right to exercise collective self-defense. What is China's comment?\n\nA: It has always been an issue of wide concern to Japan's neighbouring countries in Asia and the international community whether Japan could face squarely and reflect upon its history of invasion and follow the path of peaceful development. In recent years, there is a tendency in Japan to break away from the post-war system and deny peaceful development, which has roused the concern of some far-sighted Japanese and high alert for Asian countries and the international community. We hope that Japan could respond to the trend of the times, follow the path of peaceful development, and play a constructive role in regional peace, stability and development."
