        "text": "Acceptance of Farouk al-Sharaa as the Leader of the Transitional Stage\n\nبسم الله الرحمن الرحيم\n\nAcceptance by the Opposition Syrian National Council of Farouk al-Sharaa as the Leader of the Transitional Stage is Clear Evidence of the Opposition's Disconnection from the Sufferings and Hopes of the Blessed Revolution in al-Sham\n\n(Translated)\n\nAt a time of heightened tension on the Turkish-Syrian border, following the bombing by Syrian forces on the Turkish town of Okjakali, killing a Turkish family of five; Turkish Foreign Minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, revived an old proposal. This proposal summarised Syrian Vice President, Farouq al-Sharaa, will replace his boss, Bashar, in serving America by championing the transitional government to stop the on-going civil war in Syria, which is along the same lines of the Yemeni model.\n\nDavutoglu did not stop there, further adding an ugly melody claiming al-Sharaa is \"a man of mind and conscience; he has not participated in the massacres in Syria, and no one else knows the regime in Syria better than him.\" He added that the opposition is inclined to accept al-Sharaa to lead the future Syrian administration. No sooner had Davutoglu concluded his folly, approval statements came from the dying so-called opposition of the National Council, calling for the American recognition and endorsement. It was also announced that an extensive meeting from the opposition will be held in Qatar on 17/10/2012 to promote this proposal and hear responses.\n\nIn response to what we have mentioned, Hizb ut-Tahrir reminds Muslims in Syria of the following facts:\n\n- This proposal is an American one, presented on the lips of Davutoglu and others through its study of solutions designed according to its manner, in order to see how it would be received! We ask Davutoglu: Did you not realize the situation on the ground has gone far beyond this infamous project?! Did you not know Farouk al-Sharaa is in the grip of Bashar?! How he will implement any proposal without Assad's approval?! Indeed this is a foul tasting American meal, unacceptable, except to those with rotten and corrupt tastes!\n\n- Farouq al-Sharaa is a secularist, a Baathist and a child of this regime. He was brought up by the senior al-Assad, and inherited by his son. A man like al-Sharaa, who worked for fifteen years as Foreign Minister at the time of Assad Senior, then as Vice President to Bashar during his term, illustrates that he has satisfied the two criminals: Hafez and Bashar. Despite knowing they have never tolerated any deviations from their policies. His tenure during these two positions clearly indicates the strength of al-Sharaa's loyalty to America, who may have recommended to not abandon him to both father and son, just as it now recommends him as an alternative to Bashar.\n\n- Hizb ut-Tahrir warns sincere individuals from the political opposition abroad, and the armed believer opposition of Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, and their own media and anyone who tries to sell the noblest revolution cheaply. These pretend to support your revolution to dictate the solutions of their masters. Were they honest with you, they would have provided you with weapons which would have speedily resolved the fate of the Syrian criminal regime, and would have saved you from the further killing of your fathers, mothers and children. Instead, they refrained from doing so and justified their actions saying (like their masters), \"We fear these weapons might reach terrorist groups.\" You know that they imply Islam when saying 'terrorism' and terrorist groups are the armed Islamic groups. Indeed Allah Almighty said the Truth:\n\nوَمَا نَقَمُوا مِنْهُمْ إِلَّا أَنْ يُؤْمِنُوا بِاللَّهِ الْعَزِيزِ الْحَمِيدِ\n\n\"Against these they had no grudge except that they believed in Allah, the Most Mighty, and the Most Praiseworthy.\" [Al-Buruj, 85:8]\n\nO Muslims in Al-Sham of Victory:\n\nThe best response to all conspiracies plotted for us in Syria is to hold fast to the strong rope of Allah, the Book of Allah. Whoever holds on to it will be guided onto the straight path. The strongest response to our enemy, both visible and invisible, the near and the far, is to join our words with the work to establish the second rightly guided Khilafah, in which we would live happily or die for it as martyrs. The dear price we gave of our martyrs, the moans of our wounded, the cries of our bereaved women and the sufferings of our children; none of this will be wasted, Allah willing, by politicians who are agents and their masters. We would instead achieve through it a great victory in this world and in the Supreme Paradise in the Afterlife, Allah willing. So, let us raise the ceiling of our goals until they reach the sky; for we are the people of al-Sham, which our beloved Prophet said about: «طوبى للشام» \"Blessed is al-Sham.\"\n\nAnd we, Allah willing, from the people of His Almighty promise:\n\nوَعَدَ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ آَمَنُوا مِنْكُمْ وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ لَيَسْتَخْلِفَنَّهُمْ فِي الْأَرْضِ كَمَا اسْتَخْلَفَ الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِهِمْ وَلَيُمَكِّنَنَّ لَهُمْ دِينَهُمُ الَّذِي ارْتَضَى لَهُمْ وَلَيُبَدِّلَنَّهُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ خَوْفِهِمْ أَمْنًا يَعْبُدُونَنِي لَا يُشْرِكُونَ بِي شَيْئًا وَمَنْ كَفَرَ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ فَأُولَئِكَ هُمُ الْفَاسِقُونَ\n\n\"Allah has promised, to those among you who believe and work righteous deeds, that He will, of a surety, grant them in the land, inheritance (of power), as He granted it to those before them; that He will establish in authority their religion - the one which He has chosen for them; and that He will change (their state), after the fear in which they (lived), to one of security and peace: 'They will worship Me (alone) and not associate aught with Me. 'If any do reject Faith after this, they are rebellious and wicked.\" [An-Nur, 24:55]\n\nHizb-ut Tahrir\n\nWilayah Syria\n\n24 Dhu al-Qi'dah 1433\n\n2012/10/10\n\nLabels\n\nAssalam wa alaikum wa rahmatullah wabarakatahu, Dear Brothers & Sisters, We are saddened to see Muslims today even those who practise many of the rules of Islam are working in jobs which involve haram in the financial sector. They are working in positions which involve usurious (Riba) transactions, insurance, the stock market and the like. Even though many of the clear evidences regarding the severity of the sin of Riba are known, some have justified their job to themselves thinking that they are safe as long as they are not engaged in the actual action of taking or giving Riba. Brothers & Sisters, You should know that the majority of jobs in the financial sector, even the IT jobs in this area are haram (prohibited) as they involve the processing of prohibited contracts. If you work in this sector, do not justify your job to yourself because of the fear of losing your position or having to change your career, fear Allah as he should be feared and consider His law regard\n\nQuestion: Please explain the hukm regarding separation of children in their beds. At what age is separation an obligation upon the parents? Also can a parent sleep in the same bed as their child? Answer: 1- With regards to separating children in their beds, it is clear that the separation which is obligatory is when they reach the age of 7 and not since their birth. This is due to the hadith reported by Daarqutni and al-Hakim from the Messenger (saw) who said: When your children reach the age of 7 then separate their beds and when they reach 10 beat them if they do not pray their salah.’ This is also due to what has been narrated by al-Bazzar on the authority of Abi Rafi’ with the following wording: ‘We found in a sheet near the Messenger of Allah (saw) when he died on which the following was written: Separate the beds of the slave boys and girls and brothers and sisters of 7 years of age.’ The two hadiths are texts on the separation of children when they reach the age of 7. As for the\n\nQuestion Are these ḥadith sound? Are the references provided correct and accurate? When you see the belly of Makkah will be cleft open and through it will be dug out river-like passages (i.e. tunnels) (or water in the road to Makkah), and you see the buildings surpass its mountains, then take care (or beware, or a variant has: then know that the matter is at hand, or then understand that the time of trial (Judgment day) is near at hand). [Narrated by Al-Azraqi in the Book of reports about Makkah – Kitab Akhbaar Makkah, Hadiyth-1725; A specific Hadiyth (in fact several related-Hadiyths) which prophesizes about this Tower. Itha ra’aitun mecca bu’ijat katha’ima, wa ya-tasawa bunyanuha ru’usa jibaliha, faqad athalati as-Sa’atu. When you see Mecca, its mountain with holes (pierced through them), and its buildings reach its mountain tops, then as-Sa’ah (the Hour) has already cast its shadow. [Suyuti] So when you see in Makkah that channels have already been dug (or tunnels built), and you"
