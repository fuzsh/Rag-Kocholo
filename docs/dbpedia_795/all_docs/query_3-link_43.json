        "text": "To bookmark or link to this page, use the address www.bbc.co.uk/reporters\n\nThe BBC's unrivalled team of correspondents is bringing you news from the Gulf and reaction from around the world. On this page BBC News Online logs their impressions and personal experiences as they watch events unfold.\n\nMost recent postings are at the top.\n\nSaturday, 12 April\n\nDamascus :: Kim Ghattas :: 2018GMT\n\nSyria has again rejected US accusations that it is helping the Iraqi leadership in any way.\n\nThe US accusations were baseless and were just an attempt to divert attention from the US's failures in Iraq, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa said in a joint news conference with his French counterpart.\n\nHe said Syria was being victimised by a superpower that didn't know what it was doing.\n\nMr al-Sharaa accused the US of wanting to destroy Iraq by targeting not only the regime, but also Iraq's institutions.\n\nHe did not address specifics of the US accusations and didn't say anything about Iraqi leadership figures hiding in Syria, but he rejected the US claims as a whole.\n\nBaghdad :: Ben Brown :: 2015GMT\n\nThe Americans are talking about a possible night-time curfew although a lot of the looting goes on during the day in broad daylight - the looters don't seem very ashamed about what they're doing.\n\nThey're also talking about joint patrols with old Iraqi police officers who they're urging to come back to work - so far about 80 of them have done so. The problem is there's no functioning government to pay these officers so they're asking why they should come back.\n\nThe Americans are absolutely cock-a-hoop over the surrender of Saddam Hussein's former chief scientific adviser General Amir al-Saadi. The general was the man who was always put in front of us, the press, in the run-up to the war, to deny absolutely they had any weapons of mass destruction.\n\nHe was one of Saddam Hussein's key advisers and intelligence officers will already be interrogating him to see what more he knows.\n\nKirkuk :: Dumeetha Luthra :: 1751GMT\n\nIn a swirl of cheering and music, American troops went on parade through the main square of Kirkuk this evening.\n\nThey're here and they want everyone to see it. The soldiers have been increasing their profile in the city as Kurdish troops very slowly pull out. Since its fall, Kirkuk has been relatively calm.\n\nThere has been some looting, but Kurdish soldiers have been trying to maintain a degree of law and order.\n\nThere are now checkpoints on the roads out of town. Cars are stopped and examined for loot. Any found is taken from the car and brought back to the city.\n\nIt's this role that the Americans must now take up, but their numbers are limited and Kirkuk's tense ethnic balance could still spark trouble. Arab and Turkman residents have been accusing Kurds of looting cars and houses.\n\nThey feel they're being targeted and want someone to do something about it quickly\n\nCentcom, Qatar :: Jon Brain :: 1724GMT\n\nCoalition commanders insist it's unrealistic for their troops to be expected to restore law and order in areas where they're still encountering armed resistance.\n\nThey say that Baghdad remains a war zone. But they've clearly been disconcerted by the reaction to the scenes of violence and looting currently being broadcast across the world.\n\nAt today's briefing Brigadier General Vincent Brooks promised the coalition would do everything in its power to alleviate the situation and he claimed the number of incidents was already falling.\n\nAlthough the problem of looting remains, the aid situation is improving.\n\nTwenty tonnes of medical supplies were flown into Baghdad airport last night, the first such flight since the city fell to the coalition.\n\nSupplies of food discovered in Iraqi army stores are being distributed by American troops.\n\nOn the battlefield attention is increasingly turning towards Tikrit, the Baath Party's power base. While air strikes continue, coalition ground forces are getting every closer.\n\nCentral Command believes remnants of the Republican Guard may be regrouping there with the possible intention of staging a last stand against the coalition.\n\nBasra :: Clive Myrie :: 1707GMT\n\nIt is pretty quiet here at the moment.\n\nWe're not seeing as much looting as we did in previous days. The crime has moved on to a new level, it is now muggings and car jackings.\n\nThe British are under pressure to do something about it. They have about 1000 troops on the ground here patrolling the streets.\n\nThis is a big city, a sprawling metropolis. The British are saying they need local help and we are going to see Iraqi police back on the streets. They say that 70 local policemen have been vetted and will return to patrols on the city streets.\n\nThis is a bold move the British are taking but is been seen as a positive step.\n\nLocal people say it is difficult to find policemen who are not part of the old regime.\n\nDaily life is difficult, it has just started raining which is a Godsend here. There is marked shortage of clean water. Tankers from Kuwait have been coming over the border but there is still shortages.\n\nElectricity is intermittent, makes things difficult particularly in the hospitals.\n\nWashington D.C. :: Jon Leyne :: 1651GMT\n\nOpponents and supporters of the war have both been gathering in the city today.\n\nThe anti-war protestors say they will continue to call for an end to the occupation of Iraq.\n\nBaghdad :: David Willis :: 1643GMT\n\nShortly before dusk just as the afternoon sun was melting behind the Tigris a hail of machine gun fire erupted from across the river towards our hotel.\n\nUS marines returned fire, at two buildings. Exchanges went on for about half an hour before they moved tanks across the river.\n\nBaghdad :: Ben Brown :: 1621GMT\n\nA firefight has taken place right outside our hotel this evening. A surreal calm was shattered.\n\nUS marines ran to take up their places.\n\nThe looting continues too. I met one surgeon in a city hospital armed with a Kalashnikov to protect his hospital.\n\nThe Americans say they are thinking about bringing in 1200 law enforcement officers to help get the police force working.\n\nThere have been reports that a senior official, General Amir al-Saadi, who represented the Iraqi regime during talks with UN chief weapons inspectors before the war and features on the US' \"most wanted\" list has surrendered.\n\nHe still insists that Iraq has no chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. He is a big fish and US intelligence officers will be keen to talk to him.\n\nBasra :: Jennifer Glass :: 1600GMT\n\nLooting and lawlessness remain a problem in Iraq's second largest city, Basra.\n\nIn a town of one point four-million people British forces have been in control of the town for six days.\n\nThe commander of 7th Armoured Brigade says he's trying to get Iraqi police out on to the streets to restore order. Every day he says there is less and less looting and crime and that little by little life is getting back to normal.\n\nNorthern Baghdad :: Andrew North :: 1543 GMT\n\nAmerican Marines have started patrols in the north eastern area of Baghdad, but there is no sign of the disorder here ending.\n\nA battalion has moved into the Al Qud area where they believe Iraqi fighters may still be hiding.\n\nWith shooting being heard across this area these fighters could be anywhere.\n\nCairo, Egypt :: Heba Saleh :: 1534GMT\n\nThe French Foreign Minister, Dominic de Villepin, has said that the United Nations should play a central role in the reconstruction of Iraq.\n\nAddressing an invited audience in Cairo after a meeting with the Egyptian President, Hosni Mubarak, he also said the coalition forces had the primary responsibility for restoring order in Iraq.\n\nThe Minister is at the start of a tour which will take him to Syria, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia.\n\nMr de Villepin started his speech in Cairo with a long, flowery introduction which emphasised the strong cultural and historical ties between Europe and the Middle East.\n\nFrance, it seems, wants to remind the Arabs that it is a longstanding ally which should not be written off. The US may have had its way over Iraq but French policy, Mr. de Villepin seemed to be suggesting, is closer to Arab positions on key issues.\n\nThe French Minister spoke of the need for a just peace between Israel and the Palestinians. He said the plan known as \"the road map to peace,\" must be published and implemented without delay.\n\nFrance, he said, would be prepared to host an international conference to define the framework needed for reaching peace. Mr. de Villepin's vision is certain to be welcomed by Arab public opinion. His tour comes at a time when American credibility is at its lowest in the region.\n\nMany Arabs feel that Iraq has now been occupied by the Americans. Some Arab newspapers even accuse the coalition forces of encouraging the looters in Iraq.\n\nMosul :: John Simpson :: 1531GMT\n\nIt is difficult to move around the city at present but things here do appear to be stabilising. 800 more American troops are patrolling the city.\n\nThe situation remains difficult, the basic problem is that the uprising, jointly planned by the Kurds and the Arabs, didn't get the necessary support of the Americans when that was needed.\n\nKirkuk :: Dumeetha Luthra :: 1523GMT\n\nKurdish troops are slowly withdrawing from here. I am told they will all have gone by the end of the day.\n\nThe fighters may certainly have all disappeared by the end of the day but will they have left the city, that is the question. I saw thousands pour in on Thursday, but I have not seen that number leave today.\n\nI'm standing in the central square now and there has been celebratory scenes happening here. But in the last few minutes I have heard a number of explosions. I can see black smoke and hear ambulances. People here are dispersing now.\n\nThere remains the potential for trouble here, as the ethnic anger grows in the city.\n\nI went out to the oilfields earlier today. They are intact, the Americans have secured them.\n\nSome Arabs there said there had been some looting in a nearby village but not on the scale it is happening in other towns.\n\nWashington D.C. :: Philippa Thomas :: 1518GMT\n\nThey are very anxious here about coalition forces having to act as police forces on the streets of Baghdad and other Iraqi cities.\n\nThey do not want their troops bogged down in this.\n\nThere are questions being asked about duties the coalition countries have to restore security under the Geneva Convention.\n\nIt is an ongoing question and they do not have the answers here.\n\nBaghdad :: David Willis :: 1506GMT\n\nJust a few minutes ago there was the sound of gunfire all around us here, machinegun fire.\n\nFor a while there was quite an intense firefight.\n\nIt appears to have been targeted at the US troops.\n\nAs I was peering out over the hotel balcony I could see the US Marines trying to identify where this shooting was coming from.\n\nIt is quiet again now. It shows that Baghdad is not secure.\n\nPentagon, Washington D.C. :: Nick Childs :: 1455GMT\n\nThe US Navy could withdraw up to three of its five aircraft carriers that have been involved in operations over Iraq.\n\nThe senior US naval commander in the region, Vice-Admiral Timothy Keating, has said the first ship could be leaving in a few days.\n\nKut :: David Loyn :: 1436GMT\n\nThe town of Kut is now in American hands. This eastern route will now be open to American and British troops.\n\nThe general I'm with says he runs Iraq between the Tigris river and the Euphrates.\n\nThe Americans have been greeted with open arms.\n\nThe other concern here is looting. I'm in a school here with electrical power. This is the first place I have seen electricity. Water is available here for about one hour a day.\n\nI'm really struck by how dictatorship does impoverish people.\n\nThis is an oil rich country and you can see open sewage running alongside the road, clearly low education levels. A broken depressed tribal people without expectations.\n\nThis is the first place I have seen electricity. Power is available here for about one hour a day.\n\nThe reconstruction effort is going to have to be enormous.\n\nBaghdad :: David Willis :: 1424GMT\n\nThe situation is still fairly lawless here. There have been pockets of resistance. The Americans have appealed for the police force to get back to work along with other civilian employees.\n\nIt appears that about 80 of the former police force have volunteered to do so. The question is what will be the reaction of people to men that represented the regime they hate so much back on the streets.\n\nThe US State Department has said it is sending 1200 police officers but they won't be here for some time.\n\nWe've seen anecdotal evidence that US Marines are beginning to get more of a handle on it but it remains a very volatile situation here and the Marines are very thinly spread.\n\nHyde Park, London :: Clarence Mitchell :: 1345GMT\n\nThe organisers are saying that something like 100,000 people have taken to the streets again marching against the war in Iraq through the centre of London.\n\nInitially it looked as if the figures would be very much lower compared to previous turnouts but they have picked up somewhat and are now gathered here in Hyde Park.\n\nThe organisers here deny the conflict in Iraq has been relatively casualty-free. They say it's now more vital than ever to make their voice heard. They claim many people are still dying needlessly and it's still an immoral and illegal action that's taking place.\n\nThey say none of them were friends of Saddam Hussein. Many people on the march have welcomed the fact that he has gone and that his relative is in the process of falling.\n\nThey say they want to protest against America's long term intentions that they want to protest against. They believe this isn't the action of a liberator. They see this as a conquest of Iraq.\n\nMosul :: John Simpson :: 1327GMT\n\nThe situation in Mosul continues to be extremely tense, particularly between the Kurdish and Arab populations of the city.\n\nA cloud of acrid smoke is hanging over the city and on the roads all the shops are closed for fear of rioting. Burnt-out vehicles litter the side streets.\n\nThe uprising here has gone very badly wrong.\n\nIt was planned by one of the leading Kurdish figures in the city, in close conjunction with a leading figure on the Arab side, but they'd understood that the Americans would come in quickly.\n\nWhen that didn't happen the widespread looting and disorder began. Now there's still only a total of two hundred American troops in Mosul and they've had to retreat to the civil airport after being fiercely attacked.\n\nEverywhere you go in this city people ask you where the Americans are. The alliance between Arabs and Kurds has broken down for the time being and there has been shooting between the two groups.\n\nThe dangers of all this for the future of Iraq are obvious and as night comes on people here are getting extremely nervous about the prospect of greater violence.\n\nKut, central Iraq :: David Loyn :: 1321GMT\n\nUS Marines set out this morning with intelligence that there were several hundred Arab suicide fighters holed up in Kut. The Marines set out apprehensive and heavy-handed, going in and expecting a fight. As it turned out those fighters had gone and Kut is now in American hands.\n\nIt's a very significant development because it means that the road between Basra and Baghdad on this eastern route is now effectively open.\n\nWe still don't know what has happened to the Arab fighters, if indeed they ever existed.\n\nThe Americans have been greeted with pretty open arms. There is some jubilation from crowds in the streets.\n\nBut there's already signs of some looting here and this is evidently going to be a problem in the coming days.\n\nAnkara :: Jonny Dymond :: 1220GMT\n\nThe Turkish interest in northern Iraq has relaxed from a position of extreme concern to that of grave concern.\n\nThe entry of US forces to the town of Kirkuk and the exit of Kurdish forces from that town and the presence of Turkish military observers in the city has eased the situation considerably.\n\nTurkey will go back to watching the situation very wearily but with perhaps less of an extreme concern that it had yesterday.\n\nBaghdad :: Caroline Hawley :: 1212GMT\n\nOrdinary people are getting increasingly angry about the continued anarchy here. They say it shouldn't be allowed to happen. It feels like the fall of the regime has left a very dangerous vacuum.\n\nPeople here really want the Americans and British to step in and fill it. They have begun to do that. They are calling for people to show up for duty - people who could restore the water treatment systems, the electricity and the police.\n\nWe're not sure how many have shown up but there is a major catch - the Americans are asking people to volunteer to do this. There is no system to pay them.\n\nParliament Square, London :: Angus Crawford :: 1128GMT\n\nIn February, as many as two million people took to the streets to protest against war in Iraq. A month later that number fell to about 250,000.\n\nToday organisers predicted more than 100,000 but the start of the march has been delayed because too few people have arrived.\n\nParliament Square, where a two minute silence is meant to take place, has been very quiet.\n\nDemonstrators have now started filing into the square. Police say it's too early to predict accurate numbers though it may well turn out to be in the low thousands.\n\nBaghdad :: Paul Wood :: 1128GMT\n\nEver since the US forces arrived as liberators, Baghdad has slipped deeper into anarchy. At one hospital the BBC interviewed a doctor in a surgical mask and gown and carrying a Kalashnikov.\n\nHe said he had had to fight off looters who were coming like rats.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross says it is extremely alarmed at a situation where Baghdad's medical services are in a state of near collapse.\n\nThere was also a lengthy gun battle near the capital's main museum this morning. Archaeological treasures from the dawn of civilisation lay broken in pieces.\n\nPeople hadn't even bothered to steal much of what was there, only to destroy.\n\nBBC Monitoring Service :: John Andrew :: 1045GMT\n\nThe Syrian news bulletins have this morning highlighted the difference between the British attitude towards Syria - trying to build relations - and the Americans who have been very tough and giving warnings to Syria.\n\nThey highlighted a call that Jack Straw made to the Syrian foreign minister earlier this week in which he said he didn't back the accusations by some US officials.\n\nThis was before President Bush warned against Syria offering a \"safe haven\" to fleeing Iraqis.\n\nOne Israeli newspaper has quoted US sources, saying that Damascus is now \"crawling with fleeing Iraqis\".\n\nGerman newspaper Die Welt has warned the Americans against sizing up Syria as its next target, adding that it would signal the end of the transatlantic alliance and Germany's withdrawal from Nato.\n\nBaghdad :: Caroline Hawley :: 1039GMT\n\nLooting has continued in Baghdad as American forces appeal for Iraqi policemen and civil service workers to restore order and services to the city.\n\nSeveral former police officers have already stepped forward. But a spokesman for the Marines said they would be working as volunteers - he didn't know if or when they would be paid.\n\nThe fall of the regime has left a dangerous vacuum here, with looting still going on in many parts of the city. The Iraqi National Museum has been ransacked, display cases broken, priceless historical treasures lost.\n\nUS Central Command, Qatar :: Jonathan Marcus :: 1027GMT\n\nThe Americans are well aware of the security problems in Baghdad. They still seem to be saying that it's a matter of time.\n\nThey stress that the Iraqi capital, as many other parts of the country, remain a war zone. They're still in what they call a combat situation. There are still fire fights taking place.\n\nBut they are saying they are trying to \"deconflict combat operations from civilian activities\".\n\nIn plain English that means they're trying to identify areas where there's less threat where they are trying to adopt a different posture.\n\nThe fact remains that there are serious problems and the media attention is focusing their minds on trying to do a little more to bring about normality.\n\nAmman, Jordan :: Richard Galpin :: 1003GMT\n\nThe United Nations has announced it is to re-establish its presence inside Iraq for the first time since the war began more than three weeks ago.\n\nThe announcement was made by the senior UN official responsible for coordinating humanitarian assistance for Iraq.\n\nRamiro Lopez de Silva, who is currently visiting Jordan, said he expected small teams of international staff to return to the Kurdish areas of northern Iraq on Monday.\n\nAnother team will cross the Iranian border into eastern Iraq to assess the needs of a large group of people sheltering in the area after fleeing their homes.\n\nIt's also hoped a permanent UN presence will soon be set up in the south.\n\nAnkara :: Jonny Dymond :: 0951GMT\n\nKirkuk was a always a flashpoint for Turkey. It was a city both with a symbolic significance and a practical significance.\n\nIt's symbolic because it's claimed not only by the Kurds but by the Turkmen, who are championed by Turkey.\n\nAnd it has practical significance because of the vast oil fields that surround the city. It's the third largest oil field in Iraq.\n\nWhen Kurdish fighters went in and took control there was enormous alarm in Turkey. There was much talk of troop movements\n\nNow Kurdish fighters have been seen coming out and Turkish monitors are on the ground, I think Turkey is now acknowledging the work being done and it won't be sending troops.\n\nThe politicians are trying to calm the situation down. At the same time, of course, those troops remain on standby on the Turkey-northern Iraq border.\n\nUS Central Command, Qatar :: Paul Adams :: 0910GMT\n\nThe relationship between the Kurds and the Americans is sufficiently close. There's been an enormous amount of political coordination also involving turkey.\n\nUltimately even though Turkey was concerned that the Kurds jumped the gun at Kirkuk, the situation will be resolved, the Kurds will return to the places they came from and the situation will be stable.\n\nBaghdad :: Paul Wood :: 0816GMT\n\nWe're able to go a little way in and around the city. We have some freedom of movement although there are checkpoints in a lot of places and there are gun battles.\n\nWe have seen the Marines standing by as people carry off armfuls of stolen goods. And the Marines will tell you these are not their orders and that they're here as a fighting force, not a police force.\n\nThey simply don't have the boots on the ground to intervene. They've set up a civil-military coordination centre asking former policemen of the regime to come back.\n\nI can give you an idea of the dangers of that. I was introduced to a police general who said he was just in charge of traffic and was coming back to help the Americans.\n\nOthers have identified him as somebody they claimed was responsible for some of the excesses that went on under Saddam. Of course, we don't know if that is the case.\n\nWashington D.C. :: Andrew Walker :: 0713GMT\n\nThe diplomatic tension in the run-up to the war may well be reflected in the G7 finance ministers' meeting.\n\nThe US Treasury Secretary John Snow, who hosts the session, said the IMF and World Bank should start giving technical assistance to Iraq as soon as possible. He also said the discussions should include Iraq's foreign debt. Both could be difficult issues.\n\nThe World Bank's President James Wolfensohn has said that the bank's position is complicated by the United Nations' sanctions against Iraq and he wants explicit approval from the bank's member countries before he gets involved.\n\nAnother bank official has said that even going to Baghdad and paying a hotel bill there could be construed as a violation of the sanctions.\n\nUS Central Command, Qatar :: Jonathan Marcus :: 0651GMT\n\nIf there is a weakness in the US war plan it could now be becoming apparent, during this untidy period between peace and war.\n\nMore troops are badly needed. Military police for example might be a stopgap measure, but most of the reinforcements rolling in at the moment are heavy combat units.\n\nSaddam City, Baghdad :: Andrew North :: 0605GMT\n\nIt is a near impossible task for the marines with the numbers they currently have in this volatile area of Baghdad.\n\nThere are more than a million people here and during the day when they patrol, any Fedayeen simply melt away into the backstreets. All the marines see is friendly people waving and shouting.\n\nAll morning they have been searching for a suspected cache of weapons, but every lead proves a dead end, but at night-time this area is like a scene from a wild west film, with the rattle of machine-gun fire going on for hours.\n\nIstanbul :: Jonny Dymond :: 0510GMT\n\nKirkuk was always a flashpoint and when it fell to Kurdish forces Turkey was swift to demand that they withdrew.\n\nTurkey is not prepared to allow the Kurds to take control of a region which might make a Kurdish state economically viable and it also wants to protect the claims of the Turkmen ethnic group, which it champions.\n\nThe Kurdish withdrawal will ease tensions, but Turkey still has tens of thousands of troops on its border with Iraq.\n\nIt is those troops that give it a strong negotiating position. There's no sign that they're being stood down.\n\nKirkuk, northern Iraq :: Dumeetha Luthra :: 0500GMT\n\nKurdish troops have begun pulling out of Kirkuk. They have been under pressure to withdraw after Turkey threatened to send its own troops across the border.\n\nThe Kurds' arrival two days ago caused a political storm. Thousands flooded in as the Iraqi army withdrew. Turkey responded with threats of military force.\n\nIt is concerned that control of the oil rich city would give economic independence to the Kurds and spark separatist aspirations in its own large Kurdish population.\n\nKurdish officials have promised that all the Kurdish soldier will withdraw as more US troops move into the city.\n\nUS Central Command, Qatar :: Malcolm Brabant :: 0445GMT\n\nSoldiers from the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards were on patrol in Basra when they spotted a bank robbery in progress. The looters opened fire on the patrol and one soldier was shot in the stomach.\n\nThe dragoon guards returned fire killing five of the robbers. A British forces spokeswoman at Central Command in Doha said they had a robust response to looting. The spokeswoman said once word of the deaths spread she was sure it would have a deterrent effect although it wasn't done for that reason and she insisted British troops did not fire upon unarmed looters.\n\nReporters with the US and British military are restricted in what they can say about precise locations or military plans."
