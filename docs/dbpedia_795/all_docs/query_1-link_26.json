        "text": "The diplomatic struggle over the Arab League’s peace proposal for Syria has nearly obscured an important detail of the plan: President Bashar al-Assad would be replaced in a transition by a loyal disciple.\n\nUnder the proposal, Mr. Assad’s vice president and former foreign minister, Farouk al-Shara, who was a confidant of Mr. Assad’s father and has survived Syria’s backstabbing politics for three decades, would almost certainly be the temporary president of Syria.\n\nMr. Shara, 74, a fluent English speaker and member of Syria’s Sunni majority, is known for his calm demeanor, sense of authoritarian hierarchy and unquestioned loyalty to the Assad family, who are members of Syria’s powerful Alawite minority.\n\nRumors abounded last year that Mr. Shara had been shot because he might have questioned his boss’s judgment in crushing a protest in Mr. Shara’s birthplace, Dara, the combustible town where the uprising against Mr. Assad began in March. Those rumors, like many in Syria’s chaotic uprising, turned out to be false.\n\n“He is a man of the regime, without any doubts,” said Nadim Shehadi, an associate fellow of the Middle East Program at Chatham House, a London-based research group. “The Dara roots do not mean in any way that he’s more likely to be a dissident or anything like that.”\n\nIt is by no means clear that Mr. Assad will agree to the Arab League proposal, currently under debate at the United Nations Security Council, where Russia — Mr. Assad’s strongest foreign ally — rejected a tentative plan on Friday to endorse it. Russia, however, held out the possibility of further negotiations.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
