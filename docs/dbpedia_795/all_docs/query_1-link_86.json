        "text": "In response to the Government of Syria's escalation of violence against the people of Syria, on May 18, 2011, President Obama signed an Executive Order blocking the property of seven members of Syria's top leadership, including Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, for human rights abuses. [1] This Order closely follows Executive Order 13572 of April 29, 2011, that blocked the property of five designated persons (including President al- Assads' brother, Mahir al-Asad) identified to have committed human rights abuses in Syria. [2]\n\nSpecifically, the May 18, 2011 Order blocks all property and interests in property within the jurisdiction of the United States of the following individuals, each of whom is identified as responsible for the violent crackdown against protestors:\n\nBashar Al-Assad: President of the Syrian Arab Republic\n\nFarouk Al-Shara: Vice President\n\nAdel Safar: Prime Minister\n\nMohammad Ibrahim Al-Shaar: Minister of the Interior\n\nAli Habib Mahmoud: Minister of Defense\n\nAbdul Fatad Qudsiya: Head of Syrian Military Intelligence\n\nMohammed Dib Zaitoun: Director of Political Security Directorate\n\nConsistent with prior guidance [3] from the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Order should be treated as also blocking the property of entities owned or controlled by these persons.\n\nPossible European Union Sanctions\n\nWhile the European Union has discussed possible sanctions against President Assad, EU officials do not anticipate making a decision on this issue until next week. [4]\n\nThis article was co-authored by John B. Reynolds, III and Cari N. Stinebower.\n\n[1] See http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/syria_eo_05182011.pdf.\n\n[2] See Wiley Rein's \"New List-Based Sanctions on Syria\" (April 29, 2011), http://www.wileyrein.com/publications.cfm?sp=articles&id=7035.\n\n[3] See OFAC Guidance on Entities Owned by Persons Whose Property or Interest in Property is Blocked, (February 14, 2008), http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Documents/licensing_guidance.pdf.\n\n[4] See EU to discuss Assad sanctions next week: diplomats, EU Business (May 17, 2011)\n\nYour Privacy\n\nWhen you visit our website, we use cookies on your browser to collect information.
