        "text": "— Thousands of people were fleeing Damascus and heading into Lebanon on Friday, according to the U.N. refugee agency, as rebels described the country’s bloodiest fighting in the 17-month uprising.\n\nThe two-day death toll was reported to be more than 470 people.\n\nBetween 8,500 and 30,000 Syrians have crossed into Lebanon in the past 48 hours, an agency spokesman, Melissa Fleming, said at a news briefing in Geneva. The new flood added to an exodus of more than 112,000 who had already registered as refugees in Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq and Jordan, and many thousands more who have fled but not registered.\n\nU.N. relief agencies have said three-quarters of them are women and children, often arriving in a desperate state with no more than the clothes they are wearing. Internally, as many as 1 million people have been displaced, according to the Syrian Arab Red Crescent.\n\nThe government forces in Damascus, the Syrian capital, claimed Friday to have retaken a pocket of the city a day after rebel fighters, building on the momentum gained by their assassination of top security officials, seized all four border crossings with Iraq and one into Turkey.\n\nSyrian state television reported that a fourth member of President Bashar Assad’s elite circle, Hisham Ikhtiar, the head of general security, had died of wounds suffered in Wednesday’s rebel bombing at a security headquarters buildings.\n\nThe attack also killed Assef Shawkat, who was the president’s brother-in-law and a senior security official; the defense minister, Gen. Dawoud Rajha; and Maj. Gen. Hassan Turkmani, a former defense minister. Maher Assad, Assad’s brother who commands the praetorian guard protecting the family, and Vice President Farouk al-Sharaa were said to have presided over a ceremony honoring the victims.The public funeral for the first three victims was held Friday in a military ceremony on Qassioun Mountain, overlooking Damascus, according to state television.\n\nSyrian state media and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which is based in Britain, said government forces, fighting back with a superior military machine pitted against an opposition still working predominantly with small-caliber weapons, had retaken a section of the Midan neighborhood Friday.\n\nMore than 170 people were killed across Syria on Friday, including about 50 in Damascus, the Observatory said, pushing the death toll for the past two days to more than 470.\n\nThe death toll could not be independently verified. The Syrian government bars most media from working in the country.\n\nClaiming victory in Midan, Syrian state television declared: “Our brave army forces have completely cleaned the area of Midan in Damascus of the remaining mercenary terrorists and have re-established security.” Rebels said they had staged a “tactical withdrawal” from Midan to avert civilian casualties.\n\nConditions across Damascus were growing more difficult, Fleming said, with shops running out of supplies and closing. She said relief agency workers were hearing that state and private banks have run out of funds.\n\n“Many Syrians in general are running low on resources and increasingly turning to the Syrian Arab Red Crescent and other organizations for help,” she added.\n\nFleming said among the most vulnerable were about 8,000 refugees from other countries, mainly Iraq, who have fled homes in the Damascus suburb of Seida Zeinab in the face of the fighting and violent threats targeting them. At least 2,000 more foreigners, along with many Syrians, fled their homes to take shelter in parks and schools in the suburb of Jaramana, she said.\n\nFleming said the refugee agency had been informed of a family of seven Iraqis killed in their home last week in Damascus. She also said frightened Iraqi refugees had been calling the refugee agency to report threatening phone calls, some accusing them of siding with the government.\n\nRelief workers also said some Iraqis have received calls accusing them of being Shiite Muslims. Sunnis are the majority in Syria and form the backbone of the uprising against the government.\n\nIraqi authorities, responding to the crisis, have been seeking to evacuate their citizens, sending two aircraft to Syria on Thursday and 80 buses in recent days, according to relief agency workers, who said Iraq was preparing to send two more aircraft in the next few days.\n\nBaghdad’s prime minister called for the U.N. to help protect the refugees and get them home.\n\n“What the innocent Iraqis are subjected to - killings and looting - is similar to what was done by the terrorist groups that harmed Iraq’s security during the past years,” said a statement from Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki late Friday.\n\n“We urge the United Nations for immediate intervention and cooperation with the Syrian authorities in order to protect the Iraqis and facilitate their return to their homeland,” the statement said, without giving further details on what the U.N. should do.\n\nIn Jordan, where the United Nations has already registered more than 30,000 Syrian refugees, authorities are building a camp capable of taking in 115,000 people, Fleming said.\n\nSyria’s unrest began in March 2011 when protests calling for political change met a violent government crackdown. Many in the opposition have since taken up arms as the conflict has morphed into a civil war that activists say has killed more than 17,000 people. The government says more than 4,000 security officers have been killed.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council voted Friday to extend the mission of some 300 international observers in Syria for 30 days. The observers, sent to oversee a ceasefire that has never taken hold, have been largely confined to their hotels in recent weeks. On Thursday, Russia and China vetoed a resolution backed by key Western nations that threatened new sanctions on Assad’s regime.\n\nThe council voted shortly after Russia’s ambassador to France, Alexander Orlov, said he believed Assad was ready to step down “in a civilized way.” The Syrian government immediately denied it, and the Russian Foreign Ministry said the ambassador’s statements were “wrongly interpreted.”\n\nThe U.N. suspended the observers’ patrols and most of their other activities on June 16 because of increased violence, and its mandate had been set to expire Friday.\n\nWith the divided Security Council unable to adopt a resolution threatening sanctions, the U.S. and European Union are pressing to enforce their own.\n\nThe EU announced Friday that it will enforce an arms embargo against Syria by boarding ships and aircraft on EU territory or in its waters suspected of carrying suspicious cargo to the war-torn nation. It said the boardings would start after expected approval by EU foreign ministers Monday.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Neil MacFarquhar, Nick Cumming-Bruce, Tim Arango, Alan Cowell, Yasir Ghazi, Rick Gladstone, Dalal Mawad, Hwaida Saad, Scott Sayare, Eric Schmitt and a staff member of The New York Times; and by Ben Hubbard, Zeina Karam, Albert Aji, Edith M.
