        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\nThe Washington Quarterly 23.2 (2000) 79-90\n\n[Access article in PDF]\n\nClues to the Syrian Puzzle\n\nEyal Zisser\n\nNow that even Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak has sung the praises of Syrian president Hafiz al-Asad, there can be no doubt that he is widely regarded as one of the Middle East's most prominent leaders. The fact that he has been able to keep his grip on the reins of power for three decades has led many to view him as one of the more talented and successful leaders in the region. Among the factors that contribute in creating this positive image has been Syria's emergence, under his leadership, from a weak and unviable country to one which projects strength and has perhaps become a regional power determined to exert its influence, if not hegemony, over the entire region. 1\n\nWritings about Asad and his regime usually describe the Syrian ruler as a brilliant politician. 2 Asad is actually a cautious, balanced, and calculating man. As a leader he is slow to act and tends to be passive in his moves and reactions. This hesitance and passivity, however, may in retrospect have turned out to his advantage, since they have helped him stay out of trouble. 3\n\nAsad is also a predictable leader. He tends to prefer maintaining the status quo to change or upheaval. Despite this, during the 1990s Asad succeeded in surprising two U.S. secretaries of state. One of these surprises came in the summer of 1991, when he told James Baker that he was prepared to participate in the Madrid Conference, thus joining the peace process initiated by the United States at the end of the Persian Gulf War. 4 The other was in December 1999, when Asad told Madeleine Albright that he was prepared to renew Israeli-Syrian peace negotiations. [End Page 79]\n\nIndeed, the renewed negotiations at a high level between Barak and Syrian foreign minister Farouk al-Shara, a senior Syrian leader close to Asad, greatly surprised observers of events in Syria. This move was seen as a significant step and even as an indication of greater readiness and political will than before to settle Syria's conflict with Israel. 5\n\nAsad's choice to renew negotiations with Israel in December 1999 is widely believed to have arisen from Barak's decision to withdraw Israel's military forces from South Lebanon by July 2000. That move might have deprived Asad of an important bargaining chip in negotiations with Israel. Asad risked losing his ability to apply pressure on Israel through his ally, the Hizballah in southern Lebanon. It is also thought that Asad's readiness to renew negotiations stemmed from his desire to take advantage of U.S. president Bill Clinton's final year in office and the president's manifest desire to leave a legacy of peace in the Middle East. 6 Whatever the case may be, the many motives that may have motivated Asad to renew negotiations with Israel--and the ultimate fate of these renewed peace negotiations--cannot be understood without understanding the domestic situation in Syria.\n\nTwo major issues are now on the Syrian domestic agenda: the question of succession following Asad's inevitable departure from the political scene and the challenge of globalization. In order to understand why Asad has chosen the road of peace, it is imperative to explore these two domestic issues.\n\nThe Ruler's Health and the Stability of the Regime"
