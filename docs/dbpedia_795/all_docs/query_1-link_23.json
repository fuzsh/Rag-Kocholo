        "text": "Pope Francis on August 25 condemned the latest action by Kyiv to ban religious organizations with ties to the Russian Orthodox Church from operating in Ukraine.\n\n\"No Christian church may be abolished directly or indirectly. The churches must not be touched,\" the pope said during his weekly prayer a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy signed legislation prohibiting the activities of the Russian-linked Ukrainian Orthodox Church in Ukraine.\n\n\"In thinking of the law recently adopted in Ukraine, I fear for the liberty of those who pray,\" Francis said on St. Peter's Square.\n\nHe told the gathered crowd that \"one does not commit evil by praying. If someone does something evil to his people, he is guilty. But he can't have done anything bad by praying.\"\n\nIn signing the legislation on August 24, Zelenskiy underscored what he called the spiritual independence of the Ukrainian people, saying that the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU) \"today is taking a step toward liberation from Moscow devils.\"\n\nThe OCU, which is aligned with Kyiv, was granted independence from the Moscow Patriarchate by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople in 2019, the leading voice in the Orthodox world.\n\nThe Russian-linked Ukrainian Orthodox Church declared it severed all ties with the Moscow Patriarchate in 2023 due to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. However, the Ukrainian authorities accuse it of maintaining ties.\n\nPatriarch Kirill, head of the Russian Orthodox Church, is a vocal supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin and of the war against Ukraine.\n\nThe adoption of the law, which was passed by parliament earlier this month, is considered a watershed moment in Ukraine, where Orthodox Christianity has been riven for decades in large part over the influence of the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nThe law is to go into effect 30 days after its publication.\n\nUkrainian authorities have sought to curtail activities of the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine since Russian-linked forces seized parts of the country in 2014, claiming the church has supported Moscow's war of aggression.\n\nThe pope also said he continues to follow \"with sorrow\" the fighting in Ukraine.\n\nWith reporting by RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service, AFP, and dpa\n\nIsrael and Hizballah, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, engaged in a massive exchange of missile fire on August 25, but signaled they were not looking to escalate the conflict amid fears of all-out war in the region.\n\nIn one of the biggest clashes to rock the Middle East since war broke out in the Gaza Strip last October, Israel said it launched preemptive air strikes on targets of Iran-backed Hizballah in southern Lebanon after Israeli intelligence detected that Hizballah was planning to attack in the morning.\n\nHizballah leader Hassan Nasrallah said in a speech later in the day that the attacks, which did not include using precision or strategic missiles, targeted \"the Glilot base -- the main Israeli military intelligence base,\" near Tel Aviv, about 100 kilometers across the southern Lebanese border with Israel.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:00:50 0:00\n\nNasrallah added in the televised speech that Israel began striking Hizballah targets about 30 minutes before the group launched its attack, which was in response to the killing of one of its commanders.\n\nAddressing Nasrallah and Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's preemptive operation was \"another step toward changing the situation in the north and returning our residents safely to their homes.\"\n\nThousands have been displaced in northern Israel as Hizballah and Israel continue to trade cross-border attacks, which have intensified since war broke out in Gaza following an October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas -- an Iran-backed group designated as a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union -- that left some 1,200 people dead and scores more taken hostage.\n\nThe August 25 exchange of hundreds of missiles and drones sparked fears that the war may escalate and engulf the entire region, but a Hizballah official said in a written statement to media outlets that the group had \"worked\" to ensure its attack would not trigger a full-scale war.\n\nReuters quoted its diplomatic sources as saying Israel and Hizballah exchanged messages following the exchange saying neither wanted to escalate the conflict further.\n\nRanda Slim, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Middle East Institute, said that at least for now, the scope of the strikes from both sides may be enough to avoid a major war between Israel and Hizballah \"because both sides do not want it.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said around 100 fighter jets \"eliminated thousands of Hizballah rocket-launcher barrels\" that had been \"aimed for immediate fire\" toward northern and central Israel.\n\nHizballah said the attack was \"phase one\" of its retaliation for the killing of its top commander Fuad Shukr in an Israeli strike on July 30 in Beirut. It insisted the operation had been \"completed successfully.\"\n\nDefense Minister Yoav Gallant declared a 48-hour state of emergency across Israel.\n\nThe IDF said Hizballah had fired 150 projectiles, but Hizballah claimed to have launched more than 320 Katyusha rockets.\n\nIsraeli fighter jets continued to strike Hizballah rocket launchers after the group's attack to \"remove threats.\"\n\nThree people were killed in areas in southern Lebanon, according to the country's Health Ministry.\n\nThe extent of damage caused by Hizballah's attack is unclear. Video footage on social media showed some rockets being intercepted and the aftermath of several rockets making impact.\n\nThe Office of the United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon called the developments \"worrying\" and called \"on all to cease fire and refrain from further escalatory action.\"\n\n\"We will continue our contacts to strongly urge for de-escalation,\" it said.\n\nHizballah and Israel have inched even closer to a full-blown war for weeks, especially after the death of 12 people in an apparent Hizballah rocket attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on July 27.\n\nThree days later, Israel struck a target in Beirut, killing Shukr, who was widely believed to be the second-most powerful person in Hizballah's hierarchy behind Nasrallah.\n\nDiplomats, meanwhile, huddled in Egypt on August 25 for high-level talks aimed at brokering a cease-fire in the 10-month-old war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas.\n\nIsrael's attack on Gaza has killed more than 40,000 people, according to the local Hamas-run health authorities.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters\n\nSix people were killed in Ukrainian attacks in the Russian border region of Belgorod, local officials said on August 25, as Ukrainian authorities reported that several people -- including a Western journalist -- were killed and wounded in Russian strikes across the country.\n\nIn Russia, Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram that five civilians were killed and 12 others were wounded in Ukrainian shelling in the town of Rakitnoye. One person was killed in a Ukrainian drone attack on the village of Solovyovka, he added.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians.

It did not specify how many missiles were destroyed.\n\nThe air-defense systems shot down eight of the nine drones launched by Russian forces overnight over the Mykolayiv region, the air force claimed.\n\nOn the diplomatic front, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on August 25 said talks with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey, and Switzerland were continuing regarding a potential second peace summit.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader also said he had told Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his recent visit to Kyiv that he would support India hosting the summit.\n\n\"This applies not only to India but to any state that would be positive about hosting a second summit,” Zelenskiy added.\n\nSome 80 countries, but not Russia, met in Switzerland in mid-June to discuss the potential for a peace agreement between Moscow and Kyiv.\n\nZelenskiy has insisted Ukraine's territorial integrity must be the foundation of any peace deal, while Russia has said conditions for ending the war include Kyiv renouncing its desire to join NATO and ceding Crimea and four other occupied regions of Ukraine.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters, AFP, and AP\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has signed into law legislation banning religious organizations linked to the Russian Orthodox Church from operating in Ukraine.\n\nThe move was announced on the parliament’s website on August 24 as Ukraine celebrated its Independence Day.\n\nZelenskiy commented on his signing the law, one of several pieces of legislation targeting Russia that he signed on August 24, during a recorded video address to the nation.\n\nThe Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU) is \"today taking a step toward liberation from Moscow's devils,\" Zelenskiy said.\n\nThe OCU, which is aligned with Kyiv, was granted independence from the Moscow Patriarchate by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople in 2019, the leading voice in the Orthodox world.\n\nThe Russian-linked Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) declared it severed all ties with the Moscow Patriarchate in 2023 due to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Some senior UOC figures have been sanctioned by presidential decrees, including the abbot of Kyiv's ancient Monastery of the Caves, Metropolitan Pavlo.\n\nIn June, Ukraine handed over Metropolitan Ionafan -- a UOC diocese head who was sentenced to five years in prison after being convicted of supporting the Russian invasion -- to Russia in a prisoner swap. He was received with honors by Patriarch Kirill.\n\nA May 2024 survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found that about 82 percent of respondents said they do not trust the UOC, and 63 percent said it should be banned entirely.\n\nThe law signed by Zelenskiy on August 24 is to go into effect 30 days after its publication. Among other things it stipulates that the Russian Orthodox Church cannot be the owner or participant of legal entities registered in Ukraine. Religious communities in Ukraine will have nine months to break ties with Russian-linked entities.\n\nThe UOC has said it has no administrative ties with foreign religious organizations.\n\nPatriarch Kirill on August 24 responded to the law by calling on other Christian religious leaders and international organizations to “raise their voices in defense of persecuted believers.”\n\nAlso on August 24, Ukraine ratified a statute that paves the way for Ukraine to join the International Criminal Court, which has issued arrest warrants for several Russian officials including President Vladimir Putin over war crimes against Ukrainian civilians.\n\nZelenskiy also signed a law that allows foreigner who fight in the Ukrainian Army against Russia the right to gain Ukrainian citizenship.\n\nVARNA, Bulgaria -- Teachers in Bulgaria say they are facing threats for signing a petition opposing recently passed legislation banning “LGBT propaganda” in schools and point the finger of blame at the far-right Revival party, initiator of the widely criticized controversial law.\n\nThe leader of Revival, Kostadin Kostadinov, said on August 22 that he would file a report with the Prosecutor’s Office about educators who have voiced opposition to the law.\n\nThe law, passed on August 7 in parliament with the backing of pro-European parties, sparked protests in Sofia and elsewhere in the largely conservative Balkan country of some 6.5 million people.\n\nThe amendment to the country's education code prohibits the \"propaganda, promotion, or incitement\" of LGBT \"ideas and views\" in schools, without specifying further details.\n\nThe pro-Western reformist We Continue the Change-Democratic Bulgaria (PP-DB) coalition is still hoping to gather support in the National Assembly, Bulgaria's unicameral parliament, to repeal the legislation.\n\n​Critics said the law is nearly identical to the Russian anti-LGBT propaganda law adopted in 2012 and the Hungarian anti-LGBT propaganda law adopted in 2021, both of which have been deemed by various international stakeholders and institutions as incompatible with international and European human rights standards.\n\nBulgaria is one of the few countries in the European Union that does not give equal civil rights to people of differing sexual orientations. Last year, the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg obliged Bulgaria to create a legal framework to recognize same-sex relationships, an obligation with which Sofia has not yet complied.\n\nThe LGBT community and supporters in Bulgaria often face verbal as well as physical threats and attack, including the 2021 targeting of an LGBT center in Sofia.\n\nSome 460 teachers and other specialists in the educational field signed a petition to demand the amended law to be scrapped. About 20 from the Black Sea resort of Varna said they were targeted by the local branch of the Revival party, including on Facebook.\n\nMartin Stoyanov, a school psychologist in Varna, said a teacher in the Black Sea town had contacted him late one night recently on Viber, expressing fears over the recent threats.\n\n\"At some point we're becoming a country where it's dangerous to express your opinion,\" Stoyanov told RFE/RL’s Bulgarian Service.\n\nThe Facebook post on August 21 on the account linked to the Varna branch of the Revival party included what it termed a \"black list\" of local educators who had signed the petition -- including Stoyanov -- against the newly amended law, referring to them as \"parasites.\"\n\nA day later, Kostadinov, long a controversial figure and spreader of pro-Kremlin disinformation, said he would hand over to the Prosecutor's Office the names of some 800 teachers he claimed were \"criminals\" who \"want to push homosexual propaganda.\"\n\nThe threatened teachers in Varna have received much support.\n\nThe mayor of Varna, Blagomir Kotsev, voiced his support in a Facebook post on August 22, urging them to be brave and to personally contact him if they are threatened.\n\nPavel Popov, Varna’s deputy mayor who is also in charge of educational matters, told RFE/RL that Revival was calling for \"repressive actions against Bulgarian teachers.\"\n\n\"Bulgarian teachers cannot be talked about in this way,\" said Stella Nikolova, a member of the National Assembly from Varna and a member of the PP-DB bloc in a Facebook post on August 22.\n\n\"We demand that all institutions take action to protect citizens' rights and to be held accountable for the fascist methods by which a political power operates,\" Nikolova wrote.\n\nThe Revival party did not respond to request by RFE/RL’s Bulgarian Service for comment.\n\nSeveral petitions have been launched condemning the vaguely worded changes to education code. One that garnered the signatures of nearly 460 teachers and educators was spearheaded by Boris Iliev, a teacher of Bulgarian literature and language at the National Science and Mathematics High School in Sofia.\n\n\"We have authentic arguments against the changes because our work depends on this law,\" Iliev told RFE/RL.\n\n\"When I saw the threats made against colleagues, I was extremely worried,\" Iliev added.\n\nDenislava Nikolaeva said she was shocked when the name of her son’s teacher appeared on the Revival posting.\n\n\"We are collapsing as a society,\" Denislava told RFE/RL.\n\nAs Ukraine marks 33 years of independence on August 24, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has announced that 115 Ukrainian prisoners were released in a swap with Russia.\n\n\"Another 115 of our defenders have returned home today. They are warriors from the National Guard, the Armed Forces, the Navy, and the State Border Guard Service,\" Zelenskiy said in a message on X.\n\n\"We remember everyone. We are searching for them and making every effort to bring them all back,\" he said.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians.

They took us to the office and gave us our uniforms to put them on. Then they took us somewhere in cars,\" Ihor said. \"No one told us whether that was a simple transfer to another prison or a prisoner swap. We arrived at an air base and were put on a plane. The plane arrived at another air base. More than 100 of us gathered there. Only then we understood that this was a prisoner swap.\"\n\nAndriy, another freed soldier who gave only his first name, said he served in the same National Guard unit.\n\n\"I kept dreaming about it all the time in captivity -- that I'll be back on August 24,\" said Andriy, who struggled to answer in Ukrainian because he had become accustomed to speaking Russian while in captivity. \"It's a feeling beyond description.\"\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:01:34 0:00\n\nZelenskiy, referring to Russian troops who have been taken prisoner during Ukraine's ongoing incursion into Russia's Kursk region that started on August 6, said in his post on X that \"I am grateful to each unit that replenishes our exchange fund.”\n\nUkraine previously said that Russian soldiers taken prisoner in Kursk would be used as an \"exchange fund\" to release Ukrainian troops from Russian captivity.\n\nSeparately, Russia's Defense Ministry said it received 115 of its own troops, who had been captured in the Kursk region, in exchange for the same number of Ukrainian war prisoners.\n\nIt said the prisoner exchange was mediated by the United Arab Emirates.\n\nZelenskiy also highlighted the heroic resistance of his people in the face of Russia's unprovoked invasion in remarks dedicated to Ukraine's Independence Day on August 24 -- a day that also marked the somber milestone of 30 months of war.\n\n\"Independence is in every one of us. And united, we can win.... We withstood, restrained, and repulsed the enemy, and now we are pushing it in its swamps. We know what independence is, how difficult it is to revive it, how difficult it is to protect. But we also know that everything depends on us,\" he said.\n\nNo festivities or parades are scheduled, with many Ukrainians preferring to mark 33 years of independence by honoring those killed in the war.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:01:28 0:00\n\nUkraine says its incursion in Russia's border region of Kursk -- which took Moscow by surprise, shocked Russia's ruling elites, and brought more than 1,260 square kilometers and 92 settlements under its control -- is meant to establish a buffer zone that will put an end to Moscow's incessant shelling of Ukrainian civilian areas and infrastructure from across the border.\n\nUkraine's leadership has repeatedly clarified the move is not aimed at gaining territory, unlike Russia's full-scale invasion that started on February 24, 2022, exactly 2 1/2 years ago.\n\n\"There must be a strong border between us and the enemy, and no walls between Ukrainians, because Ukraine is in each and every one of us,\" Zelenskiy said in his message recorded symbolically in the northeastern border town of Sumy, close to where Ukrainian forces crossed into Russia on August 6.\n\n\"Those who sought to turn our lands into a buffer zone should now worry that their own country doesn't become a buffer federation,\" he said. \"This is how independence responds.\"\n\nZelenskiy also indirectly warned Russian President Vladimir Putin that his war was doomed to fail, saying that \"the sick grandfather from the Red Square...will not dictate his red lines to us.\"\n\n\"How we live, what path we follow, and what choices we make -- only Ukraine and Ukrainians will determine those for themselves. Because that's how independence works,\" he added.\n\nAs Ukraine's incursion into Kursk continues, Russia is pressing an offensive in Ukraine's eastern region of Donetsk aimed at capturing the regional hub of Pokrovsk.\n\nUkrainian soldiers fighting in the east celebrated Independence Day with guns in their hands. Some of them shared their thoughts about the meaning of independence with RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service.\n\nDenys, an officer with the 93rd Mechanized Brigade, said his generation bears a responsibility to preserve Ukraine's independence for their children's future.\n\n\"The cowardice of parents leads to their children's slavery.

He said there were no casualties.\n\nOstrogozhsk also houses a training center for armored vehicle operators.\n\nThe Belgorod region was also attacked by drones at night, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov reported, adding that two people were wounded.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said five drones were downed over Voronezh and one each over the Belgorod and Bryansk regions.\n\nRFE/RL's Ukrainian Service correspondent Roman Pahulych contributed to this report.\n\nThe United States on August 23 added nearly 400 individuals and entities in and outside of Russia to its sanctions list as part of the U.S. effort to disrupt Russia's international supply chains, metal procurement, and financial services that support its war effort in Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department said the move was building on sanctions already imposed on Russia in response to its full-scale war in Ukraine and were aimed at distinct networks, individuals, and entities whose products and services enable Russia to sustain the war and evade sanctions.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians.

The treasury's \"actions today continue to implement the commitments made by President [Joe] Biden and his G7 counterparts to disrupt Russia's military-industrial base supply chains and payment channels.\"\n\nThe sanctions target numerous transnational networks, the department said. Among them are those allegedly involved in procuring ammunition and military materiel for Russia, facilitating sanctions evasion for Russian oligarchs through offshore trust and corporate formation services, laundering gold for a sanctioned Russian gold company, and supporting Russia's military-industrial base by procuring sensitive and critical items such as advanced machinery tools and electronic components.\n\nThe list of companies designated for new sanctions includes 60 Russian-based defense and technology firms \"critical for the sustainment and development of Russia's defense industry,\" it added.\n\nAdeyemo added that companies, financial institutions, and governments around the world \"need to ensure they are not supporting Russia’s military-industrial supply chains.\"\n\nThe department warned that foreign regulators and financial institutions \"should be cautious\" about any dealings with overseas branches or subsidiaries of Russian financial institutions and noted it is is aware of Russian efforts \"to facilitate sanctions evasion by opening new overseas branches and subsidiaries of Russian financial institutions.\"\n\nThe sweeping action targets networks, individuals, and entities across 16 jurisdictions, including in China, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe measures against companies in China alone are aimed at 190 targets, according to a State Department fact sheet outlining its sanctions.\n\nWashington has repeatedly warned Beijing over its support for Russia's defense industrial base and has already issued hundreds of sanctions aimed at restricting Moscow's ability to exploit certain technologies for military purposes.\n\nThe sanctions, which freeze any assets held by those targeted in U.S. jurisdiction and bar them from dealings with people in the United States, were announced parallel to an announcement by the U.S. Commerce Department saying it was taking \"aggressive action\" to further restrict the supply of items made in the United States to both Russia and Belarus, due to \"the Kremlin's illegal war on Ukraine.\"\n\nIn addition, the U.S. State Department said it was targeting entities and individuals involved in Russia’s future energy, metals, and mining production as well as sanctions evasion and Russia’s military-industrial base. It also is targeting subsidiaries of Russia's state atomic energy corporation Rosatom and \"malign actors involved in the attempted, forcible 're-education' of Ukraine's children.\"\n\nThe U.S. government also added 123 entities to its U.S. export control list known as the Entity List that forces suppliers to obtain licenses before shipping to targeted companies. The companies -- 63 Russian and 42 Chinese as well as 18 from other countries -- were targeted for a host of reasons from sending U.S. electronics to Russian military-related parties to producing thousands of Shahed-136 drones for Russia to use in Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy thanked the United States for the \"additional strong sanctions\" saying on X they would further weaken Russia's ability to \"wage an aggressive war against Ukraine.\"\n\n\"Pressure on the aggressor must be maintained and increased constantly as long as Russia continues its aggression,\" Zelenskiy added.\n\nThe number of dead in the sinking of a migrant boat on the Drina River on the border between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia has risen to 11, including a 9-month-old baby.\n\nThe search for more bodies continued on August 23 after the 11th body was pulled from the river.

He indicated there were women and children in danger and said they were on a boat that sank with 25 people on board.\n\nZlatan Simic, commander of the local fire and rescue unit, said the search was still ongoing on August 23.\n\n\"We are on the water, starting the search from the point where the accident occurred, and the riverbed is being searched again in the hope that we will find the rest [of the victims],\" he said, adding that rescuers do not know the number of people who were on the boat.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:03:16 0:00\n\nThe survivors have been receiving humanitarian aid, said Nihad Suljic, a volunteer with the NGO SOS Balkan Route. Some will be admitted to a reception center in Sarajevo and then returned to Serbia.\n\nSuljic said children whose parents drowned were sent to a center in Belgrade.\n\nBosnian police said efforts are under way to identify and apprehend the smugglers responsible for the tragedy.\n\nSerbia lies on the so-called Balkan migration route to Western Europe. Migrants fleeing wars and poverty in Africa and the Middle East often fall prey to people smugglers who promise to illegally take them across borders in their quest to reach Western Europe.\n\nThe Russian National Guard said its snipers killed four hostage-takers when security forces stormed a prison in the southwestern region of Volgograd after knife-wielding prisoners reportedly launched a deadly attack on guards and held some staff hostage.\n\nThe Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) said in a statement that four prison guards died on August 23 after four inmates took eight guards and four other inmates hostage at the correctional colony No. 19 in the town of Surovikino in the Volgograd region.\n\n\"The perpetrators inflicted stabbing wounds of various types on four prison employees, three of whom died. The other four, who resisted, were hospitalized, and one of them died in hospital,\" the FSIN's statement said, adding that four other inmates also were wounded in the hostage-taking crisis.\n\nMedia reports as the incident began said several people died when the hostage-taking took place while a disciplinary commission was in the penitentiary.\n\nTelegram channels close to the penitentiary service issued a video showing four inmates who called themselves \"Islamic State fighters\" wielding knives and standing next to three bodies in FSIN uniforms and another uniformed person who was injured.\n\nOne Telegram channel identified the four inmates as two men from Uzbekistan and two from Tajikistan, three of whom are serving terms for illegal drugs and one for inflicting serious damage to a person’s health. That information has not been confirmed officially.\n\nIn another video, an inmate states that prison guards \"had violated Muslims' rights.\"\n\n\"We killed those who humiliated and tortured Muslims. They took away books from some of us, prayer rugs from some of us. So, we did the same to them. No mercy,\" the man in the video says.\n\nThe reports are likely to further exacerbate the xenophobic aftermath of the worst attack inside Russia since 2004, which left 145 people dead after gunmen stormed the Crocus City Hall concert venue outside Moscow on March 22. Ten Tajiks have thus far been arrested in Russia in connection with the attack claimed by the Islamic State group, including four accused of being the gunmen.\n\nThe Baza Telegram channel, which is close to law enforcement structures, reported that the prison’s warden Andrei Devyatov was hospitalized with wounds after he and four other hostages, including an inmate, managed to escape.\n\nIn another video, an inmate urges Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet the hostage-takers' demands and says he needs a doctor. Putin said in televised remarks that he had been briefed on the situation by the head of the FSIN.\n\nOne video shows four inmates standing next to a black banner with an Arabic inscription on it, chanting \"Allahu Akbar!\" (\"God is great!\"), while one of them holds a uniformed man.\n\nMedia reports say riot police units are deployed near the prison and the imam of the Volgograd region had arrived at the site to hold talks with the hostage-takers.\n\nThis is the second hostage-taking event in a Russian penitentiary this summer.\n\nIn June, several inmates took hostages at a detention center in the city of Rostov-on-Don. Russian officials said at the time that the hostage-takers were members of Islamic State. Five hostage-takers were killed and two hostages wounded during that crisis.\n\nAnother incident occurred in the mainly Muslim region of Daghestan, where at least 20 people were killed in shootings in two cities in the southern Russian area.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 23 again called for peace as he met with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy during a historic first visit to Kyiv as the war triggered by Russia's unprovoked full-scale invasion of Ukraine neared the two-and-a-half-year mark.\n\nModi, who arrived by train from Poland, sat down for talks with Zelenskiy after both men visited a memorial exhibition in Kyiv dedicated to the children killed during the war.\n\n\"We have stayed away from the war with great conviction. This does not mean that we were indifferent,\" Modi, seated alongside Zelenskiy, said in remarks to the media posted on his X account.\n\n\"From day one, we were not neutral. We have taken one side, and we stand firmly for peace.\"\n\nModi did not elaborate on his vision for a peaceful resolution of the war, which was started by Russia, traditionally India's ally.\n\nIndia came under fire from some Western countries after he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last month, which coincided with a deadly Russian missile attack on a children's hospital in Kyiv that elicited harsh international condemnation.\n\nThe United States was particularly concerned with Modi’s two-day visit to Russia as it sees New Delhi as an important pillar in its strategy to contain an ascendant China.\n\nZelenskiy at the time had harsh words for Modi's trip, too, saying it was a \"huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world's largest democracy hug the world's most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day.\"\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nOn August 23, Modi offered his country's humanitarian support for war-wracked Ukraine.\n\n\"Whatever help is required from a humanitarian standpoint, India will always stand with you and will go above and beyond to support you,\" Modi said.\n\nZelenskiy did not make any remarks, but posted a message on X accompanied by a video of him and Modi visiting the exhibition commemorating children who have died in the war.\n\n\"Today in Kyiv, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and I honored the memory of the children whose lives were taken by Russian aggression. Children in every country deserve to live in safety. We must make this possible,\"Zelenskiy said in his message.\n\nModi's trip is the first by an Indian leader to Kyiv since the countries established bilateral relations more than 30 years ago. He has said he plans to also discuss \"deepening the India-Ukraine friendship.\"\n\nIn comments to Reuters, Zelenskiy's presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak said Modi's visit to Kyiv was significant because New Delhi \"really has a certain influence\" over Moscow.\n\n\"It's extremely important for us to effectively build relations with such countries, to explain to them what the correct end to the war is -- and that it is also in their interests,\" Podolyak said.\n\nMeanwhile in Washington, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin met with Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh at the Pentagon.\n\nAustin noted the countries' increased defense cooperation, including efforts to strengthen critical supply chains and interoperability between their militaries.\n\n\"We share a vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific, and our defense cooperation continues to grow stronger and stronger,\" Austin said in a news release. \"We're expanding our defense industrial ties and working to coproduce more capabilities and strengthen supply chain resilience.\"\n\nHe highlighted India's participation in the recent Rim of the Pacific military exercise led by the U.S. Navy in Hawaii that brought together 29 partner nations.\n\n\"The Indian Navy remains an important security provider in the Indian Ocean,\" Austin said, adding the U.S. is committed to deepening naval cooperation and \"doing more together with unmanned technology, and to strengthening undersea domain awareness.\"\n\nSingh said the growing U.S.-India cooperation covers \"all areas of human endeavor.\" He noted robust ties between Indians and Americans and shared democratic values and interests on a range of issues.\n\nThe New York-based Human Rights Foundation (HRF) said on August 22 that it had filed a submission with the Special Procedures division of the UN Human Rights Council on behalf of Marat Zhylanbaev, the imprisoned leader of the unregistered Algha Qazaqstan (Forward Kazakhstan) political party.\n\nZhylanbaev, a noted human rights activist and athlete, was arrested in May 2023 and initially sentenced to 20 days in jail for holding a picket two months earlier to demand the release of political prisoners and to ask Western nations to impose sanctions on Kazakh officials for \"helping\" Russia evade sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nZhylanbaev was later remanded in custody on charges of taking part in a banned group's activities and financing an extremist organization.\n\nIn late November 2023, a court in Astana found Zhylanbaev guilty and sentenced him to seven years in prison while also banning him from engaging in social and political activities.\n\nIn June 2024, the Supreme Court of Kazakhstan rejected Zhylanbaev's appeal against his incarceration.\n\nInvestigators say the activities of Zhylanbaev and his followers were coordinated by the fugitive critic of the Kazakh government, Mukhtar Ablyazov, whose Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan (DVK) movement was labeled as extremist and banned in the country in March 2018. Zhylanbaev is also accused of transferring money to supporters of DVK twice.\n\nZhylanbaev rejects the charges against him, calling them politically motivated.\n\n\"Kazakhstan failed to release Mr. Zhylanbaev when his pretrial detention was set to end in July 2023 and held him in a cell with a convicted individual while awaiting trial. His closed trial took place before a tightly controlled judiciary, and all but one of his requests to call witnesses was denied. His detention cannot be justified under these circumstances,\" HRF International Legal Associate Kaitie Holland said.\n\n\"The Kazakh regime has demonstrated a pattern of suppressing dissent by consistently classifying the opposition as 'extremist.'\"\n\nHRF asked UN Special Procedures to investigate Zhylanbaev's case and called on Kazakhstan to release him immediately.\n\nCIA Director William Burns held talks on August 23 in Pristina with Prime Minister Albin Kurti before concluding his two-day visit in Kosovo, the Kosovar government said in a statement.\n\nKurti thanked Burns for Washington's continuous support for Kosovo and voiced Pristina's dedication to deepening bilateral cooperation while reaffirming his country's unwavering commitment to democracy, rule-of-law, and Euro-Atlantic integration, the statement said, calling Burns' visit \"historic.\"\n\nOn August 22, Burns met with Kosovar President Vjosa Osmani and the head of Kosovo's Intelligence Agency (KIA), Petrit Ajeti, according to a Facebook post by Osmani, who wrote on August 23 that her country's alliance with the United States was \"a guarantee of security, peace and success.”\n\nBurns, who arrived in Kosovo after reported stops earlier this week in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia, Bulgaria, and North Macedonia during an unannounced tour amid concerns about U.S. relations with Kosovo and Russian influence in the Balkans, did not make any comment at the end of his visit.\n\nAccording to the flight-tracking website Flightradar24, a U.S. military plane believed to be used to fly the CIA chief made stops in those countries although his tour was not confirmed officially by U.S. authorities.\n\nBurns' visit to Kosovo follows concerns about the partnership between the United States and Kosovo, especially regarding the government's handling of issues related to the country's Serb minority.\n\nJeffrey Hovenier Speaks To RFE/RL\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:01:28 0:00\n\nIn an interview last week with RFE/RL's Kosovo Service, U.S. Ambassador to Kosovo Jeffrey Hovenier said the U.S. administration had been \"challenged\" by Kosovar Prime Minister Albin Kurti and his government and the “quality of our partnership is not what we would hope it would be on some of these issues.\"\n\nThe U.S. State Department has urged Kurti to return to \"constructive and close engagement\" with Washington, the European Union, and NATO.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media

Albanian-majority southern side and a Serb-majority northern side,.\n\nSanctions-hit Belarus has announced that it will sign a free trade deal with China for services and investment, as well as agreements to strengthen cooperation in security, energy, and finance.\n\nThe new pact was announced in a joint statement released on August 23, a day after a visit by Chinese Premier Li Qiang to Minsk where he met with Belarusian Prime Minister Raman Halouchanka and authoritarian leader Alyaksandr Lukashenka, and promised to deepen cooperation to improve industrial supply chains and reduce costs.\n\n“One of them can definitely be called historic -- an agreement on the creation of a free trade zone for services and investment,” the statement quoted Lukashenka as saying about the agreements.\n\nBelarus said that the trade deal would create “transparent and predictable rules,” which would help the country’s economy by increasing its exports to China by at least 12 percent and boosting Chinese investment into Belarus by 30 percent in the next five years.\n\nSpeaking with Li, who arrived in Minsk after a multiday visit to Moscow, Lukashenka said he wanted to see a “large influx of Chinese technology” into Belarus over the coming years -- a move that could signal an increasing reliance on Beijing for trade and economic growth moving forward.\n\nChina is already Belarus’s second-largest trading partner after Russia, with the state-run China Daily saying that bilateral trade surpassed $8.4 billion in 2023.\n\nBelarus has been one of Russia's closest allies following its 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, providing logistical support and air bases for the war and recently deployed Russian tactical nuclear weapons on its territory.\n\nBut while Minsk still relies heavily on Moscow for political and financial support, it has also looked to balance that dependence with closer ties with Beijing.\n\nThat need for diversification has grown in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine with Moscow directing its political and economic resources toward the war.\n\nCut off from Brussels in 2020 following a crackdown triggered by his disputed reelection that the opposition and the West denounced as rigged, Lukashenka has courted China for loans, investment, and, increasingly, military and political support.\n\nIn July, Belarus became the 10th member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and also hosted Chinese troops for joint military exercises in the western part of the country, some 5 kilometers from the Polish border.\n\nOnce an active investor in Belarus for infrastructure, manufacturing, and technology ventures, China had not offered a new project or loan to Minsk since 2019 and seemed to have stepped back from the country amid its domestic crisis, which cut Lukashenka off politically from the European Union and made him a less appealing economic partner for Beijing.\n\nBut despite the years of limited economic engagement, Beijing and Minsk have maintained close political ties, which have now led to Lukashenka securing fresh Chinese investment.\n\nAmong the various agreements included in the series of deals, five industrial projects totaling $1 billion are set to be launched and 12 more industrial projects worth $2 billion are under approval, according to the joint statement.\n\nTheagreements signed also plan to set up closer cooperation between Belarus and Chinese provincial governments in Chongqing and Shaanxi.\n\nGermany’s decision to select Iranian director Mohammad Rasoulof’s latest movie to represent the country in the 2025 Oscars in the international feature category shows that Iranian independent cinema is making strides, the director has told RFE/RL's Radio Farda.\n\nRasoulof’s The Seed Of The Sacred Fig was selected by an independent jury of experts from among 13 submissions, according to German Films, which represents German cinema interests abroad.\n\nIn a brief message to Radio Farda on August 22, the Golden Bear-winning director said he was “happy” for various reasons.\n\n“First of all, the voice of Iranian independent cinema appears to be on a new path,” said Rasoulof, who fled Iran earlier this year.\n\n“Secondly, the movie offers a picture close to the reality about the women's protests in Iran,” he added, referring to the ‘Women, Life, Freedom’ protests in 2022.\n\nThe protests were sparked by the death in morality-police custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish-Iranian woman who was detained for allegedly flaunting the country’s strict dress code for women.\n\nThe unrest lasted for months, with rights groups estimating that more than 500 protesters were killed as security forces clamped down on the demonstrations.\n\nRasoulof said he was also happy because the movie’s submission as Germany’s hope for the Oscars was a recognition of the efforts and hardships endured by the cast and crew of the film in Iran.\n\n“This highlights the efforts of a group that tried to be an honest narrator of the truth despite the restrictions,” he said.\n\nRasoulof revealed in May that he had fled Iran after being informed that he had been sentenced to eight years in prison and flogging on security-related charges.\n\nAn outspoken critic of the Iranian establishment’s crackdown on protests, Rasoulof was convicted of “collusion to act against national security.”\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media

Festival.\n\nRasoulof attended the festival after leaving Iran, receiving a 12-minute standing ovation after the screening of his film. The movie won multiple awards at Cannes, including the Competition's Special Jury Prize and the Prix Francois Chalais for Best Film.\n\nThe film tells the story of an Iranian judge struggling with paranoia. His mistrust intensifies after his gun goes missing amid growing nationwide protests. He suspects his wife and daughters of stealing his weapon and imposes heavy restrictions at home.\n\nRasoulof won the Golden Bear -- the Berlin Film Festival’s top prize -- in 2020 for his film There Is No Evil, which tells four stories loosely connected to the themes of the death penalty in Iran and personal freedoms under oppression. He was barred by Tehran from travelling to Germany to receive his award."
