        "text": "SIMON MARKS:\n\nAnd this new face of Syria has been brought to the world by this new face: President Bashar al-Assad, just 37 years old, who three years ago inherited ultimate power from his late father. The image of Syrian strongman Hafez al-Assad, who ruled here for 30 years, remains omnipresent on the streets of Damascus. But it is now his son and heir who is shaping this country's future.\n\nSyria today is suddenly surrounded by nations friendly to the United States: Turkey to the north, Jordan and Israel to the south and, presumably now, Iraq to the east. The president, who visited last weekend's trade fair, personally spearheaded the arrival of the Internet in Syria the moment he took power, and did so to prove his readiness to open his country to the outside world. But that openness notwithstanding, across this ancient city — first established 6,000 years before the birth of Christ; the Syrians claim it's the oldest in the world — we found it consistently difficult to persuade people to share their views on the country's new president and Syria's next steps.\n\nSIMON MARKS:\n\nOff-camera, other Syrians told us they hadn't noticed much change since the country's new president came to power. They expressed worries about the economy. Unemployment is hovering at around 20 percent, and traders in the market say business is down nearly 60 percent, because the turmoil in neighboring Iraq is keeping tourists away.\n\nSyria does have some natural advantages. It is the only Arab country self-sufficient in food, and its agricultural sector has been largely freed from decades of Soviet-style central planning. But oil is a major problem. Syria has limited reserves of its own, and since the year 2000, relied heavily on subsidized exports from Saddam Hussein's Iraq. They ended the moment the U.S. military switched off the pipeline through which the Iraqi crude illegally flowed, bringing to a halt trade that analysts estimate was worth nearly one- fifth of Syria's entire economy.\n\nSyrian government officials failed to make themselves available for interviews with western journalists this week. But there are many things that they implored us to report about their country. Syria supported U.N. Security Council Resolution 1441, which called for the unconditional disarmament of Iraq. It backed the U.S. war on terror, helping to apprehend leading members of al-Qaida. It severed diplomatic relations with Baghdad back in the 1970s and never restored them. Damascus even served as the headquarters for many leading members of the Iraqi opposition throughout Saddam Hussein's rule.\n\nAnd then there are the things that the Syrian government is less keen for us to emphasize. This remains a tightly controlled country, a virtual one-party state that continues to jail journalists, academics and political opponents. This weekend, Secretary of State Colin Powell, who arrived in Damascus this afternoon, is expected to demand that Syria ends its development of weapons of mass destruction; abandons its support for the terrorist activities of militant Islamic groups like Hezbollah, Hamas and Islamic Jihad; and agrees not to harbor fleeing members of Saddam Hussein's former regime.\n\nMahdi Dahlala is the editor-in- chief of the daily newspaper operated by Syria's governing Ba'ath Party, and a former top party official. His newspaper, \"al Ba'ath,\" today sells only 55,000 copies in a country of 17 million people — many Syrians now choosing to read newspapers from other more liberal parts of the Arab world instead. Like many loyal government servants, its editor vigorously denies claims that the Syrians sent military supplies to the former Iraqi leader or offered sanctuary to Saddam Hussein or his top lieutenants.\n\nMAHDI DAHLALA, Editor, \"Al Ba\"ath\" Newspaper (Translated): Logically there could not be any cooperation, politically or militarily, with the former Iraqi regime. Many high Iraqi officials have been wanted here in Syria since 1966. Saddam Hussein would sooner show up in Washington than in Damascus. He would be in Washington for sure before he would be in Damascus, because he has been wanted here since 1966, and there was no contact between Hafez al-Assad or Bashar al-Assad and Saddam Hussein. No contact between them at all.\n\nSIMON MARKS:\n\nAll over Damascus you can see evidence that many here think the U.S.-led war against Iraq was aimed at shoring up Israel's position in the region. It is the issue of the disputed territory of the Golan Heights, seized by Israel in 1967, that Syrian officials specifically want to resolve as part of any negotiation that brings about improved relations with the United States. The Syrians say the town of al-Qunaitra was laid waste by retreating Israeli forces in 1973, the year the Syrians recaptured it along with around one-third of the Golan Heights. The Syrians won't rebuild al-Qunaitra or allow its citizens to return. Instead it's been turned into a museum that Syria says is a testament to Israeli aggression. Strategically vital to both countries, the Syrians insist the Golan Heights must be returned to them.\n\nAli Jamano is an independent Syrian journalist. He's familiar to many here because he contributes frequently to the pan-Arab satellite networks that Syrians now prefer to watch instead of the country's domestic television channels. He's aware that in Syria today at least one other leading independent journalist is jailed, charged with publishing \"false\" information. He says the U.S. relationship with Israel is a major sticking point that could prevent improved ties between Washington and Damascus."
