        "text": "Syrian Vice President Farouk Al-Sharaa has made his first public appearance in several weeks, ending rumors that he defected.\n\nAl-Sharaa was last seen at the funeral of four top Syrian government officials who were killed in a blast in Damascus on July 18. Since then, speculation has circulated that he defected to Jordan in what would have been a blow to Bashar Assad's regime.\n\nJordan and Al-Sharaa's office repeatedly denied he defected. On Sunday, reporters saw Al-Sharaa exit his car and walk to his office for a meeting with Alaeddin Boroujerdi, head of Iran's powerful parliamentary committee on national security and foreign policy.\n\nAn Associated Press reporter at the scene said Al-Sharaa looked serious and steered away from reporters covering the meeting. He did not make a statement.\n\nSyria's state news agency echoed that report, said Al-Sharaa met a parliamentary delegation from Iran, led by Borougerdi.\n\nReuters and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nMore world stories from NBC News:\n\nDozens killed, hurt in Venezuela oil refinery explosion\n\nIsaac heads for Cuba after drenching Haiti\n\nTiger at German zoo kills staffer, is shot dead\n\nCanadian woman in water-soaked wedding dress drowns\n\n'Crushing political dissent'? Gambia to execute every prisoner on death row"
