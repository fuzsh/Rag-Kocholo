Spotliuiil density and deer niorlalily were strongly correlated from summer 1992 tlirou^li summer 1993 (r = 0.94). Traffic conditions, topoj^raphic features, and vegetative characteristics contributed to mortality levels. Roadkills were highest along US 40 (68% year 1, 55% year 2) where traffic volume and speed were significantly higher than along either state route. Large drainages intersected highways in 78% of designated kill /ones. Roads adjacent to agricultural areas along all routes sustained the fewest highway mortalities.

Many teehni(iues (c.^., leneinj^ with over- passes and imderpasses, swareflex warninj^ refleetors, and highway li^htin^) have been evaluated in an effort to reduce deer-hiji;hway mortality; however, none have provided an effeetive, cost-efficient solution for widespread use (Heed 1993, Homin and liissonetle in press).

Great Basin Naturalist [Volume 55 on white-tailed deer populations in mixed- hardwood habitat types of Pennsylvania (Peek and Bellis 1969, Vaughan 1970, Bellis and Graves 1971, Puglisi et al. 1974, Carbaugh et al. 1975, Kress 1980, Bashore et al. 1985) and Michigan (Reilly and Green 1974, Allen and McCuUougli 1976, Kasul 1976, Sicuranza 1979). In general, high concentrations of kill occurred in nonwooded areas and were related to deer foraging pattterns. The juxtaposition of crops and fields to wooded areas influenced deer roadkill locations but varied between studies. In Pennsylvania 58% of white-tailed deer- vehicle accidents occuned in areas where both sides of the road were bordered by fields (Puglisi et al. 1974). In southern Michigan higher acci- dent rates occurred where old fields bordered woods or crops than where cover type was continuous (Sicuranza 1979). Accident locations were not consistent between years (Puglisi et al. 1974). At the roadside, right-of-way topog- raphy and vegetation attiacted deer, particularly in wooded areas (Carbaugh et al. 1975), and affected deer movements, channeling deer parallel to the road as they foraged (Bellis and Graves 1971). Limited studies of mule deer-highway rela- tionships indicated that deer moved along drain- ages and riparian areas when approaching a road. These routes corresponded with migra- tory routes of deer (Mansfield and Miller 1975, Reeve 1988). Highway mortality of both white-tailed and mule deer generally peaked during fall in con- junction with breeding and hunting seasons, with a 2nd, smaller peak occurring in spring, when deer foraged along right-of-ways during greenup (Bellis and Graves 1971, Reilly and Green 1974, Goodwin and Ward 1976, Sicuranza 1979, Dusek et al. 1989). Different patterns of highway mortality are due, in part, to differences in seasonal distribution and migratoiy patterns of deer (Mansfield and Miller 1975). In studies conducted on deer winter concentration areas in Colorado, virtually all mortality was observed during earlv spring (Myers 1969). RelativeK few studies compared sex coui- position oi roadkills with diat of the li\\ing popu- lation; yet such comparisons may reveal behav- ioral traits influencing location and timing of roadkills. The sex ratio of observed roadkills along 1-80 in Wyoming was similar to the reported herd composition of 23 male: 100 female (Goodwin and Ward 1976). The sex ratio of road-killed adult deer in Wisconsin (Jahn 1959) was not representative of the liv- ing population. During fall a higher propor- tion of bucks were involved in deer-vehicle accidents aldiough the living population showed a higher proportion of does. Similarly, from December through May, yearling males in the Yellowstone area were involved in vehicle accidents in greater proportion than their abundance in the living population (Dusek et al. 1989). Many calculations of live herd com- position and number have been based on few spotlight censuses, and reported results may not adequately reflect live population charac- teristics. Behavioral and habitat use patterns differ among and within species (Kramer 1971, 1973, Geist 1981), and implementation and success of mitigation strategies intended to reduce deer roadkill may be site- or species- specific. We designed this study (1) to determine whether mule deer roadkills on newly relo- cated highways would increase and (2) to eval- uate the influence of topographic features and vegetation characteristics on the kill pattern. We documented roadkill locations and assessed traffic speed and volume, road alignment, and vegetative and topographic features at areas of high and low kill. We compared live deer-use patterns and roadkill locations to determine the influence of roadside leatines to deer- xehicle accident locations. Deer-highwa)' mor- tality levels and composition were compared to that of the living population over a 2-yr period with an extensixe data collection study using weekly roadkill collections and repeti- tive spotlight censuses. Information obtained through this research effort complements existing research and fiu- thers our understanding of deer-high\\\\ a> rela- tionships. There is limited information that broadK characterizes mule deer use and kill distributions on and near highway systems, or that has investigated the influence of physical 1 an d scape featu res . Study Area The study area is located in the valley between the Wasatch and Uintah mountain ranges of northeastern Utah; the Provo River originates in the Uintah mountains and bisects the valley floor. Segments of three highways — 1995] ITlCIIW AY MOKTALITV DISTRIBUTIONS OF DRER US 40, state routes (SR) 32 and 248, totaliiit^ 47.3 km on the eastern slope of the Wasateh mountains in nortlieastern LI tali — were ehosen for study. Construction of the roadways was completed in 1989 and was necessitated by inundation of existing roads following con- struction of Jordanelle Reservoir. Filling com- menced in spring 1993. Dominant valley habitats consist of mesic meadow, riparian areas, and pasture lands. Surrounding drainage slopes are predomi- nantly within a mountain brush and sage- brush-grass zone (6000-7000 ft elevation), with scattered pinyon pine and juniper. Limited stands of aspen, cottonwood, and willow occur. Mule deer utilize the area as year-long range but usually are forced into the valley bottom during winters with heavy snowfall. Methods Deer roadkill data were collected at least once per week by research personnel from 15 October 1991 to 14 October 1993. UDOT and UDWR personnel assisted with collection efforts during their daily activities. Date, high- way identification, and location of each kill were recorded to the nearest 0.10 mile. Deer initially were classified as adult or fawn; incisors were removed from adult deer for age determination by cementum annuli proce- dures (Low and Cowan 1963). Deer kill zones and nonkill zones were des- ignated based on 1991-1993 deer-highway mortality locations. A minimum of 5 kills per mile had to have occurred for a segment of roadway to be considered a kill zone. A kill zone ended when a section of road did not contain a kill for more than 0.10 mile. We ran- domly selected 4 kill zone and 4 nonkill zone paired locations of 0.10-mile length along each highway and established transects to evaluate respective road alignment and associated habi- tat features. We recorded the distribution of kills over the entire study area, average traffic volume and speed for each highway percent vegeta- tive cover, and topography proximal to area roads. Kills were recorded to the nearest 0.01 mile. Twice monthly spotlight counts were conducted to document deer use and density adjacent to study area roads. Counts were ini- tiated at dark; each count averaged 3.2 h {s = 21 min). We began the spotlight run on a dif- ferent route each night. We drove along both sides of each road at a speed of 45-50 kph and used a hantlheld 400, 000 candlepower spot- light to locate deer. Deer were located to the nearest 0.10 mile. We stopped when deer were spotted to identify sex and age class, dis- tinguishing fawns by size. The activity of deer spotted in the right-of-way was classed as feeding, bedding, walking, or standing. We used statistical correlations to compare deer road- kill locations between years and with locations of live deer. Rangefinder readings were recorded at each 0.1-mile interval to provide an estimate of ob- servable area along each road (Fafarman and DeYoung 1986). Mountainbrush habitats de- creased deer visibility, and some areas along roads were not visible from a vehicle due to roadside rock cuts or steep declines bordered by concrete barriers. From numerous spotlight runs, we calculated the mean maximum visi- ble distance to be 500 m. Deer snow track counts were recorded along the right-of-way once each during the winters 1991-92 and 1992-93 to evaluate deer approaches to the roads. We counted the num- ber of trails within each 0.10-mile intei^val and described them as either parallel or perpen- dicular to the road. A parallel trail continued its direction for at least 30 m. Road alignment, right-of-way width and slope, right-of-way vegetation, and vegetation composition were characterized to a perpen- dicular distance 100 m beyond the right-of- way fence. Each highway was classified as either 4-lane or 2-lane with passing lanes. UDOT recorded traffic speed and volumes for each road during 2 periods: 11 March to 15 March 1992 and 29 June to 5 July 1992. Road alignments at each selected kill and nonkill transect location were described as cun^e, hill, or straight section. A cui-ve or hill was consid- ered part of the road alignment if it was within 100 m of the transect. Deer further than 100 m from the road are unlikely to be involved in an immediate collision (Romin and Dalton 1992); thus, beyond this distance, a hill or curve that would have reduced driver visibility had less significance. We analyzed habitat features during Sep- tember 1993. Stereoscopic aerial photography (1:24,000) was used to describe habitat features. We placed a transparent grid over photographs to determine percent cover (mountain brush Great Basin Naturalist [Volume 55 XJS40 30 M \"' I 1^ ^ 10 O 20 M 1^ 10 3 .a.

At each paired kill and nonkill location we estab- lished 3 habitat transect lines aligned perpen- dicular to the road. The transects were spaced 100 m apart and extended through the right- of-way zone 100 m past the right-of-way fence. We measured the length of each habitat along each transect line. Habitats included right-of- way revegetation, mountain brush, sagebrush- grass, grass-forb, aspen, cottonwood, willow, agricultural pastureland, riparian, and river. We calculated the proportion of each habitat present along the combined transect lines for each kill and nonkill location. We identified roadkill and live deer loca- tions, as well as descriptixe roadside features to 0.1 mile, consistent with highway mile marker delineation. We con\\erted to metric units for analysis where appropriate. Results Deer locations We documented 397 deer roadkills during the stud\\ from 15 October 1991 to 14 October 1993; 278 (5.9 kills/km) kills occurred during 1995] Highway Mortality Distributions of Deer Kill Zone \\ ::$$>» Drainage Location Heber 1 Mile Fig. 2. Location of kill zones and associated drainages at Jordanelle Reservoir, Utah, 1991-1993. the 1st year of study (15 October 1991 to 14 October 1992), and 119 (2.5 kills/km) were documented during the 2nd year (15 October 1992 to 14 October 1993). Highway US 40 sustained the highest kill levels: 68% during the 1st year and 55% during the 2nd yean State routes 248 and 32 sustained similar kill levels; during the 1st year we recorded 18% and 14% of the total deer-highway mortality on SR 248 and SR 32, respectively. During the 2nd year we recorded 25% of the total annual kill on SR 248 and 19% on SR 32. Deer kills averaged <20 before the roads were relocated. Nineteen deer kill zones were identified based on the spatial distribution of deer road- kills during both years (Figs. 1, 2). The mean length of kill zones was 1.0 km {s = 0.62). Deer- vehicle collisions along US 40 occurred most frequently between mile markers 6.0 and 9.0 during both the 1st (56%) and 2nd (48%) years of the study. Twenty-eight percent of deer roadkills along US 40 occurred from mile marker 7.0 to 7.9 during the 1st year. Roadkill locations were correlated between years along US 40 at both the 1.0-mile (r = 0.69, P = 0.03) and 0.10-mile (r = 0.56, P < 0.001) interval. Deer kill locations were not signifi- cantly correlated between 1st and 2nd years along SR 32 at either the 1.0-mile (r = -0.14, P = 0.70) or 0.10-mile (r = 0.004, P = 0.968) 6 Great Basin Naturalist [Volume 55 scale. Deer kill locations along SR 248 were significantly correlated at the 1.0-niile intenal (r = 0.72, P = 0.02) but not at the 0.10-mile inten^al (r = 0.18, P = 0.07). Deer spotlight counts were not signifi- cantly correlated to kill locations at the 1.0- mile interval for any road during either year: SR 248 year 1 (r = 6.43, F = 0.19), year 2\\r = 0.17, P = 0.61); SR 32 year 1 (r = 0.42, P = 0.23), year 2 (r = 0.12, P = 0.73); US 40 year 1 (r = 0.51, P = 0.14), year 2 (r = 0.15, P = 0.68). However, positive correlations were stronger during the first year. Fort>' percent of spotlighted deer were seen on the right-of-way. We identified the behav- ior of 968 (55%) of the deer along the right-of- way. Thirty-three percent were standing when first observed, 32% were feeding, 12% were bedded, and 23% were walking along the right- of-way or crossing the road. Perpendicular snow tracks were not corre- lated with deer-highway mortality locations (r = 0.29 , P = 0.42). Parallel tracks constituted 48% and 32% of all deer trails counted during the 1st and 2nd years, respectively. Traffic Characteristics Traffic characteristics contributed to deer- highway mortality levels (Table 1). Highway US 40 had the highest (3.7-9.9 times) mean 24-hr traffic totals of the 3 study area roads. Mean traffic speed was highest along US 40 (69.3 mph) from 11 March to 15 March 1992; however, over the 4 July weekend (29 June-5 July 1992), average speed along SR 248 (59.1 mph) was slightly higher than along US 40 (58.9 mph). Volume and speed were somewhat higher along SR 248 than along SR 32 for both test dates. Highway US 40 is a 4-lant> road and SR 248 and SR 32 are 2-lane roads with occasional passing zones. Road alignment (Table 2) was similar for transect kill and nonldll zone loca- tions (x^ = 1.2, df= 2, P = 0.70). Habitat From aerial photographs (1:24,000) we deter- mined that percent cover was greater along US 40 (63%) than along SR 248 (28%) or SR 32 (31%). Designated kill zones had higher mean percent cover (40%) than nonkill zones (29%). Highway deer kill along US 40 was highest in an area (mile markers 6.0-9.0) of 88%) vegeta- tive cover during both the 1st (56%) and 2nd Table 1.

Low mortality occurred in predominantly sagebrush-grass/wet meadow (mile markers 4.0-5.0) or agiicultm-al zones (mile markers 12.3-12.9) with <20%) cover. Along SR 248, agricultural zones sustained 1 deer (1%) mortality during the 2-yr period. State route 32 sustained 28% of its total deer road- kill in agricultural areas. However, 50% of this kill occurred at mile marker 9.0, located in a riparian area at an agricultural pasture and cliff interface. During spotlight censuses we observed a larger proportion of deer along right-of-ways associated with mountain brush habitat than along agricultural areas (Table 3). Paired / tests of microhabitat features showed no significant difference in proportion of cover 100 m beyond the fence between kill and nonkill locations {t = 0.13, df = 13, P = 0.90). Proportion of cover on the right-of-way ne\\'er was higher than 29% for any transect. We examined 19 kill zones and 19 nonkill zones in the study area for associations with drainages (Fig. 2). Since deer-vehicle collisions occuned along nearly all of US 40, we evaluated the 8 highest kill locations along this road. Major drainages intersected the roads in 16 (79%) kill zones. Along US 40, large drainages intersected the highway at 6 (75%) of the kill locations. Two kill zone locations along US 40 weie at highway overpasses (mile markers 4.0 and 8.0); drainages were located within 0.2 miles. Two other kill zones extended past high- way underpasses (mile markers 8.2 and 11.4) Seven (37%) nonkill zones had drainages inter- secting the roads. Howe\\er, in 4 of the nonkill zones, drainages were within 0.2 miles of a kill zone. Kill and nonkill locations did not differ in right-of-way widtlis (^ = 1.1, df = 13, P = 0.30). Deer kill per km was greatest when right-of- way areas were inclined rather than declined or level (Table 4). 1995] HiciiwAY Mortality Distiubutions of Deer Tablk 2.

Of 397 deer mortalities documented during the study from 15 October 1991 to 14 October 1993, we clas- sified 205 (51.6%) does, 75 (18.9%) bucks, 86 (21.7%) fawns, and 31 (7.8%) unknown. Sixty- four fawns (16.1%) were female and 22 (5.5%) were male (Fig. 3). There was a 57% decrease from 278 (5.9 deer/km) deer roadkills during the 1st year to 119 (2.5 deer/km) roadkills dur- ing the 2nd year. We determined the age of 198 (70.7%) adult deer by cementum annuli techniques. Sixty-seven percent (n = 133) adult kills were < 2.5 yr old. The oldest recorded deer roadkills (2.5%) were 6.5 yr old. The 1992 hunter buck hai-vest from the Kamas district, east of the study area, also indicated a young population (n = 85); 55% yearlings, 15% 2.5 yr old, and 30% > 3.5 yr old (M. Welch, UDWR, personal communication). We located 4378 deer on 39 spotlight trips driving a total of 1845 km. There was a 64.2% decrease from an average 14.6 deer/km^ in the 1st year of the study to 5.23 deer/km^ during the 2nd year UDWR estimated a similar 70% reduction in the deer population on the Kamas District, attributed to the harsh 1992-93 win- ter (M. Welch, UDWR, personal communica- tion). We identified sex and age of 1515 (34.6%) spodighted deer: 987 (65.2%) does, 136 (8.9%) bucks, and 392 (25.9%) fawns. We calculated an obsei'vable area unobstructed by roadside barriers or dense vegetation of 10.98 km^ for the study area. We identified monthly and seasonal peaks in deer mortality (Table 5) by phenological period: fall (September-November), winter (December-Februaiy), spring (March-May), and summer (June-August). The following anal- yses treat the study period as year 1 (15 Octo- ijcr 1991-30 August 1992) and year 2 (1 Sep- tember 1992-14 October 1993), to allow inter- pretation of seasonal deer distributions and roadkill patterns. The highest roadkill peak (25%) occurred during No\\'ember 1991. Thirty percent of the mortality in year 1 occurred during the fall even though data collection did not begin until 15 October 1991. Another peak (33%) was evident during the summer of year 1; 15% of the mortality for the year occurred in July. A similar fall peak (52%) occurred dur- ing year 2; 20% of the mortality occurred in October and 19% in November. A relatively large peak (18%) occurred in April. Eleven percent of the mortality occurred during the summer. During year 1, 41.8% of the annual Great Basin Naturalist [Volume 55 Table 5.

Fawn mor- tality peaked for both males (47%) and females (57.4%) in the foil. During year 2, the highest mortality among all sex and age classes occuned during fall. Seasonal distributions of deer-highway mor- tality' were compared to observed deer densi- ties during the same periods. Seasonal deer densities and highway mortalities were not significantly correlated (r = 0.54, P = 0.14) over the 2-year period (Fig. 4). For the period of summer 1992 to summer 1993, deer-high- way mortality and deer population density were strongly correlated (r = 0.94, P < 0.01), suggesting a density-dependent relationship. A negative coirelation existed between deer den- sities and kill/density (r = -0.68, F = 0.06). During year 1, observed deer density was low during fall (5.4 deer/km^) and winter (9.9 deer/ kni^) while highway mortality was high (fall = 71 deer, winter = 58 deer). Deer density (2.41 deer/ km^) and highway mortality (18 deer) were low during the 2nd winter Following winter 1992-93 deer density adjacent to study area roads increased slightly during spring (3.3 deer/km^) and summer (3.8 deer/km^). Observed density never reached pre-winter levels. Highway mortality levels of deer also increased (n = 31) in spring 1993 but did not return to pre-winter levels. Kill as a function of density was lower than observed deer den- sity from winter 1992 to winter 1993 but exceeded density following the harsh winter of 1992-93 (Fig. 4)^ The roadkill buckxloe ratio during fall (22.9:100) and early winter (78.9:100) of year 1 was greater than that observed in the living population (fall = 6.7:100, winter = 4.4:100) during the same periods (Table 6).

The summer l:)uck:doe ratio was similar for roadkill and liv- ing populations during both years. For the months June-November 1992, the correlation coefficient between number of fawns involved in vehicular collisions and number observed on spotlight runs was significant: r = 0.84 {P = 0.04). For both summers the fawn:doe ratio of road-killed animals was 8.3:100, higher than the observed fawn: doe ratio (1.4:100) of the living population. Discussion We distinguished aspects of deer mortality based on traffic volume, habitat, topography, and seasonal distribution. Traffic volume signif- icantly influenced overall deer mortality levels. Though total kill in the study area decreased by 57% fi-om the 1st to the 2nd year, roadkills remained higher along US 40 than either SR 248 or SR 32. The 4-lane alignment of US 40 contributed to higher deer kills. Traffic vol- ume was higher and deer-vehicle collisions occurred more frequently along SR 248 than along SR 32 during both years. Vegetative cover along the length of US 40 was greater than along state routes 248 or 32. Likewise, percent cover was higher for desig- nated kill zones compared to nonkill zones. High percent cover appears to attract deer to right-of-ways for foraging. Agricultural areas provide abundant forage away from roadsides and were associated with low deer-vehicle collision levels. Deer usually approached roads along drainages, and higher kill levels occurred near large drainages. The ability to predict kill locations requires that kill locations remain similar over time. Kill location correlations at the 0.10-mile interval were low for SR 248 and SR 32 between the 2 yr The kill locations along US 40 were signifi- cantly correlated; however, most of US 40 was considered a continuous kill zone, which would lead to a correlation simply by coinci- dence. Although drainages provide highway ap- proaches, it is not possible to predict with exact- ness where deer-car collisions will occur based on habitat (% cover) and topography proximal to the roads. Deer often move parallel along the right-of-way after approaching a road. How- ever, inclined right-of-ways flinneled deer along the highway and were associated with higher kills. Low correlations between spotlight and kill locations further suggest that deer did not immediately cross the roads where they entered right-of-way areas. Snow trail counts also indi- cated parallel movement of deer. While seasonal deer-highway mortality dis- tributions tracked large fluctuations in popula- tion levels, behavior associated with life his- toiy activities of deer, e.g. fawning, breeding, and migration, also influenced year-round road- kill levels and composition. During the 2-yr study period, both roadkill and observed deer density levels decreased. When harsh winter conditions (1992-93) reduced population lev- els, deer-highway mortality was proportionally lower. Variability in the association between live deer density and roadkill numbers can be attrib- uted in part to deer-use patterns. Between fall and spring of year 1, highway mortality de- creased and spotlight counts recorded increased deer density. The mild winter that year allowed deer access to large areas and they maintained residence higher on drainage slopes. Weather conditions did not force deer to remain near area roads, although tliey fiequenfly approached and crossed roads. We attributed the initial increase in deer density during spring 1992 to the approach and congregation of deer along right-of-ways for foraging. Fall peaks in deer-highway mortality ap- peared related to activities associated with 10 Great Basin Naturalist [Volume 55 25 DEEDING SEVERE W UNTING SEASON 100 <«'' ^'^'^ # # ^* # SEASON Fig. 5.

Deer were moving around the study area more frequently than during other seasons. Proportionally more bucks were involved in vehicular collisions during the fall than were obsei\"ved in the population. The lireeding sea- son of mule deer in Utah begins the last few days of October, peaks between 20 November and 2 December, and declines through Janu- ary (Robinette and Gashwiler 1950). During the study, Utah deer and elk hunting seasons occurred from late August through October (T. L. Parkin, UDWR, personal communication). Fawns were involved in deer-vehicle colli- sions most often during the fall and least often during the summer of both years. The fawning period for mule deer in Utah begins appro.xi- mately 5 June, reaches and maintains a peak 11-20 June, and declines through 15 August (Robinc>tte and Gashwiler 1950). Fawns are seen inirec^uently during their first 6-8 wk because their predator defense is based on a \"hider\" strategy ((ieist 1981). Fawns were absent in the observed population during the sunnner but appeared during the fall. Does were involved in collisions and ob- served more frequently than males during both years. Si.xty-eight percent of adult deer roadkills were does, while 70% of fawns were female during year 1. Similarly, 81% of adult deer killed were does and 87.5% of fawais were female during year 2. Does have heavy energy demands associated with gestation, parturi- tion, and lactation, which may explain their association with high-(jualit>' roadside vegeta- tion and subscciuent high mortalitv rates. Management Recommendations Certain topographic features and vegeta- tion characteristics associated with roads, cou- pled with deer movement dynamics, predis- pose mule deer to highway mortality. Highway alignment and right-of-way topography often function to funnel deer to the right-of-way and encourage movement of deer along the high- way corridor, creating the potential for colli- sions at numerous locations. Roads planned in high deer-use areas that will sustain high traf- fic volumes should be prioritized for mitigative procedures during planning. Mitigative tech- nologies, particularly fencing with crossing stiiictures, should focus on the initial approach of deer to the highway along large drainages and take into account deer spatial dynamics and population trends. Continuing studies designed for species- specific and habitat-specific conditions may fiuther an understanding of why deer-vehicle collisions occur on a spatial and temporal basis, and promote development of appropri- ate pre-construction designs and mitigation strategies.

Wurtsbaughl, David Barnard^ and Thomas Pettengill^ Abstract. — We used creel surveys to evaluate how a change from a 6-mon to a year-round fishing season affected the sport fish harvest in East Canyon Reservoir (Utah), a 277-ha mesoeutrophic system. Under the year-round season, fishing effort was 840 angler-h-ha-^-yr-l, and 360 trout ha~l were captured. Catch rates were proportional to estimated trout densities in the resei\"voir, ranging fi^om 1.06 during the winter ice fishery, to 0.18 fish angler~lh~l in July. Ninety- nine percent offish hai-vested were rainbow trout {Oncorhijnchus mijkiss). Thirty-two percent of the 300,000 75-mm fin- gerling trout stocked annually were captiu-ed by anglers within 2.5 yr, but return rates varied with the strain and/or size of trout stocked. Annual fish yield was 102 kg/lia, among the highest yet reported for a temperate zone, lacustrine sys- tem. Extending fishing from a 6-mon season to year-round increased the number of fish captured and provided almost twice as many hours of recreational fishing in the reservoir The harvest period was changed from traditional spring-simimer months to primarily a winter-spring fisher\\' because relatively few trout sui-vived for more than 6 mon after reaching hanestable size. Although salmonid production in East Canyon Resei^voir is veiy high, the fishery is in a precarious state because high primaiy producti\\'it\\' dri\\'en, in part, b\\ cultural eutrophication, makes water quality sub- optimal din-ing midsummer Key words: reservoir, yield, trout, creel, harvest, strains, regulation, productivity, fish, management, growth, Oncorhynchus mykiss. Important goals of lake and reservoir man- agement are to maximize both fish yield and recreational use. Methods of increasing yield include introducing different species or strains, lake fertilization, and modifying fishing regu- lations (Hall and Viin Den Avyle 1986, Stock- ner 1992). Modification of littoral zone escape habitat may also be important (Wurtsbaugh et al. 1975, Trendall 1988, Tibor and Wurtsbaugh 1991). Changes in fishing regulations, how- ever, offer a manager the most flexibility (Carl- ton 1975), and these changes are less likely to damage the ecosystem than are the other meth- ods. In 1985 the State of Utah changed from a 6-mon open season for trout (late May- November) with a daily limit of 8 fish, to a year-round fisheiy with no seasonal closures and a daily limit of 8 fish. To investigate how this management change affected the fisher); we conducted a 1-yr creel survey in 1986 to determine timing and magnitude of harvest from East Canyon Reservoir: we then com- pared these results with harvest characteris- tics measured in the reservoir in 1970 and 1972 under the 6-mon regulation. The 1986 creel survey also allowed us to measure the high fish yield of the reservoir and to relate it to various limnological parameters affecting fish production (Carline 1986). We were also able to investigate how different strains of trout stocked in the resei^voir recruited to the fisheiy (Brauhn and Kincaid 1982, Babey and Berry 1989). This work was part of a comprehensixe study on the ecology and causes of mortality of stocked rainbow trout in mid-elevation reser- voirs in Utah. Study Area East Canyon Resenoir is located at an ele- vation of 1734 m in northern Utah (Morgan County; 4()°54'N, 110°35'W). East Canyon Creek and other minor tributaries of the reser- voir drain a 99,200-ha watershed in the cal- careous Wasatch Moim tains. At full pool the resei^voir is 5.6 km long, 60 m deep, and cov- ers 277 ha (Table 1). The resei-voir is produc- tive, with a mean summer (May-Oct) chloro- ph\\ll a concentration of 5.4 mg/ni'^ (1985-86 and 1989-90 mean), and a mean Secchi depth of 4.6 m (W.

Trout grow quickly in East Canyon Reser- voir and enter the fishery within 5 nion. The reservoir is intensively fished due to its prox- imity to 2 major population centers, Salt Lake City and Ogden. Creel sui'veys in the 1970s indicated fishing effort at over 300 angler- hha~^yr~^ Because anglers fish primarily with bait, there is little catch-and-release fish- ing. Most trout captured are less than 350 mm. Schrader (1988), Babey and Beny (1989), and Tabor and Wurtsbaugh (1991) provide additional information on the fish and fishery. (Merritt et al. 1980), and mean water column TP is 80 )ag/L (Utah Department of Health 1982). Algal growth in the reservoir, however, is limited primarily by nitrogen (Wurtsbaugh 1988). The reservoir's water level fluctuates widely because of water withdrawals for irri- gation, and consequently there is little macro- phyte development in the littoral zone. During much of the summer, oxygen concentrations in the hypolimnion drop below 1 mg/L. Epilim- netic temperatures reach 22°C in July, and the reservoir is typically ice covered from late December through March. During much of the year high densities (>10/L) oi Daphnia pulex, D. galeota, and other crustacean zoo- plankton are evident (Tabor and Wurtsbaugh 1991, W. Wurtsbaugh unpublished data). Additional limnological information is given in Table 1. Dominant fishes in the lake, in approximate order of biomass, are Utah suckers {Catosto- mus ardens), redside shiners {Richardsonius balteatus), and rainbow trout {Oncorhynchus mykiss). Less-abundant species are cutthroat trout (O. clarki), brown trout {Salmo trutta), speckled dace {Rhinichthys osculiis), fathead mii.nows {Pimephales promelas), and kokanee (O. .lerka). Rainbow tiout are heavily parasitized by anchor worms {Lernaea cyprinacea- Berry et al. 1991). In late May the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources stocks 300,000 (1080/ha) rainbow trout, approximately 75 mm in length, in East Canyon Reservoir. Fish captured by anglers during our 1986 creel survey were derived from several strains of rainbow trout stocked in 1984-1986 (Table 2). Each strain stocked in the reservoir was spray marked with a differ- Methods Creel data were collected during 1970, 1972, and 1986 by interviewing anglers and by count- ing the total number of anglers on the reser- voir. Sampling effort was stratified by weekday and weekend, month, time of day (morning, midday, and evening), and method of fishing (ice, shore, and boat), with random samples taken within each stratum (Malvestuto 1983). The creel clerk determined the number of fish released and the number, length, and weight (1986 only) of each species or strain kept. In 1986, 25% of the weights were not measured. These were subsequently estimated with an empirically derived length-weight regression for rainbow trout: W = 1.619 10-5 • TL2 949 ; fi2 = 0.95, where W = wet weight in grams and TL = total length in mm. Sample estimates were expanded to provide monthly and seasonal totals for fish harvests and angler use. Details of the methods varied somewhat be- tween surveys in the 1970s and those in 1986. In 1986 we sampled 5 weekdays and 4 week- end/holidays each month of the year In 1970 and 1972 the sampling inteival lasted only fi-om opening day (Memorial Day weekend) through August. Creel surveys in 1970 and 1972 were done on both days of the opening weekend: during the remainder of the sampling period the reservoir was randomly censused on 20 (1970) or 48 d (1972). Because catch infomiation was unavailable for the September-November periods in 1970 and 1972, we restricted com- parison with the 1986 catch statistics to the Januaiy-August intei^val.

During 1986 we identified fluorescent- marked rainbow strains using a portable, bat- teiy-powered black light affixed within a light- exclusion box. Fish captured during the year they were planted were designated age 0, and those captured during the 2nd and 3rd year after planting as age 1 and age 2, respectively. We analyzed creel data with the FORTRAN program WCREEL, supplied by the Utah Divi- sion of Wildlife Resources (B. Schmidt personal communication). Temporal changes in trout abundance in a put-grow-and-take fisheiy such as that in East Canyon Reservoir can be evaluated by the number of fish removed from the system by anglers because relativeK' little mortality occins from other factors after trout attain a harvest- able size. For example, estimated losses of all sizes of trout to birds, which has been shown to bc> important in some Utah resenoirs (Waso- wicz 1991) and elsewhere (Matkowski 1989), accounts for approximately 6% of planted trout in East Canyon Reservoir (R. A. Tabor unpub- lished data). Piscivorous fish eat over 25% of stocked trout, but this loss is negligible once prey reach 150 mm (Wiu-tsbaugh 1987 and unpublished data). Furthermore, because the reser\\()ir has a deep release, located in the hyi^olimnion, we believe that few fish emigrate, although we lack quantitative data to support this. Had we used this approach to estimate abun- dance of trout planted in 1985 that reached harvestable size, we would have required creel data from at least 3 consecutive years (1985-1987), or until anglers had removed all of the cohort. Because we measured harvest only during 1986, and thus lacked a long-term data set, we assumed that harvests of age 0 fish in 1985 and age 2 fish in 1987 were simi- lar to the measured harvest of age 0 (stocked 1986) and age 2 (stocked 1984) fish during 1986. Because 80-90% of each strain was har- \\'ested as age-1 fish (see below), violations of this assumption should not have seriously affected our analysis. To determine the effect of trout densit\\' in the reservoir on monthly success rates for anglers, we graphed the estimated density of fish remaining to be captured from the 1985 cohort against catch per hour for fish in that cohort. At the beginning of the survey in Janu- ar>' 1986, we estimated that 67,400 fish from the 1985 cohort were available in the reser- voir This density was based on total catch of the cohort in 1986 plus an additional 9000 fish estimated to have survived into 1987. Nine thousand (3%) of the 1984 cohort sunived over 1 yr and were captured by anglers in 1986. Fish densities for subsequent months were calculated b>' subtracting the previous month's 1996] Trout Yield in Utah Reservoir 15 liarvest. The resulting regression from tliis analysis may include some bias, since mea- surements of fish densities each month were not independent of each other For this reason we did not calculate statistical significance levels for the regression. Nevertheless, the approach yields a useful estimate of the rela- tionship between abundance and catch rates. To estimate the mortality of trout that were captured and then released by anglers, we assumed a survival rate of 69% (Taylor and White 1992). Because sizes and ages of these released fish were unknown, we assigned pro- portions to the different year classes. Our inter- views with anglers indicated the main reason fish were released was because of small size, but a limited number were also returned be- cause of the presence of ectoparasites {Lernaea) or their scars. We therefore assumed that 90% of returned fish were age 0 (i.e., returned be- cause of small size), 10% were age 1 (returned for cosmetic reasons), and no age 2 were returned. Results The Fisheiy Under a Six-month Season Under the 6-mon open season documented in 1970 and 1972, fishing was concentrated from the opening weekend in late May through August. Fishing on the opening week- end accounted for 16-21% of the estimated total effort, and 28-38% of the rainljow trout harvest (Table 3). Fishing pressure dropped steadily through the summer, and catch rates varied from 0.18 to 0.49 trout/li. Total fishing effort was similar in 1970 and 1972, with the lake providing over 350 angling-h/ha. Anglers harvested an estimated 60,100 rainbow trout during the survey period in 1970, but only 35,600 in 1972 (Table 4). The catch rate for rainbow trout in July 1972 was much lower than in other months. This was due, in part, to anglers fishing for kokanee and a strain of albino rainbow trout that made up 44% of the July hai-vest. The total catch rate of 0.32 fish/h was comparable to other months of the year when kokanee and albino trout were har- vested less (4% of the catch in June and 9% in August). The Year-round Fishery Trout grew rapidly in East Canyon Reser- voir, particularly during their 1st year (Fig. 1). Fish were planted in May at a mean size of 75 mm and 3.8 g. When they first entered the fisheiy in July, they were 178 mm and 77 g. By July, the previous year's cohort of fish had reached 305 mm and 420 g. By the end of the 3rd year, fish had reached 400 mm and 728 g. In 1986 anglers spent over 230,000 h (±9300, .sy) fishing in East Canyon Resei-voir, or 840 angler-hha\"lyr\"l. Most of these hours were by shore anglers (58%), followed by boat Table 3. Pressure, harvest, and catch rates for rainbow trout for creel surveys conducted in 1970, 1972, and 1986 for the January-August period. Eadier surveys lasted only fiom the opening weekend (Memorial Day — the last weekend in May) through August. In 1986 the state changed to a year-round season, so there was no opening day. Only the Janu- ary-August data of 1986 are shown here to facilitate comparisons between the 2 periods. Total catch for the year is shown in Table 4.

The relative dis- tribution of angling type varied seasonally; In January and February, nearly all fishing was done through the ice, but subsequent fishing pressure was dominated by boat and particu- larly shore anglers (Fig. 2A). Total fishing pres- sure reached a peak during May, the period of the traditional opening day. Monthly catch rates for rainbow trout var- ied from a high of 1.06 fish/angler-h in Febru- ary to 0.18 in July (Fig. 2B). Annual catch rates were 0.92 for ice anglers, 0.34 for boat anglers, and 0.30 fish/h for shore anglers. The average for all types of fishing was 0.42 fish/h. Catch rates for ice anglers in Januaiy and Februaiy were the highest for any month or method for the year (Fig. 2B). There was a strong relationsliip between the estimated density of trout from the 1985 cohort remaining to be captured and monthly catch rates for those fish (Fig. 3). In Januaiy and Februaiy when there were more than 200 fish/ha (0.2 fish/m^) in the reservoir, catch rates were over 0.6 fish/angler-h. As densities dropped, however, catch rates declined pro- gressively, reaching a low of 0.1 fish/angler-h in December. We estimate that 99,300 ± 7500 (sy) game fish were removed from East Canyon Reser- voir by anglers in 1986. Of these, 99.1% were rainbow trout, 0.7% were cutthroat trout, 0.1% were kokanee salmon, and <0.1% were brown trout. Sixty-eight percent of the annual har- vest of rainbow trout occurred from Januar\\' through May, and 38%; of these were captured in January and Februaiy during the ice-fishing season (Fig. 2C). Rainbow trout planted the previous year (1985) dominated the catch from Januaiy to August of 1986 (Fig. 2C).

Although age 0 and age 2 fish were important in the fishen' eaiK' and late in the year, 78% of the total catch was of age 1 fish from the 1985 planting.

Hai-vest of Different Strains Four strains were in the reservoir during 1986 as a result of stocking in 1984, 1985, and 1986 (Table 2). Relative proportions of each strain harvested fluctuated seasonally. McConaughy strain from the 1984 stock and Kamloop trout from 1985 were captured more than expected in the winter and spring catches of 1986. In the summer, however, catch rates of Kamloop and Ten Sleep from the 1985 stocking were similar for the rest of the year. Shepherd of the Hills strain stocked in 1985 was han'ested less than the other two strains planted that year. During 1986 there were sig- nificant differences in harvest rates of differ- ent strains planted in 1984 (X^ = 13.34, p < 0.05) and in 1985 (X^ = 7.76, P < 0.05), but not in 1986. A large percentage of each strain stocked in the reservoir was eventually captured by anglers. There were, however, considerable dif- ferences in relative return of different strains. We estimate that 40% of Kamloop, 32% of Ten Sleep, and only 23% of Shepherd of the Hills strain were captured during their first 2 1/2 yr in the reservoir (Fig. 4). For all strains com- bined, 32% of the fish stocked were eventually captured by anglers. 18 Great Basin Naturalist [Volume 56 ^ 1.U ' T ' 1 ■ O F X ^ 0.8 . _ z y <n / ^ J H 0.6 - - c o z y^ M o O 0.4 - ^^ A - U) eo y 0) >^ ;;: 0.2 - \"osXi - 0 J/* J 9 lU \" Y - 0.0053 ♦ 0.0031 X r - 0.79 3 O. n n ^_^ . 1 > 1 ■ 100 200 TROUT DENSITY (No. / Ha) 300 Fig. 3.

Discussion The fishing regulation change in East Can- yon Resei-voir resulted in an excellent winter ice fishery but poorer summer angling than when a 6-mon season was in effect. In 1970 and 1972 anglers harvested 30-37% of the annual total during the intensive 3-d opening (Table 3), but large numbers of fish still remained in the lake to support a summer fish- ery with catch rates of 0.3-0.5 fish/h. In 1986, however, about 66% of the fish had been har- vested in the winter and spring fisheiy by the time of the traditional opening day. Monthly estimates of pressure during the summer fish- ery (June-August) for 1986 were similar to those in the earlier studies (Table 3), but the sununer harvest was only 33-64% of that in previous years. While failing to maintain the tiaditional catch rate for summer months, the regulation change may have provided a fishery that not only pro- duced increased numbers offish over a longer period of time, but also provided almost twice as many hours of recreational fishing as under the 6-mon open season (Table 3). If the popu- larity of winter angling were to increase sub- stantially, an even larger proportion of trout would be captured then, leaving fewer for the traditional spring and summer fisheries. To spread the catch over a longer period, the State of Utah reduced the winter bag limit to 4 fish subsequent to our study. The differences noted under the different angling regulations must be treated cautiously, however, as only 1 yr of data was available for the year-round season, and substantial between-year differences were noted for the 1970 and 1972 period. Factors such as changing predation pressure from pisci- vores and changes in nutrient loading to the reservoir undoubtedly also contributed to changes in the fishery. Catch rates for the 1985 cohort of fish were clearly related to monthly changes in the den- sity of these fish (Fig. 3), but there may have been additional factors influencing fishing success. Catch rates in February were higher than the prediction based on density'. The rea- son for this is not clear, but it is possible that catch rates were especially high during mid- winter when available food was low. Catch rates in June-August were somewhat below the regression, perhaps because during warm months of the year fish are concentrated in deeper water near the thermocline where they are more difficult for anglers to reach. Catch rates increased, relative to the regression, in the fall (September-November) when the reser- voir began to cool. Despite relative minor sea- sonal shifts, it appears that densities of rain- bow trout available in the reservoir can explain most of the variation in catch rates. Significant differences in the relative har- vest of different strains of rainbow trout were not unexpected, as others have found that strains stocked can have large effects on the fisheiy (e.g., Brauhn and Kincaid 1982, Babe\\' and Berry 1989). The poor return for Shep- herd of the Hills strain (Table 2) is consistent with the poor return of this group in East Canyon Reservoir reported by Babey and Beny (1989). Nevertheless, 2 factors confound the interpretation of these results. First, despite efforts to control sizes offish planted, there were sometimes substantial differences in weights of different strains stocked. For each annual cohort, the relative return of a strain was correlated with its size at stocking (Table 2); groups stocked at a large size usualh sunived better than smaller ones. Second, because our creel survey lasted only 1 yr, we could not determine if some strains entered the fisheiy as (luickK as others. For example, the veiy high relatixe return rate of the McConaughy strain in 1986 may be a consequence of a very low catch rate of these fish measured in 1984 and 1996] Tkout Yield in Utah Rkseuvoiii 19 30- ^ 20 H -I 3 10 - El KAMLOOP A— TEN SLEEP ---«-- SHEPHERD T T ?

The creel sun'ey was conducted for only 12 mon, but data were expanded to cover a longer period by using information on other cohorts (see te.\\t). 1985 (Schrader 1988). Consequently, in our study and in many others (see Babey and Berry 1989) that have investigated the importance of fish strains, results are confounded because strain size and condition were not carefully controlled, and because the harvest of fishes was not measured over their entire life span. The fish yield of 102 kg/ha in East Canyon Reservoir is among the highest yet reported for a temperate zone lake (Morgan et al. 1980, Jones and Hoyer 1982, Schlesinger and Regier 1982) and is as high as yields in many tropical systems (Morgan et al. 1980). It is also high in relation to clilorophyll levels in the lake. Regres- sions with summer chlorophyll levels would predict yields ranging from 4 to 13 kg/ha, de- pending on the model chosen (Ogelsby 1977, Jones and Hoyer 1982; see Carline 1986). A model based on total phosphoiiis would predict salmonid production of only 22 kg/h (Plante and Downing 1993), so the realized yield of 102 kg/ha is far above expectations (Downing and Plante 1993). Even when the weight of fish stocked (5 kg/ha) is subtracted from total yield, hai-vest from this cold-water reservoir is still remarkably high. Several characteristics of the reservoir and fishery may contribute to the high yield. First, high nutrient loading (Merritt et al. 1980) pro- duces high algal productivity that in turn sup- ports a large zooplankton population domi- nated by Daphnia (this, however, does not explain why fish production is higher than that predicted by chlorophyll or phosphorus levels). Second, rainbow trout in East Canyon Reser- voir are primarily first-order carnivores, feed- ing throughout most of their lives on large Daphnia spp. (Tabor et al. in press). They begin feeding on other fish only when they exceed about 370 mm total length (Wurtsbaugh 1987). Third, the management agency takes full ad- vantage of high productivity by stocking large numbers of fish. Fourth, with intense fishing pressure, most of the trout are hai-vested thor- oughly and quickly while they are growing rapidly (Fig. 1). The combined effects of high reservoir productivity, high stocking density, trout feeding close to the base of the food web, and intensive fishing pressure contribute to the very high fish yield. Although East Canyon Reservoir has pro- vided exceptional trout yields, there are indi- cations that high nutrient loading from resi- dential and recreational development in the headwaters of the drainage may be pushing the fisheiy toward collapse. Because the reser- voir is already mesoeutrophic, increased pro- ductivity resulting from development may fur- ther deplete oxygen in the hypolimnion and metalimnion. Oxygen and temperature pro- files we took in July and August 1985 and 1986 demonstrated that water with O2 con- centrations >5 /xg/L was found only at depths above 10 m where temperatures were above 20 Great Basin Naturalist [Volume 56 18° C. Summer metalimnetic and hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations in 1985 and 1986 were much lower than reported for the reservoir during 1978-1980 (Merritt et al. 1980, Utah Department of Health 1982). When oxygen is lost from these layers, fish are forced into the warm epilimnetic water. Because optimal tem- peratures for rainbow trout are near 15-18° C (Hokanson et al. 1977, Wurtsbaugh and Davis 1977), and because O2 concentrations for salmonids should be at or above 5 /Ltg/L (Brett 1979, EPA 1986), the situation in East Canyon Reservoir may become too stressful for rain- bow trout, and they may be squeezed into a narrow metalimnion where conditions are sub- optimal. Indications that trout are stressed include poor growth in midsummer (Fig. 1; Babey and Beny 1989), increases in Lernaea infestation from 20/fish in the 1970s to 40/fish in the late 1980s (T. Pettengill unpublished data), and complete failure of the 1989 and 1991 year-classes subsequent to our field study. Loss of salmonid fisheries with increasing eutrophication is common (Colby et al. 1972). Consequently, urban planners and fisheiy man- agers should limit reservoir nutrient loading to maintain adequate summer oxygen levels and thus ensure that the outstanding family fisheiy for salmonids in the resei'voir is maintained.

Fielding^-, M. A. Brusvenl, and L. P Kish^ Abstract. — Consumption of diffuse knapweed {Centaurea diffusa Lam.) by 2 polyphagous grasshopper species, Melanoplus sanguinipes (E) and Oedaleonotus enigma (Scudder), was studied using microhistological analysis of grasshopper crop contents. Grasshoppers were confined to cages containing C. diffusa and Sisymbrium altissimum L., a member of the mustard family known to be readily eaten by these 2 grasshopper species. Preference indices for knap- weed were lower than for S. altissimum in 4 of 5 trials. An uncaged population of A/, sanguinipes on a knapweed-infested site consumed only small amounts of knapweed until late summer when most other plants were senescent. Results sug- gest that diffuse knapweed's low palatability to generalist herbivores may confer to it a competitive advantage over other rangeland plants. Key words: Centaurea diffusa Lam., diffuse knapweed, herbivory, insects, competition. Diffuse and spotted knapweed, Centaurea diffusa Lam. and C. maculosa Lam., respec- tively, were introduced to the Pacific North- west around 1900 (Watson and Renney 1974). Since then they have rapidly spread through- out the area (Fig. 1; Forcella and Hai-vey 1981). Heavy infestations of knapweed reduce produc- tion of more desirable species of forage plants, thus reducing the value of rangeland for graz- ing and wildlife habitat. Several specialist insect herbivores have been introduced in attempts to control knapweed (Story and Ander- son 1978, Maddox 1979). To date, no studies have reported on the consumption of knapweed by polyphagous insect herbivores. Cnicin, a sesquiteipene lactone, is produced by spotted and diffuse knapweed (Drodz 1966, Locken and Kelsey 1987). Pieman (1986) sug- gested that sesquiterpene lactones have toxic effects on many herbivores and may function as deterrents to herbivoiy Locken and Kelsey (1987) suggested that nonpalatability of knap- weeds may afford them a competitive advantage over many other plant species by protecting them from herbivoiy. (grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae) are a conspicuous and important class of herbivores on rangeland in the \\\\'est- em U.S. Rangeland grasshopper populations in south- ern Idaho occasionally reach outbreak propor- tions. Two species in particular, Melanoplus sanguinipes (F). and Oedaleonotus enigma (Scudder), are capable of attaining very high densities (>30/m-). Both species feed upon a broad range of forbs (Brusven and Lamley 1971, Banfill and Brusven 1973, Sheldon and Rogers 1978). Pfadt (1992) suggested that an increase in introduced weeds is a factor lead- ing to outbreaks of O. enigma. Fielding and Brusven (1993) found that both species prefer disturbed rangeland habitats dominated by e.xotic annual plants. This study assessed the utilization of diffuse knapweed as food by these 2 grasshopper species to determine if knap- weed represents a significant and expanding resource for grasshoppers and if grasshopper herbivor)' may be a constraint to knapweed populations. Previous studies (Brusven and Lamle\\ 1971) have shown Sisymbrium altissimmn L., an intro- duced annual forb, to be preferred by many forb-feeding grasshoppers. Both species of weeds initiate growth as a basal rosette of leaves and later develop erect, sparsely leaved stems that bear flowers. Because C. diffusa is usually a biennial, it does not develop beyond the basal rosette until the 2nd year Sisymbrium alfissi}num constituted a large proportion of the forbs present in this stud)'; therefore utili- zation of C. diffusa and S. altissinuim was compared.

Materials and Methods The study site is about 3 km south of Sho- shone, Idaho (Lincoln County), in a knapweed- infested area that had been seeded with crested wheatgrass {Agropyron ciistatum [L.] Gaertn.) in 1975. Grasshopper food preferences were identified by microhistological analysis of grass- hopper crop contents (Brusven and Mulkern 1960, Sparks and Malechek 1968, Fielding and Bnisven 1992). Grasshoppers were confined to cages so that relative amounts of different plant species could be precisely determined. Five trials were conducted during the summer of 1989: O. enigma 4th- and 5th-instar nymphs in early June; O. enigma adults and M. san- guinipes 4th and 5th instars in late June; M. sanguinipes adults in July and again in August. For each trial, 4 wire-mesh (5-mm pore size), conical cages covering 0.5 m^ each were placed in the field such that at least 1 plant each of C. dijfiisa and Sisymbrium altissimiim L., along with assorted common grasses, occurred within each cage. Twelve to 15 grasshoppers of a sin- gle species were placed in each cage. Grass- hoppers used in the tests were collected from rangeland and placed in the cages within 20 h of collection. A 4-d interval was estimated to be sufficient to completely void previous meals and to accurately assess preferences in choice tests. After 4 d, 10 grasshoppers were removed from each cage and immediately preserved in 95% ethanol for crop analysis. Species composition of plants in each cage was determined on an air-dry basis by clipping and sorting by species aboveground portions of plants in each cage after each trial. Clipped plants were stored in air-tight plastic bags, and fresh weight was obtained within 4 h of clip- ping. Clipped plants were then allowed to air- dry until they quit losing weight (10-15 d), after which dry weights were obtained (to the nearest 0.1 g). Percent moisture of above- ground portions of each plant species was then determined. Plants were rated after each trial according to phenology as follows: 1, vegetative growth only; 2, flowering; 3, seed set; 4, seed maturity; 5, senescent or dormant (USDA-Soil Conser- vation Service 1976). Grass species present included Poa sandbergii Vasey, Bromus tecto- riim L., and Agropyron cristatum. Centaurea dijfusa and S. altissimum composed about 97% of aboveground biomass of forbs. Both 1st- and 2nd-year C. diffusa were present in each of the cages. Other forbs present were Helian- thus annuus L., Lactuca serriola L., and Epilo- bium L. sp. Grasshopper crops were removed and the contents mounted on glass slides in glycerin and safranin stain. Plant fragments in the crops were identified by comparing them with refer- ence slides made from fragments of known plants collected at the study site, similar to the methods described by Fielding and Brusven (1992). Frequency counts were made for each plant species by determining their presence or absence in 20 microscope viewing fields per grasshopper crop. Trichomes, hairs, and pollen were not counted. Frequencies from the 10 grasshoppers per cage were summed. Relative frequency was calculated by dividing the fre- quency of a plant species by the total fre- quency of all plant species (Sparks and Malechek 1968, Pfadt and Lavigne 1982). Holecheck and Gross (1982) demonstrated the 24 Great Basin Naturalist [Volume 56 near equivalence of relative frequency to actual diy weight percentage of plants consumed. Relative availability of different plant species within an area has been shown to influence diet composition in many grasshopper species (Ueckert et al. 1972, Mitchell 1975). To account for the effect of availability on consumption, preference values for plant species constitut- ing more than 10% of either cage or crop con- tents were calculated by dividing relative fre- quency of a plant species in the crops by that species' percentage of the dry-weight of all plants within the cages (Ueckert and Hansen 1971). A preference value >1 indicates feed- ing in greater proportion to the plant's avail- ability, whereas a preference value <1 indi- cates low preference in relation to a plant's availability. Possibly, total diy weight of a plant may not accurately portray the amount of plant mater- ial available to grasshoppers, thus introducing bias into the preference values. In this study our obsei\"vations indicated that both species of weeds had similar ratios of leaves to stems. Also, we have obsei^ved grasshoppers feeding on stems of both weed species. Because we had no way to determine more precisely exactly what proportion of the plant was avail- able as food to the grasshoppers, we used total aboveground biomass as a reasonably objec- tive measure of availability. The presence of Ist-year rosettes of C dijfusa in the cages ensured that each replication included a rep- resentative choice of plant material. Differences bet\\\\'een plant species in rela- tive frequency and preference values were tested using the Wilcoxon 2-sample test (PROC NPARIWAY, SAS 1985), with each cage rep- resenting 1 replication. Comparisons between plant species were made for each trial of a sin- gle grasshopper species and with data from different trials pooled by grasshopper species. The same statistical methods were also used to test for differences in relative frequency and preference values between grasshopper species for C. diffusa and S. (dtissimurn. Food selection was monitored in an uncaged population of M. sanguiwipes near the cage study. Thirty to 50 individuals were collected on each of 5 dates from June through October from an area of ca 1 ha infested with knap- weed. Food preference in this population was determined by microhistological methods de- scribed above. Plant species composition at the site was determined by visual estimates, in 5% incre- ments, of the ground cover of each plant species in forty 0.1-m- quadrats, arranged in 4 transects of 10 quadrats each. Ground cover estimates were made in July and again in October after precipitation caused abundant germination of cheatgrass. Because accurate estimates of food axailability (biomass) in the field were not available, preference values were not calculated and the results are presented for comparative puiposes only. Results Cages were placed such that C. diffusa was equally as abundant as or more abundant than S. altissimum in each trial (Table 1). Percentage moisture of both species of weeds declined throughout the season (Table 1). Sisijmhnum altissimum tended to be slightly more advanced phenologically than C. diffusa throughout the season, partly due to the presence of Ist-year rosettes of C. diffusa in the cages, but also because of earlier flowering bv S. altissimum (Tlible 1). Although C. diffusa constituted a substan- tial percentage (10-46%) of the caged grass- hoppers diet, preference values for C. diffusa were <1 in eveiy trial, indicating that it was not consumed in proportion to its diy weight composition within the cages (Table 1). Prefer- ences values for S. altissimum were > 1 in each trial, indicating that it was consumed in pro- portions greater than its relative availability. After flowering in Jul\\', a large portion of the C. diffusa plant material in the crops of i\\/. sanguinipes consisted of floral parts (44% and 30% of the C diffusa material consumed, in the July and August trials, respectively). Other forbs represented in in situ caged trials were not present in sufficient quantity to ade- (|uately assess their preference values. More S. altissimum than C. diffusa was con- sumed b>' grasshoppers in 3 of the 5 trials (Table 1). Preference values for S. altissimum were greater than those for C. diffusa in 4 of the trials (Table 1). Combining data from the 3 trials with M. sanguinipes, crop contents and preference values for S. altissimum, 42% and 2.0, respectively, were greater than for C. dif- fusa, 16% and 0.5, respecti\\'el\\' (Wilcoxon test, P < 0.01 for both tests).

There was no difference in con- sumption by O. enigma between S. altissimum and C. diffusa, 48% and 27%, respectively (Wilcoxon test, P > 0.05). There were no dif- ferences between the 2 species of grasshop- pers in relative frequency or preference values for either S. altissimum or C. diffusa (Wilcoxon test, F > 0.10 for both comparisons). Of the grass species, only Bromus tectorum was eaten in greater proportion than its per- centage of air-dry biomass. Even though O. enigina is generally considered to be a forb- feeder (Sheldon and Rogers 1978, Pfadt 1992), B. tectorum constituted 32% of the diet of O. e7iigma in early June (Table 1). Adult O. enigma in late June ate very little B. tectorum. Melanop- lus sanguinipes consumed B. tectorum through- out the summer, with 4-27% of its diet com- posed of B. tectorum, even though the grass was completely senescent by 26 June (Table 1). 26 Great Basin Naturalist [Volume 56 Table 2.

Knapweed was the most common forb grow- ing on the site where the uncaged population of M. sanguinipes was studied (Table 2). In June, S. oltissimiDn was the largest single food item, but consumption declined as the season pro- gressed. Knapweed was a substantial food item, especially in August and September when it remained succulent after other forbs had dried. After rainfall stimulated germination of B. tec- toriim in late September and October (Table 2), it became the primaiy food item for M. san- guinipes, and forbs constituted onb' a minor portion of the diet. Discussion The evolutionar)' histoiy of an herbivorous species, by shaping its food habits and other life history traits, determines its present rela- tionships with exotic plant species. The 2 grass- hopper species in this study consume a wide variety of plants, especialK' forbs (Banfill and Brusven 1973, Sheldon and Rogers 1978, Pfadt 1992), and will readily accept exotic plant species. Melunophis sangninipcs is a veiy oppor- tiniistic feeder Egg hatch in this species is often spread out over a long period, resulting in a large proportion of a population maturing dur- ing the diy periods typical of late summer in the intermoimtain region. At such times man\\ late-maturing plants that still retain some suc- culence, such as rabbitbrush, sagebrush, and some lupine species, are primary food items for M. sanguinipes. The results of this stud> indicate that this was the case with C. diffusa: even though it was not highly preferred 1)\\ M. sanguinipes, it was a major food item in late summer when most other plants were dry. SisyniJjriuni alfissiinuin tended to become sene- scent earlier than C. dijfusa, which would re- duce the qualit)' of S. altissimum relative to C. dijfusa, especially when Ist-year rosettes, con- sisting mostly of leaves, are considered. Locken and Kelsey (1987) reported that cnicin concentrations in C. maculosa xaiy con- siderably within and among indi\\ idual knap- weed plants. Cnicin is stored within glandular trichomes on the surface of knapweed tissues. Highest concentrations of cnicin were found in leaves surrounding the inflorescence. Only trace quantities were found by Locken and Kelsc)' (1987) in the stem epidermis and flow- ers. Leaf concentrations were lowest in spring and increased with flo\\\\ ering. We assume that cnicin concentrations in C. dijfusa follow much the same pattern. Variability in cnicin concen- tration may result in selective consumption by grasshoppers of knajDweed tissues w ith low cnicin concentrations. Our results suggest that this is the case: In late-summer trials much of the knapweed tissue consimied by grasshoppers consisted of flo\\\\'ers. This implies that during years of high grasshopper densities, feeding by grasshoppers, especialK' on the flowers, could result in a modest reduction in seed production in this plant. Residts of this stud)' pro\\'ide support for the h> pothesis that knapweed is protected from herbivoiy by its chemical constituents (Pieman 1986, Locken and Kelsey 1987). When com- pared to S'. altissimum, diffuse knapweed was a 2nd-choice food item for these generalist grasshopper species. Its low palatability may confer a competitive acKantage to knapweed when herl)i\\on' is a strong selection factor. .\\lthough it is conceivable fliat at high densities grasshoppers may consume significant amounts of knapweed and reduce seed production, man> other plants would be affected to a greater degree, thus reducing competition to knapweed. 1996] Knapweed Consumption by Giusshoppers 27 Grasshopper species used in this trial are the dominant species contributing to outbreaks in soutliern Idaho. It appears that increasing knapweed infestations do not represent a sig- nificant increase in food resources for these grasshoppers. However, because knapweed stays green longer during the summer than many other rangeknid phmts, it may provide sustenance for polyphagous grasshoppers dur- ing kvte-summer droughts in southern Idaho.
