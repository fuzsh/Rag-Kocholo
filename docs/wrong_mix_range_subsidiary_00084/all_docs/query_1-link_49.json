        "text": "The study reports a systematic account of 68 species of Odonata from Varadoor, a village in Kannur, North Kerala, South India. Of the 68 species reported, 30 are damselfies and 38 dragonflies. Pseudagrion decorum (Rambur, 1842), Ischnura senegalensis (Rambur, 1842), Agriocnemis keralensis Peters, 1981, Prodasineura verticalis (Selys, 1860), Elattoneura tetrica (Laidlaw, 1917), Onychothemis testacea Laidlaw, 1902 and Epophthalmia vittata Burmeister, 1839 are new records from Kannur. Paracercion calamorum (Ris ,1916) is a very rare odonate of Kerala. It has been recorded for the first time from North Kerala in this study. Pseudagrion indicum Fraser, 1924, Euphaea fraseri (Laidlaw, 1920) and Microgomphus souteri Fraser, 1924 are endemic to Western Ghats.\n\nBelihuloya situated in a biogeographical transition zone in south-central Sri Lanka is being threatened by land-use changes. Establishing baseline biodiversity knowledge of an indicator taxon within this lesser explored area, the present study systematically assessed its Odonate fauna in different habitat types through a transect survey supplemented with incidental observations. Further, the morphology of larvae and exuvia of some Odonates were opportunistically documented from selected water bodies. Transect survey and opportunistic observations identified 36 species of Odonates (22 dragonflies and 14 damselflies) representing ten families, with ten Sri Lankan endemics. Four species of dragonflies and eight damselflies are nationally threatened, including critically endangered Elattoneura centralis and endangered Libellago greeni. The calculated species richness (R), Shannon-Wiener diversity (H’), evenness (E) and Simpson’s diversity (1/D) values were, 3.51, 2.40, 0.85 and 7.90 for dragonflies, and 2.85, 2.36, 0.92 and 8.68 for damselflies respectively, while two groups show vertical niche segregation. Low Odonate community similarity coefficients among habitat types indicate they are complementary for conservation planning. Out of ten Odonate species for which larval stages were recorded, the larval morphology of Anax indicus and Gynacantha dravida are described for the first time in Sri Lanka. Baseline data provided here are used for evidence-based conservation recommendations.\n\nThe diversity and ecological importance of insects makes them very valuable for studies of biodiversity. Dragonflies and Damselflies are the representatives of order Odonata. Odonates are an important amphibiotic invertebrate group depending on freshwater ecosystems for most of their life span. Victoria Park provides a good habitat for biodiversity of Dragonflies. Dragonfly variety in Victoria Park Reserve Forest was observed, where recorded a total of 17 species of Odonates. Libellulidae family is consisting of maximum number of genera and species followed by Aeshnidae, Gomphidae. Total 15 species of dragonflies are recorded belonging to 12 genera and 3 families. This is the first surveyed systematic record of dragonfly diversity in Victoria Park Reserve Forest, Bhavnagar District, Gujarat (21°44'48\"N 72°7'54\"E). Dragonfly observations on and recorded by transects once a week. Out of total dragonfly species examined, 9 (52.94%) are common and 8 (47.75%) are occasional the present study encourages the conservation of a wide range of dragonfly species in this area."
