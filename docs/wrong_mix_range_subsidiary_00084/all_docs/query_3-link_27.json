        "text": "This paper deals with conceptual and functional diversity of the Ombudsman Institution in Asia from comparative constitutional point of view. The author analyses ombudsman institution in Asia. Characteristics and definiton of Ombudsman made by European legal doctrine and also by the International Bar Association resolution was used as an starting point to set certain criteria upon which Asian ombudsman institutions are subject to comparative anaysis. Final part throws light on the prospects and problems of models, establishment and functioning of ombudsman institutions in Asia.\n\nAmong the challenges facing Greater China, the ombudsman is rarely, if ever, considered one of them. Yet this relatively innocuous institution can, under the right conditions, contribute much that is beneficial to standards in public administration. This is the first article to contrast the models of public sector ombudsman in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, drawing comparisons on such features as institutional function, constitutional and legal status, relationship with the executive branch, process, substantive powers, effectiveness and transparency. Even in a region as politically , constitutionally and economically associated as Greater China, four diverse models of ombudsman coexist. They display sharp differences from systemic function to institutional culture, and as the region is now on a path of convergence, these are differences which may soon have to be reconciled. That reconciliation would, as this article shows, require a major reconceptualisation and reconfiguration of administrative supervision in at least three of the jurisdictions under review.\n\nThe effectiveness of Ombudsman's activity has been the subject of various evaluations from reports of international organizations to books and articles written by practitioners and academia. All these emphasized the difficulty of designing an assessment fit-all model. Bearing this in mind, the aim of this article is to offer a critical evaluation of the effectiveness of Ombudsman's local offices on two components: accessibility, which relates to individuals, and cooperation, which concerns public administration authorities."
