2. The state has been able to provide water to 79% of the urban and 59% of the rural population and efforts are being made to cover the rest of the population. Accordingly a very ambitious project known as Kerala Water Supply Project (KWSP) was derived with support of International Corporation - Japan International Corporation Agency (JICA). Five Schemes under KWSP: •Trivandrum •Meenard •Cherthala (Kollam) •Kozhikode (Calicut) •Pattuvam (in Kannur District) KERALA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT (KWSP) & PATTUVAM SCHEME

3. KERALA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT (KWSP) • The Government of India is the borrower and the Kerala Water Authority is the executing Agency. This Project aims at rehabilitating and augmenting the water supply systems of two urban regions namely Kozhikode and Thiruvananthapuram and to construct new water supply systems for three rural regions namely, Pattuvam of Kannur district, Cherthala of Alappuzha district and Meenad of Kollam district. Pattuvam Scheme is the north most beneficial area from this massive project. • The international consultants M/s TEC consortium (with Black & Veatch, GKW, STC, CED) led by M/s Tokyo Engineering Consultants Company Ltd (TEC). Japan has been selected by the KWA to manage the implementation of the project.

4. Pattuvam Scheme KERALA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT (KWSP) & PATTUVAM SCHEME Kerala is a state located in southwestern India. Neighboring states include Karnataka to the north and Tamil Nadu to the south and east, and the Arabian Sea is to the west. Major cities include the state capital of Trivandrum (Thiruvanaputhram), Kollam, Cochin, Calicut (Kozhikode) and Kannur (Cannore). Kozhikode Scheme Cherthala Scheme Meenard Scheme Trivandrum Scheme

6. The Pattuvam Scheme is in Kannur District is the northern most area benefits with the KWSP. The objective of the scheme is to supply safe and potable water to 530,000 consumers in 10 villages, 7 semi-urban areas and 1 municipality in the Kannur District by constructing new facilities. Facilities include technical components for water abstraction, raw water transmission, water treatment, treated water transmission, storage reservoirs and distribution networks. The project area covers 350 km2 and the water demand of the area is estimated as 93 MLD. The source is at Pazhassi Barrage at Valapattanam River at Kuiloor and the method of extraction is by intake well. The raw water is boosted through steel pipe of 1100 mm diameter for a length of 11 km, to the Treatment Plant. The capacity of the Treatment Plant located at Peruvalathuparamba is 93 millions liters per day. PATTUVAM SCHEME

10. Project Highlights • About 1,000,000 cubic meters of earthwork; 720 kilometres of pipelines; 25,000 cubic meters of concrete and 2000 tonnes of steel. Total project value is USD80 Million. • The project is unique in its nature and complexities, characterised by its spread across a large area. In view of the massiveness of the project and the complexities in the nature of the work components, it is a challenge and however essential and important for the Senior Resident Engineer to put in place a comprehensive project management, supervision, quality assurance and control during the implementation. • The Project is being executed following a fast track approach.
