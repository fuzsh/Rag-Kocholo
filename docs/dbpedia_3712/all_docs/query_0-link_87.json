        "text": "[FONT=&quot]2 May[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\npage 3 of 3[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 2012 – Zenaida Manfugás, Cuban born, American naturalized pianist, considered to be one of the best Cuban pianists in history, dies at age 80. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Zenaida Elvira González Manfugás was born on February 22, 193 in Guantanamo, Cuba. Her father was Amando González Veranés and her mother, Andrea Manfugás Crombet, was a renowned pianist and teacher. She had two sisters: Alicia and Aida Esther. Her mother is descended from Nene Manfugás, a renowned composer and performer of Sonnets in the early 20th century.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Her family moved to Baracoa, where her father was appointed municipal judge and her mother opened a music school affiliated with the Conservatorio Orbón. Manfugás and her sisters began piano lessons at age five, under their mother's tutelage. At age seven, Manfugás was able to play Mozart \"Coronation Mass\", and Beethoven \"Concerto 5\". Manfugás debuted in 1949 in Havana, in the Anfiteatro de Avenida del Puerto, with the Municipal Band conducted by master Gonzalo Roig, playing \"Concerto in A Minor\" by Edvard Grieg. This became a frequent venue for Manfugás.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]She studied in Santiago de Cuba. Three years after her debut, Manfugás received a scholarship to study in Spain. Journalist Agustín Tamargo had directed the attention of the then President of the Colegio de Belén University in Havana, Father Joseph Rubino, to the pianist and persuaded him to give her the scholarship. Roig then invited her to give a concert at Havana's Cathedral Square.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1952, at the age of 20, Manfugás left Cuba and enrolled at the Real Conservatorio Superior de Música de Madrid (Royal Conservatory of Music of Madrid) where she was under the tutelage of Professor Tomas Andrade de Silva. She performed concerts and premieres in Spain, where she released the Dos Danzas (two Dances), by Cuban composer Harold Gramatges in 1953. She then traveled to Paris to receive lessons from master Walter Gieseking.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]On her return to Cuba in 1958, she was finally scheduled to give a concert at the Auditorium Theater on December 21 that year. The organizers advised her to postpone it until January 9, 1959, but by then the country was in the revolutionary ferment of the triumph of Fidel Castro's guerrilla movement and the pianist had to keep waiting for her big presentation in Cuba. It was not until 1960, when the theater had already been named \"Amadeo Roldan,\" that she was able to play her music at the main concert hall of that country.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In Cuba she was appointed professor at the \"Alejandro García Caturla\" Conservatory in Marianao. Manfugás was very active as a pianist in Cuba, and sometimes accompanied classical orchestras, such as the National Symphony Orchestra and the National Chamber Orchestra. She performed concerts with the National Symphony Orchestra, and conducted multiple tours in Europe (in places like Belgium and Russia) and Asia (in countries like China and Japon), for which she was widely praised. Later, she also played in Canada. The pianist came to occupy the position of national advisory in the cathedra of piano at the Amadeo Roldan Conservatory in Havana, until the early 1970s, when she traveled to Spain, not returning to the island.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Manfugás came to United States in 1974, performing throughout the 50 states, settling in the country. In 1979, she visited Cuba for the last time.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In exile, Manfugás played her music in places like Spain, Paris, Italia, New York City and Miami. She also performed as a soloist in the New World Symphony in Miami and was professor at Kean University of New Jersey, where she taught History of Music. In December 2010, already ill, she was honored by the Apogee Foundation on Cultural Center Cuba Ocho of Miami. At that time she could not perform, as she was recovering from a recent surgery.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Her final performance in Miami, where she performed frequently, took place on May 22, 2011 with the musical work \"Tres pianos, Tres intérpretes\" (\"Three pianos, Three performers\"), a concert held at the Wertheim Center International University of Florida, where she alternated with the Jesus y Eugenia Ruspoli Armengol.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]She had cancer and suffered from several health complications. Zenaida Manfugás died in Elizabeth, New Jersey, where she had lived since 1974. According to different sources, she died due to a cardiac arrest or cancer. Her remains were cremated on Sunday May 13.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]She was established in Elizabeth, New Jersey in 1974. When she became a U.S. citizen, she adopted her mother's maiden name in her honor, since her mother had taught her how to play the piano. In 1955, she gave birth to a son in Spain, Andrés Montes, who over the years became one of the most popular sports journalists of radio and television in that country and who died in 2009 at age 53.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] The musician Gonzalo Roig said that Zenaida Manfugás was the best interpreter of Cuban music, and one of the best pianists that Cuba had produced, and Lecuona regarded her as the best interpreter of his music, for the special talent displayed in her rendering of his compositions.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]- [/FONT][FONT=&quot]She was a great reader and she took books from the library every month.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]- [/FONT][FONT=&quot]She never recorded a studio album. The recordings that exist were from live performances. Several compilation albums interpreting the works of Cuban composers were released. Two volumes were entitled Por siempre Lecuona (Lecuona Forever) (1999), compilations from multiple live performances. Those volumes contain the most popular works of the composer.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]- [/FONT][FONT=&quot]At the time of her death, she lived in a modest apartment for the elderly and, like many other masters of classical music, died in poverty.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2013 – Gordon Sherwood, American classical composer, dies at age 83. Known in Germany as the \"Beggar-Composer\", his works exhibit various early 20th-century European and American classical music styles, as well as showing influences from blues, Arabic, Indian and Asian music. The New York Philharmonic under Dmitri Mitropoulos gave his career a promising start as a prize-winning young composer at Carnegie Hall in 1957. Aaron Copland said he was \"his most gifted student\". He studied with famous teachers and won more awards and stipends in academia, but drifted into virtual anonymity until the mid-1990s. He began begging on the streets of Paris around 1980. A 1994 Norddeutscher Rundfunk/Arte feature-length television documentary \"Der Bettler von Paris\" exposed his life and work to German audiences, who were the first to hear his symphony and other works were premiered and recorded at the beginning of the 21st century.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Born in Evanston, Illinois to parents who he called \"frustrated musicians\", Sherwood was one of two children. His father, Emery, had studied music for a few semesters before becoming an accountant. Sherwood and his sister both learned to play piano as small children and showed exceptional talent, but much of his upbringing was outside the home as the parents removed both children from their home during childhood. They put the sister in a psychiatric hospital and sent him to military school. His parents called him a rebel and saw no value in his pursuit of becoming a composer. He changed schools twice after suffering abuse by a principal and fellow cadets.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He studied music at Western Michigan College and earned a Master of Music degree at the University of Michigan in 1955. In 1957 he won the 12th George Gershwin Memorial Award for \"Introduction and Allegro\", which were composed as the third and fourth movements of his First Symphony, Opus 3. The competition, whose laureates include many of the most successful post-war American composers of classical music such as Peter Mennin (1945) Ned Rorem (1948) and George Rochberg (1953), was judged by notable composers including Samuel Barber, Aaron Copland, Morton Gould, Gian-Carlo Menotti and awarded a Carnegie Hall premiere with a one-thousand dollar prize. Sherwood attended the Tanglewood Music Center, where he studied under Copland. A 1959 Fulbright Fellowship and two stipends from the Reemtsma Begabtenförderungswerk financed composition studies with Philipp Jarnach at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hamburg, Germany. During a break from his fellowship studies in Hamburg in 1960, Sherwood was arrested for vandalising an Elvis poster in the New York subway. According to his autobiography, he worked for a New York City music publisher. Out of frustration with his job, dispatching heavy boxes of sheet music orders that were mostly Elvis Presley's songs, he defaced a poster with red paint and profanity. This was the year in which his supporter, friend and father-figure, Dmitri Mitropoulos died. Sherwood's German girlfriend Ruth, pleaded to the judge for sympathy in consideration of their financial situation and his musical talent, for which she provided a copy of the N.Y. Philharmonic programm as proof, and he was let go. Ruth, herself a soprano, subsequently married Sherwood and after three years studying in Hamburg beginning in 1959, they moved to Rome where he studied for another six years. In 1964 he won first prize at the Accademia di Santa Cecilia where his teacher until 1967 was Goffredo Petrassi.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Upon returning to the United States after almost a decade of studies in Europe, Sherwood unsuccessfully solicited offers to teach music at the college and university level and then disappeared from the American and European musical scene, not to be heard from again until the mid 1990s. In 1968 he moved to Beirut and played in a piano bar. Other locations of brief residence included Cairo, Egypt, Israel, and Greece. When they could, he and his wife performed songs including his compositions together as a duo. During this period before 1970, he caught poliomyelitis, was briefly an inpatient in a psychiatric hospital, served several jail sentences and was deported from more than one country. In the 70s, he lived 8 years in Kenya and earned a degree in Swahili language. He continued to compose, with little regard for financial success, social standing or recognition. Support was provided by his parents in spite of their poor relationship to him since childhood. Fellow American composer George Crumb and University of Michigan alumnus also provided him with support.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1980 after his parents died, he left his wife in Africa, and traveled in India, Japan and Latin America (mostly Costa Rica). Years later, he found himself stranded and destitute in Paris, where he wrote music in a café while living in a small hotel room and begging on the streets. A 1994 NDR/Arte television documentary entitled \"Der Bettler von Paris [The Beggar of Paris]\" brought him some notoriety. He later referred to this practice as \"self-sponsorship\"; i.e. a means of compensation for his work. He not only put the money from begging towards daily needs, but also saved to finance travels and visits to places where he would seek inspiration for his compositions. His appearance was scraggy, he wore old, worn clothes, had a long beard and messy hair and was gaunt and toothless. He was a Buddhist and vegetarian for the last 40 or more years of his life, hated cars and did not have a driver's license. He recorded the details of this and other events documenting his inspiration, suffering and theoretical ideas in a 2000-page autobiography, which he wrote after the broadcast of \"Der Bettler von Paris\". He spoke many languages including Portuguese, Japanese, Greek and French and learned Russian after beginning his friendship to a Russian pianist in his 70s. As he aged, a network of friends made up of journalists, musicians and artists arranged for him to live in the community of Herzogsägmühle, near Peiting, Germany, where he continued composing. On July 1, 2006, pianist Masha Dimitrieva premiered four of his compositions there.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Sherwood died in Schongau, Germany after spending the last 8 years of his life in a nursing home in Herzogsägmühle.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The catalogue of Gordon Sherwood's works includes almost 150 entries, most of which have never been published or performed. It includes chamber music, works for orchestra, instrumental and vocal music of sacred and secular nature. Noted influences are Igor Stravinsky, Béla Bartók, American tradition, blues and oriental music. The conductor Werner Andreas Albert describes his music as \"very catchy, but not in the sense of trivial or easy to comprehend…it is also very complex.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 2000, his Piano Concerto, Opus 107 received its world premiere by piano soloist Masha Dimitrieva and the Bavarian State Youth Symphony Orchestra in Germany. The premiere performance of the complete first symphony, Opus 3, that of which the last two movements were played in the 1957 Carnegie Hall concert was recorded by the Bayerischer Rundfunk in 2002 and released together with Opus 107 and Sinfonietta together as a CD in 2004. Premieres of his compositions were also presented in MARTa Herford, Germany. \"Memories of Waters\", an oratorio in classical crossover style about the River Danube was co-written with the German world music band Dissidenten. The Philharmonic Orchestra of the Cottbus Theater premiered his Blues Symphony in May 2014.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2013 - It was announced that the Spice ..... musical Viva Forever! was to close at the end of June 2013. The production, which was written by Jennifer Saunders, suffered poor ticket sales after damning reviews.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2013 –[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Bob Rafkin,[/FONT][FONT=&quot] American singer, songwriter and acoustic guitar player, dies at age 69 (cancer).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Rafkin was born in New York City in 1944. His musical career really took off when he moved to Greenwich Village in the mid-sixties. Here he met David Blue and together they formed The American Patrol. During this period in the Village Rafkin also met Phil Ochs and Eric Andersen and he played on Andersen's 1966 album More Hits from Tin Can Alley on Vanguard Records and later on Phil Ochs' legendary album Gunfight at Carnegie Hall.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Rafkin knew Erik Jacobsen - record producer for among others, The Lovin' Spoonful and Tim Hardin - and in 1967 when Jacobsen moved to San Francisco Rafkin relocated there to work as a producer and session guitarist. In 1968 after breaking with Eric Jacobsen, Rafkin moved again, this time to Los Angeles. In 1972 he played on the David Blue album Stories and worked with producers Lenny Waronker, Henry Lewy and Larry Marks. Rafkin was a session musician for The Everly Brothers and Gene Vincent. In 1971 The Byrds covered Rafkin's song \"Lazy Waters\" on the album Farther Along. Around the same time Rafkin worked on NBC TV's BJ and the Bear. His song \"Ain't Gonna Rain No More\" was featured in the 1996 movie Spree.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1973 Rafkin played guitar on the Tim Buckley album Sefronia and on Augie Meyers's Western Head Music Company on Polydor Records. By the mid-1970s Rafkin had enough of the pressures of the music industry and set up his own woodworking business. Rafkin moved again in 1991, this time to Florida, and started to release his own albums (see discography). In 1994 he won the Florida Guitar Finger Picking Championship. In both 1997 and 1999 Rafkin opened for Willie Nelson.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 2002 and 2003 he toured the UK with Country Artist Annie Sims - after which Rafkin came to the UK every year performing as a solo performer. While on tour in 2011 Rafkin met UK Songwriters Malcolm Barnard and Chris Godden, the start of a strong friendship. Their country rock band, Rocky and the Natives, performed and released Rafkin's \"Lazy Waters\" in 2012 and the same year Rafkin joined them on several tour dates. In 2013 Rafkin played on their Let's Hear It For The Old Guys album.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2013 – Jeffrey John \"Jeff\" Hanneman, American musician, best known as a founding member of the American thrash metal band Slayer, dies at age 49. Hanneman contributed both lyrical and musical material to every Slayer album and wrote the songs \"Raining Blood\", \"War Ensemble,\" \"South of Heaven,\" \"Seasons in the Abyss,\" and \"Angel of Death,\" all of which have been played at almost every live Slayer performance after their respective compositions. He had his own signature guitar, the ESP Jeff Hanneman Signature model.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Hanneman was born January 31, 1964 in Oakland, California, and grew up in Long Beach, California in a family containing several war veterans: his father fought in Normandy during World War II and his brothers in Vietnam, making warfare a common conversation topic at the dinner table. War films were popular on TV at the time, and Hanneman often joined his brothers in constructing and coloring tank and plane models. His interest in warfare and military history has been attributed to his upbringing.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In a 2009 interview with Decibel magazine, he stated his father is German, but fought for the Allied side in World War II. In the same interview, he also goes into detail of what district of Germany his father and grandparents hail from. His grandfather was fluent in German.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Hanneman was introduced to heavy metal music as a child through his older sister Mary, when she was listening to Black Sabbath at her house. Once he reached high school, he discovered hardcore punk, which had a significant influence on his style and attitude.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1981 Hanneman, who was working as a telemarketer at the time, met Kerry King, when King was auditioning for a southern rock band called \"Ledger\". King remembered: \"As I was leaving, I saw Jeff just kinda standing around playing guitar, and he was playing stuff that I was into, like Def Leppard's 'Wasted' and AC/DC and Priest\". After the try-out session, the two guitarists started talking and playing Iron Maiden and Judas Priest songs. Slayer was born when King asked \"Why don't we start our own band?\", to which Hanneman replied \"...F*ck yeah!\".[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Hanneman stated that he was playing guitar \"for like a month\" by the time he met King and put an effort into improving his skills after watching him play. Hanneman, who was heavily influenced by hardcore punk music, got the other members into the genre, leading Slayer into a faster and more aggressive approach. The band's drummer Dave Lombardo asserted that his hardcore influences pushed him to play faster, contributing to shape his drumming style.[6][/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1984, Hanneman, Lombardo and Suicidal Tendencies guitarist Rocky George had a brief hardcore punk side project called \"Pap Smear\" – the band had many tracks and was due to start recording when Hanneman was advised to avoid the side project by Slayer's producer, Rick Rubin, who is quoted as saying \"Ahhhh, don't do it, man – this is the kind of thing that breaks bands up!\"[1] and Hanneman took Rubin's advice. Only a demo was recorded, consisting of Hanneman on vocals and bass, Lombardo on drums and George on guitar. Later two of the songs were re-recorded on Slayer's 1996 album Undisputed Attitude.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In early 2011, Hanneman contracted necrotizing fasciitis. Reports linked this illness with a spider bite he claimed to have received while in a friend's hot tub.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In light of his illness and Slayer's upcoming participation in the Australian Soundwave Festival tour that was set to begin on February 26, 2011, the band made the decision to play the dates without Hanneman, and on February 16, 2011, brought on Gary Holt (guitarist of the band Exodus) to fill in for him. Pat O'Brien joined as Slayer's temporary second guitarist when Holt left the tour to play with Exodus. In 2012, bandmate Tom Araya announced a recovery from the disease. However, later in February 2013, Kerry King revealed continuing health problems that kept Hanneman from working.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Hanneman died of liver failure in a Southern California hospital near his home. On May 9, 2013, the official cause of death was announced as alcohol-related cirrhosis. Hanneman and his family had apparently been unaware of the extent of the condition until shortly before his death.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1989, Hanneman married Kathryn in Las Vegas. They had met in 1983 before the release of the debut album Show No Mercy, during a Slayer show in Buena Park, California. The couple had no children and lived in Los Angeles. Kathryn stayed at home when Slayer toured; Hanneman claimed to prefer this, having said that when he came home, she was \"all brand new again.\" Kathryn only toured with the band twice in twenty years.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Hanneman was a reserved person when he was offstage. Unlike the other members, he was very selective in socializing and rarely gave interviews. As vocalist/bassist Araya said: \"If he didn't like you, he wouldn't hang with you.\" Hanneman was a reformed cocaine and pill abuser, much like Araya. They decided to quit when they realized \"this can lead to only death or something, this is going too far.\" Hanneman was a long-time fan of the Oakland Raiders and the Los Angeles Kings.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Hanneman's interest in German war medals and Nazi Germany was illustrated by many of his lyrics. Those interests in the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS began with medals given to him by his father, including some taken from a dead German soldier. His most prized medal was his Knight's Cross, which he had bought from a Slayer fan for $1000. While touring with Motörhead, Hanneman discovered Motörhead vocalist Lemmy's interest in medals, and the two discussed medal designs, weapons and tactics used by the Wehrmacht.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Hanneman's lyrics for the song \"Angel of Death\" led to accusations of Slayer being Nazi sympathizers. Hanneman defended himself with \"nothing I put in the lyrics that says necessarily he (Josef Mengele) was a bad man, because to me – well, isn't that obvious? I shouldn't have to tell you that.\" The band has stated numerous times that they are not Nazis and do not condone Nazism.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Hanneman's major influences included hard rock and heavy metal bands like Led Zeppelin, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, Aerosmith and hardcore punk acts such as Wasted Youth, Minor Threat, Dead Kennedys, Black Flag, T.S.O.L., which led to Slayer's 1996 album Undisputed Attitude. Hanneman's and King's dual guitar solos have been called \"wildly chaotic,\" and \"twisted genius\". Early albums, such as Hell Awaits and Reign in Blood, featured a \"wailing style\" and \"demented soloing often mimicking the screams of the song's victims.\" South of Heaven featured \"more technical\" guitar riffs, utilizing the aforementioned tremolo picking and down-picked notes, improving musicianship while retaining a melodic sense. Both Hanneman and King were ranked #10 in Guitar World's \"100 Greatest Heavy Metal Guitarists of All Time.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Legacy[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Hanneman's guitar work had a notable impact on the heavy metal scene. Musicians like Robb Flynn (Machine Head), Dino Cazares (Fear Factory, Divine Heresy), Mille Petrozza (Kreator), Andreas Kisser (Sepultura), Dan Lilker (Anthrax, Nuclear Assault), Eric Hoffman (Deicide, Amon Amarth), Trevor Peres (Obituary), Mark Morton (Lamb of God) and Kelly Shaefer[ (Atheist) cited him as an influence on their playing and songwriting. Jeff Walker said that \"Hanneman's playing and riff writing and attitude has had a big impact on Carcass\". Shavo Odadjian declared that \"without Jeff Hanneman, there would be no System of a Down\".[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]John Consterdine of Terrorizer magazine noted: \"without Jeff Hanneman, Slayer certainly would not have created some of the most famous riffs in metal, which undoubtedly changed the entire genre\". According to Jeff Kitts of Guitar World, he \"influenced a generation and changed the course of metal forever\". Alex Webster of Cannibal Corpse, who considers Hanneman his major influence as a composer, regarded him as \"one of the greatest musicians and songwriters in metal\" and Alexi Laiho of Children of Bodom described him as \"one of the fathers of metal\".[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Alex Skolnick of Testament asserted that he \"wrote some of the best riffs of all-time\" and \"he impacted music in such a way that an entire genre will never be the same\". According to Corey Taylor of Slipknot and Stone Sour, Hanneman is \"one of the most underrated writers and underrated players that ever was\" while Slash of Guns n' Roses and Velvet Revolver defined him \"the king of thrash/speed metal guitar\".[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Hanneman wrote the music for most of the band's fan favorites, songs such as \"Angel of Death\", \"Raining Blood\", \"Die by the Sword\", \"South of Heaven\", \"War Ensemble\", \"Postmortem\", \"Dead Skin Mask\" and \"Seasons in the Abyss\", which have all become staples for live performance at Slayer shows. Hanneman's favorite album was Reign in Blood, and he enjoyed performing the songs \"Raining Blood\" and \"Angel of Death.\" He contributed lyrics and music to every Slayer album, having formed a music and lyric writing partnership with Araya, which sometimes overshadowed King's creative input.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]When writing new material, the band writes the music before the lyrics. Hanneman often composed riffs at his house, using a 24-track and a drum machine and then by gathering opinions from the other band members; King and Lombardo made suggestions of alterations. The band will play the riff to get the basic song structure, and then figure out where the lyrics and solos go. Hanneman stated that writing lyrics and music is a \"free for all\"; \"It's all just whoever comes up with what. Sometimes I'll be more on a roll and I'll have more stuff, same with Kerry – it's whoever's hot, really. Anybody can write anything; if it's good we use it, if not we don't.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Hanneman used a black Gibson Les Paul modified with a Kahler Pro tremolo and a Joe Barden Two/Tone Humbucker bridge pickup in Slayer's early days and through the Show No Mercy and Hell Awaits era. In mid 1985 he began playing B.C. Rich guitars, notably a Rich Bich model he bought off his band colleague Kerry King, which he subsequently applied various graphics to. His first Bich had a 3x3 headstock, chrome hardware (including the Kahler Pro bridge) and the pickups were DiMarzio Super Distortions. He and King can both also be seen with a second set of BC Rich's around 1986-1987, which had 6-in-line headstocks, black hardware and DiMarzio pickups. He also used a BC Rich Ironbird model more rarely. From 1987, he was seen using a custom made BC Rich Gunslinger with similar specs as his '86-'87 era Bich, shortly after he had the pickups replaced with two active EMG-81 humbuckers. In 1988 he began playing the famous Jackson Soloist that he would use constantly as his main guitar for songs played in E-flat tuning until 2001. It was originally shipped to him with passive Jackson pickups (probably a J-50 and J-80) and a JE-1200 mid-boost circuit, but the pickups were soon changed for EMG-81 pickups and the mid-boost circuit was removed as well. Around 1990-1991 Hanneman began using ESP guitars, he mostly used as backup for this Jackson Soloist and other tunings. He had his own signature model made, based on the specs of his original Jackson Soloist. When touring, Hanneman carried six guitars due to the different tunings he utilized. Most albums such as Haunting the Chapel – Divine Intervention and World Painted Blood have E-flat tuning. However, albums such as Diabolus in Musica – Christ Illusion feature alternate tunings such as Drop B and utilizing seven string guitars. The first album, Show No Mercy, was recorded in standard tuning, while live performances of those songs were played in E-flat since about 1984.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2014 – Mohammad-Rezā Lotfi (Persian: [/FONT][FONT=&quot]محمدرضا[/FONT][FONT=&quot] [/FONT][FONT=&quot]لطفی‎‎[/FONT][FONT=&quot]; also Romanized as Mohammad-Reza Lofti) was a Persian classical musician renowned for his mastery of the Tar and Setar, dies at age 67.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Encouraged by his older brother, he learned to play the tar and showed his talent by winning the first prize in Iran's Young Musicians Festival in 1964.[citation needed] The following year, he started his studies at the Persian National Music Conservatory in Tehran under Habibollah Salehi and Master Ali Akbar Shahnazi. He was a Tar player at Fine Arts Administration Orchestra (Saba Orchestra) under the direction of Hossein Dehlavi. Some of his other eminent teachers were Abdollah Davami, from whom he learned the Radif, and Master Sa'id Hormozi, who taught him the Setar.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]While attending the College of Fine Arts at Tehran University, Lotfi became the student of Master Nour-Ali Boroumand. He also worked at the Center for the Preservation and Propagation of Traditional Persian Music, both as a soloist and a conductor. His other accomplishments were teaching at the Center for Intellectual Development of Children and Adolescents, researching folk music for National Radio and Television, and appearing at the Shiraz Arts Festival. After graduating in 1973, Lotfi joined the faculty of Fine Arts at Tehran University.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He continued his collaboration with Radio and Television and co-founded the Shayda Ensemble. Between 1978 and 1980, Lotfi became the Head of the School of Music at Tehran University. He served as the director of the Center for the Preservation and Propagation of Traditional Persian Music and the \"Chavosh\" Center. In 1984 Lotfi was invited by Fondazione Cini to participate in a seminar and perform concerts in Italy where he resided for two years. He lived in the United States from 1986 until his death and performed widely throughout Asia, Europe, and North America.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]A prolific musician, he made numerous recordings both as a solo artist and with celebrated Iranian musicians such as, Mohammad Reza Shajarian, Shahram Nazeri, Hossein Alizadeh, and Parviz Meshkatian. Lotfi is one of the greatest contemporary masters of the tar and setar. He is among the major figures who, in the past twenty years, have revolutionized the Persian traditional (classical) music. His innovative approach of combining the classical with folk elements, both in terms of music and technique, has injected a new vitality into a very old tradition. His original creativity and the deep-rooted emotional quality of his playing have made him the father of a new aesthetics in Persian music.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Mohammad Reza Lotfi, has many works with Mohammad Reza Shajarian performed in radio or in common concerts. He also, has many self-vocal works.

Often compared to the Fifth Dimension, the Friends featured tightly harmonizing men and women dressed in late 60s \"hip\" clothing. And like the Fifth Dimension, the Friends of Distinction had some hits that have stood the test of time.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Their first single, \"Grazin' In the Grass,\" was a Elston-sung vocal remake of a Hugh Masekela instrumental cut, and hit the top 5 on both Pop and Soul charts in 1969. The group's follow-up, \"Going In Circles,\" was a brilliant ballad that also charted high. The Friends were quite prolific from 1969-71, releasing 5 albums (a sixth appeared in 1973). They also released a number of great singles, including \"Check It Out\" (later remade by Tavares) and a terrific cover of Neil Sedaka's \"Time Waits for No One.\" Cleaves was the lead on several songs, including the terrific \"I Really Hope You Do.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Cleaves left the Friends to join a fledgling Chicago band called Earth Wind & Fire, and recorded with the group for two albums, Last Days and Time and Head to the Sky.

He served as music director and song leader for the Highlander Research and Education Center in New Market, Tennessee.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Carawan is famous for introducing the protest song \"We Shall Overcome\" to the American Civil Rights Movement, by teaching it to the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in 1960. A union organizing song based on a black spiritual, it had been a favorite of Zilphia Horton (d. 1956) wife of the founder of the Highlander Folk School. Carawan reintroduced it at the school when he became its new music director in 1959. The song is copyrighted in the name of Horton, Frank Hamilton, Carawan and Pete Seeger.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Carawan sang and played banjo, guitar, and hammered dulcimer. He frequently performed and recorded with his wife, singer Candie Carawan Occasionally he was accompanied by their son Evan Carawan, who plays mandolin and hammered dulcimer. Carawan and his wife lived in New Market, near the Highlander Center.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Carawan was born in California in 1927, to Southern parents. His mother, from Charleston, South Carolina, was the resident poet at Winthrop College (now Winthrop University) in Rock Hill, South Carolina, and his father, a veteran of World War I from North Carolina, worked as an asbestos contractor. He earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Occidental College in 1949 and a master's degree in sociology from UCLA. Through his friend Frank Hamilton, Carawan was introduced to musicians in the People's Songs network, including Pete Seeger and The Weavers. Moving to New York City, he became involved with the American folk music revival in Greenwich Village in the 1950s. He also traveled abroad, visiting England, attending a World Festival of Youth and Students in the Soviet Union in 1957, and continuing on to the People's Republic of China.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Carawan first visited the Highlander Folk School in 1953, with singers Ramblin' Jack Elliot and Frank Hamilton. At the recommendation of Pete Seeger, he returned in 1959 as a volunteer, taking charge of the music program pioneered by Zilphia Horton, who had died in an accident in 1956. When college students in Greensboro, NC, began the lunch-counter sit-in movement on Feb 1, 1960, Highlander's youth program took on a new urgency. Highlander's seventh annual college workshop took place on the first weekend in April, with 83 students from twenty colleges attending. As part of a talent show and dance, Carawan taught the students the song \"We Shall Overcome.\" Two weeks later, on April 15, two hundred students assembled in Raleigh, NC, for a three-day conference at Shaw University. Called by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) to develop a youth wing, the students instead organized the independent Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). They invited Carawan to lead the singing, and he closed the first evening with \"We Shall Overcome.\" The audience stood, linked hands and sang—and went away inspired, carrying the song to meetings and demonstrations across the South.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]According to his wife Candie, one of Guy's most important roles during the Civil Rights Movement—more so than introducing \"We Shall Overcome\" as a Freedom Song—was his desire to record and archive the evolution of the movement through song. Both Guy and Candie believe that the political usage of religious and folk music could shape movements and influence people to take action in social change, and Guy's initiative to record and preserve the already established Freedom Songs within the movement are used to inspire and to educate future leaders and activists. Movement leader Rev. C. T. Vivian, a lieutenant of Martin Luther King reminisced:[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] I don't think we had ever thought of spirituals as movement material. When the movement came up, we couldn't apply them. The concept has to be there. It wasn't just to have the music but to take the music out of our past and apply it to the new situation, to change it so it really fit.... The first time I remember any change in our songs was when Guy came down from Highlander. Here he was with this guitar and tall thin frame, leaning forward and patting that foot. I remember James Bevel and I looked across at each other and smiled. Guy had taken this song, \"Follow the Drinking Gourd\" – I didn't know the song, but he gave some background on it and boom – that began to make sense. And, little by little, spiritual after spiritual began to appear with new words and changes: \"\"Keep Your Eyes on the Prize\", \"Hold On\" or \"I'm Going to Sit at the Welcome Table\". Once we had seen it done, we could begin to do it.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]At Highlander's April workshop, Carawan had met Candie Anderson, an exchange student at Fisk University in Nashville, from Pomona College in California, who was one of the first white students involved in the sit-in movement. They were married in March 1961.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Carawan first heard the hammer dulcimer played by Chet Parker. In turn, Carawan introduced both John McCutcheon and Malcolm Dalglish to the instrument.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2016 – Pandit Balwant Rai Bhatt, noted Indian composer and musician of Hindustani Vocal Music, dies at age 94.

Returning to Prague in 1771 after a long stay in France and Flanders, he greatly impressed the violinist Pichl and pianist Dusek who promptly sent him to Vienna with recommendations to Haydn who took him on as a composition pupil and as solo harpist in the retinue of Count Esterhazy. In 1776 Krumpholtz undertook a long concert tour of Europe, performing in Leipzig on a \"harpe organisée\", gradually becoming the most acclaimed harp virtuoso of the late 18th century. He is no less important for his efforts to perfect the harp: in 1785 the Parisian firm of Naderman built an instrument to Krumpholtz's specification with 24 strings, eight of which were metal, and with an eighth pedal that opened five shutters in the resonator. Other improvements by him were incorporated after his death into the Erard harp at the beginning of the 19th century, the prototype of the modern double-action harp. After his death a harp method, said to have been written by him for a German baroness, was published by J.M. Plane as \"Principes pour la harpe\" in 1800. Krumpholtz's concertos, sonatas and variations for harp, which appeared in Paris from about 1775 (many were later reprinted in London), became staples of the repertory and are still highly respected.\n\nA romantic equivalent of Krumpholtz would have to be Paganini whose violin concertos feature many of the same merits and, indeed, the virtually unchanged basic structure (allegro - andante - rondo) that can be found in the pieces of his predecessor. Krumpholtz can also be traced as an important influence on early nineteenth century harp composers, especially Boieldieu whose concert in C owns more than a little to his predecessor's 5th concerto. Krumpholtz's music is undeniably naive (his early sonatas prove to be a bit bland) and lacking in wit, and, just as in the case of Paganini's violin concertos, some sections are extremely long-winded. However, one would be hard-pressed to deny the obvious expertise and surprising melodic ease of the harpist's music. Highlights include a handsome set of dark variations in the 5th concerto and the enchanting and elegantly scored romanza in the 6th concerto (posted separately). The focus of the present upload is the extended adagio of the 4th concerto. Lasting almost thirteen minutes, the movement focuses more on sustaining an atmosphere of complete gentility, rather than showy pyrotechnics. Indeed, the music is unfailingly handsome. A long, dramatic orchestral prelude which highlights some of the melodies that later appear in the harp line (in the present case, it is cut), a simple, unstrained harp melody, almost devoid of any extraneous embellishments, begins, highlighting the beautiful contrasts between the instrument's higher and lower reaches. The orchestra functions merely as a commentator, appearing in short gusts that provide a suitably ominous gesture, somewhat akin to a hushed wind. However, a remarkable modulation to major soon occurs , whereupon the original lament is transformed into a warm serenade, gently sprinkled with graceful ornamental figures and trills, in contrast to the opening's darker nature. Sustained string lines serve as a light background to the harp's sincere outpouring. A charming coda leads into a slightly restrained orchestral tempo di mezzo . We then return to the main theme melody, retaining the warmth of the second half of the preceding section, overflowing into a blissful \"duet\" for the harp, passing through a gorgeous low line, and the strings, playing enchanting sustained lines. And yet, once again, an ornamental passage gives way to a modulation, this time back to minor. The original sombre atmosphere returns and is sustained until the end of the piece, though with a dance-like elegance gracing the harp's line as an echo of the major episodes. A brief cadenza moves us to a return to the opening orchestral prelude which gains a march-like quality, in the manner of a funeral march. The piece can be seen as a striking image of the passage of time during a single day with the slightly menacing end of the night transforming with the arrival of the sun to a fresh morning. And yet, the night, coming all too quick after a relaxed afternoon, ultimately reigns supreme. A genuine but most welcome surprise.\n\nRecording: The 1996-1997 Clarton recording presents winning renditions of all six concertos from the talented Jana Bouskova, the clear Prague Chamber Philharmonic Orchestra and the competent Jiri Belohlavek.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1752 - Braz Francisco de Lima, composer is born.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1792 - Carlo Zuccari, composer, dies at 87.\n\nin 1819 - Nicola De Giosa, composer is born.\n\nin 1839 - Ferdinando Paer, composer, dies at 67.\n\nin 1844 - Richard D'Oyly Carte, England, opera impresario (Ivanhoe) is born.\n\nin 1854 - William Beale, composer, dies at 70.\n\nin 1856 - Adolfo Fumagalli, composer, dies at 27.\n\nin 1856 - Adolphe Charles Adam, French composer/critic (Giselle), dies at 52.\n\nin 1861 - Anthony Philip Heinrich, composer, dies at 80.\n\nin 1868 - Olof Wilhelm Udden, composer, dies at 68.\n\nin 1873 - Nikolay N Tcherepnin, St Petersburg, composer of ballets, songs [OS] is born.\n\nin 1886 - Marcel Dupre, French organist/composer is born.\n\nin 1893 - Josef Rudolf Zavrtal, composer, dies at 73.\n\nin 1902 - Hugo Friedhofer, composer is born.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1903 – Harry Lillis 'Bing' Crosby, Tacoma Wash, singer (White Christmas, Going My Way) is born at Tacoma, Wash.\n\nCrosby was the most successful singer of the first half of the 20th century, dominating several fields of entertainment especially during the 1930s and 1940s. Of his thousands of recordings, hundreds became hits, including 30 that were best-sellers and 22 that sold at least a million copies each. \"White Christmas\" and \"Silent Night\" are among the biggest selling records of all time; his other big hits include \"Sweet Leilani,\" \"Pennies from Heaven,\" and \"Swinging on a Star.\" Crosby also was a major motion picture actor, with leading roles in 51 feature films between 1932 and 1962, frequently placing among the top box office stars and winning the Academy Award for Best Actor. His radio shows, broadcast from 1931 to 1962, earned consistently high ratings.\n\nCrosby was born into a large, poor Irish-American family; his younger brother Bob (1913-93) became a singer, bandleader, and actor. His father, Harry Lowe Crosby, was a bookkeeper. The family moved to Spokane when Crosby was three. He acquired his nickname from his interest in a cornic strip, The Bingville Bugle. By age 15 he was playing drums in a band. He attended Gonzaga University as a pre-law student from 1921 to 1925, quitting in his senior year as he began to earn money singing. On Oct. 15, 1925, he and friend Al Rinker, brother of singer Mildred Bailey, left Spokane for Los Angeles, where Bailey found them work as a duo. By the end of the year they had joined a West Coast vaudeville tour. Crosby and Rinker made their recording debut singing with Don Clark and His Los Angeles Biltmore Hotel Orchetra on \"I've Got the ....\" (music and lyrics by Walter Donaldson) on Oct. 18, 1926.\n\nOn Dec. 15 they joined Paul Whiteman and His arch. Initially successful on tour, they failed in N.Y. in January 1927, and Whiteman added Harry Barris to form the Rhythm Boys trio. The first popular Whiteman recording to feature Crosby was \"Muddy Water\" (music by Peter DeRose and Harry Richman, lyrics by Io Trent), which became a hit in June 1927. From August 1927 to June 1928 the Rhythm Boys toured in vaudeville under Whiteman's sponsorship but separate from the band. Whiteman scored a bestselling record in November 1927 with \"My Blue Heaven\" (music by Donaldson, lyrics by George Whiting), which contained a vocal chorus by a quintet that included Crosby. Crosby sang lead on a Whiteman recording of \"01' Man River\" (music by Jerome Kern, lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II), which became a bestseller in April 1928.\n\nIn November 1929 the Whiteman orchestra including Crosby began shooting the film King of Jazz at Universal Studios in Hollywood. Whiteman's recording of \"Great Day\" (music by Vincent Youmans, lyrics by Billy Rose and Edward Eliscu) featuring Crosby'S solo vocal became a best-seller in December. In May 1930, shortly after the release of KingofJazz, the Rhythm Boys left Whiteman. They recorded \"Three Little Words\" (music by Harry Ruby, lyrics by Bert Kalmar) with Duke Ellington and His Famous Orch.: it became a best-seller in November after being featured in the film Check and Double Check.\n\nCrosby married actress Dixie Lee (real name Wilma Winfred Wyatt) on Sept. 20, 1930. They had four sons, Gary, twins Phillip and Dennis, and Lindsay, all of whom became singers. The Rhythm Boys began singing with Gus Arnheim and His arch. at the Cocoanut Grove nightclub in Los Angeles in September 1930. Crosby made his first feature film appearance apart from the group in December, singing a song in Reaching for the Moon. The group broke up in the spring of 1931 and Crosby went solo, signing a contract with Brunswick Records and forming an association with its recording director, Jack Kapp, that would last until Kapp's death 18 years later. (He moved with Kapp to the newly formed American Decca label in 1934.) \"Out of Nowhere\" (music by John Green, lyrics by Edward Heyman), Crosby's initial solo recording, became a best-seller in May, followed by \"Just One More Chance\" (music by Arthur Johnston, lyrics by Sam Coslow) in June and\"At Your Command\" (music and lyrics by Harry Barris, Bing Crosby, and Harry Tobias) in August. Crosby launched his solo radio career with a 15minute program on CBS on Sept. 2. Starting in November he played an extended engagement at the Paramount Theatre in N.Y.\n\nIn January 1932 he scored another best-seller with \"Dinah\" (music by Harry Akst, lyrics by Sam M. Lewis and Joe Young), a duet with the Mills Brothers. Signed to Paramount Pictures, Crosby began filming his first starring role in The Big Broadcast in June 1932. Following the film's successful release in October, he was signed to a long-term contract with the studio and stayed there for 24 years. In July he went on an extensive concert tour, the only one of his career. \"Please\" (music by Ralph Rainger, lyrics by Leo Robin), which he introduced in The Big Broadcast, became his next top-seller in October, followed in November by \"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\" (music by Jay Gorney, lyrics by E. Y. Harburg).\n\nIn 1933, Crosby settled into a pattern he would follow with only minor variations for the next two decades. Living in Los Angeles, he appeared on his own radio show while shooting two or three movies a year. The films usually were light romantic musical comedies 756 in which he sang several specially written songs, which he also recorded, resulting in a stream of hits. \"You're Getting to Be a Habit with Me\" (music by Harry Warren, lyrics by Al Dubin), Crosby's next bestseller in March 1933, found him accompanied by Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians. Another WarrenDubin composition, \"Shadow Waltz,\" became a top hit for Crosby in July. On it, and his next big hit, \"Little Dutch Mill\" (music by Harry Barris, lyrics by Ralph Freed), in April 1934, he was accompanied by Jimmie Grier and His arch. The Rainger-Robin song \"Love in Bloom,\" a best- seller in August, was featured in Crosby's film She Loves Me Not, released in September. Rainger and Robin's \"June in January\" was a major hit in December, the same month Crosby sang it in Here Is My Heart.\n\nCrosby had two best-sellers from the Richard Rodgers-Lorenz Hart score of Mississippi, released in April 1935,\"Easy to Remember\" and \"Soon.\" But he lost ground to the swing bands, and his next #1 on the hit parade did not come until December 1936 with \"Pennies from Heaven\" (music by Arthur Johnston, lyrics by Johnny Burke), the title song from a film released that month. His first million-selling record was \"Sweet Leilani\" (music and lyrics by Harry Owens), from the March 1937 film Waikiki Wedding, which was in the hit parade for 12 weeks that spring and summer. \"Remember Me?\" (a Warren-Dubin song) topped the hit parade for Crosby in November 1937. In October 1938, \"I've Got a Pocketful of Dreams\" (music by James V.Monaco, lyrics by Johnny Burke), from the August film release Sing, You Sinners, led the hit parade for four weeks, becoming the second-biggest hit of the year. In December 1938 and Jan. 1939, Crosby again reached the top of the hit parade with \"You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby\" (music by Harry Warren, lyrics by Johnny Mercer).\n\nCrosby's hits of the 1930s were enough to make him the most successful recording artist of the decade. He repeated this feat in the 1940s, starting with two charttoppers, a revival of the 1916 song \"Sierra Sue\" (music and lyrics by Joseph Buell Carey) in September 1940and the Monaco-Burke composition \"Only Forever\" from his August film release Rhythmon theRiverin October. A revival of Bob Wills's \"San Antonio Rose,\" released as \"New San Antonio Rose\" in early 1941, on which Crosby was backed by his brother Bob's orchestra, became his second million-seller. Crosby's third million-seller was \"White Christmas\" (music and lyrics by Irving Berlin), recorded on May 29, 1942, and featured in the August 1942 film Holiday Inn. Topping the charts in October, it became the biggest hit of the year. It returned to the top of the charts in the holiday seasons of 1945 and 1946, and continued to reach the charts yearly through 1962. With worldwide sales estimated as high as a hundred million copies, it was the best-selling single record of all time. On June 8, 1942, Crosby made a commercial recording of the 1818 Christmas song \"Silent Night\" (music by Franz Gruber, lyrics by Joseph Mohr); he had previously recorded the song with Whiteman in 1928 and for a charity album in 1935.\n\nIt went on to become one of his biggest selling singles, with sales estimated at seven million copies. The success of his Christmas recordings propelled Crosby to a new level of popularity, and he dominated the record charts and the box office rankings in the mid-1940s. His next chart-topper and million-seller came in September 1943 with \"Sunday, Monday or Always\" (music by James Van Heusen, lyrics by Johnny Burke) from the film Dixie. That month he recorded two more million-sellers in duets with the Andrews Sisters, \"Pistol Packin' Mama\" (music and lyrics by Al Dexter) and the 1857 Christmas song \"Jingle Bells\" (music and lyrics by J. S. Pierpont), and the following month yet another, \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" (music and lyrics by Walter Kent, Kim Gannon, and Buck Ram).\n\nCrosby's remarkable chart performance in 1943-44 is partially due to his being the flagship artist for the one major recording label that settled a dispute with the musicians' union a year ahead of its rivals, allowing its artists to record freely. He topped the charts with six records during 1944: in April with \"San Fernando Valley\" (music and lyrics by Gordon Jenkins); in May with \"1 Love You\" (music and lyrics by Cole Porter); in July with a revival of the 1938 song \"I'll Be Seeing You\" (music by Sammy Fain, lyrics by Irving Kahal); in August with the biggest hit of the year and his ninth million-seller, \"Swinging on a Star\" (music by James Van Heusen, lyrics by Johnny Burke), from his May motion picture release Going My Way, the biggest box office hit of the year, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor; in Oct. with \"(There'll Be a) Hot Time in the Town of Berlin (When the Yanks Go Marching In)\" (music by Joe Bushkin, lyrics by John De Vries), a duet with the Andrews Sisters; and in December with another Andrews Sisters duet, \"Don't Fence Me In\" (music and lyrics by Cole Porter), which became his 11th million-seller.\n\n(His tenth, the 1914 Irish song \"Too-Ra- Loo-Ra-Loo-Ral\" [music and lyrics by James Royce Shannon] also was heard in the film Going My Way.) With Columbia and RCA Victor back to making records in 1945, Crosby was not able to rule the record industry as he had the year before, but he remained the top-selling artist, scoring chart-topping hits with \"It's Been a Long, Long Time\" (music by [ule Styne, lyrics by Sammy Cahn) and \"1Can't Begin to Tell You\" (music by James V. Monaco, lyrics by Mack Gordon), his 12th million-seller, in December. He also topped the album charts with GoingMy Way in October and Merry Christmas in November. (Initially released as an eight-song collection on four 78 rpm discs, Merry Christmas became a perennial holiday seller, topping the charts again every year through 1950 and again in 1957. Upon its reissue as an LP, four tracks were added.\n\nIn 1970, Merry Christmas became Crosby's only record to be certified gold by the R.I.A.A.) And, for the second time in a row, he starred in the year's box office champ, the Going My Way sequel, The Bells of St. Mary's, which earned him an Academy Award nomination. Crosby topped the album charts with The Bells of St. Mary's in March 1946. He had more million-selling singles that year with the Irish song \"McNamara's Band\" (music by Shamus O'Connor, lyrics by John J. Stamford) and another Andrews Sisters duet, \"South America, Take It Away\" (music and lyrics by Harold Rome). Blue Skies, costarring Fred Astaire, was one of the most successful films of the year. To commemorate St. Patrick's Day 1947, Crosby released a St. Patrick's Day album, which charted over the next three years, hitting #1 in March 1948. He had four more millionselling singles during 1947: a coupling of \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" (music and lyrics by Irving Berlin) and \"The Spaniard That Blighted My Life\" (music and lyrics by Billy Merson), both vintage songs, recorded as duets with AI [olson; \"The Whiffenpoof Song\" (music by Tod B. Galloway, lyrics by Meade Minnigerode and George S. Pomeroy); \"Now Is the Hour\" (music and lyrics by Maewa Kaihan, Clement Scott, and Dorothy Stewart), which topped the charts in April 1948; and \"Galway Bay\" (music and lyrics by Dr. Arthur Colahan).\n\nHe also starred in the year's most successful film, Welcome Stranger, in which he was again teamed with Going My Way costar, Barry Fitzgerald. Another of Crosby's holiday albums, St. Valentine's Day,topped the charts in February 1948. He enjoyed his 20th million-selling single with \"Dear Hearts and Gentle People\" (music by Sammy Fain, lyrics by Bob Hilliard), released in fall 1949. Though he didn't hit #1 on the singles charts in 1950, his nine chart entries, four of them Top Ten hits, made him the most successful recording artist of the year; his biggest single and 21st million-seller was the duet with his son Gary, \"Play a Simple Melody\" (music and lyrics by Irving Berlin). Crosby began to cut back in the 1950s, making only one or two films a year, and his record sales declined. On Nov. 11,1952, his wife died of cancer. In his films he took on more serious roles, notably playing an alcoholic singer in The Country .... (1954), which earned him his third Oscar nomination.\n\nHis greatest popular success came with efforts that hearkened back to earlier triumphs, such as the 1954 film White Christmas and the Top Ten, five-LP boxed set Bing: A Musical Autobiography (1954), on which he rerecorded many of his old hits. His Paramount contract ended in 1954, and his Decca contract in 1955, after which he made records and films on a freelance basis. The popular movie High Society, released in August 1956, featured his duet with Grace Kelly on \"True Love\" (music and lyrics by Cole Porter), his 22nd and last million-selling record. Crosby married actress/singer Kathryn Grant (real name Grandstaff) on Oct. 24, 1957.\n\nThey had three children, each of whom performed with their parents; Mary Crosby went on to become a successful actress. During the last 20 years of his life, Crosby worked steadily in a variety of media, though with less public exposure and commercial success. In films like Say One for Me (1959) and High Time (1960), he was paired with much younger costars. His last starring role came with TheRoad to HongKong (1962), the seventh of his popular series of comedies with Bob Hope, though he made supporting appearances in Robin and the Seven Hoods (1964) and Stagecoach (1966). He worked extensively on television, frequently hosting the variety series The Hollywood Palace between 1964 and 1970 and starring in his own situation comedy, TheBing Crosby Show, during the 1964-65 season and hosting his annual Christmas specials.\n\nFollowing a successful operation to remove a tumor from his left lung in 1974,Crosby became more active as a recording artist and concert performer during the last few years of his life, cutting a series of albums and touring with his family and Rosemary Clooney. He died of a heart attack at age 74 just after performing a series of shows at the London Palladium and recording a final album, Seasons. Crosby's reputation was tarnished in the early 1980s by the publication of the scandalous biography, Bing Crosby: The Hollow Man (1981) and a harsh memoir by his son Gary, GoingMy Own Way (1983). Though neither book dug up much real dirt on the star or even fully justified what little it did, his image had been so saintly that any criticism was magnified.\n\nThe suicides of his sons Lindsay (1989) and Dennis (1991) tended to reinforce the sense that, as a father at least, Crosby was more stern than his public persona suggested, something he had admitted in his 1953 autobiography Call Me Lucky. Nevertheless, the controversy did not diminish Crosby's overwhelming impact on popular music, one reinforced every Christmas season, and by the mid-1990s many of his recordings were coming back into print (notably the four-CD boxed set Bing!His Legendary Years in 1993) and many of his films were becoming available on video. Crosby differed from most singers in that he performed relatively few concerts; instead he was an early master of the various electronic media that rose up in the late 1920s.\n\nAlthough he was not the first performer to tailor his approach to the microphone, he was the most effective and the most successful, evolving an intimate, relaxed persona through a warm, supple baritone, employing apparently casual phrasing that nevertheless evoked the swing rhythm of jazz. His influence as a singer was felt by his immediate successors such as Perry Como as well as James Taylor. The breadth of his repertoire, embracing everything from Hawaiian to country music, expanded popular music and its audience to an unprecedented degree. - Died near Madrid, Spain, Oct. 14, 1977.\n\n3 MAY\n\nPage 1 of 6[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]3 MAY[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\nPage 2 of 6\n\nin 1910 - Alceo Galliera, composer is born\n\nin 1910 - Artie Shaw, bandleader is born.\n\nin 1911 - John Rhea \"Yank\" Lawson, trumpeter is born.\n\nin 1912 - Virgil Fox (American flamboyant organist) is born.\n\nin 1915 - Evencio Castellanos, composer is born.\n\nin 1916 - Léopold Simoneau (French Canadian tenor) is born.\n\nin 1917 - James Penberthy, composer is born.\n\nin 1917 - Betty Comden (US lyricist; Comden and Green) is born.\n\nin 1919 - Pete Seeger, NYC, folk singer (Weaver, Goodnight Irene) is born.\n\nA fixture on nationwide radio in the 1940s, he also had a string of hit records during the early 1950s as a member of The Weavers, most notably their recording of Lead Belly's \"Goodnight, Irene\", which topped the charts for 13 weeks in 1950. Members of The Weavers were blacklisted during the McCarthy Era. In the 1960s, he re-emerged on the public scene as a prominent singer of protest music in support of international disarmament, civil rights, and environmental causes.\n\nAs a song writer, he is best known as the author or co-author of \"Where Have All the Flowers Gone?\" (with Joe Hickerson), \"If I Had a Hammer (The Hammer Song)\", (composed with Lee Hays of The Weavers), and \"Turn, Turn, Turn!\", which have been recorded by many artists both in and outside the folk revival movement and are still sung throughout the world. \"Flowers\" was a hit recording for The Kingston Trio (1962); Marlene Dietrich, who recorded it in English, German and French (1962); and Johnny Rivers (1965). \"If I Had a Hammer\" was a hit for Peter, Paul & Mary (1962) and Trini Lopez (1963), while The Byrds popularized \"Turn, Turn, Turn!\" in the mid-1960s, as did Judy Collins in 1964, and The Seekers in 1966. Seeger was one of the folksingers most responsible for popularizing the spiritual \"We Shall Overcome\" (also recorded by Joan Baez and many other singer-activists) that became the acknowledged anthem of the 1960s American Civil Rights Movement, soon after folk singer and activist Guy Carawan introduced it at the founding meeting of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in 1960. In the PBS \"American Masters\" episode Pete Seeger: The Power of Song, Seeger states it was he who changed the lyric from the traditional \"We will overcome\" to the more singable \"We shall overcome\".\n\nSeeger was born in French Hospital, Midtown Manhattan. His Yankee-Protestant family, which Seeger called \"enormously Christian, in the Puritan, Calvinist New England tradition\", traced its genealogy back over 200 years. A paternal ancestor, Karl Ludwig Seeger, a physician from Wurtemberg, Germany, had emigrated to America in revolutionary times and married into an old New England family in the 1780s. His namesake, Pete's father, Harvard-trained composer and musicologist Charles Louis Seeger, Jr., established the first musicology curriculum in the U.S. at the University of California in 1913; helped found the American Musicological Society; and was a key founder of the academic discipline of ethnomusicology. Pete's mother, Constance de Clyver Edson, raised in Tunisia and trained at the Paris Conservatory of Music, was a concert violinist and later a teacher at the Juilliard School.\n\nIn 1912 Charles Seeger was hired to establish the music department at the University of California, Berkeley, but was forced to resign in 1918 because of his outspoken Pacifism during World War I. Charles and Constance moved back east, making Charles' parents' estate in Patterson, New York, northeast of New York City, their base of operations. When baby Pete was eighteen months old, they set out with him and his two older brothers in a home-made trailer, on a quixotic mission to bring musical uplift to the working people in the American South. On their return, Constance taught violin and Charles composition at the New York Institute of Musical Art (later Juilliard), whose president, family friend Frank Damrosch, was Constance's adoptive \"uncle\". Charles also taught part-time at the New School for Social Research. Career and money tensions led to quarrels and reconciliations, but when Charles discovered Constance had opened a secret bank account in her own name, they separated, and Charles took custody of their three sons.\n\nBeginning in 1936, Charles held various administrative positions in the federal government's Farm Resettlement program, the WPA's Federal Music Project (1938–1940), and the wartime Pan American Union. After World War II, he taught ethnomusicology at the University of California and Yale University.\n\nCharles and Constance Seeger divorced when Pete Seeger was seven, and in 1932 Charles married his composition student and assistant, Ruth Crawford Seeger, now considered by many one of the most important modernist composers of the 20th century. Deeply interested in folk music, Ruth had contributed musical arrangements to Carl Sandburg's extremely influential folk song anthology the American Songbag (1927) and later created significant original settings to eight of Sandburg's poems. Pete's eldest brother, Charles Seeger III, was a radio astronomer, and his next older brother, John Seeger, taught in the 1950s at the Dalton School in Manhattan and was the principal from 1960 to 1976 at Fieldston Lower School in the Bronx.\n\nPete's uncle, Alan Seeger, a noted poet (\"I Have a Rendezvous with Death\"), had been one of the first American soldiers to be killed in the First World War. All four of Pete's half siblings from his father's second marriage – Margaret (Peggy), Mike, Barbara, and Penelope (Penny) – became folk singers. Peggy Seeger, a well-known performer in her own right, was married for many years to British folk singer and activist Ewan MacColl. Mike Seeger was a founder of the New Lost City Ramblers, one of whose members, John Cohen, married Pete's half-sister Penny (herself a talented singer who died young); Barbara Seeger joined her siblings in recording folks songs for children.\n\nIn 1943, Pete married Toshi-Aline Ōta, whom he credits with being the support that helped make the rest of his life possible. Their first child, Peter Ōta Seeger, was born in 1944 and died at six months while Pete was deployed overseas. Pete never saw him. They went on to have three more children: Daniel (an accomplished photographer and filmmaker); Mika (a potter and muralist); and Tinya Seeger (a potter) – and grandchildren Tao (a musician); Cassie Seeger (an artist); Kitama Cahill-Jackson (a filmmaker); Moraya (graduate student married to NFL player Chris DeGeare); Penny; and Isabelle. Tao is a folk musician in his own right, singing and playing guitar, banjo and harmonica with the Mammals. Kitama Jackson is a documentary filmmaker who was associate producer of the PBS documentary Pete Seeger: The Power of Song.\n\nSeeger lives in Beacon, New York. He remains very engaged politically and maintains an active lifestyle in the Hudson Valley Region of New York, especially in the nearby City of Beacon, New York. He and Toshi purchased their land in 1949 and lived there first in a trailer, then in a log cabin they built themselves.\n\nMusical career\n\nEarly work\n\nAt four, Seeger was sent away to boarding school, but came home two years later, when his parents learned the school had failed to inform them he had contracted scarlet fever. He attended first and second grades in Nyack, New York, where his mother lived, before entering boarding school in Ridgefield, Connecticut.[16] Despite being classical musicians, his parents did not press him to play an instrument. On his own, the otherwise bookish and withdrawn boy gravitated to the ukulele, becoming adept at entertaining his classmates with it, while laying the basis for his subsequent remarkable audience rapport. At thirteen, Seeger enrolled in the Avon Old Farms prep school in Avon, Connecticut where he graduated in 1936. He was selected to attend Camp Rising Sun, the George E. Jonas Foundation's international summer leadership program. During the summer of 1936, while traveling with his father and stepmother, Pete heard the five-string banjo for the first time at the Mountain Dance and Folk Festival in western North Carolina near Asheville, organized by local folklorist, lecturer, and traditional music performer Bascom Lamar Lunsford, whom Charles Seeger had hired for Farm Resettlement music projects. The festival took place in a covered baseball field. There the Seegers\n\nwatched square-dance teams from Bear Wallow, Happy Hollow, Cane Creek, Spooks Branch, Cheoah Valley, Bull Creek, and Soco Gap; heard the five-string banjo player Samantha Bumgarner; and family string bands, including a group of Indians from the Cherokee reservation who played string instruments and sang ballads. They wandered among the crowds who camped out at the edge of the field, hearing music being make there as well. As Lunsford's daughter would later recall, those country people \"held the riches that Dad had discovered. They could sing, fiddle, pick the banjos, and guitars with traditional grace and style found nowhere else but deep in the mountains. I can still hear those haunting melodies drift over the ball park.\"\n\nFor the Seegers, experiencing the beauty of this music firsthand was a \"conversion experience\". Pete was deeply affected and, after learning basic strokes from Lunsford, spent much of the next four years trying to master the five-string banjo. The teenage Seeger also sometimes accompanied his parents to regular Saturday evening gatherings at the Greenwich Village loft of painter and art teacher Thomas Hart Benton and his wife Rita. Benton, a lover of Americana, played \"Cindy\" and \"Old Joe Clark\" with his students Charlie and Jackson .......; friends from the \"hillbilly\" recording industry; as well as avant-garde composers Carl Ruggles and Henry Cowell. It was at one of Benton's parties that Pete heard \"John Henry\" for the first time.\n\nSeeger enrolled at Harvard College on a partial scholarship, but as he became increasingly involved with politics and folk music, his grades suffered and he lost his scholarship. He dropped out of college in 1938. He dreamed of a career in journalism and also took courses in art. His first musical gig was leading students in folk singing at the Dalton School, where his aunt was principal. He polished his performance skills during a summer stint of touring New York State with The Vagabond Puppeteers (Jerry Oberwager, 22; Mary Wallace, 22; and Harriet Holtzman, 23), a traveling puppet theater \"inspired by rural education campaigns of post-revolutionary Mexico\". One of their shows coincided with a strike by dairy farmers. The group reprised its act in October in New York City. An article in the October 2, 1939, Daily Worker reported on the Puppeteers' six-week tour this way:\n\nDuring the entire trip the group never ate once in a restaurant. They slept out at night under the stars and cooked their own meals in the open, very often they were the guests of farmers. At rural affairs and union meetings, the farm women would bring \"suppers\" and would vie with each other to see who could feed the troupe most, and after the affair the farmers would have earnest discussions about who would have the honor of taking them home for the night.\n\n\"They fed us too well,\" the ..... reported. \"And we could live the entire winter just by taking advantage of all the offers to spend a week on the farm.\"\n\nIn the farmers' homes they talked about politics and the farmers' problems, about antisemitism and Unionism, about war and peace and social security—\"and always,\" the puppeteers report, \"the farmers wanted to know what can be done to create a stronger unity between themselves and city workers. They felt the need of this more strongly than ever before, and the support of the CIO in their milk strike has given them a new understanding and a new respect for the power that lies in solidarity. One summer has convinced us that a minimum of organized effort on the part of city organizations—unions, consumers' bodies, the American Labor Party and similar groups—can not only reach the farmers but weld them into a pretty solid front with city folks that will be one of the best guarantees for progress.\n\nThat fall Seeger took a job in Washington, D.C., assisting Alan Lomax, a friend of his father's, at the Archive of American Folk Song of the Library of Congress. Seeger's job was to help Lomax sift through commercial \"race\" and \"hillbilly\" music and select recordings that best represented American folk music, a project funded by the music division of the Pan American Union (later the Organization of American States), of whose music division his father, Charles Seeger, was head (1938–53).[23] Lomax also encouraged Seeger's folk singing vocation, and Seeger was soon appearing as a regular performer on Alan Lomax and Nicholas Ray's weekly Columbia Broadcasting show Back Where I Come From (1940–41) alongside of Josh White, Burl Ives, Lead Belly, and Woody Guthrie (whom he had first met at Will Geer's Grapes of Wrath benefit concert for migrant workers on March 3, 1940). Back Where I Come From was unique in having a racially integrated cast, which made news when it performed in March 1941 at a command performance at the White House organized by Eleanor Roosevelt called \"An Evening of Songs for American Soldiers,\" before an audience that included the Secretaries of War, Treasury, and the Navy, among other notables. The show was a success but was not picked up by commercial sponsors for nationwide broadcasting because of its integrated cast. During the war, Seeger also performed on nationwide radio broadcasts by Norman Corwin.\n\nIn 1949 Pete Seeger worked as the Vocal Instructor for the progressive City and Country School in Greenwich Village, New York.\n\nGroup recordings\n\nAs a self-described \"split tenor\" (between an alto and a tenor), Pete Seeger was a founding member of two highly influential folk groups: The Almanac Singers and The Weavers. The Almanac Singers, which Seeger co-founded in 1941 with Millard Lampell and Arkansas singer and activist Lee Hays, was a topical group, designed to function as a singing newspaper promoting the industrial unionization movement, racial and religious inclusion, and other progressive causes. Its personnel included, at various times: Woody Guthrie, Bess Lomax Hawes, Baldwin \"Butch\" Hawes, Sis Cunningham, Josh White, and Sam Gary. As a controversial Almanac singer, the 21-year-old Seeger performed under the stage name \"Pete Bowers\" to avoid compromising his father's government career.\n\nIn 1950, the Almanacs were reconstituted as The Weavers, named after the title of a 1892 play by Gerhart Hauptmann about a workers' strike (which contained the lines, \"We'll stand it no more, come what may!\"). Besides Pete Seeger (performing under his own name), members of the Weavers included charter Almanac member Lee Hays, Ronnie Gilbert and Fred Hellerman (later, Frank Hamilton, Erik Darling and Bernie Krause serially took the place of Seeger). In the atmosphere of the 1950s red scare, the Weavers' repertoire had to be less overtly topical than that of the Almanacs had been, and its progressive message was couched in indirect language—arguably rendering it even more powerful. The Weavers even on occasion performed in tuxedos (unlike the Almanacs, who had dressed informally) and their managers refused to let them perform at political venues.\n\nBecause of this, the somewhat hokey string orchestra and chorus arrangements on their hit records with Decca Records, and, no doubt also because of their considerable, if temporary, financial success, the Weavers incurred criticism from some progressives for supposedly compromising their political integrity. It was a tricky dilemma, but Seeger and the other Weavers felt that the imperative of getting their music and their message out to the widest possible audience amply justified these measures. The Weavers' string of major hits began with \"On Top of Old Smokey\" and an arrangement of Lead Belly's signature waltz, \"Goodnight, Irene,\" which topped the charts for 13 weeks in 1950 and was covered by many other pop singers. On the flip side of \"Irene\" was the Israeli song \"Tzena, Tzena, Tzena.\" Other Weaver hits included Dusty Old Dust\" (\"So Long It's Been Good to Know You\") (by Woody Guthrie), \"Kisses Sweeter Than Wine\" (by Hays, Seeger, and Lead Belly), the South African Zulu song, \"Wimoweh\" (about \"the lion,\" warrior chief Shaka Zulu), to name a few.\n\nThe Weavers' performing career was abruptly derailed in 1953 at the peak of their popularity when blacklisting prompted radio stations to refuse to play their records and all their bookings were canceled. They briefly returned to the stage, however, at a sold-out reunion at Carnegie Hall in 1955 and in a subsequent reunion tour, which produced a hit version of Merle Travis's \"Sixteen Tons\" as well as LPs of their concert performances. \"Kumbaya,\" a Gullah black spiritual dating from slavery days, was also introduced to wide audiences by Pete Seeger and the Weavers (in 1959), becoming a staple of Boy and .... Scout campfires.\n\nIn the late 1950s, the Kingston Trio was formed in direct imitation of (and homage to) the Weavers, covering much of the latter's repertoire, though with a more buttoned-down, uncontroversial, and mainstream collegiate persona. The Kingston Trio produced another phenomenal succession of Billboard chart hits and in its turn spawned a legion of imitators, laying the groundwork for the 1960s commercial folk revival.\n\nIn the documentary film Pete Seeger: The Power of Song (2007), Seeger states that he resigned from the Weavers when the three other band members agreed to perform a jingle for a cigarette commercial.\n\nBanjo and 12-string guitar\n\nIn 1948, Seeger wrote the first version of his now-classic How to Play the Five-String Banjo, a book that many banjo players credit with starting them off on the instrument. He went on to invent the Long Neck or Seeger banjo. This instrument is three frets longer than a typical banjo, is slightly longer than a bass guitar at 25 frets, and is tuned a minor third lower than the normal 5-string banjo. Hitherto strictly limited to the Appalachian region, the five-string banjo became known nationwide as the American folk instrument par excellence, largely thanks to Seeger's championing of and improvements to it. According to an unnamed musician quoted in David King Dunaway's biography, \"by nesting a resonant chord between two precise notes, a melody note and a chiming note on the fifth string\", Pete Seeger \"gentrified\" the more percussive traditional Appalachian \"frailing\" style, \"with its vigorous hammering of the forearm and its percussive rapping of the fingernail on the banjo head.\" Although what Dunaway's informant describes is the age-old droned frailing style, the implication is that Seeger made this more acceptable to mass audiences by omitting some of its percussive complexities, while presumably still preserving the characteristic driving rhythmic quality associated with the style.\n\nFrom the late 1950s on, Seeger also accompanied himself on the 12-string guitar, an instrument of Mexican origin that had been associated with Lead Belly, who had styled himself \"the King of the 12-String Guitar\". Seeger's distinctive custom-made guitars had a triangular soundhole. He combined the long scale length (approximately 28\") and capo-to-key techniques that he favored on the banjo with a variant of drop-D (DADGBE) tuning, tuned two whole steps down with very heavy strings, which he played with thumb and finger picks.\n\nIntroduction of the \"Steel Pan\" to U.S. Audiences\n\nIn 1956, then \"Peter\" Seeger and his wife, Toshi, traveled to Port of Spain, Trinidad, to seek out information on the steelpan, steel drum or \"Ping-Pong\" as it was sometimes called. The two searched out a local panyard and proceeded to film the construction, tuning and playing of the then new, national instrument of Trinidad-Tobago.\n\nContinued on next page.\n\n3 MAY\n\nPage 2 of 6[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]3 MAY[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\nPage 3 of 6\n\nPete Seegar continued…………….\n\nRecent work\n\n2000-2009\n\nAmerican Folklife Center Symposium and Concert) (2007)\n\nOn March 16, 2007, Pete Seeger, his sister Peggy, his brothers Mike and John, his wife Toshi, and other family members spoke and performed at a symposium and concert sponsored by the American Folklife Center in honor of the Seeger family, held at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., where Pete Seeger had been employed by the Archive of American Folk Song 67 years earlier.\n\nStudio Album \"At 89,\" David Letterman Appearance (2008)\n\nIn September 2008, Appleseed Recordings released At 89, Seeger's first studio album in 12 years.In September 2008, Appleseed Recordings released At 89, Seeger's first studio album in 12 years. On September 29, 2008, the 89-year-old singer-activist, once banned from commercial TV, made a rare national TV appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman, singing \"Take It From Dr. King\".\n\nObama Inaugural Celebration (2009)\n\nOn January 18, 2009, Seeger joined Bruce Springsteen, grandson Tao Rodríguez-Seeger, and the crowd in singing the Woody Guthrie song \"This Land Is Your Land\" in the finale of Barack Obama's Inaugural concert in Washington, D.C. The performance was noteworthy for the inclusion of two verses not often included in the song, one about a \"private property\" sign the narrator cheerfully ignores, and the other making a passing reference to a Depression-era relief office.\n\nNYC Earth Day Celebration (2009)\n\nOn April 18, 2009, Pete Seeger performed in front of a small group of Earth Day celebrants at Teachers College in New York City. Among the songs he performed were \"This Land is Your Land\", \"Take it From Dr. King\", and \"She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain\".\n\n90th Birthday Celebration (2009)\n\nOn May 3, 2009, at The Clearwater Concert, dozens of musicians gathered in New York at Madison Square Garden to celebrate Seeger's 90th birthday (which was later televised on PBS during the summer), ranging from Dave Matthews, John Mellencamp, Billy Bragg, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Morello, Eric Weissberg, Ani DiFranco and Roger McGuinn to Joan Baez, Richie Havens, Tom Paxton, Ramblin' Jack Elliott and Arlo Guthrie. Cuban singer-songwriter Silvio Rodríguez was also invited to appear but his visa was not approved in time by the US government. Consistent with Seeger's long-time advocacy for environmental concerns, the proceeds from the event benefited the Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, a non-profit organization founded by Seeger in 1966, to defend and restore the Hudson River. Seeger's 90th Birthday was also celebrated at The College of Staten Island on May 4.\n\nMonterey Jazz Festival Appearance (2009)\n\nOn September 19, 2009 Pete Seeger made his first appearance at the 52nd Monterey Jazz Festival, particularly notable because the Festival does not normally feature folk artists.\n\n2010 and thereafter\n\n\"God's Counting on Me, God's Counting on You\" (2010)\n\nIn 2010, still active at the age of 91, Seeger co-wrote and performed the song God's Counting on Me, God's Counting on You with Lorre Wyatt, commenting on the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.\n\nParticipation in Occupy Wall Street (2011)\n\nOn October 21, 2011, at age 92, Pete Seeger was part of a solidarity march with Occupy Wall Street to Columbus Circle in New York City. The march began with Seeger and fellow musicians exiting Symphony Space (95th and Broadway), where they had performed as part of a benefit for Seeger's Clearwater organization. Thousands of people crowded Pete Seeger by the time they reached Columbus Circle. Pete Seeger performed with his grandson, Tao Rodriguez-Seeger, Arlo Guthrie, David Amram, and other celebrated musicians. The event, promoted under the name #OccupyTheCircle, was LiveStreamed, and dubbed by some as \"The Pete Seeger March\".\n\nHe contributed a spoken version of Forever Young to the 2012 album Chimes of Freedom: Songs of Bob Dylan Honoring 50 Years of Amnesty International.\n\nTribute to Pete Seeger at Norwegian Anti-Fascist Rally (2012)\n\nOn April 26, 2012, tens of thousands of Norwegians gathered in a show of unity at a rally in Oslo to sing Pete Seeger's song \"My Rainbow Race\" which a mass murderer had ridiculed as an example of \"Marxist\" brainwashing. The gunman was on trial for killing 77 people on July 22, 2011, insisting that his victims, who included 69 children, were traitors. The song, which Seeger wrote in 1971 to protest the war in Vietnam, has long been a popular children's song in Norway. Its lyrics include the lines: \"Some want to take the easy way / Poisons, bombs! They think we need 'em. / Don't they know you can't kill all the unbelievers. / There's no shortcut to freedom.\" Folksinger Lillebjørn Nilsen, author of the Norwegian version, led a crowd of over 40,000 in singing in both Norwegian and English. \"I grew up with this song and have sung it to my child,\" said Lill Hjønnevåg, one of the organizers of the demonstration.\" Another organizer, blogger Bagnhild Holmås, said that although song might be Utopian, \"the message is far from cheesy. [The killer] thinks we're brainwashed anyway, but it's important to show our distance. . . .\" Culture ministers from Sweden, Denmark, the Faroe Islands and Iceland joined in the singing. From the U.S. Pete Seeger voiced his support of the event.\n\nBiography: \"Pete Seeger: His Life in His Own Words\" (2012)\n\nOn July 18, 2012, Pete Seeger appeared at Bryant Park in New York City to sign copies of his new (2012) biography, \"Pete Seeger: His Life in His Own Words,\" written with Rob Rosenthal and Sam Rosenthal. He also spoke about his life and career.\n\nOn August 6, 2012, Pete Seeger appeared on the Colbert Report to speak with Stephen Colbert about his new book, \"Pete Seeger: His Life in His Own Words,\" and also to perform \"Quite Early Morning\" on the banjo.\n\nVideo of \"God's Counting on Me, God's Counting on You\" (2012)\n\nOn Election Day, November 6, 2012, Pete Seeger released the music video and single of God's Counting on Me, God's Counting on You (Sloop Mix) produced live on the Hudson River Sloop Clearwater by Richard Barone and Matthew Billy.\n\nCarnegie Hall Concert with Arlo Guthrie and Family (2012)\n\nOn November 24, 2012, Pete Seeger performed with Arlo Guthrie and the Guthrie family in a concert at Carnegie Hall.\n\nBeacon Theater Benefit Concert in support of Leonard Peltier (2012)\n\nOn December 14, 2012, Seeger performed, along with Harry Belafonte, Jackson Browne, Common and others, at a concert to bring awareness to the 37 year long ordeal of Native American Activist Leonard Peltier. The concert was held at the Beacon Theater in New York City.\n\n\"Pete Seeger: The Storm King; Stories, Narratives, Poems\" Spoken Word/Music Album (2013)\n\nOn April 9, 2013, Hachette Audio Books issued an audiobook entitled \"Pete Seeger: The Storm King; Stories, Narratives, Poems.\" This two-CD spoken-word work was conceived of and produced by noted percussionist Jeff Haynes and presents Pete Seeger telling the stories of his life against a background of music performed by more than 40 musicians of varied genres.[46] The launch of the audiobook was held at the Dia:Beacon on April 11, 2013 to a enthusiastic audience of around two hundred people, and featured many of the musicians from the project (among them Samite, Dar Williams, Dave Eggar and Richie Stearns of The Horse Flies and Natalie Merchant) performing live under the direction of producer and percussionist Haynes. [47] April 15, 2013, Sirius XM Book Radio presented the Dia:Beacon concert as a special episode of \"Cover to Cover Live with Maggie Linton and Kim Alexander\" entitled \"Pete Seeger:The Storm King and Friends.\"\n\nActivism\n\n1930s and 1940s\n\nIn 1936, at the age of 17, Pete Seeger joined the Young Communist League (YCL), then at the height of its popularity and influence. In 1942 he became a member of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) itself. He eventually \"drifted away\" (his words) from the Party in the late 1940s and 1950s.[49]\n\nIn the spring of 1941, the twenty-one-year-old Seeger performed as a member of the Almanac Singers along with Millard Lampell, Cisco Houston, Woody Guthrie, Butch and Bess Lomax Hawes, and Lee Hays. Seeger and the Almanacs cut several albums of 78s on Keynote and other labels, Songs for John Doe (recorded in late February or March and released in May 1941), the Talking Union, and an album each of sea chanteys and pioneer songs. Written by Millard Lampell, Songs for John Doe was performed by Lampell, Seeger, and Hays, joined by Josh White and Sam Gary. It contained lines such as, \"It wouldn't be much thrill to die for Du Pont in Brazil,\" that were sharply critical of Roosevelt's unprecedented peacetime draft (enacted in September 1940). This anti-war/anti-draft tone reflected the Communist Party line after the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which maintained the war was \"phony\" and a mere pretext for big American corporations to get Hitler to attack Soviet Russia. Seeger has said he believed this line of argument at the time—as did many fellow members of the Young Communist League (YCL). Though nominally members of the Popular Front, which was allied with Roosevelt and more moderate liberals, the YCL's members still smarted from Roosevelt and Churchill's arms embargo to Loyalist Spain (which Roosevelt later called a mistake), and the alliance frayed in the confusing welter of events.\n\nA June 16, 1941, review in Time magazine, which under its owner, Henry Luce, had become very interventionist, denounced the Almanacs' John Doe, accusing it of scrupulously echoing what it called \"the mendacious Moscow tune\" that \"Franklin Roosevelt is leading an unwilling people into a J. P. Morgan war.\" Eleanor Roosevelt, a fan of folk music, reportedly found the album \"in bad taste,\" though President Roosevelt, when the album was shown to him, merely observed, correctly as it turned out, that few people would ever hear it. More alarmist was the reaction of eminent German-born Harvard Professor of Government Carl Joachim Friedrich, an adviser on domestic propaganda to the US military. In a review in the June 1941 Atlantic Monthly, entitled \"The Poison in Our System,\" he pronounced Songs for John Doe \"...strictly subversive and illegal,\" \"...whether Communist or Nazi financed,\" and \"a matter for the attorney general,\" observing further that \"mere\" legal \"suppression\" would not be sufficient to counteract this type of populist poison, the poison being folk music, and the ease with which it could be spread.\n\nAt that point, the U.S. had not yet entered the war but was energetically re-arming. African Americans were barred from working in defense plants, a situation that greatly angered both African Americans and white progressives. Black union leaders A. Philip Randolph, Bayard Rustin, and A. J. Muste began planning a huge march on Washington to protest racial discrimination in war industries and to urge desegregation of the armed forces. The march, which many regard as the first manifestation of the Civil Rights Movement, was canceled after President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 (The Fair Employment Act) of June 25, 1941, barring discrimination in hiring by companies holding federal contracts for defense work. This Presidential act defused black anger considerably, although the US army still refused to desegregate, declining to participate in what it called \"social engineering.\"\n\nRoosevelt's order came three days after Hitler broke the non-aggression pact and invaded the Soviet Union. The Communist Party now immediately directed its members to get behind the draft, and it also forbade participation in strikes for the duration of the war (angering some leftists). Copies of Songs for John Doe were removed from sale, and the remaining inventory destroyed, though a few copies may exist in the hands of private collectors.[53] The Almanac Singers' Talking Union album, on the other hand, was reissued as an LP by Folkways (FH 5285A) in 1955 and is still available. The following year the Almanacs issued Dear Mr. President, an album in support of Roosevelt and the war effort. The title song, \"Dear Mr. President,\" was a solo by Pete Seeger, and its lines expressed his lifelong credo:\n\nNow, Mr. President, / We haven't always agreed in the past, I know, / "
