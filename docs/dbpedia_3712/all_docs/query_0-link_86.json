People experience grief uniquely, and normalizing that guilt is often a component of grief is important. Self-reflection is a normal reaction to the death of a loved one, but these self-messages of “I should have done this differently” are not helpful. It is important to learn how to deal with grief healthily to begin the healing process. Fortunately, there are actions you can take to come to terms with your guilt.\n\nHere are eight tips for how to cope with guilt and grief:\n\n1. Journaling\n\nJournaling is a powerful tool when experiencing grief. Putting your thoughts and memories to paper is a great way to clarify and self-reflect on your feelings and thoughts. It also helps to decrease the intensity of these emotions. Journaling also helps to chart your grief process by reviewing journal entries over time. Journaling can initially feel awkward if you have never tried it before and you are not certain about how to begin, so grief journaling prompts are a great tool to use to help get started.\n\n2. Prioritize Self-Care\n\nIt is common to forget about self-care when people are in the midst of grief.\n\nThis is especially true when guilt is experienced as a part of the grief process. Just getting out of bed can feel like a challenge. People forget to eat, exercise and can self-isolate. Guilt is a burden, and the message that comes with it is, “I don’t deserve to treat myself well.” Self-care includes taking care of your physical, emotional, and spiritual needs. You cannot begin to heal and work through grief until you engage in self-care behaviors.\n\nMental Self-Care Examples:\n\nPractice mindfulness.Take a break.Play video games.Listen to music.Read a book.Listen to a podcast.Reflect on things you are grateful for.\n\n3. Channel Your Guilt Into Something Positive\n\nIt doesn’t really matter if your guilt is rational or irrational. It is important to channel\n\nguilt in productive ways to begin to alleviate it. For example, if you have lost\n\nsomeone to suicide, work with suicide prevention programs. It will help give you insights about yourself, and learning from others that have had shared experiences can be enormously helpful. It also can offer some comfort in doing something that honors the memory of the person who has died.\n\nApologizing.Making amends.Changing your behavior.Accepting your faults and moving on.\n\n4. Acknowledge Your Feelings of Guilt\n\nYou need to be able to give yourself permission to feel whatever comes with the loss of a loved one. If guilt is one of those feelings, explore its roots and what it is really about. Are you being fair to yourself? Is your guilt based on reality, or is something else causing it? You are human, and remember that guilt often arises with grief. Show yourself compassion and learn how to forgive yourself as you explore your guilt and its source.\n\nConsider trying some of these strategies.\n\nAcknowledge it exists. ...Eliminate negative self-talk. ...Find out if there's a reason to feel guilty. ...Remind yourself of all that you do. ...Realize it's OK to have needs. ...Establish boundaries. ...Make amends. ...Understand what you can control.\n\n5. Join a Grief Support Group\n\nGrief support groups can be a wonderful way to learn how to cope with grief and guilt. It helps to hear that other people are experiencing similar thoughts and feelings. It is also a place where you can get support from others who have been through a loss. Grief support groups are places of support, education, and resources. You can find them online or locally by checking with local mental health centers, hospitals, or organizations associated with the cause of the death of a loved one.\n\nGoogleTalk to your pastor or bishop\n\n6. Find Positive Thoughts\n\nThought stopping is the practice of shifting your focus from the guilty thoughts you are having to more positive thoughts. This technique can be taught through behavior modification which involves reshaping negative thoughts into positive thoughts producing healthier behavioral patterns. It involves training yourself using different skills to stop thinking about thoughts that can be harmful to you.\n\nIdentify areas to change. ...Check yourself. ...Be open to humor. ...Follow a healthy lifestyle. ...Surround yourself with positive people. ...Practice positive self-talk.\n\n7. Share Your Feelings With Others\n\nIf you have trusted close friends and family, you can talk with them and make opportunities to talk with them about what you are feeling. It is important not to keep your guilt feelings bottled up. It also can be helpful to talk with people who know the person who has died. Their insights may help ground your memories and feelings into a more realistic perspective.\n\nTake a deep breath. There are many benefits to deep breathing. ...Practice. Constructively sharing your feelings is a skill. ...Identify and accept your emotions. A big part of effectively sharing emotions is correctly identifying your feelings. ...Choose the right listener and the right time.\n\n8. Consider Reaching Out to a Therapist\n\nGrief and guilt can be an enormous burden. They can evolve into depression. When this occurs, it may be difficult to manage and cope with grief without outside mental health professionals intervening. Healing cannot begin unless these issues are addressed. A therapist can help to unpack why someone is experiencing guilt surrounding their grief and process the emotions so they begin to ease.\n\nSigns you may need private therapy\n\nFeeling anxious.Generally feeling overwhelmed with everything.Overthinking and feeling as though you're unable to 'switch off' from your thoughts.Feeling low and more tearful than usual.Getting angry more easily or struggling to regulate your emotions.Sleeping more or less than usual.\n\nCONTACT:\n\nhttps://namica.org/\n\nABOUT OUR HOST\n\nPaul Cardall, an acclaimed Dove Award-winning musician, composer, and producer, is renowned for his music that acts as a conduit to tranquility and spiritual introspection.

In addition to owning Wasatch Family Therapy, LLC and serving as executive director, Dr. Hanks is an emotional health and relationship expert and top online mental health influencer with an extensive and engaged social media following. As sought after media personality Dr. Hanks’ advice has been interviewed for The Wall Street Journal, Cosmopolitan, Women’s Day, Parenting, Reader’s Digest, Redbook, and numerous other publications, and has appeared on-camera on Fox News, Fox Business News, KSL TV’s Studio 5, Discovery Health, TLC, and Reelz Channel.\n\nAfter speaking to large women’s groups of Latter-day Saint women on preventing emotional burnout for a decade and working with hundreds of women in her clinical practice who were overwhelmed and felt “never good enough”, Dr. Hanks felt compelled to write her first book The Burnout Cure: An Emotional Survival Guide for Overwhelmed Women.\n\nHer latest book The Assertiveness Guide for Women: How to Communicate Your Needs, Set Healthy Boundaries, and Transform Your Relationships draws from her years of clinical practice helping women to find their authentic voice in their lives, their relationships, and in the world. Grounded in attachment theory, this self-help book takes a comprehensive view of assertiveness and is filled with exercises and practical advice.\n\nAs an award-winning performing songwriter, “Julie de Azevedo” has written dozens of songs, contributed to numerous projects, and produced 10 solo CD’s over the past 30 years. Her most recent CD “The Gravity of Love” is a digital EP of 6 new songs about relationships.\n\nDr. Hanks’ most valuable experience has been “in the trenches” of family life as a wife to Jeff Hanks and mother of 4 children, 1 daughter-in-law, and 2 grandchildren.\n\nMORE ABOUT THIS EPISODE:\n\nPaul begins by engaging in a conversation with Dr. Julie De Azevedo Hanks, who balanced her career as a recording artist with her pursuit of a Ph.D. in therapy. She specializes in working with clients who are Latter-day Saints or have connections to the LDS culture, assisting them in addressing social issues and ensuring their beliefs are applied in a healthy manner to avoid any harm caused by theology.\n\nDr. Hanks responds to Paul's inquiry about why people from other faiths often perceive Mormons as exceptionally kind individuals with strong family values. They delve into the social dynamics within the predominantly homogeneous culture, particularly in Utah, where a substantial LDS population exists. Paul briefly touches upon the history of Mormons facing persecution, such as the extermination order issued by Missouri against the religious sect. He inquires about the possibility of a generational persecution complex. Dr. Hanks doesn't attribute it to a fear of persecution, but rather to a sense of familiarity. She notes that Latter-day Saints have demanding responsibilities and suggests that Mormons should openly communicate their values to friends and neighbors to establish mutual understanding of their boundaries and commitments.\n\nPaul highlights the unique aspect of the LDS Church, where individuals are actively assigned roles, integrated into small groups, and are actively involved in the community, unlike in most other churches where members need to initiate their participation. He emphasizes the absence of monetary compensation within the LDS Church and how this communal involvement provides a strong support system for every family. Dr. Hanks commends this support system and the sense of safety it fosters, with mentors guiding the youth in their service and teaching roles.\n\nThe conversation shifts to the historical practice of polygamy within the Mormon community and its association with women's disenfranchisement and objectification during that era. They discuss the belief in eternal marriage, emphasizing that it lasts forever.\n\nDr. Hanks and Paul delve into the declining church activity, which saw families conducting religious services at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. They also discuss the impact of scientific discoveries addressing questions that were traditionally considered mysteries of God in religious contexts. The internet is mentioned as a tool enabling individuals to research the controversial aspects of the Mormon faith's history. Paul queries Dr. Hanks about the possibility of people finding truth and happiness outside of the Mormon culture. She admits to being molded within the LDS faith but believes that truth can be found everywhere. Paul then questions whether Mormons are considered Christians, to which Dr. Hanks recalls being told she wasn't a Christian while attending a private evangelical school as a child. Lastly, Paul inquires about Dr. Hanks' perspective on the salvation of individuals who leave the Mormon faith or have family members who do so. She expresses her belief in the vastness of God's mercy and encourages avoiding placing limits on salvation for those whose experiences are different.\n\nABOUT OUR HOST:\n\nABOUT PAUL CARDALL\n\nWebsite - http://www.paulcardall.com\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/paulcardall\n\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/PaulCardallMusic/\n\nX - https://twitter.com/paulcardall\n\nTiktok - https://www.tiktok.com/@pianistpaulcardall\n\nLISTEN TO HIS MUSIC\n\nSpotify - https://shorturl.at/PQUW3\n\nApple Music - https://shorturl.at/jkqsL\n\nAmazon - https://shorturl.at/nxGHU\n\nShow your support by subscribing to the podcast.

Growing up under the umbrella of Mormonism, they discuss the differences in how they were raised. Paul comes from an orthodox home in Salt Lake City where his family was active in all the cultural and theological teachings of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (LDS). Whereas, Peter grew up outside of Utah and didn't have an active family. He moved to Utah, started a band, and evolved into an active Latter-Day Saint.\n\nPeter explains that there are Mormons making Mormon-themed music for Mormons sold at LDS bookstores, and then there are popular bands or singers who happen to be LDS. Paul summarizes how popular LDS-themed music has become; it’s a multi-million dollar industry. Peter clarifies that in Utah, where LDS headquarters are, because of the social network that the Church provides, when things catch on, it’s like a wildfire. There are mega trends in Mormonism.\n\nPaul talks about pioneer immigrants who wrote hymns using the contemporary style of their time. They mention that even though there is a commercial music culture, the church itself is rather strict on what they present in worship services called Sacrament Meetings, and full-time missionaries are allowed to listen to. Electric guitars and drums aren’t allowed in services. Missionaries were allowed to listen to the Tabernacle Choir and some piano music, like Paul. Today, missionaries can listen to whatever helps them feel the spirit of God, though leaders are still cautious.\n\nAs the church evolved in the 80s, there was Michael McLean, a songwriter who produced a series of videos promoting church doctrine. Missionaries would take those to those who saw the ad on TV. They talk about Mormon ad campaigns in the 70s and 80s. The songs in the ads were a huge part in persuading people emotionally and had a significant influence on the direction commercial Mormon music proceeded.\n\nPeter and Paul talk about the Osmonds, the most popular LDS musicians in the 20th century. Their fifth studio album that was on the Billboard charts is called “The Plan.” Their concept album was an opportunity for The Osmonds to share Mormon theology. There have been people who have joined the church as a result of their love for Donny Osmond. They skip ahead a few decades to talk about another famous band, The Killers, whose lead singer Brandon Flowers is a devout Mormon.\n\nIn the late 1970s, early 80s, Afterglow was a blockbuster duo whose songs were rich with harmonies. They were one of the first to have a record deal with the church-owned bookstore, called Deseret Book. Their music was overly religious with strict LDS themes. Deseret Book at the time had hundreds of stores along with hundreds of independent stores by people who sold LDS related products. Record labels began to pop up.\n\nPeter brings up Kenneth Cope, whose voice was featured in some of those Mormon ads. Kenneth wrote and recorded some of the most successful commercial Mormon music. All of this is happening while Amy Grant in the Christian market or Gospel Music Association was becoming successful, and her Christian-themed music crossed over into the adult contemporary top 40. Greater Than Us All was Kenneth’s successful debut with His Hands and Never A Better Hero. My Servant Joseph was another hit album about with songs about LDS founder Joseph Smith. Kenneth takes his responsibilities in the church seriously and when he was called to be a Bishop, in a church with no paid ministry, we didn’t hear much from Kenneth Cope until recently. He’d spent 15 years producing a new musical called \"Son of Man.\"\n\nAlong with Kenneth, Michael Webb recorded similar LDS themed songs and has since left the church. Paul says one of his favorite songs is a new Christian song by Michael Webb. Peter and Paul explore artists Julie De Azevedo, Felicia Sorensen, and other successful female artists who started to emerge in the 90s. Julie is the daughter of Lex de Azevedo, who was successful at writing LDS musicals like \"Saturday’s Warrior,\" and \"My Turn on Earth.\" He started a record label that signed Kenneth Cope, Michael Webb, Julie, and others. Julie became a popular therapist and podcast host helping countless LDS women understand their value. They mention Hillary Weeks and move into a conversation about Jeff Simpson, a former Disney producer. Jeff was ambitious in helping take LDS music forward into a more contemporary and overall style. He had a vision to make LDS music part of the broader Christian market under the Gospel Music Association. But Jeff’s label Excel was never successful because of the differences. He was successful at creating a film production and distribution entity with the breakout hit \"God’s Army\" by Richard Dutcher. Excel would later sell to Deseret Book. He also created an award show called \"The Pearls\" honoring LDS music.\n\nBefore talking about cellist Steven Sharp Nelson, Peter mentions Nashville Producer Jason Deere who created the Nashville Tribute Band, which was country music with LDS themes. Cellist Steven Sharp Nelson, who is now a member of YouTube sensation The Piano Guys, worked on hundreds of albums by members of the LDS faith. Peter shares how he met Steve and began using him in his band. Later, Paul used Steve to orchestrate his music with another brilliant LDS artist, Marshall McDonald. Both Marshall and Steven worked as a team to help dozens of artists. Paul invited Steve to let him produce \"Sacred Cello\" for Paul’s label Stone Angel Music. Steve didn’t believe it would be successful, but the album debuted No. 18 on the Billboard Classical Charts. Steve is an artist who shared the burden with artists that occurs in the studio and on the stage. Paul shares with Peter the countless LDS artists who created LDS-themed albums that debuted on the Billboard charts. Deseret Book began reporting sales to Soundscan.\n\n\"Especially For Youth\" is the next topic. The weeklong camp on Brigham Young University’s campus and dozen other colleges across the United States gathered LDS Youth from all over. EFY gave these LDS teenagers a 12-song compilation that featured a cassette, CD of LDS artists who wrote songs about the camp theme. Every kid received one. EFY music began in 1986 and continued until 2019 before the LDS Church changed the youth program. In the 80s not only did you have Michael McLean, Kenneth Cope, and Julie De Azevdeo, but over the decades, artists evolved out of these produced EFY albums. Why? They were approved by the church since the program was under BYU, a church-owned private university. Not everyone appreciated the songs, but the production was top quality. However, producers and artists were not given the standard music industry fees. Peter wanted to get involved and was at a point in his career where the LDS church listened to him. He recruited Jon Schmidt, Steven Sharp Nelson’s partner in The Piano Guys, to produce an authentic album of songs. However, they were restricted by several policies. Peter produced one more several years ago with songwriter Russ Dixon from the Utah group Colors. Concerts were also performed, and youth looked forward to it. Overtime EFY did away with the concerts because leaders felt there was too much attention drawn to the artists. There was one theme song that was the EFY “We Are The World” that brought the popular artists who were LDS together called, “Especially For Youth.” Mormons who go to the Temple make covenants that they’ll donate all their time and talents to building up the Church. As a result, artists felt an obligation to do things for free or for very little pay. They discuss firesides, which are special events inside a church building. In the beginnings, Churches wanted firesides, but overtime fewer and fewer musicians were invited to perform their music about God. Peter shares his experience being asked to perform for LDS leaders and bring his band, only they wouldn’t pay for anything. Peter would have to pay his band out of his pocket.\n\nPeter and Paul share their frustration as an artist who doesn’t do LDS themed music. Because he lent his voice to a few LDS themed songs, the music platform’s algorithm made him an LDS artist and recommends other LDS artists instead of the Americana Folk artists. Paul also shares his frustration that new material still references artists that the metadata feels is comparable to when Paul started in 1995. Paul talks about doing an album with Steele Croswhite, who was not LDS, and slowly the culture started working with people of other Christian denominations.\n\nPaul talks about his experience speaking and performing at a Missionary Fall social attended by Apostles Russell M. Nelson and Elder David A. Bednar. A previous 70s prophecy by President Spencer Kimball invited LDS members to create the very finest artist, particularly because he believed they have all the truth. He showed the apostles the classical Billboard charts that had 5 out of 10 people who were LDS. He showed that his prophecy was being fulfilled. Afterward, Elder Bednar invited Paul to write a song with him. Paul worked with Steven Sharp Nelson and Marshall McDonald to produce Paul and David Bednar’s office song \"One by One.\" Paul would later present Elder Bednar with a plaque showing he was part of a No. 1 Billboard charting album. Paul would perform this piece with LDS tenor Nathan Pacheco. Paul discusses the positive experience of doing business with Elder Bednar and the corporate church concerning owning the master rights to their song. Paul learned that Apostles do not take a royalty. If so, it goes directly to the church missionary department.\n\nPeter talks about Trina Harmon, a Nashville songwriter who isn’t LDS, has helped several Mormons evolve as writers and artists. She complimented LDS members but said she’s not yet met an LDS artist who is truly aligned with the mission of the Church. The LDS Church demands a lot of service and rules, leaving artists at odds in creating music. Paul agrees and says that anyone, LDS or not, who creates music that points people to Jesus Christ is important. They briefly discuss Paul Simon who is getting older and producing an album about his relationship with God. Maturing popular artists lean into producing faith-based recordings. Artists need to speak to the struggles. Peter talks about his daughter choosing to go on a mission and his concern that it could go one or two ways. Missionaries lean in or when they return, get out of the church.\n\nPaul shares Christian artist Andrew Peterson, who like Peter Breinholt, built a community of artists within a cultural context. In Mormon culture, there’s a little bit of reluctance towards charismatic musicians. When Peter was connecting with the youth in a fireside, the leader stood up to make sure the audience understood that Peter is not someone who they need to look up to, but to look up to God. Leaders tend to put down artists. A leader cornered Peter to ask him if he’s a kingdom builder or a Peter builder. They discuss Mormon theology about being ordained Kings and Queens, so there’s a sense of looking down on those who aren’t anointed joint heirs with God. Paul shares that he needed to strip away all the idols and ideology that stood in the way of having a full relationship with Christ. Paul believes in the Four Gospels over any new revelation from those who claim to be God’s prophets. The Four Gospels are 4 eye witnesses of the Resurrected Lord who disagree on the details, but they all tell the same story. He goes into talking about the Codex Vaticanus and the other codexes that were used by St. Jerome to give the world the Latin Vulgate. Paul gets into why he doesn’t believe in a Church that he loves with all his heart. They talk about Joseph Smith’s first vision narrative that the Church has been teaching for hundreds of years, that even LDS scholars say that narrative can’t be sustained. It’s simply not true. Peter says that artists deconstruct. It’s why artists write songs, to say something they can’t say with words. They compose how they feel.\n\nThey discuss challenges in Mormon doctrine. Paul talks about one of the Christian churches he attends called Immanuel Nashville with Pastor TJ Tims. Artists analyze everything.\n\nPaul and Peter end by setting up part two.\n\nABOUT PETER BREINHOLT\n\nPeter Breinholt is well-known performer in the Salt Lake region and became so largely through word-of-mouth. His debut record became the best-selling independently released CD ever in the state of Utah, and was described a decade after it's release as \"an underground classic\" by Salt Lake Magazine. Peter has performed for countless sold out crowds in every major concert hall in the state, including Kingsbury Hall, Tuacahn and Sundance. Utah Governor Gary Herbert recently honored Peter with the Governor's Mansion Award for Achievement in the Performing Arts for his influence as a songwriter and performing artist.\n\nShow your support by subscribing to the podcast.
