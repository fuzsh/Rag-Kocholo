        "text": "Empathic people love music. It is a balm for their sensitive soul. Listening to it, playing it, admiring it. Music can wash over and nurture you. It can elevate your spirit.\n\nI am excited to share my favorite music recommendations for empaths with you. I hope the music I’ve selected will uplift, inspire, and soothe you, as it does me. Perhaps it will trigger your creativity, dreams, healing or connection to the great Mystery.\n\nMusic therapy has been used to treat depression, anxiety, and chronic pain. Neuroscientists have found that tranquil music increases positive emotions and stimulates dopamine, the brain’s pleasure hormone–and that highly sensitive people may respond to music similarly to how they experience empathy.\n\nLet yourself dance to the music, meditate to it. Let it lift you up beyond the details of everyday life to the realm of inspiration and the muse.\n\n1. Enya\n\nEnya Patricia Brennan is an Irish singer and songwriter.
