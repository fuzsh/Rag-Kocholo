        "text": "In advance of the release of his long-awaited second book, “The Journey Within: Exploring the Path of Bhakti,” Radhanath Swami met with thousands of followers in Nabadwip, India tonight for satsang (spiritual discourse).\n\n“If we were diagnosed with cancer, and the doctor prescribed medicine that would cure it, and said we must take the cure regularly, we would take that very seriously,” he said in a characteristically down-to-earth teaching before the large gathering of devotees, which was livecast on Mayapur.TV.\n\n“The diseases of envy and forgetfulness of our eternal nature are limitlessly more dangerous than any disease of this Earth,” Radhanath Maharaja said.\n\n“Caitanya’s message was: ‘I have the medicine. Take the Names of Krishna.'”\n\nNabadwip is the birthplace of the great Vaishnava saint Caitanya Mahaprabhu, a social reformer who rejuvenated the bhakti movement in the 1500’s. Devotees believe that Caitanya was Krishna himself, incarnated as a disciple so that he could taste the sweetness of his most beloved devotee, Radharani.\n\n“There is no more powerful medicine in this age of Kali Yuga, with its ocean of bad qualities and faults,” Radhanath Swami said, pleading with the gathered devotees to chant the prescribed 16 rounds of the Hare Krishna Maha-mantra each day or risk falling victim to maya. (One round is 108 repetitions on a mala, which has 108 beads.)\n\n“Our own personal sadhana is crucial,” he asserted. “It is the fundamental basis of our spiritual lives. We should fit everything else around our spiritual practice.”\n\nRadhanath Swami is a revered spiritual leader within the Krishna Consciousness movement and beyond. His first book, “The Journey Home,” has fast become a spiritual classic tells the story of his coming of age as American yogi in India and his discovery of bhakti yoga. The forthcoming second book, which seeks to “demystify” the ancient practice of bhakti yoga, is now available for pre-order at Amazon.com.\n\nHe is in the Mayapur region as part of a month-long tour throughout India in advance of the International Yoga Conference in Rishikesh March 5-7. He returns to the West in May for a retreat at Sivananda Yoga Ashram in the Bahamas with his disciple Gaura Vani, a beloved American kirtan wallah and prominent figure in the Western bhakti movement.\n\n_____________________\n\nThe Bhakti Beat welcomes your support!

Or maybe it’s a “kirtan retreat.” By any name, big, little or in between, in your back yard or Bali, at the local yoga studio or a luxury spa, bhaktified music fests and mantra marathons are popping up everywhere. Which is a good thing. Well, at least we think so…\n\nWhen is a bhakti festival NOT a good thing, you ask? For starters, if it’s so expensive that only the wealthy can afford it, that’s a problem. The mantra revolution that Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu (most famously) popularized in the 1500’s was about bringing yoga — which at the time was a means for spiritual salvation reserved only for the highest castes of society — back to the people. Bhakti yoga was the way. Its hallmark was that it was accessible to ALL.\n\nThat’s still the case of course. Bhakti IS accessible to all. Love and devotion can have no price tag, and all one has to do to reap the benefits of kirtan is open one’s mouth and chant. But it’s a rare retreat that is offered up free, with good reason of course. These things cost money to run, after all. We get that. But a retreat that is only accessible to the wealthiest yogis has no business calling itself bhakti. There, we said it.\n\nThe point is, there’s a right way, and there’s a wrong way to run a festie. And lots of ways in between. We’ve seen ’em all. So, even though no one asked us, here are our unsolicited tips for how to do a chant fest right. (See disclaimer at end.)*\n\nMake it affordable. This is No. 1 for the reasons already stated. It shouldn’t cost an arm and a leg to get to a chant fest! Build work exchange and scholarships into the business plan. Line up sponsors to defray the costs. Set up systems so people can contribute toward “Kindness Passes” for those with limited financial means. Get creative and make it accessible to ALL, in the spirit of the bhakti tradition. (ISKCON, by the way, has perfected the affordable kirtan retreat, largely by collecting donations to subsidize the costs; the rest of the bhakti world could take a lesson from the Hare Krishnas in this regard.)\n\nGive back. Work in a charity component. Collect donations or have a silent auction, and offer the proceeds to organizations that are making a difference in your community or field of interest, or put them toward scholarships for people with limited financial means.\n\nPay the artists. Not just the rock stars either. If it’s a local community event or a charity benefit and the artists have offered their services for free, at least cover their expenses. Take care of their housing and transportation. And please feed them. Well.\n\nGive them time. Resist stacking a schedule with one band an hour. Two-hour sets should be the norm. (Three if it’s Jai or KD.) This goes for festivals of any size, local community to national multi-stagers.\n\nSound matters. Get it right, whatever it takes. And please amplify the musicians. All of them.\n\nAesthetics count. Light the artists, not the room. And please don’t make them pink or blue. Give them a nice backdrop and a place to store their equipment cases so there’s not a bunch of stuff littering up the “stage.”\n\nBuild in breaks. Have a short guided asana practice or meditation in between sets. Set aside an hour for meals if it’s an all-day or multi-day event.\n\nDon’t make us choose. Until we all have the siddhis to bilocate, could you please not have two or six things going on simultaneously? Festivals of thousands may need options, but still…the best fests we’ve been to do things sequentially.\n\nFeed people. Bring in local vendors to offer organic, farm-to-table, ahimsa-principled real food and drink.\n\nConsumerism Lite. Please sell kirtan CD’s. And go ahead and showcase local artists, crafters and conscious merchants who sell things of interest to your audience. Just don’t let the materialism interfere with the spiritualism. Give it its own space and keep it separate. No one wants to hear people hawking Lululemons in that silent space after a chant.\n\nDon’t be a douchebag. Any event that calls itself yoga or bhakti has an obligation to rise above the business-as-usual model of event production and promotion. Treat people right. Keep your promises. Set a new standard for conscious business and marketing practices. Cultivate community. Be nice.\n\n*DISCLAIMER: Not intended to be used in place of a professional event organizer’s advice. We actually have no experience in running a chant festival. We just know what works from the participant’s point of view.\n\nOkay, that’s our two-cents worth on how to build a bhakti festival we can all love. What would you add or change? Tell us in the comments please.\n\n_____________________\n\nThe Bhakti Beat welcomes your support!

(Read our report on the full list here.)\n\nAlso making the short list of New Age nominations is 10-time Grammy-nominated pianist Peter Kater’s “Love,” produced by bhakti stalwart Trish Bowden of Mysterium Music. “Love” is the latest in a long line of delightful instrumental CDs showcasing Kater’s maestro-esque chops on the ivory keys. Pure magic.\n\n“Bhakti Without Borders” is pure bhakti in the Krishna tradition. Every track is steeped in tradition straight from the Vaishnava temples in which Madi Das and every one of the female co-vocalists on this disc grew up. Madi Das’ parents met in a Krishna temple in Germany, and he was schooled in Vrindavan, India — “shaved head and all,” as he says. The female vocalists are all second-generation Krishna devotees as well, who grew up singing these bhajans and chanting the Names every day in and out of temple.\n\nIn stark contrast to a lot of kirtan out there today, which — for better or worse, depending on the track and one’s perspective — marries Sanskrit with English lyrics or lays ancient mantras over modern pop-influenced melodies, every track on “Bhakti Without Borders” stays true to its roots by sticking to traditional melodies and the original languages (either Sanskrit or Bengali, in this case). But that’s not to say that these tracks are without modern Western flourishes. “Bhakti Without Borders” was, after all, produced by Dave Stringer, the veteran kirtan wallah who is known for rocking up his own concerts with anything-but-traditional riffs. Stringer plays guitar on every track, Matt Pszonak adds some country rock flourishes with the pedal steel guitar, and classical violinist Tulsi Devi brings some countrified fiddling to the mix. Stringer describes the music as “a contagious mix of Indian, Celtic, country and bluegrass elements.”\n\nWe’d just call it pure bhakti joy, on every track. Sweet, mellifluous, vocal nectar with just the right instrumentation to not drown out the potency of the sacred words, all imbued with a loving devotional mood that epitomizes what we mean when we say bhavalicious. It’s the bhava.\n\nIncidentally, this was Stringer’s first gig producing an album other than his own works — and something tells us he’ll be doing more. Reached by facebook chat this morning just as he touched down in Los Angeles after a long flight from Australia, where he just wrapped a month-long tour, Stringer had not yet heard the Grammy news. “I’m not even through immigration yet, and it’s gonna be a great day,” he said. “I think I just started a new career as a record producer with a pretty big bang.” We’d have to agree. Here on in, he shall be dubbed: “Grammy-nominated Dave Stringer…”\n\nIt’s a great day indeed, for all of bhakti.\n\nPerhaps the best part about this CD, and the new wave of recognition a Grammy nomination will bring it, is that ALL of the profits from its sale benefit a girls’ school in Vrindavan, the Sandipani Muni School. The school, a program of Food for Life Vrindavan, provides education, medical care, food and security to some 1,500 young girls who are among the country’s poorest of the poor. Without the school, these girls would be sold into child labor or worse. Every sale of “Bhakti Without Borders” benefits these children directly.\n\nOn a personal note, it’s taking every ounce of journalistic constraint I can muster to not be screaming this news in ALL CAPS with too many exclamation points. Yeah, I, Vrinda, am pretty pumped about this one…and not just because this was my dark-horse pick for winning the New Age nomination. It’s been a favorite go-to CD since the first listen. Because, you know, #ThisisBhakti.\n\nThe featured vocalists on “Bhakti Without Borders” include well-known Vaishnavis such as NYC-based powerhouse walli Acyuta Gopi and London-based Jahnavi Harrison (whose 2015 Grammy-deserving album “Like a River to the Sea” is a must-have), along with a host of new-to-us Vaishnavi voices, some of whom have never recorded professionally before. The full list: Chaytanya Nitai, Tulsi Devi, Sudevi Devi Dasi, Carmella Gitanjali Baynie, Amrita Ananda, Nalina Kaufman, Gaura Mani, Mallika Des Fours, and Gaurangi Auman. The tight-knit group of musicians who laid down rhythms in the studio behind Stringer’s L.A. home includes long-time go-tos in the SoCal kirtan world such as Patrick Richey (tabla, cajon, mridangam and every other percussion instrument you can name); Matt Pszonak (pedal steel), and Sheela Bringi, who graces most tracks with her angelic bansuri flute as well as harmonium. Madi Das’ childhood friend Shree Shyam ‘Elton Bradman’ Das played bass, and Tulsi Devi added some countrified violin riffs. Krishan Khalsa did the mixing and Stefan Heger mastered the disc.\n\nListen to and purchase “Bhakti Without Borders” here. Also makes a great gift for your bhakti friends — one that gives back to a worthy charity. What are you waiting for?\n\nThe Grammys will be telecast on February 15 on CBS. (See the full list of nominees in New Age and all categories here.) New Age winners are generally not part of the television broadcast (BOO!) but will be on the webcast earlier the same day. Krishna Das famously nabbed the New Age nomination in 2012 for “Live Ananda,” and also became the first kirtan artist to play at the Grammys. Jai Uttal broke the ground a decade earlier with his nomination for “Mondo Rama.”\n\nKrishna Das, Jai Uttal…not bad company for the debut CD from a largely unknown wallah like Madi Das. Make that Grammy-nominated Madi Das.\n\n_____________________\n\nThe Bhakti Beat welcomes your support!

Nearly two dozen bhakti-flavored releases are among the list of contenders in early voting for the 2016 Grammys Best Album Nominees in the New Age and World categories, for which first-round voting by members of the National Academy of Arts & Sciences (NARAS) ends Nov. 4.\n\nJudging by the breadth and diversity of the bhaktified music releases on the first-round ballots, the “non-genre” of kirtan/mantra/sacred chant is alive and well — from the vantage point of the commercial recording industry, at least. The albums that we would place under a broad umbrella of bhakti or bhakti-related mostly fall into the New Age category in Grammy world, though a few of the bhakti titles are found in the World Music category. (More on the odd categorization of kirtan here.)\n\nI know what some of you are thinking…”Who cares about the Grammys?! This is BHAKTI. It’s not about commercialism, or winning awards, or being “the best” of anything; it’s about devotion and service!” I hear you. Really I do. The way I see it, if the Grammys help bring attention to the sacred practice of chanting and unlatch the gates for even one person, is that a bad thing? Tell us what you think in the comments.\n\nWho Made the List?\n\nFirst things first. One of the biggest surprises on the list — and perhaps the best news for bhakti purists — is second-generation Krishna kid Madi Das, whose charity album “Bhakti Without Borders,” produced by Dave Stringer, features duets with a host of female Vaisnava vocalists singing traditional Krishna bhajans. If we had to pick a favorite among all of these contenders, “Bhakti Without Borders” would be it. We love everything about this album, and P.S., ALL of the profits benefit a school for girls in India (which is most of the proceeds, because ALL of the musicians on this record offered their time as seva). Now THAT is bhakti.\n\nAlso up for consideration are widely known artists like Deva Premal & Miten with Manose (“Songs for the Sangha“) and Russill Paul (“Mantra Magic“) alongside up-and-comers like vocalist Tina Malia (“Bridge to Vallabha“) and folkish singer/songwriter Brenda McMorrow (“My Heart Bows Down to You“). The many flavors of Sufism are nicely represented with “Sufi Kirtan,” from newlywed folk/world/rocker duo HuDost — marked by the otherworldly vocal magic of Moksha Sommer — and a new-to-us band called Rocqawali for “Sufi Rock ‘n’ Roll,” which seamlessly blends powerful Pakistani qawali music with 70’s-style rock. Representing the Jewish tradition of sacred chant is the Kirtan Rabbi Andrew Hahn’s “Nondual,” where ancient Hebrew prayers meet modern rock and reggae. Bhaktified dance music — yet another subcategory in the chant world (is that a sub-non-genre?) — is there too, with Marti Nikko and Dj Drez’s chant-dance fantasy “Dreaming in Sanskrit” and Desert Dwellers’ electronicized house mix, “The Great Mystery.”\n\nIn the Kundalini corner, Simrit’s “From the Ancient Storm,” White Sun‘s self-titled debut album, and Sirgun Kaur’s “Dayaal” are in the running along with the ever-popular duo Mirabai Ceiba (for “Sevati“). On the instrumental end, Bansuri flute master Manose, who has played for a decade with Deva Premal & Miten, is on the ballot for “Call Within,” and Hans Christian, master of too many instruments to name here, made the list for “Nanda Devi.” An Indian classical flutist known simply as Flute Raman is found on the World ballot for an album of traditional bhajans called “Krishna Lila.”\n\nBut wait there’s more. While we can’t in any stretch of the word consider them “kirtan,” a few others on the ballots are worth noting for their inclusion of mantras in some tracks or their ties to the bhakti world, including: Peter Kater, who has three — yes three! — albums in the running for the nomination in New Age (“Heart of Silence,” “Etheria,” and “Love;” Daniela De Mari & Breath of Life for “Awakening;” David Vito Gregoli for the ambient “Om Land,” and a Classical Indian instrumental disc featuring Saraswathi Ranganathan on veena called “Refreshing Raga Blues.”\n\nAll told, the bhakti-ish contenders represent roughly 15 percent of the total New Age list of 116 titles and only a few of the 122 entries on the World ballot. The full lists cover a lot of musical ground, everything from spoken-word meditations to ethereal shamanic ritual music to ambient instrumentalism to synthesized electronica. Among the broadly defined kirtan-related releases are some real gems that deserve a closer look, and The Bhakti Beat will be doing that on a weekly basis between now and Dec. 7, when the Grammy nominations are announced.\n\nWe’ll also give one Grammy-contending CD away each week, so stay tuned to our facebook and other social media pages to enter the contests. (Links below.)\n\nWith so many bhaktified releases in the running for a nomination, this year marks a new high for mantra music in Grammy world. But it’s certainly not the first time the chant community has gotten Grammy fever. Krishna Das quite famously snagged one of the coveted Grammy nominations in 2012 for “Live Ananda,” and made history by being the first kirtan artist to perform at the Grammys (aired on the webcast). You saw that, right? A decade earlier, Jai Uttal was the first in the kirtan “non-genre” to be nominated for a Grammy, for his pioneering record, “Mondo Rama.”\n\nLast year, more than a dozen bhakti albums made the first ballot, and a record called “Bhakti” by Paul Avgerinos — a new-agey fusion of Christianized chants and ambient electronica that was about as far from traditional kirtan as you can get — made the cut to be nominated but did not win the Grammy.\n\nWhat It Means\n\nWhat does it mean to be on the first-round ballot? Essentially, it means that you met the eligibility qualifications and got your entry in on time. Ballots were sent out Oct. 14 to NARAS members, who have until Nov. 4 to cast their ballot for the album they’d like to see nominated for the Grammy in each category. There are about 30 Grammy categories altogether, including the biggies, Album of the Year and Best New Artist. In the New Age and World categories, only one Grammy is given: Best Album.\n\nLet’s state that again so there is no confusion: the first-round ballot voting is to decide who among the contenders will be NOMINATED for a Grammy in their respective categories. It’s the first step. The nominations will be announced Dec. 7, then NARAS members vote for one nominee in each category to receive the Grammy — the music industry’s highest award. The Grammys telecast this year will be on Feb. 15.\n\nSo tell us Bhakti Beaters: Who would be YOUR pick for a Kirtan Grammy?\n\n_____________________\n\nThe Bhakti Beat welcomes your support!

You should come.\n\nWhy? Well, because it’s the FIRST ANNUAL SHYAMDAS FOUNDATION RETREAT. Do we need to say more? Okay, fine. This is THE retreat in honor of Shyamdas, the beloved bhakti scholar, author, kirtan wallah, respected teacher and friend to all, who left his body — along with a huge hole in the heart of the bhakti world — in January of 2013. His inimitable spirit and legacy endure thanks in part to the Shyamdas Foundation, which is hosting this intimate retreat at the Bhajan Belt ashram that was so dear to Shyamdas’ heart. In fact, Ananda was often the first place Shyamdas would go to share kirtan and satsang when he returned to the States after winters in India.\n\n“One of the most important things Shyamdas imparted to us was to keep good association. Part of that is in the kirtan, but part of it is hearing the teachings. This is an opportunity for a more intimate setting to get fully immersed in not just kirtan, but in the teachings. There is a particular vibe at Ananda because it is an Ashram, so this has that energy with all of these people coming together to really get drenched in the nectar.”\n\n~ Ishwari of SRI Kirtan\n\nNeed more? Did I mention there will be kirtan — lots of kirtan — with Shyamdas’ tribe of musician-gopis. We’re talking Gaura Vani, Adam Bauer, Prema Hara, Steve Gorn, Nina Rao, SRI Kirtan, Devadas, Karnamrita Dasi, David Newman, Vrajdevi from Vraj, India, Arundhati and Prema from Woodstock, Yogi P from Vermont for starters…and we imagine there might be a surprise or two in store.\n\nBut wait, there’s more. Jivamukti yoga co-founder Padma Sharon Gannon herself will be leading asana practice, along with her nephew and protegé Jules Febre. There will be stories and teachings and satsangs with Shyamdas’ dearest scholar-friends, including Radhanath Swami and David Haberman, and Vallabhdas, Shyamdas’ student/co-author and the founding director of the Shyamdas Foundation. There will be readings from Shyamdas’ books. There will even be an “enchanted forest walk” with Gaura Vani and Vallabhdas that is sure to be…well, enchanted. We’re hoping Gaura brings his flute…\n\n“I see this gathering at Ananda Ashram—a place Shyam loved and where I remember countless great moments shared—as a chance to continue deepening and nourishing what I love best about my experience with Shyamdas and indeed the broader Bhakti lila: meaningful time with friends and family, practicing the Bhakti yogic arts, joining hearts and voices together in the Divine Names, and enjoying the inspiring company of other seekers of love and truth. Plus, a bunch of good prasad! What’s not to love?”\n\n~ Adam Bauer\n\nBut wait, you haven’t heard the best part of all. What makes this weekend realllllly special is the rare opportunity for satsang with one of Shyamdas’ own gurus, Shri Milan Goswami, grandson of his original Pushti Marg guru, Shri Prathameshji. These teachers are direct descendants of the 15th century bhakti philosopher Shri Vallabhacharya, the founder of the Path of Grace, who is considered by Pushti devotees to be a manifestation of Krishna and Radha, as well as a witness to the divine couple’s loving plays. Shyamdas was the first western initiate into the Pushti Marg and devoted his life to translating and sharing Vallabhacharya’s teachings.\n\nDid you catch that? That’s satsang with a living, breathing soul who is believed to be a direct descendent of Krishna & Radhe incarnate.\n\nGo ahead, take a moment to wrap your brain around that concept. We are.\n\nThen check out this YouTube playlist of Shyamdas kirtans and teachings.\n\n—————————————————-\n\nHere’s the latest schedule of what’s happening (subject to change of course).

(See the video below.)\n\n“Starting in 2016, I have to find a way to take some time off — maybe 6 months, maybe a year, I don’t know — to really quiet down, because it’s not just the body but the mind,” he told fans. “It’s really time to slow down for a while.”\n\nRumors have been flying for months in the bhakti world about KD’s health, as bits and pieces leaked out about his plans not to tour in 2016. In February, KD told participants at his annual retreat at Sivananda Ashram in the Bahamas that he was going to take some time off (but indicated that he would be back in Sivananda in 2016). The Bhakti Beat has also heard from event producers who have tried to schedule Krishna Das kirtans for 2016 and were told that he will not be touring, which has fueled the rumor mill.\n\n‘Healthful Recharging’\n\nThe announcement does little to quell rumors about the health of Western kirtan’s biggest “star,” as there was no specific information about his overall wellness in either the video message or the email newsletter in which the sabbatical was announced. The email stated that KD will take a break from touring and traveling for the purpose of “healthful recharging.”\n\nKrishna Das spokesperson Nina Rao confirmed to The Bhakti Beat in an initial email response that KD’s “Vitals are in order, just needs rest.” (We will update this article as soon as more information is available.) In the meantime, KD’s choice of words in the video message indicated the sabbatical was not an optional choice.\n\n“I have to take some time off, to try to rejuvenate, rest and try to get some juice back in my system,” he said, while noting that chanting with other people is “the greatest seva I can do for myself, for others and for my guru.” The sabbatical, he said, will allow him to “have time to be quiet, take care of my body, eat good, and just breathe. I forgot what it’s like to not be planning to go somewhere, like, in a week.”\n\nIt’s unclear as of yet whether Krishna Das will attend bigger retreats and festivals such as Omega’s Ecstatic Chant, where he has headlined since its inception 12 years ago, or Bhakti Fest, though he did say he “might do a couple local things around New York,” where his home is, and possibly some online programs that can be done from his home. KD’s annual Memorial Day weekend retreat at Yogaville Ashram in Virginia will continue as planned, as will his summer tour in the Northeast United States and Southeast Canada (see full tour schedule here). He also is making appearances this month at benefits for Nepal earthquake victims (May 16 in Princeton, NJ, in concert with GuruGanesha, with other dates to be announced) and at a benefit for tigers produced by longtime KD manager/assistant Nina Rao (May 19 in New York City).\n\nBeginning in February or March of 2016, all dates are off. “I’m going to kind of just chill,” KD said.\n\nThe news was accompanied by the announcement of a new 501(c)3 nonprofit foundation, the Kirtan Wallah Foundation, which is dedicated to spreading the teachings of Krishna Das’ guru, the late Neem Karoli Baba.\n\nClearly addressing the rumors and questions, the “Rock Star of Yoga” ended his video message with typical understatedness: “That’s the story for now. Take good care. Bye.”\n\n_____________________\n\nThe Bhakti Beat welcomes your support!

THE Jazz Fest?? The one going on right now in New Orleans, featuring Elton John, the Who, Lady Gaga, Jimmy Cliff, Robert Cray, Buddy Guy and a long list of luminaries from a genre-blending spectrum of rock/jazz/blues/gospel and more?\n\nYep, that’s the one. You can add Sean Johnson and The Wild Lotus Band to that lineup of musical legends.\n\nSo, what’s the big deal about kirtan at a mainstream music festival like Jazz Fest?\n\nThe Bhakti Beat asked Sean Johnson this in an interview shortly after the band’s set. He paused, contemplating the question, then offered this: “I feel like kirtan music gets put into a box by people who are not familiar with it. People who aren’t into yoga or meditation don’t even really give it a chance; there’s a prejudgement about what it is.”\n\nEven kirtan artists, Johnson observed, have a hard time describing what they do in words that resonate with someone who doesn’t already relate to the bhakti world. Playing a mainstream music festival, he said, “is an opportunity to put mantra music right in front of a general audience, so they can bypass their own judgments about what it might be — to really be able to experience it in their bodies rather than judging it with their minds.”\n\n“We in this kirtan subculture create these experiences and events where we can get together and be inspired by each other, but I think there’s value in the magic of what we share that can really be a gift to the wider culture,” he continued. “Mantras in and of themselves are really powerful, so if we can create experiences that bypass the boundaries that are put around certain cultural experiences, even certain kinds of art, it becomes an opportunity for the labels to become unimportant, to no longer separate us from each other.”\n\nAny way you look at it, a kirtan band at the epic New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Fest is, well, epic. And this little bhakti band from NOLA has been invited back to Jazz Fest three times so far. We’re tempted to call them a regular.\n\nParmita Pushman, the founder of White Swan Records and herself a pioneer in bringing mantra music to the mainstream, had this to say about the Wild Lotus Band’s Jazz Fest participation: “Jazz Fest features the colors and creativity of New Orleans; artists like Sean Johnson and the Wild Lotus Band are part of a vital new future for New Orleans. Kirtan music and yoga are bringing peace and music to people, but wherever it happens they also bring along their own musical influences and tastes which are seen in the expression of their song.”\n\nThe trio of Johnson (vocals/harmonium), Alvin Young (bass/guitar), and Gwendolyn Colman (vocals/percussion) has become somewhat of a legend in their own right, at least in the bhakti world. Their brand of funked-up, bluesy, soul-tingling mantra music is a favorite at chant festivals and yoga retreats, where they never fail to whip the crowds into a frenzy of ecstatic free-dance. But this band consistently delivers much more than rock-out dance mantra. They will take you deep, lift you up, and crack you open with soulful sprinklings of bhakti poetry and tear-jerker gospel classics like their signature set closer, Fly Away. Gets us every time.\n\nApparently we’re not alone. Even at Jazz Fest — a big, boisterous, outdoor, party-scene festival with a dozen stages plus parades, pow-wows and pavilions — the band moved people to tears, Johnson told us. Performing on the first day of the two-weekend Fest, the band had their biggest crowd yet in their three years at Jazz Fest, with lots of kirtan newbies plus a dedicated group of hard-core fans, friends and family, who held the response.\n\n“Many people were crying at one point or another,” Johnson said of the band’s Friday afternoon set. “I don’t know how often that happens at a big music festival, so I was really grateful that even in that outdoor, larger-scale environment with a lot of people who were not familiar with kirtan, people had such an intimate emotional experience.”\n\nWith less than an hour to play, the NOLA native said it was challenging to find a way to make the experience as accessible and comfortable as possible to people new to kirtan. He told the crowd that the language of bhakti might be a little different than what you’re used to, but what happens in kirtan is really not that different from what happens in the gospel tent across the field or even at the main stage.\n\nConnecting Through Music\n\n“I don’t want people to think that kirtan is this strange esoteric form of music from another place and time,” he said. It’s just another way of connecting through music, he said. “The most exalted moments of a stadium rock concert are when everybody knows the song; there is this communion between the band and the crowd. The essence of what happens in that experience is the same thing that happens in kirtan.”\n\nBased on the reports we heard, there was a whole lot of communion between band and crowd going on at Jazz Fest’s Lagniappe Stage during the Wild Lotus set. The band led just four songs in their 50-minute set, all from their brilliant 2014 CD, “Unity,” with a little intro to each to offer some context for the mantras. (You’ve got “Unity,” right? If not, get it here.)\n\nThey opened with the exotic, rollicking tribute to the Remover of Obstacles, “Ganesha’s Belly Dance,” then moved into the CD’s title song, a mash-up of original lyrics around the theme of oneness fused with Lokah Samastah Sukhino Bhavantu, the Hindu prayer of peace for all beings. Next, their powerful, primal Kali chant, “The Way of Love,” had the crowd leaping over hedges to dance in a grassy area near the stage in what Johnson called a “little bit of a Bhakti Fest moment…but with grass.”\n\nThen, with the revelers securely in the palm of their hands, the trio knocked it out of the park with the soulful song of hope that they wrote for the city they love in the wake of the hurricane that nearly destroyed it. “I Will Rise Again” is a moving tribute to the band’s beloved NOLA rising from the floodwaters of Katrina. It gives us goosebumps, and we’re pretty far removed from the Big Easy…\n\nWe imagine there wasn’t a dry eye in the crowd.\n\nJazz Fest photos courtesy of Bonnie Gustin Photography.\n\n_____________________\n\nThe Bhakti Beat welcomes your support!

Jai Uttal will be there. Deva & Miten too. Even Shyamdas, the bhakti world’s most beloved Ambassador of Bhava, will be there, in all his bhavalicious glory. Journey OM: Into the Heart of India, the cinematic masterpiece in the works from veteran filmmaker and original bhakti bhaiya John Bush, promises to be the bhakti movie of the year.\n\nRight now, you can be a part of this film’s development by pre-ordering the DVD and soundtrack featuring Krishna Das, Jai Uttal, Deva Premal & Miten and more. ACT FAST! The campaign ends at 1:19 a.m EST on Friday, April 24.\n\n__________________\n\nThere’s a certain mystique about India that can be hard to define. For many in the bhakti world, the pull is strong, like that of a mother beckoning her children home. There’s an almost inexplicable longing that cuts straight to the soul, not unlike what we imagine the Gopi cowherds felt for their sweet Govinda.\n\nJourney OM aims to capture that elusive quality that makes India unlike any other place in the world. But don’t mistake this upcoming film for some ordinary travelogue cataloging must-see pit stops on a well-trodden tourist path. Journey OM, according to filmmaker John Bush, takes you off the beaten track. Way off.\n\nFocused on ‘Places of Passage’\n\nBush focuses his camera on so-called tirthas, holy “places of passage” that are believed to be sacred sites where the veil between worlds is thin, where it is possible for even ordinary humans to cross over from worldly materialism to spiritual nirvana with relative ease. (Tirtha is a Sanskrit word that translates to “ford,” or a shallow part of a body of water that can be easily crossed.)\n\nMother India is rife with tirthas — legendary places with thousands-years-old histories in Hindu scripture and mythology. For example, at the very Southern tip of India is the island of Rameswaren, said to be the place from which Hanuman and Rama’s army built the bridge to Lanka to rescue Sita from the evil king Ravana, as is written in the Hindu epic, “The Ramayana.” In the holy land of Braj there is Govardhan Hill, the mountain that Krishna, as a young boy, lifted high to protect the people of Vrindavan from the torrential rains that the god Indra had let loose in his anger. And the list goes on…\n\n“These are power spots,” says Bush. “They’ve been identified over thousands of years as places of transcendence, where one can go from earthly consciousness to celestial consciousness.” Journey OM will take the viewer on a magical mystery tour of a dozen or so of these sites, with the intent of conveying a feeling of the sacredness of these places.\n\n“Each place has its own story, its own flavor,” Bush told The Bhakti Beat. “The revelations along the way are really geared to have a transformative effect for the viewer, to impart that ‘inner-journey’ experience of a sacred pilgrimage.”\n\nBush, the inspiration and perspiration behind Journey OM, is the real deal. He didn’t jump on the mantra bandwagon yesterday; his bhakti roots are deep — more than 40 years deep to be exact. He was with Ram Dass back in the days of “psychedelic evangelism” of 1960’s America. Like Ram Dass, he traveled to the Far East in search of that same feeling of transcendence, of divine consciousness, sans LSD. He met Shyamdas when Shyamji was just 19, and developed a deeper friendship with him in the weeks before he died. The night Shyamdas left his body, they had been in satsang together, and Bush was in the car that, mere minutes after it happened, came across the scene of the motorcycle accident that claimed Shyamdas’ life. They had planned for weeks to shoot footage around Shyamdas’ home in Braj for Journey OM, which is dedicated to Shyamdas.\n\nOn the Bus with Maharaji\n\nAlong with Ram Dass, Krishna Das, Daniel Goleman and a host of others, John Bush was on “the bus” — the one that Krishna Das has told the story of countless times — that arrived at its destination at precisely the same moment that the elusive Maharaji, Neem Karoli Baba stepped into the street, leaving the bewildered Westerners on board scratching their heads with mouths agape.\n\nThat moment — the first time Bush met the Indian Saint — was a turning point for the long-haired hippy from America. “My life changed dramatically at that point,” Bush says. He had been on his way back home after a series of meditation retreats in a remote Burmese monastery. Instead, he spent the next couple of years following Maharaji in a kind of ongoing pilgrimage. It was when the young Bush first connected with the age-old tradition of spiritual pilgrimage, and became fascinated by it. It was also the period where Bush connected with kirtan, taking his turn as one of the Western wallahs in Baba’s entourage.\n\nLater, back in the States, Bush roomed with Jai Uttal in Berkely for a period, and joined with Uttal, Krishna Das and Bhagavan Das in a bhakti band called “Amazing Grace.” They made a kirtan album, played at festivals and toured the Pacific Northwest, essentially launching the careers of three of the bhakti world’s best-known wallahs. But unlike his bandmates, Bush — a new father at the time — decided the life of a professional musician was not for him. He moved to Cambridge, Mass., and settled into a more traditional lifestyle, albeit one where kirtan and satsang continued to have a strong presence.\n\nFast-forward to the year 2000 or so. Career finished, Bush returns to his “long-deferred dream” of sharing with the world, through film, the sacred cultures he fell in love with as a youth. He filmed and produced an award-winning trilogy of pilgrimage films to Southeast Asia and Tibet, which were aired on PBS and around the world. His documentary feature film, “Vajra Sky Over Tibet,” is endorsed by the Dalai Lama and has been screened as part of the official program of His Holiness in more than a dozen cities.\n\nBush describes Journey OM as “wall-to-wall bhakti.” Not only does the soundtrack feature Krishna Das, Jai Uttal, and Deva Premal & Miten, but the entire film is steeped in the bhava of the devotional journey.\n\n“Pilgrimage is part of the yoga of devotion,” he says. “My hope is that through the cultural immersiveness of this film, the viewer has their own transformative experience, their own inner journey.”\n\nContribute Now to JOURNEY OM’s kickstarter campaign.\n\n_____________________\n\nThe Bhakti Beat needs your support!

At current rates, it may affect 10 million by 2020.\n\nThe previously rare condition, dubbed kirtananandanitis by its discoverer, is commonly known as “bhav brain.” It seems to be caused by prolonged periods of chanting kirtan, an obscure practice popularized in 15th century India that, like yoga, has gained a huge following in the West. The CDC issued the alert after a team of scientists discovered evidence of the condition in every town and village.\n\nWhile the highest concentrations were found in and around spiritual hot spots such as temples and ashrams, chant festivals, progressive universities and Jivamukti yoga centers, there was also startling evidence of the condition in living rooms across the nation, where people are increasingly gathering to chant in community, for free.\n\nA CDC spokesperson emphasized that there was no imminent danger associated with the increasing incidence of bhav brain. In fact, he called it an encouraging trend, given the stress-reduction and brain-health advantages of participating in a community-oriented spiritual practice involving singing, dancing and playing musical instruments. He cautioned, however, that practitioners of kirtan tend to do a lot of hugging.\n\n“We just thought the public should be aware that this is increasing, and if they notice these kinds of gatherings where people are chanting and dancing and generally loving one another, that there’s nothing to be concerned about,” he said.\n\nSymptoms of bhav brain include markedly decreased attachment to one’s self-identity, blurring of the demarcation between “self” and others, disillusionment with materialistic gain, and reduced anxiety about what the future may bring (see bhakti scholar Shyamdas explain it in the video below). Some people report experiencing a sense of divine union under the influence of kirtan. In extreme cases, bhav brain can produce symptoms suggestive of intoxication or drug use, which might include inexplicable elation, stumbling or wandering aimlessly, or general “spaciness.”\n\nIf you or someone you know is experiencing any of these symptoms, experts suggest you immediately assume a lotus position and repeat your mantra of choice 108 times. Do not — we repeat, do NOT — attempt to drive.\n\nThe Bhakti Beat broke this story a year ago, when Dr. Baba Bhavakirtanananda first reported the results of his multinational brain-imaging study. Read the full story here.\n\nHere is an explanation of the bhav from a leading scholar and practitioner of bhakti yoga, the late Shyamdas, who described what it means to be “in the bhav” during a workshop at Bhakti Fest, one of the Western kirtan world’s largest gatherings.\n\nIf you like this, you might also like “10 Signs You Might Be a Kirtan Addict”\n\nThe Bhakti Beat needs your support!

The short version goes like this: When Hanuman was building a bridge to Lanka so Ram’s army could march across the ocean and rescue Sita from the evil Ravana, Hanuman was lifting entire mountain tops and making stepping stones of them. Meanwhile, a tiny spider in his path was rolling a grain of sand to add to the bridge. Hanuman bellowed at the spider to get out of his way, and was about to brush him aside when Ram stopped him, and stiffly reprimanded him. Ram saw no difference between the spider’s meager offerings and Hanuman’s mighty ones, because both were inspired by honorable intentions. The spider was helping in the best way he could, and though it was a mere grain of sand in an ocean, Ram accepted it as if it were mountains.\n\nIf you’re like me, you’ve had a few spider days — the kind where you feel like you’re pushing a grain of sand into an ocean. And then something comes along and tells you to keep pushing.\n\nInspiring Gratitude\n\nRecently, The Bhakti Beat received a generous grant from Call and Response Foundation co-founders Susan Murphy and Ed Ritz to purchase a new laptop for The Bhakti Beat. The sorely needed upgrade enables us to better handle and process the many large video files and images from Bhakti Beat reporting and gives us livestreaming capacity. We are deeply grateful for this gift of encouragement.\n\nIn its wake, another Bhakti Beater asked if we have a Wish List?\n\nWell, yes, we do have a Wish List. (Well, we do now.) Thank you for asking!\n\nCash donations, one-time or recurring, are always welcome! Just click here. All monies are used to directly support The Bhakti Beat’s mission to spread the devotional love of bhakti through reporting and commentary from the mantra music world: News, Reviews, Interviews & Videos. Directed grants are also welcome, like Ed & Susan’s gift to soup up our video processing capacity.\n\nGifts-in-kind are great too. Here are some things on our Wish List right now that would help us better serve the bhakti community:\n\nTech Supplies\n\nURGENT NEED: Wireless Router (Ours just died!)\n\nSolid-state portable hard drive, 1T or more (2 needed)\n\nGood compact computer speakers\n\nWide-angle lens for Nikon D3100\n\nTravel Related\n\nFrequent Flyer Miles or Airline Vouchers\n\nGas Cards\n\nHotel or Couch-Surfing Vouchers 🙂\n\nProfessional Services\n\nPrinting Services (e.g., for business cards or stickers)\n\nWeb Services (e.g., for website redesign/consult)\n\nTechnical Services (e.g., Mobile App development)\n\nAnd while we’re at it…\n\nWe have a dream. It’s called the #BhavBus. It is an alternative-fueled camper-van with solar-powered roof panels and space for a few passengers, and its mission is to spread the bhav, reporting and livestreaming from #everytownandvillage across this big ole’ kirtan country and beyond. Do you have one of those in your backyard waiting for a makeover? Want to help us make this program a reality? Do you want to be on the bus? Contact me, Brenda (email: bpatoine@aol.com) to find out more.\n\nHowever you can help, grain of sand or mountain top (bhav bus?), know that it is received with deepest gratitude and is put to the highest use: to spread the love of bhakti.\n\nHare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare\n\nHare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare\n\n“My dear Lord, kindly engage me in your service.”\n\n________________\n\nConnect with The Bhakti Beat!\n\nSubscribe to The Bhakti Beat\n\nThe Bhakti Beat on facebook\n\nThe Bhakti Beat on twitter\n\nThe Bhakti Beat on YouTube\n\nThe Bhakti Beat on Google+\n\nDonate Here."
