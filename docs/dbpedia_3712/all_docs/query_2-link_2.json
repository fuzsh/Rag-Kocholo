Witnessing the poverty of these simple but loving people, he made a promise to be a voice for the disadvantaged. His extraordinary video footage is featured in Rick Ray’s award winning film “10 Questions for the Dalai Lama.”\n\nIn 2002, he founded the Aura Imports Sponsorship Project to promote education for children in the Himalayan world. Their goals are achieved primarily through child sponsorship by uniting impoverished students with individual sponsors, giving them the tools and opportunities necessary for success.\n\nHis company, Aura Imports, is committed to promoting the social and economic progress of people in the region by marketing their handcrafts in a just and direct manner. Proceeds from the web site help over 100 deserving Tibetan and Nepali students."
