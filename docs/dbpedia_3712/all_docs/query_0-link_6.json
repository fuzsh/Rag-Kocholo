You acknowledge that any messages, including any STOP or HELP requests, you send to a short code or telephone number we have changed may not be received and we will not be responsible for honoring requests made in such messages.\n\nThe wireless carriers supported by the Service are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages. You agree to provide us with a valid mobile number. If you get a new mobile number, you will need to sign up for the program with your new number.\n\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that we will not be liable for failed, delayed, or misdirected delivery of any information sent through the Service, any errors in such information, and/or any action you may or may not take in reliance on the information or Service.\n\nWe respect your right to privacy.

Our eGift Cards are purchased just like any other item in our store. You choose the amount, add a personalized message, and the card will be delivered right to your inbox where you can treat yourself or you can send it to someone as a gift. eGift Cards include your personalized message and a gift code in a lovely layout.\n\nPlease keep in mind:\n\n* We offer electronic gift cards only; we do not mail physical cards to recipients. We recommend that you purchase gift cards directly from our Site and retain your receipt. We cannot guarantee the validity of gift cards purchased from third parties, especially from third-party online marketplaces where scams are common. Gift cards that have been stolen or fraudulently acquired are subject to cancellation by Sounds True regardless of whether you purchased the gift card from the third party without knowing it was stolen. Here are some common questions about our eGift Cards and the answers to them:\n\nAre there any fees associated with the purchase of an eGift Card?\n\nNo. You will only be charged the face value of the eGift Card, and we will not impose any shipping, taxes, or additional fees.\n\nCan I change the value of an eGift Card after I've paid for it?\n\nNot at this time.\n\nHow do I cancel the purchase of an eGift Card?\n\nYour eGift Card is not returnable after purchase (except as required by law) and cannot be canceled.\n\nWhat are the minimum and maximum dollar amounts I can purchase for eGift Cards?\n\nThe minimum is $15; the maximum is $150. However, if you wish to purchase an eGift Card for more than $150, please contact Customer Service. Email: support@soundstrue.com; Phone: 1-800-333-9185 (US only), 303-665-3151 (international).\n\nWhen is my credit card charged for my purchase?\n\nYour credit card is charged at the time of purchase.\n\nWhat exactly does the recipient receive when I send an eGift Card?\n\nOn the delivery date you choose, an email is sent to the recipient informing them of your gift, with the eGift Card you created, your personalized message, its value, and a code number. The email also gives simple instructions for redeeming the eGift Card.\n\nWhen is the eGift Card sent to the recipient?\n\nThe eGift Card email is sent to the recipient on the date you choose. It can be sent immediately or scheduled to be sent up to one year in the future.\n\nWhen does the eGift Card expire?\n\nThe eGift Card expires five years after the initial purchase date.\n\nWhere can I redeem my eGift Card?\n\nYou can use your eGift Card at SoundsTrue.com on any Sounds True product (excluding live events, monthly subscriptions, or Continuing Education credits). You can apply the gift card balance to your shopping cart at checkout and will be prompted for additional payment if your total exceeds your gift card balance.\n\nDo gift card purchases qualify for special offers or promotions?\n\nNo, the purchase of eGift Cards does not count toward the purchase amount required to be eligible for free shipping or promotional offers.\n\nCan I use the eGift Card to purchase Sounds True products on other websites (such as Amazon)?\n\nNo, not at this time.\n\nCan I add value to my eGift Card?\n\nNo, not at this time.\n\nHow do I know the recipient actually received the eGift Card I purchased?\n\nYou will receive an email message confirming delivery.\n\nIf I want to return a product I bought with an eGift Card, will I receive another eGift Card?\n\nNo, the refund goes back on the original eGift Card and the expiration date remains the same. If you used an eGift Card and credit card for the order (because the total price exceeded the amount of the eGift Card), the refund goes back to the eGift Card before the credit card.\n\nWhat if I lose my eGift Card?\n\nPlease contact Customer Service. Email: support@soundstrue.com; Phone: 1-800-333-9185 (US only), 303-665-3151 (international).\n\nI’m having trouble using my eGift Card. Who should I contact?\n\nPlease contact Customer Service. Email: support@soundstrue.com; Phone: 1-800-333-9185 (US only), 303-665-3151 (international).\n\nI purchased an eGift Card as a gift for someone, but they haven’t received it yet. What should I do?\n\nPlease contact Customer Service. Email: support@soundstrue.com; Phone: 1-800-333-9185 (US only), 303-665-3151 (international).\n\nDo you sell physical gift cards?\n\nNo, not at this time."
