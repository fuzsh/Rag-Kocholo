Boulder (Colorado), USA – Silver Wave Records will release 10 Questions for the Dalai Lama, the soundtrack for the documentary film of the same name. The score was composed by pianist Peter Kater, known for his new age recordings and collaborations with Native American flutist R. Carlos Nakai. With guest appearances by chanting Tibetan monk and teacher, Tulku Orgyen; Tibetan Flutist Nawang Khechog; and Native American flutist R. Carlos Nakai, the listener is beckoned to step off the plateau of worldly affairs into the realm of self-realization and divine grace.

The Tibetan bowls, cello, piano, strings and flutes add to the music’s spiritual character. seduction and give the listener the sense that questions, once so seemingly urgent and consuming, have already been answered and dissolved by beautiful strains of flowing harmony and bliss.10 Questions for the Dalai Lama will be available in stores August 1.

The Dalai Lama will be visiting North America in September.
