They implement policies that are of massive negative effects on citizens in a near future but positive at immediate for political gains (e.g. re-election), such as indiscriminate borrowing, creation of temporal jobs, indiscriminate reduction of interest rates, favoring of few (mostly to fund campaigns). For instance, the British Prime Minister will always get whatever law, policy, reform etc. it wants from both the Legislature and Executive arms, The American president will get whatever it wants from the Legislature and the Executive because the American vice president is the head of the Legislature and it will be more autocratic if same party has a majority in the House of Representatives. And the head of the Judiciary is an appointment made by the Executive and the Legislature, a single ideology, which is a single person. From the American and British established political systems, the believed existence of separation of power is a delusion."
