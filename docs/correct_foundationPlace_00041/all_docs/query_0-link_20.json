        "text": "Meta (META), Facebook’s parent company, is downsizing its office footprint in New York City’s Hudson Yards, Bloomberg reported Nov. 30. The firm has decided not to renew its lease at 30 and 55 Hudson Yards, according to the report, which spans 250,000 square feet. The lease runs through 2024.\n\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter\n\nThank you for signing up!\n\nBy clicking submit, you agree to our <a href=\"http://observermedia.com/terms\">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties.

The company is subleasing a “small portion” of space at that tower, but remains committed to anchoring its local footprint in New York City, including at 50 Hudson Yards, Tracy Clayton, a Meta spokesperson, said in an emailed statement. Meta recently opened a new office at the redeveloped James A. Farley Post Office building in Midtown Manhattan.\n\nThe decision to cull office space comes after Meta laid off about 11,000 employees, or 13 percent of its workforce, earlier this month. In addition to letting go of workers, the company has imposed a hiring freeze through next year, and is cutting back on discretionary spending."
