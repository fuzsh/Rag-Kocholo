        "text": "One of our major project intervention area is Rural Enterprise Development and Climate Change. Over the years, the growing implications of climate change have brought it to the centre stage of development programs. In the verge to promote food and livelihood security.\n\nMETA Foundation works with communities, groups and cooperatives as a strategy to deliver development interventions. The META Foundation uses enterprise as a strategy to reducing rural poverty and contributing to healthy environment through trainings, alternative livelihoods, clean energy activities, plastic waste recycling among women, sustainable agriculture practices and tree growing.\n\nThe implications of climate is getting severe hence must be checked. Strategies such as plastic waste recycling ♻ are gear towards enhancing a healthy environment and creating livelihoods for the vulnerable.\n\nPlastic recycling refers to the process of recovering waste or scrap plastic and reprocessing the materials into functional and useful products. This activity is known as the plastic recycling process. The goal of recycling plastic is to reduce high rates of plastic pollution while putting less pressure on virgin materials to produce brand new plastic products. This approach helps to conserve resources and diverts plastics from landfills or unintended destinations such as oceans.\n\nThe Need for Recycling Plastic\n\nPlastics are durable, lightweight and inexpensive materials. They can readily be molded into various products which find uses in a plethora of applications. Every year, more than 100 million tons of plastics are manufactured across the globe. Around 200 billion pounds of new plastic material is thermoformed, foamed, laminated and extruded into millions of packages and products. Consequently, the reuse, recovery and the recycling of plastics are extremely important.\n\nWhat Plastics Are Recyclable?\n\nThere are six common types of plastics. Following are some typical products you will find for each of plastic:\n\nPS (Polystyrene) – Example: foam hot drink cups, plastic cutlery, containers, and yogurt.\n\nPP (Polypropylene) – Example: lunch boxes, take-out food containers, ice cream containers.\n\nLDPE (Low-density polyethylene) – Example: garbage bins and bags.\n\nPVC (Plasticised Polyvinyl chloride or polyvinyl chloride)—Example: cordial, juice or squeeze bottles.\n\nHDPE (High-density polyethylene) – Example: shampoo containers or milk bottles.\n\nPET (Polyethylene terephthalate) – Example: fruit juice and soft drink bottles.\n\nCurrently, only PET, HDPE, and PVC plastic products are recycled under curbside recycling programs. PS, PP, and LDPE typically are not recycled because these plastic materials get stuck in the sorting equipment in recycling facilities causing it to break or stop. Lids and bottle tops cannot be recycled as well. “To recycle or Not to Recycle” is a big question when it comes to plastic recycling. Some plastic types are not recycled because they are not economically feasible to do so."
