        "text": "We have a short application process that can get your application on the radar of a number of funders. In some cases that will be all the information they need, in other cases a specific funder might reach out for more information, or to invite you to a deeper process. Our goal is to make our application process quick and easy, usually just requiring information that a project has already created. Sadly, we can not respond to specific questions or give feedback on the applications, and will only contact those that seem like a good fit. Leave all optional fields empty if they do not apply to you (do not write \"N/A\"). We will have a higher bar and a longer process for larger grant sizes."
