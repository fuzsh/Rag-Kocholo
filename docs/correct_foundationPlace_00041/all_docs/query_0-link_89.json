        "text": "The Best Buy Foundation is teaming up with Meta to power six Best Buy Teen Tech Center® locations across the country. It’s a major investment by Meta that will bring augmented reality and virtual reality technology and hardware to our growing network of safe, after-school spaces that provide tech access, training and mentorship for youth.\n\nThe first of these Meta-powered Teen Tech Centers is celebrating its grand opening today at the Boys & Girls Clubs of the Peninsula at the Moldaw-Zaffaroni Club in East Palo Alto, California. The center will provide teens with access to cutting-edge technology, including tools for film, digital media, audio engineering and music production. The new collaboration builds on the Teen Tech Center mission to improve access to tech and help develop the necessary skills to thrive in high-demand tech roles.\n\n“We are excited and proud to collaborate with Meta to support teens with new opportunities to build brighter futures through tech,” said Andrea Wood, Best Buy’s vice president of social impact. “By working together, we know we can inspire young people through technology, strengthen the talent pipeline in our communities and support youth as they pursue their dreams — now and in the future.”\n\nBuilding brighter futures\n\nWe believe that anything is possible for today’s teens, but a lack of opportunity and access to tools and training makes it harder for many young people to reach their full potential. The Best Buy Teen Tech Center® program funded by The Best Buy Foundation provides safe, after-school spaces where teens can get hands-on experience with the latest technology. Adult mentors and volunteers provide the support to create, innovate and explore.\n\nThe augmented reality and virtual reality technology and hardware provided by Meta will support teens in developing critical skills through hands-on activities and exploring career pathways in those spaces.\n\n“We’re thrilled to partner with Best Buy on their Teen Tech Centers. Meta is committed to providing high-quality immersive experiences and increasing access to learning through the latest technology,” said Meta’s director of partnerships, Lauryn Hale. “As we build toward the metaverse, it’s important to help level the playing field and make this cutting edge technology accessible.”\n\nThe new Teen Tech Center is our 49th location, and we’ve set a goal of supporting 100 Best Buy Teen Tech Center® locations by 2025, expanding the program’s reach to more than 30,000 teens each year."
