Understanding your Meta-Major will help you choose a major and degree based on your interests, knowledge, skills and abilities. Identifying with a Meta-Major will also help you choose classes that relate to a specific degree — achieving your academic goals as efficiently as possible.\n\nUsing the Meta-Majors Program Mapper\n\nWebpages within Hartnell's Program Mapper are grouped by Meta-Major. Start by selecting a specific Meta-Major (click on icons above).\n\nOnce you've selected the Meta-Major of choice and proceed to its Program Mapper page, you'll see the Certificates and Degrees Map, which lists the various degrees, certificates and awards available to explore at Hartnell College.\n\nBelow that is the Career Explorer, which presents potential careers and occupations with descriptions, job growth predictions, and average expected salary range.\n\nTo learn more about a specific certificate or degree, select it to continue.\n\nOn the next page, you will find a brief description of the degree and a term-by-term mapping to effectively and efficiently choose the correct courses towards completion.\n\nAfter exploration and selection of your preferred Meta-Major, it is important to schedule an appointment to meet with a counselor in order to create an Individualized Educational Plan.\n\nTips for Getting Started"
