Such a bad banner - assumes I know about this.\n\nTry putting something like \"Keep Wikipoedia going\", or \"Sponsor wikipoedia\" \"Can you help wikipoedia\" or \"Wikipoedia needs you\"\n\nOut of curiosity — How did you think this was funded? Seb az86556\n\nI could start my own wiki server in my basement for next to nothingLawstubes\n\nNot with the traffic we get, you couldn't. :) Philippe (WMF)\n\nWe are looking forward to your version of wikipeida, lawstubes. Please let us know when it goes global :-)\n\nAdd to wikipedia a system that enables editors to compile a list of referenced facts in association with any particular article, these facts would be contained in a TAB much like the DISCUSSION tab. However, each 'fact' is maintained as such (a fact) by the editing community by way of VOTE. Down rated facts are not removed from the list, but categorized into expandable subsections, such as 'nonsense', 'well established' etc. Each 'fact' would need to be a single sentence (colons and semi colons allowed) covering the single topic of the fact its self. This being the only rule in association with the creation of a 'fact' other than the requirement that a 'new' fact is in fact \"new\" and not already on a list. If this basic database were added to wiki, I would be glad to make yearly donations of $50 or more! Lawstubes\n\nI applaud another successful donation drive.. Congrats, Wikipedia et al!\n\nI do have a request though... the site seems to have suffered quite a bit in SPEED/RESPONSE ever since the redesign of it.\n\nIs there anything you all can do or incorporate into the programming to give us the speed back?\n\nAnyway... good luck throughout the future! Waz\n\nI'll happily pass your feedback along to our user interface team. Thank you for your kind words. Philippe (WMF)\n\n(French) Salut, il y a une petite erreur de conversion sur this page qui indique que 16 millions de dollars américains correspondent à 5,25 millions d'euros, la conversion correcte serait plutôt 16 millions d' USD = 11.93 millions d' €. Merci d'avance à l'Utilisateur qui pourra corriger ça sur le wiki de la wikimediafoundation. Linedwell@frwiki\n\n(English) Hi, there is a little conversion error on this page which indicate 16 million USD = 5,25 million €, but the true conversion should be 16 million USD = 11.93 million €. Thanks to the wikimedianfoundation's wiki User who can correct this. Linedwell@frwiki\n\nChanged, thanks! The page will eventually be overwritten by a new letter (hopefully fairly soon. :-)) If you can help with the translation process, that would be most appreciated. Thanks again, PeterSymonds\n\nHi there, if everyone donates money, then doesn't that make Wikipedia a venture? ie. look up venture on your own website?\n\nNothing wrong with being a venture in the original sense, as long as it's not \"for profit,\" and nobody's forced to pay for it — while donations are highly appreciated, no-one's gonna block your ability to read wikipedia if you don't donate. That's probably the difference. Seb az86556\n\nI was going to download $5 but when i clicked that option and went to pay through paypal, the amount due was $25. I've looked at the code and it seems there is a typo. URL: http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/WMAU-SLQ8?utm_medium=sitenotice&utm_campaign=20101226WMAU&utm_source=20101226_SLQ8&country_code=AU\n\nHi there - it appears that you went through a page created and maintained by Wikimedia Australia. Given the crucial nature of a mislabeled donation button, however, I've had one of our staff members change that and we've notified them. Philippe (WMF)\n\nIn \"A Thank You from Wikipedia Founder Jimmy Wales\", this sentence -- \"Our very first fundraiser was just a community effort to buy a volunteer—who later became our first CTO—a much-needed new laptop.\" -- puzzles me. Was the first CTO a laptop?\n\nThe volunteer got the laptop - English, much?\n\nI've found so much value in wikipedia, especially with regard to my kids' homework. It's an amazing resource that I use at least 5x a week. I wasn't able to donate much this year, but am embarking on a new career that will hopefully help me to both donate more and contribute intelligence to this wonderful resource.\n\nSo, thanks\n\nIn the Estonian Wikipedia there is a sidebar link \"Annetused\" (Donations) which leads to this page. Is it right? Doesn't it have to be that page?\n\nOn that page there is text at the bottom of the green box \"Et annetada kohalikule Wikimedia harule, klõpsa siia.\" (To donate to local chapter, click here). Link \"klõpsa siia\" leads to a page in English dating 2009 and there is no information about Estonian chapter. Also, there is no information of Wikimedia Estonia on the Contact us page. Could it be fixed? Wikimedia Estonia was established on July 25th 2010. Our contact information:\n\nWikimedia Estonia\n\nTedre 29-15\n\n11311 Tallinn\n\nEstonia\n\nhttp://et.wikimedia.org\n\nAdeliine\n\nThose links are set up to go through Special:LandingCheck, which leads to a localized page for each area. For those chapters which are category 1 (able to receive donation as a result of participation in the annual fundraiser), they can set up a link to their own chapter landing page for anybody within their own country following a sidebar link. For those chapters which are category 2 (receive fundraising as a result of a grant making process from the Foundation), the donation sidebar links lead to WMF donation pages. The chapters then apply for funding as a result of chapter grants. So, the links are correct. Wikimedia Estonia is a category 2 chapter. --Philippe\n\nI've setup a redirect from the wmf:Annetused (last year's page) to wmf:WMFJA1/et (this year's page). I've also added WMEE's information to the wmf:Contact us page and sent you an e-mail asking for other information about Wikimedia Estonia. Cbrown1023 talk\n\nHey! It looks really bad when Jimmy Wales thank you message has this clanger error:\n\nThey have to do it, because the Wikimedia websites and movement keep growing.

Do you mean the links at the bottom of the page, under \"Projects of the Wikimedia Foundation\"? If so, they appear to be working okay. It's possible that you tried while there was a server problem. Refreshing or purging your cache (ctrl+f5) might fix it. Let us know how that goes. PeterSymonds\n\nHello !\n\nThis page (and maybe others) has not been updated for quite a while. I may do that, if you need (of is guillom is not free to do this).\n\nBest regards, Trizek here or on wpfr\n\nMerci for volunteering to help with translations! All translation work is done on Meta-Wiki and then later copied over to Foundationwiki. The translation workspace for the French local chapters page, for example, is Translation requests/WMF/Local chapters/fr. Just update the translation with the English version (Translation requests/WMF/Local chapters/en) and then update the status box on the right-hand side of the page to |fr |ready. (Click the +/- on the side of the box.) After you do this, someone will sync it over to Foundationwiki. Cbrown1023 talk\n\nOK, I'll do that asap. Trizek here or on wpfr\n\nThere is some incorrect information re: Marlene Danielle longest running performer in Broadway history.She replaced Wendy Edmead and was Bombalurina for Eighteen Years. She has also not been included in your list of American dancers. I am her mother and can provide a biography approved by her.\n\nHi there. This page is only for comments about the Wikimedia Foundation website itself. However, I have moved your query to the biographies of living persons noticeboard on the English Wikipedia, where this page is hosted. Please keep an eye on that page for any responses. Best, PeterSymonds\n\nNot really sure where to post this, but... The front page (http://www.wikipedia.org/) which has always had the \"big\" languages around the puzzle globe log arranged in order of number of articles. Polish has been a couple thousand ahead of Italian for some time now, but is still listed after Italian. Contributions/69.3.227.82\n\nThe \"top 10 ring\" on Wikipedia's front page has actually been arranged by number of visits per hour (according to stats.wikimedia.org) since 2008, as mandated by a community poll. That's why Polish is listed after Italian. Hope that helps. – Minh Nguyễn (talk, contribs)\n\nre \"DowntonAbbey\" - your wikipedia entry is probably incorrect in saying the castle used is in Hampshire. All other sites - PBS etc - say Berkshire.\n\nNope. en:Highclere Castle was the filming location, which is in Hampshire. The other sources are wrong. Best, PeterSymonds\n\nHi! Please note that this page is only for discussing http://wikimediafoundation.org, the official Wikimedia Foundation website. ⇒SWATJester Son of the Defender\n\nHello. I am a wikipedian from Spain since a few years ago and I have some requests for you:\n\nFirst of all, I'll show you two facts:\n\n# The Wikimedia Foundation supports Wikipedia and all the sister projects throughout the world.\n\n# The Wikimedia Foundation is financed by people from all over the world, who spend their money, and also put their effort and faith in what they think to be a cause without barriers.\n\nIf so, then, why is the Wikimedia Foundation website only available in English? Isn't it possible to hire a translator for just 5% of the money you spend on high executives and make the WMF available, at least, and for a start, in the main 5 languages in the world, for instance? It's a bit frustrating to see that you donate your money and they don't even have the deference to show where your money goes in your own language. Many people don't speak English, and the original Wikipedia is no longer Wikipedia and nothing else, but the English Wikipedia, and that means that there's also a French Wikipedia, a German Wikipedia, a Spanish Wikipedia, and so on. Sometimes I have the feeling that people who don't speak English are just ignored by the WMF (although their money is not ignored, but accepted). Isn't that inconsistent with your strategic plan?\n\nOne second thing I'd like to talk about is the kind of examples you use sometimes. For example, I couldn't believe Ms. Gardner's words when she said that one of the consequences of the gender gap is that Wikipedia (I suppose she's talking about the English Wikipedia) has less articles about knitting. What about articles about psychology, or nursing science, or embryology? I don't know if it's not the case in the US, but in Spain (among other countries) we are very sensitive to sexism in language, and I think that the knitting example wasn't a fortunate example for what it implies, and many people in the Spanish Wikipedia are annoyed about that.\n\nThe last thing (so far :-)) I'd like to point out is transparency. In Spain, for example, the salaries of our politicians are public. In your annual report, you showed several percentages of different areas where the money was spent, but:\n\n# How much money did each person earn?\n\n# What did each one of them exactly do during the past year?\n\nAs donators, and thus, legitimate benefactors, I think we should be informed about every single detail of the donating-and-spending process. When you donate money for an African village, for example, you even receive photographs of the children you are helping; a lot of effort is put into making you think that it's really worth the pain, that they really care, and that's the basic attitude for a charity-reliant organisation, I think. With $16M raised this year and more than $20M predicted for the next year, I'm sure you will find how to spend a bit of all that money to make us trust you -and I mean trusting you in our own language-, because trusting you means trusting in a better world.\n\nSincerely yours, Dalton2 Note: this message is also available (in Spanish) to all the people with access to the Spanish Wikipedia, from the nearly 450 million people who speak (and in most cases, only speak) Spanish in the world.\n\nOn an off-topic but sightly related note, a suggestion was previously made to increase the number of non-Anglospheric articles submitted for publication on the English Wikipedia's 'Today's Featured Article' section. A copy of the discussion thread can be viewed here. Best: HarryZilber\n\nOK, it's an interesting topic, but it has nothing to do with this one. I'm not talking about the articles in the English Wikipedia, but the Wikimedia Foundation itself, which receives all the donations, and thus has the responsibility of making people all over the world know why they should continue sending their money. In a nutshell: We want to know exactly what they are doing, and we want to understand what they're saying, and English is not our native language, so we can't. That's the least we would expect when we send a donation. I'm speaking in plural because I'm talking in the name of the Spanish Wikipedia a lot of users of the Spanish Wikipedia who think the same. Sorry to be so blunt, but I think it's better tell it like it is. Best regards. --Dalton2\n\nDalton, I gree with your request and I'm waiting an answer, but you can't talk in the name of a project, nobody can. As Dalton says, this message doesn't talk anout English Wikipedia, it talks about the Foundation, and how the other languagues different to English aren't at the same level in it, and of course about the money. --Millars\n\nYou're right, Millars, it was my mistake. I am talking in the name of all the people who agree with me in the Spanish Wikipedia, specially those ones who are not able to come along here because they can't speak English. Best regards. --Dalton2 P.S: Anyway, although I admit my mistake, I think that the most important thing here is far beyond my personal mistakes, i.e., a matter of forms.\n\nOf course, the really important thing is to read an answer from the Foundation, a good one. --Millars\n\nI'm not really sure what you're referring to here. We have localized pages in wmf:Category:Languages and welcome even more. Cbrown1023 talk\n\nThank you for your reply. Well, I'm referring to translating all the WMF pages into Spanish, and keep them up to date. You do speak English, so you don't need to translate those pages to understand them, and so do all the English-speaking people. But, what about the non-English-speaking people? Will they have to wait until somebody comes along and decides (in an altruistic way) to translate them? What would it happen if nobody does it, or if they have to wait for weeks or months? I don't have that much time and I'm not motivated enough to do such a task by myself and keep the work up to date when I know that English-speaking people don't need to do that. Do you think it's fair? That makes people feel like they are playing in the second division. Do you think they would feel like donating money when they can't even understand what they are donating for and when they know that the only reply is: \"it's not our problem if you don't understand us\"? Regards. --Dalton2 P.S: I'm waiting for a reply on this topic and also on the other point, i.e., the money details.\n\nAnd, please, I don't want to be misunderstood: I didn't mean that bracelets aren't important, what I meant was that when you're talking to the whole community of women in the world you have to be cautious with the examples you choose, just that. --Dalton2\n\nHi Dalton2,\n\ntranslation of organizational information has always been a volunteer endeavor, one which we can always improve at, and one you're more than welcome to get involved with. Before we would even consider paying people to translate content, I think it would be a much better investment to pay a translation coordinator, improve translation tools, develop clearer priorities about what needs to be translated, etc. We've talked about this possibility and may end up hiring someone to do this full-time.\n\nRegarding transparency, see the activity reports, the associated monthly report card, the blog and techblog, our active participation on countless open mailing lists, IRC office hours, etc. Much of our actual work is being done in the open, with public code commits, public server admin logs, public issue tracking and of course countless public wikis. So you can in many cases literally track minute individual actions of a staff member. We even have a Twitter/identi.ca feed for all HR comings and goings. In terms of reporting and being accountable for the actual work that's being done, I'd love to see examples -- any examples -- of organizations that do a better job, ideally with links to their reports, public communication channels, activity feeds, and metrics.\n\nSalaries reflect a private agreement between employee and employer, and outside governments, are generally regarded as private and personal information with the exception of disclosure requirements imposed on top earners. One has to understand the dynamics of the public sector to be entirely different from the private sector. Governments are heavily regulated, reduce managerial flexibility, and typically are designed to support employee longevity over performance, by means of standardized pay schedules and limited managerial discretion. In the private sector, flexibility and performance are regarded as key to enabling innovation and a competitive environment where high performers thrive.\n\nThe pressures on employees are also different. A private sector employee who accepts a significant pay cut to do a job they love will not want that information to be disclosed to their next employer, for fear of sabotaging their career. Imposing disclosure requirements in a competitive space with a higher turnover can therefore actually reduce your ability to recruit people who are interested in the work first and foremost and/or drive up your pay. Moreover, the lack of standardized pay makes internal conflict as a result of a full salary disclosure much more likely. Such disclosure would also reduce the ability to achieve cost savings through negotiation.\n\nNon-profits are recognized to typically be somewhat in the middle between public and private sector. There's a greater need for accountability in spending, but NPO managers must be able to exercise reasonable discretion in hiring and performance-based compensation. This is, in the US, achieved by requiring non-profits to comply with certain disclosure requirements, which include salary disclosure of key employees in the form 990. The definition of key employee by the IRS requires that an individual meet 3 requirements: 1) Receives over $150K in reportable compensation, 2) has certain responsibilities and/or manages a certain % of activities, assets, income, expenses, etc. of the organization and 3) is one of the 20 employees (after satisfying the above) with the highest reportable compensation from the organization. Employees who do not meet all 3 of these tests are not listed on this part of the Form 990 as per the guidelines of the IRS.\n\nFinally, regarding the reference to knitting as an example: Can you provide a citation for this? I'd like to see it in context..--Eloquence\n\nYour answer has been translated into Spanish and posted in the Spanish Wikipedia. As I said, I'm not talking in my own name, so I think I shouldn't go on by myself. The knitting example topic (friendship bracelets) was brought from here. Anyway, I think it's a topic with almost no importance when compared with the other topics presented here. Thank you very much for your reply. --Dalton2\n\nI do want to note that this is not something Sue said (nor is it attributed to her). The examples were chosen by the author of the article.--Eloquence\n\nHi Wikimedia Foundation Feedback: here's a suggestion on a possible new fundraising source that may be both practical and able to generate significant funds, submitted for consideration.\n\nAside from the annual fundraising drive which appeals to many Wikipedians, its entirely possible to have a separate benefactor donation system linked to every article page. It would permit readers of Wikipedia articles to make payments to both the contributors of an article, and to Wikipedia itself.\n\nI'd recommend involving an electronic payment company such as PayPal, Visa, Matercard, Amex... (companies which I have no employment relationship with) to administer the actual processing of payments. I would imagine that such a company might provide the electronic payment processing for Wikimedia on a pro bono, or at cost basis since it would likely not involve a great deal of effort on their part because it would use their existing infrastructures.\n\nThe Wikipedia encyclopaedias have several stakeholders -let's reward the two principals. I believe this would benefit both Wikimedia and the quality of the articles at the same time. The two most important stakeholders are, naturally, Wikimedia, which runs and enables the entire organization, and the editor/contributors who both create and upgrade the encyclopedia articles. One system can benefit both stakeholders, and at the same time provide a greater motivation for expansion of articles and their depth.\n\nNew donation system\n\n1) DONATION SYSTEM PROCESSOR: a donation processing agreement is coordinated with a company such as PayPal. The processor would receive the payments from readers, aggregate them and then bill them monthly to the readers that volunteer to make such payments. As per the procedure schedule and furmula, the payments would be made to both the registered-contributors/editors and to Wikimedia itself.\n\n2) ENROLEMENT OF DONATORS: the Wikipedia encyclopedia would offer readers, via a hyperlink, the opportunity to register themselves for microdonations, and then make such donations while reading its articles. Registration of benefactors would be handled by the processing organization, which would obtain valid credit card or bank account information from those wishing to donate. Doubtlessly, many readers have been impressed by the broad scope of articles available, and by the depth and quality of its many individual articles. Let's allow such readers the opportunity to provide a modest award to the article's contributors and to Wikimedia at the same time. The range of donations can be set with minimum/maximum limits: expressed in U.S. currency, perhaps 5 cents at the minimum, and perhaps $1 at the maximum, per article, that the reader wishes to award. For simplicity, such donations would be tax exempt: no formal donation paperwork would be issued regarding donations for income tax purposes.\n\nIf a reader found an article compelling and educationally satisfying to him/herself, the reader could click on a micropayment hyperlink button to make a payment, either for a default amount or another amount within the min/max range. After confirmation, that payment data would be registered with the payment processor. At the end of the month, the payment processor would aggregate the donations and bill the benefactors' registered credit cards or other accounts. Ex: if a casual reader read 20 quality articles in a month, and then donated perhaps 10 cents for each one, that person would be billed exactly $2.00 on his or her credit card or other account, paid to both the article's registered editors who wish to receive such payments, and also to Wikimedia (as applicable).\n\n3) ENROLMENT OF ARTICLE WRITERS AND EDITORS: contributor/editors would be permitted to register themselves if they wish to receive such payments.\n\nPayments could be make to valid PayPal, credit card or direct deposit bank accounts.\n\nTo reduce the operational costs, payments would not be made unless the registered contributor/editors had such accounts, i.e.: no time-consuming or expensive payment methods would be employed, such as mailed cheques.\n\nRegistration of the editors/contributors would be entirely voluntary; they would receive such payments only if they personally take the time to register themselves.\n\nAny such payments would be classified as a contract service: no withholding taxes or other fees would be applied, and it would be up to the contributor/editors to register their own earnings if income taxes were applicable.\n\nIf a minimal payment transaction fee were required by the payment organization or the bank or credit card company to handle the cost of the payment service, it would be deducted from the payment. If a registered contributor/editor were to receive a payment of $25 and a 15 cent service fee was required to cover the transaction, then he/she would receive a net payment of $24.85. Wikimedia would obviously have the ability to veto the use of any payment service that proposed exorbitant rates for such payment transactions.\n\n4) PAYMENT CALCULATIONS AND ASSIGNMENTS: Do Not Award Contributors By The Number Of Edits They Made To An Article That Has Received Donations! Some contributor/editors (of the 'starving artist' category) would likely change their edit style to inflate the number of edits performed to create or upgrade articles.\n\na) Award the payments on the basis of the percentage of article's length that the editor has written which has not been reverted. If the hypothetical article 'The History of Pie' was written and upgraded by a total of three award-registered editors, and a combined total of seven unregisterd/IP editors, and if editors A, B and C hypothetically wrote 20%, 15% and 10% respectively of that article, then at the end of the payment period Editor A would be awarded 20% of the aggregated payments collected, Editor B would receive 15%, Editor C would receive 10%, and the remaining 55% of the amounts collected would be awarded to Wikimedia itself.\n\nb) The percentage each individual registered contributor/editor would receive would be calculated by the amount of editorial material he or she contributed, minus any materials reverted by others. If the case of 'The History of Pie', if Editor A had contributed 40% of the article, but 20% of his/her contributions had been reverted due to inaccuracies, then that person's net contribution to that article would be calculated at 40% - 20% = 20%, resulting in an award of 20% of the aggregated collections for that article.\n\n5) NET BENEFITS:\n\nReaders who wish to reward article writers for the efforts would now have a vehicle to do so with;\n\nArticle writers who have a need for some extra funding would be able to receive such payments;\n\nArticle writers would also be encouraged to create more articles and expand existing ones: exchanging 'knowledge for change';\n\nArticle writers would be encouraged to improve the quality of their articles, since the greater the quality, the greater the reward. Its exactly like busking: the more you impress and move your target audience, the more change they'll drop in your hat;\n\nMany writers will not wish to register themselves to receive such payments; those portions, as well as the portions performed by IP editors will default to Wikimedia. If the hypothetical The History of Pie article receives an aggregate total of $100 in donations in a one month period, and only $45 is awarded to the registered editors, Wikimedia would benefit by receiving the remaining $55 for that article;\n\nFinally, a certain percentage of unregistered IP editors may be encouraged to sign up for Wikipedia accounts! Hooray! More registered Wikipedians creates more Wikipedia involvement (hopefully of the positive type)—another plus!\n\nPlease contact me if I can be of further help in refining this suggestion.

Bem as duas palavras estão corretas e podem ser usadas para o instrumento, porém deve ser esclarecido algumas notas: Sitar vem da palavra sânscrita: Sat Tar, sete cordas. É indiano, não persa(uma vez visto que o alicerce desta antiga civilização já era hindu, classificada na arqueologia como civilização indo-iraniana.) Sehtar é um instrumento persa de cordas. Cítara e Saltério são os instrumentos de cordas da europa(da antiga civilização indo-européia) sob uma caixa trapezoidal. Como podem ver Sehtar e Cítara advem da palavra Tar(fios ou cordas) sânscrita, a língua mãe. Quero deixar claro que não sou eu quem está falando, mas a história. Não a convencional. Existem Gharanas, escolas na Índia que falam que o Sitar vem do Sehtar ou Shahtar, do Sitar ser um aperfeiçoamento da milenar Tritantri Veena, e outras defendem a tese de que o Sitar sempre existiu na Índia como uma Veena aperfeiçoada com Tarab, cordas de ressonância ou simpáticas. Melhor seria falar Sitar mesmo, pois a palavra Sitara, na Índia significa Star, estrela. Dhaivat Raj-Sitarist: www.myspace.com/dhaivatraj\n\n\"2008/2009 Annual Report\", on the main page?

PeterSymonds\n\nYou know how you guys have links within the text?\n\nI thought it would be nice if when you hover your mouse over a link, to have a small popup window with a brief, at a glance explanation of whatever it was. Then you could be reading the text, and if a word came up you werent familiar with, you could get a concept of what it means quickly, while still reading the original text. Then, afterwards, you could go back and click the link to learn more with your enhanced perspective of the general material.\n\nSo yeah, if you could make that happen that would be swell.\n\nOn different Wikis, they have implemented a gadget called \"navigation popups\". You need to be logged-in to activate it. Do so by going to \"my preferences\" at the top of the page, selecting the \"Gadgets\" tab, then (on Meta) clicking the checkbox titled \"Navigation popups\". This is not a unified feature across different projects, so you need to enable it on each wiki you visit. Note that some of these projects don't have the feature at all, however.

She exposed an international sex trafficking ring in post-war Bosnia, won a law suit against a major international company for wrongful termination and now has a motion picture about her experience. Can someone please illuminate for me why she doesn't have a listing?\n\nYou mean a Wikipedia article? Sounds like a question for Wikipedia:Project:Village pump (miscellaneous), if anywhere, but I think I can answer here: Note that the page has never been deleted. I.e. it's not there because no one has made it yet.\n\nI think the bottom line is that if you have reliable sources about her, her Bosnia activities and the movie, you can start a new article. Please do - sounds like you're the person for the job. --Chriswaterguy\n\nI have just created the article en:Kathryn Bolkovac, and linked it with some other articles, such as \"The Whistleblower\". Regards, 190.64.176.168\n\nPlease see the concern I raised at w:Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)/Archive 83 #Attributing Wikipedia.\n\nIn brief: based on a literal reading of Wikimedia Foundation's Terms of Use it looks like someone can just copy a whole Wikipedia page, add a link to the WP article in the \"External links\" section without explicitly attributing WP, and that satisfies the requirement as described. I'm sure that's not actually the intention, but it seems like a problem. I know one wiki which is reusing Wikipedia content, simply linking the Wikipedia page under \"External links,\" based on this interpretation. --Chriswaterguy\n\nThe Terms of Use provide simple guidelines and refer explicitly to the text of the license for details. Both the guidelines (\"provide credit to the authors\") and the license itself are clear about the intent of the attribution requirement. I'd assume good faith about attribution in the External Links section, but a gentle reminder that it's potentially confusing and misleading regarding the text origin and attribution seems appropriate.--Eloquence\n\n\"... and general information to the 1,000,000+ strong Wikimedia community.\" ← What is this about? --MZMcBride\n\nIs there an \"official\" number somewhere on how many active* wikimedians there are?

Qwfp\n\nHello,\n\nI guess that statistics counts as or equivalent experience Huib talk Abigor\n\nBut a statistics BSc or MSc appears just as relevant to this job as a degree in computer science or mathematics, if not more so. So why should someone with a statistics degree be required to have work experience as well when someone with a computer science or mathematics degree isn't? 62.31.61.207\n\nIt's just how it's phrased. It could be cumbersome to give an exhaustive list of all possible majors that would really fit the job opening -- just the \"best degrees\" (usually the most generic degrees that would apply) are listed on open positions. This may mean that statistics degrees aren't something that they're interested in, or it may mean that they didn't want to have a big block of possible majors listed. If you think you'd be a good fit then apply and make a case for yourself. :) Banaticus\n\nthere in no specific reason, but entire bible is of belief and facts which our generation not seen , and fighting for unknown reason which can not be answered by any one in the world ,because entirely is a day dream for examples i can prove a person on the other phone line ,but what about the god in general\n\nThe site has a broken link ...

Il n'y avait pas d'autre pays dans le monde où monter un tel événement ? Pour un événement tel que Wikimania, je pense qu'il serait à l'avenir souhaitable qu'un projet aussi humaniste que Wikimédia ait l'ambition de choisir ses lieux d'événements non pas seulement en fonction de leurs facilités balnéaires, mais aussi en fonction de critères tels que : le respect des droits de l'homme et des minorités, le respect de certaines valeurs démocratiques, la corruption régnant dans le pays...

Open your \"free encyclopedia\" to everyone. Moderate it by users only and take away the absolute power from admins, who infact only should care about the technical aspects of this \"free encyclopedia\".\n\nUntil you wont do that, wikipedia is just an autocratic dictatorship of virtual power, given to asshats who play benito mussolini in virtual reality. — The preceding unsigned comment was added by 91.62.52.128 (talk) 08:05, 24 April 2011\n\nJust passing by to point out that this is (at least theoretically) how it works in the first place, since administrators aren't employees of the Foundation* but instead selected by the community via discussion.

Starfallen\n\n* - There are, of course, some WMF employees with administrative access. Some have it due to technical need, and they tend to not interact with the community other than support capacity. Others were granted these rights by the community, typically before they were WMF employees, and would be treated similarly to any other administrator. Either way, if employee/admins have such issues, there are forums for complaints. Please specify if this is the case.\n\nIANAL, but I fear Terms of Use incorrectly treats CC-SA and CC-BY-SA licenses as identical. \"By attribution\" would require some kind of acknowledgment or credits by users, while CC-SA only requires a similar \"share alike\" license.

I posted questions on several pages of the survey and have also sent an e-mail to the organizers. Nobody answers and nobody is seem to be in charge. The survey is a total disgrace and if the Wikipedia Foundation claims that it reflects the views of the editors this is totally untrue. The survey is just a waste of time and of money. It also shows that the foundation has no respect for the editors who actually keep wikipedia going. It doesn't matter what we say, we are not worth an answer. I have tried to find a site where complaints can be sent to wikimedia. There is no complaints site. Of course, this is normal, as nobody is interested in hearing and solving complaints.

I'm sorry you had a negative experience with the survey and I hope to better understand the specifics of the problems you had so we can improve it for the next time we do this. I would say that the foundation does care a lot about the editor community and while the survey did not come off perfectly, it has been a success overall and we have completed responses from over 5,000 editors and will share the results with the community, so we can all learn from the feedback. --Bnewstead\n\nIf you want to discuss your issue with others (particularly people not being paid by the Wikimedia Foundation), subscribe to foundation-l.

The Helpful One\n\nDear Wikipedia:\n\nHave you considered giving visitors to Wikipedia the option of giving a donations at the time of use? Some charities allow one to sign up for a contributions each time they use some web option (e.g., Goodsearch). It seems likely that many users of Wikipedia would be happy to check off a donation of some amount that they judge is related to the value received. One could arrange with, say, PayPal to have it charged to their credit card. In this way the contribution is more directly linked to the value and potentially possible to encourage donations from users who do not regard the site as a \"charity\" and hence do not make regular donations.\n\nI am sure you have considered charging for use of Wikipedia and rejected it. I think allowing users to choose what they would like to contribute--including nothing--could make the whole difference in how people would regard this option.\n\nSincerely, Robert MacDonald 69.107.75.223\n\nI think that every person should have a wiki soo people could now more about them.

Of course, there are articles that will be incorrect due to vandalism or malicious people, however we have dedicated volunteers and tools that help us to remove this to make Wikipedia as accurate as possible.

You can only read what oppinion your government has on Bin Laden not the overall knowledge. I 've read lots of things about the editing on here and found it very vauge and a lot of false names and very bad knick names that people in there right mind would not use. I find this as very suspicious and would like any one to question this. I belive i am part of the public so my knowledge i would like to share is wiki- is massively decieptive due to government which i belive 'government' to basicaly translate to 'interprit lies' which most likly this comment will be barred or removed maybe even IP address traced without my permission. Fair enough i am a fanatical conspirocy therorist but so should everyone as the scale of deception is built by law and maybe i could be classed as a traitor but i have no idea who is the good guy as everyone has been totaly brainwashed into total numb knowledge that is designed to enslave us. I dont wish for my body to be enslaved/controled by a parrasite nor do i expect public knowledge to change the way i think or belive or trust or support, every person has his or her but mostly his, most likely, aggenda and wiki public knowledge is edited to your countries aggenda and by higher powers for all areas most probly, overruleing government with government. Even knowledge taught to your children is only avaliable from public knowledge which means that your children are brought up only learning your countries own oppinion/theroy. Theory is flawed by political aggenda and sensored by complex laws etc and secrecy acts and statutes to make sure we only have enough information to make other people more money on what we work hard to produce and in return get the lower class and lower knowledge to make sure that the rich and power hungry people/states make enough profit on what we make to support there lavish space missions and oppresive society to keep us all thinking we are happy an the best contry in the whole world and making all people belive in all the knowledge of your countries legal standing on what is contrived to be public knowledge.\n\nIf anyone wants to disagree with my oppinion then by law you must not, I obviously encourage people to question me and everything hence the 'must' which i belive to mean 'may' so you may not question me means that may not or you can if you want by the freedom of human rights. must has to give you a choice by law for humans to be free. But i think any law can also be translated so that you have a choice of weather you belive the judges interpritation of the law. Obviously some are easier than others to get out of but i belive that even the most hainace crimes can be thrown out if a)more than a certain amount of people support these actions or maybe if you can prove that you did it for patriotic reasons.\n\nThis is obviously all theory and would only use this as a guide when understanding or questioning knowledge that is processed by patriotism not by imparsiality that every person should be able to access.\n\nIs law just another way of stopping good intentions? or a way to make money or solve societys problems. Dont think drug dealers are any worse than our goverments controling natural resources by force and saying that necesity states that by law you can do this if it is for the benifit of man not the benifit of the earth or other celestrial bodies, just for one of many living, free organisms that reside every where. The elected few at the top of all this must disscuss who is the most inteligent race or areas and then distribute them unfairly amonst the richest countries first as they gain the most public knowledge and less and less inteligence for less inteligent/rich(poor) contries.\n\nIs this not related to everyone assioated with wiki? In any way you secret societys know. Im sure you will straight recive everything on here even if you wont let me reach my audience as you obviously.\n\nAll this is based on my knowledge that i have procurred through questioning everthing it is the best explaination to all the miss leading and vauge explanations given by this company and think you should give me a comment to help me understand, but i wont stand under, why this propoganda is nessacary. I dont know the real facts but i know that deception is almost paramount to keep the public dosile enough to bend to your aggenda.\n\nThis is my hard work and my brain just trys to fit everything together and this is what i come up with and i have no outlet which will make you happy but i will eventually change the world and anybody involved with deception, which i think is covered up will be held accountable. I do have the right to any information not owned by a single human. No collective company should hold any information that contridicts the apparent choosen facts. All i see from wiki is a vauge onesided repository of knowledge. Am i not making my point about what needs to change? Its called humanism or full naturism that doesnt have any excuses or exeptions not even if the public knowledge is distributed from the people that have higher purpose than my own as we are all equal, but your staff get to read anything well thats the impression your meant to get but im sure my essay will never reach the light of anyones attention, will it?\n\nLove and freedom and equality and health etc for everyone love every humun as god (me/you) would love you.\n\nJoeKingDealer — The preceding unsigned comment was added by Joekingdealer (talk)\n\nСтоит добавить на этой странице ссылку на http://www.wikimedia.ru/fund/donations.html, так как часть людей не в курсе, что можно задонатить по смс/вебмани/Яндекс.Деньги.\n\nI would create the italian version of this page but I don't know how. :) -- Raoli\n\nSee Translation requests/WMF/Staff, but seem the source page was outdate :( --minhhuy (WMF) (talk)\n\nThank you very much!

If this is the #5 most visited website, the ad revenue should be MORE THAN ENOUGH to cover the server costs. Instead of asking for money from poor college students, why not accept money from rich businesses and corporations?!

You don't have to do it all at once; NPR has \"underwriters,\" which is a more subtle form of advertising that does not conflict with requesting donations. Not even NPR does without government funds nor without business underwriters. AND they have pledge drives too. If they can do it, why can't Wikipedia?\n\nHi there.

Surely that's the opposite result of what they're looking for with this.\n\nAlso his frequent self-designation as founder, like the photo, is borderline egomaniacal and is disputed even within Wikipedia itself. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Wales (\"He is historically cited as a co-founder of Wikipedia, though he has disputed the \"co-\" designation, declaring himself the sole founder.\") and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia (uses \"co-founder\" throughout\") and consider also http://www.larrysanger.org/roleinwp.html\n\nLike it or not, Jimmy's face works [2], and the quicker we raise the money we need, the quicker the banners are gone. We are using other people from the staff and community we've found to work well also.\n\nPersonally I feel \"founder\" is neutral on the issue, note that the banners don't say \"sole founder\" or even \"the founder\". Pcoombe (WMF)\n\nI love Wikipedia and under most circumstances more than ready to donate, but am summarily poor at the moment. But as far a bit of rhetoric goes, the frowning, punishing faces that keep popping up really kind of make me mad. Am I an errant teenager who has used his parents auto without permission?\n\njust wanted to add Deutsche Bank to the list of companies doing corporate matching. thanks.\n\nDone, thanks! Pcoombe (WMF)\n\nBesides money, you may ask for bandwidth, or use of PC as server just like the SETI program did. Isn't that possible\n\nRegards, Mariano Esteves\n\nThanks for the suggestion Mariano. Unfortunately that only works well for problems like those SETI were doing where the computing work can be easily split up. Serving websites, especially ones that are constantly changing like Wikipedia, is more efficiently done using centralised servers. Pcoombe (WMF)\n\nVery well written! Congratulations!\n\nHi, the German version is rather terrible to read, its a very clumsy translation (although yes, one does understand it). How can one volunteer to improve it?\n\nI've updated it to use our latest appeal, which hopefully has a better translation. If there are still improvements to be made, you can edit by following the instructions here and we'll copy it over to the live site. Pcoombe (WMF)\n\nthis is a real bummer for you. The page for german wikipedia asking for the yearly christmas donation (and each year I love to donate! and I love Jimmy Wales' asking \"bambi eyes\") - this page has s broken link.\n\nBummer, the link is for the \"donate monthly\" option.\n\nThis page: https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserLandingPage?uselang=de&country=AT&template=Lp-layout-default&appeal-template=Appeal-template-default&appeal=Appeal-default&form-template=Form-template-default&form-countryspecific=Form-countryspecific-control&utm_medium=sitenotice&utm_source=B11_Donate_Jimmy_AvsB&utm_campaign=C11_1114_AvsB_AT\n\nbropen link: label is \"Monatlich spenden\", link goes to same page. (https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserLandingPage?uselang=de&country=AT&template=Lp-layout-default&appeal-template=Appeal-template-default&appeal=Appeal-default&form-template=Form-template-default&form-countryspecific=Form-countryspecific-monthly&utm_medium=sitenotice&utm_source=B11_Donate_Jimmy_AvsB&utm_campaign=C11_1114_AvsB_AT)\n\nor maybe you intentionally did this and the monthly payment is actually activated, but will be visible after many clicks later - then - bummer! If I click something, I expect a reaction on the page.\n\nanyway, I took the trouble to write this text, as I really wish your conversion rate of people donating is high! because I love wikipedia. And havign a broken link on your \"getting money raking in\" page would be a bad thing for all of us. hth.\n\nThanks for reporting this. When you click the link the page you get is similar, but the button changes to \"Make a monthly donation\". Pcoombe (WMF)\n\nHi, Time and again, I attempt to donate to Wikimedia and your systems reject my attempt. The Visa debit card I use is good for Amazon.com and BritishAirways.com and a host of other eCommerce sites. So the problem is either at your end or your bank's end.\n\nFix your donation systems - it's clearly losing you money. I make reasonable attempts to donate, but cannot use PayPal so give up when, typically, your systems reject my attempts.\n\nFYI: This time round, the URL was: https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FundraiserLandingPage?uselang=en&country=BE&template=Lp-layout-default&appeal-template=Appeal-template-default&appeal=Appeal-default&form-template=Form-template-default&form-countryspecific=Form-countryspecific-variable1&utm_medium=sitenotice&utm_source=B11_Donate_Jimmy_AvsB&utm_campaign=C11_1114_AvsB_BE\n\nGood luck!\n\nRonan\n\nHi Ronan, sorry to hear that you've had trouble getting your card information through our system. We appreciate your dedication and the fact that you continued to try.\n\nBecause of the uniquely high-profile nature of Wikipedia and its sister sites, we've had to initiate a series of very aggressive filters to prevent fraudulent transactions. Unfortunately, a small number of legitimate users get caught in those filters, and it appears you're one of them. There are a few things you should know: 1) After a certain number of attempts, our system locks you out for a couple of days. 2) The address you enter must match exactly the address and zip/postal code that your debit card company has on file for you. 3) Your name must match exactly the name on file for you.\n\nIf you wish, you can attempt to give again in a couple of days. Or we have a page listing other ways to give, including by check.\n\nAgain, sorry for the inconvenience, and thank you for your support. Pcoombe (WMF)\n\nHi, thought I would suggest adding a share option on your donation page (ie page by Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales). If you add it at the bottom right of that page where you have \"Make a monthly donation\" etc it would put the idea in people's heads to spread the word. I wasn't aware of another way (it didn't work properly when I copied/pasted the link in the address bar) and had to hunt around to find another link in your FAQs which leads to another link on how to spread the word. I think it would make it easier if you put that link on the original page, I'm sure it would increase people's awareness that they can do more than donate - spreading the word is twice as beneficial to you (and us). Cheers =)\n\nThanks for the suggestion. We want to avoid adding extra elements to the donation page as we've found it reduces the number of completed donations. However we do provide links to share on Facebook and Twitter on the page you see after donating: https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Thank_You/en Pcoombe (WMF)\n\nThe article on laminate credits some dentist with the invention/discovery. However Discover Magazine, several years ago, had a sidebar that credited Leonardo da Vinci with such a discovery, and demonstrated it with an image of tableware that had handles that were laminates of cabbage leaves. I had come to wikipedia to see what adhesive Leonardo had used for that incredible set of handles on the tableware. I believe the image was of a fork in particular. Quite a beautiful piece as well as being so utilitarianly functional as an engineering feat. Disappointed that such an engineering wonder is not explored in wikipedia, a first-line resource.\n\nThanks for the feedback, but this page is for discussing the site wikimediafoundation.org only. You can change Wikipedia's laminate article yourself by clicking \"Edit\" at the top of the page, or alternatively leave a note on the article's talk page. Pcoombe (WMF)\n\nI understand the importance of what those at Wikipedia are trying to do, and I understand that donations are necessary. I chose not to donate for a simple reason - Wikipedia is run by individuals and groups of individuals who prove the age old saying \"Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts, absolutely.\"\n\nI understand the principles of those that call themselves \"deletionists.\" Keep Wikipedia \"clean\" by not allowing an entry unless it is about a \"notable\" subject. This is a noble goal, one deletionist said \"if we don't, (delete non notable articles) we may as well call this \"myspace 2\" (yes, it was an old writing) and be done with it.\n\nThe problem is in establishing unbiased, objective criteria for notability. Even if such criteria could be developed, human nature almost guarantees that these criteria won't be applied fairly and equally. At best, there will always be the appearance of impropriety - it is difficult if not impossible to prove that objective criteria were applied fairly.\n\nIn other words, if an article is deleted, it is often not because the criteria for notability were not met, but because the deletionist has some personal problem with a person or persons involved with the subject of the article. Even if this is not the case, proving that it is not is often impossible.\n\nThe only way to avoid the problem is to abandon the idea of the deletionists and realize that if an article is notable to one person (author) it should remain. I'm not saying that poor articles or articles that violate rules or guides should be deleted, but this \"notability\" screen needs to be eliminated.\n\nUntil this happens, I will not even consider a donation.\n\nThe funny part of this statement is that Wikimedia has less of a concentration of power than basically any other encyclop"
