        "text": "Under this thematic area, we address health concerns, including adolescent Health, maternal health, sexual reproductive health and the public health promotion on epidemics and pandemics. We educate and inform on reproductive health, menstrual hygiene, contraception, family planning, and reproductive rights and the prevention of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as HIV/AIDS and promoting safe sexual practices. We also advocate for access to maternal and reproductive healthcare, prenatal and postnatal care, and educating communities on women’s health issues such as cervical cancer and maternal mortality. We promote access to clean water and sanitation facilities, and hygiene promotion campaigns.\n\nAt Meta Foundation Ghana, we are dedicated to enhancing the health and well-being of children in Ghana through our new Children’s Reproductive Health Services. We provide age-appropriate education on puberty, reproductive anatomy, menstrual health, and personal hygiene, empowering children with the knowledge to make informed health decisions. Our confidential counseling supports children through physical and emotional changes, while guiding parents on discussing these topics. We offer reproductive health check-ups, vaccinations, and treatments in a safe environment. Partnering with local schools and community organizations, our outreach programs ensure access to resources in underserved areas. Additionally, we advocate for policies that protect and promote children’s reproductive health rights. Our commitment is to foster a healthier future for Ghanaian children, equipping them with essential knowledge and resources.\n\nThis thematic area focuses on the livelihoods of women and youth by prioritizing local economic development. These include:\n\nEducation, skills development and entrepreneurship\n\nPromote access to quality vocational trainings\n\nPromote the development of life skills, soft skills, and hard skills\n\nEntrepreneurial trainings, coaching and support\n\nAccess to financial services and promotion of Village Savings and Loans Associations (VSLAs)\n\nFinancial literacy and management trainings\n\nPromote personal development and social inclusion through building social connections and relationships.\n\nCommunity Engagement: Promoting volunteerism and community service\n\nMETA Foundation is committed to promoting financial inclusion through various initiatives aimed at enhancing access to financial services for underserved communities. Under this thematic area, META Foundation facilitates the establishment of Village Savings and Loans Associations (VSLAs), which are community-based groups that allow members to save together and access small loans from those savings.\n\nMETA Foundation, we see Research, Good Governance, Peacebuilding, and Security with a lens that focuses on sustainable development and community resilience. All our interventions involve participatory research involving local communities to gather data and insights on social, economic, and environmental issues. By this approach, we aim to understand community needs, identify challenges, and develop evidence-based solutions. We also provide training sessions and workshops for local leaders, civil society organizations, and government officials to promote transparency, accountability, and effective governance practices. Facilitating dialogues at the community level to discuss and resolve conflicts, build trust among different groups, and promote mutual understanding has been our core mandate over the past years. We have done this through dialogues often involving traditional leaders, youth groups, settlers (where necessary) and women’s organizations."
