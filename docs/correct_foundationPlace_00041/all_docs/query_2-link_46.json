They defined FMs as models trained on broad data (generally using self-supervision at scale) that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks.\n\nThe Stanford team made a point to note that FMs are NOT foundational models in the sense that they are not the foundation for AI — that is, such models are not implied to be AGI.\n\nThere are 5 key characteristics of Foundation Models:"
