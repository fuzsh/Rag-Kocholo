        "text": "The META Foundation will be represented by Markus Schreyer, PhD at The AI Summit #Singapore, presenting Hospitality 3.0, and how AI’s human interface fosters engagement and emotions. From May 29-31, we will share insights at Asia Tech x Singapore on topics such as: 💡 A Hospitable Future: The META Foundation’s Hospitality 3.0 Framework, outlining a transformative approach that integrates hospitality with digital transformation to address pressing global challenges. 💡A Personal Journey: Our vision of Hospitality 3.0, providing a human interface to foster consumer engagement extending from physical to virtual spaces. 💡Beyond Tourism: How AI-driven business models can extend the reach of hospitality to cultivate meaningful connections and encourage personal growth across various sectors including #travel, #entertainment, #education, #wellness, #workplace dynamics, and #retail experiences. 🔗 Join Markus here: https://lnkd.in/exQjGd_D #METAFoundation #HospitalityInnovation #AI #Technology #Sustainability\n\n💡 How will hospitality 3.0 bring us new tools to address the global challenges we are facing? 💡 In our quest to redefine hospitality for the modern era, we are proud to present the Hospitality 3.0 Framework, developed following a series of working group sessions, hosted by NYU School of Professional Studies over the last year. It outlines a #transformative approach that integrates hospitality with digital transformation to address pressing global challenges such as: 🌱 The ecological crisis brought on by mass production, mass consumption, mass travel; 💬 The mental health crisis exacerbated by pervasive media and inhospitable social environments; 🎋 The cultural crisis brought on by corporate colonialism and centralized digital platforms. Hospitality 3.0 emerges in a transformational moment, where technology is decoupling our activities and social life from physical space. By merging ancestral knowledge with modern technologies and embracing a fluid and adaptive mindset, Hospitality 3.0 aims to cultivate meaningful connections and encourage personal growth across various sectors including #travel, #entertainment, #education, #wellness, #workplace dynamics, and #retail experiences. This transformation marks a new era of hospitality-driven interactions and engagement in both physical and virtual environments. As we tackle the challenges that face us — as individuals, businesses, industries, or governments — we anchor this exploration in four foundational pillars: 🌐 Universal: Embracing every life form within a guest-host continuum. 🌐 Integrated: Integrating hospitality into natural, social, and cultural systems. 🌐 Fluid: Adapting hospitality practices to evolving technologies and societal dynamics. 🌐 Kinetic: Embracing friction and discovery in hospitality experiences. The Hospitality 3.0 Framework closes by outlining five paths to starting this transformation, applicable to any industry. 🔗 Download the framework here: https://lnkd.in/eep3uBKR #TowardsaHospitableWorld #METAFoundation #H3Q\n\nAs a token of appreciation, META Foundation hosted a private dinner at Index Space, a co-working and community hub, featuring a curated menu by Tastings NYC | SoFlo, renowned for its bespoke culinary experiences. Special thank you goes out to NON for sponsoring non-alcoholic wine and to New York Cocktail Co for complementing the Crepes Suzette with exquisite Chocolate Negronis. From enticing Smoked Trout to succulent Dried Aged Rib Eye, every moment was savored amidst delightful company and engaging conversation. The evening culminated with sincere gratitude extended to all attendees for your participation, fostering an atmosphere of camaraderie and collaboration that embodies the spirit of Hospitality 3.0 Symposium. 🥂 Thank you everyone for joining us, as there’s truly no better way to conclude such an exceptional event! ✨ #Hospitality3Symposium #TowardsaHospitableWorld #METAFoundation\n\nOn April 29th, META Foundation, together with NYU School of Professional Studies, hosted the Hospitality 3.0 Symposium. The symposium provided a unique platform for thought leaders, innovators, and changemakers to converge, share perspectives, and co-create solutions. From discussions on reimagining hospitality as a planetary system to exploring the intersection of design, technology, and wellness, each session focused on hospitality at different scales: 🌱 Hospitality and Ecology: As climate change and environmental degradation dominate global discourse, a new hospitality movement seeks to redefine the relationship between travel, technology, education and environmental stewardship. 🌐 Hospitality and Society: In a world where technological advancement often outpaces our understanding of its impact on human health and society, hospitality is redefining what it means to build mindful, healthy and resilient societies. 🌻 Hospitality and Culture: As digital interactions increasingly shape our everyday lives, the question of how brands can authentically engage with diverse communities remains more relevant than ever. As we reflect on the insights gleaned and connections made during the symposium, we look forward to continuing this journey together and translating our shared vision into meaningful action. Together, we will continue to chart new pathways towards a brighter, more inclusive future. Symposium report is now available online!

It was a pleasure to see our speakers, New York University faculty, investors, industry professionals, and friends come together at Amelie, Maison d'art for an inspiring gathering. ✨ We are grateful to our sponsors for their generous support.
