Msomi explains that in this changing world it is often difficult to stand for one’s on values. Msomi shares that ‘Untamed’, “represents the few that refuse to flock with the masses”. \n\nHis position as a young, Black African creative plays a major role in his process and is honoured at various points of his practice, from the subjects he chooses, to the settings and aesthetics of the photographs. Photography is a medium of expression that makes the unseen elements of his lived experience seen, giving him the opportunity to craft and capture complex narratives in one image. \n\nArtwork Details:\n\nSinenkosi Msomi\nUntamed\n2020\nPhotograph printed on Luster paper\nImage size: 30 x 40 cm\nR 3 450.00 (Incl.
