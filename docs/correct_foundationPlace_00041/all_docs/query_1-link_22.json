Users engage with each other in different ways, exchanging messages and sharing news events, photos, and videos. The firm’s ecosystem consists mainly of the Facebook app, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and many features surrounding these products. Users can access Facebook on mobile devices and desktops. Advertising revenue represents more than 90% of the firm’s total revenue, with more than 45% coming from the US and Canada and over 20% from Europe.\n\nRating\n\nPrice Target\n\nArgus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 05/06/2024: Innovative Companies\n\nInnovation may be hard to define but, to borrow from former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart, you know it when you see it. The United States economy is full of innovation. It has to be. Manufacturing industries that dominated the economy decades ago - textiles, televisions, even automobiles, to a large degree - have moved overseas, where costs are lower. Yet the U.S. economy is at its largest point in history and still growing. If U.S. corporations weren't innovating, creating new products and services, and moving into new markets and applications, the domestic economy would be contracting, not expanding, and capital would not be flooding into the country. Particularly at this juncture of the market and economic cycles, when uncertainty is high due to high inflation and rising interest rates, we look to innovative companies to navigate the challenges. At Argus, a 90-year-old independent research firm that has innovated a time or two in its long history, we have focused on four types of innovative companies: Industry Disruptors; First to Market; New Product Specialists; and Product & Process Perfectors. Here are some examples of companies, featured in our Innovation Theme Model Portfolio.\n\nPeople Also Watch\n\nAMZN Amazon.com, Inc.\n\n183.13\n\n-0.34%\n\nNFLX Netflix, Inc.\n\n633.34\n\n-1.51%\n\nGOOG Alphabet Inc.\n\n179.39\n\n+0.09%\n\nAAPL Apple Inc.\n\n224.31\n\n+0.06%\n\nTSLA Tesla, Inc.\n\n239.20\n\n-4.02%\n\nNVDA NVIDIA Corporation\n\n117.93\n\n-2.61%\n\nAMD Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\n151.58\n\n-2.69%\n\nDIS The Walt Disney Company\n\n95.74\n\n-1.08%\n\nMSFT Microsoft Corporation\n\n437.11\n\n-0.74%\n\nBABA Alibaba Group Holding Limited\n\n75.27\n\n-1.66%\n\nBA The Boeing Company\n\n179.67\n\n-0.31%\n\nJPM JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\n209.78\n\n-0.10%\n\nGOOGL Alphabet Inc.\n\n177.66\n\n-0.02%\n\nINTC Intel Corporation\n\n32.98\n\n-5.42%\n\nBAC Bank of America Corporation\n\n42.90\n\n-0.26%\n\nF Ford Motor Company\n\n13.98\n\n-3.92%"
