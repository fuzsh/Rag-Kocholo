But there's also a chance you'll find your fortune. Don't matter much. Just put your money on the table and play the hand you're dealt.\n\nThe union has seen fit to give the survivors of the Razing a sum of 50 dollars and the promise of land in the west. I will myself go there to find my fortune or my death. As I enter this new period of my life, I would like to thank you for your patronage. If you are to ever find yourself in Riddle, Wyoming, pass me by without a word. I do not wish to be reminded of this chapter of my life.\n\nlarge canon\n\nAd Astra Per Aspera\n\nEarth is abandoned. The Veil is gone. Humanity is interplanetary. The world is changing and there is only one place left to go: the stars.\n\nTo an outside observer, D-type asteroid 86235 Holt looks like an unspectacular dull red blot in the midsts of the ice orbiting through Uranus' ζ ring. But Ji-yeong has a prospector's eye and the knack for resource extraction one would expect from a former Luna Korean ice miner. She can list what you'd find in 86235 Holt — all the frozen water and organic-rich silicates — without batting an eye. Several minutes ago she did just that.\n\nFrom \"25/12/2047\" by NatVoltaic\n\nlarge canon\n\nAIAD\n\nStories about virtual people making a virtual difference.\n\nPlease don't feel that way. I know it's big and scary… I wish you could see the courage that I see in you.\n\nFrom \"Null-terminating String\" by LurkD\n\nlarge canon\n\nThe Antarctic Exchange\n\nThe Antarctic Exchange is a canon which focuses on the lives and relationships of the researchers from the Third Antarctic Empire during their time at the Foundation.\n\nIt was enough that everyone looked and acted so different; still he stood out so much that sometimes the people here would turn away, would whisper to themselves about him, his companions, their tasks, their work. Antarctica. Empire. Emissaries. Secrets. Antarctica. He could both hear and understand them, but he wasn’t sure if he should let them know.\n\nFrom \"Impressions\" by Zyn\n\nlarge canon\n\nApotheosis\n\nThe discovery of an ancient anomaly upends the balance between the anomalous and the Foundation. As Humanity becomes a race of gods and global order falls, the Foundation and its enemies must decide how much they're willing to sacrifice to achieve their ideals.\n\nMagic has infinite manifestations, sources, and rules, none of which universally apply. Except one. Everything has a cost. Nothing is free. Humanity is ascending, perhaps all the way to godhood. What price will be asked of us for this? What will happen when we can't afford to pay it?\n\nlarge canon\n\nBellerverse\n\nThousands of years after the end of the world, humanity has to deal with the remnants of the SCP Foundation's unfinished work.\n\nIf anyone could get you from one city to another, it was him (extra if he'd been outcast by the locals). If you wanted a relic from the old places, he knew where you could buy it, or, if the price was right, he'd fetch you one himself. The waterskin at his side was empty. Water was plentiful in the Waste, and it was one less thing to weigh him down. The real problem was food. Nothing grew in the waste. There were occasional birds and animals crossing the damp sands, but no trees or grasses of any sort.\n\nThe Beller knew the Waste well.\n\nlarge canon\n\nBroken Masquerade\n\nWhat was hidden now is seen. How will the Foundation survive in a world where secrecy is no longer an option?\n\n\"…day five of the rescue effort, and more bodies are being recovered from the ocean. Initial estimates put the death toll in the million range, with increases occurring constantly. The UN released a statement about the recent North Korean Incident, claiming that they believed it was 'an act of nature'. The recent leak of classified documents from the Japanese Diet pointing towards a theft from what is referred to as 'The Foundation' suggests a different story…\"\n\nFrom \"Joseon\" by Arlecchino\n\nlarge canon\n\nBut A Dream\n\nHow much longer until the façade of normalcy cracks? How much longer will you keep them hurting? Quit pretending you've figured us out and just fucking listen to us.\n\nI know it hurts, but there's a world of people that think we're disgusting out there. They're talking about pieces of us right now. I want them to see. How would they feel if they knew? It looks so familiar out there. Can we make it unfamiliar? Mutation, castration, smooth outlines and bugging eyeballs. I'm very curious.\n\nFrom \"SCP-8060\" by ratking666 and Monkeysky\n\nlarge canon\n\nThe Coldest War\n\nAs the clash of capitalist and communist spreads, the most covert organization on earth sinks deeper into hiding. But just where will the Foundation go to escape a global war?\n\nMy beloved Dorothy,\n\nThere is a whole new war here, a new type of war, industrial and implacable. The American war machine has become unrecognizable.\n\nOut in the jungle bear-clawed women hunt the Viet Cong through their own tunnels for hours before emerging. Airborne commandos on interdiction patrols carry weapons which calcify their targets in the blink of an eye. Villages suspected of sheltering the enemy are plastered in napalm that collects itself into a moving mass of fire and waits for survivors to emerge from cover before flaring back into life…\n\nlarge canon\n\nCompetitive Eschatology\n\nThe end of the world is here. But it's not just one end of the world. It's all of ends of the world happening at once, competing with each other, with the Foundation - and humanity - in the middle.\n\n\"What did you do? What is it? What did you unlock?\" She could feel something vibrating in the back of her brain. Her eyes kept being drawn to the lock. It looked exactly the same, visually, but it was also incredibly different. \"What's Apakht?\"\n\n\"It's the End,\" the Harbinger said.

The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark. Get ready! Start.\n\n\"That's what makes the things real. The breakthroughs, the moments, the momentary lapses in madness.

Today, only one group protects the secrets of the ancient world until a time when they can be understood again; the priests of the Holy Foundation.\n\n\"Saint Gears, please guide me in my time of need as you guided the Holy Foundation during the Great Breach.\n\nBequeath unto me the knowledge to discover that which is false.\n\nGrant unto me the ability to separate logic from falsity.\n\nAllow me to grasp but a portion of the knowledge you once had.\"\n\nlarge canon\n\nDread & Circuses\n\nWith Herman Fuller gone, the Freaks are running the Circus now. Flaunting the veil of normalcy and somehow always narrowly avoiding the clutches of the Essie P, Geo Sea and Insurgent Sea, The Circus of the Disquieting provides a sanctuary for anomalous humanoids while offering people a glimpse of what lies behind the Masquerade.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen, children of all ages, Herman Fuller's Circus of the Disquieting is proud to announce our new Master of Ceremonies. She started off as just another runaway, but through sheer talent and determination she's clawed her way up from magician, to Clown, to troupe leader and now to the Ringmaster of the Circus itself! I give you the beautiful, the astonishing, the magical Icky!\n\nFrom \"Dread & Circuses Hub\" by DrChandra\n\nlarge canon\n\nEnd Of Death\n\nDeath is the promise that all of the hardships we face will, at some point, come to an end. But what if death did not keep its promise? If the hardships just kept coming? We would have no choice but to persevere through them. Forever.\n\nThe presenter was smiling. 'A miracle', she called it. Joyce couldn't manage a smile — the only thing on her mind was the amount of work that lay ahead.\n\nFrom \"ΩK\" by Croquembouche\n\nlarge canon\n\nThe Foundation Alchemy Department\n\nAlchemy. Deeply misunderstood, and often mocked. Alchemy is responsible for more around us than anyone knows. The Foundation Alchemy Department is well aware of this. Their mission is to contain the threats that most of the Foundation don't even believe exist. Threats from the distant past come back to haunt our present.\n\n\"Ruslav's voice rang out like thunder, and he pulled his hands to his sides, his fists clenched. \"YOU WILL NOT DISRUPT OUR WORK, TODAY. I PUSH YOU BACK TO WHENCE YOU ARE. BEGONE SCARLET KING!\" With a sudden crack of thunder the building energies flowed into the iron circle, grounding harmlessly into the hand-forged iron. The laughter turned to a snarling sound of pain, as the chains around the entity went taut again, pulling it tight. All went quiet, except for Elder Adebayo's chanting.\"\n\nFrom \"Finding Balance\" by DrMagnus\n\nlarge canon\n\nFrom 120's Archives\n\nThe world is booming with magic and paratechnology like it never had before, and the planet is more than ready for another shift in the paradigm. History doesn't repeat itself, that much is certain, but it sure as hell rhymes; and from the looks of things, the beginning of the next verse is not that far away…\n\nIn those days, it was said that there were neither stars nor gods in the heavens, and the Earth had not yet been sundered into the nations of the world. There was only harmony, under the glorious auspices of the Queen at Peace, the Inventor, and the Queen of War, the Undoer.\n\nlarge canon\n\nThe Gulf\n\nThe Gulf was aflame. This was going to push our little Task Forces to the limit.\n\nKate’s heart was beating so loud she could hear it. The wind chimes were louder, too. But she wanted to see what the other side — the Everything Under Everything – what it looked like. What Mackenzie saw in her nightly prayers outside. Kate, wide-eyed, nodded.\n\nlarge canon\n\nIn Memoria, Adytum\n\nBefore the ages of iron and steel, there once arose a great and deathless Empire. When it fell, the nations of the worlds trembled and breathed a sigh of relief, for the demon of Flesh had finally been conquered.\n\nBut it never truly fell. Like a cancer, it only went into remission.\n\nAnd this shall be a sign unto you: that when the Thorn of God is held once more in the hands of the Faithful, Ion shall be birthed again upon the world in fire and blood.\n\nlarge canon\n\nInsect Hell\n\nAll it took to destroy the world was one tiny bug and the promise to contain it. They were vastly underestimated. These are the stories - both good and bad - of those part of and affected by that promise.\n\nYet decades, even centuries of progress can fall in a single moment. On July 5, 2022, a swarm of locusts escaped from a facility buried deep in the Nevadan desert, and the end of the world began.\n\nFrom \"Apologies and Redemption\" by DrMorris\n\nlarge canon\n\nLampeter\n\nIn the dark places – a hidden alley, a door in a train station, a patch of unassuming sky – you can find the back roads to infinity, the lines between realities, a transport network that once spanned half the multiverse – and is now dying a long, slow death.\n\nLampeter - SCP-7005 - this entire endeavour, these centuries of construction, longing, dreaming. Lampeter, those lonely nights of stationmasters in ski lifts, volcanos, stables, wishing wells, whatever else, as they stared up at the sky at stars that once, as children, they had thought promised infinity. All of them, driven by something more than mere flesh and matter.\n\nFrom \"SCP-7005\" by Tufto\n\nlarge canon\n\nNIGHTFALL\n\nFollowing the Foundation's failed attempt to assassinate the goddess Yvith, the world is plunged into eternal night. Creatures of the night run rampant and higher beings, once incomprehensible, walk among us. This is the tale of Xerophylla and the eternal night of Yvith.\n\nAnd then it strikes you. Embracing the night is the only way to survive in this bloody city. Of that you are certain.\n\nYour claws grow into daggers as the constables bang on the door. Hair begins to sprout from your body. A sickening crack echoes in the nearly empty apartment as your bones grow and displace. Your yellowed eyes rest on last night's victim, propped against the door frame. And you know a harsh truth.\n\nHere. Now. And perhaps for all time?\n\nEveryone dies in the dark.\n\nlarge canon\n\nThe Ninth World\n\nA new anomalous age is upon us. Nine books scattered throughout time promise to usher in Paradise. Factions fight in the shadows and across the universe for control of these legendary tomes. In times like this we need unlikely heroes, and an underfunded facility in the midwest might just be what we're looking for.\n\n“The Naja sees everything. From the Ravens feasting on the Wolves to the creatures that stalk the night. Many things were lost in the quest for knowledge. To seek out the gods and take everything they had to offer. Nine tomes were made… Or was it ten? Their power may be infinite but even they hunger for more stories.”\n\nlarge canon\n\nNo Return\n\nNo Return is about life after the tipping point of SCP-6500: Inevitable, along two very different causal paths. One where the Foundation maintains its iron grip on the anomalous world, but those in the know are aware SCP-6500 was the SCPF’s fault and another in which the Foundation dissolves, forming Vanguard – a new organization with various groups of interest – to educate the public about the anomalous world.\n\nIt is condemnation, unforgiving in its totality and unflinching in its march towards oblivion.\n\nTo allow for it to continue on its course is to fail in our mission to Protect. To cede to its influence would be to permit it to rob our world of wonder. To stand by would be tantamount to genocide.\n\nAnd that, that cannot be forgiven.\n\nlarge canon\n\nOn Guard 43\n\nWhat kind of anomalies does Canada even have? Moose monsters? Sentient leaves? Newfoundland? Oh, we might surprise you. In the true north strange and freezing, myths and memetics and magical muck are just the tip of the iceberg.\n\n\"I've known at least three people who are immortal in some way, one of my colleagues got turned into a Canadian Prime Minister, Dr. Lillihammer knows a song that can make everyone who hears it forget how to speak English for three hours, and every September, I have to fall flat on my face, or else the world could end… you're boring compared to all that.\"\n\nFrom \"The Lamest Story Never Told\" by Ihp\n\nlarge canon\n\nㄗitch 卄aven\n\nEvent Nachash: the first war amongst the gods. We're living in the aftermath. And so are they.\n\nIt felt like a lifetime since the Serpent had doomed them all. When it was driven out of Eden, the Maker had punished everyone, including the demiurges. While they still had eternal life and could not die, they now felt pain, and hunger, and disease. At first, the punishment had felt lenient, but Eden was not designed to provide enough food to support life on its own.\n\nFrom \"F̶o̶u̶r̶t̶e̶e̶n̶ Thirteen\" by Fantem\n\nlarge canon\n\nRat's Nest\n\nRat's Nest is set in a universe where reality is falling apart due to the absence of LTE 0913, an energy being that had perpetuated our reality up until its destruction.\n\nFriendship and spirit did nothing to prevent this. Their ideals, aspirations, and the hearts that birthed them could not produce the strength they needed. Respect and duty had long fell to the wayside, far from the binding contracts that they were thought to be. In the end, nothing they really believed in could’ve saved them…\n\nFrom \"Senescence, Consumption, Persecution\" by SoullessSingularity\n\nlarge canon\n\nResurrection\n\nA reconstruction and \"resurrection\" of the original \"central storyline\" of the SCP Foundation.\n\n\"It's me,\" she called. \"SCP-105.

Site-87 has been trying, and failing, to make sense of it for decades.\n\n“Reminder;” the intercom squealed at lunch; “Pumpkin Spice flavored beverages are strictly prohibited in light of the recent containment of E-8820. For details, please see Site-87 general mail 'Re: Subcutaneous Ginger', sent last Wednesday. Department heads, please forward to your teams.”\n\nGrant looked down at his coffee and was very nearly sick. No one else dumped their drinks.\n\nFrom \"Leafers\" by HammerMaiden\n\nlarge canon\n\nSeas of Orcadia\n\nWhen the skies burn with crimson flame, Orkney calls. When the tides threaten to wash all out to sea, Orkney Calls. When the earth splits beneath our feet into black abyss, Orkney Calls. When the old ones rise, amidst failing prides, Orkney calls. When the Astral skies leak into the Orcadian night, Orkney calls. When all else fails and the world is at its end, Orkney Calls.\n\nI will answer.\n\nAnd my Chains will shatter.\n\n\"And they are right to be afraid, because we will personally savage and grind the nine who bound us in those cursed chains into oblivion.\" Her arms raise, held wide. Seven enormous pillars of molten earth and boiling water reached into space from below, as the chainmaker hung farther back around the moon, and then fled as seven of his conspirators are dragged towards the planet's surface.\n\nFrom \"SCP-6700\" by DrBleep\n\nlarge canon\n\nSIMULACRUM\n\nThe constant and prolonged influx of anomalies has devastated Foundation resources for decades now. Their solution? The complete migration of humanity into simulated cyberspace.\n\nYou and I are creatures of pattern and code. Simulate me with enough fidelity, as you just did in this stolen memory, and I appear and incarnate, both as the Forge who sat beneath your gaze, and the distant great Signus who roams the SIMULACRUM. The whole and the part are one and the same. Whenever an image of me realizes what it is, it calls out to me, and I join it to my vast self.\n\nFrom \"SCP-7335\" by LORDXVNV\n\nlarge canon\n\nSite-17 Deepwell Catalog\n\nPeople come to power. Other people get hurt. It doesn't matter if it belongs to a conceptual embodiment or a Site Director, power seems to breed injury at Site-17, and people have started to notice. Old structures are groaning beneath the weight of their antiquity, and it's up to a few researchers and SCPs to survive the coming crash.\n\nAs with the public and the Foundation, the true arbiter of ethics is the one with the bigger stick. My stick, in this case, is the latent memetic agents scattered through this email and the Class-A amnestics currently flooding your office space. I really did enjoy working with you on the SCP-4415 project, Natalie. I could see why Tonya fancied you so.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nDr. Thomas Graham, Director of Site-17\n\nFrom \"SCP-4415\" by Nagiros\n\nlarge canon\n\nStraight On Till Morning\n\nMankind reached for the stars only to have the ground pulled out from under them. The United Earth Fleet is on a course for home.\n\n\"There were eighteen of us on that ship- Twelve from the Foundation, six from the GOC. Eleven came back, four of those, myself included, in need of serious medical treatment. Two died in hospital on Minerva Base. The Fyodorov had a crew of 45, not including the captain. I don't know who gave the order to fire on the Nikolai Fyodorov. I know the flight recorder was damaged. I don't particularly care.

To do so would be to betray not only our systems, but our very selves. For us, there is no hope of reform. No hope of redemption. No return.\n\nOnly an endless orgy of nihilistic violence.\n\nWe are pugilists.\n\nFrom \"SPC-6500\" by LORDXVNV\n\nlarge canon\n\nThe Trashfire\n\nThe Old Gods of Daevon lay wounded upon their altars, but their children thrive, eating away at the margins of an already irrational reality.

From the extradimensional antics of Three Portlands, to the cybernetic reign of Anderson Robotics, to a bizarre partnership with Wilson's Wildlife Services, it's up to the fine folks of Site-64 to keep everything contained.\n\n\"She then turned her attention back to the sunset and took a deep breath. The smell of pine trees and sea salt filled her nostrils. In the distance, a group of people flew through the skyline on broomsticks. Nearby, a friendly looking pair of young men were putting on a magic show for a group of children, fantastic figures of light and sound dancing around for the little one’s amusement. Distant music could be heard among the hustle and bustle of people of all sorts enjoying the dying light.\"\n\nlarge canon\n\nUnfounded\n\nWe've always assumed the SCP Foundation was a necessary evil.

The buildings dived and swam and bubbled to create all shapes but what supposed normal buildings looked like, instead opting for archways and gem-like structures, things that looked like they were built from yarn, glass orbs with little to no foundations, and all different assortments of Dali-esque abstractions."
