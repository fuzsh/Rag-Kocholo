        "text": "2024 Call for Proposals Closed\n\nValue of the Nurse Manager\n\nThe AONL Foundation envisions a healthier tomorrow advanced through nursing leadership and strives to achieve that vision by providing resources to create opportunities to bridge science and practice to shape the future of nursing leadership.\n\nThe AONL Foundation supports the vision and mission by supporting the generation of new knowledge through actionable research to:\n\nOptimize Leadership Effectiveness\n\nAchieve Equity in Health Care\n\nImprove the Health Care Experience.\n\nPurpose\n\nThe purpose of this RFP is to better understand and support front-line nurse leaders or managers directly overseeing clinical staff nurses, as they lead in changing healthcare environments. The AONL Foundation aims to optimize outcomes and generate knowledge related to the value of nurse manager in organizations. Through this funding the AONL Foundation aims to support the generation of timely, innovative and cost-effective solutions that can be implemented in the near future to improve the work experience for nurse managers.\n\nThe front-line nurse leader/manager faces many challenges in their role. The AONL and AONL Foundation Longitudinal Nursing Leadership Insight Study has reported the challenges shared by these leaders over five studies. AONL’s Workforce Task Force has published several resources in the last two years focusing on the nurse manager/front line leader, including the Nursing Leadership Workforce Compendium, and The Role of the Nurse Manager: Evolution of the Role in High-Turnover Environments. Lastly, the Beyond Gratitude initiative reinforces the need to validate the role of the nurse manager. Building on these works, The AONL Foundation seeks to apply funds to support knowledge development answering questions in this vein. Examples include:\n\nWhat is the impact of large spans of control on nurse manager effectiveness?\n\nWhat is the impact of leading in a “Teaming” versus “Strong Core” team environment?\n\nWhat new competencies do nurse managers/front line nurse leaders need?\n\nWhich nurse manager competencies impact the work environment or patient care?\n\nWhat is the impact of competitive employment markets and high staff turnover on nurse manager satisfaction?\n\nWhat is the impact of nurse manager turnover on staff turnover, staff satisfaction and patient outcomes?\n\nWhat is the impact of new care delivery models on nurse manager workload?\n\nWhat strategies effectively help to mitigate nurse manager burnout?\n\nDescribe the relationship between nurse manager meeting attendance requirements and unit performance metrics.\n\nWhat is the proportion of nurse manager time spent in service recovery?\n\nIdentify effective nurse manager communication strategies with a diverse workforce.\n\nThe relationship between nurse manager satisfaction and CNO support sessions with managers\n\nStrategies to better recognize nurse manager contributions\n\nThis grant award can support observational or interventional research to address the requested learnings.\n\nObservational studies might be preliminary investigations to describe diversity among nurse managers and the impacts of having a diverse nurse manager team. Studies that address the value of the nurse manager and are linked to larger, ongoing projects will also be considered. Investigators may use any of the qualitative traditions (ethnography, phenomenology, grounded theory, etc.), descriptive quantitative designs, or mixed methods to explore these topics. Studies that are translatable to practice in the near future or set groundwork for continued funded outcome-focused research are encouraged.\n\nInterventional studies must directly address measuring or proving the value of nurse managers and the impacts on the manager, teams, and/or organizations. Interventions should include all appropriate organizational stakeholders (e.g. a project addressing recruitment of diverse nurse managers should include organizational leadership, human resource personnel, hiring manager, and others as needed.) It is expected that the interventions will have the potential to be sustained in the organization or setting and should be scalable for implementation in other settings.\n\nEligibility Criteria:\n\nPrincipal investigator must be a current licensed Registered Nurse.\n\nMembers of the board of directors, officers, and staff of the AONL Foundation, AONL, the American Hospital Association and its affiliates are not eligible to apply.\n\nResearchers currently funded by the AONL Foundation are not eligible for this award.\n\nPriority may be given to diverse applicants.\n\nFebruary 15, 2024 Online Submissions Open\n\nMay 1, 2024 Deadline for Submissions\n\nApplication closes at 3:00 p.m. CT.\n\nJuly 2024 Award Notification\n\nAugust 2024 Public Announcement\n\nAugust 2024 - June 2026 Funding Dates\n\nPlease note: a portion of the funds will be distributed at the beginning of the funding period. Remaining fund are dependent upon and will be distributed at completion of the study.Timeframe allows for the possibility of presentation at either the 2025 or 2026 AONL Annual Conference.&nbsp; Project can be completed at any point within the timeframe.\n\nGuidelines\n\nThis grant award applies only to research studies and does not include evidence-based projects.\n\nDocumentation of Institute Review Board (IRB) approval is required prior to initiation of funding (timetable for IRB approval or proof of IRB approval to be included in proposal).\n\nImplementation of the research project must commence immediately upon receipt of the funds.\n\nResearch project must be completed within timeframe established above, inclusive of dissemination.\n\nDissemination should include presentation at a national conference and submission of a manuscript for publication in a peer reviewed journal. A webinar and/or other format may also be considered.\n\nPlease note, if planning to submit an abstract to present at an AONL Annual Conference, that abstract should reflect completed study.\n\nA portion of the award money will be dependent upon completion of award study.\n\nThe AONL Foundation should be acknowledged in all publications and presentations that use/reference the findings.\n\nBudget proposals:\n\nAONL Foundation provides funding for direct expenses, and allows up to 10% of total grant funds to be used for indirect expenses or overhead expenses.\n\nNo investigator time will be supported. All other research-related expenditures including salary support for research assistants or statisticians, incentivizing study participants, supplies, software, printed materials, copying, communications, and expenses related to attending and presenting study findings at conferences are acceptable expenses.\n\nWhen building budget to attend and present findings at a national conference, consider all travel, poster design and printing, presentation design and production, and other associated costs.\n\nAll research proposals are expected to primarily address either the AONL Foundation priority Optimizing Leadership Effectiveness or Improving the Health Care Experience. Proposals may also address the third priority area Achieving Equity in Health Care.\n\nReview Process\n\nAll submitted proposals will undergo a blind review by members of the AONL Foundation Board of Director’s Research Review Committee.
