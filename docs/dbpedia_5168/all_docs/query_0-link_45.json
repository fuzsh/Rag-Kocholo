        "text": "In the novel The Confusions of Young Törless, things present themselves to the eyes of the leading character in dual form: on one hand, reason, that is, the causality of thought; on the other, an interior certainty. When an idea has penetrated into the brain for a long time, it can come to life only when it is flanked by something that is no longer thinking, no longer logic, but something whose truth is perceived without the need of any justification. To this end, Törless speaks of a second vision, which does not make use of the eyes of reason, and a second life, secret and unobserved, of things. The contacts that Törless makes with this “other state” are sudden epiphanies that prevent him from maintaining the network of conceptual relations that allow life to be reflected fully in reason. These sensations present themselves as menaces, obscure and distant forces that have always existed, but silently, that surround the subject on all sides. This is the case of the mystic vision of infinity that Törless experiences while stretched out on the lawn of the college. In this episode, the young man perceives in an epiphany-like vision the incredible height of the sky: he ardently desires to reach it, and at the same time is forced to come to terms with the insufficiency of his own visual strength to capture its extremity. Thus he begins to repeat aloud, “as though to test the power of a magic spell” ([9], p. 69), that there is no end to it because the sky goes ever deeper, to infinity:\n\nInfinity! Törless knew the word from maths class. He had never imagined anything particular by it. It was forever returning; someone must have invented it once and since then it had been possible to calculate with it as surely as one did with anything solid… Now there was something terribly unsettling about the word. It struck him as a concept that had formerly been tamed, one with which he had performed his daily little tricks, and which had now suddenly been released. Something beyond understanding, something wild and destructive seemed to have been put to sleep by the work of a clever inventor, and had now been woken to life and grown terrible before him. There, in that sky, it now stood vividly above him and menaced and mocked ([9], p. 69).\n\nIt is precisely thanks to these thoughts about infinity that Törless begins to follow the course of mathematics with particular attention. At the end of a lecture on imaginary numbers, he goes to his classmate Beineberg to discuss an idea that had “burned itself swiftly into his mind” ([9], p. 81), and is thus led to his second vision. The conversation goes like this:\n\nAny number, whether it’s positive or negative, gives a positive number when it is squared. So there can’t be such a thing as a real number that is the square root of something negative.\n\nRight, but can’t you try to apply the operation of square root calculation to a negative number anyway? It can’t produce a real value, of course, and that’s why the result is called imaginary…\n\nBut how can you do that, if you know for certain, mathematically for certain, that it is impossible?\n\nWell, you just go on behaving as if it weren’t so, in spite of everything. It’ll probably produce some sort of result. In what way are the so-called irrational numbers different?… And what do you think about parallel lines that meet at infinity? I reckon that if we were too conscientious there would be no mathematics at all.\n\nYou are right about that. … In that kind of calculation you have very solid figures at the beginning, which can represent metres or weights or something similarly tangible, and which are at least real numbers. And there are real numbers at the end of the calculation as well. But there are connected to one another by something that doesn’t exist. Isn’t that like a bridge consisting of only the first and last pillars, and yet you walk over it as securely as though it was all there? For me there is something dizzying about a calculation like that, as if it goes off God knows where for part of the way. But the really uncanny thing about it is the strength that exists in such a calculation, holding you so firmly that you land safely in the end ([9], pp. 81–82).\n\nThe passages quoted can be examined in light of two sources of Musil’s reflections on language. The Confusions of Young Törless opens with a quotation from Maurice Maeterlinck’s 1900 collection of mystical essays entitled The Treasure for the Humble, noted by Musil in Notebook 4 of his Diaries, which remarks the insufficiency of the sign with respect to the totality: “In some strange way we devalue things as soon as we give utterance to them”. Thus the treasures of the cave, when brought to light, are transformed into “false stones and chips of glass”, in spite of the fact that in the abyss these jewels appeared luminous and intact. The registration corrects and complicates the impressions; it alters things, fixing and crystallising them. Reality as depicted by Musil is fluid and mobile: meanings are determined by their connections to circumstances, and the structure of the world is mutable and manifold. In Notebook 24 of the Diaries, written in 1904–1905, Musil notes some of the places in Edmund Husserl’s 1900 Logical Investigations, a work dedicated to the philosopher and psychologist Carl Stumpf, the professor under whose advisement Musil earned his degree in Berlin in 1908. In this work Husserl notes that “drawing” is not always equivalent to “signifying” that qualifies the expressions: the sign in the sense of signals (Anzeichen) does not express anything, unless, in addition to the function of indicating, it also performs a signifying function (Fig. 2).\n\nThe idea that Musil borrows from these two sources is that of the complete arbitrariness of any system of signs: at the basis of his semiotics is what Claudio Magris defines as the scuciture dei segni (unstitching of signs) [3]. What Törless in fact deduces from this epiphany about the height of the sky is that the mathematical symbol for infinity does not express but, as Maeterlinck says, rather “devalues” the monstrous significance of the concept, and that this is the reason why it had always eluded him during the lectures in class: it is only manifest thanks to his second vision. In the passage about imaginary numbers, the young man notes the lack of a real reference for the symbols of a root of minus one: i is, to use Husserlian terms, a symbol without any real meaning.\n\nThe mathematical symbol thus exasperates the character of each sign: it accentuates its capability to signify more than what is indicated, but at the same time, it permits the “domestication” of the concept that belongs to the super-rational sphere. For this reason, mathematics appears to Törless in its duplicity: by nature it consists of both the real and the imaginary. Mathematics, viewed with the eyes of reason, appears to be solid and sure: it represents reasonableness and normality of the lectures in the classroom, so that the values calculated indicate something solid. It is however capable of going beyond reason, revealing its wild and unsettling nature.\n\nPart of what emerges from the discussion with Beineberg is the theoretical fiction of mathematics: even though it is known with certainty that the square root of a negative number has no realty, we act as though this isn’t so. In that sense mathematics is configured as a Philosophie des Als Ob (the philosophy of “as if”), that is, a philosophy that treats error and fiction as though they were true.Footnote 3\n\nIts dual nature and its theoretical fictions justify the classification of mathematics as the nexus of imagination and reality.Footnote 4 This role of mathematics is exemplified by the image that Törless gives of a bridge without arches in which there exist only the two piers on the ends, where imaginary numbers make it possible to cross the realm of the irrational unscathed. This is where the audacity, and the recklessness of mathematics reside. Beineberg states, agreeing with Törless, that “if we were too conscientious there would be no mathematics at all” ([9], p. 82): this science by its very nature goes beyond the scrupulous analysis of everyday reason and is gifted with a force so solid—as the title character underlines—that it is possible to cross into imagination, because we can count on a safe return to reality.\n\nThe presupposition from which Musil’s analysis concerning the moral disintegration and spiritual crisis of his day begins is an acknowledgement of the backwardness of the moral, metaphysical and political concepts with respect to the results achieved by the enormous progress in science and technology: between emotion and reason, “the difference in development between these two faculties is almost as great as that between the vermiform appendix and the cerebral cortex” ([7], p. 43). As a matter of fact, morals adapted themselves to the changeability of the world only in small things, while remaining anchored with regard to the higher values, to tired ideologemes and worn-out and ridiculous expressions learned in “catechisms and elementary schools”.Footnote 5 On the other hand, science had been able to actuate a large number of humanity’s ancestral dreams, in a process during which God is forced “to open one fold after another of his cloak” ([7], p. 45–46), and which entered into every application to life.\n\nIn Musil’s opinion, the difference between morals and science is not so much due to an excess of intellect as it is instead to the incapacity to apply reason to questions of the soul: the rational spirit, which lies at the basis of scientific and economic development, had extended itself more in breadth than in depth, and did not penetrate into the sphere of spiritual values. As Aldo Venturelli [13] noted, Musil turns around the accusations of repetitiveness and sterility that the irrationalists expressed towards the scientific attitude: feelings, from which ideologies and arts are born, repeat themselves through the centuries without any substantial innovation.\n\nThe idea of transforming exactitude from a simple method of scientific analysis into an attitude and behaviour towards all manifestations of the soul lies at the basis of the “utopia of exactness” described by Musil in the second part of The Man Without Qualities.Footnote 6 The project of scientific redetermination of values cannot be reduced to an application in the field of morals of the productive organization that followed technological and scientific development. The plane of rationalisation inherent in the utopia of exact living also includes the dimension of uncertainty and indeterminacy, since its essence is constituted by the freedom to experiment, unlinked from factual conditioning and guided by a “sense of possibility”. The sense of possibility, introduced by Musil at the beginning of the novel,Footnote 7 is the capacity of thinking simultaneously of all possibilities knowing that what happens in reality is without importance in comparison to what might happen: it is in fact in the faculty of reasoning “differently”, of imagining that which did not occur, that human progress resides. The utopia of exact living is thus meant to formulate a new morality, one which instead of establishing values that are crystallized, unmovable and the fruit of a simplification of everyday life, is capable of responding to the flux of facts, and of constructing a dense network of connections and circumstances that determine the meaning of human actions, since, as Ulrich-Musil acknowledges, “all moral events take place in a field of energy whose constellation charges them with meaning, They contain good and evil the way an atom contains the possibilities of certain chemical combinations” ([7], p. 279).\n\nThe problem of the effective realisation of the marriage between soul and precision prefigured by the utopia of exactness is an urgent question that Musil attempted to answer throughout the entire arc of his intellectual evolution. Early in 1940, he admitted that in the face of the question “How do you envision that in real terms?”Footnote 8 he had been evasive, and that by that time his answer had become completely insufficient. One of the attempts to answer this question consists in the idea of applying the instruments of mathematics to spiritual questions, exploiting, as he had done in the Törless, the dual nature of this science. Musil’s experiment can be traced all throughout the first volume of the Lebenswerk but its original nucleus, which will be examined in what follows, can be discerned in his youthful notes in the Diaries and in the essay “The Mathematical Man” (Fig. 3).\n\nThe notion of “mathematical morals” is formulated by Musil as early as Notebook 4 of the Diaries, beginning with his youthful reading of Nietzsche, experimental, perspective and illuminist, still far from the devaluation of science as a sign of decadence.Footnote 9 Musil quotes word for word an aphorism taken from The Twilight of the Idols, in which Nietzsche exalts mathematics for its experimental value, disconnected from its character of practical utility.Footnote 10 The very idea of mathematics as a non-fluctuating and chaotic relationship to reality, declined in the Spinozian key of the geometric treatment of the passions, is already present—as noted in [1]—in The Gay Science, another text by Nietzsche that nourished the young Musil:\n\nMathematics. Let us introduce the subtlety and rigour of mathematics into all sciences to the extent to which that is at all possible; not in the belief that we will come to know things in this way, but in order to ascertain our human relations to things. Mathematics is only the means to general and final knowledge of humanity ([10], p. 148, no. 246).\n\nHowever, these Nietzschean influences relative to mathematical morals find their first complete elaboration in the essay “The Mathematical Man”, which constitutes the original nucleus of the opening chapters of his most important novel.\n\nIn this brief, caustic essay, Musil develops the idea of the duplicity of mathematics. On one hand, “all the life that whirls about us, runs and stops is not only dependent on mathematics for its comprehensibility but has effectively come into being through it and depends on it for its existence” ([5], p. 41): the instruments of mathematics in fact make it possible, by means of the use of the sense of reality, to derive, from certain principles, useful ideas on which the entire progress of civilisation depends. On the other hand, however, “one may call mathematics an ideal spiritual apparatus whose task and accomplishment are to anticipate in principle every possible case” ([5], p. 40): this is the analogy better realised in the sense of possibility. The capacity to imagine and construct in a way that is precise and orderly all possibilities, independent of factual constrictions, as, for example, in the case of reductio ad absurdum proofs, and the absence of a practical objective or meta-object in the progress of this science are two fundamental elements of the way of proceeding by means of the sense of possibilities that are proper to the mathematical man, and distinct from the methods of technicians and engineers.\n\nGiven its usefulness for the aim of optimising production and improving the material conditions of life, mathematics is on one hand “an extreme economy of thought” ([5], p. 40): in this definition Musil’s study of the theories of Ernst Mach were decisive; Mach, refuting the possibility of achieving an objective knowledge by means of scientific research, admitted only the economic validity of scientific laws. Contrasting this tendency towards the conservation of intellectual energy, is the truer character of mathematics, comprised of abnegation and passion:\n\nIt is only when one looks not towards the outside, at their utility, but within mathematics itself at the relationship among the unused parts that one sees the other, real face of this science. It is not goal-oriented but uneconomical and passionate… (The mathematician) believes that what he is doing will probably eventually lead to some practical cash value, but this is not what spurs him on; he serves the truth, which is to say his destiny, not its purpose. The result may be economical a thousand times over; what is immanent is a total surrender and a passionate devotion.\n\nMathematics is the bold luxury of pure reason, one of the few that remain today ([5], p. 41).\n\nMathematics as the audacity to imagine all that is not real in a way which is without a precise aim and nevertheless exact is the highest expression of the sense of possibility.\n\nIt is precisely the marriage of the sense of possibility and the sense of reality, economy and passion, exactness and imagination, that, to Musil’s eyes, make mathematics the science can that better than all others serve to actuate the utopia of exact living; he characterises it as “a triumph of intellectual organisation” ([5], p. 40). For Musil, the mathematical man represents the individual who, in Nietzschean terms, is disdainful of the danger deriving from the non-directed sacrifice of an enormous quantity of intellectual energy, and who seeks truth at any cost. By as early as 1913, Musil had identified in the mental practices of the mathematical man the spiritual attitude capable of solving the moral crisis of the day: “Therein lies the significant lesson and model of their [the mathematicians] existence: they are an analogy for the intellectual of the future” ([5], p. 42).\n\nThe originality of Musil’s proposal consists in having demonstrated the unfoundedness of the accusations of aridity and alienation that Kulture aimed at mathematics: the discovery of numerous “non-ratioid” aspects of this science suggested to Musil a paradigm for bridging the gap, as perilous as it was unjustified, between the sphere of feeling and the sphere of the intellect, that constitutes the root of the difficulties of modernity.\n\nTranslated from the Italian by Kim Williams."
