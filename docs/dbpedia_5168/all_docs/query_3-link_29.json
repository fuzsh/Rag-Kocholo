Robert Musil as a Cultural Theorist\n\nAfter Musil’s death in 1942, it took several decades for his masterpiece Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften to receive the attention it merits, mainly due to its unfinished state and overwhelming scope and complexity. Nowadays the novel is acknowledged as a modernist classic that has its place in the canon of the greatest literature of the twentieth century, next to Joyce, Proust or Kafka. In 1999, Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften was voted as the most important German-language novel of the century by a jury of 99 German writers and scholars, before classics like Der Zauberberg or Der Prozess.\n\nMore recently, Musil’s work has also drawn increasing attention from philosophers, finding in his writings reflections of such richness and originality that they deserve to be studied on their own. French philosopher Jacques Bouveresse raises the question in one of his studies of Musil whether the time hasn’t finally come to regard Musil’s thought as a philosophy in its own right (Bouveresse, 2001). Also in France, a book has appeared with the title La philosophie autrichienne de Bolzano à Musil; Histoire et actualité, granting Musil a central place in Austrian philosophy (Mulligan and Commeti, eds., 2002). In 2014, the philosophy journal The Monist published a special issue devoted entirely to ‘the philosophy of Robert Musil’. In their classic study of Vienna at the turn of the century, Allan Janik and Stephen Toulmin wrote: “In its own way, therefore, The Man Without Qualities is pre-eminently a ‘philosopher’s novel’, and deserves special attention from students of twentieth-century philosophy…” (Janik and Toulmin, 1973, p. 119) Throughout the years, Musil’s work has been eagerly used by the most diverse thinkers, philosophers or literary critics, who all gratefully make use of the huge amount of challenging ideas and images that can be found in his writings.1\n\nIt is by no means the intention of these people to artificially separate Musil the thinker from Musil the writer. It is a fact that Musil consciously refused an academic career in order to work on his great novel. Besides ← 15 | 16 → the occasional essay, play and short story, it was the novel, though quite an unusual one in his case, that was for him the preferred form and medium to express himself. It should also not be forgotten that Musil had some very harsh things to say about philosophy as a discipline, which, he thought, was too inclined to reduce experience to grand, rigid systems and overly limited in what it deemed worthy of philosophical reflection.2 In Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften he writes: “Philosophers are despots who have no armies to command, so they subject the world to their tyranny by locking it up in a system of thought.”3 (MwQ 272) Musil consciously chose not to have a career as a philosopher but as a writer, which was a medium that allowed him to both expose the limits of certain domains, whether philosophy or science, and to combine the best of these worlds.4\n\nThe tendency to speak of ‘the philosophy of Robert Musil’ comes out of the fact that Musil’s work contains such an incredible amount of original, sharp and unique reflections which cannot be reduced to any direct influence or intellectual trend, that even scholars feel as if they are only beginning to get a grip on the complexities of his work. As Michael A. Bernstein ← 16 | 17 → writes: “…the whole nature of his achievement, the ways in which his work is both difficult and rewarding, constitutes such a singular case that even a thorough grounding – and delight – in the complexities of other great modernist authors does little to prepare oneself for an encounter with a body of writing like his.” (Bernstein, 2000, p. 36) The position I will take in this book is different from scholars who study Musil for his literary value or those who want to situate him within a philosophical tradition. From every page of Musil’s work, whether Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften, the essays or his diaries, it is evident that Musil sees it as his main goal to do an intervention in the cultural climate, which seemed to go from one crisis to the next. His body of work could be described as one long critical analysis of the shortcomings in the artistic, intellectual and political debates of his time, but analysis is not strong enough; his writings are meant to be a direct experience that problematizes the common conceptions by which people view themselves and the world and that allows for the formation of different conceptual frameworks. I will regard his work as a forceful cultural critique and Musil himself as one of the most lucid and original cultural theorists of his generation.\n\nOne only has to open up a random page of Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften to notice the relentless critical edge of his writing, which made some critics wrongly conclude that Musil seems to simply reject everything or that his negativity is total and all-encompassing. In his view, literature first and foremost had to serve a critical function. Ulrich, the protagonist of Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften, gives the novel unambiguously a critical function: “Every great book breathes the spirit of this love for the fate of individuals at odds with the forms the community tries to impose on them. … Extract the meaning out of all literature, and what you will get is a denial, however incomplete, but nonetheless an endless series of individual examples all based on experience, which refute the accepted rules, principles, and prescriptions underpinning the very society that loves these works of art!”5 (MwQ 398-399).\n\nMusil was driven by a need, not simply to describe his society and provide a detailed portrait of it, but to intervene in the intellectual, moral, artistic and political debates of his time. His incisive observations are always at the same time a problematization, a displacement of what he is describing, ← 17 | 18 → ruthlessly exposing its shortcomings and inadequacy to cope with the huge challenges of modernity. His aim was to expose the flaws and impasses of the intellectual life he was living in, along with its disastrous consequences, and to increase the capacity to explore other possibilities. His ambition was nothing less than to change the way society was ordered and how human beings define themselves, and for this he chose the novel, which had to serve as a large ‘experimental station’, as his preferred means of expression.6 Only the novel allowed him the flexibility to explore possibilities from different angles and to permanently readjust his approach, which was necessary to face the rapidly changing historical conditions, as opposed to academic philosophy which he compared to an overbred bulldog that is no longer capable of biting.7\n\nBefore presenting the stakes of this book, I will briefly describe Musil’s life, his main concerns and the complexities surrounding Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften.\n\n2. Musil’s Life and Background\n\nMusil was born in 1880 in Klagenfurt, Carinthia.8 His only sister died as a young child before his birth. His father belonged to the well-off Habsburg administration and in 1890, the entire family moved to Brno (also known by its German name Brünn) where Musil’s father was appointed as a professor in mechanical engineering. Musil grew up in a rather peculiar domestic situation: from 1882 to her death in 1924, his mother Hermine took a lover into their house, who lived there all that time with the consent of Musil’s father and who was called ‘uncle Heinrich’ by little Robert, even though it was never a secret that he was his mother’s lover. Musil was born into an environment which stood for traditional Habsburg values and customs, but which at the same time ← 18 | 19 → was very accepting of experimenting with lifestyles that challenged the common moral norms.\n\nThis paradox became more problematic when he was sent to the military boarding schools of Eisenstadt and Mährisch-Weißkirchen, an experience that became the inspiration for his first literary success: Die Verwirrungen des Zöglings Törleß, published in 1906. Rilke, who shortly went to the same school at Mährisch-Weißkirchen, had to be removed from the school by his parents after less than a year. While the institutions were supposed to install an unshakable sense of moral duty and loyalty to the Habsburg values in the students, all coming from respectable families, Musil described the fierce homo-erotic games and sadistic bullying that went on at night. It was as if the school was a miniature image of the future moral hypocrisy and cruelty of the Nazi era. Nevertheless, at the age of 26, Musil had a literary success which both evoked awe for its style and shocked reactions for its content.\n\nAfter the boarding schools, Musil spent one year at the Military Academy of Vienna, abandoning it after one year because he was tired of the boorish types the military attracted and he moved back to Brno to study engineering like his father. While devoting his day time to his studies, he frantically spent his nights reading up on literature and philosophy, which provided what was lacking in his studies. From that time on he kept a series of detailed notebooks in which he systematically recorded his ideas, his reflections on his readings and the times, along with experimental drafts for future novels. In 1902, he was appointed as assistant at the Technical Institute of Stuttgart, one of the most prestigious institutions for engineers, but already after one year he could not find anything compelling about the job anymore and he moved to Berlin to begin doctoral studies in philosophy and experimental psychology. That department, with notable professors like Carl Stumpf, was at that time a cutting-edge place for the study of epistemology, early phenomenology and experimental psychology. During his stay there, Musil invented a color wheel used in psychological experiments which is patented to his name. In 1908, Musil finished his doctoral studies with a study of the Austrian philosopher of science Ernst Mach, under the supervision of Carl Stumpf.9 Stimulated by his early literary success and disappointed by his disagreements with Stumpf, Musil finished his doctoral studies without much enthusiasm, having already decided that he would embark on a career as a writer.10\n\n← 19 | 20 →"
