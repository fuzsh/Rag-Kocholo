        "text": "The question of how literature can evoke emotions is a familiar one, as is the idea that a good work of literature arouses the right emotion in the right place through our capacity for sympathy. However, there is no consensus on how this works, partly because there is no agreement on the nature of emotions. One figure that contributes to both of these topics is Robert Musil. As a thinker and as a novelist, he had both a theory of emotions and a novelistic treatment of them. His novels are notable, however, for the way in which they do not appeal to the reader's capacity for sympathy, owing partly to the formlessness of his characters. Yet it is precisely the gap he creates between fiction and emotional reality that allows for a richer investigation of the relationship between emotions and literature.\n\nThis article explores the notion that human behaviors and desires can be attributed to someone called the “Other.” Throughout history, since Aristotle, it has been suggested that humans are imitative beings. Along with further developed versions of Aristotle`s concept of mimesis, the idea emerged that man actually imitates the desire of the “Other”. That is manifested not only in personal life, but also in all aspects of social life. In this article, the focus is specifically on love and how it can be understood through this theory. Contrary to contemporary interpretations of love, the argument is made that it is, in fact, a destructive (murderous) emotion. To support this claim, references to literature, psychoanalysis, literary criticism, and philosophy are made. It is claimed that love is not a feeling of happiness, but of crisis, hysterical fits and pain. Tolstoy`s Anna Karenina serves as an example of love`s tumultuous nature. The fact that people give different shades to this ancient feeling in the modern world parallels the change of the world and human understanding. In the modern world, people attempt to live a life free of pain, sterilized and unwounded which causes a change in the essence of love. The article emphasizes these features and describes the ancient essence of love.\n\nIn Frumoasa necunoscută. Literatura și paradoxurile teoriei, Carmen Mușat analyzes and systemizes the relational character of literature and the discourses on literature. She revisits famous notions of modernity which can be capitalized on in our current context, where we speak of the death of the author and even the end of literary theory. In all of the approaches that she takes in the book, the author is certain that the theorist and his presence in the world retain a valid purpose, as they can counterargue, wherever the case may be, and justify the beauty of literature from novel points of view. Frumoasa necunoscutăpresents to us an inventory for an ideal way to look upon the world and literature. Carmen Mușat is a researcher who is up to date with the most sophisticated conceptual systems. The result of this is a narration under the form of a complex declaration of love for literature and the paradoxes of theory.\n\nThis article examines the role played by 'feeling' (Gefühl) and 'love' within the philosophy of German Romanticism. After an introduction (I) to the actual debate on German Romanticism, paragraph II sketches an analysis of the concept of Gefühl at the end of the eighteenth century and highlights the differences with its actual meaning. The successive three sections are dedicated to three pivotal figures of German Romanticism: F. Schlegel (III), Novalis (IV), and Baader (V). Similarities and differences between these authors will be emphasized. It will be demonstrated that they deny the reason˗feeling opposition, and that 'feeling' and 'love' are at the heart of their ontology, epistemology, and conception of subjectivity, conditioning the Romantic human-nature relationship and Romantic political philosophy. In the concluding remarks (VI), this paper explains how German Romanticism can still help to better understand the role of feelings in politics.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche paid considerable attention to the significance of emotions in our lives. The aim of this paper is to reconstruct Nietzsche’s understanding of emotion from his varied writings and to investigate the relevance of his thought in the light of contemporary mainstream conceptualizations of emotions. It is worth discussing Nietzsche’s approach to emotions for at least two reasons. First, Nietzsche was a great advocate of passionate life and passionate philosophy, which he defined by reference to emotions. Second, he also provided many interesting insights concerning particular emotions, such as pity, envy, fear, resentment, love, joy, and so forth. In my paper I will focus on Nietzsche’s approach to emotion as such, leaving the studies of particular emotions aside since each of these would require a separate study. Reading Nietzsche’s philosophy of emotions through the lenses of contemporary theories of emotion helps to understand Nietzsche’s approach on the one hand and elucidates its uniqueness and not fully recognized influence on the other.\n\nThe book, Quintessence of Emotions in Man and His Self, is an anthology of twenty-one Reviews on Rajiv Khandelwal’s poetic volumes, Conch Shells and Cowries (CSC) and 21st Century Love Poems: Love is a lot of Work. (LILOW). Both Anthologies reinforce contextual and evaluative, interpretative skills in criticism with creative perception. This offers greater global awareness of erudition with reference to new forms of writings in every literary field and its allied academic work, reviews /articles being one of them. The opinions expressed in the ensuing, pedagogical contents of the book reflect the individual author’s evaluative aptitude."
