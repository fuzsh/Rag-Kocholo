Clint Goodson has, throughout my career, provided not just guidance and technical insight: he has been a rare kindred spirit for the kind of project I have attempted here. This book is closer in achievement to the dissertation I had wanted to write for him. Since our days together in Greensboro, Gray KochharLindgren has remained a remarkable friend and an excellent role model, always answering urgent and desperate emails about Kant and Heidegger as well as supplying me with courage through the example of his own innovative work. Over the years Barry Alford has stood me many lunches in a patient though persistent effort to help me overcome my many dogmatic errors. I hope this book attests to his success, and I will always try to emulate the example of intellectual generosity he continually exhibits. More recently, I have to thank Hedy Fraunhofer for her meticulous reading of parts of this manuscript as well as for her tireless help decoding Musil’s German for me. Haaris Naqvi, my editor at Continuum, somehow saw potential in the early stages of this project and provided what at the time seemed inexplicable encouragement to bring it to completion. It would be difficult to overestimate the contributions Haaris — and others like him — make to the field of academic scholarship. Any achievement scholars make in bringing clarity to ideas belongs to them as well. I hope all these people can find parts of themselves in the following pages. Above all, Brooke Harrison has continually provided acute professional guidance as well as inestimable emotional support since we met in East Lansing more than twenty years ago. She has helped me build a life in which books like this are possible. To her, I owe everything. Some chapters or versions of chapters have been previously published. A version of the Introduction was published in Symploke¯ : A Journal for the Intermingling of Literary, Cultural, and Theoretical Scholarship under the title “Latour, Musil, and the Discourse of Non-Modernity” (11 (2003): 183–96). Chapter 2 titled here “The Thought Figure of the NonModern” first appeared in only a slightly different form in Angelaki: A Journal for Theoretical Humanities as “Latour, Lyotard, and the Problematics of Legitimation” (10.3 (2005): 99–114).

I want to thank the editors of these journals and their editorial boards for providing early venues in which to test these ideas and thereby guide this project to its present form.\n\n9781441125590_txt_print.indd x\n\n9/6/11 9:29:59 AM\n\nA note on Musil’s texts\n\nThe bibliography of Musil’s work is a fairly complicated matter. Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften, Erstes Buch, was first published in German in 1930 by Rowohlt. This consists of “Erster Teil: Eine Art Einleitung,” and “Zweiter Teil: Seinesgleichen Geschieht.” In 1933 Der Mann ohne Eigneschaften, Zweites Buch appeared, also by Rowohlt. This section of the novel consists of the unfinished “Dritter Teil: Ins Tausendjährige Reich (Die Verbrecher).” In 1952 Adolf Frisé edited and published Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften: Gesammelte Werke in Einzelausgaben Vol. 1. And in 1955 Frisé released Tagebücher, Aphorismen, Essays und Reden: Gesammelte Werke in Einzelausgaben Vol. 2. This was followed in 1957 by Prosa, Dramen, Späte Briefe: Gesammelte Werke in Einzelausgaben Vol. 3. Since then the standard edition has become either the nine-volume paperback edition or the twovolume hardbound edition, Robert Musil: Gesammelte Werke edited by Adolf Frisé in 1978 and published by Rowohlt. (It was also originally available in a four-volume edition.) These editions have identical pagination. The 1978 Frisé edition contains significant material from Musil’s literary remains, including the twenty chapters of Part III that Musil withdrew while in galley proofs from the volume that was published in 1933. It also contains drafts of the final incomplete chapters and notes he had made on the development and direction of the novel. In the nine-volume version of the 1978 edition, volumes one through five consist of Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften and volumes six through nine contain Musil’s shorter fiction and dramatic pieces, short nonfiction, essays, lectures, and pieces of literary criticism. In the two-volume edition, the first volume contains Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften while the second volume contains everything else. The first English translation of the novel appeared in 1953 as The Man Without Qualities Vol. 1, translated by Eithne Wilkins and Ernst Kaiser, published by Coward-Mcann in New York. This was followed by The Man Without Qualities Vol. 2 in 1955. This has since been supplanted by the two-volume 1995 edition, The Man Without Qualities translated by Sophie Wilkins and Burton Pike, and published by Knopf. Volume 1 contains Parts I and II, while Volume 2 contains Part III, translations of the twenty galley chapters, and drafts and sketches of unfinished chapters. Burton Pike translated the material from the Nachlaß. The two volumes are paginated continuously.\n\n9781441125590_txt_print.indd xi\n\n9/6/11 9:29:59 AM\n\nxii A note on Musil’s texts More recently, the Internationale Robert Musil Gesellschaft (International Robert Musil Society) released in 2009 Robert Musil: Klagenfurter Ausgabe, edited by Walter Fanta, Klaus Amann and Karl Corino. This digital edition that comes on CD offers electronically searchable hypertexts of all Musil’s published and unpublished works as well as transcriptions and facsimiles of all of Musil’s papers housed in the Österreichische Nationalbibliotek in Vienna. Despite its comprehensiveness and the obvious advantages it affords for working across Musil’s wide œuvre, I have chosen to provide citations from the 1978 Frisé and the 1995 Wilkins editions, as I suspect these remain the editions most commonly used by scholars working in English and German, although the day is not far off when electronic texts will replace printed texts for scholarship in literature studies. The two volumes of Wilkins’ translation are paginated continuously, making volume numbers unnecessary. This is not the case with the 1978 Frisé edition, in which Volume 1 contains Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften and Volume 2 contains Musil’s shorter fiction, drama, and nonfiction. Consequently, it is necessary to supply volume numbers along with page numbers for the German citations. Therefore, citations for the novel appear as MWQ followed by page number for the English and as GW followed by volume number and page number for the German.\n\n9781441125590_txt_print.indd xii\n\n9/6/11 9:29:59 AM\n\nAbbreviations\n\nThe following are some of the more frequently used abbreviations throughout the book.

At the same time, however, among European readers Musil is regarded as having produced one of the monuments of modernist fiction rightfully placed alongside Proust’s À la Recherche du Temps Perdu and Joyce’s Ulysses. In 1999, for example, a collection of ninety-nine authors, critics, and Germanists voted Musil’s The Man Without Qualities the most important German novel of the twentieth century.1 The length and unfinished character of his magnum opus must certainly contribute to a general reception paradoxically incommensurate with its recognized achievement. Another reason is very likely the intellectually challenging nature of his work. Musil is undoubtedly among the most philosophical of European novelists. Given his deep and primary concern with the advantages and limitations of various modes of thinking for understanding and directing human experience in Modernity, it is not surprising that there have been many studies which articulate connections between Musil’s fiction and explicitly philosophical treatments of the problems of Modernity.2 These studies draw on various philosophical figures (Kant, Nietzsche, Mach, Husserl, Wittgenstein, for example) or movements (phenomenology, positivism, deconstruction) in order to explain Musil’s fiction. They often tend to begin from within the horizon of Western philosophy and attempt to draw Musil’s thought into that sphere. Musil, however, exhibits an explicit antipathy for systematic philosophy, referring to philosophers as despots who, lacking armies, lock up the world in systems of thought (MWQ 272; GW 1:253). Even more telling is Musil’s decision, after earning a doctorate with a dissertation on positivism, to turn down the offer of an assistantship at the Technische Hochschule München as well as one at Universität Graz in order to pursue a career as a novelist.3 And yet, as the numerous philosophical studies of Musil’s work doubtless attest, there remain what can only be described as genuinely philosophical concerns running throughout his fiction and nonfiction. The philosophical nature of his work coupled with the biographical fact of his choice to abandon an academic career in philosophy in order to become a novelist suggests that while Musil remained deeply and primarily concerned with philosophical problems, he deliberately stepped outside the tradition of Western philosophy in order to work through them. Musil’s achievements with\n\n9781441125590_txt_print.indd 1\n\n9/6/11 9:29:59 AM\n\n2\n\nRobert Musil and the nonmodern\n\nthese problems, it therefore seems, is best explored not by pulling his novel and essays into the sphere of Western philosophy but by allowing his work to pull those kinds of problems out of it. In the introduction to Margins of Philosophy Jacques Derrida raises the question of whether it is possible to “determine a nonphilosophical place, a place of exteriority or alterity from which one might still treat of philosophy” (xii). The question emerges from Derrida’s effort to investigate the operations of philosophy itself all the way down to its very foundations. Those foundations include the question of what is inside philosophy and what is outside, as well as, crucially, how that very border or limit is determined and how it is legislated. Derrida’s task raises the question of whether such an investigation is even possible apart from the practices of philosophy itself, and in general he remains skeptical about escaping the logocentrism which describes the horizon of the Western episte¯ me¯. Like Derrida, Musil is also drawn to the very border or limit of the episte¯ me¯, lured there not by philosophy’s self-critique, however, but by modes of experience and reflection that are not susceptible to systematic conceptual ordering, but that nonetheless hold the promise of a more authentic or more complete understanding of human existence. Much of Musil’s engagement with the problems of Modernity — above all the question of “the right way to live” — is shaped by the problem of how to negotiate the competing claims of conceptual and non-conceptual experience he terms the “normal” and the “Other Condition,” or by the question of whether it is possible to obliterate that distinction completely and fuse the ordinary and the Other Condition. Despite its importance as a potential source of a thoroughly ethical existence, Musil eventually abandons the possibility of permanently occupying the non-conceptual Other Condition as well as drawing from it any explicit principles for orienting life. Recoiling from the conceptual abyss of the Other Condition leaves Musil within the horizon of Western Reason yet drawn to its very boundary. Rather than trying to make Musil into a philosopher as has been the tendency of many efforts to address the presence of properly philosophical concerns in his work, I want to offer an exploration of his engagement with the problems of Modernity informed by Derrida’s notion of doing philosophy at the margins. That is, I want to propose a view of Musil en marge de la philosophie.4 The desire to escape the horizon of the Western episte¯ me¯, to step outside the specific discursive practices institutionalized in Western philosophy, and yet still engage the questions it has traditionally treated has been given the name “postmodern,” in the sense of an effort to abandon the ways that specifically “modern” philosophy has typically dealt with its questions. The title of Jürgen Habermas’ book The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity refers to continental philosophy’s attempts to generate answers to questions about the true, the good, and the beautiful in the\n\n9781441125590_txt_print.indd 2\n\n9/6/11 9:29:59 AM\n\nIntroduction: Robert Musil en marge 3 wake of Modernity’s turning its back on models supplied by the past. The sequence of those efforts takes the form of a “dialectic of enlightenment,” which, starting with Hegel, attempts to revise Western rationality in order to overcome the self-contradictions that arise from Modernity’s efforts to create normativity out of itself. Postmodernism, on Habermas’ account, is then the decision to give up on the possibility of rehabilitating Western reason, stepping outside the dialectic of enlightenment and appealing to something other than the versions of reason institutionalized in Western philosophy. In The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity Habermas characterizes two general trajectories of postmodernism: one exemplified by Nietzsche’s genealogical invocation of the “mad” figure of Dionysos against that of reasoned Apollo, the other exemplified in Heidegger’s attempt to destruct the history of metaphysics in the effort to return to the beginnings of Western philosophy in order to rethink the question of human being entirely anew. As the inheritor and torch bearer of the Frankfurt School, Habermas remains deeply suspicious of the form of rationality, namely “instrumental reason” (Zweckrationalität), that has been massively institutionalized in the course of a historically unfolding Modernity. Despite this strong suspicion, however, Habermas tends to dismiss efforts to abandon the dialectic of enlightenment as critiques of Western reason which destroy reason’s ability to engage in critique. Against these “irrationalist” postmodern efforts, he advocates carrying the dialectic of enlightenment one cycle further, this time by replacing subject-oriented instrumental reason with an inter-subjective “communicative reason” that still provides grounds for rational decision making.5 His tendency to regard the possibility of critique as an all-or-nothing thing (modern or postmodern), raises a number of questions — and it points to a couple of possibilities. One of these may be that we don’t have to choose between the modern and the postmodern. Conceiving Musil as en marge and reading him against the philosophical discourse of Modernity allows us to recognize and work through the possibility he offers of something between the modern and the postmodern as these have conventionally been understood. Guided by Habermas’ account of Modernity, the goal of this book is to read Robert Musil against — in a sense, into — the philosophical discourse of Modernity in order to explore the discursive alternatives he offers to both modern and postmodern treatments of problems associated with Modernity’s effort to create normativity out of itself. Using Habermas as an interlocutor, then, this book explores three claims. First, that Robert Musil’s fiction and nonfiction constitutes an intervention in the cultural and intellectual issues that make up the philosophical discourse of Modernity. Second, that that intervention is guided by Musil’s theory of the essay and his performance of Essayismus as a discursive space and\n\n9781441125590_txt_print.indd 3\n\n9/6/11 9:29:59 AM\n\n4\n\nRobert Musil and the nonmodern\n\ndiscursive strategy remarkably well tuned to negotiate the entanglements of Modernity from a position en marge de la philosophie. And third, that Musil’s Essayismus thus represents an alternative to canonical versions of both the modern and the postmodern, one that might best be understood as “nonmodern.” Given his interest in exploring alternatives to the forms of reason institutionalized in Modernity, it is tempting to place Musil in the company of the postmoderns, reading his choice of fiction over philosophy and his exploration of the mystical experience he calls the Other Condition as an irrationalist, postmodern farewell to reason. On closer inspection, however, things are significantly more complicated than the modern/ postmodern heuristic suggests. For one thing, under the heading of precision (Genauigkeit) Musil remains committed to essential features of the kind of thinking associated with the natural sciences, which, Habermas argues, has massively informed the philosophical discourse of Modernity since the end of the eighteenth century.6 At the same time, however, Musil explicitly and repeatedly connects scientific rationality with the very same kinds of violence that lead Habermas and others to seek an overthrow of instrumental reason. Beyond this sense of the cultural danger instrumental reason threatens, Musil is convinced of the severely limited applicability of systematic thinking of all kinds to the most important domains of human experience. These commitments leave him connected to and at the same time skeptical toward many of the signature intellectual practices associated with the Western episte¯me¯. The possibility of treating philosophical questions from a position neither inside (modern) nor outside (postmodern) the dialectic of enlightenment but somehow at the very margin of philosophy becomes a little more thinkable if we complicate standard accounts of Modernity with others that are not as committed to either its continuation or its destruction. Bruno Latour has at least opened a door to such a possibility with his book We Have Never Been Modern (1993), in which he examines the long-standing conflict between science and the humanities that is otherwise known as the “science wars.” Updating the terms of the debate that in the 1950s C. P. Snow called “the two culture problem,”7 we can begin to characterize the conflict as an opposition between versions of “realism” and those of social (linguistic) “constructivism.” Whereas the former tend to regard science as discovering a world ready-made, the latter insist that science creates that world in the process of “discovering” it. Latour is an early and important figure in the field of science studies, and he approaches the phenomenon of the science wars with an interest in understanding science’s place and role in contemporary society. But Latour’s account of this conflict has implications that go beyond the sociology of science, for he sees the science wars as a particular symptom of “modernism” itself.8\n\n9781441125590_txt_print.indd 4\n\n9/6/11 9:29:59 AM\n\nIntroduction: Robert Musil en marge 5 Latour characterizes the modern intellectual constitution as consisting of two sets of intellectual practices. The practice of “purification” divides an otherwise undifferentiated world into smaller and smaller entities (humans and gods, all the way down to atoms, elections, protons, neutrons, etc.). (“Pre-modern” peoples, by contrast, tended to see the human world as continuous with the nonhuman.) More generally, purification carves up the world into distinct ontological zones: a human world of Culture on the one hand and a nonhuman world of Nature on the other. Human control is thought to be immanent in the former, absent in the latter such that natural forces alone govern the nonhuman world while human society is an entirely human product. The other practice making up the modern intellectual constitution, “Mediation” or “translation,” creates mixtures of purified entities, hybrids of nature and culture that are neither entirely human nor nonhuman (Never Been Modern 10–11). Weaponized nuclear fission, genetically altered crops, and synthesized antibiotics are examples of the work of mediation successfully integrating nonhumans into a human world. According to Latour, the science wars are a product of the distinctively modern tendency to privilege purification over mediation. He contends that concern for the consequences to the human world of introducing new nonhumans tends to slow down or stop the work of purification; it tends to stop scientific “progress.” The modern emphasis on purification has encouraged humans to regard nonhumans as raw bits of nature and themselves as purely cultural phenomena, thus triggering the opposition between realism and constructivism. Latour rejoins that supposedly independent nonhumans are always the product of human mediation, in laboratories or field work, for example. And, conversely, the human world has always been populated with nonhumans that have been successfully integrated into human society. In fact, Latour argues that we have never really been modern because we have never really abided by an intellectual constitution that imagines humans and nonhumans as existing in separate ontological zones. Revising the modern intellectual constitution involves abandoning the polar thinking that is reified in the privileging of purification. It means officially reconnecting the work of purification with that of mediation and thereby obliterating the specious distinction between hermetically separated human and nonhuman domains. One implication of reconnecting purification with mediation amounts to recognizing that explanations of the world need no longer to proceed exclusively from extreme poles of nonhuman Nature and human Culture but, rather, that those categories are themselves the products of distinctively modernist habits of thinking. Acknowledging this means no longer having to choose between the supposed “objectivity” of denotative discourses like the natural science on the one hand or the narrated “relativism” of social constructivism on the other. In other words, rewriting the\n\n9781441125590_txt_print.indd 5\n\n9/6/11 9:30:00 AM\n\n6\n\nRobert Musil and the nonmodern\n\nmodern constitution involves de-privileging the practices of purification that have historically been the center of modern science. This is what it would mean to become un-modern, or nonmodern. More generally, Latour’s nonmodernism is an effort to think about knowledge production without the distinctions on which Modernity (modern science, for example) grounded itself. The thought figure of the nonmodern that his critique of modern science suggests thus opens the possibility of exploring questions and problems of Modernity without some of Modernity’s most defining self-privilegings. Drawing on Latour’s schematization of the intellectual practices of Modernity, but allowing it be more suggestive than programmatic, I want to use the thought figure of the nonmodern as a heuristic device with which to approach the possibility of treating philosophical questions at the very margin of philosophy. More specifically, I want to propose Robert Musil’s mobilization of the essay and the discursive praxis into which he develops it as an intervention into the philosophical discourse of Modernity en marge, one that is suggested by and clarified with the thought figure of the nonmodern. In Chapter Sixty-Two of The Man Without Qualities the narrator explains the protagonist’s dissatisfaction with the traditional opposition between thought and feeling: “A man who wants the truth becomes a scholar; a man who wants to give free play to his subjectivity may become a writer; but what should a man do who wants something in between?” (MWQ 274; GW 1:254). Much earlier, in a fragment of an unpublished essay, Musil proposes the essay as a mediation of science on the one hand and life and art on the other: that is, as a way to open a discursive space between objective truth and subjective experience (PS 48; GW 2:1334). These domains are traditionally distinguished by the fact that the results of science admit a “far-reaching conceptual order” (PS 48; GW 2:1334–1335).9 That is, scientific knowledge is governed by the regularity of laws, which produce mathematical and logical truths. The domain of life and art, on the other hand, allows for no such systematic order. Between science and art, Musil contends, lies the essay, which “takes its form and method from the sciences, its matter from art” (PS 49; GW 2:1335). Like the sciences, the essay seeks to establish an order among “facts” of life, except that the “facts” in this case are not necessarily repeatedly available, and the connections between them are often only a singularity in the sense that they are not reducible to instances of general laws. In other words, the elements of experience are not necessarily ordered in the same way for everyone. These two conditions make it impossible to describe life in terms of the kinds of regularities the natural sciences seek and in turn offer. Musil’s conception of the essay thus concerns the possibility of a discursive space analogous to that suggested by Latour’s conception of the nonmodern: a space not inscribed with purified ontological or discursive distinctions.\n\n9781441125590_txt_print.indd 6\n\n9/6/11 9:30:00 AM\n\nIntroduction: Robert Musil en marge 7 One important possibility opened by the essay as such a discursive space is an approach to the complexities of human experience that does not reduce them to the regularities sought for by the natural sciences — yet that still aspires to a kind of precision. Beyond simply disclosing a discursive space between science and art, Musil’s mobilization of the essay develops into a discursive praxis that strategically avoids the purification Latour finds characteristic of modernism. Referred to by Musil as “Essayismus,” this discursive strategy operationalizes an awareness that the categories with which we conceptualize the world and human experiences are not as reliable, stable, or universal as they appear. Moreover, as a discursive praxis Essayismus dereifies conceptual and ontological distinctions in order to reimagine the intellectual and experiential territories onto which they have been inscribed. There is no adequate equivalent in English for the German Essayismus. The English “essayism” tends to denigrate the genre of the essay and its modes of reflection as something merely belletristic. Essayismus, of course, draws on the etymological roots of “essay,” which derive from the French “assay,” meaning weighing, trial or attempt.10 Within Musil’s conceptual universe this reference operates more closely to the sense of “experiment” as that term is understood in the natural sciences. In his hands, however, the notion of experimentation detaches itself from the idea of an accurate description of reality and bears with it an epistemological modesty that comes from abandoning the quest for a universal, monological truth. Theodor Adorno, for example, points out that the essay has historically been regarded as unphilosophical precisely because it does not strive for the universal (“The Essay as Form” 3). Essayismus as a discursive strategy of experimentation, decidedly not in the mode of episte¯ me¯, thus offers itself as one possibility for operating en marge de la philosophie: that is, apart from Western philosophy’s quest for truth, or apart from what Derrida has termed its “logocentrism.”11 Essayismus thus answers to Musil’s sense that the general cultural crisis of Modernity is not that we “have too much intellect and too little soul, but too little intellect in matters of the soul” (PS 131; GW: 2:1092). Essayismus is a major feature of scholarly attention to Musil, and many readers of The Man Without Qualities have commented on the novel’s combination of factual and fictive discourses. It may be useful at the start to highlight some basic elements of Musil’s Essayismus before moving on in subsequent chapters to its more technical features. A frequently cited example is the meteorological description in the novel’s very first paragraph: A barometric low hung over the Atlantic. It moved toward a high-pressure area over Russia without as yet showing any\n\n9781441125590_txt_print.indd 7\n\n9/6/11 9:30:00 AM\n\n8\n\nRobert Musil and the nonmodern inclination to bypass this high in a northerly direction. The isotherms and isotheres were functioning as they should. The air temperature was appropriate relative to the annual mean temperature and to the aperiodic monthly fluctuations of the temperature . . . The water vapor in the air was at its maximal state of tension, while the humidity was minimal. In a word that characterizes the facts fairly accurately, even if it is a bit old-fashioned: It was a fine day in August 1913. (MWQ 3; GW 1:9)\n\nThe novel’s opening consists of two descriptions. The first, meteorological, description is more precise but in a way less useful than the second, ordinary language, one because it does not convey, but rather hides, how one is supposed to understand these weather conditions. That is, the denotative description does not represent the weather in connection with human interests. It signals, in this sense, a purification of the natural from the human world. Similarly, although conveying more human meaning, the ordinary language description has none of the “precision” of the scientific description, such that no two readers are apt to imagine exactly the same set of conditions. The Essayismus of the opening passage of The Man Without Qualities effects a nonmodern critique of modernist purification by simultaneously destabilizing the denotative as well as the narrative discursive modes in the passage. Denotative discourse such as the scientific description above maintains an implicit separation of nonhuman and human, purifying natural phenomena of human concerns about them. This separation is intimately tied to science’s supposed objectivity. The practice of purification becomes striking at the end of the passage when human concerns are abruptly reintroduced in the passage’s final independent clause. By juxtaposing these two discursive modes, Musil emphasizes the human interests that have been occluded from the scientific description. Conversely, the ordinary language description specifically mediates human interests and nonhuman phenomena in the creation of the hybrid entity “a fine day.” At the same time, however, the vagueness of “a fine day” appears against the background of the scientific description of the weather. In colliding denotative and narrative discourses in a single paragraph, Musil’s Essayismus points to the modernist purification characteristic of denotative discourse and gestures toward its alternative: a nonmodern, essayistic mediation of the human and the nonhuman, which takes place not quite on the page but rather in the reader’s mind as a product of the juxtaposition of these two descriptions. The critique of modernist purification carried out here by Essayismus is not simply the additive effect of juxtaposing two or more discursive modalities in a single passage. Nor is it achieved by a merely dialectical\n\n9781441125590_txt_print.indd 8\n\n9/6/11 9:30:00 AM\n\nIntroduction: Robert Musil en marge 9 movement, because the two alternatives are not resolved in a synthetic moment of Aufhebung. Both descriptions — both discursive modes — are suspended in what Walter Moser has called an “interdiscursive space” in which the tensions between the discursive modes are preserved for the purpose of mutual destabilization. Moser argues that Musil’s main target was the idea that true science had to establish an ontologically-founded correspondence with the factual world. He concludes that through fiction, “Musil showed this claim to be untenable, questioned the ontological conception of truth, and showed how its workings become impossible in specific, fictionally posited situations” (“The Fact in Fiction” 427). At the same time, however, a trained engineer and mathematician, Musil railed against those who “deny facts and call that thinking” as well as those who “blame our rationality and desire to be less rational” (PS 184; GW 2:1391). Musil was simultaneously dissatisfied with the limits of both referential and non-referential discourses, and both are targeted via Essayismus. Musil’s Essayismus, however, serves not only to dramatize the limits of denotative and narrative discourses;12 it functions itself as a positive discursive strategy constitutive of a specifically nonmodern approach to experience — an alternative to worldviews characterized by purified and reified ontological domains and concepts. This dimension of Essayismus begins to emerge in Musil’s sense of the essay as a discursive space specifically appropriate to thinking precisely about life and art, which phenomena do not typically admit precision of the ordinary scientific kind. In his discussion of the essay, Musil cites Maurice Maeterlinck’s observation that “Instead of a truth the essay gives three good probabilities” (PS 49; GW 2:1335). The idea of truth in modernist, denotative discourse is generally linked with that of a single correct description of an external state of affairs. By destabilizing denotative discourse, Essayismus draws into question the very possibility of an accurate description of the world, and, hence, the possibility of Truth as the single correct one. Consequently, any single description can be only a partial representation of the way things are, what Musil refers to as a “partial solution” (Partiallösung) (PS 49; GW 2:1335).13 However, according to Musil, partial solutions are more than simply the best one can do in the absence of reliable denotative representation. In fact, Musil characterizes the essay as “the strictest form attainable in an area where one cannot work precisely” (PS 48; GW 2:1334). Thus, Musil conceives of the essay as a discursive space specifically suited for those areas of human experience which do not admit precision in the ordinary sense. Such an area, for Musil, is one “in which it is not truth that dominates” but rather “in which probability is something more than an approach to truth” [emphasis added] (PS 49; GW 2:1335). Paralleling Musil’s idea that the domain of the essay is one in which probability is more desirable than truth, Essayismus — as the discursive\n\n9781441125590_txt_print.indd 9\n\n9/6/11 9:30:00 AM\n\n10\n\nRobert Musil and the nonmodern\n\nstrategy most appropriate to this domain — is closely associated in The Man Without Qualities with a heightened sense of the arbitrariness of the actual. In Chapter Four the narrator explains that alongside a sense of reality there must also be a sense of possibility, which Musil refers to as “Möglichkeitssinn.” The narrator describes this as “the ability to conceive of everything there might be just as well, and to attach no more importance to what is than what is not” (MWQ 11; GW 1:16). The narrator later explains that a person with a sense of possibility suspects that the given order of things is not as solid as it pretends to be; no thing, no self, no form, no principle, is safe, everything is undergoing an invisible but ceaseless transformation, the unsettled holds more of the future than the settled, and the present is nothing but a hypothesis that has not yet been surmounted. (MWQ 269; GW 1:250) Eventually for Ulrich the provisionality of the actual “became an idea no longer associated with the vague word ‘hypothesis’ but with the concept he oddly termed, for certain reasons, ‘essay’” (MWQ 270; GW 1:250). In regarding what is possible as no less real than what is actual, Möglichkeitssinn does not categorically reject the fundamental modernist distinction between what is and what is not, but it does de-privilege it. That is, it no longer treats the distinction as in any sense a priori, given, or concrete, retaining it instead as a provisional analytical category: useful to think with but not, therefore, “real.” In this way, Essayismus as an extension of Möglichkeitssinn strategically avoids the purification of distinct ontological domains Latour finds characteristic of modernism. Simply by avoiding modernist purification, Musil takes an important step in the direction of the nonmodern, but the discursive practice of Essayismus continues this movement away from modernism by configuring an individual’s engagement with the world in terms of a nonmodern mediation of human and nonhuman domains. By privileging possibility over Truth and even over Reality, Essayismus points beyond a critique of denotative discourse and beyond an alternative way of seeing the world to function as the discursive strategy that is ultimately productive of an alternative way of being in the world, what Musil terms the Other Condition (PS 185; GW 2:1392). The Other Condition involves in part an alternative experience of the relation subject and object. In the ordinary condition, Musil explains, “a thin line connects the individual with his object and attaches itself to both the object and the person at only a single point, while all the rest of the person’s being remains untouched” (PS 185; GW 2:1392). In all such “objective” relationships, Musil argues, the self is “bracketed” (ausgeschaltet) in a way that produces a kind of “alienation” (PS 186; GW 2:1393). No such alienation obtains in the case of the Other Condition.\n\n9781441125590_txt_print.indd 10\n\n9/6/11 9:30:00 AM\n\nIntroduction: Robert Musil en marge 11 What is common to all instances of the Other Condition is that “the border between self and non-self is less sharp than usual” (PS 186; GW 2:1393). Instead of being alienated “One participates in things (understands their language). In this condition understanding is not impersonal (objective), but extremely personal, like an agreement between subject and object” (PS 186; GW 2:1393). Musil goes on to characterize the other condition as “a dereification of the self as of the world” (PS 187; GW 2:1394).14 In an essay, the title of which, “Exact and Human,” points to the conventional opposition Musil is concerned to abandon, Michel Serres discusses Musil’s fiction in connection with the problem of the gap between the knower and the known. Serres sees Musil as a model for negotiating “the fluctuating boundaries of order and disorder where the common border between subject and object is always bracketed” (17). The Other Condition is that condition in which the border between subject and object is no longer bracketed. And it is arrived at via Essayismus: that is, via a discursive strategy adapted to the domain of the essay, which Musil describes as existing between domains which admit a far-reaching conceptual order and those which do not (PS 48; GW 2:1335). The project of this book, then, is to read Musil into the philosophical discourse of Modernity in order to explore his engagement with traditionally philosophical problems from a position at the margin of the Western episte¯ me¯, one neither conventionally modern nor postmodern, but something that can best be characterized as nonmodern. Despite its susceptibility to objections, many of which I explore in subsequent chapters, Habermas’ book, The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity, offers a robust account of the trajectory of philosophical reflection in and about Modernity against which to examine Musil’s intervention into those questions. At the same time, reading Musil alongside canonical postmoderns like Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Lyotard helps us to recognize features of his divergence from the practices of philosophical modernism and to recognize the nonmodern alternative he makes available. It is my hope that situating Musil in the debates about the modern and the postmodern will introduce Musil scholars and those working in the problematics of postmodernism to one another’s interests. Chapter 1 offers a derivation of Bruno Latour’s notion of the nonmodern by exploring the relation of Latour’s nonmodernism to other critical accounts of Modernity: Habermas’ and, more extensively, that of Jean-François Lyotard. One way to test whether the nonmodern is simply another species of the postmodern is by comparing Latour and Lyotard in terms of their analyses of the pragmatics of legitimation according to which scientific statements are determined to be true or at least scientific. Both Latour and Lyotard begin, in a sense, from a suspicion regarding the relation of science to other discourses, specifically politics. Latour, however, develops a response to the problematic linkage of discourses\n\n9781441125590_txt_print.indd 11\n\n9/6/11 9:30:00 AM\n\n12\n\nRobert Musil and the nonmodern\n\nabout the natural world to those of the human world that is categorically different from Lyotard’s insistence on keeping them separate. It involves reconceptualizing what is meant by science in the first place. The pattern and features of this reconceptualization offer a trope – namely, the nonmodern — for characterizing and developing Musil’s engagement with problems in the philosophical discourse of Modernity. Chapters 2 and 3 examine Musil in relation to two important sites of the postmodern in order to characterize his engagement with the problems of Modernity from a position at the margin of philosophy. Chapter 2 characterizes Musil’s complex relation to the discursive practices of Modernity through a comparative reading with Friedrich Nietzsche. In The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity Jürgen Habermas positions Nietzsche as the entry into postmodernity on the view that Nietzsche abandons the attempt to rehabilitate reason and “bids farewell to the dialectic of enlightenment” (PDM 86) in “an unmasking critique of reason that sets itself outside the horizon of reason” (PDM 96). Habermas’ reading of Nietzsche is contested by those who see Nietzsche as not simply appealing to reason’s absolute other in the figure of Dionysos but holding a much more complex and nuanced position relative to the discourses of truth. Alexander Nehamas belongs to this tendency and argues that Nietzsche holds an essentially equivocal relation to Modernity. Nietzsche is the philosopher Musil cites far more than any other, and there are many thematic correspondences between Nietzsche’s thought and Musil’s. Like Nietzsche on Nehamas’s reading, Musil is invested in the effort to intersect literature and philosophy. Musil’s Essayismus corresponds closely to Nietzsche’s perspectivism, while the liberating sense of possibility Musil terms Möglichkeitssinn gives rise to an attitude toward existing social structures that is very much like that of Nietzsche’s “free spirits.” Comparison with Nietzsche thus brings into focus Musil’s complex relation to the discursive practices of Modernity. Musil holds on to features of scientific and mathematical thought while remaining wary of the dangers associated with these forms of instrumental reason. Chapter 3 investigates Musil’s relation to a second influential attempt to move outside the horizon of the Western philosophical tradition: that of Martin Heidegger. Musil and Heidegger were contemporaries, although there has been very little analysis of the correspondences between their critical responses to Modernity. Working through these correspondences reveals that Musil and Heidegger were involved in closely parallel if not, in fact, the same project: the effort to disclose an authentic mode of Being that had become concealed within the everyday practices of modern experience. In the form of narrative fiction, Musil offers something like an existential analysis of human being which discloses a fundamental potentiality-for-being that has become concealed in the publicness of everyday life.\n\n9781441125590_txt_print.indd 12\n\n9/6/11 9:30:00 AM\n\nIntroduction: Robert Musil en marge 13 With important details to Musil’s relation to the discursive practices of the modern and the postmodern worked out through these comparisons with Nietzsche and Heidegger, Chapter 4 turns to consider Musil’s relation to the cultural project of Modernity generally. Breaking with the past, Habermas writes, “Modernity can and will no longer borrow the criteria by which it takes its orientation from the models supplied by another epoch; it has to create its normativity out of itself” (PDM 7). According to Habermas, Modernity’s effort to create normativity out of itself took shape as the institutionalization of a specifically subject-centered reason whose principle feature — reflexivity — embodies the structural principle of Modernity itself. Subject-centered reason, as the name implies, involves regarding all non-self objects as means to the gratification of the self’s will and is therefore associated with domination. This problem is what sets Habermas looking for an alternative in the possibility of intersubjective forms of reason. Musil, too, seeks an alternative to subject-centered reason in the form of a textual subjectivity that derives from and is driven by the discursive practice of Essayismus. Essayismus thus represents a challenge to the structural principle of Modernity itself. After mapping in Chapters 2, 3, and 4 Musil’s intervention into these problems of Modernity, it becomes possible to think about extending the example of Essayismus he represents beyond his own achievements. Against the background of Peter Bürger’s account of the historical avantgarde, Chapter 5 examines Musil’s treatment of the modern aesthetic strategies of autonomy and sublation, which are associated, respectively, with aestheticism and the avant-garde. Musil’s novel The Man Without Qualities can be read as setting up and running experiments that test the viability of strategies of autonomy and sublation for orienting ethically satisfactory life in Modernity. In light of these experiments, Musil’s Essayismus emerges as a discursive alternative to the historical avantgarde’s attempt to draw on art in order to redirect the life praxis of lifeworld. Moreover, Musil’s Essayismus represents not only an alternative to the modern avant-garde, overcoming its tendency to modernist purification: it also avoids the same aporias in Lyotard’s postmodern version of the avant-garde. Finally, in Chapter 6, “Judgment Without Criteria,” I consider Musil’s Essayismus in connection with another important topic closely associated with the cultural project of Modernity, namely systematic thinking about the just society. Lyotard argues in Just Gaming that Western political philosophy has tended to begin with an ideal (true) conception of the just society from which prescriptive statements are derived according to which an existing society may be brought into conformity with the ideal. The movement from true statements to prescriptive statements, however, involves transgressing the borders of discrete language games whose rules are incommensurable. The invalidity of a procedure of political reflection\n\n9781441125590_txt_print.indd 13\n\n9/6/11 9:30:00 AM\n\n14\n\nRobert Musil and the nonmodern\n\nthat moves from generalized, ideal descriptions to particular prescriptions of what should be done thus precludes the possibility of a science of politics. As an alternative to the practice of applying universal, a priori, concepts (of the good, the true, the beautiful) to particular cases, Lyotard turns to the distinction in Kantian philosophy between determining and reflective judgment. Reflective judgment secures the minimal conditions for cognition in cases where no universal concept is available under which to subsume a particular case. Musil’s Essayismus, I argue in this chapter, operates very much like Kantian reflective judgment and thus makes possible a mode of judgment that avoids the problem of incommensurability Lyotard observes in the operation of a science of politics. It thus answers to the postmodern possibility for judgment without criteria. The attempt of these chapters is to explore and develop Musil’s mobilization of Essayismus as a strategic intervention into the problems and questions associated with the philosophical discourse of Modernity, generally with special emphasis given to the question of what modes of reflection are appropriate to the effort to create normativity out of one’s own moment. The chapters pursue this goal by reading Musil alongside pivotal figures of the postmodern effort to access and explore territory at the traditional horizon of the Western episte¯ me¯. The various readings of Musil’s Essayismus that these chapters offer are not precisely convergent. That is, they do not add up to a synthetic whole, and they do not attempt to show that Musil holds a fully worked out theory of the essay. Instead they represent, in the spirit of Essayismus, attempts to view an object — in this case, Musil’s engagement with the problematics of Modernity — from many sides without wholly encompassing it. Such an effort involves traversing Musil’s œuvre from different angles and returning to important nodes in his texts from a variety of paths in order to draw his thinking into sometimes convergent, sometimes parallel, and sometimes divergent connections. The map that emerges is not to be inscribed with a grid but constitutes, to borrow from Calvino, a network of lines that enlace.\n\n9781441125590_txt_print.indd 14\n\n9/6/11 9:30:00 AM\n\n1\n\nThe thought figure of the nonmodern\n\nIn order to begin recovering (or inventing) a version of Robert Musil en marge it will be necessary to remap the intellectual territory within which his engagement with the problems of Modernity takes place. As announced in my Introduction, the thought figure of the nonmodern provides a trope with which to appropriate Robert Musil’s Essayismus as a strategic intervention into the philosophical discourse of Modernity; that is, as an alternative to both the modern and the postmodern. It has become a commonplace to bemoan the inadequacy of the designations “modern” and “postmodern” for traversing the landscape of questions and possibilities signaled by these terms, and with good reason. Clearly, the intellectual and cultural phenomena they are meant to reference are far too heterogeneous to be captured by what are inevitably inadequate labels. There is a benefit, however, to working at a relatively high level of generality in order to characterize large patterns in the history of ideas into which newly recognized possibilities might be situated. Moreover, the problems, questions, efforts and understandings at issue here have been cast in the language of the “modern” and the “postmodern,” and it is only by working through these problems, questions, and efforts in the ways they have been formulated that we may be able to move beyond such inadequate terms or find more satisfactory ways to recast them. So, for the time being, “modern” and “postmodern” will have to suffice provided we continually use them in a provisional way. I have attempted to keep this provisionality in mind by using, whenever possible, the intentionally vague formulations “the modern,” “the postmodern,” and “the nonmodern,” which gesture toward the complexes of issues these terms signal. It will be helpful, however, to fill in this territory with examples of specific theorists and their arguments without, nevertheless, thereby implying that what is being discussed pertains to everything that travels under the banner of these titles. We can start to fill them in by turning first to established accounts of the modern and the postmodern, reading them against one another in order to look for lines of fracture. In what has come to be one standard account of Modernity, Jürgen Habermas’ The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity begins by articulating Modernity’s consciousness of time: its sense of rupture with the past\n\n9781441125590_txt_print.indd 15\n\n9/6/11 9:30:00 AM\n\n16\n\nRobert Musil and the nonmodern\n\noccasioned by the discovery of the New World, the Renaissance, and the Reformation as “three monumental events around the year 1500 [which] constituted the epochal threshold between modern times and the middle ages” (PDM 5). The enduring cultural problematic that is Modernity was launched by this sense of rupture: breaking from the past “Modernity can and will no longer borrow the criteria by which it takes its orientation from the models supplied by another epoch; it has to create its normativity out of itself” (PDM 7). Put another way, the problem Modernity faces is how to generate criteria of the true, the good, and the beautiful without reference to either transcendental authority or precedents from past historical configurations. Kant responded methodologically to Modernity’s problem of creating normativity with the invention of critical philosophy. In “immanent critique” reason bends back on itself to interrogate the very conditions under which it comes to know the highest forms of truth, goodness, and beauty. Kantian philosophy thus “installed reason in the supreme seat of judgment before which anything that made a claim to validity had to be justified” (PDM 18). For Habermas and the Frankfurt School, one persistent defect of the philosophical trajectory that Modernity inherited from Kant has turned out to be the reification of science, morality, and art as separate cultural spheres, and the supervention of theoretic reason over moral and aesthetic reasons. This supervention is the result of the project of Modernity, which sought to develop objective science, universal morality and law, and autonomous art according to the internal logics of each and to use the results of research in each cultural sphere for increased rationalized everyday life (“Modernity versus Postmodernity” 9). Habermas’ account of this project suggests that Enlightenment thinkers . . . had the extravagant expectation that the arts and sciences would promote not only the control of natural forces, but would also further understanding of the world and the self, would promote moral progress, the justice of institutions, and even the happiness of human beings. The 20th century has shattered this optimism. The differentiation of science, morality, and art has come to mean the autonomy of the segments treated by the specialist and at the same time letting them split off from the hermeneutics of everyday communication. (“Modernity versus Postmodernity” 9) On this reading, the project is incomplete in the sense that the results of research in each of the spheres have not been brought together and re-synthesized. Conversely, Habermas insists that “a reified everyday praxis can be cured only by creating unconstrained interaction of the cognitive with the moral-practical and the aesthetic-expressive elements”\n\n9781441125590_txt_print.indd 16\n\n9/6/11 9:30:00 AM\n\nThe thought figure of the nonmodern\n\n17\n\n(“Modernity versus Postmodernity” 11). Rather than abandoning the project of Modernity, Habermas argues in favor of completing it by setting the separate spheres back into communication with one another, addressing the problem of normativity through re-connecting science with morality and art. Jean-François Lyotard’s intervention in the philosophical discourse of Modernity directly addresses a problem which arises from attempts, such as Habermas’, to create normativity by linking discourses of the “true” to those of the “just,” or vice versa. He is suspicious about the kind of unity of experience Habermas intends as the result of putting the spheres of culture back together (“What is Postmodernism?” 72–3). Lyotard’s suspicion is grounded in a technical question about “the passage that has to be charted between heterogeneous language games — those of cognition, of ethics, of politics” (“What is Postmodernism?” 72): namely, whether it is appropriate or even possible to link or combine them as Habermas suggests. Answers to the question of the relation of discourses have come to mark one site of divergence between modern and postmodern interventions in the philosophical discourse of Modernity, and thereby have established, to some extent, the conditions under which alternatives might be sought. In The Postmodern Condition Lyotard designates as modern “any science that legitimates itself with reference to a metadiscourse . . . making an explicit appeal to some grand narrative,” the two most historically important of which are Idealism (the inherent value of knowledge for its own sake) and Socialism (the progressive emancipation of the human subject) (PMC xxiii). Conversely, the simplified definition of the postmodern that Lyotard offers is, as everyone knows, “an incredulity toward metanarratives” (PMC xxx). Regarded as a discourse of legitimation, the metanarrative of Idealism amounts to scientism, justifying the production of virtually all scientific knowledge as part of the infinite self-unfolding of Reason that Hegel describes in the Phenomenology of Spirit. However, according to Lyotard, Idealism’s ability to function as a metanarrative of legitimation suffered from an internal instability of the legitimacy principle of knowledge itself (PMC 39). Speculative philosophy, he points out, holds an ambiguous relation toward science: while serving to legitimate science as knowledge, it is simultaneously skeptical of the basis of science’s claim to knowledge, namely, empiricism. In other words, Idealism folds mere empiricism within itself as just one, partial, instantiation of Reason, thus relegating the rules of science to a particular form of knowledge. From the perspective of science, on the other hand, Idealism does not precisely conform to the rules of science’s own language game (denotation), and is therefore regarded by science as a pre-scientific form of knowledge (i.e., narrative). In short, once it makes this recognition, science no longer needs philosophy’s\n\n9781441125590_txt_print.indd 17\n\n9/6/11 9:30:00 AM\n\n18\n\nRobert Musil and the nonmodern\n\nmystifications to legitimate it. Ernst Mach’s positivism — his attempt to purge the so-called exact sciences of all metaphysics — is an exemplary case of this internal erosion by which science separates itself from speculative philosophy, a development Lyotard terms “delegitimation” (PMC 37–41). The second metanarrative, Socialism, tells the heroic story of “the emancipation of the rational or working subject” (PMC 31). It is a metanarrative grounded on a notion of the inherent value of the human or its inalienable rights. Lyotard explains, for example, that emancipation’s legitimation of knowledge insists that “all peoples have a right to science” (PMC 31). For Lyotard, socialism lost its credibility when its critical principle (a dualistic conception of society based upon the idea of class struggle) was partially dissolved by the internal regulatory mechanisms of liberal democracy: in other words, as capitalist societies found ways to absorb and redirect class conflict through the development of social programs in the modern liberal state (PMC 12–13). From that point on, Lyotard argues, the goals of socialism were reduced to “utopia” or “hope” (PMC 13). Incredulity toward metanarratives is not, however, all there is to Lyotard’s account of the postmodern, although many readers neglect to read beyond this point. The more valuable portion of The Postmodern Condition offers an analysis of the pragmatics according to which scientific knowledge is legitimated in the absence of metanarratives. His analysis illuminates significant problems in those efforts to create normativity that involve linking discourses of the true to those of the good/just. Lyotard argues that in the absence of credulity toward metanarratives, the de facto legitimation of scientific knowledge takes place within a general context of what he terms “performativity”: good, or legitimate, or valid science is what improves the efficiency of a system by optimizing its input/output ratio. (For example, the introduction of robotic technology to industrial manufacturing increases profit by reducing labor costs.) The advent of postmodern science, Lyotard explains, exhibits two important changes from modernist science: “a multiplication in methods of argumentation and a rising complexity level in the process of establishing proof” (PMC 41). Concerning the latter, Lyotard points out that “the need for proof becomes increasingly strong as the pragmatics of scientific knowledge replaces traditional knowledge or knowledge based on revelation” (PMC 44). A scientist must adduce proof in the form of observed facts in order for his or her statements to be accepted as true. Technology optimizes observation and thus increases a scientist’s chances of being right. But “devices that optimize the performance of the human body for the purpose of producing proof require additional expenditures. No money, no proof — and that means no verification of statements and no truth” (PMC 44–5). The advent of this financial requirement has forced science to play a language game other than its own:\n\n9781441125590_txt_print.indd 18\n\n9/6/11 9:30:00 AM\n\nThe thought figure of the nonmodern\n\n19\n\nThe production of proof, which is in principle only part of an argumentation process designed to win agreement from the addressees of scientific messages, thus falls under the control of another language game, in which the goal is no longer truth, but performativity — that is, the best possible input/output equation. The State and/or company must abandon the idealist and humanist narratives of legitimation in order to justify the new goal: in the discourse of today’s financial backers of research, the only credible goal is power. Scientists, technicians, and instruments are purchased not to find truth, but to augment power. (PMC 46) Science thus comes under the spell of politics, what Lyotard refers to as “the discourse of power” (PMC 46), through performativity, whose principle is efficiency: maximization of output relative to given input. In this way the postmodern pragmatics of science entails a linkage of science (discourse of truth) with politics (discourse of justice). Lyotard’s analysis of the status of knowledge in the postmodern condition thus points toward a conclusion diametrically opposed to Habermas’ insistence on reconnecting the spheres of culture: in order to preserve the pursuit of truth, scientific knowledge production has to be kept separate from discussions of what ought to be done in the realm of politics. In the combined domain science/politics that appears in Postmodernity, efficiency amounts to allocating funding only to that research that promises to increase profit or augment power. Lyotard characterizes this principle of allocating funding as “terroristic”: “efficiency gained by eliminating or threatening to eliminate a player from the language game one shares with him” (PMC 63). Science becomes terroristic when it augments power by maximizing performativity — by funding some research and not others. For without funding a scientist is effectively eliminated from the conversation about what is “true.” More broadly, however, Lyotard’s term “terror” points to a kind of violence done to either the integrity of a discourse when its statements are evaluated according to criteria external to that discourse, or a kind of violence done to a domain when it is governed by a discourse not appropriate to the nature of the objects which populate it. In either case, the prospect of “terror” serves as a warning against obliterating the differences between domains and the discourses according to which those domains are regulated and understood. In Postmodernism and its Critics John McGowan argues that Lyotard believes “the way to disconnect scientific discoveries from lamentable purposes is not to tighten the restrictions on what scientists can study according to some generalized moral formula but to sever completely the connection between research and the other language games of nationalist politics, morality, and the economic exploitation of technological\n\n9781441125590_txt_print.indd 19\n\n9/6/11 9:30:00 AM\n\n20\n\nRobert Musil and the nonmodern\n\ninnovations” (183). It is to prevent the situation Lyotard names “terror” that he insists on keeping science separate from politics. This concern is the occasion for Lyotard’s famous formulation in The Postmodern Condition about the incommensurability of science on the one hand and nonscience (i.e., narrative) on the other: Both are composed of statements; the statements are “moves” made by the players within the framework of generally applicable rules; these are specific to each particular kind of knowledge, and the “moves” judged to be “good” in one cannot be of the same type as those judged to be “good” in another, unless it happens that way by chance. It is therefore impossible to judge the existence or validity of narrative knowledge on the basis of scientific knowledge and vice versa: the relevant criteria are different. (PMC 26) Lyotard’s thesis about incommensurability illuminates the fact that discourses in the domain of Culture (ethics and politics) are not capable of adjudicating questions pertaining to the domain of Nature (science) because the discourses are regulated by fundamentally different and incompatible sets of rules. Science is typically understood to be denotative discourse — description of the way the world is. Politics, however, necessarily involves statements about the way the world should be. That is, the latter is made up of prescriptive statements. It is on this basis Lyotard insists that legitimating science according to the rules of politics interferes with what should be the autonomous determination of what is “true.” Lyotard’s incommensurability thesis has implications beyond the question of how scientific statements are legitimated: separating discourses of science and politics creates significant difficulties for Modernity’s general effort to create normativity out of itself. When he turns his attention from the problem of the political legitimation of the scientific to consider the scientific legitimation of the political Lyotard acknowledges this very difficulty. In Just Gaming Lyotard argues that a science of politics — that is, a discourse of justice that begins with a universally valid description of the ideal polis — is not possible because no conception of the ideal polis could be universally valid. Recalling the argument in The Postmodern Condition about incommensurability, he points out “that there is in justice, insofar as it refers to prescriptions, and it necessarily does, a use of language that is fundamentally different from the theoretical use” (JG 24). Disconnecting questions of justice (political normativity) from questions of truth (science or epistemological normativity) means that “the question of justice cannot be resolved in terms of models,” because without an objective description of the ideal polis there is no clear set of criteria according to\n\n9781441125590_txt_print.indd 20\n\n9/6/11 9:30:00 AM\n\nThe thought figure of the nonmodern\n\n21\n\nwhich prescriptives could be evaluated and chosen. The result is that “one is without criteria, yet one must decide” (JG 17). In Chapter 6 I examine in more detail Lyotard’s strategies for enacting a politics decoupled from science: i.e., a mode of judgment without criteria. Here it is enough to recognize that when the political is decoupled from the scientific or the scientific from the political, one is left with only the possibility of judgment without criteria, which is sufficiently different from the project of Modernity to suggest that we are no longer in the modern. The opposition between modern (Habermas) and postmodern (Lyotard) responses to the problem of normativity can now be seen, in an admittedly schematic fashion, as a question regarding the relation between discourses of theoretic reason and practical reason or, alternatively, as a question about the appropriateness of discourses applied to specific domains. Combining them prevents the discourses from operating according to their own internal logics and, consequently, from accomplishing what they were specifically designed to accomplish. Separating them, however, impedes the determination of normativity. Paralleling both Habermas and Lyotard, Bruno Latour’s reading of Modernity also concerns the relations between discourses of science and those of politics. More specifically, Latour’s inaugural work in the field of science studies (roughly, the sociology of science) seeks to reconfigure the relations between these discourses in order to take fuller account of the interactions between the domains they seek to legislate. His book We Have Never Been Modern argues that contemporary understanding of science’s place in the social world continues to be haunted by the excesses of modernism — in particular, by the insistence on sharp ontological distinctions such as that between Nature on the one hand and Culture on the other. Critical of modernism and postmodernism alike, Latour seeks to articulate a third position: “nonmodernism.” Latour’s work in science studies characterizes the natural sciences as a set of intellectual and social practices, the general configuration of which has not substantially changed since the advent of “modern” science sometime in the seventeenth century. Latour uses the term “modernism” in quite a general and somewhat vague sense to refer to two sets of intellectual practices which must remain distinct if they are to remain effective: The first set of practices, by “translation,” creates mixtures between entirely new types of beings, hybrids of nature and culture. The second, by “purification,” creates two entirely distinct ontological zones: that of human beings on the one hand; that of nonhumans on the other. Without the first set, the practices of purification would be fruitless or pointless. Without the second, the work of translation would be slowed down, limited, or even ruled out. (Never Been Modern 10–11)\n\n9781441125590_txt_print.indd 21\n\n9/6/11 9:30:00 AM\n\n22\n\nRobert Musil and the nonmodern\n\nWhereas purification separates what was once regarded as an undifferentiated entity into distinguishable parts, “translation” or “mediation” integrates nonhuman entities with human interests. Mediation would, for example, “link in one continuous chain the chemistry of the upper atmosphere, scientific and industrial strategies, the preoccupations of heads of state, the anxieties of ecologists” in trying to understand the phenomenon of ozone depletion (Never Been Modern 11). As a further example, the domestication and later synthesis of certain bread molds for their antibiotic properties is perhaps one of the most successful instances in human medical science of a nonhuman entity being integrated into the human world. Conversely, purification would “establish a partition between a natural world that had always been there, a society with predictable and stable interests and stakes, and a discourse that is independent of both reference and society” (Never Been Modern 11). In what could well be the inaugural gesture of modernist purification itself, the Cartesian cogito renders a “mind-in-a-vat” disconnected from a “world-out-there,” such that “mind” and “world” mark reified domains of human subjects of Culture sharply divided from nonhuman objects in Nature. Modern philosophy, in the form of disembodied Reason, floats somewhere in between. Latour observes that both purification and mediation are necessary parts of the “modern constitution” (Never Been Modern 13–15). Without new purifications, mediation has to slow down or stop, because there is only a finite number of combinations possible among a finite set of elements. Conversely, without an interest in generating new combinations of elements, there is no point in continuing to purify existing entities into new parts. Latour’s critique of modernist purification and mediation points toward something like a deconstruction of the standoff between scientific realists and social constructivists, in the sense that it tries to work past a binary opposition that is itself arbitrary and unstable. Thus, on Latour’s modeling, Nature is not some antecedent reality waiting to be discovered by scientists ratcheting their way toward Truth one experiment at a time. Nor is it the purely discursive product of a set of signifying practices which some cultural theorists insist carve up reality in a wholly arbitrary way. To the latter Latour would say that you cannot make an electron do just anything you want simply by placing it in an alternative set of differential signs. To the former he would say that the only way you have any evidence of an electron as such or know anything of its properties is when you isolate it from more complex phenomena — that is, when you “socialize” it into the human world by letting/making it perform inside the human-made theater of a particle accelerator (Pandora’s Hope 194). Latour explains that the goal of his view is to avoid using the Nature-Culture/Object-Subject distinction at all. Thinking past these binary oppositions, an electron no longer appears as a discovered bit of\n\n9781441125590_txt_print.indd 22\n\n9/6/11 9:30:00 AM\n\nThe thought figure of the nonmodern\n\n23\n\nNature or as a constructed artifact of Culture but, rather, as what can be understood as having a hybrid ontology. This leads Latour to refer to such entities as “quasi-objects” — “quasi” in the sense that they are neither wholly objective nor subjective (Never Been Modern 51–5). This schema is the backbone of a narrative Latour develops about the invention of a modern worldview according to which humans are understood to be independent of and autonomous with respect to a nonhuman (super)natural world. According to Latour, prior to this distinction between the Cultural and the Natural, premoderns regarded the world as a continuous fabric woven from threads of humans and nonhumans in such a way that human interests were in unmediated contact with essential properties of nonhumans (Never Been Modern 38). One way to think of this premodern worldview is to see the human world as contiguous with the supernatural such that a range of interactions transpire between them, such as prayer attended by divine intervention or transgression resulting in retribution. Against this integrated view of the cosmos, modernism names the simultaneous generation of separated domains of human Culture on the one hand and nonhuman Nature on the other. The distinction implies that Nature transcends human control and that Culture is immanent to it. But the paradoxical opposites of both are equally true. Latour points out that because humans demonstrate the independence of natural phenomena from human control within the humanly constructed environment of the laboratory, Nature’s transcendence is actually a product of human mediation. Similarly, even though human Culture (human social institutions) is an entirely human construction, it nevertheless transcends human control, behaving more like transcendent Nature in the sense that no individual human or even small groups of humans can alter it at will. This paradox (simultaneously transcendent and immanent Nature together with simultaneously transcendent and immanent Culture) remains hidden as long as the work of mediation is occluded by the work of purification; that is, as long as people forget that a reified Nature beyond human control is actually a product of human interaction with nonhumans. Latour argues that modernism kept this paradox out of sight by officially identifying itself with purification while occluding the work of mediation. As Latour conceives it, modernist purification creates both human and nonhuman autonomy by separating the two into distinct ontological zones and increasing the distance between them. Latour argues that this autonomy gave humans increased daring to interact with the nonhuman world on an unprecedented scale, resulting in the proliferation of human/ nonhuman hybrids (Never Been Modern 41). The very advantage of scientific modernism is, in fact, the great number of human/nonhuman hybrids it produces, many of which provide significant benefits for human society. Not just the development of antibiotics but also selective cross-breeding to\n\n9781441125590_txt_print.indd 23\n\n9/6/11 9:30:00 AM\n\n24\n\nRobert Musil and the nonmodern\n\ndevelop disease resistance in crop plants, the generation and harnessing of electrical power, and, more recently, the advent of hydrogen fuel cells and other alternative fuels for automobiles to replace petroleum combustion engines represent hybrid products of scientific purification/ mediation. In order for this proliferation to continue, however, moderns must continue to believe that the unregulated proliferation of human/ nonhuman hybrids will have no negative cosmological consequences for the human world. It is the increasing incredibility of this belief (its demonstrated falseness) that occasions Latour’s sense of the urgency to rethink the intellectual practices of modernism. For in addition to products whose benefit is beyond doubt, modernist purification has also resulted in the human world becoming populated with human/nonhuman hybrids which modernist science cannot control because it continues to occlude the work of mediation. Atomic weapons provided perhaps the most dramatic occasion, according to Michel Serres, to rethink the unequivocal benefits of science (“Conversations on Science, Culture, and Time” 15). Genetic engineering, stem-cell research, trans-species organ transplantation and “designer” psychopharmacology are recent additions to a rapidly increasing list of hybrid “monsters” science has produced through its mediations with nature. Anthropogenic global climate change is simply the latest, though perhaps the scariest, such monster. Latour’s alternative to and remedy for the uncontrolled proliferation of hybrid monsters is to think the practices of purification together with those of mediation in order to recognize that human interaction with nonhumans can have irreversibly negative consequences for the human world. This amounts to reversing the modernist purification that generated the Nature/Culture distinction in the first place. Latour’s nonmodernism, then, is an attempt to de-reify that distinction, reconnecting mediation with purification in order to foreground the cosmological consequences of the hybrid monsters which modernism has allowed to proliferate. The thought figure of the nonmodern therefore signals the possibility of avoiding the aporia of connecting/disconnecting discourses of science from those of morality/justice. It represents a strategy of dereifying the discursive distinctions which are the basis of important confrontations between the modern and the postmodern responses to the problem of normativity. Ultimately, what Latour is advocating is circumspection regarding scientific knowledge: “we are going to have to slow down, reorient, and regulate the proliferation of monsters by representing their existence officially” (Never Been Modern 12). Regulation of hybrids might begin by reversing the separation of purification and mediation, but it entails more than that. It means, in effect, evaluating the products of science and assigning validity (citizenship in human society) to some and not\n\n9781441125590_txt_print.indd 24\n\n9/6/11 9:30:00 AM\n\nThe thought figure of the nonmodern\n\n25\n\nothers. This raises an important question Latour does not directly address: according to what procedure could the products of science be evaluated? Viewed from this angle, Latour’s critique of purification and his nonmodern alternative are involved in the philosophical discourse of Modernity understood as the problem of normativity as it applies to criteria of scientific products. Moreover, like Habermas and Lyotard, Latour’s intervention in the problem of normativity concerns the relations between the discourses of science and politics. Latour’s response, however, is neither Habermas’ advocacy of combining the discourses nor Lyotard’s insistence on separating them. Instead, he works toward de-reifying the very distinction between science and politics on the grounds that this distinction is itself an effect of modernist purification which gives rise to — and perpetuates — the problem. Like Lyotard, Latour dismisses knowledge for its own sake (Idealism) as an appropriate basis on which to legitimate scientific production: the very problem he wants to rectify is, after all, the tendency of modern science to conduct itself without regard for non-scientific concerns. Latour’s distance from the other metanarrative Lyotard discusses, emancipation (Socialism), is less clear. On the one hand, he opens Never Been Modern celebrating the fall of the Berlin Wall, an event he says signals the failure of Socialism which, “While seeking to abolish man’s exploitation of man . . . had magnified that exploitation immeasurably” (8). This is good evidence that Latour no longer himself believes in (Socialist) emancipation as a narrative capable of directing human societies. On the other hand, emancipation is, in some sense, exactly what Latour is seeking: not, however, emancipation from the human tyranny that Socialism meant to address, but emancipation from domination by human/nonhuman hybrid monsters and emancipation from the structurally flawed intellectual constitution of modernism. However, as Lyotard notes, the narrative of emancipation typically invokes an idea of the autonomy and inherent value of the human, though for Latour to do so would return him to one of the signal practices of modernism, namely some version of humanism as the purification and privileging of one human, cultural domain over others. Insofar as Latour holds at the very least an ambivalent attitude toward legitimation via reference to metanarratives, his critique of modernism parallels Lyotard’s, and there appears little difference between the nonmodern and the postmodern understood as interventions in Modernity’s problem of normativity. Despite these parallels, however, Latour criticizes postmodern attempts to separate science and politics as a perpetuation of modernist purification. He writes, somewhat hyperbolically, that he “has not found words ugly enough to designate this [postmodern] intellectual movement — or rather, this intellectual immobility through which humans and nonhumans are left to drift” (Never Been Modern 61). His antipathy toward the postmodern\n\n9781441125590_txt_print.indd 25\n\n9/6/11 9:30:00 AM\n\n26\n\nRobert Musil and the nonmodern\n\nis occasioned by the strategy which calls for keeping the discourses of the natural world separate from those of the human world. Latour says of postmodernism that it “lives under the modern Constitution, but it no longer believes in the guarantees the Constitution offers” (Never Been Modern 46): The postmoderns think they are still modern because they accept the total division between the material and technological world on the one hand and the linguistic play of speaking subjects on the other — thus forgetting [mediation]; or because they relish only in the hybrid character of free floating networks and collages — thus forgetting [purification]. But they are mistaken, because true moderns have always surreptitiously multiplied intermediaries in order to try to conceptualize the massive expansion of hybrids as well as their purification. (Never Been Modern 61–2) Latour’s argument against the postmodern is marked by three separate claims. First, Latour insists that postmodernism perpetuates modernist purification by accepting a division between the material world and the human world (Never Been Modern 64–5). In general, many figures associated with the term “postmodernism” do tend to be skeptical of attempts to bridge the gap between subject and object, especially by way of so-called representational knowledge in which the subject’s representation of the world is thought to accurately reflect an external state of affairs. One genealogy of this skepticism might trace it to Saussure’s observation in his Course in General Linguistics that there is only ever an arbitrary relation between signifier and referent and that different languages carve up the world using different categories, an observation which tends to relativize any (linguistic) representation of the world. Language, in this sense, cuts off humans irredeemably from the nonhuman world rather than connecting them reliably to it. A second, related, criticism Latour levels against postmodernism is that it perpetuates modernism’s purification by relishing only “the hybrid character of free floating networks” (Never Been Modern 61). The centrally important concept of “discourse” which, in much postmodernism, replaces representational knowledge, points to an understanding of language that matches what Latour seems to mean by a network. What the concept of discourse tries to capture is the constitutive function of language with respect to both subjects and objects. For example, in his inaugural lecture at the Collège de France titled “The Discourse on Language,” Michel Foucault points to the specific ways in which discourse is regulated in any particular historical epoch.1 The general point is that any understanding produced by a discourse (and all understanding is so produced) is relative\n\n9781441125590_txt_print.indd 26\n\n9/6/11 9:30:00 AM\n\nThe thought figure of the nonmodern\n\n27\n\nto the ways in which that discourse has been regulated with respect to what can be talked about in the discourse and what counts for a true statement, who is allowed speak within it, and where and when it takes places. This relativity pertains to objects in the natural world as well as to subjects in the cultural world. A primary focus of Foucault’s analysis of the regulation of discourse is on the human sciences, which invent or construct “the human” by interpreting what it means to be human. Part of viewing language as discourse means recognizing that signification is not one-sidedly determined by either subjects or objects — subjects being themselves objects of discourse, as in the case of the humanities and the human sciences. There is, additionally, a recursive effect or feed-back loop at work here by which a subject’s self-understanding, itself a product of discourse, shapes how he or she understands all the other things in the world. Along these lines, Latour contends that the effect of the so-called linguistic turn (the moment in intellectual history when language becomes the primary analytic category according to which problems are treated) “is to make discourse not a transparent intermediary that would put human subjects in contact with the natural world, but a mediator independent of nature and society alike” (Never Been Modern 62). There is, then, (some) justification for saying that (some) postmoderns “relish only in the hybrid character of free floating networks” in the sense of understanding linguistic representations of the world to be determined neither wholly by referents nor wholly by speaking subjects, both being at least partially configured by the operations of discourse. Against this feature of the postmodern, Latour is dismissive of the tendency to relish in free-floating networks because a network connected firmly to neither the natural nor the cultural domain prevents the very linkage between the natural and the human entailed by the goal of regulating scientific production: it prevents the very mediation Latour seeks to re-establish between the human and the nonhuman. Latour’s third criticism of postmodernism is that, although it lives under the modern Constitution, it no longer believes in what that Constitution guarantees. Living under the modern Constitution means accepting the separation of the natural world from the cultural world. We have already seen the senses in which postmodernism separates the human and nonhuman in, for example, a skepticism toward representational knowledge and a consequent appeal to discourse. Believing in what the Constitution guarantees means believing in the project it makes possible. Although the moderns accept the separation of the human and the nonhuman, they surreptitiously allow hybrids to proliferate. Human manipulation of nature was, after all, the specific possibility unleashed by sharply dividing humans from the nonhuman (i.e., supernatural) world. This freedom to experiment with nature, then, is central to what the\n\n9781441125590_txt_print.indd 27\n\n9/6/11 9:30:00 AM\n\n28\n\nRobert Musil and the nonmodern\n\nmodern Constitution allows. Lyotard’s thesis about incommensurability as well as skepticism regarding representational knowledge suggests a decoupling of the human from the nonhuman that inhibits or at least complicates passage between the two that is the basis of Modernity’s experimentation with Nature. More broadly, one central feature of the project of Modernity — conspicuously continued in the postmodern — is emancipation. This is famously signaled in Kant’s essay, “What is Called ‘Enlightenment’?”, for which question he furnished “independence” as the answer.2 This emancipation is not limited to achieving freedom from the nonhuman (super)natural world, which effort Horkheimer and Adorno refer to as “the disenchantment of the world; the dissolution of myths and the substitution of knowledge for fancy” (Dialectic of Enlightenment 3). Modernity’s goal of freedom is also directed against human forms of enslavement, of which Marxism’s effort to unmask false consciousness on the basis of a scientific analysis of culture is a prime example.3 Similarly, many versions of postmodernism are similarly engaged in unmasking the arbitrariness of the operations by which various cultural formations (categories of gender, race, versions of “knowledge”) come into being. Unmasking arbitrary forms of domination describes pretty well the goal of Foucault’s archeology and genealogy. Similarly, unmasking characterizes many of the uses to which Derrida’s deconstruction of Western philosophy has been put; for example, in the service of postcolonial theory and queer theory. On Latour’s reckoning, demystification, unmasking, or critique is made possible precisely by a separation of the human from the nonhuman: Solidly grounded in the transcendental certainty of nature’s laws, the modern man or woman can criticize and unveil, denounce and express indignation at irrational beliefs and unjustified dominations. Solidly grounded in the certainty that humans make their own destiny, the modern man or woman can criticize and unveil, express indignation at and denounce irrational beliefs, the biases of ideologies, and the unjustified domination of the experts who claim to have staked out the limits of action and freedom. (Never Been Modern 36) Drawing on knowledge of the way the world “really is” — which is in turn grounded on the assumption that the world has an objective shape independent of humans — allows science a vantage point in “reality” from which to adjudicate claims to truth. Similarly, drawing on the fact that human society is an entirely human construction, much cultural critique seeks to unveil as entirely human the operations which configure — and enslave — humans in categories of race, gender, and nationality for example. Conversely, allowing human society to be even partially\n\n9781441125590_txt_print.indd 28\n\n9/6/11 9:30:00 AM\n\nThe thought figure of the nonmodern\n\n29\n\ngoverned by natural forces beyond human control would significantly restrict the scope of liberation made possible by activities of unveiling. Modern efforts to denounce or critique frequently presume the possibility of access to objective criteria beyond human manipulation and therefore ultimately rest on a separation of the human from the nonhuman. Critical efforts associated with the postmodern, however, tend to reject not only unmediated access to the nonhuman but the very claim to absolute foundations of any kind, regarding all such forms of human understanding as products of more or less arbitrary ways of using language. For example, Derrida’s account of logocentrism makes a case that, from its inception in Descartes all the way to Husserl, Western philosophy’s repeated quests for absolute grounding is doomed to failure because the logos is never entirely located in one place — never centric — but always subject to a deferral and displacement, always inscribed by différance. Nothing is outside the network of differences Derrida terms “texte.”4 Latour observes, however, that denying movement cross the gap separating humans and nonhumans precludes the possibility of unmasking or critique because it prevents claiming a position outside human discourse from which to denounce some representations as false. Although the impossibility of a transcendent view tends to be a common feature of versions of the postmodern, those who deny the possibility tend to accept the epistemological and axiological fall-out. So, for example, Lyotard insists that the incommensurability of language games which precludes judging statements in one language game according to the rules of another saddles us with the limitation that “All we can do is stare in wonderment at the diversity of discursive species” (PMC 26). Latour is much less comfortable than Lyotard with this limitation because it precludes the very thing he is attempting to accomplish: the regulation of scientific production that fails to consider non-scientific concerns. 5 Of broader significance for deploying the example of the nonmodern within the philosophical discourse of Modernity, Latour’s thesis about the persistence of purification in the postmodern points to the way it structurally impedes attempts to engage in critique and therefore to establish normativity. The general force of Latour ’s reading of postmodernism can be summarized in the following way. He views versions of postmodernism as perpetuating modernist purification in insisting on the separation of discourses of the natural world from those of the human world. For Latour these versions of the postmodern establish something like an autonomous sphere of discourse without fixed grounding in either Nature or Culture. In either case, the consequence is that postmodernism’s modernism precludes the linkages between discourses that seem to be necessary to the effort to create normativity without reference to transcendental authority or models supplied by the past. Simply linking the discourse of natural\n\n9781441125590_txt_print.indd 29\n\n9/6/11 9:30:00 AM\n\n30\n\nRobert Musil and the nonmodern\n\nworld with those of the cultural world, however, precipitates the problem Lyotard terms “terror.” One measure of a successful intervention in the problematics of normativity would be to avoid this paradox. The thought figure of the nonmodern suggests what such an intervention might attempt: namely a reversal of the practices of purification by which Modernity grounded itself and which have been perpetuated in many postmodern attempts to overcome that grounding. Additionally, Latour’s example shows us that a reversal of purification might be carried out by de-reifying the oppositions which Modernity institutes and postmodernism reifies in keeping them apart. This operation of nonmodern dereification is on display in Latour’s attention to the question of the horizon within which Western scientific rationality is allowed to operate and therefore, by extension, the question of the very limits of Western scientific rationality and the Western episte¯me¯. One early site at which the scope of scientific rationality was fought is the battle in The Gorgias between Socrates and Callicles.6 The debate between Socrates and Callicles is commonly understood to be between Right and Might (reason and force) as the best means for disciplining the unruly, unreasonable multitude of the polis. While Callicles holds that force is justified and Socrates insists that reason is more appropriate, Latour contends that there is in fact little that distinguishes their positions when they are viewed against the democratic claims of the people of Athens: “Socrates’[s] invocation of reason against the unreasonable people is actually patterned on Callicles’ request for ‘an unequal share of power’” (Pandora’s Hope 219). Latour points out that Callicles’ invocation of Might amounts to an elitist and specialized expertise: “Yes, that’s what I mean. In my opinion, that’s what natural right is — for an individual who is better (that is more clever) to rule over second-rate people and to have more than them” (Plato quoted in Latour, Pandora’s Hope 223). According to Latour, Socrates’ own solution is not technically different, which becomes apparent when he challenges another of his interlocutors in the Gorgias, Polus: The trouble, Polus, is that you are trying to use on me the kind of rhetorical refutation which people in the lawcourts think is successful. There too, you see, people think they’re proving the other side wrong if they produce a large number of eminent witnesses in support of the points they’re maki"
