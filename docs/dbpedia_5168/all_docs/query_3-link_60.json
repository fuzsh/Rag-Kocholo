Ash\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn his contribution to the volume Rethinking Vienna 1900 (2001) and in more detail in a Vienna conference paper presented in 2004, Steven Beller pointed to a number of important developments in the sciences other than psychoanalysis that should be considered part of ‘Vienna modernism’, but have remained understudied by cultural historians.1 Since then, historians of science have taken significant steps toward addressing the multiple linkages between the sciences and Vienna modernism. To give only a few examples: work on Robert Musil has emphasised the central role of scientific modernism and Musil’s own training as a scientist and engineer for his thinking and writing.2 Veronica Hofer, Cheryl Logan and others have placed the transformation of biology into an experimental science at the ‘Vivarium’ laboratory, located in the Prater, in the context of Vienna modernism. The work of ‘Vivarium’ researchers Eugen Steinach (on surgically induced sexual transformations in animals) and of Paul Kammerer (on the supposed inheritance of acquired characteristics in amphibians) attracted considerable media attention – much of it scandalous. The central idea behind that work, the malleability of living things, meshed well with the culture of creation central to modernism.3\n\nIn her book Trafficking Materials and Gendered Experimental Practices: Radium Research in Early Twentieth-Century Vienna, Maria Rentetzi presents a study of radium research in Vienna, the first, and for many years the only, field in the so-called ‘hard’ natural sciences with significant numbers of female participants.4 While focussing on cultures of experimentation in the new field, Rentetzi also integrates the architecture of the Radium Institute, founded in 1910, and the multiple interactions of its researchers with the city into her analysis. In this case (like the better-known ones of Lou Andreas-Salomé or Bertha Pappenheim), women’s roles in Vienna modernity clearly went beyond those of muse, femme fatale, Salondame, or neurotic patient, that have become standard in the literature.\n\nArchitectural historian Leslie Topp has published studies of the overall design and building ensemble of the ‘Lower Austrian Healing and Care Institution am Steinhof’, an asylum for the mentally ill opened in 1907, focussing on but going well beyond the well-known and still highly visible chapel building designed by Otto Wagner.5 Building in part on Topp’s work, Sophie Ledebur has now shown in detail that the asylum itself, the largest such facility in Europe at that time, was presented as an embodiment of ‘modern’ psychiatry not only because of its size, design and architecture, but also as an independent ‘space of knowledge’ with a comprehensive approach to the management of mental health knowledge and treatment that could only be realised in a location separate from the university’s psychiatric clinic and removed from the city centre.6 As she writes, citing Topp, the institution’s modernity actually lay in the ambiguity of its own goals:\n\nThe established trope of the asylum-as-utopia, gaining its power from its separateness and rejection of the world beyond its walls, and the newer rhetoric of the open, friendly mental hospital existed in unresolved tension in the discourse of early-twentieth-century planners, including the psychiatrists and government officials who planned Steinhof. Otto Wagner’s brand of modernism thrived not on tension but on glorious resolution; it filtered out the ambiguity of the asylum planners’ goals and focused exclusively on their utopian ambitions.7\n\nVienna‘s modern asylum, in Ledebur’s view, thus embodied a ‘heterotopia’ in the sense elaborated by Michel Foucault – a spatial ‘other’, physically and ideally distinct from its illness-inducing urban surroundings, incorporating ‘organised freedom’ within its ostensibly perfect ‘interior order’.8\n\nIn her recent studies of medicine, culture and politics in nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Vienna, Tatjana Buklijas shows that the iconoclastic artists of Vienna 1900 took inspiration from nature and transformed natural motifs into abstract decorative forms. To give only one example: the right corner of Gustav Klimt’s famous painting Danaë, depicting the mythical moment when Zeus in the shape of golden rain surreptitiously impregnated the princess of Argos and Eurydice, is scattered with the shapes of a blastocyst (Figure 1.1).\n\nPrivately held. Detail.\n\nThis early embryonic structure, first described in humans in 1895, was still a novelty at that time; Klimt must have seen it in embryological literature or, more likely, attending Emil Zuckerkandl’s anatomical lectures for artists in the summer of 1903.9 Here, as in the case of the asylum ‘am Steinhof’, innovations in medical science and in the arts appear to have gone hand in hand.\n\nIn Vienna in the Age of Uncertainty: Science, Liberalism and Private Life (2007), Deborah Coen goes still further and challenges Carl Schorske’s classical interpretation of fin-de-siècle Vienna directly.10 Vienna modernism, in her view, was not only a descent into the irrational following the crisis of liberalism. Rather, the probabilistic worldview characteristic of modern physics in Austria was itself an expression of the liberal culture propagated and transmitted by several generations of a single family – the Exners. In characterising the work of Franz Seraphim Exner, professor of physics and physical chemistry and head of the ‘Second Physical Institute’ at the University of Vienna from 1902 to 1920, Coen draws in part upon work by historian and philosopher of science Michael Stöltzner on what he calls ‘Vienna indeterminism’.11\n\nAll of these studies show that natural scientists clearly deserve to be included, not only as a sideshow to but rather as integral participants in ‘Vienna 1900’. At the very least they demonstrate direct personal contact and networking among scientists and artists. This in itself is hardly surprising, given the small number of highly educated people involved. But the point goes beyond ‘me too’ historiography or anecdotal linkages, and in some cases at least appears to encompass substantive commonalities as well. In this chapter, I present an exploratory effort to advance this discussion – or at least to ask what scientific and artistic modernism may have had in common.\n\nModernism in the sciences\n\nIt is hardly possible to engage in such an effort without at least trying to define modernism. The collective singular noun ‘modernism’ (die Moderne in German) is the established property of the humanities and refers to developments in literature, music, the visual arts and architecture. Yet it is equally established usage to speak also of modern physics, mathematics, chemistry or biology. The term ‘modern’ can hardly mean the same thing in all of these contexts. As Ruth Oldenziel reminds us in her contribution to this volume, what it meant to be modern has been contested and is unstable in many fields, from the arts to lifestyle choices.12 As I will show, the term ‘modern’ also has multiple, contested meanings within the sciences.13\n\nMy intention here is twofold. I wish to argue, first, that there are certain affinities, and in some cases actual linkages, between the breakthrough to modern ways of thinking in the natural sciences and mathematics and the radical changes in the arts which occurred at the same time. I argue, second, that modernism, and hence cultural modernity, in all of these fields was nonetheless fundamentally plural and not the ‘totalising project’ that postmodernist thinkers have claimed that it was.\n\nModernism as an intellectual style in many sciences, as in many of the arts, involved a break with direct, supposedly pictorial representation of nature and a turn towards giving free play to abstraction and theoretical imagination. In order to characterise the affinities involved in at least a preliminary way, I propose to extend a line of interpretation suggested some years ago by historian of mathematics Herbert Mehrtens, and speak here of the breakthrough to ‘modern’ thinking, at least in part, as an emancipation of self-referential symbol systems from representationalism or classical formalistic conventions, giving free play to abstraction and theoretical imagination.14 Alongside this style of modernistic thinking, Mehrtens places technological or technocratic modernism.15 This presupposes a concept of knowledge based less on self-referential abstraction than on what can be done with, or to, nature as well as other human beings, exemplified most clearly in the case of eugenics as a form of biological politics, in the efforts to establish the malleability of living things in the laboratory mentioned above, in the re-conceptualisation of substances in human bodies such as hormones, vitamins and enzymes as effective causal agents (Wirkstoffe) that could be synthesised artificially in the laboratory, and in the re-conceptualisation of social science that took society itself as an object that could and should be acted upon by science-based policy, later termed social engineering.16 As will be shown, these two styles of modernism in science were not fundamentally opposed, but in certain respects deeply related to one another. It should be evident that I am speaking here of ideal types, examples of which may or may not exist in actual science. Moreover, such developments must be seen in the much broader context established by the technological transformations that have been formative of modernity itself. I will return to the latter point in the conclusion.\n\nThe plurality of modernism in the sciences and culture of ‘Vienna 1900’ might best be illustrated with the aid of some examples. In the following I will discuss three cases, two from physics (the work of Ernst Mach and Ludwig Boltzmann) and one from music (Arnold Schoenberg). In each case, I will try to bring out basic features that link the cases in question to one or another of the definitions of modernity as a style of thought just sketched.17\n\nThe first two cases are from physical science, and focus not on Einstein or relativity,18 which of course were created elsewhere, but rather on the debate between Ernst Mach and Ludwig Boltzmann on the status of mathematical, and particularly statistical, models in physics, which constituted an important part of the background to the reception of relativity theory and quantum mechanics.\n\nErnst Mach – modernism as anti-metaphysics\n\nErnst Mach – a physiologist, psychophysicist and experimental physicist – was professor of ‘philosophy, with emphasis on the history and theory of the inductive sciences’ in Vienna from 1895 to 1901.19 Students of Vienna modernism are familiar with the famous, often reproduced image in Mach’s The Analysis of Sensations showing a reclining man with a (half visible) moustache holding a pencil, which Mach used to show that we cannot entirely perceive our own bodies (Figure 1.2).\n\nFrom this point Mach went on to make the claim, widely cited at the time, that ‘the ego cannot be saved’ (in the original: Das Ich ist unrettbar), because such an entity ‘is not a definite, unalterable, sharply-bounded unity’ in our sensations; rather, it is no more than a convenient fiction, ‘an ideal mental-economical’ abstraction inferred from and then imposed upon sensations.20 Mach’s fundamental claim is that we cannot know the external world directly, but only our sensations. His claim about the ego is an extension of this primary claim to our knowledge of ourselves. On the wider implications and impact of this ‘antimetaphysical’ claim, cultural historian Philip Blom writes: ‘Mach simply threw overboard the constant ego as the midpoint and fulcrum of life experience and presented a conception of personality that could be understood as a pendant to the emptiness at the heart of the Danube monarchy.’21 The Austrian essayist Hermann Bahr presented Mach’s idea to a wider public in his famous text, ‘The unsalvageable ego’ (Das unrettbare Ich) in 1903, declaring it to be no less than ‘the philosophy of (literary) impressionism.’22\n\nIn a major historical work on the foundations of mechanics, Mach presented the development of mechanics as a story of evolutionary progress from the ‘practical mechanics’ of the great pyramids in Egypt to Newton, Leibniz, and beyond, in which the history of physics and that of human technology intertwined. Specifically, he argued that mechanics developed into a science only when repeated use of handcrafted tools extended the capacity of the senses and eventually drove the intellect to a higher level:\n\nThe doctrines of mechanics have developed out of the collected experiences of handcraft by an intellectual process of refinement … The simple machines – the five mechanical powers – are without question a product of handcraft … The making of rollers (for example) must have gained a great technical importance and have led to the discovery of the lathe. In possession of this, mankind easily discovered the wheel, the wheel and axle, and the pulley.23\n\nIn a famous essay entitled ‘The Economical Nature of Physical Inquiry’, Mach argued further that mathematical formulations, too, are no more than convenient tools to summarise sense impressions or laboratory observations.24 He did not deny the importance of hypotheses or thought-experiments, like those of Galileo and Newton, as aids to discovery, but he opposed going any further beyond direct observation and measurement than necessary, a standpoint characterised at the time as ‘phenomenological’. Thus, he argued, for example, that because we experience the external world as a continuum, we should imagine underlying physical reality as consisting of continuities, not particles. Mach opposed physical atomism in part because there was as yet no direct observational evidence of the existence of any such hard, massy, bounded bodies as ultimate components of matter. Finally, Mach argued, using Darwinist imagery, that following simple rules of theoretical self-restraint yields advantages in the struggle for existence, by which he meant competition in science itself.\n\nPopular Scientific Lectures (1898), p. 324, fig. 53.\n\nIt is important to note here that for Mach sense impressions were plainly not limited to what the naked eye can see and the unaided ear can hear. Examples of what he did mean are the photographs of projectiles he made with Peter Salcher and first published in 1887 (Figure 1.3).25\n\nThe avowed aim of this study, according to Mach, was to ‘make the process perceivable’ – in this case to capture photographically the pressure waves caused by the movement of an object through air at high speed.26 The similarity of these photos to those in Eadweard Muybridge’s widely known movement studies seems obvious, and it was not accidental. Mach later defined the aim of the recording apparatus in general as the ‘thickening of immediate perception’ (Verdichtung der Anschauung).27 To put it in a nutshell, for Mach the term ‘sense impressions’ included extensions of ordinary sensation by means of technology; in this respect his work continues a tradition that extends backward at least to Galileo’s telescope. The apparent difference between how things appeared to the unaided senses and these technologically produced images was, in Mach’s view, merely quantitative, despite the extraordinary difficulties he encountered when he attempted to create such images.\n\nThus, if Mach was a modernist – and he surely was – then he does not exemplify either of the ideal types sketched above precisely. As shown at the beginning of this section, the central element of Mach’s modernism was his antimetaphysics, the effort to overcome traditional, but in his eyes meaningless, concepts. Though he certainly acknowledged that mathematical symbol systems had their uses in physics, he thought that they should be understood only as functional summaries of data from sense impressions, not as self-referential abstractions from these. The photos just described have been cited as examples of what Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison have termed ‘mechanical objectivity’.28 Yet such uses of technology and media as instruments of scientific discovery do not mean that Mach believed that nature or human beings were or ought to be entirely malleable in the sense of Mehrtens’ technocratic modernism. Rather, Mach thought that science emerged historically from human technological activity.\n\nLudwig Boltzmann – ‘the independence of mathematical theory’\n\nA primary opponent of Mach on these issues was Ludwig Boltzmann, professor of theoretical physics in Vienna from 1894 to 1900, and again from 1902 to his death in 1906.29 In contrast to the polymath Mach, Boltzmann stood for the institutionalisation of theoretical physics as an independent field of inquiry. Boltzmann consistently advocated the independent status of mathematical models in physics, asserting that their importance went far beyond the mere summation of measurement data. In an encyclopedia article on mathematical and physical models, apparatus and instruments, he called such models ‘instruments’ and acknowledged that the ‘need to save labor’ was an important reason for their use.30 But he scornfully compared Mach’s Darwinist ‘economy of thought’ with the businessman’s need to save time and money. The real purpose of mathematical models, in his view, was ‘the need to make results of calculation observable [anschaulich]’; elsewhere in the same text he used the term ‘sensorisation’ (Versinnlichung).31\n\nBy terms such as anschaulich and Versinnlichung Boltzmann clearly meant something quite different from Mach’s sense impressions. Boltzmann meant to give priority to theory, not observation, and to argue that the former guided the latter, not the other way around. Ever since the time of the great Paris mathematicians, he wrote, ‘one has conceived matter as a sum of mathematical points’, not as a continuum. Atomism thus became a practical necessity for doing physics at all, quite independent of the observability of atoms:\n\nOne does not believe, however, that one has really created a clear concept of what a continuum is merely by employing the word, continuum, and writing out a differential equation! On closer examination the differential equation is only the expression for the fact that one must begin with a finite number.32\n\nThe labour involved was not the convenient summary of sense impressions, but the development of ‘mental images’ (Gedankenbilder); indeed, Boltzmann argued that broad collections of facts (umfassende Tatsachengebiete) could never be described directly, but could only be depicted by such Gedankenbilder – that is, by mathematical equations.33 Though he spoke of images, representation and Versinnlichung, Boltzmann plainly did not mean any analogy to photographic imagery. Rather, theories are symbol systems that stand on their own and are testable only as wholes; they are images of nature only in a very abstract sense. Boltzmann nonetheless calls them ‘instruments’ and emphasises that they are not entirely self-referential, but rather subject to experimental testing.\n\nBoltzmann’s emphasis on the independence of mathematical theory and on abstract, theoretical rather than photographic pictures of nature has come to be regarded as central to the modern standpoint in physics. It is important to note, however, that the synthesis of theoretical physics with high technology in the form of the atomic bomb was hardly dreamed of by anyone involved at the time. Thus, the turn-of-the-century positions I have outlined are two versions of the ‘modern’ in physics. The two styles of thinking lived alongside one another at first and could even become competitors, but it was also possible to blend them.\n\nArnold Schoenberg – modernism in music, or: formalism as techno-scientific style\n\nWhat relevance, if any, has any of this to modernity in music? Though I am not a musicologist, perhaps I may be allowed to note some suggestive references in the writings of Arnold Schoenberg that may provide starting points for discussion. In ‘Composition in Twelve Tones’, for example, Schoenberg speaks of the ‘emancipation of dissonance’ and explicitly rejects the designation ‘atonal’ as a description of his system, speaking instead of a ‘system of components relating only to one another’.34 Specifically, he described the twelve-tone method in terms of mirrored notes similar to the abstraction of mirrored numbers, as shown in Figure 1.4.\n\nStyle and Idea (1984), pp. 224–225. Used by permission of Belmont Music Publishers, Los Angeles.\n\nSuch remarks appear to place this particularly formalistic version of modern music squarely in the camp of modernism as the emancipation of self-referential symbol systems. Caution is needed here, since one might well say that musical notation itself is a self-referential symbol system. Nonetheless, Schoenberg’s willfully austere twelve-tone approach is clearly more abstract than the highly evocative, definitely referential texts Richard Strauss and Gustav Mahler, as well as Schoenberg himself in his early works, attached to their tone poems.\n\nCare is needed for another reason: Schoenberg refers to non-Euclidean geometry only occasionally and vaguely, whereas his references to Mach’s phenomenological and evolutionary conception of physics are more frequent and precise, though he does not mention Mach by name. He constantly wrote of the development of musical ideas from lower to higher stages and regarded his own twelve-tone system as a result of gradual evolutionary development. Still more interesting in this regard are Schoenberg’s frequent references in the Theory of Harmony to the psychological effects of tones and chords.35\n\nThough Schoenberg was not a trained scientist, such discussions show a familiarity with the work of the physiologist and physicist Hermann Helmholtz and the philosopher and psychologist Carl Stumpf on the psychology of hearing.36 Mach, too, worked on these subjects. There is no evidence that Schoenberg met Mach in Vienna, but he certainly knew two people who had done so: Guido Adler and David Joseph Bach. Bach, one of the formative influences in Schoenberg’s youth by his own account, was a doctoral student of Mach and Friedrich Jodl in Vienna.37 There is an intriguing similarity between this diagram of Mach’s, showing differences between pure and tempered tuning that would remain on a circular keyboard (Figure 1.5) and the following two diagrams by Schoenberg (Figures 1.6a, 1.6b).\n\nEinleitung in die Helmholtzsche Musiktheorie (1885), Appendix.\n\nFigure 1.6a, a design for Berlin streetcar tickets, shows Schoenberg as a craftsman. Figure 1.6b depicts Schoenberg’s ‘twelve-tone disc’ (Zwölftondrehscheibe), a ‘tool’, as he called it, for generating twelve-tone series.\n\nI do not claim that Schoenberg ‘borrowed’ his design from Mach. Rather, the issue is the way in which they embodied figuratively their shared belief in the evolution of ‘higher’ creative forms from handcrafted work. Situated within the argument advanced here, both diagrams exemplify syntheses of formalist and technological modernity.\n\nCourtesy of the Arnold Schoenberg Center, Vienna.

The distinction is useful to help us grasp the complexity of scientific modernism, but the three case studies from Vienna in this chapter show that in practice various styles of modernism mingled with one another in interesting ways. Ernst Mach’s neo-positivistic effort to overcoming metaphysics in science and philosophy and to reconstruct both on the basis of ‘sense impressions’ relied in part on using technology and new media to extend the accessibility of physical processes to the senses. In this respect, his work marks a transition from traditional representationalism to modernism. Ludwig Boltzmann’s probabilistic physics comes closest to exemplifying the emancipation of abstract symbol systems, yet he regarded mathematics as a tool for constructing symbol systems that he considered to be empirically testable in principle. Finally, Arnold Schoenberg’s case represents the use of a technological style in the service of constructing a self-referential symbol system in music.\n\nLet me close by returning to another remark made in the introduction that hints at a broader interpretation for these and other examples of scientific modernism. The common context for the breakthroughs to modern styles of thought in both the sciences and the arts at the turn of the century is the technological transformation of the lived world resulting from the second industrial revolution. Central to that transformation are the abolition of the distinction between day and night by gas and then electric lighting, and the opening of the cities to the countryside and suburbs by means of horse-drawn, then electric street cars and later the automobile.38 Both developments mark the emergence of the city as an artificial universe of sound and light, seemingly emancipated from any direct dependence on nature and its rhythms – a nature that was itself being transformed by the encroachment of the city. Already here, in these transformations of the lived world, we see again how difficult it is to separate the emancipation of self-referential symbol systems from technocratic modernity. Indeed, we could suggest that the metropolis itself was becoming a large, increasingly self-referential technical system around 1900.39\n\nNotes"
