        "text": "Emotions are multifaceted and constitute perhaps the most complex mental phenomena. The topic of the emotions, Rene Descartes said, does not seem to be one of the more difficult to investigate, since everyone feels emotions, and so we have no need to look far to observe and establish their nature. Nevertheless, Descartes thought that previous writings about this topic were so confused that rather than relying on them, he made a conscious decision to write about emotions as if he were examining a topic with which no one had previously dealt. Descartes' approach to this topic expresses two seemingly conflicting aspects of emotions: simplicity and complexity. The simplicity of emotions appears to be evident, as Descartes noted, in the fact that people feel them firsthand and need not look elsewhere to be aware of them. The complexity of emotions is illustrated in the ambiguity in previous writings on the topic, a fact that deterred Descartes from relying on them. The simple and complex aspects of emotions relate to the claim that emotions are Janus-faced, revealing something about the world and about ourselves. Accordingly, we might discern two kinds of truths in emotions; one is about the self and the other about the world (de Sousa, 2007/2017). Each of us has direct, and often, privileged, access to the former kind of information, so attaining this information seems to be simple; revealing the information on the latter type is complex and requires profound, intricate intellectual deliberations. In light of this duality, discussion on emotions can profit, as indeed is the case with the articles presented in this special issue, from various commonsense sources, such as conversations with lay people, novels and other aesthetic forms, popular culture, and other everyday sources, none of which were created with the aim of investigating or understanding the emotions. References to these sources is not intended to provide any conclusive proof for the arguments, as such a proof needs also be based on\n\nThe Austrian writer Robert Musil (1880-1942) studied philosophy and psy- chology at the Humboldt-University in Berlin (1903-1908) and was a student of Carl Stumpf. With him also studied future gestalt-psychologists. The intellectual impulses he received at this time had a determining influence on his thinking and on his way of understanding knowledge and literature. The present paper attempts a reconstruction of how Musil tried to transpose psychological theories on the Ego and on human feel- ings, which Stumpf discussed with his students, into a narrative structure. This will be achieved through an analysis of Musil’s novellas “The Temptation of Quiet Veronika” (Die Versuchung der stillen Veronika) and “The Perfecting of Love” (Die Vollendung der Liebe), which were published in 1911 in the collection “Unions” (Vereinigungen). The aim is to show how Musilʼs conception of literature as a particular dimension of “non-ratioïd” knowledge was developed during his studies in Berlin and is closely connected with the theories Stumpf presented to his students, above all, with his theo- ry of emotions."
