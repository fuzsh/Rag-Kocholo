        "text": "Post by britneyrules on\n\nFall Out Boy's Pete Wentz Asks Killers Singer On Dinner Date\n\n04.21.2006 6:00 AM EDT\n\nBand to start new record in June, which bassist hopes will feature My Chemical Romance, Taking Back Sunday.\n\nIf you want proof of Pete Wentz's growing maturity (and his incredible sense of self-promotion), just ask him about his labelmate, onetime verbal punching bag and, perhaps, future dinner guest --- Killers frontman Brandon Flowers.\n\n\"The whole thing has never been like, 'Meet me at the bike racks after school!' And since the whole [feud] started, we've had a whole bunch of near-misses, where we'll show up at a party after he left or something like that,\" Wentz laughed. \"So now I'd just like to make peace. I'd like to go out to dinner with Brandon, because I think he'd be an interesting dude to eat with. But I don't think he would go out to dinner with me. We'll go to Nobu or something like that. I'll get the rock shrimp, some California rolls, perhaps a little spicy tuna.\"\n\nWhether or not Flowers accepts the invite remains to be seen (especially since the Killers are currently holed up in a Las Vegas studio working on their next album), but you can't blame Wentz for wanting to end the long-running feud (see \"Killers Get More Beef --- This Time With Fall Out Boy\"). After all, he's got more important things on his mind.\n\n\"We're going to finish this [Black Clouds and Underdogs Tour], head to the U.K, and then start recording the new record on June 7. We're doing it in L.A. again. Neal Avron is going to be at the helm for eight or nine songs, and then Babyface will do three songs,\" Wentz said. \"We've got 14 or 15 songs to bring into the studio, and we're going to look to have the thing in stores in late fall/ early winter.\"\n\nWentz said that tapping Babyface to produce the album (see \"Fall Out Boy Want Babyface To Produce Their Next Album\") isn't the only thing that's going to tick off their many detractors. Turns out the album is shaping up to be a scene-dissing semi-concept record (song titles include \"They Make Plans, We Make History\" and \"Gay Is Not a Synonym for Sh---y\"), though he's keeping that concept under wraps. He did hint that the title of the album will explain everything.\n\n\"I can't tell you the title yet, but it's gonna further polarize people. You're going to either love it or hate it, because it's a commentary on the scene. It's more conceptual than the last one,\" Wentz said. \"People ask me if I'm worried it's going to be too reactionary, but I think some of the best songs ever written have been reactionary, like [Neil Young's] 'Southern Man' to Bob Dylan's stuff, they were reactionary and amazing.\"\n\nWentz is careful to point out that the new album isn't going to be all dissing --- there's also a fair amount of kissing, courtesy of some \"real honest love songs.\" He also promises that the record will have plenty of guest stars, including (he hopes) members of My Chemical Romance and Taking Back Sunday, plus \"a rapper who will not actually be rapping.\"\n\nIn the meantime, he's also looking to address the nagging issue of the now-infamous Sidekick photos of his, um, Peter Wentz, which leaked onto the Internet last month (see \"Fall Out Boy's Pete Wentz Comments On ... You Know, Those Photos\"). But he's not thinking of posting another blog entry or filing a lawsuit. He's planning on taking even more photos.\n\n\"I think the whole thing is pretty hilarious. And I've got something even better planned, just to poke fun at myself and the whole situation,\" he laughed. \"We're shooting it today. A friend is shooting it, but he's a professional photographer, so there's going to be lights and all that. We're going to do it all in the same room at my parents' house, and it's going to be exactly the same, but this time there will be something else covering my, uh, area.\"\n\n--- James Montgomery\n\nSource: www.mtv.com/news/articles/1529146/20060420/fall_out_boy.jhtml?headlines=true\n\nPost by Diablo Cody™ on\n\n*Scene from \"A Little Less Then 16 Inches, A Lot More f**k Me\".*\n\nBrandon and Pete are enjoying dinner, Pete's been waiting for the moment for awhile now. They are talking about music, love, and everything in between until Pete starts rubbing Brandon's crotch with his foot from underneath the table.\n\nThroughout the night, Pete has been making Brandon drink more and more wine over their dinner course. Pete's been noticing Brandon is getting more and more drunk, so he decided to do a little flirting with him. Pete decides to make the conversation between them more interesting.\n\nPete: When was the last time you had sex?\n\nSurprised by Pete's change in the convo, Brandon plays along.\n\nBrandon: Last night.\n\nPete: I didn't get any since last week.\n\nBrandon: Why not?\n\nPete: I've been busy on tour and chasing teenage boys around.\n\nBrandon: Oh.\n\nPete: But I'm glad I got you to have dinner with me.\n\nBrandon: Yeah.\n\nPete: Ever since I seen the \"Mr. Brightside\" video, I decided to myself, I want that man.\n\nBrandon now knows the reason why Pete invited him to Dinner. So he decides to play along even more.\n\nBrandon: Do you want my Peter inside of you?\n\nPete laughs, like a girl, since that's his real name.\n\nPete: I want you to deflower me.\n\nBrandon laughs too, since the word \"flower\" is included in his last name.\n\nBrandon: What do you say, how about we go check into a motel.\n\nPete: Sure.\n\nBrandon makes Pete pay for the bill, and off they go.\n\nPost by Hook on\n\nAn angry parent has written an email to Fall Out Boy's label, Island Def Jam Records, after taking her daughters to see the band last Tuesday (May 2) in Charlotte, North Carolina. The woman wrote that she was enraged by bassist Pete Wentz's \"personal political testimony\" onstage, complaining that \"the ticket said 'all ages,' and your band was very foul-mouthed and anti-morals. Charlotte is not the demoralized city that liberal San Francisco and other cities across the North and West are...this was a concert, not some liberal homosexual rally.\"\n\nThe woman promised to contact national news organizations and other venues where Fall Out Boy would be playing, claiming that the band would lose \"a lot of financial support\" as a result. She concluded, \"Your responsibility was to sing your songs. When you opened your mouth to talk, you blew it...By the way, my children will not be a part of your sick idea of family.\"\n\nWentz posted the letter at Fall Out Boy's website, along with his own response. The bassist wrote, \"The only thing I said in Charlotte was, 'You can leave this show and say, ‘I think this guy is an arrogant jerk,’ or think, ‘This band is better than this one,’ because these are your opinions. The only thing we consider unacceptable is for you to engage in sexist, racist or homophobic behavior. If you do, we don't want you as a fan.'\"\n\nWentz did offer an apology for any profanity he might have used, but did not change his stance, adding, \"I encourage fans of our band to grow up to become good people and to change the world. Unfortunately, I don't believe that treating other people as inhuman is acceptable. (Our show) is not a liberal homosexual rally, but at the same time, it will never be a Ku Klux Klan rally.\"\n\nFall Out Boy takes its Black Clouds And Underdogs tour to Columbus, Ohio tomorrow (Tuesday, May 9).\n\n-----------------\n\nThat woman is insane. However, it's very cool what Pete said."
