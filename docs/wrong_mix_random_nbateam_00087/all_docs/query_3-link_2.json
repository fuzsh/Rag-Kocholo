        "text": "Whistler continues its winter streak with 40cm over the World Ski and Snowboard Festival week, and more snow in the forecast this week. In case you have not heard, Whistler has had an unreal winter this year and it still does not seem to be done with us yet.\n\nWinter has not stopped up in Whistler. We had a small weather break on Monday with the first sun in a long time, however the snow came back in and will continue through until the weekend. Today we saw about 20cm of new snow overnight with a freezing level just above the Blackcomb Gondi. This meant the snow was pretty good in the trees in the morning and really good in the alpine. As the day progressed it started to warm up and things got a little heavy even up high.\n\nWhistler has seen a crazy start to the Spring season with constant snow over the past few days. In the morning it has been snowing in the valley and as temperatures increase during the day it has been turning to rain on the lower bit of the mountain. But today it has been snowing pretty constantly to just above the valley floor. Up high the snow is awesome and with snow at the treeline warming up by the end of the day. No matter what though the snow is soft and fairly deep everywhere on the upper mountain.\n\nWhistler is in the midst of another storm system with snow over the past couple days and more in the forecast. The past few days have been really fun on the mountain with some fresh snow and fast crud underneath. Although there is a rain crust layer up most of the alpine the top bit of the upper runs is skiing really well. Today in the wind loaded pockets there was actually some really good turns to be had.\n\nWith over 20cm of new snow and more on its way this weekend, Whistler Blackcomb is having an unreal start to March. Today was another awesome day with fresh snow and most of the mountain opening up. Last night it snowed all the way down to the valley making the lower mountain areas fun until they finished avalanche control on the upper lifts. Throughout the day though the temperatures were definitely warming up.\n\nWhistler is getting more snow this week, bringing back powder and good snow to the mountain. The last few snowy days in Whistler have delivered 48cm of fresh snow. This means that it is pretty difficult to find some hardpack snow right now on the upper mountain. This fresh snow is on top a fairly variable crust or hardpack layer but in most places this layer is not a factor. The new snow over the last days have compacted to create less of a crust layer underneath at the resort. This means that the snow feels soft throughout most of the turn while skiing.\n\nThis weekend was super fun out on Whistler Blackcomb with fast, chalky snow and the occasional stash of untracked snow. This last week had a mix of sun and clouds with little to no precipitation. Even though we have not seen that much new snow the wind and a couple centimeters here and there did a lot for the resort. It buffed out everything and made for fast hardpack skiing. The alpine snow was movable in some areas but mostly was firm.\n\nYesterday Whistler received 12cm of new snow, refreshing the upper mountain. This new snow was definitely a nice addition to the current conditions as it allowed for fast and smooth skiing in the alpine. The previous week we had a nasty warm system that came through and rained almost to the peak, and in some areas there is two inch rain crust. The storm eventually cooled down, but only delivered a small dusting of snow on top of this layer. Once this snow was skied out and consolidated it skied a bit better, and finally this last system allowed for some good turns in the alpine and variable snow at tree line and below."
