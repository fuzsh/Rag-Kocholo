        "text": "PHOENIX – Arizona United Soccer Club announced on Monday the addition of Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz as an investor in the club. Wentz becomes the second high-profile musician to become part of United’s team, joining two-time Grammy Award winner Diplo.\n\n“I honestly couldn’t be happier about anyone joining us at Arizona United,” said Diplo. “Pete’s a fantastic person to have with us not only because he’s a huge soccer fan and played the game at a high level, he’s also an active philanthropist on a global level. Pete is a perfect match for the type of investor our team wants as we continue to grow in the USL and begin our strong push to take Arizona United to MLS. The state of Arizona and city of Phoenix deserve nothing less.”\n\n“I’ve known Pete and his management team at Crush Management for many years,” added David Rappaport, Arizona United SC minority owner and board member. “It’s impossible to not be a fan of Pete’s, and Crush are among the most well-respected and forward thinking companies in the music and entertainment space today. Myself and co-chairs Kyle Eng and Brett Johnson are very excited to have all of them on board with us.”\n\nUnited closes a five-game road trip to start the season this Friday as they visit Real Monarchs SLC at Clyde Field, and then returns home for a contest on Sunday night against Mexican National Under-20 team at Peoria Sports Complex.\n\nArizona’s USL home opener is at 7:30 p.m. PT on Saturday, April 30, against the Portland Timbers 2."
