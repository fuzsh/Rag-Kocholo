Learn how a family like the Wentzes would have spent a quiet winter’s night with this picturesque look at life in colonial Pennsylvania. Visit the Summer Kitchen to see an 18th century cooking demonstration.\n\nThe holidays may be over, but the Belsnickel is still stalking the Farmstead looking for good children who he can give a treat!\n\nAll ages; Free, no registration required."
