        "text": "Authorities have publicly identified the 14-year-old killed in a shooting that also wounded four other teens as they walked away from a Philadelphia high school athletic field after a football scrimmage, saying they believe he was not the intended target of the shooting.\n\nDak Prescott threw a career-high five touchdown passes against Philadelphia Eagles backups, Cedrick Wilson and Dalton Schultz each had two scoring catches and the Dallas Cowboys kept their slim hopes for a No. 2 seed in the NFC playoffs alive with a 51-26 victory.\n\nWashington Football Team's Logan Thomas (82) catches a touchdown against Philadelphia Eagles' T.J. Edwards (57) during the first half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Jan. 3, 2021, in Philadelphia. Alex Smith threw two touchdown passes and Washington beat the Philadelphia Eagles 20-14 Sunday night to capture the lowly NFC East. “This one’s special just because of how hard it was,\" said Washington coach Ron Rivera, who overcame a form of skin cancer during the season. Washington opened the season with a 27-17 victory over the Eagles. Eagles: They face difficult decisions in the offseason, including figuring out which quarterback they plan to build around for 2021.\n\n(AP Photo/Chris Szagola)PHILADELPHIA – Carson Wentz threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to Boston Scott with 40 seconds remaining and the Philadelphia Eagles overcame an 11-point deficit in the final seven minutes to beat the New York Giants 22-21 on Thursday night. Wentz threw a perfect strike to Scott and the backup running back made an excellent catch to give Philadelphia the lead. The Eagles (2-4-1) and Giants (1-6) are right in the mix in the NFC East, led by Dallas (2-4). Wentz threw for 359 yards and two TDs and ran for a score. After Wentz ran to the 3, Eagles coach Doug Pederson went for it on fourth down.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles' Carson Wentz (11) is tackled by Baltimore Ravens' Jihad Ward (53) during the second half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Oct. 18, 2020, in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Derik Hamilton)PHILADELPHIA – It’s Week 7, the Philadelphia Eagles and New York Giants each have one win and both teams are right in the mix for first place. The victory total will increase after the Eagles (1-4-1) and Giants (1-5) meet Thursday night, unless they tie. The Giants are coming off their first win under coach Joe Judge. But Elliott has hit all of his field goals under 50 yards this season and 89.9% in his career.\n\n(AP Photo/Jed Jacobsohn)SANTA CLARA, Calif. – A couple of unlikely players helped deliver the Philadelphia Eagles their first win of the season. Travis Fulgham caught a go-ahead 42-yard touchdown pass from Carson Wentz with 5:50 remaining and Alex Singleton returned an interception for a score to lift the Eagles to a 25-20 win over the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday night. But Fulgham got past backup cornerback Dontae Johnson and Wentz delivered a perfectly placed pass for the score that gave Philadelphia an 18-14 lead. It’s a resilient group.”TAKE IT AWAYThe Eagles got their first defensive takeaway of the season thanks to a poor decision by Mullens. With the Niners in the red zone, Mullens threw a ball up for grabs while under pressure and Rodney McLeod came up with it.\n\nPHILADELPHIA Eagles coach Doug Pederson says he feels great and has no symptoms after testing positive for the coronavirus. Im very fortunate.The 52-year-old Pederson enters his fifth season as Philadelphias head coach. I think one of the things Ive learned this offseason is, I can still run the team virtually, Pederson said. The list is for players who either test positive or have been exposed to someone who has. Pederson is the second NFL head coach known to test positive."
