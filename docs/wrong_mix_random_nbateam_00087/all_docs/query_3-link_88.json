Around the time of season one of Keeping Up with the Kardashian’s airing, Wentz and Kardashian made out in the music video “Thnks fr the Mmrs.” Remember that?\n\nWell, now it seems the two have interacted once again due to a hilarious internet mix up involving Kim K. and Kanye West‘s landscaper.\n\nRead More: Misfits Crimson Ghost inspires John Varvatos’ new high-end punk line\n\nFall Out Boy are gearing up for the Hella Mega Tour with Weezer and Green Day later this year, but it seems Pete Wentz is keeping pretty busy. Perhaps the bassist for Fall Out Boy just really wants to pursue his other passions.\n\nIt began when Architectural Digest was doing a story on the Kardashian/West home. Kim K. posted two pictures with the caption “Peter Wertz landscaping.”\n\nDo you know what Peter Wertz looks like if you’re casually scrolling through Twitter? Pete Wentz. Naturally, the internet took this mixup and ran with it. Check out some great reactions below.\n\nPete Wentz himself even got in the joke with the simple response “Side hustle.”\n\nWe can never count out the internet when it comes to something like this. Just recently, Wentz and Patrick Stump made an appearance on The Price Is Right where Pete got a perfect spin on the big wheel and they modeled some barware.\n\nAs stated, the Hella Mega Tour is coming to a city near you at the end of this summer. It’s nearly sold out but check for tickets here. A full list of dates is below.\n\nDates:\n\n07/17 – Seattle, WA @ T-Mobile Park\n\n07/21 – San Francisco, CA @ Oracle Park\n\n07/24 – San Diego, CA @ Petco Park\n\n07/25 – Los Angeles, CA @ Dodger Stadium\n\n07/28 – Commerce City, CO @ DICK’s Sporting Goods Park\n\n07/31 – Arlington, TX @ Globe Life Field\n\n08/01 – Houston, TX @ Minute Maid Park\n\n08/05 – Miami, FL @ Hard Rock Stadium\n\n08/06 – Jacksonville, FL @ TIAA Bank Field\n\n08/08 – Atlanta, GA @ SunTrust Park\n\n08/11 – Minneapolis, MN @ Target Field\n\n08/13 – Chicago, IL @ Wrigley Field\n\n08/15 – Pittsburgh, PA @ PNC Park\n\n08/16 – Hershey, PA @ Hersheypark Stadium\n\n08/19 – Detroit, MI @ Comerica Park\n\n08/21 – Washington, DC @ Nationals Park\n\n08/22 – New York, NY @ Citi Field\n\n08/24 – Toronto, ON @ Rogers Centre\n\n08/27 – Boston, MA @ Fenway Park\n\n08/29 – Philadelphia, PA @ Citizens Bank Park\n\nWhat do you think of this mix up?
