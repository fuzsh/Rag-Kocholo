        "text": "“We have utilized Lisa’s professional services multiple times with multiple individuals not only on our team, but with our partners as well. We find her to be a skilled instructor with a calming demeanor. I could not more highly recommend an individual with which to engage with if you are looking to enhance your public speaking/presentation skills.”\n\n“I have had the pleasure of working with Lisa on a few occasions. Recently, we worked together on a high-stakes presentation to my board of directors. Not only did the board approve both of my projects, they also gave me very positive feedback on the presentation and my readiness. Lisa is a talented coach with the skill to identify my individual needs, making it possible to enhance my delivery quickly and effectively. “\n\n“We are a specialized accelerator for foreign founders. Lisa takes our CEOs from shy, struggling speakers to polished, confident speakers in less than ten sessions. Lisa has a vast skill set, is a great addition to our program and we recommend her to anyone seeking to increase their public speaking skills”\n\n“I have referred clients to Lisa for years. Lisa goes beyond the myriad methodologies available to professional public speakers and addresses the unique challenges and potential differentiators available to speakers to wow their next audience. I have read parts of her upcoming book and will be giving copies to many people”\n\n“The content and structure of the course were skillfully planned. It was surprising to cover so much in a few hours. The course delivers key points that allows one as an individual to continue doing the different practices. In addition to this, the individualized feedback is the best thing that one takes away from it. Lisa,is not only an amazing teacher, but also a wonderful person. Her way of teaching to me is more a transmission of her self rounded work, and her inner being which is reflected in the way she works, and relates to people.”\n\n“Working with Lisa, I have in a short time, learned useful techniques for looking, sounding, and feeling more confident when I do a presentation. I appreciate how Lisa honed in on my goals and helped me to practice the skills I need to achieve these goals. Lisa’s warmth and encouragement creates a very relaxing and supportive environment in which to practice my presentation skills.”\n\n“Although I have lots of public and academic speaking experience, I sought out Lisa’s help for an important TEDxSF talk that I was preparing for. Lisa was amazing in her attention to detail and helped me in so many ways — presence, movement, vocal delivery, and timing. Her professionalism was rock solid and her ability to see my uniqueness translated into helping me deliver one of my best talks. Thank you Lisa and I would highly recommend her to anyone.”"
