        "text": "American football player (born 2000)\n\nAmerican football player\n\nTrey Aubrey Lance (born May 9, 2000) is an American football quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the North Dakota State Bison, where he received the Walter Payton and Jerry Rice Awards as a freshman en route to winning the 2020 NCAA Division I Football Championship Game. Lance was selected third overall by the San Francisco 49ers in the 2021 NFL Draft, but limited play and injuries led to him being traded after two seasons to the Cowboys.\n\nLance was born on May 9, 2000, in Marshall, Minnesota.[1] He was trained mainly by his father, Carlton, a former cornerback for the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League and the London Monarchs of the World League of American Football.[1][2][3][4]\n\nLance played running back in youth football and first played at quarterback in middle school.[4][1] He later attended Marshall High School, where he was viewed as the best quarterback prospect in Minnesota.[5] Lance initially wanted to play at the University of Minnesota and had been ready to commit there after attending a recruiting event in February 2017. However, he was deemed a wide receiver or defensive back prospect by them and other Power Five schools.[3][1] Lance eventually committed to North Dakota State in December 2017.[3][6][7]\n\nLance was redshirted at North Dakota State for the 2018 season, but played in two games in which he recorded two rushing touchdowns.\n\nLance was named the starter in 2019 and led the Bison to the 2020 NCAA Division I Football Championship Game and was named the MVP during the 28–20 victory.[8][1] He finished the season completing 192-of-287 passes for 2,786 yards, 28 touchdowns, and no interceptions, an NCAA record for most passing attempts in a season without an interception while also rushing for 1,100 yards and 14 touchdowns.[9] For his performance that season, Lance won the Walter Payton Award as the FCS's most outstanding offensive player and the Jerry Rice Award as the FCS's best freshman.[10][11]\n\nLance was set to start again in 2020 before the season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. His only game appearance that season was in a single game against Central Arkansas in October 2020. Lance threw for two touchdowns and ran for an additional two, while throwing the only interception of his college career.[9] The Bison were scheduled to make up the rest of the season in early 2021, but Lance announced following the game that he would opt out to prepare for the 2021 NFL Draft.[9]\n\nNorth Dakota State Bison Season Games Passing Rushing GP GS Record Cmp Att Pct Yds Avg TD Int Rtg Att Yds Avg TD 2018 2 0 0–0 1 1 100.0 12 12.0 0 0 200.8 8 82 10.3 2 2019 16 16 16–0 192 287 66.9 2,786 9.7 28 0 180.6 169 1,100 6.5 14 2020 1 1 1–0 15 30 50.0 149 5.0 2 1 107.1 15 143 9.5 2 Career 19 17 17–0 208 318 65.4 2,947 9.3 30 1 173.8 192 1,325 6.9 18\n\nPre-draft measurables Height Weight Arm length Hand span 6 ft 3+7⁄8 in\n\n(1.93 m) 224 lb\n\n(102 kg) 31+1⁄2 in\n\n(0.80 m) 9+1⁄8 in\n\n(0.23 m) All values from Pro Day[12][13]\n\nAhead of the 2021 NFL Draft, most analysts predicted Lance or Alabama quarterback Mac Jones would be taken third overall by the San Francisco 49ers, who traded up with the Miami Dolphins in exchange for their first-round picks in 2021, 2022, and 2023 and their third-round pick in 2022.[14][15] The 49ers selected Lance, making him their first first-round quarterback since Alex Smith in 2005 and the second-highest drafted FCS player after fellow North Dakota State quarterback Carson Wentz.[16] Considered a top quarterback prospect in the draft, Lance was one of five quarterbacks taken in the first round. He signed his four-year rookie contract, worth $34.1 million, on July 28, 2021.[17][18]\n\nLance began the 2021 season as the second-string quarterback behind incumbent starter Jimmy Garoppolo, but made his NFL debut in Week 1 against the Detroit Lions. Lance was used in one play during the first quarter, in which he contributed to the eventual 41–33 road victory by throwing a five-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Trent Sherfield.[19] Two weeks later against the Green Bay Packers, Lance took the field for two plays and scored a rushing touchdown on the first as the 49ers narrowly lost by a score of 30–28.[20]\n\nDuring a Week 4 28–21 loss the Seattle Seahawks, Lance saw his first significant playing time when he relieved an injured Garoppolo in the second half. Lance completed nine of 18 passes for 157 yards and two touchdowns and rushed seven times for 41 yards.[21] Due to Garoppolo's injury, Lance was named the starter for the following week's game against the Arizona Cardinals.[22] Lance completed 15-of-29 passes for 192 yards and an interception while also rushing 16 times for 89 yards during the 17–10 road loss.[23] Following the game, it was announced Lance suffered a sprained knee.[24] The injury made him unavailable for the Week 7 matchup against the Indianapolis Colts, with Nate Sudfeld replacing Lance as the second option behind a returning Garoppolo.[25] Lance returned as Garoppolo's backup during the next week's 33–22 victory over the Chicago Bears.[26] Lance did not take field again until the 49ers' final drive against the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 11. He rushed for seven yards before taking the victory formation to complete the 30–10 road victory.[27]\n\nLance remained the second-string quarterback for the next five weeks until Garoppolo suffered a thumb injury during a 20–17 road loss to the Tennessee Titans. Making his second start in Week 17 against the Houston Texans, Lance threw for 249 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception. The 49ers won the game by a score of 23–7, earning Lance his first career win.[28] Lance's start marked his final appearance in 2021 after Garoppolo returned for the regular season finale against the Los Angeles Rams.[29] Lance held a backup role during the 49ers' playoff run, which concluded with a defeat to the Rams in the NFC Championship Game.[30] Following the season, Lance revealed he spent the year battling a right index finger injury he suffered in a preseason game against the Las Vegas Raiders.[31]\n\nLance was named the starter over Garoppolo for the 2022 season, but appeared in only two games before suffering a season-ending ankle injury against the Seahawks in Week 2.[32] His only full game of the season was the opener against the Bears, completing 13 of 28 passes for 164 yards and an interception in a 19–10 road loss.[33][34][35] Lance had a second surgery on his ankle to remove hardware causing irritation.[36]\n\nLance entered the 2023 training camp on uncertain terms due to his limited play with the 49ers and the success of second-year quarterback Brock Purdy the previous season, who helped lead the 49ers to the 2022 NFC Championship Game.[37][38] Ahead of the season, Lance was named the third-string backup behind Purdy and free agent acquisition Sam Darnold, which led to further speculation over his future in San Francisco.[39]\n\nSee also: 2023 Dallas Cowboys season\n\nOn August 26, 2023, Lance was traded to the Dallas Cowboys for a 2024 fourth-round pick.[40][41] He was later named the third-string quarterback and was a healthy scratch all season.[42][43]\n\nOn May 1, 2024, the Cowboys declined the fifth-year option on Lance's contract, making him a free agent after the 2024 season.[44]\n\nLegend Bold Career high\n\nYear Team Games Passing Rushing Sacks Fumbles GP GS Record Cmp Att Pct Yds Y/A Lng TD Int Rtg Att Yds Y/A Lng TD Sck Yds Fum Lost 2021 SF 6 2 1–1 41 71 57.7 603 8.5 76 5 2 97.3 38 168 4.4 15 1 4 15 0 0 2022 SF 2 2 1–1 15 31 48.4 194 6.3 44 0 1 55.0 16 67 4.2 13 0 2 9 1 0 2023 DAL DNP Career 8 4 2–2 56 102 54.9 797 7.8 76 5 3 84.5 54 235 4.4 15 1 6 24 1 0\n\nLance is a Christian and was a leader of his local Fellowship of Christian Athletes chapter in high school.[4] His younger brother, Bryce, plays wide receiver at North Dakota State.[45]"
