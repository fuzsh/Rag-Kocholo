        "text": "Jesse Greenberg ’13\n\nJesse Greenberg currently serves as development assistant for the International Contemporary Ensemble (ICE), where he works on fundraising programs, grants, and database management. For Jesse, music administrative work of this kind has helped him create a strong network of musicians and artists throughout the NYC area while honing entrepreneurial skills that continue to be invaluable to his own work as a freelance composer and performer. As founding mallet-percussionist and composer-in residence of ShoutHouse, a new-music ensemble made up of several Vassar music alums and other NY-based players, and a percussionist for various performance and recording projects, these entrepreneurial skills play into almost every aspect of his music career.\n\nJesse also works at an early childhood education program, Free to Be Under Three, where he provides musical and artistic support to a curriculum aimed at providing social and linguistic structures for the development of young children. As an educator, Jesse has also provided private instruction in piano and percussion, and worked as an assistant for an innovative, middle-school composition course, ComposerCraft, founded and led by Robinson McClellan (VC ’99).\n\nMichael Hofmann ’13\n\nAfter graduating, Michael continued his musical studies as a master’s student in voice at the Bard Conservatory Graduate Vocal Arts Program. During the two-year program, he performed Bach’s Magnificat and Humperdinck’s Hansel and Gretel. In March 2014, he premiered the role of Harlan Hubbard in Shawn Jaeger’s new one-act opera, Payne Hollow. That summer, he attended the Tafelmusik Baroque Summer Institute. In November 2014 he contributed to a song recital series in the living room of the Vanderbilt Historic Mansion in Hyde Park. Michael made his drag stage debut as “Miss Holly Day” in a performance of “Sing for Your Supper” with Dawn Upshaw and Kelly Newberry. He appeared with the Albany Symphony Orchestra in February 2015, the American Symphony Orchestra in March, and in April, premiered Kyle Gann’s song cycle, Your Staccato Ways, at the Morgan Library in New York. He presented his degree recital, Monomyth, a musical exploration of Joseph Campbell’s theory, in May 2015. In addition, he has been an ensemble member of the medieval music drama The Play of Daniel, produced by Gotham Early Music at Trinity Wall Street, for the past two seasons. In addition to his musical pursuits, Michael is an active freelance graphic designer specializing in print media and branding.\n\nGretchen Eng ’12\n\nGretchen lives in Chicago and is applying her multifaceted, Vassar-style musical upbringing to the real world. She is music administration coordinator at Lyric Opera of Chicago, primarily overseeing auditions and assisting in other day-to-day operations of the chorus, orchestra, and ballet. She gets to watch a vast amount of opera (a dream come true).\n\nAdditionally, she runs a choir for kids in 2nd-grade-and-under, and is “singer-for-hire” as a soprano section leader for Saint Paul and the Redeemer, an Episcopal church near the University of Chicago.\n\nHer primary form of artistic expression, however, is in comedy; and she improvises all around the city—mostly with house teams at iO Chicago and the Playground Theater—although this often involves musical elements. For example, she is currently producing a short, original musical, Self-Starters, along with her fellow alums of No Offense Sketch Comedy, Andi Sharavsky and Danny Galvin.\n\nAndrew Gaines ’12\n\nAndrew lives in New York City and works at IMG Artists as a managerial associate in the Opera/Vocal Division. He manages the logistics of performance engagements for the opera singers on the IMG roster and coordinates with opera houses, symphony orchestras, universities, and recital presenters across North America and Europe. He oversees the details of each singer’s schedule, visa applications, contracts, travel, housing, finances, itineraries, and press activities. Prior to working at IMG, Andrew held positions at Columbia Artists Management Inc. (CAMI) in the booking department and the Glimmerglass Festival in the development department. His interest in arts administration began at Vassar in the Vassar College Choir, where he was the manager and librarian for three years.\n\nAndrew has been a member of the Baldwin Festival Choir for the past three seasons and the Astoria Choir for the past two seasons, and recently began serving on the Astoria Choir’s board of directors. He also volunteers with Sanctuary for Families, New York’s leading service provider and advocate for survivors of domestic violence and their families.\n\nJon Fuller ’11\n\nJon has not strayed too far from music since his graduation, for which he feels profoundly grateful. His first job out of college was doing publicity for classical artists (among other things, he was the man behind the curtain of Anna Netrebko’s Facebook page in 2012). In September of 2013, he transitioned to education, taking a position as accompanist at the Marymount School of New York. In June of 2015, he was given notice that he would be taken on as a full-time faculty member for the 2015–16 school year, still accompanying but also musically directing shows, teaching vocal production and giving one-on-one voice and piano lessons. Jon has also continued to make music in his free time: his debut album, Skipping Away from Dissonance, was produced by Christopher Connors ’12 and released in June of 2013. It was heavily featured on NPR affiliate WVIA-FM that year and was listed as one of the station’s best albums of 2013. He is currently working on a new full-length album, titled When the Noise Started, due for release by the end of 2015.\n\nEmily Bookwalter ’10\n\nEmily is an open-minded collaborator, improviser, and freelance violist/singer in New York City. As a faithful advocate for accessible music in communities, Emily is a violist and the external affairs manager for the String Orchestra of Brooklyn and has spent the past five years working as grantmaking and community manager at New Music USA. She performs regularly with many large and small groups throughout the East Coast, having recently served as artist-in-residence at the Berkeley Repertory Theater’s Ground Floor Residency Lab with Brian Carpenter’s Beat Circus, and is the violist within the newly-formed SORA quartet. She has toured with Carpenter’s Ghost Train Orchestra, and performed with Operamission, the Handel Festival Orchestra of New York, the New York Repertory Orchestra, the Reona Ito Chamber Orchestra and Chorus in Carnegie Hall, and more. As a true believer in music of our time, she is an avid performer of improvisatory and experimental music with friends and composer Scott Wollschleger.\n\nEmily has devoted much of her time to both for- and non-profit arts organizations, including the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra, American Ballet Theatre, Schott Music, Red Light New Music, and Benaroya Hall in Seattle, WA.\n\nSarah Goldfeather ’10\n\nSarah is a singer, songwriter, violinist, and the bandleader of the indie-folk Sarah Goldfeather Band. A “young and multi-talented” (The ABCs of NYC) performer, with “a sweet, bubbly stage presence” (Gili Malinsky, writer for the NY Times and Village Voice), Sarah was a 2014s fellow at Bang on a Can New Music Festival, and was recently presented by the Permutations concert series, the String Orchestra of Brooklyn, and the Tribeca New Music Festival. In 2014, she released her band’s “downright charming” and “endearing” EP (Listen To Them), Goldfeather, and will release a full-length album in the early 2017.\n\nSarah is the founder and co-director of the new music ensemble Exceptet and one half of the Fragments Duo. She has recently performed with Cooper Boone, Contemporaneous, Damien Escobar, Great Caesar, Pete Lanctot and the Stray Dogs, Jesus on the Mainline, CDZA, Furia, Mixtape: A Cover Band for Hipsters, among others. In addition, Sarah has recently collaborated with 2015 Pulitzer Prize winner Julia Wolfe on her With a Blue Dress On, with Pulitzer-Prize-nominated composer Christopher Cerrone, Grammy winner Phil Galdston, and others. Sarah received her master’s in violin performance at NYU-Steinhardt, where she served as concertmaster of the NYU Symphony Orchestra and adjunct faculty in violin.\n\nMark Van Hare ’10\n\n“I have been working as a composer and sound designer for theatre since graduation. I have written music and designed sound for around 50 plays, including Icarus by Edwin Sanchez with the Yale Dramatic Association at the University Theatre in New Haven, CT; In Fields Where They Lay by Ricardo Pérez González at the New Ohio Theatre in New York, NY; and Generation Sex with Teatro Luna Theater Company at the Los Angeles Theatre Center in Los Angeles, CA. I got my start in theater immediately after graduation when I met Fitz Patton, also a Vassar graduate, and he invited me to shadow him at Williamstown Theatre Festival that summer. The opportunity to write original music in a huge variety of styles and using the full spectrum of techniques available to composers today—recording, sampling and remixing, using digital instruments, and live reinforcement of musicians, among others—is extremely exciting and artistically satisfying.\n\nIn September of this year Kelly Stout (’10) and I will be getting married in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. We are excited to share our ceremony with a small group of family and friends.”\n\nJacquelyn Matava ’09\n\n“After graduating from Vassar, I went on to get my M.Mus. in voice at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music in Bloomington, IN, where I studied with mezzo-soprano Mary Ann Hart (a former Vassar voice teacher). I ended up staying to do my DM, which I completed in May 2014. Upon graduation from IU, my fiancé Brett and I moved to San Antonio, Ttexas, where he is the director of bands at the University of the Incarnate Word and I am a voice instructor at St. Mary’s University and Trinity University. In addition to academia, I keep a busy performing schedule, which includes opera productions, concert appearances, and recitals. Most recently I sang the title role in Purcell’s Dido and Aeneas with Opera Piccola of San Antonio, and Queen Jezebel in Mendelssohn’s Elijah alongside Nathan Gunn at the University of Notre Dame. Upcoming performances include a recital at St. Mary’s University, concerts celebrating the music of Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Shulamit Ran in Chicago, and a production of Britten’s Noye’s Fludde, in which I will sing the role of Mrs. Noye.”\n\nLidiya Yankovskaya ’08\n\nLidiya’s recent work as symphonic and opera conductor has been hailed as “superb,” “expert,” and “coax[ing] every possible expressive note from the instrumentalists.” Currently, she serves as music director of Harvard University’s Lowell House Opera, artistic director of Juventas New Music Ensemble, and music director with Commonwealth Lyric Theater. She also works regularly with Gotham Chamber Opera, Center for Contemporary Opera, and New York Lyric Opera. Lidiya also served as a conducting fellow under renowned conductor Lorin Maazel at the Castleton Festival, where she had the privilege of assisting Maestro Maazel and filled in for him regularly in rehearsal and performance. Recent productions have received multiple awards from the American Prize and the National Opera Association Award, and have included a large number of commissions, premieres, and crazy collaborations such as an NEA-funded puppetry and music project entitled Poetry in Motion and the electro-acoustic ballet HackPolitik based on the hacktivist conglomerate known as Anonymous. In addition to her work as a conductor, Lidiya is a pianist and coach, recently serving as music director for Opera Boston’s education tours and currently as a Russian diction coach for Boston Symphony Orchestra/Tanglewood Festival Chorus. www.LidiyaYankovskaya.com.\n\nDiana Hill ’07\n\nDiana loves to involve herself in anything musical that calls for dedication or leadership—as composer, arranger, transcriber, director, consultant, coordinator, conductor, teacher, singer or pianist. She is the choir director at Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal in Ridgewood, Queens, both the adult choir and the children’s choir; she additionally acts as a cantor for services when the choir is not present. Outside of the church she sings most often with Ghostlight Chorus, an elite chamber choir with a varied repertoire of sacred and secular a cappella choral compositions. In the past year she was hired as the on-set music coordinator for Steven Soderbergh’s television series The Knick, rehearsing and providing direction for actors who are either singing or using a musical instrument.\n\nAlong with performing, composition remains one of her favorite paths to musical expression. In 2014 Diana won the Morton Feldman Composition Award for special excellence in composition upon receiving her master’s degree from the Brooklyn College Conservatory of Music, where she studied under the direction of composers Doug Geers, Wang Jie, and Tania León. Ghostlight has premiered several of her original choral works. She is currently based in Brooklyn and writes for podcasts, films, plays, vocal ensembles, and anything else interesting that comes along.\n\nPatrick Litterst ’07\n\nPatrick holds a master’s of music degree in percussion performance from the Boston Conservatory and a bachelor of arts degree in computer science from Vassar College. While at Vassar, Patrick was the recipient of the Adams Prize for Excellence in Computer Science and twice won the Vassar College Orchestra’s concerto competition.

Prior to joining PreSonus, Patrick was a software developer for Zenph Sound Innovations, a music technology startup based in Durham, NC, that developed technology for creating “re-performances”, making it possible to hear pianists from old audio recordings (such as those from wax cylinders or 78s) perform live again using state-of-the-art, high-precision, reproducing pianos. Patrick has also developed innovative music education software for TimeWarp Technologies. Patrick remains an active musician. He performs regularly as a percussionist in North Carolina, and is a member of the percussion sections of the Fayetteville Symphony Orchestra, the Carolina Philharmonic, and the Durham Symphony Orchestra.\n\nIlana (Tolkoff) Revkin ’07\n\n“After graduation I earned an MA in musicology at Brandeis University and then an MLS with a specialization in music librarianship at the University at Buffalo, in order to become a music librarian. In 2010 I married Ben Revkin (’06) and moved to Rhode Island. I worked for three years as Public Services Librarian at the Boston Conservatory. In July 2014, upon the birth of our daughter Maya, I left my position in order to devote my professional life to the viola, through teaching, gigging, and performing, a life that is wonderfully compatible with being a (mostly) stay-at-home mom. I became a member of the La Bella Musica String Quartet, which performs an annual library concert series as well as many weddings. I teach private violin and viola lessons in my house. I also play in the Narragansett Bay Symphony Community Orchestra, the South County Chamber Orchestra, and various other chamber ensembles.”\n\nElizabeth G. Elmi ’06\n\nElizabeth earned a master’s degree in Italian literature from Indiana University in 2009 and is currently a PhD candidate in musicology at the Jacobs School of Music, also at IU. Her research focuses on the relationship between music and poetry in medieval and early modern Italy. She has presented on the connection between the Commedia dell’Arte and Monteverdi’s operas in several forums, including the 2011 meeting of the Renaissance Society of America in Montreal. Since then she has investigated the concept and practice of orality in musical and literary production in Renaissance Italy. Her dissertation considers issues of orality and improvisation in secular song and poetry from the Aragonese court of late 15th-century Naples, and she plans to organize a series of performances of the music related to her dissertation through a collaboration with members of IU’s Historical Performance Institute. At IU, Elizabeth has also taught a variety of courses in music history, Italian, and comparative literature at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. In pursuing her interest in performance at IU, Elizabeth has studied voice with Professor Scharmal Schrock and performed with several choirs affiliated with the Jacobs School. In addition, she is a member of the Voces Novae Chamber Choir in Bloomington.\n\nRuth L. Carver ’05\n\n“Although I wasn’t a music major, I have gone on to a career in music. Following Vassar, I received a M.Mus. from the Peabody Conservatory, and an artist certificate from the University of Missouri-Kansas City, both in voice performance. I’m currently based out of Denver, and after starting my career as a lyric mezzo-soprano, have recently changed fachs to spinto soprano. I just received a grant that allowed me to come to NYC for several weeks to coach my new repertoire with the experts here. Here follow excerpts from my formal biography.”\n\nKnown for her bold characterizations and powerful voice, Denver, Colorado native Ruth L. Carver is quickly gaining recognition as a spinto soprano on the rise. Her voice is especially suited to Italian and German repertoire, and after a concert of German Lieder near Munich, Germany, the regional newspaper Münchner Merkur praised her for her “dark, romantic voice.” Ms. Carver appeared with New York Lyric Opera Theater in their spring 2015 reduced Ring Cycle.\n\nAn avid arts advocate, Carver also writes about classical music for online music journals. She recently made her directorial debut with Boulder Opera, and created an interactive opera event with Opera on Tap Colorado in 2014.\n\nThomas Heuser ’05\n\nThomas completed his DMA in orchestral conducting from the University of Cincinnati’s College-Conservatory of Music (CCM) in 2013. After an extensive national search, he was named in 2011 the 10th music director of the Idaho Falls Symphony, where he continues to broaden the scope of the symphony’s programming while generating tremendous enthusiasm and support for the orchestra. He commutes to Idaho from the San Francisco Bay Area, where he lives in Oakland with his wife, violinist Lauren Avery (‘04), and their newborn son Theodore. Thomas enjoys an active career as a freelance conductor in the Bay Area, and has made notable appearances with the San Francisco Academy Orchestra, the Berkeley Symphony, and the Hayward Festival Youth Orchestras, among others. He was a Fulbright scholar in Munich, Germany, where he mentored with renowned German conductor Bruno Weil at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater München. Prior to living in Germany, he served as the 2010 conducting fellow with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra under Paavo Järvi. Thomas was the last senior to graduate as a piano student of distinguished Vassar faculty member Blanca Uribe, and he was admitted directly from Vassar into the master’s program in conducting at Indiana University’s prestigious Jacobs School of Music.\n\nBenjamin Krauss ’05\n\nBen received his master’s degree in composition from the Aaron Copland School of Music in the spring of 2007. He then returned to Vassar the following fall where he served as an adjunct professor, teaching an introductory harmony course for the fall semester. Additionally, Ben has spent the last 10 years working as a pianist/music director of musical theater, both in New York and around the country. He was on the music teams for the Broadway productions of The Addams Family and The Mystery of Edwin Drood, serving as an orchestration associate for the latter. Selected regional theaters include Westport Country Playhouse, North Shore Music Theater, and Theater by the Sea. He continues to perform regularly in New York, and can often be heard playing at venues including 54 Below, the Metropolitan Room, and Upright Citizens Brigade comedy theater. As an orchestrator, his work has been featured in numerous benefit concerts, including Broadway Backwards, Gypsy of the Year, and the Easter Bonnet Competition. These orchestrations have accompanied singers such as Tituss Burguess, Lillias White, and Stephanie J. Block. Ben is also an alumnus of the BMI Lehman Engel Musical Theater Writing Workshop.\n\nGabriel Lubell ’05\n\n“Starting this fall, I will be joining the faculty of Knox College in Galesburg, IL, as a visiting assistant professor of music. But for the past 10 years, I have been living, working, and studying in Bloomington, Indiana. I moved here right after Vassar to study astrophysics at Indiana University, which culminated in a master’s degree and thesis on stellar populations in the globular cluster M15. At some point, however, I rejoined the music stream I’d explored at Vassar and earned my doctorate in music composition from the IU Jacobs School of Music. All the while, I have been teaching music theory and astronomy, and have offered an undergraduate seminar on the intersections of music, astronomy, and scientific thought. My creative output has focused largely on chamber music, though I have also written for voices, electronics, orchestras, elevators, and other such things through collaborations with musicians throughout the United States, in Sweden, and the Netherlands. The first album of my music, Studies in Light and Sound, was released in 2014. Additionally, I have been active as a music scholar and have presented several papers at national and international conferences. My work is primarily focused on issues of sound, space, color, and form in the music of Mozart, Schubert, and the Beatles.”\n\nJoanna Marsden ’05\n\n“Since graduation, I decided to specialize in flute and historical instruments. I completed master’s degrees in baroque flute at McGill University’s Schulich School of Music with Claire Guimond and the Hague Conservatory with Wilbert Hazelzet and Jed Wentz. I lived in the Netherlands for three years (playing the St. Matthew Passion sometimes twice in one day.) I’m starting a D.Mus. this autumn at McGill.\n\nIn the Hague, friends and I started a conductorless chamber orchestra, Symphonie Atlantique. We play classical and romantic repertoire on historical instruments. Our season is based in the Netherlands, and we tour together in Belgium, Spain, Mexico, etc. We made our Concertgebouw debut with a production of Handel’s Giulio Cesare.\n\nI have recently collaborated with harpsichordist Mark Edwards in Canada, the U.S., and Europe. We just finished recording an album of Devienne sonatas, charming pieces with nice melodies, glacial harmonies, and occasionally troubling voice leading. I recorded on my antique flute made by Tortochot in Paris around 1770 or 1780.\n\nI have worked at Harvard’s and McGill’s libraries and just started as web developer at a startup called Bookwitty. I live in Montréal with my husband, David Benson, a PhD candidate at McGill in music technology and high baritone.”\n\nLauren Avery ’04\n\nLauren received her M.Mus. in violin performance from Rice University’s Shepherd School of Music in Houston, TX. Since leaving Texas, she has pursued a career as a freelance musician and private teacher in Cincinnati, Munich, and now in Oakland, California, while she and her husband, conductor Thomas Heuser (’05), have moved. Lauren was a core member of the Castleton Festival Orchestra for many summers and played principal second violin under the late maestro Lorin Maazel for the grand opening of the Royal Opera House Muscat in Oman. She has been re-engaged as concertmaster with the El Paso Opera Company and the Berkeley Community Chorus and Orchestra for several consecutive seasons. As a member of the highly-active freelance community in the San Francisco Bay Area, she performs regularly with the Berkeley Symphony and with orchestras in Sacramento, Marin, Modesto, and the Napa Valley, among others. Lauren has spent the last two summers performing with the Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music under the baton of Marin Alsop; and since October 6th, 2014, she has been adjusting to life as a mom after celebrating the arrival of her first child, Theodore Avery Heuser.\n\nWilliam Barclay ’03\n\n“I’m currently the director of music at Shakespeare’s Globe here in London and have been for three years. It’s a dream job for me as you might well imagine. I’m still composing – the Globe-to-Globe Hamlet tour to every country in the world – meaning that by April, 2016 I will be able to count myself perhaps the only composer to have music performed live in every country on earth – until Scotland passes the vote, of course! The Romeo and Juliet I’ve composed here is currently touring in Austria, previously in Oslo and before that for three weeks at the Spoleto Festival in South Carolina. I’m publishing now – two volumes of the Jon Lipsky Play Collection, an important Boston-area playwright (Smith & Kraus is the publisher), and in 2015 I will be coediting a book called Shakespeare, Music, and Performance for Cambridge University Press with the esteemed Shakespeare music expert David Lindley. I’m collaborating in 2016 with the Boston Symphony Orchestra for the sixth time and just guest conducted La Orquesta Sinfónica de Santiago in Chile in a Prokofiev/Tchaikovsky Romeo y Julieta program in Santiago and Antofagasta.”\n\nPatrick Castillo ’01\n\n“What I’ve been up to—Composing: lots of chamber, choral, and electronic music, which I’ve been fortunate to have commissioned and performed throughout the U.S. and internationally, a recent highlight being an appearance at the Havana Contemporary Music Festival last November. I also recently wrote music for an indie horror flick and a commercial for NYC Pride. Innova Recordings will release an album of my vocal chamber music this fall, featuring mezzo-soprano and fellow Vassar alum Abby Fischer ’01. I host a concert series for the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center and give lectures for various other organizations and festivals throughout the year; I also provide program and liner notes for orchestras, recording companies, et al. I was involved in the launch of Music@Menlo, a summer chamber music festival in Silicon Valley, where I was artistic administrator for more than 10 years and continue to develop various educational programs. For three seasons, I served as the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra’s director of artistic planning, and I’m currently an artistic advisor to the Milwaukee Symphony. I recently founded a Pierrot ensemble, Third Sound, which will launch its inaugural season this fall with a weeklong residency in Cuba, at the aforementioned Havana festival.”\n\nAbigail Fischer ’01\n\n“After Vassar, I lived a year in Florence, studying Italian and taking private voice lessons. I then went to Eastman School of Music for a master’s degree in voice performance, also playing Baroque cello. This year I made my Carnegie Hall debut with Hindemith’s When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom’d, and I look forward to my October 2015 L.A. Opera debut in Missy Mazzoli’s multi-media opera Song from the Uproar, written for me and the NOW Ensemble, also available on New Amsterdam Records. This year I performed Mahler Third Symphony with Santa Rosa Symphony, the usual handful of Messiahs, and I am happy to work again this year with the BSO and Orchestra of Saint Luke’s. I have traveled a lot with John Zorn, performing his vocal chamber music in Australia, Jerusalem, all over Europe, and the Lincoln Center Festival. I have premiered other new works by composers such as Nico Muhly, Bernard Rands, Elliott Carter, and our very own Patrick Castillo ‘01. My repertoire has been consistently widening to perform more standard opera rep, including Cenerentola, Ariodante, Marriage of Figaro (Cherubino), and Clemenza di Tito (Sesto), while keeping the fun unknown things with companies like Gotham Chamber Opera. I look forward to see where it will go next!”\n\nDana Astmann ’00\n\nDana Astmann is the director of communications at the Yale School of Music in New Haven, CT.

Ensemble, then G. Schirmer, all while composing as much as he could. From 2004s he pursued a doctorate in composition from Yale’s School of Music and Institute of Sacred Music, and finally caught that elusive prey in 2011 after a few more years teaching and composing in the big city. He did time as an adjunct professor at several local colleges, with a stint helping to digitize the Morgan Library’s music manuscript collection.\n\nSince 2011: at Kaufman Music Center he teaches ComposerCraft, a seminar for advanced composers ages 11–14, plus a gaggle of high school composers at the Special Music School, NYC’s only school where composition is a core part of the academic curriculum. These things, plus writing and teaching online theory courses for Rutgers, and consulting work for the fast-growing online music notation program Noteflight (a community of 1.6 million composers that includes most of his own young students), currently sustain him.\n\nAll the while he continues to compose, fulfill commissions, and consternate about the creative process.

In July 2008, he returned to Vassar in a professional capacity and marvels still at the endlessly hard work it takes to realize a Vassar education. Musically and artistically inclined in spite of himself, he indulges the compulsion to compose, write and play, and his sounds have been heard on the Discovery network and in a number of colorful haunts in and around New York. He is most proud of his musical children: Eva Rose (5) has gifts for ballet and song, and Frederick William is a spirited capoeirista at age 8.\n\nThea Tullman, Moore ’97\n\nOn both opera and concert stages, Thea has delighted audiences with her “crystalline voice and natural stage presence” (Wall Street Journal).

Billy Name, … taught me a lot about following ones intuition and cutting the brush rather than taking the beaten path. Combined with fond memories of learning from Professors Edward Reilly and Annea Lockwood, who seem to be driven by a truly shared my love for music and accompanied me kindly on that journey.\n\nWinning a fellowship from Vassar, I went to Basel Switzerland and studied electronic music and composition with the Swiss Composer Roland Moser which was intermingled with another fellowship to create instruments and music at the famed STEIM institute in Amsterdam for music instruments and performance research.\n\nMy studies at the Music Acadamy ended with winning a prestigious award for composition for my work “I Clearly Saw” and a short time later I was honoured with an artists award for my work using intermedia. Free again from financial burden, I composed music for well known performers ( the percussionist Fritz Hauser, the violinist Malcom Goldstein, and the Gambist Imke David) and toured Europe and Asia performing my own works for instruments and electronics for about a decade.I thought my journey would continue as was, but I made a slight detour into the world of Hoerspiel and Music Theatre and wrote a slew of works with the Swiss author Urs Jaeggi and three large theatre works for actors and music ensemble which then premiered in established theatre venues in Germany and Switzerland. Although met with much success, one of the works “Spinoza is(s)t” - a portrait of the philosopher in his persecution by religious and political figures- caused a riot amongst the audience and caused a second detour for which I embraced a strong interest in media art and sound art. Tis has proven to be a gold mine for opportunity and I began to create works that were “playable” by the audience. Exhibits in major museums in Asia and Europe came along and a research position at the ETH Zurich (Einstein’s school) in its Computer Science Department around me to continue the concept of engagement and immersion using high tech research to create works using satellites.\n\nMy fondest memory of Vassar was after graduation when I organised a concert of music from fellow Vassar grads at Skinner Hall. It gave all of us feeling of a connection through the arts and also a sense of gratitude for what the music department at Vassar had given each one of us.\n\nKendall Kennison ’89\n\n“After graduation, I went to graduate school at Rutgers to study composition with Robert Moevs and Peabody to study with Robert Hall Lewis, and—eventually—got a job teaching music theory and composition at Goucher College, where I am currently associate professor and member-at-large of the faculty. I still manage to keep writing music. In 2014, I opened the Volvo Off-Road Fest 2014 Zagreb in Croatia, with a lecture–recital of my own piano music and that of my mentors Robert Moevs and Richard Wilson; Stanley Alexandrowicz played my guitar piece, Backanally, at Schott Recital Room in London; and, closer to home, I had back-to-back performances of a solo mandolin piece on a Tuesday and my Real Estate Rag on a Wednesday at Goucher. This year, I had a premiere by local group the Poulenc Trio of my oboe-bassoon-piano piece Trilogue. On the personal side, I got married 25 years ago; we have three children and live in North Baltimore.”\n\nStephanie Schlagel ’89\n\n“After Vassar I attended University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where I received a MA in music history (1991) and PhD in musicology (1996), with a focus in Renaissance music, specifically the posthumous reception of Josquin des Prez. I have been on faculty at the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music since 1998, teaching music history at the undergraduate, master’s, and doctoral level. For approximately 10 years I directed the recorder consort and the alta capella of CCM’s Early Music Lab and oversaw the acquisition of approximately 15 fine reproductions of Renaissance recorders, gambas, sackbuts, and shawms. I have published articles on Josquin’s reception in Journal of Musicology and Tijdschrift van de Koninklijke Vereniging voor Nederlandse Muziekgeschiedenis[TVNM] among others, and have presented at national and international conferences. My edition of Si placet Parts for Motets by Josquin and His Contemporaries (with critical commentary) was published by AR Editions, and a collection of parody masses on Josquin’s motets from the Bavarian ducal court is currently in production, also with AR Editions. In 1999 I began volunteering for Cincinnati’s early music ensemble Catacoustic Consort, where I currently serve as treasurer. I am the proud caretaker of two delightful cats, runner of half-marathons and marathons, and practitioner of hot yoga.”\n\nFitz Patton ’88\n\n“This past year has been very strong. I designed the sound for three plays on Broadway: It’s Only a Play, with Nathan Lane and Mathew Broderick, directed by Jack O’Brien; Airline Highway, by the extraordinary young playwright Lisa D’Amour and directed by Joe Mantello; and Act of God, an almost one-man show with Jim Parsons of ABC’s Big Bang Theory. In addition, the performance and design magazine I started in 2013, Chance, has continued to expand, achieving over 1,000 subscribers and distribution on Amazon as well as Manhattan, Chicago, and Los Angeles newsstands. And finally, eight members of the editorial staff of Chance have been invited to the Prague Quadrennial to present a talk in their main forum and a workshop on performance journalism. Additionally, we were one of five publications worldwide to be nominated by the Quad for their Best Scenography Publication award. Chance was chosen as one of the most innovative magazine launches of 2014 by the Magazine Innovation Center, receiving the award at a breakfast in Manhattan alongside executives from the Hearst Corporation and other major national organizations (a little strange, actually!)”\n\nSusan (Stagnitta) Bialek ’86\n\nSusan was appointed artistic director of the Children’s Chorus of Maryland & School of Music in the fall of 2014.

He sang tenor at Trinity Church, Copley Square and countertenor with Schola Cantorum of Boston, and the Boston Camarata.\n\nJohn started conducting in 1990, forming a professional chorus in Worcester (Convivium) that recorded and performed most of the choral works of Leo Sowerby. In 1998 he began teaching at Clark University, followed by his current position at Worcester Polytechnic Institute where he is Instructor of Music and Director of Choral Activities, overseeing four choruses and four a cappella groups.\n\nJohn’s interest in technology started at Vassar where his advisor suggested he take a class in computer programming, and has blossomed since. As an arranger, he has over three hundred titles, and has composed extensively for his current singing groups, including a complete Evening Service for a three week tour of London. His most recent musical theater work – Witchwife – chronicles the last days of his 13th great-grandmother, Susanna Martin, who was hanged for being a witch in Salem during the hysteria.\n\nJohn teaches and lectures frequently in London where he continues to spread the early American choral tradition across the pond.\n\nSteve Hayden ’81\n\n“After college, I continued studying with Dennis Sandole in Philadelphia until early 1989. I also continued playing in a band that formed at Vassar with Ed Bair ’81, Charlie Lewis ’81 and Matt Drake ’81.The group disbanded in late 1982, and I began a long slog of wedding and bar mitzvah band work that lasted until 2008. All along, I have taught guitar and bass privately and in various secondary schools. And..I’m married with two children.\n\nBut my real project, the part that matters most to me, has always been trying to compose original music. At this stage, there is a fair quantity of it…music for double-neck electric guitar, as well as chamber and orchestral stuff. I spend my time, energy and what’s left of my brain cells doing that.\n\nWhile it doesn’t exactly ‘pay the bills,’ it keeps me out of trouble.”\n\nJeffrey Hass ’75\n\nJeff is currently professor of composition at Indiana University, Bloomington, where he serves as the director of the Center for Electronic and Computer Music (CECM), having previously taught music theory and composition on the faculties of Rutgers University and the Interlochen Center for the Arts.

He has taught piano, theory, and music history in a variety of settings, including college, community music school, and private studio. In 1984, he and his wife, Helen, bought their first computer, which sent his career in another direction. He quickly got involved in music software development projects, including the Finale music notation program. In 1987, the Yamaha Disklavier—an acoustic piano with MIDI capabilities—enabled him to combine his interests in teaching and performing with computers and music technology.\n\nIn recent years, George has had a varied career as a music software developer (president of TimeWarp Technologies), multimedia performer, frequent clinician at music educator conferences, and author of numerous articles on the educational and professional applications of new music technologies.

Pat has also served as executive director of the Connecticut Early Music Society and Festival.\n\nDanny Brill ’74\n\n“I was in Vassar’s legendary class of 1974—the first coed class. I spent several years playing in rock bands after college before starting a musical instrument rental company, Keyboard Instrument Rentals, which I still own and operate in Manhattan. Then about five years ago I finally got around to recording a solo CD of original progressive rock music I’d written over the years. It is aptly titled Better Late Than Never, as I was in my mid 50s when it was released.\n\nI play keyboards on it (piano, Hammond organ, and various synths), and was fortunate enough to hook up with some world-class musicians such as Tony Levon (from Peter Gabriel’s band and King Crimson,) who played bass. It was also mixed by a world-class engineer, David Henschel.\n\nIt was a serious musical endeavor that took three years to write and record. There are many musical influences in my writing, including many bands I saw live while in college, such as Emerson Lake and Palmer, Yes, Pink Floyd, etc. And certainly the harmony and composition classes I took at Vassar served me well, particularly those with Prof. Middleton.”\n\nCandace Johnson ’74\n\nCandace is a global infrastructure, network, and innovation expert and entrepreneur.

We never cut a record, but we stayed busy, a fairly significant accomplishment, I’ve since learned. Then I went back to school and earned my MBA in finance and accounting, becoming a CPA.\n\nAt Vassar, I learned from a classmate about the Suzuki method for teaching little kids violin. So when I had kids, a boy and girl, I introduced them to Suzuki violin. It worked out well. My son is now professor of viola at University of Northern Colorado in Greeley, and my daughter is a thriving freelance musician in Los Angeles. Both have toured and taught internationally. Along the way, I started Rocky Mountain Fiddle Camp, which continues to this day. www.RMFiddle.com.\n\nAt my 30th Vassar reunion in 2003, I met Elyssa Paternoster Guardino, who was also a music major.

My music has been featured at ISCM World Music Days and has been performed at the Kennedy Center, Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center. I enjoy writing for amazing friends and musicians around the world. In 1981 I was elected to Aosdána, an affiliation of distinguished creative artists in Ireland.\n\nConcert Promotion: I was instrumental in establishing Music for Galway in 1981 and the Galway Music Residency in 2003. I have also served on the Arts Council of Ireland, the National Concert Hall, the Contemporary Music Centre, etc.”\n\nLynn Laitman Siebert ’67\n\n“After Vassar, I earned a master’s in musicology (Rutgers, under Robert Moevs) and then a PhD in music/musicology (CUNY Graduate Center, dissertation on Cole Porter, under H. Wiley Hitchcock). A music professor for 30 years, I taught courses in history, theory, world music, musical theatre and jazz history, conducted a vocal chamber ensemble and performed as violin soloist and chamber musician. After 23 years on the board of Morris Arts (www.morrisarts.org — the countywide Arts Council), I joined its staff as Director of Arts Participation and Communications. My responsibilities, among others, include extensive artistic programming (for First Night Morris County — 89 performances in 25 venues on New Year’s Eve, a world music /dance series, and such), planning exhibitions for two art galleries as well as handling press, photography and media coverage. Still an active violinist and lecturer, I authored the lead essay in the 2012 monograph, The Eternal Woman (on the art of Lyanne Malamed) and have a chapter in the upcoming book, I Concentrate on You: A Cole Porter Companion, slated for 2016 publication. Our two children, a special funds attorney and a climate scientist, are also accomplished musicians (a violist and trumpeter/composer, respectively) and our two grandsons (6 and 8) are budding pianists.”\n\nNancy Kenny ’65\n\n“I married within a year of graduation and moved to Oxford. There the early music movement had firmly taken hold, with the added difficulty for sopranos that the ideal sound for a soprano voice was thought to be that of a boy treble. I met Emma Kirkby at that time and wondered how someone with that voice could ever make a professional career. I had to find a coach for my voice of altogether a different style, which was not straightforward. Eventually I had some small-scale success, singing Dido, Alice Ford, the Mother in Amahl, and other operatic roles, as well as giving recitals. I enjoyed these, and usually included unfamiliar music, which, rather unexpectedly, frequently went down best of all with audiences. I also taught piano to the boys at New College School and had my own singing pupils.”\n\nMargaret Aydelotte Mills ’55\n\n“After graduation, having won the Frances Walker Piano Prize studying with Elizabeth Katzenellenbogen, I pursued piano in Freiburg, Germany, at the Hochschule für Musik. During that time, I performed extensively through Amerikahaus. Upon returning home, I studied at the New England Conservatory in Boston and received my master’s degree. While in Boston, I performed the MacDowell Piano Concerto with the Boston Pops under Arthur Fiedler.\n\nMoving to New York City after marriage, I studied with Frank Sheridan at the Mannes College of Music. My concert debut in 1974 at Carnegie Recital Hall has been followed by recitals all over the United States as well as in Berlin, Munich, Paris, Rome and other European cities. Besides the Boston Pops I have been soloist with the Schenectady Symphony, the Fort Myers Symphony and the Fairfield Orchestra. I have been featured with the Fine Arts, Manhattan, Cassatt and Laurentian string quartets. I have recorded four solo CDs and two chamber music CDs.\n\nAs an educator, I chaired the piano department at the Third Street Music School Settlement in New York and managed their faculty concert series. Eight of my performances appear on YouTube. I plan to do another recording of American piano music. My website is www.margaretmills.com.”\n\nMargot (Sheridan) Courtright ’51\n\n“After graduation, I continued piano at Mannes in NYC with the distinguished pianist Frank Sheridan. Awarded a Fulbright for study in Germany in 1954, I married Sheridan instead and assisted him at Mannes and Barnard. MA from Hunter College in 1960.

Devoted to theater, especially in London. When my arthritic fingers give up, and eyes grow dim, I plan to investigate computers. Still too busy. My brother’s progeny are my greatest joy.”\n\nMarjorie Fryxell ’50\n\nAfter Vassar, Marjorie went to New York for piano study with Isabelle Vengerova. She took courses in theory and chamber music at Mannes and spent one season in a fill-in job at the Met as rehearsal accompanist.

They give two concerts a year.\n\nElizabeth Hiteshew ’50\n\n“In the 65 years since I graduated from Vassar, music has continued to be a vitally important part of my life. Over the years, I have continued to study voice and to perform in a variety of choirs and choral groups. For the past eight years, I was a member of an exceptional choir, Angel City Chorale, here in Los Angeles, and have toured with them in Ireland. In April, 2014 I performed Christopher Tin‘s The Drop that Contained the Sea with the Chorale in Carnegie Hall. I retired from the Chorale in June 2014 on my 85th birthday. Without a doubt, my music education at Vassar continues to enrich my life and well-being!”"
