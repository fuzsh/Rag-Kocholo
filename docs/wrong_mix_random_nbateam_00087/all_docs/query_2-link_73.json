        "text": "Each year, The Alpha Conference draws leaders from around the world, crossing generational, denominational, and ethnic divides.\n\nJoin the conversation as we reimagine the future of church, leadership, evangelism and how each generation plays their part. You’ll hear from a diverse group of mainstage speakers, hear stories, and be equipped through practical workshops. Most importantly, you will have space to encounter God, receive prayer and take a little break from the hustle of ministry life to take a deep breath and be renewed.\n\nWhether you are actively running Alpha or not, this is an opportunity to motivate your team to share the good news in a good way, have fun together, and take the culture of listening, radical hospitality and prayer home with you.\n\nAs thousands of attendees testify, this is a conference you don’t want to miss!\n\nThe Belonging Co is a church movement based in Nashville, TN. Since its inception in 2014, the church has become known as a place to find freedom, breakthrough and healing through God’s word, His presence, and through worship. The heart of The Belonging Co is that every song released would empower both individuals and the collective body of Christ to encounter God through worship and lead them to experience the freedom that comes only through knowing Jesus.\n\nLo The Poet (Lo Alaman) could be considered an artist, speaker, minister, and Laker fan most days of the week. But there isn’t a day he doesn’t consider himself a husband, a father, and a son of The Most High God. Whether preaching, spitting poetry, or just chilling with new best friends, Lo seeks to create moments to minister the love of Jesus in every space he enters. Lo lives in Texas with his wife Erika and daughter Emersyn.\n\nCheck him out on: Instagram or Threads\n\nSeth Bazacas serves as the Lead Pastor of Wellspring Church, and the Alpha USA City Director in New York City, where he lives and serves alongside his wife, Jenavene, and two energetic sons. His heart is to live a life that makes no sense outside the love and power of God. He is a builder/creative at heart, whatever it takes to spread the love of God to the world. He has founded a local community center in NY, called Renew Queens, helped open various businesses, theaters, start-ups & prayer rooms across the east coast, and is the creator of rhythms.me, and the Cares.Network. He is committed to adapt creatively in whatever ways seem good to the Lord to spread His love to all the world.\n\nJordan Biere, based in Holland, Michigan, has been working with youth for 15 years and currently serves as the National Director of Alpha Youth in the USA. Alongside his wife Amy and their four children, Jordan loves the outdoor and activities like mountain biking, boating, hiking, fishing, and rock climbing are his thing. He’s keen for great coffee, and remains a devoted Chicago Bears fan. His only claim to fame was being invited to be an opening act on a tour featuring the one hit wonder “Plain White T’s”, to which he said no.\n\nMauri leads our Alpha and Care ministry at Denver United and comes alive when people discover Jesus, find meaning in their stories and embrace their authentic selves. Before coming to Denver Mauri received her Psychology degree from Oral Roberts University, worked in mental health and served on pastoral staff at New Life Church in Colorado Springs. At Denver United she established United Kids, True Women, along with various prayer engagements and has recently been accepted in to a Masters of Counseling Psychology program at The Seattle School. She is passionate about people, engaging in soulful community and growing the local church here in Denver.

Although raised Catholic, it wasn’t until this encounter with Christ that his life took on a new purpose. At the age of 16, Christian was drafted into the Canadian Hockey League, taking him halfway across the country and away from his family and faith community for the next five years. Being a hockey player and living out the childhood dream of most young Canadians wasn’t always in alignment with becoming the man that he knew God was calling him to be. However, knowing his identity was rooted in his relationship with Jesus, he made it his goal to live a Christ-centered life and help others to do the same. This led him to run Youth Alpha in the cities where he played, lead faith studies with his university hockey teammates, and go on mission at World Youth Day in Portugal this past summer. He currently leads worship and Alpha for young adults in his parish and is a Leadership Team Member at Huntley Leadership where he works alongside his father, Ron, to help Catholic communities worldwide experience cultural renewal and increase their impact as they live out God’s calling.\n\nDrew Hyun is the Founder and Pastor of Hope Church NYC, a family of diverse churches in and around NYC.
