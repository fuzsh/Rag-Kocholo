FOREWORD That the people of every nation are intensely curious as to the origin of the human family is evidenced by the many and varied stories of creation and of the first family to be found in the literature and traditions of every race. It is as natural for us to wish to know the origin and history of the several social families from which we are descended. Such a knowledge should not foster within us a foolish pride in the records of those gone before us, but should add to our pleasure and to a better understanding of ourselves — our limitations and our possibilities. “The knowledge of our ancestors widens our horizon and gives a broader view of life and its responsibilities. We remember that posterity may sit in judgment on us, and our times, and this thought should be an inspiration and incentive to higher and better things. ” Although the writers of these lines had little interest in family history until decidedly past their majority, they have found the search for genealogical data an ever increas¬ ingly fascinating game, not the least of their rewards being the pleasure derived from contact, by letter or by interview, with the many interesting people consulted. For “the Wentz family are a generous, hospitable, warm-hearted people.” After many urgent requests that the data be published, this simple history is presented for your perusal, with no claim to its exhaustiveness. There may be omissions, there may be imperfections in organization, but great care has been taken to prevent errors in facts from slipping in. If such there be, we ask your pardon. The chief authorities for this brief history are court¬ house records; data found in the libraries of the Historical Societies of Pennsylvania, Montgomery, and Lancaster; a history of the Wentz cemetery by Rev. D. D. Brendle, pastor of the Wentz Reformed Church of Worcester, Pa.; records of the same church; data gained during personal visits to . / this church and the homes of several of the ancestors in Pennsylvania; tombstones; family bibles; letters; and per¬ sonal interviews with many of the family. The authors are deeply grateful to all who have in any way assisted in their undertaking. May this record be carefully preserved and cherished and kept within the family from generation to generation.

Not before the tenth century, when the feudal tenures became heredi- tary, did the nobility commence to adopt surnames. The burghers of the cities imitated the nobility. Throughout the German lands, however, the Christian names retained the highest importance, so that only these were used in common life. In innumerable cases, family names were formed of Christian names; the names of the estate, country, or place from which an individual came ; one’s character, defects, events, etc.; one’s occupation or trade; the signs of houses. The counsellor, M. Fredrich Bogislav Wentz, who lived at Potsdam many years ago, claimed that the name Wentz evolved from Wenzer [Vintager], because on the Rhine where it is found early there are so many vintagers or wine makers; however, this derivation is not probable. Some have erroneously thought Wenzo an abbreviation of Wenceslaus, but from the records it is obvious that the name Wentz appears mostly at such times and in such coun¬ tries where Bohemian influence had no power. Wentz is an ancient German Christian name already in existence when Christian names commenced to change into familv names. %/ The name Wentz is derived, according to Rev. Carl Frederick Wilhelm Julius Wentz, from St. Wendelin, and is found in many forms; as, Wenzelo, Wenzel, Wenzo, Wen¬ delin, Wendelheim, Wandalin, Wandal, Quanzo, Wanzo, m elC>y: h fit' • ;! ■ no Hi . n 7: ns' r rru li >9vIov 12 WENTZ Wanzzo, Wanso, Wencio, Wazo, Wenzonis, Wentz. Our name appears, 1041, for the first time in old high German shape, Wenzo. German scholars give the following de¬ velopment of the name: Wandalin, Wandelin, Wendelm, Wendel, Wenzo, Wenzelo, Wentzo, Wentz. Records show our name in an almost uninterrupted line for 1100 years, changing indeed as language changed. We find the spelling Wenz only since 1700, and it is now most remarkable that the Catholic families, without exception spell Wenz, thus they can be distinguished from the Protestant Wentz. Probably the former derive their name from Wenceslaus. About 1800 the Wurtemburg family Wentz abandoned the spelling of their ancestors, and introduced the new form of Wenz. They were followed soon after by the Nordlinger family. Our way of spelling it has existed since 1277, as is proved by documents. In that year we find the Wentzen- feld [Wentz’s field] near Bingen on the Rhine. [The above is from an article by Rev. Carl Frederich Wilhelm Julius Wentz, author of a German history of the Wentz family. In the original of this article authorities are given for every quotation. Rev. Mr. Wentz, son of M. Fred- rich Bogislav Wentz of Potsdam, lived, in 1883, in Warten- berg, in Pommerania, Prussia, aged seventy-two.] In early Pennsylvania records the name Wentz is found variously spelled; as, Wens, Wenz, Wence, Whence, soon conforming to the present Wentz. ST. WENDELIN As our name is derived from Wendelin, it is of par¬ ticular importance to us. St. Wendelin, born about 554, was a son of a Scotch king. His father, King Ferchard, entrusted the boy to a bishop for education. There he acquired a desire for divine objects, renounced his hereditary rights and the throne, and visited holy shrines in the garb of a pilgrim. Thus he came to a wilderness of the so-called Westerreich, built a hut there, and later became a shepherd in the service of a Knight of Trier, whom he succeeded in converting to the *' i-.tn/j • l „ i. EUROPE 13 Christian faith. Pie afterward became a hermit in the con¬ vent of the Benedictines, at Tholey, and cured the sick cattle of the peasantry, and afterward reluctantly accepted the management of the convent as abbot, where he died, 617. PI is corpse was brought to his former hermitage, a chapel was built over it, to which pilgrims of all parts came, especially from England and Scotland. Later a village was built there, out of which the Archbishop Balduin, of Trier, in 1327, created the city of St. Wendel, belonging now tc the district of Trier. The Catholic Church has appointed the 23rcl of October as St. Wendel’s day, but in the Lutheran almanac it is cele¬ brated on the 20th of October. St. Wendelin was highly respected, especially as it seems by the peasants along the Rhine, as the royal, pious shepherd is the patron saint of the cattle. In olden times children were baptized on the day of their birth, and if they were born on any saint’s day, the custom was to name them after the saint. Now it may safely be concluded that our ancestor was born and chris¬ tened on either the 20th or 23rd of October, many centuries ago. Where he lived and what he was, we indeed do not know, but we are quite certain as to his birthday, and that would then, at the same time, be the birthday, of the family of Wentz. With this we do not assert at all that all families of Wentz must spring from the same progenitor, for that does not follow from the name they have in common. It is pos¬ sible that “Wentzs” lived at various places where the Chris¬ tian name changed into a family name. [Ibid.] EUROFEAN BACKGROUND The Wentz families arc widely distributed throughout Germany, Holland, Switzerland, and those parts of Europe that have come under German influence. Numerous refer¬ ences to the name Wentz, in its varied forms, are to be found in old Latin documents and other records. ■ [.bid!] ;;9ilinrra xinoW arfT 14 WENTZ The name St. Wendelin, from which Wentz is derived, appears first about the year 600. But at the same time we meet with the diminutive and endearing forms with z. In 744 the name Quanzo is found in a work published by Pardessus. As the Latin language had no w, — v, vv, gu [Guilemus], or even qu was substituted. At the time of King Pipin there appears a Wanzo, when a certain Anno made a donation to the famous convent of St. Gallen. The same name is recorded in 761, 762, 790, 797, 802, which is spelled Wanzo, and in 854 Wanzzo. Later appears a Wanso and even Uencio; the u in the last word is nothing but v or w, to be read Wencio. In 1041 Pertz, a historian, in writing of the Bishop Wazo says: Hie Wazo f u it frater Wenzonis Abbatis Florinis. [This Wazo was a brother of the Abbot Wenzo of Flor¬ ence.] Our name appears here for the first time in old high German shape, with the termination o, perhaps not as a family name but as a Christian name. In 1244 there is mentioned an Elizabeth Wenzonis. near Zell, on the Moselle river. In 1277 we find the Wentzenfeld [Wentz’s field] near Bingen on the Rhine, which field the Count Sponheim en¬ tailed on the bishop of Mayence. In 1318 a Wentzo is recorded as a witness. In 1341 Wentzo Kyppe, at Bingen, had a litigation with the Convent of Ruppertsberg. In 1361 there lived at Oppenheim Wentzo dictus Swen- degelt. In 1409 Wentz of Oppenheim came to Basel and be¬ came a citizen there. Leu, the historian, in the helvetic lexicon, Swiss Ency¬ clopedia [1764], spells the name first Wenz, and hereupon Ochs, in the history of Basel, seems to rely, for he always spells Wenz, while all the numerous old monuments and manuscripts at Basel show only Wentz. WENZ. In the fourteenth century there came from Moravia to the city of Basel, a family whose forefather was ;> . y • J , ;;‘i In X i ' EUROPE 15 named WENZESLAUM von der Lorch; from the baptismal name the family name Wenz originated. Also, after the battle at St. James near the city of Basel in the year 1444 a Bulgarian named Michael Wenz von St. Polten arrived from Lower Austria and became the first merchant, living in a palatial house. There are to be found [descendants] of this family four brothers: MATTHAUS [MATTHEW], who became an ensign in the year 1513 over the people who were sent from the city of Basel to Duke Maximilian of Milan; HANS HEINRICH [Hans Henry], who was canonical doctor of law and choir director of the charitable foundation [or institution] of St. Peter at Basel; JOHANNES [JOHN], who was doctor of theology and Master of Liberal Arts and choir director of the charitable institution of St. Peter in the year 1502, and 1512 he became rector of the high school at Basel; LEONHARD, who contributed much to religious re¬ forms and in the year 1536 became an alderman at Basel. Of these [brothers] HANS HENRY was the father of Gregory, of whose sons Jacob became Governor of Basel and Hieronymus [Jerome], father of Gregory, became an employer. MATTHEW, whose sons were named Hans Henry and Leonhard, the last mentioned [Leonhard] became alderman in the year 1629. In the year 1630 he became a wood- carver. In 1650 a first superintendent. His son Baltazai also became an employer. Although he had moved to another place, HANS HENRY, Jr., son of the same name, was city assessor and was a grandfather of Louis [Ludwig] who in 1720 became licentiate of law and who received a call to St. Petersburg but did not accept it; in the year 1750 he became an extra¬ ordinary professor of mechanics at Basel and 1752 became notary public, marriage license clerk, and afterwards dropped his chosen profession; he was also a member of If) WENTZ the Swiss Academy of Physical Mathematics at Basel. The following books were printed at Basel, by him published: eight books in Latin on mathematics and physics, one book in German, and four volumes of physical mathematics in Swiss. [Leu, Swiss Encyclopedia, Zurich, 1764, Vol. 19, p 286, et seep] Members of Wentz families are buried in churchyards in Basel, Switzerland, where on the doors of their sepulchers are cut their family crest or coat of arms. The inscriptions on some of the tombs date back nearly four hundred years. Some of the Wentz family, it is said, left Basel for re¬ ligious or commercial reasons, going down the Rhine and settling in the rich lower valley. When later persecutions came, members of these families emigrated, some finding a haven in Holland and some in America. We have been told that Peter and Valentine Wentz were thus of the Wentz family of Basel. MAEYKEN WENS, THE MARTYR “The story of the burning of Maeyken [Mary] Wens, at Antwerp, in 1573, is more than ordinarily pathetic. ‘Thereupon on the next day,’ says the account, ‘which was the sixth of October, this pious and God-fearing heroine of Jesus Christ, as also her other fellow believers, who in like manner had been condemned, were with their tongues screwed fast, like innocent sheep brought forward, and af¬ ter each was tied to a stake in the market place, were robbed of life and body by a dreadful and horrible fire, and in a short time were burned to ashes. . . .The oldest son of this aforementioned martyr, called Adrian Wens, about fifteen years old, upon the day on which his dear mother was sacri¬ ficed, could not stay away from the execution, so he took his youngest brother, called Hans Matthias Wens, about three years old, on his arm, and stood on a bench not far from the burning-stake to witness his mother’s death. But when she was brought to the stake he fainted, fell down, and lay unconscious until his mother and the others were burned. Afterward, when the people had gone away and ' . EUROPE 17 he came to himself, he went to the place where his mother was burnt, and hunted in the ashes until he found the screw with which her tongue had been screwed fast, and he kept it for a memento. There are now, 1659, still many descend¬ ants of this pious martyr living well known to us, who after her name, are called Maeyken Wens/ ” [Samuel W. Pennypacker, Historical and Biographical Sketches, 1883, pp. 167-168. Also see chapter entitled Der Blutige Schau-Platz Oder Martyrer Spiegel, Ephrata, Pa.. 1748. Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography, Vol. 4, page 276.] One Carl Ludwig Wentz was Stallmeister [Master of the Horse] to the Duke of Baden. Thus we find the Wentz families in Europe chiefly in southwest Germany, — especially in the valley of the Rhine, the Palatinate, Baden, Wurtemburg, Bavaria [Oppenheim and Nordlingen], — and across the border in Basel, Switzer¬ land. Some went to St. Gallon, Switzerland, and Florence. Italy, while others are found as far north as Brandenburg and Pommerania. A letter signed by Josiah V. Thompson, President of the First National Bank of Uniontown, Pa., and directed to Henry Dodderer, relates that he made some inquiries while in Europe and found that Christian Markel married in Am¬ sterdam, Holland, Jemima Wentz, sister of Admiral Wentz, and emigrated to Pennsylvania. [Genealogical Society of Pennsylvania, Mss. Dodderer Papers XII, p. 137] “Pennypacker. . . .shows that the first impulse of the German migration into Pennsylvania came from CrefelcI, a town of weavers and craftsmen along the lower Rhine, near the borders of Holland. Many Germans who had suffered persecution found a refuge at Crefeld, and they gladly ac¬ cepted Penn’s invitation to settle in his province .... In June, 1683, the first German emigrants sailed for Phila¬ delphia in the ship Concord .... Jacob Telner, of Crefeld, • i U'v 18 WENTZ who had extensive business interests in Amsterdam, spent thirteen years in the new colony.” [The Pennsylvania-German Magazine, July, 1906, p. 154] “The German colonists Penn brought here represent a far higher level of education than his English colonists. They were more advanced in the arts, they were better versed in letters, and they represent a higher educational standard than existed in England, whose schools were at their lowest ebb.” [Ibid., p. 156] “The cause of the migrations of the Germans to Penn¬ sylvania was in the majority of cases a religious one, more or less clearly defined — a search for liberty. Most of the immigrant Germans, of whatever ‘sect’ or church, were ad¬ vocates of freedom of religion.” [Ibid., p. 191] In discussing the traits of German-Americans, one writer aptly describes them as phlegmatic, showing in neither face or figure those lines of strain and hurry which have become almost the essential marks of the Anglo-Saxon; steady, effective workers; reliable in positions of trust; democratic; enjoying the simple, wholesome, original plea¬ sures of life; great lovers of country life. LETTER FROM DR. ABDEL ROSS WENTZ, D.D., PH.D, OF GETTYSBURG, PA. to his brother relating to his visit to Partenheim in the Palatinate Written October 19, 1908 “On Thursday, October 2nd, I got up earlier than usual L at 5 o’clock], took the train at Mayence, rode on the main line as far as Jngelheim halfway between Mayence and Bingen, changing cars, rode with an unpretending branch-line to the end-station Jugendheim, walked a mile farther, and so arrived about 9 o’clock at the village of Partenheim. I had written to the pastor there that I was coming that day, and so upon, my arrival I took the liberty to call upon him. He received me most kindly, took me into his study, placed the church books at my disposal for investigation, helped me in my search, gave me dinner, showed me the town, church, graveyards, etc., in short, gave me the whole day of his time. “What I wanted to know of the church books was this: First, is EUROPE 19 there any record of the birth, wedding, or emigration of this Valentine Wentz, as the tombstone at Sherman’s Church says, was born on the 10th of July, 1717, and married in the year 1749? Second, is there any record of Valentine’s father Frederick who was born I knew not when, or is there any record of his posterity perhaps even to the present day? “Sizing up the church books that still exist at Partenheim, I found them to be as follows: one book covering the period from 1592 to 1697, containing a record of the baptisms, weddings, and funerals, without any index whatever, hard to read, written in the abbreviated Latin of that period, ink often very much faded, the leaves sometimes worn eft as much as an inch. For the period from 1719 to 1785 there are three books, one recording the baptisms, one the weddings, and one the funerals. This was a stormy time of war and persecutions, and these three books have a great many gaps as a result. More care¬ fully kept are the records for the periods from 1785 to 1798, from 1798 to 1842, and from 1843 to the present, three books for each period. Sad to say, the book covering the period from 1698 to 1718 is lacking, just the book that could have answered my first question. No doubt the French, when they ravaged this country in the 18th century, either destroyed this book or carried it away and it was never returned and so disappeared .... “The oldest Wentz record that I could find anywhere was made on March 29, 1668, when Johannis Wentz [Heinez Wentzen Sohnl married Anna Katharina Anspach. Now let us take up the account at that point and dropping all the other Wentz records follow this Johannis Wentz, son of Heinz Wentz. We find that to Johannis Wentz and Anna Katharina were born: Johann Theobald Wentz, Jan. 19, 1672. Hans Velten, Feb. 1678. Sponsor at baptism a Hans Velten. John Wilhelm, July 4, 1680. Anna Lizabetha, January 29, 1682. Anna Otilia, April 29, 1684. Friedrich, baptized April 20, 1685. Sponsor Frederick Kling- meyer. “. . . .The father of Johannes Wentz was Heinz Wentz. Now we know that Heinz is a shortened form for Heinrich. And I think the name Wentz must be shortened from something also. . . .It would seem to me that sometime before 1650 a certain Heinrich Wendtland came from somewhere and took up his abode in Partenheim and when asked his name knew no better than to give the name by which he was called, Heinz Wentz. Here he started the Wentz family and three generations later, when the persecutions at the hands of the French became so severe, some of these Wentzes emigrated to America,.... “But they didn’t all emigrate to America ... .Those who re¬ mained in Germany and their posterity have all died except one.... Margaretha Philippina Wentz - married to Johann Georg Nehrbass. ' ■*> ; v.; WENTZ % 20 ....In the death of her father in 1894 the Partenheim Wentz family died out. “I find that from the year 1800 on the Wentzes began to drop the t out of their name and spell it Wenz, and that is the way I find it spelled at other places in Germany. . . . “I visited the church which is the same old building in which our ancestors were baptized and married. . . . ‘T tell you it arouses one's family pride to stand in the town and in the very church where hundreds of years ago one’s ancestors lived and worshipped enjoying the high esteem and respect of all about them. For it was easy to see from the church records that the old Wentzes were a respected lot and stood very high in their com¬ munity. Oh! it’s a great name, and we can only hope that it will be respected and esteemed as highly in the centuries to come in our own country as it is at present and as it has been in the centuries past!. . . . Hoping to hear from you soon, I am Your brother Abdel Ross Wentz Berlin N. W. 52 Luneburger Str. 21” Among- the many Wentz immigrants that came at dif¬ ferent times and established themselves in various parts of the United States, there were three who entered America through Philadelphia in the eighteenth century and settled in the southeastern counties of Pennsylvania: Johannes Jost Wentz Valentine Wentz Peter Wentz Johann Jost Wentz was born in Beerfelden, Hessen Darmstadt, Germany, and, in 1773, came with his wife and son John Peter [b. March 9, 1770] to Philadelphia, remov¬ ing very soon to Upper Milford Township, Northampton [now Lehigh] County, Pa. On his journey he passed through Montgomery County, but so far as is known he was unaware of Peter Wentz’s family there. Some of the sons of Johann Jost Wentz moved to New York state the early part of the nineteenth century. Johann Jost Wentz was not related to Peter or Valentine. [Richard Willing Wentz has published a record of the descendants of Johann Jost Wentz.] Valentine, in 1743, and later his brothers, Philip and t . • ti ■ . f' - EUROPE 21 Frederick, are believed to have come from Partenheim, Ger¬ many, finally settling mainly in York County, Pa. [Dr. Abdel Ross Wentz of Gettysburg, Pa., is of this family.] Peter Wentz, said to be a descendant of the Basel family, was among the earliest settlers of the Skippack region of the Perkiomen Valley, taking up land in Phila¬ delphia [later Montgomery] County, Pa., in 1704. [Hinke: History of Goshenhoppen Church, p. 7] His descendants lived in Montgomery, Philadelphia, Chester, and Lancaster Counties for several generations, though some have scat¬ tered throughout the country. The similarity of names in, and the intimacy of, the two families have led one genealogist, as well as members of both families, to believe that Peter Wentz was the uncle of Valentine Wentz. The following account is given by some of our Wentz family. Diligent inquiry has failed to disclose the source of this information, and, as the statements do not all fit the known facts of our family that are matters of record, we shall consider it a family myth. “The Wentz family is of German origin. In 1277 is found men¬ tion of Wentzenfeld | Wentz’s field I , near Bingen-on-the-Rhine, which field was entailed to the Bishops of Mayence. In June or July, 1731. four brothers, Beltzer, John, George, and Karl, from the Palatinate, in Germany, sailed in the ship “Samuel” for America. Purchasing land on Skippack creek, in the northern part of Philadelphia I now Mont¬ gomery | county, they located there and built a church which still exists and is known as Wentz’s Church. From these four brothers are descended the many of the name in Lancaster county.” [Biographical Annals of Lancaster County, Pennsyl¬ vania, J. H. Beers & Co., 1903, page 149]. This same in¬ formation was also given to Richard Willing Wentz by Charles E. Wentz of Lancaster, Pa.] . <• II PETER I.

There probably were other children who died young as Peter refers in his will to Jacob as “my oldest son now living.” The family of Peter Wentz lived, it is said, in Parten- heim, Germany, a little village beautifully situated between two small hills in a fertile district not far distant from Bingen-on-the-Rhine. It was from Partenheim, so the story goes, that Peter [prior to 1704], and later his nephews, Valentine [1743], Philip, and Frederick, came to seek their fortunes in the New World. Dr. Abdel Ross Wentz of Gettysburg, Pa., has visited this village and the church that our ancestors once attended. It is easy, he says, to see from the church records that the old Wentzes were a respected lot and stood very high in their community. Among the earliest settlers of the Skippack region of the Perkiomen Valley was Peter Wentz. “As he paid quit-rent March 15, 1718, on 100 acres for a period of 10 years and on 50 acres for a period of 14 years, he must have settled in the valley as early as 1704.” . . • » « \\ PETER I. 23 [Hinke, History of Goshenhoppen Church, p. 7.] He probably came from the Palatinate or Alsace, from which province many of his associates emigrated. There is, however, no record of the ship on which he sailed or of the date of his arrival. It was not until later that Penn¬ sylvania began to keep records of her immigrants. It was this Peter Wentz who, tradition says, was a wild rover of the high seas and commanded a privateer. After coming to America he reformed and, settling down to farm¬ ing, joined the Dunkers or Brethren sect. [Dunkers — a sect of German-American Baptists, properly termed Breth¬ ren, who migrated to Pennsylvania about 1728, because they were persecuted in Germany. In some respects they re¬ semble Quakers.] It was his sons who were instrumental in organizing the Reformed Church, still known by the family name. [Montgomery Transcript, October 13, 1911.] He must have been possessed of considerable means, for, as is said by one writer: “The single-hearted, God-fear¬ ing men, who sought in a foreign land that religious liberty which was denied them at home, were, with but few excep¬ tions, men of family, for in those days, a large sum of money was required to equip a vessel for a long voyage, and pro¬ vide the means of subsistence when the colonists were arrived at their destination”; and he became, after his ar¬ rival in America, the owner of considerable land. We have stood and gazed and, far as eye could reach, in every direc¬ tion was land at one time possessed by Peter Wentz, the Immigrant. Truly it could be said of him, “He was monarch of all he surveyed.” Peter Wentz was one of the Petitioners for the Skip- pack Road in 1712. Peter Wentz, the Elder, was naturalized in Philadel¬ phia County, Pa., January 9, 1729/1730.

John Philip Boehm] HOME OF PETER WENTZ, THE IMMIGRANT Built 1744, Worcester, Pa. In 1744, in Worcester [also called Center Point], Pa., Peter Wentz built a two-story Colonial house of red sand¬ stone. Though the appearance of the house testifies to its antiquity, it is still in a state of good preservation. The beams and rafters and construction work of the house are of a high order of excellency and testify to the force of character of the builder. Later the house was added to. There is still to be seen, in the second story, the little old funeral door, through which the coffin was carried and let down. Peter Wentz acquired several thousands of acres in Worcester Township, Montgomery County, Pa. [Scrap Book No. 91, pp. 51.'. and 139, in Library of Historical Society of Montgomery County, Pa., at Norristown, Pa.] March 15, 1718, he paid quit-rent on 100 acres for a PETER I. 25 period of ten years and on 50 acres for a period of fourteen years. [Hinke, History of Goshenhoppen Church, p. 7. Also, Perkiomen Region, Past and Present, Vol. I, No. 2.] This land was located in the south-western part of Towa- mencin Township [Mathew’s History of Towamencin] and was close to the Skippack stream. He later acquired by purchase in fee several large tracts. Deed, February 10, 1711. Thomas Fairman, of Shackamaxon.

[See deed of April 6, 1742.] I Philadelphia Deeds G 3, p. 160 et seq.] About the year 1720 the land of the township of Wor¬ cester was being sold by English merchants, who had bought it of Penn. Settlers came into the country looking for per¬ manent homes. Old Peter Wentz, living along the Skip- pack, saw his opportunity and purchased large tracts of land. “His large estate was bounded on the north by the Morris Road, on the west it started at the Morris Road and followed the Henning Road [the old Mill Road] southward to the present Wentz’s Church property where, cutting right through this property, it followed a straight course to the road running east and west which forms the southern boundary of the properties of Amos Schultz and Dr. Powell. Incidentally, I might say that this short road is very old. I have seen it mentioned in an old deed to Abraham Lefeber of the year 1708. The boundaries of the Wentz estate were simple straight lines with the exception of the southern one. It started at a stone in the southern road and ran eastward in a straight line parallel to the Morris Road to a point where the road leading due south from the Morris Road at Locust Corner would intersect it. From this point of inter¬ section the boundary line ran northward to a large stone in line with the Skippack Road, and from this point eastward the Skippack Road is the southern boundary to Homsher’s Hill. Here the Buck Road, from the Skippack Road to the Morris Road is the eastern boundary. ” [Rev. D. D. Brendle, Pastor of Wentz’s Church.] At the death of Peter Wentz this estate was divided among his five children. Patent, February 10, 1728.

Wm Plumsted Regr Genl WENTZ CEMETERY WORCESTER, PA. The private cemetery of the Wentz family, in the northern part of Worcester, is the oldest place of burial in the township. It was located on the estate of Peter Wentz and was primarily a burial ground for the early Wentz family and their retainers. Peter Wentz, the Immigrant, his wife, his children, and grandchildren to the number of thirty-six are buried in this cemetery near Worcester [Cen¬ ter Point, Skippackville] , Pa. The farm to which the cemetery belongs passed successively from Peter Wentz to his son, Abraham Wentz, Michael Croll, the Wancer [Warner?] family, John Fisher, and Harry Heilman, who owned and occupied it in 1926. The Wentz family held a lease on the farm, which gave them the privilege to visit and repair the plot whenever they desired. The cemetery, a plot about fifty feet square, is situated in the midst of a cultivated field on a declivity sloping to¬ wards the meadowbrook which flows westward to the Zacharias Creek. Formerly it was surrounded by a stone wall; it was long in a neglected condition, is seldom visited, and is at some distance from any highway. Several years ago a member of the Wentz family living in Philadelphia had the tombstones reset and a cement wall built around the burial spot. * 38 WENTZ WENTZ FAMILY PRIVATE BURYING GROUND Worcester, Pa. It is not known at what time the first interment was made in this cemetery, nor can it be told exactly from any memorials contained in the yard itself. The first persons buried here were probably the children and the grandchil¬ dren of the first Peter Wentz who died in infancy before 1740. From the inscription on the tombstone of Mrs. Peter Wentz it is evident that there was a burial ground here as early as 1744. Burials were made here as late as the beginning of the nineteenth century. There now remain some sixteen monumental stones, of which only five or six are of marble. On a plain sandstone we have the initials “P. W. 1749” to the memory of the first Peter Wentz. An¬ other stone of the same material bears the initials “E. L. W.” and the date 1744 to the memory of Elizabeth, his wife. Mary, wife of Abraham Wentz, was the last personage deposited here. She died in 1803, aged 79. 1.

One of the most interesting relics of the Revolutionary period in Montgomery County is the old stone house in Worcester, where General Washington and his staff were the guests of Peter Wentz in October, 1777, when the American army was encamped in this vicinity. [Pennsyl¬ vania Magazine, Vol. XIV, p. 271-273 and p. 440, and Vol. XII, p. 203.] The house is of two stories, with a rear wing, and situate close to the north side of the road. In outward appearance it represents the better class of farm houses, a few of which are yet preserved from Colonial times. Its builder was a man of enterprise and of wealth exceeding that of most of his neighbors. Peter Wentz’s home was on the present road from Worcester to Lansdale, near Wentz’s Reformed Church, which is situated on Skippack Road nearly a mile above Center Point [now Worcester], Pa. [Theodore D. Bean, Escp, History of Montgomery County, p. 1185.] K 'nn£IL ■ HOME OF PETER WENTZ, 2nd Built 1758, Worcester, Pa. In 1745 Peter Wentz, Sr., made a will bequeathing, among other things, a messuage and tract of 300 acres to Peter Wentz, Jr. It was on this plantation that the stone house under consideration was built in 1758. The white marble date stone, measuring possibly ten by thirteen inches and bearing the initials of Peter Wentz and of his good wife Rosannah with the date 1758, is yet plainly visible high on the south wall of the main structure under the gable. W P & R 17 5 8 Besides these initials the builder piously caused this inscription in German to be rudely carved upon a rough- hewn slab of red sandstone, possibly two by two and a half feet in size, or larger, and set high on the south exterior wall of the ell : “PW RW Iesu Kom in Mein Haus Weighe Nimmer Mer Her Aus Kom Mit Deiner Gnaden Gut Und Stele Meinne sel Zu Fried 1758” which may be freely translated: Jesus come into my house And never depart; SECOND GENERATION 47 Come with Thy good grace And set my soul at peace. The house is built of well dressed blocks of red sand¬ stone still in splendid condition, larger and smoother than those in the house of his father, Peter Wentz, 1st. An in¬ spection of the interior of the house, the deep-set windows still perfectly true, the style of the wainscoting, the paneling of the doors, and the general finish, all indicate that this house was not only one of the most substantial, but also one of the most stylish in the township at that time. The iron knocker on the front door, a two-tier door with rat tail hinges and great hand-wrought lock and key, and old iron holders for shutters are still in use after nearly two cen¬ turies. The small antique panes have been replaced by those of modern construction. A portion of beautifully wrought iron fence remains, its date not known. , HOME OF PETER WENTZ, 2nd WORCESTER, PA. Upper left, Old Bake Oven; upper right, Home Showing Date Stone in Gable; lower left, Old Stone Trough; lower right, Monument to the Unknown Dead, Wentz's Church. ‘18 WENTZ The front portico and steps consist of huge stones about seven feet square and nearly a foot thick. These and a curious stone trough of the same peculiar material were probably brought from Germany by the Wentzes, as the stone is unlike any found anywhere around. The trough is of one piece, hewn out of solid rock with immense labor, it may be by cne of the Wentzes. Its original use is not known. At cne time it was used as a milk trough in the cellar, today it stands by the pump and serves as a water trough. It never needed repairing and promises to be as serviceable a century hence as it is today. Near the house is the old stone bake oven higher than a man’s head. The stone barn, also close to the highway, is to the northeast. The old mill, still standing, was built on the foundations of the first house of Peter Wentz, 2d. The farm finally passed out of the hands of Peter Wentz in 1784, when he sold it for £1000 to Dcvault Bieber. who sold it to Melchicr Schultz in 1794, since which time the buildings and farm lands attached have been the prop¬ erty of succeeding generations of the Schultz family.

John Farris’s book, Old Roads Out of Philadelphia, has quite an article on the Wentz heme and a picture of the house. Washington established his headquarters at Peter Wentz’s home October 16 and remained until October 21, 1777. Some cf the officers were quartered in Hans Sup- plee’s house, while Washington and his staff were the guests of Peter Wentz cn Skippack Creek. [Pennsylvania Magazine, Vol. 14, p. 271-273, 440; Vol. 12, p. 203.] - SECOND GENERATION 49 It appears that though Washington took possession, the owner, Peter Wentz, did not vacate the premises but remained, giving the General a portion of the house for his special use. Washington occupied two chambers in the west corner of the house. The one on the first floor is where he took his meals and he slept in a large square room of the second story. A door, not now in existence, then connected the dining room downstairs with a small kitchen, where his meals were prepared by his own cook. This kitchen was kept securely locked by the faithful cook, lest some Tory might obtain entrance and throw poison into the materials of the cookery. Among the provisions of the last will, 1826, of Rev. Melchior Schultz, who purchased the Wentz home, was one that his widow, Salome, should have for her use, during the remainder of her life, the kitchen and stove room adjoining the north end of his house, as well as the room in the second story called Washington’s room. Tradition relates that during Washington’s stay here one of the neighbors, Philip Stong, male bold to call on the Commander-in-Chief, bringing along his wife, Barbara. [Barbara Wentz, niece of Peter II, married Philip Stong.] Washington was so well pleased with his visitors that he invited them to supper, which they took socially together in the cozy west dining room. In after years old Barbara Strong, who lived at or near the present mill on Skippack Road, used to delight to relate her reminiscences of Wash¬ ington and this interesting episode of her youthful days. Among the traditions handed down is that when the cheering news of victory at Saratoga was received, the sol¬ diers in their joy fired a salute in such close proximity to the house where General Washington was quartered that the greater portion of the glass in the windows was shattered. During Washington’s stay in the old stone house of Peter Wentz a portion, at least, of the American soldiers were encamped in the woodland northeast of the dwelling. This then covered much land now cleared, including the later Jesse Yerger farm, then belonging to the Wentz prop- . 5pyv/ a Q'jrn 50 WENTZ erty. In the rear of where stands the barn on this farm, two soldiers are buried. Many musket and cannon balls, some rusty camp spades, and other relics testifying to the pres¬ ence of a Revolutionary army have from time to time been found in this vicinity. [Much of the foregoing account was taken from Ed¬ ward Matthews’ ‘The Old Washington Headquarters in Worcester,” The Montgomery Transcript of Skippack, Pa., No. 18, October 13, 1911.] In this connection, the following is quoted, in part, from a series of news articles widely published in the Mont¬ gomery County papers in 1927, by Edward W. Hocker, entitled, ‘‘On the Trail of Washington’s Army 150 Years After — No. 13, The Camp in Worcester”: “Washington’s financial accounts show payments to Peter Wentz on two different days. On October 4, £2, 10 shillings was paid “for butter and vege¬ tables.’’ This was the day of the battle of Germantown. Washington had left the house the night before, with the army, in the advance upon Germantown. Presumably on the retreat he stopped at the Wentz house long enough to pay the bill and gather up his belongings before proceeding on to the Perkiomen region. “On October 19, there was a payment of £7 13 shillings, 5 pence to Peter Wentz for food and £1, 2 shillings, 6 pence “extra for trouble.’' “No payment is noted for “use of the house,” as was customary at other houses which the commander occupied. It mayr be inferred from this that Peter Wentz was patriotic enough to give the use of his house without charge. “The first order issued in the new camp at Worcester directed the regiments to continue making cartridges every day and turn them in to the commissary of military stores.” There is much mention of Peter Wentz and his house [used by General Washington] and of Captain Abraham Wentz and other Wentzes in Brecht’s Genealogical Record of the Schwenkfelder Families, 1923. See Index. A copy of this book is in possession of the Lutheran Historical Society, January 15, 1930. In a letter written by Washington to Congress in ref¬ erence to the battle of Saratoga, he speaks of encamping in ■ .. . . - . » .... ,#f - «rf*i *1* SECOND GENERATION 51 the same spot before the battle of Germantown, but how long his stay there at that time is unknown. “Thursday October 16. At Headquarters, Wentz’s. . . .We moved this morn from the en¬ campment at which we had been for six or seven days past, and are just arrived at the grounds we occupied before the action of the fourth.” [Baker’s Itinerary of General Washington, 1892, p. 98; Pennsyl¬ vania Magazine, Vol. 14, p. 271; Bean’s History of Montgomery County, 1884, p. 1184 ]. The following letter, written by General Washington while still maintaining his Headquarters at the home of Peter Wentz, appears in the official publication of “Writings of Washington, Volume 9, page 391, Aug. 1777-Nov. 1777/’ [Congressional Library, Washington, D. C.] “To Brigadier General James Potter Head Quarters, PETER WENTZ’S 18th October, 1777. Dear Sir: I congratulate you upon the glorious Success of our Arms in the North, an account of which is enclosed. This singular favor of Providence is to be received with thank¬ fulness and the happy moment which Heaven has pointed out for the firm establishment of American Liberty ought to be embraced with becoming spirit; it is incumbent upon every man of influence in his Country to prevail upon the militia to take the field with that energy which the present crisis evidently demands. I have no doubt of yourself in this way. In the post which you now occupy you may ren¬ der the most important services of cutting off the enemies convoys and communications with their Fleet, for this purpose you shall strain every nerve; there is another thing which I would suggest and I leave you to judge of the practicability of it. I think that you might harass the parties of the enemy on Providence Island in such, a manner as to produce a great Diversion in favor of Fort Mifflin. Let me again entreat you and through your means every one of any influence among the Militia, to exert it to the utmost in exciting them to the field where by seasonable Reinforcements the glorious work we have in hand will be completed. I am Your most h’ble Servt Go Washington.” . 52 WENTZ History tells us that the American army was encamped in this vicinity both before and after the battle of German¬ town, which was fought October 4, 1777. “Germantown I Pa.], Battle of. — After the American defeat at Brandywine Creek and the British occupation of Philadelphia, Wash¬ ington determined to attack the mam body of Howe’s army, which was quartered in Germantown, a suburb of Philadelphia. The Ameri¬ can army was encamped at Skippack Creek twenty miles from Phila¬ delphia, and consisted of about 10,000 .... The battle opened at 7 a. m. on the fourth | of October, 1777 | . . . .After three hours of severe fighting the Americans were obliged to retreat .... Washington retired to his former camp and General Howe returned to Philadelphia.” I Messages and Papers of the Presidents, Vol. XIX. See Germantown]. “After the battle of Germantown, the British troops are said tc have pursued the soldiers as far north as the interior of Worcester Township, committing depredations of the property of the Wentz family which were so serious that Peter Wentz afterwards received £125 from the State as compensation.” | Genealogical Record of the Schwenkfelder Family, p. 943 See also Bean, History of Montgomery County, p. 180] It was from the encampment at Wentz’s church that Washington’s army attacked the British at Germantown. After the battle they retreated to the same location; Wash¬ ington maintained his headquarters at Peter Wentz’s from October 16 to 21, then led his army into Whitemarsh Town¬ ship, where he established Camp Hill. A letter from General Putnam announcing the capitu¬ lation of General Burgoyne is dated at Kingston, N. Y., 15th of October, 1777, 10 o’clock Wednesday evening. It reached headquarters — Peter Wentz’s — on the morning of October 18. . . .a distance of some 200 miles — bv horse ex- %/ press, or relays. . . .eleven hours a day. [Pennsylvania Magazine, Vol. 14, p. 272] Peter Wentz assisted in establishing American Inde¬ pendence while acting in the capacity of host to General Washington and his staff, October, 1777. Upon this record his descendants have joined the D.A.R. He may have been a soldier also.
