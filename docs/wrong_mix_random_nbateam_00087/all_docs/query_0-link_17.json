        "text": "NFL team season\n\nThe 2017 season was the San Francisco 49ers' 68th in the National Football League (NFL), their 72nd overall, their fourth playing their home games at Levi's Stadium and their first under the head coach/general manager tandem of Kyle Shanahan and John Lynch.\n\nAfter an 0–9 start, they won 6 of their last 7 games and finished the season 6–10, improving from their last two season records. Despite this, the 49ers were eliminated from playoff contention in Week 12.\n\nThe 49ers season largely turned around after they acquired quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo from the New England Patriots on October 30, 2017. At this point, the 49ers had a record of 0–8, dead last in the NFC. Garoppolo made his first start during Week 13 against the Chicago Bears and led them to a 15–14 win. Garoppolo won the final five games of the season for the 49ers, bringing the regular-season record to 6–10, the most wins by the team since the 2014 season. During the 5-game win streak, the 49ers won 3 straight games over teams that eventually made the playoffs (Weeks 15–17 against the Tennessee Titans, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Los Angeles Rams). From Weeks 1–12, the 49ers scored just 187 points (17 points per game), which was in the bottom half of the league. During the 5-game win streak, the 49ers offense scored 144 points (28.8 points per game). The highlight of the year was during Week 16, the 49ers scored 44 points against the Jacksonville Jaguars, who had the NFL's top scoring defense at the time, allowing just 14.9 points per game. The 49ers finished the season by being the only team in the NFL to go undefeated in the month of December. The 49ers also became the first team in NFL history to start a season 0–9 and finish with more than three wins.[1]\n\nOwner Jed York announced that he would hire a new general manager and the new head coach due to a bad season. On January 29, 2017, the 49ers hired John Lynch as their general manager.[2] On February 6, 2017, the 49ers hired Atlanta Falcons' offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan as the new coach of the San Francisco 49ers.[3]\n\nThe 49ers entered free agency with the following:[4]\n\nPosition Player Free agency\n\ntag Date signed 2017 Team Notes NT Glenn Dorsey UFA K Phil Dawson UFA March 10, 2017
