        "text": "The Seattle Seahawks’ decision to trade Russell Wilson this year without a clear replacement either intentionally or coincidentally exacerbated an uncomfortable situation in the quarterback room of the San Francisco 49ers. While I find it unlikely that Pete Carroll could have planned it out this perfectly, I’ve been saying this since March because I have never expected the Seahawks to make any acquisitions at the position that would out-rank Drew Lock or Geno Smith.\n\nThe two biggest names that I’ve suggested as one-year replacements were Jimmy Garoppolo and Jared Goff.\n\nWhile I know why many fans would scoff at the idea of either of those quarterbacks playing with the Seahawks, not because of NFC West rivalries, but because they clearly will not solve Seattle’s long-term need at the position. I have championed either acquisition because they clearly will not solve the Seahawks’ need to find a franchise quarterback.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks do not need a franchise quarterback this season. That would be a waste for the quarterback and for the franchise.\n\nThe Seahawks need a quarterback who won’t slow down the development of the wide receivers, running backs, tight ends, and offensive linemen who Seattle will need to be at their best in 2023 when the team finally acquires a franchise quarterback. That’s all that the Seahawks need and that’s why I’ve seen a Lock vs. Geno camp battle coming this whole time.\n\nHowever, as underwhelming as Garoppolo and Goff have been throughout their careers, they continue to be quarterbacks who have proven a lot more over the last five years to be capable of starting than either Lock or Geno. Goff and Shane Waldron spend four seasons together with the Los Angeles Rams and in that time he proved adept at avoiding sacks and turnovers, even sometimes when he was at his worst. I have never been a fan of Goff, but he does kind of make sense for the 2022 Seahawks.\n\nThey also would not owe Goff any money after this season.\n\nHowever, Goff also makes a lot of sense for the 2022 Detroit Lions and I no longer expect the team to trade him. I believe the Lions will trade or release Jared Goff in 2023, saving $20.65 million in the process and completing a deal before his $5 million roster bonus is paid, setting themselves up to draft a quarterback in the first round.\n\nWell more interesting than that is the situation in San Francisco, as the 49ers should hold legitimate concerns that if they don’t release Jimmy Garoppolo, it will cause turmoil in the locker room at the cost of $24 million that they could really use right now. And if they do release Garoppolo, he might choose to play for the Seahawks and vow to help Seattle win 17 of their last 19 against the 49ers.\n\nAnd yes Garoppolo is bad. But how dare anybody sit there and tell me that the Seahawks should trade for Gardner Minshew, sign Colin Kaepernick, sign Ryan Fitzpatrick, or even start one of Lock/Smith and also have the audacity to argue that Seattle must avoid Jimmy Garoppolo “because he’s bad.”\n\nNo, sorry, you don’t get to play that card.\n\nComing up:\n\nGaroppolo’s stellar record against the Rams and why it matters\n\nWhat every other team did to fill their needs at QB while 49ers twiddled thumbs\n\nWhy Mike Florio is flat-out WRONG about Texans-Garoppolo\n\nHow much will Garoppolo make AFTER he takes a pay cut (which he will)\n\nJeremy Fowler continues to spread gossip instead of reporting actual news at the Disneyland Corporation’s Sports Division\n\nHating players because of division rivals is fun, but shouldn’t get in the way of actually doing something that would be good for your team and bad for your rivals"
