        "text": "2. The avalanche of success experienced over the past two years by Island Records group Fall Out Boy—Patrick Stump (vocals/guitar), Pete Wentz (bass), Joe Trohman (guitar) and Andy Hurley (drums)—has been and continues to be an industry phenomenon. It began in 2005 with the release of From Un- der the Cork Tree, their major label debut on Island, which has sold more than 3 mil- lion copies worldwide. Three hit singles and videos kept the album on the Billboard 200 chart for 72 weeks: “Sugar, We’re Going Down” (which went to number one on MTV’s TRL and won the coveted MTV2 Award for 2005), “Dance, Dance” (winner of 2006’s MTV VMA Viewers Choice Award) and “Sixteen Candles.” They also received a 2006 Grammy nomination in the highly competitive “Best New Artist” cate- gory. Fall Out Boy’s position at the top of the pops has enabled its leader and spokesman, Wentz (who is also the band’s lyricist), to stretch his wings on a number of interesting outside projects. Clandestine Industries was born in 2004 when The Boy With the Thorn In His Side was published. A journey through the twisted subconscious of a younger Pete Wentz, the book has sold more than 10,000 copies. Insiders are awaiting publication of his second book, Rainy Day Kids. Wentz is also at the helm of Decaydence, an active front-line label in association with Fueled By Ramen. In addition to Fall Out Boy, other bands under the Decaydence and Fueled By Ramen banner include MTV VMA winners Panic! At the Disco (who were signed off their MySpace page), Gym Class Heroes, the Hush Sound, the Academy Is … and Cobra Starship (details online at www.decaydence.com). As if all this weren’t enough to keep Wentz busy, he also has an independent produc- tion company and runs his own one-man DJ company—Hemingway Wentz Inc.—named after his dog, Hemingway!\n\n3. Squir Behold the totally sweet new Squier e Ge Pete Wentz Precision Bass guitar. It’s all sleek and black and stuff, and ar it’s loaded with cool features—most notably special graphics that include Pete’s own red bat/heart design on the body, plus a black bat/diamond fingerboard inlay at the 12th fret and Wentz’s signature on the back of the headstock. he Squier® Black & Chrome P Bass Special is a limited-edition model with an edgy and classy appeal. Fea- tures include a gloss black finish with matching headstock, and pick- guards and hardware with that sought-after chrome look. This P Bass is an amazing value, designed and backed by Fender®! Since its introduction in 1951, the Fender Precision Bass guitar has dramatically influenced the way we play and hear music. In the booming half-century since, the Precision has affected almost every imaginable genre of popular music. Our American Vintage ’57 Precision Bass pays tribute to this landmark instrument with accurate detailing, including electronics and hard- ware—from the split single-coil pickups to the vintage tuning ma- chines and nitrocellulose lacquer fin- ish. A true Fender classic."
