        "text": "Pete Wentz\n\nPETE WENTZ’S BABY HAS A LOT TO LIVE UP TO\n\nMusician Pete Wentz and Meagan Camper are having a healthy lunch with their son Saint. Yes, his name is Saint. (Full name: Saint Lazslo Wentz) We wonder if this name is in response to parents who’ve named their kids “Prince” or “Countess.” It’s one step further. But will little Saint find his name desirable when he’s in school and subject to rude comments? Hopefully, Saint will have a strong personality and a sense of humor.\n\nPhoto Credit: AKM-GSI\n\nPETE WENTZ AND HIS ALMOST MINI-ME\n\nPete Wentz took his lanky girlfriend Meagan Camper shopping at The Grove, along with his little boy Bronx, whose mother is Ashlee Simpson. Bronx has his daddy’s face along with the Simpson family’s trademark blonde hair.\n\nPhoto Credit: Pacific Coast News\n\nASHLEE SIMPSON WANTS HER EX PETE WENTZ TO KNOW SHE HAS MOVED ON\n\nAshlee Simpson’s divorce from musician Pete Wentz isn’t final yet, but she’s already moved on in a big way. She and her new boyfriend Vincent Piazza, who plays Lucky Luciano on Boardwalk Empire, have gone public with their romance. Pete’s not faring as well – Ashlee ordered him to find his own apartment and for some reason, she no longer wants their son Bronx to return from visits with daddy wearing nail polish.\n\nPETE WENTZ: A FLAT IRON CAN BE YOUR BEST FRIEND\n\nPhoto Credit: Buzz Foto\n\nPete Wentz came to his senses and straightened his hair again after experimenting with a natural curly look that did nothing to win back his estranged wife Ashlee Simpson. Ashlee is happier now, as is illustrated by the fact that the separated couple is spending more and more time together. Of course her father Joe Simpson is trying to sell a reality show about Ashlee as a single mom, so that throws a wrench in the works. Above left, Pete’s looking hotter and more rock-starish again and Ashlee has noticed. (Pete’s t-shirt says “Without You It’s just Me”)\n\nWAS OUT MAGAZINE THE BEGINNING OF THE END FOR ASHLEE SIMPSON AND PETE WENTZ?\n\nPregnant Ashlee Simpson was not thrilled when her new husband Pete Wentz announced on the cover of OUT magazine in 2008 “Yeah, I am a fag!” He seemed to be drumming up some notoriety for himself by admitting that he had made out with guys and had a crush on John Mayer. An insider revealed to us that Ashlee has been frustrated because she complained she hasn’t had sex with her husband since last summer. He was always too busy or just not interested. It made her think back to that magazine cover and wonder…..next thing you know, she filed for divorce.\n\nASHLEE’S DIVORCING: NOW JESSICA IS THE LUCKY SIMPSON SISTER\n\nPhoto Credit: Buzz Foto\n\nWhen Ashlee Simpson married her rockstar boyfriend Pete Wentz in 2008, it seemed like she had everything – at least that’s how it looked to her sister Jessica. Not only was Ashlee married with a baby, but she’d has plastic surgery and looked pretty and THIN. But while Ashlee’s career took a nosedive, Jessica’s blossomed and she was soon earning 50 million dollars a year from licensing. Ashlee just couldn’t get an endorsement deal or an acting gig. Funny how things turn around. Now Jessica Simpson is loaded and she’s happily engaged to Eric Johnson. Ashlee is divorcing Pete (we don’t know exactly why, yet, but it will be revealed, and it won’t be pretty) and she’s asking for spousal and child support.\n\nASHLEE AND PETE WENTZ PARTIED WITH BRONX AT THE U.S. OPEN\n\nPhoto Credit: Buzz Foto\n\nAshlee and Pete Wentz and their son Bronx were in the audience at the US Open this weekend and Ashlee was seen drinking a lot of SOMETHING. She became very animated during the Roger Federer match and did some noisy socializing and laughing and ended up on Pete’s lap. Afterward, she was loopy and tired. Pete took charge and balanced Bronx – who’s growing up fast- while he carefully guided tipsy Ashlee home via taxi to their hotel.\n\nPETE WENTZ FLASHED HIS “SITUATION” AT LAX\n\nAre the security people at LAX requiring passengers to show their abs now? Ashlee Simpson’s husband Pete Wentz gave other travelers an eyeful whether they liked it or not, when he pulled off his clothing for security check in. It’s not the first time Pete has revealed his assets- nude photos of him circulated on the internet in 2006 – he had foolishly sent them to a girlfriend.\n\nPETE WENTZ AND HIS BRAND SPANKING NEW LEATHER OUTFIT\n\nPete Wentz missed the mark in his leather outfit at the AMA’s. The military/ dominatrix black leather look was not a bad idea, but everything was just too crisp shiny, stiff, and brand-new. Rockers should look a little beat up – scuffed and distressed. We imagine the bottoms of his boots are still clean. The perfect shiny look is just too Hot Topic. HE looks cute, though."
