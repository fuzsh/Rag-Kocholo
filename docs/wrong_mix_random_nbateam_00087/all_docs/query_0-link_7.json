In those thirty years he has worked in nearly every function in Child Welfare, including Emergency Response, Hotline, Permanency, Sex Trauma, Court Dependency and Family Services. He has supervised the Hotline, Emergency Response and is currently supervising Non-Court Family Maintenance, which is a front-end program which attempts to keep families with chronic CPS involvements from re-entering the Dependency System.\n\nEarly in his work with families, Dan realized that fathers were often missing in Dependency cases. Domestic violence was often an issue in families that encountered CPS, but curiously, fathers were frequently treated as disinterested parties in their children’s lives, and typically as an impediment to mothers in delivering care to their children. In the late 90s while working in the Sex Trauma Unit, Dan began doing outreach to community based agencies working with domestic violence—WOMENS Inc, ManAlive, POCOVI, CARACEN, in an attempt to better understand the interplay between inter-familial violence and child welfare. Fortuitously, this involvement happened at the same as the Federal government was creating a demonstration project, The Greenbook, for better addressing domestic violence in child abuse cases. San Francisco in working with its community partners wrote a proposal for the Greenbook and was one of seven jurisdictions funded with a $3 million grant. Dan has lectured on the interface between Child Welfare and Community based DV agencies at UC Berkeley’s School of Law and elsewhere.\n\nDespite the progress made through the work of the Greenbook Project, which sought to improve women’s right to self-determination in Child Welfare cases, it still treated fathers as secondary in the support of children. In his role as supervisor in Non-Court Family Maintenance, Dan has done further outreach to fathers in the hope of better understanding the alienation of fathers from their children through the Child Welfare system. In listening to the generational stories of men talking about their fathers, Dan is working to humanize Child Welfare for fathers. That work attempts to build community around fathers and reduce the isolation that perpetuates helplessness and anger.Dan has lectured on fatherhood with community leaders and attorneys in state-wide conferences and in the community.\n\nMichael Prichard\n\nMichael Prichard M.S., LAADC been involved in the Substance Use Disorder counseling profession for 9 years.
