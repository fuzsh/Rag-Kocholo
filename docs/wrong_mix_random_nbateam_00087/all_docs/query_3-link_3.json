        "text": "It is time to go out and explore Whistler. This past week ended the rain cycle that has been tormenting Whistler for the past two or three weeks. Since Friday we have seen sun and temperatures hovering around zero degrees. The upper alpine has about an inch of dust on a nice crusty layer in shady spots. Rain runnels are prevalent on the glaciers as well as across the mountain […]\n\nFor the last two weeks I have been traveling to Denver and Munich for SIA and ISPO ski tradeshows. During this time I got to wonder and check out all of the gear coming out for next winter and talks about future trends in snowsports. These shows are always an awesome mix of ski and snowboard industry people all there to have a good time and stoked on riding.\n\nDuring my travels, I was hearing and seeing on media outlets and weather forecasts that Whistler was getting pounded with rain. I was a little bit scared to come back and see what the mountain\n\nToday was super fun up on the mountain. Some new snow and little crowds on Monday made for some nice laps. I went to Blackcomb in the morning as they normally get things open quicker. I went up Glacier and saw a big line up for Spankys as they had not dropped the rope yet. I then decided to traverse over to Chimney and found that not many people had been over their yet. By the time I got back to the top of Glacier Spankys was open and fresh. The snow today was firm dense powder. You would glide on top of it most of the time, but the depth was there when you slashed or came upon a nice wind loaded area […]\n\nSince last week in Whistler, not much has happened. After the rain hit the alpine, it has remained mainly cold on the upper mountain. The upper mountain has received a couple centimeters of new snow in the past couple days freshening things up and making for some smooth sections off of Glacier. I had a good time skiing down the glacier as it remained fairly soft. A couple runs on Spankey’s was fun as well. As long as you pieced together the smooth sections and stayed away from the chunder it was pretty fun. But as soon as came across another track, you would find an ice-sheet and some difficult riding […]\n\nThis morning was awesome up in Whistler. The recent storm has brought in around 44cm of snow on the mountain making for some of the deepest snow of the year so far. The weekend was crowded with as it was the last weekend of the holiday season for most. On Monday the crowds seemed to dissipate a bit, however there were still some lines at the lifts as locals looked to get the goods.\n\nOn Monday, I started the day by doing a couple of Jersey laps. Things were super fun in the morning as the snow was deep. This recent storm opened up a lot of terrain on the mountain […]\n\nWith Christmas behind us and the start of a new year ahead, Whistler is looking good. For the last week it has stayed cold up on the mountain keeping things fresh and soft, even without any recent snowfall. The wind has been blowing making for some nice wind loaded areas, and a few ice patches. Snow is variable all over the mountain because of this.\n\nIt has been completely sunny for the last few days making for some awesome skiing. You can go anywhere on the mountain as everything […]\n\nThe biggest storm of the winter so far just rolled through Whistler dropping over 70cm over the last week. It really felt like winter up in the mountains this weekend as the storm came in and freshened up and filled in much of the terrain. The storm made for some awesome skiing conditions with powder in most areas in the morning, and terrain getting skied off later in the day. Even later though it was still really good soft, chopped up snow due to constant cold temperatures up high […]\n\nThis past weekend at Whistler Blackcomb, the alpine opened! People were very excited to get up and into the upper mountain with some fresh snow and good coverage. Saturday was when the Alpine opened with Glacier and 7th Heaven running on Blackcomb. On Whistler Peak and Harmony were open for periods on the weekend. The snow up high was insanely good, as things looked more covered in certain areas than they were late January of last year. Heavy snowfall on Thursday and Friday pasted the mountains with a fresh blanket of nice dense snow that covered up a lot of the upper mountain rocks […]"
