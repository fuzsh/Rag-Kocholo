        "text": "The 2003 film School of Rock recently inspired a musical and now it’s getting a weekly TV version, which premieres on Nickelodeon on Saturday following the Kids’ Choice Awards. As Billboard reports, each episode will feature a cast cover song and the story arc features Fall Out Boy‘s Pete Wentz, who stars in two episodes. Jack Black, who starred in the film as Dewey Finn, is not on the TV show. The Groundlings’ Tony Cavalero stars as Finn.\n\nIn an interview with Billboard, Wentz discussed playing the role of Dewey Finn’s pal. “I’ve never really done stuff with younger actors before and the energy level is off the charts,” he said. “It’s like hanging out with little espresso shots.”\n\nWentz turns 37 this year, but as he told Rolling Stone in a recent interview, when he’s at school assemblies for his kids, “I’m on the young side of parents there.”\n\nIn School of Rock, Wentz plays a rocker who is conflicted about Finn’s new young band. “He thinks it’s silly that Dewey is now playing with these kids in a band, but you can tell he’s a little bit jealous,” Wentz told Billboard. “He offers a view into what Dewey’s life used to be like and there’s a character arc where he changes a little as it goes on.”\n\nTrending\n\nWentz said he was attracted to the part because he likes the film “and it’s always fun to do something my kids can watch, too.”"
