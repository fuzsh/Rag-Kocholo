Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy and Kim Kardashian go way back in the scene. Around the time of season one of Keeping Up with the Kardashian’s airing, Wentz and Kardashian made out in the music video “Thnks fr the Mmrs.” Remember that?

Well, now it seems the two have interacted once again due to a hilarious internet mix up involving Kim K. and Kanye West‘s landscaper.

Fall Out Boy are gearing up for the Hella Mega Tour with Weezer and Green Day later this year, but it seems Pete Wentz is keeping pretty busy. Perhaps the bassist for Fall Out Boy just really wants to pursue his other passions.

It began when Architectural Digest was doing a story on the Kardashian/West home. Kim K. posted two pictures with the caption “Peter Wertz landscaping.”

Do you know what Peter Wertz looks like if you’re casually scrolling through Twitter? Pete Wentz. Naturally, the internet took this mixup and ran with it. Check out some great reactions below.

Pete Wentz himself even got in the joke with the simple response “Side hustle.”

We can never count out the internet when it comes to something like this. Just recently, Wentz and Patrick Stump made an appearance on The Price Is Right where Pete got a perfect spin on the big wheel and they modeled some barware.
