Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz has rocked a sale on his Spanish-style home in Encino, California. The musician accepted a $2,262,500 offer in mid-September after listing the property for $2,395,000 in June.

Wentz bought the home located in the San Fernando Valley’s posh Amestoy Estates in 2015 for $1,965,000. Originally built in 1958, the residence underwent a major renovation and expansion in 2009.

The spacious home sits on a half-acre lot and has five bedrooms and 4.5 baths.

“The home is a single story, so it really lives bigger than the 4,100 square feet,” says Thomas Atamian of Compass, who co-listed the property with Deedee Howard of The Agency.

The place features an open floor plan, combining the living room, dining room, media alcove and kitchen with light and ease.

Wood floors, beamed ceilings and arched windows and doorways emphasize the Spanish style.

The kitchen is now decked out with custom cabinetry, granite countertops and stainless-steel appliances.

The grounds are described as “perfect for entertainment,” according to Atamian. The gate and walls offer privacy factor, but it’s the amenities that turn the fun factor up to 11.

“The backyard even has a zip line setup in the back, a sport court, pool, and grass area,” he adds.
