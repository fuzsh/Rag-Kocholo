Niklas Luhmann is a legend in the world of note-taking.

He is a German sociologist who wrote more than 70 books and nearly 400 academic articles about many topics like economy, politics, law, art and love. It is even said that he never had writerâ€™s block.

So, what made him such a prolific writer?

The secret to his productivity is his unique knowledge management system called Zettelkasten. I already explained it in a video, but, in a nutshell, he used index cards to take notes.

There are different types of notes in his method, but the most important one is permanent notes, which are also known as evergreen notes.

Whenever he read a book or an article, he wrote down his thoughts or what he learned in his own words on an index card, some of which became his evergreen note.
