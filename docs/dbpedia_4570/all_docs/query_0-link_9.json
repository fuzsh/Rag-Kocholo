        "text": "There are no social systems without communication. The communication communicates. To produce and reproduce themselves, social systems theory adopts the term autopoiesis and broadens its frame of reference to communications that reproduce based on other communications and thus establish the unity of the system.\n\nEvery autopoietic system is identified by operational closure, meaning that the processes leading to the generation of new elements in the system depend on earlier operations within the same system. Simultaneously, these operations serve as prerequisites for subsequent ones, emphasizing self-reference.\n\nMass media, the economy, law, and politics operate under different logics and rationales. Each system, like a biological organism, is geared towards the reproduction of itself to continue its operations.\n\nIn the political system, for instance, one election leads to another. In mass media, the cycle of stories is to be continued. Individuals within these systems are conditioned to systemic roles: the journalist seeks out information, and the politician has power. From an interviewee questioned by a news anchor to a defendant in court, in each role, their actions are not understood as sovereign but as options within the respective system.\n\nDifferent systems operate differently and clash with one another based on the incongruity between the systems of politics, economy, science, and mass media. Scientists intend to communicate truths about the world according to the binary code true/untrue, while mass media does not follow the aforementioned code; in its program, it follows the code of information/non-information (Luhmann, 2017: 52). Simultaneously, corporations want to earn money according to the code paid/unpaid, while politicians seek to attain favorable voting outcomes under the logic of the code power/powerless.\n\nThis gives rise to conflict between social systems and the respective individuals within them. Considering the distinction between the economic system and the ecological domain, there arises a divergence in communication, which results in a fundamental misalignment.\n\nAs the economic system races forward, propelled by its self-contained logic, the ecological domain suffers the consequences of its neglect.\n\nThe economic system may incorporate ecological considerations into its operations, but only through translating them into economic terms. This translation inevitably reduces the complexity of ecological phenomena as they are assimilated into the economic system’s binary code. From the perspective of the economic system, the ecological domain can only be thematized via the medium of money, and consequently, its prescriptions or operations affecting ecology, such as global warming, cannot be fully comprehended by the system, causing these very effects. Hereto, it can be further considered how the ecological crisis emerges according to the dynamics of other social systems such as the political system, hereunder its operations and logic, and how the medium of power, in its way, thematizes ecology.\n\nThe complex evolution of social pathologies is seldom contingent on one social system but requires a complex analysis of social dynamics.\n\nConsidering the opioid epidemic in the USA, research in pharmaceutical science, business interests of big pharma, media advertisements, prescriptions via the medical systems, criminal gangs procuring opiates, the political reactions to the crisis, and the legal system against crime, or even the pharmaceutical corporations, point towards a complex evolution of the opiate epidemic, factoring in different systems.\n\nSociety is constituted by a complex array of social systems, from law to mass media. Within these systems—economic, political, mass media, and more—different opportunities arise regarding business, power, and information. From the view of each system, whether mass media or economic, reality differs, and individual’s systemic roles within are conditioned. Lawyers sue pharmaceutical corporations; pharmaceutical corporations distribute medicine, while doctors prescribe to treat patients. Society is constituted by a complex array of social systems, from law to mass media. In this regard, Luhmann’s concept of functional differentiation is relevant in describing the division of society into different systems, such as the legal, political, or economic system.\n\nOn a fundamental level, society is constituted by different systems. These systems carry out a specific function, and that is why they are considered functional systems. Each system enables functions in society; the political system carries out the function of making collective decisions, while the legal system carries out the function of determining the legality of an action. Functional differentiation is a characteristic of modern society; the transition from stratified differentiation to functional differentiation is estimated by Luhmann to occur between the 16th and 18th centuries.\n\nIn feudal societies, the hierarchical levels, like aristocrats, priests, and farmers, entailed stratified differentiation, in which society was defined by different strata. Prior to modernity, social strata organised the structure of society, in which people were either craftsmen or aristocrats, and subsequently, the strata conditioned people’s roles and actions. Fast forward to today, and what people do or avoid is conditioned by the function of social systems. As we scroll on Instagram, we are concerned with the information we consume. In the legal system, there is a legal framework to determine legality. Corporations in the economic system seek profit, and voters in the political system decide where to place their votes.\n\nAccording to their different functions, social systems are distinguished in the way in which they communicate, applying different media: money in the economic system, power in the political system, truth in the scientific system, and information in mass media. Each of these systems communicates via different codes.\n\nThe legal system concerns itself with the binary code of legal/illegal, while the economic system is built around the code of paid/unpaid. The systems’ communication revolves around its binary code and its consequent function. Consequently, the code of the system enables the production and communication of the same kind to reproduce themselves endlessly. This is referred to as autopoiesis. The codes described distinguish systems from one another, and subsequently, the systems can obtain operational closure.\n\nFor a system to remain, it requires continued communication. When you pay for a coffee at a cafe, it is understood as a payment for the product or service, not a declaration of who you will vote for or the legality of a given action. If one were to regard the payment as a declaration of legality, that would be a violation of the operational closure of systems and consequently described as a misunderstanding.\n\nSystems therefore make up boundaries within society, but systems are simultaneously cognitively open to one another, implying that systems can thematize or communicate about other systems. Journalists, in mass media, can inform the masses on the latest political election, while academics can theorise about law, media, and the economy. The law also regulates what is legally permitted for corporations in the economic system or mass media organisations. Systems are continuously irritated by the environment surrounding them and monitor other systems.\n\nStructural coupling can further be observed between systems. Each system observes the other functional systems in its environment, often entailing interdependencies between functional systems. Considering taxation, there emerges a structural coupling of the political and economic systems, where both the medium of money and power are involved.\n\nThe economic system cannot directly communicate with the political system, nor can law and mass media communicate with one another.\n\nWhen speaking of the structural coupling of systems, it must be noted that systems cannot directly translate money from power or law to information; as the concept explains, relationships between systems are not one-to-one direct communication with one another. Consequently, the economic system cannot directly communicate with the political system, nor can law and mass media communicate with one another. What the systems can do is observe their environment, interact with other functional systems, and engage in interdependencies and structural coupling.\n\nConsidering the purchase of a house, for instance, the legal and economic systems are coupled via the legal concepts of contracts and property, but also via the medium of money according to the economic system. Another example related to mass media and social media could be the structural coupling via the advertisement-based model on Facebook in view of the economic system, the evening news in relation to the political system, or the art system, which serves entertainment purposes. Sports teams, for instance, Manchester United, can also exemplify structural coupling, where the football club's business operations, such as buying and selling players, to a certain extent work in symbiosis with sports performance; hereto, other systems, such as the mass media, may play a significant role.\n\nLuhmann, who labelled himself a radical constructivist, describes social reality, such as money or law, as constructed. Contrary to what one may assume, this does not point towards anti-realism, but instead that things that are constructed, such as law in the legal system, are indeed valid according to a systems theoretical analysis. But at the same time, construction can be reconstructed or deconstructed. Drawing parallels to Darwin’s evolutionary theory concerned with biological reality, Luhmann formulates a theory of social evolution within social reality.\n\nUnlike the popular notion of individual agents, like Locke or Napoleon being the primary drivers of social metamorphosis, Luhmann points towards system-environment dynamics in his theory of social evolution, similar to how biological evolution occurs between the organism and environment. In this view, functional systems such as law or economy were not intelligently designed by one god or a select few noteworthy philosophers. Instead, these systems have evolved throughout history. Similar to biological evolutionary processes, which occur by themselves via the dynamics of organisms and the environment, social reality unfolds on its own accord through communication.\n\nEven though, in society, human agents exercise decisions in regards to the general economy or political policy, humans are not considered masters within the system. Just like humans have not been masters of their biological evolution (so far). Every decision within a system causes an array of unpredictable effects, and every decision generates the need for more decisions. Given the operations of numerous systems and the environment, the effects everything has on everything else are out of control.\n\nContrary to the Enlightenment ideal of placing mankind in an infinite line of social progress, leading to more self-control and enhancing rationality and agency, systems theory suggests quite the opposite. As society evolves, complexity increases.\n\nGiven the multiple effects everything has on each other, from the system to the environment, mankind is not in control. In this regard, the evolution of society entails more complexity and less control. Unlike many well-known political theories that conceptualise the idea of the sovereign agent, social systems theory takes on what can be categorised as an anti-humanist approach. This label by itself appears pessimistic, as if Luhmann were against human beings themselves.\n\nTherefore, it must be asserted that this is not the case. Transitioning towards an anti-humanist approach, a radical constructivist concept of society, Luhmann denies the assumption held throughout a vast body of work throughout Western philosophy that society merely consists of individual human beings and the relations in between. Both the left-wing and right-wing have adopted ideals of human agency, from social justice theories to the autonomy and productivity of the sovereign individual in liberal society.\n\nLuhmann’s systems theory runs contrary to the fundamental humanistic premise of many theories from both political spectrums in North America and Europe. This has possibly contributed to the diminished popularity of his somewhat counterintuitive systems theory. Despite the backlash to this anti-humanism, Luhmann himself is neither pessimistic nor against the well-being of human beings. Just as there is a biological evolution, there is within society a range of autopoietic systems, wherein humans are not ultimately in control but instead fulfil a systemic role.\n\nIn these systems, scientists strive to construct, or uncover, more accurate truths within academia, and in the economy, corporations seek to develop economic value and profits. But what is considered an improvement within the operations of the economic system does not necessarily go for the political system. Taking on this theoretical perspective, in a differentiated society, there is no perfect discursive consensus to be arrived at, for what is better from a political perspective is not necessarily better from a legal or economic standpoint.\n\nDespite the attempts of certain social scientists to arrive at a perfect epistemological view from the top, according to systems theory, there is no view of God’s eye, no top, side, or external perspective that is perfectly calibrated for societal analysis.\n\nFollowing this line of argumentation, the complexity of society implies that there is no ultimate system—whether political, scientific, or economic—that can formulate an optimal outcome for everything. Social systems are communication and function systems, but they also observe. Drawing parallels to Kant, who argued reason, or mind, affects how the world appears to people, Luhmann applies this idea not to reason but to society, in which reality is formed by the observations—and communication—of functional systems. The economy observes a commodity or real estate and thereby constructs its values according to its observation and communication.\n\nSince there are different modes of observation, a wide range of social realities emerge at the same time.\n\nSimultaneously, the legal system observes buyer-seller contract agreements and house ownership, whether it is a legal or illegal occupation. Since there are different modes of observation, a wide range of social realities emerge at the same time. The observations of the economy or law are no more real than the observations of mass media or science. Depending on what is observed and by which system, similar social phenomena, such as buying real estate, appear as a different reality, according to the system and its ground logic.\n\nWhen speaking of observation, Luhmann points out that modern society has adopted a specific form of observation. This mode is referred to as second-order observation: to observe the observation of others. On a personal level, second-order observation can be exemplified via the curation of an Instagram profile, in which the user is concerned with how he is seen.\n\nWhen using any form of social media, people are continuously engaged with the mode of second-order observations: how many liked a post, what the comments say, or how other people will observe my profile. Here, people can engage in the mode of second-order observation. The same goes for looking at reviews for a restaurant or vacation spot and observing the observations of others to make a decision. Within the economic system, market value is another example of second-order observation. One does not merely calculate the value of a house based on materials, labour time, and square metres. Instead of counting the value of each brick, if one wants to estimate the price of a house, one considers the housing market, observing how the houses are economically observed by others. And by observing the economic observations of others in the housing market, one can arrive at the approximate value of the house.\n\nThroughout every social system, second-order observation is increasing, as commodities or political candidates are observed, rated, and ranked. Movies and YouTube videos are ranked and can inform decision-making processes. Comments and likes, similarly, lead to this mode of observation. The service at restaurants or the popularity of a political candidate is observed according to what others observe via online reviews and statistical polls.\n\nCVs, profiles on LinkedIn, or even the notion of the “picturesque” observe how others would observe a photo of the environment; all make up examples of second-order observation. In modern society, systems and people are constantly in the mode of second-order observation, or how one wants to be seen as seen, or observing observations. In mass media, the content is always displayed as it is seen by the observations of someone else. This text, to you, is an observation of my observations of Luhmann."
