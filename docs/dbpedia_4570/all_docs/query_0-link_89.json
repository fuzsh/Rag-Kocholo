        "text": "Received this yesterday. It’s a 1987 collection of interviews with German sociologist Niklas Luhmann, on the occasion of his 60th birthday. I bought it after I saw Chris Aldrich sharing some annotations.\n\nStarted exploring. The context is important to take into account. 1980s Germany, after ’68 and before the Wall came down, the contrast between Habermas and Luhmann while both being ‘famous’ in left and intellectual circles at the same time.\n\nAre you a maker, a creator of technology? Sign the TechPledge! Commit to human centered tech and continuous reflection on the impact of your work.\n\nI helped shape the TechPledge, and signed on September 10th 2019. Hold me to account."
