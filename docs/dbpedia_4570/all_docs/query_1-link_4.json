Up to 80 percent of the population says this (probably higher among us coaches, speakers, consultants and experts, right?) - but only ONE percent actually DO get their book done and out there. üåüWhat if you knew that getting your book written would eliminate the frustration of feeling lost in the crowd, struggling to enroll clients, and wondering why people are not taking you more seriously in the marketplace? That is exactly what is possible when you write your book with our unique approach this year. After writing 29 books myself, I have developed a shortcut to the book writing process that not only shortens the time it takes to finish your book, but creates other assets along the way. (And it's NOT based on AI - though we strategically use AI at the points when it makes sense.) The result? You end up getting paid for writing the book, even without getting a royalty advance from a big publisher. (And, of course, as a first time author, it is practically unheard of to get such a deal anyway.) Curious? ‚ùáÔ∏èJoin my NEW masterclass coming up this Thursday entitled, ‚ÄúElevate Your Impact and Income by Becoming a Published Author!‚Äù to learn more! I can't wait to share with you how your business can get lit on FIRE once you become published. üéâüéâ Just comment ‚Äúauthor‚Äù below for the registration link (and check out how that feels to say about YOU!).\n\nI'm a writer at heart, so I'm excited to share one of my latest projects: a new blog! My blog, Be Astonished, is a humble exploration of, what I believe, are some of the most interesting questions related to the human mind and the nature of our existence. It won't answer your questions, but it will hopefully get you thinking via bite-sized investigations into big categories of thought. Visit the blog at the link below. (Just hit \"No thanks\" to see the blog without subscribing.) You'll find a few posts waiting for you ‚Äî and more to come. Upcoming topics will include: the puzzle of consciousness, our impending crisis of disillusionment, the power of journaling, the minimalist revolution, privacy in the digital era, technology's influence on our attention, finding purpose, and more. If this line of thought interests you, I'd love for you to subscribe to get each new post sent to your inbox (it's free and means so much). https://lnkd.in/eAm65FCr\n\nIn this insightful video, Matt explains why many thought leaders hesitate to start their journey towards authorship, often bogged down by uncertainties around what to write, how to structure their book, and the daunting task of promotion.
