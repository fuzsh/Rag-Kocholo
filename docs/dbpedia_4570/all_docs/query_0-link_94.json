Current modern society is, for Luhmann, a functionally differentiated society, which means that a number of specialized societal sub-systems (politics, economics, religion, law, science, art etc) have formed.\n\nEach system is based on its own type of communication led by its own generalized communicative media. Luhmann controversially depicts modern society as a plurality of many societal subsystems operating without a top and without a coordinating and managing centre.\n\nThis book weighs the strong and weak features of the systemic approach in sociology and discusses ways to rethink it.\n\nAuthor\n\nJiří Šubrt is associate professor of sociology at Charles University, Czech republic, Prague. In 2009, he founded the Department of Historical Sociology at the Faculty of Humanities, which he still heads. He summarized his views on historical sociology in the book The Perspective of Historical Sociology: The Individual as Homo-Sociologicus Through Society and History (Emerald 2017). In the book Individualism, Holism and the Central Dilemma of Sociological Theory, he deals with the issue of sociological theory (Emerald 2019)."
