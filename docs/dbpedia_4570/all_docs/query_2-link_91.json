It is even said that he never had writer’s block.\n\nSo, what made him such a prolific writer?\n\nThe secret to his productivity is his unique knowledge management system called Zettelkasten. I already explained it in a video, but, in a nutshell, he used index cards to take notes.\n\nThere are different types of notes in his method, but the most important one is permanent notes, which are also known as evergreen notes.\n\nWhenever he read a book or an article, he wrote down his thoughts or what he learned in his own words on an index card, some of which became his evergreen note."
