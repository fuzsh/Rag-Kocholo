        "text": "The following is a precis, including quotes, from the MotorSport magazine of the June 2000, Vol 76, number 6\n\nThe Porsche WSC95 that won Le Mans with Joest in 1996-97 was built around the same chassis as the Jaguar XJR-14 in which Teo Fabi claimed the drivers' honours in the 1991 World Sports Prototype Championship.\n\nIn July 1994, the only car in the Valparaiso workshop in America was an old XJR-14. Tony Dowe imagined that it would make a good car for the IMSA WSC class, so telephoned Porsche USA boss Alwin Springer requesting an engine. He took some photo's of a mocked up car, and he was sent a dummy engine. Max Welt from Porsche AG was going to the US, so Dowe rushed around, made it look like a real car and painted it in grey primer.\n\n\"Welti went back to Germany and, within weeks, XJR-14 chassis number 691, was on the way to becoming WSC95-001 In the autumn came the announcement of a two-car assault on not only on the following year's Le Mans 24 Hours but the US enduros at Daytona and Sebring......... Two chassis - one converted Jaguar, one brand new - ended up fifth and sixth at Daytona's pre-race tests amid allegations of sandbagging........\"\n\nAfter performance penalties were given by IMSA, Porsche withdrew. Joest asked Porsche if he could rent the cars, and it was agreed. It was entered into the Le Mans 24 Hrs, and won two years running.\n\nForgive me if this is slightly off topic, but is it true that the Joest team won the Le Mans in 1996 and 1997 with 'Porsche' chassis that were actually modified (open top) Jaguar tubs from Jag's last season in Sports Cars in 1992? Fitted with the Porsche engine?\n\nIf true, it seems as if this were a bit of a hallow victory for Porsche considering their works cars were beaten by Joest, and the cars were even true Porsches. Maybe just a victory for the engines?\n\nI spoke with Tony and heres his definitive answer:\n\nthe Porsche we built for the 1995 season was indeed an ex IMSA/Group C car. Stated out life as chassis 791.\n\nThe car raced a number of times. 1995 and 1996 at Le Mans. It also did a Donnington Park race, which it won with Stefan Johannson driving and a Petit Le Mans where I think is was second. I think it was also rolled out at Le Mans one more time and was crashed by David Murrey.\n\nWe only made two WSC 95's, one built on the 791 chassis and the other built on a brand new chassis with no previous history."
