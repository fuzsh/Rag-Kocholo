Porsche developed this car specfically for the 1996 LeMans season, using a monocoque that had already passed the crash test. It had a midbody engine, and the exterior was designed to meet the specifications of the Sartre Circuit while leaving the 911 look intact. The specifications also required that more than 25 public road-worthy copies of the car be produced, so Porsche manufactured this street version with a silencer on the exhaust. This model was produced using photos taken of the real thing at the Porsche Museum! An acrylic base and clear cover are included.
