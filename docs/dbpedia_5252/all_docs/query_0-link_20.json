        "text": "Description[]\n\nThe Porsche 911 GT1 was a sports prototype race car designed and manufactured by Porsche AG for use in sports car racing. Designed by Norbert Singer and Tony Hatter, the 911 GT1, despite sharing a name with the 911 road car, featured little in common with the road going car, with only the headlights and taillights shared. The car was powered by a 3.2L M96/80 twin-turbocharged flat-6; its frontal chassis was based on the 993 while its rear subframes and engine were derived from what was used in the 962C. Twenty-five road-going versions of the 911 GT1, named the 911 GT1 Stra√üenversion (lit. \"street version\"), were produced to homologate the car. The car made its debut in the 1996 BPR Global GT Series at Brands Hatch.\n\nThe Porsche 911 GT1-98 was a further refinement of the 911 GT1 and the car's final variant overall, competing in the LMGT1 category. Despite sharing a similar name with the previous 911 GT1s, the 911 GT1-98 bore little resemblance to the previous two models, instead featuring new bodywork and paneling that were more similar to that of a sports prototype than that of a grand touring race car. The car competed in the FIA International GT Series; it was the closest competition to Mercedes-Benz's CLK LM, but was not usually able to match it on most occasions due to engine regulations regarding air restrictors being unfavorable to turbocharged engines. Despite this, a 911 GT1-98 managed to win the 1998 24 Hours of Le Mans due to its competitors having reliability problems. The cars were withdrawn from competition after the 1998 season. Five chassis were built, as well as one street-legal version used to homologate the car.\n\nVersions[]\n\nThe Porsche 911 GT1-98 has come out in the following versions:\n\nCol # Year Series Color Tampo Base Color Window Color Interior Color Wheel Type Toy # Country Notes Photo 676 1999 1999 First Editions\n\n25/26 White Magenta, Orange, Black, & Gray tampos w/ '2' & racing deco on sides, '2' on hood Black / Plastic Clear Black LW 18852 Malaysia 172 2000 Mainline Metalflake Purple White, Red, Black \"27\", \"24 HEURES DU MANS\", various sponsors with hotwheels logo Black Plastic Clear Black LW 27138 Malaysia Black spoiler 172 2000 Mainline Metalflake Purple White, Red, Black \"27\", \"24 HEURES DU MANS\", various sponsors with hotwheels logo Black Plastic Clear Black SB 27138 Malaysia Black spoiler 172 2000 Mainline Metalflake Purple White, Red, Black \"27\", \"24 HEURES DU MANS\", various sponsors with hotwheels logo Black Plastic Clear Black PR5 27138 Malaysia Black spoiler 2000 World Racers 2 5-Pack Metallic Blue White, Red, Black \"27\" Black Plastic Yellow Tint White Gold LW 18852 not on base Black spoiler 250 2000 Mainline White enamel Multi-colored tampos (see note) Black Plastic Clear Grey LW 29297 China Teal Tampo 250 2000 Mainline White enamel Multi-colored tampos (see note) Black Plastic Clear Grey LW 29297 China Green Tampo 135 2002 Mainline Orange Metalflake orange, yellow (5) Black Plastic Clear Grey LW 55020 Malaysia Grey spoiler 2010 Speed Machines White detail. tampos, White \"Porsche\" on rear spoiler Black Plastic Dark tint unseen Chrome rim, Gold CM6 R8491 Malaysia Base code(s): B46"
