It seems strange that they need it to be so specific.\n\nGwsinc\n\nMontreal\n\nJoined\n\n4 Sep 2019\n\nMessages\n\n541\n\n2 May 2020\n\n#3\n\nDate of first registration should be on any receipt for work form an OPC. It should also be in your log book if it's original.\n\nAlternatively take your car to bits and go off the latest date code from an original part...\n\nberni29\n\nPaul Ricard\n\nJoined\n\n24 Oct 2009\n\nMessages\n\n3,048\n\n2 May 2020\n\n#4\n\nHi\n\nI have had most of my 993 apart and have never seen a sticker or such stating manufacture date. I mention a sticker because my 2003 Boxster has a big one stuck on the back under the PU.\n\nBerni\n\nstichill99\n\nSuzuka\n\nJoined\n\n3 Nov 2013\n\nMessages\n\n1,012\n\n2 May 2020\n\n#5\n\nbuild date\n\nYes I think it is bonkers asking for the actual build date. You have already told them the vin number which has the code S as the 10th digit which specifies 1995 build. I can't see it makes a blind bit of difference what day it was built on but the form will not be accepted for valuation without it.\n\nThis is the form on Porsche Club website. Just trying to save Â£25 which classicline charge for valuation! :dont know:"
