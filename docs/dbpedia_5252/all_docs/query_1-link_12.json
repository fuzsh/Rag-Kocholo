        "text": "By Manish Kharinta -\n\nThis 1998 Porsche 911 GT1 Strassenversion is a gorgeous sight in white and is up for sale for the price of $12.3 million with only 489 miles.\n\nWith new hypercars launching every few days, enthusiasts might be hard-pressed to track down coveted automotive classics. Sure enough, the newer cars sport futuristic designs, state-of-the-art tech, and maybe even better specs, but they easily get lost in the sea of mundane. If that’s your problem, then you can now get your hands on an almost new Porsche 911 GT1 Strassenversion as long as you have the cash to spare.\n\nThis 911 GT1 Strassenversion is a fine example of the breed, which makes it worth every cent of its $12,261,624.7 price tag. This particular car is currently located in Tokyo, Japan, and is available for purchase through James Edition. With only 489 miles on the odometer, this Strassenversion’s mileage translates to only 21 miles per year.\n\nThe exterior and the interior of this glorious sports car are in pristine condition, which only further enhances the value of this modern classic. This Porsche 911 GT1 Strassenversion was manufactured between 1996 and 1998 to meet homologation requirements. As a result of this, only a limited number of the lauded sports car made it to production.\n\nBack in December, we discussed a video where renowned British racecar driver- Tiff Needell – offered his insights about the Porsche 911 GT1 Strassenversion. For the uninitiated, the 911 GT1 Strassenversion is an ultra-wide body, downforce-generating performance machine. The car gets a plethora of racing-inspired features and advanced aerodynamics technology. This includes the roof-mounted air intake and the giant rear wing. Porsche 911 GT1 Strassenversion is powered by a 3.2-liter twin-turbocharged flat-six engine.\n\nThe water-cooled powerplant is mated to a manual transmission. According to the seller, this sports car’s motor has been re-tuned to churn out 700 HP of maximum power. Therefore, accelerating from 0 to 62 MPH takes less than four seconds. The power is sent to the rear wheels, and this automotive masterpiece can achieve a top speed of 192 MPH. James Edition is a global network, which means you can buy this car regardless of your location. It is also worth noting that the seller accepts Bitcoins as payments.\n\nPhotos: James Edition\n\nJoin the Electric Vehicle forums now!"
