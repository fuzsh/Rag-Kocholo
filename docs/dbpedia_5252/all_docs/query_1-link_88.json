So for example in Aug/Sept 1997, Porsche would have released the specs for the 1998 model year. This is often reflected in a different chassis number code which will signify the model year the car belongs to.\n\nNo idea if the specs of a 1998 993 differs from a 1997. Given it was the last year of the 993, 1998 cars may have more equipment fitted for example.\n\nAnother example, I ordered my Audi in Sept 2007, on release of the 2008 model year spec (which differed from the 2007 spec).
