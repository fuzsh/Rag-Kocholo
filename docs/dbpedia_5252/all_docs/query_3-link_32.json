        "text": "Porsche has made some wild road cars over the years. Cars like the V-10-powered Carrera GT, the hard-t0-handle GT2 RS, and the futuristic 918 Spyder are great examples of just how hardcore the company has gone while making cars for the street. But no Porsche road car is more extreme than the 911 GT1.\n\nBuilt to homologate Porsche's GT1 race car for the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the GT1 wasn't just a road car with a bunch of racing parts bolted on—it was a race car, made street legal. The front portion was standard 911, but the rear half was essentially lifted from the company's 962 prototype—3.2-liter twin-turbo flat-six and all. The result is an extremely visceral experience, complete with a loud, noisy cabin, a stiff suspension, and not much ground clearance.\n\nAll those trade-offs aren't for naught. According to Needell, the 911 GT1 is what driver involvement is all about. The seats hug you perfectly, and the steering is expertly tuned to provide the most feedback. That engine, while not as elegant as something like the McLaren F1's V-12, is full of life. It's an enthusiast's dream.\n\nThe 911 GT1 won its class at Le Mans during its debut in 1996, solidifying the 20 road-going versions built as collector's items for years to come. The one in this video is worth around $13 million, according to Needell."
