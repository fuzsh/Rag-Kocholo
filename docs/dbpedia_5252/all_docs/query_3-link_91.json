I purchased the 1/43 decals about 10 years ago from Grand Prix Models hopping one day to build this car. I have no idea who made the decals, there was no information in the package.\n\nI finally found a donor kit on EBay this past winter with no decals. Apon receiving the Provance Moulage kit, I found some other problems as well. Very thankful for that good ol' parts bin coming to the rescue again.\n\nI made the front winglets from aluminum flashing & added a set of Etched brakes from Renaissance. The lug nuts were from Scale Hardware withe the centers filled & painted.\n\nThe paint was mixed from Tamiya acrilics & cleared with Dupont Chroma Clear. Detail paint was done with Vallejo acrylics.\n\nI am very happy to finally have this car in my collection & the wait was worth it. I hope you all enjoy this car as well & thank you for looking."
