        "text": "When the McLaren F1 was born, the marque was on top...in Formula 1, with eight consecutive titles between 1988 and 1991. Then a new ambition emerged, give Ferrari a run for its money with a high-performance road model designed by Gordon Murray, one of the most imaginative engineers of the time.\n\n1992 - Presentation of the McLaren F1: powered by a 6-liter, V12 engine specially designed by BMW, it had the unique feature of three front seats, with the driving position front and center. In all 106 units, including 28 destined for competition, were manufactured between 1993 and 1998.\n\n1995 - After having drawn the interest of several teams and drivers, the McLaren F1 was modified to its racing version under the name F1 GTR. On June 17th, seven cars were at the start of the 63rd edition of the 24 Hours. Remarkably agile in the rain, it won the race to most everyone's surprise thanks to Yannick Dalmas, J.J. Lehto and Masanori Sekiya. Joining the winning car, four other F1 GTRs crossed the finish line, with three in the top 5 (third, fourth and fifth). At the end of 1995, McLaren celebrated its success with the production of a five-unit limited series (a nod to the five ranked F1 GTRs) called the F1 LM.\n\n1996 - In addition to the Joest-Porsche TWR prototype's win and the double podium for the Porsche 911 GT1, the F1 GTR confirmed it was a major player with five cars in the top 10, led by Peter Kox, John Nielsen and Thomas Bscher, fourth. The two F1 GTRs were entered by the Bigazzi team, a long-time BMW partner. They finished eighth and 11th. Among the drivers figured three-time Formula 1 World Champion, Nelson Piquet, who had won his second title in 1983 at the wheel of a Brabham powered by BMW.\n\n1997 - For the first of his nine victories at the 24 Hours, Tom Kristensen (driving the Joest-Porsche TWR along with Michele Alboreto and Stefan Johansson) was joined on the podium by two McLarens. BMW increased its involvement with two F1 GTRs entered directly by BMW Motorsport. The one driven by Peter Kox, Roberto Ravaglia and Eric Helary finished third. The four others at the start were forced to retire. The most notable change to the 1997 version of the F1 GTR was its longtail, like the Porsche 917s and 956s of the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n1998 - As the 911 GT1 was giving Porsche its 16th win at Le Mans, the McLaren F1 GTR was earning its final top 5 in its last appearance at the 24 Hours, with fourth place for Steve O'Rourke, Bill Auberlen and Tim Sugden. The other car was forced to retire after an incident. At the wheel were two future major players of Audi's saga at the 24 Hours of Le Mans: Italian driver Emanuele Pirro and Dindo Capello.\n\nThe F1 GTR has known its fair share of glory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans...to be continued in the next installment of this series."
