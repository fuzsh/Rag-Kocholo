        "text": "These are super rare. I'd be surprised if you can find anything for under $1M. The street version goes from $1.5-2M, for example Rare Porsche 911 GT1 For Sale In Japan | AutoGuide.com News and Only Legally Registered Porsche GT1 Straßenversion In US Goes Up for Sale | 9magazine.\n\nI would think that any race cars go for above that since they were very successful. Crashed version? Minimum $1M I would say...\n\nWhat I'd do is get an SLC without a body and then have someone recreate the GT1 body on it. Drivetrain is already solved, because I put a GT3 motor in an SLC (same block as GT1 engine, except no turbos). :thumbsup:\n\nTim\n\nTim,\n\nGood idea. Right now I am using the same strategy having Fran build a 962C off of a SLC chassis. I'm putting a 996GT2 motor with transaxle in the back. Not the same exact motor, as the orig car had a 2.7-3.0 single turbo'd 930 based engine with one head per cylinder. But with quality internals you can run a 996TT motor up to 1000hp all day long, with little to no lag. Just to confirm the orig 962 had titanium vlaves and con-rods?\n\nFor a 911GT1 I might do the same with the SLC chassis (I've seen GT1 body ktis for 993 cars) so the molds technically exist. Fran could fab a cage in similar dimensions as a 993 with extended rear clip.\n\nI'm sure he's grinning ear-to-ear reading this\n\nDusty - nice! Who is making the body for you? Fran?\n\nAlso, did you buy the drivetrain at LAPD? I've seen quite a few 996 GT2 motors becoming available. Which G96 are you using?\n\nI'm going to stay NA I think and maybe at some point do the 3.9/4.0L conversion. Turbo is certainly an option though.\n\nWhat's up with you porsche guys and porsche engines? Big block or bust!\n\nAs a good German, it's gotta be a German drivetrain...\n\nThere is no reason with an SLC chassis, 996tt motor breathed on and a spartan interior why this cannot be built for less than $85k, very basic of course.\n\nI for one would love to see Fran put this one on the books. Might even take the place of a 917 in the stable.\n\nAnd the spankings it would deliver to the porchego would be....pri¢ele$$!"
