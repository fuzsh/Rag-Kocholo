        "text": "Porsche has unveiled the 911 Carrera GTS Le Mans Centenaire Edition, celebrating 100 years since the first running of the 24 Hours of Le Mans.\n\nThe silver paint and number 46 racing number reference the 1951 356 SL, while the gold wheels and red seatbelts are callbacks to the 1998 911 GT1.\n\nThe Centenaire Edition is only being offered in France, and Porsche didn't specify how many copies of the special 911 will be built.\n\nThis year, 2023, marked 100 years since the first running of the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The centenary edition of the iconic race drew a record-setting crowd and displayed dramatic racing among the new Hypercar class and the GTE cars. To celebrate the anniversary, Porsche has revealed the 911 Carrera GTS Le Mans Centenaire Edition, a limited production model that takes cues from two Le Mansâ€“winning race cars, the 356 SL and the 911 GT1. Unfortunately, this slick-looking special edition is destined only for the French market.\n\nThe Centenaire Edition starts off with a GTS-spec 911, packing a rear-mounted twin-turbo 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine that produces a healthy 473 horsepower. Both a seven-speed manual and the eight-speed PDK automatic transmission are offered. Based on the lack of a \"4\" in the name, we presume the special edition will not be available with all-wheel drive, so all 420 pound-feet of torque are sent to the rear wheels.\n\nThe color scheme draws heavily on the 1951 class-winning 356 SL, painted Le Mans Silver Metallic and featuring a roundel on the door with the number 46. Inside, the bucket seats are upholstered in Graphite Blue leather and corduroy, emulating the 356 SL's cabin. The same blue leather adorns the steering wheel, with a 12-o'clock marker in Cayon matching the accents on the dials, SportChrono clock, and stitching.\n\nThe cabin also features an outline of the Circuit de la Sarthe on the center armrest and \"24h\" embossed into the headrest, while the red seatbelts are a stylistic reference to the 911 GT1 that took the overall victory in 1998. The GT1's influence can also been seen in the wheels, painted in a gold color called Aurum with the outer ring finished in Le Mans Silver Metallic. The Centenaire Edition also features a decorative decal on the small rear side windows that imitates the louvers worn by the '98 GT1.\n\nThe special 911 is further distinguished by unique badges, including one with the \"24h Le Mans\" logo enclosed in a laurel wreath with the Porsche script on the rear grille. The grille also includes a decal reading \"Born in Le Mans, Manufactured in Zuffenhausen,\" while the B-pillar sports an emblem with a track outline in the French tricolor. The doorsill trims mark this 911 as a special edition.\n\nPorsche gifts every buyer a key pouch and car cover in Graphite Blue. There's no word on price or how many will be built, but the Le Mans Centenaire Edition is likely a fair chunk more expensive than a normal GTS, which starts at $144,050 in the U.S."
