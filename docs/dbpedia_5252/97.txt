Description[]

The Porsche 911 GT1 was a sports prototype race car designed and manufactured by Porsche AG for use in sports car racing. Designed by Norbert Singer and Tony Hatter, the 911 GT1, despite sharing a name with the 911 road car, featured little in common with the road going car, with only the headlights and taillights shared. The car was powered by a 3.2L M96/80 twin-turbocharged flat-6; its frontal chassis was based on the 993 while its rear subframes and engine were derived from what was used in the 962C. Twenty-five road-going versions of the 911 GT1, named the 911 GT1 Stra√üenversion (lit. "street version"), were produced to homologate the car. The car made its debut in the 1996 BPR Global GT Series at Brands Hatch.

The Porsche 911 GT1-98 was a further refinement of the 911 GT1 and the car's final variant overall, competing in the LMGT1 category. Despite sharing a similar name with the previous 911 GT1s, the 911 GT1-98 bore little resemblance to the previous two models, instead featuring new bodywork and paneling that were more similar to that of a sports prototype than that of a grand touring race car. The car competed in the FIA International GT Series; it was the closest competition to Mercedes-Benz's CLK LM, but was not usually able to match it on most occasions due to engine regulations regarding air restrictors being unfavorable to turbocharged engines. Despite this, a 911 GT1-98 managed to win the 1998 24 Hours of Le Mans due to its competitors having reliability problems. The cars were withdrawn from competition after the 1998 season. Five chassis were built, as well as one street-legal version used to homologate the car.
