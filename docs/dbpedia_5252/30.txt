Chassis: 993-GT1-117

Through Porsche Motorsports North America, this chassis was sold in February of 1997 as a spare monocoque to Canadian Klaus Bytzek, who already owned two earlier customer 911 GT1 cars. It was eventually built up using the running gear and suspension from one of the existing cars that had been crashed at Mosport. Porsche supplied a full 1997 specification aerodynamics package, effectively making this the only 911 GT1 Evolution sold new to a customer. In the subsequent years, it was raced extensively in the Canadian Championship and select rounds of the newly established ALMS. It was instrumental in Bytzek's team winning the 1999, 2000 and 2001 championships, scoring 13 wins from 31 starts. Among its final contemporary outings was at the 2001 Daytona 24 Hours, where Bytzek had no fewer than three 911 GT1s ready to race. This chassis started 12th but due to gearbox issues was eventually classified 41st at the finish.

In the early 2010s, the car was acquired by a British collector, who had it completely restored by specialists Lanzante Motorsport. At this time, it was also made fully road legal; a first for a 911 GT1 with competition history. Following a post-restoration appearance at the 2015 Goodwood Festival of Speed, it was consigned to the 2016 RM Sotheby's Monaco sale. It was subsequently acquired by a German enthusiast. He entrusted the car to specialists Motohistorics for another restoration with an eye on going racing again. With all the road legal equipment removed and the original paint-scheme re-applied, it was first seen in action at the 80th Goodwood Members’ Meeting in 2023.
