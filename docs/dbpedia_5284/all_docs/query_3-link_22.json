        "text": "The Original CARE Package is Born\n\nAt the end of World War II, with much of the world in ruins, Arthur Ringland and Dr. Lincoln Clark approach 22 American charities to propose a non-profit corporation to funnel food packages from Americans to loved ones in Europe. The charities agree and on November 27, they incorporate the Cooperative for American Remittances to Europe (CARE). After negotiation with multiple government agencies, CARE takes possession of 2.8 million “10-in-1” military food rations. These rations become the world’s first CARE Packages® and an American symbol is born.\n\n“The name was created one evening in the fall of 1945 in the family room of Lincoln Clark’s home in College Park, MD. Alice Clark looked up from her ironing to ask why her husband was pacing the floor. Because, he replied, he was trying to think of an organizational name whose initials would make up a word expressing the idea of food relief. ‘… your three key words are Cooperative, American, and Europe,’ Alice told him. ‘But the letters C-A-E don’t spell anything. How about distribution? How are you going to get the packages to the people who need them?’ she asked. Lincoln explained the plan we had developed … ‘Now we’re talking,’ Alice said. ‘You could use the word remittances and name the organization the “Cooperative for American Remittances to Europe.” The initials would give you a word that has a meaning by itself – CARE.’ That is how CARE was named. As far as we know, the only reward Alice Clark ever received was a sincere kiss from Linc.”\n\n– Wallace Campbell, The History of CARE\n\nNew Frontiers\n\nThe next ten years are witness to the ebb and flow of CARE’s presence around the world, responding to shifting political forces and sudden onset emergencies. CARE mounts a two-year effort to support Hungarian refugees after the 1956 Uprising, begins a massive school feeding program in the Philippines and supports victims of wars and persecution in Gaza, Tibet, and Cuba.\n\nThe organization is an active responder to natural disasters in Colombia, Peru, Sri Lanka, Chile, Iran, Vietnam, Algeria, and the Dominican Republic. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy creates the Peace Corps and asks CARE to train its volunteers. In the same year, CARE provides resettlement kits after the construction of the Berlin Wall.\n\nIn this decade, CARE also opens its first non-Arab African missions in Liberia and Sierra Leone. In 1963, the 50 millionth CARE Package is delivered in Colombia. By the end of 1965, Poland, Yugoslavia and Greece are the only remaining European missions.\n\nResponding in a Changing World\n\nFamine relief in Africa continues throughout 1986-7, but “donor fatigue” sets in and cash donations drop. Despite this, CARE continues its work with drought victims, helping them to plant trees and conserve soil. CARE’s management structure takes shape with regional management units and formal sector work. In 1987, Fortune Magazine names CARE “Best Managed Charity.”\n\nIn 1988, CARE becomes the first western aid agency to work in China, helping farmers with poultry and livestock management. That same year, CARE airlifts 50,000 CARE Packages in its first operation in the Soviet Union. The organization also launches its first AIDS education program in Rwanda and Kenya and marks its return to Afghanistan after a decade of guerrilla war.\n\nCARE’s environmental and food distribution work continue, and immunizations reach half a million people as CARE contributes to a decade of unprecedented success in immunization and reducing infant mortality. CARE’s Population Unit is formed (family planning) and small business development programs grow worldwide.\n\nIn 1991, major relief operations continue in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War. CARE temporarily revives the CARE Package, distributing 600,000 of them to help stave off hunger during the winter food shortage in the crumbling Soviet Union. CARE’s environmental and health programming units receive multiple grants from USAID and significantly expand.\n\nAlso in 1991, CARE launches a micro-savings project in rural Niger that would become known as Village Savings & Loan Associations. Today the model has been adopted by several other development organizations and there are more than 15 million VSLA members across sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nFunded largely by CARE International members, in 1992 CARE sees its largest year of expansion after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The following year, CARE USA moves its headquarters from New York to Atlanta, and changes its name again to the “Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere.”\n\nAlso in 1992, CARE helps start the Dadaab Refugee Camp in Kenya, near the Somalia border. CARE has been key partner in the camp, which remains one of the world’s largest, providing education, food and other critical services. In 1993, CARE continues its responses in Somalia and Afghanistan, and forms its Emergency Assistance Unit to respond to increasing disasters and conflicts and Public Policy and advocacy programs increase.\n\nIn 1993, CARE commits to focus on women and girls as key agents of change in fighting poverty, and begins its journey of transforming the forces that hold women and girls back.\n\nEmpowerment, Equity, Sustainability, Advocacy\n\nComplex humanitarian emergencies continue to mark the post-Cold War Era. Economic collapse and civil conflict pave the way for famine, violence, the spread of infectious diseases and refugee movements.\n\nCARE takes up the challenge of tackling poverty at the root through a platform of empowerment, equity, sustainability and strengthening civil society. In 1999, CARE pioneers its accelerated education program for girls in India who are taken out of school for financial or other family-related reasons.\n\n“The organization seeks a world of hope, tolerance and social justice, where poverty has been overcome and people live in dignity and security. We will be known everywhere for CARE’s unshakable commitment to the dignity of people.”\n\n– CARE’s current vision focusing on human rights and causes of poverty, adopted in 2000\n\nIn 2001, the organization changes its logo from the variation on its original CARE “stamp” to the “circle of hands” still in use today.\n\nWith more than 90 percent of CARE staff working in the countries they are from, CARE fosters diversity and local innovations. In 2000, CARE develops an approach to education programming in Cambodia that focuses on adolescent girls and pilots working with local and national governments to change policies that lead to poverty and exclusion. This eventually drives CARE’s global education portfolio that reaches millions of underserved girls worldwide.\n\nIn 2003, CARE Thailand became the Raks Thai Foundation, the first CARE member governed from a developing country to prioritize local voices in development.\n\nIn 2004, USAID funds CARE’s SHOUHARDO program in Bangladesh. The success of the initiative to prevent childhood stunting from malnutrition would go on to stun the agency, proving twice as effective as a typical intervention, with much of the gains attributed to the program’s efforts to empower women.\n\nAt the end of 2004, thirty countries are in conflict, and the threats of terrorism, the human toll of war and the HIV/AIDS pandemic continue to challenge CARE staff worldwide, but the organization continues its pursuit of a world free from poverty and social injustice through community development, emergency response and rehabilitation programs.\n\nCARE begins 2005 with a strategic focus on its core programming: basic and girls’ education, emergency response, HIV/AIDS, and water and sanitation. The organization collaborates to create the ONE Campaign, develops the CARE Action Network of advocates nationwide, plays an important role in pressing the U.S. government to fulfill its commitment to the Millennium Development Goals, and appears before Congress to support post-Tsunami aid and the global water crisis.\n\nAlso in 2005, after the kidnapping and tragic murder of CARE’s country director in Iraq, we halted operations in that country – which did not resume until 2014 with our response to the displaced persons crisis in the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq.\n\nWomen and Girls at the Center\n\nIn 2006, CARE responds to the Boxing Day tsunami that struck 14 countries across the Indian Ocean. CARE was among the leading humanitarian agencies that responded and worked with affected communities across five countries to reconstruct homes and livelihoods and promote economic and social development, reaching more than 1.3 million people.\n\nIn 2006, CARE USA welcomes President and CEO Dr. Helene Gayle, who joins the organization after Peter Bell steps down after ten years. That same year, the organization fully adopts a focus on women and girls through Pathways to Empowerment and signature programs in maternal health, education and leadership, and economic opportunity.\n\nIn 2007, CARE USA decides to end the practice of food monetization – selling U.S. government food on the open market to fund anti-poverty programs – seeking alternatives to monetization that would make U.S. food assistance far more effective. In 2009, CARE develops its Learning Tours program. Funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, CARE takes policymakers, government leaders and change-makers on short, intensive trips where they meet the people whose lives are being transformed through U.S. investments.\n\nCARE’s advocacy – especially from teams in Asia and Latin America – contributes to the adoption in Geneva at the International Labour Conference (ILC) of a new ILO Convention on ending violence and harassment in the world of work, an important milestone on the journey to advance women’s economic empowerment and to realize lives lived free from violence.\n\nIn 2019, CARE marks 20 years of Udaan (now SOAR) schools with goals for educating 3 million additional girls in Asia and Africa.\n\nIn 2020, CARE’s COVID-19 response has targeted more than 60 countries worldwide, including the United States. Priority actions we are taking now include providing health and hygiene kits, installing handwashing stations in public places, and providing clean water where it is scarce. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, CARE revived the CARE Package in the form of donations sent to a global community and gift cards sent to workers on the frontlines."
