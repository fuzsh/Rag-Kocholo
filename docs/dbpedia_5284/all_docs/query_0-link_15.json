        "text": "ABOUT US\n\nThe Wilbur & Hilda Glenn Family Foundation is a private family foundation established in 1996. It is a descendant of the former Wilbur Fisk Glenn Memorial Foundation, founded in 1937 by Thomas K. Glenn, primarily as a means of introducing his two sons to philanthropy. Its mission is to enhance the quality of human life by making grants that reflect the keen interests and passions of the Foundation’s trustees and which are structured to achieve significant impact. [More about our history.]\n\nGlenn Family Breast Center, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University\n\nWith a $10 million-dollar investment in 2010, the Breast Center was created to expand research, develop new care delivery models and support innovative clinical trials. The Center played a significant role in the 2017 National Cancer Institute (NCI) designation of Winship Cancer Institute as a comprehensive cancer center, one of only 48 such centers in the country and the only one in Georgia.\n\nLou Glenn Children’s Garden, Atlanta Botanical Garden\n\nCreated in 2015 as part of a major expansion, the Children’s Garden serves a quarter-of-a-million children and families annually, showcasing the health, educational and social-emotional benefits of regular connection to nature to the Garden’s visitors.\n\nTom Glenn Community Impact Fund, Island Institute of Maine\n\nThe Glenn Impact Fund is a community development catalyst fund that seeks to build a more diverse coastal economy through the investment of capital with grants, loans, and equity support for small businesses and community infrastructure projects.\n\nIvan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage, Georgia Institute of Technology\n\nAn international award created in 2009, the Prize honors the courage Mayor Allen displayed nearly half a century ago and recognizes individuals who, by standing up for a clear moral principle, have positively affected public discourse at the risk of their own careers, their livelihoods, and even their lives. Past recipients include President Jimmy and First Lady Roslyn Carter, Dr. William Foege, Congressman John Lewis, human rights lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa, Senator Sam Nunn, and Ambassador Andrew Young.\n\nThe Wilbur and Hilda Glenn Institute for Philanthropy and Service Learning, The Westminster Schools\n\nCreated in 2002, the Glenn Institute’s work engages the entire Westminster family – students, parents, faculty, staff and alumni – in greater opportunities for philanthropy, volunteering and giving for the public good. The Institute created and helps lead the national Philanthropy Education and Service-Learning Consortium, facilitating learning among peer schools to enrich their public purpose work and to encourage the adoption of philanthropy education in schools around the country."
