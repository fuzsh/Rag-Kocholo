        "text": "EVOLUTION OF THE ROONEY RULE\n\nThe NFL adopted the Rooney Rule in 2003 based on recommendations made by the league’s Workplace Diversity Committee, now known as the Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Committee. It was named after then-chairman of the committee, Dan Rooney, the late owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nThe committee’s initial focus was on the historically low number of minorities in head coaching positions. The policy originally required every team with a head coaching vacancy to interview at least one or more diverse candidates before making a new hire.\n\nOver the years, the Rooney Rule has expanded to include a greater number of positions across NFL clubs.\n\nFollowing the 2022 Spring League Meeting, the Rooney Rule was expanded to include women as a part of the minority candidate definition and also include the QB coach position. NFL teams are now required to interview at least two minority candidates for vacant head coach, GM and coordinator positions. One minority candidate is required for the QB coach position. With many prospective head coaches beginning their careers in the QB room, the ruling is expected to help increase the hiring of diverse head coaches in the future.\n\nIn 2021, the NFL approved changes requiring every team to interview at least two external minority candidates in person for open head coach and GM positions and at least two external minority candidates — in person or virtual — for a coordinator job. Additionally, at least one minority and/or female candidate must be interviewed for senior level positions (e.g., club president and senior executives).\n\nIn November 2020, team owners approved a proposal rewarding teams who developed minority talent that went on to become GMs or head coaches across the league. If a team lost a minority executive or coach to another team, that team would receive a third-round compensatory pick for two years. If a team lost both a coach and personnel member, it would receive a third-round compensatory pick for three years.\n\nIn 2009, the policy was amended to include general manager and primary football executive jobs, requiring each team to interview a minimum of two external minority candidates."
