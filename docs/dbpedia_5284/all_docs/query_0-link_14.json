        "text": "What drew you to the law?\n\nThe study of tax and financial law, then acquiring my bar license, opened up international travel and employment opportunities. I pursued tax law because it is the common field that touches all people, all business and all finance, on an annual and transactional basis.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about teaching?\n\nOver the past 21 years, I have enjoyed pushing students beyond their self-imposed boxes, and helping them develop new perspectives and knowledge-acquisition skills so that they may creatively approach challenges. Also, I have successfully assisted students in becoming great communicators, with published outcomes in journals, magazines and books. I greatly enjoy hearing from alumni who are pursuing a career that brings them personal satisfaction.\n\nWhat do you hope students gain from your courses?\n\nI hope students develop their thinking and learn knowledge-acquisition skills so they can self-generate multiple perspectives to creatively approach client issues. I also aspire to help students who choose a publication track to become excellent professional communicators of complex regulations and solutions.\n\nWhat did you do prior to entering academia?\n\nI built a substantial retainer book — based on value creation — of global financial service firms, multinational technology companies and ultra-high net worth investors. I then joined a Big Six accounting firm (Coopers & Lybrand) and developed staff who would operate as the outsourced international tax department for our clients. Because my specialization was transfer pricing, I brought a robust understanding of operations, financing and supply chain to the table.\n\nWhat are you passionate about outside of the law?\n\nI design suits including sourcing fabric, design, and tailoring. I travel extensively, experiencing local culture, especially music, culinary, and the arts. My musical tastes include primarily funk, EDM, blues and jam bands (Phish, Dead & Co, Govt. Mule) and jazz, and going to festivals.\n\nWhat are your research interests?\n\nMy primary research interests focus on global taxation issues (e.g., tax treaties, transfer pricing), international capital movement, wealth management and financial planning, and anti-money laundering. I also research the history of charity and of company laws."
