        "text": "Often considered hip-hop's first lady, the woman behind the moniker Queen Latifah was born Dana Elaine Owens on March 18, 1970, in East Orange, New Jersey. She is the daughter of Rita (Bray), a teacher, and Lancelot Owens Sr. She came from a police family-both her father and her older brother were cops-which would later influence her rhyming style and life philosophy. Her brother died in a motorcycle accident in 1992. Owens witnessed both sides of black urban life in the USA while growing up. After a brief stint as a Burger King employee, she soon found herself making waves in the hip-hop music scene.\n\nAfter working as the human beatbox alongside Ladies Fresh, she was just 18 years old when she broke through in the late 1980s with a style that picked selectively from jazz, reggae, and soul traditions, from beats produced by D.J. Mark the 45 King. Her debut single, \"Wrath of My Madness,\" was released in 1988. A year later, her debut long-player, \"All Hail the Queen,\" enjoyed favored reviews: an old, wise head was evident on the top of her young shoulders. The former Burger King employee maintained her early commitment to answering the misogynist armory of some of her male counterparts and, at the same time, imparted musical good times to all genders. Her name means \"delicate and sensitive\" in Arabic, but she has often been anything but in her rhymes and the messages she sends out through them. One of the most prominent female hip-hop artists on the scene for over a decade, Queen Latifah has also made tremendous inroads in movies, television, and artist management, with her management company, Flavor Unit, alongside her business partner Shakim Compere. A role model who takes the responsibility to heart, Latifah has carefully constructed a fine career for herself-one that is constantly moving upward.\n\nWesley Trent Snipes was born in Orlando, Florida, to Marian (Long), a teacher's assistant, and SMSGT Wesley Rudolph Snipes, an aircraft engineer. He grew up on the streets of the South Bronx in New York City, where he very early decided that dance and the theatre were to be his career. He attended the High School for the Performing Arts (popularized in Fame - Der Weg zum Ruhm (1980)). But dreams of the musical theater (and maybe a few commercials) faded when his mother moved to Orlando, Florida before he could graduate. Fortune would have it that he along with two friends and his \"Drama class\" teachers Mr. S Porro and K. Rugerio, would start a bus-n-truck theatre company (Struttin Street Stuff) be instrumental in his high schools (Jones High) induction into the International Thespian Society, Orlando Chapter and help lay the foundation for what would become Dr. Phillips High Schools theatre arts program. Musical theatre rooted Snipes performed song-n-dance, puppetry, and acrobatics in city parks, dinner clubs, and performing arts centers around central Florida. As a recipient of a Victor Borge Scholarship, Snipes left Orlando and entered the world-renowned professional theatre arts program at SUNY Purchase in New York, now Purchase College, where he honed his theatrical performance and martial arts skills. Graduating with a BFA, he went on to co-star in a few soap operas and nighttime dramas, peppered in between critical acclaim performances Broadway. It was there in a Broadway theater An agent saw him on stage and invited him to audition for his first feature film role.\n\nGoldie Hawn American Wildcats (1986). Athletic roles such as that gave way to dramatic roles such as that gave way to tough guy roles as in New Jack City (1991), and to the action hero in Passagier 57 (1992). Wesley feels that at least with the Hollywood heavyweights he must be doing something right - Sylvester Stallone, Robert De Niro, Dennis Hopper and Sean Connery all had veto power over casting and all approved his role. Wesley also founded Amen Ra Films Production Company, and is a Multi System Combat Arts Black Belt Holder IT Technologist & VC.\n\nMario Van Peebles is a highly regarded director, actor, producer and writer. His directorial skills can be seen in the retelling of the epic mini-series \"Roots\" starring Forest Whitaker and Matthew Goode. Van Peebles has directed award-winning shows such as the recent hit \"Empire\" and \"The Last Ship,\" as well as \"Sons of Anarchy,\" \"Lost,\" \"Damages,\" and \"Boss.\" As an actor Van Peebles has credits are as equally impressive.\n\nAn independent filmmaker to his core, Van Pebbles grew up watching Melvin Van Peebles, his maverick filmmaker father. A true master craftsman in his own right, Van Peebles is defined as a director, screenwriter, playwright, novelist and composer; known for funding his own work.\n\nHis many talents can be seen in films like his directorial breakout hit \"New Jack City,\" \"Posse\" and \"Panther;\" plus Michael Mann's Oscar® nominated \"Ali,\" in which he received critical acclaim for his role as real life minister and human rights activist Malcom X; the multi-award-winning \"Cotton Club\" written and directed by Francis Ford Coppola; Clint Eastwood's \"Heartbreak Ridge;\" and several projects with Ava DuVernay.\n\nThroughout his career, Van Peebles has brought challenging, compelling material to the screen, including his hip hop coming-of-age film \"We the Party,\" for which he wrote, directed and produced; his documentary short \"Bring You're a Game;\" and, of course, \"Baadasssss!\" This was Van Peebles' odyssey about the making of his father's groundbreaking film \"Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song\" and was one of Ebert and Roeper's ten best movies of the year for 2004.\n\nAs a director, Van Pebbles has affected unusually strong performances from his fellow actors. They often remark that he creates a collaborative climate where they feel free to do their best work. He believes his background as an actor helps him approach the actor's character development process internally. Conversely, he believes being a director has made him a more trusting, nuanced actor. Being able to do both is like creative crop rotation for Van Peebles. Not many directors get the privilege of being directed by other strong filmmakers. Acting for others is still \"super exciting\" to him.\n\nIn 1994, Hofstra University awarded Van Peebles an honorary doctorate of humane letters. After earning a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from Columbia University, Van Peebles spent two years working at New York's Department of Environmental Protection before moving to Hollywood to try his hand at acting writing and directing.\n\nIn addition to directing and acting in features, Van Peebles is passionate about supporting education and eco-consciousness through media. With his reality show, Mario's Green House, he teamed up with his five children and his father to chronicle the Van Peebles family's often-humorous attempts to raise their eco-consciousness as they try to go green in Hollywood. Green \"We never got to the full green, more like Olive green,\" jokes Van Peebles.\n\nEmmy-nominated actor and director Malcolm-Jamal Warner was born in Jersey City, New Jersey. He was named after Malcolm X and legendary jazz pianist Ahmad Jamal.\n\nWarner first rose to national prominence by starring on the celebrated and long-running classic television series \"The Cosby Show.\" His work on the show garnered him a Primetime Emmy Nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series.\n\nAs a seasoned director, Warner has worked on a host of television series, including being a regular director [and producer] on the comedy series \"Malcolm & Eddie,\" and also having directed several episodes of \"The Cosby Show,\" \"All That,\" \"Keenan & Kel,\" \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\" \"Sesame Street,\" and the AIDS awareness video \"Timeout: The Truth about HIV, AIDS, and You' [which starred Magic Johnson and Arsenio Hall, and earned Warner the NAACP Key of Life Image Award. His short film, \"This Old Man,\" received critical acclaim on the theater festival circuit.\n\nIn addition to his television credits, Warner made his feature film debut in Paramount Pictures' \"Drop Zone,\" and was also seen in Warner Bros' Pictures \"Fools Gold\" opposite Matthew McConaughey, Kate Hudson, and Donald Sutherland. He also co-starred in the independent films \"Restaurant\" with Adrien Brody, \"A Fare to Remember,\" and \"The List\" with Wayne Brady.\n\nOn stage, Warner has starred in the off-Broadway plays \"Three Ways Home,\" \"Cryin' Shame,\" for which he received the NAACP Theater Award for Best Supporting Actor, \"Freefall\" at the Victory Garden Theatre in Chicago, and in \"A Midsummer Nights' Dream,\" at the La Jolla Playhouse in California. Warner received critical acclaim for his West Coast debut of his one-man theatrical production of \"Love and Other Social Issues.\" He will return to the stage in September 2014, reprising Sidney Poitier's role as Dr. John Prentice in \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,\" opening in Boston at The Huntington Theatre. Warner has held this role before, previously performing in the play at Washington D.C.'s esteemed Arena Theater.\n\nIn 2014, Warner can be seen recurring on two hit series: TNT's \"Major Crimes,\" and FX's \"Sons of Anarchy.\" He was most recently seen on NBC's critically acclaimed series \"Community,\" and recently guest starred on \"The Michael J. Fox Show,\" TNT's \"Hawthorne\", AMC's \"The Cleaner,\" and Showtime's \"Dexter.\" In 2011, Warner produced, directed, and starred in the BET original series \"Reed Between the Lines\" opposite Tracee Ellis Ross.\n\nWarner's voice may be as well known as his likeness, for four seasons he was heard as the voice of the \"Producer\" on PBS' \"The Magic School Bus.\" Currently, he can be heard on the audio book version of \"The Marvelous Effect\" published by Berkley Trade, as well as in Simon & Schuster's \"Fatherhood\" by Bill Cosby. When not acting and directing, Warner is a poet and a bass player. His jazz-funk band Miles Long has performed in several major jazz festivals, including the Playboy Jazz Festival, and has opened for high profile artists including Earl Klugh and the late Luther Vandross, and he recently performed at the historic Apollo Theater. Both of Warner's independently distributed CD's, \"The Miles Long Mix Tape\" and \"Love and Other Social Issues\". Warner is set to release brand new music, fall 2014.\n\nWarner currently lives in Los Angeles, California.\n\nThe legendary gangsta hip-hop emcee Ice-T was born Tracy Marrow on February 16, 1958, in Newark, New Jersey. He moved to Los Angeles, California, to live with his paternal aunt after the death of his father while he was in the sixth grade; his mother had died earlier when he was in the third grade. His aunt lived in the South Los Angeles district of Crenshaw, colloquially referred to as South Central. He became immersed in the street life of the inner-city and eventually became a member of the West Side Rollin 30s Original Harlem Crips.\n\nIn 1979, Marrow joined the Army after leaving Crenshaw High School, but his 4-year hitch was enough for him, as he was a leader, not a follower. \"I didn't like total submission to a leader other than myself,\" he said. After ETSing from the Army in 1983, he returned to South Central with the intention of becoming a hip-hop musician. More than music, his life got caught up in street life as as a jewel thief and as a pimp. (His nomme de guerre, Ice T, is an homage to the fabled pimp and raconteur Iceberg Slim (Robert Beck). He committed himself totally to his music after a 1985 car crash.\n\nAs a musician, Ice-T played a major role in the creation of the gangsta incarnation of hip-hop music and was a colossus of the West Coast hip-hop scene, despite his East Coast, greater New York, origins. Though his music displays a political consciousness, like the indictments of racism that were a hallmark of seminal hip-hop group Public Enemy, it also is nihilistic as befits a chronicler of street life. His most infamous song, the heavy metal \"Cop Killer,\" was one of the major battle in the cultural wars of the 1990s, in which cultural conservatives enlisted the Moses of the right wing, Charlton Heston, to get Ice-T dropped from his then-label, Sire/Warner Bros.\n\nThe charismatic Ice-T has also achieved success as an actor in movies and on TV. He plays Detective Odafin Tutuola on the TV series Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (1999), which is ironic for someone famous for \"Cop Killer\" and his feud with the L.A.P.D. Ice-T currently resides in North Bergen, New Jersey, with his wife, Coco Austin.\n\nCommanding performer Bill Nunn made his feature debut in fellow Morehouse College graduate Spike Lee's School Daze (1988), but really etched himself into moviegoers' minds as a formidable screen presence in his second film with Lee, Do the Right Thing (1989), playing Radio Raheem, whose ever-present boom box is at the center of a fight that leads to his death at the hands of an overzealous police officer, the prelude to the all-out riot that follows (Nunn also acted in Mo' Better Blues (1990) and Spiel des Lebens (1998) for Lee). Though he made his initial mark playing young street toughs on screen, this veteran of the Atlanta stage showed he could use his impressive size for something other than menace with a critically acclaimed performance as Harrison Ford's sympathetic, high-spirited physical therapist in In Sachen Henry (1991). Nunn subsequently played pretty much every type there is, all the way up to nice, huggable teddy bear guys like Whoopi Goldberg's protector Eddie Souther in Sister Act - Eine himmlische Karriere (1992).\n\nHis professionalism made him a favorite of other directors besides Lee. He portrayed a Southern police chief in Bill Condon's White Lie (1991) (USA Network), later reteaming with Condon for Candyman 2 - Die Blutrache (1995), and has also acted twice for Michael Apted (Extrem... mit allen Mitteln (1996), HBO's Mit dem Rücken an der Wand (1998)) and Gary Fleder (Das Leben nach dem Tod in Denver (1995), ...Denn zum küssen sind sie da (1997)). Nunn also turned in a fine performance as Tim Roth's adoptive father in Die Legende vom Ozeanpianisten (1998), Giuseppe Tornatore's first English-language feature, released initially in Italy and then in the United States in 1999. He can also be seen in Spider-Man (2002), Im inneren Kreis (2002) with Al Pacino and the prison thriller Lockdown (2000).\n\nNunn has also found time to do numerous television pilots and three series. He was in the CBS series Traps (1994) with George C. Scott, sitcom Local Heroes (1995) for NBC and the critically acclaimed Der Job (2001) with Denis Leary on ABC. He appeared on episodes of Chicago Hope: Endstation Hoffnung (1994), Ein Hauch von Himmel (1994) (both CBS), New York Undercover (1994) and Millennium (1996) (both Fox), among others.\n\nNunn lived in Georgia with his wife Donna and daughters Jessica and Cydney.\n\nRussell Wong has earned a reputation as a sexy, charismatic leading man whose good looks are matched by his skills as an actor. The sixth of seven children, Russell Wong was born in Troy, New York; the son of restaurateur William Wong and Dutch-American artist Connie Van Yserloo. When Russell was seven years of age, his parents divorced, and he moved with his mother to California, settling near Yosemite. Russell attended Santa Monica College. As a trained dancer and a martial artist, Russell is able to perform many of his own stunts.\n\nRussell made his big screen debut in James Clavell's \"Tai Pan\". He made a memorable guest appearance on the drama series \"21 Jump Street\" and won a leading role in Wayne Wang's acclaimed independent romantic comedy \"Eat a Bowl of Tea\". Supporting roles in \"China Cry\" and \"New Jack City\" soon followed. In 1993, Russell gained critical acclaim for his outstanding performance in \"The Joy Luck Club\".\n\nRussell scored a high-profile role in 1994, when he was cast in the leading role in the made-for-TV movie \"Vanishing Son\" produced by Rob Cohen, in which he played a Chinese political activist exiled in America. The show was popular enough to spawn three sequels, and was later spun off into a syndicated TV series. People magazine named him one of the \"Fifty Most Beautiful People\" in 1995.\n\nAfter \"Vanishing Son\" ran its course, Russell moved on to more big-screen work, including major roles in \"Takedown\", co-starring Skeet Ulrich, and \"Twisted\" with Sam Jackson and Ashley Judd. His breakthrough performance opposite Jet Li in \"Romeo Must Die\" firmly established Russell's star power.\n\nRussell is next seen in this summer's blockbuster \"Mummy 3\" directed by Rob Cohen, as well as \"Dim Sum Funeral\" a black comedy co-starring Bai Ling and Kelly Hu. He will star alongside Ving Rhames in the martial arts thriller \"Unshakable\" this Fall.\n\nVanessa Estelle Williams (Actress, Singer, Writer, Director) born and raised in Brooklyn, NY, is a talented force that came to Hollywood in the 90's with passion purpose and staying power.
