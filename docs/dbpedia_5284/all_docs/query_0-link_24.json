        "text": "Executive Director\n\nPaul Briley\n\nPaul Briley is the Executive Director of Legal Services for Prisoners with Children. Paul focuses on fines & fees among other legal monetary sanctions that burden formerly incarcerated individuals and disproportionately impact low-income people and communities of color. He grew up in the Bayview-Hunters Point district of San Francisco, a community that has seen its fair share of social problems over the years.\n\nAs a child Paul was displaced by the foster care system and subsequently fell into a deep cycle of recidivism. The juvenile dependency court deployed him to a military boarding school for troubled youth. This instilled a great deal of consciousness and respect for different people and different places, but it also sparked an immense amount of curiosity and concern within. The majority of individuals confined were impacted by public policy.\n\nAfter aging out of foster care Paul became politicized through Project Rebound and learned how to use his carceral experience as a catalyst for change in social justice. He attended San Francisco State University and became an advocate for system impacted students on campus. He transferred to the University of California, Berkeley and became a student ambassador for the Berkeley Underground Scholars, a student-led organization of formerly incarcerated students on campus working to expand the prison to school pipeline. During undergrad, Paul noticed significant differences that distinguish one community from another and how social programs, public policy laws, and monetary allocations create these community distinctions. He explored how multiple areas of study intersect with one another and majored in interdisciplinary studies with a specific goal in mind, ​utilize the inside knowledge of institutions and systems currently in place to help people from marginalized groups.\n\nAll of Us or None presented an opportunity in 2019 to become a Ronald Elder Freeman Policy Fellow. He was trained to become a community organizer and policy advocate for formerly incarcerated and convicted people as well as their families. During his fellowship, Paul helped draft the language for ACA 6 which restored the right to vote to 50,000 people on parole in California. He also helped lead the People over Profits campaign in San Francisco, an ordinance change that required the City and its vendors to stop generating revenue from incarcerated people and their loved ones. San Francisco became the first city in the nation to make jail phone calls free and end the markup of commissary items in the county Jail. The victory in San Francisco permeated throughout California influencing larger legislation cosponsored by LSPC making phone calls free inside of all CA state prisons.\n\nThe People over Profits ordinance was an important change but it didn’t help people who still lacked the funds to purchase from the commissary. To go a step further, Paul created the Commissary Allowance Program in San Francisco, which allows incarcerated people who lack financial support to receive a small monthly allowance to pay for basic necessities. This is the first program of its kind in the country.\n\nPaul extends his efforts to those who have fallen victim to social forces and will work to reconstruct the policies that have allowed this to happen. Unbound by the institutions of previous order, he is creating an alternative discourse independently of the dominant social group. Paul has an insatiable appetite for resilient truth, obtaining knowledge that produces solutions, and creating ways to sustain institutional change.\n\nManaging Director\n\nDr. Tanisha Cannon\n\nDr. Tanisha Cannon is a dedicated and compassionate advocate for social justice, committed to making a lasting impact on the lives of prisoners and their children. As the Managing Director of Legal Services for Prisoners with Children, she brings a wealth of knowledge and experience in the fields of education, sociology, criminal justice, and public administration.\n\nDr. Cannon earned her Doctorate in Educational Leadership with a focus on social justice from California State East Bay in May 2023. Prior to that, she pursued her undergraduate studies in sociology and completed a Master’s in Public Administration. Her academic background has provided her with a comprehensive understanding of the complex issues surrounding underserved communities and the criminal justice system.\n\nDr. Cannon’s passion for creating positive change stems from her personal experiences. Having witnessed firsthand the effects of the criminal justice system on her own family, with her mother, brothers, and grandfather all experiencing incarceration, she is deeply committed to challenging the status quo. As a juvenile, she also faced direct impacts from the system, giving her a unique perspective and a sense of urgency to work towards systemic reform.\n\nThroughout her career, Dr. Cannon has actively engaged with underserved communities. She dedicated her time and expertise at the Oakland Housing Authority, where she worked tirelessly to address the needs of marginalized populations. Additionally, her role as a Cultural Strategist with the City of Oakland allowed her to collaborate with government officials and community leaders to develop initiatives promoting equity and inclusion.\n\nShe believes in the power of civic engagement and community organizing to drive meaningful change. Her dedication to empowering individuals and creating systemic solutions sets her apart as a leader in her field.\n\nDr. Cannon firmly believes that her works at LSPC should be organized around principles of caring, compassion, love, and humanity. Drawing inspiration from the concept of Ubuntu—a Zulu South African philosophy of humanism—she recognizes that while individuals have diverse lived experiences, their shared humanity is the foundation for affirming and validating their voices. She strives to prioritize the human element in her work, placing greater emphasis on the stories, experiences, and perspectives of individuals rather than reducing them to mere numbers and charts.\n\nBy incorporating these principles into her role as Managing Director, Dr. Cannon ensures that her work is guided by empathy, respect, and a commitment to amplifying marginalized voices. She seeks to create a space that recognizes and values the inherent dignity and worth of every individual, fostering an environment that promotes equity, justice, and positive change.\n\nDr. Cannon will continue to champion the cause of justice and support the families impacted by incarceration. Her tireless efforts, combined with her extensive knowledge and personal experiences, make her a compassionate and effective advocate for systems change.\n\nAREAS OF EXPERTISE: Community Engagement, Organizational Structure, Intimate Inquiry (Qualitative Data), and Strategic Planning\n\nStaff Attorney\n\nKellie Walters\n\nMy name is Kellie and I am from Chicago. I graduated from DePaul University in 2001 and then spent two years working as a domestic violence counselor in an emergency shelter. I began my legal education at The John Marshall Law School in January 2003. During that time, I was an intern at The Fair Housing Legal Clinic for four semesters and spent several semesters employed as a legal research assistant.\n\nIn 2006, I obtained my Juris Doctor degree and was admitted to the Illinois Bar. Later that year, I enrolled in Northwestern Lewis and Clark Law School in Portland, Oregon, seeking an LL.M. in Environmental and Natural Resources Law. During that time, I wrote my LL.M. thesis on the oil drilling in southeast Nigeria, its effect on the Ogoni tribe, and the ongoing litigation. During that time, I also taught seminars at the Portland Community College about the relationship between Environmental Law and Human Rights.\n\nUpon returning to Chicago, I worked with the Civil Rights Center litigating cases involving police misconduct until they closed their doors in 2009. After which, I started in private practice, focusing on criminal defense and civil rights cases. From 2015 through 2020, I was a supervising attorney for the housing section at UIC – The John Marshall Law School Domestic Violence and Family Law Clinic. In 2021, I began working as a Staff Attorney with LSPC and I’m really excited to work on the policy side of civil rights matters.\n\nCommunications Manager\n\nTaSin Sabir\n\nTaSin Sabir is an artist with a message and is most driven when she can use all her artistic skills (photography and graphic design) towards a cause that she is passionate about. In 2004 TaSin graduated from California College of Arts and Crafts, where she received a BFA in Fine Arts Photography. Born and raised in Oakland California TaSin’s artwork has been exhibited all around the Bay Area and Nation. A natural born journalist, TaSin has contributed regularly to the San Francisco Bay View Newspaper and YO! Youth Outlook. TaSin is community focused and at one point opened a community gathering space called The OakPod. During its time it was a vibrant place where people could come and experience local art and entertainment. Since its closure TaSin has focused on her freelance business, working with businesses and nonprofits to elevate their brand and public message.\n\nIn 2016 LSPC contacted TaSin to design their annual report. Since then TaSin has continued a professional relationship with LSPC as their go to designer for projects like, building and maintaining the LSPC website and designing marketing materials for campaigns. TaSin is excited to join LSPC as fulltime support and continue to work with an organization that she respects very much.\n\nPolicy Analyst\n\nJeronimo Cuauhtemoc Aguilar\n\nJeronimo Cuauhtemoc Aguilar is a Chicano Indigenous of Purepecha descent and Policy Analyst for Legal Services for Prisoners with Children. After completing the 2021 Elder Freeman Policy Fellowship, Jeronimo was brought on to the LSPC staff as the organization’s Policy Coordinator. Shortly thereafter, he was promoted to Policy Analyst midway through 2022 and has not looked back since.\n\nJeronimo’s combination of lived experience, system impact via incarceration of many family members, and a propensity for critical thinking and analysis has been a strong addition to Legal Services for Prisoners with Children. His background in radical organizing as a former Brown Beret, student activist, and community organizer has set him up uniquely to always stay rooted in the community no matter how much time he has to spend with capitol staff, elected officials, and other stakeholders.\n\nJeronimo graduated from CSU Sacramento with a Bachelor’s Degree in Ethnic Studies with a concentration in Chicano Studies and has organized on many levels including city government, county Board of Supervisors, Federal (immigration advocacy), and of course his current focus on CA statewide legislation.\n\nJeronimo’s leadership has included helping found the Abolish Bondage collectively campaign (ABC) which has led to LSPC’s cosponsorship of ACA 8 The End Slavery in CA Act, helping train and launch similar campaigns in Wisconsin, Kentucky, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Missouri through the ABC National apparatus.\n\nIn addition to leading the policy efforts on ACA 8: The End Slavery in CA Act, he also has been LSPC’s policy lead for the Living Wage for All campaign in CA via AB 1516 a bill aimed at raising the minimum wage of all workers including incarcerated workers, The Fair Chance Coalition looking to pass legislation that limits discrimination in the employment and hiring process, and Fair Chance Housing at the statewide level; to name a few recent policy endeavors.\n\nJeronimo’s been quoted and interviewed by the Real News Network, LA Times, Newsbreak, KQED, and writes the monthly “Policy Update ” section included in the AOUON Newspaper which goes into all California prisons. He also authors the policy updates for the monthly E-news/newsletter which is available to our members and the public.\n\nRegional Advocacy and Organizing Associate and Interim CFU coordinator\n\nLawrence Cox\n\nLawrence Cox was born in Oakland, CA and at an early age was not privileged to socio-economic permanency. This was simply “not available to me” according to Lawrence.\n\nLike many youth growing up in the Bay Area, he was exposed to obscenities, drugs, addictions, and violence. Before the age of 7 he became a ward of Alameda County touring California’s anemic foster care system. However this did not deter him and as a teenager he began advocating for policy reforms for youth in the system through community organizing.\n\nNearing emancipation Lawrence describes that things began to spiral, “This time I had slipped at my own doing, becoming a product of my environment and a replica of my troubled parents. I lost focus of my goals and I became a victim to social, economic, and psychological degradation.”\n\nThis time Lawrence would become a ward of the State of California for almost seventeen years. This adversity, although bleak and monstrous, changed his life. This experience that he had to endure challenged him and stripped him down and exposed him to the darkness and hopelessness only incarceration does. Lawrence persevered despite everything, becoming the man he is today.\n\nLawrence joins Legal Services for Prisoners with Children committed to creating change for those affected by the prison system. After almost 17 years of triumphs, struggles, introspection, growth, and education, Lawrence’s prominent focus is finding ways to reverse systematic disenfranchisement and the infrastructures that perpetuate these inequalities.\n\nIn-custody Program Coordinator\n\nJesse Burleson\n\nJesse is the In-custody Program Coordinator at LSPC and an AOUON organizer. Born to Black and Native/Mexican parents, he grew up in the Tenderloin District of San Francisco, a drug-infested community filled with poverty and despair. He spent much of his youth in and out of juvenile detention facilities before being sent to adult prison with a life sentence in 1987 where he was held from ages 18 – 49.\n\nDuring his imprisonment Jesse went on a personal journey of learning and development through rigorous studies of histories, laws, religions, philosophies, governments, sciences, and war. Jesse was released in 2018 through the compassionate actions from the children of the man he killed, who came to his hearing with forgiveness in their hearts and an open acknowledgment for his personal growth and maturation.\n\nJesse says that while inside prison he discovered that prisons really are designed government-run “slave quarters”. Although “integrated” Jesse believes that the prison system itself was purposely designed to “manage” large segments of this country’s former slave population, mainly its Black male population, after the Civil War. Jesse believes the U.S. government sent Black people from slavery (poverty) to segregation (poverty) to integration (but still poverty), and that instead of giving the former slave population land and wealth upon their “freedom”, the U.S. government decided to subject the former slaves to discrimination, poverty, poor education, access to drugs, guns, disenfranchisement, and then “criminalization” and the eventual “return” to the plantation; i.e. prisons.\n\nJesse believes that Moral & Political Literacy and Political Engagement is vital in the struggle for human rights and access to meaningful resources, and that there is vision and meaningful leadership amongst the formerly incarcerated."
