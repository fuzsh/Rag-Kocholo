Even looking at previous versions (see here) they aren't displaying it.--Rockchalk717\n\nI haven't noticed, was this fixed? Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nYesterday apparently. In this revision the reserve list is still not there. After this edit it displays. The capitalization fix? --DB1729 (talk)\n\n...cont. I just made the same edit on the Jags template. Revision from earlier[1] no IR. Change 'Lists' to 'lists'[2] it's there.\n\nI guess I'll go around and make this change on all of them? --DB1729 (talk)\n\nI just double checked and it looks like you got them all, good stuff! Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nI should've noted here when I was done. Thank you for confirming. Funny that all the other elements work fine despite the inconsistent capitalization. Reserve Lists was probably intended to behave the same way. When I first discovered WP, I myself was a bit startled by its use of sentence case in titles/headings. After all this time we still need crutches like that for MOS:SECTIONCAPS non-compliance. DB1729 (talk)\n\nHere's the issue that was introduced in the template. Now either the template needs to be re-coded for both capitalizations, changed back to the former, or the parameter needs to be updated everywhere that uses Template:NFL roster (Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:NFL_roster). Eagles 24/7 (C)\n\nOh I see now. Thanks. I was thinking something probably changed somewhere, but that it had somehow accepted either capitalizations before.\n\nYeah it should put back to {{{Reserve Lists}}} at Template:NFL roster. And also then, that parameter in all the teams' roster templates will need to be put back to |Reserve Lists=. I have changed any that weren't already converted, even if they were empty e.g. DB1729 (talk)\n\nI've changed back Template:NFL roster to use \"Reserve Lists\" and changed back all of the current NFL roster templates. Eagles 24/7 (C)\n\nThis has been an issue with the templates in recent years, and I feel like we should standardize the protocol. Should players placed on the PUP and NFI lists at the start of training camp be shown on the reserve lists, even though they still count on the active roster? I feel like in years past the list was renamed to \"active/reserve lists\" or something and the players are given \"Active/PUP\" and \"Active/NFI\" designations, but still count towards the active roster count. Couple options I thought of was either keep the players in the active roster and just add the \"Active/XXX\" designation, or if we want to group the players together, maybe create a separate list than \"Reserve Lists\". I'm open to anything, I just want to standardize what to do. Jrooster49 (talk)\n\n@Jrooster49: I think keeping those players in the active roster section but adding their designations (like \"Active/PUP\") makes sense. Eagles 24/7 (C)\n\n@Eagles247: I've discovered a problem with this though. If you go to the Chiefs roster template you'll see it. If it's a section we don't list a positon, like QB, RB, or WR, the \"Active/PUP\" parameter doesn't function properly.--Rockchalk717\n\n@Rockchalk717: You'll have to use |4=Active/PUP in those cases, as I've done here. Eagles 24/7 (C)\n\n@Eagles247: Gotcha I'll remember that. The player that made me post this has been activated since but I'll remember that.--Rockchalk717\n\nA requested move is under discussion at Talk:Acrisure Stadium § Requested move 22 July 2022. ––FormalDude talk\n\nFor anybody who doesn't want to follow the link, it was a snow close for oppose. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nI've started a discussion on Talk:List of National Football League career passing completions leaders about lists that combine regular season and post season stats. Only two pages out of the list of articles on Template:NFL Lists contain a combined list. I removed them today but my removal was reverted and this discussion was started as a result. I just wanted to share that a discussion was taking place in case anybody had any interest in it. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nI tried to search for whether this has been discussed before, but unfortunately this suggestion by GPL93 is the closest I got. They mentioned also excluding academic teams in a reply and it was not directly responded to by anybody.\n\nI want to see if there is any objection to updating WP:NFLINFOBOXNOT to include academic team honorees. I strongly believe it doesn't belong in the infobox under achievements as it has nothing to do with their on field performance. In 2021 alone there were 699 football students who earned the Academic All-Big Ten honor, awarded to players who carried a cumulative GPO of 3.0 or higher.[1] Hey man im josh (talk)\n\n@Hey man im josh: In the infobox, no. Even in the article period, I think only academic All-American should be mentioned as that is more exclusive. Athletes getting good grades is more common than I think most people realize as is evident roughly 47% of Big Ten football players making academic All-Conference, academic accomplishments should be reserved even within the article for Academic All-American or things like Magna Cum Laude and Summa Cum Laude or the William V. Campbell Trophy also known as the Academic Heisman.--Rockchalk717\n\nNo conference academic awards in the infobox, as it's generally not a core part of a players' notability. FWIW, I think college basketball Academic All-American are listed in the infobox, but I'd leave it out per MOS:INFOBOXPURPOSE to have it be more exclusive and not an exhaustive list.—Bagumba (talk)\n\nI've gone ahead and made the changes to the player format page. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nHas someone been messing with the NFL team colour templates? I don't know if it's showing up for anyone else, but infoboxes in certain Vikings season articles are showing up with a black secondary title (see 1999 Minnesota Vikings season for example). – PeeJay\n\nSeems to be that way all the up to the 2013 Minnesota Vikings season. I also just checked out the Vikings' draft navboxes. Anything prior to 2013 has a black footer. So, the team's colours appear to have been defined as purple and black up until the 2013 season (at least by Wiki formatting). Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nThat must be a very recent change as it wasn't like that a couple of weeks ago. Unfortunately, I can't work out where the change may have been made. Any ideas? – PeeJay\n\nSo, looking at the templates for draft navboxes, I eventually found that all colours are pulled from Module:Gridiron color/data. This page was changed a number of times in August by User:Charlesaaronthompson. This includes an item at line 219 which changes the colour for the Vikings from 1960 to 2012. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nOh, what a surprise that Charles is responsible. Mind fixing that, Charlie boy? – PeeJay\n\nYes, I have fixed that now. The problem was that when I had added an entry for the Minnesota Vikings' team color codes at Module:Gridiron color/data, I had forgotten to add a border color. I have fixed that now. The Vikings' draft navboxes should not have a black footer now. Charlesaaronthompson (talk)\n\nThat fixed it, thank you! Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nIn his infobox, LaDainian Tomlinson's position is currently listed as \"Special assistant\". This is technically true, but it's quite a minor ambassadorial role (the citation in the article describes it as \"largely symbolic\"), while he's primarily known as a running back. Similarly, John Elway is listed as a consultant rather than a quarterback. Should individuals be listed by their most famous role, by their current role, or maybe both? Harper J. Cole (talk)\n\nThose ought to be changed. Template:Infobox NFL biography says the position field is \"used to display the player's most frequently played position\" and doesn't mention anything about post-playing careers. Hatman31 (talk)\n\nI get what you're saying, but what do you do with a guy like Dieon Sanders? Or Hall of Fame linebacker / general manager John Lynch?\n\nMy opinion is that you have them as their current position with whatever team they're a part of, in whatever capacity they're currently in, or you add an additional parameter for situations like this. Something that encompasses a post-playing career role, specifically as an executive or coach and not including going into being an analyst or TV personality. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nLynch's position could easily be listed as Linebacker / General Manager, or a new parameter could be added as you suggest. I think either of those options would be better than the status quo. Hatman31 (talk)\n\nWould we then list only the more important non-playing roles (e.g. head coach, general manager), or also more minor roles (e.g. special assistant, consultant). Head coaches and general managers are notable in their own right, after all, whereas Tomlinson's special assistant role wouldn't merit a mention if it wasn't being filled by a Hall of Famer. Harper J. Cole (talk)\n\nI think that's essentially the right way to go about things; head coach, general manager, and possibly coordinator positions should be included, while special assistant and consultant roles aren't necessary; they should probably be mentioned in the lead but not the infobox. Hatman31 (talk)\n\nAll,\n\nLooking at LaDainian Tomlinson#NFL records, there are 59 records listed, a lot of which seem rather obscure (e.g. Most games with 14 or more points in a season, Most consecutive seasons with 6+ rushing touchdowns). I feel these obscure the more significant records (e.g. Most single season touchdowns, Most consecutive games with a touchdown). They're also largely unsourced, or sourced with broken links. Is there a general rule deciding which records are significant?\n\nThanks, Harper J. Cole (talk)\n\nRely on your gut instinct and if you're unsure go to the talk page. I'm not aware of any rule but I would agree the more obscure records can be deleted. We're supposed to rely on summary style on Wikipedia. Therapyisgood (talk)\n\nOof, looking at these there's a whole lot of cherry picked stats and unnecessary WP:FANCRUFT, much of which may fall under WP:TRIVIA. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nHey man im josh, not to mention, the number of citation needed tags throughout the section. I totally agree with you, a good bit of it falls under WP:FANCRUFT. SPF121188 (talk this way) (contribs)\n\nSome of those CN tags were from me. I reformatted the section, removed some records (more should honestly be removed), and started to add citations. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nOh! fair enough. I didn't check to see how long the tags were there, but yeah it does seem like some could be removed. The section itself looks good aesthetically, just a little bloated (which it seems there's agreement on.) SPF121188 (talk this way) (contribs)\n\nThe LaDainian Tomlinson records section is super crufty. Any record worth mentioning here should be mentioned explicitly by some reliable source, not merely minable from a reliable database. Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nHave at it people. Slash what you think is appropriate. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nSo, I guess that each record should have two citations: one from a reliable source, showing that the record is notable, and one from a database to show that the record still stands? Harper J. Cole (talk)\n\nThere appears to be some confusion over whether or not during that season, they were the Racine Cardinals or the Chicago Cardinals. GoodDay (talk)\n\nIt looks like they used both names in 1920 and 1921. As the NFL Record & Fact Book has them in the standings as the Chicago Cardinals that season, I'd suggest that is the name we should use. I don't know how to rename an article, though. Harper J. Cole (talk)\n\n@Harper J. Cole: To move an article, click on the box saying \"more\" next to \"view history\" and \"edit source\" at the top of the page. Then a button saying \"move\" should pop up. Click that and it will let you rename the page. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nThanks - it looks like there's a procedure for potentially controversial moves. I can imagine people disagreeing with this, so I'll follow that procedure. Harper J. Cole (talk)\n\nJust want to inform everyone that a certain editor has recently been running around and copying content (duplicating would be a better word for that) from team history (for example, History of the New York Jets to main page (for example, New York Jets. I have already reverted the editor's edits and want to see everyone other's opinions about it. – Sabbatino\n\nYeah I wasn't a huge fan of those changes. If they want to combine the two pages as they are they should propose a merge instead of duplicating the text. I saw they posted about this on your talk page and I encouraged them to open a dialogue here if they want to make large changes like that across all the franchise articles. I also mentioned it in a few of the reverts I did of their changes. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nI can understand the dislike of the changes. Just trying to have all 32 teams have a similar history section. Individual history sections are a bit messy and I do believe that the history should be on the main page of each individual team. I have had some positive feedback from what I have been trying to achieve. I think this discussion should go further and we should consider merging the history pages with the team pages and cataloging them in an encyclopedic fashion. Whiterabbitzero (talk)\n\nThat's what the separate articles that each team have are for though. By including that, you're stretching out the article, and when does it become too much? By having a separate history page we can go more in depth while keeping the main franchise page to the key points, with pointing to other articles that expand further. I feel like the massive histories of some teams being listed in depth as they are, on the history pages, being included in the main articles would actually dissuade people from reading further. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nStill new to editing. Should have created a discussion first. Thanks for the feedback :) Whiterabbitzero (talk)\n\nA relevant guideline is Wikipedia:Summary style, where details are typically left for the subtopic article.—Bagumba (talk)\n\nBased on that guideline (\"The original article should contain a section with a summary of the subtopic's article as well as a link to it.\"), it seems to me that the history sections on team pages are typically too long. E.g. the history section in Los Angeles Chargers is about 6,200 words, while the dedicated history pages History of the Los Angeles Chargers and San Diego Chargers add up to about 9,100 words. Far from being a summary of the history subtopics, the history section is well over half their length, with extensive duplication. It's pretty much the same story for every NFL team. Really, the summary should only be a couple of paragraphs. Harper J. Cole (talk)\n\nLearning a lot here. Great point about that the team history pages being a better place than the team main article. I think that those should at least be cleaned up and cataloged better Whiterabbitzero (talk)\n\nI was attempting to organize all 32 NFL team articles history section into a format that all 32 teams would have, to make the history sections more encyclopedic.\n\nThe format that I came up with is as follows:\n\nFranchise History\n\nSubheading 1) Owner era (years owned) *can combine eras if ownership was for a short period of time\n\nSubheading 2) Head Coach years (years coached) *only coaches who have won SB/NFL championship, AFC/NFC champ, and/or Division champ\n\nSubheading 3) SB/NFL/AFL champions (year won)\n\nany other subheading could also include relevant information such as a relocation or other footnote of team history.\n\nI am also thinking that perhaps there should only be two subsections (Owner & championship) and leave out head coaches. Obviously there are more head coaches in NFL history than owners.\n\nAs far as separate history pages are concerned I do believe (after the great points brought up by @Hey man im josh) that there should be a summarized history on the main team page, while this format should be included on the more extensive \"History of\" pages. Also clean up the history pages. Most of them are very messy and should be cleaned up regardless.\n\nMy goal here is to have all 32 teams conform to the same format for history section so that we have a sense of continuity. This could also apply for the order of each section for all the team pages. Since I was informed that it is better to start discussion before making any mass edits, here I am. Just wanted to get everyone's opinion on the matter. Have a great day everyone!\n\nWhiterabbitzero (talk)\n\nThere are some teams where it might make more sense to talk about city eras than owner eras, e.g. the Raiders' history breaks down quite naturally into Oakland-Los Angeles-Oakland-Las Vegas, whereas Al Davis was their owner for 39 years. Also, with the Colts it seems more natural to think in terms of the Manning era than any of their head coaches. That said, I can see the benefit of a consistent system and wouldn't object if people prefer that. Harper J. Cole (talk)\n\nIt's a disservice to make it so mechanical. Franchise owners are rarely definining for an era, and neither are head coaches inherently so, exceptions being iconic ones like Lombardi, Belichick, etc, but it's just as likely to be notable for a player or other reason, e.g. History of the Pittsburgh Steelers#The 1970s: The Steel Curtain dynasty.—Bagumba (talk)\n\nI'd have to agree with Bagumba. It's not a bad idea by any means, but not every NFL franchise fits this cookie-cutter template. -- StarScream1007 ►Talk\n\nHello. There is an issue with the current tournament brackets used in NFL pages, such as {{14TeamBracket-NFL}} implemented on 2021 NFL season. The background colors used cause an accessibility issue. Specifically, neither the red nor the blue background is WCAG AAA compatible for standard blue links and purple visited links. Per MOS:COLOR, we should be meeting the AAA standard whenever possible. It is in my opinion that the colors are largely unnecessary, and we should be using the standard grey background that is used for every other team bracket, such as {{8TeamBracket}}. Nonetheless, the accessibility issue should be addressed. – Pbrks (t • c)\n\nWhat do you do when a team's website lists a player as one thing, and their depth chart lists them in a different position? The most prominent example I've seen so far is that Von Miller's player page lists him as a linebacker. But if you look at the Bills' depth chart, he's listed as a defensive end. It makes it a pain to define positions for team roster templates.\n\nAlso, what do we give more weight to when deciding which position for a player is accurate? A team's website, NFL's website, or Pro-Football-Reference? I've seen all three list something differently, but when a player is a free agent and not on a team, I personally find PFR to be more reliable for a player's position, but I'd like to establish consensus on which to lean on in times of dispute. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nI'd generally go with the depth chart over their \"official\" position, but even that can be iffy or just straight up wrong. In cases like that I would try to just go for a more encompassing term, like edge rusher, defensive back, or offensive lineman.\n\nAs for which is more accurate, I will always go with the team's website for position, jersey number, height, and weight. The only reason people even use NFL.com for that sort of thing is because of its integration in the infobox. I still think we can have the team's profile page for that player get automatically pulled from |current_team= since the URLs are standardized across all 32 teams (with the exception of some Dallas players for some reason, but those can be manually fixed). I'd even go with PFR over NFL.com since they tend to respond quickly to any errors unlike NFL.com ~ Dissident93 (talk)\n\nI'd prefer to list edge rusher on some players' pages, as it's more accurate for some guys, but it's something I don't see gaining steam when most official sites don't use that term for a player's position. One difficulty with the depth charts is when simply list \"DL\" for all 3 slots they plan on utilizing in a 3-4 defense. Technically we can infer that the middle \"DL\" spot should be NT, but we don't actually know. Same thing when they list all 4 slots as DL, like the Lions do. But when it's explicitly defined in the depth chart, I do lean towards that as being their official position.\n\nPulling the player's page from the team's site is actually a great idea if it's as feasible as you say. There is one particular user out there who bases a lot of their edits for weight off the NFL's page, which typically goes un-updated from the point they're drafted. Completely agree with referencing a team's player page for weight since they're the ones who would be most knowledgeable, and more likely to keep a player's weight up to date. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nThird-party reliable sources take priority over profile pages, so if they are consistently cited as just a pass/edge rusher then we shouldn't have any problem using that here too. And the 3-4 DL issue you brought up are even easier to figure out since their roles are more defined and thus are generally mentioned in the media.\n\nAnd I'm well aware of that user, I've told him that eventually NFL.com and PFR updates their weights with the same one listed on the team's page but they did not care. ~ Dissident93 (talk)\n\nAre team websites considered third party? I'm sure PFR would be considered as such, but the team websites is where I get confused for that. Perhaps we should add something to the WP:NFLINFOBOX that mentions team websites should be prioritized for height and weight over NFL and PFR. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nNo, they would be considered a primary source (WP:PRIMARY) while PFR is a database that verifies information but does not establish notability. We'd also need consensus to stop using NFL.com for player measurements. The last time I tried to propose such a thing, it died as it lacked much discussion. ~ Dissident93 (talk)\n\n@Sergio Skol: Just wanted to send a ping in case you had any interest in participating in the discussion. Pinging you because I updated Von's position based on the depth chart and you changed it back based on the team's position listed on his player page. No hard feelings about it, because I don't think either of us is technically wrong, but I thought you might want to contribute to the discussion. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nMy preference is for both to be listed, the \"actual\" position (usually listed on the depth chart) and the \"technical\" position (what's listed on the player profile and matching the player numbering rules). In the case of Miller, sources for both positions are about equal weight (primary sources from the team) so I wouldn't include one over the other. Qwaiiplayer (talk)\n\nThis is where I lean towards edge rusher being a listed position personally. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nWell, about the positions of the players, I'd prefer to give more importance to the depth chart of the team, and if they're listed as DL or DB for example, write it down like this, in the Von Miller's case I changed his position from DE to OLB because #40 is technically illegal to wear for DLs, and his profile says he's a LB, but if he's listed as a DE, I'd rather write that here too. Sergio Skol (talk)\n\nGood point about the jersey numbers, I hadn't factored that in. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nTex Kelly, a player with 17 games in the NFL, has been nominated for deletion. See here for the discussion. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nAh BeanieFan11, the perpetual saver of articles that go to AfD. I love how you always seem to expand pages significantly and save them from deletion. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nThere is a project on Wikimedia Commons to add structed data elements to as many files as possible. One of the important data elements is the Depict statement which says what is depicted in the image. A very easy to use tool called Depictor has been written using a game like interface to add Depict statements to Commons images. It's very easy and anyone can do it. I have created a challenge on the Depictor tool site to add Depict statements to all of the possible photos of NFL players on Commons. If anyone would like to help you can find the challenge here. When you click on the link you will be shown a known photo of an NFL player on the left and another photo on the right . If the photo on the right showns the NFL player you just click on Yes, if it doesn't click on No, if you are not sure then click on Skip (On a mobile device the known photo will be on the top and the other on the bottom). There is a Youtube video describing the tool and how to use it here Thanks Captain-tucker (talk)\n\nOh this is cool. I've already started chipping away. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nMade a small dent in it. Useight (talk)\n\nWhat's the best way to request new parameters for the Template:Infobox NFL biography? I do a lot with infoboxes and there's been something that's been bugging me. We have \"statseason\" and \"statweek\" parameters for players that make it easy to know when the statistics in the infobox were last updated, but it's difficult to tell for coaching records. I'd like to suggest new parameters such as \"coachstatseason\" and \"coachstatweek\". Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nAs it's got template protection, I would suggest establishing consensus at a well-watched place like here at WT:NFL. If after consensus it's still not completed by a passerby with permission, make a formal request at that template's talk page with a link to the prior discussion.—Bagumba (talk)\n\nThanks for the answer, I've never had to request any parameters for an infobox so this was good to know. I guess I'll hope I get feedback based on this post, unless it'd be better off to start a fresh section with a better section title and just the proposal without the question. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nI'm trying to gain consensus to determine how Matt Araiza's entry into the NFL should be described in the lede. The current structure states that \"joined the National Football League (NFL) when he was selected by the Buffalo Bills in the sixth round of the 2022 NFL Draft\". I might be wrong, but I feel like referring to a player's entry as \"joining the league\" is rather uncommon and also not super accurate given the specifics of the draft/udfa process in the NFL. Any attempt to reword the sentence is undone by another editor. Personally, I feel like stating that Araiza was selected in the 2022 NFL Draft by the Buffalo Bills is perfectly fine and we can leave out the National Football League article entirely but I'm open to any suggestions and just coming to clear consensus either way. Best, GPL93 (talk)\n\nThat is funny sounding. I think PeeJay improved it , but I thought I'd ping @Bluerules: to contribute to the discussion. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nWe have to reference National Football League in the lead because it's the biggest notability factor of the subject. If a player is a free agent, I generally think it's best to say he \"began his career in the National Football League\", but since Araiza was cut before the regular season, I don't think that's the most appropriate wording for him. I support PeeJay's revision - he still did enter / join the league by being on the Bills roster and other free agent / former player articles aren't always the best basis because they leave out vital details. Bluerules (talk)\n\nI don't think that it has to especially given that the Bills and the Draft article links make it pretty apparent. Maybe spell out the league's full name for the 2022 draft link? GPL93 (talk)\n\nIt's not apparent for anyone who doesn't know what NFL stands for - and like I said, being in NFL is the biggest notability factor for the subject. The problem with spelling out NFL in the draft link is the draft article is \"NFL Draft\" and expanding it would be awkward. Plus, we still wouldn't have an NFL hyperlink. I support maintaining the current version. Bluerules (talk)\n\nAlternative: Araiza joined the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League (NFL) after they selected him in the sixth round of the 2022 NFL Draft. Introduces \"National Football League\" while avoiding \"joining/entering the National Football League\". —Bagumba (talk)\n\nI agree with Bluerules, the league should be mentioned and linked with the abbreviation next to it in the lead. The team's association to the NFL is obvious to us but it's not obvious to people unfamiliar with the sport. It's standard that we mention it in the lead of most players and former players, more often than not being mentioned in the very first sentence. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nUser Hey_man_im_josh and I have been having a disagreement over how to show player positions on the Dallas Cowboys' roster template. He says we should follow the team's roster as listed on the team's website (which I retorted often has small inaccuracies), while I believe we should primarily follow official game notes provided to the NFL by the team if they are available. Example here:\n\nhttps://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/cowboys/x6xabe1bghed4yb814uh.pdf?email=cmV2YW5mYW5AY29tY2FzdC5uZXQ=&utm_term2&utm_term3\n\nThose are the team's official game notes provided to the NFL and to the fans through the Dallas Cowboys United program. I feel that should be the primary authority for player positions on the template, with the team's website as the secondary source. RevanFan (talk)\n\nAs for what should we follow when teams don't publish game notes? Again, I say use the team's website as a secondary source, along with reports from reporters covering the team. RevanFan (talk)\n\nI don't think either one of us is wrong in this instance, but it's a question of what do we prioritize? It's easier when a player plays the game, but when they're just on the practice squad, there's not nearly as much information for a player.\n\nMy concern with the PDF linked is that they mention free agency moves, and reference Watkins as a DT signing. My view is that players shift positions all the time, and that it's better to rely on the depth chart and position listed for a player by the team itself. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nIn general, I've always gone by: 1. Game notes. 2. Reports from respected team beat reporters. 3. The official team website. 4. Other sources (NFL.com, etc.) In the past, the roster posted on dallascowboys.com was HIGHLY inaccurate. They wouldn't note jersey number or even some roster changes for WEEKS on end. It was so annoying. They're better at it now, but I stopped trusting them as a primary source due to how late they were on updates in years past. Some teams are better than others at timely updates to their roster. RevanFan (talk)\n\nAlso I'll note that the reporters and webmasters who publish depth charts on the official team websites, at least for Dallas, will often stress that they are \"unofficial\". Meaning their depth chart page isn't that great of a source usually. 18:00, 20 September 2022 (UTC) RevanFan (talk)\n\nAs for your concern about players moving around a lot, that's why I like to list primary and secondary positions if players have them. For example, Watkins. He mostly is a DT but he sometimes plays off the edge. Therefore, I list him as DT/DE. If a player plays more than two positions, I only list the top two. But most players don't play more than two positions. RevanFan (talk)\n\nI support using the team's website. It represents a general overview of the roster, which is what the roster template is supposed to provide. The game notes prioritize the individual game, not the season as a whole. Bluerules (talk)\n\nThere is a discussion about the order of scores (i.e. winner–loser vs. loser-winner) at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject American football § Score order in articles about players.—Bagumba (talk)\n\nI'm reviewing 1987 San Diego Chargers season for GA, and asked on Talk:1987 San Diego Chargers season/GA1 about profootballarchives.com. I can't tell if it's a one-person site or not, but it doesn't seem to have any information available that would help me establish it's reliable. The nominator, Harper J. Cole, found this, but it's just a forum post, so I don't think it helps. Does the site get referenced as reliable by professional sports news organizations, for example? That would be good evidence. Mike Christie (talk - contribs - library)\n\nAs far as I know, PFA is considered a reliable source (its been as a reference at least 1,500 times here and I've found it accurate in just about all cases). There appears to be some news sources which have cited it as well, see The Ball State Daily News, San Antonio Express-News, The Dispatch, The State, Indianapolis Recorder, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, 247Sports, The Sport Journal, and the Burlington Free Press. Its pretty much the only good source you can get for minor league football statistics from the 1910s to 1970s. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nI've also found it very reliable. Never had an issue with it. As Beanie said, it's particularly good because its data extends beyond just the NFL and covers other pro leagues, including CFL, USFL, World Football League, Dixie League, American Association, etc. Whether it's one person or 100, their research is crazy impressive -- they even compile the years when players lettered in college ball. Cbl62 (talk)\n\nThanks, that settles it for me -- the links to news organizations treating them as reliable is just what I was hoping to find. Mike Christie (talk - contribs - library)\n\nI've found minor quibbles here and there. For example: PFA shows Fran Tarkenton getting sacked 44 times in 1961: https://www.profootballarchives.com/playert/tark00200.html while PFR shows him getting sacked 41 times: https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/T/TarkFr00/gamelog/1961/. Of course, PFR's stats are blank for two games, so it's possible that Tarkenton was sacked three times between the two games, but PFR's 41 sacks show him losing 425 yards while PFA's 44 sacks have it as only 416. Probably just a case of sack statistics being unreliable, as a whole, prior to 1982. Useight (talk)\n\nHello. Rather than going to the talk page, where it is unlikely to be seen, I wanted to bring this right to the WikiProject. Bluerules has significantly reduced the lede of Gardner Minshew claiming there is no substance to this content. In all of my athlete bio GAs, I typically utilize a format where one paragraph is devoted to amateur career and the next to professional. This has never been seriously disputed. Rather than unproductive edit warring, I thought to propose the question to a larger audience. I am unlikely to be responsive today, as I have other obligations that require me to be offline. — GhostRiver\n\nThe lead of Gardner Minshew suffers from WP:UNDUE and unnecessary bloat. There are references to Wyatt Rogers, Tyler Hilinski, Alex McGough, and Tanner Lee, who are mentioned only once or twice in the body of the article; Rogers does not even have his own article. His time at East Carolina and Washington State, the two major college programs he played for, is stretched out across three sentences and 431 characters. I condensed this into one sentence with 227 characters that maintains the most important information: him setting a conference record and winning a major college award. This is information that's buried in the current lead by significantly less notable information (high school and junior college championships, which normally wouldn't warrant notability for an article). Conversely, key information about his professional career - the most notable component of his career - is missing from the lead. There is no mention of him setting a rookie franchise and no mention on him currently holding a backup role on his team. And even if this was added, the reader is overwhelmed by information about his amateur career before they can get to his professional career in the lead. Again, the subject's professional career should be the priority in the lead.\n\nThis is veering into WP:OTHERCONTENT territory, but there is no guideline requiring an entire paragraph to be dedicated to the amateur career. Scott Zolak's article has less than a sentence about his amateur career in the lead and that's an FA. The lead of Zolak's article is almost entirely about his professional career. Bluerules (talk)\n\nI'm with Bluerules on this one. Too much in the lead that should be moved to another section, if retained. Useight (talk)\n\nI also agree with Bluerules, with the lone exception of mentioning he played at Northwest Mississippi Community College prior to East Carolina. The lede is way too bloated. Best, GPL93 (talk)\n\nI wouldn't mention high school career in the lead, save for someone with national honors. Follow MOS:LEADREL:\n\nAccording to the policy on due weight, emphasis given to material should reflect its relative importance to the subject, according to published reliable sources. This is true for both the lead and the body of the article.\n\n—Bagumba (talk)\n\nFrom the Matt Araiza thread above, I noticed that his lead shows his college as \"San Diego State\", piped from San Diego State University. At a previous discussion, there was a rough consensus that we link to the school's football team (e.g. San Diego State Aztecs) in the lead, which is also consistent with the infobox. Is there a new reason to not follow that? —Bagumba (talk)\n\nWhen I was working on the Corey Dillon page in late 2020, Rockchalk717 changed the hyperlink for Washington Huskies football in the lead to University of Washington. I've been following that example since.\n\nI can't speak for Rockchalk and don't know if he still supports this approach, but I support hyperlinking the school over the school's football team because it is grammatically correct (the player played \"at\" the school, not \"at\" the football team). Furthermore, there are situations in which it's more appropriate we give the school's full name. For example, it needs to be clear Kenny Pickett's college Pittsburgh team is not the same as his NFL team. There are also individuals such as Steve Largent and Herschel Walker who are notable outside of football and referencing their school in the lead also identifies their educational background. This is the standard I've seen for politician's articles, which applies to Largent and Walker. Bluerules (talk)\n\nYes I do 100% support linking and using the school's name, especially if it says something like \"...played college football at (school)\". It's partially because we already have the football page linked in the infobox so I feel like the school should be linked in the opening.--Rockchalk717\n\nThe ones in the infobox are WP:EASTEREGG links. I don't see any valid reason why we shouldn't be listing the team name instead of just the school. This seems like yet another 2000s-era Wikipedia policy that we stuck with without questioning why. ~ Dissident93 (talk)\n\nUsing the school is grammatically correct (Kenny Pickett played at the University of Pittsburgh, not at Pittsburgh Panthers football) and allows for more flexibility if the subject becomes notable outside of football. The team name is unneeded space, especially when college teams are usually referred to by just the school name. Bluerules (talk)\n\nI am fine with the status quo for a former player's alma mater. What is an anomaly are coaches with stints in both pro and college, e.g. Jim Harbaugh, where the team name is inconsistently omitted in the team history listing. —Bagumba (talk)\n\nPlayed for: My preferred wording in the lead is the format He played college football for the San Diego State Aztecs (e.g. [[San Diego State Aztecs football|San Diego State Aztecs]]). I agree that \"played at\" should never be mixed with an MOS:EGG link to a school program.—Bagumba (talk)\n\nMy issue with \"played for\" is it adds unnecessary wording - \"played college football at San Diego State\" gets the same information across as \"played college football for the San Diego State Aztecs\" in less words. Plus, the college team's name typically isn't used for an NFL's player's background. NFL profiles don't identify the college team name for players and only the school name is used when a player is drafted. Bluerules (talk)\n\nMy perspective is that a link in the lead of a football bio to the actual college football program, San Diego State Aztecs football, is more relevant to a football player than merely its location, San Diego State University. As noted, \"played college football at\" should not have an EGG link to San Diego State Aztecs football, so we word it as \"played college football for the San Diego State Aztecs\", linking to the footbal program. —Bagumba (talk)\n\nLike I mentioned above, I find it more flexible to hyperlink to the school because some subjects become notable outside of football - Steve Largent held federal office and his educational background shouldn't be limited to him playing football in college. And it's not the \"location\", it's the school itself. It's what the football program is part of. I find the school more relevant because that's the main article. Bluerules (talk)\n\nThis wording (or something similar) makes the most sense to me as well. If someone wants to get to the school's main article instead it's just one extra click. Hatman31 (talk)\n\nThe school's football team is also one extra click from the main article - and we're able to include both by having the main article in the lead and the football program in the infobox. Bluerules (talk)\n\nNot everyone who reads the lead necessarily looks at the infobox, and it's MOS:EGGy to have two links with the same display go to different pages. Likewise, the school link is one click away from the football program page. —Bagumba (talk)\n\nI find that the school article should be more obvious than the football program article (which also typically appears in the body of the article) on account of it being the main article and the aforementioned grammar (\"at\") indicates where the hyperlink is headed. The \"one click away\" point applies to both articles. Bluerules (talk)\n\nThe more relevant article is almost always the team's article, which certain exceptions if the subject is more notable for something outside of football. The subject's coverage about their time spent in college is usually in the context of them as a member of the football team and not as a student, As Bagumba pointed out in the previous discussion. I believe that this should also extend to when linking schools in reference to scholarship offers. Scholarship offers and status are controlled entirely by the football program, a coach can revoke a scholarship or withdraw a scholarship offer with a high degree of autonomy. Generally the academic administration is involved is the admissions process, which is usually just rubber stamping an application as long as minimum standards are met, and issues regarding discipline for off-field incidents (and even then not always) and eligibility to remain a student at the institution given that the NCAA determines eligibility to play and not much else. Best, GPL93 (talk)\n\nThe school article is not about only academics. It is about the school as a whole, including the football team, and the player ultimately represented the school. This is demonstrated by only the school being mentioned when a player is drafted and only the school being shown in player's official NFL profiles. There are also other cases in which the school needs to be spelled out, such as Kenny Pickett (to draw a distinction between his school and NFL team) and Ben Roethlisberger (to establish he played at Miami University in Ohio, not the University of Miami). To display the school's full name, but hyperlink the football program (as I saw done with Pickett's article) is misleading improper piping.\n\nAs for scholarship offers and status, the football program is controlled entirely by the school. The school hires and fires the coaches. Again, the school article represents the school as a whole, not just the academic administration. In the case of Matt Araiza's article, the altered wording caused the SDSU acronym to be lost - and if the school's full name is used, the school should be hyperlinked to ensure proper piping. Mac Jones' article once had a normal hyperlink to the University of Kentucky, but presented a hyperlink to Alabama's football team as the University of Alabama in the same sentence, which was inconsistent and confusing. Bluerules (talk)\n\nIt is incredibly common for state universities to be referred to as \"X State\" without \"university\" while maintaining the \"U\" acronymn, so we aren't exactly \"losing\" the acronym. And yes, on a super-macro level the school is involved, but it is certainly not misleading to link to the football program as the reference is to what team they played for, rather than the school they attended. GPL93 (talk)\n\nWe are losing the \"U\" acronym if we're putting \"SDSU\" right next to \"San Diego State\". In text, what the acronym stands for should be provided in full. And the school's involvement isn't macro-level - the football program answers to the school. It may not be necessarily wrong, but when the football program is already hyperlinked in the proceeding college career section, it's more appropriate to have a school hyperlink in the early life section. Bluerules (talk)\n\nYou're really starting to get on my nerves with your pernickety attitude towards things on this site. People refer to the school as \"SDSU\" and \"San Diego State\". The fact that the acronym doesn't perfectly match the longer name is totally irrelevant, since people don't call it San Diego State University in everyday discourse. Why must you insist on making everything difficult? – PeeJay\n\nI recommend reading WP:NOPERSONALATTACKS before you write another comment like this one. The fact that the acronym doesn't perfectly match what it's supposed to stand for is completely relevant because you cannot assume everyone knows what SDSU stands for and when we provide an acronym in text, we are supposed to establish what the acronym stands for in full. SDSU stands for San Diego State University; we reference the full name and give the acronym to ensure the information is complete for all readers. Simple as that. Bluerules (talk)\n\nIf he played college football for SDSU, he played for San Diego State. The \"University\" is redundant, especially since most people don't refer to the institution as San Diego State University. Thanks for playing. – PeeJay\n\nIf we are identifying what creates the acronym SDSU, we identify where every letter comes from - San Diego State University. The current version of the page says \"San Diego State University (SDSU)\", neatly providing each piece of the acronym. The proposal is to say \"San Diego State (SDSU)\", which fails to provide each piece of the acronym and makes the \"U\" look like it came from nowhere. If \"University\" was redundant, it would not be in the acronym. What people refer to the institution as is irrelevant - what's relevant is the proper name. Most people apparently not referring to the institution as \"San Diego State University\" doesn't impact the article being called \"San Diego State University\" and it doesn't change how we identify what makes up an acronym. Thanks for playing. Bluerules (talk)\n\n...the altered wording caused the SDSU acronym to be lost...: The SDSU expansion is already in the body, which satisfies MOS:ACRO1STUSE. —Bagumba (talk)\n\nThe SDSU expansion is in the body because of the current edit. The proposal is to remove the expansion. And that's not the only issue with the proposal - schools are more commonly hyperlinked in the early life section and the football program is already hyperlinked in the following section, making the school hyperlink more appropriate. Bluerules (talk)\n\nThe proposal is to remove the expansion: No, the proposal is whether to link and display the football program in the lead. That is independent of whether or not an abbrev like SDSU gets introduced later in the article.—Bagumba (talk)\n\nThe schools are not more commonly hyperlinked and because the offer is specifically to play for the football program it is much more relevant. It is also usually easier to get to the school article from the team article than the other way around. Also, the argument has been made that this is common and acceptable for the \"University\" part to not be included but to still use the \"U\" acronym. The MoS states that acronyms do not need to be written out in full. Best, GPL93 (talk)\n\nThe schools are more commonly hyperlinked in \"Early life\" sections in general. For football players, it is actually more common to not even mention the schools / college football programs in this section because there is a section immediately following it about their college career. And in this context, both the school (which is much more relevant in the context of the offer because the football program answers to the school) and the football program (which is more relevant once they start playing college football) can be hyperlinked. Since Araiza's article mentions his offers in the \"Early life\" section instead of the \"College career\" section, it is redundant to have two hyperlinks to the football program follow each other. Not only is still easy to get to the program article from the school article, there's still already a football program hyperlink. Having the school hyperlinked in the \"Early life\" section is both more appropriate and avoids the redundancy. The argument for \"University\" to not be included was not an effective one because it ignores how acronyms work. When we give the full name before giving the acronym, we are supposed to give the actual full name. Bluerules (talk)\n\nNo, that's not the proposal being discussed in this conversation. This conversation shifted to a discussion over the \"Early life and high school\" section, which currently says Araiza committed to play at \"San Diego State University (SDSU)\" and hyperlinks the school. The proposal in this conversation is to change the wording to \"San Diego State (SDSU)\" and hyperlink the football program. One of the issues (and not the only issue) with this proposal is it removes what the acronym stands for in full. Bluerules (talk)\n\nIn this case, do we even need the acronym? Can't we just refer to them as San Diego State throughout? – PeeJay\n\nUsing SDSU is an editorial decision that is independent of whether we have the football program link in the lead. After the lead, the body can say something like \"at San Diego State University (SDSU)...\" if one chooses to use SDSU for some brevity and variety.—Bagumba (talk)\n\nWhat's the harm in using the full name in the body? That's where the school hyperlink can be used alongside the football program hyperlink. Bluerules (talk)\n\nThis conversation shifted to a discussion over the \"Early life and high school\" section...: I didn't catch that you went on a tangent. Getting back to the lead, linking the football program there doesn't preclude linking to the university later in the body; those are independent issues.—Bagumba (talk)\n\nGPL93 brought up a proposal to change the school hyperlinks in the body to football program hyperlinks and I explained my opposition to this proposal. I don't have an issue with hyperlinking the football program in the lead and the school in the body; I'm opposed to having two hyperlinks to the football program right on top of each other, which would be the result of changing the hyperlinks in the \"Early life and high school section\". At the very least, there should be a hyperlink to the school, even if it's not in the lead. Bluerules (talk)\n\nI'd suggest modifying the body to something like \"Araiza committed to play college football at San Diego State University (SDSU) for the Aztecs...\" I've seen the argument made that non-sports fans and non-Americans may be more familiar with the university, so a link to it at some point makes the connection more obvious. —Bagumba (talk)\n\nAgreed. We could move the information about his college offers from the \"Early life and high school\" section to the \"College career\" section, where it's more appropriate. Bluerules (talk)\n\nCan I get some project members to comment on Matt Birk's talkpage please? I'm in a discussion with someone about mentioning he won the Walter Payton Man of the Year award in the opening.--Rockchalk717\n\nA group of current NFL players have been nominated for deletion.

However, due to the article's importance being rated \"Low\", no one has been able to update it (increasing the episode count and adding the weekly NVP). I've been doing this for nearly a month, and I am tired of being the only contributor. Feel free to reply with any thoughts about this. BrickMaster02 (talk)\n\nI'm confused. What do you mean when you say no one has been able to update it because of it's importance being rated \"Low\"? The article's importance rating to the WikiProject has no bearing on whether someone is able to edit an article or not. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nI was told that the reason why no one else was doing it was because the article's importance was rated \"Low\". I don't know if I'm missing something, but it's weird how no one else has taken advantage of the article whenever a new episode airs. BrickMaster02 (talk)\n\nThe majority of articles that have the WikiProject tag and an importance rating set have the importance set as \"low\". The stats for class and importance can be found here. Quick stats:\n\nUnrated - 19,345\n\nLow rating - 9,767 (65.6% of rated)\n\nMid rating - 3,907 (26.3% of rated)\n\nHigh rating - 722 (4.9% of rated)\n\nTop rating - 487 (3.3% of rated)\n\nI think you're seeing low participation in that article because of a lack of interest in the topic, not because of its rating. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nI don't know why anyone isn't editing the article, as it's related to the NFL. I don't want to continue editing it, as it is getting old being the only one contributing. BrickMaster02 (talk)\n\nContributing to Wikipedia is voluntary, both for yourself and others. Don't feel obligated if you have other interests. —Bagumba (talk)\n\nI proposed adding the team abbreviations to the infoboxes (or at least the articles bodies) here. Please state your opinion. Thanks. -- Angus (talk)\n\n@Angus, can you give an example where you would want this mentioned in the infobox and/or article?\n\nI don't see how this would be a benefit in the main space of an article. Personally I prefer referring to Detroit Lions as the Lions in an article after the first mention, but I understand my preference may not be the same as others.\n\nAs for the infobox, I don't see the benefit of adding an abbreviation for the team. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nThe main purpose is to make the reader aware that when they see ATL on the top of nfl.com, it means the Falcons. How would it be mentioned, I'm not sure. It could be after the name\n\nThe Atlanta Falcons (ATL) are a professional ...\n\nand/or in the infobox, maybe with its own heading after \"Team Nicknames\". --Angus (talk)\n\nSo there's some problems with stat tables, including some inconsistencies and some things being done that don't make much sense. For starters, when it comes to career highs there's some strange things being done. For example, it seems career highs for interceptions and fumbles are being marked in bold for some reason, despite those being stats where the higher the number, the worse the stat is. Career high is to identify the best a player has done in the individual stat. Why are we identifying a career worst stat line? It doesn't make any sense. Next, games played and started. These are getting career highs marked. But what makes that seem pointless is instance like Brett Favre who played and started 16 games in a seasons for 17 seasons in a row. I've removed these on some players, especially ones who started/played 16 games multiple times. Next is quarterback rating. If a quarterback throws a 75 yard touchdown on his first pass attempt of the season then has a season ending injury before he can attempt a 2nd pass, his quarterback rating would be a perfect 158.3 which would be a career high. Obviously that's an extreme scenario but for something like that, do we decide on a minimum attempts? I feel like we need to answer these questions because there's a lot strange stuff happening to player stat tables.--Rockchalk717\n\nLooks like the strange stuff has been happening for a long time. When I see career high, I think what was his career high in interceptions ... oh, his high was 23 in 2016. It states 'high'. Maybe it should read 'career best'. The reason I started saying things was because for months, 99% of the players are marked that way. So when I saw Tua, Mahomes, Allen and Murray with career lows .... I shook my head. Maybe we can wipe the whole slate clean and remove 'career highs'. Bottom line, does it really matter? Especially if we have multiple opinions. Going round and round makes no sense. I saw another user change the NFL infobox template for a different matter weeks ago, and who is going to uniform all the player pages? Nobody. Let's all make up a rule. With each passing week I find another section to stay away from. Hope it all works out everybody. Bringingthewood (talk)\n\nIf it's any consolation, even Pro-football-reference ranks those with the most interceptions as the highest.[3]. This is a problem with terminology and dealing with negative stats like interceptions, fumbles, and sacks, where the most on offense isn't necessarily the best. We could say these are technically the \"high\" and correct as is. If we were to change it, then relabel it as \"best\" instead. —Bagumba (talk)\n\n@Bagumba and Bringingthewood: I actually had Patrick Mahomes stats as career best for a long time but after enough times of people changing it to career high and then marking interceptions with the highest, I added a tooltip. Then Bringingthewood came in and removed it marked the actual highs on interceptions and claimed \"it wasn't broken\". It is broken because we're doing something that doesn't make any sense. I noticed a while back pro football reference does it. Honestly I'm even willing to stop marking career highs altogether just purely because of these issues. NFL.com doesn't provide career highs neither does ESPN and it's not like it's something somebody can't figure out themselves just by looking at the stats.--Rockchalk717\n\nI'd suggest changing the legend to read \"Career best\", instead of relying on a tooltip to explain why the \"high\" is sometimes a \"low\". I have no objection to removing it altogether; however, practically speaking, I expect a lot of drive-by copycats to just add it back, which happens often on NFL pages, so the regulars will need to be patient in educating others and avoid getting into edit wars. I'll defer to the editors who regularly patrol the stats tables and those who plan to make the changes. —Bagumba (talk)\n\n@Rockchalk717: I removed it because I didn't think it was you who put it there. You're a thorough person and I figured it would be on dozens of other players to correct. I needed a seeing eye dog to find a line that I never thought would ever be on the table. Why look for it when for months it was done a certain way. I apologize. I thought another user fixed what wasn't broken for a few players. And why not the sack section? This all went through my mind at the time. Believe me, I'm not here to aggravate people on purpose, that's why I no longer remove the statweeks and statseasons. Hopefully most of the player pages will be easy to understand soon. Bringingthewood (talk)\n\n@Bagumba and Rockchalk717: Yes, the \"Career best\" does sound very good if the decision is to keep it. Or like Rockchalk717 mentioned, scrapping it completely might not be the worst thing going forward. Letting the readers do a little homework looking over the stats won't be the end of the world. At least the colored tabs are right to the point and easy to understand. Bringingthewood (talk)\n\nJust chiming in to say I'm in agreement that it should be phrased as career best instead of highest. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\n@Bringingthewood: It's all good. If we do go with career best, what Bagumba said is 100% right. We're gonna get a lot of those editors coming through completely unaware of this conversation. New policies take time to implement on this project because we do have a high amount of inexperienced editors that edit frequently on player pages.--Rockchalk717\n\n@Rockchalk717, Bagumba, and Hey man im josh: Hi Josh, I was hoping you would chime in, lol. I'm glad I'm good with Rockchalk and I agree with Bagumba also, it'll take time. Whenever this project begins I'm all for helping out. Bringingthewood (talk)\n\nIf the project plans to change every page, I'd recommend standardizing on a legend and stat row header with a template, e.g. Template:NBA player statistics legend and Template:NBA player statistics start.—Bagumba (talk)\n\n@Bagumba, can a template be set up in a way similar to infoboxes, where a parameter in use would add the column and have a predefined display order? Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nShould be doable. —Bagumba (talk)\n\nI am totally ok with creating something like that, but I've never created a template like that from scratch, I've only done ones where I could copy and paste. I'm sure someone on this project has the skill set to create that and have it look good. If did a stat thing, we'd definitely have to have a parameter for each position to display certain stats for each position. Something like \"position=QB/RB/WR\" etc.--Rockchalk717\n\nWould certain stats be mandatory by position, or do we leave each column up to the editor? —Bagumba (talk)\n\nI'd say leave the columns up to the editor, with guidelines in the documentation for what's considered standard. There are outliers for each position and sometimes certain stats are relevant to include, so flexibility would be ideal. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nToo much flexibility also defeats the purpose of a template. Maybe have standard rushing, receiving, and passing stats, and have each group be toggled? —Bagumba (talk)\n\nTrue. The original reply I typed out had 5 possible default templates:\n\nPasser\n\nSkills player (receiving and rushing both listed)\n\nOffensive lineman\n\nDefensive player\n\nKicker\n\nCan you have multiple groups of columns toggled or would you only be able to select one? If you can toggle multiple column groups it could allow for separate receiving and rushing groups to be included for players like Christian McCaffrey and LaDainian Tomlinson. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nMultiple groups can work. I think if we can agree on the requirements, a template editor can then point out if there are any limitations. We would also want to specify that passing stats come first for a QB, but come after rushing stats if we show for some RB like Tomlinson.—Bagumba (talk)\n\nI think we're on the right track. It's late for me now but I have some ideas on the groupings that I'll write up tomorrow morning unless someone puts forth something solid before then. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\n\"Skills player\" as defined above makes sense as a category, but is very non-standard terminology. Normally \"Skill position\" includes QBs, and non-lineman defensive players. Maybe Deebo's \"wideback\" coinage's time has come? Runceiver? 109.255.211.6 (talk)\n\n@Bagumba, I took a stab at it here and made what I believe should be the default template by position. I broke it down by subtemplates and included possible subtemplates that could be added for positions like kick and punt return. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nActually I should have pinged @Rockchalk717 and @Bringingthewood for input too. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\n@Hey man im josh: I like I only have a comment for offensive linemen. There's not enough stats for them to really justify a stat table for that position because things like sacks allowed and pancakes are hard to find consistent reliable stats for. As a former offensive lineman I wish there was, but unfortunately there isn't.--Rockchalk717\n\n@Rockchalk717: Personally I agree with you, but stat tables in that format do exist on some linemen pages so I included it anyways. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nThanks for asking, but there are three very smart computer oriented people here. Whatever you choose ... point a finger of where I should go and I'll start to shovel. You see, this is why I never fix anything, lol. But I do have to say, you guys definitely seem to like doing different things. Good group of editors!! Bringingthewood (talk)\n\nGood work. A few comments: For fumbles on offense, is there a reliable source? I notice that Ben Roethlisberger#NFL career statistics has different numbers for \"Lost\" than at pro-football-reference.com. For Defense, \"PD\" seem like it should not be the first item for a section labelled \"Interceptions\". Move it to the end? For tackles, it's still an unofficial stat IIRC. Which site's stats do we normalize to? —Bagumba (talk)\n\nI've re-arranged the interception section to put \"PD\" at the end of the interceptions category.\n\nRegarding fumbles lost, I'm in favour of removing it altogether but I included it as it was listed in a lot of stat tables. I believe recovery rate of the fumble is a team stat, not an individual QB stat, as they're usually not the ones to recover said fumble anyways. I've long argued something similar for Fantasy football, in that, the recovery rate of the fumble shouldn't cause a QB to lose fewer points, all the points should be based on the simple act of fumbling.\n\nI compared Ben's fumbles lost stats across various stat databases:\n\nFootballDB - Career fumbles lost: 51/115\n\nStatMuse - Career fumbles lost: 51/115\n\nPro-Football-Reference - Career fumbles recovered by player or team: 40/115\n\nPFR's stat implies Ben lost 75 fumbles. That's way off compared to the other sites and I don't have an explanation as to why it differs so much. I feel like I'm missing something, but I'm going to think on it.\n\nAs for the tackles, that's a tough one for me and something I've been bothered by for a while. I've wanted to create an annual tackles leader page but NFL and PFR list different stats in a lot of cases. I'll compare the stats across sites later on, but from what I've seen, the NFL infobox and stat tables usually match the stats listed at PFR. I'll try to find instances where they're different and see what's listed in stat tables. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nWithdrawn, Randy Kryn (talk)\n\nWhen Brady gets his 100,000 combined season and playoff passing yards mark, probably next week if he plays and his offensive line can stand up while keeping their shoelaces tied together (both individual feet and all of them as a unit), reputable media will likely highlight that. Even though the Wikipedia page List of NFL career passing yards leaders was stripped of this combined stat a few weeks ago, I'd suggest that it be brought back when further sourced reputable media focus on this record (counting not only the WikiProject's \"accepted\" media criteria but all reputable media sources as per Wikipedia accepted sources). It is not a \"Brady page alone\" type of stat, as when reputable sources highlight the 100,000 mark they are also recognizing that statistic as a \"thing\" by 1) mentioning it, and 2) comparing this Brady mark to other quarterbacks career combined passing yards, thus making it encyclopedically notable as a career passing record. Randy Kryn (talk)\n\nStrong oppose, this topic was settled less than 2 months ago and included a RFC on the issue. The discussion can be found here. Put it on Brady's page and not on the career passing yards page.Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nStrong Support Settled? Well, the 100,000 mark is almost upon us and I'm guessing more reputable media than the sources used to settle the matter will come into play (to coin-flip a phrase). This is not just a Brady mark but a career NFL quarterback stat, let's go with the sources as we do on all other Wikipedia pages. Randy Kryn (talk)\n\nIt should be noted that this opinion was cast by the same user who started the discussion. Other users who pass by should not be misled to think there is an additional “support” viewpoint. Frank Anchor\n\nThanks Frank Anchor for pointing that out, my mistake. I've seen nominators add their opinions but this one wasn't that, it was just a quick response to the \"oppose\" and I got carried away. Will probably withdraw this but I'll wait until tomorrow to see if anyone agrees or comes up with a good aternative, maybe a stand-alone page on the event (Brady obtaining 100,000 career passing yards) if it is, as I expect, widely covered in major media. Randy Kryn (talk)\n\nNo problem. It can get easy to get caught up in the heat of an argument. Frank Anchor\n\nVery strong oppose the NFL has historically kept regular and postseason stats separately and this has been discussed at length before with consensus to keep stats separate in all cases. Getting 100,000 yards is impressive, but the official NFL convention to record regular season stats and postseason stats separately. Frank Anchor\n\nStrong oppose. I concur with Hey man im josh. This may be worthy of mention at Tom Brady pending coverage, but we're still a no-go on a combined list here. Jweiss11 (talk)\n\nOppose In line with other editors comments, not to mention I've personally never been a big fan of when regular season and post season stats are combined.--Rockchalk717\n\nWithdrawn, although would a page on the achievement be acceptable (this event would seem to be page worthy outside of the Tom Brady page)? Randy Kryn (talk)\n\nI personally don't see a milestone as being page worthy but it's up to you whether you want to give it a shot, I could very well be wrong. As long as you won't be bothered if it gets taken to AfD by someone (won't be me) and don't mind putting in the work. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nHey man im josh, thanks. Will check what kind of media the mark picks up, both before and after next weeks game (that is, if he manages to pass 164 yards). Hopefully they will stop the game to announce it and give Brady the ball. Randy Kryn (talk)\n\nComment The record alone would likely not warrant a standalone page. As for a list of combined leaders, I'd expect multiple players' totals to be discussed in sources per WP:LISTN:\n\nOne accepted reason why a list topic is considered notable is if it has been discussed as a group or set by independent reliable sources, per the above guidelines; notable list topics are appropriate for a stand-alone list.\n\n—Bagumba (talk)\n\nHello Bagumba, will be interested in the amount of coverage. By reliable sources covering the 100,000 mark they would arguably be pointing out the mark in comparison with other players' total passing yardage, even if no other names were mentioned. I'll wait to see what occurs next week and if a new page is created will alert the wikiproject on here. Randy Kryn (talk)\n\nAnother point to consider is the spirit of WP:PERSISTENCE:\n\nEvents that are only covered in sources published during or immediately after an event, without further analysis or discussion, are likely not suitable for an encyclopedia article. However, this may be difficult or impossible to determine shortly after the event occurs, as editors cannot know whether an event will receive further coverage or not. That an event occurred recently does not in itself make it non-notable.\n\nSimilarly, I'd be wary if there was some coverage of this grouping immediately after Brady presumably hits it, but notsomuch after. —Bagumba (talk)\n\nStrong oppose NFL records do not recognize playoff and postseason stats as career stats, and instead only recognize regular season stats. It's a nice trivia point for Brady's page but this simply isn't recognized by the league. Toa Nidhiki05\n\nI wanted to call attention here to Wikipedia_talk:Vital_articles/Level/5#Add_Warren_Moon_and_if_necessary_remove_Doug_Flutie.--TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD)\n\nThe article has expanded to candidates beyond just Flutie and Moon. Click on the link above to participate. Cbl62 (talk)\n\nThe current proposals are:\n\nAdd Warren Moon\n\nAdd Night Train Lane\n\nAdd Jim Parker\n\nAdd Gino Marchetti\n\nAdd Walter Camp\n\nRemove Doug Flutie\n\nRemove Ray Guy\n\nRemove Kurt Warner\n\nRemove Joe Namath.\n\nClick on these links to weigh in. Cbl62 (talk)\n\nThese are getting out of control for players. Inexperienced editors and IPs keep adding as many stats parameters as they can and even occasionally adding stats the player hasn't recorded yet for rookies. At this point, I'm tempted to suggest just eliminating the stat parameter but I wanna give setting a standard a try first. The only place that will get complicated is with quarterbacks and we include rushing stats. At one point, Tom Brady had rushing stats included. I've also removed sacks from several defensive backs' pages and interceptions from several defensive linemen pages. I'm proposing setting a standard for each position and figuring out what the standards will be, and possibly (if it's not too difficult) programming this into the infobox.--Rockchalk717\n\nSounds good. To cut these lists down would look much better. When I was an IP user I did add parameters, but for a player that had a good total in their career. The amount of zeros I see now makes no sense. I've removed some parameters lately from retired players that had for example '0 - sacks' listed. The player is already retired. I agree with Rockchalk717, It would be nice to have a standard going forward in order to stop the nightmare regarding the rookies. Bringingthewood (talk)\n\n@Bringingthewood: Truth be told I'm more concerned about every quarterback having rushing stats, every defensive back having sacks (that have one), and every defensive lineman with an interception having them listed but yes the rookie thing is getting obnoxious too.--Rockchalk717\n\n@Rockchalk717: By the way you just explained it, I can see your concern. Those three things should definitely take top priority for having a new standard. Unfortunately the quarterbacks that are extremely mobile need those stats to be listed. When passing used to be priority number one, there wouldn't even be a discussion. Bringingthewood (talk)\n\n@Bringingthewood: Oh I agree, but we need to create a solid definition for what we consider a \"running quarterback\" to determine what we need. Most are pretty obvious like Lamar Jackson, Josh Allen, Colin Kaepernick, Michael Vick, etc. but there's some that might be questionable.--Rockchalk717\n\n@Rockchalk717: I agree 100%. Just like what Justin Fields did last week will keep his name on the sheet. To stop some of these users from adding things when they see a few good weeks will be a chore I'm sure. Hopefully someone will read all this and have good input. I know I can screw things up with the best of them, I just need someone to stop me fairly quickly. Like you said, a 'solid definition'. That's how the stat table mess began, I saw other pages and ran with it. A solid definition would stop new users and IP's from running also I believe. Bringingthewood (talk)\n\nI support its removal per your reasoning. ~ Dissident93 (talk)\n\nYes definitely. Let's see if other active editors on this project wanna give some input. It seems some sort of change is gonna be coming.--Rockchalk717\n\nLess is definitely better for NFL infoboxes, per MOS:INFOBOXPURPOSE. Frankly, career stats for active players have little meaning to most readers. And there generally is already a stats section in the body of most of these players anyways. —Bagumba (talk)\n\nI agree. It's ridiculous that some quarterbacks like Matt Ryan and Tom Brady have rushing stats included when it's inevitable that some rushing yards are racked up over a long career. I'd support standards that help to dictate which stats should and shouldn't be included in the infobox. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nJust wondering, if we removed these parameters for some players due to our own beliefs ... who do we ask, who do we answer to?\n\nSeems like when some users believe to follow a certain path, they do what they believe is correct, why shouldn't we?\n\nAt least when a current or new user, or an IP comes along and wants to add it back, we can say .. not applicable.\n\nJust saying. Bringingthewood (talk)\n\nWell we have WP:NFLINFOBOX which could be expanded to included a guide on when it's appropriate to include certain statistics. But this would be after solid definitions are created based on discussions. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nThat sounds like a good idea. I now have that page on my watchlist. The infobox has been changed before, not saying it was for the wrong reason, but sometimes the person who changes it will have to let an editor know what they're doing wrong. It was said to me regarding certain things, so I know it could be a slippery slope with some people. It's all trial and error, I get that. Rockchalk mentioned solid definitions and that will make life easier going forward. Again, like the other topics mentioned on this page, there are good people here that know how to get things done the right way. Bringingthewood (talk)\n\nSee this thread. Frietjes (talk)\n\nA group of NFL players have been nominated for deletion. See the following discussions:\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/Roy Vassau\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/E.

Also, speaking of deletion nominations, you may be interested in this RFC on mass deletions, which is currently in the workshopping phase. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nAs for the nine player AfDs, each appeared in only one game in the 1920s. I started the process by redirecting them. I did this because each of them was a sub-stub, each lacking any SIGCOV whatsoever, most having been in that state for more than a decade. Such sub-stubs violate WP:SPORTBASIC which states: \"Sports biographies must include at least one reference to a source providing significant coverage of the subject, excluding database sources.\" My redirects were to List of players who appeared in only one game in the NFL (1920–1929), a list repository that preserves the information found in the sub-stubs. BeanieFan11 reverted each of the redirects, without adding any SIGCOV, indicating that he believed SPORTBASIC was \"illogical\" and should apparently just be ignored. BeanieFan's mass reverts are under discussion here. Faced with the mass reverts, I nominated nine out of dozens for deletion. It remains my view that redirects are the best option in such cases. Cbl62 (talk)\n\nCan some one create a page for that game? Jumpy542 (talk)\n\nNO IT DOES NOT. Overtime regular season game between two good teams an interesting ending. No notable storylines outside of both having good records. This type of regular season game happens a few times every year. Frank Anchor\n\nI agree with Frank. You're talking about a wikipedia page. A couple of storylines would have helped your case. Bringingthewood (talk)\n\nIndividual regular season games are generally covered in the respective team season page e.g. 2022 Minnesota Vikings season#Week 10: at Buffalo Bills. A dedicated page for a game would needs to meet WP:NEVENT.—Bagumba (talk)\n\nYeah, hard no on that one. As others have said, this was just a random regular season game with an exciting ending, nothing more. Happens all the time in the NFL. And, while we're at it, can we finally go ahead and delete this article about another random regular season game with an exciting ending between two non-conference opponents that had no significant long-term effect on either team, much less the entire league as a whole? Ejgreen77 (talk)\n\nThe full well-sourced article you'd like to delete is about a famous play, Hail Murray, which won the Play of the Year Award. Editors took the time to write and source it, it is known within the lore of the teams involved, and seems fine. Maybe just let it be, especially as a \"finally go ahead and delete this article\" afterthought and additional question to this ongoing discussion section. Randy Kryn (talk)\n\nI'd support its deletion. Rodgers has the most notably Hail Mary in recent memory and that doesn't have its own article. There's a play of the year every year, but they don't all need their own articles. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nI must say, I watched the game live, and that ending may have been the craziest I've ever seen (one of the most insane catches ever on 4th & 18 + failed 4th and inches at the goal line + when the game's just about over, a fumbled snap on a kneel results in a touchdown + the fumbling team drives down and ties it upwith no time left, thanks to some missed calls by the officials + game-winning INT in overtime). I have no opinion on whether it deserves its own article. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nOppose: While it was a good game, it does not need it's own page. Regular season games, unless causing extreme wide spread controversy or leading to rule changes, don't need their own page. You're always welcome to create a page yourself if you feel strongly, but be prepared for it to potentially go to AfD. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nAdd it if it wins Play of the Year, especially if it develops a common name. I'd suggest that all Play of the Year awardees could have a page if well sourced, or, at a bare minimum, if the Play of the Year has developed a common name. There are five named PotY's now, only one without an article. Randy Kryn (talk)\n\nEven as a Vikings fan, I'm not in favour of this. The game is covered in sufficient detail at 2022 Minnesota Vikings season, and a similar level of detail could be added at the equivalent Bills page. What more would need adding? – PeeJay\n\nOppose Good game, but not deserving of a page.--Rockchalk717\n\nThe list of combined regular season and playoffs records was removed from the yards and touchdowns articles because they \"constituted original research\". Yet the project is fine with listing a number of records that don't exist anywhere outside of bare URL Stathead queries on Pro Football Reference. Just check any suspiciously specific List of National Football League records (individual) record and chances are it will be sourced from a Stathead query.\n\nWhy does this project care about obscure original research records such as \"most games with at least 75% pass completion rate and no interceptions, career (minimum 20 attempts per game)\", but not ones that have actually gotten media attention? What is the rule to distinguish legitimate records that only exist in Stathead vs illegitimate records that only exist in Stathead? Somarain (talk)\n\nYou're looking at two separate issues as the same one. Fact of the matter is, aside from Tom Brady, regular season and playoff statistics are never combined. THAT was the issue, not whether some records are obscure or not. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nSo they're combined infinitely more than \"games with at least 75% pass completion rate and no interceptions, career (minimum 20 attempts per game)\" by people who don't edit this wiki. So why is one okay and the other isn't? Somarain (talk)\n\nI agree that plenty of records on the NFL records page could be taken out, including the ones you mentioned. However, there's a limited number of people in this project, and it's quite a big job to tidy that page up. I don't think anyone's endorsing its current state, it's just that no-one's got around to working on it yet. Harper J. Cole (talk)\n\nI've been trying to remove some of the random off the wall records getting added to pages but there's still a lot of pages with these on them.--Rockchalk717\n\nThe fact that WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS doesn't necessarily mean that it should.—Bagumba (talk)\n\nHello. I was wondering if anyone would like to help write bios for the redlinks at Bill Nunn Award. This is a Professional Football Writers of America award. There's currently 14 redlinks there. Thanks :) MrLinkinPark333 (talk)\n\nWhen exactly was Jamal Fountaine born, in 1971? January 26 or 29. GoodDay (talk)\n\n@GoodDay I amended the infobox to read the 29th. It looks like it may have been a typo. My reference was PFR and ESPN. Bringingthewood (talk)\n\nRecently, User:PeeJay has unilaterally implemented new tables for each team's drafts that include every pick the team had including those traded away, claiming them to be \"more informative\" though the purpose of Wikipedia is not to be an infodump for every single piece of potentially informative info. In my opinion, adding in every traded pick into the table distracts from the meaning of these tables, which are to illustrate who was selected and when. The extra information PeeJay claims is being added is already included in the list of trades underneath the table. Before PeeJay and I start an edit war (and from past edits, I know both of us have tendencies to be stubborn), I would like to gather the consensus of the group. As an illustration, I have included the original version and the updated version of the Baltimore Ravens' table from this season (collapsed below so as to not take over this page).\n\nI believe the original version should be kept as they are informative, concise, and not loaded with trivia. For example, is it really necessary to display that the Ravens acquired the Texans' 7th round pick via the Patriots only to trade it to the Dolphins? I think not. Frank Anchor\n\nI mean, you say “unilaterally”, but the style I implemented was already in use for a few teams, it was just inconsistently applied. Honestly, I think it makes for a level of completeness, since those teams did hold those picks at some point, and the fact that they traded them is encyclopaedically relevant. The trades should be mentioned, and doing it in prose is not as easy for a reader to process as if we put them in the table. – PeeJay\n\nWhat PeeJay included is usually listed in the notes under the draft tables from what I've seen. Instead of reading the notes, which do (typically) expand in detail about what the picks were traded for, readers can look at the table to see that x team didn't have an x round pick because it was traded (or forfeited in some cases). I think it makes the information more easily digestible.\n\nDo we have any documentation or past discussions about this topic by any chance? Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nNothing I’m aware of outside of edit summaries Frank Anchor\n\nNote There are templates, Template:NFL team draft start, and Template:NFL team draft entry that should be in use. Either they (the templates) need to be universally adopted or deleted altogether.-UCO2009bluejay (talk)\n\nI think it's being used plenty. No need to jump to deleting it. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nIf we come up with a consensus that the table format is better, though, we should start migrating all the templates to tables. Even if we can't find trade info for historical drafts, a table might be a better idea anyway. – PeeJay\n\nFor starters, PeeJay needs to leave the proposed version out of articles that didn't already have it in while this is being discussed. Mass changes should not be made without a consensus, included at the Chiefs article. Second, the original version is fine. Adding traded picks doesn't make any sense, not to mention it makes it look (in my opinion) gaudy and excessive. We have the notes for that exact reason. If we add anything, it's utilizing the notes for compensatory picks and picks acquired via trade. Additionally PeeJay, there seems to be more than just me and one other person wanting keep the original version.--Rockchalk717\n\nOut of the 32 teams, only the Chiefs and Browns seem to have any issue with it. Everyone who maintains the other 30 teams seems to be pretty happy with the changes. – PeeJay\n\nFirst of all, I maintain more than just the Browns page (though as a Columbus OH resident and Browns fan that is my primary focus of NFL pages). I only changed one because I expected PeeJay to step in and defend his work, and no need for everyone involved to go through the work of changing many pages before starting a discussion. Second, not immediately reverting edits does not imply being “happy” with them. Frank Anchor\n\nSilence may be the weakest form of consensus, but it is a form of consensus. Anyway, if you're looking for a defence of my changes, let's take the Browns' article as an example: before my changes, it was not immediately obvious why the Browns didn't have any picks in the first or second rounds of the draft. Yes, readers could look at the notes to find out what happened to those picks, but they would essentially have to read all of the notes to make sure they had all the information regarding that pick. With my changes, readers can see that the Browns traded their first two picks to the Texans. In fact, with my changes in effect, readers can see that the Browns traded away six of their seven original picks. I will concede that we could use the footnotes system to link readers to the relevant notes for each trade (c.f. 2022 Minnesota Vikings season), but otherwise I see no negatives to my changes. – PeeJay\n\nThe new tables are terrible and are horribly distracting when I want to just look at the draft class 140.162.13.31 (talk)\n\nAs has been pointed out, a team's draft consists not just of how they use their picks on players but also how they trade picks to get better value. I'm sorry you don't like it, but we've done our best to make it as visually obvious as possible which picks were used on players and which were traded. – PeeJay\n\nI get that but we get all the trades in another section. I think most visitors are just trying to see the draft class and this misses the mark on showing the draft class effectively. I only check wiki when I want to check a draft class but now I'll stop if it will look like this. This isnt what people expect when they want to see a teams draft class for a given year.\n\nIts like, for free agency should we show everyone they had in for a workout? No, we just show the players the team signs. For staff changes should we show every coach they interview? No, we just show the ones they hire.\n\nSame thing for the draft, it should just show the players the team drafts.\n\nRight? 149.8.13.178 (talk)\n\nAlso this doesnt scale well because teams trade players for picks and these tables dont show the players used to generate those picks (the footnotes do).\n\nIt makes no sense and is such a terrible way to display the draft class.\n\nI'm gonna stop donating until its changed back. 2600:4040:252F:4900:E04E:F92E:E9BE:FC94 (talk)\n\n(reset indent)\n\nExcept the main thing the readers want to see is the list of the PLAYERS taken in the draft, not to see how many picks a team acquired or traded away. The table being cluttered by details of picks a team didn’t use, in some cases picks that a team possesses for a matter of hours, distracts from its main purpose. Again, this is sufficiently covered in the footnotes, which is appropriate for something that is not the main topic of the section. Frank Anchor\n\nThat's a good perspective I hadn't considered. I was looking at it as a recap of the draft itself, not as a recap of the players taken. Hey man im josh (talk)\n\nA team's involvement in the draft includes more than just the players taken. A sign of a good draft for some analysts is not which players a team took, but the value they got out of the picks they had and the picks they traded, as well as how they used them. Besides, it's pretty easy to look at the table and see which lines are picks and which are trades. The info is all easy visible and shouldn't be shied away from. – PeeJay\n\nFor starters, I don't make all that many edits to the Chiefs season pages. When I do, it's usually adding transactions after I've ensured the roster template is updated with the transaction. Most of my Chiefs related edits are to the roster template and player articles. Also, the trades are listed in the notes for that exact reason. Some teams make a multitude of trades. The Chiefs had at some point held 19 different draft selections, between their standard 7 picks, compensatory picks, and picks traded and acquired in a trade. The Chiefs are an example of why traded picks shouldn't be specifically listed in the draft table. Some teams make multiple trades (Patriots for example), while some are usually pretty silent on trades (Bengals come to mine). The purpose of the draft table (we mentioned by Frank Anchor) is show the players drafted. And no, silence isn't a form of consensus, not sure where the heck that is coming from. Most editors on Wikipedia don't care to engage in these discussions (on any project) but it doesn't mean they agree with specific decisions. There's some editors on this project that edit pages attached the project but rarely (if ever) participate in these discussions.--Rockchalk717\n\nThe page @Frank Anchor linked to above (WP:WEAKSILENCE) says the exact opposite of what you just asserted. Silence may be weakest form of consensus, but it is still a form of consensus. Anyway, to address your relevant point, I understand why we have the notes, but my point is that just having the notes is not as helpful as listing the traded picks in the table. With footnotes implemented, readers can immediately see which notes apply to which picks, as well as seeing which picks were held and then traded away. – PeeJay\n\nWP:WEAKSILENCE also states that \"a lack of response does not necessarily imply that no one is interested in the topic, and could have any one of several different implications, some of which are contradictory.\" Nonetheless, the fact that the changes PeeJay made to the tables were not immediately reverted would be superseded if there is not a consensus to make these changes in the appropriate forum (i.e. this discussion). Frank Anchor\n\nInstead of talking about Wikipedia technicalities, why don't you address my actual points about how my changes benefit these pages? At the minute, all I can see from you is an argument that it clutters up the table, which it blatantly doesn't, and that the info is already there in note form, which I have addressed as being insufficient when we have the option to include it in a more user-friendly way in the table as well. In the absence of an actual argument, your obstinence boils down to WP:IDONTLIKEIT. – PeeJay\n\nFunny how you're considering my legitimate concerns to fall under WP:IDONTLIKEIT, when your arguments for making this change are largely based on WP:ILIKEIT and WP:ITSUSEFUL. Adding in selections that were traded to and from each team certainly do clutter the table and make it much larger (as has been referred to as \"gaudy\" by another user) than it needs to be for its intended purpose (to list players selected by the team) with content in the \"notes\" column (e.g. \"compensatory selection\" or \"from Arizona\") supplemented by footnotes in prose to explain why a team may have multiple selections or no selections in a particular round. Per WP:MOSTABLE, information that can be stated in prose \"is preferred in articles as prose allows the presentation of detail and clarification of context, in a way that a table may not.\" and there is certainly no reason to include supplimental information both in the table and in the notes section underneath it. That just makes a long article that much longer. Frank Anchor\n\nIn what way are your concerns \"legitimate\"? You've failed to address my point that a team's performance in the draft is not just determined by the players they select, it's about how they maximise the value in the picks they have. Besides, footnotes do not really constitute prose. If you want a prose account of a draft, check out 2021 Minnesota Vikings season#Draft. The prose is supplemented by the table, which lets users see at-a-glance how each pick was used, with notes below to show which picks were involved in the same trades. If you ask me, that 2021 Vikings article presents the team's draft in about as perfect as way as it's possible to do so. You can call the table gaudy if you like, but it's difficult to see how you can come to that conclusion re: a standard wikitable. – PeeJay\n\nAnd WP:ITSUSEFUL? Don't make me laugh. I've substantiated my claims about how it's useful, so for you to suggest that I've fallen foul of WP:ITSUSEFUL is reductive and a textbook case of strawmanning. – PeeJay\n\nAnd I have also substantiated my claims of why they are unnecessary, so your suggestion that my arguments are based on WP:IDONTLIKEIT is absurd and baseless. Frank Anchor\n\nI will further add that in my efforts to convert a couple of the articles to use footnotes, not all of the trades were even covered by the notes. You're claiming that the notes are enough, but they're not even comprehensive. – PeeJay\n\nThe footnotes ARE enough when they are present. If footnotes are not present, they can be added. Thank you for doing that where you have. Frank Anchor\n\nThe footnotes are insufficient when the table could be showing the team's entire involvement in the draft. As I have explained, a team's involvement is not just limited to the players they pick. Would you care to refute that (at some point in the next century)? – PeeJay\n\nI never said a team's involvement in the draft was limited to the players selected. What I said (or at least implied) was that the behind-the-scenes trading of picks is secondary to the players being selected. The casual reader is not interested in seeing all of the picks a team acquired or traded away over the course of the years leading up to the draft, or in many cases, the days of the draft. A casual reader only cares about the players selected. The footnotes (along with trade descriptions at the NFL Draft page itself) are available for the minority of readers who are interested in the in-depth maneuverings of the front offices before and during the draft but including all of these picks in the tables is distracting from their primary point. Frank Anchor\n\nOkay, I disagree. It's not difficult to see which picks in the table were used on players and which were traded away. If a casual reader can't discern the difference, perhaps they would be better suited to the Simple English Wikipedia... – PeeJay\n\nThough a casual reader should not have to discern between the primary topic of the table and a topic of much lesser importance. Frank Anchor\n\nYou make it sound like it’s an absolute chore to discern a selected player from a traded pick, when it’s hardly difficult at all. It’s literally possible to tell the difference at a glance. And again, you’re baselessly asserting that the players selected are the primary concern of the table. – PeeJay\n\nI agree with this.
