        "text": "We are now nearly a week away from the induction of the Pro Football Hall of Fame class of 2021, and representing the Silver and Black will be Raiders legend Charles Woodson.\n\nWoodsonâ€™s induction was announced in February. On Aug. 8, that dream will come true.\n\nHe was one of many Raiders to win the Heisman Trophy but was known as the first primarily defensive player to win the award. Woodson did this with the University of Michigan, where he helped lead the Wolverines to a National Championship.\n\nThe 18-season cornerback was a five-time Pro Bowler while in Oakland. In his first season in the league, Woodson won the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year award.\n\nHe went on to achieve great success with the Green Bay Packers in 2006, being awarded the 2009 Defensive Player of the Year honors and winning a Super Bowl in 2011.\n\nIt was only right that in 2013, Woodson returned to Oakland, where he would ultimately go on to retire. He recorded a career-high four fumble recoveries in his final season.\n\nWoodson leads the Raiders franchise in career forced fumbles. He will enter the Hall as just the 12th Raider to be selected as a first-ballot Hall of Famer.\n\nHe joins NFL legends Alan Faneca, Calvin Johnson, Peyton Manning, John Lynch, Tom Flores, Bill Nunn, and Drew Pearson in the 2021 class.\n\nThe enshrinement will take place on Aug. 8 from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. at the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium.\n\nTell us what you think when you make sure you like our Facebook Page WHEN YOU CLICK RIGHT HERE."
