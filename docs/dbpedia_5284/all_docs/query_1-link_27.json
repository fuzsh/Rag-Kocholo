        "text": "He will probably play RT, and they can move Jones to LT.\n\nI legitimately wonder if they selected him on his name alone. J/k - probably.\n\nPlayed right tackle. Protected Penix's blind side. Penix is left handed.\n\nI did not see the Steelers taking a Guard in the 1st round.\n\nDan Moore lives to fight another Day.\n\nWe know you're upset they didn't take a CB.\n\nWhy didnt the Steelers trade up with Bengals?! Wouldâ€™ve preferred Mims\n\nOooh... I don't like it. I think Fautanu is made for guard, which is the one OL position we're good with currently.\n\nBut he's got great athleticism and is tenacious. So I'll hope for that to shine through in spades.\n\nThen keep Jones at right.\n\nOne thing. Let's not talk about the best players available again. We took what was left at T, and there was many many BPA at other positions, and no not just CB.\n\nThe shots I've seen he was Left.\n\nI get what you're saying about the playstyle, but everything is mirrored when you move to the right.\n\nStill have 4 or 5 teams that need o-line help, but outside of Barton the value may not be there this round. Guyton. probably.\n\nYou are old! So am I! Enjoy it my friend!\n\nHe was primarily a tackle in college. Some projections have him settling in a guard, but I would be very surprised if he isn't a tackle for the Steelers."
