Cuts off at end of Side B).\n\nSpeakers in order: Catherine Campbell, Dorsey Nunn, Jean Stewart, Karen reading Charisse’s letter, Joyce Miller, Luz Alvaraz Martinez, Miriam reading Marsha Bunney’s letter, Cory Weinstein, La Juana (recently released), Andrea Shorter, Rachel Maddow reading solidarity letter, Rebecca Hensler, George Mancuso (father of incarcerated woman), Azania [?] of the National People’s Campaign, and Jennifer Beach speaking about Mumia Abu-Jamal.”;}}\n\nJudy Greenspan’s activism concentrated on the rights of incarcerated persons with HIV/AIDS in California. In 1991, Judy moved to California, joining (the original) San Francisco ACT UP. She later founded the HIV/AIDS in Prison Project of Catholic Charities of the East Bay, an advocacy group working on behalf of women with HIV and AIDS. The group was critically important in improving medical care in the prison system and was instrumental in making the Vacaville medical prison a model for HIV health care. The group also worked to improve procedures for the compassionate release of those incarcerated and dying of HIV/AIDS.\n\nIn 1998, her project closed due to lack of funding, but was absorbed by California Prison Focus, a statewide rights organization for those incarcerated. Undaunted by the end of one program, Judy continued her advocacy and organized the HIV/Hepatitis C in Prison (HIP) Committee within California Prison Focus.\n\nJudy’s last visit to incarcerated women (August 2005) ended with a phone call from her doctor informing her that she had breast cancer. Her diagnosis and her first year teaching elementary school forced her to pull back from her advocacy.\n\nGreenspan retired from teaching as of 2019 and continues to reside in the Bay Area."
