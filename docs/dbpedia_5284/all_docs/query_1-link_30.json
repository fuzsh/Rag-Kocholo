        "text": "50 Over 50\n\nWelcome to our online exhibit featuring 50 Texas musicians that are over 50 years old (however as of now there are more than 50 individuals listed below, and many of them are wayyyy over 50 years old, or have passed on bless their soul). Nevertheless, we hope that you enjoy these intimate snapshots into some amazing human beings that should be cherished and celebrated for as long as we have them!\n\nAs you work down the list (alphabetical), listen to each interview, read the bios, explore their websites, and review their discographies!\n\nLastly, and most importantly, try to take a moment to do something to let them know that they are special, whether it is attending one of their shows (and tipping), sending them a note through social media or reaching out in person to let them know how special they are to you! Enjoy…\n\nThese are the questions asked of each artist in the audio interviews below:\n\nStandard Questions:\n\nQ1: Please state your name, date of birth and names of your parents.\n\nQ2: Where were you born?\n\nQ3: Describe the place — urban neighborhood, small town, rural community, suburb — where you grew up. What was it like? How has it changed over the years? What brought about these changes? What did people do for a living? What brought you to the Austin area and when did you get here?\n\nQ4: When did you first become interested in music? What got you interested? What instrument did you first learn to play? Did you take formal lessons? Who taught you? When? What was the learning process like? What is the most challenging or difficult aspect of the tradition to learn? Why?\n\nQ5: When did you get your own instrument? How did you obtain it? Ultimately did you learn to play other instruments? What do you primarily play when performing? What is your primary style of music?\n\nQ6: What are the key characteristics of the tradition of performing your style of music? What is its history? Do you know how and where the style of music you perform originated? How has it traditionally been practiced? How has it changed or developed over time?\n\nQ7: Please talk about the different styles or variations of the music you perform. What are they? What bands/musicians in the past have influenced your music?\n\nQ8: What bands have you performed with or formed yourself? Which of those had a lasting impression upon you?

Why did you choose to come to Austin to play music?\n\nQ2: Is your musical style a product of Austin influences? (other Austin musicians or Austin environment/lifestyle)\n\nQ3: Would you be the same musician or play the same music if you didn't live in Austin?\n\nQ4: Which venues did you play/do you play? What was/is good or bad about those venues?\n\nQ5: How did being a part of the musical community in Austin help or hurt your musical career?\n\nQ6: Please tell a couple of short stories/anecdotes about performing in Austin.\n\nsnapshot bio:\n\nSome people call it Swamp Pop, others call it Gulf Coast Soul. Larry Lange calls it “A Particular Slice of Americana – The San Antonio, Texas – Lafayette, Louisiana Axis. Extremely danceable late 50’s early 60’s regional hits shared between the musicians along US Highway 90, East and West.” Larry Lange, an exceptional bass player who has backed the likes of Texas favorites Doug Sahm, Paul Ray & the Cobras, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Angela Strehli, Lou Ann Barton and countless others, spent the 80’s with Delbert McClinton sharing the stage with Willie Nelson, Jesse Guitar Taylor, Billy Joe Shaver, Flaco Jimenez and Jr. Medlow.\n\nDeciding to step forward to go back, Lange makes his debut as the front man with The Lonely Knights, and he’s clearly having a blast in the spotlight at last. He has assembled a critically acclaimed band with the soulfully braying saxes of Ed Vizard and Brad Andrew, guitarist Grady Pinkerton laying down a solid groove and rounded out by the outstanding drummer Michael Christian and piano thumper Jack Paine.\n\n“This is simply the best new band in Austin – well, it’s hard to say “new” since these guys have been around for many years – but, they are the Best!”\n\n– Clifford Antone\n\n“Relationship losing it’s zing? Take your sweetie to see Larry Lange and the Lonely Knights and you can cancel that appointment with the marriage counselor.”\n\n– Michael Corcoran, Austin American Statesman\n\nSource: Larry’s Booking Agency"
