        "text": "Spider-Man in film dates back to 1977, with the rights to the character held by Marvel Entertainment until 1999, when Sony bought them for $7 million.[1] Spider-Man has been Marvel's most successful character in the film industry ever since. After selling the Spider-Man motion picture rights to Sony, Marvel eventually founded its own film studio, developing the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) based on the characters it still held the rights to. This changed in 2016, when Sony and Disney[2] entered an agreement to incorporate Spider-Man into the MCU. Despite some disagreements pertaining to finances and merchandising between the two parties, the agreement proved to be a successful endeavor for both companies. Meanwhile, Sony in association with Marvel[3] launched the Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU), with Sony entering into a three-billion-dollar streaming agreement with Netflix and Disney.[4]\n\nHistory\n\nedit\n\nThe fictional character Spider-Man, a comic book superhero created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko and featured in Marvel Comics publications, has appeared as a main character in numerous theatrical and made-for-television films.\n\nThe first four films were linked to television series and screened in theaters only in certain countries. Nicholas Hammond starred as Peter Parker / Spider-Man in the 1977 made-for-television film Spider-Man that spawned a broadcast series, and would appear as the character in two sequels edited from those episodes. In 1978, the Toei Company created a theatrical spin-off of their Spider-Man television series, with Shinji Todō reprising his role as Takuya Yamashiro / Spider-Man. None of these films had a theatrical release in the United States.\n\nBy 1999, Sony Pictures Entertainment had acquired the motion picture rights to the character for cinema and TV,[5] creating two Spider-Man animated TV series, and two film series comprising their own continuities: the Sam Raimi Spider-Man trilogy of films (2002–2007) starring Tobey Maguire as the character, and the Marc Webb Amazing Spider-Man films (2012–2014) starring Andrew Garfield in the role.\n\nIn February 2015, Disney, Marvel Studios, and Sony made a deal to share the Spider-Man film rights, leading to a new iteration of Spider-Man being introduced and integrated into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The deal allowed Sony Pictures to continue to own, finance, distribute, and have final creative control of the solo Spider-Man films, with Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures distributing the films with his other appearances in a supporting capacity. Tom Holland portrays this version of Spider-Man, and has appeared in six films to date, from Captain America: Civil War (2016) to Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021). In September 2019, following a brief stand-off resulting in the termination of the old agreement, Disney and Sony relented to fan outcry and reached a new agreement for Holland's version to return for future films; the first film to be produced afterwards was No Way Home, where Holland appears alongside Maguire and Garfield, who reprise their roles in the film as supporting characters. A fourth MCU Spider-Man film is in development at Sony and Disney.\n\nPlans for an animated Spider-Man film were officially announced by Sony in April 2015, which eventually became Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) from Sony Pictures Animation. Shameik Moore voices Miles Morales / Spider-Man in the film, along with various other versions of Peter Parker and alternate versions of Spider-Man from the multiverse also appearing. A sequel, titled Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, was released in 2023, with a third film, titled Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse, currently in production. Potential spin-offs are also planned.\n\nThe Spider-Man films have been generally well received. They have collectively grossed $10.2 billion at the global box office, with Far From Home becoming the first Spider-Man film to gross over $1 billion worldwide followed by No Way Home, which became Sony's highest-grossing film of all time.[6] In 2019, Into the Spider-Verse won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Fifteen years prior, the Academy had awarded Spider-Man 2 the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.\n\nEarly films\n\nedit\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man series\n\nedit\n\nFilm Release date Director Screenwriter Producer(s) Spider-Man September 14, 1977 ( ) E.

It was directed by E. W. Swackhamer, written by Alvin Boretz and stars Nicholas Hammond as the titular character, David White as J. Jonah Jameson and Jeff Donnell as May Parker. The film premiered on CBS on September 14, 1977, and received a VHS release in 1980.\n\nSpider-Man Strikes Back (1978)\n\nedit\n\nMain article: Spider-Man Strikes Back\n\nIn 1978, the two-part episode \"Deadly Dust\" from the television series The Amazing Spider-Man was re-edited and released outside of the United States as a feature film, Spider-Man Strikes Back. Nicholas Hammond reprises his role as Peter Parker / Spider-Man while Robert F. Simon replaces David White in the role of J. Jonah Jameson. The film was theatrically released on 8 May 1978.\n\nSpider-Man: The Dragon's Challenge (1981)\n\nedit\n\nMain article: Spider-Man: The Dragon's Challenge\n\nIn 1981, a film made from The Amazing Spider-Man television series finale \"The Chinese Web\", using the same method used to make Spider-Man Strikes Back, was released as Spider-Man: The Dragon's Challenge in European territories. Nicholas Hammond and Robert F. Simon respectively reprise their roles as Peter Parker / Spider-Man and J. Jonah Jameson. It was directed by Ron Satlof and written by Robert Janes. Other actors include Rosalind Chao, Benson Fong, and Ellen Bry.\n\nJapanese film\n\nedit\n\nFilm Release date Director Screenwriter Story by Producer Spider-Man July 22, 1978 ( ) Kōichi Takemoto Susumu Takaku Saburo Yatsude Susumu Yoshikawa\n\nIn 1978, Tōei released a theatrical spin-off of their Spider-Man TV series at the Tōei Cartoon Festival. The film was directed by Kōichi Takemoto, who also directed eight episodes of the TV series. The week after the film's release, a character introduced in the film, Jūzō Mamiya (played by Noboru Nakaya), began appearing in episodes of the TV series. The film was released on July 22, 1978. Like the rest of the series, the film was made available for streaming on Marvel's official website in 2009.\n\nDevelopment\n\nedit\n\nCannon Films\n\nedit\n\nThe low box office performance of 1983's Superman III made feature-film adaptations of comic book properties a low priority in Hollywood until the late 1990s.[8] In 1985, after a brief option on Spider-Man by Roger Corman expired,[9] Marvel Comics optioned the property to Cannon Films. Cannon chiefs Menahem Golan and his cousin Yoram Globus agreed to pay Marvel Comics $225,000 over the five-year option period, plus a percentage of any film's revenues.[10] However, the rights would revert to Marvel if a film was not made by April 1990.[11]\n\nTobe Hooper, then preparing both Invaders from Mars and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, was mooted as director. Golan and Globus misunderstood the concept of the character (\"They thought it was like The Wolf Man\", said director Joseph Zito)[12] and instructed writer Leslie Stevens, creator of The Outer Limits, to write a treatment reflecting their misconception. In Stevens' story, a corporate scientist intentionally subjects ID-badge photographer Peter Parker to radioactive bombardment, transforming him into a hairy, suicidal, eight-armed monster. This human tarantula refuses to join the scientist's new master-race of mutants, battling a succession of mutations kept in a basement laboratory.[12][13]\n\nUnhappy with this perceived debasement of his comic book creation, Marvel's Stan Lee pushed for a new story and screenplay, written for Cannon by Ted Newsom and John Brancato.[14] The variation on the origin story had Otto Octavius as a teacher and mentor to a college-aged Peter Parker. The cyclotron accident which \"creates\" Spider-Man also deforms the scientist into Doctor Octopus and results in his mad pursuit of proof of the Fifth Force. \"Doc Ock\" reconstructs his cyclotron and causes electromagnetic abnormalities, anti-gravity effects, and bilocation which threatens to engulf New York City and the world. Joseph Zito, who had directed Cannon's successful Chuck Norris film Invasion U.S.A., replaced Tobe Hooper.[15] The new director hired Barney Cohen to rewrite the script. Cohen added action scenes, a non-canonical comic-book sidekick for the villain, gave Doc Ock the catch phrase, \"Okey-dokey\", and altered his goal from the Fifth Force to a quest for anti-gravity. Producer Golan (using his pen name \"Joseph Goldman\") then made a minor polish to Cohen's rewrite. Zito scouted locations and studio facilities in both the U.S. and Europe, and oversaw storyboard breakdowns supervised by Harper Goff. Cannon planned to make the film on the then-substantial budget of between $15 and $20 million.[10]\n\nWhile no casting was finalized, Zito expressed interest in actor/stunt man Scott Leva, who had posed for Cannon's promotional photos and ads, and made public appearances as Spider-Man for Marvel. The up-and-coming actor Tom Cruise was also discussed for the leading role. Zito considered Bob Hoskins as Doc Ock. Stan Lee expressed his desire to play Daily Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson.[16] Lauren Bacall and Katharine Hepburn were considered for Aunt May, Gregory Peck and Paul Newman as Uncle Ben, Peter Cushing as a sympathetic scientist, and Adolph Caesar as a police detective.[14] With Cannon finances siphoned by the expensive Superman IV: The Quest for Peace and Masters of the Universe, the company slashed the proposed Spider-Man budget to under $10 million. Director Zito opted out, unwilling to make a compromised Spider-Man. The company commissioned low-budget rewrites from writers Shepard Goldman, Don Michael Paul, and finally Ethan Wiley, and penciled in company workhorse Albert Pyun as director, who also made script alterations.[13]\n\nScott Leva was still associated with the character through Marvel (he had appeared in photo covers of the comic), and he read each draft. Leva commented: \"Ted Newsom and John Brancato had written the script. It was good, but it needed a little work. Unfortunately, with every subsequent rewrite by other writers, it went from good to bad to terrible.\"[16] Due to Cannon's assorted financial crises, the project shut down after spending about $1.5 million on the project.[12] In 1989, Pathé, owned by corrupt Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti, acquired the overextended Cannon. The filmmaking cousins parted, Globus remaining associated with Pathé, Golan leaving to run 21st Century Film Corporation, keeping a number of properties (including Spider-Man) in lieu of a cash buy-out. He also extended his Spider-Man option with Marvel up to January 1992.[11]\n\nGolan shelved the low-budget rewrites and attempted to finance an independent production from the original big-budget script, already budgeted, storyboarded and laid out.[17] At Cannes in May 1989, 21st Century announced a September start date, with ads touting the script by \"Barney Cohen, Ted Newsom & John Brancato and Joseph Goldman\".[18] As standard practice, Golan pre-sold the unmade film to raise production funds, with television rights bought by Viacom and home video rights by Columbia Pictures, which wanted to establish a studio franchise. Stephen Herek was attached as director at this point.[19] Golan submitted this \"new\" screenplay to Columbia in late 1989 (actually the 1985 script with an adjusted \"1989\" date) and the studio requested yet another rewrite. Golan hired Frank LaLoggia, who turned in his draft but grew disenchanted with 21st Century. Neil Ruttenberg was hired for one more draft, which was also \"covered\" by script readers at Columbia.[20] Columbia's script analysts considered all three submissions \"essentially the same story\". A tentative production deal was set. Stan Lee said in 1990: \"21st Century [is] supposed to do Spider-Man and now they're talking to Columbia and the way it looks now, Columbia may end up buying Spider-Man from 21st Century.\"[21]\n\nCarolco Pictures / MGM\n\nedit\n\n21st Century's Menahem Golan still actively immersed himself mounting \"his\" Spider-Man, sending the original \"Doc Ock\" script for production bids. In 1990, he contacted Canadian effects company Light and Motion Corporation regarding the visual effects, which in turn offered the stop-motion chores to Steven Archer (Krull, Clash of the Titans).[22]\n\nToward the end of shooting True Lies, Variety carried the announcement that Carolco Pictures had received a completed screenplay from James Cameron.[23] This script bore the names of James Cameron, John Brancato, Ted Newsom, Barry [sic] Cohen and \"Joseph Goldmari\", a typographical scrambling of Golan's pen name (\"Joseph Goldman\") with Marvel executive Joseph Calamari.[24] The script text was identical to the one Golan submitted to Columbia the previous year, with the addition of a new 1993 date. Cameron stalwart Arnold Schwarzenegger was frequently linked to the project as the director's choice for Doctor Octopus.[25][26]\n\nJames Cameron \"scriptment\"\n\nedit\n\nMonths later, James Cameron submitted an undated 57-page \"scriptment\" with an alternate story (the copyright registration was dated 1991), part screenplay, part narrative story outline.[12] The \"scriptment\" told the Spider-Man origin, but used variations on the comic book characters Electro and Sandman as villains. This \"Electro\" (named Carlton Strand, instead of Max Dillon) was a megalomaniacal parody of corrupt capitalists. Instead of Flint Marko's character, Cameron's \"Sandman\" (simply named Boyd) is mutated by an accident involving Philadelphia Experiment-style bilocation and atom-mixing, in lieu of getting caught in a nuclear blast on a beach. The story climaxes with a battle atop the World Trade Center and had Peter Parker revealing his identity to Mary Jane Watson. In addition, the treatment was also heavy on profanity, and had Spider-Man and Mary Jane having sex on the Brooklyn Bridge.[27]\n\nThis treatment reflected elements in previous scripts: from the Stevens treatment, organic web-shooters, and a villain who tempts Spider-Man to join a coming \"master race\" of mutants; from the original screenplay and rewrite, weird electrical storms causing blackouts, freak magnetic events and bi-location; from the Ethan Wiley draft, a villain addicted to toxic super-powers and multiple experimental spiders, one of which escapes and bites Peter, causing a hallucinatory nightmare invoking Franz Kafka's The Metamorphosis; from the Frank LaLoggia script, a blizzard of stolen cash fluttering down onto surprised New Yorkers; and from the Neil Ruttenberg screenplay, a criminal assault on the NYC Stock Exchange.[13] In 1991, Carolco Pictures extended Golan's option agreement with Marvel through May 1996,[11] but in April 1992, Carolco ceased active production on Spider-Man due to continued financial and legal problems.[28] During this time Leonardo DiCaprio was considered for Peter Parker/Spider-Man; Maggie Smith as Aunt May; Robyn Lively as Mary Jane Watson; R. Lee Ermey as J. Jonah Jameson; Michael Biehn as Boyd/Sandman; and Lance Henriksen as Carlton Strand/Electro.[29][30]\n\nLitigation\n\nedit\n\nWhen James Cameron agreed to make Spider-Man, Carolco lawyers simply used his previous Terminator 2 contract as a template. A clause in this agreement gave Cameron the right to decide on movie and advertising credits. Show business trade articles and advertisements made no mention of Golan, who was still actively assembling the elements for the film.[11] In 1993, Golan complained publicly and finally instigated legal action against Carolco for disavowing his contractual guarantee credit as producer. On the other hand, Cameron had the contractual right to decide on credits.[13] Eventually, Carolco sued Viacom and Columbia to recover broadcast and home video rights, and the two studios countersued.[10] 20th Century Fox, though not part of the litigation, contested Cameron's participation, claiming exclusivity on his services as a director under yet another contract.[12] In 1996, Carolco, 21st Century, and Marvel went bankrupt.\n\nVia a quitclaim from Carolco dated March 28, 1995, MGM acquired 21st Century's film library and assets, and received \"...all rights in and to all drafts and versions of the screenplay(s) for Spider-Man written by James Cameron, Ted Newsom & John Brancato, Menahem Golan, Jon [sic] Michael Paul, Ethan Wiley, Leslie Stevens, Frank Laloggia, Neil Ruttenberg, Barney Cohen, Shepard Goldman and any and all other writers.\"[31] MGM also sued 21st Century, Viacom, and Marvel Comics, alleging fraud in the original deal between Cannon and Marvel. In 1998, Marvel emerged from bankruptcy with a reorganization plan that merged the company with Toy Biz.[11] The courts determined that the original contract of Marvel's rights to Golan had expired, returning the rights to Marvel, but the matter was still not completely resolved. In 1999, Marvel licensed Spider-Man rights to Columbia, a subsidiary of Sony Pictures Entertainment.[32] MGM disputed the legality, claiming it had the Spider-Man rights via Cannon, 21st Century, and Carolco.[33]\n\nColumbia Pictures\n\nedit\n\nFurther information: Spider-Man (2002 film) § Development\n\nIn the meantime, MGM/UA chief executive John Calley moved to Columbia Pictures. Intimately familiar with the legal history of producer Kevin McClory's claim to the rights to both Thunderball and other related James Bond characters and elements, Calley announced that Columbia would produce an alternate 007 series, based on the \"McClory material\", which Calley acquired for Columbia.[34] Columbia had made the original 1967 film spoof of Casino Royale, a non-Eon production.\n\nBoth studios now faced rival projects, which could undercut their own long-term financial stability and plans. Columbia had no consistent movie franchise, and had sought Spider-Man since 1989; MGM/UA's only reliable source of theatrical income was a new James Bond film every two or three years. An alternate 007 series could diminish or even eliminate the power of MGM/UA's long-running Bond series. Likewise, an MGM/UA Spider-Man film could negate Columbia's plans to create an exclusive cash cow. Both sides seemed to have strong arguments for the rights to do such films.[35]\n\nThe two studios made a trade-off in March 1999; Columbia relinquished its rights to create a new 007 series in exchange for MGM's giving up its claim to Spider-Man.[36] Columbia acquired the rights to all previous scripts in 2000,[20] but exercised options only on the \"Cameron Material\", i.e., both the completed multi-author screenplay and the subsequent scriptment.[12] Other sources report that Columbia's owner Sony agreed to pay $10 million, plus 5% of any movies' gross revenue and half the revenue from consumer products.[37] After more than a decade of attempts, Spider-Man truly went into production[10] and since then all of the Spider-Man films were distributed by Columbia Pictures, the primary film production holding of Sony. The first three were directed by Sam Raimi, and the reboot and its sequel were directed by Marc Webb. Laura Ziskin served as producer until her death in 2011.[38]\n\nSam Raimi's trilogy\n\nedit\n\nFilm U.S. release date Director Screenwriter(s) Story by Producers Spider-Man May 3, 2002 ( ) Sam Raimi David Koepp Laura Ziskin and Ian Bryce Spider-Man 2 May 7, 2004 ( ) Alvin Sargent Alfred Gough, Miles Millar, and Michael Chabon Laura Ziskin and Avi Arad Spider-Man 3 May 4, 2007 ( ) Sam Raimi, Ivan Raimi, and Alvin Sargent Sam Raimi and Ivan Raimi Laura Ziskin, Avi Arad, and Grant Curtis\n\nSpider-Man (2002)\n\nedit\n\nMain article: Spider-Man (2002 film)\n\nSpider-Man follows Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), an orphaned high schooler who pines after popular girl-next-door Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). While on a science class field trip at Columbia University, a genetically-engineered \"super spider\" bites Peter. As a result, Peter gains superhuman abilities, including increased strength, speed, and the abilities to scale walls and generate organic webbing. After his beloved Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) is murdered, the teenager realizes that he must use his newfound abilities to protect New York City. Meanwhile, wealthy industrialist Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), the father of Peter's best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco), subjects himself to an experimental performance-enhancing serum, which creates a psychotic and murderous split personality. Donning a military battle suit, Norman becomes a freakish \"Green Goblin\", who begins to terrorize the city. Peter, as Spider-Man, now must battle with the Goblin, all while dealing with personal situations involving his domestic and his love life.\n\nSpider-Man 2 (2004)\n\nedit\n\nMain article: Spider-Man 2\n\nTwo years after the events of the first film, Peter struggles to balance his superhero and private lives and still pines after Mary Jane Watson, who is now engaged. Harry Osborn continues to believe Spider-Man is responsible for his father Norman Osborn's death. Spider-Man contends with scientist Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), also known as Doctor Octopus, who initially mentors his alter-ego and has four mechanical tentacles fused to his spine following a failed fusion-based experiment and sets out to recreate the same that could destroy much of New York City.\n\nSpider-Man 3 (2007)\n\nedit\n\nMain article: Spider-Man 3\n\nPeter is still with Mary Jane Watson, while Harry Osborn succeeds his father as the new Green Goblin (credited as New Goblin). Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), who, like Peter, is a photographer for the Daily Bugle, sets out to defame Spider-Man and incriminate him. Meanwhile, Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), an escaped convict, falls into a particle accelerator and becomes a shape-shifting sand monster known as Sandman. Peter later learns that Marko killed Uncle Ben, causing Peter's own dark intentions to grow. This vendetta is enhanced by the appearance of the mysterious black alien symbiotic substance that bonds to Peter, resulting in the formation of a new black costume. Once Peter separates himself from the alien, it finds a new host in the form of Brock, resulting in the creation of Venom and Peter Parker having to battle the villains in the end.\n\nCanceled fourth film and potential revival\n\nedit\n\n\"Spider-Man 4\" redirects here. For the planned sequel to Spider-Man: No Way Home, see Spider-Man: No Way Home § Future.\n\nIn 2007, Spider-Man 4 entered development, with Raimi attached to direct and Maguire, Dunst, and other cast members set to reprise their roles. Both a fourth and a fifth film were planned and at one time the idea of shooting the two sequels concurrently was under consideration. However, Raimi stated in March 2009 that only the fourth film was in development at that time, and that if there were fifth and sixth films, those two films would actually be a continuation of each other.[39][40][41][42] Zodiac screenwriter James Vanderbilt was hired by Sony Pictures in October 2007 to pen the screenplay after initial reports in January that Sony was in contact with David Koepp, who wrote the first Spider-Man film.[43][44] The script was being rewritten by David Lindsay-Abaire and Gary Ross in November 2008 and October 2009.[45] Sony also engaged Vanderbilt to write scripts for Spider-Man 5 and Spider-Man 6.[44]\n\nIn 2007, Raimi expressed interest in depicting the transformation of Dr. Curt Connors into his villainous alter-ego, the Lizard; the character's actor Dylan Baker and producer Grant Curtis were also enthusiastic about the idea.[46][47][48] Raimi also discussed his desire to upgrade Bruce Campbell from a cameo appearance to a significant role,[49] later revealed to be Quentin Beck / Mysterio.[50] It was reported in December 2009 that John Malkovich was in negotiations to play Vulture and that Anne Hathaway would play Felicia Hardy, though she would not have transformed into the Black Cat as in the comics. Instead, Raimi's Felicia was expected to become a new superpowered figure called the Vulturess.[51] Several years later, in 2013, Raimi re-clarified that the Vultress concept was discarded and Hathaway would've indeed been Black Cat if Spider-Man 4 had been made.[52] Concept art by storyboard artist Jeffrey Henderson revealed in June 2016 showed the inclusion of an opening montage of Spider-Man going up against C and D-list villains, such as Mysterio, the Shocker, the Prowler, the Stilt-Man and the Rhino, with the Vulture serving as the main antagonist; Henderson recalls that the film would have opened with a montage of Spider-Man, now feeling free after breaking up with Mary Jane, catching all villains from his rogues gallery that the crew knew Raimi would never use in his films. Henderson also disclosed that Malkovich would have played the Vulture, who would have been a private contractor who committed terrible actions in behalf of the U.S. government, leading him to be called the \"Vulture\" because he never left anything but \"bones\" behind, and the film's climax would have shown the Vulture and Spider-Man fighting in a bloody fight that Spider-Man would have barely won by causing the Vulture's wings to make him tumble between building until crashing into the Citicorp Building's ether and off its top, killing him.[50][53] In April 2022, Raimi stated that he had planned to include Kraven the Hunter in the film.[54]\n\nAs disagreements between Sony and Raimi threatened to push the film off the intended May 6, 2011, release date, Sony Pictures announced in January 2010 that plans for Spider-Man 4 had been canceled due to Raimi's withdrawal from the project. Raimi reportedly ended his participation due to his doubt that he could meet the planned May 6, 2011 release date while at the same time upholding the film creatively; he admitted that he was \"very unhappy\" with the way Spider-Man 3 had turned out, and was under pressure to make the fourth film the best that he could.[55] Raimi purportedly went through four iterations of the script with different screenwriters and still \"hated it\".[56]\n\nIn June 2021, animatic producer David E. Duncan, who worked on Spider-Man 4, uploaded an animatic of the canceled project dated November 12, 2009 to his Vimeo account along with the description: \"One of a half dozen animatics I produced for the ill-fated 4th Raimi Spider-Man. Studio politics, creative differences and bad internet reactions (to John Malkovich as Vulture) caused the plug to be pulled December of 2009, early in the prep stage. However, one month later, Sony moved forward with Andrew Garfield reboot...\", the animatic depicts a battle between Spider-Man and The Vulture.[57] Duncan later deleted the animatic from his page, but it can still be found on YouTube.[58]\n\nFollowing his appearance in No Way Home, some fans called for Sony to make a fourth Tobey Maguire Spider-Man film using the hashtag \"#MakeRaimiSpiderMan4\" on Twitter.[59] In addition, both director Sam Raimi and actress Kirsten Dunst expressed interest in a possible return in a fourth film, while Tobey Maguire stated that he is \"open for anything\".[60] However, Raimi later stated that he had no plans to direct such a film.[61]\n\nMarc Webb's duology\n\nedit\n\nFilm U.S. release date Director Screenwriters Story by Producers The Amazing Spider-Man July 6, 2012 ( ) Marc Webb James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent, and Steve Kloves James Vanderbilt Laura Ziskin, Avi Arad, and Matt Tolmach The Amazing Spider-Man 2 May 2, 2014 ( ) Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, and Jeff Pinkner Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, Jeff Pinkner, and James Vanderbilt Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach\n\nFollowing the cancelation of Spider-Man 4, Sony announced that the franchise would be rebooted with a new director and new cast.

The third film was scheduled to be released on June 10, 2016, and the fourth to be released on May 4, 2018.[62][63] Paul Giamatti confirmed that Rhino would return in the third film.[64] That November, Sony Pictures Entertainment chief Michael Lynton told analysts: \"We do very much have the ambition about creating a bigger universe around Spider-Man. There are a number of scripts in the works.\"[65] Andrew Garfield stated that his contract was for three films, and was unsure of his involvement for the fourth film.[66] In February 2014, Sony announced that Webb would return to direct the third Amazing Spider-Man film.[67] In March, Webb stated that he would not be directing the fourth film, but would like to remain as a consultant for the series.[68] Roberto Orci told IGN in July that he was not working on the third film due to his involvement in Star Trek Beyond.[69] Alex Kurtzman stated in interview that the third film was still continuing production and that there was a possibility of seeing a Black Cat film.[70] Sony Pictures later announced in July that The Amazing Spider-Man 3 had been delayed to 2018.[71] After the announcement in February 2015 of a new series with Marvel Studios, the sequels to The Amazing Spider-Man 2 were canceled.[72] In July 2015, Denis Leary, who had portrayed police Captain George Stacy in the previous two films, revealed that the film at one point had Spider-Man \"take this formula and regenerate the people in his life that died.\"[73]\n\nIn December 2013, Sony issued a press release through the viral site Electro Arrives announcing that two films were in development, with Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci and Ed Solomon writing a spin-off to The Amazing Spider-Man focused on Venom (with Kurtzman attached to direct) and Drew Goddard writing one focused on the villain team Sinister Six. Hannah Minghella and Rachel O'Connor would oversee the development and production of these films for the studio.[74][75] The Venom spinoff eventually became the 2018 film starring the character. In April 2014, it was announced that Goddard would direct the Sinister Six film,[76] and that both spin-offs would be released before a fourth Amazing Spider-Man,[77] with Spider-Man potentially appearing in both spin-offs.[78] Later in the month, Tolmach and Arad revealed the Sinister Six film would be a redemption story,[79] and that the film's lineup might differ from the comics.[80] On July 23, 2014, Sony Pictures announced that The Sinister Six was scheduled for release on November 11, 2016.[71] By August 2014, Sony was also looking to release a female-centered spin-off film in 2017, with Lisa Joy writing, and had given the Venom spin-off the potential title of Venom: Carnage.[81]\n\n\"I mean, yes, definitely open to something if it felt right. Peter and Spider-Man, those characters are all about service, to the greater good and the many. He's a working-class boy from Queens that knows struggle and loss and is deeply empathetic. I would try to borrow Peter Parker's ethical framework in that, if there was an opportunity to step back in and tell more of that story, I would have to feel very sure and certain in myself.\"\n\nAndrew Garfield on returning as Spider-Man[82]\n\nDespite the announcement in February 2015 of a new series with Marvel Studios, the Sinister Six, Venom, and female-led spin-off films set in the Amazing Spider-Man timeline were then \"still moving forward\". Feige was not expected to be creatively involved with these films.[72] However, the Sinister Six film was canceled due to The Amazing Spider-Man 2 underperforming commercially,[83] and by November 2015, the other prospective spin-off films were canceled as well.[84] However, Sony has reworked these plans into creating a new film series based on Marvel characters associated with Spider-Man separate from both the Marvel Cinematic Universe or the Amazing Spider-Man franchise, starting with the release of the 2018 film Venom. These include spinoff films centering around the characters of Morbius,[85] Kraven the Hunter,[86] and Silver and Black,[87] a female-centric team up of the Spider-Man anti-heroes Silver Sable and Black Cat. Jared Leto portrayed the title character Morbius in the spin-off film, directed by Daniel Espinosa and was released on April 1, 2022, to critical and commercial failure.[88] Kraven the Hunter was written by Richard Wenk and the writing team of Art Marcum and Matt Holloway, and has a set release date of December 13, 2024.\n\nFollowing his appearance in No Way Home, some fans called for Sony to make a third Andrew Garfield Spider-Man film using the hashtag \"#MakeTASM3\" on Twitter.[90][91][92] In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Garfield expressed interest in reprising his role as his Peter Parker for another Spider-Man film.

Pascal and Avi Arad had attempted to connect the two franchises prior to these discussions, with the pair revealing that they were intending on licensing out the design of the Oscorp Tower from The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) so it could appear in the New York City skyline of the MCU film The Avengers (2012), establishing the existence of Spider-Man and associated elements in the MCU. It never materialized as a result of the building's design being finalized too late into the latter film's post-production process.[97] Sony also mooted with the idea of doing a crossover film between The Amazing Spider-Man films and the Sam Raimi films with Garfield and Tobey Maguire playing their respective versions of Spider-Man with Raimi reportedly eyed to direct, but this too never came to fruition.[98] In December 2014, following the hacking of Sony Pictures' computers, Sony and Marvel Studios were revealed to have had discussions about licensing Spider-Man to appear in the MCU film Captain America: Civil War (2016) while having control of the film rights remaining with Sony. Talks between the studios then broke down. Instead, Sony had considered having Raimi return to direct a new trilogy.[99]\n\nOn February 9, 2015, Sony Pictures and Disney announced a licensing agreement that would allow Spider-Man to appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with the character appearing in an MCU film and Sony releasing a Spider-Man film co-produced by Feige and Pascal. Sony Pictures would continue to own, finance, distribute, and exercise final creative control over the Spider-Man films.[100] Feige stated that Marvel had been working to add Spider-Man to the MCU since at least October 2014.[101] The next month, Marvel Entertainment CCO Joe Quesada indicated that the Peter Parker version of the character would be used,[102] which Feige confirmed in April.[103] The following June, Feige clarified that the initial Sony deal did not allow the character to appear in any of the MCU television series, as it was \"very specific... with a certain amount of back and forth allowed.\"[104]\n\nTom Holland, who portrays Peter Parker / Spider-Man in the MCU, revealed in November 2016 that he was signed for \"three Spider-Man movies and three solo movies\".[105] In June 2017, Holland, Feige, and Jon Watts, director of the MCU Spider-Man films, confirmed that a child (portrayed by Max Favreau) wearing an Iron Man mask whom Tony Stark saves from a drone in Iron Man 2 (2010), was a young Peter Parker, retroactively making it the introduction of the character to the MCU.[106][107]\n\nIn August 2019, Disney and Sony couldn't reach a new agreement regarding Spider-Man films, with Marvel Studios and Feige said to no longer have any involvement in any future films. Deadline Hollywood noted that Disney had hoped future films would be a \"50/50 co-financing arrangement between the studios\", with the possibility to extend the deal to other Spider-Man-related films, an offer Sony rejected and did not counter. Instead, Sony hoped to keep the terms of the previous agreement, where Marvel would receive 5% of the film's initial theatrical gross, with Disney refusing.[108] The Hollywood Reporter added that the lack of a new agreement would see the end of Holland's Spider-Man in the MCU.[109] Variety cited unnamed sources claiming negotiations had \"hit an impasse\" and that a new deal could still be reached.[110] On August 24, Feige reportedly commented at Disney's D23 Expo: \"We got to make five films within the MCU with Spider-Man: two standalone films and three with the Avengers. It was a dream that I never thought would happen. It was never meant to last forever. We knew there was a finite amount of time that we'd be able to do this, and we told the story we wanted to tell, and I'll always be thankful for that.\"[111]\n\nThe following month, in response to fan outcry, Disney and Sony reached a new deal, which includes a third Spider-Man film as well as one other film, both set in the MCU.[112] At the time, Watts entered final negotiations to return as director.[113] In November 2021, Pascal revealed in an interview that Sony and Marvel Studios are going to continue collaborating for another trilogy of films set in the MCU.[114]\n\nCaptain America: Civil War (2016)\n\nedit\n\nMain article: Captain America: Civil War\n\nReports indicated that the first MCU film that Spider-Man would appear in as part of the deal, would be Captain America: Civil War.[115][116] Directors Joe and Anthony Russo had lobbied for months to include the character in that film.[117] Anthony Russo stated that, despite Marvel telling them to have a \"plan B\" should the deal with Sony fail, the Russos never created one because \"it was very important to us to reintroduce\" Spider-Man in the film, adding, \"We only have envisioned the movie with Spider-Man.\"[118] By the end of May 2015, Asa Butterfield, Tom Holland, Judah Lewis, Matthew Lintz, Charlie Plummer and Charlie Rowe screen tested for the lead role, against Robert Downey Jr., who portrays Tony Stark / Iron Man, for chemistry.[119][120] The six were chosen out of a search of over 1,500 actors to test in front of Feige, Pascal, and the Russo brothers.[119] In June, Feige and Pascal narrowed the actors considered to Holland and Rowe. Both screen tested again with Downey, with Holland also testing with Chris Evans, who portrays Steve Rogers / Captain America, and emerged as the favorite.[120] Holland was ultimately cast as Spider-Man in June.[121] The following month, Marisa Tomei was in talks for the role of May Parker,[122] later appearing in Civil War.[123]\n\nIn the film, Parker, who has spent the last six months as a local costumed crimefighter named Spider-Man, is recruited by Stark to join his team of Avengers to stop Rogers and his rogue faction of Avengers, who oppose the Sokovia Accords, from fleeing with fugitive Bucky Barnes.
