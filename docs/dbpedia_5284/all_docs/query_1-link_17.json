        "text": "American actress (1927–1988)\n\nAlice Elizabeth Nunn (October 10, 1927 – July 1, 1988) was an American film and theatre actress.[1] She was born in Jacksonville, Florida, and died at her apartment in West Hollywood, California.[1] Although she played many roles across her 31-year career, appearing in more than 50 films and TV series,[2] she is primarily remembered for her role as Large Marge,[1][2] the ghost of a storied truck driver, in Tim Burton's 1985 film Pee-wee's Big Adventure, which is number 5 on the IFC list of the 25 scariest moments in non-horror film history,[3] and earned her a cult following.[2]\n\nLife and career\n\n[edit]\n\nNunn was born in Jacksonville in 1927 to N.G. Nunn and Alice Bush. She showed an early interest in the performing arts and took part in a school production of My Sister Eileen.[1] She studied acting at Wesleyan University and took classes with the American Theater Wing.[1] After some radio work, she got an acting part in New Faces of 1956[1] and played in the theatre alongside Shelley Berman and Nancy Walker.[1]\n\nShe became a character actress, and appeared on television's Petticoat Junction in the episodes \"Shoplifter at the Shady Rest\" (1967, as Mrs. Benson); \"Mae's Helping Hand\" (1968); and the 1969 episodes \"The Other Woman\" (as Mrs. Birdwell) and \"Kathy Joe's First Birthday Party\" (as \"Lady with wallet\").[1] She also appeared on Ironside and The Wild Wild West.[2]\n\nShe appeared in numerous sitcoms, such as Camp Runamuck, where she played Mahala May Gruenecker, the head counselor of Camp Divine, and the chief opponent of Commander Wivenhoe (played by series star Arch Johnson).[1] In her sitcom appearances in the 1960s, she often played strong-willed, edgy women, but in a humorous vein.[1]\n\nNunn's first film appearance was in Johnny Got His Gun (1971) where she played a nurse.[1] She was a regular cast member of the Tony Orlando and Dawn variety show; and has small parts in films such as the \"Fat Lady\" in Mame (1974), and in Airport 1975.[1] She appeared as Mrs. Callahan in Brian De Palma's The Fury (1978).[4] She played Duffy the Cook in Alan Beattie's slasher/mystery Delusion (1980) (also known as The House Where Death Lives) with Patricia Pearcy and Joseph Cotten, and the maid Helga in Mommie Dearest (1981).[1]\n\nShe is most widely known for her role as Large Marge, a ghostly truck driver who frightens Pee-wee Herman in the film Pee-wee's Big Adventure (1985), providing what has been called one of the scariest moments in non-horror film history.[1][3] In Trick or Treat (1986), she played Mrs. Sylvia Cavell, and appeared in Who's That Girl (1987) with Madonna. Her last role was that of Nurse Palmer in Three O'Clock High (1987).[1]\n\nNunn died in 1988 at her apartment in West Hollywood, California of a heart attack at age 60.[1][2][5]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm Year Title Role Notes 1971 Johnny Got His Gun Third Nurse The Steagle Mrs. Furst Uncredited 1974 Mame Fat Lady Airport 1975 Passenger with Dog Uncredited Fangs Sis 1978 The Fury Mrs. Callahan The Fifth Floor Emma 1981 Delusion Duffy Mommie Dearest Helga 1983 Focus on Fishko Old Mimi Short 1985 Pee-wee's Big Adventure Large Marge 1986 Thrashin' Truck Driver Uncredited Trick or Treat Mrs. Sylvia Cavell 1987 Who's That Girl Woman Parole Member Three O'Clock High Nurse Palmer\n\nTelevision Year Title Role Notes 1965 Hazel Hildegarde Episode: \"Hazel's Inquisitive Mind\" 1965-1966 Camp Runamuck Mahala May Gruenecker / Mahala May 21 episodes 1967 The Phyllis Diller Show Mrs. Hill Episode: \"Phyllis, the Beauty Queen\" Judd for the Defense Mrs. Merrell Episode: \"A Civil Case of Murder\" 1968 The Wild Wild West Hilda Episode: \"The Night of the Big Blackmail\" 1967-1969 Petticoat Junction Mrs. Benson / Lady With Wallet / Mrs. Birdwell 4 episodes 1970 The Bill Cosby Show Winona Fisk Episode: \"Growing, Growing, Grown\" 1971 Mayberry R.F.D.
