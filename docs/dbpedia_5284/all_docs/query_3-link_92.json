        "text": "Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights in the United States are among the most advanced in the world,[1][2] with public opinion and jurisprudence changing significantly since the late 1980s.[3][4][5]\n\nIn 1962, beginning with Illinois, states began to decriminalize same-sex sexual activity,[6] and in 2003, through Lawrence v. Texas, all remaining laws against same-sex sexual activity were invalidated. In 2004, beginning with Massachusetts, states began to offer same-sex marriage, and in 2015, through Obergefell v. Hodges, all states were required to offer it. In many states and municipalities, LGBT Americans are explicitly protected from discrimination in employment, housing, and access to public accommodations. Many LGBT rights in the United States have been established by the United States Supreme Court, which invalidated state laws banning protected class recognition based upon homosexuality, struck down sodomy laws nationwide, struck down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, made same-sex marriage legal nationwide, and prohibited employment discrimination against gay and transgender employees. LGBT-related anti-discrimination laws regarding housing and private and public services varies by state. Twenty-three states plus Washington, D.C., Guam, and Puerto Rico outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation, and twenty-two states plus Washington, D.C., outlaw discrimination based on gender identity or expression.[7] Family law also varies by state. Adoption of children by same-sex married couples is legal nationwide since Obergefell v. Hodges.[8][9]\n\nHate crimes based on sexual orientation or gender identity are punishable by federal law under the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, but many states lack laws that cover sexual orientation and/or gender identity.[10]\n\nPublic opinion is overwhelmingly supportive of same-sex marriage[3] while mixed on transgender issues. A 2022 Grinnell College National Poll found that 74% of Americans agree that same-sex marriage should be a guaranteed right while 13% disagree.[11][12] According to General Social Survey, support for same-sex marriage among 18-34 year olds is near-universal.[13] By 2024, same-sex marriage has no longer become a topic of substantial public debate.[3] Discussion and political disputes regarding gender identity however continue, particularly regarding bathroom access, athletics, and transgender-related healthcare for minors.[14][15][16]\n\nPublic opinion\n\n[edit]\n\nPublic opinion of same-sex marriage in the United States has changed dramatically since the late 1980s;[4] by the early 2020s, an overwhelming majority of Americans approved of the legality of these marriages.[4] A December 2022 Quinnipiac University poll found that 68 percent of Americans supported legal recognition of same-sex marriage and 22 percent opposed it.[17] Approval of same-sex marriage is even higher in younger generations;[18] among 18-34 year olds, according to the General Social Survey, support is near-universal.[13] A 2021 Public Religion Research Institute poll of the states found majority support for same-sex marriage in 47 states, ranging from 50% in South Carolina to 85% in Massachusetts. There is plurality support for legal recognition of same-sex marriage in Alabama, where 49% support and 47% oppose. Only Mississippi and Arkansas have majority opposition to same-sex marriage; in Mississippi, 55% oppose and 44% support, while in Arkansas, 52% oppose and 47% support same-sex marriage.[19]\n\nFrom 1988 to 2009, support for recognized same-sex marriage increased between 1% and 1.5% per year,[20] and accelerated thereafter, rising above 50% in Pew Research Center polling for the first time in 2011.[21] According to Garretson (2018): \"The transformation of America's response to homosexuality has been — and continues to be — one of the most rapid and sustained shifts in mass attitudes since the start of public polling.\"[4]\n\nA November 2012 Gallup poll indicated 61% support for gay and lesbian individuals being allowed to adopt children.[22]\n\nLegality of same-sex sexual activity\n\n[edit]\n\nOn June 26, 2003, the Supreme Court ruled in Lawrence v. Texas that intimate consensual sexual conduct is part of the liberty protected by substantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. The majority opinion, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, explicitly overruled Bowers v. Hardwick, a 1986 decision that found sodomy laws to be constitutional.[23] Despite this ruling, some states have not repealed their sodomy laws[24] and local law enforcement officers have used these statutes to harass or arrest gay people.[25][26][27] After the repeal of \"Don't Ask Don't Tell\" in 2011, the U.S. Congress repealed sodomy laws in the U.S. military in 2014.\n\nPrior to the 2003 Supreme Court ruling in Lawrence v. Texas, same-sex sexual activity was illegal in fourteen U.S. states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. military. By that time, twenty-nine states, the District of Columbia, and five territories had repealed their state's sodomy laws by legislative action.[28][29] Twelve states have had state Supreme Court or state Appeals courts rule that their state's sodomy laws were unconstitutional. Georgia, Louisiana, and Massachusetts, have all had their state sodomy laws struck down by the courts, but the legislatures have not repealed those laws.[30] On April 18, 2013, the governor of Montana signed a bill repealing that state's sodomy law; it had previously been nullified by the Montana Supreme Court.[31] On April 23, 2014, the governor of Virginia signed a bill repealing that state's sodomy law.[32] Utah and Alabama repealed their sodomy laws in 2019 and Idaho did in 2022. On October 1, 2020, a bill repealing Maryland's sodomy law went into effect without the governor's signature,[33] and a bill repealing its \"unnatural sex practices\" law went into effect without the governor's signature in May 2023.[34] Minnesota also repealed its sodomy law in 2023.[35]\n\nTwelve states either have not yet formally repealed their laws against sexual activity among consenting adults or have not revised them to accurately reflect their true scope in the aftermath of Lawrence v. Texas. Often, the sodomy law was drafted to also encompass other forms of sexual conduct such as bestiality, and no attempt has subsequently succeeded in separating them. Nine states' statutes purport to ban all forms of sodomy, some including oral intercourse, regardless of the participants' genders: Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma and South Carolina. Three states specifically target their statutes at same-sex relations only: Kansas, Kentucky, and Texas.\n\nThe age of consent in each jurisdiction varies but in most jurisdictions it is equal to the age of consent for heterosexual sex.[36] The exception to this is Texas, whose statute books still hold an outdated Romeo and Juliet law that makes the age of consent for gay and lesbian teenagers unequal to that for heterosexual ones.[37][38][39]\n\nResearchers have shown that sodomy law repeals led to a decline in the number of arrests for disorderly conduct, prostitution, and other sex offenses, as well as a reduction in arrests for drug and alcohol consumption, in line with the hypothesis that sodomy law repeals enhanced mental health and lessened minority stress.[40]\n\nRecognition of marriage and adoption for same-sex couples\n\n[edit]\n\nMarriage\n\n[edit]\n\nThe movement to obtain civil marriage rights and benefits for same-sex couples in the United States began in the 1970s but remained unsuccessful for over forty years. On May 17, 2004, Massachusetts became the first U.S. state and the sixth jurisdiction in the world to legalize same-sex marriage following the Supreme Judicial Court's decision six months earlier.[41] Before nationwide legalization, same-sex marriage became legal in 36 states; twenty-four states by court order, nine by legislative action, and three by referendum. Some states had legalized same-sex marriage by more than one of the three actions.\n\nOn June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges that states must license and recognize same-sex marriages. Consequently, same-sex marriage is legal in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Northern Mariana Islands. Currently, same-sex marriages are recognized in American Samoa, due to the Respect for Marriage Act. The legal status of same-sex marriage also varies in Native American tribal nations, as their reservations are considered sovereign entities and were not affected by the Supreme Court's legalization in 2015.\n\nCivil unions\n\n[edit]\n\nPrior to nationwide same-sex marriage, fifteen U.S. states had civil unions or domestic partnerships. The first state to allow same-sex unions was Vermont in July 2000. Many of these states retain those laws as a continued choice for same-sex couples, and opposite-sex couples in certain states.\n\nAdoption\n\n[edit]\n\nSame-sex couples are allowed to adopt in states and territories following the ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges legalizing same-sex marriage. Prior to Obergefell, various states by legislative and judicial action had allowed joint adoption by same-sex couples.\n\nCitizenship\n\n[edit]\n\nNaturalized U.S. citizens whose biological children are born abroad may be unable to obtain U.S. citizenship for their children even if their spouse is also a U.S. citizen. This may disproportionately affect same-sex couples, given that typically only one spouse is biologically related to the child.[42]\n\nIn October 2020, with representation by Lambda Legal, Immigration Equality and law firm Morgan Lewis & Bockius;[43] the United States Department of State withdrew its appeal of the verdict in Kiviti v. Pompeo, and declined to appeal Mize-Gregg v. Pompeo.[44][42] The State Department's refusal to recognize children born overseas to married same-sex, American citizen couples as U.S. citizens was ruled to be unlawful by Federal district court judges in both cases.[43][45]\n\nFormer restrictions\n\n[edit]\n\nDefense of Marriage Act\n\nMain article: Defense of Marriage Act\n\nSee also: Respect for Marriage Act\n\nThe United States Congress enacted the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in 1996, which forbade the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages and relieved states of the requirement that they recognize same-sex unions performed in other jurisdictions.\n\nOn June 26, 2013, Section 3 of DOMA (\"Definition of marriage\") was ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in United States v. Windsor. The law became effectively unenforceable after the U.S. Supreme Court decision Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) and was fully repealed by the Respect for Marriage Act in 2022.\n\nFormer state bans on same-sex marriage\n\nAfter the passage of the DOMA in 1996, many state legislators enacted state statutes, nicknamed mini-DOMA's, that ban same-sex marriage.[46]\n\nAfter Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage in 2004, fourteen states amended their constitution to ban recognition of same-sex marriages and many banning civil unions as well.\n\nTwenty-eight states passed state constitutional amendments that banned same-sex marriage: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin.\n\nHawaii voters approved[when?] a narrower constitutional amendment empowering the legislature to outlaw same-sex marriage, which they had already done in 1993.\n\nOn November 6, 2012, Minnesota became the first state to vote down a proposed constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. The amendment failed with a 53% to 47% vote.[47]\n\nAll state constitutional and statutory bans on same-sex marriage were declared unconstitutional in June 2015 in Obergefell v. Hodges.\n\nDiscrimination protections\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Equality Act, which is currently proposed in the United States Congress, would outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity nationwide.[48]\n\nAnti-discrimination laws\n\n[edit]\n\nU.S. federal law does not explicitly include protections against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. In June 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that sexual orientation and gender identity are included under \"sex\" as a prohibited ground of employment discrimination in the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[49] The ruling may impact other federal civil rights barring sex discrimination in education, health care, housing, and financial credit.\n\nExplicit and comprehensive anti-discrimination protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity have been proposed by the United States Congress under the Equality Act, which was passed in the House by a vote of 236-173 on May 17, 2019,[48][50] but has since stalled in the Senate.[51] During the 2024 United States presidential election, the Heritage foundation with contributors from the cabinet of Donald Trump has outlined legislation on Project 2025 for a large rollback of LGBT rights in the United States and a rollback of same-sex marriage in the US. As well as a rollback on all legal protections on the basis of \"gender identity.\"[52][53][54]\n\nEmployment\n\n[edit]\n\nEmployment discrimination refers to discriminatory employment practices such as bias in hiring, promotion, job assignment, termination, and compensation, and various types of harassment.[55]\n\nThere is no federal statute explicitly addressing employment discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. However, in June 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that sexual orientation and gender identity are included under \"sex\" as a prohibited ground of employment discrimination in the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[49] This effectively means that in the U.S., no employer can fire an employee on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nTwenty-four states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and over 140 cities and counties have enacted bans on discrimination based on sexual orientation and/or sexual identity. Additionally, some states have laws or regulations that ban discrimination based on gender identity and/or sexual orientation in public employment only.\n\nPresidents have also established certain protections for some employees of the federal government by executive order. In 1995, President Bill Clinton's Executive Order 12968 establishing criteria for the issuance of security clearances included sexual orientation for the first time in its non-discrimination language: \"The United States Government does not discriminate based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, or sexual orientation in granting access to classified information.\" It also said that \"no inference\" about suitability for access to classified information \"may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the employee.\"[56] Clinton's Executive Order 13087 in 1998 prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation in the competitive service of the federal civilian workforce. It applied to the large majority of federal employees, but not to the excepted services such as the military.[57]\n\nAt the start of 2010, the Obama administration included gender identity among the classes protected against discrimination under the authority of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). In 2012, the EEOC ruled that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not allow gender identity-based employment discrimination because it is a form of sexual discrimination.[58][59][60]\n\nOn July 21, 2014, President Obama signed Executive Order 13672, adding \"gender identity\" to the categories protected against discrimination in hiring in the federal civilian workforce, and both \"sexual orientation\" and \"gender identity\" to the categories protected against discrimination in hiring and employment on the part of federal government contractors and sub-contractors.[61][62] Obama's related Executive Order 13673[a] required federal contractors to prove their compliance with labor laws, but President Trump revoked this requirement on March 27, 2017.[63]\n\nAs of June 15, 2020, all persons working for employers that employ more than 15 people are protected from discrimination based solely on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity via the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Bostock v. Clayton County.[64] The plaintiffs of the case include Gerald Bostock, Aimee Stephens, and Donald Zarda, each fired based upon their sexuality or gender identity. Two-thirds of registered U.S. voters agree with the Supreme Court's decision that employment nondiscrimination laws should protect LGBT identity, according to a HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted several days later.[65]\n\nHousing\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) is an agency within the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. FHEO is responsible for administering and enforcing federal fair housing laws and establishing policies that make sure all Americans have equal access to the housing of their choice. Housing discrimination refers to discrimination against potential or current tenants by landlords. In the United States, there is no federal law against such discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, but at least twenty-two states and many major cities have enacted laws prohibiting it.[66] See, for example, Washington House Bill 2661.\n\nIn 2012, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity issued a regulation called \"Equal Access\" to prohibit LGBT discrimination in federally-assisted housing programs.[67] It ensures that the Department's core housing programs are open to all eligible persons, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. In 2019, however, there was an attempt to weaken the regulation.[68]\n\nThe Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity is responsible for enforcing a variety of fair housing laws, which prohibit discrimination in both privately owned and publicly assisted housing including:\n\nThe Fair Housing Act\n\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\n\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973\n\nSection 109 of Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974\n\nTitle II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990\n\nArchitectural Barriers Act of 1968\n\nAge Discrimination Act of 1975\n\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972\n\nAmong the landmark civil cases on gay rights in housing is Braschi v Stahl Associates Co. In 1989 New York Court of Appeals case that decided that plaintiff Miguel Braschi, the surviving partner of a same-sex relationship, counted as \"family\" under New York law and was thus able to continue living in a rent controlled apartment belonging to the deceased partner.[69][70]\n\nMedical facilities\n\n[edit]\n\nOn April 14, 2010, President Barack Obama issued an Executive Order to the Department of Health and Human Services to draft new rules for all hospitals accepting Medicare or Medicaid funds. They would require facilities to grant visitation and medical decision-making rights to gay and lesbian partners, as well as designees of others such as widows and widowers.[71] Such rights are not protected by law in many states. Obama said he was inspired by the case of a Florida family, where one of the mothers died while her partner and four children were denied visitation by the hospital.[71] On June 12, 2020, the Trump administration issued a new rule stating that sexual orientation and gender identity were not covered under the anti-discrimination protections of the Affordable Care Act,[72] but this was reversed by the Biden administration, restoring the Obama-era policy.[73]\n\nAccording to the American advocacy group Human Rights Campaign, more than 470 local anti-LGBT bills have been introduced in 2023 by members of the conservative Republican Party, including more than 190 that are specifically anti-trans. While in past years conservatives have focused on bathroom bills and banning trans athletes from sports, most bills passed in 2023 have focused on banning gender-affirming health care. Critics noted that these events are a part of the wider culture war between liberals and conservatives in the U.S[74]\n\nHate crime laws\n\n[edit]\n\nHate crime laws (also known as bias crimes laws) protect against crimes motivated by feelings of enmity against a protected class. Until 2009, a 1969 federal law defined hate crimes committed on the basis of a person's race, color, religion, or nation origin when engaging in a federally protected activity. In October 2009, Congress passed the Matthew Shepard Act, which expanded the definition of hate crimes to include gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, and disability.[75] It removed the requirement that the victim of a hate crime be engaged in a federally protected activity.[76] President Obama signed the legislation on October 28, 2009.[77]\n\nTwo statutes, the Hate Crime Statistics Act (1990) and the Campus Hate Crimes Right to Know Act (1997), require the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), as well as college/university campus security authorities, to collect and publish hate crime statistics.\n\nAs of December 2023 , forty-six states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands have statutes criminalizing various types of bias-motivated violence or intimidation (the exceptions are Arkansas, Georgia, South Carolina, and Wyoming). Each of these statutes covers bias on the basis of race, religion, and ethnicity; 34 cover disability; 34 of them cover sexual orientation; 28 cover gender; 13 cover age; 23 cover gender identity; five cover political affiliation.[78] 31 states and the District of Columbia have statutes creating a civil cause of action, in addition to the criminal penalty, for similar acts.[78] Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia have statutes requiring the state to collect hate crime statistics; 16 of these cover sexual orientation.[78]\n\nIn Wisconsin v. Mitchell (1993) the Supreme Court unanimously held that state penalty-enhancement laws for hate crimes were constitutional and did not violate First Amendment rights to freedom of thought and expression.\n\nLaws that prohibit hate speech, including those that relate to sexual orientation or gender identity, are considered unconstitutional, due to the First Amendment's broad protections for free speech.[79]\n\nGay panic defense\n\n[edit]\n\nFederal laws\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2018, Senator Edward Markey (D-MA) and Representative Joseph Kennedy III (D-MA) introduced S.3188 and H.R.6358, respectively, which would prohibit a federal criminal defendant from asserting, as a defense, that the nonviolent sexual advance or an individual or a perception or belief of the gender, gender identity, or expression, or sexual orientation of an individual excuses or justifies conduct or mitigates the severity of an offense. Both bills died in committee. In June 2019, the bill was reintroduced in both houses of Congress as the Gay and Trans Panic Defense Prohibition Act of 2019 (S.1721 and H.R.3133). it has been reintroduced in both the 2021 and 2023 sessions.\n\nState laws\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of October 2023, 17 states and the District of Columbia have banned the so-called \"gay panic defense\": California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Nevada, New Hampshire New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington.[80]\n\nMilitary service\n\n[edit]\n\nAlthough the U.S. military discharged soldiers for homosexual acts throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth century, U.S. military law did not expressly prohibit homosexuality or homosexual conduct until February 4, 1921. On May 5, 1950, the Uniform Code of Military Justice was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Harry S. Truman, and became effective on May 31, 1951. Article 125 forbade sodomy among all military personnel, defining it as \"any person subject to this chapter who engages in unnatural carnal copulation with another person of the same or opposite sex or with an animal is guilty of sodomy. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete the offence.\" Application of Article 125 was severely limited by the 2003 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Lawrence v. Texas, and it was amended only to apply to 'forcible sodomy' on December 26, 2013, when President Barack Obama signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 finally repealed the article and its classification of sodomy, as a crime separate from rape, altogether.\n\nPrior to 1993, lesbian and gay people were not permitted to serve in the U.S. military. Under the \"Don't ask, don't tell\" (DADT) policy enacted that year, they were permitted to do so only if they did not disclose their sexual orientation. The Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010 permitted homosexual men and women to serve openly in the armed forces once designated government officials certified that the military was prepared for the repeal.[81] Since September 20, 2011, gays, lesbians, and bisexuals have been able to serve openly.[82]\n\nTransgender women and other individuals that are assigned male at birth are still required to sign-up for the Selective Service.[83]\n\nOn July 13, 2015, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said that the current regulations banning transgender individuals from serving were outdated, and announced a six-month study to determine if lifting the ban would have any impact on the military's effectiveness.[84] On June 30, 2016, Carter announced that the ban on transgender troops from openly serving had been lifted.[85] The policy went into effect on October 1, 2016, and training on transgender issues was scheduled to begin a month later.\n\nOn October 24, 2016, 10 soldiers in the U.S. Army became the first to openly petition for a sex change since the ban on service by transgender individuals was lifted.[86] The military was originally scheduled to complete its adjustment to openly transgender troops by July 2017.[86] That month, however, President Trump declared in a tweet that transgender people would be prohibited from serving in the military.[87] The next day, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford said, \"There will be no modifications to the current policy until the President's direction has been received by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary has issued implementation guidance. In the meantime, we will continue to treat all of our personnel with respect.\"[88]\n\nTrump later published a memo on August 25, 2017, directing that an implementation plan be submitted to him by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security by February 2018.[89] In November 2018, the Trump administration formally asked the Supreme Court to issue a ruling on the matter, even though lower courts were still hearing appeals.[90] Though the Supreme Court initially refused this request, on January 22, 2019, it granted temporary permission to the Trump administration to proceed with its ban,[91][92] and on March 12 the Department of Defense released a memorandum describing the terms of the ban to take effect on April 12, 2019.[93]\n\nThe memorandum offers some protection for existing military personnel who were already diagnosed with \"gender dysphoria\" or who were already serving in their self-designated gender before the memorandum was issued.[94] However, new personnel must serve in their birth gender/sex and are disqualified from service if they have a recent history of gender dysphoria or if they have ever received hormones and surgery related to gender transition. Two bipartisan bills in Congress are pushing back against the ban.[95][96]\n\nOn January 25, 2021, the new Biden administration revoked Trump's ban through an executive order, reverting the policy regarding transgender people and military service to what it was in 2016 under the Obama administration. Transgender personnel are now allowed to serve in the military under varying conditions and requirements. On April 30, 2021, the United States Department of Defense enacted a new policy calling for better medical access and gender marker assistance to transgender people serving in the United States Military.[97][98]\n\nPrison\n\n[edit]\n\nSolitary confinement\n\n[edit]\n\nMore than 8,400 detained migrants—over a five-year period spanning both the Obama and Trump administrations—were placed in solitary confinement, which remains an ongoing practice as of May 2019. In half of the cases, detainees were being punished, but in the other half, the confinement was due to the person's mental illness, physical disability, or sexual orientation. Journalists identified six suicides among this population.[99]\n\nConjugal visits\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the United States, four states permit conjugal visits to prisoners: California, Connecticut, New York, and Washington;[100] all of these U.S. states have legalized same-sex marriage in June 2015.[101] In June 2007, California, following the enactment in 2005 of a state law requiring state agencies to provide the same rights to domestic partners as to married couples, became the first U.S. state to allow same-sex conjugal visits. The new rules allowed for visits only by registered same-sex married couples or domestic partners, provided that the same-sex marriage or domestic partnership was established before the prisoner was incarcerated.[102] In New York, prior to the vote on same-sex visits, this state allowed 27 out of its 60 facilities to allow same-sex conjugal visits, but this law was not enforced state wide until April 2011. In 2014, both New Mexico and Mississippi banned conjugal visits.[103][104]\n\nTransgender rights in the United States\n\n[edit]\n\nSince April 11, 2022 US Passports give the sex/gender options of male, female and X by self determination.[105] Discrimination rates are very high for the transgender community and especially for transgender people of color.[106] Some frequent examples of discrimination and other forms of oppression faced by the transgender community are violence and hate crimes,[107][108] homelessness,[109] poverty,[110] sexual assault,[111][112][113] housing discrimination,[114] employment discrimination,[115] harassment,[116] bullying,[117] disproportionate rates of arrest and incarceration,[118] prison and immigration violence and mistreatment,[119] airport security humiliation,[120][121] HIV/AIDS[122] and health disparities,[123][124] governmental/bureaucratic barriers to transitioning (documents and surgery requirements),[125] economic and societal barriers to transitioning (the high costs of medical care and the frequent denial of care),[126][127] to name only a few.\n\nSome who experience exclusion from the workforce, turn to survival crimes, such as sex work, in order to have an income as a direct result of economic oppression and discrimination.[118] With the passage of the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA) and Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA) bills, those individuals who turn to sex work are put in more danger because they are forced to turn back to more dangerous methods of finding work, such as through pimps and working on the streets, than online forums where they were able to vet clients.[128][129][130][131][132]\n\nFrequently, the media, and politicians sensationalize transgender identities and oppression is reinforced. Aware of this trend, in 2016, a coalition of over 250 anti-sexual assault and domestic violence organizations have released a joint letter decrying the trend of portraying transgender people in restrooms as sexual predators as untrue and harmful. Likewise, GLAAD has released a media guide[133] for reporters covering restroom usage in relation to the transgender community.\n\nIn 2022, over 230 anti-transgender bills were introduced in state legislatures in a coordinated national campaign to target transgender rights,[134] and over 350 in 2023.[135] Many of these bills became law.\n\nMany transgender advocates also advocate for converting single-occupant, gender-segregated restrooms into single-occupant, all-gender restrooms by simply changing the signs due to the high rates of harassment and even violence faced by the transgender community when accessing gender-segregated restrooms according to their gender expression. All-gender/gender-neutral restrooms are also beneficial to nursing mothers, parents with different-sex children, and people with disabilities.[136] Transgender advocates affirm all-gender restrooms as well as access to gendered restrooms as a matter of choice, safety, privacy, and dignity.[137]\n\nIdentity documents\n\n[edit]\n\nDifferent procedures and requirements for legal name changes and gender marker changes on birth certificates, drivers licenses, social security identification and passports exist and can be inconsistent. Many states require gender reassignment surgery to change their name and gender marker. Also, documents that do not match each other can present difficulties in conducting personal affairs - particularly those which require multiple, matching forms of identification. Furthermore, having documents that do not match a person's gender presentation has been reported to lead to harassment and discrimination.\n\nBirth certificates\n\n[edit]\n\nU.S. states make their own laws about birth certificates, and state courts have issued varied rulings about transgender people.[138][139]\n\nMost states permit the name and sex to be changed on a birth certificate, either by amending the existing birth certificate or by issuing a new one, although some require medical proof of sex reassignment surgery to do so.\n\nTennessee will not change the sex on a birth certificate at all, under any circumstances.[140][141][142] In February 2020, the Idaho House of Representatives passed a similar bill.[143] Oklahoma banned gender change in 2021.[144] In 2022, Montana banned gender change.[145]\n\nDrivers' licenses\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of February 2024, all U.S. States except for Kansas and Florida allow the gender marker to be changed on a driver's license, although the requirements for doing so vary by state. Often, the requirements for changing one's driver's license are less stringent than those for changing the marker on the birth certificate. For example, until August 1, 2015, the state of Massachusetts required sex reassignment surgery for a birth certificate change,[146][147] but only a form including a sworn statement from a physician that the applicant is in fact the new gender to correct the sex designation on a driver's license.[148] As of November 2019, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts no longer requires any documentation or a sworn statement from a medical doctor in order to change one's gender marker on their drivers license/state ID. In order to change the gender marker, one only needs to fill out a new drivers license/ID card application reflecting the correct information.[149] The state of Virginia had policies similar to those of Massachusetts, requiring Sex reassignment surgery (SRS) for a birth certificate change, but not for a driver's license change.[150][151] Virginia removed the requirement for surgery to change the gender marker in September 2020.[152]\n\nSometimes, the states' requirements and laws conflict with and are dependent on each other; for example, a transgender woman who was born in Tennessee but living in Kentucky will be unable to have the gender marker changed on her Kentucky driver's license. This is due to the fact that Kentucky requires an amended birth certificate reflecting the person's accurate gender, but the state of Tennessee does not change gender markers on birth certificates at all.[153]\n\nOn July 1, 2023, Kansas Senate Bill 180 went into effect, mandating that gender markers on birth certificates and driver's licenses reflect a person's sex at birth – reversing a 2019 federal equal protection lawsuit settlement which allowed birth certificates to be changed to reflect a person's gender identity.[154]\n\nIn January 2024, Florida banned changing the gender marker on driver's licenses. Additionally, any person \"misrepresenting\" their gender would be subject to criminal and civil penalties.[155][156]\n\nIn addition, a number of states and city jurisdictions have passed legislation to allow a third gender marker on official identification documents (see below).\n\nCases\n\n[edit]\n\nIn May 2015, six Michigan transgender people filed Love v. Johnson in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, challenging the state's policy requiring the information on a person's driver's license match the information on their birth certificate.[157][158] This policy requires transgender people to change the information on their birth certificates in order to change their driver's licenses, which at the time of filing was not possible in Tennessee, Nebraska and Ohio, where three of the plaintiffs were born, and requires a court order in South Carolina, where a fourth was born. The remaining two residents were born in Michigan, and would be required to undergo surgery to change their birth certificates.[157] The plaintiffs in the case are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union.[157][158]\n\nIn November 2015, Judge Nancy Edmunds denied the State of Michigan's motion to dismiss the case.[157]\n\nPassports\n\n[edit]\n\nThe U.S. State Department determines what identifying biographical information is placed on passports. On June 10, 2010, the policy on gender changes was amended to allow permanent gender marker changes to be made with the statement of a physician that \"the applicant has had appropriate clinical treatment for gender transition to the new gender.\"[159] The previous policy required a statement from a surgeon that gender reassignment surgery was completed.[160] Since April 11, 2022, American passports give the sex/gender options of male, female and X by self determination.[105][161]\n\nThird gender option\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2022, the U.S. federal government recognizes a third gender option on passports. Other countries including Australia, New Zealand, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Germany, Malta, and Canada have begun recognizing this.[162][163][164][165][166] Third genders have traditionally been acknowledged in a number of Native American cultures as \"two spirit\" people, in traditional Hawaiian culture as the māhū, and as the fa'afafine in American Samoa.[167][168][169][170] Similarly, immigrants from traditional cultures that acknowledge a third gender would benefit from such a reform, including the muxe gender in southern Mexico and the hijra of south Asian cultures.[171][172][173]\n\nOn June 10, 2016, an Oregon circuit court ruled that a resident, Elisa Rae Shupe, could obtain a non-binary gender designation. The Transgender Law Center believes this to be \"the first ruling of its kind in the U.S.\"[174]\n\nGender-affirming care bans\n\n[edit]\n\nGender-affirming care for minors has been available in the U.S. for more than a decade and is endorsed by major medical associations, but it has increasingly come under attack in many conservative legislatures.[175] According to the ACLU, in 2023 alone, over 500 anti-LGBTQ bills were submitted in the US, over 130 of which were about healthcare.[176] Efforts to prohibit gender-affirming care for minors had begun several years earlier, but did not receive much attention from state legislatures until more recently.[177] The conservative organization Do No Harm was influential in developing model legislation that appeared starting in 2022 in Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, New Hampshire, and West Virginia legislatures.[178][179]\n\nIn February 2024, the American Psychological Association approved a policy statement supporting unobstructed access to health care and evidence-based clinical care for transgender, gender-diverse, and nonbinary children, adolescents, and adults, as well as opposing state bans and policies intended to limit access to such care.[180][181]\n\nAs of July 2024, 26 states had enacted some form of ban on gender-affirming care for minors, 19 of which were enacted in 2023.[182][183] However, 16 of these bans are being challenged in court as of January 2024.[184] Furthermore, only 17 of the 25 states have complete bans which are fully in effect. Six states have only partial bans and three are currently blocked from taking effect. While some states have banned all forms of medical transition, others such as Arizona, Nebraska, New Hampshire and Georgia have banned only specific types such as hormone therapy or surgery. Six states have exceptions which allow minors who were already receiving gender affirming care prior to the ban to continue their treatments.[184] Currently, all 26 states make exceptions for puberty blockers, hormones and surgery for cisgender and intersex children.[184] Only one state, West Virginia, makes exceptions in cases of \"severe dysphoria\". There is also currently only one state, Missouri, that has a ban which is set to expire after a certain period of time. Nearly all states with restrictions include specific provisions with penalties for providers and 4 states include provisions directed at parents or guardians.[184] An additional 4 states include laws/policies that impact school officials such as teachers and counselors, among others.[184]\n\nIn May 2024, Tennessee became the first state to prohibit helping a child access gender-affirming care without the consent of their parent or guardian. The child's parents are allowed to sue the person who assisted the pursuit of gender-affirming care. There is no criminal penalty.[185]\n\nAt the same time, many Democrat-controlled states have gone in the opposite direction and enacted laws protecting access to gender affirming care for minors and adults. These laws, often called \"shield\" laws, often explicitly combine protections for gender-affirming care and abortion and cover a variety of protections including protecting both providers and patients from being punished, mandating insurance providers to cover the procedures and acting as \"sanctuary states\" that protect patients traveling to the state from other states that have banned such treatments among other things.[186][187] As of June 2024, 16 states and the District of Columbia have enacted \"shield\" laws.\n\nOf the approximately 1.6 million Americans who are transgender, about 300,000 are under the age of 18.[188] As of October 2023, approximately 105,200 transgender youth aged 13 to 17 lived in states where gender affirming care is banned for minors. However, around 26,000 of those youth are currently still able to access care in their state due to court orders that prohibit enforcement of the laws. Conversely, around 146,700 transgender youth live in states that have passed gender-affirming care \"shield\" laws that support access to care by protecting doctors and parents who prescribe or seek access to medical care for youth.[182] An analysis from KFF in late January 2024 estimated that 38% of trans youth between the ages of 13–17 in the United States lived in states with laws limiting youth access to gender-affirming care.[184]\n\nBans on gender-affirming care have led some families with transgender children to flee their states.[189][190][191]\n\nBans for minors\n\n[edit]\n\nLaws which are currently unenforceable due to a court injunction\n\nLaws which only partially ban gender affirming care for minors\n\nBans of gender-affirming healthcare for people under 18 State Authority Signed Effective Notes Arkansas State legislature April 6, 2021 Permanently blocked On April 6, 2021, the legislature—overriding Governor Asa Hutchinson's veto on a bill that banned puberty blockers, hormones, and surgery for minors and from referring them to other providers.[177] However, courts temporarily[192] and then permanently blocked the law.[193] Texas Texas AG Ken Paxton\n\nGovernor Greg Abbott\n\nFebruary 22, 2022\n\nJune 2, 2023\n\nBlocked by injunction (order)\n\nSeptember 1, 2023 (legislation)\n\nIn February 2022, the state Attorney General ordered a ban on gender-affirming care for trans youth, with criminal penalties for failing to report suspected violations.[194][195] However, the order is currently blocked by injunction.[196]\n\nIn June 2023, the governor signed a law to ban this care for minors.[197] On August 25, 2023, a district court judge blocked the law from taking effect. In response, the Attorney General's office filed an appeal with the Texas Supreme Court, a move that automatically pauses the judge's injunction and allowed the law to go into effect on September 1, 2023, as originally planned.[198] On June 28, 2024, the Texas Supreme Court upheld the law.[199]\n\nAlabama Governor Kay Ivey April 8, 2022[200] May 8, 2022[201] It is a felony for a medical provider to give gender-affirming healthcare to transgender people under 19 (the age of majority in Alabama). In May 2022, a federal judge ruled that the ban on surgery was enforceable. However, the ban on puberty blockers and hormones was not enforceable while the law is challenged in court.[202] In August 2023, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision, allowing the ban on puberty blockers and hormones to take effect.[203] Utah Governor Spencer Cox January 27, 2023 [204][205][206][207] South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem February 13, 2023[208][209][210] Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves February 28, 2023[211][212] Tennessee Governor Bill Lee March 2, 2023[213][214] Florida Florida Board of Medicine\n\nGovernor Ron DeSantis\n\nPermanently blocked (legislation)\n\nBlocked (state board of medicine rule)\n\nThe state board of medicine rule took effect on March 16, 2023.[215][216] Additionally, on May 17, 2023, Governor DeSantis signed a ban into law, and it took effect immediately. It applies only to new patients, not those who were already receiving gender-affirming care.[217] However, on June 6, 2023, a court temporarily blocked enforcement of both the board rule and the law.[218] In June 2024, a judge permanently blocked the law from taking effect.[219] Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds March 22, 2023[220] Georgia Governor Brian Kemp March 23, 2023[221] July 1, 2023 Bans hormones and surgery while continuing to allow puberty blockers. Minors who began hormones prior to July 1, 2023, are allowed to continue treatment.[222][223] West Virginia Governor Jim Justice March 29, 2023[224] The bill makes exceptions for minors who have received parental consent and are diagnosed with \"severe gender dysphoria\" by two doctors. Due to this exception, experts do not expect the ban to have much of an impact.[225] Kentucky State legislature March 29, 2023 July 14, 2023 The legislature overrode Governor Andy Beshear's veto, banning gender-affirming healthcare for trans minors.[226] Federal appeals judges allowed the ban to remain in effect during legal challenges to overturn it.[227][228] Arizona Governor Doug Ducey March 30, 2022 March 31, 2023 Bans gender-affirming surgery for minors, but not hormones and puberty blockers. The bill also makes some exceptions, including in the case of someone born intersex.[229][230] In mid 2023, a new Governor, Katie Hobbs reversed course by signing a series of executive orders which include shield-style protections for gender-affirming care, ensuring that it remains legal in Arizona. It also bans conversion therapy, requires insurance plans to cover gender-affirming care and bars state agencies from cooperating with civil and criminal cases in states where gender-affirming health care is illegal.[231] Idaho Governor Brad Little[232][233] April 4, 2023 April 15, 2024 It would also make it a felony for any medical practitioner to help a minor seek gender-affirming treatment. On December 27, 2023, a federal judge blocked the law from taking effect.[234] On April 15, 2024, the US Supreme Court responded to an emergency request filed in February by temporarily allowing the ban to go into effect while further legal challenges to it play out in the lower courts. The ruling did not resolve the underlying legal challenges raised by the case nor did the justices rule on the larger issue of bans on gender-affirming treatment for minors. The ruling also does not apply to the two plaintiffs in the lawsuit.[235][236] Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb[237] April 5, 2023 February 27, 2024 On June 16, 2023, a federal judge temporarily blocked the law from taking effect.[238] On February 27, 2024, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision allowing the ban to take effect.[239] North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum April 20, 2023 On April 20, 2023, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum signed a law criminalizing trans health care for minors. However, the law notably makes exceptions for medication treatment for \"rare circumstances with parental consent\". The law also allows medication treatment for early onset puberty and minors who were already receiving gender-affirming care will still be able to receive treatment.[240] Montana Governor Greg Gianforte April 28, 2023[241] Blocked Treatments such as puberty-blockers and breast-reduction surgery will still be legal for minors who are not suffering from gender dysphoria. On September 27, 2023, a Montana District Court judge prevented it from taking effect.[242] North Carolina State legislature August 17, 2023 Ban on gender-affirming care, such as hormones, puberty blockers, and surgery, for minors. The ban only applies to transgender children and still allows such treatments for intersex and cisgender children. The ban also only applies to new patients. Transgender children who started treatment prior to August 1, 2023, will be allowed to continue receiving treatment.[243] Governor Roy Cooper vetoed the bill on July 5, 2023,[244] but the state legislature overruled his veto on August 17, therefore making the bill law.[245] Missouri Governor Mike Parson June 7, 2023 August 28, 2023 People receiving puberty blockers or hormones before the ban went into effect may continue taking them. Otherwise, blockers and hormones are banned until 2027. Surgery is also banned. Louisiana State Legislature January 1, 2024 On June 29, 2023, John Bel Edwards vetoed a ban on blockers, hormones, and surgery for minors. On July 18, the Louisiana State Legislature overrode his veto. Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt May 1, 2023 On May 1, 2023, Governor Kevin Stitt signed a bill that makes it a felony for doctors to provide gender-transition medical care for anyone under the age of 18.[246] In October 2023, a judge declined to stop the law from taking effect.[247] Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen October 2, 2023 October 2, 2023 On October 2, 2023, the state Department of Health and Human Services announced that Republican Governor Jim Pillen had approved emergency regulations banning gender affirming surgeries for minors. Puberty blockers and hormone treatments for minors still remain legal, however applicants must now wait seven days and undergo at least 40 hours of \"clinically neutral\" therapy before starting them. The new regulations went into effect immediately.[248] Ohio State legislature August 6, 2024 On January 5, 2024, Governor Mike DeWine signed an executive order banning gender-affirming surgeries for minors.[249] Previously, on December 29, 2023, he had vetoed the Saving Adolescents from Experimentation (SAFE) Act (HB68) passed (mostly along party lines) by the Ohio Legislature on December 13 which banned gender-affirming surgeries as well as hormones and puberty blockers for minors. The bill includes exceptions for this kind of care for non-transgender youth, and it allows children who were already receiving gender-affirming care in Ohio to continue their treatment.[250] On January 24, 2024, the legislature overrode DeWine's veto thereby making HB68 law.[251] On April 16, 2024, a judge temporarily blocked the ban from taking effect.[252] On August 6, 2024, a judge overturned the injunction and allowed the law to take effect immediately. The plaintiffs immediately announced an appeal.[253] Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon March 22, 2024 July 1, 2024 On March 22, 2024, Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon signed a law criminalizing trans health care for minors.[254] South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster May 21, 2024 May 21, 2024 On May 21, 2024, South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster signed a law banning trans health care for minors. The law, which went into effect immediately, also requires principals, teachers and other school staff members to tell parents when their children want to use a name other than their legal one, or pronouns that do not match their sex assigned at birth. It also bars adults under 26 from using Medicaid to cover the costs for trans health care.[255] This part of the bill is in direct opposition to a 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling from the month prior which ruled that state Medicaid bans on gender-affirming care in the 4th Circuit, which includes South Carolina, are unconstitutional.[256] New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu July 19, 2024 January 1, 2025 On July 19, 2024, New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu signed a law banning gender-affirming genital surgeries for minors. However, puberty blockers, hormones and non-genital surgeries such as mastectomies remain legal for trans youth.[257][258]\n\nProtections for minors\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Shield\" laws protecting access to gender-affirming healthcare for people under 18 State Authority Signed Effective Notes Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont May 5, 2022 May 5, 2022 On May 5, 2022, Governor Ned Lamont signed House Bill 5414, a shield law that designates Connecticut as a \"safe harbor\" which protects people who provide abortions and gender affirming care in the state, as well as legal protections for people seeking abortions and gender-affirming health care from out-of-state.[259][260] Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker July 29, 2022 July 29, 2022 On July 29, 2022, Governor Charlie Baker signed a shield law which protects access to abortion and gender-affirming health care in the state.[261] California Governor Gavin Newsom September 30, 2022 January 1, 2023 On September 30, 2022, Governor Gavin Newsom signed SB 107, a shield law which designates California as a \"sanctuary state\" for trans youth and their families who are fleeing from other states that have banned the practice.[262] District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser November 21, 2022 November 21, 2022 On November 21, 2022, Mayor Muriel Bowser signed into law D.C. ACT 24-646, the Human Rights Sanctuary Amendment Act of 2022, which protects the right to bodily autonomy and of those seeking care for abortion, contraception, sexual conduct, intimate relationships, and gender affirmation.[263] Illinois Governor JB Pritzker January 13, 2023[264] January 13, 2023 On January 13, 2023, Governor JB Pritzker signed into law HB4664, a reproductive rights and gender affirming care omnibus bill that protects health care providers and their patients from legal attacks by neighboring states and expands reproductive and gender affirming health care access and options across the state. The bill takes historic action to protect Illinois providers and their patients, thousands of whom have traveled to Illinois to access essential care now banned in their home states. New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham March 16, 2023 March 16, 2023 On March 16, 2023, Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham signed into law House Bill 7, the Reproductive and Gender-Affirming Health Care Act, which prohibits public bodies, including local municipalities, from denying, restricting, or discriminating against an individual's right to use or refuse reproductive health care or health care related to gender.[265] Vermont Governor Phil Scott March 29, 2023 September 2023 On March 29, 2023, Governor Phil Scott signed into law House Bill 89 and Senate Bill 37, which establish a slate of protections for both providers and seekers of gender affirming health care, as well as those seeking or administering abortions.[266] New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy April 4, 2023 April 4, 2023 On April 4, 2023, Governor Phil Murphy signed Executive Order No. 326 establishing New Jersey as a safe haven for gender-affirming health care by directing all state departments and agencies to protect all persons, including health care professionals and patients, against potential repercussions resulting from providing, receiving, assisting in providing or receiving, seeking, or traveling to New Jersey to obtain gender-affirming health care services.[267] Colorado Governor Jared Polis April 14, 2023 April 14, 2023 On April 14, 2023, Governor Jared Polis signed into law a trio of health care bills enshrining access to abortion and gender-affirming procedures and medications in Colorado. These bills ensure people in surrounding states and beyond can go to Colorado to have an abortion, begin puberty blockers or receive gender-affirming surgery without fear of prosecution.[268] Minnesota Governor Tim Walz April 27, 2023 April 27, 2023 On April 27, 2023, Governor Tim Walz signed a shield law which protects minors fleeing from other states to receive gender-affirming care.[269] Washington Governor Jay Inslee May 9, 2023 May 9, 2023 On May 9, 2023, Governor Jay Inslee signed a shield law designating Washington as a \"sanctuary state\" for trans youth.[270] Maryland Governor Wes Moore June 6, 2023 June 6, 2023 On June 6, 2023, Governor Wes Moore signed an executive order to protect gender affirming health care in Maryland. The order will protect those seeking, receiving, or providing gender affirming care in Maryland from attempts at legal punishment by other states.[271] New York Governor Kathy Hochul June 26, 2023 June 26, 2023 On June 26, 2023, Governor Kathy Hochul signed a shield law designating New York as a \"sanctuary state\" for trans youth. This law protects access to transition-related medical care for transgender minors and bars state courts from enforcing the laws of other states that might authorize a child to be taken away if the parents provide gender-affirming medical care, including puberty blockers and hormone therapy. It also prohibits New York courts from considering transition-related care for minors as child abuse and bars state and local authorities from cooperating with out-of-state agencies regarding the provision of lawful gender-affirming care in New York.[272] Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs June 28, 2023 June 28, 2023 On March 30, 2022, Governor Doug Ducey signed a bill banning gender-affirming surgery for minors, but not hormones and puberty blockers.

Minors between the ages of 15 and 17 can receive gender affirming care without parental permission, whereas youth ages 14 and under must have parental permission.[273] Maine Governor Janet Mills April 23, 2024 April 23, 2024 On April 23, 2024, Governor Janet Mills signed a shield law designating Maine as a \"sanctuary state\" for gender-affirming care and abortion providers and makes access to such treatments \"legal rights\" in Maine. It states that criminal and civil actions against providers and patients are not enforceable if the access to that care occurred in Maine. Additionally, the bill prevents cooperation with out-of-state arrest warrants for gender-affirming care and abortion that happen within the state. It also protects doctors who provide gender-affirming care and abortion from actions by medical boards, malpractice insurance, and other regulating entities that seek to economically harm them or dissuade them from providing care. The bill also explicitly enshrines WPATH's Standards of Care into state law for the coverage of transgender healthcare.[274][275] Rhode Island Governor Daniel McKee June 25, 2024 June 25, 2024 On June 25, 2024, Governor Daniel McKee signed a shield law designating Rhode Island as a \"sanctuary state\" for gender-affirming care and abortion providers and makes access to such treatments \"legal rights\" in Rhode Island. The bill also protects providers from being sued for providing care.[276]\n\nBathroom bills\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Bathroom bill\n\nA bathroom bill is the common name for legislation or a statute that defines access to public toilets by gender (restrooms)—or transgender individual. Bathroom bills affect access to sex-segregated public facilities for an individual based on a determination of their sex as defined in some specific way—such as their sex as assigned at birth, their sex as listed on their birth certificate, or the sex that corresponds to their gender identity.[277] A bathroom bill can either be inclusive or exclusive of transgender individuals, depending on the aforementioned definition of their sex. Unisex public toilets are one option to overcome this controversy.\n\nCritics of bills which exclude transgender individuals from restrooms which conform to their gender identity argue that they do not make public restrooms any safer for cisgender (non-transgender) people, and that they make public restrooms less safe for both transgender people and gender non-conforming cisgender people.[278][279][280] Additionally, critics claim there have been no cases of a transgender person attacking a cisgender person in a public restroom,[278][281] although there has been at least one isolated incident of voyeurism in a fitting room.[282] By comparison, a much larger percentage of transgender people have been verbally, physically, and sexually harassed or attacked by cisgender people in public facilities.[283] For these reasons the controversy over transgender bathroom access has been labeled a moral panic.[284]\n\nProponents say such legislation is necessary to maintain privacy, protect what they claim to be an innate sense of modesty held by most cisgender people, prevent voyeurism, assault, molestation, and rape,[285] and retain psychological comfort.[286][287]\n\nOne bathroom bill, the Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act in North Carolina, was approved as a law in 2016, although portions of the measure were later repealed in 2017 as part of a compromise between the Democratic governor and Republican-controlled Legislature.\n\nPublic opinion\n\n[edit]\n\nPublic opinion regarding \"transgender bathroom rights\" in the United States is mixed, see summary table below.\n\nDate(s) conducted Support laws that require transgender individuals to use bathrooms that correspond to their birth sex Oppose laws that require transgender individuals to use bathrooms that correspond to their birth sex Don't know / NA Margin of error Sample Conducted by Polling type February 17, 2023 -March 3, 2023 45% 40% 16% ? 1,000 American adults Ipsos Online interviews June 10, 2019 45% 47% ? 1,100 American adults Pew Research Cellphone and landline phones May 29, 2019 - May 30, 2019 50% 50% ? 1,295 registered voters Harvard CAPS/Harris Poll Online interviews May 3, 2017 – May 7, 2017 48% 45% 7% 4% 1,011 adults American adults Gallup Cellphone and landline phones March 2017 40% 40% ? ?

These states include Alabama,[290] Arizona,[291] Arkansas,[292] Florida,[293] Georgia,[294] Idaho,[295] Indiana,[296] Iowa,[297] Kansas,[298] Kentucky,[299] Louisiana,[300] Mississippi,[301] Missouri,[302] Montana,[303] North Dakota,[304] Oklahoma,[305] South Carolina,[306] South Dakota,[307] Tennessee,[308] Texas,[309] Utah,[310] West Virginia,[311] and Wyoming.[312] The passage of legislation against transgender youth has seen increases in calls to Trans Lifeline, a suicide crisis hotline run by and for transgender people.[313]\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign has argued that these discriminatory laws are not about protecting women's sports, but rather attempt to “undermine the existence of transgender people.\"[314] Transgender advocates have noted that hormone replacement therapy and testosterone suppression reduces muscle mass and physical strength in transgender women, reducing the possibility of a competitive advantage.[315] Transgender inclusion in sports is supported by the Women's Sports Foundation, the Women's National Basketball Players Association (WNBPA), the National Women's Law Center, and Athlete Ally, as well as United States Women's National Soccer Team Captain Megan Rapinoe, tennis legend Billie Jean King, WNBA Minnesota Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve, and WNBA star Candace Parker.[316][317][318][319]\n\nThe US Department of Education has said transgender students are protected under Title IX.[320]\n\nTransgender people in prison\n\n[edit]\n\nIn September 2011, a California state court denied the request of a California inmate, Lyralisa Stevens, for sex reassignment surgery at the state's expense.[321]\n\nOn January 17, 2014, in Kosilek v. Spencer a three-judge panel of the First Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the Massachusetts Department of Corrections to provide Michelle Kosilek, a Massachusetts inmate, with sex reassignment surgery. It said denying the surgery violated Kosilek's Eighth Amendment rights, which included \"receiving medically necessary treatment ... even if that treatment strikes some as odd or unorthodox\".[322]\n\nOn April 3, 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice intervened in a federal lawsuit filed in Georgia to argue that denying hormone treatment for transgender inmates violates their rights. It contended that the state's policy that only allows for continuing treatments begun before incarceration was insufficient and that inmate treatment needs to be based on ongoing assessments.[323] The case was brought by Ashley Diamond, an inmate who had used hormone treatment for seventeen years before entering the Georgia prison system.[324]\n\nOn May 11, 2018, the US Bureau of Prisons announced that prison guidelines issued by the Obama administration in January 2017 to allow transgender prisoners to be transferred to prisons housing inmates of the gender which they identify with had been rescinded and that assigned sex at birth would once again determine where transgender prisoners are jailed.[325]\n\nAs of January 2021, one state, California, allows transgender people to be housed in prison according to their gender identity, and another, New Mexico, has separate facilities entirely, which are segregated off from other inmates, and are reserved for transgender people only.\n\nTransgender Day of Remembrance\n\n[edit]\n\nTransgender Day of Remembrance was founded in 1999 by Gwendolyn Ann Smith and JMEL a transgender woman,[326] to memorialize the murder of transgender woman Rita Hester in Allston, Massachusetts.[327] It has slowly evolved from the web-based project started by Smith into an international day of action every November 20. Transgender Day of Remembrance is now a day to honor all transgender lives lost to murder caused by transphobia. Several communities and organizations all over the world have made vigils accessible to all for the lost lives through murder.[328]\n\nIntersex rights in the United States\n\n[edit]\n\nSince April 11, 2022, US Passports have given the sex/gender options of male, female and X by self determination.[105] Intersex people in the United States have some of the same rights as others but with significant gaps, particularly in protection from non-consensual cosmetic medical interventions, violence, and discrimination.[329][330] Many non-consensual medical surgeries are being performed to \"fix\" these individuals when they are babies or children. Some are also put on hormones to ensure that their bodies develop to the sex they were assigned. In August 2018, the California state legislature passed a resolution that condemns these types of surgeries.[331][332][333][334] Actions by intersex civil society organizations aim to eliminate harmful practices and promote social acceptance and equality.[335][336] In recent years, intersex activists have also secured some legal recognition.[337]\n\nMedical discrimination\n\n[edit]\n\nHIV/AIDS\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1981, the AIDS epidemic, caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, was reported in the United States. HIV is transferred through infected blood and sexual contact, and in the early 1980s, risk factors were reported to include homosexuality and drug use.[338][339] One of the earliest medical clinics treating the disease was run in New York City by Dr. Joseph Sonnabend. By 1985, thousands of people in the United States had died. Many LGBT advocacy organizations began to speak up and raise funds.\n\nBlood and tissue donation\n\n[edit]\n\nFDA-recommended restrictions on MSM tissue donation are much more strict than for MSM blood donors. As of April 2022, the FDA stipulates that men who have had sex with men in the past three months cannot donate blood. Current regulations prohibit tissue and semen donation by any man who has had sex with another man in the preceding five years, even if all infectious testing is negative.[341] This five-year MSM deferral policy prevents thousands of donations of eye tissue annually, despite a global shortage of donated eye tissue needed for vision-restoring corneal transplant surgeries.[342]\n\nConversion therapy\n\n[edit]\n\nConversion therapy is the discredited practice of attempting to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity.[343] 21 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico ban the practice of conversion therapy on minors.[344]\n\nHistory of U.S. Supreme Court decisions on LGBT rights\n\n[edit]\n\nIn March 1956, a Federal District Court ruled that ONE: The Homosexual Magazine, was obscene under the Federal Comstock laws and thus could not be sent through the United States Postal Service. This ruling was upheld by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, but in 1958, the Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling in One, Inc. v. Olesen, 355 U.S. 371 (1958), which overturned the previous rulings under a new legal precedent that had been established by the landmark case, Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476 (1957). As a result, gay newspapers, magazines and other publications could be lawfully distributed through the public mail service. On May 22, 1967, the Supreme Court ruled in Boutilier v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 387 U.S. 118 (1967), to uphold the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which among other things banned homosexuals, as constitutional. This ban remained in effect until 1991.[345]\n\nIn 1972, a Tacoma, Washington teacher of twelve years with a perfect record was terminated after a former student outed him to the vice-principal. The Washington Supreme Court found that homosexuality was immoral and impaired his efficiency as a teacher. The court supported its conclusion in various ways, including the definition of homosexuality in the New Catholic Encyclopedia, the criminal nature of homosexual conduct, and finding that an \"immoral\" person could not be trusted to instruct students as his presence would be inherently disruptive. On October 3, 1977, the Supreme Court denied certiorari, although Justices Brennan and Marshall would have granted cert. This was the first homosexual discrimination decision to be aired on national network news. In fact, it was simultaneously aired on all three national network evening news shows, reaching approximately 60 million viewers.[346][347][348][349][350]\n\nIn 1985, the Supreme Court heard Board of Education v. National Gay Task Force, which concerned First and Fourteenth Amendment challenges against a law that allowed schools to fire teachers for public homosexual conduct.[351] The Court affirmed the lower court by an equally divided vote 4–4 allowing the Tenth Circuit's ruling that partially struck down the law to stand without setting precedent.[352][353]\n\nAlso in 1985, the Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of Gay Student Services v. Texas A&M University, letting stand an appellate ruling ordering the university to provide official recognition of a student organization for homosexual students.[354][355]\n\nOn June 30, 1986, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in Bowers v. Hardwick, that same-sex intimate conduct was not protected under the right to privacy established under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nOn May 20, 1996, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in Romer v. Evans against an amendment to the Colorado state constitution that would have prevented any city, town or county in the state from taking any legislative, executive, or judicial action to protect homosexual or bisexual citizens from discrimination on the basis of their sexual orientation.\n\nOn March 4, 1998, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services that federal laws banning on-the-job sexual harassment also applied when both parties are the same sex. The lower courts, however, have reached differing conclusions about whether this ruling applies to harassment motivated by anti-gay animus.\n\nOn June 28, 2000, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in Boy Scouts of America v. Dale that the Boy Scouts of America had a First Amendment right to exclude people from its organization on the basis of sexual orientation, irrespective of any applicable civil rights laws.\n\nOn June 26, 2003, the Supreme Court ruled in Lawrence v. Texas that intimate consensual sexual conduct is part of the liberty protected by substantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. The majority opinion, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, explicitly overruled Bowers v. Hardwick, a 1986 decision that found sodomy laws to be constitutional.[23]\n\nTen years after the Lawrence decision, the Supreme Court ruled on June 26, 2013, by a 5–4 vote in United States v. Windsor that section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, that forbade the federal government from recognizing lawfully performed same-sex marriages, was found to violate the Fifth Amendment. The federal government then began to recognize lawfully performed same-sex marriages, and provide federal rights, privileges and benefits.[356][357]\n\nOn June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges that same-sex marriage cannot be prohibited by a state. Consequently, same-sex marriages are licensed and recognized as valid and enforced in all states and areas subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nOn June 15, 2020, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the protections provided by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 are also extended to LGBT individuals, thereby making it illegal for workplaces with 15 or more employees to discriminate on the basis of sexuality or gender identity.[358] The three consolidated cases were Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarda; Bostock v. Clayton County; and R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. USA Today afterwards stated that in addition to LGBTQ employment discrimination, \"The court's ruling is likely to have a sweeping impact on federal civil rights laws barring sex discrimination in education, health care, housing and financial credit.\"[359]\n\nOn June 30, 2023, the Supreme Court ruled by a 6-3 vote in 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis that businesses can refuse to create works that recognize same-sex marriage if it goes against their values, on the basis of the First Amendment's protection of free speech.[360]\n\nHistory of LGBT rights under U.S. presidents\n\n[edit]\n\nGeorge Washington\n\n[edit]\n\nCommander-in-Chief of the Continental Army\n\n[edit]\n\nTo train the new American Army in the latest military drills and tactics, General George Washington brought in Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben (1730–94), who had been an officer on the German General staff. Von Steuben escaped Germany where he was threatened with prosecution for homosexuality. He joined Washington's army at Valley Forge in February 1778 accompanied by two young aides. Steuben became an American general, and a senior advisor to Washington. Despite rumors about sexual behavior at his parties, there never was an investigation of Steuben, and he received a congressional pension after the war.[361][362]\n\nThe first evidence of discrimination to homosexuals serving in the United States military dates from March 11, 1778, when Lieutenant Frederick Gotthold Enslin was brought to trial before a court-martial. According to General Washington's report: \"...Lieutt. Enslin of Colo. Malcolm's Regiment tried for attempting to commit sodomy ...\" Washington's secretary described the results of the trial: \"His Excellency the Commander in Chief approves the sentence and with Abhorrence & Detestation of such Infamous Crimes orders Lieut. Enslin to be drummed out of Camp tomorrow morning....\"[363]\n\nJohn Adams\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1801, Congress enacted the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801 that continued all criminal laws of Maryland and Virginia in the now formally structured District, with those of Maryland applying to that portion of the District ceded from Maryland, and those of Virginia applying to that portion ceded from Virginia. At the time, Maryland had a sodomy law applicable only to free males with a punishment of \"labour for any time, in their discretion, not exceeding seven years for the same crime, on the public roads of the said county, or in making, repairing or cleaning the streets or bason [sic] of Baltimore-town;\" it imposed the death penalty for slaves committing sodomy. Similarly, Virginia had a penalty of 1–10 years for free persons committing sodomy, but imposed the death penalty for slaves committing sodomy. The law went into effect on February 27, 1801.[364]\n\nThomas Jefferson\n\n[edit]\n\nGovernor of Virginia\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1779, Thomas Jefferson wrote a law in Virginia which contained a maximum punishment of castration for men who engaged in sodomy.[365] However, what was intended by Jefferson as a liberalization of the sodomy laws in Virginia at that time was rejected by the Virginia Legislature, which continued to prescribe death as the maximum penalty for the crime of sodomy in that state.[366]\n\nAndrew Jackson\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1831, Congress established penalties in the District of Columbia for a number of crimes, but not for sodomy. It specified that \"every other felony, misdemeanor, or offence not provided for by this act, may and shall be punished as heretofore[.]\" At the time, Maryland and Virginia had a penalty of 1–10 years for committing sodomy. It went into effect on March 2, 1831.[364]\n\nWilliam Henry Harrison\n\n[edit]\n\nGovernor of the Indiana Territory\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1807, William Henry Harrison signed into law a comprehensive criminal code that included the first sodomy law for the Indiana Territory that eliminated the gender-specifics, reduced the penalty for a maximum of 1 to 5 years in prison, a fine of $100 to $500, up to 500 lashes on the back, and a permanent loss of civil rights.[367]\n\nBenjamin Harrison\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1892, Congress passed a law for the District of Columbia that states that \"for the preservation of the public peace and the protection of property within the District of Columbia.\" Labeled in the law as vagrants were \"all public prostitutes, and all such persons who lead a notoriously lewd or lascivious course of life[.]\" All offenders had to post bond of up to $200 for good behavior for a period of six months. The law went into effect on July 29, 1892.[364]\n\nWilliam McKinley\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1898, Congress deleted the word \"notoriously\" from the provision concerning a lewd or lascivious course of life, thereby allowing prosecution of persons without the condition of notoriety. The bond for good behavior was raised to $500, and the law was made gender-neutral. The law went into effect on July 8, 1898.[364]\n\nIn 1901, Congress adopted a new code for the District of Columbia that expressly recognized common-law crimes, with a penalty for them of up to five years and/or a $1,000 fine. The law went into effect on March 3, 1901.[364]\n\nWoodrow Wilson\n\n[edit]\n\nOn December 14, 1916, President Woodrow Wilson vetoed the Immigration Act of 1917, which would have excluded individuals from entering the United States who were found \"mentally defective\" or who had a \"constitutional psychopathic inferiority.\" A similar Public Health Service definition of homosexuals was used simultaneously by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to reinforce the language of the Immigration Act of 1917 and effectively ban all homosexual immigrants who disclosed their sexual minority status. On February 5, 1917, the Congress overrode Wilson's veto, implementing the Immigration Act of 1917 into law.[368]\n\nOn March 1, 1917, the Articles of War of 1916 are implemented. This included a revision of the Articles of War of 1806, the new regulations detail statutes governing U.S. military discipline and justice. Under the category Miscellaneous Crimes and Offences, Article 93 states that any person subject to military law who commits \"assault with intent to commit sodomy\" shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.[369]\n\nOn June 4, 1920, Congress modified Article 93 of the Articles of War of 1916. It was changed to make the act of sodomy itself a crime, separate from the offense of assault with intent to commit sodomy.[369] It went into effect on February 4, 1921.[370]\n\nFranklin Roosevelt\n\n[edit]\n\nAssistant Secretary of the Navy\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1919, Democratic Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt requested an investigation into \"vice and depravity\" in the sea services after a sting operation in which undercover operatives attempt to seduce sailors suspected of being homosexual had already begun at the Naval base in Newport, Rhode Island. At least 17 sailors were jailed and court-martialed before public outcry prompted a Republican-led Senate committee to condemn the methods of the operation. Roosevelt denied he had any knowledge that entrapment had been used or that he would have approved of it.[371]\n\nPresidency\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1935, Congress passed a law for the District of Columbia that made it a crime for \"any person to invite, entice, persuade, or to address for the purpose of inviting, enticing, or persuading any person or persons...to accompany, to go with, to follow him or her to his or her residence, or to any other house or building, inclosure, or other place, for the purpose of prostitution, or any other immoral or lewd purpose.\" It imposed a fine of up to $100, up to 90 days in jail, and courts were permitted to \"impose conditions\" on anyone convicted under this law, including \"medical and mental examination, diagnosis and treatment by proper public health and welfare authorities, and such other terms and conditions as the court may deem best for the protection of the community and the punishment, control, and rehabilitation of the defendant.\" The law went into effect on August 14, 1935.[364]\n\nIn 1941, Congress enacted a new solicitation law for the District of Columbia that labeled a \"vagrant\" any person who \"engages in or commits acts of fornication or perversion for hire.\" The law went into effect on December 17, 1941.[364]\n\nHarry Truman\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1948, Congress enacted the first sodomy law in the District of Columbia, which established a penalty of up to 10 years in prison or a fine of up to $1,000 for sodomy. Also included with this sodomy law was a psychopathic offender law and a law \"to provide for the treatment of sexual psychopaths in the District of Columbia, and for other purposes.\" The law went into effect on June 9, 1948.[364]\n\nOn May 5, 1950, the Uniform Code of Military Justice was passed by Congress and was signed into law by President Harry S. Truman, and became effective on May 31, 1951. Article 125 forbids sodomy among all military personnel, defining it as \"any person subject to this chapter who engages in unnatural carnal copulation with another person of the same or opposite sex or with an animal is guilty of sodomy. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete the offence.\"[369]\n\nOn June 25, 1952, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 was vetoed by President Truman because he regarded the bill as \"un-American\" and discriminatory. The bill prohibits \"aliens afflicted with a psychopathic personality, epilepsy, or a mental defect\" from entry into the United States.[372][373][374] Congress would later override his veto and implemented the act into law.[368]\n\nDwight D. Eisenhower\n\n[edit]\n\nOn April 27, 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed Executive Order 10450 which prohibits Federal employees from being members of a group or organization considered subversive. The order lists \"sexual perversion\" as a security risk constituting grounds for termination or denial of employment. The order went into effect on May 27, 1953.[369]\n\nWithout explicitly referring to homosexuality, the executive order responded to several years of charges that the presence of homosexual employees in the State Department posed blackmail risks. Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr. explained that the new order was designed to encompass both loyalty and security risks and he differentiated between the two: \"Employees could be a security risk and still not be disloyal or have any traitorous thoughts, but it may be that their personal habits are such that they might be subject to blackmail by people who seek to destroy the safety of our country.\"[375]\n\nThe press recognized the revolutionary nature of the new executive order. The Washington Post said that it established not a loyalty test but a \"suitability test.\" Some in government referred to their new \"integrity-security\" program. Some of those the press expected to be excluded from federal employment included \"a person who drinks too much,\" \"an incorrigible gossip,\" \"homosexuals,\" and \"neurotics.\"[375]\n\nIn 1953, Congress changed the solicitation law in the District of Columbia so that the jail term of up to 90 days was retained, but the maximum fine was raised to $250, and the reference to the power of judges to \"impose conditions\" on the defendant was removed. The law went into effect on June 29, 1953.[364]\n\nLyndon B. Johnson\n\n[edit]\n\nSenator of Texas\n\n[edit]\n\nOn February 2, 1950, Senator Lyndon B. Johnson voted for Uniform Code of Military Justice.[376]\n\nPresidency\n\n[edit]\n\nOn October 19, 1964, Walter Jenkins, a longtime top aide to President Johnson, had been arrested by District of Columbia Police in a YMCA restroom. He and another man were booked on a disorderly conduct charge.[377]\n\nAfter becoming a controversy prior to the 1964 presidential election, the American Mental Health Foundation wrote a letter to President Johnson protesting the \"hysteria\" surrounding the case:[378]\n\nThe private life and inclinations of a citizen, Government employee or not, does not necessarily have any bearing on his capacities, usefulness, and sense of responsibility in his occupation. The fact that an individual is homosexual, as has been strongly implied in the case of Mr. Jenkins, does not per se make him more unstable and more a security risk than any heterosexual person.\n\nAfter reelection during his second term on October 3, 1965, Johnson signed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which added \"sexual deviation\" as a medical ground for denying prospective immigrants entry into the United States. The bill went into effect on June 30, 1968.[368]\n\nRichard Nixon\n\n[edit]\n\nPresidency\n\n[edit]\n\nIn August 1970, Richard Nixon, on the issue of same-sex marriage, said \"I can't go that far; that's the year 2000! Negroes and whites, okay. But that's too far!\"[382]\n\nIn 1972, San Francisco's Gay Activists Alliance disbanded and formed the Gay Voters League, a group that campaigned for the reelection of President Richard Nixon.[383] In October 1972, a representative of the Committee to Re-elect the President addressed gay voters on behalf of Nixon's campaign in San Francisco. The event was organized by the Gay Voters League of San Francisco.[384]\n\nGerald Ford\n\n[edit]\n\nHouse Minority Leader\n\n[edit]\n\nOn August 25, 1965, Rep. Gerald Ford voted for the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965.[385]\n\nPresidency\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 5, 1976, when asked about the issue of gay rights, with respect to hiring, employment, and housing, Gerald Ford said \"I recognize that this is a very new and serious problem in our society. I have always tried to be an understanding person as far as people are concerned who are different than myself. That doesn't mean that I agree with or would concur in what is done by them or their position in society. I think this is a problem we have to face up to, and I can't give you a pat answer tonight. I just would be dishonest to say that there is a pat answer under these very difficult circumstances\".[386]\n\nIn 1976, during that year's presidential campaign, President Gerald Ford was \"zapped\" by activists in Ann Arbor, Michigan over federal immigration rules. The protests forced President Ford to admit that he was not aware that homosexuality was used as a basis for exclusion in immigration rulings.[383]\n\nPost presidency\n\n[edit]\n\nGerald Ford, as former president, formally opposed the Briggs Initiative in 1977, which sought to ban homosexuals from teaching in public school. In October 2001, he broke with conservative members of the Republican Party by stating that gay and lesbian couples \"ought to be treated equally. Period.\" He became the highest ranking Republican to embrace full equality for gays and lesbians, stating his belief that there should be a federal amendment outlawing anti-gay job discrimination and expressing his hope that the Republican Party would reach out to gay and lesbian voters.[387] He also was a member of the Republican Unity Coalition, which The New York Times described as \"a group of prominent Republicans, including former President Gerald R. Ford, dedicated to making sexual orientation a non-issue in the Republican Party\".[388]\n\nJimmy Carter\n\n[edit]\n\nPost governorship of Georgia\n\n[edit]\n\nIn February 1976, Carter said he opposed discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, but in June 1976 he withdrew his support of a gay rights plank in the Democratic Party platform.[389]\n\nPresidency\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1977, under the guidance of Jimmy Carter, a policy was removed which barred employment of gays in the foreign service and Internal Revenue Service. That same year, fourteen gay and lesbian activists were invited to the White House for the first official visit ever. Jimmy Carter publicly opposed the Briggs Initiative. However, in March 1980, Carter issued a formal statement indicating he would not issue an executive order banning anti-gay discrimination in the U.S. federal government and that he would not support including a gay rights plank in the Democratic Party platform.[389][390] In September 1980, the United States Department of Justice announced that immigration officials would no longer be allowed to ask whether an individual entering the United States was gay and therefore ineligible for admission.[391] An individual would only be denied admission into the United States if the traveler self-identified as gay to the immigration official.[391]\n\nPost presidency\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2004, Carter came out for civil unions and stated that he \"opposes all forms of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and believes there should be equal protection under the law for people who differ in sexual orientation\".[392] In 2007, he called for ending the ban on gays in the military.[393] In March 2012, Jimmy Carter came out in favor of same sex marriage.[394]\n\nRonald Reagan\n\n[edit]\n\nPost governorship of California\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first chapter of what would become the national Log Cabin Republicans (LCR) formed in 1978 to fight California's Briggs Initiative, a ballot initiative that would have banned homosexuals from teaching in public schools. The chapter worked diligently and successfully convinced Governor Reagan to publicly oppose the measure.[383] Reagan penned an op-ed against the Briggs Initiative in which he wrote, \"Whatever else it is, homosexuality is not a contagious disease like the measles. Prevailing scientific opinion is that an individual's sexuality is determined at a very early age and that a child's teachers do not really influence this.\"[395]\n\nPresidency\n\n[edit]\n\nOn the 1980 campaign trail, he spoke of the gay civil rights movement:\n\nMy criticism is that [the gay movement] isn't just asking for civil rights; it's asking for recognition and acceptance of an alternative lifestyle which I do not believe society can condone, nor can I.[396]\n\nNo civil rights legislation for LGBT individuals passed during Reagan's tenure. Additionally, Reagan has been criticized for ignoring (by failing to adequately address or fund) the growing AIDS epidemic, even as it took thousands of lives in the 1980s. Reagan's Surgeon General from 1982 to 1989, Dr. C. Everett Koop, claims that his attempts to address the issue were shut out by the Reagan administration. According to Koop, the prevailing view of the Reagan administration was that \"transmission of AIDS was understood to be primarily in the homosexual population and in those who abused intravenous drugs\" and therefore that people dying from AIDS were \"only getting what they justly deserve.\"[397]\n\nOn August 18, 1984, President Reagan issued a statement on the issue of same-sex marriage that read:\n\nSociety has always regarded marital love as a sacred expression of the bond between a man and a woman. It is the means by which families are created and society itself is extended into the future. In the Judeo-Christian tradition it is the means by which husband and wife participate with God in the creation of a new human life. It is for these reasons, among others, that our society has always sought to protect this unique relationship. In part the erosion of these values has given way to a celebration of forms of expression most reject. We will resist the efforts of some to obtain government endorsement of homosexuality.\n\nReagan made the comment in response to a questionnaire from the conservative publishers of the Presidential Biblical Scoreboard, a magazine-type compilation of past statements and voting records of national candidates.[398]\n\nGeorge H. W. Bush\n\n[edit]\n\nVice presidency\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1988, the Republican Party's nominee, Vice President George H. W. Bush, endorsed a plan to protect persons with AIDS from discrimination.[383]\n\nPresidency\n\n[edit]\n\nAs President, George H. W. Bush signed legislation that extended gay rights. On April 23, 1990, George H. W. Bush signed the Hate Crime Statistics Act, which requires the Attorney General to collect data on crimes committed because of the victim's race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity. It was the first federal statute to \"recognize and name gay, lesbian and bisexual people.\"[399] On July 26, 1990, George H. W. Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. On November 29, 1990, Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990, which withdrew the phrase \"sexual deviation\" from the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) so that it could no longer be used as a basis for barring entry of immigration to the U.S. for homosexuals.[383]\n\nIn a television interview, Bush said if he found out his grandchild was gay, he would \"love his child\", but tell him homosexuality was not normal and discourage him from working for gay rights. In February 1992, the chairman of the Bush-Quayle campaign met with the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.[389] In May 1992, he appointed Anne-Imelda Radice to serve as the Acting Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts.[400] Losing ground in the 1992 Republican president primary to President Bush's far-right challenger, Pat Buchanan, the Bush campaign turned to the right, and President Bush publicly denounced same-sex marriage.[401]\n\nThe 1992 Log Cabin Republican convention was held in Spring, Texas, a Houston exurb. The main issue discussed was whether or not LCR would endorse the re-election of President George H. W. Bush. The group voted to deny that endorsement because Bush did not denounce anti-gay rhetoric at the 1992 Republican National Convention.[402] Many in the gay community believed President Bush had not done enough on the issue of AIDS. Urvashi Vaid argues that Bush's anti-gay rhetoric \"motivated conservative gay Democrats and loyal gay Republicans, who had helped defeat Dukakis in 1988, to throw their support behind Clinton.\"[389]\n\nIn 1992, the Council of the District of Columbia passed the \"Health Benefits Expansion Act\", which was signed into law by the Mayor of Washington, D.C. The bill, which established domestic partnerships in the District of Columbia, became law on June 11, 1992. Every year from 1992 to 2000, the Republican leadership of the U.S. Congress added a rider to the District of Columbia appropriations bill that prohibited the use of federal or local funds to implement the Health Care Benefits Expansion Act.[403] On October 5, 1992, Bush signed the H.R. 6056 into law, which included the Republican rider to the appropriations bill.[404]\n\nPost presidency\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2013, former President George H. W. Bush served as a witness at a same-sex wedding of Bonnie Clement and Helen Thorgalsen, who own a general store together in Maine.[405] In 2015 The Boston Globe reported that Bush \"offered to perform the ceremony but had a scheduling conflict.\"[406]\n\nBill Clinton\n\n[edit]\n\nGovernorship of Arkansas\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1992, Governor Bill Clinton, as a candidate for president, issued a public statement of support for repeal of Arkansas's sodomy law.[407] Also in 1992, the Human Rights Campaign, America's largest LGBT rights organization, issued its first presidential endorsement in 1992 to Bill Clinton.[408]\n\nPresidency\n\n[edit]\n\nBill Clinton's legacy on gay rights is a matter of controversy. LGBT rights activist Richard Socarides credits Clinton as the first president to publicly champion gay rights,[408] but Clinton's signing of DOMA and DADT have led critics like Andrew Sullivan to argue Clinton was a detriment to rather than an ally for the LGBT rights movement, though DOMA passed Congress with veto-proof majorit"
