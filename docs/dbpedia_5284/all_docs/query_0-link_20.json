All known children born in Mississippi.)\n\n4 Sources\n\nBiography\n\nWilliam A. W. Nunn was born around 1828 to 1829 in Georgia, per data in the 1850 through 1870 censi. Since his parents, Francis Nunn and Clementine Gaulding, were in Talbot County Georgia at the time, it is presumed he was born there. He was probably named after his paternal grandfather, William Nunn. The middle initials are provided by the 1850 census and the middle letter \"A\" is repeated in the 1870 census. It is unknown what William's middle name was, but the \"A\" may have stood for Archibald, after a prominent maternal uncle Archibald A. Gaulding.\n\nWilliam had two brothers, Samuel and John G, who married two daughters of Levi and Hixcy (Lewis) Pruitt. Since the Pruitts also had a daughter Amanda, it was speculated that William probably married her. Later, I discovered that another man was proposed as Amanda Pruitt's husband with no certain proof. Both theories had pluses and minuses. Trying to find an alternate Amanda for William's wife, I researched all Amandas shown in censi for the counties William was known to frequent at the time of his marriage and also all adjacent counties. I found no compelling evidence that could support any of them as his wife. For now, we consider his wife's maiden name unknown, but consider Amanda Pruitt (aka Prewitt etc) a likely candidate.\n\nDuring the Civil War, William served in Company F of the 29th Mississippi Infantry (Confederate). His company was also known as the \"Hampton Guards\" and was raised primarily in Lowndes County, Mississippi, but William enrolled in 1862 at the age of 34, in the small town of Pittsboro in Central Calhoun County, Mississippi. William's unit was initially stationed in Mississippi and in late May 1862 was involved in the defense of Corinth. By the end of July, the 29th was transferred to Chattanooga and afterward was involved in numerous battles in Tennessee and Kentucky, including Murfreesboro and the great battle of Chickamauga. The 29th, like many Confederate units, was so decimated by casualties in those battles that it was later combined with other units\n\nIn the 1870 Yalobusha County, Mississippi Census, William and his wife, Amanda, are shown with six children in their household and Amanda aged 35 years was still of child bearing age. In the 1880 Van Buren County, Arkansas Census, William and four of those children, plus any born after the 1870 census, were gone. It's unknown what happened to all those missing family members, but it is know that a Yellow Fever epidemic ravished Mississippi, and surrounding states, in 1878 and hit Water District of Yalobusha particularly hard. Some of the many deaths in the district were recorded, but no Nunns were in the partial list of deceased.\n\nWe don't know when the Nunns migrated to Arkansas and don't know if William accompanied Amanda, or she traveled as a widow with extended family. However, after the 1880 census, she and one of her remaining daughters, Sarah A. aged 14, disappeared from public record.\n\nThe remaining daughter, Martha \"Mattie\" Nunn, married her next door neighbor A.D. Hunt, who at the time of the census had just lost his first wife in childbirth and had two new born baby boys and two young daughters, aged 3 and 5, to raise. Two weeks after the census the baby boys died. Within the next couple of years Hunt and one daughter from his first family would die, but he'd have a daughter with Mattie Nunn named Roxanne Elizabeth \"Lizzie\" Hunt. All of William and Amanda Hunt's issue who have tested their autosomal dna on AncestryDNA or FTDNA appear to be issue of that granddaughter, \"Lizzie\" (Hunt) Pinson.\n\nResearch Notes\n\n12/10/22: more data and sources to be added later.\n\nChildren (from census data. All known children born in Mississippi.)\n\n1) Mary born c 1856-57. (Mary in 1860, inverted with Martha in 1870)\n\n2) Elizabeth born c. 1858. (listed as Clara in the 1870 census, Elizabeth in 1860)\n\n3) Martha E. \"Mattie\" (Nunn) Hunt born c 1860. (listed as Mary in the 1870 census, but correctly as Martha in 1880).\n\n4) Fannie G. born c 1862.\n\n5) James W. born c 1862.\n\n6) Sarah A. born c 1866-67.\n\nOthers may have been born between the 1870 and 1880 censi.\n\nSources\n\n1850 U.S. Census for Chickasaw County Mississippi.
