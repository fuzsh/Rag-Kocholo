        "text": "What drew you to the law?\n\nIn its earliest form, my interest in law arose out of my longstanding passion for math – and the framework of logical reasoning both systems demanded. Later, as I observed first-hand the attempt to build new democratic societies out of the rubble of the Soviet Union, I was struck by how the corruption of law over decades made accomplishing that goal impossibly difficult.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about teaching?\n\nEverything. As a professor, I think of my “job” as advancing human knowledge. That work takes various critical forms, but there is none more immediately gratifying than when I am engaged in what I think of as teaching the next generation of lawyers and leaders. Perhaps especially when you’re teaching a complex or thorny issue of one sort or another, there is a joy in watching students “get it” – in watching as the lights go on – that no potential hobby could beat!\n\nWhat do you hope students gain from your courses?\n\nThe life of the law is a fast-paced one. The law we learn today is likely to be gone before we know it. Technology, meanwhile, can tell us “the law” – in the sense of what’s on the books – faster and more accurately than anyone. My primary goal for my students, thus, is that I have made them better analysts and advocates of both what the law is and what it should be. That they know how to engage the law – whatever it is – and how to shape it, both in the service of their clients and in the advancement of justice.\n\nWhat did you do prior to entering academia?\n\nI was a law clerk and a litigator. I was honored to serve as a clerk to Judge James R. Browning of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit – from whom I learned (among other things) what it means to be a fair and dispassionate judge of the law. Following that, I was a trial attorney in the Civil Division of the U.S. Department of Justice – an opportunity to serve my country that I will always cherish.\n\nWhat are you passionate about outside of the law?\n\nMy family, of course. My wife and children keep me young, and give me a better reason than I could ever ask for, for wanting to make the world a better place. I also am deeply interested in how our educational system – at all levels – can do a better job of fostering opportunity for all. And likewise in how our communities can best advance equality – between women and men, for underrepresented minorities, and otherwise.\n\nWhat are your research interests?\n\nIn the broadest terms, my scholarly work explores issues of regulatory design. Traditionally, scholars of administrative law and regulation have focused primary attention on normative questions of procedural legitimacy and accountability, as well as questions regarding the efficacy, wisdom, and costs/benefits of regulation. Far more limited attention has been paid to exploring the optimal form and nature of law and regulation – the questions of regulatory design that stand at the heart of my own work."
