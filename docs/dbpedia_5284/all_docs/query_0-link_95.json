        "text": "A comprehensive guide to the best sitcoms on Netflix.\n\nNetflix’s lineup of sitcoms is an ever-changing thing. Over the last few years former stalwarts like Schitt’s Creek and The Office have decamped to other streamers that outbid the original, while Seinfeld jumped to Netflix after a long run elsewhere. Last year they lost one of the bigger sitcoms of the last decade, The New Girl, after having the streaming rights for 10 years, and almost said goodbye to Arrested Development even though that show’s last two seasons are exclusive to Netflix. But they’ve recently added Brooklyn Nine-Nine and revived Peacock’s cancelled-too-soon fave Girls5Eva, so the cosmic ballet of Netflix’s sitcom selection goes on.\n\nFortunately there are a few dozen other sitcoms on Netflix also worth watching, from old network hits, to originals that are unique to Netflix. From The Mindy Project, The Good Place, and Insecure, to Grace and Frankie, BoJack Horseman, and the One Day at a Time revival, Netflix has your sitcom needs covered. Here are our picks for the best of the bunch.\n\n34. That ‘90s Show\n\nOriginal Run: 2023-\n\nDeveloped By: Bonnie Turner, Terry Turner, Lindsey Turner, Gregg Mettler\n\nStars: Debra Jo Rupp, Kurtwood Smith, Callie Haverda, Ashley Aufderheide, Mace Coronel, Reyn Doi, Sam Morelos, Maxwell Acee Donovan\n\nOriginal network: Netflix\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nThe most important question remains: is it fun? It is, and it will certainly appeal to fans of That ‘70s Show. The original was never a masterpiece, and That ‘90s Show isn’t either, but they’re both entertaining. That ‘90s Show did just enough to let us drop back into this world for a summer of fun, and here’s hoping there’s another summer or two to come down the line.—Trent Moore\n\n33. Lovesick\n\nOriginal Run: 2014-2021\n\nCreator: Tom Edge\n\nStars: Johnny Flynn, Antonia Thomas, Daniel Ings, Joshua McGuire\n\nOriginal Network: Channel 4; Netflix (seasons 2 and 3)\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nLovesick thrives on gawkily funny and often sexually charged situations, handled in such a down-to-earth manner it doesn’t feel like your typical, canned-laughter comedy. Instead of being overly in-your-face with punchlines, the series relies on its well-defined protagonists for humor, and by introducing new characters and environments in every episode, Lovesick feels more elaborate than your average sitcom, allowing for the occasional surprise (see the episodes “Abigail” and “Phoebe”). By spanning the protagonists’ storylines over a period of seven years, we get to know the people and circumstances that shaped them into who they are at present. We witness various fashion trends and phases in their lives, personal issues and career triumphs, forging a bond with the characters that carries into their current situations.—Roxanne Sancto\n\n32. Great News\n\nOriginal Run: 2017-2018\n\nCreator: Tracey Wigfield\n\nStars: Briga Heelen, Andrea Martin, Adam Campbell, Nicole Richie, Horatio Sanz, John Michael Higgins\n\nOriginal network: NBC\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nI’ve come to the point in my career where I’m the lady shaking my fist and screaming, “Network TV is still good! It’s still good!” And while I’ll be the first to admit that network TV provides us with a lot of duds, you can often find a diamond in among the lumps of coal. Great News, from executive producer Tina Fey, debuted to little fanfare. But as the second season progressed, the story of cable news producer Katie (Briga Heelan) and her ragtag news team (which includes the incomparable Andrea Martin as her mother and the hilarious John Michael Higgins as her bombastic news anchor, Chuck) becomes a savvy and at times scathing comedy, covering everything from sexual harassment in the workplace to the pressures of social media. Oh, and did I mention that Nicole Richie is funny as cable news host Portia? I mean really, really funny.—Amy Amatangelo\n\n31. Santa Clarita Diet\n\nOriginal Run: 2017-2019\n\nCreator: Victor Fresco\n\nStars: Drew Barrymore, Timothy Olyphant, Liv Hewson, Skyler Gisondo\n\nOriginal Network: Netflix\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nNetflix’s horror-comedy follows normal couple Sheila (Drew Barrymore) and Joel (Timothy Olyphant), a real estate duo attempting to raise their daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) right. The neighborhood is good, problems are at a minimum, and the middle-class living is all the American Dream promised. Until Sheila hacks up a mysterious orb and starts hungering for human flesh, that is. Freckly neighbor kid Eric (Skyler Gisondo) has been roped into the scheme, too. Together, they put the “dead” in “deadpan.” Sheila’s fundead chipperness recalls Crazy Ex-Girlfriend’s method of surrounding its dark, psychologically- or physically-upsetting narrative turns with hyper-sunny aesthetics, saturating each shot with catalogue color even when the gore flies. It’s as if the traffic-discussing members of the Saturday Night Live skit “The Californians” were in a Saw movie. —Jacob Oller\n\n30. F Is For Family\n\nOriginal Run: 2015-2021\n\nCreator: Bill Burr, Michael Price\n\nStars: Bill Burr, Laura Dern, Justin Long, Debi Derryberry, Sam Rockwell\n\nOriginal Network: Netflix\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nLike the more celebrated BoJack Horseman, this animated Netflix original mines surprisingly stark and moving drama from its bitter comedy. Starring popular stand-up Bill Burr, F Is For Family is a jaundiced look at a broken family during the height of the 1970s malaise, but, y’know, funny, at least some of the time.—Garrett Martin\n\n29. Love\n\nOriginal Run: 2016-2018\n\nCreators: Judd Apatow, Lesley Arfin, Paul Rust\n\nStars: Gillian Jacobs, Paul Rust, Claudia O’Doherty\n\nOriginal Network: Netflix\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nIf you’re a fan of Undeclared or Freaks and Geeks, you should make it your business to give Judd Apatow’s latest series, Love, a try. In a lot of ways, it feels like what would happen if Sam Weir and Kim Kelly wound up dating in their 30s—we meet Gus (Paul Rust), a dorky on-set tutor for the child star of a witch-themed teen drama, and Mickey (Gillian Jacobs), a radio producer struggling with her sobriety, as they’re both reeling from tough breakups and watch as they fall for each other. Like anything Apatow’s got his name on, there’s an underlying sweetness here and an incredibly strong cast (Claudia O’Doherty steals pretty much every scene she’s in as Mickey’s roommate, Bertie), and the addiction plot lends some dramatic muscle. The characters are complicated (and not always likable), but hey, so is love.—Bonnie Stiernberg\n\n28. Norsemen\n\nOriginal Run: 2016-2020\n\nCreator: Jon Iver Helgaker, Jonas Torgersen\n\nStars: Kåre Conradi, Nils Jørgen Kaalstad, Trond Fausa Aurvåg, Silje Torp\n\nOriginal Network: NRK1; Netflix\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nThis Norwegian comedy has slipped under the radar a bit in the States, but with a third season on the way this week its audience will hopefully continue to grow. It’s a dirty, irreverent, hilarious sitcom set in 8th century Norway, focusing on the daily foibles of a stereotypical clan of Vikings while also serving as a send-up of deadly serious blood ‘n guts period TV like Game of Thrones. And if you don’t feel like reading subtitles, don’t worry: they actually shoot every episode in both Norwegian and English, so you can watch it without having to read it.—Garrett Martin\n\n27. Master of None\n\nOriginal Run: 2015-2021\n\nCreator: Aziz Ansari, Alan Yang\n\nStars: Aziz Ansari, Noél Wells, Eric Wareheim, Lena Waithe, Kelvin Yu, H. Jon Benjamin\n\nOriginal Network: Netflix\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nLike its creator and star, Master of None is stylish, smart and clever—a half-hour comedy that ranks as one of Netflix’s best efforts in original programming. Following the trend set by Louie, Transparent, You’re the Worst and many other modern sitcoms, Aziz Ansari and Alan Yang built a show that doesn’t mind the occasional laugh hiatus. Instead of pushing the joke quota to astronomical levels, Master of None is content to find poignancy amid the humor, and if the former outshines the latter, so be it. The result is a show that is fun to watch, emotionally satisfying and thought provoking. It’s also been paramount in furthering the discussion about race and representation on television, both with its own casting and the topics it addresses. There is so much to say about this show, and these few hundred words are a pathetic attempt to do it justice. Master of None is one of the most important shows in a long, long time. Eric Walters\n\n26. Kim’s Convenience\n\nOriginal Run: 2016-2021\n\nCreators: Ins Choi, Kevin White\n\nStars:Paul Sun-Hyung Lee, Jean Yoon, Andrea Bang, Simu Liu, Andrew Phung, Nicole Power\n\nOriginal Network: CBC\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nCanadian Broadcasting Corporation’s hit sitcom Kim’s Convenience is in it’s fourth season and has already been renewed for two more. The episodic show centers a Korean family that runs a convenience store in the Moss Park neighborhood of Toronto. The dynamic between the family’s goofily brash patriarch, Mr. Sang il-Kim (Paul Sun-Hyung Lee), the religious, meddling matriarch Mrs. Yong mi-Kim (Jean Yoon), their newly straight laced son Jung (Simu Liu) and artist daughter Janet (Andrea Bang) results in a bevy of humorous domestic squabbles. The show shines not only because it, like other ensemble family centric shows (Arrested Development anyone?), captures the discomforts that naturally arise with loved ones but because it is steeped in the nuances of a Korean-Canadian family’s quotidian life.—Adesola Thomas\n\n25. She’s Gotta Have It\n\nOriginal Run: 2017-2019\n\nCreators: Spike Lee\n\nStars:DeWanda Wise, Anthony Ramos, Lyriq Bent, Cleo Anthony, Margot Bingham, Chyna Layne, De’Adre Aziza\n\nOriginal Network: Netflix\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nShe’s Gotta Have It may not be the revolution it was in 1986, but Spike Lee’s serial remake of his own first feature is more refined in almost every way, while kicking the formal bravado into overdrive. There’s a ten-minute vigil mourning Donald Trump’s election. There’s Requiem for a Dream-like butt injections. There’s a full-on dance sequence to “Raspberry Beret.” Its lead is smarter, braver, and more complex than ever while tackling social threats with infectious energy and relatable vulnerability. If this doesn’t more than make up for a first-timer’s misjudged scene, I don’t know what does. Doing it again may be a rarity, but when Lee does it this well, I’d be happy for that to change. —Jacob Oller\n\n24. Tuca & Bertie\n\nOriginal Run: 2019\n\nCreator: Lisa Hanawalt\n\nStars: Tiffany Haddish, Ali Wong, Steven Yeun\n\nOriginal Network: Netflix\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nDon’t let the similar art fool you: Lisa Hanawalt’s Tuca & Bertie doesn’t have much else in common with Bojack Horseman. (I mean, that’s just the way Hanawalt draws.) Netflix’s new cartoon looks at the stresses and joys of being a woman today, from lack of respect in the workplace to balancing romance with friendships, but in an absurd reflection of our real world full of talking humanoid animals. Tiffany Haddish and Ali Wong voice the adventurous toucan and repressed songbird of the title, respectively, and between their great performances and the nuanced writing of Hanawalt and her team, Tuca & Bertie reveals a keen understanding of life without struggling to seem profound. Also it’s packed so full of sight gags and background jokes that you’ll probably keep your finger on the rewind button the whole time. —Garrett Martin\n\n23. American Vandal\n\nOriginal Run: 2017-2018\n\nCreated by: Tony Yacenda and Dan Perrault\n\nStars: Tyler Alvarez, Griffin Gluck, Jimmy Tatro\n\nOriginal Network: Netflix\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nAmerican Vandal is the tongue-in-cheek antidote to the “true crime” craze: a “prestige docuseries” on the subject of dick-drawing, set on dismantling the form from within. After all, its understanding of the form is impeccable: With dramatic cold opens, floated theories and test cases; interviews, illustrations and re-creations; careful cliffhangers and a Jinx-style hot mic, it applies the genre’s commonplaces to absurd situations with aplomb. It’s a pungently goofy reminder that the history of “true crime” is dominated by “lowbrow” media—pulpy magazines, grocery-store paperbacks, salacious installments of Dateline or 20/20—and that its newfound sense of “prestige” is primarily a function of style. Still, American Vandal’s most surprising strength is not its satire but its steady construction of a narrative backdrop even more compelling than its creators realize. Call it Fast Times at Hanover High: The series’ amusing slice of schoolyard life. —Matt Brennan\n\n22. The Mindy Project\n\nOriginal Run: 2012-2017\n\nCreator: Mindy Kaling\n\nStars: Mindy Kaling, Chris Messina, Ed Weeks, Ike Barinholtz, Beth Grant, Xosha Roquemore, Adam Pally, Garret Dillahunt, Fortune Feimster\n\nOriginal Network: Fox (2012-2015); Hulu (2015-2017)\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nAs anyone who’s sat through the second or third Bridget Jones movies can attest, not that much interesting stuff happens after the couple you’ve been rooting for in the romantic comedy finally get together. Then again, most female romantic leads aren’t Mindy Lahiri. Creator and star Mindy Kaling’s impressively dressed, self-centered OB/GYN is a walking master class in relationship failure. Although she’s had some strong hits along the way (the show’s will they/won’t they build-up with co-star Chris Messina’s Danny, for example), Mindy is most fun for viewers when she’s single and on the prowl. But all the vapid pop culture references—“There’s a sequel to the Bible and not to Gone Girl?” is a personal favorite—meet-cutes and elevator sex are really just sugar coating. Where The Mindy Project really excels is in its conversations about feminism, single parenting, and whether a woman truly can have it all. Whitney Friedlander\n\n21. Dear White People\n\nOriginal Run: 2017-2021\n\nCreator: Justin Simien\n\nStars:: Logan Browning, Brandon P. Bell, DeRon Horton, Antoinette Robertson, John Patrick Amedori, Ashley Blaine Featherson, Giancarlo Esposito\n\nNetwork: Netflix\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nBased on creator Justin Simien’s 2014 indie, Netflix’s original series—narrated by Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul’s Giancarlo Esposito—replicates the pungent humor of the film without ever seeming stale, or static: Its knives are sharp, and they’re pointed in every direction. Though its primary target is white privilege, in forms both egregious (blackface parties) and mundane (calls to end “divisive” politics), Dear White People, set on the campus of a fictional Ivy League university, is even funnier when it turns to the details of the black students’ personal and ideological choices, transforming the notion of the “problematic fave,” from the McRib to The Cosby Show into the engine of its entertaining, incisive comedy.—Matt Brennan\n\n20. Derry Girls\n\nOriginal run: 2018-2022\n\nCreated by: Adam Lee\n\nStars: Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Louisa Harland, Nicola Coughlan, Jamie-Lee O’Donnell, Dylan Llewellyn\n\nOriginal Network: Channel 4\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nThe lovely, silly, funny and emotional Derry Girls is just the craic we need. The brief series (each season only runs six episodes) focuses on a group of schoolgirls in Northern Ireland in the ‘90s, during the last days of the Troubles. But in Lisa McGee’s series, that darkness is relegated to the background. Instead, the more traditional teen conflicts of school life and being boy crazy take center stage, along with lots of incredibly specific language and jokes about both that region and that time (you will definitely want to watch with subtitles on). Derry Girls is a warm and funny time hop carried by a dreamy ‘90s playlist and the gigantic charisma of its wee leads. —Allison Keene\n\n19. Sex Education\n\nOriginal run:2019-\n\nCreated by: Laurie Nunn\n\nStars: Asa Butterfield, Gillian Anderson, Ncuti Gatwa, Emma Mackey, Connor Swindells\n\nOriginal Network: Netflix\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nYou’re an insecure, bright, sensitive teenage boy (Asa Butterfield) with a wildly uninhibited sex-guru mother (Gillian Anderson), an absentee dad (the epically hilarious James Purefoy), a chronically foot-in-mouth bully-magnet best friend, a limited social life and a clinically interesting fear of your own penis. You have a stealth crush on your school’s official Way Too Precocious girl, who’s hard up for money. So, naturally, you open a sex clinic for high-school students in an out-of-service school lavatory, right?\n\nOf course you do.\n\nNetflix’s Sex Education is a decidedly raunchy and thoroughly adorable coming-of-age dramedy. While it’s not exactly afraid of well-worn tropes, it also doesn’t rely on them to a detrimental degree… and it has Gillian Anderson as a sex therapist, which would be enough for a lot of us even if nothing else about the show worked. Luckily, that isn’t the case: A testament to the power of character development, the series is riveting. None of its superbly crafted characters waste a single frame. —Amy Glynn\n\n18. Kath & Kim\n\nOriginal Run: 2002-2007\n\nCreated by: Jane Turner, Gina Riley\n\nStars: Jane Turner, Gina Riley, Magda Szubanski, Peter Rowsthorn, Glenn Robbins\n\nOriginal Network: ABC TV\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nKath & Kim is the apex of TV comedy. From beautifully poetic malapropisms to surreal character study, Kath & Kim defined an entire generation of Australian TV and created innumerable phrases now endemic to Australian lingo (“Throw your handbag in a river” is now forever synonymous with “lesbian” on the continent). Seriously, it’s the “Torn” of TV, breaking several ratings records across its four seasons, spurning two films and an incredibly bad American spin-off starring Selma Blair and Molly Shannon. Jane Turner and Gina Riley are masters of comedy, and they deserve credit for creating one of the most enduringly great sitcoms in history. It’s nice. It’s different. It’s unusual. —Austin Jones\n\n17. Grace and Frankie\n\nOriginal Run: 2015-2022\n\nCreator: Marta Kauffman, Howard J. Morris\n\nStars: Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, Martin Sheen, Sam Waterston, Brooklyn Decker, Ethan Embry, June Diane Raphael, Baron Vaughn\n\nOriginal Network: Netflix\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nSometimes the only thing worse than a flat-out bad show is a woefully mediocre one that thoroughly squanders its vast potential. Indeed, despite its luminous cast, respected creative team (Marta J. Kaufman co-created Friends) and timely subject matter, Grace and Frankie never quite shakes the impression that it’s a broadcast comedy masquerading under a thick layer of “prestige half-hour” make-up. The story centers on the titular characters (Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin, respectively) who end up becoming roommates/reluctant friends after their husbands (Martin Sheen and Sam Waterston) announce they’ve been engaging in a long-term affair with one another and wish to dissolve their marriages to be together. Feeling tossed out to sea in the twilight of their lives, the two women attempt to rediscover life as newly single gals. Cue gags fueled by elder dating, elder sex and the ever-reliable, “elders try to use technology.” It’s essentially How Stella Got Her Groove Back for the septuagenarian sect. These creative shortcomings are all the more disappointing given the unmistakable chemistry between Fonda and Tomlin, not to mention that, as actresses of a certain age, Hollywood is not exactly bowling them over with the roles they deserve. Grace and Frankie is far from a bad show, but it has enough going for it that one wishes it was so much better. Mark Rozeman\n\n16. Big Mouth\n\nOriginal Run: 2017-\n\nCreators: Nick Kroll, Andrew Goldberg, Jennifer Flackett and Mark Levin\n\nStars:Nick Kroll, John Mulaney, Jessi Klein, Jason Mantzoukas, Maya Rudolph\n\nNetwork: Netflix\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nNetflix’s new animated series, from creators Nick Kroll, Andrew Goldberg, Jennifer Flackett and Mark Levin, follows four friends through the earliest stages of puberty: Andrew (John Mulaney) sports inconvenient erections; Nick (Kroll) awaits his first pubic hairs; Jessi (Jessi Klein) begins menstruating at the Statue of Liberty; Jay (Jason Mantzoukas) conceives rococo ways to get off with his pillow. It’s wickedly bawdy—one episode’s end credits roll over an extended description of Andrew’s dad’s testicles—and devilishly funny—another uses a note-perfect Seinfeld send-up to explain the blowjob “head push” and the term “mons pubis”—but as implied by its theme song, Charles Bradley’s “Changes,” the series is sweeter than it appears at first blush. Its goal is to cut through the humiliations of sex, to break through the shame shellacked atop our “gross little dirtbag” selves to reveal the perfectly normal yearning underneath: for pleasure, for touch, for emotional connection; for approval, confidence, intimacy, love. By admitting, as Andrew does in the series premiere, that “everything is so embarrassing”—and not only for teens—Big Mouth squares a space in which there’s no question that can’t be asked, and no answer that applies the same way to everyone. It’s the streaming version of your sex-ed teacher’s anonymous slips of paper, except the laughs aren’t sniggers—they’re hard-won, empathic guffaws. —Matt Brennan\n\n15. Never Have I Ever\n\nOriginal Run: 2020-2023\n\nCreated by: Mindy Kaling, Lang Fisher\n\nStars: Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, Poorna Jagannathan, Richa Moorjani, Jaren Lewison, John McEnroe\n\nOriginal Network: Netflix\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nBeing 15 sucks. You’re not sure who you are or what you’re doing or who you should be doing it with, but you’re 100% certain that everyone around you is always laser-focused on every embarrassing mistake that you make. Mindy Kaling’s new coming-of-age sitcom taps into the painful awkwardness of figuring it all out with the same mix of earnestness, realism and humor as Freaks and Geeks and The Wonder Years, but filtered through a cultural lens not often seen on American TV. Devi Vishwakumar isn’t just grappling with typical teenage drama, but is stuck between two cultures that she never quite feels like a full member of: the American life she was born and raised in, and the Indian heritage of her family. Maitreyi Ramakrishnan captures this anxiety and charm beautifully, that weird mix of constant shame and unearned confidence, in what is shockingly her first professional acting role. If you’re looking for a teen comedy that reflects the ups and downs of real life and is actually funny, here’s your chance. —Garrett Martin\n\n14. GLOW\n\nOriginal Run: 2017-2019\n\nCreators: Liz Flahive, Jenji Kohan and Carly Mensch\n\nStars: Alison Brie, Betty Gilpin, Sydelle Noel, Britney Young, Sunita Mani and Marc Maron\n\nOriginal Network: Netflix\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nMuch to my husband’s chagrin, I did not grow up watching wrestling on Saturday mornings. But just as I didn’t have to understand football to love Friday Night Lights, I don’t need to know what an atomic drop is to adore GLOW. A nearly unrecognizable Alison Brie (credit the ‘80s hair and eyebrows for her transformation) stars as Ruth Wilder, an aspiring actress who finds her perfect role in the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling. What she lacks in skill, Ruth makes up for in pluck. Her frenemy, former soap star Debbie Eagan (Betty Gilpin), becomes her perfect foil. Marc Maron is hilarious as their world-weary producer and Sydelle Noel is a stand out as stunt woman-turned-trainer Cherry Bang. Come for the ridiculous costumes, makeup and hair. Stay for the surprisingly poignant show about female empowerment. Amy Amatangelo\n\n13. Lady Dynamite\n\nOriginal Run: 2016-2017\n\nCreator: Pam Brady, Mitch Hurwitz\n\nStars: Maria Bamford, Fred Melamed, Mary Kay Place\n\nOriginal Network: Netflix\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nLady Dynamite’s opening episode is such a whirlwind of hyperactivity, even those viewers accustomed to Maria Bamford’s idiosyncratic brand of comedy may feel like they’ve overdosed on E numbers. But make it through the utterly exhausting pilot and you’ll be rewarded with one of the most weirdly wonderful sitcoms ever to grace the screen. Indeed, despite lurching wildly from showbusiness satire and surreal flights of fancy to painfully raw depictions of mental illness, Lady Dynamite‘s organized chaos soon becomes far more palatable and increasingly poignant. A game cast, including Fred Melamed as Maria’s strangely lovable but highly incompetent manager, Ana Gasteyer as her ghastly, no-nonsense agent, and former Supermen Dean Cain and Brandon Routh as her boyfriends past and present all add to the show’s random bizarre appeal. And if that hasn’t sold you, there’s also an adorable talking pug that sounds like Werner Herzog.—Jon O’Brien\n\n12. Trailer Park Boys\n\nOriginal Run: 2001-2008; 2014-\n\nCreator: Mike Clattenburg\n\nStars: John Paul Tremblay, Robb Wells, Mike Smith, John Dunsworth, Patrick Roach, Lucy DeCoutere, Sarah E. Dunsworth, Tyrone Parsons, Jonathan Torrens, Jeanne Harrison\n\nOriginal Network: Showcase, Netflix\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nAfter almost 20 years, Trailer Park Boys is an institution. For those completely unfamiliar with it, the show centers on the antics of Ricky and Julian, two idiot schemers, and their weird friend, Bubbles. The three live in a trailer park, where a whole bunch of other misfits, lunatics and drunks reside. Everyone fights and fucks up to laughter, the titular “boys” go to jail at the end of each season, and it all restarts once they’re released.\n\nThere are any number of things that can explain the enduring popularity of Trailer Park Boys. In a weed-friendly 21st century culture, its willingness to revel in the joys of pot smoking struck an early chord. There are the countless Rickyisms, puncta which enter the personal vocabularies of viewers. There’s the plain fact that faux drunk slapstick is always, always funny. And it’s got heart, clichéd as that is—the boys love the trailer park, their drunk nemesis Jim Lahey loves the trailer park, and so does everyone else there, even if nobody outside understands why.—Ian Williams\n\n11. Girls5eva\n\nOriginal Run: 2021-\n\nCreator: Meredith Scardino\n\nStars: Sara Bareilles, Busy Philipps, Paula Pell, Renée Elise Goldsberry\n\nOriginal Network: Peacock (2021-2022); Netflix (2024-)\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nMeredith Scardino’s series, which is also executive produced by Tina Fey and Robert Carlock—her bosses from Netflix’s Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt—focuses on the four remaining members of a one-hit wonder ‘90s girl pop group. Thrown together then by a lecherous and demoralizing manager, they had nothing in common, no autonomy over their talents or their bodies, and no idea what they were getting into. They sang songs entitled “Jailbait” and “Dream Girlfriends” (which included lyrics like “We’ve got the kind of birth control that goes in your arm. And tell me again why Tarantino’s a genius”). Now Wickie (Renée Elise Goldsberry), Dawn (Sara Bareilles), Summer (Busy Philipps), and Gloria (Paula Pell) have all but been forgotten by anyone beyond a bored Wikipedia editor—until a chance at a comeback has them taking a second look at where they’ve been and where they’re going.\n\nGirls5eva is a cautionary tale about the era of low-rider jeans and sateen “going out tops”; about a time when young girls were supposed to giggle when their boyfriends compared them to the women in Maxim magazine and didn’t flinch if their professors offered to buy them drinks after class. But it also has a special present for the Gen Xers, late Millennials, Xennials, and anyone else who groks with its commentary on aging and the frustration and rage one can feel over being ignored and underappreciated—especially the frustrations we have with ourselves for not being “better.”—Whitney Friedlander\n\n10. Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\n\nOriginal Run: 2015-2020\n\nCreator: Tina Fey, Robert Carlock\n\nStars: Ellie Kemper, Tituss Burgess, Jane Krakowski, Carol Kane\n\nOriginal Network: Netflix\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nNBC has made any number of mistakes over the years, but few bigger than shelving Tina Fey and Robert Carlock’s 30 Rock follow-up, before punting it over to Netflix. Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt wound up becoming one of the highlights of a great year for TV comedy. The fast-paced and flip sitcom featured breakout performances by Office vet Ellie Kemper as the titular former “mole woman” trying to make it on her own in New York, and Tituss Burgess as her flamboyant and put-upon roommate, Titus Andromedon. (NBC has recently tried to make it up to Kemper for dropping the ball on this by planting her in the guest host chair at Today—too little, too late, peacock peddlers.) Throughout the first season’s run, some writers and critics seemed dead set on finding some kind of flaw to pounce on with the show, zeroing in on how the minority characters are represented. This may be a wild generalization, but I think this was a natural reaction to one of the most overtly feminist sitcoms ever produced. Kimmy Schmidt is most certainly upsetting the natural order of your typical network sitcom. The show’s titular character is defining her life on her own terms and by her own standards. For some reason that still freaks some people out so they dismiss it or find some way to poke holes in the vehicle for that idea. That is what makes the prospect of a second season so exciting. Just as the show can go in a myriad of different directions, so too can Kimmy Schmidt. Now that she has put the awful time in the bunker to bed, she can face a new day with that infectious smile, bubbly attitude, and enthusiastic embrace of life experience. Sorry nitpickers and network executives; Kimmy Schmidt is going to make it after all. Robert Ham\n\n9. One Day at a Time\n\nOriginal Run: 2017-2020\n\nCreators: Gloria Calderon Kellett, Mike Royce,\n\nStars: Justina Machado, Todd Grinnell, Isabella Gómez, Marcel Ruiz, Stephen Tobolowsky, Rita Moreno\n\nOriginal Network: Netflix\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nI can’t remember a time I loved something the way I love the new One Day at a Time. Part of my affection stems from the fact that the show was such a discovery. It arrived January 6 of this year with almost no hype. I write about TV for a living and I barely knew it was premiering. Almost immediately I dismissed the show as yet another ill-advised remake. How wrong I was. The comedy is a pure delight. A throwback to the defining comedies of the 1970s with a modern twist, the show deftly tackles some hot-button issues including post-traumatic stress disorder, wage inequality and teenage sexuality amid real conversations about generational differences and Cuban heritage and traditions. Justina Machado (Six Feet Under) is fantastic as the recently separated veteran raising her two adolescent children with the help of her mother Lydia (living legend Rita Moreno) and her landlord Schneider (Todd Grinnell). Above all the show is funny and grounded. Once you start watching, you won’t be able to watch this gem one day at a time. Amy Amatangelo\n\n8. Martin\n\nOriginal Run: 1992-1997\n\nCreators: John Bowman, Martin Lawrence, Topper Carew\n\nStars: Martin Lawrence, Tisha Campbell, Carl Anthony Payne II, Thomas Mikal Ford, Tichina Arnold\n\nOriginal Network: Fox\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nA lot of people, Martin Lawrence included, probably thought this would be the peak of the former stand-up’s career in comedy, but they were simply unaware that he would one day make Big Momma’s House. Set in direct opposition to the dominance of NBC’s “Must See TV” block on Thursday nights, Martin became a counterbalance, a story set in urban Detroit with a largely black cast. A bit of a blowhard and a paper tiger, Martin is a funny guy who likes to act tough, but is secretly a softy on the inside, a characteristic only rarely seen by his more serious, long-suffering girlfriend, Gina. The show had a bit of an odd conclusion, as a sexual harassment lawsuit from Tisha Campbell resulted in her being absent through a good portion of the final season. She eventually settled and filmed three final episodes under the stipulation that she wouldn’t appear in any scenes with Lawrence, which certainly sounds like it must have been awkward to witness.—Jim Vorel\n\n7. Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp / Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later\n\nOriginal Run: 2015\n\nCreator: Michael Showalter, David Wain\n\nStars: Michael Showalter, Paul Rudd, Amy Poehler, Elizabeth Banks, Lake Bell, H. Jon Benjamin, Michael Ian Black, Josh Charles, Bradley Cooper, Judah Friedlander, Janeane Garofalo, Ken Marino, Christopher Meloni, Marguerite Moreau,\n\nOriginal Network: Netflix\n\nWatch First Day of Camp on Netflix\n\nWatch Ten Years Later on Netflix\n\nWhen a follow-up comes along for any project with a huge cult audience, it seems doomed to disappoint. Arrested Development’s fourth season’s breaking apart of the cast was bound to frustrate, and Anchorman 2 could never reach the surprising joy of the original. Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp obviously came with a certain amount of trepidation. But instead of trying to recreate the glory of the last day of camp, as seen in the 2001 film, First Day of Camp added a considerable amount of depth to the original film and explained aspects of Camp Firewood that never needed to be understood, but make the entire history of these characters feel more whole. The Netflix series managed to redefine these characters that we fell in love with over a decade ago, all while giving us laughs and immense heart as well. (The 2017 follow-up wasn’t quite as strong, sadly.) Ross Bonaime\n\n6. Insecure\n\nOriginal Run: 2016-2021\n\nCreator: Issa Rae\n\nStars: Issa Rae, Yvonne Orji, Jay Ellis, Lisa Joyce, Natasha Rothwell, Amanda Seales, Y’lan Noel, Alexander Hodge, Kendrick Sampson, Leonard Robinson, Courtney Taylor\n\nOriginal Network: HBO\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nWhile there’s still a long way to go before TV truly reflects our multi-cultural present, the arrival of series like this marvelous half-hour comedy are hopefully harbingers of the medium’s more diverse future. Built from the skeleton of co-creator Issa Rae’s YouTube series The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl, HBO’s comedy tackles an array of issues, from old chestnuts like boredom and woe in a long-term relationship to much broader concerns, like reckoning with institutional racism and individual biases in the modern workplace. (There’s also room left over for some cutting satire of the commodification and absorption of African-American culture by white people.) While her onscreen proxy is barely holding it together, Rae bears the burden of running Insecure with ease, finding a fresh perspective and flawlessly expanding upon the world of her Internet series with wit and refinement to spare. —Robert Ham\n\n5. BoJack Horseman\n\nOriginal Run: 2014-2020\n\nCreator: Raphael Bob-Waksberg\n\nStars: Will Arnett, Amy Sedaris, Alison Brie, Paul F. Tompkins, Aaron Paul\n\nOriginal Network: Netflix\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nBoJack Horseman is one of the most underrated comedies ever made, and it almost pains me that it doesn’t earn more praise. Right from the title sequence, which documents BoJack’s sad decline from network sitcom star to drunken has-been—set to the beautiful theme song written by the Black Keys’ Patrick Carney—this is one of the most thoughtful comedies ever made. Which doesn’t mean it’s not hilarious, of course. Will Arnett is the perfect voice for BoJack, and Paul F. Tompkins, who is in my mind the funniest man on planet Earth, could not be better suited to the child-like Mr. Peanut Butter. This is a show that isn’t above a visual gag or vicious banter or a wonderfully cheap laugh, but it also looks some very hard realities of life straight in the eye. There are times when you will hate BoJack—this is not a straight redemption story, and the minute you think he’s on the upswing, he will do something absolutely horrible to let you down. (There’s a special irony in the fact that a horse is one of the most human characters on TV, and the unblinking examination of his character makes “Escape from L.A.” one of the best episodes of TV this year.) So why isn’t it loved beyond a strong cult following? Maybe it’s the anthropomorphism that keeps people away, or maybe it’s the animation, but I implore you: Look beyond those elements, settle into the story, and let yourself be amazed by a comedy that straddles the line between hilarious and sad like no other on television.—Shane Ryan\n\n4. The Good Place\n\nOriginal Run: 2016-2020\n\nCreator: Michael Schur\n\nStars: Kristen Bell, William Jackson Harper, Jameela Jamil, D’Arcy Carden, Manny Jacinto, Ted Danson\n\nOriginal Network: NBC\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nSome of the best sitcoms in history are about bad people. M.A.S.H., Seinfeld, Arrested Development: It’d be hard to argue that the majority of their characters aren’t self-involved, intolerant or downright assholes. It’s far, far too early to enter The Good Place into any such pantheon, but it’s relevant in pinning down why the latest comedy from Michael Schur (The Office, Parks & Recreation, Brooklyn Nine-Nine) feels simultaneously so cozy and so adventurous.\n\nFitting into a middle ground of sensibilities between occupational comedies like NewsRadio and the sly navel-gazing of Dead Like Me, The Good Place is the rare show that’s completely upfront about its main character’s flaws, creating a moral playground that tests Eleanor’s worst impulses at every turn. Played by Kristen Bell at her most unbridled, she’s a vain, impish character—the type of person who’ll swipe someone’s coffee without a second thought, then wonder why the universe is plotting against her. She’s a perfect straight woman in an afterlife surrounded by only the purest of heart, but the show doesn’t hold it against her. If anything, following in the grand tradition of sitcoms, the show knows that we’re all bad people at one time or another.—Michael Snydel\n\n3. Arrested Development\n\nOriginal Run 2003-2006; 2013; 2018-2019\n\nCreator: Mitch Hurwitz\n\nStars: Jason Bateman, Will Arnett, Portia de Rossi, Tony Hale, David Cross, Michael Cera, Jeffrey Tambor, Jessica Walter, Alia Shawkat, Ron Howard\n\nOriginal Networks: Fox, Netflix\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nMitch Hurwitz’ sitcom about a “wealthy family who lost everything and the one son who had no choice but to keep them all together” packed a whole lot of awesome into three short seasons. How much awesome? Well, there was the chicken dance, for starters. And Franklin’s “It’s Not Easy Being White.” There was Ron Howard’s spot-on narration, and Tobias Funke’s Blue Man ambitions. There was Mrs. Featherbottom and Charlize Theron as Rita, Michael Bluth’s mentally challenged love interest. Not since Seinfeld has a comic storyline been so perfectly constructed, with every loose thread tying so perfectly into the next act. Arrested Development took self-referencing postmodernism to an absurdist extreme, jumping shark after shark, but that was the point. They even brought on the original shark-jumper—Henry Winkler—as the family lawyer. And when he was replaced, naturally, it was by Scott Baio. Each of the Bluth family members was among the best characters on television, and Jason Bateman played a brilliant straight man to them all. And after years of rumors, the show returned to Netflix for two additional seasons so far—different in both construction and tone, but nevertheless, a gift to fans who had to say goodbye to the Bluths all too soon.—Josh Jackson\n\n2. Brooklyn Nine-Nine\n\nOriginal Run 2013-2021\n\nCreator: Dan Goor, Michael Schur\n\nStars: Andy Samberg, Andre Braugher, Melissa Fumero, Stephanie Beatriz, Terry Crews, Joe Lo Truglio, Chelsea Peretti, Dirk Blocker, Joel McKinnon Miller\n\nOriginal Networks: Fox (2013-2018); NBC (2019-2021)\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nConsistency might not be the most flattering virtue you can ascribe to a sitcom, but consistency was a big part of Brooklyn Nine-Nine’s greatness. Week in and week out, Dan Goor and Michael Schur’s half-hour cop comedy managed to hit just the right notes without losing its groove. Some episodes hit higher notes than others, and yes, in the series’ lifespan, there was in fact a few off-key episodes intermingled with the others. But when Brooklyn Nine-Nine was good, it was good, and it was good with an impressive regularity. When it was great, it was arguably the best sitcom you’d find on network television, thanks in part to sharp writing, but mostly to an even sharper cast. Consistency is what fueled Brooklyn Nine-Nine’s motor, but the characters were the ones steering the ship. The show was enormously diverse in terms of not only gender and ethnicity, but also in terms of comic styles: There’s career sad sack Joe Lo Truglio, the stoically hilarious Andre Braugher, king of the clowns Andy Samberg, master of badassery Stephanie Beatriz, and that only covers a little less than half the team. Since Brooklyn Nine-Nine’s debut in 2013, each character on the show developed and grew, and in the process we came to care about all of them in equal measure. At the top of its game, Brooklyn Nine-Nine harmonized our attachment to these people with great gags, and occasionally even sharp (if brief) action. There’s a lot the series has to offer, in other words, and that just drives home how vital its constancy really was to its success. Never underestimate well-regulated humor. —Andy Crump\n\n1.
