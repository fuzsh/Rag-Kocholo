        "text": "William Goldwyn Nunn III (October 20, 1953 – September 24, 2016) was an American actor known for his roles as Radio Raheem in Spike Lee's film Do the Right Thing, Robbie Robertson in the Sam Raimi Spider-Man film trilogy and as Terrence \"Pip\" Phillips on The Job (2001–02).\n\nEarly life[]\n\nBill Nunn III was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the son of Frances Nunn and William G. Nunn, Jr., a well-known journalist and editor at the Pittsburgh Courierand a National Football League scout. His paternal grandfather was the first African American football player at George Westinghouse High School. While ball boys for the Pittsburgh Steelers, Bill Nunn and current Steelers President Art Rooney II stole \"Mean\" Joe Greene's car during training camp at Saint Vincent College in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. \"Joe Greene showed up in a beautiful green Lincoln Continental, and me and Bill Nunn, Jr. were ball boys. Somehow Bill got the keys one night and we decided to take it for a ride. We only told Joe that story about 10 years ago. We figured that enough time had passed that we could disclose our little joy ride.\"\n\nNunn was a 1970 graduate of Schenley High School and a 1976 graduate of Morehouse College. He attended college with Spike Lee and appeared in several of Lee's early feature films.\n\nCareer[]\n\nNunn made his credited film debut in the 1988 Spike Lee film School Daze, and is best known for his roles as Radio Raheem in Lee's Do the Right Thing, and as Nino Brown's bodyguard Duh Duh Duh Man in New Jack City.

Nunn was also very involved in community outreach, and he formed his own Pittsburgh-area outreach project in 2008.\n\nDeath[]\n\nNunn died on September 24, 2016 in his home in Pittsburgh's Hill District; he was 62 years old.
