        "text": "1\n\nThis is the story of the men of Ferdinand, and of FERDINAND itself. It is the story of a secret and highly unorthodox military unit which, out of the foresight of the Australian Navy and the determination of a handful of enemy-surrounded planters, missionaries, government officers, and miners, grew into the organization that supplied information from the heart of Japanese-occupied tropical islands in the Southwest Pacific, to the two Allied Headquarters of the Pacific Theater.\n\nIt is a story of damp, dimly lit jungle camps, of hidden treetop lookouts; of silent submarines landing a few intrepid men on hostile beaches, in the dead of night; of American airmen mysteriously rescued from enemy-held islands surrounded by enemy-dominated seas. It is the story of how Allied coastwatchers managed, in strange and devious ways, not only to exist under the noses of the Japanese, but also to radio out vital military information. It is the story, too, of the bravery, the loyalty, and the ingenuity of many tropical natives, and of the perfidy or weakness of others.\n\nFERDINAND was a small organization. All told, it numbered only a few hundred officers and men, both in the field and at its bases handling administrative work, supply, and communication. Yet it wove an intelligence network over more than half a million square miles of island and ocean. So secret was this organization of coastwatchers behind enemy lines that not even its existence was admitted during the war. Few knew that when the first landing waves of United States Marines hit the bitterly contested beaches of the Solomons, back in the jungles were Allies who were still ‘older inhabitants’ of Guadalcanal or New Georgia or Bougainville, coastwatchers who were eyes and ears for the invasion forces.\n\nThe coastwatchers’ codename, FERDINAND, was chosen from the child’s storybook, Ferdinand the Bull, but with no frivolous purpose. Besides serving as one of its cloaks of secrecy, this name was an order to the coastwatchers; a definition of their job. It was a reminder to them that it was not their duty to fight, and thus draw attention to themselves; like Disney’s bull, who just sat under a tree and smelled the flowers, it was their duty to sit, circumspectly and unobtrusively, and gather information. Of course, like Ferdinand, they could fight if they were stung.\n\nHarried by the Japanese, sometimes betrayed as well as helped by natives, the lonely coastwatchers often did have to fight, with fleetness and improvisation taking the place of force.\n\nBut even when they were unobtrusive and circumspect, their effectiveness was tremendous. For example, when the Japanese attempted their first air attack on our landing forces at Guadalcanal, 23 of the 24 enemy torpedo bombers engaged in the raid were brought down and no damage was done to our invasion force. The defeat of this particular air force and of many that followed was made possible by the warnings by radio of a coastwatcher, hidden 300 miles away, between the great Japanese air and naval base of Rabaul and the battleground of Guadalcanal. At Guadalcanal and at many other battles of the New Guinea-Solomons area, the work of the coastwatchers gave the Allies a considerable, even a decisive, advantage.\n\nNeither FERDINAND nor the Australian coastwatching system out of which it grew sprang up full-blown with the emergency of war. The story of its origin goes back to 1919 and to the problem of protecting Australia’s long, undefended coastline.\n\nThe island continent, its population of seven million largely concentrated in its southeast corner, presents large areas where, in wartime, an enemy might operate without hindrance and, in fact, without anyone’s being aware of it. Pondering this problem after the last war, the Navy hit on a scheme of appointing selected civilians in the coastal areas as coastwatchers, their duty being to report any enemy activity, suspicious event, or subversive behavior in time of war. On the greater part of the Australian coast, the watchers appointed by the Navy were generally postmasters, harbormasters, schoolteachers, police, or railway officials; people who had at hand the means of passing information by telegraph. The General Post Office agreed to send their reports over the telegraph lines of the Commonwealth to the Navy Office at Melbourne. The watchers themselves were supplied with printed instructions on what to report and how to report it.\n\nThe north and northwest coasts of Australia, the least inhabited parts, presented a more difficult problem. Before the 1930’s, the few scattered missionaries and managers of cattle stations in these areas had no means of swift communication. Then the invention of the pedal radio gave them a link with the outside world, and Naval Intelligence was quick to enroll all missionaries and cattlemen owning these instruments.\n\nFrugality was the governing factor in the design of the system, for the Navy had little money in peacetime. The coastwatchers were unpaid, and it was not possible for the Navy to supply them with radio equipment. It was a case of making the most of the personnel and the material available.\n\nThe most important addition to the scheme was made when government administrative officers at coastal stations in Papua, New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands were enrolled as watchers. Unfortunately, the geographical positions of the stations were determined by civil government needs and not by strategical requirements. The Navy partly remedied this defect, as time went on, by appointing selected planters to the organization. Some of the patrol and district officers in the islands had radio communication and could use the code of the islands’ administrations. Others had neither. Six government officers in the area had both radio communications and high-grade codes.\n\nThe arrangements for organizing this pre-war network, simple as it was, were necessarily protracted. State governments, boards of missions, territory governments, all had to be consulted and their co-operation sought in lengthy and voluminous correspondence.\n\nBut by September 1939, the coastwatchers were eight hundred strong, the great majority of them, of course, on the Australian mainland. In Australia’s island screen, where FERDINAND was eventually to operate, the system was still very thin and spotty, but at least a nucleus existed, and funds were available. Upon the outbreak of war with Germany, the Navy directed the organization, such as it was, to commence functioning.\n\nIt was at this point that my connection with the organization began. I had been a naval officer before I became an islander. After joining one of the first terms of cadets to enter the Royal Australian Naval College, I had gone to the Grand Fleet in 1917 as a midshipman. In 1922, I had retired with the rank of Lieutenant, and the following year had gone to New Guinea, in the government service. When war broke, I was warden of Wau Goldfield in New Guinea. I was on the emergency list of Royal Australian Naval officers, with the rank of lieutenant commander. So, in September 1939, I rejoined the Navy.\n\nI was directed to report to Commander R. B. M. Long, Director of Naval Intelligence. Long had been a term mate of mine at the Royal Australian Naval College and we knew each other well. On him had fallen much of the burden of building up the Naval Intelligence Division, and it had been a thankless task, calling for patience and equanimity. Lack of funds had prevented him from carrying out his ideas in full, and now he had to work against time to fill in the blanks.\n\nHe was a leader rather than a driver, and, if anything, over-indulgent of the faults of his juniors. Years of secretive work had developed in him an indirect, oblique approach to problems, a habit which he sometimes carried to extremes. Experience had given him a wide knowledge, and he combined a capacity for working long hours with an unfailing good humor. Above all his other virtues was his ability to let anything alone if it functioned properly. Under Long, I was appointed Staff Officer (Intelligence) at Port Moresby, in charge of the intelligence organization in Papua, New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands. Long and his civil assistant, W. H. Brooksbank, who had also borne the long struggle to build up the coastwatching organization, provided me with all the information—a considerable amount—which would be of use to me.\n\nIt was to be my duty, first, to ensure the proper functioning of the organization in the islands, as it then stood; and second, to expand it so that it would cover all our needs. Long knew what he wanted, but because of his lack of knowledge of island conditions, did not know quite how to get it.\n\nSo he left that part to me, together with the problem of dealing with those difficult people, the islanders. None of us then knew, of course, that the organization we were building would eventually operate in hostile territory, its posts surrounded by the enemy.\n\nA close up of a sign Description automatically generated\n\nRecruitment Poster for the Australian Imperial Force\n\n2\n\nTo Americans, the islands where FERDINAND operated are known as the Southwest Pacific. To Australians, from the perspective of their still more southwesterly position, they are the Northeast Area, a chain screening the island continent. In the Navy, we thought of them somewhat as a fence, but a fence with several gates; the straits between the islands. In the period between the declaration of war on Germany and the invasion of the Japanese, my job was to make the fence as effective as possible.\n\nOn 21 September 1939, with the war sixteen days old, I set out with a sheaf of printed coastwatcher instructions to visit every man in the islands who had a teleradio. My travels took me by ship, motorboat, canoe, bicycle, airplane, and boot throughout the Solomons, the New Hebrides, Papua, New Guinea, New Britain, New Ireland, and their satellite specks of land. I saw nearly everybody and nearly everybody saw me. I already knew more than half of those I met, and all were helpful.\n\nBy December 1939, I had enrolled all existing teleradio operators, taught them how to code, what to report, and that speed in reporting was the prime essential. With an eye to the future, I also instructed about a hundred others in reporting, although most of these had no means by which a message could be passed to us except by runner to the nearest teleradio; often a matter of days.\n\nWhen I returned to Port Moresby, I proposed to Long that we depart from the Australian scheme of using only coastwatchers with communications equipment already at hand, and lend additional teleradios to selected persons at strategic points.\n\nAt this time, the war with Germany was of course receiving first priority, and a proposal such as this, meaning diversion of effort to the Pacific, represented one more strain on inadequate resources. But Long, imbued with the belief that Japan would one day enter the war, pressed hard and carried the plan. Its prompt approval made all the future possible. The governments of the islands and the Royal Australian Air Force eagerly assisted us in distributing the teleradios to their strategic positions. But even under the pressure at which everyone worked, it was August 1940 before the instruments were all placed in the far-flung ports and lonely plantations.\n\nStill one more move was needed to close the gates in the fence. The principal gap in the chain is that between New Ireland and Buka, with the tiny Anir (Feni) and Nissan Islands from which the sea lanes can be watched. A plantation manager manned a Navy-supplied teleradio on Nissan, but as navigators usually prefer the route near Anir, it was vital that Anir, too, have a watcher.\n\nFor this desolate point, we selected Chief Yeoman of Signals S. Lamont, an old sailor, as Irish as Paddy’s pig. He was a complete stranger to conditions of life on an isolated island, but a resourceful and dependable man. While the news was coming through of the debacle in France and the capitulation of Belgium, he was landed and placed in a temporary camp, and then was left to shift for himself. His first few months on Anir must have been acute misery but, as we expected, he adjusted himself and carried on his watch ably.\n\nWhile we were choosing watchers and placing teleradios, we were also working out a method for integrating men and instruments into a unique communications system. Taking the materials at hand as our basis, we fitted each teleradio in the area, whether naval or privately owned, with a crystal cut to give a special frequency, known as ‘X.’ Loudspeakers kept constantly switched on at key stations in Rabaul, Tulagi Harbour, Port Moresby, and Thursday Island, could receive any signal sent on X frequency at any hour. Previously the small stations in the area had communicated with key points at fixed times; ‘skeds,’ as they were called.\n\nWe had no trouble in enlisting co-operation for our plan, for in the Solomons, radio was managed by the Government, and in Papua and New Guinea it was in the hands of Amalgamated Wireless of Australia, a company in which the Commonwealth Government held 51 percent of the shares. Until the Japanese attacked, Amalgamated Wireless was in charge of maintaining our teleradios, while the Navy paid it for this service and for the watch kept on X frequency.\n\nThe teleradios themselves had been developed by Amalgamated Wireless. They were grand instruments, standing up to heat, wet, and amateur handling, with a range up to 400 miles on voice and 600 miles if keys were used to transmit Morse. The model we used, the ‘3B,’ produced in 1939, consisted of a transmitter, receiver, and loudspeaker, with four alternative transmission frequencies which could be tuned to complete accuracy. All parts were enclosed in three metal boxes, each about a foot deep, a foot wide, and two feet long. Power was supplied by batteries like those a car uses, which were charged by a small gasoline engine weighing about 70 pounds, the heaviest part of the set.\n\nThe instrument had one serious disadvantage. It was difficult to carry, requiring twelve to sixteen porters. Foreseeing that the time might come when this would be a serious handicap, Naval Intelligence drew up requirements for a portable teleradio and placed orders. An error crept into the manufacturing and after many months we were supplied not with the type we wanted, but with a radio similar to the 3B, only not quite as good. The Air Forces developed what we wanted independently, and eventually we were able to obtain it and even to supply it by parachute to coastwatchers. In the meantime, however, the 3B was our mainstay.\n\nIn this grim game of watching and reporting, part of the value of the signal would be lost if the enemy knew he had been reported and could take countermeasures, so a code was an absolute necessity.\n\n‘Playfair,’ a simple cipher known to most schoolboys, had been chosen in peacetime when the coastwatchers were first appointed by the Navy. It has the virtue that it needs no documents other than a list of agreed-on keywords, but it has the disadvantage of being low grade. I devised a variation known as ‘Playfair Feldt Method’—one by which the bigrams were broken—which was a little more secure than the original. Eventually, after the watchers had amply proved themselves, the Navy supplied us with really good codes.\n\nLong before the war, the Navy had pondered the problem of reliability of coastwatchers and had devised a scale to take into account both its faith in the individual informant and the likelihood of the occurrence he reported. This grading system was carefully used from 1939 until Japan entered the war. But when coastwatchers came fully into the picture, with war on their doorsteps, they established such a gilt-edged reputation that their reports were automatically accepted, qualified only by any doubts which the watcher himself expressed.\n\nIn December 1940, the coastwatchers had a first tangle with the enemy when two German raiders chose the small island of Emirau, north of Kavieng, to land prisoners from ships they had sunk. This gave the watchers some real practice. A boat from the island reached Kavieng where the District Officer, who was the coastwatcher there, signaled its arrival and the position of the prisoners.\n\nArrangements were promptly made to pick up the marooned passengers and crews. Soon the officers dispatched, more than busy collecting information concerning the appearance of the raiders, their armament, their methods, and for the reconstruction of the routes they had followed. With the arrival of the refugees in an Australian port, the coastwatchers settled down to waiting again, now with a feeling that they had a real role to play.\n\nThe presence of the raiders, however, added indirectly to one of our minor but annoying troubles; the patriotic fervor of loud-mouthed flag-wavers. These nuisances had nothing much to do, so they engaged in a heresy hunt. They were not so much security-mad. In New Guinea some of the Germans, even some Lutheran missionaries, were Nazis, and after their internment suspicion of all Germans, including anyone with a German-sounding name, burned to incandescence.\n\nThe surveillance of subversive activity was the duty of Military Intelligence, so I took little part in it, but at times found my way beset with difficulties. For instance, when I proposed making an Australian Lutheran missionary a coastwatcher, a high civil official said, horror in every syllable, ‘But he spells his name F-r-e-u-n-d!’\n\nI could only reply, weakly, by spelling my own.\n\nAnother who was held in deep suspicion by the ultra-patriotic was Ken Frank, manager of the Amalgamated Wireless station at Port Moresby. Frank’s advice and expert assistance to us were beyond price but he was a cynic who derided the Empire; consequently, while he worked day and night to save the country, he was amusingly enough dubbed a Fifth Columnist. Later, when disaster was near, Frank sat at a receiver with the bombs falling around him, still wisecracking about Old School Ties and Strategic Retreats, his accusers long since having sugared off to safety.\n\nDuring our period of waiting, the lesson from Europe had been the need for co-operation among the Armed Services. So, in Melbourne the Chiefs of Staff of Australian Army, Navy, and Air Force pooled their authority and exercised command as the ‘Combined War Room’ overall forces.\n\nOur coastwatcher reports, which obviously concerned the three services, were available instantly to all. Coastwatchers were under general supervision of the civil government in the islands, but experience had shown us that in times of even minor stress civil officials were so busy at their own affairs they had no time to attend to ours. To remedy this, the Navy appointed intelligence officers to Port Moresby, Thursday Island, Rabaul, Tulagi, and Vila, each to control coastwatchers in his own area and to transmit intelligence to Melbourne and to Area Combined Headquarters in Townsville.\n\nThrough this arrangement, I lost my assistant Hugh Mackenzie, who was appointed to Rabaul. Mackenzie had been in the same term as I at Naval College. He had spent most of the years between the two wars in New Guinea and Papua, first as a rolling stone and later as a planter. He was conscientious and thorough in an unsystematic way, occasionally doing something quite illogical. The coastwatching service was lucky the day it got Mackenzie, for this man, who completely lacked the qualities of salesmanship and showmanship, was to fill brilliantly one of the most dramatic and responsible assignments of the battle for Guadalcanal.\n\nMackenzie and each of the other four Naval Intelligence Officers assigned to coastwatcher control kept a plot of ships in his area. Should Lamont on Anir sight a ship, for instance, he would immediately code a signal and call Rabaul on X frequency. Amalgamated Wireless at Rabaul would telephone the signal over a direct wire to Mackenzie, who would decode it. If no ship on his plot corresponded to that reported, his office would pass Lamont’s signal to the Air Force and would then code a signal in high-grade cypher for Melbourne and Townsville. The Air Force’s Rabaul Advanced Operational Base would send out an aircraft to intercept and examine the ship.\n\nIf the sighting were of aircraft instead of a ship, the signal from the coastwatcher had to be sent in plain language. Experience had shown us that by the time the signal was decoded, aircraft information was cold.\n\nAs far as could be done, the intelligence position was sewn up. As far as could be done...\n\nThere was one grave weakness in our position. We had insufficient force to back up and hold our intelligence screen. Australia’s sea forces, somewhere to the south, were not adequate in any case to deal with more than a squadron of light cruisers. The Air Force had some Catalinas, a few Hudson bombers, and half a dozen Wirraways. The Army had little more than a battalion in Port Moresby, about the same force at Rabaul, and still smaller forces at five other points in the vast territory. In terms of war, we had merely token forces.\n\nIt was obvious that if the enemy came on anything more serious than a raid, any of our key coastwatcher points might be occupied and our chain broken.\n\nSo we were increasingly haunted by the specter of enemy occupation, and by the anomalous position of the coastwatchers. Under international law, coastwatchers, as civilians, had no real right to transmit intelligence once their area was effectively occupied. Should they continue reporting they would be absolutely unprotected, their position that of spies.\n\nNo policy was laid down on this disturbing possibility until late in 1941, when Long made the decision that civilian coastwatchers were to cease reporting in the event of enemy occupation. Bound as he was by international law and by the limitation that civilians could not be ordered to remain in invaded territory, he could take no other stand. Unofficially, however, we all hoped that in case of invasion some civilians would remain and report enemy movements.\n\nSo, in practice, we left things pretty much in the air. Watchers were informed that they were not ordered to remain. However, we took care not to give a definite order that they cease reporting and we did give them careful instructions on how to contact another radio station should their own control station fail to reply.\n\nThus, when Japan struck, the decision was really in the hands of the watchers themselves. A civilian coastwatcher could remain, at his own risk and in the hope he would get recognition and support. But there was no promise, even an implied promise, that he would get either. All he had was the promise of certain peril.\n\n3\n\nWhen, a month after Pearl Harbor, the hurricane of war struck at the Northeast Area, it worked havoc with our island intelligence chain. Here and there, parts of the chain were left freakishly intact; in other places it was destroyed, or its links dislocated.\n\nThere was, for instance, C.C. Jervis, planter and retired Navy telegraphist on Nissan Island, who watched an enemy ship move toward the lagoon entrance of his low, undefended atoll; he calmly coded and sent a report of its presence, and was never heard of again.\n\nThere was J. Daymond, assistant district officer at Gasmata, a noisome, marshy native prison island off the south coast of New Britain, who warned Port Moresby of its first air raid, giving the town ample time to prepare, and then was betrayed, unwittingly, by his countrymen: the news was broadcast in Australia that enemy aircraft had been sighted over Gasmata, direct information to the Japanese that we had a reporting station at that point. Promptly the enemy bombed and gunned Gasmata station. For the nonce, Daymond and his staff were saved, having wisely moved with their teleradio across to the mainland.\n\nUnsatisfied, the Japanese landed a force at Gasmata two weeks after the fall of Rabaul. According to the story that percolated through, they asked the first native they saw where the kiap was, and were led, in innocent simplicity, to"
