        "text": "The battle for New Guinea\n\nWith their conquest of the Bismarck Archipelago complete, the Japanese next set their sights on Port Moresby, on the southern coast of New Guinea. Control of the port would expand the Japanese sphere of influence to the Coral Sea and disrupt the Allied line of communication between the United States and Australia. Deadly air raids on Darwin (February 19, 1942) and Broome (March 3, 1942) brought the war to mainland Australia, and it seemed as if an invasion of the Northern Territory were a very real possibility. The Japanese planned an amphibious assault on Port Moresby, but Allied cryptanalysts had cracked the Japanese naval code and a carrier group was dispatched to intercept the Japanese invasion fleet. In the resulting Battle of the Coral Sea (May 4–8, 1942), the Japanese won a tactical victory but lost so many aircraft that they were forced to abandon their invasion plan and return to Rabaul.\n\nWith the sea route to southern New Guinea closed, the Japanese planned to launch an overland campaign south across the Owen Stanley Range via a 60-mile (96-km) mountain trail known as the Kokoda Track. The trail ran from the village of Kokoda, on the northeastern slopes of the range, to a position known as Owers’ Corner (named for Australian Army surveyor Lt. Noel Owers), in the southwest. The narrow path cut through dense jungle with extremely steep ascents and descents; the total elevation change between the highest and lowest points on the track was nearly 6,000 feet (more than 1,800 metres).\n\nOn July 21, 1942, Japanese forces landed on the northern coast of New Guinea at Gona and Buna and began advancing towards Kokoda village. Over subsequent days, they were met with strong resistance by the 39th Australian Infantry Battalion and the Papuan Infantry Battalion (PIB). These two units were grouped together into an ad hoc command that became known as Maroubra Force. The Japanese were seasoned veterans and experienced night fighters, but Maroubra Force, despite being heavily outnumbered and outgunned, acquitted itself well. It carried out a fighting retreat to Deniki, 4 miles (6 km) south of Kokoda village, after the Japanese pushed it out of Kokoda on the morning of July 29. Possession of Kokoda gave the Japanese control of the only airfield between Port Moresby and the Japanese landing area.\n\nOn August 8 Maroubra Force launched a counterattack from Deniki and attempted to retake Kokoda but was unsuccessful. By this time, food and supplies were running dangerously low, and on August 14 the exhausted Australians and Papuans were pushed farther south along the Kokoda Track to Isurava. With Maroubra Force’s situation worsening, troops from the 7th Division of the Second Australian Imperial Force were dispatched to reinforce their comrades on August 23. Throughout September the Japanese advanced through Eora Creek, Templeton’s Crossing, Efogi, Mission Ridge, and finally Ioribaiwa Ridge, which they took on September 16. The Allies were forced to pull back to Imita Ridge, but by this time the Japanese were nearly out of supplies and were suffering from hunger, sickness, and exhaustion. In addition, the Battle of Guadalcanal had become the focus of Japanese efforts in the southwestern Pacific. At their point of farthest advance, the Japanese were less than 35 miles (56 km) from Port Moresby. On September 24 the main body of Japanese withdrew. After more tenacious fighting along the Kokoda Track, the Australians and their New Guinean allies were able to defeat the Japanese and retake Kokoda village on November 2."
