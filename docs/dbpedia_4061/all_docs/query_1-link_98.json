        "text": "Remembrance Day Commemorative Services will take place at local RSL's on Friday November 11th, deatils below.\n\nIn previous history page, Brock's The Oaks - La Corniche From 1911 to 1965: Rickards, A Coffee King, A Progressive School, A WWII Training Ground, it became apparent that a Mosman family bought the bulk of the land and cottages associated with the by then 'La Corniche' during its short time as 'Quest Haven' and during the period this land and its buildings were utilised as a training centre during World War Two.\n\nSome of the peculiarities that showed up during widower Mr. Gerald McPhee Snr.'s dealings with the Army during that period are brought into starker relief when you consider his son, Gerald Joseph McPhee was serving in several very dangerous missions in New Guinea during that time as part of 'M' Special Unit. He had been transferred to 'M' Special Unit October 22nd, 1943. His previous Unit was the Independent Company - Reinforcements, which was the first commandos unit of the Australian Army.\n\nHe was in his early 20's at the time.\n\nIn 1943, M Special Unit was formed as a successor to the Coastwatchers, with the role of the unit focused on gathering intelligence on Japanese shipping and troop movements. To achieve this mission, small teams were landed behind enemy lines by sea, air or land insertion. This was in contrast to its counterpart, Z Special Unit, which became well known for its direct-action commando-style raids, although it is recorded in G J McPhee's records that M Special Unit members also undertook offensive actions.\n\n'M' Special Unit was was a joint Allied special reconnaissance unit, part of the Services Reconnaissance Department (SRD), in the South West Pacific theatre of the Second World War. A joint Australian, New Zealand, Dutch and British military intelligence unit, it saw action in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands between 1943–1945, against the Empire of Japan.\n\nZ Special Unit was a joint Allied special forces unit formed during the Second World War to operate behind Japanese lines in South East Asia. Predominantly Australian, Z Special Unit was a specialist reconnaissance and sabotage unit that included British, Dutch, New Zealand, Timorese and Indonesian members, predominantly operating on Borneo and the islands of the former Dutch East Indies. The unit carried out a total of 81 covert operations in the South West Pacific theatre, with parties inserted by parachute or submarine to provide intelligence and conduct guerrilla warfare. The best known of these missions were Operation Jaywick, which was launched from Refuge Bay, and Operation Rimau, both of which involved raids on Japanese shipping in Singapore Harbour; the latter of which resulted in the deaths of 23 commandos either in action or by execution after capture.\n\nM Special Unit was disbanded at the end of the war on November 10th, 1945.\n\nThis year, 2022, a number of Commemorative Services have taken place to mark the 80th anniversary of the Battle of Guadalcanal and the 80th anniversary of the sinking of HMAS Canberra, as well as the 80th anniversary of the Kokoda Track campaign. Approximately 625 Australians were killed and more than 1,600 wounded in the four-month battle along the Kokoda Track in 1942.\n\nOn November 3rd, 2022 the NSW Government announced it has designated November 3, as NSW Kokoda Day to officially acknowledge the Kokoda campaign of the Second World War.\n\nPremier Dominic Perrottet announced this would be an annual day of acknowledgement for the veterans of Kokoda, to recognise their bravery and efforts in New Guinea.\n\n“Having walked the track myself, it is important we, and future generations, mark the bravery and sacrifices of those who served there” Mr Perrottet said.\n\n“Our troops had to wade through mud, fighting off insects and infection, before encountering some of the most brutal battles of the Second World War.”\n\n“Establishing 3 November as a NSW day to honour the service of our veterans from Kokoda will ensure their efforts and sacrifice will not be forgotten.”\n\nMinister for Transport, Veterans and Western Sydney David Elliott made the announcement today at the Kokoda Track Memorial Walkway.\n\n“On 2 November 1942, Australian troops reclaimed the Kokoda village after four months of brutal jungle warfare. The following day, the Australian flag was raised.” Mr Elliott said.\n\n“On the 80th anniversary of this occasion, we remember the strength and resilience of all those who served along the Kokoda Track and it is wonderful to now have this day recognised in our NSW calendar.”\n\nNSW Kokoda Day will last as a yearly acknowledgement of the contributions made by Australian men and women of the Kokoda Track and also acknowledge the sacrifices of their families.\n\nThe Kokoda Track Memorial Walkway in Concord is a living memorial that gives the people of NSW a greater sense of what Australian troops experienced in New Guinea. It is a place for commemoration and reflection for veterans and the community.\n\n“With the number of Australians who served in the Second World War sadly dwindling, it is important that the residents of NSW have memorials that can continue to educate the younger generation on significant events in Australia’s history, like the Kokoda Track campaign.” Mr Elliott added.\n\nYou can get more information on the Kokoda Walkway website\n\nCommemorative Services this year have also included honouring Solomon Island Scouts and Coast Watchers. In August 2022 United States Ambassador to Australia, Caroline Kennedy, attended a Service at the Solomon Scouts and Coastwatchers Memorial. Ambassador Kennedy's attendance had a personal touch as she was also able to pay a tribute to those who had saved her father's life.\n\nTRANSCRIPT: Ambassador Caroline Kennedy’s Remarks at the Solomon Scouts and Coastwatchers Memorial\n\nAugust 7, 2022 – Honiara, Solomon Islands\n\nAMBASSADOR KENNEDY: Good morning.\n\nMr. Veke, Ministers of the Crown, Ambassadors, distinguished guests, our hosts from the Solomon Islands, Sir Bruce Saunders, and those who work on this memorial.\n\nMr. Kenilorea, thank you for those moving remarks and for your own family’s distinguished public service.\n\nMinister Conroy, Vice Admiral Hammond, Minister Oniki, General Yamazaki, Minister Henare, it’s great to be with you today on this memorable anniversary.\n\nI’m especially honored to accompany Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, Deputy Commander of INDOPACOM General Sklenka, Commander of Marine Corps Forces Pacific General Rudder, and diplomatic and defense colleagues from the United States, Australia, Japan, and New Zealand to mark this anniversary.\n\nAs we reflect on the battles that took place on these lands and in these waters 80 years ago, we honor the courage of the Solomon Scouts and Coastwatchers who made a critical contribution to turning the tide at Guadalcanal.\n\nSolomon Islanders risked their lives to support the Allied effort.\n\nMany joined in the fight, lending their superior knowledge of the local terrain and their expertise in jungle fighting.\n\nThey stayed behind Japanese lines at personal risk to their own safety and that of their families.\n\nThe information they gathered was invaluable to the Allied effort during the Guadalcanal campaign.\n\nBecause of the selfless service and sacrifice of the Solomon Scouts and Coastwatchers, the Allies were able to hold Guadalcanal.\n\nAnd because of Guadalcanal, the Allies achieved victory in the Pacific.\n\nWhile we all owe a debt of gratitude to the Solomon Islanders who risked their lives during the Pacific Campaign, my family and I owe a personal debt of gratitude to two Solomon Islander Scouts — Biaku Gasa and Eroni Kumana – who saved my father’s life.\n\nThanks to them, he and his crew survived the sinking of PT-109 and were able to return home and eventually run for President.\n\nHis experiences here made him the man and the leader that he was, just as the experiences of so many others shaped the men and women they would become.\n\nIt resolved him to seek a more peaceful and just world, and he gave his life for his country.\n\nI’m deeply touched to be here today, knowing that I might not be here if it were not for Biaku Gasa and Eroni Kumana.\n\nAnd I’m not alone in feeling this way. Countless Americans and Allied families have Solomon Islanders to thank for their survival.\n\nWe’re here today not only to express our gratitude to those who sacrificed during the war, but also to those who established peace and worked for the years and decades that followed to bring our nations closer.\n\nI look forward to returning to Solomon Islands with my children and showing them this part of our family history – which is so closely intertwined with this country – and telling them about the partnership we’ve shared with Solomon Islanders in years since the war.\n\nIt’s our way to honour those who came before us and to work and do our best to leave a legacy for those who follow.\n\nThank you.\n\nAmbassador Caroline Kennedy, the United States ambassador to Australia, meets with John Koloni and Nelma Ane, children of those who saved her father, at a ceremony marking the 80th anniversary of the battle of Guadalcanal. Photographs: US Embassy Australia\n\nThis had been preceded by a wreath laying ceremony at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra:\n\nAmbassador Caroline Kennedy’s Meeting with Australian Coastwatchers at the Australian War Memorial\n\nJuly 28, 2022\n\nAmbassador Caroline Kennedy and General Mark Milley, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, met with two Australian veteran Coastwatchers and their family members at the Australian War Memorial yesterday. The Ambassador reaffirmed the strength of the U.S.-Australia alliance and expressed her gratitude for the service and sacrifice of Australians during World War II, highlighting the Coastwatchers, who played a critical role in rescuing President John F. Kennedy after his patrol torpedo boat was destroyed.\n\nAmbassador Kennedy met Ms. Eve Ash, daughter of Australian World War II veteran Mr. Ronald (Dixie) George Lee, and Mr. Tom Burrowes, son of veteran Mr. James Burrowes OAM, at the Australian War Memorial. Mr. Lee and Mr. Burrowes joined the meeting virtually from the U.S. Consulate General in Melbourne.\n\nIn their meeting, Ambassador Kennedy said “It was a great honor to meet two Australian Coastwatchers, who played an essential role in keeping the region secure during World War II. I owe personal gratitude to an Australian Coastwatcher and two Solomon Islander scouts who saved my father’s life. These men represent the best of their generation and are an amazing example of the bonds of the U.S.-Australia alliance.”\n\n“I was deeply honored to participate in a wreath-laying ceremony with Ambassador Kennedy and meet a few Australian Coastwatchers. The U.S-Australia alliance remains just as strong as when we fought side-by-side more than 70 years ago. The World War II generation of Americans and Australians bequeathed us a set of freedoms, and we have an obligation today to uphold their sacrifices,” said General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the highest ranking military officer in the United States.\n\n“The event was a very special and personal acknowledgement by Ambassador Kennedy and the US government of the role we had as Aussie Coastwatchers eight decades ago. I am proud at 98 to meet Her Excellency and share Coastwatcher stories. The time I spent in the Solomons and other locations as a Coastwatcher is as vivid today as it was then. It has been an honor to participate in this memorial event,” Australian World War II veteran Mr. Ronald (Dixie) George Lee.\n\n“’It was an amazing experience to meet with Ambassador Caroline Kennedy and extremely pleasing to speak with her during the commemorative wreath-laying. As a Coastwatcher, I have long been aware of the role played by the Australian and Solomon Islander Coastwatchers Reg Evans, Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana in rescuing then Lieutenant John F. Kennedy and his crew after their Patrol Torpedo Boat was cut in two by a Japanese destroyer. So I was honored to receive the Ambassador’s kind acknowledgement of our Coastwatching role in the war and recognition of our rescue of the future President,” Australian World War II veteran Mr. James Burrowes OAM.\n\nAmbassador Kennedy presented Ms. Ash and Mr. Burrowes with replicas of the coconut that President Kennedy used to send a rescue message following the destruction of his patrol torpedo boat, PT-109.\n\nFollowing their meeting, Ambassador Kennedy, Ms. Ash, and Mr. Burrowes, along with Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley, toured the Memorial Commemorative Area.\n\n“Our wonderful new U.S. Ambassador Caroline Kennedy has shone a very personal light on the special role of Australian Coastwatchers in World War II. I was privileged to meet her and General Milley and to lay a wreath on behalf of my father, one of the last surviving Coastwatchers. The tour of the Australian War Memorial was very moving. No doubt Ambassador Kennedy will strengthen and bring warmth to the close bond between our two countries,” Ms. Eve Ash, daughter of Australian World War II veteran Mr. Ronald George “Dixie” Lee.\n\n“I am truly humbled to represent my Coastwatcher father Jim Burrowes on this specific commemoration to the Coastwatchers with our U.S. allies and with such a personal connection. The bravery and sacrifice of the Coastwatchers is inspiring to the next two generations of Australians who have enjoyed relatively peaceful enjoyment and prosperity. We express our deep gratitude and indeed, I dips me lid! And Lest We Forget,” Mr. Tom Burrowes, son of veteran Mr. James Burrowes OAM, at the Australian War Memorial.\n\nAmbassador Kennedy, General Milley, Ms. Ash, and Mr. Burrowes then participated in the Last Post Ceremony and laid a wreath at the Pool of Reflection.\n\nAmbassador Kennedy’s engagements at the Australian War Memorial reflect Australia’s status as a vital ally, partner, and friend of the United States.\n\n“The U.S.-Australia alliance plays a vital part of promoting peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region and around the world. I look forward to working to advance our alliance during my time as Ambassador.” – Ambassador Caroline Kennedy\n\nThe Coastwatchers, also known as the Coast Watch Organisation, Combined Field Intelligence Service or Section C, Allied Intelligence Bureau, were Allied military intelligence operatives stationed on remote Pacific islands during World War II to observe enemy movements and rescue stranded Allied personnel. They played a significant role in the Pacific Ocean theatre and South West Pacific theatre, particularly as an early warning network during the Guadalcanal campaign.\n\nWhen the Japanese overran the Gilbert Islands in 1942, 17 New Zealand coastwatchers were captured. Imprisoned at Tarawa, they were executed by the Japanese in October 1942 following an American air raid.\n\nIn early November 1942, two coastwatchers named Jack Read and Paul Mason on Bougainville Island radioed early warnings to the United States Navy about Japanese warship and air movements (citing the numbers, type, and speed of enemy units) preparing to attack the US Forces in the Solomon Islands.\n\nBorn in Sydney on September 26th 1921 to Gerald Joseph and Mary McPhee, G J Jnr. came from a long standing tradition of farming families on both sides of his parentage. On December 3rd 1935, when Mary McPhee is recorded as the purchaser of the La Corniche 9 acres of lands and buildings, her husband's occupation is listed as 'retired Grazier'.\n\nGerald had been born in 1880, the second son of James John and Anne McPhee. Mary was the fourth daughter of Maurice and Hannah Mahoney. Her father was a farmer who passed away in 1887, leaving his wife to care for four daughters.\n\nGerald McPhee married Mary Kenny in 1917. Mary was already a widower and mother to a daughter, so there were no big announcements of their marriage in the local country newspapers, as had been the case with so many other community events. A simple record found is:\n\nPersonal Notes. — The engagement is announced of Mr. Gerald McPhee of Trangie, second son of Mr. J. McPhee \"Copperhannie\" Trunkey, and Mary, youngest daughter of Mrs. Mahoney \"Aidar\" Lambert St. and widow of the late A. Kenny. The marriage is to take place very early in the new year. The youthful bride-elect has already received many congratulations and expressions of good will for her future happiness. REMARKS (1917, November 7).

McPHEE THE VICTIM.\n\nThe very regrettable news came to Cowra on Tuesday that Mr. James John McPhee, father of Mr. J. P. McPhee, of Cowra, had been knocked down by a motor lorry at Mosman that afternoon, and died shortly after being admitted to the Mater Misericordiae Hospital at North Sydney. The deceased gentleman, who had reached the ripe old age of 88 years, had resided for a considerable period at Copperhannia, Trunkey, and was well and favorably known in Cowra, having frequently visited here. For the past five years he had lived with his only daughter, Mrs. Deakin, wife of Dr. Deakin, at Mosman.\n\nThe late Mr. McPhee was a native of Ireland, but came to Australia when a mere child. At the point where the accident happened the street is being done up and only a narrow portion of it is open for traffic. Mr. McPhee had gone across for a paper and was re-turning when the lorry struck him. Rev. Father O'Donnell had also been for his paper and was quickly with Mr. McPhee, and had him conveyed to the Hospital, where he was admitted. The mortal remains of the deceased gentleman were buried at the Northern Suburbs cemetery, Rev. Fathers Murphy, O'Don-nell, and MacDermott officiating at the graveside. The late Mr. McPhee was a pastoralist, and for some years was a chairman of the Stock Board, and a member of the Land Board in the Carcoar district. He was also one of the first Shire Councillors at Rockley. He leaves four sons, Dr. V. J. Mc-Phee, of Macquarie Street and Rush-cutter's Bay; Messrs. J. P. McPhee, chemist, of Cowra; Gerald McPhee, pastoralist, lives at Mosman; and Jas. McPhee, pastoralist, of Orange. His only daughter is Mrs. Deakin, wife of Dr. Deakin.

As part of defensive measures, the 1st and 2nd Infantry Divisions were tasked with defending Newcastle and Sydney, while the 1st Cavalry Division assumed the role of command reserve, based around Narellan.\n\nGerald then had to go through reenlisting again, as a 21 year old, on October 1st 1941, into the AIF. He was still in the 1st Cavalry Division - Signals, and was a member of this Unit when Darwin was bombed in February 1942.\n\nOn July 20th 1942 he was 'marched out to G.D.D. and to School of Guerrilla Warfare, Foster, Victoria.' Two days later he was having an x ray of his 4th right metacarpal(ring finger). A fracture of the fourth and/or fifth metacarpal bones transverse neck secondary due to axial loading is known as a boxer's fracture. Foster, Victoria, is a dairying and grazing town 174 kilometres south-east of Melbourne.\n\nHis designated Unit was now the 3rd Australian Armed Division\n\nHe was then enlisted in the AMF in November 14th, 1942, soon after turning 21, the then legal age for enlistment. He listed his religion as Church of England despite affirmed Catholic relatives on both sides of his parents families. This time he enlisted at Foster stating he had previously done military service as an Assistant Sergeant in the 1st Australian Motor Division - Signals (N80453).\n\nHe had become part of the Independent Company - Reinforcements.\n\nThe 1st Independent Company was one of twelve independent or commando companies raised by the Australian Army for service in World War II. Raised in 1941, the 1st Independent Company served in New Ireland, New Britain and New Guinea in the early stages of the war in the Pacific, taking part in a major commando raid on Salamaua in June 1942. Having lost a large number of men captured by the enemy as well as a number of battle casualties, the company was withdrawn from New Britain later in 1942. The company was subsequently disbanded, with its surviving members being transferred to other commando units, and it was never re-raised.\n\nBy January 1943 he was engaged in 'jungle warfare training'. By February 1943 he was off to Queensland prior to heading into New Guinea.\n\nHe then transferred into the AIF on March 8th 1943 [NX1515110] and then into the 1st Australian Commandos on August 25th, 1943 and was now part of the 'M' Special Unit on October 22nd, 1943.\n\nDescribed as 5 feet 7 1/2 inches tall with grey eyes and dark hair, much of his official War Record is filled with blanks of course - long months where he was obviously engaged in operations behind the lines. These documents do record he was engaged in 'Special Duties', was evacuated to Berrima District Hospital on May 21st 1944 for an appendicitis operation but had re-joined his 'Unit' by June 22nd, 1944.\n\nWhat can be determined from his records is he was awarded honours from both the Australian and United States armies, along with Mentions In Despatches.

The West Australian (Perth, WA : 1879 - 1954), p. 22. Retrieved from http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article46825401\n\nGerald McPhee was involved in the Bougainville campaign. The Bougainville campaign was of the largest campaigns fought by Australians during WWII and also one of the final campaigns of the war in the Pacific. Waged largely by militia formations, it wrapped up a series of actions and campaigns waged against the Japanese by Australian, American, Fijian and New Zealand forces, beginning at the time of the Japanese invasion of Bougainville and the adjacent Buka Island in early 1942.\n\nBougainville and Buka are the two northern islands of the Solomon Islands group. Before World War II they were held by Australia under a League of Nations mandate. The island was named after the French navigator Louis Antoine de Bougainville in 1767.\n\nBougainville is the largest island of the Solomon Islands chain, about 130 miles (210 km) long and 30 miles (50 km) wide, with an area of about 3800 square miles (9800 km2). Located near the north-western end of the chain, 190 miles (300 km) east of Rabaul, it is a mountainous island, dominated by the Emperor and Crown Prince ranges, with two active volcanoes. The tallest of these (Mount Balbi) reaches to 10,171 feet (3100 meters) in height.\n\nThe lower slopes and coastal plains are covered in dense jungle. With an average annual rainfall of around 100 inches (250 cm) the island is wet year-round. It is extremely humid throughout the year, with a mean temperature of 27 °C (80 °F). Although seasons are not pronounced, June through August is the cooler period, and north-westerly winds from November until April bring more frequent rainfall, and occasional squalls or cyclones.. Malaria and other tropical diseases are prevalent. The island is home to some of the greatest biodiversity in the region both above and below the waters with spectacular reefs and lagoons.\n\nKokopau is the arrival point on the main island after crossing from Buka. For virtually all visitors, this is the starting point on Bougainville for a journey southwards through some very picturesque coastal village communities, which include Tinputz at the most north-easterly point of the island.\n\nIn late 1941, there was a good anchorage with a small landing for loading copra at Buin, near the southern end of the island, and a grass airstrip. A 1400' (430m) airstrip had been completed on Buka Island at Buka Passage, the narrow strip of water between Buka and Bougainville, which was also the British administrative centre. There were several native trails, mostly along the coast, but only the trail around the northwest coast of the island was usable by motor vehicles.\n\nThe population was about 54,000 islanders who spoke around 18 different languages, and only 100 Europeans and 100 Asians (mostly Chinese). Today there are several indigenous languages in Bougainville. These include both Melanesian and Papuan languages, none of which are spoken by more than 20% of the population. The larger languages such as Nasioi, Korokoro Motuna, Telei, and Halia are split into dialects that are not always mutually understandable. For most Bougainvilleans, Tok Pisin is the lingua franca, and at least in the coastal areas Pisin is often learned by children in a bilingual environment.\n\nEuropean women and children were ordered to evacuate on December 12th 1941, and the remaining Europeans were ordered to evacuate on December 18th. However, many of the European residents refused evacuation, including a sizable fraction of the missionaries on the island. Among those who remained were Jack Read and Paul Mason, who became part of the \"Ferdinand\" Coast Watcher organisation under Commander Eric Feldt, RAN. Feldt chose the name Ferdinand, from the popular children's classic, The Story of Ferdinand, penned by Munro Leaf and illustrated by Robert Lawson, and first published in 1936.\n\nI chose Ferdinand … who did not fight but sat under a tree and just smelled the flowers. It was meant as a reminder to Coastwatchers that it was not their duty to fight and so draw attention to themselves, but to sit circumspectly and unobtrusively, gathering information. Of course, like their titular prototype, they could fight if they were stung. - [Eric Feldt, The Coastwatchers, Melbourne, 1946, p.95]\n\nRead and Mason transmitted vital early warnings of Japanese air raids against Henderson Field during the Guadalcanal campaign.\n\nOn January 29th 1942, Japanese Imperial Headquarters had ordered Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto to plan for the occupation of Lae and Salamaua in New Guinea, with follow-up operations against Port Moresby and Tulagi in the Solomons. This meant the Japanese had plans to invade Bougainville and Buka in order to secure an anchorage to support operations further east in the Solomons. Five weeks after the order had been issued, naval forces set out from Rabaul to seize Lae and Salamaua to the south and Queen Carola Harbour on Buka Island to the east. Two cruisers and six destroyers sailed for Queen Carola Harbour in north Buka.\n\nLance-Corporal Jack Matthews was one of a party at Kessa, overlooking the harbour:\n\nAt 0900 hours on 9 March 1942, we noticed a number of ships on the horizon, which appeared to be approaching. This proved to be so, and later we could identify them as Japanese naval vessels ... Sig Sly immediately tried to contact [naval coastwatcher] WJ Read on the radio for half an hour but with no success. During this time the ships were getting very close, so I decided to dismantle and hide the radio in case they should land in our vicinity.\n\nThe Australians continued observing the warships. Eventually they got a message to Read, who was able to inform authorities at Port Moresby. Tragically, a press release back in Melbourne noted that Japanese ships had visited Kessa, so the Japanese knew to return in search of Coast Watchers. Consequently a planter, Percy Goode, was killed and a missionary was taken prisoner.\n\nSome records state the natives on Bougainville were more cooperative with the Japanese than in other parts of the Solomons, citing a number of reasons for this. The evacuation of the European population was incredibly disturbing to the native population, who rioted at Kieta on January 23rd 1942 and were brought under control only by the efforts of one of the German residents who had refused evacuation. The influence of German missionaries and the fact that the Japanese had so easily driven out the Allies also had their effect on the attitude of the natives.\n\nThose who served in this area state that without the islanders they could not have survived, let alone successfully carry out their missions, without the help of the residents.\n\nBy the end of April 1942, having consolidated their positions in New Guinea, the Japanese were ready to step up operations and launch 'Operation Mo', the occupation of Port Moresby and Tulagi. The intention was to establish air bases in southern New Guinea to facilitate air operations against northern Australia, take Nauru and Ocean Islands with their phosphate deposits, and capture the Solomons to cut across the most direct Australia – United States shipping routes.\n\nTulagi was occupied without opposition on May 3rd. The Battle of the Coral Sea stopped the Port Moresby invasion force, while the Battle of Midway, north-west of Hawaii, was a further setback to Japanese forces as they lost the aircraft carriers needed to support their operations in the Solomons. Three months later, the American 1st Marine Division landed at Tulagi and Guadalcanal Islands, starting the battle to reclaim the Solomons.\n\nBuka and Bougainville had been overrun by the end of April. The Australian Coast Watchers and the troops of the 1st Independent Company remained to observe Japanese land, sea and air activities. They were able to give warning of enemy shipping movements and impending attacks on the American forces at Tulagi and Guadalcanal. The observation posts of Lieutenant John Read in northern Bougainville and Lieutenant Paul Mason in southern Bougainville were especially important to the Americans because they were very well placed to give warnings.\n\nLieut. Read was in the best position to warn of impending enemy air attacks on Guadalcanal and Tulagi, giving two hours advance notice. The importance of this was noted by an historian of the coastwatching operations:\n\nThis lengthy warning enabled the various Allied commands to prepare accordingly. Shipping could be dispersed from highly vulnerable concentrated areas to widely scattered positions of maximum safety. And fighter aircraft had time to be fuelled, armed, and dispatched to high altitudes—ready to pounce on the attacking force. In addition, naval warships were able to form a defensive antiaircraft perimeter around the beachhead. The element of surprise—the best weapon in any assault—was taken away from the Japanese. That meant that coast watching alone was responsible for the success of the air war.\n\nPaul Edward Mason, overlooking Buin in south Bougainville, was in an excellent position to report ship movements. Extracts from Jane's Fighting Ships were air-dropped to him, enabling Mason to send very accurate identifications. Messages were kept short and simple. For example, on August 7th 1942, after spotting enemy aircraft heading for Guadalcanal, Mason signalled:\n\nFrom STO. Twenty-four torpedo-bombers headed yours.\n\nThe code-name STO used the initials of Mason's married sister. With this warning, all but one of the Japanese aircraft were shot down and no American or Australian ships were damaged. On another occasion, Mason reported at least sixty-one Japanese ships heading for Guadalcanal. So vital was their contribution that Admiral William 'Bull' Halsey, United States Navy commander of the forces retaking the Solomons, declared: 'The Coastwatchers saved Guadalcanal and Guadalcanal saved the Pacific'.\n\nBy February 1943, the American forces were in control of Guadalcanal. Many of the 13000 Japanese troops withdrawn from the Guadalcanal area ended up on Bougainville and Buka Islands. This would rise to over 60,000.\n\nPNG, Bougainville, New Britain and the Solomons. Map: Google\n\nIn May 1943, a plan to cover the whole of Bougainville with Coast Watchers was implemented. This included:\n\nKeenan - north of Porapora\n\nRead and Robinson - Central east\n\nSgt. McPhee - West coast\n\nPaul Edward Mason and Stevenson - South end\n\nMason and Stevenson's party included:-\n\n- 8 soldiers\n\n- Usaia\n\n- William McNicol\n\n- 10 native police\n\nOn Saturday 26 June 1943, Stevenson's party was attacked by a Japanese patrol. Stevenson was killed with the first shot. The rest of the party fought back killing five Japanese. They retreated with their weapons only. They came across one of the natives who had led the Japanese to their camp, and immediately executed him. They caught up with Mason's party the next day with the Japanese still on their trail. They were short on supplies and supply drops were again out of the question.\n\nAt this time a decision was made to evacuate all Coast Watchers off Bougainville, due to the recent relentless Japanese activity to locate them. Mason was ordered to join McPhee on the north west coast. They had to follow the west coast as the east coast was swarming with Japanese.\n\nIn June and July, the Americans had landed in the New Georgia island group and captured four airfields, all in Allied fighter range of Bougainville. [8.]\n\nSome details of those incidents, actions and forays which Gerald McPhee was a part of can be glimpsed through the records made by others:\n\nJuly 1943:\n\nUS Navy Submarine USS Guardfish (SS-217) operated out of the Brisbane Submarine Base during WW2. USS Guardfish left Pearl Harbor on January 2nd 1943 to patrol off the Truk area. She sank a Japanese patrol vessel, a 1,300 ton cargo ship and the Japanese destroyer Hakaze on January 23rd 1943. She moved south and attacked a large convoy near Simpson Harbor, Rabaul. The Japanese defences were so fierce that USS Guardfish was forced to leave the area. USS Guardfish arrived at Capricorn Wharf in Brisbane on February 15th 1943 ending her 3rd war patrol.\n\nUSS Guardfish left Brisbane on March 9th 1943 for her 4th War Patrol in the Bismarck Sea, Solomon Islands and New Guinea area. She returned to Brisbane on April 30th 1943, after a very quiet patrol with no recoded kills.\n\nUSS Guardfish's 5th War Patrol found her returning to the same area. She left Brisbane on May 2nd 1943. She sank the 201 ton Japanese freighter, Suzuya Maru and damaged another freighter. USS Guardfish together with US Navy Subchaser SC 761, was instrumental in rescuing a large number of Australian and New Zealand Coast Watchers from Bougainville in July 1943. She returned to Capricorn Wharf in Brisbane on August 2nd 1943 for a long needed refit. [3.]\n\nExtract from the book, Save Our Souls: Rescues Made by U.S. Submarines During World War II By Douglas E. Campbell:\n\nUSS Guardfish went to Tulagi to prepare for and execute special tasks. She arrived at Tulagi on July 14th 1943 and underway a week later, with air cover, for her special mission.\n\nUnder cover of darkness, on 24 July, GUARDFISH surfaced at Atsinima Bay on Bougainville Island and evacuated a total of 62 personnel - 22 Australian commandos, two remaining survivors from a downed Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) PBY Catalina (SGT Frederick Gordon Thompson and Corporal Ronald Alexander Wettenhall), seven Chinese nationals who had been hiding in the hills, one Fijian, 9 native police officers with their 15 scouts and two native wives with a child each, and two coast watchers — John Robert Keenan and LT Paul Edward Allen Mason.\n\nThe 22 Australian commandos evacuated from Bougainville were:\n\nStaff Sergeant Bertram Louis Cohen (VX117350, M Special Unit)\n\nSergeant John Methven Collier (SX1013, 2/48th Infantry Battalion)\n\nSergeant Harold Joseph Broadfoot (QX38133, M Special Unit)\n\nActing Sergeant Vivian Morris Day (VX74803, was stationed at the Australian Jungle Training Centre when discharged from the Army)\n\nActing Sergeant Gerald Joseph McPhee (NX151510, M Special Unit)\n\nActing Sergeant Walter Allan Percy Radimey (NX44839, 1 Independent Company)\n\nActing Sergeant Alan Stratford Hatherly (NX110237, 1 New Guinea Infantry Battalion)\n\nActing Sergeant Kenneth Harry Thorpe (QX28945, 1 New Guinea Infantry Battalion)\n\nActing Sergeant Frederick James Furner (NX394418, unknown station)\n\nActing Corporal Noel Lancelot McLeod (NX49729, Z Special Unit)\n\nActing Corporal Alan Russell Little (NX18815, HQ 1 Australian AA Bde Sigs)\n\nSignaller Alan Maitland Falls (NX84318, stationed at District Accounts Office, New South Wales, Australia when discharged)\n\nSignaller Ronald Joseph Cream (WX13199, Z Special Unit)\n\nSignaller Gordon Rex Kotz (SX11395, 2/3 Field Regiment)\n\nSignaller Ernest John Parker Rust (NX127852, Z Special Unit)\n\nSignaller Albert Edward Eastlake (VX89256, M Special Unit)\n\nSapper Bernard Michael Bastick (NX86844, M Special Unit)\n\nSapper George Maxwell McKenzie (NX139989, was with the 1st Australian M T Workshops, Australian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (AEME), upon discharge)\n\nSapper Stanley Gage (NX110501, was with the 14th Australian Wks & Pk Squadron, British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF), upon discharge)\n\nSapper Denzil Kenneth Ayliffe (NX92192, M Special Unit)\n\nPrivate Stanley Stonehouse (V X146945, was with the 24th Infantry Battalion upon discharge)\n\nPrivate H.

Chin Yung’s wife and their 6 children had been evacuated by GATO on March 29th 1943. Hee You’s wife and their 3 children had also been evacuated by GATO on March 29th as had Wong Tu’s wife and daughter.\n\nWith them safely aboard, she put out to sea to transfer the evacuees to an American sub-chaser, SC-761. SC 761 left USS Guardfish at 0540 hrs and headed for Guadalcanal. The 59 passengers were very hungry and tired. The Commander of SC 761, Lt. Ronald B. Balcom, USNR, asked \"Frenchie\" their cook, to feed their hungry guests. The ship was overstocked with Salmon which they were always required to draw from stores at their Naval supply facility. The crew of SC 761 were sick of Salmon, so \"Frenchie\" took this opportunity to reduce their stocks. John Keenan offered some of his Chinese to assist in the galley. Using hand signals \"Frenchie\" to communicate with the Chinese, they served up several cases of Salmon and large helpings of rice. After this hearty meal, the Chinese meticulously cleaned the galley, and all the plates and cooking and eating utensils. They even cleaned the aft crew quarters where many of them had eaten. \"Frenchie\" would loved to have kept a few of these Chinese in his galley for the rest of the war.\n\nLt. Comdr. John R. Keenan consumed a pot of hot tea while he relived some of his experiences on Bougainville. The Japanese would constantly track them while they were broadcasting with their teleradios, so they were constantly on the move to avoid capture. The Coast Watchers had their photograph taken on the forecastle of SC 761 after they had showered, shaved and eaten. Lt. Cmdr. Keenan advised that he had lost two men who were captured by the Japanese and thereupon beheaded.

Item USMC 69275, Official U.S. Navy Photograph\n\nDecember 1944:\n\nNeither were supply drops without risk for the aircrews. In his report from central Bougainville, Flight Lieutenant N C Sandford, 2 DK patrol, described a supply drop that went badly wrong on December 19th 1944.\n\nOn 19 December, Lieut. Bridge was asked to prepare to receive a drop on the following day. A RNZAF (Royal New Zealand Air Force) Venture circled the area at 9.5am. The first run was made from the main range over the dropsite towards the sea but no cargo was released. The pilot then came in from the lower end of the valley and made his run towards the mountains. The aircraft made a good approach with wheels down and bomb bay doors open but cargo did not start to drop until the aircraft was over 400 yards (365 metres) past the dropsite. The cargo continued to fall in separate bundles for some time and no attempt seemed to be made to retract the wheels despite the fact that the aircraft was heading towards the main range at low altitude. The aircraft rose at the last moment and appeared to clear the range but suddenly the starboard wing rose sharply and the aircraft disappeared from sight. Shortly afterwards I heard the crash and almost immediately a dense black column of smoke appeared. I immediately took a bearing on the smoke then called to Lieutenant Bridge, who had remained in the camp area and so had not witnessed the crash that the aircraft had crashed some 3 or 4 miles (approximately 5-6 km) away on bearing 26oM. 2WA was advised and PB's were instructed to proceed with all speed possible to the scene of the crash. A second party under Sergeant McPhee was formed to take food and medicines to and bring out any survivors.\n\nAt 11.20 hours a note was received from the latter party advising that two of the airmen – Hobbs and Murphy – had been killed and that the others – Scarlett, Nuttal and Gardiner – were badly injured. 2WA was advised and a Doctor and drugs were requested. The rescue party arrived back at Aita at 18.00 hours with Nuttal, Gardiner and the body of Scarlett who had died as a result of extensive 3rd degree burns. Nuttal was the more seriously injured of the two survivors and, despite all we could do he died from shock consequent to extensive burns at 22.30 hours.\n\nGardiner, suffering from a fractured femur, burns and shock became delirious at 23.30 but responded to treatment and by morning I was able to pronounce him out of danger. On 21st December 1944 in response to a suggestion from DSIO Nor Sols Lieut. Bridge gave order that a small strip would be cleared and local natives were recruited to prepare the site selected. A burial party was sent to the scene of the crash to bury Hobbs and Murphy and salvage what confidential documents might be in the aircraft and ensure that the I.F.F. equipment was destroyed.\n\nScarlett and Nuttal were buried at Kushi village under a grove of breadfruit trees. On my return to the area in January 1945 I had two hardwood crosses suitably inscribed and erected over their graves. - [NAA Item 37A B3476, 'Report by Lieutenant N.C Sandford, 2 DK Patrol, Central Sector, Bougainville Island, 12.1.44 – 18.6.45]\n\nSandford's report continues that attempts to construct an airstrip and problems with aircraft led to Gardiner, now the only crash survivor, being evacuated on foot. On December 28th a stretcher party carried him overland from Aita to Kurnaio Mission where a barge transported the patient to Torokina. The party arrived there on January 1st 1945 and Sergeant Gardiner was flown to New Zealand the following day.

USMC photo\n\nWhen the Australians joined in the battle for Bougainville in late 1944, relieving the American garrison at Torokina, on Bougainville’s west coast, Lieutenant General Stanley Savige’s II Australian Corps (the 3rd Division, and the 11th and 23rd Brigades) were sent into three areas radiating from Torokina: the Central, Northern and Southern Sectors. In the Central Sector, the Australians followed the Numa Numa trail across the island’s mountainous spine to the east coast. In the Northern Sector, the Australians followed the north-west coast towards Buka. The advance went well until a small force made a disastrous amphibious landing at Porton Plantation in June 1945. The main fight, however, was in the Southern Sector, where the 3rd Division (the 7th, 15th and 29th Brigades) advanced towards Buin, the major Japanese base on the island. [9.]\n\nPatrolling was slow work due to the terrain and the danger; the maximum rate of advance was six minutes to cover 100 yards (about 90 metres). Patrolling was physically and mentally exhausting. Contacts with the enemy were frequently very close, only metres apart. Pre-existing tracks and clearings were considered “death traps” as the Japanese often prepared pillboxes with firing lanes for their machine-guns, and locations were pre-ranged for their artillery. They would set up ambushes to cover approaches to log crossings over creeks and other natural obstacles. The Australians advocated “scrub bashing” where possible, moving through the jungle rather than along tracks. “Leading and second scouts are suicide jobs,” a 24th Battalion report noted.\n\nOccupying and developing new defensive positions was accompanied by a frenzy of digging, cutting, and carrying. On taking a new position, soldiers and Bougainvilleans immediately began to dig weapon pits and sleeping bays, and to lay wire entanglements along the perimeter. Offices for the battalion headquarters, the signals office and equipment, as well as for stores and ammunition, were also dug underground. Tents erected within the perimeter were kept low to blend with the scrub. Signallers laid signal lines into the battalion headquarters and to each company. Reconnaissance patrols were sent out to the front and flanks, and forward listening posts were established.\n\nThe conditions were physically exhausting. In the damp jungle environment the men were always wet from rain, river and creek crossings, muddy tracks and perspiration. Uniforms would rot and boots would disintegrate. Equipment and stores become mouldy. Much had been done to combat malaria and other tropical diseases, but skin irritations and infections still occurred.\n\nOfficers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs) had to be mindful of their soldiers’ health and welfare. As there were so few men, responsibility for leading and conducting patrols fell upon the same junior officers, NCOs and soldiers time and again. There was no relief from stress and strain. Earlier in the campaign, morale almost collapsed in two battalions from the 7th Brigade, with soldiers refusing to patrol and men having mental breakdowns. These incidents were partly attributed to physical and mental exhaustion. New administrative policies were introduced to provide some respite to the front line, such as establishing rest areas closer to the front. Other techniques included enforcing discipline and hygiene, and ensuring soldiers received mail, tobacco, a warm meal, and water for bathing and washing clothes. Religious services and sport also contributed to maintaining morale. Corporal Davis thought the campaign “nerve wrecking” but “being busy kept us from our fears.” He also found solace in his religious faith. Private Lyne recalled instances of a few soldiers shooting themselves in the foot or hand “to get out of it”. Specific figures for what would be described as “psychiatric casualties” suffered by Australian forces on Bougainville were not systematically recorded. The 24th Battalion’s adjutant noted frankly:\n\nIt is not possible to weed out neurotic personnel and those who are NOT suited for operations on account of either temperament or just plain fear. A very small sprinkling of these can quickly spread the disease and it should be watched very closely and stamped out immediately. [9.]\n\nThe Australian Corps controlled about two-thirds of Bougainville when the war came to an end. Fifteen Australian infantry battalions served on Bougainville along with elements of the Papuan and the 1st New Guinea Infantry Battalions.\n\nFrom Bougainville’s pre-1942 population of 54,000 people, it is estimated that up to a quarter died during or because of the conflict. That's 13 thousand souls - a devastating number that impacted on every single family.\n\nMore than 30,000 Australians served on the island, 516 Australians died and 1,572 had been wounded. Between 1943 and 1945, more than 300 New Zealanders also lost their lives supporting the US and Australian campaigns.\n\nThe Australian War Memorial states about 65,000 Japanese occupied the island when the Americans arrived in 1943; at surrender, there were just over 23,800. The Australians had killed 8,789 Japanese during the nine-month campaign, and the Americans estimated they had killed about 9,890. Thousands more Japanese soldiers died from sickness, disease and starvation.\n\nA Japanese memorial to the dead located near the former Japanese naval headquarters at Buin on the island of Bougainville, September 28th, 1945. A memorial stone (right) is surrounded by wooden grave markers commemorating the names of individual soldiers and sailors. Four bowls on the shrine contain food and water. It is unlikely that any remains or ashes were actually buried here as the Japanese, who traditionally cremated their dead, usually sent the ashes of the fallen back to their families in Japan or stored them until such time as it was possible to do so. Image courtesy Australian War Memorial.\n\nThose Australians who died in the fighting in Papua and Bougainville are buried in the Port Moresby (Bomana) War Cemetery, their graves brought in by the Australian Army Graves Service from burial grounds in the areas where the fighting had taken place.\n\nThe unidentified soldiers of the United Kingdom forces were all from the Royal Artillery, captured by the Japanese at the fall of Singapore; they died in captivity and were buried on the island of Bailale in the Solomons. These men were later re-buried in a temporary war cemetery at Torokina on Bougainville Island before being transferred to their permanent resting place at Port Moresby.\n\nThe cemetery contains 3,824 Commonwealth burials of the Second World War, 699 of them unidentified. Over 600 Indian soldiers who fought in the Second World War are buried at the cemetery. There is also 1 Non war and 1 Dutch Foreign National burials here.\n\nThe Port Moresby Memorial stands behind the cemetery and commemorates almost 750 men of the Australian Army (including Papua and New Guinea local forces), the Australian Merchant Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force who lost their lives in the operations in Papua and who have no known graves. Men of the Royal Australian Navy who died in the south-west Pacific region, and have no known grave but the sea, are commemorated on the Plymouth Naval Memorial in England, along with many of their comrades of the Royal Navy and of other Commonwealth Naval Forces. Bougainville casualties who have no known graves are commemorated on a memorial at Suva, Fiji.\n\nAt least 321 allied airmen and 280 US sailors were rescued by Coast Watchers behind enemy lines during the Solomon Islands Campaign (Feldt The Coastwatchers, p.153), and there were many others saved and evacuated from New Britain. Other statistics collated show Coast Watchers rescued 75 POW's, 190 Missionaries, 260 Chinese people and countless Papua New Guineans and Island peoples - they left no one behind; if there was room on the deck of a ship or submarine, they loaded them up and got them the hell out of there.\n\nPerhaps the most famous of those rescued by the Coast Watchers was US Navy Lieutenant John F. Kennedy, who later became 35th President of the United States. After his patrol torpedo boat was sunk in the Solomons, and Kennedy and his crew reached Kolombangara Island, they were found by Coastwatcher Sub-Lieutenant Arthur 'Reg' Evans who arranged their rescue. Biuku Gasa (27 July 1923 – 23 November 2005) and Eroni Kumana (c. 1918 – 2 August 2014) were Solomon Islanders of Melanesian descent, who were sent out by Evans and found John F. Kennedy and his surviving PT-109 crew following the boat's collision with the Japanese destroyer Amagiri near Plum Pudding Island on August 1st 1943. They were from the Western Province of the Solomon Islands. President Kennedy later welcomed Evans as his guest at the White House.\n\nImage: President John F.

He was finally officially discharged on September 29th, 1946, having served for 48 months, or 60 months if you include his pre 1941, aged 21, enlistment in the AMF.\n\nGerald was busy heading back to New Guinea prior to that official demobilisation though. Rabaul had been destroyed by the offensive actions taken by the Japanese and then the Australians and Americans in retaking the place. It needed rebuilding and for its pre-war produce to once again flow and provide for those at PNG as well as where it was sent. Copra was one of the main exports.\n\nThe last page of his war record shows:\n\nBy Feb 6-8, 1946, he arrived back via Qantas airlines as Captain McPhee and was definitely there again by late October 1946: by Qantas as part of the ANGPCB [Australian New Guinea Production Control Board] - Staff - McPhee, Gerald J [0.5cm] Contents date range; 1946 - 1947\n\nQantas flight in: OCT. 23; Mr. R.

He returned to Bougainville and the New Ireland area.\n\nGerald was alike other Australians who went to New Guinea after WWII - some because they 'could not settle' after all they had experienced - Walter 'Wal' Williams stated this was what he did; went to New Guinea [7.]. Others, like Gerald, returned because what they fell in love with the place, its peoples, the freedoms and the opportunities available. He had, after all, spent some of his most dangerous times in his then short life with the real New Guinea and Bougainville peoples on their trails through their places, and had come from a farming family. This would persist throughout his life - this love of the outdoors and growing produce.\n\nIn June 1948 he was heading back to Sydney:\n\nLate DLO at Manus, Mr. G.

Traditionally, the coconuts are sun-dried, especially for export, before the oil, also known as copra oil, is pressed out. The oil extracted from copra is rich in lauric acid, making it an important commodity in the preparation of lauryl alcohol, soaps, fatty acids, cosmetics, etc. and thus a lucrative product for many coconut-producing countries. The palatable oil cake, known as copra cake, obtained as a residue in the production of copra oil is used in animal feeds. The ground cake is known as coconut or copra meal.\n\nIn 1884, German settlers arrived in eastern New Guinea (now Papua New Guinea), and planted Coconut palms (Cocos nucifera) for the production of copra, the dried flesh of the coconut. They established the colony of German New Guinea in the north eastern quarter of the island and numerous coconut plantations around coastal areas. They were afraid of venturing too far inland. To counter the growing German presence in the region, the Australian state of Queensland established the Territory of Papua as a de facto possession covering approximately the south east third of the island. Both the Queensland and German plantations thrived, providing opulent living conditions for the expatriates. Grand mansions were built on the plantations, complete with luxury furnishings. Much of the labour was performed by New Guinea natives. The towns of Port Moresby and Rabaul were founded as a result of the economic activity surrounding the plantations.\n\nIn 1914, Australia sent a small military force to capture the towns of Kokopo and Rabaul. Two Germans were killed in the process, while the remaining German plantation owners were initially sent back to work on their plantations. The 1919 Treaty of Versailles saw Germany lose all its overseas colonies, including German New Guinea. It became the Territory of New Guinea, a League of Nations Mandate Territory under Australian administration.\n\nKokopo is the capital of East New Britain in Papua New Guinea. The capital was moved from Rabaul in 1994 when the volcanoes Tavurvur and Vulcan erupted. Kokopo was known as Herbertshöhe during the German New Guinea administration which controlled the area between 1884 and 1914.

There was not much to develop in the Solomons then —copra was not greatly in demand—but a good type of planter was at least assisted to make his home there.\n\nTo-day, there appears to be nearly double the pre-war number of public servants in BSI; but the production of copra —in quantity—is probably no more than half the pre-war volume. The Administration’s pre-war policy of encouraging private enterprise has been replaced by a laissez-faire attitude that is taken to mean that, while officialdom is indifferent about the condition of non-official Europeans, it is intensely pre-occupied with native welfare.\n\nThe net result, of course, is seen in three things—discontented and resentful Europeans, spoiled natives and a heavy additional burden upon the British taxpayer. Only a handfull of the planters and traders who were driven out by the war have returned to the Solomons.\n\nIn some respects, conditions in BSI are almost a duplicate of conditions in Papua-New Guinea. In the latter country, the Socialist policy, directed from Canberra, discourages private enterprise, spoils the natives, makes non-official Europeans non-co-operative and resentful, and throws an enormously increased burden upon the Australian exchequer. Before the war, Papua-New Guinea was almost self-supporting, and BSI was only a little less so.\n\nIN a comparison, however, the planters who have returned to the Solomons are worse off than the Australian non-officials in Papua-New Guinea.\n\nThe Australians got war damage compensation from a fund created for that purpose in war-time; BSI got nothing at all. The Australians escape taxation — although they are heavily taxed through import duties —but they lose from £10 to £I2A per ton on their copra. The latter is taken from them by Canberra as (a) export tax and (b) some mysterious deduction —which Canberra so far has refused to explain—called “stabilisation fund.” The BSI planters have to pay an export tax; and, also, they are savagely mulcted in income tax. It is only 1/3 in the £ on the first £1,500 of income; but, after that, the rise is so steep that, around £5,000, a big trader can lose a large part of his income.\n\nThe collection of income tax in BSI — something new since the war —is an evil imposition. Income tax should be imposed only when the citizen receives, from his government, substantial amenities and encouragement. BSI is such a primitive country that it gives its European residents practically nothing in the way of amenities —someone said lately that “The BSI, to-day, is at the same stage of development as England was in the time of the Romans.”\n\n\"WE are so sick of administrative pin-pricks, and official indifference to European welfare, that we should welcome any move for transfer to Australian government,” said a BSI planter recently. “We pay an import tax of 17per cent, an export tax of 15 per cent, on our copra, and now we are faced with heavy income tax.”\n\nOther residents say that, although non-officials, who lost everything, get no war- damage compensation at all, all officials who were affected by the Jap invasion have been given, secretly, a sum of £5O each, as compensation for the loss of their personal effects.\n\nIt is anticipated that there soon will be a new Resident Commissioner in the Solomons (Mr. Noel, who has been away on long leave, is not expected to return, and Mr. A. Germond, MBE. has been acting RC); but no change in policy is expected while the Socialists rule Britain.\n\nLAST TWO JAPS\n\nGive Themselves Up At Saidor, NG\n\nFrom Our Own Correspondent PORT MORESBY, Sept. 6.\n\nTWO Japanese walked into the Government post at Saidor, northern New Guinea, a few days ago, after having lived among the natives of that area for five years without being discovered. The natives sheltered them, and never once mentioned their presence to Government officers, who patrol the area regularly.\n\nWhen they gave themselves up the Japs were barefooted, and their clothing was falling to pieces; but, apart from slight malnutrition, their health was good.\n\nSpeaking in Pidgin English they told their story yesterday to District Officer J. K. McCarthy, at Madang, where they were taken from Saidor by trawler.\n\nThey said they deserted their unit during the Japanese retreat and joined tribes in the Saruwaget Range, inland from Saidor. After several months they threw away their weapons and went completely native, hunting native fashion and growing native foods. A native medical orderly supplied them with quinine and other drugs. They said their friends had told them the war was over but they were too frightened to emerge from hiding until a few days ago.\n\nOn Thursday, they will be flown to Manus to join the Japanese war criminals who are imprisoned there.\n\nSeventeen Japs have now given themselves up in the Madang area since the war ended and, according to these last two, there are no more in hiding.\n\nPacific islands monthly : PIM.

He became one of the outstanding rubber planters of the Territory, and a prominent and highly-respected citizen. He was remarkably successful, not only in caring for his plantations, but in handling native labour. Mrs. McKenna pre-deceased him (in 1940). His son, Mr. Jack McKenna, lives in Papua.

They included RAAF, AIF, RAN, 1 WRAN, (Women's Royal Australian Naval Officer) US Marines and US Army personnel, members of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate Defence Force and 13 civilians. The thirty eight Coastwatchers who died are not always identifiable on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial since their names are listed with their operational units and not as Coastwatchers. [6.]\n\nAlthough the 'Special Units M and Z' were disbanded after the Second World War, many of the training techniques and operational procedures employed were later used during the formation of other Australian Army special forces units and they remain a model for guerrilla operations to this day.\n\nIt may seem surreal that one of these brave men must have played at Mona Vale as a teenager, or at least visited during the time between when his mother bought La Corniche in 1935 and when he was seconded into the first Australian commando units. Gerald Joseph McPhee's dedication to his country and willingness to go it alone and keep going 'back in' while still a young man is proof that all of us have the capability to be extraordinary when that is required, and return to doing what we know afterwards. His is just one of those many stories that was hidden in the archives.\n\nTo we who have inherited a place where we may live in freedom the work undertaken by these men, many in their early 20's, behind enemy lines, remains the stuff of legends.\n\nreferences - Notes\n\nSave Our Souls: Rescues Made by U.S. Submarines During World War II By Douglas E.

Campbell: ''At last count, nearly 2,400 people can claim that their lives were saved by a U.S. submarine during World War II. Of that number, 523 Allied aviators could claim that distinction after crashing their aircraft into the sea and being saved by a submarine operating in the “Lifeguard League.” The remaining number were a collection of other military and civilian personnel, each with a story to tell and now able to tell their grand-children. Some of those rescued went on to retire as senior military officers including U.S. Navy Admirals, some back to missionary work, some to manage large companies in later years, some to philanthropic endeavours to pay everyone back for saving their lives. Appendix A is an intensely-researched index of nearly 2,200 names of those saved.''\n\nCaptain Rolf Charles Cambridge, AIF was a Plantation Inspector pre WWII and managed a plantation on North Bougainville in July 1937.\n\nDate of birth - 11 Aug 1901 : Place of birth - WINDSOR NSW.

He too returned to New Guinea after the war.\n\nAIB: Allied Intelligence Bureau (Second World War)\n\nThe Allied Intelligence Bureau (AIB) was a joint United States, Australian, Dutch and British intelligence and special operations agency during World War II. It was responsible for operating parties of spies and commandos behind Japanese lines in order to collect intelligence and conduct guerrilla warfare against Japanese forces in the South West Pacific. The AIB was formed in June 1942 to coordinate the existing Allied propaganda and guerrilla organisations. The first controller of the AIB was Colonel C. G. Roberts. At its peak the AIB contained men from ten individual services and controlled or coordinated eight separate organisations. The role of the AIB was to obtain information about the enemy, \"to weaken the enemy by sabotage and destruction of morale and to lend aid and assistance to local effort to the same end in enemy territories.\" One member of the AIB was Alfred Deakin Brookes, who went on to become the first head of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service in May 1952.\n\nThe AIB was divided into four sections; A, B, C and D each focused on a specific area of operations:\n\nA Section: A Section was made up of Special Operations Australia, which was later known as the Services Reconnaissance Department, and focused on information collection and commando operations. A Section was initially commanded by Major G. Egerton Mott.\n\nB Section: B Section focused on secret intelligence and was commanded by Captain R. Kendall, RN, known as Secret Intelligence Australia (SIA)\n\nC Section: C Section gathered field intelligence through Coast Watchers, natives and civilians. C Section was commanded by Commander Eric Feldt, RANVR.\n\nD Section: D Section was the Far Eastern Liaison Office which was concerned with propaganda and was commanded by Commander J. C. Proud, RANVR.\n\nThe AIB was disbanded at the end of the war. - From AWM\n\nAfter training on Fraser Island in 1943, M Special Unit soon deployed where they operated in both the Solomon Islands and New Guinea conducting intelligence operations against the Japanese. In late 1943 the unit was split into smaller units code named ‘Whiting’ and ‘Locust’ where both units continued to collect intelligence. Generally, a very successful unit the consequences for those captured by the enemy were severve as demonstrated by the most infamous member of “M” Special Unit Sergeant Leonard Siffleet who was executed by Japanese forces via beheading.\n\nLeonard George Siffleet (14 January 1916 – 24 October 1943) was an Australian commando of World War II. Born in Gunnedah, New South Wales, he joined the Second Australian Imperial Force in 1941, and by 1943 had reached the rank of sergeant. Posted to M Special Unit of the Services Reconnaissance Department, Siffleet was on a mission in Papua New Guinea when he and two Ambonese companions were captured by partisan tribesmen and handed over to the Japanese. All three men were interrogated, tortured and later beheaded. A photograph of Siffleet's impending execution became an enduring image of the war, and his identity was often confused with that of other servicemen who suffered a similar fate, in particular Flight Lieutenant Bill Newton.\n\nLeonard George Siffleet was born on 14 January 1916 in Gunnedah, New South Wales. The son of an itinerant worker of Dutch ancestry, his siblings included a sister and two brothers. Siffleet made his way to Sydney in the late 1930s, seeking to join the police force, but was prevented from doing so because of his eyesight. He was nevertheless called up for the militia in August 1940, and attached to a searchlight unit at RAAF Station Richmond.\n\nDischarged from the militia after three months, Siffleet returned to his family to help look after his young brothers following their mother's death. He was working as a shop assistant when he enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF) in September 1941. Allotted to a signals company based at Ingleburn, New South Wales, he was reported absent without leave on two occasions; he was by this time engaged to Clarice Lane.\n\nAfter training in radio communications at Melbourne Technical College, Siffleet volunteered for special operations in September 1942 and was posted to the Services Reconnaissance Department (SRD) of the Allied Intelligence Bureau in Melbourne. He joined Z Special Unit in October and was transferred to Cairns in Far North Queensland for further operational training. Assigned to the SRD's Dutch section as a radio operator, Siffleet was promoted to sergeant in May 1943. He moved across to M Special Unit the same month to take part in a mission to set up a coast watching station in the hills behind Hollandia in Netherlands New Guinea. Described by Commander Eric Feldt, director of the Coast Watchers, as \"the best type of N.C.O. of the A.I.F., young and competent\", Siffleet joined a party led by Sergeant H. N. Staverman of the Royal Netherlands Navy, which included two Ambonese privates, H. Pattiwal and M. Reharing. Code-named Operation Whiting, their task was to work in concert with another group (Operation Locust), led by Lieutenant Jack Fryer.\n\nStaverman's reconnaissance group commenced its mission in north-east New Guinea in July, trekking across mountainous terrain through August and September. At some point Staverman and Pattiwal separated from the others to undertake further exploration of the countryside, and were ambushed by a group of natives. Both were captured and reported as killed, but Pattiwal later escaped and rejoined Siffleet and Reharing. Siffleet signalled Fryer to warn him of the hostile natives and of Japanese patrols, indicating that he was preparing to burn his party's codes and bury its radio. No more was heard from them after early October. Clarice Lane (incorrectly addressed as \"Clemice\" Lane) had in the meantime received two letters from the Allied Intelligence Bureau in July and September, stating that Siffleet was \"safe and well\".\n\nAfter Pattiwal rejoined Siffleet and Reharing, they attempted to make their way to the Dutch border. They were ambushed by a hundred native villagers near Aitape and, after a brief mêlée during which Siffleet shot and wounded one of their attackers, th"
