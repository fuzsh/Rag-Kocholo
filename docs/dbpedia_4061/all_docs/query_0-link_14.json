        "text": "Preamble: (added in July 2019) I am somewhat amazed to note that after 2.5 years there is an average of 20 clicks daily as people continue to access this website and that I continue to receive occasional feedback from interested readers!\n\nIn this respect, on 20 June 2019 I received an email from Dave Morgan, the great nephew of Capt. H.A.J. (Jack) Fryer, who had led several coastwatching missions through New Guinea during the war, including one to the Idenberg River off the Sepik River, in January 1943. Dave sent me considerable documentation and a number of photos.\n\nCoincidentally, whilst we all had mates in the Army, my ‘special’ mate Sgt. Les ‘Tas’ Baillie, with whom I’d worked at Nadzab and Madang, was the radio operator in Fryer’s party.\n\nMoreover, and again coincidentally, I had already received a long-distance telephone call, following a letter of 5 June 2018, from Lcdr (Rtd.) Louis A. Conter in the USA, who was a Catalina pilot who dropped off and picked up some of our Coastwatchers on the Sepik!\n\nLou had been in touch to express his gratitude: ‘I am extremely thankful to you for all the intelligence you Coast Watchers supplied to us to help with the battle against the Japanese. It was one of the most dangerous missions we did…. I will never forget the landing and takeoff on the Sepik River with all the crocodiles and bugs and seeing the native tribes and their leaders.’\n\nAnyway, post-war the Baillie and Burrowes families kept up personal and holiday relationships, which included Diane, the daughter of Les, even following his passing in 1997 at the relatively young age of 74. Hence, on receiving the information and photos from Dave Morgan, I decided to send a copy of the email I’d received from Dave to Diane for her information.\n\nThis resulted in Diane sending me a copy of a detailed hand-written letter, with an almost diarised daily account of the ‘trials and tribulations’ of his coastwatching party, that Les had sent to the Department of Veterans Affairs. I believe this to be a rare detailed account of coastwatching as I am not aware of many other such detailed accounts by coastwatchers although, for example, Sandy McNab of the Ist Independent Company wrote his memoirs in his book We were the first: The unit history of No 1 Independent Company, Jack Fryer kept considerable records and Guy Black wrote an account.\n\nFor authentification, I have included an extract of Tas Baillie’s hand-written paragraphs hereunder followed by a typed transcript (for ease of reading) of his account of his coastwatching service (which followed brief stints elsewhere in the military forces), illustrated with photos, detailing their hazardous mission in enemy territory.\n\nI trust you find this of interest.\n\nJim Burrowes\n\nI travelled from Melbourne to Cairns by train, picking up another signaller from the course [we had just attended at the Melbourne Technical College, concentrating on the ATR4 radio] L.G. Siffleet who was beheaded by the Japanese just over 12 months later [see photo below], and a Javanese naval rating….\n\nNot long after my arrival in Cairns I was allocated to Locust Party to operate behind enemy lines in New Guinea. Other members were the leader Lt. H.A.J. Fryer, Lt. H. Aiken, and Lt. G. Black. A while later, Sig. L.G. Siffleet was added to a Dutch party code named ‘Whiting’….\n\nMy time at the ‘House on the Hill’ in Cairns until 10th December 1942 was spent as a wireless operator working regular shifts and preparing the radio equipment to be transported by native carriers in New Guinea. Included in the tasks was the calculation and cutting of the aerial to be used with the transmitter. I also had to mix the oil and petrol to be used by the two stroke battery charger.\n\nBoth parties left Cairns by train to Townsville on 10th December 1942 and embarked on the troopship ‘Duntroon’ for Port Moresby and arrived there on 23rd December 1942. During our time there the Japs raided the town twice by air on Christmas and New Year’s Eve.\n\nAlthough the area to be covered by the two parties extended from Hollandia to Wewak, because of the war situation at the time it was only possible to get to air transport as far as Bena Bena, about one day’s walk from Goroka. Bena Bena has since disappeared from the maps but Garoka has developed into a town.\n\nThe two parties arrived at Bena Bena on the 17 January 1943 and began the long trek the next day along a track that had only been opened up ten years before in 1933 by Europeans. The going was quite good and we reached Mt Hagen, the last outpost, after about a week. After Mt Hagen the trail to Wabag was much more difficult and, as far as I can recollect, about a two day journey crossing the mountains at 10,000 feet. I cannot forget the date of our arrival at Wabag as it was my 20th birthday, 5th February 1943, and I spent a most miserable day walking with an unknown tropical fever.\n\nFrom Wabag to the Sepik River the area was largely unexplored, and uninhabited except for a small settlement one day’s walk from Wabag. The conditions for movement past this point were most difficult: extremely muddy steep ascents followed immediately after by worst descents. After walking for 8 hours a day very little distance would be travelled in a straight line.\n\nA little over half way we met a party of civilians who were endeavouring to make their way to Mt Hagen after fleeing from Wewak after the Japs landed there about Christmas time 1942. Two of their number, a miner named McGregor and a Chinaman named Ah Soong, decided to throw in their lot with us and come back.\n\nFinally, after what seemed an age we reached one of the tributaries of the Sepik and were able to use the launch for a short time which the party from Wewak had used. From Wabag, because of conditions under which we travelled, both parties travelled independently. It was quite a task moving all the gear across such terrible country.\n\nMore civilians were met up with and instructions given which enabled them to find their way back to Mt Hagen and safety although their location and the presence of both our parties were passed on to the Japs by a German missionary with the result that enemy patrol activity in the area increased.\n\nEarly in March 1943 changes in the war situation resulted in the need for urgent information of the Jap forces in the Wewak area. By now the position as regards air transport had improved and a party of 4 under the command of Lt. L. Ashton plus 4 natives was landed in the Sepik River by Catalina. They managed to penetrate to within 20 miles of Wewak before deciding to withdraw back to the Sepik because of the hostility of the local natives who were informing the Japs of their movements. They had only travelled a day when they were surprised by a strong Jap patrol as they rested in a native hut. Escaping by the back door they fled into the surrounding bush, one member becoming separated. The decision of all was the same – make it back to the Sepik.\n\nNews reached us that one of our parties was in trouble and also that there was an ANGAU (Australian New Guinea Administration Unit) patrol operating in the area. Lt. Fryer and myself (not Lt. Black as stated by Commander Eric Feldt in his book The Coast Watchers) left the others and travelled quickly in an endeavour to reach our comrades. From another German missionary, a Father Hansen, who was subsequently executed, we learnt of the whereabouts of the Ashton party who by this time had been reunited.\n\nWe located them sheltering in a native village at nightfall a couple of days later, most relieved that is was a friendly patrol. After advising Port Moresby they were alright, we handed them over to the ANGAU patrol which arrived later and later arranged for their evacuation together with the miner McGregor who, as a First World War veteran, was finding the going too tough and our rations too sparse.\n\nBy this time it was the end of April and it was particularly galling to find that while we were slogging our way across what was probably the most difficult terrain and virtually unexplored territory in New Guinea, two parties had been landed by Catalina in a journey of a few hours that had taken us three months to cover. It was decided that we should push on with the original intention of conveying the Dutch party to the border of Papua/New Guinea and Dutch New Guinea to operate in the Hollandia area.\n\nWe found the travelling conditions much better after crossing the mountains and reaching one of the tributaries of the Sepik. Travel by foot was easier than we had experienced apart from the track from Bena Bena to Mt Hagen at the beginning. We had the use of a launch for a while and we were able to travel a considerable distance by native canoe reaching Lumi in the southern foothills of the Terricelli Mountains on 10th June 1943.\n\nIt was at Lumi where further supplies were dropped including an ATR4 transceiver using a dry battery as a power source as a backup should the rather unreliable battery charger pack up or we could not get the rather necessary fuel supplies. We were able to rest after the long arduous journey during the course of which I had suffered several bouts of malaria.\n\nOn 7 July 1943 both parties set out from Lumi, the Dutch party moving west towards Hollandia and the party I was with eastward toward the Wewak area, our original destination.\n\nDuring this period, the natives we encountered were becoming more hostile, threatening to inform the Japs of our presence. It was becoming extremely difficult to recruit carriers to transport our supplies, radio equipment including battery charger plus fuel, from village to village. We only had a small number of carriers who had come with us from the highlands. In order to improve our mobility, much to my relief, it was decided to dump the original wireless equipment and battery charger in favour of the ATR4 which worked quite well except for one occasion when there was a short in the battery lead and every valve was blown. It was a painstaking job to transfer the separate wires from a spare lead which was meant to be used with individual batteries to the plug from the old lead. There was no margin for error as I only had one spare set of valves.\n\nTension in the area had increased because of the threat of Jap reprisals, Fryer and Aiken were attacked by pro-Jap natives in a village, the Dutch party met with disaster and Jap patrol activity increased.\n\nI was struck down at this time with a fever which I suspect was Dengue. I was in a feverish state for 9 days only leaving my bed to make my daily call to Port Moresby. Fortunately, on the 10th day the fever had gone as two old natives, communicating by sign language, told us that a Jap patrol was coming. We immediately broke camp and quit the area.\n\nIn order to give us and a F.E.L.O. (Far East Liaison Office) operator in the West Sepik some measure of protection it was decided to land a force of 75 about 200 miles from its mouth. Unfortunately, the site selected could be reached by barge with the resultant Jap attack which was beaten off. Aiken and I were in the camp waiting to be evacuated back to Port Moresby when it was bombed and strafed by two Jap planes. I was extremely lucky as a burst of machine gun fire hit the track in front of me flinging mud back in my face. A few days later we were picked up by Catalina flying boat and flown back to Port Moresby on 10th December 1943. I arrived home on leave on 23rd December.\n\nI might add at this stage that for my service I was Mentioned in Despatches (Commonwealth Gazette 6 March 1947).\n\nOn returning from Leave I spent two months at the Allied Intelligence Bureau (AIB) training camp near Beaudesert, Queensland before leaving on 17 March 1944 by Catalina with an officer and two other sig. Sergeants to fly to a Dutch camp on the Idenberg River some miles south of Hollandia. Our purpose was to establish a radio station to relay messages from an AIB party to be landed by submarine prior to the American landing.\n\nThe hygiene conditions at this camp were abysmal and the food terrible. At one stage dysentery raged through the camp and I was the only one of our party not afflicted, although I now have no doubt that it was at this time I was infected but it did not cause dysentery. Positive tests for amoebic dysentery did not show up until November 1952.\n\nMy time on the Idenberg River was spent on routine wireless operator duties working to a F.E.L.O. patrol which landed on the Catalina with us and waiting to establish contact with the party to be landed on the coast, which again turned out to be a disaster in the Hollandia area with 5 out of the 11 who landed being killed.\n\nSome time after the American landing on 21st April 1944 we were flown out to Hollandia where I was interviewed by an intelligence officer investigating the execution of Sgt. Siffleet. From there I was flown to Nadzab where I worked as a wireless operator for 4 months before having a short stint at our radio station on Biak Island. During my time at Nadzab, I had a number of bouts of fever, on one occasion spending a week in hospital.\n\nThe last part of 1944 and early 1945 I spent at our station at Madang under quite good conditions as regards to climate and food, as a consequence of which my health improved markedly.\n\nAfter leave in February 1945 and a Sig. Operating Procedure Course in March I was despatched to Tol on New Britain with the purpose of joining the party we had overlooking Rabaul. On arrival at Tol I agreed to swap places with a wireless operator I had served with at Madang and who had had no operational experience. Again, at Tol the climate and conditions were good.\n\nFollowing the end of the war we were brought back to Australia very quickly and on my return to Hobart in November 1945 I was attached to the Unit Stores Accounting Section to await discharge.\n\nUnfortunately, because Malaria was looked upon as similar to a cold or headache and could be treated by self-medication, I did not seek any treatment from the Repatriation Department until 1952. As the standard treatment did not appear to be effective I approached a local GP who I knew was a Repat Doctor to see if I could get the latest treatment for Malaria. He arranged for me to be admitted to the Repat Hospital and the Admitting Medical Officer, after hearing where I had served, diagnosed Amoebic Dysentery which was confirmed by path tests."
