        "text": "10-day Premium Kokoda Pilgrimage\n\nOver the past 32 years Major Charlie Lynn has developed the ultimate trek itinerary to allow trekkers to maximise the value of their pilgrimage.\n\nHis 10-day Premium Kokoda Pilgrimages offer the ultimate Kokoda experience includes visits to all battlefields, fire support bases, logistic areas and evacuation centres along the original Kokoda Trail.\n\nIn addition to this we take a day to explore the mystical, historical Myola lakes which were considered to be tabu by the local Koiari tribes from the beginning of time until 1942.\n\nWe also trek across to the eastern side of the range that was defended by the 53rd and 2/16th Battalions.\n\nWe provide superior battlefield presentations regarding the strategy of the Kokoda campaign; the phases of war; the principles applicable to each phase; our battlefield tactics; and soldiers recollections.\n\nWe follow the original wartime trail mapped by the Royal Australian Army Survey Corps in 1981 and rediscovered through numerous mapping expeditions led by Major Charlie Lynn over a three year period from 2010 - 2013.\n\nWe provide a personal tent for each trekker.\n\nOur tents are fully screened and provide protection from malarial mosquitos, leeches, cockroaches, mice and other creepy-crawlies.\n\nFor personal protection, privacy, comfort and convenience our guides will set up your tent each night - pack it up the next morning - carry if to the next campsite and have it ready for you again.\n\nGuesthouses in villages along the trail are built from local bush materials - they offer basic shelter from the elements but don't have any privacy or screened protection from malarial mosquitos, leeches, cockroaches, rats and mice, etc!\n\nThe increase in trekker numbers over recent years has led to an increase in infestation in villages guesthouses.\n\nIf you have to sleep in these because your trek operator does not provide mosquito proof tents make sure you sleep with your mouth closed and that you don't mind the pitter-patter of little mice running across your forehead - if you are a bit sensitive in this area the only guarantee you have against the local infestation is to sleep in an insect proof tent.\n\nThere is also no protection from the inevitable snorer in guesthouses where everybody is required to bunk together.\n\nTripadvisor is the only independent and reliable forum for trekkers to post their comments in regard to their trek. You should therefore be wary of companies who don't rate much of a mention because trekkers obviously did not rate their experience with them.\n\nThe following post illustrates the difficulties you could face if you do not conduct proper research on the company you choose:\n\n'I do not recommend booking Kokoda with INTREPID\n\n'Trek is an amazing experience but not with Intrepid. I was doing it in July.\n\nOrganization of the trip was terrible but price really high (2600 -2800 pounds).\n\n'Our guide .....oh it was impossible to understand him. First I thought - it's because of my English ( it's not my first language ) but soon I realized - nobody can't understand him. So from my point of you - the historical part didn't exist! I am not Australian i just had a tiny knowledge about the battle. Hoped I will learn more during the trip - unfortunately...nothing! Need to read about it at home.\n\n'Another thing: it's a challenging trek. You ( or maybe just me) expect that at the end of the day person who look after the group will ask: are you ok? how are you feeling/doing?\n\n'Nothing.Two guys were ill during the trip. The only thing they did - stopped trek when they were throwing out. People from the group cared after each other - sharing first kit, happy to help each other\n\n'Food - disaster. For breakfast salty crackers with jam of honey, corn flakes with powder milk.....every day. Never ate it). Dinner and lunch - boiled pasta/ noodles/ spaghetti plus breakfast set. 18 meals - PASTA. Sorry...twice we had rice. No fruits - if you want to, need to get for yourself. Didn't expect amazing meals, understand that you can't get products on the way....but other groups had really great food - so if you want to, you can organise it much better than ours.\n\nMy porter was really bad too. Here I need to admit that I was unlucky because it was just few like him! He rarely was behind me - didn't have any help/security. When he was on his place .... I don't know who saved more other bottom. He landed on my back quite few times!\n\n'Also when he finally arrived on place where we were staying ( people from the group were enjoying water, I was waiting for my porter) , very often was leaving my backpack somewhere....I had to find it.\n\n'Finally .... I had a feeling that they just going with us, we weren't a group 9 I mean a crew and people from the group). The didn't stay with us after walking, didn't' talk to us etc.\n\n'Anyway: I think that the trek is great and Kokoda can be an amazing experience.....but think twice before you'll book it with Intrepid.\n\nAsk annapietrasz about Kokoda Track\n\nwww.tripadvisor.com.au"
