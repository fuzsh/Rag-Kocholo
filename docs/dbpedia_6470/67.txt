At age ten, Gant began acting in television commercials in Florida and became a member of the Screen Actors Guild at the age of eleven.

Gant studied tap and jazz dance with the American Musical Theatre Company in Tampa, Florida. He performed a soft-shoe routine at MacDill Air Force Base with comedian Bob Hope as part of Hope's USO tour. He attended George D. Chamberlain High School and graduated in 1986.

While attending the University of Pennsylvania, Gant majored in English literature with both Shakespeare and poetry concentrations. At Penn, he was also a performing member of the slightly outlandish, artistically driven all-male a cappella group Pennsylvania Six-5000 and, as part of the schoolâ€™s acting group Quadramics, played such roles as the sadistic dentist in Little Shop of Horrors. He attended the Georgetown University Law Center, where he obtained his Juris Doctor in 1993. Gant was also a member of the Georgetown Gilbert & Sullivan Society, performing in a number of its productions. Gant started a six-man a cappella group, The MetroGnomes, which performed in venues around Washington, D.C.

Gant accepted a position with the Los Angeles office of Chicago-headquartered international law firm Baker McKenzie. When the firm closed its Los Angeles office shortly thereafter, Gant decided to pursue acting and performing.
