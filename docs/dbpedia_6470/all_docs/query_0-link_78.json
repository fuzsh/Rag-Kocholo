        "text": "By Kiera Reilly, C’93, Allison Feder Fliegler, W’93, L’99, Josh Frank, C’93, Jennifer Jarett, C’93, and Alice Lai Platt, C’93\n\nOur 38 Weeks To Go post featured old Penn t-shirts. Our 77 Weeks To Go post featured photos of dorm rooms. Our 37 Weeks To Go post (that would be this post), will have a little of each of those posts. So, for our classmates who are only now sorting through their boxes of Penn memorabilia or digging around to see if they still have an old Penn t-shirt or sweatshirt, there is still time to have those items included in a post!\n\nThanks to Allison Feder-Fliegler, W’93, L’99, we have t-shirts from Warwick and Commie House to share.\n\nJosh Frank, C’93, shared this about the Warwick shirt:\n\nIt was designed by David “Bip” Lavine, C’93, who was roommates with Josh Perelman. He was a terrific artist, and really put a lot of thought into the design of the shirt.\n\nAs noted by Jen Jarrett, Bobby constantly walked around in a towel, and was often singing (he truly has an incredible singing voice), so that’s why there are little musical notes around him.\n\nIf I recall correctly, the tower on top looked like one of the ones on or near Warwick in the Quad, and the picture quality isn’t good, but I think there’s a Kilroy or something peeking out from the bottom of it.\n\nOf all of my dozens of shirts from Penn (fraternity, Mask & Wig, etc.), that one was always my favorite. We had a great floor, and having Bobby as our RA was an incredible gift.\n\nJosh wrote this in response to a lively post in our class Facebook group about dorm rooms and RA’s, and the RA for Warwick One, Bobby Gonzalez, C’90, (now a professional actor known as Robert Gant), was quite popular! (Stay tuned for more on Warwick One in a future post).\n\nAllison shared a photo of her freshman dorm room in the Quad.\n\nJennifer Jarret shared some dorm life photos.\n\nAlice Lai Platt shared some photos from Hill House.\n\nAlice writes,\n\nYou lived in Hill (hell) if your campus tour failed to include the quad, or if you got advice from someone who majored in engineering or math. The rooms were so small that my roommate and I could sit on our own beds and still hand each other the phone without getting up. I spent a lot of time outside and around campus!\n\nI met one of my best friends there. Her roommate never showed up so she had a room all to herself. I loved hanging out in her extra space.\n\nWay back in 1989 we had phones in the rooms! Here I am with one of my freshman roommates, Lisa Bardfeld Shapiro, C’93.\n\nIf you have dorm photos or old Penn t-shirts to share, please let us know. We want to share memories from as many classmates as possible.
