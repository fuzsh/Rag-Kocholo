        "text": "I only found out who he is yesterday. I’ve been watching ‘Hanging with Mr. Cooper’ (I know, I know) and he is in the second to the last episode. He played a waiter dressed as Robin Hood at Holly Robinson Peete’s bachelorette party.\n\nSomeone on DL said he was the partner of former NBC exec Robert Greenblatt, but I have never seen any reference to them being together.\n\nlooking at parts he played\n\n[quote] Caroline's boyfriend Trevor in Caroline in the City\n\nSo....not a straight man anywhere on that set, was there?\n\nI’m not sure who he is but, if he once looked like that, then he surely got a lot of good dick. No wonder he spends so much time reminiscing about the old days. He used to get his brains fucked out every night by a carousel of cock.\n\nI'm pretty thrilled with how hot he was then too.\n\nAnd I'd give the present version a poke any old day.\n\nHe was and is delicious, and I've never heard a bad thing about him. He's also long worked for GLBT seniors causes, even before he was one himself. I genuinely believe he's one of the good ones. It would make me sad to discover otherwise.\n\nMet him back in the day. Very put together in that actor way - a good looking guy but not high sexual energy. But a decent person AFAIK who seems to have avoided going off the deep end and was out when I was still brave to be,\n\n[quote]Robert Gant was born on 13 July 13, 1968, as Robert John Gonzalez in Tampa, Florida. As per wiki, he holds an American nationality and has a mixed ethnicity (Spanish, Italian, Cuban, Irish, and English descent from parents). He has a major in English literature at the University of Pennsylvania. He stands with a modest height with a muscular body. He graduated from Georgetown University Law Center in 1993 and practiced law before getting fame.\n\nI'm mostly surprised that he's not tall. Was the entire male cast of QAF teeny?\n\nSharon Gless was the only decent actor on QAF and even she wasn’t at her best.\n\nHe was very much a reason to watch the later seasons of QaF. But I also caught him on an early episode of \"Friends,\" in which he played a boyfriend of Phoebe. And more recently he was on an episode of \"Mike and Molly.\" He played an ex-fiance of Molly who had become a bakery shop owner. Still looked damn good."
