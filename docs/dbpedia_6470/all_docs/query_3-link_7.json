        "text": "Robert Gant Bio\n\nBirth Name: Robert Gonzalez\n\nBirthday: July 13, 1968\n\nBirth Place: Tampa, Florida\n\nRobert Gant continues to emerge as one of Hollywood's highly sought-after actors.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2005, Robert appeared on television screens across the nation as one of the stars of Showtime's hit television series, \"Queer as Folk.\"\n\nPrior to QAF, he recurred as the eccentric principal, Calvin Krupps, on the WB's \"Popular\" and as Caroline's boyfriend, Trevor, on NBC'S \"Caroline in the City.\" Gant has had many notable guest spots on such TV hits as \"Friends,\" where he played one of two gorgeous men Phoebe was dating simultaneously, \"Veronica's Closet,\" \"Becker,\" \"Melrose Place,\" \"Ellen,\" \"Providence,\" and \"The Closer.\" He also appeared in the independent films \"The Contract,\" \"Fits and Starts\" and \"Marie and Bruce,\" starring Julianne Moore and Matthew Broderick.\n\nHis time in Hollywood is not limited to performing, however. Along with producing partners Chad Allen and Christopher Racster, Robert has started the film and television production company, Mythgarden. They have an exciting slate of initial projects, each with varying degrees of gay-focused content, and are developing a number of other films and television shows. The company's first film shoots May 2006 in New Mexico.\n\nWhile he gives time to a number of philanthropic and political causes, Robert's \"torch issue\" is that of aging in the gay community. He supports such organizations as SAGE (Services and Advocacy for GLBT Elders) and GLEH (Gay and Lesbian Elder Housing). He is also developing a website devoted entirely to gay elders and all matters that affect them.\n\nRobert's love of acting and performing began at an early age. He started doing television commercials and joined the Screen Actors Guild at the age of ten in his home state of Florida. He went on to attend undergrad at the University of Pennsylvania and law school at Georgetown University. While studying, he never gave up on his true passions and took part in numerous theatrical productions. Interestingly, it was his career as an attorney that brought him to Los Angeles when he accepted a position with the world's largest law firm. In a twist of fate, the firm's Los Angeles office was closed soon after. Taking that as an omen, he made the decision to focus all of his time on the entertainment business. The decision was a good one. His adventure in Hollywood has only just begun.\n\nRobert currently resides in Los Angeles.\n\nRobert Gant resume\n\nFILM\n\nMilada -- (2017) Dir.
