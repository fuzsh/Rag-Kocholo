        "text": "Pamela Lear Ed.D.\n\nDeputy Superintendent of Staff and Racial Equity\n\nPamela Lear is deeply committed to fostering a culture of equity and excellence. Her passion lies in creating robust systems that empower and uplift underserved students. Lear is dedicated to establishing an environment where every student, regardless of background or circumstances, thrives and excels by receiving the tailored support and opportunities required to reach their fullest potential. For more than three decades she has served as a teacher, principal, executive director, deputy chief of School Leadership, chief of staff and racial equity, and deputy superintendent. She believes effective leadership, quality instruction, building a collaborative culture and providing support for continuous improvement will successfully change academic outcomes and the trajectory for underserved students.\n\nLear credits a strong mother and supportive father for fueling her drive, determination, and desire for excellence. She gained her greatest inspiration from watching her mother persevere through various life experiences, and it is that journey which led Lear down the path of public education.\n\nHighly regarded for her work with underperforming campuses, she has led leaders and schools in improving student outcomes and is admired for her ability to build consensus among stakeholders and effective teams to create change.\n\nLear earned her undergraduate degree from San Diego State University, and later earned a master’s in educational leadership at St. Mary’s College (Moraga, CA) and a doctorate in educational leadership from Texas Christian University.\n\nMost evenings, she enjoys cycling with her favorite Peloton instructors and creating priceless memories with her family.\n\nHer most poignant viewpoint: “Children need advocates, influencers, and mentors to help pave the path, remove the barriers, and instill hope and the belief that their achievements are limitless. This is my calling.”\n\nBrian C. Lusk Ed.D.\n\nDeputy Superintendent of Academics and Transformation\n\nBrian Lusk’s journey in education is rooted in a genuine passion for making a positive impact on young minds.\n\nFrom a young age, Lusk knew teaching was his passion. His teaching journey in Dallas ISD began at Joseph J. Rhoads Learning Center in South Dallas. For three years, he taught a self-contained third-grade classroom, followed by two years teaching sixth-grade math. These formative years had a profound impact on his career, and he remains grateful for the experience and the team at Rhoads.\n\nNow serving as deputy superintendent of Academics and Transformation, Lusk finds fulfillment in witnessing students graduate college- and career-ready. Ensuring that students are prepared for success, equipped with the credentials to navigate their journey beyond high school, is a source of great satisfaction.\n\nLusk holds a degree in elementary education from California University of Pennsylvania (PennWest California), a master’s in educational administration from Texas A&M University, Commerce, and a doctorate in educational leadership and policy from The University of Texas at Austin.\n\nOutside of his professional commitments, Lusk treasures time spent with his family.\n\nA favorite quote: \"You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.\" - Wayne Gretzky\n\nRobert Abel\n\nChief of Human Capital Management\n\nWith a dedicated commitment to education, Robert Abel has held integral roles within Dallas ISD’s Human Capital Management department since 2016. Previously, he held positions ranging from executive director to assistant superintendent. Employing a strategic approach as chief of Human Capital Management, Abel now has a pivotal role in ensuring Dallas ISD departments and campuses are equipped with the right talent to foster an environment of success.\n\nAbel brings a wealth of knowledge and professional insight to his role as chief. Before joining the Dallas ISD family, his influence was felt as the division director of High Schools/Support Services at Irving ISD. In this capacity, he demonstrated exceptional leadership by overseeing the comprehensive operations of five high schools, the newcomer center, alternative education programs, and the career development center.\n\nHis academic foundation includes a bachelor’s degree in cell and molecular biology from Oklahoma State University and a master’s degree in education from The University of Texas at Arlington.\n\nAbel's journey is marked not only by his dedication to education but also by his life beyond the professional sphere. His greatest joy comes from spending quality time with his loved ones either fishing, setting sail on a boat, or exploring nature through hiking.\n\nHe says: “Education is the greatest profession because you have a chance to change a kid's life every single day!”\n\nBrent Alfred\n\nChief of Construction Services\n\nBrent Alfred's entry into the world of education took a unique and unconventional path. In high school, his favorite subjects were art, science, and math. Without realizing it, these early interests may have influenced his career path.\n\nDespite his mother's career as a teacher, his initial professional journey led him to retail and office architecture. As his career unfolded, he discovered a talent for designing and managing school projects. This realization, combined with a deep passion for creating environments that inspire and facilitate learning, ultimately guided him to the role he occupies today in education.\n\nCurrently serving as chief of Construction Services, Alfred is responsible for overseeing the $3.5 billion 2020 Bond Program, including monitoring and communicating the status of the budget as well as funding from special revenue, general operating funds, and the 2015 Bond Program. He also leads his teams in creating safe, healthy, and inspiring learning environments.\n\nAlfred has an associate degree from the Art Institute of Dallas and a bachelor’s degree in architecture from Southern University. In his free time, he enjoys reading and cherishing moments with family and friends.\n\nHe quotes Julia Morgan in saying: \"Architecture is a visual art, and the buildings speak for themselves.\"\n\nDavid Bates\n\nChief of Operations\n\nAfter a distinguished career in the U.S. Army, David Bates transitioned to the field of education, marking the beginning of a remarkable journey with Dallas ISD. While Bates did not always envision a career in education, his journey began post-Kuwait in 1998 when he joined the district as a paraprofessional in charge of data entry. His commitment to education led him to serve in several roles within the district including Leadership Cadet Corps instructor, supervisor in Student Services, executive director of Maintenance and Facility Services, and assistant superintendent of Maintenance and Construction Support.\n\nIn his current role as chief of Operations, Bates believes his department's most significant contribution to students is fostering a safe, positive cultural environment and providing the backdrop for their educational experiences.\n\nBates holds a bachelor's degree in applied arts and sciences and a master's degree in education from the University of North Texas at Dallas. Outside of his professional commitments, you will find him doing yard work during his leisure time.\n\n“Eat the frog first,” he advises, paraphrasing Mark Twain.\n\nSean Brinkman\n\nChief Technology Officer\n\nSean Brinkman, chief technology officer for Dallas ISD, brings a personalized touch to his journey in education and technology. His path to Dallas ISD began as a teacher through the Alternative Certification Program. This offered Brinkman an opportunity to embark on a profession where he could make a meaningful difference and lay the foundation for starting a family.\n\nAs Brinkman’s journey evolved, he served in several capacities. Reflecting on his student days, he says his favorite subject was math, a foundation that would later contribute to his affinity for educational technology. As chief technology officer, he leads the Dallas ISD Educational Technology division. His team is committed to providing efficient and effective educational technologies while fostering innovation and enhancing the student learning experience for Dallas ISD’s diverse population.\n\nBeyond his professional commitments, Brinkman enjoys cherishing moments with his children. His love for travel takes him to new places, while his love for the outdoors has him hiking, walking, and participating in water sports.\n\n“Peace begins with a smile,” he says, a quote from Mother Teresa.\n\nJon Dahlander\n\nChief of Partnerships and Intergovernmental Relations\n\nJon Dahlander returns to Dallas ISD following his tenure as chief of staff and director of communications in the Highland Park Independent School District. Currently serving as chief of Partnerships and Intergovernmental Relations at Dallas ISD, he first joined the district in 1995 to oversee media relations.\n\nDahlander has a diverse and rich background which uniquely shaped his journey in education. His interest in the field was sparked during his time as the state capitol bureau chief for the Oklahoma News Network. A significant piece of education legislation passed during this time, leading the newly elected state superintendent of public instruction to recruit Dahlander to serve as the executive director of communications for the Oklahoma Department of Education. His familial ties to education, with both his mother and sister being teachers, further fueled his passion for the field.\n\nIn his current role, Dahlander’s efforts span family engagement, advocacy for parents, support for homeless students, engagement of partners and volunteers, fundraising through the Dallas Education Foundation, and telling the transformative stories of new facilities in Dallas ISD.\n\nIn his free time, Dahlander enjoys spending time traveling with his family, camping, and embarking on adventures with his daughters.\n\nA quote that inspires him: “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.” – From Teddy Roosevelt’s “Man in the Arena” speech\n\nLibby Daniels\n\nChief of Communications\n\nAs a student, Libby Daniels’ favorite subject was literature, reflecting her passion for storytelling. Now as chief of Communication Services, Daniels takes great pride in sharing compelling stories about the unique narrative of Dallas ISD. Daniels guides the work of the district’s branding and marketing, media relations, digital communications, internal communications, special events, call center, and translations.\n\nSince joining Dallas ISD in 2008, Daniels has held various leadership roles, including executive director and deputy chief of Communication Services, ultimately being appointed chief in 2020. Her work has played a pivotal role in an expanded digital presence, increased earned media, and strategic marketing initiatives. Under her guidance, Communication Services has garnered numerous awards at the state and national levels, including an Emmy.\n\nDaniels has more than 30 years of experience as a storyteller, communicator, and strategist. She earned her degree in communications from North Texas State University in Denton (UNT) and is recognized as one of Ragan Communications' Top Women in Communications.\n\nTo unwind, Daniels enjoys working puzzles of any kind and spending time with her family.\n\nWords of wisdom: “The life of a storyteller can be filled with great adventure and tall tales of the people and experiences along life’s journey. It can also be simply a well-tuned ear at work in the world around you. Find the stories that inspire.”\n\nAngie Gaylord\n\nChief Academic Officer\n\nAngie Gaylord's journey in education began as a student teacher at Sunset High School and Cowart Elementary School, as part of a partnership between Dallas ISD and the University of North Texas. Her family's legacy in education, with her mother teaching for over 45 years and her father for over 55 years, has also led her to dedicate her professional career to public education.\n\nAs a former high school biology teacher and varsity swim coach at Hillcrest High School in Dallas ISD, Gaylord’s favorite subjects as a student were biology and geometry, and she has fond memories of her time as her high school’s mascot.\n\nIn her current position as chief academic officer, she helps guide the academic framework, curriculum, and instructional resources for Dallas ISD classrooms, ensuring student success and making a significant impact on students' educational experiences.\n\nGaylord graduated from the University of North Texas with a degree in kinesiology and earned a master’s degree from California State University. Outside of work, she enjoys spending quality time with family and friends by the lake.\n\nA guiding quote: \"Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.\" - Ralph Waldo Emerson\n\nTiffany Huitt\n\nChief of School Leadership\n\nTiffany Huitt-Powell's professional trajectory is more than just a series of roles; it's a testament to her commitment to shaping young minds.\n\nHer journey with Dallas ISD began in 1999 when she stepped into the role of a science teacher at the Dallas Environmental Science Academy. Prior to her current role as chief of School Leadership, Huitt-Powell served as deputy chief of academics in Teaching and Learning and executive director of magnet schools in School Leadership. She has also served as principal of the School of Science and Engineering at Yvonne A. Ewell Townview Magnet Center, which is recognized as one of the top high schools in the country.\n\nHuitt-Powell's roots lie in the classroom, where she not only taught but also assumed roles as lead science teacher and instructional coach. In these capacities, she not only developed science curriculum assessments, but also crafted professional development programs for K-12 science courses, leaving an indelible mark on the educational landscape.\n\nHuitt-Powell holds a bachelor's degree in biology from Paul Quinn College and a master's degree in interdisciplinary sciences from The University of Texas at Arlington. Whether she's developing curriculum, serving on committees, or leading as chief of School Leadership, Huitt-Powell has an unwavering commitment to the students and educators she serves.\n\nJason Stanford\n\nSpecial Assistant to the Superintendent\n\nJason Stanford's journey into education was fueled by a unique set of circumstances during the pandemic. He spent this time navigating the challenges of remote schooling, with his sons completing their college and high school years from different bedrooms. Jason felt a calling to make a difference and joined the local school district.\n\nIn his current role as special assistant to the superintendent of schools for Dallas ISD, Stanford plays a crucial part in the superintendent's ambitious goals for the district. Before stepping into the education sector, Jason served as the communications director for Austin Mayor Steve Adler. Beyond his contributions to politics and communication, Jason founded Stanford Campaigns, a political research firm based in Austin.\n\nStanford attended Lewis & Clark College, where he earned a bachelor of arts degree in Russian. He studied Russian because he wanted to become a spy. During his final semester at Lewis & Clark, he studied at Moscow State Pedagogical University.\n\nIn addition to his professional pursuits, Jason finds joy in writing, exploring art museums, hiking with his sons, and passionately supporting the Baltimore Orioles.\n\nHis personal philosophy is encapsulated in the quote \"Never say you can’t. Say you need help.”\n\nDwayne Thompson\n\nInterim Chief Financial Officer\n\nDwayne Thompson brings more than 23 years of financial experience to the position of chief financial officer, where he will lead a team of experienced professionals in developing the district’s operational budget and overseeing and managing fiscal operations.\n\nPrior to his appointment to Dallas ISD, Thompson served as the chief financial officer for Owasso Public Schools in Owasso, Oklahoma, where he prepared and monitored the operational budget and supervised fiscal operations, including purchasing, treasury and maintenance.
