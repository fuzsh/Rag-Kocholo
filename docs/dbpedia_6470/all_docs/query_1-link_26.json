        "text": "***************\n\nChester set to \"Save\" Gant by Romeo San Vicente December 3, 2003\n\nYou know you're not satisfied seeing \"Queer as Folk\" hottie Robert Gant confined to the small screen. You want more. You want bigger. And soon you'll get it. \"Save Me,\" the next film from actor/writer/director Craig Chester, will star Gant and former teen star Chad Allen (\"Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman\"). A romantic comedy set against the backdrop of an ex-gay ministry, \"Save Me\" may be a first in that it will actually star openly gay actors in both lead roles. The film is still in its preproduction phase and will stay there until Chester finishes shooting his debut feature, \"Adam & Steve.\" But once it's in the can, expect irreverently funny stuff on your art-house screens sometime in 2005.\n\nFrom Chaos In Austin: Queer As Popular Folk\n\n\"Queer As Folk's\" second season is suffering from cheesy writing, poor acting, and bad directing. The one bright spot this season is the addition of Robert Gant to the cast. Gant plays Michael's new love interest Ben Bruckner. Bruckner is HIV positive and this fact causes an uproar with Michael's friends and family. You may remember Gant as the yummy Vice-Principal Calvin Krupps from my once beloved series \"Popular.\" Krupps gave Nicole (Tammy Lynn Michaels, Melissa Etheridge's gal-pal) a run for her Jimmy Choo shoes. Hopefully, the addition of Gant to the cast of Queer will help put the show back on the honor roll. View\n\nRobert Gant Comes Out\n\nI first saw Mr. Gant on his hilarious \"Friends\" guest appearance when he played one of the two men that Phoebe was dating simultaneously. He caught my eye again when he joined the cast of \"Popular\" during the ill-fated second and final season. I was happy to learn he was joining the cast of \"Queer As Folk,\" because I think he is a good actor and the possibility of seeing him naked didn't hurt. Even though the second season of Queer wasn't solid, Robert Gant's performance was always strong. His real characterization of Ben, Michael's HIV positive boyfriend, wonderfully inhabits a television world that is a little too populated with stereotypes. Check out the August 20 issue of \"The Advocate\" for a great article on Robert Gant's personal decision to come out.\n\n********************************************\n\nFrom SouthCoast Today:\n\nGood Humor discontinued its Good Humor delivery men, dressed in bow ties and suits, in 1976. In the new commercials, created by Interpublic Group's McCann-Erickson advertising agency, 27-year-old Robert Gant drives the familiar Good Humor truck and sings about a plan to take his \"ice cream across the land\" as he distributes sundae cones, bars and cookie sandwiches to throngs of kids. In real life, the actor who plays the Santa Claus of Summer holds a law degree from Georgetown University and plays an ancient Olympian in a Hanes television commercial with basketball star Michael Jordan.\n\n********************************************\n\nWindy City Times Interview with Peter Paige:\n\nDG: How do you personally feel about Robert Gant recently coming out in the Aug. 20 issue of The Advocate? Had he confided his sexuality to you prior to doing The Advocate interview?\n\nPP: Oh, of course.\n\nDG: Was Bobby's sexuality a known fact by all of the cast prior to his coming out?\n\nPP: Yes, absolutely, David. And by the way, he was never closeted on the set in any way, shape or form. His decision not to come out initially was something we talked about for hours and hours and hours in his trailer. Like over and over and over again. You know, because he wanted to hear my experience in coming out; what I thought the benefits were what I thought the concerns might be. I was heavily invested in that decision with him and I'm also so proud of it. I'm so proud of him and happy for him. It seems like a great weight has been lifted off him. I was with him presenting awards at the closing night of the Gay and Lesbian Film Festival in LA and there was this one window where the (Advocate) article was about to come out. And the article had been released, so he was finally allowed to talk about it. Because he wasn't allowed to scoop his own article. So he was finally allowed to talk about it, he had a public setting, he went up on stage, and he came out to this entire audience live. He almost didn't do it, and it was like, \"Bobby, don't deprive yourself of this opportunity. Take this moment for yourself. You will never forget it. Even in the most difficult moments when you're not getting an audition because they now perceive you in a certain way you will have this to remember. This will mean something to you for the rest of your life.\" And he did it, he got a standing ovation, and it was such an amazing moment. I was so privileged to be there.\n\n********************************************\n\nLa Dolce Musto\n\nby Michael Musto"
