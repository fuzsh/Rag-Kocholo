        "text": "American, born 1971\n\nAnne Gant uses traditional glassmaking techniques to create forms she then presses into paper while the glass is still molten hot. The resulting ‘fire glass drawings’ capture a sense of glass’s hot unstable state. They often reference manmade objects like chandeliers or necklaces yet evoke an organic sensibility.\n\nIn 2015 Gant was among the first artists to demonstrate in CMoG’s new Amphitheater Hot Shop. In 2014 she was honored to be included in the Coberg Prize for Contemporary Glass, in the galleries of the Veste Coburg and the European Museum of Modern Glass in Rödental, Germany.\n\nAnne Gant has a M.F.A. from Tyler School of Art, Temple University, a B.F.A. in Sculpture from Parsons School of Design, and spent 6 years at Urban Glass in Brooklyn. Anne Gant is American and currently lives and works in Amsterdam, Netherlands.\n\nEDUCATION\n\n2009, Ma sters in Preservation and Presentation of the Moving Image, Cum Laude\n\nUniversiteit van Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands\n\n2004, Masters of Fine Arts in Glass\n\nTyler School of Art, Temple University, Elkins Park, PA\n\n1994, Bachelor of Fine Arts in Sculpture.
