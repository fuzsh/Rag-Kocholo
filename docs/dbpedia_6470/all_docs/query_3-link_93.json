        "text": "WHY LEHIGH? “Lehigh was the most academically challenging school from the colleges and universities I was looking at (the others were Drexel and Lafayette). I chose Lehigh because it was a small university where I could get involved, know many students and take part in its prestigious engineering program. Lehigh is a Division I school, which made walking onto the crew team all the more exciting.”\n\nON THE COACHING STAFF: “The coaches we have are great. They take into consideration our health and standing as students, and make sure academics are priority, with rowing shortly behind. Practices and workouts are changed to make our life at school as best as it can be while still improving. With Coach Conley now leading this team, and his experience, along with the assistants, this team is bound to succeed. We have committed rowers on varsity and as freshmen. I have no doubt that he intends to and will make Lehigh’s Crew team exceptional.”\n\nAS A FRESHMAN (2010-11): Member of a strong Freshmen Eight Crew that went on to place fifth in the semifinals of the prestigious Dad Vail Regatta (5/14). Posted a time of 6:30.06, which was less than 18 seconds out of first … Part of the Varsity Lightweight Four that won the River Cup (4/16) over Lafayette with a time of 6:36.80. Rowed with the Freshmen Eight as well, which was victorious (5:44.30) … Finished third in the Petite Finals at the Knecht Cup (4/9-10) with a time of 6:30.93 … Member of the Freshmen Eight crew that won the Neuweiler Plate (4/2) (6:56.70) by 45 seconds. Was also bow of the Varsity Lightweight Four that came in second … Stroke one for the Freshmen Eight that came in first at the Frostbite Regatta (11/13) with a time of 6:53.41.\n\nBEFORE LEHIGH: Eagle Scout with Bronze, Gold and Silver Palm … Attended three high school adventure camps (canoeing in Maine, biking on Cape Cod and sailing in Florida) … Received the Jean Manual Award for Excellence in French Language.\n\nPERSONAL: Son of Ken and Cindy Gant … Has three siblings: Phil, Greg and Aly … Enjoys erging and outdoor activities … Lists brother Phil as most admired person."
