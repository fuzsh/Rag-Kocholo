        "text": "JAMES THOMAS FARTHING, of Mount Laurel, NJ, passed away after a brief illness on June 28, 2021. He was born on March 25, 1953 in Philadelphia, PA to the late James W. Farthing, Jr. and the late Audrey M. Blackwell Farthing. Chuck, as he was affectionately called, grew up in the Mt. Airy section of the city. He was a lover of all sports. During his years at Central High School, he was an outstanding basketball player and was recognized as 1st Team All Public in 1970 amongst other accolades, before graduating in 1971. While attending Penn State University, he became a proud member of the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc. Chuck began his career in the port in 1974, as a member of ILA Local 1291. He worked his way up through management with the same company, Delaware River Stevedores (DRS) and its predecessor agencies headquartered in Philadelphia for more than forty years. He retired in 2015 as Vice President of Operations, after an illustrious career. He was the first African American to achieve such a position, at a major stevedoring company, in the entire United States; an accomplishment he took very seriously and of which he was extremely proud.\n\nChuck was the beloved husband of Nancy Capers Farthing for forty plus years. He was predeceased by his beloved son Hakim Azim Farthing and he was the loving father of Eshe-Ayo Audrey Farthing (Edward Gunney II). He was the devoted grandfather of Eric and Camryn Robinson and Jovan May and the dear brother of Audrey Farthing Key (Tony), Pamela Farthing Friedman (John) and Joseph Blackwell Farthing (Pam). He was also loved and admired by a host of nieces, nephews, family members and friends.\n\nHis love for the NJ Shore was developed as a youngster, during family vacations in Wildwood; reinforced later with regular trips to Atlantic City and Cape May. He dubbed himself “beach man” as he took great pride in preparations allowing him to stay on the beach all day whether it was body surfing, playing in the water or just basking in the sun until he watched it set upon the water, which was one of his greatest joys. Chuck was an eclectic music lover and he nurtured a unique passion for jazz. He attended numerous concerts and interacted with singers and musicians alike on multiple occasions.\n\nChuck loved to travel and he and Nancy did so extensively. He was fortunate to have visited multiple continents. However, Mexico was his favorite destination and the two of them vacationed there frequently. He was an avid golfer, spending hours of fun outdoors having a great time with his good friend & partner Lee Cole on the links. He considered himself an amateur chef and he took great pride and pleasure in creating sumptuous meals for family and friends. This creativity morphed into acting after he retired. His vivid imagination was the perfect vehicle for propelling him onto the stage as he transitioned from the port into this new world of artistic expression. Acting lessons followed, allowing him to snag a part in an on-line series. His acting experience culminated in live on stage performances in the role of \"Bobo\", in the Lorraine Hansberry classic 'A Raisin In The Sun'. As he continued to grow artistically, he became enamored with painting in acrylics. He often gifted his creations to family and friends and many of his pieces were purchased by art lovers and aficionados. He signed his work under the name “PIC”, from a nickname given him by his closest friends in college...'The Cosmic Pickle'.\n\nChuck always put family first, above all else. He treasured every member of his family, embracing them with love and affection at every opportunity. The man known as James Thomas 'Chuck' Farthing will be greatly and sorely missed.\n\nDonald Morris Schuler Sr.\n\n(December 6, 1950 - May 20, 2021)\n\nRev. Donald Morris Schuler Sr. a man truly after God's own heart, a role model, leader, and inspiration to all that met him departed his earthly vessel on May 20, 2021, after a good and faithful fight.\n\nDonald, affectionately known as The General, Big Don, Big Boy (by his mother), and \"Don Juan\" (by himself) was born to his parents Morris Schuler and Gloria Washington on December 6, 1950, at Hahnemann University Hospital. His siblings Ronnie and Cherie came soon after and the three were inseparable.\n\nWhile Donald was a proud big brother, always fiercely protecting his brother and sister, he was also raised with a host of cousins who grew up together like siblings. Donald's grandmother, Mamie Elizabeth Washington played a large role in his upbringing, and he affectionately viewed her as not just a role model but the picture of elegance as she was a school teacher and pianist, she taught Donald proper etiquette and manners that carried on through adulthood.\n\nDonald was a product of the Philadelphia school system and graduated from the prestigious Central High School in 1968. Upon graduation, Donald started at The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) Delaware County Campus in June 1969 then later transferred to the University Park campus in June 1970. He was extremely active on campus and became a member of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity Inc. in 1971. Donald was also a member of the Penn State Football team. While in college Donald lost his best friend and younger brother Ronald (Ronnie) Schuler to complications with sickle cell disease. This loss hit him tremendously, but he used the loss to motivate him to keep going and make his siblings proud. In his brother's honor, he hosted a fundraiser at Penn State and raised close to $10,000 for sickle cell disease research.\n\nIn April 1975, less than a month before his graduation, Donald suffered another loss. This time it was his biggest cheerleader and advocate, his mother, Gloria Washington after a battle with breast cancer. However, she stayed until he could show her his completed degree requirements and hear the words, \"well done my big boy.\" He pushed through to graduation day which he said was a bright sunny day that he knew his mother was smiling and shining down on him.\n\nAfter the loss of his mother and graduating from Penn State, Donald took over as the primary caregiver of his younger sister Cherie Brewer. His sister was beautiful, strong-willed, feisty, loving and always gave her brother a run for his money. But the two loved each other deeply and he did all that he could to take care of his little sister. From helping her pick out her clothes, doing her hair, meeting her boyfriends, and everything in between, Donald stepped up to be beyond just a big brother but also a parent to his sister.\n\nAfter taking a few years off to work and care for Cherie, in 1976 Donald went on to continue his education at Villanova University to pursue his Master of Public Administration and secured a tuition fellowship after challenging the dean and taking the four most difficult courses at the university. He graduated from Villanova in September 1978. This was one of his proudest accomplishments and he used the story to encourage everyone pursuing their education, that if you do the work and try your hardest you will succeed.\n\nDonald went on to pursue a career in the pharmaceutical industry which many would say was the start of him becoming the \"vitamin man,\" he's known as today. Donald worked for pharmaceutical companies P&G and Searle from October 1978 — August 2003. He also operated as an independent distributor of Shaklee vitamins, products that he made sure his entire family and extended family knew about and used as he always encouraged a healthy and pure lifestyle. In the years after his pharmaceutical career, Donald worked as a regional sales manager for Produce for a Better Health Foundation and was an independent health insurance broker.\n\nIn 1983, Donald met the love of his, life Dawn Schuler whom he affectionally called his tootsie roll, petunia, sweet thang, and Dawny. After the urging of a neighbor (his future wife's cousin), he came to Consolation Baptist Church where he said he had tunnel vision and saw the most beautiful woman singing in the choir. Donald bold as always approached her father Bishop Alden A. Gaines the leader of Consolation Baptist Church and asked not just for permission to date his daughter but also challenged him and asked him questions about the Christian faith and what it meant to walk with the Lord. In just a few short months, Donald was born again accepting Jesus Christ as his Lord and Savior, became active in the church, and began a relationship with Dawn. The two entered into Holy Matrimony on August 11, 1984, and moved to Levittown, Pennsylvania.\n\nDonald wanted to show his bride the world and give her opportunities she didn't have before and he did just that. He took her to places such as Hawaii, Paris, London, Jamaica, Nevis, U.S. Virgin Islands, and over many other destinations the two shared their love with the world. After years of trying to conceive, the two welcomed their oldest son Donald Jr. (Big Boy) into the world in April 1990. Donald took great pride in being a husband and father and was determined to be consistently present for his family. In the following years they welcomed another son, Matthew (Mookie) in November 1992 and to their surprise welcomed their baby girl Diamond (Tinky/Tiny Tot) in September 1995.\n\nDonald was the ultimate provider, biggest supporter, and cheerleader to his family, his kids affectionally called him General,\" because he ran a tight ship but the children never once had to question his love or support for them. Donald was a great father but also strived to extend that love to his nieces, nephews, and his children's friends always seeking to encourage and uplift him. Everyone knew that if they came to the Schuler house, they were going to have to face at least one, deep one-on-one conversation with Don Sr. and he was going to ask you all the tough questions, but you would leave that conversation with a new perspective and likely a new level of determination.\n\nAfter getting saved in 1983, Donald became a faithful servant of Consolation Baptist Church, serving in a variety of different ministries and outreach. He graduated with his Master of Divinity from Eastern Baptist Theological Seminary in 1994 and continued serving at Consolation until 1999 when the Lord called him and his wife Dawn to start their church. In Fall 1999 Genesis Community Church opened its doors in Newtown, Pennsylvania. Through their leadership Pastor Donald and Dawn were able to help change the lives of their members from all over the Greater Philadelphia Area and establish lifelong relationships. After officially closing the doors of Genesis Community Church in 2016, Donald and the entire Schuler family continued their ministry outside the four walls of the church as they traveled as a family to support the musical appearances and various events of Donald Jr., Matthew, and Diamond.\n\nMany people say that Donald never met a stranger as he was always loudly and proudly introducing himself and declaring his love for the Lord. He was a true disciple ofChrist and evangelist. Donald lived by the motto \"JUST DO RIGHT.\" Donald could be described as aggressively friendly, always sharing a cheerful and loud \"HELLO,\" giving his world-famous back-breaking hugs to women and possible bone crushing handshakes for the men. He was an all-around big person, not just in stature but in personality, joy, and love. He was big in every way. He was a lifelong learner always seeking to learn more, do more and be more. He encouraged others to do the same. He loved to tell outlandish stories (that actually turned out to be true), loved to sing (always had to start with a strong \"oooohhhh\" note), made up his own dance moves (most notably the scoop/shovel), and loved to celebrate birthdays (mostly for the cake), Donald had a sweet tooth and sweet spirit.\n\nDonald faced a long and hard fight with prostate cancer from 2016-2021 and fought every minute to be strong for his family and present in all ways, celebrating 36.5 years of marriage with his wife, seeing his oldest son get married, giving his daughter away at her wedding and watching his son Matthew have a flourishing music career and following his dreams. Donald left this world in true Godly fashion surrounded by his family. As they sang \"Holy Spirit You Are Welcome Here,\" they watched him take a peaceful last breath and reunite with his family and his Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.\n\nDonald was welcomed into heaven by his mother Gloria, father Morris, brother Ronnie, sister Cherie, father-in-love Bishop Gaines, sister-in-love Danielle, niece Angelika Left to celebrate and honor his love, legacy and memory are his wife, Dawn, sons Donald Jr. (Tiffanny) and Matthew, daughter Diamond (Rasheed); Aunt Dolly and Aunt Ruth; Mother-inLaw Marie Gaines; Sisters-in-law Dana (Tyrone), Daria, and Yvette; Brothers-in-law Derrick and David (Demetria) and a host of nieces, nephews, cousins, and spiritual children.\n\nhttps://mayfuneralhomes.com/tribute/details/7860/Donald-Schuler-Sr/memorial-video.html#content-start\n\nFormer Democratic State Sen. Hardy Williams, 78, who helped pave the way for African Americans to be elected mayor of Philadelphia, died of complications from Alzheimer's disease yesterday at Kearsley, a retirement community in West Philadelphia.\n\nIn a January 2008 appreciation, Philadelphia Daily News columnist Elmer Smith wrote that Mr. Williams \"and the late John White Sr. founded the Black Political Forum in 1967 and cleared a path to the mayor's office for W. Wilson Goode and John Street.\"\n\n\"When Michael Nutter takes office . . . it will be in no small measure an outgrowth of the vision those men had of a movement away from what they called the 'plantation politics' of a Democratic Party that used to hand pick the few black candidates that it occasionally slated for elected office,\" the column read.\n\nThe column was poignant because Smith interviewed Mr. Williams at Kearsley, where \"he [was] in an early stage of a degenerative dementia that threatens to erase his memories of a lifetime of political activism and public service.\"\n\nAlthough he had successes outside his city - he was an Air Force officer and the first black person to play basketball for Penn State - Mr. Williams' impact was greatest in his hometown.\n\nHe was, Inquirer associate editor emeritus Acel Moore said, \"the godfather of black independent politics in Philadelphia.\"\n\n\"Although he was not the first African American to run for mayor, he was clearly the first viable candidate to do so,\" Moore said. Mr. Williams did it without the endorsement of the Democratic Party, \"inspiring other black candidates to seek office without the party's backing.\"\n\nGov. Rendell called him \"the father of independent African American politicians in Philadelphia.\"\n\n\"There were others elected before him,\" Rendell said, \"but they were selected by the machine and they never challenged the establishment.\n\n\"Hardy would challenge the establishment at every drop of the hat. He took no prisoners, always said what he believed, and was a butt-kicker. If Hardy didn't like a policy and couldn't get it changed, boom, there were 300 people in the street demonstrating. You either did what Hardy wanted or it was all-out war.\"\n\nWhen Rendell was in a five-man field for the Democratic mayoral nomination in 1991, he said, \"Hardy legitimized my candidacy in the eyes of African American voters . . . I don't think I would have been mayor and then governor without his support.\"\n\nMr. Williams made two bids to become mayor of Philadelphia.\n\nIn 1971, he lost in the Democratic primary to former Police Commissioner Frank L. Rizzo, who would go on to serve two four-year terms. In February 1979, he withdrew from the Democratic primary, saying he did not want to divide the African American community and leaving that field to Charles W. Bowser, who lost to U.S. Rep William J. Green 3d, the next mayor.\n\nWorking on Mr. Williams' 1971 campaign were Jannie Brooks and Lucien Blackwell. The two would marry the next year and go on to become a small political dynasty in West Philadelphia: the late Lucien Blackwell rising as high as the U.S. House of Representatives before his death in 2003, and his wife serving on City Council.\n\nCouncilwoman Jannie Blackwell yesterday recalled that year as a magical era in which Mr. Williams' promise of better things electrified a community.\n\n\"He was our leader,\" Blackwell said, excitement rising with her voice. \"He brought hope, and he signified that all things are possible, and that we as a people could move forward.\"\n\nMr. Williams was a state representative from 1971 to 1973 and from 1977 to 1982. He joined the state Senate the following year, and retired in 1998, when he practically handed the seat over to his son, Anthony H. Williams.\n\nHow he did so was a bit of Philly-style politics. Mr. Williams simply failed to meet a primary campaign filing deadline that March, leaving his son as the only candidate with enough signatures to get on the Democratic ballot. His son has held the seat ever since, and has become a political force in his own right.\n\n\"Hardy Williams indeed was a pioneer who has left a rich and lasting legacy,\" his son said in a statement. \"I say this as a legislator, as a resident of Philadelphia, and a son whose heart is broken. Our family mourns this painful loss.\"\n\nMr. Williams' was a household name in the West Philadelphia that Mayor Nutter grew up in. Mr. Williams, Nutter said, set the stage for the \"vast array\" of independent candidates, not just African Americans.\n\n\"Hardy Williams opened a lot of doors for a lot of people,\" said Nutter, who, in the Williams tradition, won his party's nomination without party support.\n\nW. Wilson Goode, Philadelphia's first African American mayor, said he credited Mr. Williams for the fact that today, the city's mayor, district attorney, police commissioner, and schools superintendent are African Americans.\n\n\"Clearly, 42 years after Hardy Williams lit that flame,\" Goode said, \"it burns very brightly in this city . . . because of his leadership and what he started.\"\n\nA generation of black leaders worked for Mr. Williams, many of them volunteers, forging their own political careers using his lessons.\n\n\"What made Hardy different from other individuals was, you felt his sincerity, you felt his passion,\" said State Rep. Kenyatta Johnson, \"and I feel that's what drew people to him.\"\n\nJohnson, 36, was in his 20s and looking for a mentor when he began working in Mr. Williams' district office. The state senator told him to keep the people's interests first - before politics, power, money, even friendship.\n\n\"If you put the people's needs first, you will be OK. If you work for the people, they'll decide if you should be elected or not,\" said Johnson, who defeated veteran legislator Harold James in the 2008 Democratic primary.\n\nU.S. Rep. Chaka Fattah (D., Phila.) said: \"Hardy Williams was a great Philadelphian, a towering and pioneering leader in the fight for political empowerment. We served together in the state Senate, where I learned a lot from him. . . .\n\n\"His inspirational campaign helped open the doors for me for progressive, game-changing politics.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Bob Brady, the city's Democratic Party boss, said Mr. Williams \"leaves a large legacy. He kicked open political doors, and by doing so he helped reshape the Philadelphia Democratic Party so that today it is a true reflection of our city's diversity.\"\n\nMr. Williams graduated from West Philadelphia High School in 1948, where he was a three-year star on its baseball, basketball, and football teams, before captaining the basketball and football teams in his senior year and being voted his class' best athlete. In a school that was then predominantly white, he was voted the most popular in his class.\n\nHe did not slow down at Pennsylvania State University, where in 1950 he became the first African American to play basketball, was in the top 20 of his 1952 graduating class, and was president of the Pi Lambda Sigma pre-law honorary society. He was a member of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc. After two years as an Air Force lieutenant, with service in South Korea, he returned to graduate from the University of Pennsylvania Law School.\n\nBesides his son, he is survived by another son, Clifford; daughters Lisa Smith and Lanna Watkins-Minor; five brothers; and four grandchildren. He is also survived by his former wife, Carole Williams-Green."
