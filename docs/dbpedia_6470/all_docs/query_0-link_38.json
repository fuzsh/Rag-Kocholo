        "text": "The reason you aren’t succeeding What self-made millionaires are doing—Are you aligning your actions with theirs in 2024? In an era where you can analyse the paths others took to success, are you ready to follow in their footsteps? Which communities are you aiming to join this year?\n\nI am so proud of my Air Force Academy classmate, Dave Won, who recently gave a Ted Talk at Valparaiso University. Dave's talk was very powerful and gave me a few tools to offer people I work with in the military. Overall, I think his talk would be very helpful for young adults ages 18-27 who are trying to learn how to have a healthy relationship with money and the power of investing. His framework, \"Budget Captain,\" can help first-generation upper-middle-class individuals balance the pressures, responsibilities, and traumas surrounding money. If you or someone you know struggles with a positive relationship with money, give it a watch. https://lnkd.in/gdvjcYA2 #money #personalfinance #debt #financialeducation #financialfreedom #budgetcaptain\n\nJoin Israel Defense Forces (IDF) brigadier general Meir Finkel and The Hoover Institution, Stanford University senior fellow HR McMaster as they examine the current state of the Israel-Gaza war and the geopolitics of the broader #MiddleEast. In this episode of #Battlegrounds, Dr. Finkel shares his insights on the Israeli campaign to destroy #Hamas in #Gaza, examining the objectives of Hamas and how the IDF is responding to prevent civilian casualties during a humanitarian crisis. They also discuss the Israel-Iran proxy conflict and how the wars in the Middle East might evolve in the coming months and years. https://lnkd.in/gfPsTCpy\n\nMay is a wonderful month to celebrate AANHPI, moms, spring, graduation, and great programming. I personally have a few private speaking engagements about Asian American life, but I invite you to participate in one of five public, free, and online AANHPI month programs organized by NAAAP. Topics include South Asian Voices in the Creative Space, To P or not to P, transracial adoption, Resilience & PRIDE. https://lnkd.in/dqC4GWzs\n\nPreserving Europe’s cultural heritage: the significance of Jewish heritage in building civil society In the diverse tapestry of Europe’s cultural heritage, the preservation and promotion of Jewish heritage stand out as not only essential for historical accuracy but also pivotal in shaping a cohesive and inclusive civil society. From ancient synagogues to Holocaust memorials, Jewish heritage sites across Europe serve as poignant reminders of both shared history and the importance of collective memory. Jewish heritage plays a vital role in shaping European civil society by promoting inclusivity, understanding, and historical accuracy. Its preservation is not only a tribute to the contributions of Jewish communities but also a testament to Europe’s commitment to combating prejudice and upholding human dignity. By safeguarding Jewish heritage, Europe reaffirms its commitment to a more cohesive and compassionate future. Read the full article on our website: https://lnkd.in/eS7SSDF5"
