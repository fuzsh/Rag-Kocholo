        "text": "In the halls of Brookdale Community College, a seed was planted that would transform into a business aimed at revolutionizing the career services and hiring landscape. Go 4 HIRE, the brainchild of Jared Logan, MBA, CPRW, from Freehold, NJ, graduate, and Brookdale alum, is a beacon for job seekers and companies looking for the perfect match. Logan’s journey from a biology major to developing a business in the hiring field shows how much Brookdale Community College can shape its students’ futures, guiding them to find paths they might not have expected and leading them to successful careers.\n\nChoosing Brookdale over other institutions, the Go 4 HIRE founder began his educational journey fueled by a desire to explore and clarify his career aspirations. “When I graduated Freehold Township High School, I applied to all the schools. Rutgers, Monmouth, you name it. But I did not know which way I wanted to go,” he recalls. The decision to attend Brookdale was pivotal. “It was the best educational decision that I made,” he asserts, emphasizing the unique blend of academic rigor, supportive community, and the serendipitous discovery of his true calling.\n\n“I think what makes Brookdale special is its culture and the people. The campus is just the right size; it’s big, but not too big. I have friends who at their institutions were in huge classes with like 150 to 200 students, and they couldn’t really get to know anyone. That wasn’t a problem here. Teachers were always available, which made it feel welcoming. It’s also in a nice area with great people. I’ve made friends here that I still talk to, and we all agree on how good it is and how great it was.”\n\nAt Brookdale, every day of the week for two and a half years was a step toward building a network of connections and clarifying his goals. Professors like Robert Gant and Robert Martens of Biology became mentors and, eventually, friends. Despite initially following a pre-med track inspired by his mother’s medical career, Logan realized his passion lay not in the medical field but in leveraging personal connections to make a tangible difference in people’s lives.\n\nTransitioning from biology to business, Logan acquired his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in business from Monmouth University and Rider University, respectively. This academic journey equipped him with a unique blend of scientific inquiry and business acumen, laying the groundwork for Go 4 HIRE.\n\nGo 4 HIRE, standing for Hiring, Interview, Resume, and Essay, is holding a ribbon cutting Wednesday, March 27, 2024, from 5:30 – 7:30 p.m. at the Freehold office located in the Woodhull House, 63 W. Main Street Unit L-3, Freehold, NJ 07728. Offering career services and facilitating hiring, the company focuses on graduates and professionals seeking career transitions, embodying the spirit of continuous learning and adaptation.\n\nLogan’s story exemplifies the life-altering impact of a Brookdale Community College education. It demonstrates how a nurturing academic environment can spark the entrepreneurial spirit, drive innovation, and, most importantly, guide students toward fulfilling their potential in unexpected and rewarding ways."
