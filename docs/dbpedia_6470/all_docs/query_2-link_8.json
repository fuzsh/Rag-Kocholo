He served on the Lexington Richland Five Board of Trustees for 20 years,10 years as the chairman. He also served as the vice chairman and board secretary. Robert led with compassion, a gentle nature and a determination to help our students succeed. He was a fierce supporter of public education.

He was the son of the late Frances Katherine and Wade Hampton Gantt.

Robert advocated for public education as the president of the SC School Boards Association. In 2021, Robert was inducted into the inaugural Dutch Fork High School Hall of Fame.\n\nRobert’s faith in God was solid and unshakable. He loved his family deeply and adored spending time with them.
