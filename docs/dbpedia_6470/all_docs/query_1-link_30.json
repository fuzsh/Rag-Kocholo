Robert Gonzalez Gant share's about coming out as a proud gay man in Hollywood, and the shift that is possible for those who struggled with acceptance. Robert has been a full-time actor, producer, and writer for over twenty-six years. He was a cast member of the groundbreaking Showtime series QUEER AS FOLK and was an early actor to come out publicly in 2002. His wide-ranging credits, both dramatic and comedic, include such shows as 13 REASONS WHY, NCIS, SUPERGIRL, MIKE & MOLLY, HOT IN CLEVELAND, BONES, SHAMELESS, and FRIENDS, among many others. He co-wrote, co-produced, and starred in the Netflix-released, historical biopic MILADA, which was nominated for 10 Czech Lion awards (that country's version of the Oscars), including best film. Robert was also a producing partner in the production company, Mythgarden, whose film SAVE ME premiered at Sundance. Along with his writing partner, he is actively writing, developing, and pitching original scripted series and features. Robert has been involved with a number of philanthropic organizations, especially those focused on aging in the LGBTQ community, and was a board member for Gay and Lesbian Elder Housing. He has also been a member of recovery communities for over twenty years. Robert received his B.A. in English Literature from the University of Pennsylvania and his law degree from the Georgetown University Law Center.
