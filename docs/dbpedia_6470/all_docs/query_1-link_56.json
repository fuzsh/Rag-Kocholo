        "text": "LOCK HAVEN – At the 137th commencement of Lock Haven University, Robert M. Kurtz Jr. was presented with an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Public Service.\n\n“There is no one that I know of who deserves this recognition today more that Mr. Robert M. Kurtz Jr.” These words, spoken my Lock Haven University Trustee, Guy Graham, were spoken of a man whose legacy is well known within the Clearfield community, as well as the community of Lock Haven University.\n\nKurtz is a founding father of the Lock Haven University Clearfield campus. He and his wife, Marilyn, have given to the community of Clearfield in many ways.\n\nThe Chamber of Commerce, the town library, a local church…these are only a few of the local area to which Kurtz and his family have donated. One of their most important gifts to the Clearfield community, however, was the donation of more than half the value of the land where the Lock Haven University Clearfield campus is located. This donation, coupled with other contributions to the Clearfield Educational Foundation, have a value of more than $750,000.\n\nThe family’s business, Kurtz Bros., spanning three generations, has provided school supplies to the entire region of Clearfield. Most of the books the children of Clearfield learned from were printed by Kurtz Bros. Little did the Kurtz family realize 120 years ago their contribution to education, especially to that of higher education, would be so exceptional.\n\nKurtz, who still serves as the chief executive officer of Kurtz Bros., graduated from The Mercerburg Academy, the University of Redlands, the Pennsylvania State University and served in the U.S. Army in Germany.\n\nThroughout the years, he has served as a leader of many civil, charitable, historical and economic organizations in the Clearfield area. In addition to being a business owner, and providing service to his community, Kurtz is also an award-winning amateur photographer and publisher of several books.\n\nBefore hooding Kurtz and presenting him with his diploma, Dr. Michael Fiorentino Jr. said, “It is obvious why we are recognizing Mr. Kurtz for his public service in support of the Clearfield community and Lock Haven University.”\n\n“I would like to express my thanks. This was one of the honors I would have never expected,” said Kurtz. “I’m just overwhelmed and floored by it. Thank you, Lock Haven, and thank you, all of you.”"
