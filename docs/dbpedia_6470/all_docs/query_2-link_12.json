        "text": "Penn undergrad, Georgetown Law, went back to acting (he’d been a child actor) after the LA branch of Baker McKenzie closed.\n\nHe’s handsome, a pretty good actor, but man I just don’t understand leaving a lucrative job at a great firm for something so sporadic and unstable as show business.\n\nHe decided to come out as gay while he was on that show. The showrunners and writers were, but Randy Harrison was the only other gay actor.\n\nI didn't mean QAF. He did 11 episodes of Popular in 2000/2001 and then an episode of Nip/Tuck in 2008. But Murphy hasn't cast him since then.\n\nI went to college with someone by that last name. He had the same Dudley Doright chin. I wonder if they're related."
