        "text": "Dr. Michael and Nancy Leininger Scholarship\n\nMike and Nancy were destined to be together. They attended the same elementary school, high school and both graduated from the University of Utah with degrees in education. As teachers, they had many conversations about how best to create engaging curriculum and classroom experiences for their students. While raising their two daughters, Carrie and Anne, they always found time to volunteer in the classrooms, PTA, Girl Scouts, Junior League and church. Dr. Mike began as the Assistant Principal of La Canada High School in 1987. In 1995, he was promoted to Principal, and in 2005, he was promoted to the District Office. Nancy taught 2nd grade at Palm Crest Elementary School where she became legendary throughout the entire school district for her kind and compassionate skills. In their retirement, they have become the dynamic duo of volunteerism dedicating themselves to the welfare and uplifting of elementary, junior high and high school students. In honor of the Leiningers’ commitment to service, this scholarship will be awarded to a student dedicated and active in service to their school and community.\n\nDon and Jo Seastrom Scholarship\n\nThe scholarship was established by the Seastrom Family. Don and Jo Seastrom were long-time volunteers in the Foothill community of La Cañada Flintridge. They believed a well-rounded education consisted of three equally important components: book learning, survival and recreational skills and social/people skills. This scholarship will be awarded to a student interested in a career in manufacturing or electrical engineering, or learning a vocational skill (tool and die maker, machinist, or draftsperson).\n\nRobert and Betsy Sorbonne Scholarship\n\nThis scholarship was implemented by Rita and Frank Gooch in memory of Rita’s parents. This scholarship will be awarded to a student interested in dentistry or in attending USC. Robert and Betsy were both raised in a single-parent household during the Great Depression. They learned the value of hard work at an early age as well as the importance of furthering one’s education. Robert Sorbonne was in the medical field as a dentist for over 40 years. Rita Gooch, their daughter is also in the dental field."
