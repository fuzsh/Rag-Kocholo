He has volunteered and worked for St. Philip’s after-school care and summer programs off and on over the years. Mr. Hernandez attended the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) and graduated from the Art Institute of Dallas in 2014. Prior to joining St. Philip’s, he taught art for the Dallas Independent School District.\n\nHe’s thrilled to return to his elementary alma mater full time to give back to the youth through his artistic expertise, given St. Philip’s has always been such a big part of his life. An added benefit to working at St. Philip’s is the opportunity to visit his parents, who still reside in the home he grew up in, located a couple of blocks from the campus.\n\nWOW FACT: Mr. Hernandez provides freelance work in the art industry. He does graphic design, animation, fine art, and, most recently, has been spray painting murals across Texas.\n\nLife After St. Philip’s - Amber Jordan, Class of ‘00\n\nSt. Philip’s address – 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue – gave Amber Jordan a sense of possibility, community, and inclusiveness while she was a student. “I remember most during my time at St. Philip’s that we definitely appreciated that we held the same address as the White House,” says Ms. Jordan, currently a felony prosecutor with the Dallas County District Attorney’s Office. “Being a part of a thriving private school in South Dallas was always fascinating and impressive.”\n\nSt. Philip’s shaped Amber, along with her twin brother and older sister who are also alumni. Her family was very engaged and ingrained in the school. Amber’s father even served as president of the Dad’s Club. This is the school where she learned to recite and realize its powerfully inspiring creed. This is the school where she first learned bible verses. This is the school that helped form her appreciation for justice.\n\n“Multiple people from various areas of my life have always told me that I should be a lawyer because when I see a wrong, I don’t let it go,” she explains. By 8th grade, Amber’s passion for helping people and ability to be outspoken and do the right thing intersected finally pushing her toward law. She earned her law degree from Howard University, where she says she gained a diverse perspective. “I didn’t realize all you can do with a law degree. I appreciate the degree I have, but I realize my passion is in the criminal law area,” she says. Ms. Jordan started with the Dallas County DA Office in May 2016 and has since, been promoted twice, most recently in October. She can see herself in this current role for the next 10 to 20 years but is not opposed to one day being a judge. At this time, however, in her budding career, she prefers being “on the ground” and in the “trenches” as a prosecutor.\n\nHer advice for the children gracing St. Philip’s halls and classrooms, today? ”Never give up and keep the faith.” Ms. Jordan always knew she could achieve what God called for her life, despite the challenges she faced, because she had a support system. A village to depend on."
