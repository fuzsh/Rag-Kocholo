Coor./Linebackers\n\nEmail\n\nagant2@fordham.edu\n\nAlma Mater\n\nMichigan '15\n\nExperience\n\n4th year at Fordham\n\nTwitter\n\ncoachgant14\n\nAll-Patriot League Performers Under Gant\n\n2023 2022 2021 James Conway, LB - First Team\n\nMatt Jaworski, DL - First Team\n\nNahil Perkins, DB - First Team\n\nClaudy Robinson, DL - Second Team\n\nStephen Williams II, DB - Second Team James Conway, LB - First Team\n\nRyan Greenhagen, LB - First Team\n\nJames Conway, LB - Second Team\n\nAllen Gant arrived at Fordham in July of 2021 after serving as the defensive coordinator/linebackers coach at West Virginia Wesleyan College in 2020-2021. After leading the Fordham linebackers in 2021 and 2022 he was promoted to defensive coordinator in 2023 and will continue to be in charge of the defense and the linebackers in 2024.\n\nLast fall Gant directed a Fordham defense that finished second in the Patriot League in scoring defense (24.7 points/game) and rushing defense (135.7 yards/game). The Fordham defense was led by linebacker James Conway, who was second in the League and fourth in the NCAA in tackles/game (11.7), defensive back Nahil Perkins, who led the League and was fourth in the nation in passes defended (1.5/game), and defensive lineman Matt Jaworski, who led the team and was 12th in the NCAA FCS in sacks/game (0.82).\n\nIn his second year at Rose Hill, Gant coached two All-Patriot League selections, grad student Ryan Greenhagen and sophomore James Conway, both First Team picks. Greenhagen was also named a CSC Academic All-America®, the Patriot League Student-Athlete of the Year for football, and was a finalist for the Walter Campbell Trophy. Conway, a 2022 HERO Sports Sophomore All-American, led the Patriot League and was seventh in the NCAA FCS, in tackles/game (10.6) while Greenhagen was third in Patriot League and 24th in the NCAA FCS in tackles/game (9.4).\n\nIn 2021, the Fordham linebackers helped the Rams lead the Patriot League, and rank 20th in the NCAA FCS, in fumbles recovered, and rank third in the League in both tackles for loss and sacks per game. Ryan Greenhagen broke an NCAA record with 31 tackles in the opener at Nebraska and was leading the NCAA FCS in tackles/game when he suffered a season-ending injury at Lafayette while freshman James Conway was named Second Team All-Patriot League.\n\nIn 2019, Gant served as the defensive backs coach at Slippery Rock where he helped guide The Rock to the NCAA Division-II semi-finals after claiming the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference title. Gant returned to his alma mater Michigan for the 2018 season as a defensive intern. He assisted with the Wolverine outside linebackers and analyzed the pass game of opponents.\n\nGant was an outside linebacker and safety for the Wolverines from 2012-2015. His father, Tony, also played for Michigan as a safety and punt/kick returner from 1983-1985.\n\nThe Sylvania, Ohio, native graduated from Michigan in 2015 with a bachelor’s degree in Literature, Science and Arts. Gant and his wife, Lia, have a son, Allen Jr."
