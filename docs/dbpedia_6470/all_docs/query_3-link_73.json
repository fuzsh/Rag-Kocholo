I received my B.S. from the University of Akron and my M.S. from Case Western Reserve University. I then attended medical school at Ohio University, where I received my D.O. degree. My interests in medicine include primary care, preventative medicine, and Sports/MSK medicine.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy spending time with my friends and family, watching sports (especially my Cleveland Cavs, Browns, and Guardians), reading, and venturing to local restaurants and breweries. I have never lived outside of Ohio, so I am thrilled to become a part of the Charlottesville community that I have heard such incredible things about!\n\nNicole Lorenzi, MD\n\nPronouns: she/hers\n\nHometown: Montgomery, NJ\n\nI attended undergrad at the College of William and Mary where I fell in love with Virginia! During my time there I majored in biology and had lots of fun competing as part of the women’s ultimate frisbee team. After college, I returned home to attend medical school at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and adopted two cats, Benny and Remi, to serve as my study buddies! My interests in medicine include: sports medicine, women’s health, behavioral health, and teaching.\n\nIn my free time I enjoy playing sports and spending time outdoors. I love playing tennis and pickle ball with my friends and family. I also spend a lot time out on the water with my newly purchased kayak and paddle board! When I’m not outside, you can find me watching bad reality TV, playing board games (Catan and Ticket to Ride are my favorite), or doing some relaxing arts and crafts.\n\nMatthew Miracle, MD\n\nPronouns: he/him\n\nHometown: Boonville, Missouri\n\nHey there!

My name is Roberto Ramirez. I was born and raised in Aguas Buenas, Puerto Rico. I attended Johns Hopkins University, where I obtained my Bachelors degree in Natural Sciences and Latin American Studies.

I took a year off to serve with an AmeriCorps program in Philadelphia before attending medical school at the Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University. My current interests in medicine include medical education, underserved care, and behavioral health.\n\nOutside of medicine, I enjoy hiking, playing sports (mostly basketball, volleyball, and soccer), playing piano, and exploring new restaurants and coffee shops with my partner, Jared, who is a UVA child neurology resident.\n\nSarah Shapiro, MD\n\nPronouns: she/her/hers\n\nSarah is originally from Green Mountain Falls, Colorado, which is a tiny town of 600 people nestled in the Rockies.

Her interests in medicine include patient-advocacy and comprehensive care modalities, general dermatology and rheumatology, adolescent medicine, and procedural care.\n\nOutside of medicine, she enjoys off-trail hiking to look for cool bugs and frogs, cooking, and going out with friends.
