        "text": "FRANCIS BEDFORD (Aug. 13, 1815 – May 15, 1894) and WILLIAM BEDFORD (1846 – 1893)\n\nBY WILLIAM S. JOHNSON\n\n[THIS BIBLIOGRAPHY, FIRST POSTED IN 2012, WAS CORRECTED, REVISED AND EXPANDED IN 2023.].\n\nFrancis Bedford, born on August 13th, 1815, was the first son of the noted architect Francis Octavius Bedford, who had furthered the Greek Revival movement in the 1820s and the Gothic Revival movement during the 1830s as he designed at least nine churches which were built in London during that time. So Francis was immersed in the belief in the recovery of the historical past as a young man while he studied both architecture and lithography. He exhibited a drawing or painting of some architectural feature, such as “New Church at Turnstall,” (1833), “In Westminster Abbey,” (1846), “Canterbury Cathedral,” (1847) “Magdalen Tower, Oxford,” (1848), “York Minster,” (1849), etc., in the annual exhibitions of the Royal Academy at least nine times between 1833 and 1849. That he was well-versed in the history of architecture is clear from his articulate statement printed on the inside cover of his A Chart Illustrating the Architecture of Westminster Abbey. London: W. W. Robinson. [1846].\n\nThe immense flood of illustrated books, journals, pamphlets, and prints published in early Victorian Britain guaranteed a livelihood and a career for a young artist. By the mid-fifties Francis had brought together the talent, skills, and the network of editors and publishers, needed to establish himself as a lithographer skilled in illustrating journals and books specializing in architectural subjects, and he soon became widely regarded as a master in the chromolithographic process. The immense critical and public success in 1856 of Owen Jones’ The Grammar of Ornament. Illustrated by examples from various styles of ornament, with one hundred folio plates drawn on stone by Francis Bedford, cemented his reputation and then Bedford’s own The Treasury of Ornamental Art, (1857) and Art Treasures of the United Kingdom; from the Art Treasures Exhibition, Manchester. (1858) demonstrated Bedford’s further mastery of the medium.\n\nBedford began to photograph as an amateur sometime around 1852; taking up the new technology to aid himself in his lithographic work. His book, The Treasury of Ornamental Art, has been described as “probably the first important English work where photography was called into play to assist the draughtsman.”\n\nBut Bedford also began to pursue the creative aspects of photography as well. The 1850s was a period of enormous growth for photography in England. Frederick Scott Archer had just invented the wet-collodion process, and photography, though still difficult to use, suddenly became both more accessible and far more useful in a wide variety of ways. Archaeologists, anthropologists, botanists, geologists, art and architectural historians, scientists and learned men of every stripe were realizing that photography not only facilitated their studies, but that accurate, exact, and exactly duplicatable visual records made it possible to expand the dimensions of their respective disciplines beyond levels which had been impossible to reach before photography’s invention. Much of the leading research in chemistry and physics was being done by photographic scientists. Thus even conservative minds that could not decide whether photography was an art or merely a craft had to acknowledge that it certainly was a useful tool in the spread or diffusion of “useful knowledge” throughout the country, and agree in the role, both physically and metaphorically, that photographs played in support of the aims and needs of that generation.\n\nThe Great Industrial Exhibition held at the Crystal Palace in 1851, though considered a huge success, seems to have triggered a perception in England that it was in danger of losing its preeminent position as the greatest industrialized nation in the world. Driven by Prince Albert, a massive effort to expand education to the working classes and improve the scientific, industrial, and artistic knowledge of the citizenry of Great Britain was launched in the 1850s through the venue of newly formed semi-official organizations, such as the Society of Arts. The Royal Society of London formed the armature that tied the local and regional organizations to a centralized national level institution that could provide communications and other links across the existing divisions of class, education and culture. The Society offered organizational guidelines, provided discounts for book purchases for club libraries, provided knowledgeable lecturers on a wide range of topics, and toured traveling exhibitions useful for publicity and fund-raising projects.\n\nPhotography, widely described as one of the keystone scientific/artistic inventions that defined the modern age, provided one very powerful tool in this program. The medium, combining attributes of both art and science, still held an undeniable glamour, and was one of the most accessible and approachable of the new technological marvels. And photography played an extremely important early role in the activities of this Society and in its expanded educational mission. The Society sponsored the first hugely publicized and highly popular photographic exhibition in England. And the Society then became the parent organization for the Photographic Society, (later called the London Photographic Society and later still the Royal Photographic Society). The Photographic Society’s first exhibition displayed 1500 prints by many photographers; and this exhibition became a popular annual event. In addition to the large annual exhibitions in London, the Society of Arts also organized exhibitions of several hundred photographs which it traveled to many of the organizations of the Union, which, in turn, used these as a catalyst to organize lectures, or for fundraising soirees and fetes for the scores of Mechanic’s institutions and other adult educational organizations around Great Britain – and occasionally around the world.\n\nPrince Albert and Queen Victoria played a leading role in fostering England’s arts, sciences and manufactures with their patronage and they supported the fledgling art/science of photography by purchasing creative photographs for their extensive art collections, by lending their public support to the newly formed Photographic Society, and by allowing access for selected photographers to their public lives.\n\nIn 1854 Queen Victoria and Prince Albert commissioned Francis Bedford to photograph art objects in the Royal Collection, an extensive task that Bedford performed admirably. Bedford exhibited some of these prints in the inaugural exhibition of the Photographic Society, held in 1854. Bedford, who had probably taken up photography as a tool to assist him in providing accurate and detailed renderings of the architectural subjects he was drawing, soon began to investigate its creative aspects, and this led him to taking landscape views,as was then a common practice for British amateurs interesting in the “creative” possibilities of photography. In the second exhibition in 1855, Bedford exhibited “many views from Yorkshire, bright and sparkling bits most of them, which we are only sorry to find so small.” This was followed by “The Choir, Canterbury Cathedral,” in the 1856 exhibition; and then by many well-regarded architectural and landscape views almost every year for the next thirty-odd years.\n\nQueen Victoria purchased several of Bedford’s photographic landscapes from the Photographic Society exhibitions. Then in 1857 the Queen commissioned Bedford to secretly travel as her agent to Prince Albert’s birthplace in Coburg, Bavaria, to make a group of some sixty views as a surprise birthday present for the Prince Consort. Documents make it clear that Bedford was treated throughout this event as a favored guest, affiliated with the most powerful monarch in the world, and not as commercial tradesman performing a task. At this time Bedford also photographed the important “Art Treasures Exhibition” in Manchester to provide sources for his chromolithograph illustrations for the Treasures of the United Kingdom, published in 1858. This entire project had been fostered by Prince Albert as part of his ongoing support for contemporary arts and crafts practice in England.\n\nBedford’s social status as a gentleman in Victorian England helped define the range of opportunities available to him, and along with his undoubted talent and drive, structured the expansion and development of his career as he transitioned, as had a number of his contemporaries, from an amateur into a professional photographer; earning his living and eventually building a business empire that made him into a wealthy man.\n\nFrancis Bedford used the wet plate process throughout his entire career, well after various dry plate processes were available to photographers. By 1857 Bedford was being mentioned by various critics as one of the premier landscape photographers in England, a reputation he maintained throughout his lifetime. As one critic defining the accepted standard of quality for a good picture maker at that time, stated “… A happy choice of subject, skill in the composition of their picture, due attention to contrast of light and shade, and to gradation of distance and atmospheric perspective; but we think that we see in Mr. Bedford’s works the most complete union of all the qualities which must be united in a good photographic picture.”\n\nAfter Roger Fenton retired from photography in the early 1862; his mantle as the leading landscape photographer was taken up by Bedford. By 1865 “Bedford” is one of a handful of names that is routinely used by critics or writers as an example to denote high-quality and creativity in photography. Thus, as the British were believed to excel in the genre of landscape views, Bedford was considered to be one of the best and certainly one of the best-known photographers of the day.\n\nFurthermore, his name became associated with the continuing struggle among photography’s advocates to have the medium accepted as a high art practice. “…For photography, then, in both facts and theory, we have able advocates, and ultimately the rank it claims must be awarded to it; and I trust, when that day comes, we shall not forget the pioneers without whom such crowning honour and distinction might never have been obtained. Of what use would be my assertions or arguments, or those of “any other man,” if we could claim no Rejlander, no Robinson, no Lake Price, no Bedford, and no Wilson? Who would have dared, in the absence of their works, to make for photography the claim now occupying our attention?”\n\nWall, Alfred H. “In Search of Truth.” British Journal of Photography 10:194 (July 15, 1863):285-286. [“Read at a meeting of the Edinburgh Photographic Society, July 1st, 1866.”]\n\nIn 1859 Bedford traveled through North Wales making landscape photographs and stereo views, which he released commercially in the spring of 1860 through the publisher Catherall and Prichard, of Chester. “…The series of the latter is large, and comprehends a considerable number of the leading objects which excite the wonder and admiration of tourists, and have been the special delights of artists time out of mind. The photographs are of good size, and it is scarcely requisite to say, are of the highest possible merit, — the name of Mr. Bedford will sufficiently guarantee their excellence. …The stereoscopic views are certainly among the best that have been produced, supplying a rich intellectual feast: to us they have given enjoyment of the rarest character — and so they may to our readers, for they are attainable at small cost. We name them at random, but they are all of famous places — Pont Aberglaslyn, Capel Curig, Llyn Ogwen, Bettys-y-coed, Beddgelert, Pont-y-gilli, Trefriew, Llanberis, Pen Llyn, with views also of the Britannia Bridge, Carnarvon Castle, &c.” (Art-Journal, Apr. 1860).\n\n“When Francis Bedford, that prince of the early landscape photographers, began, in 1858, under the auspices of a Chester firm of publishers, to do for large districts what the local photographers had hitherto done for their own little domains, he soon found that first-rate pictorial work had little commercial value. He began with Wales, and afterwards annexed other regions. His work at that time consisted almost entirely of stereoscopic slides, and the imperative demand of the travelling public was that they should be “clear,” and this great artist had to manufacture the article to order. Every item of the view, from the stones in the near church or chapel to the distant mountains, had not only to have all the boldness and definition to be obtained in the clearest weather, but had to be helped by those subtle devices of which he was a master.\n\nBesides the stereoscopic slides—it would be difficult to convey to the modern photographer any idea of the immense number sold in those primitive days— Bedford occasionally made larger pictures to suit his own cultivated taste, which were the delight of our exhibitions, but had no interest for the general public, who at that time were sufficiently satisfied with the miracle of definition photography continued to present to their still wondering senses, and who had no eyes for higher qualities. I mention these pictures to show that the fault lay not in the artist, but in his patrons. Although the work manufactured for the tourist had to be suited to the bad taste of the buyers, it was always the best of its kind. The best points of even poor subjects were selected with curious skill; there were few figures admitted in those days of long exposure, but when they were allowed to appear they were in the right place, admirably posed; they were always the addition wanted to make a picture, not the accidental crowd of figures in the wrong place that instantaneous exposures usually present to us.” (Robinson, H. P. “Rambling Papers. No. XXXI. — Local Views.” Photographic News 39:1922 (July 5, 1895): 424-426.)\n\nIn 1862 Bedford’s strong position with the Royal Family was demonstrated again when he was “one of only eight gentlemen” invited to join the Prince of Wales (the future king of England) on a four-month tour of the Near East. Bedford made about 210 views on this trip. The trip was followed avidly by the British press and a number of Bedford’s photographs were published (in woodcut form) in the London Illustrated News and elsewhere throughout 1862 and later. Bedford also had a one-man exhibition (Still an unusual event at the time.) upon returning to London. The immense prestige garnered by Bedford through these activities buttressed his reputation as one of the leading landscape photographers of the day, both within the photographic community and in the minds of the general populace as Bedford became one of the handful of photographers who was widely recognized outside of the photographic community.\n\nDay & Son, “Lithographers to the Queen, Illustrated, Illuminated, & General Book & Fine-Art Publishers,” who had published Bedford’s earlier chromo-lithographic work, published in 1863 the three volume Photographic Pictures made by Mr. Francis Bedford during the Tour in the East, in which, by command, he accompanied H. M. H. the Prince of Wales, which contained 172 original photographs. This effort was somewhat marred by the fact that Day & Son, one of the largest and most prestigious art publishers of the era, went into liquidation in 1868 and their stock was sold off and broken up in a series of auctions throughout the year. They still held several hundred copies of Bedford’s Egypt,…, the first volume of this publication, in stock and the fact that Bedford’s book was one of the dozen or so titles featured throughout the auction descriptions throughout the year indicates the prestige value placed upon the work. Originally priced at a luxurious 2l. 2s., the work was resold and eventually remaindered for 14s. 6d. per copy. This at least had the effect of making his work accessible to a larger number of people, although to truly succeed as a commercial landscape photographer at that time one had to work as a stereo view maker.\n\nFrancis returned from the Near Eastern tour to again begin photographing landscape views in England, focusing his interest in the south-west of England and the West Midlands, while going again and again to his favorite sites in North Wales and Devonshire, which he photographed almost annually from 1863 until at least 1884. Previously Bedford had focused on taking photographs and leaving the complex process of commercial scale printing and distribution through other established publishing sources, but at some point soon after his return from the Near Eastern tour Francis Bedford established his own company for producing the popular stereo views, and the company flourished and grew to be one of the three or four largest producer of stereo cards through the remainder of the century – making Bedford a very wealthy man.\n\nThroughout the 1860s the many large national or international exhibitions, (Some displaying thousands of photographs and seen by scores of thousands of visitors.) provided a major venue for photographers. Bedford diligently participated in the annual Photographic Society exhibitions, the Edinburgh Photographic Society exhibitions, the international expositions in London in 1862 and in Paris in 1867, and in many other regional exhibitions in Great Britain and in Europe, almost always winning awards and the usual degree of high praise for his landscapes.\n\nFrancis Bedford was elected to the Photographic Society of London (now the Royal Photographic Society) in 1857? and then elected a member of Council to that organization in 1858. In 1861 he was elected Vice President of the Photographic Society, a position of great prestige. Bedford was active in that organization, periodically serving as one of the Vice-Presidents or as an officer on the Council off and on for the next thirty years. F. Bedford is listed as Vice-President during the years 1863 to 1868. During 1866-1867, Francis Bedford, serving as a Vice-President, chaired five of the monthly meetings, provided the negative for the annual “presentation print” which was distributed to the membership, and participated in the annual exhibition. Frequently, when he was not serving as a Vice-President he served on the Council. F. Bedford is listed on the Council in 1858 to 1861, and from 1871 to 1888. These were rotating positions, renewable each year in theory, and Bedford was voted into them again and again. In fact, Francis is not listed as an officer of the Society between 1858 and 1888 only during the years 1869 and 1870. His son William Bedford was elected to the Society in Feb. 1870, voted to the Council in 1877 and for many of those years joining his father on the Council from 1877 to 1888; and serving thereafter on his own until his death in 1893. During this period The Photographic Society of London (later renamed the Photographic Society of Great Britain) held an important place in British photographic practice and the lectures and exhibitions held by the organizations often defined the most creative, most vital and important aspects of the medium.\n\nBoth father and son seemed to be well-respected, and both seemed to provide a moderate, stabilizing and beneficial influence on the activities and actions of the Society during the thirty years of their presence. Both Francis and William Bedford had also been members of the North London Photographic Association during the 1860s. “…The Council notice with regret the dissolution of a useful, and at one time active, auxiliary of this Society which has existed for more than twelve years in the metropolis, under the title of the North-London Photographic Association.” (Photographic Journal (Feb. 16, 1870): 198.)\n\nWhen this “auxiliary” organization folded, Francis seems to have once again played a more active role in the Photographic Society of London, and William was elected to the Society in February 1870. By 1876 Francis is back on the Council again. This is the year when William seems to blossom, winning a great deal of praise for his landscape views in the annual exhibition, including the statement that his work “…shows that the mantle of the father has fallen upon the son.” In 1878 both father and son were still active participants in the Society, the son, on the Council again, organizing many of the tasks of that group, and the father again elected to a Vice-Presidency to fill a sudden vacancy in the organization. Both Francis and his son William were still displaying landscape views in the annual exhibition in 1878, but by the late 1870s, with Francis reaching into his sixties and having achieved universal acclaim, the weight of the activity seems to have shifted from the father to the son. Francis also contributed liberally to local photographic societies exhibitions and events throughout the United Kingdom during these years.\n\n“From this time until 1884, (Francis was 68 years old.) when he relinquished his business to his son William, he went annually to the country to take fresh negatives, chiefly in North Wales and Devonshire. He had two children, Arthur, who died in 1867, and William, who died in 1893, and whose departure and merits are still fresh in all our memories. The wife of Francis Bedford died in 1888; this was a great blow to him, and long preyed upon his mind. He was extremely painstaking in his work. Once he waited at Lynmouth for a fortnight to get a required satisfactory pictorial effect at the time of high tide. He had certain standards of his own, and when either negatives or prints did not come up to those standards, he destroyed them ruthlessly. He was a great hater of crowds, disliked photographing even in small villages; he preferred solitude, and loved the mountain and the moor in their wildest aspects; he said that in the midst of such scenes he looked up from nature to nature’s God. He was also partial to quiet scenes in country lanes. He was never of strong constitution, and many in his place would have given up work earlier; however, he did not do much actual hard work himself, but he directed everything. He was of a retiring disposition, exceedingly courteous in his manner, he was also considerate and kindly to those who worked under him. He was slow to make friends, but when he made one the friendship was true and lasting. He was pure in thought and speech, and retained all his mental faculties until the last moment.” (Photography: The Journal of the Amateur, the Profession & the Trade (May 31, 1894)\n\nPORTFOLIO OF VIEWS\n\nIn 1859 Bedford traveled through North Wales making landscape photographs and stereo views, which he released commercially in the spring of 1860 through the publisher Catherall and Prichard, of Chester. Bedford went to the West Midlands, visiting his favorite sites in North Wales and Devonshire, which he photographed almost annually until at least 1884. These stereo views were issued in series, “North Wales Illustrated Series,” “Devonshire Illustrated Series,” etc., throughout his lifetime, and in some cases these series consisted of two to three hundred images.\n\n“The names we have just written in juxtaposition, North Wales and Francis Bedford, will suggest at once to most of our readers some very lovely and picturesque stereographs: glorious scenery and perfect photography combined. Abounding with views pre-eminently adapted to the stereoscope. Wales has been a favourite resort with landscape photographers and its scenery has been done in almost every style. Who for instance, is not familiar with the Rustic Bridge at Beddgelert? But how few have obtained such a picture as this before us, No. 174 of the series? Nothing could more forcibly illustrate how far the photographer may also be an artist than these pictures, and the taste, judgment and feeling of the beautiful which has regulated their selection. …” “Critical Notices.” PHOTOGRAPHIC NEWS 4:120 (Dec. 21, 1860): 400-401.\n\nDEVONSHIRE ILLUSTRATED SERIES\n\n“…In all this Exhibition there is no man’s work, take it all in all, comparable, in our opinion, to Mr. Bedford’s, whether it be of subjects architectural—as his interior views of Wells Cathedral and his exterior subjects from Exeter Cathedral—or natural, as the rocks we have referred to. and other Devonshire scenes. Besides other merits, Mr. Bedford seems to us to have carried the perfect rendering of reflected lights and half tones further than any of our photographers. This is the crux of photographic art. Nothing can be conceived more delicate than the gradations from highest light to deepest shadow in the Ilfracombe subject; nothing fuller of aerial effect than the bit of the Chapter-house vestibule, Bristol. Mr. Bedford appears to us to show peculiarly sound judgment in his selection of subjects….” The Times, January 18, 1861.\n\n“Criticism on the Exhibition.” PHOTOGRAPHIC JOURNAL, BEING THE JOURNAL OF THE PHOTOGRAPHIC SOCIETY. 7:106. (Feb. 15, 1861): 116-117.\n\nGLOUCESTERSHIRE, ETC.\n\n“When Francis Bedford, that prince of the early landscape photographers, began, in 1858, under the auspices of a Chester firm of publishers, to do for large districts what the local photographers had hitherto done for their own little domains, he soon found that first-rate pictorial work had little commercial value.

The mounting, as well as the general get-up, was fastidiously careful. All this was art of a kind as far as circumstances would allow….”\n\nRobinson, H. P. “Rambling Papers.

W. W. King, Esq., in the Chair….” “…The Chairman then read a paper “On Architectural Photography.”\n\n“It must be generally conceded that architectural photography has attained a position of greater prominence in the science than any other branch thereof, and this for two very good reasons:-—first, that the subjects themselves are not liable to be affected by wind, that enemy to photographers—so dangerous, indeed, that Mr. Jabez Hughes, in his excellent little work, advises the reader never to photograph on windy days; and, next, that the subjects possess a permanent interest from their clear individuality. Landscapes, beautiful as they are, cannot successfully compete with them in this respect, for one beautiful view may be exceedingly like another: we pass it by in our portfolios and think but little more about it. But the representation of a piece of architecture is altogether different. There the photograph appears to the greatest advantage: we at once recognize the building, and can, if need be, identify every stone or saint whose sculptured effigy adorns a niche or pinnacle. The building is seen from a point of view known and, therefore, familiar to all. We turn to the photograph again and again with renewed pleasure; for it forms a record of authority and weight. The architectural profession has not been slow to appreciate the value of photography, and the public themselves, now that archaeological and art knowledge are being more diffused, and taste somewhat improved, delight in the beautiful reminiscences of our ancient buildings. I think I may say that our countrymen are far in advance of any other nation in dealing with architectural and archaeological photography. Go to one of our photographic exhibitions, and you are sure to see some of Mr. F. Bedford’s exquisite productions, showing his possession of something more than a mere knowledge of photography—namely, a true appreciation of, and love for, the art works of our forefathers….” * * * * * The superiority of modern English ecclesiastical architecture must be generally admitted, from the greater love for old works which our architects evince by their works; and we see why architectural photography of ancient remains should be more practised in England than in France. I think we may say that the photographs of interiors at the present time leave little or nothing to be desired. I must refer again to the honoured name of Mr. Bedford and to Mr. Good. Their works show the advance which has been made in photographing the interiors of our cathedrals and churches, as do also the stereoscopic slides by the other photographers I have named. Of course, photographers, as a rule, will take subjects which are most popular, those most known belong to that class; for it is nothing more than a mere truism to say that people will patronize things known, though they may be ugly, rather than a beautiful object which they have not seen. Still, it is a great thing to have some old objects from a new point of view….” “North London Photographic Association.” PHOTOGRAPHIC JOURNAL, THE JOURNAL OF THE PHOTOGRAPHIC SOCIETY 12:188 (Dec. 15, 1867): 152-155.\n\nMONMOUTHSHIRE ILLUSTRATED SERIES\n\nWARWICKSHIRE ILLUSTRATED SERIES\n\nWORCESTERSHIRE VIEWS.\n\n“Mr. Bedford’s last issue of stereographs is timely, consisting, as the views do, chiefly of scenes in Warwickshire, a county abounding at once in natural and in architectural beauties, and in hallowed and venerable associations. Perhaps no spot in England possesses, within the area of a few miles, so much to please the eye, and call up eventful memories. Stratford on-Avon, with its homely cottage in Henley Street, and noble Church, together with the neighbouring Shottery and Charlecote — the goal of many a pilgrimage; Warwick Castle, Guy’s Cliff’, and Kenilworth; Stoneleigh and its noble deer-park, and the Forest of Arden; and quaint old Coventry, with its three tall spires, its treasures of ancient and modern architecture, and its legends; pretty and fashionable Leamington, with its urban charms. The county abounds with scenes famous in English history, and Nature has been prodigal of those calm beauties which constitute the genuine English landscape. Mr. Bedford has produced nearly two hundred stereographs of the scenes of chief importance in the country. In such a number we might naturally expect to find varying degrees of excellence and interest, but by far the greater number are very perfect indeed, good alike in photography and in pictorial qualities.”\n\n“Critical Notices.” PHOTOGRAPHIC NEWS 8:289 (Mar. 18, 1864): 136.\n\n“Messrs. Catterall and Pritchard, of Chester, have sent us some photographs and stereoscopic slides, the productions of the eminent photographer, Bedford, which we have examined with exceeding pleasure. Those of size represent interiors in Hereford Cathedral; more especially views of the rood-screen and reredos, manufactured by Skidmore, of Coventry, which attracted so much attention at the International Exhibition in 1862. The smaller views are very varied: they represent the more attractive objects to be found at Hereford, Warwick, Cheltenham, Gloucester, Malvern, Coventry, Stratford-on-Avon, Kenilworth, and Chester. The points are in all cases well chosen. They thoroughly exhibit several of the most interesting “historic” cities and towns of England. In execution, the stereoscopic slides are clear, sharp, and of great excellence in all respects. The publishers have our thanks for the instruction and enjoyment they have thus afforded us.”\n\n“Minor Topics of the Month.” ART-JOURNAL 27:6 (June 1,1865): 194.\n\nTHE HOLY LAND, EGYPT, CONSTANINOPLE, ATHENS, ETC., ETC.\n\n[From the book Bedford, Francis.

How few of us who remember distinctly the first efforts of photography in taking the imprints of feathers, leaves, and bits of lace would have predicted from those childish essays, so great, so wonderful, so rapidly produced, an industry as photography has now become! Not that we are at all disposed to sing an unmitigated praise of photographers or their pictures, for with thorough artist’s feelings we see in their ordinary productions the defects of composition, the absence of that picture-painting of unspoken thoughts, and the want of many another quality that goes to make a perfect picture, while we as painfully perceive in many a way the deleterious effects of their productions on the prospects and qualities of painter-artists; but its good outbalances its evils, and photography flourishes and increases.” * * * * * “…In Mr. Bedford’s charming scenes in Egypt and the Holy Land, taken during the travels of the Prince of Wales, there is the same remarkable clearness and precision of architectural details, although his pictures are on a far smaller scale than those we have referred to, and this notwithstanding his great and successful efforts to pictorialize his views. In this latter respect his use of his optical instrument, his judicious choice of figures and selections of their positions, with the various delicate and unexposed manoeuvres to produce effects, and the tender manipulation of his pictures, render them merely works of art, and take Mr. Bedford out of the ranks of manipulators, and place him in that of true artists….” “From the “London Review.”\n\n“Photography as an Industry.” PHOTOGRAPHIC NEWS 8:290 (Mar. 24, 1864): 153-154.\n\nFRANCIS BEDFORD BIBLIOGRAPHY By William S.

(POSTED May 2012, REVISED June, 2023)\n\n[I have compiled and now posted this bibliography to test my belief that current technologies have made it possible to develop a very flexible research tool that can permit a scholar to access a wider range of information and provide a more nuanced look into the functioning of any particular era in the history of photography. This bibliography is composed from the Nineteenth-Century Photography. An Annotated Bibliography 1839-1879, by William S. Johnson. Boston: G. K. Hall & Co., 1990, to which I’ve added a key-word search of my current bibliographic project of indexing more than 800 periodical titles published in the USA and England between 1835 and 1869. After 1869 additional references were drawn from other random projects or sources that I had on hand and a key-word literature search of the internet. Not every important source is on the internet and even though the size of this work (More than 800 pages.) surprised me; nevertheless, it should not be considered an exhaustive survey of the literature published after that date.

The first at the top is the ancient coat of the see, and the other is the arms of the city of York. Below these is the archiepiscopal mitre, as it is now borne with the ducal cincture, an appendage not found in the ancient mitres of Archbishops, as may be seen in the brass of Archbishop Greenfield, figured in Plate XX. The four lower coats are those of the Chapter of York, and of Bishop Skirlaw, at the top, and of St. Wilfrid, and of King Edwin, at the bottom. These four occupy the sides of the great Lantern-tower, in the interior: the two last (p. 192) are of course only conventionally appropriated to the persons whose names they bear.

[“…The biographers describe in very enthusiastic language the beauties of a folio volume of fifty photographs by fifty different hands, and those of eminence, to which Mr. Whittingham, of Chiswick, has attached fifty pages of letterpress of corresponding beauty. The volume is a present to her Majesty, and is one of fifty-two copies of a series of photographs made by members of the Photographic Club—a newly-established club akin to the old Etching Club, and instituted to advance and record the progress of the art of photography. This is their first volume, and most wonderfully does it exhibit the progress which photography has made in England during the past year. Each of the fifty members sends fifty-two impressions of what he considers to be his best photograph with a description of the process used in obtaining it. Fifty copies are distributed among the fifty; the fifty-first is offered to her Majesty, and the fifty-second presented to the British Museum. Very wonderful, indeed, are some of the photographs in this very beautiful volume. We would especially point out as perfect in their truth to nature and adherence to art Mr. Batson’s “Babblecombe bay,” Mr. Henry Taylor’s “Lane Scene,” Mr. Llewellyn’s “Angler,” Mr. Bedford’s “Flowers,” Mr. Delamotte’s “Innocence,” Dr. Diamond’s “Interior of Holyrood,” Mr. Henry Pollock’s “Winsor Castle,” Mr. Mackinlay’s “Bediham Castle,” Mr. White’s “Garden Chair,” and Mr. John Stewart’s appropriate vignette to the volume—the portrait of Sir John Herschel.”]\n\nFurther:\n\n“‘A Copy of the Photographic Album’ (Fading Photographs).” Photographic Journal 7:114 (Oct. 15, 1861): 285-286.

Sir,-As the last volume of the ‘Photographic Album’ is now before me, which has been carefully wrapped up since its delivery and preserved in a dry place, I fear the following notes on the pictures therein will not be thought very satisfactory for the permanence of photographic works in general. We must remember that all the pictures were produced after the report of “Mr. Pollock’s Fading Commitee,” and several of them are by members of that Committee. No doubt, on the occasion of the production of a volume like this, all care was taken by the several contributors that their works should appear to the best advantage; and should you think it worthy of a place in the Journal, the present notice will draw their attention to the subject, and probably some will be enabled to compare their practice then with their present mode of manipulation, and good results may thereby ensue.\n\nA Member of the Photographic Club.\n\nThe Photographic Album.

The drawing upon stone of the whole collection was entrusted to the care of Mr. Francis Bedford, who, with his able assistants, Messrs. H. Fielding, W. R. Tymms, A. Warren, and S. Sedgfield, with occasional help, have executed the One Hundred Plates in less than one year. My special thanks are due to Mr. Bedford for the care and anxiety which he has evinced, quite regardless of all personal consideration, to render this work as perfect as the advanced state of chromolithography demanded; and I feel persuaded that his valuable services will be fully recognised by all in any way acquainted with the difficulties and uncertainties of this process. Messrs. Day and Son, the enterprising publishers, and at the same time the printers of the work, have put forth all their strength; and notwithstanding the care required, and the vast amount of printing to be performed, the resources of their establishment have enabled them, not only to deliver the work with perfect regularity to the Subscribers, but even to complete it before the appointed time.

Bedford was not in the first publication.) “A folio volume of fifty photographs by fifty different hands, and those of eminence, to which Mr. Whittingham, of Chiswick, has attached fifty pages of letterpress of corresponding beauty. The volume is a present to her Majesty, and is one of fifty-two copies of a series of photographs made by members of the Photographic Club—a newly-established club akin to the old Etching Club, and instituted to advance and record the progress of the art of photography. This is their first volume, [Not true.] and most wonderfully does it exhibit the progress which photography has made in England during the past year. Each of the fifty members sends fifty-two impressions of what he considers to be his best photograph with a description of the process used in obtaining it. Fifty copies are distributed among the fifty; the fifty-first is offered to her Majesty, and the fifty-second presented to the British Museum. Very wonderful, indeed, are some of the photographs in this very beautiful volume. We would especially point out as perfect in their truth to nature and adherence to art Mr. Batson’s “Babblecombe Bay,” Mr. Henry Taylor’s “Lane Scene,” Mr. Llewellyn’s “Angler,” Mr. Bedford’s “Flowers,” Mr. Delamotte’s “Innocence,” Dr. Diamond’s “Interior of Holyrood,” Mr. Henry Pollock’s “Winsor Castle,” Mr. Mackinlay’s “Bedlham Castle,” Mr. White’s “Garden Chair,” and Mr. John Stewart’s appropriate vignette to the volume—the portrait of Sir John Herschel.”]\n\n1 color illus.
