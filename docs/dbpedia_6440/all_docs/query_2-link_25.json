        "text": "One way to look at the early development of films is to look at the progression of the length of films presented. However, there are many oddities and problems such as film speed. There was no set rate of frames per second so time would vary greatly depending upon the exhibitor. This is why early silent film was measured in linear measurements instead of time. To help calculate, 1000 ft would be about 15-17 minutes. Here's a chart of progression with each a commercial film that took the record for length at that time:\n\nLength\n\nFilm\n\nDate\n\n80 ft Soldier's Courtship May 1896 150 ft Death of Nelson Oct. 1897 210 ft Sloper's Visit to Brighton July 1898 320 ft Our New General Servant Aug 1898 620 ft Marley's Ghost Nov 1901 800 ft Alice in Wonderland May 1903 820 ft Incidents in Life of Lord Nelson Oct. 1905 870 ft Life of Charles Peace Nov 1905 1000 ft Dick Turpin's Ride to York May 1906 1200 ft Cinderella Dec 1907 1240 ft Romeo and Juliet June 1908 1280 ft Sexton Blake Oct. 1909 1630 ft Martyrdom of Adolf Beck Dec 1909 2000 ft Henry VIII Feb 1911 2500 ft Rob Roy Sept 1911 3700 ft Oliver Twist* Sept 1912 4300 ft Lorna Doone Dec 1912 6200 ft East Lynne May 1913 7500 ft David Copperfield Aug 1913 9170 ft the Christian Nov 1915\n\n*Oliver Twist was the first feature film in the UK to go over an hour. This was a Hepworth Production of 4 reels starring ex-beauty queen Ivy Millais as Oliver Twist and John McMahon as Fagin. It was released 2 months after Vitagraphs version in the US."
