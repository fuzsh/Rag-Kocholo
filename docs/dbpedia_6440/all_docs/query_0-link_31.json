        "text": "Anne of Green Gables for a Happy Mother's Day\n\nRecently I have been enjoying reading Anne of the Island on my e-reader (I got the Kobo Glow as it lets me read in the middle of the night without turning the light on...genius!!). I adored these books when I was a girl and although I reread Anne of Green Gables a few years ago, I hadn't reread any of the sequels. Imagine my delight when I found I could get some of them free for my Kobo! L.M. Montgomery's entire library is available at www.gutenberg.org but I haven't figured out how to get them from the epub file to my Kobo. Anyone?\n\nAnyway, this week on an evening when I was thoroughly disgusted with the offerings on television and in need of some soul soothing after a long day, I remembered that I hadn't watched the sequels to Anne of Green Gables when I ordered the huge boxed set of DVDs about 2 years ago (I just watched the wonderful original at the time). What is it that makes me buy a DVD and then put it away for a year or two? On the upside, it's like treasure hunting sometimes when I hunt through my DVD collection!\n\nI think maybe I thought that Anne of Green Gables: The Sequel would be a let down. Well, I am enjoying it immensely! They did mess with the story a bit and I truly lament the fact that there is no Patty's Place in this version but it is so well done otherwise and Megan Follows truly is our Canadian Anne of Prince Edward Island! We love her here in Canada and I think she has captured the hearts of viewers world wide (there is quite an Anne following in Japan!)\n\nWell, this post (along with reading the books again and watching the films) have been my mother's day treat to myself. In closing I would like to put forth the idea that perhaps the time has come to film Anne again for another generation. What do you think my dear readers? I love the version from the 1980s but the scenery of PEI is so gorgeous and film making has gotten better over the last few decades. Do you think we could find two actors who could play Anne and Gilbert as well as Megan Follows and Jonathan Crombie?\n\nHappy Mother's Day to you all whether you are a mother or have ever had a mother!\n\nP.S. I believe the let down is the third installment of the Anne films called Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story from 2000. It was an entirely fabricated story and is not as beloved as the first two. I'll still watch it anyway!\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nGatsby IS Great! (well, in my opinion anyway!)\n\nJust ignore the critics. Go and enjoy the spectacle that is The Great Gatsby. It was a pleasant surprise, after reading some fairly critical reviews.\n\nThe costumes were breathtaking. I mean truly breathtaking. Along with the sets. I particularly liked the way they dressed the little house next door to Gatsby's mansion where Nick Carraway lived. Arts and Crafts decor done to perfection. Makes me want to see it again.\n\nThe acting was pretty fab too. Leo DiCaprio does have a knack for this, truly. And Tobey Maguire should be recognized for his amazing take on Gatsby's only friend, in the end. Carey Mulligan is being criticized for being too...too...vapid? But that is who Daisy Buchanan is, right? In any case she is just gorgeous to look at and that is what attracts Gatsby anyway. It certainly wasn't her scintillating conversation!\n\nThe music was wonderful (Thanks to Jay Z and friends). And although it doesn't have an uplifting ending to the story, I didn't feel depressed coming out of this one like I did with Anna Karenina. Actually it was a pretty exhilarating experience. Much better than reading the book in high school. And now I want to read the book again. That is the best compliment you can give a film adaptation of a novel methinks.\n\nWell, let me know how you like it. There were some twenty somethings dressed in flapper/gangster garb waiting for the next show when I saw it. Fun! And just so you know, both Leo and Tobey really rocked those old black tank style bathing suits. Yup, I am seeing this one again soon.\n\n↧\n\nIron Jawed Angels- American Suffragettes\n\nEvery woman in the world should see Iron Jawed Angels. Heck, every man in the world should see this fabulous film, while sitting beside the women in their lives. Although this is the story of women in the United States of America fighting for their right to vote in the early years of the 20th Century there is a lesson for all of us in 2013 and beyond. We are ALL equal in this world. No matter your sex, your colour, your religion or sexuality. We are ALL equal. Full stop.\n\nYou will also never skip voting again, even in a minor municipal election EVER, EVER, again if you see this film. When you see how hard these women worked a century ago to win the right for us to vote, you will never squander that chance again. You will walk through the rain, in the dark for an hour to get to the polling station if you have to.\n\nBut beyond the amazing and empowering message, this is an awesome flick!!!! Hilary Swank plays Alice Paul, an American Quaker who traveled to England to attend the University of Birmingham and brought back the more militant ideas of the Pankhurst women but without the violence. She was a Quaker after all!\n\nFrances O'Connor plays Lucy Burns (Alma Mater- Columbia, Vassar, Yale and Oxford) who met Alice Paul in a London police station after they had both been arrested for demonstrating alongside the British Suffragettes. They bonded immediately and decided to continue their fight for women's voting rights back in America in 1912.\n\nAlice Paul and Lucy Burns start off working within the National American Women Suffrage Association (NAWSA) headed by Carrie Chapman Catt, played by Anjelica Huston. By 1916 they broke away and formed their own political party the National Women's Party (NWP) and organized a daily picket outside the White House during Woodrow Wilson's presidency.\n\nA real Iron Jawed Angel demonstrating against President Wilson\n\nThey ran into trouble after the US joined WWI in 1917 and picketing a wartime president was considered by some to be treasonous, however the women were breaking no laws. They were arrested instead on charges of \"obstructing traffic\".\n\nThe real Lucy Burns incarcerated in Occoquan Workhouse\n\nWhile incarcerated at Occoquan Workhouse in Virginia, the women asked to be treated as political prisoners and went on hunger strikes in protest. I had previously read about the force feeding of women hunger striking suffragettes in England but when you see it on film it is horrific. Again, you will never take your right to vote lightly after seeing this film.\n\nBut this is not a downer movie. It has a rockin' modern musical score and sometimes feels more like a music video than a period drama. And this works to it's advantage. It could easily be shown in high schools to both boys and girls who will be riveted by the great story. German director Katja von Garnier (who is a dead ringer for Kate Middleton) did a fab job with this film. And the supporting cast of Julia Ormond, Laura Fraser (the blacksmith from Knight's Tale), Vera Farmiga and Patrick Dempsey are a few other good reasons to see it.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Run, don't walk to see Iron Jawed Angels right now.\n\nBy the way, the best comment ever posted on my blog was left by Bridget on my post Suffragettes in Film- \"Deeds, not words!\" Bridget says it way better than I ever could!\n\nCheers!\n\n↧\n\nShopping, Seduction & Mr Selfridge- The Book is Better than the Miniseries!\n\nSometimes the book is better, sometimes the film adaptation is better and sometimes they are both great. This time, for \"Mr. Selfridge\" vs \"Shopping, Seduction & Mr Selfridge\" the book has the slight edge in my opinion. It is not a novel, but a non-fiction account of the evolution of shopping on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nThe story of Harry Gordon Selfridge is a true American rags to riches and back to rags story of which few of us were previously aware. I have been to the Selfridges store which transformed the \"wrong end of Oxford Street\" when my family visited London just after the bombings in July 2005. I just thought Selfridges was a very nice department store in 2005, and a welcome reprieve from a summer downpour. I should have looked around a bit more instead of just shopping. Although I did get some lovely lingerie there! Thanks Harry! :)\n\nAlthough Harry himself is interesting, it is the history of modern shopping and fashion which have really caught my imagination. Mr. Selfridge started out with Marshall Fields in Chicago, and anyone with an interest in the history of Chicago would also find this fascinating. I could have used more pretty pictures of the merchandise. Oh, those gorgeous Victorian and Edwardian dresses!\n\nI was fascinated to hear that there was a outdoor rooftop terrace where they held fashion shows and demonstrations of all kinds. And of course those fabulous window displays live on...\n\nYes, that is a gingerbread version of Selfridges with corgis in Santa hats on top and Pearly Kings on each side! Even though Selfridges has been owned by Canadian food retailer Galen Weston for a decade now, it seems to have retained it's modern British feel. It certainly isn't anything like Harrods in any case!\n\nSo even if you, like many, were left underwhelmed by the miniseries, the book is worth a look.\n\n↧\n\nCall the Midwife: The book is just as good as the series!\n\nThe miniseries' of Call the Midwife (both seasons) are great and the book Call the Midwife, A Memoir of Birth, Joy and Hard Times is just as brilliant. If you loved the BBC miniseries which just finished airing on PBS in North America, getting the book is a no brainer. And this is one you may want to pass on to a friend, so I was glad my family bought me the paperback for Mother's Day as I have already passed it on to my sister.\n\nYou will recognize all of the main characters. Trixie is given short shrift in this book but the story of Chummy conquering the bicycle with the help of her little friend is there and the story of Jenny's affair with a married man and her friendship with Jimmy is there. Miranda Hart makes the role of Chummy even better than it's written! Cynthia apparently had a really sexy, low voice in real life, so perhaps that casting didn't quite come through but I love Bryony Hannah in the role as she is just so adorable!\n\nThe casting of all of the nuns as well as Jenny Lee is perfection. As you read the book, it just fleshes out the already beloved characters from the series. Sister Evangelina, Sister Monica Joan and Sister Julienne are well represented in this book. Perhaps we will read more of cutie Sister Bernadette in some of the other books by Jennifer Worth which I have yet to read. Apparently there are four of them. Yay!!!\n\nSo if you are looking for some reading material while you wait for the third season (and we are talking next spring for that here in the colonies) you can't go wrong. And you will love the story of the Spanish mother with 28 children (OK, I can't remember the real number and my sis now has the book).\n\nCheers and happy reading!\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nRemains of the Day, Where Angels Fear to Tread, and other stuff\n\nRemains of the Day is one of those films I thought I had seen, but I think I had only seen snippets of it on television. It's much better when you see the beginning and the end of it!\n\nBased on the 1989 novel by Kazuo Ishiguro who is a Japanese born but English raised author, this Merchant Ivory film ends up being a fascinating look at English sensibility through the eyes of an outsider. Nuanced and yet intense it is a very riveting film, but I can't say it is one of my faves.\n\nFabulous performances from Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson along with some pretty gorgeous period locations certainly make this one stand out. Great supporting performances from Hugh Grant, Christopher Reeve, Tim Piggott-Smith and James Fox are absolutely worth mentioning.\n\nThe only question remains, why did it take me so long to see this film?\n\nWhere Angels Fear to Tread was one I had never heard of. I am afraid my science background didn't give me a good grounding in E.M. Forster. I certainly knew about A Room with a View, Howard's End and A Passage to India, but this, his first novel, was not on my radar.\n\nAgain, with a cast that includes Helen Mirren, Helena Bonham-Carter, Judy Davis and Rupert Graves it is certainly worth watching. And again, the setting of Italy a century ago (and the gorgeous Italian actor Giovanni Guidelli) makes it a pleasure to watch.\n\nAnd yet again, this one is down in my book as well worth seeing, but not one of my faves. I think my faves all have happy endings, so perhaps this reflects more on me, than on these films.\n\nSweet Revenge is a silly little farce, adapted from an Alan Ayckbourn play called The Revengers' Comedies. If you like dark comedies and tongue in cheek farce then this is for you. If you don't like the idea of the two main characters plotting revenge on each others' nemeses, not stopping far short of murder (played for laughs the whole way) then give this one a pass.\n\nPersonally, this one gave me more than a few belly laughs. I was in the mood for something silly and this hit the spot. By the way, keep IMDb handy for this film as every single one of the actors save one was well known to me from other British gems. Helena Bonham Carter, Kristin Scott Thomas and Sam Neill are only the beginning of the star studded cast.\n\nSpeaking of silly comedies, Family Tree is one of the oddest and most hilarious things I have seen on TV in a while. A Christopher Guest mockumentary, it follows in the footsteps of This is Spinal Tap and Best in Show but this time he takes on genealogy, an unlikely target for comedy. Apparently the idea came from Guest himself tracing his ancestors and thinking there may be some fodder for laughs. And it works.\n\nIt is a bit twisted and bear in mind that it airs on HBO, so not appropriate for children or sensitive types. But again, if you are in the mood for some quirky British comedy starring adorable Irish actor Chris O'Dowd this is your show. I am looking forward to a new episode tonight. The sister's ventriloquist dummy monkey really cracks me up. Try to see the first show if you can, as it really explains the crazy story line. You might be lost otherwise.\n\nCheers and happy viewing!\n\n↧\n\nIMDb - Fun, informative and kinda addictive!\n\nThe Internet Movie Database\n\nIMDb. I can't believe there are people out there who don't know about it. Whether you are a movie lover looking for a review or information on a film or just a middle aged person wracking your brains for the name of some movie star (\"You know...the actress with the big mouth...she was in that film from the 80s...the one about the high class prostitute...Julia Roberts!\") this website is the go to spot for movies and TV.\n\nMy son loses hours on YouTube. I lose hours on IMDb. I blame my sister for this, as she introduced me to the site! Launched in 1990 and bought by the evil Amazon (who suck money out of my pockets monthly!) in 1998, it is supposedly accessed by 44 million registered users, and many more unregistered ones.\n\nSo let me demonstrate how I lose these hours! Take a recently viewed film, the adaptation of EM Forster's Where Angels Fear to Tread, which of course I had purchased a while ago from said evil Amazon corporation (probably one of those \"suggestions\" which always seem to be spot on. I am not hard to read).\n\nI go to IMDb to find out when it was made (1991), how well it was rated (6.6- not so bad for an obscure period drama) and the names of all the actors.\n\nRupert Graves. Ooooh, I love him. What else has he been in? Click on his name. Hmmmm. Lots of stuff there for him to be my next Actor of the Week!\n\nA Room With a View- Freddy Honeychurch\n\nThe Madness of King George- Robert Fulke Greville\n\nThe Tenant of Wildfell Hall- Huntingdon\n\nSweet Revenge (The Revenger's Comedies)- Oliver Knightly\n\nThe Forsyte Saga- Jolyon Forsyte Jr.\n\nDeath at a Funeral- Robert\n\nMade in Dagenham- Peter Hopkins\n\nGarrow's Law- Sir Arthur Hill\n\nSherlock- DI Lestrade\n\nThe White Queen as Lord Thomas Stanley...this is new...just filming?...what is this about? CLICK!\n\nTagline \"Women caught up in the conflict for the throne of England\". Well, that grabs my interest. A BBC television series? Who else does it star? Rebecca Ferguson as Queen Elizabeth? Never heard of her but she is very pretty. Swedish. Hmm. Her mother Rosemary is related to Sarah Ferguson? Mildly interesting.\n\nWho else? Amanda Hale...she sounds familiar. Oh yes, Mary Musgrove from the latest Persuasion adaptation with Sally Hawkins and Rupert Penry-Jones.\n\nWho else? Backclick, backclick...Janet McTeer! I love her too! She was so awesome as Mrs. Dashwood in Sense and Sensibility 2008, but I have seen her somewhere else recently.\n\nOh yes, she was Mrs. Satterthwaite in Parade's End, and Mrs. Daily in The Woman in Black and Hubert Page in Albert Nobbs. She has been busy lately! Oh, she also played Vita Sackville-West in Portrait of a Marriage. May have to check that one out. And she was in Into the Storm, playing the wife of Winston Churchill played by Brendan Gleeson.\n\nSo you see, a whole day can be spent in this manner. I hesitate to say wasted, as I always enjoy myself and usually find another topic for my blog. Look out for my next two Actors of the Week!\n\nSo that's my tribute to IMDb. I had better turn the computer off now before I fall down the rabbit hole again and disappear for hours.\n\nCheers!\n\n↧\n\nStratford Festival, Ontario, Canada\n\nI live in Ontario, Canada and the Stratford Festival is an amazing gift for we theatre lovers. It has also carved out a wonderful artistic community in Stratford (on the Avon river, no less) which used to be just a small farming and manufacturing centre.\n\nWe now have fabulous restaurants, adorable Victorian B&Bs, and some of the best shopping you will find anywhere. And of course, from late spring to the fall, we have world class actors in some of the best plays both Shakespearean and more modern.\n\nThis season seems to be a particularly wonderful one, so if you have the chance to come and check it out, I don't think you will be disappointed. This weekend was the Michigan Member's Weekend and there are also events through the season for Members from Chicago, NY and Ohio.\n\nOf course, this is on my mind right now as I just saw Shakespeare's Measure for Measure yesterday. It was fabulous by the way. It is put on in one of the smallest of the venues, the Tom Patterson Theatre which is actually the winter home of the Stratford Badminton Club and only holds about 500 seats around the thrust stage.\n\nIt sounds strange but it is a wonderfully intimate experience and we were in the first row, so we almost felt like we were inside the play! The other two theatres, the Festival Theatre and the Avon Theatre are of course much bigger and house the more popular of the plays and musicals.\n\nI like to study up a bit on the plays I see at Stratford, as I find as an adult who studied science and not literature in University, I need a bit of background for some of the lesser known plays. My husband was doing the same (dueling laptops on the deck) and he was laughing his head off at the analysis of Measure for Measure on shmoop, which I had never heard of. I wish shmoop existed when I was a high school student. Heck, I wish the internet existed when I was a high school student. Anyway, it's a fun and informative place to bone up on a play beforehand.\n\nAnd as good as Measure for Measure was, the next one I am going to see with my girlfriends in July is supposed to be even better. Mary Stuart, an adaptation of Friedrich Schiller's play from 1800 has been getting fabulous reviews. I don't have to study as hard for this one, but a bit of Wikipedia cramming so I know my Dudleys from my Darnleys is probably in order. And I get to have a lovely lunch with my friends beforehand.\n\nSo although no film review this week, at least you know what I am up to this summer!\n\nCheers!\n\nP.S. On my last trip to NYC, our waitress one night was a struggling actress who travels from NYC to Stratford every summer to take in as many plays as she can cram in over a few days. We gave her an extra good tip that night!\n\n↧\n\nSecrets of Hampton Court, Althorp and Chatsworth on PBS\n\nSecrets of Henry VIII's Palace, (specifically Hampton Court Palace) begins the \"Secrets Of\" series this Sunday June 30th at 8pm on PBS. You will be well entertained by the fascinating stories of this amazing structure whether you have never heard of it before, or you have been lucky enough to see it in person.\n\nIn Tudor times, Hampton Court used to be in the country, and although it doesn't come across in the show, the front Tudor/Henry VIII part of the palace faces a busy London road while the back William & Mary/Dutch style later part of the palace backs out onto a gorgeous countryside, with nary a building in sight.\n\nIt is almost as if you have stepped through a portal in a time travel film and been transported to another era. The fact that it is only a 35 minute train ride from Waterloo station in central London makes it even more amazing. If you ever get to London, you'll want to fit this in. But in the meantime, spend an hour with PBS. They did a great job of bringing the history to life!\n\nAnd remember:\n\nDivorced, beheaded and died\n\nDivorced, beheaded, survived\n\nI'm Henry the Eighth, I had six sorry wives\n\nSome might say I ruined their lives.\n\n*********************************************************************************\n\nNow I have to be honest, I have never been a fan of Princess Diana's brother Charles, now the 9th Earl Spencer. He does, however, own a truly awesome house, Althorp.\n\nI have never been to Althorp, possibly because the whole burying Diana on the island thing rather turned me off. But I am curious enough about the estate and it's history to watch Secrets of Althorp on Sunday July 7. I haven't had a chance to preview this episode, but if it is as good as the first one, it will be well worth watching.\n\n**********************************************************************************\n\nNow if you get me talking about Chatsworth, the seat of the Duke of Devonshire, this will be a very long post. Suffice it to say that this was included in my Pride and Prejudice tour of the North of England on which I dragged The Squire (my long suffering hubby).\n\nDoes this photo evoke Pride and Prejudice 2005 for you? It sure does for me. And they kept the Darcy sculpture, although they put it in a different part of the house!\n\nIf you saw the film The Duchess you will have already seen much of Chatsworth and part of it's rich history will be known to you. But as fascinating as Georgiana's story was (and by the way, she was a Spencer and started her life at Althorp), that is only a small part of the saga of Chatsworth.\n\nSo you'll have to watch the final episode, Secrets of Chatsworth on Sunday July 14th to find out the rest of the story. I'll be glued to the tube that night too. I love Chatsworth. I mean, just look at that view of Derbyshire!!!\n\nCheers!\n\nUpdate: Check local listings as apparently PBS is not showing it on all of it's affiliate stations. I hate it when they do that, but the Hampton Court episode is available online and the others will be available after the air date for US viewers: http://video.pbs.org/video/2365033713\n\nI have been able to watch all of them now. If you are a Diana fan you will like the Althorp episode, but her brother really does creep me out. (And he thought the show was all about him, not the house!) However, the Chatsworth one was wonderful and I learned a few things I didn't know which made me want to go back to Chatsworth again. Derbyshire really is a wonderful county, if you know what I mean! ;)\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nTime Team- An Archaeological Gem loses a member and comes to an end!\n\nTime Team is one of my favourite British shows ever. Described by Channel 4 as \"Tony Robinson and a team of experts travel the country to investigate a wide range of archaeological sites of historical importance\", this is the kind of reality show I really love. Not a lecture but a real archaeological experience.\n\nEven if you think you have no interest in archaeology, you will love seeing the kind of things which can be dug up in the fields and backyards of England by this quirky group of Brits.\n\nTony Robinson is the host, and you may know him as I did from the Blackadder series. Baldrick he is not in this show, but he is a friendly interpreter of the science behind each episode's 3 day long dig.\n\nMick Aston, who sadly just died a few weeks ago, was partly responsible for the creation of Time Team after telling series producer Tim Taylor that it would be possible to evaluate a site in only 3 days. He loved all things medieval and monastic and was passionate about communicating archaeology to the public. We will miss this sweet man with his colourful sweaters and his flyaway hair, but most of all his down to earth demeanor and love of digging in the dirt!\n\nPhil Harding, with his pirate like West Country accent (Arrr mateys) and his Indiana Jones hat adds a bit of spice to every show. He can be cantankerous, especially if Tony is giving him a hard time about his current trench and it's lack of artifacts, but he is always up for a laugh. He loves to do recreations of the history of the site being dug, especially if it involves his fave era, prehistory.\n\nHelen Geake is always a ray of sunshine with her rosy cheeks and her lovely smile. She is an expert on Anglo Saxons and small finds and she loves to sift through historical records to find documents relevant to the dig.\n\nJohn Gater is the geophys expert on Time Team. \"What is geophys?\" I hear you ask. The geophysics team has to survey the site before any digging begins to see where potential walls or buildings might be found. And he often gets flak from Tony about leading them on a merry chase, however most times the geophys is impressively accurate!\n\nAs the Time Team \"Landscape Investigator\", Stewart Ainsworth looks at aerial photos and generally marches around a site to see if any clues about the area can be found by just merely \"looking\". He is a quiet, gentle soul who often brings a lot of information about the dig from his observations.\n\nSo if you find it interesting that people in Britain can dig up Roman coins and medieval pottery in their own backyard, you may want to check this out.\n\nIn Canada you can find episodes on the TVO website http://ww3.tvo.org/program/166030/time-team (I loooove TVO, our public broadcaster) and in the UK they are on the BBC4 website http://www.channel4.com/programmes/time-team.\n\nThe rest of you will have to catch episodes on YouTube. Here is a great place to start, 20 years of Time Team: http://youtu.be/1FP9TAErBFw\n\n↧\n\nThe Mayor of Casterbridge 2003\n\nOh, Thomas Hardy...why so tragic? I have had my copy of The Mayor of Casterbridge kicking around my house for about a year now, still with the wrapping on it. I know that Thomas Hardy is a wonderful writer but he can be such a downer that it took until this week for me to get this one into the DVD player. Why did I wait???? It is wonderful!\n\nI should have known with Ciaran Hinds in the title role that it would be good. But this one is really good! Now, don't get me wrong, it is Thomas Hardy and the subtitle of the book is \"The Life and Death of a Man of Character\" so don't you be expectin' any happy endings. I mean it starts with the main character Michael Henchard selling his wife and baby daughter to a sailor at a country fair after he has had too much to drink.\n\nThen we pick up the story 18 years later, when Henchard has made good and is a respectable grain merchant and Mayor when his wife Susan shows up in Casterbridge as a widow with a grown daughter. And then the story gets complex and really dark as it always does with Hardy.\n\nI have to say, if I knew James Purefoy had such a prominent role in this I would have cracked open the DVD much sooner. My goodness, that man looks good in Victorian clothing! And he does a fairly good Scottish accent as Donald Farfrae, the man who unwittingly complicates Henchard's life over and over again.\n\nMmmmmmmm....sorry, I got lost in those dreamy eyes and adorable smirk in the photo above.\n\nBut seriously all of the actors in this are top notch, from Jodhi May as Elizabeth-Jane, Henchard's daughter right on down to the wonderful Jean Marsh in a small but pivotal role as the Furmity Woman who gets Henchard intoxicated at the fair. You know a production is fabulous when even the tiny roles are perfectly cast. And Polly Walker is captivatingly gorgeous as usual as Lucetta, the love interest of both men.\n\nI think what I liked most about this story is how Thomas Hardy humanizes his characters and doesn't try to make them all good or all evil, which is a refreshing change for Victorian literature. Everyone has depth, even if there seems to be just a little too much coincidental tragedy for my liking.\n\nSo, there you are. By all means this has my two thumbs up but make sure you are in a good mood when you decide to watch it. It is quite a roller coaster ride. And of course it makes you want to read the book. I think this will be cottage reading for me this summer!\n\nCheers!\n\n↧\n\nBorn to Royalty BBC Film\n\nOK, I am not the only one who is unreasonably excited about the impending birth of William and Catherine's royal baby, am I? Then I am also not the only one who will be seeing (OK, perhaps ordering) the new BBC film Born to Royalty on how to raise a British Royal Baby.\n\nNarrated by Downton Abbey's Hugh Bonneville, it opens in select theatres on July 19th and is released on DVD August 6th it is timed to coincide with the blessed event that the British tabloids have been waiting so patiently for.\n\nAnd while we wait, here is a little tidbit for you. The new royal baby will not have to have a surname, as HRH Prince or Princess and about 4 or more given names is all that is required. However, both William and Harry have taken Wales as their surname so the new royal baby will likely have the surname of either Mountbatten-Windsor, Wales or Cambridge. I am betting on the latter.\n\nBets for baby names have Charlotte, Alexandra, Elizabeth, Diana, George, James, Phillip and Arthur in the running. Please leave a comment below with your baby name suggestions. I like Victoria for a girl personally, although Sophia or Caroline would be nice! How about Frederick or Ernest for a boy?\n\nSo if you, like me, got up early to watch the wedding of William and Catherine (heck, I watched the Chuck and Diana nuptials live) you will likely be interested in this Royal Baby film. The trailer can be viewed here and the link to purchase the DVD on Amazon is here.\n\nAnd don't forget the last of the \"Secrets of\" series on PBS at 8pm tonight, Secrets of Chatsworth.\n\n↧\n\nUnfinished Song\n\nUnfinished Song (Song for Marion) is one of those quintessentially British Dramedies. It will have you laughing and it will have you crying, but most of all it will leave you smiling.\n\nVanessa Redgrave is Marion who is dying of cancer (I told you that you would be crying). Terence Stamp is her chronically grumpy husband and they live in one of those unlovable towns in the North of England, which we have grown to love. Yes, there is a predictable quality to this film, but the fantastic acting makes it predictably wonderful.\n\nFormer Bond girl Gemma Arterton (who was also in the wonderful Tamara Drewe) plays the director of a choir for old age pensioners, the OAPz (it's more street with the z). As Marion gets sicker she has problems making the rehearsals for their entry in a choir competition...and her grumpy husband gets pulled into the group.\n\nIf you don't like a slightly sappy film then skip this one. I loved it. When Vanessa Redgrave sang True Colours...well I dare you not to tear up. And of course we get to hear Terence Stamp sing at the end, which is wonderful. Go Grandpa!\n\nI think the only odd part about this film is the animosity between Terence Stamp and the son (Dr. Who's Christopher Eccleston), the only offspring of this unlikely duo. He looks like a thug, but he turns out to be a real sweetie, and the script never really gives us an explanation of why father and son can't stay on speaking terms. It is almost as if a few key scenes were left on the cutting room floor.\n\nBut it is still a great film and well worth seeing. It should be out on DVD soon, as it was in our art house theatre in July, but I have been on holidays and just finally got around to finishing this post.\n\nCheers!\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nMansfield Park 2007 vs 1999\n\nOh, dear, the matter of a Mansfield Park film. Her most controversial novel has been, unsurprisingly, the most difficult to film. In both the 1999 and 2007 film adaptations (112 minutes and 120 minutes respectively) the shy, sensitive and highly moral Fanny Price is changed into...well...not Fanny Price, in order to make her more sympathetic to modern viewers.\n\nThe 1999 Mansfield Park by Patricia Rozema openly admits in the opening credits that it is based on the book and on the diaries of Jane Austen. Basically, Patricia Rozema makes the character of Fanny Price into a version of Jane Austen herself, in order to give her the liveliness and spark that so many have found lacking in poor, weak little Fanny. Heck, apparently even Jane Austen's own mother found the Fanny of the novel \"insipid\".\n\nI am fully aware that Jane Austen purists tend to dislike the 1999 film, however it is actually one of my beloved old friends, and tends to get popped into the DVD player on a regular basis. I have no problem with the slightly modern costumes and the feisty, robust Fanny as played by Frances O'Connor. I love the cheeky way that Fanny (both young and older version) looks into the camera to deliver the odd aside. I find the photography breathtaking, the music perfectly wonderful, and most of the main thrusts of the plot are there, even if they have been tinkered with a little bit.\n\nOK, OK, my love of this version may have a teensy weensy bit to do with the fact that a very young Jonny Lee Miller plays Edmund Bertram (albeit with unnaturally red lips, but I won't hold that against him). I mean, look at that face! It's no wonder Fanny fell for him, am I right?\n\nVictoria Hamilton and Justine Waddell are truly wonderful as Maria and Julia - the wicked, selfish cousins who delight in making Fanny feel inferior every chance they get.\n\nAnd I tip my hat to Hugh Bonneville who captured the idiotic Mr. Rushworth perfectly. And the hair...oh the hair! Teeheeheehee!\n\nAlessandro Nivola made the character of Henry Crawford quite appealing and really helped us feel that Fanny almost got swept away by his very effective courting. Oh, the fireworks and the doves and the flowers! And he seemed so earnest (almost). But Fanny listened to her heart. Good girl, you held out for Jonny- I mean the virtuous vicar Edmund!\n\nThe rest of the cast is pretty darn good too, from Lindsay Duncan as both Mrs. Price and Lady Bertram to James Purefoy who is easy on the eyes as Tom Bertram. Sheila Gish is almost as good a Mrs. Norris as the cat in Harry Potter (I love J.K. Rowling for that little gem)!\n\nHowever, I can't be the only one creeped out by Harold Pinter's lecherous Sir Thomas Bertram. Ewwwwww! Great acting but a really creepy take on Sir Thomas.\n\nAnd now we move on to the 2007 Mansfield Park. I am a pretty easy audience when it comes to Jane Austen adaptations but I found this one particularly difficult to love. I think it mostly has to do with the casting of Billie Piper as Fanny Price. Buxom, bleached blonde (with dark brows), she seems to be all teeth and unkempt hair. And they made the young Fanny a bleached blonde with dark brows too!!! Again, she is not the timid, sickly and saintly Fanny of the novel as she tears around the house grinning maniacally. But that would be the fault of the script. I suppose Billie Piper is a good actress, she just didn't make me care for her Fanny.\n\nNow, apart from the casting of the main character, let's begin with the good points of this adaptation. There is some fabulous acting, starting with a very heartfelt performance from Blake Ritson as Edmund (OK, apart from the delivery of the line \"I have always loved...this room!\"- groan).\n\nThe performance of Hayley Atwell as Mary Crawford was really very good. I always love Hayley Atwell in whatever she is in, and she delivered again here. Unfortunately Joseph Beattie was a bit dull as Henry Crawford. He just didn't do it for me after the brilliant sex appeal of Alessandro Nivola's Henry Crawford. Sorry!\n\nJames D'Arcy was very good in the role of the heir to Mansfield Park, Tom Bertram. He is a great actor, but I believe James Purefoy has the edge in a Tom Bertram smackdown. However as for the actors who played Maria and Julia Bertram and Mr. Rushworth, I cannot even be bothered to look up their names. Enough said.\n\nI do have to give a shout out to Joseph Morgan the actor who plays Fanny's elder brother William Price. I really missed his character in the 1999 version and he is everything I pictured him to be. Adorable, actually, even though they made him dance the hornpipe on the lawn of Mansfield Park. Actually there was altogether too much outdoor dancing in this adaptation. I can't help but think that it was cheaper to film out of doors. Pity!\n\nMrs. Norris as played by Maggie O'Neill was just OK. But I really kind of liked Jemma Redgrave's take on Lady Bertram. Lindsay Duncan's drug addled Lady Bertram in 1999 was a bit too indolent (her pathetic and slatternly Mrs. Price was much better). Although it was a departure from the novel, Jemma Redgrave gave Lady Bertram a sweetness and prescience that was refreshing, although not perhaps what the author intended. It may be my affection for Jemma Redgrave as Bramwell which is disposing me kindly to her acting here.\n\nI liked Douglas Hodge's version of Sir Thomas. He is a bit bombastic and mean to poor Fanny, although I suppose that is the character as written. I will say that I liked Douglas Hodge better in both The Way We Live Now and Middlemarch, but that is probably partly due to the script here. I mean, leaving Fanny on her own to skip around the Great House (instead of sending her back to Portsmouth) is hardly a punishment for refusing Henry Crawford. It was rather a treat for her to be away from all those who normally mistreated or took her for granted.\n\nHey, I just realized that there is a haha in the photo above! (LOL or hahahaha!)\n\nAnyway, I guess this version is OK. Meh! But we still need a really good film adaptation (preferably miniseries in length) of Mansfield Park. Or is this book truly unfilmable? I don't think it is. All it needs is the right screenplay (come on Andrew Davies or Sandy Welch) and some money and good direction and casting behind it.\n\nBut the real question is can they leave the character of Fanny Price as it was written by Jane Austen or does she need to be livened up a bit for the modern audience? Please discuss in the comments below. I look forward to your views!\n\nCheers!\n\n↧\n\nA Fish Called Wanda 1988\n\nA tale of murder, lust, greed, revenge and seafood!\n\nI understand that a comedy set in 1988 is not a period drama, but this is my blog and A Fish Called Wanda is one of my fave films of all time. Yes, it has lots of swearing and raunchiness in it, but it is all there for comedic effect. And I would much rather see this film than the crappy violence in the theatres these days. In fact, we watched this at the cottage with our adult sons and their girlfriends a few weeks ago. And boy does it ever hold up. Great comedy is great comedy.\n\nArchie: All right, all right, I apologize.\n\nOtto: You're really sorry?\n\nArchie: I'm really really sorry. I apologize unreservedly.\n\nOtto: You take it back?\n\nArchie: I do. I offer a complete and utter retraction. The imputation was totally without basis in fact, and was in no way fair comment, and was motivated purely by malice, and I deeply regret any distress that my comments may have caused you or your family, and I hereby undertake not to repeat any such slander at any time in the future.\n\nOtto:...Okay.\n\nArchie: Wanda, do you have any idea what it's like being English? Being so correct all the time, being so stifled by this dread of, of doing the wrong thing, of saying to someone, 'Are you married?' and hearing, 'My wife left me this morning' or saying, uh, 'Do you have children?' and being told they all burned to death on Wednesday. You see, Wanda, We're all terrified of embarrassment. That's why we're so - dead. Most of my friends are dead, you know; we've these piles of corpses to dinner. But you're alive, God bless you, and I want to be, I'm so fed up with all this. I want to make love with you, Wanda. I'm a good lover - at least, used to be, back in the early 14th century. Can we go to bed?\n\nOtto: Guess I'll have to ask you an easy one, eh, Ken? OK. Um...Let me think, let me think. Um...Where are the diamonds? I'll give you a clue. Somewhere around the airport.\n\nKen: I'm n-n-n...\n\nOtto: No hassle. There's plenty of time. I'll just sit here and eat my chips till you tell me. The English contribution to world cuisine: the chip. What do the English usually eat with chips to make them more interesting? Wait a moment! It's fish. Isn't it? [Dipping into the fish tank with a net] Oh! Here, boy. Down the hatch. [Eats the fish] Delicious!\n\nKen: You b-b-b...\n\nOtto: Better eat the green one? OK. What's this one's name? Well, not Wanda, anyway. I'm going to call her Lunch. Hello, Lunch. Hello! [Eats the fish] Ew! Avoid the green ones - not ripe yet!\n\nOtto: Don't call me stupid.\n\nWanda: Oh, right! To call you stupid would be an insult to stupid people! I've known sheep that could outwit you. I've worn dresses with higher IQs. But you think you're an intellectual, don't you ape?\n\nOtto: Apes don't read philosophy.\n\nWanda: Yes they do, Otto. They just don't understand it. Now let me correct you on a couple of things, OK? Aristotle was not Belgian. The central message of Buddhism is not \"Every man for himself\" and the London Underground is not a political movement. Those are all mistakes, Otto. I looked them up.\n\nKen: Re-venge!\n\nOtto: [Laughing] It's K-K-K-Ken! C-c-c-coming to k-k-k-kill me! How you gonna c-c-c-catch me K-K-K-Ken?\n\nPolitically incorrect? Absolutely. But Ken does get his revenge, doesn't he? If you haven't seen this one in a while, it is well worth seeking out. And don't watch the watered down TV version. This one deserves to be seen uncut and without commercials.\n\nAny other fans out there???\n\nCheers!\n\n↧\n\nLorna Doone 2000\n\nLorna Doone is a 2000 BBC adaptation of the classic Victorian novel by Richard Dodderidge Blackmore. Never heard of it? Neither had I until I stumbled upon this very enjoyable DVD. OK, stumbled upon is not quite right...I had to order a used copy from EBay. It is very hard to get a hold of this DVD, but well worth the search.\n\nFor those who don't know the story, John Ridd (Richard Coyle of Coupling, W.E. and the ginger Mr. Coxe of Wives and Daughters) is the son of a farmer who was murdered by one of the notorious (formerly noble but now outlaw) Doone clan of Exmoor Devon.\n\nHe unwittingly falls desperately in love with the lovely Lorna Doone, kin of his sworn enemies. I won't spoil the rest for you. It's a great romp set during the period when King Charles II dies and there is a scramble for the throne between the Duke of Monmouth and James II, who of course ruled briefly from 1685 to 1688 at which time he was deposed in the Glorious Revolution in favour of William of Orange and Mary. But enough of the history, the film is great! Lorna is played by Amelia Warner who is gorgeous and was seen very briefly as the teen Fanny Price in Mansfield Park 1999.\n\nOther reasons to see this are the fact that the two sisters of John Ridd are played by Joanna Frogatt (Anna Bates of Downton Abbey) and the delightfully named Honeysuckle Weeks (Sam from Foyle's War).\n\nNot only do we know John Ridd's sisters from some fave Period Dramas, but his mother is played by the delightful Barbara Flynn (Wives and Daughters, Cranford and Miss Potter). One actor I didn't recognize was Anthony Calf as the former highwayman Tom Faggus, love interest of Honeysuckle Weeks. He is well disguised and looks nothing like Colonel Fitzwilliam of P&P 1995!\n\nBut of course Michael Kitchen can't be missed as Judge Jeffreys, even in a 17th century wig. That thing must weigh 10 pounds!\n\nAnd then we have the ridiculously young and girlish James McAvoy as the love interest of Joanna Froggatt's character. He is adorable!!!!\n\nAnd even a big wig and mustachio cannot conceal the wonderful Martin Clunes as John's friend-to-the end Jeremy Stickles.\n\nFans of Aiden Gillen (Game of Thrones) will enjoy him as the heir to the evil Doone empire, Carver Doone.\n\nSo find this and see it if you can. It is a wonderful and rather unknown (if star studded) Period Drama. Two teacups way up!!! And yes, Lorna Doone is also the name of a shortbread cookie from Nabisco. Two cookies way up also!\n\nCheers!\n\n↧\n\nThe Sapphires\n\nIrish actor Chris O'Dowd can do no wrong these days. He is hilarious in the mockumentary Family Tree on HBO, and in Australian gem The Sapphires, he will steal your heart.\n\nBased loosely on the real life story of 3 aboriginal girls and their half white cousin in 1960s Australia who formed a girl band and performed for troops in Vietnam, it is like nothing else you have ever seen. And yet, it has that familiar \"feel good movie\" trajectory that I love so well.\n\nShari Sebbens, Miranda Tapsell, Jessica Mauboy and Deborah Mailman as The Sapphires\n\nThe actresses are fabulous Aussie unknowns (hopefully not for long). The frocks are wonderfully evocative of the period, and the Go-Go boots are just fabulous!\n\nThe script was written by Tony Briggs, the son of one of the original singers, although he changed it (in his words, \"we went a bit 'Argo'\") to make the dynamics of the story richer. Actually, he had written a 2004 play by the same name and co-wrote the film script with Keith Thompson. The director Wayne Blair is also an aboriginal who acted in the original play.\n\nThe original Sapphires: Naomi Mayers, Lois Peeler, Laurel Robinson and Beverly Briggs\n\nSo if you need a wonderfully uplifting and inspiring film some evening, with a bit of 1960s soul music and a dash of romance, this is your chick flick. My hubby loved it just as much as I did, and we both enjoyed the DVD extras with interviews with the four lovely ladies above.\n\nCheers!\n\nP.S. If you liked this one, you might also enjoy the 2002 film Whale Rider about a spunky Maori girl in New Zealand.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nFanny Price the introvert; is she unfilmable?\n\nI recently put the question out there on Twitter- Is Fanny Price unfilmable? By which I mean the REAL Fanny Price. In the latest two film adaptations of the novel Mansfield Park from 1999 and 2007 she is made very different from how she reads on the page in order to have the viewer sympathize more readily with the character of Fanny.\n\nIn the former, she gets a good dose of spunky Jane Austen, writing her cheeky, nutty juvenilia and in the latter she just gets a dose of crazy boisterousness.\n\nI had a few people on Twitter and on my MP blog post point out that the 1983 BBC miniseries has a truer take on Fanny's introverted personality than the more recent versions. I am working my way through it on YouTube (link here). The characters of Fanny (Sylvestra Le Touzel) and Maria (Samantha Bond) are fairly well played but Lady Bertram is soooooooo awful, I mean so truly awful that you have to check it out. It is just unbelievable!\n\nSorry if you love this version but although Fanny is more introverted, the entire production is now dated and flawed by today's production standards. It is however worth viewing, if only to see a very young Jonny Lee Miller as Fanny's little brother Charles. His mop of hair is adorable!\n\nBut what is it about Fanny Price which makes her the least lovable of Jane Austen's heroines? Is it her introversion, which masks her massive teenage crush on Edmund and just makes her seem like a cold fish? Or is it the fact that she seems convinced she is always right, which makes her appear judgmental and sanctimonious, when in reality she is constantly doubting herself?\n\nI think that a nice long miniseries adaptation of Mansfield Park (sympathetic to the character and personality of Fanny which Jane Austen intended) is truly called for!\n\nAnd really, don't we introverted readers deserve a character we can relate to? I mean, I love Lizzy and Emma, but if I am honest with myself, I was much closer in disposition to Fanny when I was 18 years old.\n\nThere is also an argument for a longer version of Mansfield Park in that there are so many subplots and minor characters which deserve a truly wonderful film treatment. Both Susan and William Price deserve lots of screen time so that we can see how Fanny relates to her siblings. And the trip to Sotherton? It just has to be in there doesn't it? And Lover's Vows? I don't know about you, but I want to see a few scenes of that in rehearsal!\n\nSo let me know your thoughts on Mansfield Park in general, and Fanny Price in particular. And if anyone reading this has pull with BBC or ITV, please send them here!!!\n\nCheers!\n\n↧\n\nRush 2013\n\nMy husband (affectionately called The Squire in this blog) was excited to see Ron Howard's latest offering Rush so we went to see it for our Saturday night date this week. As a boy he wasn't a huge racing fan, but knew of Niki Lauda and James Hunt and was interested to see something different from the films I usually drag him to!\n\nI had heard good things about this film, as well as occasionally seeing Ron Howard's Twitter pics of filming over the past year or so, and was curious to see it. I really knew nothing about it except the fact that it was about Formula One racing in the 1970s. And that made it even more enjoyable as I had no idea where this story was going as it unfolded.\n\nSo I won't tell you anything about the plot, except that Chris Hemsworth does a great job of playing the hedonistic English driver James Hunt and German/Spanish actor Daniel Brühl does an even better job of playing the cooler more calculating Austrian driver Niki Lauda.\n\nThere are two strong female leads, Olivia Wilde and Alexandra Maria Lara who give us a look at what it was to be involved with these crazy, risk takers. And kudos to Ron Howard for showing us that he really knows how to tell a story.\n\nSo I will leave it there. Go and see this with someone who might like a car film. Trust me, you will really like it. It's not the usual vacuous fare so prevalent in theaters these days. Thanks Ron!\n\nCheers!\n\n↧\n\nThe Paradise on PBS Masterpiece\n\nWell my dear readers, The Paradise is finally here on PBS Masterpiece starting tonight at 9 pm. This BBC offering is an adaptation of Émile Zola's novel Au Bonheur des Dames (The Ladies' Paradise) but moving the early department store to the North of England instead of Paris.\n\nTonight we follow Denise Lovett (played by Joanna Vanderham) as she moves from her small town in the North of England to get a job with her uncle in his draper's shop. He is unable to hire her as he is getting squeezed out by \"The Paradise\", located across the street and one of the first high end department stores in England.\n\nDenise of course gets a job there instead and promptly falls in love with the gorgeous boss, John Moray (played scrumptiously by Emun Elliott). So you see where this is going of course! A bit of back stabbing amongst the shop girls, a love triangle involving the boss and...well...I don't want to give it all away!\n\nSpeaking of scrumptious, my preference in male characters is Dudley (played by Matthew McNulty), Mr. Moray's right hand man and friend from childhood. He is gorgeous and that lovely Northern accent reminds me of a certain other Victorian Northerner, Mr. Thornton! My online friends will know what I mean!\n\nAlthough based on a wonderful novel by Émile Zola, don't expect high art from this series. This is more Downton Abbey than it is Pride and Prejudice. However it looks like a lot of fun. And my friends in the UK seemed to like this one better than the similar ITV offering Mr. Selfridge. I think NOT having Jeremy Piven in this makes me like it better already. I am not a JP fan!\n\nIf you enjoy Victorian dresses as much as I do, you will appreciate this one for the fashion alone, but it seems there is much more to it than pretty costumes. The Beeb has already commissioned a second series which is a good sign, but then ITV is doing more Mr. Selfridge as well. Perhaps the battle of the Victorian/Edwardian department store series will be determined conclusively when we get to see the second seasons!\n\nSo tighten your corsets my friends and enjoy the ride. It will likely be a bumpy, melodramatic but satisfying romp. And come back and comment with your impressions after you watch the first episode.\n\nCheers!\n\nP.S. Apologies for not including the caveat \"Check local listings\". My local station WNED is at it again, not airing something that PBS has sent me promotional material on! Grrrr!!! If you are in the USA, the first episode is available online for a limited time, so catch it while you can.\n\n↧"
