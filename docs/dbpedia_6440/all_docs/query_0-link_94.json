On completion of her formal education, Beer travelled to Italy where she taught at the University of Padua,The British Institute in Rome, and the Minstero della Aeronautica, Rome. She returned to England in 1953 and published her first collection of poems in 1959. In 1962 she was appointed as a lecturer in English at Goldsmith's College, London where she taught until 1968. On leaving Goldsmith's she became a full-time writer. Her publications explored themes of nature and topography, good and evil, love, religion, ritual and mortality. She married first the literary scholar Philip Nicholas Furbank, then, in 1964, the architect Damien Parsons. The couple returned to Beer's birth county to a farm house in east Devon, near Honiton, where she remained for the rest of her life.\n\nPatricia Beer's archive includes material relating to her literary output, including manuscripts, typescripts, correspondence and audio recordings, as well as notebooks, desk diaries, journals, address books, a small collection of private correspondence, family papers and miscellaneous papers.\n\nFurther information about the literary and personal Papers of Patricia Beer can be found on the archives catalogue.\n\nPapers of Frances Bellerby (EUL MS 331, MS 82, MS 50b)\n\nFrances Bellerby (1899-1975) was a poet, short story writer and novelist. She was born in Bristol and later settled in Cornwall and Devon. In August 1915, her brother Jack was killed in action and his loss affected her all her life. From the age of twenty, she began writing articles for 'The Bristol Times and Mirror'. In 1930, she had a fall while walking along the Lulworth Cliffs on the Dorset coast, which resulted in a spinal injury that recurrently affected her for the rest of her life. Her mother died by suicide in 1932, and Bellerby became estranged from her father. Her marriage faltered from the mid-1930s, ending in divorce in circa 1948, and she moved to a cottage in Cornwall in 1940, where she published poetry, short stories and a novel. In 1950, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. In 1954, she bought a semi-detached cottage in Goveton, near Kingsbridge, Devon, where she remained for the rest of her life and continued to write. In 1957, she contracted arterial claudication, a circulatory condition which made it difficult for her to walk. The cancer recurred in 1973 and she died of breast cancer and ankylosing spondylitis in 1975. Frances Bellerby is primarily remembered for her poetry, of which the main themes are nature, memory, and loss.\n\nThe University of Exeter Special Collections holds several collections of Bellerby's personal and literary papers. Bellerby In addition, correspondence between Bellerby and the poet Charles Causley - who were close friends - can be found in the Papers of Charles Causley.\n\nFurther information about the Frances Bellerby collections can be found on the archives catalogue.\n\nPapers of John Betjeman (EUL MS 240, MS 117)\n\nSir John Betjeman (1906-1984) was a poet, writer on topography and architecture, broadcaster, and Poet Laureate (1972-1984). He published poetry and pieces on topography and architecture, and obtained a job at 'The Architectural Review' in 1930. Betjeman succeeded Cecil Day Lewis as Poet Laureate in 1972, a position which he held until his death. He was knighted in 1969, awarded a CBE in 1960, and a CLitt in 1968. He had a lifelong love of Cornwall, which is reflected in his work, and he died at his home in Trebetherick in 1984.\n\nArchive collections relating to John Betjeman include draft poems, correspondence and archive materials from the John Betjeman Library.\n\nFurther information about the John Betjeman archive collections can be found on the archives catalogue.\n\nSir John Betjeman's Library contains more than 4,000 printed books and pamphlets from the eighteenth to the twentieth century.

In August 1837, he entered Blundell's School in Tiverton, Devon. Blackmore lived with epilepsy, which may have been caused by the physical abuse he is said to have experienced at school. He gained a school scholarship to Exeter College, Oxford, where he went at the end of 1843. After a short time as a tutor decided to study law; he was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in June 1852, and is said to have practised as a conveyancer for some years. On 8 November 1853, Blackmore married Lucy Maguire or McGuire. By 1855, Black had left his career as a lawyer, and worked first as a teacher and then as a fruit farmer in Teddington, which remained his main occupation for the rest of his life. Blackmore's earliest publications were all verse: two volumes under the pseudonym Melanter. For his third novel, 'Lorna Doone', begun in February 1865, Blackmore drew on legends and tales circulating in Devon and Somerset associated with the area of north-east Exmoor. A steady stream of novels continued to flow from his pen, and although they never made as much money for him or their publishers as 'Lorna Doone' had, he was able to place them as serials and obtain good prices. After the death of his wife Lucy in 1888, Blackmore seldom moved far from home. He died of abdominal cancer on 20 January 1900.\n\nThe archive collection amounts to four boxes of literary fragments, exercise books, completed drafts and corrected proofs. These include poems in progress and finished, whole manuscripts, and a number of short stories in proof. There are also a few letters. In addition there is a set of21 printed pamphlets of editions and transcriptions of Blackmore's work donated to the University of Exeter Library by R D Blackmore's relative, David Blackmore in 2018.\n\nFurther information can be found on the archives catalogue.\n\nPapers of Arthur Caddick (EUL MS 124)\n\nArthur Caddick (1911-1987) was born in Coatham, Yorkshire. He was employed at the War Office during the Second World War, before moving his family to Cornwall in 1945. For thirty-six years Caddick lived in the same cottage, 'Windswept', above the village of Nancledra in West Penwith, until ill health necessitated a move to North Devon. Caddick arrived in Cornwall intending to pursue a writing career, and quickly found the inspiration he was searching for in the place and people of his adopted home. Much of his published work is deeply connected to Cornwall, where he mixed with artists and writers and became involved in the rise of the Cornish nationalist movement, an aspect of Cornish life which his writing both celebrates and satirises.\n\nThe collection represents a very full record of his published career and of his engagement in the political and cultural landscape of West Penrith, Cornwall. Included are: correspondence with authors, publishers and artists; autograph manuscripts and typescripts; legal papers; presscuttings; personal and family correspondence; diaries and notebooks; and memoirs by Caddick's wife and daughter.\n\nFurther information about the literary and personal papers of Arthur Caddick can be found on the archives catalogue.\n\nTitles of Arthur Caddick's publications can be browsed via the Library catalogue (local classmark: Reserve 828 9 CAD)\n\nPapers of Charles Causley (EUL MS 50a)\n\nCharles Causley (1917-2003) was a poet, teacher and broadcaster, who was born in Cornwall and is closely associated with the development of a strong regional identity for creative writing in the South West. During the Second World War he served in the Communications Branch of the Royal Navy, as a coder, but with the exception of these Navy years, he lived in Launceston, Cornwall, all his life. After the war Causley returned to Cornwall and taught there until 1976 when he chose to concentrate solely on his writing career. Although he wrote and published plays in the 1930s, it wasn't until after the war that his career as a writer and poet blossomed. His poetry was heavily influenced by traditional popular forms such as folk songs, verses and hymns. Equally influential was his experience in the Navy. He died on November 4, 2003, aged 86, and was buried next to his mother's grave in St Thomas' Churchyard, barely 100 yards from where he was born.\n\nHis archive comprises literary papers, including working notebooks, manuscripts and typescripts; extensive correspondence with other writers such as Ted Hughes, Siegfried Sassoon, Jack Clemo and Frances Bellerby; publicity material; professional and personal photographs; personal papers, including diaries; papers relating to Causley's careers in teaching and broadcasting and the Navy; and Causley's printed book collection.\n\nFurther information about the papers of Charles Causley can be found on the archives catalogue.\n\nTitles from the library of Charles Causley can be browsed via the library catalogue (local classmark: Causley).\n\nLiterary and music papers relating to Beatrice Chase [Olive Katherine Parr] (EUL MS 364)\n\nOlive Katherine Parr was born in Harrow-on-the-Hill on 05 July 1874. She took up the pen name Beatrice Chase as a novelist in 1914. Parr was strongly religious and, after moving to Devon with her mother in 1902 to improve her health - initially to the Dartmoor village of Widecombe-in-the-Moor, and from 1908 on a farm at Venton - she built her own chapel, which she had consecrated by the Catholic Bishop of Plymouth. During the First World War, Parr formed a 'Crusade for Moral Living', which attracted a large following. Soldiers and their partners or relatives at home would write to Parr, pledging to be 'true to honour'. In return, Chase prayed for their souls in her small chapel. Parr's popularity continued to grow throughout the war years, and she received many visitors at Venton where she sold books from the window of her house. Her next attempt at the White Crusade at the outbreak of the Second World War was largely met with indifference. Parr is best known for her novels set on Dartmoor. In addition to novels, she also wrote poetry. Her first book 'The Voice of the River' was published under her birth name in 1903. She used her birth name for seven more books before starting to use the pseudonym, Beatrice Chase, with The Heart of the Moor' in 1914. From then on she tended to use her birth name only for factual and religious writings. Parr was the heroine in John Oxenham's novel 'My Lady of the Moor', and she adopted the title. Olive Katherine Parr died at Newton Abbot Infirmary on 03 July 1955 and was buried in the churchyard at Widecombe-in-the-Moor.\n\nThe collection comprises three music scores with lyrics by Chase, two stories, a review and one photo of her headstone on Dartmoor.\n\nFurther information about the papers of Beatrice Chase can be found on the archives catalogue.\n\nAgatha Christie business papers (EUL MS 99)\n\nDame Agatha Mary Clarissa Mallowan (1890-1976), the novelist known as Agatha Christie, was born in Torquay, Devon.

As a child he experienced two periods of blindness, and by the age of 19 he had lost almost all of his hearing. He began to write at the end of his schooldays, but for many years his only vehicle for publishing his verse and stories was a local newspaper. In 1948, he published a novel, followed by an autobiography in 1949, and a volume of poetry in 1951. Further volumes of poetry in 1961 and 1967 furthered his reputation as a poet. By 1955, he was totally blind and, although periodically he was able to faintly hear music, he could no longer recognise speech.

Her work began to appear in journals and popular periodicals in the 1930s and 1940s, with her 1940s poems appearing in more literary journals, such as 'Poetry Review'. Her first commercial book, 'So I went my way', a double biography of William Mason and his wife Mary, appeared in 1951; but her major work was a series of books she wrote concerning Thomas Hardy, especially concentrating on Hardy's relationships with women.

He studied at the University College, Oxford, but left without a degree in order to embark on a literary career. As that career progressed during the 1930s he corresponded with many of the figures of the literary establishment, some of whom are represented in the archive. Elwin lived in North Stoke, Oxfordshire, during his first marriage, but eloped to North Devon with Eve Conelly in the 1930s. Elwin was a prolific biographer, critic and editor. Later in his career, he published perhaps his best-known work on Lord Byron's wife, Annabella Milbanke. He also had a passionate interest in cricket. Having founded a famous cricket club, the South Oxfordshire Amateurs, Elwin later played for, and became the historian of, the Devon Dumplings.

After the birth of their first son, Michael, he secured a post as a teacher in a prep school in Berkshire. He remained there for the rest of his life, and although the teaching post lasted only a few years, the course of his life continued from then on in the roles of teaching, writing poetry, editing and encouraging others to write. He inherited the Phoenix Press from his uncles and Maurice Carpenter and as its editor he gave a platform for young writers. In 1964, he met fellow writer and artist John Moat, with whom he co-founded the Arvon Foundation in 1968.

She first visited Palestine during the 1930s, under the British Mandate, and was a staunch opponent of the Israeli occupation after 1948. Christopher Joseph Walker (1942-2017) was working in Sotheby's department of historical and literary manuscripts when he came into contact with Mannin in the late 1960s through their shared interest in the Palestinian cause. They developed a strong friendship and corresponded regularly for several years. In their letters - which focus primarily on Palestinian issues and the politics of the Middle East - Mannin shared with the young historian her knowledge of people and places, built up over decades of travel and political activism.
