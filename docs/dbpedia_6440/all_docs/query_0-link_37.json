This document introduces the Kinemacolor film catalogue and discusses the Kinemacolor process which allows for capturing motion pictures in natural colors using only the agency of light. It emphasizes that Kinemacolor recordings can be exhibited within hours of being taken and allow the colors of nature to be permanently recorded and viewed as they were. The introduction also notes that Kinemacolor can be exhibited on existing movie projectors with minimal adaptations.",
