        "text": "POSTCARD 1 (SOLD)\n\nPOSTCARD 2\n\nPOSTCARD 2 (CLOSE-UP)\n\nPostcard 1 is a hand tinted vintage real photo postcard that features Madge Bellamy (1899-1990), an American stage and film actress. She was a popular leading lady in films of the 1920’s and 1930’s. The sound era put the brakes on her career and a romantic scandal in the 1940’s brought it to a total stop. Madge was a Texan. She was born in Hillsboro and was raised in San Antonio and Brownwood. Her father was an English professor at Texas A&M University. As a young child she took dancing lessons but soon, she was interested in becoming an actress. At age 9, she made her stage debut in “Aida”. She and her family moved to Denver, Colorado. She met Carlos Bellamy there and the two married. When Madge decided to leave the state to pursue acting, her marriage ended. Madge went to New York City and worked on Broadway as a dancer. In 1919, she replaced Helen Hayes in Broadway’s “Dear Brutus”, opposite actor, William Gillette. Her career took off thereafter. In 1920, Madge appeared in her first film as a supporting actress to Geraldine Farrar. She then signed a contract with the Triangle Film Corporation. Her “breakout role” was as the title character in Lorna Doone (1922). In 1924 she signed a film contract with Fox Film Corporation. She stayed there five years and during that time she appeared in two films for film director, John Ford. In 1925, she began to have difficulties with fox executives. In 1928, she appeared in Fox’s first talking film, “Mother Knows Best”. In 1928, she married for a second time. The marriage lasted 3 days before she and her husband separated. By 1929, Bellamy’s career entered a tail-spin. She had made poor choices out of her unbridled anger. Fan magazines gave her the nickname of “Miss Firecracker” due to her temperament. In 1929, she also quit her contract with Fox, right after they bought the rights to make a film out of Broadway play. The vehicle was bought with a plan to have Madge be it’s star. Bellamy later admitted she quit over money and added “I got too big for my britches”. She didn’t work again until 1932. She accepted roles in “Poverty Row” (B-movies) films. One of these films was “White Zombie” (1932) in which she appeared opposite Bela Lugosi. Her performance received many poor reviews from film critics. By 1940, Madge basically had no film career. However, she wasn’t done with drama. She was arrested after firing three shots from a .32 caliber revolver at her former lover of five years. The incident was premeditated. She was angry at her intended victim because he married a model shortly after ending their affair. Fortunately, her aim was poor and she missed. The only casualty was her ex boyfriend’s car which took a couple of shots into it’s body. Bellamy pleaded guilty to a lesser charge (violating gun laws), and received a suspended six month sentence and probation. Madge Bellamy’s IMDb filmography reports 61 credits between 1920 and 1945. This vintage postcard is provocative. This postcard is risque for it’s era. She is showing a lot of bare skin. The postcard was published while Madge was under contract with Fox. Therefore, the postcard is from before 1929. The card was published by J. Beagles and is part of the “Famous Cinema Star Series” (No.210P). (SOLD)\n\nPostcard 2 offers another risque view of Madge Bellamy. Her alluring pose and short skirt qualifies this postcard to be considered provocative. This card was produced while Madge was under contract with Fox Films, sometime before 1929. This postcard was published by Ross Verlag as part of a series (No.3907/2).

Ellaline Terriss was a British actress and singer who was active in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Ellaline was the daughter of leading actor William Terriss. He was murdered in 1897 by a deranged actor. She began her acting career in the 1880s. She was best known for her roles in musical comedies and her performances in popular shows such as “The Shop Girl” (1895) and “The Circus Girl” (1896). Terriss was also a talented singer, and her beautiful voice and charming personality made her a popular figure on the London stage. She was considered one of the leading actresses of her day and was known for her versatility, grace, and style. Throughout her career, Terriss appeared in numerous productions in London and on tour in Britain and the United States. She was also the wife of actor and producer, Seymour Hicks, who was a leading man in his own right. She continued to perform and was a prominent figure in the theatrical world until her retirement in the 1920s. Toward the end of her career, Terriss appeared in silent films and made a successful transition into talkies. This cabinet card portrait was taken by celebrated photographer Napoleon Sarony. He was based in New York City. A hand stamp on the reverse of the photograph identifies Siegel-Cooper Company. This firm was a department store in Chicago, Illinois. The store had it’s own photo studio and one wonders if this photograph was an item for sale within that studio.

She was an important actress in Germany during the days of the early Weimar Republic. Hedda’s father was the owner of a brewery and her mother minded the home. In 1912, Hedda was signed by the German Bioscope as an actress. She made her screen debut that same year, acting in the silent film “The Paper Trail’. This was the beginning of a prolific screen career. In 1914 she began her own production company in Berlin and began to produce her own films. Her husband, Hubert Moest was a film director and also founded his own production company. Hetta wrote two screen plays that Moest turned into films. She acted in a silent film, The Women House of Brescia (1920), which was banned by the British Board of Film Classification. The reason for the banning was that the film depicted prostitution. In the 1920’s Hedda’s film career began to wane. New actresses became the hot commodity in the film industry. She began to act in film supporting roles. In total, Hedda acted in over 70 silent films between 1912 and 1925. Hedda was married three times. Her first two marriages ended in divorce. Hedda died in 1925 but the details of her death are shrouded in mystery. The stamp box of this postcard has an interesting story. “NBC” (Neue Bromsilber Convention) was a price cartel established in 1909 that continued until the 1930’s. The purpose of the cartel was to ensure that the minimum price charged for postcards was kept at a sufficiently profitable level.
