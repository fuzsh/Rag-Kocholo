        "text": "Most travelers to Britain visit London at least once.\n\nBuckingham Palace, the Tower of London, the Houses of Parliament, Westminster Abbey … what’s not to love?\n\nBut Britain is so full of beauty and history that it’s just as exciting outside of London as in it.\n\nThere are hundreds of places to take amazing photos but we’ll take a look at fifteen of the best that are sure to keep you snap happy!\n\n1. Cambridgeshire\n\nFounded in 1209, the world-renowned university dominates the skyline of Cambridge.\n\nRunning through the very heart of the city, the River Cam provides amazing views of the “Backs”—a picturesque area where several of the colleges back onto the river.\n\nSnap away as you glide along on one of the many punts for hire, past the great monuments to education including the Old Court of Clare College (below left), and King’s College Chapel.\n\nFounded in 1441 by King Henry VI, the college’s buildings are a magnificent symbol of the power of royal patronage.\n\nGet up at dawn and you’ll be rewarded with views like this.\n\nCambridge — the ancient city of colleges and scholars.\n\nFounded in the 7th century with the building of an Anglo-Saxon abbey that was later destroyed by the Danes, Ely is a beautiful cathedral city about 14 miles northeast of Cambridge.\n\nDating from the 12th century, the current Cathedral was constructed from stone delivered by boat to Ely and paid for with eels from the surrounding fens before they were drained.\n\nMeaning “Isle of Eels”, the slippery critter is thought to be the source of Ely’s name.\n\nArchitectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner called the Octagon, built over Ely Cathedral’s nave, the greatest individual achievement of medieval architectural genius.\n\nGrantchester is said to have the world’s highest concentration of Nobel Prize winners, most of whom are current or retired academics from the nearby University of Cambridge.\n\nStudents and tourists often travel from Cambridge by punt to picnic in the meadows or take tea at The Orchard tea room.\n\n2. Cumbria\n\nServing as inspiration for artists, writers, and musicians, the Lake District lies at the heart of Cumbria’s predominantly rural landscape.\n\nConsidered one of England’s most beautiful scenic areas, the Lake District National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nLiving in Grasmere for 14 years, the poet William Wordsworth described it as “the loveliest spot that man hath ever found.”\n\nMeaning “river with oak trees” in the ancient Celtic language, Derwent Water is fed by the River Derwent and is surrounded by hills and densely wooded slopes.\n\nConveying the fertile nature of the land at both ends of the lake, Buttermere takes its name from the Old English “butere mere”, meaning “the lake by the dairy pastures”.\n\n10 Fascinating Facts About the English Lake District.\n\nLocal folklore tells of a Norse leader named Jarl Buthar who ran a resistance campaign in the 11th century against the Norman invaders from a stronghold at Buttermere.\n\nFormed by glaciers 13000 years ago during the last major ice age, Windermere is England’s largest natural lake.\n\nPopular for holidays and summer homes since 1847, Windermere has several steam-powered boats operating along the whole 10-mile length, with one dating back to 1891.\n\n3. Dorset\n\nWith its rolling green hills, grazing cows, pretty stone walls, and Norman village church, Abbotsbury could be heaven on earth.\n\nViewed from St Catherine’s Chapel, a 14th-century pilgrimage chapel that stands on a hill overlooking Abbotsbury, you can expect to capture beautiful views like the one below.\n\nAccording to local tradition, up until the late 19th century, the young women of Abbotsbury would pray to St Catherine, the patron saint of spinsters and virgins, to help them find a good husband.\n\nDescribed as “one of the most romantic sights in England”, Gold Hill in the town of Shaftsbury has provided the setting for film and television, as well as appearing on countless chocolate boxes and calendars.\n\nAppearing in Britain’s favourite TV advertisement, the 1973 “Boy on a Bike” advert for Hovis bread was directed by Ridley Scott and featured Dvořák’s nostalgic Symphony No. 9.\n\n18 Gorgeous English Thatched Cottages.\n\nLike a giant petrified dinosaur turned to rock, Durdle Door is a natural limestone arch on a dramatic stretch of coastline called the “Jurassic Coast”.\n\nSpanning 185 million years of geological history, coastal erosion and contrasting rock hardness shaped this World Heritage Site and photographer’s dream.\n\nOne of the world’s finest examples of an oval coastal inlet, Lulworth Cove—close to Durdle Door— is a popular tourist attraction with over half a million visitors a year.\n\n4. East Sussex\n\nGradually being eroded by the English Channel, the massive white chalk cliffs, known as the Seven Sisters, are remnants of dry valleys in the South Downs.\n\nEach of the cliff peaks has its own name: Haven Brow, Short Brow, Rough Brow, Brass Point, Flagstaff Point, Flat Hill, and Baily’s Hill.\n\nReportedly haunted by smugglers, the Mermaid Inn (covered in Ivy on the right) has a long and turbulent history dating from the 12th century.\n\nOne of the best-known inns in southern England, the black and white timber-framed buildings and the sloping cobbled Mermaid street provide a beautiful setting for a timeless photograph.\n\nBuilt in 1385 by a former knight of King Edward III, its purpose was to protect the region from a French invasion during the Hundred Years’ War (1337 – 1453).\n\nSurrounded by a moat, and of a quadrangular plan with crenelated towers, it provides a perfect photographic subject at any time of day, but especially in the warm late afternoon sunlight.\n\nOpening in 1899, the Palace Pier is the only one of three piers still in operation at Brighton.\n\nFeatured in many works of British culture including the gangster thriller Brighton Rock and the Mods and Rockers film Quadrophenia, against a sunset sky, it takes on a sublime quality.\n\n5. Gloucestershire\n\nDepicted on the inside cover of UK passports, Arlington Row is a series of cottages converted from a 14th-century monastic wool store, becoming weaver’s homes in the 17th century.\n\nUsed as a film and television location, it has been featured in the movies Stardust and Bridget Jones’s Diary and attracts thousands of tourists hoping to capture a shot like this.\n\nInhabited since the 11th century, Lower Slaughter is a beautiful village in the Cotswolds with a river running through it spanned by several small stone footbridges.\n\nGlorious Gloucestershire.\n\nAt the west end of Lower Slaughter sits a 19th-century water mill with a chimney that, together with nearby honey-colored stone cottages, provides a lovely photograph with near perfect reflections.\n\nStraddling the River Wye on the county border between Herefordshire and Gloucestershire, Symonds Yat is an English village within the Forest of Dean and a popular tourist destination.\n\nThe name is said to come from Robert Symonds, a 17th-century sheriff of Herefordshire, and “yat” meaning a gate or pass.\n\n6. Cornwall\n\nPopular with tourists and painters alike, the dramatic stretch of rocky coastline known as Bedruthan Steps is one of the most popular destinations in Cornwall, providing spectacular clifftop views.\n\nAccording to legend, the massive granite rocks rising from the beach are stepping stones for the Giant Bedruthan.\n\nNotice the scale of the huge rock stacks compared to the people on the beach.\n\nFans of British TV may recognize Port Isaac as the backdrop for the comedy-drama Doc Martin about a belligerent London surgeon who develops a fear of blood and moves to a backwater Cornish village to begin a new life as the community doctor.\n\nWith a history dating back to the time of Henry VIII, this picturesque fishing village is one of the delights on the South West Coast long-distance footpath which provides perfect views of the harbour like this one.\n\nCentered around the steep-sided valley of the River Looe, the small coastal town of Looe dates to the 12th century.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, it was a major port, exporting local tin and granite, as well as a thriving fishing and boatbuilding center.\n\n40 Stunning Images of Cornwall in 1895.\n\nBut by the 19th century, the Victorians recognized its charm as a seaside holiday town for which it remains popular today, with dozens of hotels, guest houses, restaurants, pubs, and vendors of traditional regional specialties like Cornish ice-cream and pasties.\n\nSituated on the Lizard peninsula—the most southerly tip of the British mainland—the ruggedly beautiful Keynance Cove became popular with Victorians including Queen Victoria and Prince Albert and the poet Alfred Lord Tennyson.\n\nStunning views over Keynance Cove like this one can be enjoyed from the South West Coast long-distance footpath.\n\n7. Isle of Wight\n\nWinding its way through Shanklin Old Village, the High Street is lined with charming thatched cottages, traditional tea rooms, and restaurants with names like Pencil Cottage, the Village Inn, and Strawberry Thatch.\n\nShanklin Old Village ranks as one of the best chocolate box photographic opportunities in Britain.\n\nOverlooking the village of Godshill stands the medieval All Saints Church which is fronted by a row of pristine thatched cottages as seen from Church Hill road.\n\nNoted for its medieval wall painting of a Lily crucifix—one of only two in Europe—it was whitewashed during the Reformation to save it from destruction, remaining hidden until the 19th century.\n\nBuilt between 1845 and 1851 as a summer house for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, Osborne House is a must-see on the Isle of Wight.\n\nDesigned by Prince Albert himself in the style of an Italian Renaissance palazzo, it became the place of Queen Victoria’s death in 1901.\n\nQueen Victoria’s Beloved Pomeranians.\n\nRising nearly 100 feet out of the sea off the Isle of Wight’s western coast, three giant stacks of chalk called “the Needles”, with a Victorian-era lighthouse at the outer edge, make a dramatic photograph from the clifftop viewing spots.\n\nTaking their name from a fourth needle-shaped chalk stack that collapsed in 1764, the name stuck even though the remaining stacks are not needle-like.\n\n8. Norfolk\n\nBuilt in 1816 for miller Edmund Savory, Burnham Overy Staithe Mill is one of almost 200 surviving mills across Norfolk county.\n\nConverted to holiday accommodation, the mill is a protected building of historical importance and provides beautiful photographic opportunities, especially at sunrise.\n\nDating from 1912 and built on the foundations of an 18th-century mill, Horsey Windpump is a drainage windmill in the beautiful Norfolk Broads near the seaside resort of Great Yarmouth.\n\nDating back to the Tudor period, the historic cobbled lane of Elm Hill is a famous landmark in the city of Norwich.\n\nNamed after the old elm trees that once stood in the town square, Elm Hill was home to wealthy 15th-century merchants in the city’s weaving industry.\n\nLike Gold Hill in Dorset and Mermaid Street in East Sussex, Elm Hill makes a beautiful photographic subject.\n\nConstructed out of flint and mortar and faced with cream-coloured limestone from northwestern France near Caen, work began on Norwich Cathedral in 1096 and took another fifty years to complete.\n\nExceeded only by Salisbury Cathedral, the cloisters are the second-largest in the UK, through which a beautifully framed image of the second-tallest spire can be photographed.\n\n9. Northern Ireland\n\nAbout three miles northeast of the town of Bushmills in County Antrim lies an area of ancient lava flow comprising some 40,000 interlocking basalt columns known as the Giant’s Causeway.\n\nLegend has it that the columns were built by the Irish giant Finn MacCool from Gaelic mythology, who was challenged to a fight by the Scottish giant Benandonner.\n\nUpon seeing Benandonner was much larger than himself, Finn hides and his wife disguises him as a baby, thus fooling Benandonner into thinking Finn’s father must be a true giant of giants.\n\nBenandonner flees back to Scotland and destroys the causeway behind him.\n\nIdentical basalt columns from the same lava flow can be found on the Scottish side of the causeway at Fingal’s Cave on the Isle of Staffa.\n\nLinking the mainland to the tiny island of Carrickarede, a famous rope bridge spans the 66-ft gap, with a drop of nearly 100 feet to the rocks below.\n\nDesignated an area of outstanding beauty, it makes for stunning photographs, but be wary of crossing the bridge if you’re afraid of heights—some people cannot stomach the return journey and have to be taken off the island by boat.\n\nIf you’re a fan of Game of Thrones, you may recognize this remarkable avenue of beech trees used as a location in the fantasy drama television series.\n\n40 Beautiful Images of Ireland in 1895.\n\nCelebrating the completion of Gracehill House in 1775, James Stuart planted over 150 beech trees along the approach road to create an imposing corridor.\n\nAccording to legend, the ghost of the Grey Lady haunts the road, flitting from tree to tree.\n\n10. Oxfordshire\n\nFounded around 1096, the University of Oxford—the oldest university in the English-speaking world—dominates the “city of dreaming spires”.\n\nIf you’re lucky enough to take a hot air balloon ride over Oxford, incredible views like the one below are yours to savour.\n\n38 constituent colleges are scattered throughout the city centre, forming a beautifully preserved architectural wonder.\n\nViewed from the University Church of St Mary the Virgin, the neo-classical Radcliffe Camera looks resplendent in the golden evening sunlight.\n\nBuilt between 1737 and 1749 to house a science library funded by wealthy local doctor John Radcliffe, it is considered the most magnificent structure in Oxford.\n\n10 Reasons to Love Oxford—the City of Dreaming Spires.\n\nBirthplace of Sir Winston Churchill, Blenheim Palace is a monumental English Baroque country house originally granted as a gift to John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough for his military triumphs in the Battle of Blenheim of 1704.\n\nLarger than Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, or even Versailles, the sheer scale of Blenheim has to be seen to be appreciated and is difficult to squeeze in the frame.\n\nWith its richly colored stone columns against a dramatic sky, Blenheim is a photo gem.\n\nKnown as the “gateway” to the Cotswolds, Burford is a delightful medieval town on the River Windrush in West Oxfordshire.\n\nIt was the scene of a great battle in AD 752 between Cuthred, king of the West Saxons and Æthelbald, king of the Mercians, in which the Saxons vanquished the Mercians.\n\nLocal legend tells of a ghostly apparition of an unpopular 16th-century Lord and his wife riding a fiery coach through the town and bringing a curse upon all who see it.\n\nFortunately, the ghosts were corked in a glass bottle during an exorcism and cast into the river!\n\n11. Scotland\n\n“Bonnie” meaning “pretty, attractive” is the perfect word to describe Scotland’s dramatic landscape.\n\nCovered by ice sheets during the ice age, Scotland has been shaped by glaciation, forming towering mountains, deep glens, glittering lochs, thick woodland, and rolling pastureland.\n\nSteeped in history and the struggle for freedom, Scotland is dotted with romantic historic castles and ruins that take your breath away.\n\nOne of the most iconic landmarks is Eilean Donan Castle in the western Highlands.\n\nEilean Donan—a place to live forever?\n\nFictional setting of Sir Walter Scott’s poem The Lady of the Lake and the opera La donna del lago by Rossini, Loch Katrine is a popular scenic attraction within reach from Glasgow on a day trip.\n\nForming the boundary between the lowlands of Central Scotland and the Highlands, Loch Lomond is the largest inland stretch of water in Britain by surface area.\n\nSurrounded by hills, Loch Lomond is popular as a leisure destination and is featured in the song “The Bonnie Banks o’ Loch Lomond”, a well-known traditional Scottish song first published in 1841.\n\nDominating the skyline of Edinburgh from its position atop Castle Rock, Edinburgh Castle is a historic fortress and one of Scotland’s most-visited attractions, with over 2 million visitors a year.\n\nA Tour of Magical Victorian Scotland.\n\nPrincess Street Gardens makes a superb location from which to capture the castle, featuring the Victorian Ross Fountain, once exhibited at the International Exhibition of 1862 in Kensington, London.\n\n12. Somerset\n\nCrafted from honey-coloured stone, Bath became a popular spa town in the Georgian era as word spread of its curative natural spring water.\n\nDesigned by Robert Adam, one of the most successful and fashionable architects of the 18th century, his Palladian-style Pulteney Bridge is exceptional for having shops built across its entire span on both sides.\n\nOn a still day, the much-photographed bridge reflects almost perfectly in the River Avon.\n\nBuilt around a Roman site for public bathing, the Roman Baths complex is a major tourist spot, attracting over a million visitors a year.\n\n10 of the Best Things To Do in the City of Bath.\n\nAttracting about half a million visitors a year is a deep limestone gorge in the Mendip Hills of Somerset known as Cheddar Gorge.\n\nRising almost 450 feet with near-vertical cliff-face sides, a dramatic photo opportunity is from the top looking down on the road snaking its way along the bottom of the gorge.\n\nBuilt between 1175 and 1490, Wells Cathedral is a dominant feature of the city of Wells and the surrounding Somerset countryside.\n\nCalled “the most poetic” of English cathedrals, the style is pure Gothic and thought to be the first truly Gothic structure in Europe.\n\nThe Pillars of the Earth – Inside England’s Medieval Cathedrals.\n\nDisplaying more than 300 sculpted figures, the façade has been described as “the supreme triumph of the combined plastic arts in England”.\n\nIt is a superb opportunity to capture in detail the fruits of medieval English craftsmanship.\n\n13. Wales\n\nKnown as the “land of song” thanks to a centuries-old Welsh festival of literature, music, and performance, this Celtic nation of valleys is home to some of the most beautiful landscapes in Britain.\n\nPen-y-Gwryd is a mountain pass close to the foot of Snowdon, the highest mountain in Wales.\n\nThe famous mountaineering hostelry, Pen-y-Gwryd Hotel, is located in the pass and is where the first successful Everest expedition team of 1953 stayed to train in the mountains of Snowdonia.\n\nFormed by a post-glacial massive landslide that dammed the lake within the glaciated valley, Tal-y-llyn Lake is the most-photographed lake in Wales.\n\nFor a long time from the 13th century on, Llanrwst’s wool trade was so important that it set the price of wool for the whole of Britain.\n\nAcross from Pont Fawr—a narrow three-arch stone bridge built by famed 16th-century English architect Inigo Jones—sits the beautiful ivy-covered Tu Hwnt I’r Bont Tearoom.\n\n40 Beautiful Images of Wales from the 1890s.\n\nOriginally a farmhouse, the building predates the bridge by about 100 years and creates a perfect chocolate box photograph.\n\nFormed from Carboniferous Limestone, the Green Bridge of Wales is a natural arch on the stunning Pembrokeshire coastline\n\nDescribed as the most spectacular arch in Britain, at around 80ft high, the Green Bridge is a popular tourist attraction and makes for a superb photo opportunity from the coastal footpath above.\n\n14. Wiltshire\n\nBest known for the prehistoric monument of standing stones called Stonehenge, Wiltshire has much to offer the avid photographer.\n\nConstructed between 3000 and 2000 years before Christ, each stone is around 13 feet high, 7 feet wide and weighs around 25 tons.\n\nSurrounded by myth, exactly how Stonehenge was built and what it was used for remain a mystery.\n\nQuintessentially English, and often considered the prettiest village in England, Castle Combe is unsurprisingly popular as a filming location, having featured in Steven Spielberg’s War Horse and the original Dr Doolittle film.\n\nUnmistakably Cotswold, with its honey-coloured local stone, beautiful photos are all but guaranteed.\n\nIf you enjoyed the 2005 movie Pride & Prejudice, starring Keira Knightley, then you’ll love the gardens of Stourhead’s 2,650-acre estate where some of the filming took place.\n\nOne of the best views is across the bridge towards the Pantheon, thought to be the most important visual feature of the gardens.\n\nPerched on a perfect green lawn, Salisbury Cathedral is a true wonder of medieval architecture.\n\nNot only has it the tallest spire in Britain at 404 feet, but the largest cloister and the largest cathedral close.\n\nContaining the best surviving copy of the Magna Carta—the founding text of Liberty—and one of the oldest working clocks in the world, Salisbury Cathedral is a must-see and a sight to behold.\n\n15. Yorkshire\n\nLargest of all British counties, Yorkshire is home to the historic city of York and to vast areas of unspoiled countryside.\n\nSometimes nicknamed “God’s Own Country”, the Yorkshire Dales comprises river valleys and hills with pastures separated by dry-stone walls and grazed by sheep and cattle.\n\nSwaledale is a typical limestone Yorkshire dale, with narrow valley floor, glacier-formed valley sides, green meadows, and fellside fields.\n\nOpened in 1875 to carry the Settle-Carlisle Railway across Baty Moss in the valley of the River Ribble, the Ribblehead Viaduct is one of the great feats of Victorian engineering and complements the scenery with its graceful curve of arches.\n\n10 Fun Facts About the Yorkshire Dales: England’s Green and Pleasant Land.\n\nOverhanging timber-framed buildings dating back as far as the 14th century characterize the medieval street known as “the Shambles” in the city of York.\n\nOnce home to 25 butchers’ shops, its name derived from the Anglo-Saxon Fleshammels meaning “flesh shelves”.\n\nToday, the Shambles is a mix of eateries, souvenir shops, a bookshop, and a bakery that make for a delightful photograph, especially in the early light of dawn.\n\nThe Shambles—York’s Famous Medieval Street.\n\nDramatically set into a rocky gorge, Knaresborough is a historic medieval market town and spa.\n\nWeaving up from the river, a maze of cobbled paths and stone staircases begs to be explored.\n\nBuilt in 1851, the castellated viaduct with its soaring arches spanning the River Nidd makes an excellent photo taken from the ruins of Knaresborough Castle.\n\nThe “right to roam” across hill and valley, field and glen, moor and fen.\n\nNot quite … but it’s close.\n\nEngland and Wales have designated paths on which our right to pass and re-pass is protected by law.\n\nCalled “rights of way”, this legal entitlement provides the public with access to some of the most beautiful scenery in Britain.\n\nWe can also use the “right to roam” on open access land, which includes mountains, moors, heaths, and downs that are privately owned.\n\nBut there are exceptions, including farmland used to grow crops and land close to buildings.\n\nSo the next time you hear an angry farmer shouting “get off my land”, please remember to follow the public footpath signs.\n\nOnly in Scotland is the public allowed the “freedom to roam” any route that meets certain conditions.\n\nMost footpaths in the countryside are hundreds of years old.\n\nOf all the footpaths in Britain, it is the long-distance National Trails that are among the most beautiful, passing through miles of stunning and diverse landscapes.\n\nWe’ll focus on three of the best.\n\nThe Cotswold Way\n\nAt 102 miles, the Cotswold Way is the shortest and easiest of our three examples of long-distance footpaths and one of the most delightful.\n\nGently rolling hills rise from the meadows of the upper reaches of the River Thames creating a gorgeous grassland habitat that is ideal for sheep farming.\n\nFlourishing during the medieval period, the Cotswolds’ wool trade created the wealth that has shaped so much of the region’s beauty.\n\nDotted with picturesque little villages, beautiful Georgian towns, and ancient sites, the Cotswold Way starts in the south at the city of Bath and ends in the charming market town of Chipping Campden.\n\nBath is a World Heritage Site largely because of its beautiful Georgian architecture in honey-coloured stone.\n\nMuch photographed in Bath is the 18th-century Palladian style Pulteney Bridge and weir.\n\n10 of the best things to do in the City of Bath.\n\nNotable for its elegant terraced High Street, Chipping Campden features many buildings from the 14th through the 17th century.\n\nMeaning “market-place”, the word “Chipping” is found in other English town names like Chipping Norton and Chipping Sodbury.\n\nOnce a rich wool trading centre in medieval times, today it is a popular tourist haunt with old inns, pubs, and specialist shops.\n\nStanding proudly at the centre of the town is the medieval arched Market Hall, built in 1627.\n\nOften referred to as the “Jewel of the Cotswolds”, Broadway is another charming village along the Cotswold Way.\n\nLined with red chestnut trees and honey-coloured Cotswold limestone buildings, the wide grass-fringed main street gives Broadway its name.\n\nDesigned by James Wyatt in 1794 to resemble a mock “Saxon” castle, Broadway Tower is a folly in the English county of Worcestershire and built for Lady Coventry in 1799.\n\nPerched on the edge of the second highest point in the Cotswolds overlooking the Severn Vale, on a clear day, as many as 16 English counties can be identified from the top of the tower.\n\nBuilt in the late 1500s, Stanway House is a Jacobean manor near the village of Stanway along the Cotswold Way.\n\nProtected as a building of exceptional historic interest, Stanway House has been featured in the British comedy-drama series Jeeves and Wooster, starring Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry, and the period drama Father Brown.\n\nWith its manicured gardens and superbly preserved structure dating back to the 1400s, Sudeley Castle is well worth a visit as you walk the Cotswold Way.\n\nOnce the home of Dowager Queen Catherine Parr, last of Henry VIII’s six wives, the castle chapel holds her marble tomb.\n\nWith countless beautiful old pubs and little antique shops, there’s plenty to discover on the Cotswold Way for memories that will last a lifetime.\n\nThe Pennine Way\n\nRunning 267 miles along the Pennine Hills, dubbed “the backbone of England”, the Pennine Way starts in the Peak District and ends just inside the Scottish border.\n\nAround 260,000 walkers use all or part of the path each year, which includes 287 gates, 432 stiles, and 204 bridges.\n\nAccording to local ramblers, it is “one of Britain’s best known and toughest” national trails.\n\nInspired by America’s Appalachian Trail, journalist Tom Stephenson proposed the concept for the path in 1935 and lobbied parliament for an official trail.\n\nKnown as the official start of the Pennine Way, the Old Nag’s Head in Edale is a low-ceilinged, stone-built pub sitting at the top of Edale village square since 1577.\n\nHand-pulled real ales and old-fashioned English pub fare are very popular after a long day hiking to local viewing spots with names like “The Nab” and “Ringing Roger”.\n\nThe Yorkshire Dales: England’s Green and Pleasant Land.\n\nNestled in the Swaledale valley of the Yorkshire Dales, Thwaite is a beautiful little village with buildings made from local stone.\n\nOriginating from Old Norse “thveit”, the name Thwait means a clearing, implying that the area was once covered by thick forest.\n\nGrazed by sheep and cattle, the green upland pastures are separated by dry-stone walls built without mortar but stable thanks to a unique construction of interlocking stones.\n\nThe Kearton Tearooms and guesthouse are named after pioneering 19th-century wildlife photographers Richard and Cherry Kearton.\n\nNamed after the River Swale, meaning “rapid and liable to deluge” in old Anglo-Saxon, Swaledale is a typical limestone Yorkshire Dale with a narrow valley floor and green meadow glacier-formed valley sides.\n\nDeriving from the Viking word Kelda meaning a spring, Keld is at the confluence of the Pennine Way and another long-distance footpath called the Coast to Coast Walk.\n\nComprising a series of four steps, each its own small waterfall with the largest single drop being about 20 feet, Catrake Force is about 1/2 mile walk from Keld along the Pennine Way.\n\nWaterfalls in the north of England are often called Forces after the Norse word Foss which means waterfall, whilst Catrake derives from the Latin “cataracta”, also meaing waterfall.\n\nThe South West Coast Path\n\nVoted “Britain’s Best Walking route” twice in a row by the Ramblers Walk magazine, at 630 miles, it is the longest of our three featured long-distance walks.\n\nSince the South West Coast Path rises and falls at the mouth of each river, it is one of the most challenging walks in Britain.\n\nOriginating as a route for the Coastguard to walk from lighthouse to lighthouse patrolling for smugglers, it hugs the coastline and provides excellent views of the dozens of bays and coves.\n\nTurquoise waters lap beautiful deserted beaches.\n\nSkylarks rise above steep green pastures.\n\nIs this some Caribbean paradise isle?\n\nNo, this is Lantic Bay, Cornwall, a part of England bathed in the warmth of the Gulf Stream—an Atlantic ocean current originating in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nLying within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Portloe is a good example of a secluded small fishing village that’s relatively untouched by tourism.\n\nTwo full-time working fishing vessels haul in fresh crab and lobster to be enjoyed at the Ship Inn or Lugger Hotel.\n\nOnce a staging point on the pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral for those pilgrims traveling from further west by sea and from Brittany in France, Kingswear village sits on the east bank of the River Dart in Devon.\n\nServing as the railhead for the Dartmouth Steam Railway, Kingswear provides walkers of the South West Coast path a chance to ride on an original steam train that first opened in 1859 to the seaside resort of Paignton about 7 miles away.\n\nDurdle Door (sometimes written Durdle Dor) is a natural limestone arch on the Jurassic Coast near Lulworth in Dorset.\n\nPrivately owned but open to the public, the name Durdle is derived from the Old English ‘thirl’ meaning bore or drill.\n\nSpanning 185 million years of geological history, the 96-mile long Jurassic Coast is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nCoastal erosion has exposed rock formations and fossils covering the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous geological periods.\n\nRadically reshaped in the 18th and 19th centuries by deep-lode mining for copper and tin, the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape is another UNESCO World Heritage Site along the South West Coast Path.\n\nReflecting the flowering of innovation during the Industrial Revolution, the mines, engine houses, foundries, and ports enabled the region to produce two-thirds of the world’s supply of copper.\n\nFollowing the copper crash of the 1860’s, production turned to focus on tin mining.\n\nOn your way along the north coast path of Cornwall, you might like to drop in on the picturesque fishing village of Port Isaac which served as the backdrop for the popular TV series Doc Martin.\n\nThe only question remaining is which path to take first?\n\nDecisions, decisions.\n\nBeautiful villages, a Regency spa town, an ancient city, historic docklands, and some of England’s most picturesque open countryside are yours to discover and explore when you visit Gloucestershire.\n\nComprising part of the Cotswold Hills, the River Severn fertile valley, and the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire offers some of the most outstanding scenery anywhere in Britain.\n\nGloucestershire’s Countryside\n\nOn a clear day, one of the finest views across the spa town of Cheltenham and out toward the Malvern Hills beyond can be enjoyed from the top of Leckhampton Hill.\n\nGloucestershire’s countryside is gorgeous.\n\nWinding through the Wye Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), the River Wye is the fifth-longest river in the United Kingdom and forms part of the border between England and Wales.\n\nAbove a disused quarry in Leckhampton, a peculiar-shaped limestone rock formation known as “the Devil’s Chimney” rises from the ground.\n\nLegend has it that the Devil would sit atop Leckhampton Hill and hurl stones at Sunday churchgoers, but that God turned the stones back, driving the Devil underground and trapping him there forever.\n\nReserved for royal hunting by Anglo-Saxon kings, the Forest of Dean is one of the last surviving ancient woodlands in England.\n\nCovering almost 43 square miles, the name is thought to originate from the Viking settlements, referring to the region as “Danubia” meaning “land of Danes”.\n\nRising in the Cotswold Hills of Gloucestershire, the River Churn is the first tributary of the famous River Thames.\n\nMuch of the catchment basin of the River Churn is known to have been an important area of Roman settlement in the second to fourth centuries AD.\n\nGloucestershire’s Roman Beginnings\n\nFounded in AD 97 by the Romans under Emperor Nerva, Gloucester is the county city of Gloucestershire.\n\nDerived from the Roman name “Glevum” or “Glouvia” and the Anglo-Saxon word “ceaster” meaning fort, Gloucester was once a Roman colony for retired legionaries.\n\nGranted farmland and called upon as Roman auxiliaries, legionaries built luxurious villas with exquisite mosaic floors.\n\nGloucestershire has some of the best Roman villas in Britain.\n\nIncluding a heated and furnished west wing containing a dining-room (triclinium) with a fine mosaic floor, as well as two separate bathing suites—one for damp-heat and one for dry-heat—Chedworth Villa was an elite dwelling and one of the largest Roman villas in Britain.\n\nGloucester’s Medieval Gothic Cathedral\n\nOriginating in the 7th century as a church for the abbey dedicated to Saint Peter, Gloucester Cathedral has a Norman core with a 15th-century tower rising 225ft and topped by four delicate pinnacles—a local landmark visible for miles.\n\nThe cathedral cloisters were used for corridor scenes in several Harry Potter films, whilst the crypt featured in Sherlock’s Christmas special.\n\nAt over 1000 years old, Gloucester Cathedral is the oldest building in the world to have a solar array installed to reduce energy costs.\n\nDesigned between 1351 and 1377 by Thomas de Canterbury, the cloisters at Gloucester are the earliest surviving fan vaults.\n\nGloucester’s Docklands\n\nVictorian ships once discharged their cargoes of corn from Ireland and Europe, timber from the Baltic and North America, and wines and spirits from Portugal and France.\n\nTransferred to narrow canal boats, the goods were carried up the River Severn and through the inland canal network to the growing industrial towns of the Midlands.\n\nCheltenham Spa\n\nMeaning “health and education”, Cheltenham’s motto “Salubritas et Eruditio” helped establish the town as a health and holiday spa resort since mineral springs were discovered in 1716.\n\nRecognizing the commercial potential of its mineral springs, Captian Henry Skillicorne was regarded as “the founder of Cheltenham as a watering place”.\n\nBuilding a pump room to regulate the water flow and an elaborate well-house with ballrooms and billiard room, well-to-do Georgian society flocked to Cheltenham.\n\nKnown for its elegant Regency buildings, tree-lined promenades and gardens, Cheltenham has remained a popular upscale shopping and entertainment destination through the Victorian era and up to the present day.\n\nRegarded by many as among the finest Regency buildings in Britain, Cheltenham’s municipal offices were constructed during the reign of King George IV (1820 – 1830).\n\nSince 1815, horse racing has been an important sport in Cheltenham, with £6m in prize money and over 700,000 visitors each year.\n\nCotswold Towns and Villages\n\nDozens of pretty villages and towns dot the Gloucestershire landscape.\n\nRising from the meadows of the upper River Thames is a range of rolling hills with a grassland habitat and a beautiful honey-coloured stone used to build villages, towns, and country houses.\n\nNotable for its elegant terraced High Street, dating from the 14th century to the 17th century, Chipping Campden was a rich wool centre of the Middle Ages.\n\n“Chipping” derives from the Old English “cēping”, meaning marketplace.\n\nBuilt in 1627, the arched Market Hall stands proudly at the centre of town.\n\nMeaning “Farmstead on the Moor”, the delightful town of Moreton-in-Marsh has many buildings made from the local honey-colored Cotswold Stone, including several antique shops, art galleries, and hotels.\n\nKnown for its picturesque High Street, flanked by long, wide greens with the River Windrush running through it, Bourton-on-the-Water is known locally as the “Venice of the Cotswolds”.\n\nOnce part of the second-largest area of a city in Roman Britain, Cirencester grew into a thriving market town in the Middle Ages, trading in wool and cloth.\n\nBuilt in 1380 as a monastic wool store, the picturesque Arlington Row cottages were converted into weavers cottages in the 17th century and are a very popular tourist hotspot and photographers’ favorite.\n\nCastles, Country Houses, and Gardens\n\nCastle-building in Gloucestershire began after the 1066 Norman invasion, with fortified manor houses becoming more popular in the 13th and 14th centuries.\n\nBuilt in the 15th century, Sudeley Castle replaced a much earlier 12th-century castle that was destroyed by King Stephen during the “Anarchy”—a civil war against his cousin Empress Matilda.\n\nSeverely damaged during the English Civil War, the current castle is the result of extensive Victorian restoration.\n\nDating back to the 11th century, Berkeley Castle is believed to be the scene of King Edward II’s murder.\n\nHis body is interred in a canopied shrine in Gloucester Cathedral\n\nBuilt by Walter and Miles de Gloucester for the crown in the 11th century, St Briavels Castle was used to govern the Welsh Marches on the border of England and Wales.\n\nEmpress Matilda held the castle during the Anarchy and it later became a hunting lodge for King John and then a center for making crossbow arrows.\n\nHidcote Manor Garden is one of the best-known Arts and Crafts gardens in Britain.\n\nFlourishing in Europe and North America between 1880 and 1920, Arts and Crafts was a movement of decorative and fine arts that began in Britain and advocated traditional craftsmanship of simple forms, with medieval, folk, and romantic influences.\n\nBuilt in the 1860s in an Elizabethan style, the Victorian mansion of Westonbirt House replaced earlier buildings in the Georgian and Tudor eras.\n\nOccupied by Westonbirt School—a girls’ boarding school—since 1928, the house and 210-acre grounds are open to the public on certain days.\n\nSurrounded by 274 acres of formal gardens, the baroque Dyrham Park country house was built during the 17th and early 18th centuries.\n\nSumptuously decorated with wood paneling and tiles of Dutch Delftware, the artwork and artifacts include a collection of Dutch Masters.\n\nStanway House is a Jacobean manor house set in historic parkland with a recently installed fountain rising 300ft, making it the tallest gravity fountain in the world.\n\nChurches and Abbeys\n\nOne of the finest examples of Norman architecture in Britain, Tewkesbury Abbey is also the second largest parish church in the country.\n\nFormerly a Benedictine Monastery, it became one of the wealthiest abbeys of medieval England.\n\nHousing the most complete set of medieval stained glass in Britain, the parish church of Saint Mary at Fairford is an example of late Perpendicular Gothic architecture characterised by slim stone window mullions and light but strong buttresses.\n\nThe style enabled larger windows than previously, allowing much more light into the building.\n\nKnown as the “Cathedral of the Cotswolds”, St John the Baptist parish church in Cirencester was financed by wealthy wool merchants.\n\nWhether you visit for a day trip or a longer stay, you’re sure to fall in love with Gloucestershire again and again.\n\nRolling hills, sandy beaches, fossil cliffs, medieval towns, and moorland—the English county of Devon has it all.\n\nDeriving its name from the ancient Dumnonii tribe of Brittonic Celts, Devon is thought to mean “deep valley dwellers”.\n\nWith so much to experience and enjoy, we’re convinced you’ll be dreaming of dwelling in Devon for your next vacation.\n\nLandscape and Scenery\n\nDevon is the only English county with two separate coastlines—the ruggedly beautiful rural north, with its dramatic cliffs rising 1000 ft from the sea, and the gentler rolling hills of the south, dotted with pretty towns and seaside resorts.\n\nLashed by the Atlantic ocean, North Devon’s coastal swells draw surfers from far and wide.\n\nBathed in the semi-tropical warmth carried on the Gulf Stream, South Devon experiences a milder climate, with seaside family resort towns and pretty fishing villages.\n\nSeaside Towns and Beaches\n\nThe opening of Britain’s railways during the Victorian Era enabled ordinary folk to travel to seaside resorts all across Britain.\n\nComparing well with the French Riviera, Victorians began calling the outstanding 22-mile stretch of coastline centered on Torbay the “English Riviera”, and the name stuck.\n\nWith its picturesque harbours, bustling towns, and family-friendly beaches, the English Riviera is perfect for either a day trip or a longer stay.\n\nCaptivated by the beauty of the Georgian town of Sidmouth, the Poet Laureate John Betjeman called it “a town caught in a timeless charm”.\n\nFamily fun and happy childhood memories are what a holiday in Devon is all about.\n\nNational Parks\n\nEncompassing two National Parks, two World Heritage Sites, and five Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), over half of Devon’s land is protected by law.\n\nKnown for its rounded boulder-like outcrops of granite called tors, over 160 hills include the word “tor” in their name.\n\nHardy, and with excellent stamina and a kind temperament, Dartmoor ponies have lived in the south west of England for hundreds of years.\n\nUsed as a working animal by local quarries and tin mines, their numbers have fallen from around 25,000 in the 1930s to a few thousand today.\n\nInspiring Britain’s writers for centuries, Devon has featured in many famous works, including Dickens’s Nicholas Nickleby, Jane Austen’s Sense and Sensibility, RD Blackmore’s Lorna Doone, Charles Kingsley’s The Water Babies, and a host of Agatha Christie murder mysteries.\n\nWild and windswept, Dartmoor soaks up the warmth of the setting sun.\n\nCathedrals, Abbeys, and Churches\n\nCompleted in around 1400 and dedicated to Saint Peter, Exeter Cathedral’s Decorated Gothic style replaced a much earlier Norman design, of which two massive towers remain.\n\nConstructed entirely of local stone, notable features include the multi-ribbed ceiling, the Great East Window containing 14th-century stained glass, and Britain’s earliest complete set of fifty misericords (wooden carvings on seats designed to fold up and act as support during standing prayer).\n\nExeter Cathedral has the longest uninterrupted vaulted ceiling in the world, at about 315 ft.\n\nBuckfast Abbey is an active Benedictine monastery that was refounded in 1882 after the previous 12th-century abbey was destroyed during King Henry VIII’s Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539.\n\nDedicated to the Anglo-Saxon princess Werburgh, the parish church at Wembury, in the hills above the beach, has commanding views across the South Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.\n\nThere are literally dozens of historically significant village churches to explore, many dating from Norman Britain.\n\nNamed after a Roman centurion who converted to Christianity, the parish church at Tavistock is a “wool church”—financed primarily by rich wool merchants and farmers during the Middle Ages, hoping their largesse would ensure a place in heaven.\n\nCastles and Country Houses\n\nPowderham Castle is a fortified manor house and home to the Courtenay family, Earls of Devon.\n\nThe appellation “castle” was added in the 17th century and although never a true castle with a keep and moat, it had a protective curtain wall and yard on the east side.\n\nFeaturing a mixture of medieval towers and fine 18th-century decoration, Powderham Castle is named from the ancient Dutch word “polder”, and means “the hamlet of the reclaimed marsh-land”.\n\nThe Staircase Hall has an impressive mahogany staircase decorated with carved heraldic beasts and intricate plasterwork.\n\nUsed as the filming location for the highly-rated 1983 version of Conan Doyle’s “The Hound of the Baskervilles”, Knightshayes Court is pure Victorian Gothic, complete with gargoyles, corbels, and a medieval-inspired great hall.\n\nRenowned architectural scholar Nikolaus Pevsner called it “an eloquent expression of High Victorian ideals in a country house”.\n\nDesigned by Scottish neoclassical architect Robert Adam, the beautiful Georgian mansion of Saltram House was described by architectural scholar Pevsner as “the most impressive country house in Devon”.\n\nConsidered one of Adam’s finest interiors, the sumptuous drawing room features Rococo plasterwork, exceptional paintings, luxurious Axminster carpets, and the finest damask upholstered Thomas Chippendale furniture.\n\nDevonshire Cream Tea\n\nDerived from Devon county, the term “Devonshire Cream Tea” refers to a light meal taken in the afternoon at around 4 pm, consisting of a pot of tea with scones, clotted cream, and jam.\n\nAnglo-Saxon texts from around the 8th century refer to “Defenascir”, meaning “Devonshire” after it changed from the Latin name “Dumnonia” following the fall of Roman rule in Britain.\n\nDevon and Cornwall have different ideas over how to eat scones with cream tea.\n\nDevonians prefer to add cream first followed by jam, whereas the Cornish way is to add the jam first.\n\nEither way, Devonshire Cream Tea remains one of the most popular snacks ordered at countless tea shops and cafes in the region and across Britain.\n\nDairy farming has been important to Devon for centuries, with the 11th-century monks at Tavistock Abbey known to have offered bread with cream and jam to local workers who helped rebuild the Abbey after it was attacked by Vikings in 997 AD.\n\nRelated post: 8 Surprising Facts About British Tea

southern England spanning the counties of Hampshire, Wiltshire, and parts of Dorset.\n\nA land of untamed beauty.\n\nOf pastures, heathland, and ancient woodland, dotted with delightful villages, churches, and country houses.\n\nJoin us as we explore the New Forest.\n\nHistory\n\nPrior to the Norman Invasion of England, the area was colonised by the Jutes from the Jutland Peninsula of what is now Denmark and Northern Germany.\n\nFollowing the Norman Conquest, King William I, commonly known as William the Conqueror, designated the land as a royal forest, reserved for the private use of the King and invited aristocracy.\n\nCreated at the expense of over 20 small hamlets and farms, it was a “new” area and the only forest described in detail in the ancient Domesday Book’s “Great Survey”.\n\nMysteriously, two of William the Conqueror’s sons died in hunting accidents in the New Forest.\n\nFolklore has it that the deaths were punishment for William evicting locals from his newly acquired lands.\n\nRichard of Normandy, his second son, died in around 1070, while his younger brother, William would suffer a similar fate 30 years later.\n\nStruck by an arrow from one of his own men while hunting in August of 1100, King William II of England died in suspicious circumstances, leading to speculation of murder.\n\nHistorian Frank Barlow described King William II as:\n\nA rumbustious, devil-may-care soldier, without natural dignity or social graces, with no cultivated tastes and little show of conventional religious piety or morality—indeed, according to his critics, addicted to every kind of vice, particularly lust and especially sodomy.\n\nMarking the spot where the king was shot, the “Rufus Stone” bears the following inscription:\n\nHere stood the oak tree, on which an arrow shot by Sir Walter Tyrrell at a stag, glanced and struck King William the Second, surnamed Rufus, on the breast, of which he instantly died, on the second day of August, anno 1100.\n\nWilliam’s brother Henry was among the hunting party that day and succeeded him as King.\n\nAbanding his brother’s body, he rode straight for Winchester—then the capital of England—to seize the treasury and elect himself King.\n\nRights of Common\n\nAncient “rights of common” have allowed local inhabitants to turn horses and cattle out into the forest’s common pasture to graze.\n\nBetween September and November, pigs can roam freely to forage for fallen acorns and beechnuts.\n\nNew Forest ponies are typically not shy and can be bold enough to seek out a treat.\n\nWildlife\n\nAbundant with diverse species of wildlife thanks to well-preserved lowland habitats—wetlands, heaths, and deciduous woodland—you’re sure to see some beautiful creatures including several deer populations, of which fallow deer is the most common, but also roe deer, red deer, sika deer, and muntjac.\n\nIf you’re lucky, you may see this fine bird of prey—the Northern Goshawk—before it sees you.\n\nAnd the pretty Dartford Warbler can be spotted flitting around the gorse.\n\nNew Forest National Park\n\nCovering about 120 square miles, the New Forest’s National Park and Site of Special Scientific Interest is the largest contiguous area of unsown vegetation in lowland Britain.\n\nVillages and Historical Buildings\n\nAs eclectic as it is beautiful, the New Forest district is filled with pretty villages and historical buildings yearning to be explored.\n\nFounded by King John in 1203, Beaulieu Abbey was occupied by 30 monks sent from the Cîteaux Abbey, the mother house of the Cistercian order.\n\nGranted a rich endowment and lands in the New Forest, Beaulieu Abbey became very wealthy, with a scale and magnificence befitting its royal foundation until it was dissolved by Henry VIII in 1538 and fell into ruin.\n\nOnce the gatehouse to Beaulieu Abbey, Palace House became the ancestral home of the Mantagu family when it was bought from the Crown following the dissolution of the abbey.\n\nExtended in the 16th and 19th centuries, it is a superb example of a Gothic country house and reputedly one of the most haunted places in Britain.\n\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle, the author of the Sherlock Holmes novels, conducted séances at Palace House and it is claimed he made contact with a ghost.\n\nReportedly sighted walking through walls and making a lot of noise in the private apartments, a lady in blue is believed to be the ghost of the Countess of Beaulieu, Lady Isabella, who died in 1786.\n\nFounded in 1952 by Edward Douglas-Scott-Montagu, 3rd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu, as a tribute to his father, who was one of the great British automobile pioneers, the National Motor Museum is hosted in the village of Beaulieu.\n\nFilled with around 250

Polperro, Cornwall\n\nTightly-packed ancient fisherman’s cottages, a quaint little harbour, and pristine coastline combine to make Polperro a well-loved tourist destination.\n\nThe name Polperro is derived from old Cornish “Porthpyra” meaning “harbour named after Saint Pyran”, a 5th-century Cornish abbot and patron saint of tin miners.\n\nRecognised as a fishing settlement as early as the 13th century, smuggling helped local fishermen boost their income from as early as the 1100s.\n\nHigh taxation of imports caused by Britain’s wars with France and America made it worthwhile for spirits, tobacco, and other goods to be smuggled from Guernsey and elsewhere.\n\n19th-century Coast Guards and the threat of stiff penalties eventually deterred the smugglers.\n\nTypical old fisherman’s cottages in Polperro had storage for fishing nets on the ground floor with steps leading to the living accommodation above.\n\nPolperro legends include the ghost of smuggler Willy Wilcox who disappeared whilst hiding in the beaches’ labyrinthine caves.\n\nThe Spirit of the Forest is said to come down from the woods above the village and leave sweetmeats at the homes of the poor during times of great economic hardship and foretells of good fortune for the recipients.\n\n10. Staithes, North Yorkshire\n\nOnce a thriving fishing village, Staithes is now a center for tourism within the North York Moors National Park.\n\nDerived from Old English, the name Staithes means “Landing Place”.\n\nStaithes has a sheltered harbour, bounded by high cliffs and two long breakwaters.\n\nMore than half of the houses are second homes of outsiders from cities such as Leeds and York.\n\nVillagers still practice local traditions, with many of the local women buying Staithes bonnets and local men singing in the Staithes Fisher Men’s Choir.\n\nIn the late 19th century, there were 80 full-time fishing boats putting out to sea from Staithes.\n\nNow there are a handful of part-time fishermen still plying their trade in traditional fishing vessels called cobles.\n\nStaithes’s most famous resident, James Cook worked as a grocer’s apprentice in 1745, beginning a lifelong passion for the sea.\n\nEveryone deserves a place to escape.\n\nAnd that’s exactly what Britain’s canals provide with their idyllic tranquility, natural beauty, and over two hundred years of history.\n\nWhether you’re boating, walking, cycling, or fishing, Britain’s canal network will delight and surprise at every turn.\n\nHere are 7 reasons to fall in love with Britain’s canals.\n\n1. The fascinating history\n\nAlthough the first canals were built by the Romans for irrigation and land drainage, the canal network we know and love today is largely a product of Britain’s industrial heritage.\n\nAs the epicenter of the Industrial Revolution, Britain needed a more efficient “mass transit” system to bring raw materials to factories and take finished goods to coastal ports for export.\n\nAnd so Britain became the first country to build a nationwide canal network.\n\nHorse-drawn narrowboats with a towpath alongside for the horse to walk along were standardized across the British canal network.\n\nBefore the canals, transport of goods was mainly via coastal shipping and horses & carts struggling along mostly unsurfaced mud roads.\n\nWhat do afternoon tea and canals have in common?\n\nIf you were running a pottery factory like Josiah Wedgwood (1730 – 1795), making fine china tea sets for export all over the world, the method you used for transporting such fragile and expensive goods was very important.\n\nGliding along the water had advantages over the jarring, bumpy ride of packhorses or horse drawn carts, not to mention the sheer weight of goods carried by barge making the economics much more favorable.\n\nUnsurprisingly then, the pottery manufacturers of Staffordshire were amongst the first promoters of canals.\n\nOften called the “Golden Age” of British canals, the period from 1770 – 1830 saw rapid industrialisation of the Midlands and the North of England.\n\nBut from about 1840, a new type of network was being built—one that threatened the canals and would lead to their eventual demise: the railways.\n\nFortunately, after a long period of neglect, Britain’s canals were renovated and returned to their former glory—this time as byways for leisure craft on lazy Sunday afternoons or as relaxing canal cruise vacations.\n\n2. The prettiest boats you ever saw\n\nEconomic and engineering constraints of the 18th century kept canals narrow, with many locks built to just 7 ft 6 in wide.\n\nThis narrow gauge limited the beam (width) of the boats, which became known as narrowboats.\n\nCompetition from the railways forced boat operators to live on board, converting the rear portion into ingenious tiny living spaces complete with hot stove, steaming kettle, brightly painted decorations, fancy lace, and polished brass.\n\nBy the late Victorian era, it was common to paint roses and castles on the narrow boats and their fixtures and fittings.\n\nTo this day, owners still personalize their narrowboats with their own unique touches.\n\n3. The freedom to move about the country\n\nNavigable in its entirety in a narrowboat of 7 ft wide by about 56 ft long is a network of some 2,200 miles of inland waterways just beckoning to be explored.\n\nNarrowboating transports us back to a time without road rage when travelling at 4 mph was considered hurried.\n\nOnce the highways of the 18th century, the canals are now corridors of green best enjoyed at a leisurely pace.\n\n4. The spellbinding Victorian ingenuity\n\nAs the Industrial Revolution took hold at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, the technology allowed canals to be improved.\n\nEarly canals contoured round hills and valleys, whereas later ones went straighter.\n\nLocks took canals up and down gradients, aqueducts spanned valleys, and tunnels went directly through hills.\n\nAt 1000 ft long, the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct on the Llangollen Canal spans the River Dee Valley in Wales and is Britain’s longest aqueduct.\n\nThe 18-arch stone and cast iron structure took ten years to build.\n\nOpening in 1805, it is the oldest and longest navigable aqueduct in Great Britain and the highest in the world.\n\nWith its 52-foot span, the Engine Arm Aqueduct near Smethwick in the West Midlands is much smaller, but its ornate cast-iron Gothic arches and columns make a splendid sight nonetheless.\n\nOver three miles long, the longest and deepest canal tunnel in Britain is the Standedge Tunnel on the Huddersfield Narrow Canal in Northern England.\n\nSince March 30th 2009, boats have been allowed to pass through Standedge Tunnel under their own power accompanied by a trained “chaperone” from the Canal & River Trust.\n\nBuilt without a towpath, before motorized boats the only way to get through the tunnel was by “legging” it.\n\nLying on a plank across the bows of the boat, and holding the plank with their hands, two people would propel the boat with their feet against the tunnel wall.\n\nIt was dangerous work, leading to many deaths for the “leggers” until safety was improved.\n\nThe horse would take a well-earned break and be led over the hill.\n\n5. The countryside and nature surround you\n\nBritain’s canal network passes through not only historic cities and pretty towns and villages, but also the magnificent open countryside.\n\nYou’re guaranteed to see some stunning wildlife on a daily basis in and around the canals.\n\nIf you don’t spot the brightly coloured Kingfisher perched on the canalside, you’ll almost certainly see one darting across the water as a characteristic “blue streak”.\n\nAnd you’re bound to see one of these guys—a Grey Heron—the patient fisherman, waiting motionless for the right moment to wade in the shallows and show us what a master angler can really do.\n\n6. The city’s never far away\n\nPassing along the Grand Union and Regent’s canals, to the Docklands and Limehouse Basin, the London Ring lets you travel around London by narrowboat through Little Venice, Regent’s Park, London Zoo, Camden Lock, Kings Cross, Islington and Victoria Park.\n\nBirmingham has more canals than Venice.\n\nExtending to just over 100 miles, the Birmingham Canal Navigations include two long tunnels and several aqueducts.\n\n7. There’s a vibrant community of enthusiasts\n\nEscape into the country for some much-needed peace and tranquility or socialize with the big network of canal enthusiasts—it’s up to you.\n\nBritain’s canal community is growing by leaps and bounds.\n\nAccording to the Residential Boat Owners Association, as many as 15,000 people call Britain’s waterways home.\n\nCiting freedom, economic advantages, a strong sense of community, and a closeness with nature as reasons for making their home on the water, many “liveaboards” can’t imagine returning to a life on land.\n\nIt was a sunny spring morning in 1802 as William Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy strolled along the banks of Ullswater in the English Lake District, Cumbria.\n\nInspired by the majesty of the moment, Wordsworth was about to change forever the way we view our relationship with the natural world.\n\nCaptured for eternity within the first stanza of his most famous poem, Daffodils, are the words that created a cultural movement.\n\nThousands would follow in Wordsworth’s footsteps to wander lonely as a cloud, beside the lake and beneath the trees.\n\nThe passions of men are incorporated with the beautiful and permanent forms of nature.William Wordsworth\n\nBreathtaking vistas, lush valleys, sunlit passes—every bend in the road is a fresh celebration of the natural splendour of the Lake District and a new photo opportunity.\n\nHere are 10 fascinating facts that may inspire you to visit this most beautiful corner of the British Isles.\n\n1. The Lake District took over 2 million years of glaciations to create\n\nForming a roughly circular upland massif with a radial pattern of deep valleys, the geological character of the Lake District has evolved through repeated glaciations over the last 2 million years.\n\nDisplaying the U-shaped cross-section typical of glacial erosion, the Lake District’s valleys often feature elongated lakes with relatively flat ground at their heads.\n\nSmaller lakes called “tarns” are found at the higher elevations.\n\n2. William Wordsworth and the Lake Poets inspired a love of nature\n\nNo part of the country is more distinguished by its sublimity.William Wordsworth\n\nBefore the 19th Century, the more remote areas of Britain such as the Lake District were viewed as dangerous.\n\nThrough poetry, Wordsworth helped changed forever the perceptions of mankind’s relationship with nature.\n\nPublishing his “Guide to Lakes” in 1810, William Wordsworth may have been completely unaware of the profound changes he was helping to bring about.\n\nFueling his vivid imagination, nature had always been important to Wordsworth.\n\nHe could see how “England’s green and pleasant land” and the working poor were being exploited by industrialists, and believed that a love of nature would lead naturally to a love of mankind.\n\nOther famous poets moved to live or spend time in the Lake District, becoming known collectively as the Lake Poets.\n\nWordsworth’s most famous work is a lyric poem called Daffodils.\n\nI wandered lonely as a cloud\n\nThat floats on high o’er vales and hills,\n\nWhen all at once I saw a crowd,\n\nA host of golden daffodils;\n\nBeside the lake, beneath the trees,\n\nFluttering and dancing in the breeze.\n\nWilliam Wordsworth\n\n3. The Lake District houses England’s highest peaks and deepest bodies of water\n\nFormed more than 450 million years ago, Scafell Pike in the Lake District is England’s highest mountain.\n\nOn a clear day you can see other peaks in Wales, Ireland, Scotland and the Isle of Man from the top of Scafell Pike.\n\nThe largest natural lake in England is also in the Lake District.\n\nWindermere is 11 miles long and has 18 islands dotted along its length—the largest of which is Belle Island, where Roman artifacts have been discovered.\n\nThe four highest mountains in England are all in the Lake District and exceed 3,000 feet (910 m):\n\nScafell Pike, 978 m (3,209 ft)\n\nScafell, 965 m (3,166 ft)\n\nHelvellyn, 951 m (3,120 ft)\n\nSkiddaw, 931 m (3,054 ft)\n\n4. The Lake District is the most visited National Park in the UK\n\nWith 16.4 million visitors a year, 24 million tourist days, and a yearly visitor spent of £1.2 billion, the Lake District is by far the most popular national park in the UK—almost twice as popular as the Yorkshire Dales.\n\nRegarded as one of the best places to eat in Britain, the Lake District has four Michelin Star restaurants: L’Enclume, The Samling in Ambleside, The Forest Side and Gilpin Hotel.\n\nCumbria has more microbreweries than any other county in Britain and together with Jennings Brewery supply a variety of superb English Ales to pubs and restaurants throughout the region.\n\nWith many buildings dating from the 17th century, Hawkshead has a timeless atmosphere, a warren of alleyways, overhanging gables, and medieval squares.\n\nBuilt in 1840 by a retired surgeon from Liverpool, Wray Castle is a Victorian neo-gothic building on the shores of Windermere and open to the public year round.\n\n5. The Lake District has only one “lake”\n\nOnly one of the lakes in the Lake District is called by that name, Bassenthwaite Lake.\n\nAll the others such as Windermere, Coniston Water, Ullswater and Buttermere are meres, tarns and waters, with mere being the least common and water being the most.\n\n6. The Lake District has the best preserved Roman fort in the UK\n\nEstablished in the second century AD under the reign of Emperor Hadrian, Hardknott Fort is the best preserved Roman Fort in the UK.\n\nGarrisoned here were a detachment of 500 cavalry of the 6th Cohort of Dalmatians from the Dalmatian coast in what is today a historical region mostly within the borders of Croatia.\n\nAbandoned in the late 130s AD, the small 3-acre fort became a temporary shelter for passing patrols and travellers.\n\n7. Cumbria is home to six times more sheep than people\n\nThe Lake District is populated by a huge number of sheep — over 3 million in the county of Cumbria.\n\nWhereas Cumbria has a population of close to 500,000, the Lake District itself has only about 45 people per square mile.\n\nKnown for being hardy and strong in tough weather conditions, the Herdwick breed thrives in the Lake District and is managed using traditional farming methods.\n\nAfter tourism, agriculture is the region’s largest source of income, and Herdwick sheep are a huge part of this.\n\nFarmers say the sheep are “heafed to the fell”, meaning that they can be safely left to wander the unfenced terrain.\n\nAble to withstand the most appalling weather in winter, the sheep help maintain the “Lake District look” by grazing heather and grass evenly and keeping bracken and scrub at bay.\n\n8. The Lake District is home to some of the rarest wildlife in Britain\n\nNative to the woodland areas of the Lake District is the beloved British Red Squirrel.\n\nNow an endangered species, the Lake District is one of the few remaining areas of Britain where Red Squirrels can still be found in the wild.\n\nThe Lake District National Park is also home to a large variety of other rare or protected species of wildlife including red deer, Peregrine falcons, barn owls, Natterjack toads and Britain’s only nesting pairs of Golden Eagles and Ospreys.\n\n9. Beatrix Potter lived in the Lake District\n\nCreated by the writer and illustrator, Beatrix Potter, Squirrel Nutkin is one of the most famous squirrels in the history of literature.\n\nInspired by much of the Lake District’s wildlife for her stories, Beatrix Potter’s most famous character was Peter Rabbit.\n\nFollowing the adventures of the mischievous and disobedient young Peter Rabbit, The Tale of Peter Rabbit is one of the best-selling books of all time.\n\nShe bought her house, Hill Top in the Lake District with the profits.\n\nNow a National Trust property, the house is open to the public and, as requested in her will, the interior has been “left as if she had just gone out to the post”: a fire burning in the hearth, cups and saucers on the table ready for a visitor.\n\n10. Steamboats and Steam trains\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, luxury steamboats were a familiar sight on Windermere’s 10.5 mile stretch of water.\n\nCommissioned by wealthy Victorian industrialists, the extravagant vessels were perfect for cruising on weekend retreats around the area.\n\nOutmoded by newer technology after World War I, most steamboats were broken up as newer technology replaced them.\n\nBut you can still experience a ride on a few remaining steamboats that are converted to diesel and enjoy the collection of restored boats at the Windermere Steamboat Museum.\n\nThe Lakeside and Haverthwaite Railway is a heritage steam railway that runs from Haverthwaite via Newby Bridge to Lakeside at the southern end of Windermere.\n\nSeveral services are timed to connect with sailings of the steamers on Windermere,.\n\nJust beyond the rear windows, in gardens across the British nation, something amazing happens every winter.\n\nLittle flashes of colour dart and dance from fencepost to footpath, from gazebo to greenhouse, from treetop to trellis.\n\nThese are the garden birds that come foraging for food at this time of year.\n\nFor many British people, garden birds provide an almost constant source of delight.\n\nEvery time we enter the kitchen to put the kettle on and gaze into the garden, there’s usually something going on.\n\nWith their distinctive plumage and daredevil acrobatics, garden birds give a theatrical performance as they flit and flirt across the stage.\n\nMany are fairly tame and quite used to living alongside human beings in the gardens, parks, and green spaces of Britain.\n\nIn recent years, there’s been a growing interest in garden bird feeding.\n\nBird tables and bird feeders stocked with nutritious, high-energy food are a magnet for the prettiest feathered friends you ever saw.\n\nHere are 10 garden birds that you can expect to see in a British garden.\n\nBlue Tit\n\nFamed for their skill, as they cling to the outermost branches and hang upside down like gymnasts, blue tits are tiny blue and yellow birds with a dark blue line passing through the eye and puffy white cheeks, giving a very distinctive appearance.\n\nTheir nape, wings, and tail are blue while their back is green.\n\nBlue tits are so adapted to life among humans that in the days of doorstep milk deliveries, they would peck through the foil lids of milk bottles and enjoy the cream beneath.\n\nBullfinch\n\nBull-headed and bulky, adult male bullfinches wear a black cap and striking rose-red breastplate, while females wear a more demure grey-buff attire.\n\nWith their large black bill, white rump and wing bars, they are striking when in flight.\n\nNot as common a sight as the blue tit, so a special treat if you see one.\n\nGoldfinch\n\nOften depicted in Italian renaissance paintings of Madonna and Child, Goldfinches have a red, white, and black face and an eye-catching yellow bar on black wings.\n\nIt was thought that since goldfinches eat thistle seeds, and thistles are Christian symbols of Christ’s Passion and crown of thorns, they were sacred birds and a good-luck charm.\n\nDuring the 19th century, many thousands of goldfinches were sold as cage-birds, the prevention of which was one of the earliest campaigns of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.\n\nGreat Spotted Woodpecker\n\nFrom an ancient bird family, great spotted woodpeckers are almost unmistakable with their glossy black and white plumage in a zig-zag arrangement.\n\nDressed to impress, their large white shoulder patches, white bars on wings and tail feathers, and bright crimson on nape and under tail complete the ensemble.\n\nAlighting on a tree trunk, watch as they work upwards, from side to side, using the stiff tail as an additional support.\n\nGreat Tit\n\nAnother distinctive small bird with black head and neck, white cheeks, yellow underparts and olive back.\n\nPopular to watch for their acrobatic performances when feeding on nuts and seeds, great tits are also most likely to inhabit nest boxes.\n\nIntelligent birds, great tits have been observed using conifer needles as tools to help extract food from difficult to reach crevices.\n\nJay\n\nColorful and noisy, jays are the bullies of the garden playground.\n\nMostly pinkish brown with lighter underparts, they have a black moustache and black and white flecked crown that can be raised to a crest for display or when alarmed.\n\nLike magpies, jays tend to visit gardens in pairs and learn through observation—such as watching how smaller birds extract peanuts from feeders before trying it themselves.\n\nLong-Tailed Tit\n\nTiny round bodies, with diminutive bills and very long tails distinguish these adorable pinkish birds with their black markings above the eyes and into the nape and black wings.\n\nIncredibly agile, long-tailed tits can get to food in hard to reach places.\n\nOften seen in flocks, they huddle together at night to keep warm.\n\nRedwing\n\nRelated to the song thrush, the smaller redwing has a creamy strip above the eye and distinctive orange-red patches on their sides from which they derive their name.\n\nRoaming Britain’s fields and hedgerows in large flocks, redwings are not as common a sighting as other garden birds, only visiting gardens when it gets really cold and snow covers the fields.\n\nIn flight the red patches under the wings are noticeable even at a distance.\n\nRobin\n\nOften viewed as Britain’s national bird and seen gracing many a seasonal greeting card, the robin is a plump little bird with bright orange-red plumage covering breast, face and throat.\n\nIn the fifteenth century, when people gave human names to familiar birds, it was known as robin redbreast, eventually shortened to robin.\n\nUnafraid of people, robins are drawn to human activities, making them cheerful companions for gardeners.\n\nYellowhammer\n\nThought to have inspired poems by Robert Burns and influenced Beethoven’s 5th symphony, this conspicuous yellow sparrow-sized bird has a melodious song popularized by Enid Blyton as sounding like “little bit of bread and no cheese”.\n\nMale yellowhammers have a bright yellow head and underparts, heavily streaked brown back, and whitish outer tail feathers.\n\nA rarer sighting than other garden birds, corn and seed are most likely to attract them into the garden in winter when natural food is scarce.\n\nSuch is the beauty of the Yorkshire Dales that as you traverse its rolling hills with pretty dry-stone walls, discover its delightful villages, with tearooms and bookshops, and gasp in awe at its breathtaking valleys, you may be forgiven for thinking this is God’s own country.\n\nWhether by car, bicycle or on foot, the Yorkshire Dales will surprise and delight at every turn.\n\nJoin us, dear reader, as we explore 10 fun facts about the Yorkshire Dales.\n\n1. The Yorkshire Dales are named after their rivers\n\nShaped by glaciers in the last ice age, the Yorkshire Dales are river valleys named after their river or stream.\n\nRiver valleys all over Yorkshire are called “(name of river)+dale”—but only the upper, more rural valleys are included in the term “The Yorkshire Dales”.\n\nThe word “dale” means valley and is derived from the 12th-century Old English word dael. It is used in Scotland and northern England, and is related to the Welsh word dôl and the German word tal.\n\nMore general use of the word “dale” was superseded in the 14th century by the word “valley’ from Anglo-French valee.\n\n2. The Dales has several amazing Limestone Rock formations including deep caves\n\nFound in previously glaciated limestone environments, limestone pavements are flat areas of limestone with deep surface patterning resembling paving stones.\n\nThe underlying limestone has eroded to form vast caves in several areas. Gaping Gill is a 322 ft deep shaft that is the largest underground chamber open to the surface in England. The volume has been calculated to equal that of York Minster.\n\n3. Massive, graceful edifices to Victorian ingenuity allow the railways to cross the Dales\n\nWhen the Victorians wanted to cross the Yorkshire Dales by rail in the 1870s, this was their answer—Ribblehead Viaduct.\n\nUndaunted by the undulations of the dales, the Ribblehead Viaduct traverses a 440-yard span with a height of 104 ft above the valley floor.\n\nIt took 1000 navvies to build, 100 of whom died during construction either from accidents or outbreaks of smallpox.\n\nThe term ‘navvy” derives from Navigational Engineer and means a manual laborer for a major civil engineering project.\n\nThese workers built their own shanty towns close to the viaduct, naming them after Crimean War (1853-1856) victories and biblical names.\n\nThe TV series “Jericho” is a period drama based on the building of the Ribblehead Viaduct.\n\nAs graceful a sight as Ribblehead is, anyone familiar with large-scale engineering projects will appreciate just how daunting this must have been for the Victorians—and will see it in a different light.\n\n24 arches, each spanning 45 feet, with foundations sunk 25 feet into the valley required 1.5 million bricks and some limestone blocks weighing 8 tons each.\n\nConsidered to be the most beautiful and spectacular railway journey in England, the Settle to Carlisle Railway crosses the Ribblehead Viaduct with its incredible views of the Dales.\n\n4. Dry stone walls wind their way across the rolling hills\n\nDry stone walls are as common as sheep and give the Yorkshire Dales its delightful appearance—weaving their way across the rolling hills in all directions.\n\nWith no mortar to help bind them, it is the interlocking compressional forces that give the walls their structural integrity.\n\nConstruction of dry stone walls requires considerable skill, with experienced wallers few in number. Large, flat stones are used at the base, diminishing is size as the wall rises.\n\nTo help prevent the wall simply breaking apart, long tie stones are placed periodically which span both faces of the wall. Similarly, long capstones finish the final layer and provide rigidity.\n\n5. Wensleydale is named after the small market town that originally produced the delicious, crumbly Wensleydale cheese\n\nWensleydale is an exception to the way most dales are named after their rivers. It is named after the small market town that originally produced the delicious, crumbly cheese.\n\nFrench Cistercian monks from the Roquefort region of France who settled in Wensleydale brought with them a recipe for making cheese from sheep’s milk. Cow’s milk has been used since the 14th century.\n\nAfter the monasteries were dissolved by Henry VIII in 1540, local farmers continued making the cheese up until World War II when milk was used to make “Government Cheddar” as part of the rationing of the war effort.\n\nWensleydale with cranberries is popular in restaurants and delicatessens and there is a Yorkshire saying:\n\n6. Mary Queen of Scots once stayed at Bolton Castle\n\nThe 14th-century Bolton Castle is a notable local historic site near Wensleydale.\n\nFamous for serving as a prison for Mary, Queen of Scots, a story tells of how she escaped and lost her shawl on the way to Leyburn, hence the name “The Shawl”—a cliff edge that runs westward out of Leyburn, known for easy walks with excellent views.\n\n7. Bolton Abbey has a rich past—and rich owners too\n\nBuilt in the 12th century as an Augustinian monastery, Bolton Abbey sits on the banks of the River Wharf on a 133,000-acre estate in Wharfedale.\n\nOwned by the Cavendish Family (better known for the peerage titles Duke and Duchess of Devonshire who also own Chatsworth House), the estate has 8 miles of river, 84 farms, 88 historic buildings, and 27 businesses—including tearooms and bookshops.\n\n8. The Yorkshire Dales has a long history in lead mining\n\nMining for lead was a major industry in the Yorkshire Dales from the mid-17th century until about 1900, with Britain the world’s leader in lead production.\n\nGeological processes make the rocks of the dales rich in lead, but although landowners struck a bargain with miners to prospect for lead and share in the profits, few miners saw any wealth.\n\nIt was hard manual labor with picks and shovels in dirty and dangerous situations.\n\nToday, the remnants of a once thriving lead mining industry scar the landscape and can be explored.\n\n9. Beautiful waterfalls grace the Dales landscape\n\nThe Yorkshire Dales has several beautiful waterfalls, most notably Aysgarth Falls in Wensleydale, which is spectacular after heavy rainfall as thousands of gallons of water cascade over several levels of limestone steps.\n\nOriginating from old Norse, the name Aysgarth means an open space in the oak trees.\n\nFeatured in the 1991 movie Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, the falls have attracted artists and poets—Turner, Ruskin, Wordsworth—for over 200 years.\n\n10. Medieval farms, sheep, and a good vet\n\nMedieval farmsteads are dotted across the Yorkshire Dales.\n\nWith herds of sheep and cattle a common sight, a good veterinary surgeon has long been a valued member of the Dales community.\n\nA major TV series based on the writings of Alf Wight, a Yorkshire veterinary surgeon who wrote under the pseudonym James Herriot, was filmed largely in the Yorkshire Dales.\n\nThe books are a great read for anyone who wants to know more about Yorkshire country life, along with its characters and their inter-relationship with the farm animals of the Yorkshire Dales.\n\nThe sheep love James Herriot—just ask one."
