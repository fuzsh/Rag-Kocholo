The suits apparently wanted to have their cake and eat it to: a torn-from-the-headlines political story without any actual politics.\n\nChaney and Leatrice Joy do what they can with the material and it’s definitely worth watching for fans but its somewhat wimpy approach to the material does not do it any favors. Nor does Lon Chaney’s hair.\n\nHow does it end? Hover or tap below for a spoiler.\n\nChaney blows up the rest of the secret society so that Joy can escape with her true love.\n\nRead my full-length review here.\n\nIf it were a dessert it would be: Cake Mix Biscotti. Definitely a compromise but I wouldn’t say no to it."
