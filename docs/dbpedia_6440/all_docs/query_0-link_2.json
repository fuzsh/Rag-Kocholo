Like enough, we could meet them man for man (if we chose all around the crown and the skirts of Exmoor), and show them what a cross-buttock means, because we are so stuggy; but in regard of stature, comeliness, and bearing, no woman would look twice at us. Not but what I myself, John Ridd, and one or two I know of - but it becomes me best not to talk of that, although my hair is gray.' ***'Perhaps their den might well have been stormed, and themselves driven out of the forest, if honest people had only agreed to begin with them at once when first they took to plundering. But having respect for their good birth, and pity for their misfortunes, and perhaps a little admiration at the justice of God, that robbed men who were now robbers, the squires and farmers and shepherds at first did nothing more than grumble gently, or even make a laugh of it, each in the case of others. After a while they found the matter gone too far for laughter, as violence and deadly outrage stained the hand of robbery, until every woman clutched her child, and every man turned pale at the very name of \"Doone\".' [Quotes from Chapter V: An Illegal Settlement] ***An antiquarian, circa 1890 edition - a complete set of two volumes illustrated with tissue-guarded captioned, red-titled fine photographic illustrations throughout, some by Francis Frith & Co.
