However, recent work has demonstrated the critical importance of tissue-specific C3 expression in cell survival. Here, we analyzed the effects of local versus peripheral sources of C3 expression in a model of acute bacterial pneumonia induced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. While mice with global C3 deficiency had severe pneumonia-induced lung injury, those deficient only in liver-derived C3 remained protected, comparable to wild-type mice. Human lung transcriptome analysis showed that secretory epithelial cells, such as club cells, express high levels of C3 mRNA. Mice with tamoxifen-induced C3 gene ablation from club cells in the lung had worse pulmonary injury compared to similarly treated controls, despite maintaining normal circulating C3 levels. Finally, in both the mouse pneumonia model and cultured primary human airway epithelial cells, we showed that stress-induced death associated with C3 deficiency parallels that seen in Factor B deficiency, rather than C3a receptor deficiency. Moreover, C3-mediated reduction in epithelial cell death requires alternative pathway component Factor B. Thus, our findings suggest that a pathway reliant on locally-derived C3 and Factor B protects the lung mucosal barrier.\n\nOne Sentence Summary:\n\nLung-derived C3 mitigates bacterial pneumonia suggesting a cytoprotective role at barrier surfaces independent of circulating C3.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nPathogens infect and injure mucosal surfaces, resulting in a cascade of events including inflammation, tissue damage, and systemic dissemination (1, 2). In the lung, this process results in severe pneumonia, a leading cause of human death even before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (3, 4). The outcome of pneumonia is determined by a balance between immune resistance and tissue resilience (1, 5). Immune resistance is the host’s ability to eradicate pathogens, whereas tissue resilience is the ability of the lung to withstand the deleterious consequences of infection and inflammation (1, 5). The complement system is a family of immune proteins that facilitate immune resistance by attacking microbes to decrease pathogen burden (6, 7). The cascade can be activated by multiple arms such as the classical, lectin, or alternative pathway, and each of them play important roles in host defense (8, 9). Genetic and acquired deficiencies of complement consequently lead to recurrent bacterial infections in both children and adults (10, 11). Recently there has been an increasing appreciation of how the system functions to promote tissue resilience in the setting of acute infections (12, 13).\n\nA majority of complement proteins are liver-derived (14). One such protein, C3, is a central component of the complement system, as multiple pathways converge on its activation to C3a and C3b, thereby amplifying the cascade (15). C3a promotes host defense by binding to its cognate receptor, C3aR, while C3b binds to Factor B and modulates outcomes of bacterial infection via the alternative pathway (9). The normal plasma concentration of C3 is 1–2 g/L in humans, making it one of the most common proteins in the circulation after other liver-derived proteins such as albumin and α−2-macroglobulin (16). Thus, the protective effects of C3 have largely been attributed to it being sourced from the liver and present in a high concentration in the circulation. However, we and others have previously demonstrated that C3 is also produced outside of the liver by multiple immune and non-immune cell populations (17–22). This observation has implications, especially for organs that constantly interact with pathogens and environmental toxins, such as the lung (6, 23). For example, we have demonstrated that C3 synthesized and internalized by lung epithelial cells protects against stress-induced cell death (18, 24). Others have demonstrated that chronic C3 upregulation in lung epithelial cells can perpetuate inflammation in SARS-CoV-2 infection (21).\n\nIt is unknown whether cell-intrinsic C3 production is relevant in vivo. It is also unclear if the protective effects of C3 are purely a result of enhancing immune resistance via its bactericidal activity, or it also contributes to tissue resilience by reducing acute lung injury (ALI). To address these questions, we utilized a model of acute Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) pneumonia in mice globally deficient in C3 and report that C3 not only promotes immune resistance but also enhances tissue resilience in vivo by mitigating ALI. Using publicly available human lung datasets and a C3 reporter mouse model, we established that multiple cell types in the lung produce and upregulate C3 in the setting of Pa infection. Building on these findings, we generated mouse strains and showed that lung epithelial cell-derived C3 is functioning locally, independent of circulating (i.e., liver-derived) C3 and is necessary for reducing Pa-induced ALI. Using both human in vitro and mouse in vivo infection models, we showed that cell-intrinsic Factor B—a component of the alternative pathway and a ligand for C3—is a key component of tissue resilience, enhancing the ability of the lung to withstand the deleterious consequences of infection and inflammation. Our findings potentially refine the approach for therapeutically targeting the complement system in the lung with the goal of mitigating bacterial pneumonia severity.\n\nRESULTS\n\nC3 protects against severe bacterial pneumonia\n\nC3-deficient mice had histological evidence of increased lung injury when compared to wild-type (WT) mice 24 h after Pa infection ( ). Physiological function was impaired, as demonstrated by reduced dynamic compliance ( ) and higher airway resistance compared to WT (Fig. S1A), both measured by whole body plethysmography 24 h post-infection. Lung wet-dry ratios showed that C3-deficient mice had increased alveolar capillary-barrier permeability (Fig. S1B). We next analyzed inflammatory gene expression. C3-deficient mice had an exaggerated inflammatory response, as determined by increased lung Ccl2 and Il1b expression ( ), the proportion of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) Ly6Chi monocytes (Fig. S1C) and BAL CCL2 and IL-1β levels (Fig. S1D and ). The BAL levels of IL-6 and TNF-α showed a trend towards significance in C3-deficient mice compared to WT mice (Fig. S1F and S1G). Of note, infected C3-deficient mice had lower expression of epithelial cell genes Scgb1a1 (representing secretory airway epithelial cells) and Sftpc (representing alveolar epithelial cells) compared to infected WT, suggesting that C3 protects against epithelial cell loss ( ). However, C3-deficient mice also had higher lung ( ) and splenic bacterial counts ( ) at 24 h post-Pa infection.\n\nOne explanation for increased lung injury in C3-deficient mice is damage induced by actively proliferating bacteria. To this end, heat-killed Pa (HKPa) were administered intratracheally into both C3-deficient and WT mice, and lungs and BAL were harvested 24 h later. Compared to WT, C3-deficient mice still retained more histologic evidence of lung injury ( and ), characterized by an increase in alveolar (Fig. S1H) and interstitial neutrophilia (Fig. S1I), and septal thickening (Fig. SJ). HKPa-treated C3-deficient mice also had increased alveolar capillary-barrier permeability ( ), increased total BAL cell count ( ) and increased lung Ccl2 and Il1b expression ( ). Of note, C3-deficient mice treated with HKPa had a lower proportion of lung epithelial cells ( ), as well as lower expression of Scgb1a1 and Sftpc compared to WT mice treated with HKPa ( ). These observations suggest increased epithelial cell loss post-infection in the setting of C3-deficiency, independent of bacterial load.\n\nC3 in the lungs is sourced locally\n\nC3 increases in the BAL of both mice and humans following lung injury (25). To determine if this C3 is functional, we adapted our previously established in vitro complement assay, which considers both the activation (using LPS) and the function of the complement cascade (26–28). Functional complement activity in the serum of WT mice was intact prior to and following 24 h post-Pa infection ( ). In comparison to serum, functional complement activity in the BAL of WT mice was upregulated several thousand-fold at 24 h post-Pa infection compared to BAL levels in uninfected mice ( ). These observations would suggest that functional complement activity is rapidly induced in an organ with low baseline activity in the first 24 h post infection. To determine the contribution of circulating C3 to that in the BAL, we administered normal mouse serum (NMS, obtained from WT mice) intraperitoneally to C3-deficient mice after intratracheal instillation of Pa (to induce injury) or PBS (control). NMS was given either immediately after the Pa infection and the mice were followed for 24 h prior to euthanasia, or it was given 1 h prior to euthanasia, by which time the Pa-induced injury had already occurred. C3 was detected in the BAL at 24 h after NMS administration only in the C3-deficient mice administered NMS who had alveolar-capillary barrier disruption in the setting of Pa pneumonia, not in those who had only received intratracheal PBS. ( ). However, C3 was not detected in the BAL at 1 h post NMS administration even if the lungs had been injured by Pa, despite being detected in the circulation. These observations suggest that following disruption of the alveolar-capillary barrier, circulating C3 entry into the alveolar space is delayed relative to local C3 secretion. Of note, splenic bacterial dissemination and weight loss were lower in mice administered NMS compared to C3-deficient serum (Fig. S2A & B). However, epithelial cell death, as measured by the decrease in the club cell ratio in vivo, was similar between the two groups (Fig. S2C).\n\nTo quantify C3 expression and production by different cell types, we utilized C3 reporter mice with an IRES (internal ribosome entry side)-tdTomato cassette after the stop signal in the endogenous murine C3 locus, with exons 37–41 sequence flanked by loxP sites enabling its conditional deletion upon the action of a Cre recombinase (17). Given that the liver is the major source of circulating C3, we bred these mice to generate an in vivo model of C3 deficiency restricted to the liver (C3f/f; Alb-Cre+/−) ( ). We confirmed these mice had no expression of C3 in the liver ( ) and undetectable levels of circulating C3 compared to littermate controls and WT mice both pre and post Pa ( ). Although C3 was undetectable in the BAL prior to infection in the C3f/f; Alb-Cre+/− mice, it increased at 24 h post-Pa infection, suggesting locally sourced C3 ( ). This increase was lower than what was observed in littermate controls.\n\nAlthough there was no functional complement activity in the circulation of the C3f/f; Alb-Cre+/− mice as compared to their littermate controls prior to infection ( ), complement from BAL in C3f/f; Alb-Cre+/− mice was still functional ( ). Post-infection, there was no increase in functional complement activity in the circulation of C3f/f; Alb-Cre+/− mice as compared to pre-infection levels ( ). In comparison, functional complement activity in the BAL increased at 24 h post-infection in C3f/f; Alb-Cre+/− mice ( ). Taken together, these observations suggest that although circulating C3 is functional in the lung in the setting of an acute infection, extrahepatic sources of C3 also contribute to C3 function in the lung.\n\nGiven the lack of both detectable circulating C3 in the C3f/f; Alb-Cre+/− mice nor any functional complement activity in the serum, we hypothesized that functional complement activity in the BAL of C3f/f; Alb-Cre+/− mice was generated from the lung. The presence of a functional extrahepatic source of C3 was corroborated by lower splenic dissemination of bacteria in C3f/f; Alb-Cre+/− mice as compared to global C3-deficient mice ( ). Moreover, there was no difference in lung wet-dry ratio ( ), BAL cell count ( ) or histological evidence of injury (Fig. S2D) in mice deficient in liver-derived C3 as compared to littermate controls at 24 h post-Pa infection, although all these features of lung injury were increased in global C3-deficient mice. These observations suggest lung epithelial cell-derived C3 plays a key role in mitigating bacterial pneumonia-induced lung injury. No differences were observed in BAL cytokine levels in mice deficient in liver-derived C3 as compared to their littermate controls at 24 h post-Pa infection (Fig. S2E–H).\n\nNon-immune cells contribute to C3 in the lung\n\nTo evaluate sources of C3 in the normal human lung, we analyzed public single-cell RNA-seq datasets from the Lung Gene Expression Atlas and LungMAP (29–32). Our analysis showed that although most cells express C3 transcripts, major sources of C3 in the lungs are epithelial cells, fibroblasts and, to a lesser extent, monocytes/macrophages ( and S3A). To identify cell-intrinsic production of C3 in the lungs in the absence of circulating C3, we profiled C3 producing non-immune cells in the Pa-infected liver-deficient C3 reporter mice (C3f/f; Alb-Cre+/−) described earlier. In these mice, C3 increased by approximately 3-fold in airway epithelial cells and Type 1 alveolar epithelial cells, and increased by nearly 4-fold from baseline in Type 2 alveolar epithelial cells, fibroblasts and endothelial cells at 24 h post-Pa infection ( and S3B). We have previously shown that lung epithelial cells expressing SCGB1A1 (i.e., CCSP) are a major source of C3 in humans, especially in diseases associated with recurrent infections such as cystic fibrosis (18), and we were interested in how C3 from cells at the mucosal barrier surface affect the host response to pneumonia. Hence, we generated C3f/f; Scgb1a1-CreERT2+/− mice to specifically delete C3 produced by lung epithelial cells (club cell deficient-C3 mice); which are hereafter referred to as mice deficient in lung epithelial cell-derived C3 ( and S3C). Successful deletion of C3 from club cells was confirmed using immunofluorescence for C3 and Cyp2f2, a club cell marker ( ) (33–35). These mice deficient in lung epithelial cell-derived C3 had similar levels of C3 in their circulation and BAL as their littermate controls ( and ). They also had similar serum and BAL functional complement activity compared to their littermate controls ( and ).\n\nEpithelial (club) cell-derived C3 protects against severe bacterial pneumonia.\n\nC3f/f; Scgb1a1-CreERT2+/− mice had more acute lung injury after Pa infection than their littermate controls, as represented by measures of alveolar-capillary barrier disruption ( and ). They also had more severe histology ( ) and an exaggerated inflammatory response as seen by increased BAL cytokine levels of IL-1β, IL-6, KC and TNF-α ( – ). Additionally, mice deficient in lung epithelial cell-derived C3 demonstrated increased epithelial cell injury compared to littermate controls, indicated by a marked increase in BAL RAGE levels ( ), as well as increased epithelial cell death, as represented in the fluid phase by an increase in BAL cytokeratin-18 (CK-18) levels ( ), and in situ by a decreased club cell ratio on lung histopathology ( ) (36–38). A similar pattern of lung injury was seen in the intratracheal heat-killed Pa model, where mice deficient in lung epithelial cell-derived C3 had increased measures of alveolar-capillary barrier disruption ( ), epithelial cell loss ( ) and a decreased club cell ratio in situ ( and S3D). These findings suggest that lung epithelial cell-derived C3 reduces Pa-induced lung injury despite adequate circulating (i.e., liver-derived) C3 levels.\n\nComplement Factor B (FB) protects against stress-induced epithelial injury in vivo.\n\nUpon activation, C3 is cleaved to form C3a, which binds to the C3a receptor (C3aR), and C3b fragments, which can opsonize targets but also binds Factor B (FB) to form a C3 convertase (C3bBb) and amplify the alternative pathway of the complement cascade (39). To assess which of these putative targets may be facilitating the protective effects of C3 in the lung, we infected global C3aR-deficient (C3aR−/−) and FB-deficient (Cfb−/−) mice. C3aR-deficient mice were relatively protected from Pa-induced ALI and had a pattern of injury that was similar to the WT mice ( and ). In comparison, FB-deficient mice had more severe injury ( ). Increased lung stiffness (as demonstrated by decreased dynamic compliance) was observed at 24 h post-infection in Factor B-deficient mice compared to WT mice at higher doses of methacholine. (Fig. S4A). In comparison, there was no significant difference in lung stiffness in C3aR-deficient mice compared to WT mice at higher doses of methacholine (Fig. S4A). There was increased alveolar-capillary barrier disruption post-infection as evidenced by an increased lung wet-dry ratio in FB-deficient mice compared to WT and C3aR-deficient mice ( ). FB-deficient mice had increased inflammation post-infection, as measured by Il1b ( ) and Ccl2 (Fig. S4B) expression, and increased number of Ly6Chi monocytes in the lungs of FB-deficient mice compared to WT mice (Fig. S4C). FB-deficient mice also had increased epithelial cell loss, measured by lung Scgb1a1 ( ), Sftpc (Fig. S4D) and Cdh1 (Fig. S4E) expression, and increased epithelial cell death compared to WT mice as measured by BAL CK-18 levels (Fig. S4F) and confirmed using amine dye exclusion on flow cytometry (Fig. S4G).\n\nA similar pattern of increased lung injury in the setting of FB deficiency was observed after HKPa administration. FB-deficient mice given HKPa had increased lung injury on histology ( & ), as well as an increased wet-dry ratio as compared to WT mice ( ). These mice also had significantly higher expression of Il1b ( ) and Ccl2 (Fig. S4H) in their lungs, which paralleled our findings in C3-deficiency. Importantly, FB-deficient mice had decreased Scgb1a1 ( ), Sftpc (Fig. S4I) and Cdh1 (Fig. S4J) expression in their lungs after HKPa administration as compared to WT mice, suggesting epithelial cell loss in the setting of injury. To determine if epithelial cell death in C3- and FB-deficiency precedes immune cell infiltration, we performed flow cytometric analysis on the lungs at earlier time points. Epithelial cell death was increased in C3-deficient and FB-deficient mice at the 16 h time point compared to WT mice, prior to differences in immune cell infiltration ( – and Fig. S4K–L). This observation supports the hypothesis that C3 and FB protect lung epithelial cells during an acute pneumonic insult in vivo.\n\nIntracellular complement Factor B (FB) is upregulated in airway epithelial cells during Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.\n\nGiven that Pa induces a bronchopneumonia, we sought to model these interactions between C3, C3aR and FB in primary human airway epithelial cells. We previously reported that C3 increases in primary human tracheobronchial epithelial cells (hTECs) with stress (18). In hTECs infected with Pa, C3 and FB biosynthesis—as well as secretion—increased post-infection but levels of C3aR remained unchanged ( ). This increase in FB was primarily observed in cytoplasmic and membrane subcellular fractions ( ). C3 colocalized with intracellular FB stores during acute Pa infection, but colocalization with the C3aR was not observed ( ). The increase in intracellular FB stores in primary human tracheobronchial epithelial cells paralleled what was observed in the lungs of mice deficient in club cell-derived C3 in the setting of Pa-induced injury. Specifically, we saw an increase in intracellular FB stores in vivo at 24 h post-HKPa infection in the club cells of these mice ( ). Hence, we subsequently characterized the consequences of FB-deficiency in vitro in human lung epithelial cells using CRISPR-Cas9 deletion (Fig. S5A) compared to C3aR-deficiency (Fig. S5B). We first used a model of oxidative stress based on our prior work (18) to avoid any effects of bacterial proliferation or toxin production. In an in vitro model of H2O2-induced stress, FB deficiency was associated with increased cell death compared to parent clones over time (Fig. S5C). By comparison, C3aR-deficiency was protective against H2O2-induced cell death, especially within the first 24 h (Fig. S5D).\n\nComplement Factor B (FB) protects against stress-induced epithelial injury in vitro.\n\nRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of Pa-infected FB-deficient cells and their infected FB-sufficient parental clones ( ) utilizing COMPBIO, an ontology-free analysis approach ( ), identified cell death as a major (central) theme. ‘Cell death’ shared common biology with two other themes - ‘autocrine-paracrine signaling’ and ‘extracellular matrix (ECM) proteoglycans’ ( ), all of which were present in the top five enriched themes in the analysis between FB-deficient cells and their parent clones ( and Fig. S6). These three themes shared a common signature consisting of 18 genes, and their contributions are highlighted in the pseudo heatmap ( ). FB deficiency was associated with increased programmed cell death, evident by increased cleaved caspase-8, caspase-3 and cleaved PARP levels post-Pa infection ( ) and was paralleled by similar changes in the setting of oxidative stress ( ). While FB deficiency was associated with an increased intracellular bacterial burden ( ), phosphorylated Akt levels were decreased ( ), suggesting a putative mechanism for the increased cell death seen in FB deficiency. These findings suggest that intracellular FB facilitates lung epithelial cell survival under stress by mitigating programmed cell death.\n\nThe cytoprotective effect of Factor B (FB) under stress parallels that of C3.\n\nTo compare the protective effects of FB in the context of the protective effects of C3, we conducted live-cell cytotoxicity assays over time. Both C3- and FB-deficient cells demonstrated decreased viability over time compared to their common parent clones (termed ‘wild-type’ (WT), which are C3- and FB-sufficient) in the settings of Pa infection ( ) and oxidative stress ( ). Similar to what was observed in FB deficiency, C3 deficiency resulted in lower phosphorylated Akt and increased programmed cell death over time, evident by increased cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP levels post-Pa infection ( ). To address whether epithelial cell-derived C3 is acting extracellularly or intracellularly, we blocked C3 secretion in FB-sufficient and FB-deficient cells using increasing doses of a protein transport inhibitor ( – ). C3 and its cleavage products decreased in the supernatant, and correspondingly increased within the cell ( ). Inhibition of C3 secretion decreased Pa-induced cell death in FB-sufficient cells, as evidenced by decreased cleaved PARP levels over time ( ). This protection was abolished in FB-deficient cells ( ), suggesting the necessity of FB for the cytoprotective effects of C3 in airway epithelium.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe effects of the complement system have historically been attributed to its presence in the circulation. However, our understanding of individual complement components being synthesized by tissues and extrahepatic organs has evolved to recognize that cells at mucosal surfaces may have an intrinsic complement system for host defense (40–44). Leveraging advances in complement biology, model systems and technologies, we demonstrate that: (1) C3 protects against acute bacterial pneumonia-induced lung injury; (2) C3 can be sourced locally, independent of that derived from the liver and present in the circulation; (3) structural cells of the lung such as epithelial cells contribute to local C3 activity; (4) epithelial cell-derived C3 protects against severe bacterial pneumonia; and (5) this protection is potentially occurring via intracellular complement Factor B (FB), akin to canonical extracellular complement activation (39), but with important physiological functions necessary for cell survival. These observations put into perspective a long-standing premise that complement—an evolutionary conserved defense system—may have originated intracellularly and evolved extracellularly with the complexity of the host (45).\n\nLiver-derived complement proteins form a necessary component of host defense, as evidenced by recurrent infections in patients with cirrhosis (11, 46). To that effect, we found that splenic dissemination of bacteria was higher in the mice deficient in liver-derived C3 compared to controls, suggesting its role in enhancing immune resistance. However, there are two specific issues in this context that need consideration: first, that functional complement activity was observed in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of mice deficient in liver-derived C3 in the setting of infection, despite no activity in the circulation and, second, that splenic bacterial burden in the mice deficient in liver-derived C3 was significantly lower than that observed in global C3-deficient mice. These observations would suggest that extrahepatic sources of C3 are induced and are important in controlling bacteremic pneumonia.\n\nWe and others have previously reported that lung epithelial cells produce and secrete C3, and this secretion is apically polarized, which may facilitate host defense at the air-liquid interface (18, 21, 47, 48). Given our finding that C3 is upregulated in lung epithelial cells under stress in vitro, and in the infected airways of people with cystic fibrosis, (18), we genetically depleted C3 specifically from lung epithelial cells that are known to be major sources of C3, Scgb1a1+ club cells (49). The severity of bacterial pneumonia in these mice suggests that lung epithelial cell-derived C3 is necessary for protection against lung injury despite adequate circulating C3 levels. Cell-intrinsic C3 thus affects fundamental cellular processes such as survival, which until now had primarily been demonstrated in vitro (18, 19).\n\nLung epithelial cells contain multiple intracellular complement components (18, 21, 50); yet which of these components offer cytoprotection in the Pa model along with cell-intrinsic C3 is unclear. Our findings indicate that intracellular Factor B is necessary for cellular survival. Our data also suggest that both C3 and Factor B promote Akt phosphorylation, which is known to inhibit lung epithelial cell death (51, 52). However, we acknowledge that we have not yet identified the exact mechanism by which C3 connects to intracellular Factor B to promote cell survival. One possibility may be through the formation of an intracellular C3 convertase with C3b (C3bBb), as has been previously shown by other investigators (21, 53). Whether this convertase facilitates clearance of intracellular pathogens or debris, and how C3 and Factor B promote pAkt signaling will be dissected in future work.\n\nGiven that C3a-C3aR interactions have been shown to facilitate the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells towards a TH1 phenotype (50), alter mitochondrial calcium uptake and ATP production in stressed retinal pigment epithelial cells (54), and promote glucose-induced insulin secretion in human and mouse pancreatic islet cells (19, 55), our findings on the cytoprotective role of Factor B suggests that intracellular C3 may have multiple targets and functions based on the stressor and the cell type. Moreover, although we have focused on Factor B in lung epithelial cells, other complement components have also been shown to modulate lung epithelial cell responses. For example, airway epithelial cells and alveolar (Type 1 and Type 2) epithelial cells also express C3aR, C5, C5aR1, and C5aR2, in addition to C3 and Factor B (22, 56, 57). C3aR activation on alveolar Type 2 epithelial cells has recently been implicated in promoting endoplasmic reticulum stress and exacerbating bleomycin-induced lung injury, cellular apoptosis, and inflammation, which was suppressed by decay accelerating factor (DAF, CD55) induction, a membrane-associated complement regulator (58). These observations create a precedent for complement modulating certain cellular processes in a stimuli-specific and cell-specific manner, and accordingly targeting therapies based on the desired effect.\n\nThere are certain limitations of our study. First, we deleted C3 from Scgb1a1+ cells based on our prior findings that (a) these cells are an abundant source of C3 (18), (b) C3 protects both epithelial and alveolar cells from infection (59), and (c) Pa infection induces a bronchopneumonia (60). Future work will need to address whether the protective effects of lung epithelial cell-derived C3 in severe bacterial pneumonia are due to biosynthesized C3 that is stored in cells, or is secreted by neighboring lung epithelial cells and is internalized (18, 24). Second, there are sources of C3 in the lungs other than lung epithelial cells, such as monocyte/macrophages, fibroblasts and mesenchymal stem cells (17, 61–63). Future studies would determine if delivering C3 to the lung via these other sources is sufficient for mitigating lung injury in a paracrine manner. Third, our findings are mainly from genetically altered murine models and primary human tracheobronchial epithelial cell cultures. We did not use recombinant complement proteins or pharmacologic inhibitors in vivo as we were focusing on biosynthesized intracellular stores; however, future work using cell-permeable inhibitors will help dissect the relative contributions of these stores to cellular function. Moreover, our current in vivo models lack the ability to detect the specific isoform of cytoprotective C3. There is increasing acknowledgement of a secreted form of C3 that has a signal peptide versus an intracellular cytosolic form with an alternate start site downstream of the signal peptide (19). Distinguishing these two forms of C3 may have therapeutic implications. Additionally, although we have shown that C3 may be exerting its protective effect through FB, we do not exclude noncanonical intracellular interactions, such as how C3 interacts with ATG16L1 in pancreatic β cells (19) or in gut epithelial cells, thereby targeting the intracellular bacteria towards autophagolysosomes for degradation (13). Finally, we focused on the role of C3 in acute injury due to bacterial pneumonia (i.e., within 24 h). The effects of C3 may be different based on the stressor (21, 64, 65) and the temporal course of an infection (66).\n\nIn summary, we show that in addition to liver-derived C3, lung epithelial cell-derived C3 supports the host response to pneumonia by promoting both immune resistance and tissue resilience. This protection appears to occur via Factor B, which is an important component of the alternative pathway of the complement cascade (67). Our observation of an intracellular Factor B protein adds to the growing knowledge of how intracellular complement proteins modulate fundamental processes such as cell survival (12, 13, 18, 50, 55), and importantly, provides a putative mechanism by which lung epithelial cell-derived C3 offers protection. An understanding of tissue-derived and intracellular complement proteins is necessary to reconcile prior trial results of complement therapeutics, a majority of which have primarily targeted circulating complement proteins and do not necessarily penetrate inside the cell (68, 69). We are optimistic that complement therapies targeting a specific organ can be re-evaluated in terms of local protein activity and caution against the unintentional effects of cell-permeable complement inhibitors. In this manner, we will be able to harness endogenously produced immune mediators including the complement system to better combat diseases such as pneumonia-induced lung injury.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nStudy Design\n\nThe primary objective of the research was to assess whether C3-deficiency increases the risk of severe pneumonia occurring in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) infection. The secondary objectives included (i) assessing whether mice deficient in liver-derived C3, and mice deficient in lung epithelial cell-derived C3 were at increased risk of severe pneumonia compared to their littermate controls, and (ii) whether the protective effects of C3 occurred via C3aR and/or FB. We used Pa as a model as it induces an acute bronchopneumonia (9). To eliminate the effects attributable to bacterial proliferation, in vivo experiments were repeated using heat-killed Pa (HKPa). For serum reconstitution experiments, normal mouse serum (NMS) was administered i.p. to C3-deficient mice. Mouse experiments included at least 5 mice in each group unless animal death occurred during the procedure. Each experiment was repeated at least twice, in most cases, by two independent authors. The effect was not attributed to differences between groups unless specified. Primary cell culture experiments included at least three different donors. RNA sequencing experiments from BEAS-2B cells included 3 samples in each group. To evaluate if the cytoprotective effects of C3 observed during an acute infection also occur in sterile injury, we utilized an in vitro model of oxidative stress (18).\n\nMice\n\nAll animal studies were conducted on protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). A table following the ARRIVE guidelines (70) for standard reporting of animal studies is included in the Supplementary Material (Table S1). All data are reported from controlled laboratory experiments. Mice (8–12 weeks of age) on a C57BL/6 background were used for all experiments. Commercially available mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) purchased included: wild-type C57BL/6J (WT, 000664) and B6.Cg-Speer6-ps1Tg(Alb-cre)21Mgn/J (Alb-Cre, 003574) mice. C3-deficient, C3aR-deficient and Cfb-deficient mice were maintained in colonies at WUSM (67, 71–74). Scgb1a1-CreERT2+/− mice were generated by breeding an Scgb1a1-CreER™ (B6N.129S6(Cg)-Scgb1a1tm1(cre/ERT)Blh/J, strain # 016225) to an Ai9 mouse (B6.Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm9(CAG-tdTomato)Hze/J, strain# 007909). C3f/fIRES-tdTomato mice were obtained from Dr. Claudia Kemper at the National Institutes of Health (17), and bred with Alb-Cre mice to create mice deficient in liver-derived C3, and with Scgb1a1-CreERT2+/− mice to generate mice deficient in lung epithelial cell-derived C3. Tail tips of mice were collected before weaning. Oligomers for PCR amplification were designed to yield products of unique size to identify deleted sequences from C3, C3aR, and Cfb as previously published (73, 74). PCR reaction for digested tail samples is as follows: Step 1 at 94°C for 4 min, Step 2: 94°C for 1 min, Step 3: 68°C for 1 min, Step 4: 72°C for 1 min, Steps 2–4 repeated for 30 cycles, followed by Step 5 at 72°C for 5 min, and reaction is concluded at 4°C until samples are retrieved. Primers used are listed in Table S3. PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis using 2–3% agarose (#16500500, Thermo Fisher) gel with SYBR Safe dye (#{\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"S33102\",\"term_id\":\"420481\",\"term_text\":\"pir||S33102\"}}S33102, Thermo).\n\nPrimary human epithelial cells, cell lines and cell culture conditions\n\nHuman tissue use has been reviewed by the WUSM Institutional Review Board. Primary human tracheobronchial epithelial cells (hTECs) and BEAS-2B lung epithelial cells (CRL-9609, ATCC, Manassas, VA) were used for in vitro experiments. The method for cell culture, including media composition, has been described (18). FB-deficient and C3aR-deficient BEAS-2B cells were generated by CRISPR nuclease-induced targeted double strand break at the Genome Engineering Center at WUSM. CFB was disrupted by introducing out-of-frame indels in all alleles so that the mRNA would be degraded by nonsense mediated decay (Fig. S5A). C3aR only has one coding exon; hence, the gene was knocked out by using two gRNAs to delete the whole open reading frame (Fig. S5B). These cells were confirmed to be mycoplasma-negative prior to experimentation and were compared to their parent clones in all experiments.\n\nPreparation of bacteria for infection\n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) M57–15, a clinically relevant strain obtained from the sputum of a patient with cystic fibrosis (75), was cultured on LB agar plates (#L7025–500TAB, Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 37°C from frozen stock. On the next day, Pa was inoculated in LB broth (#L3522, Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 37°C in a rotating shaker (220 rpm). The bacteria were recovered by centrifugation (3000 g, 6 min, 4°C) and resuspended in PBS. The absorbance at 380 nm (Epoch Microplate Spectrophotometer, BioTek) was used to quantify the required dose.\n\nIn vivo bacterial infection\n\nMice were infected with Pa for 8, 16, or 24 h at a dose of 2 × 105 CFU/g of body weight, as stated in the figure legends, before euthanasia for blood and tissue harvest. To prepare HKPa, stock solution was incubated at 100°C for 30 min and frozen at −80°C until use. Mice were anesthetized with a cocktail of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) i.p., then orotracheally intubated utilizing a fiber-optic cable connected to a light source (BioLITE Intubation System, BIO-MI-KIT, Braintree Scientific, Braintree, MA) to facilitate insertion of a Surflo 20-gauge catheter (# SR-OX2025CA, Terumo Medical Products, Somerset, NJ) within the trachea. The suspension of bacteria in sterile PBS was introduced into the catheter at a volume of 1 μL per gram of body weight. Euthanasia was carried out using avertin (2% working solution of avertin is prepared from 100% avertin, which is made by mixing 1 g of 2,2,2-tribromoethyl alcohol (#{\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"T48402\",\"term_id\":\"650382\",\"term_text\":\"T48402\"}}T48402, Sigma-Aldrich) with 1 ml of tert-amyl alcohol (#240486, Sigma-Aldrich)). Lungs were harvested either for the wet-dry ratio, BAL collection, flow cytometry, bacterial colony counts, or as a whole organ for fixation in 10% formalin before submission for histology. Spleens were harvested for colony counts. BAL was collected from mouse lungs using 0.5–1 ml PBS with 1X Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (diluted from 100X; #78429, Thermo Fisher). After collection, BAL was spun down at 500 g for 5 min before supernatant was collected and stored at −80°C for further experiments.\n\nIn vitro stress-induced epithelial injury\n\nFor in vitro infection, Pa M57–15 was used at different multiplicity of infection (MOI) and for different periods of time as indicated in the figure legends. Bacterial cultures were suspended in DMEM (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium, #10–017-CV, Corning, NY) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated antibiotic-free fetal bovine serum (#26140079, Thermo Fisher). For in vitro oxidative stress experiments, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, H1009, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was freshly prepared to a concentration of 250–1000 μM prior to use. To separate the effects of proteins acting extracellularly versus their intracellular roles, protein secretion was inhibited by treating epithelial cells using a protein transport inhibitor (PTI) cocktail (#00–4980, eBioscience Protein Transport Inhibitor Cocktail (500X)), containing brefeldin A and monensin. Cells were plated in a 35 mm plate at a density of 5*105 cells/ml/plate 24 h before treatment. At 80–90% confluence, cells were washed with PBS, then treated with 1X PTI (directly added to culture medium) for 6 h. This was followed by Pa infection (MOI 5). The supernatant and lysate were collected from these cells and inhibition of protein secretion was confirmed through immunoblotting. Details regarding RNA extraction and sequencing, and analysis of RNA sequencing data from BEAS-2B cells have also been provided in the Supplementary Methods. Differentially expressed genes (1.6-fold, adjusted p value <0.05) were further analyzed by a knowledge engine called ‘COmprehensive Multi-omics Platform for Biological InterpretatiOn’ (COMPBIO V2.0) (76).\n\nIntracellular bacterial burden\n\nBEAS-2B cells were plated one day prior infection on a glass coverslip in a 12 well plate at a density of 1.5 × 105/ml/well. For preparing fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled Pa, FITC (#46950, Sigma) was dissolved in anhydrous DMSO to a working concentration of 500 μg/mL. Pa was prepared as described above and suspended in 1 mL of sterile PBS. From a working concentration (500 μg/ml), 5 μl of FITC was added to 1 mL of bacterial culture followed by gentle rotation at room temperature for 60 min protected from light to label the bacteria. The bacterial pellet was subsequently harvested by centrifugation at 3000 x g for 5 min at room temperature, followed by washing twice in sterile PBS. The pellet was suspended in antibiotic-free DMEM for infection. After 4 h of infection, cells were incubated for 60 min in DMEM containing 10μg/ml gentamicin (#15750–060, Gibco) to remove extracellular bacteria. Cells were then washed twice with PBS, fixed and stained with DAPI prior to confocal microscopy on a Zeiss LSM880 laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY) at 63X oil magnification.\n\nAssessment of functional fluid-phase complement activity\n\nWe adapted a previously published assay for serum (27). For its use with BAL, ELISA plates (96-well flat-bottom, #3855, Thermo Fisher) were coated with LPS (2 μg/well in 100 μL; #L2762, Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 4°C. After washing three times with a solution of 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, samples (serum 1:10, BAL 1:5) in Mg2+-EGTA buffer were added 50μL/well, and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The plates were washed again three times and 100μL/well goat anti-mouse C3 (#55463, MP Biomedicals) diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, #A7906, Sigma) in PBS (1:4000 in 1%BSA/PBS) was added for 1 h. After another three washes, samples were incubated with 100μL/well HRP-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG antibody (1:2000 in 1%BSA/PBS) (#705–035-147, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 1 h. After three washes, TMB Color Substrate (#DY999, R&D Systems) was added 100μL/well and incubated at room temperature (RT) for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 50μL/well of 2N sulfuric acid (#DY994, R&D Systems), and OD was measured at 450 nm (Epoch Microplate Spectrophotometer, BioTek).\n\nAssessment of ALI and infection severity\n\nALI was assessed using multiple domains (77). To assess club cell death in vivo, Scgb1a1+ cells were quantified in the terminal bronchioles in a fixed 150 μm length of the airway in multiple, independent areas of the lung. Acetylated α-tubulin was used to identify ciliated cells. A ‘club cell ratio’ was obtained by dividing the club cell numbers (Scgb1a1+) by the sum of the club cells (Scgb1a1+) + ciliated cells (acetylated α-tubulin+) in the same fixed length of airway (36–38). To obtain a wet-dry ratio, the weight of “wet” lungs was immediately measured after euthanasia (#AB54-S, Mettler Toledo, Columbus, OH), and the value obtained was divided by their “dry” weight that was measured after 24 h in a 65°C oven. To assess physiological dysfunction, whole body plethysmography was performed as previously described (78). Changes in airway resistance (RI) and dynamic compliance (Cdyn) were recorded in response to increasing doses of inhaled methacholine (#A2251, Sigma Aldrich). To assess systemic bacterial burden, spleens were harvested into 0.9 ml sterile PBS and homogenized in microtubes (#72.694.006, Sarstedt AG & Co, Nümbrecht, Germany) using stainless steel beads (11079132ss, BioSpec, Bartlesville, OK), on a bead beater. The homogenate was serially diluted, plated on LB agar, and incubated at 37°C overnight prior to colony counting. To assess local bacterial burden, lungs were harvested into 0.8 ml sterile PBS and processed similarly. The total volume of both spleen and lung homogenate was 1 ml.\n\nFlow cytometry\n\nTo obtain a single cell suspension, mouse lungs were digested using collagenase A (10103586001, Roche, 1.5 mg/ml), DNase I (D4527, Sigma, 0.1 mg/ml), 5% fetal bovine serum, 10 mM HEPES buffer (25–060-CI, Corning, Durham, NC) and PBS. Specifically, after perfusing the right atrium with 10 ml of 1X PBS, the lungs were inflated with 1 ml of the abovementioned digest solution, cut into 3–4 mm pieces using scissors, and gently vortexed in 2 ml of digest solution. The digest was incubated at 37°C for 40 min in a shaker incubator at 190 rpm, while gently vortexing samples every 5–7 min. After adding 10 ml of ice-cold PBS, the digest was vortexed for 30 seconds, filtered through a 70 μM strainer (431751, Corning) and spun at 500 g for 10 min at 4°C. After discarding the supernatant, the cells were resuspended in 2 ml ACK Lysing buffer (A10492–01, Gibco) and incubated at RT for 4–7 min, after which they were resuspended in 10 ml of ice-cold 1% BSA in PBS and centrifuged again at 500 g for 10 min at 4° C. 1–2 × 106 cells were added to a 96-well plate for staining using antibodies listed in Table S2. Data was acquired on an Attune NxT flow cytometer (Thermo Scientific) and analyzed using FlowJo v10.8.0 (Becton, Dickinson and Company; Ashland, OR).\n\nCytokine and chemokine measurements\n\nSerum was obtained before and after infection from the same mice; however, BAL was obtained from different mice in the uninfected and infected groups, as the BAL procedure is terminal. For BAL protein levels (i.e., BCA assay), fresh or thawed BAL samples were diluted (1:10 to 1:50 in PBS) to fall within the range of the recommended standard curve of the assay, before total protein level was quantified using Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit (#23227, Thermo Fisher) according to provided protocol. To assess cytokine levels in mouse serum and BAL, we used a multianalyte assay (LEGENDplex Mouse Inflammation Panel; #740446, BioLegend, San Diego, CA) according to the provided protocol. To assess epithelial cell injury in the mouse BAL, Mouse RAGE DuoSet ELISA (#DY1179, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was used according to the provided protocol. The BAL samples were either diluted 1:2 or 1:4 based on known protein levels, but in a single run, the dilutions were the same. To assess epithelial cell death in mouse BAL, Mouse Cytokeratin 18 ELISA (#ab243678, Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) was used according to the provided protocol. BAL samples were diluted 1:2 for this assay.\n\nImmunoblotting\n\nSamples obtained from mice were diluted in PBS at a ratio of 1:10 for plasma and 1:5 for BAL. Laemmli sample buffer (1610747, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) was added to each sample and boiled for 5 min at 100°C in a heat block for complete denaturation of protein. To prepare cell lysates for immunoblotting, cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and lysed using lysis buffer (9803, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) supplemented with Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (78429, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) for 20 min on ice. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (14,000 g) for 10 min and cooked in SDS-denaturing Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min. Immunoblotting was done as previously described (18) using antibodies listed in Table S2.\n\nImmunostaining\n\nCells were plated on cover slips in 24 well plates at a seeding density of 105 cells/well overnight prior to the experiment. For evaluating the cellular response to Pa using immunostaining, cells were fixed by directly adding fixative solution (10% neutral buffered formalin, prepared by mixing 100 ml formaldehyde (37–40%), 900 ml distilled water, sodium phosphate (monobasic) 4 g/L and sodium phosphate (dibasic, anhydrous) 6.5 g/L) equal in amount to the medium present in the well. After removing media and fixative solution after 2 min, 500 μl of fixative solution was again added to cells and incubation for 20 min at RT. The solution was aspirated and cells were then washed twice with PBS. Cells were permeabilized by adding 0.05% Triton-X 100 (T8787, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in PBS for 5 min at RT, followed by washing twice with PBS. Cells were blocked by adding 2% bovine serum albumin (9048–46-8, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in PBS for 30 min at RT followed by washing twice with PBS, and immunostaining was performed as previously described (18) using antibodies listed in Table S2. Cells were imaged using Zeiss LSM880 laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY) at 63X oil magnification. Immunofluorescence staining of lungs was also performed as previously described (18) on tissue sections deparaffinized with xylene and ethanol, using antibodies listed in Table S2.\n\nRNAScope in situ hybridization (ISH)\n\nRNAScope ISH was carried out using ACD HybEZ II Hybridization System With ACD EZ-Batch Slide System (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Newark, CA), following the protocol for Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit v2 Assay (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) using probes for Scgb1a1 (420351-C3) and C3 (417841). Opal 520 (FP1487001KT, Akoya Biosciences, Marlborough, MA) was used for Scgb1a1 and Opal 650 (FP1496001KT) was used for C3 (both 1:750), and slides were imaged using Zeiss LSM880 laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY) at 63X oil magnification.\n\nLive-cell imaging for cytotoxicity\n\nH2O2-induced cytotoxicity was analyzed using an IncuCyte Live Cell Imager (Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany) at Genome Engineering and iPSC Center at WUSM. The ratio of SYTOX Green Nucleic Acid Stain (1:10,000, S7020, Invitrogen) and SYTO 24 Green Fluorescent Nucleic Acid Stain (1:1000, S7559, Invitrogen) was reported over time, averaged over 4 independent fields in each well of a 96-well plate, with 4 technical replicates per time point. Infection-induced cytotoxicity was assessed using CellInsight CX5 High Content Screening (HCS) Platform with an on-stage incubator (maintained at 37°C, 5% CO2). Cells were stained with 1X HCS Nuclear Mask Staining (# {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"H10325\",\"term_id\":\"875147\",\"term_text\":\"H10325\"}}H10325, Thermo Fisher) and 1 μM SYTOX AADvanced Dead Cell Stain Kit (# {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"S10274\",\"term_id\":\"84309\",\"term_text\":\"pir||S10274\"}}S10274, Thermo Fisher) in DMEM media supplemented with 1% P/S, 1% Glutamine and 10% FBS (CellInsight CX5 configuration: Assay Algorithm TargetActivation.V4. HCS Nuclear Mask (Channel 1) was detected by filter 386–23 and the SYTOX® AADvanced stain (Channel 2) was detected by filter 560–25). Cell viability was assessed by measuring total intensity of SYTOX staining. Values showed are mean ± SD of five replicate wells, which represents SYTOX total intensity of all pixels within an object. ***P < 0.001, N.S. not significant.\n\nQuantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR for inflammatory and epithelial cell genes\n\nmRNA extraction was performed using RNeasy Plus Mini kit (#74134, QIAGEN, Germantown, MD) per the manufacturer’s protocol and cDNA synthesis was performed using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (#4368814, Thermo Scientific) according to manufacturer’s recommendations. cDNA sample was diluted by 5-fold following cDNA synthesis and real-time PCR of each gene was carried out in duplicate on a Roche LightCycler 480 real-time PCR instrument. Each PCR reaction contained 2 μL of cDNA template, 0.6 μL of forward and reverse primers (with final concentration of 0.5μM/well), 4 μL of SYBR Green master mix (A46109, Applied Biosystems), and 5.4 μL of RT-PCR grade H2O. All primers were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies (Table S4). The PCR program was run as follows: an initial pre-incubation step at 95°C for 3 min followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 10 seconds, annealing and elongation at 60°C for 20 seconds, and fluorescence reading at 72°C for 1 second. Ct values were read and exported from LightCycler 480 software, and the commonly used 2(−ΔΔCt) method was used to calculate relative gene expression using Gapdh or Hprt1 as the housekeeping gene. Data are shown are adjusted to the housekeeping gene.\n\nSingle cell RNA sequencing analysis (scRNA-seq) from LungMAP\n\nThe single cell reference program for human lungs was used on the Lung Gene Expression Atlas (LGEA, LungMAP Phase 2) web portal (29–32), available at: https://research.cchmc.org/pbge/lunggens/tools/lung_at_glance.html?tab=reference. LungMAP was used to compare the relative expression of C3 across different cell types (X-axis) in non-diseased human lungs. Cell ontologies are obtained from the NHLBI Molecular Atlas of Lung Development Program Consortium (79). The expression of a gene in each cell type was measured using the total unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts for each cell divided by the median UMI counts per cell and normalized using “LogNormalize” in Seurat (“Normalized Expression”, Y-axis). The LungMAP scRNA-seq reference is associated with the Lung CellCards resource (32). This initial reference integrated 259k cells from 72 donors from five published (80–84) and one unpublished single cell RNA-seq cohort. It consists of non-diseased adult and pediatric healthy lung single-cell 10x Genomics captures (v2 and v3).\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nData are presented as scatter plots showing individual data points, and dispersion is shown by mean ± standard deviation. Unpaired t test was used for comparing two groups, assuming equal variance and ordinary one-way ANOVA test with multiple comparisons testing was used for more than two groups. A p value of < 0.05 was considered significant, although values > 0.05 have been reported when there was evidence of a trend. Prism v9.3.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA) was used for statistical analysis.\n\nSupplementary Material\n\nSupplementary Material and Figures\n\nSupplementary Methods\n\nFig. S1.
