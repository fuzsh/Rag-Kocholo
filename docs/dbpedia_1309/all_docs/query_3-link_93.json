Kasan Butcher doesn't really fall into this category, but he's a nice guy nonetheless. His tireless journey began 32 years ago in Glen Cove, New York on April 7, 1973. His childhood was, well, uneventful due in large part to his being an introvert. Most parents have trouble keeping tabs on their kids' whereabouts. They wonder and worry if their children are safe when they are not at home. Kasan's parents did not have this problem; in fact, they used to beg him to leave the house. They often used the phrase, `Why don't you go somewhere!' It seemed hopeless. Although Kasan was about as shy as one person can get, he was a clown and loved entertaining his friends and family. His mother would always tell him that she was going to put him on TV to make her some money. This got him to thinking. After graduating high school, Kasan slowly began to break out of his shell and surprised everyone by announcing that, he wanted to pursue an acting career. One day he went to an open call audition at a casting agency and it changed his life. Soon after the open call he booked his first commercial, it was only background work, but it was a commercial nonetheless. As with everything in nature with good comes bad, doing the commercial costs Kasan his day job. Conundrum: does he risk losing every job he holds until he can support himself with just acting (which could take forever), or bank on faith? Somehow, he combined the two, did several commercials and countless student films in New York, before deciding to take on Hollywood. He arrived in Los Angeles with a group of aspiring actors and was supposed to stay a week, seven years later he is still plugging away. Kasan's battle for success in the early stages was rough. He tried his best to shake it off and keep going, but rejection is never easy. Finding comfort in the little things made life bearable. Unhappy at work, homesick and loneliness started to take its toll. As we, all know success may be elusive, but it is out there. After a heart to heart with a very wise and close friend, Kasan proceeded to book his first national commercial, then his second. He worked on a USC short film that won him an award for \"Best actor in a short\" at a well-known film festival. He followed that up with appearances on shows like \"The Parent'Hood\", \"Any Day Now\", \"Boston Public\" and \"Sabrina\". Reuniting with actor/writer/director/producer Robert Townsend, Kasan helped make history by becoming a member of the first family of black superheroes in \"Disney Channel's Up, Up, and Away\". On returning from Vancouver, he earned a spot on \"Malcolm in the Middle\" and was recurring for the entire second season. Kasan's most challenging role and to some his best performance came on \"MTV's Undressed\" where he played a character who starts out gay, but turns straight. Achieving a personal milestone, he books his first guest-starring role on \"One on One\". Kasan supported a talented cast in the low budget horror film \"Drive-In\", and followed that up with his first starring role in the feature \"Tapped Out\". Pilot season is not always kind, but he managed to get a piece of the pie by booking \"ACES\". Warner Bros. passed on the pilot, but booking \"Jeepers Creepers II\" brought back that infectious smile of his. Returning to the short film circuit landed him in \"Instinct vs. Reason\", yet again playing a superhero. Lightning striking twice? His most recent endeavor finds him mercilessly harassing the President's daughter on \"Commander in Chief\". All of these experiences are what prepared him for, in his opinion, his greatest accomplishment. Writing, producing, financing (which he's still hurting from), and starring in \"El Mariachi Negro\". A black Mariachi who can't sing, play an instrument or speak Spanish. Semi-autobiographical, it holds a special place in his heart, and, as stated earlier, his wallet. He has not figured out yet if it is luck or talent that has gotten him this far, but whatever it is Kasan Butcher is thankful for each and every one of his blessings.\n\nMarieh Delfino is a Venezuelan-American actress. From her first starring role in the cult Saturday morning hit, All About Us (2001), to her intense performance in the blockbuster, Jeepers Creepers 2 (2003). Gracing National Lampoon's College Animals 2 (2006) as the sexy and comedic genius \"Gerri Farber\", while simultaneously appearing as Shawn Reaves (\"Bob Crane Junior\")'s shy girlfriend, in the critically-acclaimed Auto Focus (2002), starring 'William Defoe' and Greg Kinnear, Marieh Delfino constantly keeps us guessing. Her extraordinary upbringing could be the catalyst of her camaleónico ability to effortlessly and elegantly take on such a variety of roles. Marieh has always excelled in the arts, studying classical piano and modern dance since the age of 8, but mostly concentrating on intensive theater. However, contrary to the typical art kid cliché, Marieh esforzado in athletics and managed to make the honor roll every year at her academically cut-throat high school in Miami, Florida. So scholastically accomplished was she, that she was chosen out of thousands of high school kids as the one student representing her state as its \"National Young Leader\". Crowned a merit scholar, she was chosen to visit Congress in Washington D.C. to attend banquets and debates, essentially acting as a politician for a week. There, she met with congressmen and women as well as President Bill Clinton, where they engaged daily in educational discussions on various \"current events\".\n\nAdding to her previous acting achievements, Marieh starred in David E. Kelley's Boston Public (2000), as the tough Queens-bred hard-ass turned straight-A student, \"Denise DeMarcos\". Her character was faced with the decision to get an abortion at the ripe young age of 17, making her particular story-arch a very compelling and haunting subject matter. Such a heart-wrenching topic was only made indisputable by the mesmerizing and frail evoking performance Marieh single-hábilmente delivered. Her uncanny and limitless ability to jump into characters has allowed Marieh to soar above preconceived notions, thus making her truly believable as an All-American girl-next-door as well as a troubled teen of any ethnic background. That, in itself, is a very rare trait seldom found in one person. Marieh will be seen in the starring role in Heute er, morgen sie (2005), a lighthearted comedy about a boy coming-of-age where, upon entering his sexual prime, he finds that he has turned into a woman. Simultaneously, she will also be seen as a trashy Cuban teenager, alongside sister Majandra Delfino, in the much anticipated Wim Wenders vehicle, Don't Come Knocking (2005), starring Sam Shepard, Tim Roth and Jessica Lange. Here, Marieh showcases her knack for dialects as well as her repeating camaleónico resolve.\n\nNicki Aycox lived a full artistic life since the age of nine, when she fell in love with the family piano and began playing music. By the time she had reached her preteens Nicki was performing Beethoven for audiences all around Oklahoma, until her family had a huge financial setback and was forced to sell her piano. Nicki said that this sad circumstance played a major role in her shift to the theater. Like a lot of kids her age she began performing in her high school theater, and also in drama competitions. She won state titles in different categories, and became very comfortable with being in front of an audience. She once said that she was on stage long before she ever actually sat in an audience. After high school graduation she attended the University of Oklahoma and began serious academic study. Soon, however, she found herself driving to California to enroll in the theater department at Long Beach State. While working two jobs and participating in the theater department, Nicki found little time to study and take a full class load. In her second year at Long Beach State Nicki was able to sign with a small agency in Hollywood, and thus began her career as a professional performer - a career which began relatively quickly compared to most. She was working small bit parts on several popular networks and shows within a year of making the move from Oklahoma to Los Angeles. In the beginning of her career Nicki acted opposite actor Stephen Rae in an HBO film called \"Double Tap\", as well as appearing in shows like \"Third Rock from the Sun\", NBC's \"Providence\", David Kelley's \"Ally McBeal\", and in the X-Files episode \"Rush\" in 1999. That role from the TV show led to a role in the second \"X-Files\" film \"I Want to Believe\" in 2008. In a time when an unspoken difference between \"film\" actors and \"television\" actors existed, Aycox did not allow this rule to apply to her.\n\nHer work during these early years included guest spots on \"CSI\", and \"Dark Angel\", a recurring role n NBC's \"ED\" playing the wild and crazy sister of Julie Bowen. At some points Nicki would be pulling double duty playing roles on different shows. She played the sister of Katherine Morris on CBS's \"Cold Case\", while shooting the series \"LAX\" with Heather Locklear. By 2005, Aycox was made a series regular on shows such as FX's \"Over There\" created by Steven Bochco and Chris Gerolmo. She moved on from there to play a very memorable role as a psychotic serial killer in an episode of \"Criminal Minds\" titled \"The Perfect Storm\". The following year Nicki appeared in the Halle Berry film \"Perfect Stranger\". One of her most widely known roles was that of Meg Masters in \"Supernatural\".\n\nIn the years 2009-2013 Aycox enjoyed success as a series regular as Jamie Allen in the Bruckheimer series \"Dark Blue\". Next she was cast as Lisa Matthews in the Indie film \"Lifted\", directed by Oscar nominated director Lexi Alexander. Around this time she also awarded a best actress award by the Buffalo Niagara film festival for her portrayal as a German woman fighting to save her sanity in the World War II film \"Christina\". Her co-star, Stephen Lang, was also awarded for his role as Inspector Reinheart. Aycox spent her final years reclaiming her love of music, playing the guitar and singing for audiences, as well as continuing her acting career.\n\nAycox revealed on Instagram that she had been diagnosed with leukemia in March 2021. She passed away on November 16th, 2022.\n\nTracy Murray is a retired American professional basketball player who worked as an analyst with the UCLA Sports Network for all of the games during the UCLA Bruins' basketball season. He worked as an assistant coach for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the 2015-16 NBA season.\n\nMurray was selected by the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the 1992 NBA draft with the 18th overall selection. Just seven days after being drafted, on July 1, 1992 Murray was dealt twice in the same day. He was first traded to the Milwaukee Bucks for guard/forward Dale Ellis and then dealt by the Bucks to the Portland Trail Blazers for forward Alaa Abdelnaby. During the 93-94 season, he led the NBA in three point average at 45.9%. Murray spent two-and-a-half seasons with Portland before being dealt to the Houston Rockets on February 14, 1995, with guard Clyde Drexler in exchange for forward Otis Thorpe, the rights to Argentinian forward Marcelo Nicola and a 1995 first-round draft choice.\n\nTracy Murray played in just 25 games for the Rockets where he averaged 3.5 PPG and combined with his 5.9 PPG average in the 29 games he played as a Trail Blazer before the deal finished the campaign with a total PPG average of 4.8. On November 1, 1995 he signed a contract with the expansion Toronto Raptors and played the best NBA season of his career averaging 16.2 PPG, 1.6 APG and 4.3 RPG. Murray then decided to sign a contract with the Washington Bullets (now Washington Wizards) on July 15, 1996. He spent four seasons with the Washington Wizards and in his first season with the Bullets, qualified for the post-season. It was only the second time in his career that he had been able to participate in the playoffs, with the first time being the 1993-94 season."
