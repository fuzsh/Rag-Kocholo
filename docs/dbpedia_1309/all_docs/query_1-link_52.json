Recent analysis of DNA fragments suggest this now-icy terrain was once abundant with life.\n\nPhotograph by NASA Archive, Alamy Stock Photo\n\nThe oldest DNA ever analyzed shows that reindeer and mastodons once wandered a nearly unrecognizable Greenland.\n\nTwo million years ago, on the fringe of some of the northernmost land on Earth just 500 miles from the North Pole, the landscape couldn’t have looked more different from today’s polar desert. Instead, a new study finds, it was richly forested—so productive, it was home to a menagerie of reindeer, rodents, and surprisingly even majestic mastodons.\n\nUsing ancient fragments of DNA—likely the oldest ever successfully analyzed—scientists have carefully reconstructed an “unprecedented” glimpse into an ancient, forested landscape at the roof of the world, says Mikkel Pedersen, a geographer at the University of Copenhagen and an author of the new analysis, published Wednesday in Nature.\n\nFig. 1: Geographical location and depositional sequence.\n\na. Location of Kap København Formation in North Greenland at the entrance to the Independence Fjord (82° 24′ N 22° 12′ W) and locations of other Arctic Plio-Pleistocene fossil-bearing sites (red dots). b, Spatial distribution of the erosional remnants of the 100-m thick succession of shallow marine near-shore sediments between Mudderbugt and the low mountains towards the north (a + b refers to location 74a and 74b). c, Glacial–interglacial division of the depositional succession of clay Member A and units B1, B2 and B3 constituting sandy Member B.

Circled numbers on the map mark sample sites for environmental DNA analyses, absolute burial dating and palaeomagnetism. Numbered sites refer to previous publications7*,10*,11*,14*,61*.\n\n*Science paper reference. See the science paper.\n\nSee the science paper for further instructive material with images.\n\nThis Arctic landscape has no modern equivalent, the team says; it is neither boreal forest, as is found in modern Scandinavia, nor temperate forest, but instead a unique mix. They found traces of over a hundred different plant species; insects; marine species; and most excitingly, nine vertebrate species whose fossils had never been seen in Greenland, from small rodents to springy rabbit ancestors to a single trace of a mastodon.\n\nTogether, the DNA paints the picture of a complex, fully integrated ecosystem—one that existed and developed during an era when the polar region was somewhere between 11 to 17 degrees Celsius (about 20 to 30 Fahrenheit) warmer than today, and an era that provides one of the closest possible analogs to our future with climate change.\n\nThe new study’s findings are “not just a window into an old world, but into a different climate reality,” says Brian Buma, an ecologist at the Environmental Defense Fund who was not involved in the study.\n\nThere is a thread of hope, he says—it’s remarkable that such a rich habitat existed in a hot world. But a crucial difference is that ecosystem likely had a long time to adapt and evolve, compared with the planet’s current rate of warming.\n\nA landscape of abundance\n\nThe Arctic is warming by at least 0.5 degrees Celsius (about 1 degree Fahrenheit) each decade; winter temperatures have risen by 6C (about 10F) since the 1980s. Under worst-case climate change scenarios regional temperatures could eventually spike nearly as high as those seen in the era represented by the samples.\n\nIn the face of such change, understanding the Arctic’s future requires seeing its past clearly, says study co-author Ekse Willerslev, an evolutionary geneticist at the U.K.’s University of Cambridge. It is one of the only ways to “give us some kind of idea of how nature can respond to increasing temperatures.”\n\nThe study’s era, about two million years ago, is not a perfect analogy for the future. Earth had been hot for several million years but was cooling toward a more familiar climate state, shifting into a period of oscillating icy and warm stages.\n\nBut “there was a legacy of incredible biodiversity,” says Natalia Rybczynski, a paleobiologist at the Canadian Museum of Nature, who was not involved in the study. The warmth had supported forests across the Arctic, populated by camels, bears, beavers, and many other vertebrates.\n\n“It’s amazing to see that retained” even as the climate has begun to cool, she says.\n\nTrees species like red cedar, today found much farther south in places like Vancouver Island, dotted the landscape. Fragments of DNA from horseshoe crabs, which today thrive in the warm Gulf Stream waters of the eastern U.S., suggest coastal waters were much toastier. The presence of reindeer and mastodon, big animals that eat a lot, means the landscape was highly productive.\n\nThe team didn’t find any genetic traces of carnivores, a vital piece of a complete ecosystem, but it’s likely they were present—just rare, leaving behind only smidgens of genetic material, says Pedersen.\n\n“If we continued sequencing, taking samples and looking deeper, my prediction is that we would have at some point captured some of the carnivores,” he says.\n\nRemarkable scientific breakthroughs\n\nThe detailed reconstruction was nearly 20 years in the making.\n\nIn 2006, some of the team members visited the Kap Kobenhavn site in northern Greenland, prospecting for frozen dirt that might contain preserved DNA.\n\nAt the site, discovered about 40 years ago, scientists searching for ancient Arctic sediments had already uncovered small fragments of ancient birch branches and cones, a piece of a rabbit tooth, and more evidence of a forested landscape.\n\nThose previously discovered fossils and pollen grains told much of the story. But the team wondered if there were even more secrets hidden in the soil. In 2006 and during subsequent field seasons, they collected more frozen dirt and brought it back to the University of Copenhagen lab. But the tools for analyzing DNA—especially such old material—weren’t yet sensitive enough to get any robust results.\n\nSo they waited. Every time a new technique emerged, they’d try again. Someone learned DNA fragments attached to clay particles preserved particularly well, so they targeted clays. Another team discovered they could “shotgun” sequence all DNA fragments, some as small as 30 base pairs—just 1/1000 the size of the average vertebrate gene. Slowly but surely these advances allowed the team to analyze the Greenland DNA, which is probably a million years older than any previously analyzed samples.\n\n“It feels almost magical to be able to infer such a complete picture of an ancient ecosystem from tiny fragments of preserved DNA,” Beth Shapiro, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz who was not involved in the study, wrote by email.\n\n“We keep setting maximum age limits for ourselves and then breaking these limits as the tech improves.”\n\nSee the full article here .\n\nComments are invited and will be appreciated, especially if the reader finds any errors which I can correct.\n\nfive-ways-keep-your-child-safe-school-shootings\n\nPlease help promote STEM in your local schools.\n\nStem Education Coalition\n\nThe National Geographic Society has been inspiring people to care about the planet since 1888. It is one of the largest nonprofit scientific and educational institutions in the world. Its interests include geography, archaeology and natural science, and the promotion of environmental and historical conservation.\n\nFrom NASA Science\n\n8.8.24\n\nLauren Leese\n\nlauren.leese@nasa.gov\n\nWeb Content Strategist for the Office of the Chief Science Data Officer\n\nThis artist’s concept shows the exoplanet K2-33b transiting its host star. Many citizen science projects at NASA invite the public to use transit data to make discoveries about exoplanets. NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nNASA’s upcoming flagship astrophysics missions, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and the Habitable Worlds Observatory, will study planets outside our solar system, known as exoplanets.\n\nOver 5,000 exoplanets have been confirmed to date — and given that scientists estimate at least one exoplanet exists for every star in the sky, the hunt has just begun. Exoplanet discoveries from Roman and the Habitable Worlds Observatory may not be made only by professional researchers, but also by interested members of the public, known as citizen scientists.\n\nExoplanet research has a long involvement with citizen science. NASA’s TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) mission and now-retired Kepler mission, which are responsible for the vast majority of exoplanet discoveries to date, both made observations freely available to the public immediately after processing.\n\nThis open science policy paved the way for the public to get involved with NASA’s exoplanet science.\n\nNASA’s Planet Hunters TESS project invites the public to classify exoplanet light curves from TESS online. Another project, Exoplanet Watch, allows citizen scientists to gather data about known exoplanets, submit their observations to NASA’s public data archive, and receive credit if their observation is used in a scientific paper. Participants don’t even need their own telescope — Exoplanet Watch also curates data from robotic telescopes for users to process.\n\n“Anyone across the world who has access to a smartphone or a laptop can fully participate in a lot of these citizen science efforts to help us learn more about the cosmos,” said Rob Zellem, the project lead and project scientist for Exoplanet Watch and astrophysicist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.\n\nNASA’s citizen science projects have discovered several new planets from Kepler and TESS data. They have also helped scientists refine the best time to observe important targets, saving hours of precious observation time on current flagship missions like NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope.\n\nRoman and the Habitable Worlds Observatory provide even more possibilities for citizen science. Expected to launch by May 2027, Roman will discover exoplanets through direct imaging, transits, and gravitational microlensing. Following that, the Habitable Worlds Observatory will take direct images of stars in our solar neighborhood to find potentially habitable planets and study their atmospheres.\n\nLike Kepler and TESS before them, data from Roman and the Habitable Worlds Observatory will be available to both the scientific community and the public immediately after processing. With Roman’s surveys expected to deliver a terabyte of data to Earth every day — over 17 times as much as Webb — there is a huge opportunity for the public to help sift through the information.\n\n“The general public can get Roman data as quickly as I can as a scientist working on the mission,” said Zellem, who also serves as Roman’s deputy project scientist for communications at NASA Goddard. “It truly makes Roman a mission for everyone and anyone.”\n\nAlthough the Habitable Worlds Observatory’s full capabilities and instrumentation have yet to be finalized, the inclusion of citizen science is expected to continue. The team behind the mission is embracing a community-oriented planning approach by opening up working groups to volunteers who want to contribute.\n\n“It’s already setting the tone for open science with the Habitable Worlds Observatory,” said Megan Ansdell, the program scientist for the mission at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “The process is as open as possible, and these working groups are open to anybody in the world who wants to join.” There are already over 1,000 community working group members participating, some of whom are citizen scientists.\n\nThe Roman Coronagraph, photographed during testing at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab in Southern California, is a technology demonstration designed to block starlight and allow scientists to see the faint light from planets outside our solar system. It represents one of multiple ways that Roman will contribute to exoplanet research.\n\nNASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nFuture citizen science initiatives may be combined with cutting-edge tools such as artificial intelligence (AI) for greater efficacy. “AI can be exceptionally powerful in terms of classification and identifying anomalous things,” said Joshua Pepper, the deputy program scientist for the Habitable Worlds Observatory at NASA Headquarters. “But the evaluation of what those anomalous things are often requires human insight, intervention, and review, and I think that could be a really fantastic area for citizen scientists to participate.”\n\nBefore Roman and the Habitable Worlds Observatory launch, exoplanet citizen scientists still have plenty of data to analyze from the Kepler and TESS satellites, but the contributions of the community will become even more important when data begin pouring in from the new missions. As Zellem said, “We’re in a golden age of exoplanet science right now.”\n\nNASA’s citizen science projects are collaborations between scientists and interested members of the public and do not require U.S. citizenship. Through these collaborations, volunteers (known as citizen scientists) have helped make thousands of important scientific discoveries.

The Science Mission Directorate (SMD) is an organization where discoveries in one scientific discipline have a direct route to other areas of study. This flow is something extremely valuable and is rare in the scientific world.\n\nNASA leads the nation on a great journey of discovery, seeking new knowledge and understanding of our planet Earth, our Sun and solar system, and the universe out to its farthest reaches and back to its earliest moments of existence. NASA’s Science Mission Directorate (SMD) and the nation’s science community use space observatories to conduct scientific studies of the Earth from space to visit and return samples from other bodies in the solar system, and to peer out into our Galaxy and beyond. NASA’s science program seeks answers to profound questions that touch us all:\n\nThis is NASA’s science vision: using the vantage point of space to achieve with the science community and our partners a deep scientific understanding of our planet, other planets and solar system bodies, the interplanetary environment, the Sun and its effects on the solar system, and the universe beyond. In so doing, we lay the intellectual foundation for the robotic and human expeditions of the future while meeting today’s needs for scientific information to address national concerns, such as climate change and space weather. At every step we share the journey of scientific exploration with the public and partner with others to substantially improve science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education nationwide.\n\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is the agency of the United States government that is responsible for the nation’s civilian space program and for aeronautics and aerospace research.\n\nPresident Dwight D. Eisenhower established the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1958 with a distinctly civilian (rather than military) orientation encouraging peaceful applications in space science. The National Aeronautics and Space Act was passed on July 29, 1958, disestablishing NASA’s predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. The new agency became operational on October 1, 1958.\n\nSince that time, most U.S. space exploration efforts have been led by NASA, including the Apollo moon-landing missions, the Skylab space station, and later the Space Shuttle. Currently, NASA is supporting the International Space Station and is overseeing the development of the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle and Commercial Crew vehicles. The agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program (LSP) which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for unmanned NASA launches. Most recently, NASA announced a new Space Launch System that it said would take the agency’s astronauts farther into space than ever before and lay the cornerstone for future human space exploration efforts by the U.S.\n\nNASA science is focused on better understanding Earth through the Earth Observing System, advancing heliophysics through the efforts of the Science Mission Directorate’s Heliophysics Research Program, exploring bodies throughout the Solar System with advanced robotic missions such as New Horizons, and researching astrophysics topics, such as the Big Bang, through the Great Observatories [NASA/ESA Hubble, NASA Chandra, NASA Spitzer, and associated programs.] NASA shares data with various national and international organizations such as from [JAXA]Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite.\n\nFrom Webb\n\n8.9.24\n\nThe central region of a spiral galaxy. Its core is a small bright point radiating bright, bluish-white light over the scene. The white light is diffuse and many point-like stars in the galaxy (and even background galaxies) can be seen through it. The galaxy’s arms can be seen as broad, swirling streaks of glowing gas and dust, coloured red and orange. Two additional arms are revealed in green.\n\nMessier 106 viewed by Hubble and Webb\n\nA graphic with three images. The leftmost image shows a spiral galaxy in full on a dark background, seen in visible light by a ground-based telescope. A box over an area in the centre of the galaxy links by a pullout to the two right images. They both display this area larger and in more detail. The centre image shows it in visible light by the Hubble Space Telescope, the right in infrared light by the James Webb Space Telescope.\n\nThis collage features three views of Messier 106, also known as NGC 4258. The first two images show the target in visible light as seen by KPNO and the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nThe image on the right is a new image from Webb in the infrared.\n\nFeatured in this new image from Webb is Messier 106, also known as NGC 4258. This is a nearby spiral galaxy that resides roughly 23 million light-years away in the constellation Canes Venatici, practically a neighbour by cosmic standards. Messier 106 is one of the brightest and nearest spiral galaxies to our own and two supernovae have been observed in this galaxy in 1981 and 2014.\n\nPan video of Messier 106\n\nAt its heart, as in most spiral galaxies, is a supermassive black hole, but this one is particularly active. Unlike the black hole at the centre of the Milky Way, which pulls in wisps of gas only occasionally, Messier 106’s black hole is actively gobbling up material. As the gas spirals towards the black hole, it heats up and emits powerful radiation.\n\nThis image was captured with Webb’s Near-InfraRed Camera (NIRCam) [below]. This observation was taken as part of a dedicated programme to study the galaxy’s Active Galactic Nucleus, the galaxy’s bright central region that is dominated by the light emitted by dust and gas as it falls into the black hole. The blue regions in this image reflect stellar distribution throughout the central region of the galaxy. The orange regions indicate warmer dust and the stronger red hues represent colder dust. The teal, green and yellow tones near the centre of the image depict varying gas distributions throughout the region.\n\nThe galaxy has a remarkable feature – it is known to have two “anomalous” extra arms visible in radio and X-ray wavelengths, rather than in the visible. Unlike the normal arms, these are composed of hot gas instead of stars. Astronomers believe these extra arms result from the black hole’s activity, a feedback effect seen in other galaxies as well. They are likely caused by outflowing material produced by the violent churning of gas around the black hole, creating a phenomenon analogous to a wave crashing up out of the ocean when it hits a rock near the shore.\n\nDespite carrying his name, Messier 106 was neither discovered nor catalogued by the renowned 18th century astronomer Charles Messier. Discovered by his assistant, Pierre Méchain, the galaxy was never added to the catalogue in his lifetime. Along with six other objects discovered but not logged by the pair, Messier 106 was posthumously added to the Messier catalogue in the 20th century.\n\nSee the full article here .\n\nComments are invited and will be appreciated, especially if the reader finds any errors which I can correct.\n\nfive-ways-keep-your-child-safe-school-shootings\n\nPlease help promote STEM in your local schools.\n\nStem Education Coalition\n\nWebb is a large infrared telescope with a 6.5-meter primary mirror. Webb was finally launched December 25, 2021, ten years late. Webb will be the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide. It will study every phase in the history of our Universe, ranging from the first luminous glows after the Big Bang, to the formation of solar systems capable of supporting life on planets like Earth, to the evolution of our own Solar System.\n\nWebb is the world’s largest, most powerful, and most complex space science telescope ever built. Webb will solve mysteries in our solar system, look beyond to distant worlds around other stars, and probe the mysterious structures and origins of our universe and our place in it.\n\nWebb was formerly known as the “Next Generation Space Telescope” (NGST); it was renamed in Sept. 2002 after a former NASA administrator, James Webb.\n\nWebb is an international collaboration between National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center managed the development effort. The main industrial partner is Northrop Grumman; the Space Telescope Science Institute operates Webb.\n\nSeveral innovative technologies have been developed for Webb. These include a folding, segmented primary mirror, adjusted to shape after launch; ultra-lightweight beryllium optics; detectors able to record extremely weak signals, microshutters that enable programmable object selection for the spectrograph; and a cryocooler for cooling the mid-IR detectors to 7K.\n\nThere are four science instruments on Webb: The Near InfraRed Camera (NIRCam), The Near InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRspec), The Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI), and The Fine Guidance Sensor/ Near InfraRed Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (FGS-NIRISS).\n\nWebb’s instruments are designed to work primarily in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum, with some capability in the visible range. It will be sensitive to light from 0.6 to 28 micrometers in wavelength.\n\nWebb has four main science themes: The End of the Dark Ages: First Light and Reionization, The Assembly of Galaxies, The Birth of Stars and Protoplanetary Systems, and Planetary Systems and the Origins of Life.\n\nLaunch was December 25, 2021, ten years late, on an Ariane 5 rocket. The launch was from Arianespace’s ELA-3 launch complex at European Spaceport located near Kourou, French Guiana. Webb is located at the second Lagrange point, about a million miles from the Earth.\n\nNASA science is focused on better understanding Earth through the Earth Observing System, advancing heliophysics through the efforts of the Science Mission Directorate’s Heliophysics Research Program, exploring bodies throughout the Solar System with advanced robotic missions such as New Horizons, and researching astrophysics topics, such as the Big Bang, through the Great Observatories [NASA/ESA Hubble, NASA Chandra, NASA Spitzer, and associated programs.] NASA shares data with various national and international organizations such as from [JAXA]Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite.\n\nFrom Quanta Magazine\n\n8.7.24\n\nJoseph Howlett\n\nA numerical coincidence helps CO2 molecules wiggle in a certain way, trapping far more of Earth’s infrared radiation than they otherwise would. Kristina Armitage/Quanta Magazine\n\nCarbon dioxide’s powerful heat-trapping effect has been traced to a quirk of its quantum structure. The finding may explain climate change better than any computer model.\n\nIn 1896, the Swedish physicist Svante Arrhenius realized that carbon dioxide (CO2) traps heat in Earth’s atmosphere — the phenomenon now called the “greenhouse effect”. Since then, increasingly sophisticated modern climate models have verified Arrhenius’ central conclusion: that every time the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere doubles, Earth’s temperature will rise between 2 and 5 degrees Celsius.\n\nStill, the physical reason why CO2 behaves this way has remained a mystery, until recently.\n\nFirst, in 2022, physicists settled a dispute over the origin of the “logarithmic scaling” of the greenhouse effect. That refers to the way Earth’s temperature increases the same amount in response to any doubling of CO2, no matter the raw numbers.\n\nThen, this spring, a team led by Robin Wordsworth of Harvard University figured out why the CO2 molecule is so good at trapping heat in the first place. The researchers identified a strange quirk of the molecule’s quantum structure that explains why it’s such a powerful greenhouse gas — and why pumping more carbon into the sky drives climate change. The findings appeared in The Planetary Science Journal.\n\n“It’s a really nice paper,” said Raymond Pierrehumbert, an atmospheric physicist at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the work. “It’s a good answer to all those people who say that global warming is just something that comes out of impenetrable computer models.”\n\nTo the contrary, global warming is tied to a numerical coincidence involving two different ways that CO2 can wiggle.\n\n“If it weren’t for this accident,” Pierrehumbert said, “then a lot of things would be different.”\n\nAn Old Conclusion\n\nHow could Arrhenius understand the basics of the greenhouse effect before quantum mechanics was even discovered? It started with Joseph Fourier, a French mathematician and physicist who realized exactly 200 years ago that Earth’s atmosphere insulates the planet from the freezing cold of space, a discovery that launched the field of climate science. Then, in 1856, an American, Eunice Foote, observed that carbon dioxide is particularly good at absorbing radiation. Next, the Irish physicist John Tyndall measured the amount of infrared light that CO2 absorbs, showing the effect which Arrhenius then quantified using basic knowledge about Earth.\n\nEarth radiates heat in the form of infrared light. The gist of the greenhouse effect is that some of that light, instead of escaping straight to space, hits CO2 molecules in the atmosphere. A molecule absorbs the light, then re-emits it. Then another does. Sometimes the light heads back down toward the surface. Sometimes it heads up to space, leaving the Earth one iota cooler, but only after traversing a jagged path to the cold upper reaches of the atmosphere.\n\nUsing a cruder version of the same mathematical approach climate scientists take today, Arrhenius concluded that adding more CO2 would cause the planet’s surface to get warmer. It’s like adding insulation in your walls to keep your house warmer in the winter — heat from your furnace enters at the same rate, but it escapes more slowly.\n\nA few years later, however, the Swedish physicist Knut Ångström published a rebuttal. He argued that CO2 molecules only absorb a specific wavelength of infrared radiation — 15 microns. And there was already enough of the gas in the atmosphere to trap 100% of the 15-micron light Earth emits, so adding more CO2 would do nothing.\n\nWhat Ångström missed was that CO2 can absorb wavelengths slightly shorter or longer than 15 microns, though less readily. This light gets captured fewer times along its trip to space.\n\nBut that capture rate changes if the amount of carbon dioxide doubles. Now the light has twice the molecules to dodge before escaping, and it tends to get absorbed more times along the way. It escapes from a higher, colder layer of the atmosphere, so the outflow of heat slows to a trickle. It’s the heightened absorption of these near-15-micron wavelengths that’s responsible for our changing climate.\n\nDespite the mistake, Ångström’s paper threw enough doubt on Arrhenius’s theory among his contemporaries that discussion of climate change more or less exited the mainstream for half a century. Even today, skeptics of the climate change consensus sometimes cite Ångström’s erroneous carbon “saturation” argument.\n\nBack to Basics\n\nIn contrast to those early days, the modern era of climate science has moved forward largely by way of computational models that capture the many complex and chaotic facets of our messy, shifting atmosphere. For some, this makes the conclusions harder to understand.\n\n“I’ve talked to a lot of skeptical physicists, and one of their objections is ‘You guys just run computer models, and then you take the answers from this black-box calculation, and you don’t understand it deeply,’” said Nadir Jeevanjee, an atmospheric physicist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). “It’s a little unsatisfying not to be able to explain to someone on a chalkboard why we get the numbers we get.”\n\nJeevanjee and others like him have set out to build a simpler understanding of the impact of CO2 concentration on the climate.\n\nA key question was the origin of the logarithmic scaling of the greenhouse effect — the 2-to-5-degree temperature rise that models predict will happen for every doubling of CO2. One theory held that the scaling comes from how quickly the temperature drops with altitude. But in 2022, a team of researchers used a simple model to prove that the logarithmic scaling comes from the shape of carbon dioxide’s absorption “spectrum” — how its ability to absorb light varies with the light’s wavelength.\n\nThis goes back to those wavelengths that are slightly longer or shorter than 15 microns. A critical detail is that carbon dioxide is worse — but not too much worse — at absorbing light with those wavelengths. The absorption falls off on either side of the peak at just the right rate to give rise to the logarithmic scaling.\n\n“The shape of that spectrum is essential,” said David Romps, a climate physicist at the University of California, Berkeley, who co-authored the 2022 paper. “If you change it, you don’t get the logarithmic scaling.”\n\nThe carbon spectrum’s shape is unusual — most gases absorb a much narrower range of wavelengths. “The question I had at the back of my mind was: Why does it have this shape?” Romps said. “But I couldn’t put my finger on it.”\n\nConsequential Wiggles\n\nWordsworth and his co-authors Jacob Seeley and Keith Shine turned to quantum mechanics to find the answer.\n\nLight is made of packets of energy called photons. Molecules like CO2 can absorb them only when the packets have exactly the right amount of energy to bump the molecule up to a different quantum mechanical state.\n\nCarbon dioxide usually sits in its “ground state,” where its three atoms form a line with the carbon atom in the center, equidistant from the others. The molecule has “excited” states as well, in which its atoms undulate or swing about.\n\nA photon of 15-micron light contains the exact energy required to set the carbon atom swirling about the center point in a sort of hula-hoop motion. Climate scientists have long blamed this hula-hoop state for the greenhouse effect, but — as Ångström anticipated — the effect requires too precise an amount of energy, Wordsworth and his team found. The hula-hoop state can’t explain the relatively slow decline in the absorption rate for photons further from 15 microns, so it can’t explain climate change by itself.\n\nThe key, they found, is another type of motion, where the two oxygen atoms repeatedly bob toward and away from the carbon center, as if stretching and compressing a spring connecting them. This motion takes too much energy to be induced by Earth’s infrared photons on their own.\n\nBut the authors found that the energy of the stretching motion is so close to double that of the hula-hoop motion that the two states of motion mix with one another. Special combinations of the two motions exist, requiring slightly more or less than the exact energy of the hula-hoop motion.\n\nThis unique phenomenon is called “Fermi resonance” after the famous physicist Enrico Fermi, who derived it in a 1931 paper. But its connection to Earth’s climate was only made for the first time in a paper last year by Shine and his student, and the paper this spring is the first to fully lay it bare.\n\n“The moment when we wrote down the terms of this equation and saw that it all clicked together, it felt pretty incredible,” Wordsworth said. “It’s a result that finally shows us how directly the quantum mechanics links to the bigger picture.”\n\nIn some ways, he said, the calculation helps us understand climate change better than any computer model. “It just seems to be a fundamentally important thing to be able to say in a field that we can show from basic principles where everything comes from.”\n\nJoanna Haigh, an atmospheric physicist and emeritus professor at Imperial College London, agreed, saying the paper adds rhetorical power to the case for climate change by showing that it is “based on fundamental quantum mechanical concepts and established physics.”\n\nThis January, NOAA’s Global Monitoring Laboratory reported that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen from its preindustrial level of 280 parts per million to a record high 419.3 parts per million as of 2023, triggering an estimated 1 degree Celsius of warming so far.\n\nSee the full article here .\n\nComments are invited and will be appreciated, especially if the reader finds any errors which I can correct.\n\nfive-ways-keep-your-child-safe-school-shootings\n\nPlease help promote STEM in your local schools.\n\nStem Education Coalition\n\nFormerly known as Simons Science News, Quanta Magazine is an editorially independent online publication launched by the Simons Foundation to enhance public understanding of science.

But for a second, let’s imagine you could… How would you go about forming, feeding, and nurturing a supermassive black hole of your own? This handy guide will teach you everything you need to know!\n\n_______________________________\n\nWhat you’ll discover in this blog post:\n\nThe anatomy of a black hole\n\nFormation theories for supermassive black holes\n\nHow supermassive black holes power active galactic nuclei and quasars\n\n_______________________________\n\nBefore We Begin: What is a Black Hole?\n\nIllustrations of black holes in the media tend to show a mysterious, dark sphere, vacuuming any matter that dares to stray too close — but how accurate is this portrayal? Before we begin, let’s examine the anatomy of a black hole to understand exactly how dangerous this new hobby may be.\n\nIn large objects, like stars, there is always a crushing inwards pressure from gravity that aims to collapse the object in on itself, and this pressure grows stronger the denser an object gets. When matter is crushed compactly enough, gravity becomes a runaway effect, unstoppably collapsing the object into an increasingly tighter space until it reaches an infinite density: a singularity. This is the heart of a black hole.\n\nIn this region of space, the gravitational strength is so great that even light cannot escape it. The point of no return — the distance where rescue is no longer possible — is called the event horizon.\n\nBut step back, beyond what we call the ‘innermost stable orbit’, and the risk of falling is gone. Objects at this distance orbit the black hole the same way they would a star of the same mass — but with a lack of heat or light. Not that this makes this environment any safer: as we’ll see later, black holes are often surrounded by deadly radiation…\n\nThis inability to release or reflect light is the origin of both the ‘black’ hole name, and their traditional depiction as a mysterious black sphere vacuuming the cosmos. To an observing telescope, they are invisible except for the distortive effect they have on the cosmos around them — like a magnifying lens floating through space.\n\nIf this was the only sign of a black hole, they would be very difficult to detect. Luckily, black holes interact with their environment to produce many other signals of their presence, and these are especially noticeable in the case of supermassive black holes. Often, they are surrounded by rings of dust and gas caught in their gravitational orbit called accretion discs, which we’ll discuss further later in this guide.\n\nNot all black holes are alike. Some are just a few times more massive than the Sun, but others are billions of times more massive, So: how can you get a black hole that big?\n\nStep 1a: Growing a Supermassive Black Hole\n\nFor the best quality supermassive black hole, consider an organic, home-grown option. Astronomers believe supermassive black holes may originate from ‘seed’ black holes in the early eras of the Universe that eventually grew to incredible sizes. But how these early seeds formed and just how massive they were remains uncertain.\n\nThese seeds would have started much smaller than the monsters we see today, born perhaps from the collapse of massive stars. Stellar-mass black holes still form this way today, and comprise most of the black holes in the Universe. Just recently, ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) [below] helped verify the most massive stellar black hole in the Milky Way, a bulky 33 times the mass of our Sun. The very first stars that formed in the early Universe are thought to be much more massive than the ones we see today, and could have left behind more massive black holes after they died.\n\nThere are potentially millions of these stellar-mass black holes living alongside us in the Milky Way galaxy. But for one of them to grow into a supermassive black hole, they would need access to a lot of food — meaning, they needed to be placed into a dusty galaxy. Astronomers believe the lucky black holes that found themselves in these types of galaxies in the early Universe were able to gobble up vast reservoirs of cold hydrogen gas, rapidly gaining mass and eventually inflating to the immense sizes of the supermassive giants we see today. One of these reservoirs was even observed around an early supermassive black hole by ESO’s VLT in 2019.\n\nWhen a black hole ‘eats’ matter in this way, it’s called accretion. But accretion is a very slow way for a stellar black hole to become supermassive, and some evidence suggests that accretion alone could not account for the masses of some supermassive black holes we see in the timespan of the Universe. So, how else can black holes grow?\n\nIn the nuclei of galaxies, pairs of black holes can orbit each other tightly, slowly losing energy, shrinking their orbit until they eventually become close enough to merge. In one of the most extreme and energetic events in the Universe, the two black holes dance around each other at speeds close to the speed of light, combining into one remnant black hole. This typically takes place between stellar mass black holes, but in some cases, entire galaxies with black holes at their cores can merge, leaving one chaotic galaxy with an enormous supermassive black hole at its centre.\n\nClose-up and wide views of the nearest pair of supermassive black holes\n\nThis image shows close-up (left) and wide (right) views of the two bright galactic nuclei, each housing a supermassive black hole, in NGC 7727, a galaxy located 89 million light-years away from Earth in the constellation Aquarius. Each nucleus consists of a dense group of stars with a supermassive black hole at its centre. The two black holes are on a collision course and form the closest pair of supermassive black holes found to date. It is also the pair with the smallest separation between two supermassive black holes found to date — observed to be just 1600 light-years apart in the sky.\n\nThe image on the left was taken with the MUSE instrument on ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) at the Paranal Observatory in Chile while the one on the right was taken with ESO’s VLT Survey Telescope [below].\n\nCredit: Voggel et al.; ESO/; ESO/VST ATLAS team. Acknowledgement: Durham University/CASU/WFAU\n\nWhile stellar mass black holes may have been the seeds that later grew into more massive black holes, astronomers also think that gigantic clouds of gas in the early Universe could have collapsed directly into a black hole without forming a star first. If you want to try this alternative method to grow a black hole, you will need to gather several hundred thousand solar masses worth of gas.\n\nOnce your black hole has grown to a few hundreds of thousands times the mass of the Sun, you’re ready to move on to step two: lighting up your black hole. If for any reason you are unable to grow a supermassive black hole at home, check your local Universe for ready-made options.\n\nStep 1b: Hunting down a Black Hole\n\nThere are many impressive spectacles a supermassive black hole can display, making them easy to find in the local Universe. One, that we mentioned earlier, is their glowing accretion discs.\n\nThese accretion discs are flattened clouds of gas orbiting the black hole, which – close to the centre – are flung at such high speeds around the black hole that they become superheated and glow in many wavelengths of light. Incredibly, when the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration was able to take the first images of black holes, these were responsible for the iconic blazing, dusty rings seen in the images.\n\n____________________________________\n\nEvent Horizon telescope\n\n____________________________________\n\nThere have also been observations of supermassive black holes devouring nearby stars, resulting in incredible explosions as the stars release their last light. ESO telescopes were able to witness one of these rare displays in 2016, and again in 2020. A similar event observed by the VLT in 2022 showed rare bursts of extreme plasma jets, expelling the leftovers of the stellar meal: a supermassive belch.\n\nSome supermassive black holes go beyond these spectacles to become some of the brightest objects in the Universe —- in the next section, we’ll discuss how to get your own supermassive black hole this bright.\n\nStep 2: Let There Be Light!\n\nWhile all supermassive black holes are impressive, only some of them power immensely bright active galactic nuclei, or AGN. Even the mammoth at the centre of our own galaxy, Sagittarius A*, doesn’t qualify. In this step, we detail how to get your supermassive black hole to be amongst the biggest and brightest in the Universe.\n\nAstronomers use AGN to describe supermassive black holes that are especially greedy, gorging on immense amounts of dust from their accretion disks and sometimes spitting out incredible blasts, called jets, at near-light speed. A stunning image of an AGN, Centaurus A, and its jets was captured by APEX [below] in 2009.\n\nColour composite image of Centaurus A, revealing the lobes and jets emanating from the active galaxy’s central black hole. This is a composite of images obtained with three instruments, operating at very different wavelengths. The 870-micron submillimetre data, from LABOCA on APEX, are shown in orange. X-ray data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory are shown in blue. Visible light data from the Wide Field Imager (WFI) on the MPG/ESO 2.2 m telescope located at La Silla, Chile, show the stars and the galaxy’s characteristic dust lane in close to “true colour”. Credit: A.Weiss et al./ESO/WFI (Optical); MPIfR/ESO/APEX/ (Submillimetre); R.Kraft et al. /NASA/CXC/CfA/(X-ray)\n\nOne model suggests that depending on how the AGN is orientated with respect to Earth, the same supermassive black hole can look much brighter or dimmer. The accretion disc sitting around the spherical black hole takes on a similar silhouette to Saturn and its rings. To ensure your own AGN appears more luminous, you should orient the black hole so that as little of the accretion disc obscures it from an observer on Earth as possible. Astronomers refer to AGN that face towards Earth in this way as quasars.\n\nIn 2024, ESO’s VLT made the incredible observation of a quasar that shattered expectations — not only was it the most luminous quasar ever discovered, but the brightest object ever observed in the Universe.\n\nUsing the European Southern Observatory’s (ESO) Very Large Telescope (VLT), astronomers have characterised a bright quasar, finding it to be not only the brightest of its kind, but also the most luminous object ever observed. Quasars are the bright cores of distant galaxies and they are powered by supermassive black holes. The black hole in this record-breaking quasar is growing in mass by the equivalent of one Sun per day, making it the fastest-growing black hole to date.\n\nPowering it is a behemoth supermassive black hole eating the equivalent of the Sun in mass every single day, making it the fastest-growing black hole seen to date.\n\nEven better, if your supermassive black hole releases a jet, ensure the jet is pointed directly towards Earth. (We recommend having a parent or trusted adult supervise this step.) If done correctly, the blazing plasma itself will not reach astronomers, but the observation will likely be brighter than anything they’ve seen before. AGN in this specific orientation are upgraded from quasars to blazars, and can theoretically be seen from billions of light-years away.\n\nStep 3: Profit?\n\nSupermassive black holes are some of the most interesting objects in the Universe. There is so much left to learn about how they interact with their surrounding galaxies, influence the formation of stars around them, and how they grew so incredibly massive — especially since the cosmos seems to lack black holes in the tremendous mass gap between stellar and supermassive.\n\nESO’s Extremely Large Telescope [below] hopes to uncover the complex relationships between supermassive black holes and central star formation in galaxies, as well as tracing back the formation of supermassive black holes in the early Universe, when it sees first light later this decade. Until then, enjoy your homemade supermassive black hole!\n\nSee the full article here .\n\nComments are invited and will be appreciated, especially if the reader finds any errors which I can correct.\n\nfive-ways-keep-your-child-safe-school-shootings\n\nPlease help promote STEM in your local schools.\n\nStem Education Coalition\n\nVisit ESO (EU) in Social Media-\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nYouTube\n\nEuropean Southern Observatory [La Observatorio Europeo Austral] [Observatoire européen austral][Europäische Südsternwarte] (EU) is the foremost intergovernmental astronomy organisation in Europe and the world’s most productive ground-based astronomical observatory by far.

VISTA works in the infrared and is the world’s largest survey telescope and the VLT Survey Telescope is the largest telescope designed to exclusively survey the skies in visible light. ESO is a major partner in ALMA, the largest astronomical project in existence.

Image credit: S. Dagnello/NSF, AUI, NSF NRAO.\n\nAn international team of astronomers have used a powerful array of radio telescopes to discover new insights about a magnetar that’s only a few hundred years old. By capturing precise measurements of the magnetar’s position and velocity, new clues emerge regarding its developmental path.\n\nWhen a relatively high-mass star collapses at the end of its life and explodes as a supernova, it can leave behind a superdense star called a neutron star.\n\nExtreme forces during its formation often cause neutron stars to spin very rapidly, shining out beams of light like a lighthouse. When that beam is aligned such that it is visible from Earth, the star is also called a pulsar.\n\nAnd, when a neutron star forms with fast pulsar-like spin and a magnetic field thousands of times stronger than a typical neutron star, it’s given the designation magnetar.\n\nThese stars pack roughly double the mass of our Sun into a physical size on the scale of tens of kilometers— the size of a city.\n\nEven though there are many similarities between neutron stars, pulsars, and magnetars, astronomers are still puzzled by what conditions cause these extreme stars to evolve onto such distinct paths.\n\nNow, a team of astronomers led by Hao Ding of the Mizusawa VLBI Observatory, National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, have used the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) National Radio Astronomy Observatory’s (NRAO) Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) [below] to determine key characteristics of a newly-discovered magnetar to unprecedented levels of precision.\n\nAt present, there are 30 confirmed magnetars, but only 8 of these are similar enough to be relevant to this study. Ding and his team used the NSF VLBA over a period of 3 years to collect data on the position and velocity of the magnetar Swift J1818.0-1617, which was discovered in early 2020. Swift J1818.0-1617 is believed to be the youngest discovered thus far, and it is the fastest-spinning magnetar, rotating with a spin period of 1.36 seconds.\n\nSwift J1818.0-1617 is located in the constellation Sagittarius. Situated on the other side of the central galactic bulge—within the Milky Way galaxy—and only 22,000 light years away, its position is relatively close to Earth. Close enough, in fact, to utilize the parallax method to accurately determine its three-dimensional location within the galaxy. (The parallax method calculates distance by using the apparent change in an object’s position with respect to known, distant background objects.)\n\nThe lifespan of a magnetar is unknown at this time, but astronomers estimate that Swift J1818.0-1617 is only a few hundred years old. A magnetar’s bright x-ray emissions necessitate a mechanism of extremely high energy outflow; only the rapid decay of its intense magnetic field can explain the power behind these spectral signatures. But that, too, is an extreme process. For ordinary stars on the main sequence, bright blue stars live very short lives because they burn through their fuel far faster than their yellow siblings. The physics is different for magnetars, but they, too, likely have shorter lifespans than their pulsar relatives. “Magnetars are very young, because they cannot continue giving off energy at this rate for very long,” Ding explains.\n\nIn addition, magnetars can also exhibit emissions at the low end of the electromagnetic spectrum—in radio wavelengths. For these, synchrotron radiation from the magnetar’s fast spin is likely the energy source. In synchrotron radiation, plasma surrounding the neutron star itself is so tightly wrapped against the star’s surface that it rotates at very nearly the speed of light, generating emissions in radio wavelengths. These radio emissions were then detected by the NSF VLBA over three years of observations.\n\n“The VLBA provided us with superb angular resolution for measuring this teeny-tiny parallax,” Ding says. “The spatial resolution is unparalleled.”\n\nThe results, published August 2024, detail Swift J1818.0-1617’s parallax as among the smallest for neutron stars, and its so-called transverse velocity as the smallest—a new lower limit—among magnetars.\n\nVelocity in astronomy is most easily described as having two components, or directions. Its radial velocity describes how fast it is moving along the line of sight, which in this case means along the radius of the galaxy. For a magnetar such as Swift J1818.0-1617, located on the other side of the central bulge, there is too much other material in the way to precisely determine radial velocity. Transverse velocity, sometimes called peculiar velocity, describes motion perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy, and is more readily discernible.\n\nAs astronomers try to understand the formation processes that are common—and those that are different—between “regular” neutron stars, pulsars, and magnetars, they hope to use precise measurements of transverse velocity to help parse out conditions that cause a star to evolve down one of these three paths.\n\nDing says that this study adds weight to the theory that magnetars are unlikely to form under the same conditions as young pulsars, thus suggesting that magnetars come into being under more exotic formation processes.\n\n“We need to know how fast the magnetar was moving when it was just born,” says Ding. The formation mechanism of magnetars is still a mystery we would like to understand.”\n\nSee the full article here .\n\nComments are invited and will be appreciated, especially if the reader finds any errors which I can correct.\n\nfive-ways-keep-your-child-safe-school-shootings\n\nPlease help promote STEM in your local schools.\n\nStem Education Coalition\n\nThe National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of The National Science Foundation, operated under cooperative agreement by The Associated Universities, Inc.\n\nNational Radio Astronomy Observatory Karl G Jansky Very Large Array located in central New Mexico on the Plains of San Agustin, between the towns of Magdalena and Datil, ~50 miles (80 km) west of Socorro.

In addition, the group found that the gamma-ray line evolves as a power-law function of time, providing critical clues to unveil the mystery of the line. The study was published in Science China Physics, Mechanics & Astronomy.\n\nGamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most energetic explosion phenomena in the universe, which can be produced by either the core collapse of a massive star or the collision of two compact stars, such as neutron stars and black holes. This discovery was made on the so-called brightest of all time GRB, named GRB 221009A, which belongs to the former category and arrived at the Earth on October 9th, 2022, and was observed by many telescopes all over the world.\n\nFig. 1: Radio light curves of GRB 22109A between 3 and 18 GHz.\n\nLeft: AMI-LA observations of GRB 221009A for the first 5 d after the burst. Due to the high flux density in the first observation (between T0 + 3.1 h and T0 + 7.1 h) we are able to split the data into 15 min time bins for each of the eight quick-look spectral windows and derive flux density values directly from the complex visibilities. After the first day we derive fluxes from the image plane, using the top and bottom halves of the AMI-LA observing band to monitor any spectral index evolution. See Methods* for details of the data reduction process. Right: Allen Telescope Array observations of GRB 221009A for the first 5 d after the burst showing an early-time peak most evident at 3 and 5 GHz (and tentatively seen at 8 GHz). All flux densities are derived from the image plane; see Methods* for details of the data reduction process and imaging creation and processing. Error bars represent 1σ uncertainties.\n\n*Science paper reference. See the science paper.\n\nFig. 2: Early-time radio light curves and spectral index evolution of GRB 221009A.\n\nTop: our first observation of GRB 221009A with the AMI-LA, separated into eight frequency channels and the flux density derived in 15 min time intervals as well the 3 and 5 GHz light curves from the Allen Telescope Array. Bottom: the two-point spectral index (see the science paper*), (see the science paper*)where ν1 and ν2 are the lower and upper frequencies used to calculate the two-point spectral index, respectively) measured between the highest and lowest of the eight AMI-LA quick-look frequency channels and the two Allen Telescope Array bands. Clear evolution can be seen throughout the observations, with the spectral index initially consistent with optically thick synchrotron emission (α ≈ 2.5) and flattening with time. This is indicative of a break frequency (probably the self-absorption break) beginning to move into the AMI-LA observing band and then through the Allen Telescope Array observing bands. We mark the location of α = 2.5 and α = 0 with dashed horizontal lines to aid the reader. Error bars represent 1σ uncertainties.\n\n*would not copy and paste. See the science paper\n\nResearchers from the IHEP, the Yunnan Observatories of CAS, Hebei Normal University, and Guizhou Normal University have formed a collaboration team and executed a comprehensive analysis of the observation data from two space gamma-ray monitors named GECAM-C and Fermi/GBM. The CAS-funded GECAM-C provided an accurate measurement of the low energy band spectrum of this GRB, while the Fermi/GBM covered the high energy band where the gamma-ray line showed up.\n\nIn particular, this burst is so bright (too many gamma-ray photons in a short period of time) that the Fermi/GBM detector suffered data loss during the bright part of the burst, making reliable data analysis very difficult. Fortunately, GECAM-C did not experience such a problem thanks to its dedicated design of the instrument; thus, the GECAM-C data was used to correct the Fermi/GBM data.\n\nAfter the very challenging analyses of the data issues, instrumental effects, and background modeling, researchers managed to derive the reliable spectra of this GRB and further identified a series of gamma-ray lines throughout the burst, including the surprising gamma-ray line with energy up to 37 million electron-volts detected during the bright part of the burst. Interestingly, they found the line energy varies as a power-law function of time, while the ratio of the line width to line energy remains almost constant. Such features provided solid proof of the reality and the GRB origin of these gamma-ray lines.\n\nThe discoveries of this study shed new light on the physics of GRBs and their relativistic jets.\n\nSee the full article here .\n\nComments are invited and will be appreciated, especially if the reader finds any errors which I can correct.\n\nfive-ways-keep-your-child-safe-school-shootings\n\nPlease help promote STEM in your local schools.\n\nStem Education Coalition\n\nThe Institute of High Energy Physics [IHEP] (CN) a Chinese Academy of Sciences research institute, is China’s biggest laboratory for the study of particle physics.

It has historical origins in the Academia Sinica during the Republican era and was formerly also known by that name. Collectively known as the “Two Academies (两院)” along with the Chinese Academy of Engineering, it functions as the national scientific think tank and academic governing body, providing advisory and appraisal services on issues stemming from the national economy, social development, and science and technology progress. It is headquartered in Xicheng District, Beijing, with branch institutes all over mainland China. It has also created hundreds of commercial enterprises, Lenovo being one of the most famous.\n\nIt is the world’s largest research organization, comprising around 60,000 researchers working in 114 institutes, and has been consistently ranked among the top research organizations around the world. It also holds the The University of Science and Technology of China [电子科技大学](CN) and the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe Chinese Academy of Sciences has been ranked the No. 1 research institute in the world by Nature Index since the list’s inception in 2016 by Nature Portfolio. It is the most productive institution publishing articles of sustainable development indexed in Web of Science among all universities and research institutions in the world.\n\nThe Chinese Academy of Sciences has six academic divisions:\n\nChemistry (化学部)\n\nInformation Technological Sciences (信息技术科学部)\n\nEarth Sciences (地学部)\n\nLife Sciences and Medical Sciences (生命科学和医学学部)\n\nMathematics and Physics (数学物理学部)\n\nTechnological Sciences (技术科学部)\n\nThe CAS has thirteen regional branches, in Beijing, Shenyang, Changchun, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Kunming, Xi’an, Lanzhou, Hefei and Xinjiang. It has over one hundred institutes and four universities (the University of Science and Technology of China at Hefei, Anhui, the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, ShanghaiTech University, and Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology). Backed by the institutes of CAS, UCAS is headquartered in Beijing, with graduate education bases in Shanghai, Chengdu, Wuhan, Guangzhou and Lanzhou, four Science Libraries of Chinese Academy of Sciences, three technology support centers and two news and publishing units.

Credit: W. M. Keck Observatory/Adam Makarenko\n\nIt may seem like the Sun is stationary while the planets in its orbit are moving, but the Sun is actually orbiting around the Milky Way galaxy at an impressive rate of about 220 kilometers per second — almost half a million miles per hour.\n\nAs swift as that may seem, when a faint red star was discovered moving even faster across the sky, clocking in at a speed of about 1.3 million miles per hour (600 kilometers per second), scientists took notice.\n\nThis rare stellar speedster is the first “hypervelocity” very low mass star found, thanks to the efforts of citizen scientists and a team of astronomers from around the country using several telescopes, including two in Hawaiʻi – W. M. Keck Observatory on Maunakea, Hawaiʻi Island and the University of Hawaiʻi Institute for Astronomy Pan-STARRS on Haleakalā, Maui.\n\nLocated just 400 light-years from Earth, it is the nearest known hypervelocity star to us.\n\nMore remarkably, this star may be on an unusual trajectory that could cause it to leave the Milky Way altogether.\n\nThe research, led by University of California (UC) San Diego Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics Adam Burgasser, has recently been accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\nThe star, named CWISE J124909+362116.0 (or “J1249+36” for short), was first spotted by some of the over 80,000 citizen science volunteers participating in the Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 project, who comb through enormous reams of data collected over the past 14 years by NASA’s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mission.\n\nThis project capitalizes on the keen ability of humans, who are evolutionarily programmed to look for patterns and spot anomalies in a way that is unmatched by computer technology. Volunteers tag moving objects in data files and when enough volunteers tag the same object, astronomers investigate.\n\nJ1249+36 immediately stood out because it was moving at about .1 percent the speed of light.\n\n“This is where the source became very interesting, as its speed and trajectory showed that it was moving fast enough to potentially escape the Milky Way,” says Burgasser.\n\nTo better understand the nature of this object, Burgasser turned to Keck Observatory’s Near-Infrared Echellette Spectrograph (NIRES) [below] and measured its infrared spectrum. The data revealed the object was an L subdwarf — a class of stars with very low masses and cooler temperatures than our Sun. Subdwarfs represent the oldest stars in the Milky Way.\n\nThe team compared Keck Observatory’s insight into J1249+36’s composition with a new set of atmosphere models created by UC San Diego alumnus Roman Gerasimov, who worked with UC LEADS scholar Efrain Alvarado III to generate models specifically tuned to study L subdwarfs.\n\n“It was exciting to see that our models were able to accurately match the spectrum obtained with Keck’s NIRES,” says Alvarado.\n\nThe spectral data, along with imaging data from Pan-STARRS and several other ground-based telescopes, allowed the team to accurately measure J1249+36’s position and velocity in space, and thereby predict its orbit through the Milky Way.\n\nWhat gave this star a kick?\n\nResearchers focused on two possible scenarios to explain J1249+36’s unusual trajectory.\n\nIn the first scenario, J1249+36 was originally the low-mass companion of a white dwarf.\n\nWhite dwarfs are the remnant cores of stars that have depleted their nuclear fuel and died out. When a stellar companion is in a very close orbit with a white dwarf, it can transfer mass, resulting in periodic outbursts called novae. If the white dwarf collects too much mass, it can collapse and explode as a supernova.\n\n“In this kind of supernova, the white dwarf is completely destroyed, so its companion is released and flies off at whatever orbital speed it was originally moving, plus a little bit of a kick from the supernova explosion as well,” says Burgasser. “Our calculations show this scenario works. However, the white dwarf isn’t there anymore and the remnants of the explosion, which likely happened several million years ago, have already dissipated, so we don’t have definitive proof that this is its origin.”\n\nIn the second scenario, J1249+36 was originally a member of a globular cluster, a tightly bound cluster of stars, immediately recognizable by its distinct spherical shape. The centers of these clusters are predicted to contain black holes of a wide range of masses. These black holes can also form binaries, and such systems turn out to be great catapults for any stars that happen to wander too close to them.\n\n“When a star encounters a black hole binary, the complex dynamics of this three-body interaction can toss that star right out of the globular cluster,” says Kyle Kremer, incoming Assistant Professor in UC San Diego’s Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics.\n\nArtist’s simulation of another possible explanation for CWISE J124909+362116.0’s speed. In this scenario, the L subdwarf may have been a part of a globular cluster, then had a close encounter with a binary pair of black holes that hurled it out of the system. Credit: W. M. Keck Observatory/ Adam Makarenko\n\nKremer ran a series of simulations and found that on rare occasions these kinds of interactions can kick a low-mass subdwarf out of a globular cluster and on a trajectory similar to that observed for J1249+36.\n\n“It demonstrates a proof of concept,” says Kremer, “but we don’t actually know what globular cluster this star is from.” Tracing J1249+36 back in time puts it in a very crowded part of the sky that may hide undiscovered clusters.\n\nTo determine whether either of these scenarios, or some other mechanism, can explain J1249+36’s trajectory, Burgasser said the team hopes to look more closely at its elemental composition. For example, when a white dwarf explodes, it creates heavy elements that could have “polluted” the atmosphere of J1249+36 as it was escaping. The stars in globular clusters and satellite galaxies of the Milky Way also have distinct element abundance patterns that may reveal the origin of J1249+36.\n\n“We’re essentially looking for a chemical fingerprint that would pinpoint what system this star is from,” said Gerasimov, whose modeling work has enabled him to measure the element abundances of cool stars in several globular clusters.\n\nWhether J1249+36’s speedy journey was because of a supernova, a chance encounter with a black hole binary, or some other scenario, its discovery provides a new opportunity for astronomers to learn more about the history and dynamics of the Milky Way.\n\nSee the full article here .\n\nComments are invited and will be appreciated, especially if the reader finds any errors which I can correct.\n\nfive-ways-keep-your-child-safe-school-shootings\n\nPlease help promote STEM in your local schools.\n\nStem Education Coalition\n\nMission\n\nTo advance the frontiers of astronomy and share our discoveries with the world.\n\nThe W. M. Keck Observatory operates the largest, most scientifically productive telescopes on Earth. The two, 10-meter optical/infrared telescopes on the summit of Maunakea on the Island of Hawai’i feature a suite of advanced instruments including imagers, multi-object spectrographs, high-resolution spectrographs, integral-field spectrometer and world-leading laser guide star adaptive optics systems. Keck Observatory is a private 501(c) 3 non-profit organization and a scientific partnership of the California Institute of Technology, the University of California and NASA.\n\nToday Keck Observatory is supported by both public funding sources and private philanthropy. As a 501(c)3, the organization is managed by The California Association for Research in Astronomy(CARA), whose Board of Directors includes representatives from the California Institute of Technologyand the University of California with liaisons to the board from The National Aeronautics and Space Agency and the Keck Foundation.\n\nInstrumentation\n\nKeck 1\n\nHIRES – The largest and most mechanically complex of the Keck’s main instruments, the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer breaks up incoming starlight into its component colors to measure the precise intensity of each of thousands of color channels. Its spectral capabilities have resulted in many breakthrough discoveries, such as the detection of planets outside our solar system and direct evidence for a model of the Big Bang theory.\n\nVISIBLE BAND (0.3-1.0 Micron)\n\nMOSFIRE – The Multi-Object Spectrograph for Infrared Exploration gathers thousands of spectra from objects spanning a variety of distances, environments and physical conditions. What makes this huge, vacuum-cryogenic instrument unique is its ability to select up to 46 individual objects in the field of view and then record the infrared spectrum of all 46 objects simultaneously. When a new field is selected, a robotic mechanism inside the vacuum chamber reconfigures the distribution of tiny slits in the focal plane in under six minutes. Eight years in the making with First Light in 2012, MOSFIRE’s early performance results range from the discovery of ultra-cool, nearby substellar mass objects, to the detection of oxygen in young galaxies only 2 billion years after the Big Bang.\n\nKeck/MOSFIRE on Keck 1.\n\nKeck 2\n\nDEIMOS – The Deep Extragalactic Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph is the most advanced optical spectrograph in the world, capable of gathering spectra from 130 galaxies or more in a single exposure. In ‘Mega Mask’ mode, DEIMOS can take spectra of more than 1,200 objects at once, using a special narrow-band filter.\n\nKeck/DEIMOS on Keck 2.\n\nNIRSPEC – The Near Infrared Spectrometer studies very high redshift radio galaxies, the motions and types of stars located near the Galactic Center, the nature of brown dwarfs, the nuclear regions of dusty starburst galaxies, active galactic nuclei, interstellar chemistry, stellar physics, and solar-system science.\n\nESI – The Echellette Spectrograph and Imager captures high-resolution spectra of very faint galaxies and quasars ranging from the blue to the infrared in a single exposure. It is a multimode instrument that allows users to switch among three modes during a night. It has produced some of the best non-AO images at the Observatory.\n\nKCWI – The Keck Cosmic Web Imager now with KCRM – The Keck Cosmic Web Imager now with the Keck Cosmic Reionization Mapper is designed to provide visible band, integral field spectroscopy with moderate to high spectral resolution, various fields of view and image resolution formats and excellent sky-subtraction. The astronomical seeing and large aperture of the telescope enables studies of the connection between galaxies and the gas in their dark matter halos, stellar relics, star clusters and lensed galaxies.\n\nKeck Cosmic Web Imager on Keck 2 schematic.\n\nNEAR-INFRARED (1-5 Micron)\n\nADAPTIVE OPTICS – Adaptive optics senses and compensates for the atmospheric distortions of incoming starlight up to 1,000 times per second. This results in an improvement in image quality on fairly bright astronomical targets by a factor 10 to 20.\n\nLASER GUIDE STAR ADAPTIVE OPTICS [pictured above] – The Keck Laser Guide Star expands the range of available targets for study with both the Keck I and Keck II adaptive optics systems. They use sodium lasers to excite sodium atoms that naturally exist in the atmosphere 90 km (55 miles) above the Earth’s surface. The laser creates an “artificial star” that allows the Keck adaptive optics system to observe 70-80 percent of the targets in the sky, compared to the 1 percent accessible without the laser.\n\nNIRC-2/AO – The second generation Near Infrared Camera works with the Keck Adaptive Optics system to produce the highest-resolution ground-based images and spectroscopy in the 1-5 micron range. Typical programs include mapping surface features on solar system bodies, searching for planets around other stars, and analyzing the morphology of remote galaxies.\n\nABOUT NIRES\n\nThe Near Infrared Echellette Spectrograph (NIRES) is a prism cross-dispersed near-infrared spectrograph built at the California Institute of Technology by a team led by Chief Instrument Scientist Keith Matthews and Prof. Tom Soifer. Commissioned in 2018, NIRES covers a large wavelength range at moderate spectral resolution for use on the Keck II telescope and observes extremely faint red objects found with the Spitzer and WISE infrared space telescopes, as well as brown dwarfs, high-redshift galaxies, and quasars.\n\nNow on the KCWI on Keck 2\n\nKCRM – The Keck Cosmic Reionization Mapper will complete the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI), the world’s most capable spectroscopic imager. The design for KCWI includes two separate channels to detect light in the blue and the red portions of the visible wavelength spectrum. KCWI-Blue was commissioned and started routine science observations in September 2017. The red channel of KCWI is KCRM; a powerful addition that will open a window for new discoveries at high redshifts.\n\nKPF – The Keck Planet Finder (KPF) will be the most advanced spectrometer of its kind in the world. The instrument is a fiber-fed high-resolution, two-channel cross-dispersed echelle spectrometer for the visible wavelengths and is designed for the Keck II telescope. KPF allows precise measurements of the mass-density relationship in Earth-like exoplanets, which will help astronomers identify planets around other stars that are capable of supporting life.\n\nFrom BBC (UK)\n\n8.8.24\n\nPhil Mercer | BBC News, Sydney\n\nPaul Barrett’s firm has developed tech to make cheaper “green hydrogen”. Hysata\n\n“If you remember being a kid and blowing up a balloon or into a milkshake, your cheeks got sore because there is an energy penalty associated with bubble formation.”\n\nPaul Barrett, the Dublin-born chief executive of the Australian green energy firm Hysata, is explaining the plan to create the cheapest hydrogen in the world – by eliminating bubbles.\n\nThe company, based at Port Kembla, an industrial hub south of Sydney, is using a familiar process known as electrolysis, which involves passing electricity through water to split it into hydrogen and oxygen.\n\nBut Hysata has developed a special material which sits in the water and which it says makes its electrolyzer much more efficient than competing products.\n\nThe company says it can produce a kilo of hydrogen using 20% less electricity than conventional methods.\n\nHydrogen is the most abundant element on the planet and, crucially, when used as a fuel or in industrial processes it does not produce carbon dioxide (CO2).\n\nMany see hydrogen as the answer to cutting carbon dioxide emissions, particularly in heavy industry like steel-making and chemical production.\n\nHydrogen production comes in four varieties – “green”, “grey”, “blue’ and “black”.\n\nThe green variety is produced with renewable energy, grey comes from splitting methane into carbon dioxide and hydrogen, while blue is made in the same way, but the CO2 by-product is captured and stored.\n\nThe production of black hydrogen comes from partially burning coal.\n\nBut if there is to be a transition to green hydrogen then its supply needs to be massively increased.\n\n“Ensuring you have the production of green hydrogen close enough to the demand point and being able to regulate the supply of that is probably the biggest challenge,” explains Dr Liam Wagner, an associate professor at Curtin University in Adelaide.\n\n“The efficiency of production and the amount of energy required to run these processes is the biggest frontier.”\n\nIt’s hoped green hydrogen can reduce the carbon footprint of heavy industry. Getty Images\n\nAustralia is rich in natural resources and has long been the world’s quarry. It’s an export-driven nation; its coal has helped to power Japan, while its iron ore has underpinned much of China’s growth. Many hope that hydrogen could follow.\n\n“The prospects for hydrogen are as a way of exporting energy to countries that can’t produce enough of their own either as hydrogen in a liquid form or as ammonia, which I think is the most likely,” Dr Wagner adds.\n\nHysata hopes to play a part in that. Its device was initially invented by researchers at the University of Wollongong in the state of New South Wales.\n\nIn a conventional electrolizer, bubbles in the water can be clingy and stick to the electrodes, clogging up the process and leading to energy loss.\n\nBy using a sponge-like material between the electrodes, Hysata eliminates those troublesome bubbles.\n\n“It is not unlike your kitchen sponge in terms of what it does. It is just a lot thinner,” says Mr Barrett.\n\n“It’s pretty easy to manufacture at a super low cost,” he adds.\n\nCost and efficiency have been major hurdles for the hydrogen sector, but Hysata has recently raised US$111m (£87m) in investment to beef up its production.\n\nDr Ema Frery (right) is investigating capturing naturally produced hydrogen. Ema Frery\n\n“What we are speaking about is natural hydrogen which is coming directly from the earth,” explains Dr Ema Frery, a research team leader at CSIRO, Australia’s national science agency.\n\n“A lot of rocks that are in Australia can produce hydrogen. We have a lot of old granites that are now close to the subsurface and can generate hydrogen through radiogenic processes.”\n\nSo-called “geogenic hydrogen’ is also known as “white” or “gold” hydrogen.\n\nDr Frery, a French-born geoscientist based in Western Australia, is investigating how it might be extracted, stored and used in an economically viable way.\n\n“A conventional hydrogen system can consist of a rock capable of generating hydrogen at a given rate, migration pathways and a reservoir where the hydrogen can be stored.\n\n“Surface seeps at the top of the reservoir can indicate the presence of a hydrogen system at depth,” she says. “It is happening in other countries. In Mali, people have been extracting natural hydrogen from the ground for more than ten years to produce electricity for a local village.”\n\nDespite the research work, some doubt that hydrogen will become a big export for Australia.\n\nOne of those is the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), a global research organization which advocates the use of renewable energy.\n\nExporting hydrogen from Australia would “make no financial sense”, according to Amandine Denis-Ryan, the chief executive of the IEEFA in Australia.\n\n“Hydrogen shipping would be prohibitively expensive. It requires extremely low temperatures and large volumes, and involves high losses. Using hydrogen locally makes much more sense.”\n\nShe hopes that government funding will not be “wasted” on such projects.\n\nLike bubbles on electrodes, new technologies and processes invariably hit sticky patches where progress is hindered and doubts amplified, but the architects of hydrogen’s advance are confident it has a key part to play in our energy transition.\n\nBahman Shabani, a professor at RMIT University’s School of Engineering in Melbourne, is working to store surplus renewable energy using an electrolyzer, a storage tank and a fuel cell that together act like a battery.\n\n“Hydrogen is gaining popularity all around the world. If you look at the investment levels in China, for example, in Japan, in Germany, in Europe in general, in the United States, they are all realizing the importance of this area.”\n\nSee the full article here .\n\nComments are invited and will be appreciated, especially if the reader finds any errors which I can correct.\n\nfive-ways-keep-your-child-safe-school-shootings\n\nPlease help promote STEM in your local schools.\n\nStem Education Coalition\n\nFrom ABC News\n\n8.9.24\n\nJENNIFER MCDERMOTT Associated Press\n\nThe United States is speeding up efforts to license and build a new generation of nuclear reactors to supply carbon-free electricity.\n\nFaster development is one thing Congress and the administration agree on. President Joe Biden signed legislation in July to modernize the licensing of new reactor technologies so they can be built faster. Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate environment and House energy committees praised the enactment.\n\nThe U.S. is pursuing small modular reactors and advanced reactors. Some designs use something other than water for cooling, such as liquid metal, helium or liquid salt. Developers say the advanced coolants allow the reactors to run at low pressure, making them safer than traditional designs.\n\nRussia and China are the only countries that are already operating advanced reactors.\n\nThe United States is trying to boost the new technology; the Energy Department announced $900 million in funding in June. Bill Gates’ company, TerraPower, is the first in the U.S. to apply to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a construction permit for an advanced reactor that would operate as a commercial nuclear power plant.\n\nReaders had questions for The Associated Press about evolving nuclear. They wonder how the next generation of reactors can be a climate solution, where the radioactive waste would go, and above all, whether these new reactor designs are safe.\n\nThe AP turned to White House National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi and experts at the Energy Department and Nuclear Regulatory Commission to help answer those questions.\n\nQ: Elizabeth M. from Bisbee, Arizona said advanced nuclear seems like a compromise that, despite drawbacks, is the most practical and clean solution for America’s big energy appetite. We asked Zaidi for his take on how these new reactors can be a climate solution.\n\nZaidi said the world has to feed future energy needs “in a way that doesn’t add to the problem of climate change.” Nuclear energy is one tool that can do that, he said.\n\n“As we are finding ourselves in the middle of the climate crisis in the decisive decade for climate action, it’s incumbent on us to pull every tool off of the sidelines and help harness these technologies in the race for the future,” Zaidi said.\n\nNuclear power plants don’t emit the planet-warming greenhouse gases that come from power plants that burn fossil fuels.\n\nQ: At least one reader wondered about the timeline for these reactors to come online, lamenting how long it takes for older plants to get running.\n\nZaidi said the U.S. is working hard to make it happen “in this decade.” And he said the goal is “a massive ramp-up and scale-up of this technology” over the next 10 to 15 years.\n\nThe project furthest along, from Gates’ TerraPower, applied for its construction permit in March. The company has said it wants to start operating commercially in Wyoming in 2030. The NRC has a 27-month goal for its technical review. If NRC approves the project along that timeline, TerraPower could be spinning up electricity in the early 2030s if it takes about three years to gets its plant built and obtain an operating license. But that’s not certain. Other first-of-their-kind nuclear projects frequently faced delays and cost overruns.\n\nQ: Lots of readers — including Jim M. from Manheim, Pennsylvania — wanted to know what would happen to the radioactive waste from new reactors. The question stems from the United States’ decades-long inability to find a place to store spent fuel from current and former nuclear plants nationwide. Right now, spent fuel is being stored at more than 70 sites in more than 30 states — enclosed in steel-lined concrete pools of water or in steel containers known as dry storage casks.\n\nActing Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy Michael Goff said spent fuel from the new reactors will be stored at the same sites where it’s used — the same situation the U.S. has today — until some federal storage facility is operational.\n\nGoff said spent fuel from any new plants must be “stored, transported and disposed of” to meet the same NRC requirements that govern waste from current plants. That basically means keeping it cooled and secured.\n\nThe shape and composition of the fuel from some of the new reactors will be different, meaning it may require some technical changes to the way the fuel is packaged and contained, the Department of Energy said.\n\nGoff noted that nuclear fuel can be recycled to make new fuel and byproducts, saying that “more than 90%” of its potential energy remains even after the fuel has been used in a reactor for five years. The U.S. doesn’t currently recycle any of its spent nuclear fuel, but Goff said other countries, including France, do. And he said some advanced U.S. reactor designs might “consume or run on spent nuclear fuel” someday.\n\nThe French nuclear industry reprocesses spent fuel to recover uranium and plutonium for reuse, which reduces the volume of waste. Some radioactive materials, or byproducts, have commercial, medical and academic uses. The United States has studied the prospect of commercial reprocessing of spent fuel, but expected little interest from applicants for reprocessing facilities and currently does not encourage it.\n\nQ: Anne L. from East Bay, California wants to know if these reactors have the same problems and dangers as large plants. She wasn’t the only reader to wonder about such risks as overloads or meltdowns.\n\nNuclear Regulatory Commission spokesman Scott Burnell said all U.S. nuclear plants have to meet NRC safety requirements, showing how they operate safely under ordinary conditions.\n\n“They must also show they can safely shut down, and then keep their fuel properly cooled, under normal conditions and in case of severe weather, earthquakes, problems with plant systems and other extreme events. Current reactors use pumps and backup power systems to stay safe; new designs can rely on natural processes such as gravity and convection to remain safe,” he said.\n\nBurnell said the latest designs are proposing nuclear fuels and cooling capabilities that reduce the already small possibility of fuel overheating or melting. The NRC will require even those designs to account for extreme events and keep their fuel cooled and safe, he said.\n\nSee the full article here .\n\nComments are invited and will be appreciated, especially if the reader finds any errors which I can correct.\n\nfive-ways-keep-your-child-safe-school-shootings\n\nPlease help promote STEM in your local schools.\n\nStem Education Coalition"
