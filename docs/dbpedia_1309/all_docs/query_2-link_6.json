He is now the firm’s chief investment officer and majority owner. Fieler speaks and talks on the monetary system; he has lectured on monetary policy at the annual Grant’s Conference, the Atlas Liberty Forum and has written for the Wall Street Journal and the Hill.\n\nFieler’s Chiaroscuro Foundation invests in education, family strengthening, humanitarian work, pro-life activities, religious liberty, evangelism and other causes. A particular concern of Fieler’s is the importance of family and marriage to American society. He has spoken out on the importance of upholding the traditional Catholic view of marriage and family values. He is focused on what can be achieved legally and politically to reduce the high incidence of abortion; his priority is pre-conception causes as much as post.\n\nHe first got into public-space philanthropy through attending a conference on family law at David Blankenhorn’s Institute for American Values. “I got a sense of how deep the problems were surrounding families in America, both in our culture and in law and policy. I ended up joining the board,” he told Philanthropy Roundtable. He admires Catholics like Clarence Thomas who are not afraid to speak out on moral issues, rather than trimming one’s sails for expediency’s sake.\n\nFieler once argued in the New York Times that it was disingenuous to argue that gay relationships “lend themselves to monogamy, stability, health and parenting in the same way heterosexual relationships do”. As a result of his public stance, which includes opposition to transgender bathrooms (which he tried to abolish in California via the Privacy for All Act), Fieler has become a hero of the American cultural right. He is unabashed about describing himself as a social conservative fighting for religious liberty. “You can have freedom within your place of worship, but no rights to bring religious principles outside, into your life, your business, the public square,” he has said.\n\nHe serves as chairman of the American Principles Project, Communio and the Knights of Columbus Charitable Fund. He lives in Stamford, Connecticut, with his wife Ana and six children.

He also supports FOCUS (the Fellowship of Catholic University Students), Lumen Institute, the Pontifical North American College, and Sophia Institute Press.\n\nHanna was profiled in the PBS documentary The Call of the Entrepreneur. The son of “Pop”, Hanna Jr was brought up seeing his father support many Atlanta charities and civic organisations as well as Atlanta’s Holy Spirit parish in Buckhead, run by the charismatic Monsignor Edward Dillon.\n\nHanna has helped to shape Catholic life and education in America in a national role. He served as chair of a Commission on Education Excellence under President George W Bush, and he has been involved in 13 new educational institutions, from pre-school through post-secondary.

It came to public attention in 2007 after it purchased the Mater Verbi (Hanna) Papyrus from the Bodmer Foundation in Cologny, and donated it to the Vatican Apostolic Library in a ceremony attended by Pope Benedict XVI. Dating from between AD 175 and 225, the papyrus is the oldest extant copy of portions of the Gospels of Luke and John as well as the oldest transcription of the Lord’s Prayer. Hanna has been awarded the William B Simon prize for philanthropic leadership, and the David R Jones award for philanthropic leadership. He is also a Knight of Malta, a Knight of the Holy Sepulchre, and was named a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Gregory by Pope Benedict.\n\nTom Monaghan\n\nFounder, Domino’s Pizza\n\nTom Monaghan founded Domino’s Pizza in 1960. Brought up in a Michigan orphanage after his father died, he was driven by a strong work ethic to build his pizza franchise into one of the largest in the world before selling to Bain Capital for $1 billion.\n\nHe owned the Detroit Tigers baseball team from 1992 to 1993 and also owns the largest Frank Lloyd Wright architecture collection in the world. Monaghan has been a major Catholic philanthropist, saying that his love of the Catholic Church stemmed from his time at the St Joseph Home for Boys, and in particular the influence of Sister Berada who instilled in him the belief that anything was possible. He then went onto St Francis High School where he tested a vocation to the priesthood and joined St Joseph’s Seminary in Grand Rapids. He was asked to leave for disciplinary reasons (talking in chapel and pillow fighting) and later said that was one of the greatest failures and disappointments of his life. His gifts include $3.5 million to the rebuilding of the cathedral in Managua, Nicaragua. He supports pro-life charities including Priests for Life. He has helped with the founding of several Catholic organisations including the Ave Maria Foundation, Legatus International, Ave Maria University, and the Spiritus Sanctus Academies.
