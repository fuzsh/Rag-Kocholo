        "text": "The clinical syndrome we now recognize as hypothyroidism was characterized as “myxoedema” in 1878 by William Ord, a physician at St. Thomas’ Hospital [11] (Fig. 2). The concept of an organ (gland) secreting a chemical substance (hormone) is attributed to the French physician Brown-Séquard, who in 1889 injected himself with testicular extracts from several animals and reported improvement in strength and stamina [12]. With recognition of this principle, in 1891, George Murray, a British physician, reported that injection of thyroid extract from sheep led to improvement in symptoms in a woman with myxedema [13]. Orally administered fresh sheep thyroid gland was first reported by Mackenzie in 1892 [14] Soon thereafter, another case with “before and after” pictures was reported by Shapland (Fig. 3) [15]. Oral thyroid was cheaper, easier to use, and lacked the attendant risk of “tonic spasms” (Mackenzie’s term) apparently from co-injecting PTH, which would have been contained in Murray’s thyroid extracts.\n\nRobert Graves is known for his classic 1835 report of “palpitations, goiter, and exophthalmos” in three women [16], but Caleb Parry observed the same clinical features in 1786 (published posthumously by his son in 1825) [17] – yet the name Graves’ disease, coined by Armand Trousseau in 1861, persists [18]. In 1840, Adolph von Basedow completed the picture of toxic goiter [19]. He noted exophthalmos, and as he practiced in Merseburg, Germany, the triad of goiter, exophthalmos, and palpitation was frequently called Merseburg’s triad. In 1867, Adolph von Graefe described lid lag in thyrotoxicosis and coined it Basedow’s disease [20]. Up until the 1800s, the pathophysiology of Graves’ disease was unclear; cardiac and nervous system disorders were thought to be the cause [21].\n\nNot until 1884, with the first report of thyroidectomy for a patient with Graves’ disease by Ludwig Rehn, was the thyroid suspected to be the etiology [22]. After improvement in symptoms and signs in his patients, Rehn proposed the disease was due to hyperactivity of the thyroid gland. In 1887, neurologist Paul Julius Möbius referred to Rehn’s work and suggested the cause was disordered function of the thyroid gland poisoning the body [23]. With the description of X-rays, external radiation was tried for all manner of disease, posing risks to both patient and physician: after 60 years as a practitioner, Dr. Emil H. Grubbe, who built his own X-ray machine in 1896, underwent 90 surgeries for “cancerous burns” and died of cancer [24].\n\n“Cretinism,” a term that has mostly been replaced in the medical literature by “congenital hypothyroidism,” refers to severe thyroid hormone deficiency early in life. Until the mid-19th century, there was little to link the thyroid to cretinism. Severe hypothyroidism may be congenital or, rarely, acquired during infancy or early childhood. In 1850, Thomas Curling described two children, aged 6 months and 10 years, with the absence of goiter (noted at autopsy) and defective cerebral development [25]. More than 20 years later, C. Hilton Fagge noted similar patients and postulated “…the healthy thyroid body is capable of exerting a counteracting influence [on cretinism]” [26]. In 1883, Felix Semon tried to unify myxedema, cretinism, and cachexia strumipriva (signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism, with or without myxedema resulting from the loss of thyroid tissue) by proposing that all were manifestations of the absence or degeneration of the thyroid [27]. Horsley noted the amelioration of severe, induced hypothyroidism in animals by transplanting parts of the thyroid gland into the peritoneum of the hypothyroid animals [28]. In 1895, Bramswell showed the remarkable transformation of a child with severe hypothyroidism with marked linear growth, greater mental awareness, as well as the loss of subcutaneous edema [29]. Thus, by the end of the 19th century, endemic severe hypothyroidism was established as a condition due to the lack of thyroid hormone function. The commonality of myxedema in adults and severe hypothyroidism in children presaged the more widespread use of thyroid replacement therapy. The link between iodine deficiency and cretinism was confirmed in 1966 following a trial in Papua New Guinea which led to the discovery that administration of iodized oil to the population reduced the incidence of goiter and cretinism [30].\n\nTheodore Emil Kocher, a Swiss surgeon, is credited with discovery of the finding that patients with goiter who underwent complete thyroidectomy developed what he termed cachexia strumipriva, a “bad condition due to removal of a struma (goiter).” Kocher (among others) proposed that surgeons conserve part of the gland to prevent this outcome. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1909 for his work on the physiology, pathology, and surgery of the thyroid gland [31].\n\nShortly thereafter, Edward Kendall, PhD, working at the Mayo Clinic, a center performing a lot of thyroid surgery, was isolating thyroid hormone. On Christmas day, 1914, Kendall finally succeeded in isolating thyroid hormone crystals, which he named “thyroxin” (“e” later added) [32-35] (Fig. 4). However, it was another decade until Charles Harington and George Barger determined its chemical structure (1926) and then synthesized thyroxine (T4) in 1927 [36, 37]. With this advance, the significance of iodine as a component of “tetraidothyronine” became clear. Synthesis of T4 allowed studies of its physiology; for example, in 1931, DM Lyon demonstrated the impact of T4 on body metabolism and weight homeostasis [38]. Gross and Pitt-Rivers reported biologic activity of tri-iodothyronine (T3) in 1952–1953 [39].\n\nStudies in the 1930s–1940s began to work out regulation of the thyroid gland by a substance produced in the pituitary. In 1931, Loeb and Bassett extracted and purified thyrotrophic substance (TSH) from bovine pituitary glands [40]. Then in 1949, RG Hoskins advanced the concept of the pituitary-thyroid axis function in a paper entitled “The thyroid-pituitary apparatus as a servo (feed-back) mechanism” [41]. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) was isolated independently by Andrew Schally and Roger Guillemin in 1970 [42, 43], defining the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. Schally and Guillemin shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their discovery in 1979.\n\nStarting in the 1950s, an understanding of the various steps involved in the synthesis of thyroid hormone began to emerge. In 1950, John Stanbury reported two brothers described as “goitrous cretins” (Fig. 5) [44]. Radioactive iodine uptake by the thyroid was increased, though protein-bound iodine content was decreased, pointing toward a defect beyond trapping, such as a defect in oxidation/organification of iodide. Thyroid peroxidase was cloned and sequenced in 1987 [45]. The role of DUOX2 as a co-factor providing hydrogen peroxide for thyroid peroxidase activity was reported in 1999 [46]. Cloning and characterization of the Na+/I- symporter was reported in 1996 [47]. The etiology of Pendred syndrome, named after British physician Virginia Pendred, who reported deafness and goiter in an Irish family in 1896 [48], was discovered a century later (1997) to be caused by a mutation in SLC26A4, a gene coding for a chloride-iodine protein that transports iodide from the follicular cell into the colloid [49]. Characterization of iodotyrosine deiodinase (IYD or DEHAL1) was reported by Rosenberg et al. [50]. Taken together, these studies confirmed the concept that there is a gene encoding a protein controlling each step in the biosynthesis of thyroid hormone, information used to identify specific defects in subjects with dyshormonogenesis.\n\nThe next step was to determine the mechanism of thyroid hormone action. The first clue came from Jack Oppenheimer’s group in 1972, who reported T3 binding to a nuclear receptor [51]. Two groups, Sap et al. [52] and Weinberger et al. [53], reported that the c-erb-A oncogene encodes a thyroid hormone receptor (published back-to-back in Nature in 1986). Thyroid hormone action was further clarified with the report in 1987 that there are two classes of T3 nuclear receptors: TRα and TRβ [54].\n\nThe remaining piece of the puzzle was to determine how thyroid hormone enters the cell. Friesema et al. [55] reported discovery of monocarboxylase transporter 8 (MCT8), the first of several thyroid hormone transporters. This discovery came full circle when MCT8 mutations were shown to be the cause of Allen-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, a disorder first reported in 1944 and characterized by severe intellectual disability [56]. This X-linked disorder is seen in boys only; the tipoff on thyroid function testing was an elevated serum T3 level, with low–normal T4 and TSH concentrations.\n\nPediatric thyroid cancer has features that distinguish it from the adult form; however, the history of thyroid neoplasia is indistinguishable. The first documentation of thyroidectomy was in 952 AD by Moorish physician Albucasis for large goiters [110, 111]. Thereafter, several surgeons attempted surgical treatments of goiters, but prior to the mid-19th century, it was difficult, bloody, rarely successful, and largely avoided even by skillful surgeons [112, 113]. In 1791, French surgeon Pierre-Joseph Desault performed the first successful partial thyroidectomy; however, surgery continued to have a high mortality, and the French Academy of Medicine even banned all thyroid operations in 1850 [114, 115]. Wilhelm Röntgen discovered X-rays in 1896 [116] followed by Marie and Pierre Curie discovering radium in 1898 [117]. The Curies suggested using X-rays to treat tumors in 1899 [118]. Roentgen rays were used in cases of inoperable thyroid carcinomas and postoperatively in the early 1910s [119-121]. Radioactive iodine use in endocrine research started in the late 1930s, with Samuel Siedlin being the first to use 131I to treat thyroid cancer in 1946 [122]. In 1948, Polish physicians Tempka et al. [123] published a preliminary report using thyroid smears of fine needle punctures. This is regarded as the first publication of using fine-needle biopsy or aspiration (FNA) as a diagnostic method [124].\n\nIn 1950, Benedict Duffy and Patrick Fitzgerald reported the connection of irradiation of an enlarged thymus and thyroid cancer when they found 10 out of 28 patients who had been subjected to chest irradiation between 4 and 16 months of life had thyroid cancer [125]. In 1955, Dwight Clark reported the increasing incidence of thyroid carcinoma since 1900 in children and adolescents, correlating with greater use of radiation of benign conditions of head, neck, and upper thorax [126]. Many large studies since have confirmed the greatest risk factor is radiation. This curbed the use of irradiation for nonmalignant conditions in pediatrics after its peak in mid 1950s.\n\nIn 1959, with progressive improvements in methods of histology, Hazard et al. [127] identified medullary carcinoma as a distinct entity. This opened the door for identification of multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes. In 1961, a medical resident, John Sipple, published on the association of pheochromocytoma and medullary thyroid carcinoma and later earned the eponym of Sipple syndrome for MEN2A in 1968 [128].\n\nUltrasonography became an integral part of the clinical evaluation of the thyroid. Application of ultrasound for diagnostic thyroid imaging began in the late 1960s [129]. Although thyroid biopsies were routinely obtained in thyroiditis, it was not until 1971 that thyroid biopsies were used routinely in thyroid nodules [130]. In 1977, Paul Walfish recommended combining FNA with ultrasound to improve the accuracy of biopsy specimens, which has now become standard of care [131]. In 1985, the rearranged during transfection (RET) proto-oncogene was identified [132]. The analysis of RET mutation became clinically relevant with its role in diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic decision-making for childhood MTC and PTCs. In 1990s, the RET gene was found to be associated with MEN2 [133].\n\nThe expansion of knowledge regarding genetic alterations furthered the use of molecular markers on biopsies and targeted cellular therapy. Initially, while surgical resection was the only treatment option, in the early 2000s, tyrosine kinase inhibitors were initially studied as treatment for thyroid carcinomas [134]. In 2009, Steven Waguespack et al. [135] reported the first successful use of multi-kinase inhibitor to treat pediatric PTC in a 14-year-old girl.\n\nWhile the use of cytopathology from FNA was a major advance in diagnosis, there was inconsistency in interpretation of results. The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology was initially proposed to address terminology and clarity of communication of FNA results in 2007. Published in 2010 and revised in 2018, it has since been adopted worldwide [136]. In 2014, The Cancer Genome Atlas project, originally launched by NIH in 2005 to comprehend the genomic alterations underlying all major cancers, published a paper on the genomic landscape of PTCs [137]. The use of molecular profile testing has increased in pediatrics, and oncogene panels are shown to have clinical utility to predict increased risk of malignancy in patients less than 19 years old [138]. In 2015, the American Thyroid Association published its inaugural guidelines on pediatric thyroid cancer. This acknowledged the difference in pathophysiology, clinical presentations, and long-term outcomes in children and need for unique guidelines [139]. In 2018, the American College of Radiology published TI-RADS, a new risk stratification system for thyroid nodules on basis of ultrasonography [140]. TI-RADS has not been validated in children, but studies on pediatric adaptations have been published."
