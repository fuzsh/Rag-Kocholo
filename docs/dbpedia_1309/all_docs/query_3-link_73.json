A prerequisite is that attendees understand the basic operation of their DSLR camera. Expanding from the rule of thirds in composition, we’ll consider and apply elements of art as they apply to photography. We will also explore the topic of lighting in more detail, including use of natural light, artificial lighting for table-top photography, and on- and off-camera flash. Through weekly shooting assignments and in-class peer review, we’ll focus on improving the arrangement of subjects within the picture space and how we light that subject matter.\n\nDan Feighery holds a BS in physics from St. Joseph’s University in Philadelphia and a master’s degree in public administration from Golden Gate University in San Francisco. Photography has been one of his hobbies for the past seven decades.\n\nF104 Trends in American Art, 1840-1950\n\nTuesdays, 11:50–1:15, Mar. 27–Apr. 17\n\nFour sessions\n\nInstructor: Susan Rudy\n\nClass limit: 60\n\nExplore major trends in American art in this series of four illustrated lectures:\n\n27: Landscape Painting: Reality, Myth, and Symbol. Trace the development of American landscape painting as it recorded the beauty of the Hudson River Valley, highlighted the confrontation between wilderness and civilization during the westward expansion, and symbolized the trauma of the Civil War.\n\n3: American Art Comes of Age. Follow the American Impressionists and artists of the Gilded Age, and consider how art at the end of the 19th century reflected social and political trends.\n\n10: The New Century.

We’ll encourage free expression and will use many different media to create work that reflects the personal interest of each student. Projects will be started in class but usually finished outside of class. Weekly class discussions of finished work will help students further develop their talents. Basic drawing supplies needed are pencils, charcoal, Conté crayons, ink pens, pastels, and paper appropriate to the medium. The course is intended for students who are experienced in drawing or painting. If you register for this class, please do not register for F101 Introduction to Sketching and Watercolor Arts or F110 Watercolor Painting.\n\nBill Parsons earned an MFA from Virginia Commonwealth University in 1978 and has worked as a furniture maker and designer, jeweler, silversmith, and ceramic artist.\n\nF106 Virtual Museum Tour\n\nWednesdays, 9:40–11:05, April 25–May 16\n\nFour sessions\n\nCoordinator: Angie Talaber\n\nJoin representatives from the National Building Museum, the National Portrait Gallery, the Workhouse Arts Center, and the National Gallery for a virtual tour through their buildings.

This class is not intended for those who have no experience with drawing or painting.\n\nSee F101 for instructor information.\n\nF108 Hallelujah! The Music and Life of Leonard Cohen\n\nThursdays, 11:50–1:15, Apr. 26–May 17\n\nFour sessions\n\nInstructor: Bill Hoyle\n\n“Suzanne,” “So Long Marianne,” and “Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye” are just a few of the songs written by Leonard Cohen. His most famous song, “Hallelujah,” was released in 1984, but it had limited initial success and did not become popular until it was covered by other artists years later. Today there are more than 300 different recorded versions of the song. A French-Canadian Jewish poet, Cohen was also a Buddhist monk, yet he wrote many songs about Christianity. In his twenties he lived on the tiny Greek island of Hydra and later lived in a monastery. After his manager embezzled most of his money, in 2008 at the age of 74 he went back on tour. He toured for the next five years. The course will include music videos of Cohen in concert, as well as renditions of his songs from Judy Collins, k.d. lang, Jennifer Warnes, Roberta Flack, and others. The lyrics will be distributed and singing along is welcome.\n\nBill Hoyle is a life-long music lover, frequent concert goer, and former choral singer. He saw Leonard Cohen perform in 2009 at Merriweather Post and in 2013 at New York’s Radio City Music Hall. Hoyle retired in 2014 from his non-musical day job as senior investigator for the US Chemical Safety Board.\n\nF109 Singing for Fun\n\nThursdays, 2:15–3:40, Mar. 29–May 17\n\nInstructor: Palmer McGrew\n\nAs the title says, we gather to have a good time singing songs popular from the ‘30s to today. Class members are encouraged to bring in songs they would like to sing. The only singing talent necessary is the desire to sing. We have a wonderful keyboard accompanist, a percussionist, and an occasional banjo. It’s a lot of fun.\n\nPalmer McGrew, an OLLI member, is a longtime performer in church choirs, barbershop choruses and quartets, and the West Point Alumni Glee Club. He is the director of the Greenspring Choristers\n\nF110 Watercolor Painting\n\nThursdays, 2:15–3:40, Mar. 29–May 17\n\nInstructor: Leonard Justinian\n\nClass limit: 15\n\nThis class will provide an opportunity for watercolor painters at all levels to develop fresh skills while learning new watercolor techniques. Required materials include: #1, #6, and/or #8 round watercolor brushes; a paint palette for mixing colors; 140 lb. cold press watercolor paper (Arches is best, but you can use less expensive paper); a kneaded eraser; a Staedtler white plastic eraser; and tubes of watercolor paint in white, charcoal black, cadmium yellow (medium), cadmium red (medium), and ultramarine blue, or a starter set of watercolors. If you register for this class please do not register for F101 Introduction to Sketching and Watercolor Art and F105 Drawing and Sketching Workshop.\n\nLeonard Justinian has been painting for more than 60 years. Among other honors, he has received the Grumbacher Award.

He is a member of the Washington Society of Landscape Painters, www.wslp.org.\n\nR111 History of Protest Music\n\nThursdays, 9:40–11:05, Apr. 26–May 17\n\nFour sessions\n\nInstructor: Jim Dunphy\n\nThe history of protests in the United States cannot be understood without the soundtrack to those protests. In this course, we will consider the interplay between protests and music. Starting with Billie Holliday and Woody Guthrie in the 1930s, through the music of the civil rights and anti-war movements of the 1960s and up to today, we will consider how music affected protest movements and vice versa. We will look at the backgrounds of the singers, view song clips, and then put the songs in historical perspective. Some of the artists we will consider are Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan, James Brown, Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young, John Lennon, and Bruce Springsteen. We will close the circle and end on a song by Graham Nash from the 1960s commenting on a contemporary issue. Note: the language in the songs is angry and at times profane, and the images disturbing, but they represent the true feelings of the artist in the moment, and what led to these feelings. This class is a repeat of the class presented at Tallwood in the spring 2017 term.\n\nJim Dunphy, an OLLI member, is a retired federal attorney and retired colonel in the US Army Reserve. When Jim was growing up in Brooklyn, his father put him to bed not with lullabies, but with songs by Pete Seeger, Woody Guthrie, Leadbelly, and Jim Reeves—sparking an interest in folk music which continues to this day.\n\nR112 Meet the Artists\n\nThursdays, 2:15–3:30, Mar. 22–May 3\n\nNote dates and time\n\nCenterStage, Reston Community Center Hunters Woods\n\nSeven sessions\n\nCoordinator: Rosemary McDonald\n\n22: Evelyn Mo returns to the CenterStage for her fifth performance.

Because of their large and growing contributions to federal deficits, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, interest on the debt, and military spending will be examined in some depth using Congressional Budget Office data. Questions to be addressed include: Why does the federal debt matter, anyway? How close are we to being bankrupt and are we any different than Greece, a country in fiscal distress? Is there a ratio of US debt to national income where a debt-fueled economic crisis becomes inevitable? What is the trade-off between fiscal austerity and economic growth? Is our grandkids’ future in peril because of the growing debt? How might the debt impact current retirees? The federal budget process will be examined, as well as tax policy and the distribution of income. We will also look briefly at private, state, and local debt. Class discussion may be supplemented with presentations by experts from the Mason faculty or other budget experts.\n\nJim Cantwell, an OLLI member, retired from the US Senate Joint Economic Committee.

Contemporary Debates on Economic Policy\n\nTuesdays, 2:15–3:40, Mar. 27–May 15\n\nFairfax Lord of Life\n\nInstructor: Stephen Quick\n\nOur present world abounds with economic problems: growth has slowed, despite high debt levels and unprecedented stimulus from monetary policy; inequality is rising at a rapid clip; private investment is weak by historical standards; productivity is static; artificial intelligence threatens jobs; and new business formations are down while industrial concentration is up. Financial crises are happening with increasing frequency, and the institutions created to govern the world economy seem increasingly powerless to affect the course of events. These phenomena are confusing to everybody, including professional economists. They do not fit comfortably into prevailing ways of thinking, and this confusion spills over into the political debate regarding the appropriate course for economic policy. This class will explore eight critical economic issues: growth; income and wealth inequality; monopolies and intellectual property; investment; debt; finance; robots and artificial intelligence; and pensions and retirement security. Each session will be devoted to one of these topics, and will consist of an overview of the subject, a summary of the academic and policy debate on the subject, and a discussion about what to do about these areas of concern. A list of relevant readings will be circulated one week in advance of each session.\n\nStephen Quick, an OLLI member, holds a PhD in political economy from Stanford University and has been staff director of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, chief economist for the Senate Democratic Policy Committee, director of evaluation and oversight of the Inter-American Development Bank, and chief risk officer for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\n\nF205 Impact of Globalization on China’s Younger Generation\n\nWednesdays, 9:40–11:05, Apr. 25–May 16\n\nFour sessions\n\nInstructors: Confucius Institute at Mason\n\nThe rapid pace of economic development in China has created dramatic changes in China’s economy and significantly changed many aspects of daily life.

Chinese food and tea are popular worldwide, with different varieties originating in diverse regions of China. However, in recent decades Western food has been making significant inroads into Chinese diets, especially among young people in China. Chinese traditional food and tea consumption will be compared with the younger generation’s interest in fast food and coffee shops.\n\nF206 The Tom Crooker Investment Forum\n\nWednesdays, 11:50–1:15, Mar. 28–May 16\n\nFairfax Lord of Life\n\nModerator: Al Smuzynski\n\nThe Investment Forum, which meets weekly throughout the year, addresses investment topics of particular interest to retirees.

Large lakes, interlinked with waterways and thousands of rivers, produced aquatic conditions. The swamps along the Nile River and in the delta were important wet refuges that served man and made up a “water world” in Egypt. The early inhabitants of this region developed rich agricultural land along the river floodplain in tune with the cycle of annual inundations until 5000-3000 BC. Then the climate changed as the earth tilted, rains stopped, deserts formed, and man moved on as the Sahara dried out. This course will discuss and illustrate this water world and how it acted as a great natural buffer, a sustainable reserve that was later cleared and developed to make way for the irrigated world of Pharonic times.\n\nJohn Gaudet is a writer, lecturer, and ecologist whose writing has appeared in The Washington Post, Salon, and Huffington Post. He authored The Iron Snake, a historical novel about a railroad that affected millions in Africa. His most recent book, Papyrus: The Plant that Changed the World, is available on amazon.com.\n\nF304 Superhighways into the Confederacy: How Western Rivers Supported Union Offensives in the Civil War\n\nTuesdays, 11:50–1:15, Apr. 24–May 15\n\nFour sessions\n\nInstructor: Patrick Diehl\n\nThis course addresses the role of those western river systems that facilitated Union offensives deep into the heart of the Confederacy during the Civil War. Beginning very early in the war, in winter 1862, Union forces were able to penetrate deep into the western states of the Confederacy by using certain river systems. The Union employed these inland rivers by moving assault troops and supplies to seize and occupy strategic areas in the Confederate States of America. Some examples of sites covered in our course are Forts Henry and Donelson; Island No. 10 and Memphis; New Orleans; Port Hudson; and of course, parts of the Vicksburg operation, as well as other offensive campaigns.\n\nPatrick Diehl served for 36 years as an officer in the Clandestine Service of the CIA, working mostly overseas. He has always had an interest in the Civil War, is familiar with most of the major battles of the war, and has visited those battlefields. He has taught many courses at OLLI related to Civil War military and political history.\n\nF305 A Tour of the Service Academies\n\nTuesdays, 2:15–3:40, Apr. 24–May 15\n\nFour sessions\n\nInstructor: Jim Dunphy\n\nThere are five US military service academies where young men and women receive not only a college degree, but also a commission in that particular service. In this class, we will discuss these academies and look at their histories.\n\n24: Introduction and USCGA and USMMA. This session is an overview of the admissions process for all academies, tuition and fees, demographics, and the commitment upon graduation. We will also look in depth at two of the smaller academies, the Coast Guard Academy and the Merchant Marine Academy.\n\nMay 1: We will head out to the Rockies to tour the US Air Force Academy and its starkly modern campuses. The relationship of USAFA and the US Military Academy will be explored, along with current USAFA issues.\n\nMay 8: The US Naval Academy is in Annapolis. Their motto is “From Knowledge, Seapower.” In addition to taking a virtual campus tour, we will look at the 150+ year history of the Naval Academy and some of its more famous grads.\n\nMay 15: The US Military Academy traces its history back to the Revolutionary War, and many of the buildings, no matter how new, appear to be from that period. One of their slogans is “Much of the history we teach was made by people we taught.” We will also discuss famous grads and non-grads.\n\nJim Dunphy is a 1975 graduate of the US Military Academy at West Point. He served five years on active duty and 25 years in the US Army Reserve, retiring in 2005 as a colonel. He is also a graduate of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force War Colleges.

Its unresolved issues and the imperfect peace that followed reverberated throughout Europe, East Asia, Africa, and the Middle East for the remainder of the 20th century. The war marked the emergence of the United States on the world stage, yet has been strangely forgotten in America, despite the wide impact of two of President Wilson’s most seductive sound bites—“democracy” and “self-determination”—on world politics. After a brief overview of the origins and conduct of the war, the course will focus on the long-term consequences and complex legacies of World War I. The course will be held in two parts: both the spring and fall terms of 2018, concluding close to Armistice Day, 2018. To complement your experience, the course will include a number of films about the war at selected intervals. Chosen for their artistic merit, historical accuracy, and realism, the films explore various areas and topics. There will be four films shown. The film presentations will meet from 11:30 to 1:30 to enable each film to be shown in one session. The lecture presentations will start at 11:30 and last 85 minutes. Dates when films will be shown will be announced at least a week in advance so participants can plan accordingly.\n\nOLLI member Bernie Oppel is a retired foreign service officer and retired Air Force colonel. He holds a PhD in modern European/Russian history from Duke University and has taught history at the USAF Academy, as well as teaching several history and history film courses at OLLI.\n\nF307 Populism and Progressivism: the Beginning of Modern American Politics\n\nThursdays, 11:50–1:15, May 10–May 17\n\nTwo sessions|\n\nInstructor: David Heymsfeld\n\nThe Populist and Progressive movements of the late 19th and early 20th centuries were both efforts to limit the excesses of free market capitalism and political corruption. The explosive growth of the American economy in the late 19th century was accompanied by serious problems of corruption, economic inequality, inhumane working conditions, urban squalor, major depressions, and rural poverty. There were strong demands for government action by two political movements. The Populists, a grassroots movement centered in the West and South, embodied a politics of resentment: they believed that farmers and industrial workers were the victims of powerful elites, including railroads, banks ,and an uncaring government. The Progressives, a nationwide movement led by middle and upper class professionals, saw many of the same problems and urged the application of expertise and efficiency to develop policies serving the needs of all, furthering the “public interest.” As characterized by journalist George Packer, Populists were motivated by “anger upward” and Progressives by “sympathy downward.” Although the issues have changed since the 1890s, the differing approaches of populism and progressivism have continued to be important in our political discourse, most recently in the “populists” Trump and Sanders and the “progressives” Obama and Clinton.\n\nDavid Heymsfeld, an OLLI member, was a congressional professional staffer for 35 years. He has taught several OLLI courses on history and is a volunteer guide for the Newseum.\n\nF308 The American Civil War\n\nThursdays, 2:15–3:40, Mar. 29–May 17\n\nFairfax Lord of Life\n\nInstructors: National Park Service rangers\n\nCoordinators: Brad Berger, Emmett Fenlon\n\nBitter sectional differences based around the institution of slavery were not solved in the halls of government. Abraham Lincoln’s “house divided” statement proved prophetic, as the greatest test ever faced by the United States came to bear on April 12, 1861. On that day, Southern forces launched an attack on Fort Sumter, which was occupied by federal troops in the Charleston harbor. It took four years of fierce fighting, resulting in the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, to decide the course of our nation’s story. Eight park rangers will present weekly classes throughout this course.\n\nNational Park Service rangers have participated with OLLI in scores of thematic courses, special events, and trips since 2001.\n\nR309 The Water World of Ancient Egypt\n\nMondays, 11:50–1:15, Apr. 9–Apr. 16\n\nTwo sessions\n\nInstructor: John Gaudet\n\nCoordinator: John Joseph\n\nThis course is a repeat of F303.\n\nR310 Oddball Russian Aircraft\n\nMondays, 2:15–3:40, Mar. 26–Apr. 23\n\nFive sessions\n\nInstructor: Michael S. Moore\n\nThis review of unusual Russian aircraft designs starts with the pre-October Revolution period, followed by Soviet aviation through World War II, then the Cold War, to modern times. The presentations include information on the designers, development issues, performance, and service history.\n\nMichael S. Moore is a US Air Force vet, having served as a Russian intercept operator, and a retired CIA officer with extensive time overseas in his 33-year career.

He worked for 13 years as a contractor with the CIA World Factbook, analyzing ground, naval, and air forces of the world.\n\nR311 The American West\n\nTuesdays, 9:40–11:05, Apr. 24–May 15\n\nFour sessions\n\nInstructor: Richard Stillson\n\nThe past and present of the American West have captured the imagination of people throughout the world like no other region of the country. The cowboy herding cattle across dusty plains and the Indian fighting to maintain traditional lands and ancient cultures are but two iconic symbols of the West. But what is the West? Where does the West begin? Who are westerners? How did this region acquire such an impact on the imagination, economy, society, and culture of the country? Focusing on the 19th and 20th centuries, this course explores the diverse geography, cultures, and economies of the region throughout its history. In addition to cowboys and Indians, we will examine how the environment, the federal government, agriculture, mining, movies, and the military influenced diversity, conflict, and change in the West. We will also look at both the historical record and fictional accounts through film and literature.\n\nRichard Stillson has a PhD in economics from Stanford University. After a 25-year career at the International Monetary Fund, he retired to indulge his passion for history. He earned his PhD in history from Johns Hopkins University and has taught history as an adjunct professor at George Mason University. Stillson is the author of Spreading the News: A History of Information in the California Gold Rush.\n\nR312 The Golden Twenties in Berlin\n\nTuesdays, 2:15–3:40, Apr. 10–Apr. 17\n\nRose Gallery at Reston Community Center Lake Anne\n\nTwo sessions\n\nInstructor: Vera Wentworth\n\nThe “Golden Twenties” marked the beginning of modernity. After the devastation of World War I, cultural life blossomed and old traditions gave way to a new age. Everything seemed possible: there were advances in technology and radical new movements in all aspects of the arts and literature, fashion, and life style. Although often called the “Age of Excess,” the twenties produced lasting achievements and ushered in modern society. We will examine how this first truly modern decade manifested itself in Berlin.\n\nVera Wentworth holds a PhD in English and has taught at the college level for 30 years, mostly at the University of Maryland and Prince George’s Community College. She has taught a variety of literature courses at OLLI.\n\nR313 Rangers’ Choice: A Different Topic Every Week!\n\nTuesdays, 2:15–3:40, Apr. 24–May 15\n\nRose Gallery at Reston Community Center Lake Anne\n\nFour sessions\n\nCoordinators: Brad Berger, Emmett Fenlon\n\nMystery topics abound! There is no common thread that binds these lectures week to week. A National Park Service ranger will speak on a new topic at each session. We will explore obscure local connections to people, places, or events that few rarely, if ever, associate with either Washington, DC, or the expertise of National Mall park rangers.\n\nNational Park Service rangers have participated with OLLI in scores of thematic courses, special events, and trips since 2001.\n\nR314 The Missing Einstein Manuscript: One Family’s Journey\n\nWednesdays, 9:40–11:05, Apr. 18–Apr. 25\n\nRose Gallery at Reston Community Center Lake Anne\n\nTwo sessions\n\nInstructor: Jeff Metzger\n\nThe instructor’s maternal family played a pivotal role in scientific publishing in Germany in the early 20th century. The family firm was the publisher for a number of the world’s most important scientists, including Nobel laureates Albert Einstein, Marie Curie, and Werner Heisenberg, among others. Follow Metzger’s fascinating story of the creation of the earliest existing manuscript on the special theory of relativity, considered lost for many years; the rediscovery of the manuscript years later; and the subsequent sale and history of the document through the present day. We will also learn about his family’s late escape from Nazi Germany on a very unlikely route through Japan to the United States. This is a very interesting, albeit non-technical, discussion of a key Einstein manuscript. The instructor will also show artifacts related to the manuscript.\n\nJeff Metzger is an attorney who worked for the Department of Justice, in private practice, and, most recently, for a Fortune 500 company, where he headed the worldwide litigation and federal government legal and contracts groups. Metzger has particular interests in history and politics and anything composed by Johann Sebastian Bach.

But wasn’t Japan an ally of Nazi Germany? Didn’t Hitler want the Japanese to round up their Jewish population? Why did the Japanese refuse? And why was Chiune Sugihara, a Japanese diplomat who served as vice-consul for the empire of Japan in Lithuania, officially recognized by Israel and given the honor of being named “Righteous Among the Nations”?\n\nBen Gold, an OLLI member, has a BA in political science from Stanford University and also holds an MS in computer science. He served for 21 years in the US Navy and now is in his 14th year as a docent at the Supreme Court.\n\nR316 The Frontiersmen, Part 2\n\nWednesdays, 11:50–1:15, Mar. 28–Apr. 18\n\nReston Community Center Hunters Woods\n\nFour sessions\n\nInstructor: Jim Anderson\n\nFrom the earliest New World settlements, the proximity of those vast, wild spaces in North America has had a significant impact on the history of our nation. It also has influenced our character as a people, distinct from our European roots. This is part 2 of the series (which began in the fall 2017 term), and this part will consist of four lectures. We will continue to examine Turner’s “Frontier Thesis” through the biographies of individuals who were on the leading edge of our national expansion westward, and who exemplified many of the traits that have come to be associated with the American character. These will include Daniel Boone, Davy Crockett, and Kit Carson.\n\nA final lecture will compare media treatment of these frontiersmen.\n\nJim Anderson spent 27 years with the CIA, including tours in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Far East. He holds degrees in history from Rhodes College and the University of Memphis.

Goodman\n\nThis course will review the history of Jerusalem, emphasizing the origins of, and the competing rights to, the holy sites of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. We will focus on the most controversial religious site, known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary. This is the location of the Jewish Temples, the Western Wall, the Muslim Dome of the Rock, and the al–Aqsa Mosque. We will also discuss the complicated administration of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre (where Jesus was crucified and buried) and the evolution of the Via Dolorosa (Jesus’ route to the crucifixion). Additional topics will include recent controversies concerning demolition under the Temple Mount/Noble Sanctuary by the Muslim Authority, the issue of who will control the archaeological excavations of the “City of David” in East Jerusalem, and the political/religious movement to rebuild the Jewish Temple.\n\nAllan H. Goodman is a judge, mediator, arbitrator, and author of the novel Father, Son, Stone, a historical mystery that takes place in Israel. He is a graduate of the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service and the University of Toledo College of Law, and a member of the bars of Virginia, Maryland, and DC.

Broad historical surveys provide us with the overall description of principal politicians, generals, admirals and battles, but unfortunately leave out the “sidebars”—the tangential stories—that aid us in understanding complex historical events. The emphasis in this course will be on seven sidebars that seriously affected Americans before, during and after the war. The frame upon which these topics will be discussed is the life, times, and administration of Woodrow Wilson. The sidebars will be discussed chronologically as they were addressed by the president:\n\nPershing’s punitive expedition into Mexico (1916)\n\nGerman espionage and sabotage prior to the United States’ entry into the war\n\nRecruiting and training the armed forces\n\nAdvancements in technology and weapons\n\nAdministering to the casualties of war\n\nAmerican propaganda to sell the war (and the subsequent suppression of civil rights)\n\nAmerican intervention in Russia (1918–1920)\n\nPatrick McGinty, an OLLI member, is a retired naval officer with an MA and PhD in history from Georgetown University.

In Part 1, we discussed the use of tradecraft techniques, such as code-breaking, deception, and covert surveillance. We also saw how both sides experimented with technologies, such as the telegraph and reconnaissance balloons. In Part 2, the first lecture will discuss the history and impact of Mosby’s Rangers on the local area. The following three lectures will examine the intelligence contributions of both sides during the Antietam, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg campaigns. As in Part 1, the focus will be less on the battlefield, and more on the battle of wits. Note that enrollment in Part 1 is not required to participate in Part 2.\n\nSee R316 for instructor information.\n\nL321 Early French Aviation: How the French Challenged the Wrights for Early Prominence\n\nWednesdays, 9:40–11:05, Mar. 28–Apr. 4\n\nTwo sessions\n\nInstructor: Mark Weinstein\n\nThe Wright Brothers flew the first powered aircraft in 1903, but the French were flying on their tail. The French put up the first balloons in the late 1790s and began funding research for the first military aircraft in 1890. They were not successful then, but continued funding research and invited the Wright brothers to France in 1908 to demonstrate their aircraft and negotiate a construction contract. From 1908 on, the French continued to work with aircraft manufacturers with varying success. By the start of World War I, the French had the world’s largest air force with 263 aircraft. The Europeans abandoned most Wright aircraft features and quickly developed the designs, aviation terms, shapes, and controls of what we now consider the modern airplane. The presentation will trace many early French aviation pioneers and their research, designs, models, and aircraft production.\n\nMark Weinstein is a retired electrical engineer and a docent at both Smithsonian Air and Space Museums. He started building models when he was 10 and continued his avid interest in aviation and intelligence through a career in the active and reserve Air Force, and then as part of the military-industrial complex. In his wild youth and single days he flew a Piper Tri-Pacer. Weinstein has been an OLLI member for 10 years.\n\nL322 Louis XVI, the Unknown and Misunderstood King of Versailles\n\nWednesdays, 9:40–11:05, Apr. 25–May 16\n\nFour sessions\n\nInstructor: Elisabeth Wolpert\n\nFrench history books described Louis XVI as a simple-minded, cowardly ruler. This image, created by the Revolutionaries, discredited a hard-working, conscientious king who was a skilled diplomat trying to hold the nation together, as well as a family man trying to protect his wife and children. Louis XVI found himself trapped in a revolutionary nation. This course will show his tragic struggles and concern for his people's welfare. It will also depict the private life of the young king, his avoidance of court life, his problems in the bedroom, and his hobbies and interests. We will finally look at his death, that of Marie Antoinette, and the fate of his jailed children.\n\nElisabeth Wolpert was born and educated in France. Her doctoral thesis dealt with 16th-century French literature. She enjoys being a member at OLLI, where she has taught several courses.\n\n400 Literature, Theater, & Writing\n\nF401 OLLI Players Workshop\n\nMondays, 9:40–11:05, Mar. 26–May 14\n\nSt. Peter’s in the Woods\n\nInstructor: Kathie West\n\nThis is a continuing acting and producing workshop for serious theater-minded participants, conducted by the OLLI Players, an amateur theater group affiliated with Mason.

The documentary Celebrating Legendary Black Actors showcases the groundbreaking work of African-American actors during the early years of black cinema. Featuring footage from the 1920s to the 1950s, we will begin by viewing this priceless collection of unique performances by black legends such as Paul Robeson, Wallace Ford, and Ossie Davis. Our celebration will continue by viewing film clips of today’s most renowned and popular black actor and director, two-time Academy Award winner Denzel Washington.

He finds his memories unreliable, the truth elusive, and himself not who he thought he was. Winner of the 2011 Man Booker Prize, The Sense of an Ending is a compelling page-turner with a surprise ending. Once the reader finishes, the immediate instinct is to reread Tony Webster’s highly wrought, unreliable narration. Watching the 2017 film of the same name, starring Jim Broadbent, may not help clarify the unraveling of the story because it features ambiguous cinematic narration, an interesting contrast with the novel. This course combines lecture, group discussion, and close reading to highlight Barnes’ skills as a storyteller. The instructor recommends reading the entire book before the first class. The book is available in a Vintage paperback edition as well as an e-book.\n\nNancy Scheeler completed a master's degree and the coursework for a PhD in English and American literature at the University of Maryland. She has taught a series of OLLI classes on contemporary British writers, including Rose Tremain and Penelope Lively. She is a co-leader of the Reston Book Club, which focuses on literary fiction which merits recognition on major prize lists.\n\nF408 Diaries, Letters, and Family History: The Challenge of Creating a Compelling Story\n\nWednesdays, 9:40–11:05, Mar. 28–Apr. 4\n\nTwo sessions\n\nInstructor: Carrie Meyer\n\nOld family diaries, letters, pictures, and other memorabilia often fascinate family members, but the difficulty is deciding what to do with them. The instructor has produced two published books (one based on diaries and farm ledgers and another based on World War I letters) as well as four distinct family histories done in PowerPoint. This two-session course will help generate ideas and starting points for those who may be interested in similar projects.\n\nCarrie Meyer is associate professor of economics at George Mason University. She is author of Days on the Family Farm and Letters from the Boys: Wisconsin World War I Soldiers Write Home.\n\nF409 Introduction to Creative Writing\n\nWednesdays, 9:40–11:05, Mar. 28–May 16\n\nFairfax Lord of Life\n\nInstructor: Ron Shapiro\n\nClass limit: 20\n\nThis course is designed to give practical techniques and strategies, along with constructive peer and teacher encouragement, as participants practice expressing themselves in a variety of genres. In using writing as a means to reconnect with one’s imagination, writers will enjoy this risk-free chance to express themselves in a community that fosters creativity and self-confidence.\n\nRon Shapiro, a 41-year veteran of teaching English in both Delaware and Fairfax County, holds a BA from the University of Delaware and a master’s degree in the teaching of writing from Northeastern University. He was recognized with an outstanding teacher award from Cornell University, and he serves as a teacher consultant with the Northern Virginia Writing Project.

The novel depicts seven couples, with themes that explore sexual anxiety over adultery, male possessiveness, and companionate marriage as an ideal or veiled business transaction. Issues such as child custody, alimony and separation disputes, and insanity will also be addressed. It contains tragedy, farce, comedy, and romance, and has been brilliantly adapted in a BBC miniseries scripted by Andrew Davies. We’ll also read Trollope’s short story “Journey to Panama,” about a woman sailing to marry a man she’s never met, and the relationship she forms on board with a single male tourist traveler.\n\nEllen Moody has a PhD in English literature and was a lecturer in senior colleges for over 30 years. She has written two books, including Trollope on the ‘Net, as well as essays on early modern through 20th century literature. As an independent scholar, she maintains three blogs and a website, attends conferences where she regularly presents papers, and joins in with others in reading and discussing books and movies.\n\nF411 Dante’s Purgatorio\n\nWednesdays, 11:50–1:15, Mar. 28–Apr. 18\n\nFour sessions\n\nInstructor: Kristina Olson\n\nDante Alighieri’s Divine Comedy, an epic poem that was written at the beginning of the 14th century in the Florentine vernacular, has been read and taught for over seven centuries. It tells the journey of Dante the pilgrim into an afterlife created by Dante the poet. Though based upon ancient and contemporary literature, his poem also imagined Hell, Purgatory and Paradise in original ways, describing visions of life after death. This course will give students an introduction to Dante’s greatest work, with a reading of selections from the second canticle of this three-part poem, the Purgatorio. Dante invented the topography of Purgatory as a structure of terraces that purged specific sins as souls ascended to heaven. This course is a continuation of the spring 2017 course on Dante’s Inferno, however, students need not have taken that course to enjoy this one. Ideally, participants should come to the first class having read Dante’s Inferno and Purgatorio in their entirety, using the translations by Allen Mandelbaum (published by Bantam Books). A guide such as Guy Raffa’s The Complete Danteworlds: A Reader’s Guide to the Divine Comedy (University of Chicago Press, 2009) is also helpful.\n\nKristina Olson received her PhD in Italian from Columbia University. She is currently an associate professor of Italian at George Mason University and vice president of the Dante Society of America. She is a professional Dantist with several book and article publications in the field. Her first monograph, Courtesy Lost: Dante, Boccaccio and the Literature of History explores Dante’s literary and political influence on Boccaccio in the contexts of social, political, and economic transformations in the 14th century.\n\nF412 Proof that Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice Ages Well\n\nThursdays, 9:40–11:05, Apr. 12–May 17\n\nSix sessions\n\nInstructor: Elizabeth Lambert\n\nIn recent times, a form of fiction has emerged called “fan fiction.” Put simply, it is the modern adaption of an original work. In Jane Austen’s case, adaptations have run the gamut from zombies to sea monsters. Extreme adaptations aside, one of the best, if not the best, has been written with our generation in mind: Jane Austen in Boca by Paula Marantz Cohen. To see just how cleverly Cohen has adapted Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, we will read a portion of Cohen’s book, then turn our attention to the ever-popular Pride and Prejudice. Finally, we will return to Jane Austen in Boca and put all the pieces together. Whether this is your first reading of Pride and Prejudice or your return to an old favorite, you will delight in seeing the ways that Austen’s masterpiece never ceases to be relevant. Jane Austen in Boca is available in book or Kindle form; the Barnes and Noble Classics edition of Pride and Prejudice is recommended.\n\nBeth Lambert is the coordinator of the Reston OLLI program and the History Club. In 2008 she retired from Gettysburg College, where she taught courses on all aspects of 18th-century Britain. At OLLI she teaches some of her favorite subjects (with Jane Austen’s novels ranking high among them), and she loves sharing them with OLLI members.\n\nF413 More Movies from Across the Pond\n\nThursdays, 11:30–1:30, Mar. 29–May 17\n\nNote time\n\nCoordinator: Martha Powers\n\nIf you enjoyed “Movies from Across the Pond” in previous terms, then you’ll be glad to see that there are eight more great English films coming your way!

Perhaps you just need encouragement and an impetus to give it a try, so sign up and find the support you need! Each session will be divided into three segments: a discussion of craft, a time to write, and a time to share what’s been written. Come and surprise yourself!\n\nEd Sadtler, a graduate of Shippensburg State College in Pennsylvania, has conducted many writing workshops at OLLI.\n\nCarolyn Wyatt is a retired federal information officer who traveled widely in that position. She has an MA in Spanish from Indiana University and aspires to be a poet and a wise woman.\n\nF415 Pick a Card, Any Card: Storytelling\n\nThursdays, 2:15–3:40, Mar. 29–May 3\n\nSix sessions\n\nInstructor: Skip Bromley\n\nThe magic begins with the card. Pick a card, any card at all, and a story is told. The card might say: “Birthday Saga.” Skip Bromley, your instructor, will tell his own engaging story about the subject. You will then have an opportunity to create another story and share, either singularly or as part of a group effort. You also have the option to simply be an audience member, enjoying the stories shared by others. This course is designed to allow participants to analyze, construct, and critique stories, learning the most effective way to tell a story. No matter your level of involvement, you will ultimately appreciate the elements and evolution of storytelling and be highly entertained during the process.\n\nSkip Bromley is an award-winning teacher who worked for Fairfax County Public Schools for 37 years. He was recognized for his tenure at Oakton High School with the naming of the school auditorium in his honor. He was grateful this was not a posthumous recognition. He studied theatre at Catholic University, and has produced and directed hundreds of plays and musicals throughout his career. He has been deeply influenced by Greek mythology and history, weaving his knowledge into the development of a modern-day curriculum appealing to all ages. His love of storytelling has earned him accolades from students, parents, and colleagues. He continues this practice in retirement.\n\nF416 Two Catholic Novels\n\nThursdays, 2:15–3:40, Mar. 29–May 17\n\nInstructor: Kay Menchel\n\n“Conversion is like stepping across the chimney piece out of a Looking-Glass-world, where everything is an absurd caricature, into the real world God made; and then begins the delicious process of exploring it limitlessly.” —Evelyn Waugh, 1949\n\n“Mr. Greene, some parts of your books are certain to offend some Catholics, but you should pay no attention to that.” —Pope Paul VI, 1965\n\nIn this course we will read Evelyn Waugh’s Brideshead Revisited and Graham Greene’s The End of The Affair, celebrated novels that have also been filmed to great acclaim. We will take a look at these onscreen adaptations and consider how Waugh and Greene’s Catholicism shaped them as authors. Their religious faith sets them apart from some of their English contemporaries and informs many of the moral struggles and thematic preoccupations found in their work.\n\nKay Menchel, who grew up in Yorkshire, England, is a lawyer who also holds an MA in English literature from Mason. She has taught numerous literature classes and always enjoys sharing her passion for English literature with OLLI members.\n\nR417 T wo Catholic Novels\n\nTuesdays, 9:40–11:05, Mar. 27–May 15\n\nInstructor: Kay Menchel\n\nThis is a repeat of F416.\n\nR418 and R419 Shakespeare’s History Plays: Henry IV Part Two and Henry V\n\nOverview of Series: The four plays Richard II, Henry IV Parts One and Two, and Henry V were written over several years from 1595 to 1599 and have usually been produced as single plays. However, they also comprise a single, two-generational story from the failures of Richard II through the triumphs of Henry V, a story that is part history, part invention, and one that Shakespeare used to draw lessons about monarchy and society in England. Henry IV, Part Two and Henry V are being offered as two separate courses. Members are free to enroll in one or both of these courses; participation in the previous courses on Richard II and Henry IV Part One in fall 2017 is not a prerequisite for either course. Each course will begin by watching the production of the play from the BBC series The Hollow Crown, which reduces each play to about two and a half hours, but the discussion will require the full text. The Folger Shakespeare Library edition by Barbara Mowat and Paul Werstine is recommended as it is very readable and informative.\n\nR418 Henry IV, Part Two\n\nTuesdays, 11:50–1:15, Mar. 27–April 17\n\nFour sessions\n\nInstructor: Karen Miles\n\nAs the play opens, Henry IV once again faces insurrection from nobles, this time led by the clergy. Prince Hal continues to keep company with Falstaff; the king is sick and dying; and the mood in the country is very dark. The discussion will focus on the following issues: the matters which drive the continued challenges to Henry IV’s reign; final lessons that Prince Hal learns from Falstaff and his companions; and the significance of Hal’s public repudiation of Falstaff just after his coronation. We will also note liberties that Shakespeare took with the historical facts.\n\nKaren Miles holds a PhD from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in French literature. She taught at Marquette University and the University of Wisconsin–Parkside before becoming a program officer at the National Endowment for the Humanities. Since retiring, she has taught courses on Shakespeare for OLLI.\n\nR419 Henry V\n\nTuesdays, 11:50–1:15, Apr. 24–May 15\n\nFour sessions\n\nInstructor: Karen Miles\n\nWith Henry V, Shakespeare creates a character that embodies, as closely as humanly possible, the perfect king. Following his poor initial prospects and his long, unorthodox education, Henry V deals masterfully with all of the issues that bedeviled his father: continuing challenges from independent-minded and powerful nobles; lack of legitimization from the clergy; and the desire of the commons for freedom from all constraints of law and morality. The discussion will focus on the qualities of character that enable Henry V to unite the classes and the countries of Great Britain on the domestic front and to regain Britain’s territories and stature abroad.\n\nSee R418 for instructor information.\n\nR420 Literary Roundtable\n\nWednesdays, 11:50–1:15 Mar. 28–May 16\n\nReston's Used Book Shop at Lake Anne\n\nModerator: Ben Gold\n\nClass limit: 21\n\nThis short-story discussion class will use a new anthology, The Best American Short Stories 2017, edited by Meg Wolitzer. Some of these 20 stories are gripping, some are very funny, but all were chosen with great care for language and nuance and they form an eclectic mix of short fiction from contemporary authors. You will be familiar with several of the authors, but many may be new to you. The anthology, published in 2017 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is available in paperback and Kindle format. See R315 for instructor information.\n\nR421 Memoir Writing: Preserving Your Life Stories\n\nThursdays, 9:40–11:05, Mar. 29–May 17\n\nInstructor: Ron Shapiro\n\nClass limit: 20\n\nIn a supportive and comfortable setting, you will discover the power of the written word to preserve your memorable experiences.

Get the inside scoop from the show’s producers, choreographer, and musical director, and learn about the lighting and sound, props, and costumes. You’ll see why staging a musical is unique. Thoroughly Modern Millie, which earned six Tony Awards, takes us on a high-spirited romp through the Roaring Twenties with its snappy music, flappers, and tappers. What happens to the girl from a small mid-western town as she comes face-to-face with the realities of making it in New York City? What about her grandiose plans to marry the “modern way”—for money, forget love? Participants are encouraged but not required to attend the Sunday, May 6, 2:00 matinee performance of Thoroughly Modern Millie at CenterStage. If you decide to attend the May 6 matinee, please purchase your own ticket for $23 from the Reston Players box office at https://restonplayers.org/tickets-show4/.
