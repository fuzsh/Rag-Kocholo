        "text": "Amanda Berkowitz creates and develops opportunities between brands and talent. With 10 years’ experience in artist discovery, management, and branding—and a knack for generating real business value—companies and artists come to her when they want to connect with their audiences via simple and unique content and activations.\n\nAmanda has witnessed the way the arts has the potential to create positive change since she was a teenager growing up New York. Her drive to become part of the music industry led her to study as a sound engineer after investing two years at Temple University. Realizing that she also needed to utilize her remarkable relationship management skills, Amanda landed an internship with Atlantic Records. She quickly proved herself to be an asset in learning all aspects of the music business and was promoted to A&R manager at age 25. For the next five years—while at Atlantic, Epic, and their joint venture record labels—Amanda sought and signed emerging urban artists.\n\nBronx native, Puerto-Rican/Jamaican representing artist Amanda Brown has built a career out of provoking intense reactions from the musical elite. Many music lovers discovered her after witnessing her complex soprano on season three of The Voice––an accolade that endeared Brown to millions of new fans and won over critics at Rolling Stone, Billboard, and many more.\n\nThe Voice established Brown to fans as a captivating front woman, however; the most established recording artists in the world have been drawing on her talent for years. After receiving exemplary training at New York City’s world renowned FAME school and esteemed HBCU Howard University, she began working on the road and in the studio as a backing vocalist for some of the biggest artists in music including Stevie Wonder, Adele, Alicia Keys, Tori Kelly, Michael Bolton, Jennifer Hudson, Jessie J and Cynthia Erivo.\n\nDuring 2018/19 she toured with The Killers as a supporting artist opening for the band to promote her debut album Dirty Water. She also provided live backing vocals for their global Wonderful Wonderful tour. Since returning from the road, she has gone on to perform in and compose music for both television and commercial broadcasting, receiving coveted placements on shows such as NBC’s new hit series Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist and a commercial campaign for Nordstrom. Whilst enjoying successes on screen, she continues to lend her voice to highly-esteemed musical works, performing on multiple tracks for Tyler, The Creator’s grammy award-winning album IGOR and The Killers’ single ‘Land Of The Free’.\n\nBrown released her anticipated single ‘From Here’ on October 23rd. The lyrics speak directly to the hearts of those standing at an emotional crossroads, calling for honest self-realization and empathetic engagement from anyone who hears it. Brown’s new and compelling ballad is a triumph of her risk-taking, pop-savvy, finely honed alternative rock sensibilities and acts as a catalyst for her musical metamorphosis. ‘From Here’ dares the listener to survey the broken fragments of their lives, take a chance on self-belief and begs the question: where are we headed – as lovers, as a nation, as people? It serves as a fiery foundation of what’s to come from this powerhouse vocalist and songwriter. Her sophomore project is slated for release in 2021.\n\nAnAkA is a visual storyteller preserving how Spirit is ever-present in the process of creation. Pushing the limits of artistic expression, AnAkA sees through their lens with a focus on healing.\n\nAs a self-proclaimed “Artkivist”, Anaka is a master of finding the soft spots of creation where organic artistry is evoked by Higher Consciousness. She focuses on two specific ways Spirit is omniscient in art: first, how Spirit and ritual are an integral part of the creation process; and second, how oppressive systems affect the Spiritual creativity and resource accessibility of artists.\n\nAnAkA’s creations within Film, Photography, Tattooing, Visual Art, Event Curation, Dance, and Herbal Healing is what encompasses the AKTIV8 Movement. AnAkA’s work brings global communities together through the common thread of creation in order to focus on the roots of infinite knowledge we share across the world.\n\nGRAMMY-winning artist/songwriter, Ant Clemons, moved across the country from New Jersey to Los Angeles only a couple of years ago in pursuit of his dream career.
