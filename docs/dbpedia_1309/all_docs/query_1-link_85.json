INC. iSth PRODUCTION RVVIVW Camera Eye THE EDITORIAL VIEWPOINT A FOREWORD TO THIS REVIEW THE Primary Function of this 18th Annual Production Review is served by keeping its pages in sharp , focus on a few key objectives: to pro- vide the reader with all available data on national and international film com- petition of importance; to list in detail the organized groups which serve both users and the industry; and to provide the most authoritative and dependable hstings of distributors, writers and truly experienced, specializing producers. We have kept the faith, holding high our long-estabhshed basic standards of experience and proven capability as a guide to the buyers of services. No at- tempt has been made for mere numbers of listed companies. Instead, require- ments for 1967 experience as a prere- quisite to producer listings, would tend to separate this publication from the many imitative listing sources. So we can point with justifiable pride to the 65 pages of producer listings which car- ry data on 393 U.S. producers; 15 of Canada's best sources and over 58 com- panies on other continents. Throughout the year ahead, thou- sands of subscribers in American and overseas business concerns, their ad- vertising and public relations agencies, buyers of the audiovisual media in gov- ernments and the institutional field will lurn to these pages for most dependable guidance on their requirements. And now we look ahead to the other editions of an eventful year: Part II of another Special Report on Audiovis- ual Facility Designs (next month's fea- ture portfolio); a most comprehensive report on the history-making film pro- gram of Shell International, featured in our Number Three edition this year; a picture/text story on Vision Associates\" fine film on The Road: and many other outstanding editorial events. And we begin our 30th anniversary of service to the audiovisual industry in the same spirit of enthusiasm and dedi- cation we enjoyed in 1938! — OHC BUSINESS SCREEN A Preview of the 1 8th Annual Production Review Features Right Off the Newsreel: Notes and Commentary on Current Events 6 Medical Films on the Move: AMA Film Library Reports on Growth 10 National Awards Competition for Business and Educational Films 13 International Film Awards Competition for Business and Industry 19 Professional Organizations Serving Business and Industrial Film Users .... 23 Educational and Scientific Organizations Serving Audiovisual Users 28 Trade and Professional Groups Within the Audiovisual Industry 37 Civic and National Film Council Organizations 42 World in Focus: Business Film Trends Abroad, by Robinson P.

Ask yourself what other medium guar- anteees /;/// attention to your entire message. No print advertisement, no TV show, no brochure, not even the most hypnotic salesman can persuade a prospective customer or an un- believer to sit quietly for 5 to 30 min- utes and concentrate on your message. Thanks to this unique environment, film can get your message over in the right logical progression of the mes- sage-points — without the prospect being able to interrupt, or worse, to skip ahead. Film doesn't need to waste precious time on attention-grabbing \"stoppers,\" because the viewer is already seated and attentive. Film \"carries its stinger in its tail,\" i.e., in its residual impression, and hence is free to implant important, though sometimes quiet, foundational material up front, with a solid effec- tiveness impossible in any other medium. Finally — and perhaps most impor- tant — film implants its impressions in the form of picture-images. And since people tend to remember what they see better than what they hear, the impressions burned into their minds via film have a better chance to endure — to inform, persuade, in- spire . . . and compel action: to motivate. — Cap Palmer * -^ * Ask Parthenon for loan prints of any of our pictures.

The 17,328 bookings during 1967 was 28 percent higher than the previous high of 14,064 in 1966. Total bookings each year have shown constant growth each year since 1955 when 3,007 were recorded. Hospitals, Nursing Schools Most Active Analyzing 1967 bookings, Ralph P. Creer, director of the medical motion pictures and television section of the AMA, reported that the largest single users of AMA films were civilian hospitals and schools of nursing. Ninety-two U.S. medical schools used the services of the Film Library during the year. Paramedical schools were increasingly heavy users, accounting for more than 10 percent of the total bookings. As an indication of the heavy usage during the past year, the supply of the Catalog of Selected Medical and Surgical Motion Pic- tures was exhausted within six months and thus went out of print. 2,453 Prints of 502 Titles in Library The AMA Film Library presently consists of 2,453 copies of 502 films This includes 128 health films which can be used by physi- cians who aie invited to address lay groups. A current list of the films is currently avail- able from the AMA film library at 535 N. Dearborn St., Chicago, 111. 60610.

(Either way, you get all the advantages of the System that's already been tested and proved in the field for years-Standard or Super 8 format.) Operating instructions tor either of these instant load sound projectors are the same: 1. Slip in a MoviePak. 2. Flip a lever. It takes less than two seconds to set up your film. And then everything happens at once. Motion. On an 8\"x10-1/2 \"screen. In black and white or full color.

And changing or slopping a film is as easy as starting It: 1. Push a button. 2. Slide out the MoviePak. II you want your film to repeat continuously, one switch controls it. If you'd rather have the machine turn itself off when the film ends, just set the same switch for automatic stop. Fairchild motion picture equipment.
