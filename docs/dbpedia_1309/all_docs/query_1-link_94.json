        "text": "I hear it all the time: finding great Netflix shows can be tough. There are many good Netflix shows — and bad ones too — and the density of them all makes it really difficult to sift through it all to watch the best Netflix shows. Yes, we regularly update a roundup of just that, all of the best shows on Netflix. But that roundup has over 60 shows, and we know sometimes people want a list that's a little more digestible. A little more personal. Which is how I've built this list. I looked at my viewing history, then crossed off all the Stranger Things and Squid Games because they're too obvious. I then thought about the shows that I wish I could see again with a fresh set of eyes. To experience these amazing shows without knowing what would come next. So, I've selected a range of shows that I think shows off a fair bit of what I love about Netflix. This batch has an excellent drama series, an unexpected reality TV show, an amazing sitcom, one of the best shows of the last decade and a sketch comedy show that's a treat. And they're not all \"from\" Netflix: this batch has three two Netflix Originals, one import that has a larger legacy that Netflix could pull from and two licensed shows that are ultimately rewatchable. Maid is the best Netflix drama in years (Image credit: RICARDO HUBBS/NETFLIX) You may remember Margaret Qualley from Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, where she had an instant way about herself when she hopped into Brad Pitt's car. But after you see Maid, you'll always see her as Alex, a single mother who is dealing with poverty, homelessness and an emotionally abusive relationship. Qualley's performance, which is often simmering (or at full-boil) with tension, is the kind of thing that sticks with you, further humanizing every stranger you've ever seen going through something terrible in public. On top of all that, Alex's mother Paula (Andie MacDowell, Qualley's real-life mother) is going through her own drama, with an untrustworthy beau. Throughout Maid (which is inspired by Stephanie Land's memoir of the same title), the series shows us all the different ways that trauma can effect and hurt, as well as how it's passed down generationally. One of the most intense shows this side of The Bear (one of the best shows on Hulu), Maid is a 10-episode limited-series that demands to be seen. Genre: Drama Seasons: 1 (10 episodes) Watch it on Netflix (opens in new tab) I Think You Should Leave is one of the best sketch comedy shows on Netflix (Image credit: Netflix) Even if you've never seen I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson, you've probably seen some of its best moments. For example, you've probably seen a meme of a guy in a hot dog costume, dedicated to finding out who's responsible for \"this situation.\" And that one sketch is a prime example of why you should watch I Think You Should Leave. The context of that scene, and how it lingers on its awkwardness, is absolutely amazing. In this one scene, Tim Robinson plays this hot dog-costumed man with a shockingly unearned confidence, one that even tricks those around him. That's only one of dozens of moments from the series that will linger with you for weeks if not months. A fair warning that there is some adult humor in this show, especially when you get to the haunted house tour. But I Think You Should Leave will stay with you for a while, and it's one of those shows you won't stop quoting with friends. Oh, and once you get through the whole of the series, don't worry: a third season is already officially announced. Genre: Sketch comedy Seasons: 2 Watch it on Netflix (opens in new tab) Old Enough! is a total gem and surprise (Image credit: Netflix/Nippon TV) While I'm no reality TV expert, random unique unscripted programming can find its way into my heart. And Old Enough! is the perfect representative to put on this list. This odd series is about young kids in Japan whose parents think need a little push into their independence. And whent I say young, I mean that these are two- to four-year-olds going off on errands by themselves (with a camera crew). One has to go grocery shopping and remember everything, while another has to simply make juice. A hit for over 30 years on Japan's Nippon TV, Old Enough! even has narration that takes the challenges slightly seriously. When we're told that two-year-old Horoki's \"errand actually requires a one-kilometer journey each way,\" and that this \"distance is a new record for a solo errand at two years and nine months!\" you'll chuckle at the prospect of someone treating these kids miniature missions like a sport. It's adorable, and a welcome change of pace from most reality TV. Watch it on Netflix (opens in new tab) Better Call Saul is the show that you really ought to have seen by now (Image credit: AMC) You know how I said I wasn't going to recommend anything obvious? Nothing that has been over-exposed? I'm not sure if I lied or not. Better Call Saul has, for six seasons now, been that show you're told you need to watch. That said, I don't know if enough people are taking that advice. For some reason, maybe it's the fact that Bob Odenkirk doesn't have the sex appeal of the Euphoria kids, Better Call Saul still feels like a show reaching for a bigger audience. Which is why I love the fact that its first five seasons are on on Netflix. In those five seasons, you'll get to know Jimmy McGill (Odenkirk), the lawyer who slowly loosened his morals enough to become Saul Goodman on Breaking Bad. But we don't really need to talk about Breaking Bad, and you don't need to have seen that series to know what's going on here. Throughout the six seasons of Better Call Saul, knowledge from Breaking Bad only enhances the ride here and there — it's far from necessary. Better Call Saul is like Andor in that way: it's a great show that just so happens to exist in the same universe with some of the same characters as a much-more-famous show. Why should you hit play (and keep hitting play) on Better Call Saul? Because Jimmy's relationship with his Chuck (Michael McKean) makes for some of the most amazing drama I've ever seen. Because the reveal of Jimmy's addiction to pulling off cons makes for an amazing game of \"will he get caught?\" And because Rhea Seehorn, who plays attorney Kim Wexler, puts in some of the best performances in modern TV. I can't tell you why Better Call Saul is under-seen, but I can tell you that you need to watch it — now. Maybe people are waiting until season 6 is on Netflix. Were I to watch all five seasons on Netflix before season 6 arrived? I'd just buy the dang sixth and final season on demand. That's how good it is, you'll be happy to buy the finale. Watch it on Netflix (opens in new tab) Community is one of the best sitcoms of its era (Image credit: NBC.com) Going to college is fun. Going to a community college filled with wild and weird people who do things extra-odd? Well, it can be fun, but that's provided you're watching the action from home — and not actually enrolling in Greendale. An excellent, and still under-praised, sitcom, Community is about a bunch of dysfunctional human beings at a community college where the mascot is literally called \"the Human Being.\" And its premise is relatively simple. Disbarred lawyer Jeff Winger (Joel McHale) enrolls at Greendale, because he thinks his friend Dr. Ian Duncan (John Oliver) who teaches there will help him cheat his way back to the world of law. (Image credit: Neil Jacobs/NBC) Here, Jeff meets many weirdos, and forms a study group with six of them: Britta Perry (Gillian Jacobs), an activist he wants to bed, pop culture obsessed Abed Nadir (Danny Pudi), Annie Edison (Alison Brie) and Troy Barnes (Donald Glover) who went to high school together, pious mother Shirley Bennett (Yvette Nicole Brown) and the hyper-insensitive wet-wipes magnate Pierce Hawthorne (Chevy Chase). They all have to deal with a Spanish class taught by the seemingly-inept Ben Chang (Ken Jeong), and slowly form friendships. But Community thrives when it goes outside the classroom. One week there's a paint-ball tournament taken way too seriously, the next there's a need to lock down the study room because of a missing pen. Then, there's the stop-motion animation episode, which is in a league of its own. Beloved recent sitcoms such as Parks and Recreation, The Office and Modern Family all get their flowers, and Community? Well, it got six seasons (and a Community movie is coming soon), and it should have your eyes watching (or re-watching) now. Watch it on Netflix (opens in new tab) Next: A Sling TV price hike just got announced, and Netflix with ads is broken on multiple streaming devices.\n\nComment on this story Comment Gift Article Share Good morning and welcome to The Climate 202! Today is a big day for climate policy: President Biden will sign the Inflation Reduction Act into law at the White House. We caught up with a former vice president to understand the significance of this moment: Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Al Gore never thought it would take this long to pass a big climate bill In 1981, as a young lawmaker, former vice president Al Gore held what some experts think was the first congressional hearing on climate change. In the mid-2000s, Gore continued to sound the alarm about the dangers of rising global temperatures. He appeared in the 2006 documentary “An Inconvenient Truth” and shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with climate scientists for their efforts to spread awareness about the issue. Despite Gore's tireless crusade, the United States — which has emitted more greenhouse gases than any other country — has historically lacked a comprehensive climate law. But now, more than four decades after he first warned Congress about the climate crisis, that is finally about to change. Advertisement President Biden on Tuesday will sign into law the Inflation Reduction Act, which authorizes the biggest burst of spending in U.S. history to tackle global warming. The Senate passed the landmark legislation Aug. 7, and the House followed suit on Friday. The Climate 202 spoke with Gore by phone about his views on the climate package and his work to train a new generation of activists. The following interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity: Climate 202: What were you doing last Sunday when the Senate passed the Inflation Reduction Act, and what was your initial reaction? Gore: Well, I was glued to C-SPAN, and I was calling and texting with different senators. And I was elated when the result came in. This legislation is a game changer. It will create jobs, lower costs, increase U.S. competitiveness, reduce air pollution and, of course, tackle the climate crisis. We have crossed a major threshold, and it's going to have significant impacts on international climate action, especially going into COP27 this November. Advertisement Climate 202: You held the first congressional hearings on climate change in the 1980s. Did you ever think it would take this long to pass major climate legislation? Gore: I thought it would come much sooner than it has. I never expected to devote my life to this. And I never expected the struggle to pass this kind of legislation. It took so long. Climate 202: Historically, why has it been so difficult to get climate legislation through the Senate? Would you point to specific factors such as the filibuster, opposition from Republicans, or lobbying by fossil fuel industry groups? Gore: Well, the quality of our democracy has been redeemed by the passage of this legislation, but we shouldn't fool ourselves into thinking that our democracy has not been seriously degraded. So yes, I would advocate for eliminating the filibuster, changing the practice of gerrymandering districts to make our country more divided and more partisan, and reducing the influence of big money in our politics. Advertisement But the ability of the fossil fuel industry and their lobbyists to stop climate action has been overcome, at least in this instance. And I think this will unleash so much momentum that we will never go back. Climate 202: The climate package reflects some compromises with Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) on provisions that will benefit the fossil fuel industry. Given the nature of our political system, is this bill the best we can hope for? Gore: The compromises in this legislation are actually pretty minor. If you look at the legislation through the lens of carbon reductions, the few provisions that I would have certainly opposed are extremely minor in terms of carbon compared to the massive advances in the bulk of the legislation. This was a tremendous accomplishment. Climate 202: You lead the Climate Reality Project, which trains people to become climate activists and leaders. What's next for you and the group? Advertisement Gore: This week, I'm training 6,700 new climate activists in Brazil. We're just weeks out from the election in Brazil, when we have the chance to flip to a pro-climate government. And of course, Australia just passed its first significant climate legislation in the wake of their recent climate election. So we have a lot of momentum. But the hard part lies ahead. We have much more work to do. Agency alert Infrastructure money to almost double zero-emission buses on the road The infrastructure law is poised to almost double the number of zero-emission buses on the nation's roads with a single year's funding, the Federal Transit Administration announced Tuesday, Ian Duncan reports for The Washington Post. The agency said it has awarded $1.6 billion to transit operators across the country to purchase about 1,800 new buses — 1,100 of which will be zero-emission — and to construct maintenance and charging facilities and train workers. Advertisement The money will be spread among 150 projects in 48 states, officials said. The agency will distribute another four rounds of funds in the coming years as the nation transitions away from diesel-powered buses to more sustainable battery- or hydrogen-powered ones. Mitch Landrieu, President Biden’s infrastructure adviser, said the funding will be complemented by the provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act aimed at spurring battery manufacturing and the adoption of clean heavy-duty vehicles. Pressure points Western states face deadline for steep water cuts with Colorado River at tipping point Tuesday marks the deadline for seven states in the Colorado River basin to propose unprecedented restrictions to their water usage or have the federal government impose the cuts unilaterally, as the West remains locked in the worst drought in 1,200 years. Advertisement But so far, water-sharing negotiations among the states have failed to yield any progress, a Nevada official wrote in a letter obtained by the Hill's Zack Budryk. The past three months of talks have “produced exactly nothing in terms of meaningful collective action to help forestall the looming crisis,” John Entsminger, the general manager of the Southern Nevada Water Authority, wrote in the letter to Interior Department and Bureau of Reclamation officials. Meanwhile in Utah, officials are scrambling to find new water sources to support the droves of people who are moving to the region for its stunning landscapes, Karin Brulliard reports for The Post. In St. George, Utah, a fast-growing metropolitan area where visitors can easily enter Zion National Park, the population of 180,000 is expected to more than double by 2050 — even though its only water source, the Virgin River basin, is shrinking rapidly because of human-caused climate change. Extreme events More dangerous heat waves are on the way – see the impact by Zip code Millions of people across the United States are expected to experience extreme temperatures more frequently and for longer periods of time over the next 30 years as climate change tightens its grip on the planet, according to data released Monday by the nonprofit First Street Foundation, The Post’s John Muyskens, Andrew Ba Tran, Anna Phillips, Simon Ducroquet and Naema Ahmed report. Advertisement The analysis relied on measurements of surface temperature data, tree cover, impervious surfaces, and proximity to water using a moderate scenario in which global greenhouse gas emissions peak around 2040 and then slowly decline. A Post breakdown of the group’s data concluded that global warming has already caused about 46 percent of Americans to experience at least three days straight of triple-digit heat per year. In the next three decades, that figure is likely to jump to 63 percent. Nowhere is the danger more widespread than in the South, where climate change is projected to deliver an average of 20 extra days of triple-digit heat each year. In some states, such as Texas and Florida, residents could see more than 70 consecutive days with the heat index topping 100 degrees. The findings come as high temperatures are shattering records this summer, threatening power grids and increasing the risk of heat-related illnesses in vulnerable populations. On the Hill Inflation Reduction Act promotes nature as a climate solution The Inflation Reduction Act includes $369 billion in climate- and energy-related spending, with much of it going toward high-tech climate solutions. But the legislation also sets aside money for nature-based climate solutions — a less-heralded but essential part of the fight against climate change, The Post's Brady Dennis reports. Advertisement The measure includes about $20 billion for agricultural conservation and $5 billion to safeguard forests across the country, according to the Congressional Research Service. While that might not sound like much, experts note that healthy forests, wetlands and other landscapes can pull billions of tons of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere annually, making them a powerful carbon-sequestration device. International climate Simon Stiell, Grenada’s environment minister, to be next U.N. climate chief Simon Stiell, the environment minister of Grenada, on Monday was appointed to be the next executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, Fiona Harvey reports for the Guardian. The announcement comes as nations prepare to meet in Egypt for what will probably be a fractious U.N. climate summit, known as COP27, in less than three months. Stiell, who is tasked with getting nations to ramp up their climate ambition, was a surprise choice to replace Patricia Espinosa, the outgoing executive secretary. Stiell is also the third U.N. climate chief in a row to come from the Latin American and Caribbean region. The decision underscores the vulnerability of low-lying island nations, which are some of the most susceptible to the effects of climate change despite not being the source of the majority of emissions.

GiftOutline Gift Article\n\nPlaceholder while article actions load When Amazon announced it would be bringing its second headquarters to Arlington, local officials wasted no time pitching it as a chance to build something much bigger: This corner of Northern Virginia, they said, could transform into a dense, urban technology hub — a kind of eastern outpost for Silicon Valley. More than three years later, that vision seems like it’s no longer just an idea. For boosters of the area now dubbed “National Landing,” the leaked announcement last week that Boeing would be moving its own headquarters to Arlington shows that a neighborhood once known solely as the home of the Pentagon is well on its way to becoming a regional “innovation district.” And for economic development experts, the aerospace giant’s move from Chicago also underscores the success of Virginia’s economic development strategy, which has focused on luring companies by growing and diversifying the state’s tech workforce. Advertisement But if Boeing’s decision signals that more companies could soon be coming to the area, they say, it’s also a warning sign: All the pain points associated with explosive growth in Seattle or the San Francisco Bay area — sky-high housing prices, chronically congested roads, a widening rift between the rich and the poor — may become even more acute in a wealthy county that already suffers from similar woes. Boeing’s move to Arlington “puts an even greater premium on the work the region has been trying to do to build its digital talent pipeline,” said Amy Liu, a vice president at the Brookings Institution and director of its Metropolitan Policy Program. “But we have to be very intentional about the people who will benefit from this growth,” Liu added. “Otherwise, we are going to further widen inequities in this region.” Advertisement Besides Amazon’s new offices, the “National Landing” corridor is anchored around a graduate engineering campus that Virginia Tech is building in Alexandria’s Potomac Yard neighborhood. The 3.5-acre facility is being funded in part by $545 million from Virginia state coffers, in addition to $50 million from Boeing. The weapons and jet manufacturer already has a 400-person office in Arlington’s Crystal City neighborhood, and it said it has no immediate plans to expand its footprint or shift over employees from Chicago aside from a few top executives. Terry Clower, a public policy professor at George Mason University’s Schar School of Policy and Government and the director of its Center for Regional Analysis, said that Boeing’s decision nonetheless gives National Landing a good set of “bragging rights.” Advertisement Boeing has also said it will build a research and technology hub to focus on innovating in cybersecurity, quantum sciences and other fields, though it has so far offered few details on where that hub will go or what it might look like. “If you put that [Boeing] on top of the Amazon HQ2 announcement and the presence of other significant tech sector employers, it casts the message that this place is great for tech businesses,” Clower said. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) As local officials seek to compete with other commercial centers around the D.C. region, as well as other “innovation districts” in the Northeast, such as Philadelphia’s University City or Kendall Square in Cambridge, Mass., that message is perfectly in tune with the booming vision they are pushing for National Landing. Advertisement According to a market impact study published in April, the area has 8 million square feet of new office space in the pipeline, with 9,000 new jobs in addition to those being created by Amazon. AT&T has rolled out plans to build out a 5G network meant to turn the neighborhood into a “smart city-at scale.\" What that means for the region as a whole, though, depends largely on whom you ask. Amazon jerseys on Boeing Field While Boeing has had a presence in Arlington since it picked up military contracts during World War I, the company moved its defense operations to Crystal City just as the county was facing a kind of existential crisis. Upon the 2005 recommendation of a federal panel, 17,000 military and defense contractors began moving out of the area. By about a decade later, the process known as Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) had emptied out about one-fifth of the office space in the neighborhood. Advertisement Boeing’s arrival at its current offices on Long Bridge Drive in 2016, then, served as a kind of counterpoint to that exodus. “They have been a pretty steadfast partner in Crystal City during a very challenging time for the area,” said Arlington County Board Chair Katie Cristol (D). “We were really concerned about Crystal City being hollowed out, but Boeing was willing to make an investment.” Unlike many of its more suburban neighbors, Arlington depends on commercial properties for about half of its tax revenue. Keeping office workers around was and still is essential to supporting county services without significantly raising taxes on homeowners. Yet, Cristol also pointed out that the aerospace giant’s contributions have gone beyond its taxes. In 2019, for instance, the company donated $10 million to the county to finance the construction and operation of a new aquatics center up the street, also fronting access fees for active duty military and their families. Advertisement In exchange, county officials named some of the park space in between the two structures after the aerospace company. Boeing Fields at Long Bridge Park Boeing offices Amazon offices National Landing Boeing Fields at Long Bridge Park Boeing offices Amazon offices National Landing Boeing Fields at Long Bridge Park Boeing offices Amazon offices National Landing Today, the Boeing Fields at Long Bridge Park are a hub for after-school activity. On one recent Tuesday evening, youth travel soccer teams ran drills on the turf as parents watched their toddlers on futuristic, rubber-floored areas to the side. Noemi Vargas, 49, had brought her sons to scooter around on the sidewalk as she scrolled through her phone, sitting on a bench across the street from Boeing’s glass-and-steel offices. The family had been making the short walk over from Pentagon City for years, but Vargas said she had no idea that the park was in part named after the company. “If it’s expensive now, it’s going to be impossible with Boeing,” Vargas, a stay-at-home mom, said in Spanish. “Not everyone is going to be able to stay in this area … But I guess it’s a good thing if they do bring jobs.” Advertisement A few yards away, Sebastian Edmunds stood on the sidelines of the soccer turf, chatting in a circle of parents as their daughters’ travel team dribbled balls up and down a pitch named after Boeing. One half of the team wore gray jerseys emblazoned on the back with Amazon logos. As a real estate agent, the Falls Church resident said he’s already seen how the presence of the e-retail giant has led to skyrocketing home values across Northern Virginia in the region’s white-hot real estate market. As a parent, he added, the presence of these tech companies represents greater opportunity for his kids. “When you have Amazon here, it’s very easy for a child to imagine going into tech,” Edmunds said, looking out at the scrimmage. “My daughter can say, ‘I’ll go to college and then come back and work for Boeing.’ ” A ‘clustering effect’ Ask any economic development official in Northern Virginia, and they are bound to share Edmunds’s conviction. Their plans to grow and develop a pipeline of young, diverse tech workers are deeply intertwined with their push to attract companies to National Landing and turn it into a tech hub. Advertisement “You can’t have a technology company right now without talent,” said Tracy Sayegh Gabriel, executive director of the National Landing Business Improvement District. “The labor market is very tight, it’s fiercely competitive. Having the proximity of that tech talent is essential to operations.” When Amazon announced a national search for a second North America headquarters, states like New York and Maryland were lambasted for offering billions in tax breaks and direct grants to the tech giant, which earned about $33.4 billion last year. But Virginia bet on the idea that investing in computer science graduates — and building the pipeline necessary to sustain it — would be more effective in luring Amazon and other major corporate heavyweights. And it appears to have worked: While Amazon stands to receive $550 million from state coffers, more of Virginia’s dollars are going toward the state’s $1 billion Tech Talent Investment Program. That initiative has set a goal of producing an additional 25,000 new graduates in computer science and related fields over two decades, many of them at Virginia Tech’s Alexandria campus. Boeing spokesman Connor Greenwood said that Boeing is taking no “economic incentives” from Virginia. Becca Glover, a spokeswoman for Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R), said it is possible that the state will ultimately provide the company with some financial incentives but that they would not be “significant.” Enrico Moretti, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley who has studied where and why companies locate their operations, said that decisions by both Amazon and Boeing to build headquarters in Arlington bodes well for such an education-centered approach. While Boeing has not directly addressed why it decided to move its headquarters to Arlington, the D.C. tech labor market is already large, well-educated, and offers a wide variety of specializations, he said. Any effort to widen that pool can only help produce what Moretti says appears to be a “clustering effect” at work with Boeing’s move. “If you attract a company like Amazon, the labor market becomes more attractive for future companies and future workers,” he said.

And yet, we’ve all seen this movie before. The coronavirus is not a rule follower. It doesn’t bend to wishes. More than 972,000 deaths so far in the United States and close to 80 million cases. Infection and death rates are low, for now. But hanging over the hopes for a successful return is the highly transmissible BA.2 subvariant of omicron, which accounts for as much as 70 percent of new infections in many parts of the United States. Even with that looming threat, revised Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance currently does not recommend masking in 99 percent of the nation’s counties. D.C. and surrounding localities have rolled back mask mandates. And most area schools have given students the option of whether to wear masks in class. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement For the immunocompromised, the return to normal can feel like watching life go by from the sidelines. Many think not enough is being done to protect them. Parents of young children are still waiting for a vaccine. Children of elderly parents still worry about spreading the virus to them. Last week, Washington Post reporters crisscrossed the region, visiting suburban ballfields and city bars, nursing homes and Metro cars, choir practice and a Girl Scout meeting, to gauge how people are negotiating a return to a vastly different normal. The Post's Jasmine Hilton shows what the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., looks like since coronavirus restrictions have been lifted. (Video: Jasmine Hilton/The Washington Post, Photo: The Washington Post) At museums on the Mall, a welcome return As the clock ticked from 9:59 to 10 a.m., Nat and Crystal Borchers headed in from the rain through the doors of the “big museum” with Lincoln, 7, and Denley, 5. Trips to the National Museum of Natural History, which reopened last June after shuttering for 461 days, have ticked up in recent weeks, with operators recording about 40,000 people visiting one weekend last month. It was the Oregon family’s first “big trip” since the pandemic started two years ago, when Denley wasn’t yet potty trained and Lincoln couldn’t tie his shoes. The four were at Disneyland when they heard the news of a novel coronavirus beginning to spread. “Our kids were so young,” Crystal, 42, said. “I think they just thought that’s how life was.” But on a recent weekday, the brother and sister got to see a Stegosaurus up close, place their hands on the cave man wall and “ooh and aah” at the Hope Diamond. The time spent inside most of the pandemic brought the family closer together outside of their busy schedules, and got them thinking about what’s most important. “We slowed life down a little bit, we got to be together a lot more,” Nat, 40, said. “We realized what we want to do. You know, we want to get out and see these things and show them,” Crystal added. As visitors passed each other in the Fossil Hall and Ocean Hall, there was a mix of masked and unmasked faces. By noon most halls were filling up, but the Borchers said they didn’t feel crowded. They still wore masks out of caution. It actually felt “somewhat back to normal,” Crystal said. Lincoln and Denley were ready for midday snacks. — Jasmine Hilton A quieter ICU, but covid’s impact lingers Lead nurse Mafereh Sesay tucked a white blanket over the shoulders of an elderly woman lying in the intensive care unit, only her brown eyes visible between her surgical mask and cap. A hand of God charm dangled from her neck. “How are you feeling today?” Sesay asked. “I’m not in pain at all,” the woman replied, over the hiss of monitors at Luminus Health Doctors Community Medical Center in Prince George’s County. An urgent voice on a loudspeaker interrupted: “Rapid response team 4-6-7.” Sesay breezed out of the patient’s room, removed her surgical gloves and pressed the hand sanitizer dispenser for a spritz. At the height of the omicron variant wave, covid-19 patients often occupied nearly all 18 ICU beds. Today there were none, and only two or three in the hospital at large, down from a peak of about 80. Many died. “We would just stand there and cry and then we move on,” said Sesay, a 59-year-old native of Sierra Leone. “It was tough.” That part is getting better. Gone are the red stop signs warning nurses entering covid patients’ rooms to don N95 masks, isolation gowns, surgical headgear and adhere to other precautions. Still, Sesay worries. “I am going to keep my mask on, even when I go to the grocery store. I’m going to keep it on as long as I can. A lot of people say, ‘No mask,’ my mask is on,” she said. Outside, the speaker blared again: “Code blue, 4-6-7.” — Jenna Portnoy Advertisement Story continues below advertisement From front-line heroes to afterthoughts Kevin Gamarra hoisted bags of groceries into an awaiting customer’s sport utility vehicle at a supermarket in Annandale, making small talk about the weather in halting English while hoping the man would pull out his wallet for a tip. The customer didn’t, driving away after a cheerful “Thank you!” Gamarra, who bags groceries for $12.50 an hour, didn’t take it personally. After all, this is what normal looks like. “Maybe the next one,” Gamarra said in Spanish. Grocery workers have again faded into the background after two surreal years when they were initially hailed as “front line heroes” for showing up. Not long after, they were pulled into the ugliness of pandemic politics, left to enforce mask mandates and answer for shortages in the global supply of toilet paper and other basic goods. “There was a lot of humiliation, discrimination and racism,” Gamarra said of the encounters. Inside the store, as soft-rock music played on overhead speakers, a continuing divide over the pandemic was on display. Most of the customers did not wear masks. Most of the workers did. Worries about getting sick, or bringing the virus home to loved ones, have not abated, even as the public appears ready to move on. Gamarra has dodged that concern at work. But he became infected during a trip to visit family in Bolivia last year, and said his illness could have been worse had he not been vaccinated. Wayne Haight, who works in the stockroom, had his mask on, even during a short break outside. News about another omicron variant spreading in Europe was enough reason to continue to be careful, he said. And it is a reminder that workers like him are still on the front lines, in harm’s way. “We could use more money,” Haight said. “People don’t realize what we’ve been facing.” — Antonio Olivo Funny makes a comeback It’s quiet at 12th and K streets NW on this mid-March Monday night. But 10 stories up, laughter, giggles and groans ripple through Wild Days, the Eaton DC hotel’s rooftop bar. It’s the bar’s weekly open-mic comedy night, the first since the mask mandate ended, and for two hours local comedians get five minutes and a microphone to capture the crowd’s enthusiasm or capitulate to its disdain. While little of the past two years has been funny, some comics, like the District’s Tim Miller, are able to find humor even from the highly contagious virus. “Let’s be honest,” Miller tells the crowd. “If you haven’t got covid by now, you ain’t got no friends.” The mostly unmasked audience roars. Then Miller admits he hasn’t gotten covid and the crowd laughs again. Dom Grayer of Stafford, Va., is emceeing this night’s showcase. Masks muffled laughs, he said, and nothing’s worse for a comic than silence. The end of the mandate has made it easier for him to read the crowd. “If you see a smile, you know you’re on to something,” Grayer said. “If you see a frown, you know you’re in trouble.” Comedy is a rough sport. But on this night, the diverse audience is smiling and friendly. “This is a nice, mixed little crowd,” said comedian Justin “Justo” Brooks of Baltimore as he took the mic. “I feel like I’m at a Trader Joe’s right now.” Comedy’s bounce back is a relief for Sean Joyce, the founder of Underground Comedy, which since 2013 has been booking shows at local venues including this one. Before the pandemic he was putting on about 650 shows a year. The shows stopped altogether for the first year of the pandemic. Last year he did about 300. “I think people are happiest if they just have some time to not think about the pandemic at all,” he said. Joyce is banking on a full return of funny. He plans to open a comedy club in Adams Morgan next month. — Joe Heim Seeking harmony, a choir re-forms Inside of First Baptist Church in Glenarden, Md., dozens of chorus members, many wearing masks, greeted each other with backslapping hugs, jokes and laughter before taking their seats in the rehearsal studio. First came an invocation, spoken over the hushed chords of organ music. Then the men’s chorus got down to business — raucous business, as the choir belted out a stirring version of Psalm 27, “The Lord is My Light and Salvation, Whom Shall I Fear?” As the world lurches back to a new normal — or “The New Next,” as the church’s Rev. Stephen Hurd prefers to call it — the men’s chorus rehearsal was a hybrid, with some attending in person and others linked by video. “It’s really, really good to see you guys and to see you back in this place like it used to be,” Mike McCoy, minister of music, said before cuing another song. Rufus Williams, 66, his finger shooting skyward, sang and swayed in the first row. Others moved in time around him, their hands cupped or clapping out the beat. “Come on now!” McCoy called. “I need some real energy. … You got knee problems, we got some oil around here. And we have some CBD oil, too.” When the song ended, McCoy shared a quick homily about how faith provides comfort in trying times. Later, he would also touch on several people who had died by suicide, he said, because of covid-related despair. He urged the men to pray to God but also find a friend or someone else to talk to, too, if depression threatened. And then the chorus jumped into a song featuring a solo by Keith Tyson. Tyson, who is blind, gripped the microphone and let his voice soar: “It is well with my soul.” Tyson, 50, of Forestville, Md., said that the gathering had been restorative after two years of isolation. “It looked like death was all around,” Tyson said. And now? “It’s like strength returning back to you,” he said. — Fredrick Kunkle Playing with a full deck once again It was her turn, and Wanda Dickens, 72, didn’t have any cards to play. She shook her head and laughed. “I am stuck,” she told Cookie Cook, 81. “Stuck, stuck, stuck. With nowhere to go.” For Dickens and Cook, card games were an escape. They helped the women forget the fear — and the boredom — that has for the past two years defined life inside Villa Rosa Nursing and Rehabilitation in Mitchellville, Md., and nursing homes nationwide. Games started after lunch. Their favorites were spades and bid whist. Usually, they played until evening. Unless the coronavirus was surging. Then, there were no games at all. “It’s like you’re in prison, you get out, then bam, you’re back in it again,” said Dickens, who at times was so desperate for an outlet she sneaked into the activity room to play cards alone. She didn’t ask Cook, who has twice survived the virus, because she didn’t want to get her in trouble. (“If I’m going to do wrong, let me do wrong by myself.”) “Thank Jesus,” Dickens said when administrator Barry Grofic told her this month that cards were again allowed, after being barred for most of the winter as the omicron variant swept through the 107-bed facility, and nursing homes across the nation. At the nationwide peak, there were nearly 50,000 cases and 1,526 deaths at nursing homes nationwide during a single week in January. At Villa Rosa, 11 residents — nine of them vaccinated — tested positive for the coronavirus last month, said Grofic, adding that thankfully almost all were asymptomatic. Life at Villa Rosa, both women said, still feels far from “normal.” But the women — who are vaccinated and boosted — hope things will get better one day, if people get vaccinated and keep wearing their masks. They’ve been dreaming of an outing to the casino. As their Friday afternoon game stretched on, Cook started to cough uncontrollably. It had happened at least once a day, every day, since her first bout of covid-19, she said. “You need some water?” Dickens asked, eyebrows raised in concern. Cook took a sip from her Styrofoam cup. Then she reached for the deck, cut it and dealt the next hand. — Rachel Chason The Post's Ian Duncan shows what transportation looks like at Washington's Union Station since coronavirus restrictions have been lifted. (Video: Ian Duncan/The Washington Post, Photo: The Washington Post) Cabdrivers took a hit during covid When the city began to shut down two years ago, Alfred Adedeji started using his taxi to deliver food rather than people. But running up to people’s homes to drop DoorDash deliveries proved to be a lot of exercise for the 68-year-old. “It’s probably good for young folks,” he said. So last April, when it looked like life might start moving again, he got back to regular taxi work. It was slow. Adedeji said he might wait at the taxi stand at Union Station for two hours for a meager fare. Longtime drivers say the pandemic has sped up the decline of the city’s taxi industry, which has faced stiff competition from Uber and Lyft. There are about 1,600 active taxi licenses in the District, down from 3,760 in March 2020, according to data from the Department of For-Hire Vehicles. But business has started picking up in the past few weeks. Adedeji was in that Union Station line again recently, during a lull between Amtrak arrivals. Now, taxi drivers are contending with high gas prices. Adedeji said his 2014 Ford Taurus gets about only 14 miles per gallon and he has to fill up daily. He said a $1 taxi fare surcharge the District approved this week “doesn’t help much.” And while masks are no longer required many places, federal rules still require them for taxi drivers and their passengers. Adedeji said it can be hard getting out-of-town visitors to wear one. “I don’t bother them,” he said. “They say they don’t wear it where they come from.” A train arrived and Adedeji pulled to the front of the line. He hauled the luggage of a man who had just arrived from New York into his trunk. It was a $12.33 fare. A 20 percent tip added about $2.50. Afterward, Adedeji returned to the station to join the back of the line again. — Ian Duncan Some conventions return Hundreds of people flocked to the Walter E. Washington Convention Center this week, paying up to $3,000 for an all-access pass to Satellite 2022. Some things can’t be done over Zoom. Vendors from every facet of the industry converged — from regulatory compliance workers to people hawking satellite parts or technology that keeps the dishes free of snow. That, in combination with panel discussions and networking opportunities, was enough to draw international interest — even amid a pandemic. “I love it! I’ve been high-fiving people all over the place!” said Martin Coleman, a 68-year-old consultant from the United Kingdom, who said his trip to the convention was his first overseas. He said he has saved money and is probably polluting less by moving more of his meetings with far-flung customers online, but that ultimately “the best ideas happen in a bar, with a beer.” In this exhibition hall, booths were set up in grid formation, creating a sort of miniature pop-up city. And although they work on the cutting edge of technology, many vendors were relying on some old tricks to attract customers, including goodies and candy. Nearly every vendor had swag — whether it be tote bags, or pens, or tiny balsam wood airplanes. Anne Cortez, 57, founder of the consulting firm Federal Strategies, stood near a high table covered with materials about her company — and tiny Dove brand chocolate hearts wrapped in foil. “I don’t want to in any way, shape or form to seem frivolous, because we take our work very seriously,” said Cortez, whose firm deals with the intricacies of federal regulations, “but people like chocolate.” The city’s convention attendees bring in hundreds of millions of dollars, staying in hotels, patronizing restaurants, visiting museums and shopping. This year, Destination DC estimates that it will draw 20 “citywide” conventions — gatherings that generate at least 2,500 on their busiest nights — which is five times the number of last year. That number doesn’t include smaller conventions like Satellite. Cortez and a colleague, both from Tucson, visited the stalwarts Jaleo and Zaytinya, two of D.C.’s well-known eateries. Manuel Lobeira, CEO of Acorde Technologies in Spain, went to a Capitals game, and also purchased Wizards tickets but could not go because his plane was delayed. He planned to hit up some of his favorite spots: Fogo de Chao, Capital Grille and Founding Farmers. And like many of the attendees, he made time to visit the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum, where he picked up two child-sized spacesuit costumes for his kids. — Moriah Balingit Punching back at the pandemic They are not remotely in the same league, but Angelie Pham — a 5-foot-2, 46-year-old from Bethesda weighing in at 116 pounds — refused to wilt against her opponent, the professional featherweight boxer Sulaiman Segawa. “Coach Sula,” as he is known, was conducting a practice drill with Pham last week at Urban Boxing Bethesda, pushing her to punch him anywhere she could. He stalked Pham around the ring, bending forward, then stepping back, egging her on. Pham punched back repeatedly, jabbing him in the shoulders, the chest, the waist. It was a good thing the featherweight was wearing padded body armor: The mother of two spared no punishment. Pham, who took up boxing three years ago, has always regarded herself as a fierce fighter. But she’s been ducking, weaving and launching uppercuts with a little more vigor ever since the studio went maskless late last month. Finally, she doesn’t feel like she’s suffocating or being blinded when the mask slides up her face and covers her eyes at the worst possible moment. During the class, Pham joined three other students, all men: a colorectal surgeon from Bethesda, a steel company executive from Chevy Chase, Md., and a construction company project estimator from Northeast Washington. Only one person wore a mask — the doctor. They have hated the masks. What good can they do in a sport where two people square off face-to-face dripping with sweat? After class, everyone dashed out to return to work. Pham, though, knew there was a good chance she would encounter more sparring later in the day. She and her husband have a 12-year-old girl and a 7-year-old boy. The children occasionally scream and fight. For this, Pham has a solution: a punching bag in the basement. “I tell my kids, ‘When you want to punch someone for real, like your sister or brother, go to the basement and hit the bag and then come back,’ ” she said. “It only takes two or three minutes.” — Ian Shapira New commuters, old headaches for Metro As many office workers emerge from their homes after two years of telework and head back to their offices, many of the places their work lives revolved around have changed — as has the subway system they were accustomed to for their commutes. Service continues to suffer as Metrorail operates with a shortage of trains that began more than five months ago after a federal investigation uncovered a safety defect that affected 60 percent of Metro’s rail cars and forced them temporarily out of service. Instead of the shiny silver, modern 7000-series rail cars, commuters board trains decades older that arrive every 20 minutes on some lines. While buses have been running about 70 percent full for much of the pandemic, Metrorail had been mired at about 20 percent for months — until two weeks ago, when ridership jumped above 33 percent. The collision of increased passengers, a rail system forced to run limited service and a pandemic that remains a health hazard adds to the unease many consistent and returning riders feel. Pauline Parnell has ridden Metro all through the pandemic, taking the Green Line from Prince George’s Plaza to the Shaw-Howard University station to get to Howard University Hospital, where she works as an environmental services technician. Metro has been “pretty consistent” for her except earlier in the pandemic, when Metrorail cut operating hours to 11 p.m. — a half-hour before her shift ended. The temporary cutback, made to limit the number of front-line workers exposed to coronavirus risks, forced her to pay as much as $50 for Uber rides — money she said she had to earn by working overtime. Since Metro restored service hours to midnight and 1 a.m., Parnell’s concerns shifted to the cleanliness of cars and her personal safety, riding mostly empty cars for months. Now as rail cars fill back up, Parnell’s fear of the coronavirus increases. “When it’s empty, you’re not feeling safe,” she said. “When you start to see more people, some cars get too full, right?” — Justin George Krista Woods enjoyed St. Patrick's Day at Spanky's Shenanigan in Leesburg, Va., on March 17. (Video: Clarence Williams/The Washington Post, Photo: The Washington Post) St. Patrick’s Day without a worry Krista Woods selected video and raised her phone high above the swaying crowd at Spanky’s Shenanigan’s in Leesburg as the cover band belted out “Wagon Wheel.” Perched in front of the stage, Woods moved slowly in a circle as the camera captured the height of St. Patrick’s Day revelry. There was a lot to take in. The bar hadn’t seen a crowd this big for the annual celebration of all things Irish since ... ever. Smiles were everywhere. Shamrocks were pinned to the wall. Faces scrunched from the slow burn of liquor shots. Beer spilled and was swilled from plastic cups. Dad bods danced. TV screens showed the Kentucky men’s basketball team being upset in the NCAA Tournament. Patrons sang happy birthday to a 57-year-old. “Play AC/DC!” a man shouted. The band obliged him a few songs later. The Shenanigan’s staff spent weeks prepping for this night, packing walk-in coolers with beer and putting every hand on deck. The customers didn’t disappoint. Bathroom lines were back, even for the men’s room, where old schoolmates bumped into one another and quickly caught up. Owner Azmi Zarou posted up in the kitchen to help expedite food and his general manager shook a cocktail shaker behind one of three bars. By the end of happy hour, eight Guinness kegs were kicked. As Woods completed her video loop, she pulled down her phone and raised her hands again to join the dancing. Her camera failed to capture one object common to pandemic life. Not a single mask appeared in view. — Clarence Williams Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Getting their kicks — and their snacks In the artificial green grass oasis of Draper Drive Park in Fairfax City, two soccer fields pulsated with the movement of six simultaneous youth soccer practices Monday evening. Parents stood and chatted. Kids on the sidelines juggled balls on their feet, insulted each other’s hair and killed time until their own practices began. It was a scene straight out of 2019. And everyone agreed that was the last time players, parents and coaches felt comfortable enough to do what they were doing Monday. For the under-11 Fairfax Police Youth Club recreation league, it was the first time without masks for players on the sideline and parents, coaches and spectators, said coach Estuardo Rodriguez. Also gone were the cones and markers separating everyone’s water bottles and gear. “It’s just a lot more relaxed,” he said. “There were a lot more concerns,” Rodriguez said, as a wayward ball rocketed past his head and off the goal post. “You had to be a little more aware. This time, it’s like a deep sigh.” Sign-ups were way up for the FPYC soccer league. Coach Ken O’Donnell said his team of under-11 girls had gone from 12 to 14 players, with 11 of the previous 12 girls returning. ”Everyone’s coming back, everyone’s excited,” he said. At practice, there were no masks in sight, on or off the fields. Parents and coaches both noted that the crowds of family members who had tended to stay away the past few seasons were back at last. So, too, were the post-game snacks. Instead of teammates standing around munching chips and juice, “it was ‘Grab your snacks and leave!’ ” Rodriguez said. “Now the kids are feeling they’re less strained, and that by itself leads to a lot more enjoyment for the kids.” Rodriguez asked his players for suggestions for postgame snacks Monday. — Tom Jackman The Post's Omari Daniels shows what Mission in Dupont Circle looks like since coronavirus restrictions have lifted. (Video: Omari Daniels/The Washington Post, Photo: The Washington Post) Unmasked and unbothered Joey Crenshaw, mask in his hand, took a seat at an outdoor table at Mission restaurant in Dupont Circle as he waited for his friends to arrive on a Friday evening. George Washington University law school students chatted at a happy hour upstairs. Patrons lined up to get in. Crenshaw’s routine hasn’t changed a lot since the early months of the pandemic. He works from home and masks up when taking the Metro. He has twice tested positive for the coronavirus. But he also gets out to enjoy himself. “I’m just living life as I can,” Crenshaw said. Mission, too, had to adapt, closing at the outset of the pandemic and then limiting service to takeout and delivery before ultimately reopening with outdoor seating, said Reed Landry, Mission’s managing partner. “It was a real tough time last year and a lot of us were worried,” Landry said, attributing some of Mission’s success to grants from the city that helped sustain restaurants during the pandemic. Crenshaw took a call over the chatter of dinner conversations and blaring music. He chuckled. One of his friends had gone to Mission Navy Yard by mistake. Another call. Crenshaw’s friend had arrived. As they waited for the others, they debated what drinks to order. An Orange Crush pitcher was appealing, but not part of a happy-hour deal. “We’re just gonna go with the margarita,” Crenshaw finally decided. “No salt.” — Omari Daniels The Post's Karina Elwood shows what a Girl Scouts meeting in Virginia looks like since coronavirus restrictions lifted. (Video: Karina Elwood/The Washington Post, Photo: The Washington Post) Girl Scouts prepared for a return Bianca Gomez groaned when her mother awakened her at 7:45 a.m. on a recent Saturday. But Girl Scout duty called. At Marymount University in Arlington, the 13-year-old filtered into the library auditorium with dozens of other girls as reggaeton music played overhead. They were greeted by cheery staff members, handing out bags of Cheetos, seating Scouts and taking song requests. Gomez, like most of the nearly 200 girls in attendance, wore a mask. “It’s my first big event since everything happened, and I don’t know how to feel about it,” she said. “I’m excited, but at the same time I’m nervous.” Saturday’s Encuentro de las Chicas Latinas event, where girls earned their “college knowledge” patch, included a panel discussion about college preparedness and a tour of the university’s campus. It was among the largest in-person events the Girl Scouts have hosted since they shifted to hybrid programming in 2020, and the first time the event has been held in person since 2019. The Girl Scouts Nation’s Capital Council serves more than 3,000 troops and 70,000 members across the region. Bianca Gomez ultimately was happy to wake up early again. And her mother, Gabriela Gomez, was excited to see her daughter back in a group setting, connecting with other Scouts and finding some sense of normalcy. “She’s nervous, but you know, we have to keep moving forward,” she said. — Karina Elwood About this story"
