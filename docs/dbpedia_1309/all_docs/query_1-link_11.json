        "text": "Best known for his starring role as Det. Sonny Crockett on the hugely successful TV series Miami Vice (1984), Don Johnson is one of the stars who really defined the 1980s. As James \"Sonny\" Crockett he went toe-to-toe with drug dealers, pimps, prostitutes, assassins, illegal arms-dealers and crooked cops on a weekly basis from 1984 to 1989, appearing in a grand total of 110 episodes. The show, which was executive-produced by four time Oscar-nominated director, producer and writer Michael Mann, paired Johnson with the equally cool Philip Michael Thomas as Det. Ricardo Tubbs and the calm and stoic presence of Edward James Olmos as Lt. Martin Castillo. It revolutionized television with its modern fashion, pop music, unique style and use of real locations. Johnson typically wore $1000 Armani, Versace and Hugo Boss suits over pastel cotton T-shirts, drove a Ferrari 365 GTS/4 Daytona (later a Ferrari Testarossa) and lived on an Endeavour 42-foot sailboat named \"St. Vitus' Dance\" with his pet alligator Elvis. He also had full use of an offshore powerboat. Still, \"Miami Vice\" had not only style but substance, and his portrayal of the Vietnam veteran turned vice detective turned Sonny Crockett into the world's favorite cop. For his work on \"Miami Vice\" Johnson won a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a TV Series in 1986, and was nominated in the same category a year later. He also picked up an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 1985.\n\nJohnson was born in Flat Creek, Missouri, the son Eva Lea \"Nell\" (Wilson), a beautician, and Wayne Fred Johnson, a farmer. As a kid, he wanted to become a professional bowler. Later, after a few brushes with the law at a young age, he discovered acting. After working on the stage for a while he ventured into films and television, but was not able to break into stardom despite, among other things, starring in the sci-fi cult classic Der Junge mit dem Hund (1975).\n\nJohnson starred in four failed TV pilots before landing his career-high role on \"Miami Vice\", which propelled him to superstardom. He directed four highly praised episodes of the show. He balanced his work on the series by appearing in a praised TV-movie adaption of the William Faulkner novel Flammender Sommer (1985) and the feature Sweethearts Dance - Liebe ist mehr als nur ein Wort (1988) with Susan Sarandon. After the series ended he focused solely on his film career. Although movies like Dead Bang - Kurzer Prozess (1989), The Hot Spot - Spiel mit dem Feuer (1990) and Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man (1991) did not fare well with the critics, quite a few of them have obtained a considerable cult following, with fans praising them as all being quality contributions to their genre. His film work has given Johnson the opportunity to work with legendary filmmakers like John Frankenheimer, Sidney Lumet and Dennis Hopper.\n\nAfter working steadily, Johnson returned to TV in 1996 with the cop show Nash Bridges (1996). The show, which Johnson created and produced, did very well. It co-starred Cheech Marin and Jodi Lyn O'Keefe. Johnson played the title role, a captain in the San Francisco PD's Special Investigations Unit. He was again paired with a flashy vehicle, this time an electric-yellow 1971 Plymouth Barracuda convertible. After \"Nash Bridges\" went off the air Johnson kept a low profile, but continued to appear in films and on television. He starred in the failed WB courtroom drama Just Legal (2005), which was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, and traveled to Europe to make the Norwegian screwball comedy Lange flate ball√¶r II (2008) and the Italian films Bastardi (2008) and Torno a vivere da solo (2008). As a supporting actor, he's been seen in mainstream films such as Machete (2010), Django Unchained (2012) and Knives Out: Mord ist Familiensache (2019).\n\nJohnson had two pre-fame marriages that were annulled within a matter of days. In the early 1970s, he lived with rock groupie Pamela Des Barres. In 1972, Tippi Hedren, his co-star in The Harrad Experiment (1973), allowed him to date her daughter Melanie Griffith despite the fact she was only 14 and he was 22; the relationship culminated in a six-month marriage during 1976. From 1981 to 1985, he lived with actress Patti D'Arbanville and they had one son together. After short-lived liaisons with Cybill Shepherd, Barbra Streisand and a barely legal Uma Thurman, he remarried Griffith in 1989. The couple divorced again in 1996, after she left him for Antonio Banderas. Johnson was engaged to \"Nash Bridges\" co-star O'Keefe, but broke it off before they made it to the altar. Since 1999 he's been married to former debutante Kelley Phleger, with whom he has three children.\n\nPhilip Michael Thomas - the multi-talented performer best known as Detective Rico Tubbs in the iconic 1980s TV series Miami Vice (1984) - made his Broadway debut in 1971 in the Pulitzer Prize-winning play No Place to Be Somebody...and hasn't looked back since.\n\nIn a remarkable career that spans nearly four decades, PMT has worked with some of the top stage, screen, and recording personalities in the world.\n\nHe first guest starred on TV in 1973 in the pilot for the series Pilot (1973), followed by parts in Good Times (1974), Make-Up und Pistolen (1974), Medical Center (1969), Wonder Woman (1978)_, _Starsky and Hutch (1978)_, and Trapper John, M.D. (1979) before landing the role on Miami Vice (1984) in 1984 that made him a household name - and took him on a whirlwind tour of the globe and into the presence of heads of state (including President Ronald Reagan and Nelson Mandela), fellow celebrities, and countless adoring fans.\n\nDespite world-wide stardom as an actor of both stage and screen, it is music that is PMT's biggest passion. He wrote his first song at the age of 11 and, over the next 40 years, wrote, composed, and sung everything from Gospel to R&B to pop standards to rock. One long-time friend recently referred to the musical side of PMT as \"an undiscovered diamond.\"\n\nDuring the stratospheric years of Miami Vice (1984-1989), PMT released two highly regarded albums: Livin' the Book of My Life (1985) and Somebody (1988), both on his own Starship Records label, with distribution by industry giant Atlantic Records. Although much loved by fans to this day, his albums didn't sell as well as expected (perhaps due to a wide range of musical styles that defied pigeonhole) and remain out of print, although they often fetch a tidy sum on eBay. PMT is considering reissuing his solo albums with bonus tracks sometime in 2007 or 2008.\n\nThe power of imagination and love to overcome circumstances is a theme that runs through the fabric of his life. He cites singing \"The Impossible Dream\" (from Man of La Mancha) while at Oakwood College in 1967 as a turning point for him.\n\nConsidered by long-time friends and family members alike to be one of the most compassionate, spiritual, and generous men they've ever known, PMT credits his uplifting, positive outlook on life to a vegetarian diet, regular exercise, life-long learning, friends he's made through the years, and books such as The Holy Bible, Napoleon Hill's Think and Grow Rich, and Paramahansa Yogananda's Autobiography of a Yogi, among many others.\n\nPMT loves Florida and has chosen to make his home there instead of L.A. or New York as do most of his colleagues. Naturally, this keeps him out of the limelight, but it's a mistake to assume that just because his name isn't regularly splashed across the tabloids that he's not keeping himself busy. In fact, he is working (2007) on his autobiography, his official web site, reading scripts, performing, writing music, and helping young performers reach the heights he has reached - and doing it all with characteristic charm, grace, vitality...and with his trademark banner, \"Treasure beyond measure!\" flying proudly overhead.\n\nSaundra Santiago is a versatile actress who has worked in television, movies and on the Broadway stage. She holds a BFA from the University of Miami, and an MFA from Southern Methodist University. She is also a member of the Actor's Studio in New York City. She was born and raised in the Bronx.\n\nYou can catch Saundra on the many episodics she's starred in such as \"Gotham,\" \"True Detective,\" & the upcoming, \"Blue Bloods.\" She portrayed the recurring role of \"Marciela\" in the Fox series, \"Gang Related.\" She played Sonia Braga's sister for Hallmark's Movie, \"Meddling Mom.\" Living in Manhattan, she has guest starred on most NYC's based television shows, such as \"Person of Interest,\" \"Law and Order,\" and the short lived, \"The Unusuals,\" & \"Cashmere Mafia.\" She recurred as Karen Gonzales in the first season of the Glenn Close FX hit, \"Damages.\" Her favorite recurring role or roles, for that matter, were playing twin sisters, Jeannie and Joan Cusamano on HBO's monster hit, \"The Sopranos.\" She is most known for her series regular role as Gina Calabrese in the cult show, \"Miami Vice\" for which she played in for its full 5 seasons. She's performed opposite the great Sidney Poiter, Bill Cosby and Elizabeth Montgomery in several MOWs. She's danced with Al Pacino in \"Carlito's Way,\" mothered Rosario Dawson in \"25th Hour,\" and done many Indies, and shorts. Her latest indie, \"The House that Jack Built,\" was just released in movie theaters, and VOD. Saundra made her Broadway debut in the 1st Tony Award nominated Arthur Miller play, \"A View from the Bridge\" as Catherine starring opposite Tony LoBianco. She was last seen on Broadway in the Tony Award winning \"Nine,\" starring Antonio Banderas. She continued to perform on Broadway and Off in musicals and plays, including \"The Glass Menagerie\" as Amanda Wingfield, \"The House of Bernarda Alba,\" the Tony Award nominated musical, \"Chronicle of a Death Foretold,\" \"Hello Again,\" \"Spike Heels,\" (with Kevin Bacon), and even toured the states and Canada with \"Evita\" as Eva Peron. You can hear Saundra singing on two musical recordings of \"The House of Bernarda Alba,\" and \"Nine.\" She also sang on two of the six Johnny Carson shows she guested on. On daytime, Saundra created the role of \"Carmen Santos\" on CBS's longest running soap opera, Guiding Light. For her role, Santiago was the 2002 recipient of an Alma Award for Ouststanding Actress in a Daytime Drama and nominated several times. She stepped in the portray Carlotta Vega on ABC's \"One Life to Live\" in its final years.\n\nYou can occasionally catch Saundra singing at the several cabaret clubs in NYC.\n\nBorn Alexander Viespi, Jr. in Floral Park, New York in 1933, handsome, often mustachioed Alex Cord was stricken with polio at the age of 12. Confined to a hospital and iron lung for a long time, he overcame the illness after being sent to a Wyoming ranch for therapy. He soon regained his dream and determination of becoming a jockey or professional horseman.\n\nA high school dropout at the age of sixteen, he grew up to be too tall to be a jockey so he joined the rodeo circuit and earned a living riding bulls and bareback horses. During another extended hospital stay, this time suffering major injuries after being thrown by a bull at a rodeo in New York City's Madison Square Garden, he reevaluated his life's direction and decided to finish his high school education by way of night school. A voracious reader during his long convalescence, he later studied and received his degree in literature at New York University.\n\nProdded by an interest in acting, Alex received dramatic training at the Actors Studio and began his professional career in summer stock (The Compass Players in St. Louis, Missouri) and at the American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Connecticut where he played \"Laertes\" in a production of \"Hamlet\". A British producer saw his promise and invited him to London where he co-starred in four plays (\"Play With a Tiger\", \"The Rose Tattoo\", \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" and \"The Umbrella\"). He was nominated for the \"Best Actor Award\" by the London Critics' Circle for the first-mentioned play.\n\nHe sought a Hollywood \"in\" and found one via his equestrian skills in the early 1960s. Steady work came to him on such established western TV series as Am Fu√ü der Blauen Berge (1959) and Ge√§chtet (1965) and that extended itself into acting roles on crime action series (Route 66 (1960) and Gnadenlose Stadt (1958)). Gaining a foothold in feature films within a relatively short time, he starred or co-starred in more than 30 feature films, including Die Gierigen (1965), San Fernando (1966), Stiletto (1969) and Auftrag Mord (1968).\n\nAfter his film career declined in the late 1970s he turned to action adventure overseas with the \"spaghetti western\" Mehr tot als lebendig (1967) [A Minute to Pray, A Second to Die] and the British war drama The Last Grenade (1970) with Stanley Baker and Richard Attenborough. Around that time as well, he played the murderer opposite Sam Jaffe's old man in Edgar Allan Poe's dramatic short, The Tell-Tale Heart (1971). It was TV, however, that provided more career stability. Cord has more than 300 credits, including roles in Hotel (1983), Fantasy Island (1977), Simon und Simon (1981), Jake und McCabe - Durch dick und d√ºnn (1987), Kobra, √ºbernehmen Sie (1966), Walker, Texas Ranger (1993) and Mord ist ihr Hobby (1984). He situated himself in a number of series, notably Airwolf (1984), in which he co-starred with Jan-Michael Vincent and Ernest Borgnine as the mysterious white-suited, eye-patched, cane-using \"Michael Archangel\".\n\nLater commercial interest was drawn from his title role in Grauadler (1977), a remake of the John Wayne film, Der schwarze Falke (1956), in which he played the Indian kidnapper of Ben Johnson's daughter. Lana Wood, sister of star Natalie Wood (who appeared in the original), also co-starred in this film. Alex can still be seen from time to time in low-budget films and the occasional television appearance, but other interests took up his time. His last film role was in the dismissible thriller Fire from Below (2009) in support of Kevin Sorbo.\n\nAlex's love for horses extended itself into work for numerous charities and benefits. He was a regular competitor in the Ben Johnson Pro-Celebrity Rodeos that raised money for children's charities, and he is one of the founders of the Chukkers for Charity Celebrity Polo Team which has raised more than $3 million for worthy causes. He chairs \"Ahead with Horses\", an organization that provides therapeutic riding programs for the physically and emotionally challenged. Alex also turned to writing, thus far publishing several novels including A Feather in the Rain (2005), Days of the Harbinger (2013), The Man Who Would Be God (2014 and High Moon (2016). He has also sold three screenplays.\n\nThe actor's three marriages all ended in divorce. His second wife was British-born actress Joanna Pettet and third, Susannah, was a horse trainer. He had three children -- Toni Aluisa, Wayne and Damien Zachary. His son by Pettet, Damien, died tragically in 1995 of a heroin overdose at the age of 26.\n\nErnest Borgnine was born Ermes Effron Borgnino on January 24, 1917 in Hamden, Connecticut. His parents were Anna (Boselli), who had emigrated from Carpi (MO), Italy, and Camillo Borgnino, who had emigrated from Ottiglio (AL), Italy. As an only child, Ernest enjoyed most sports, especially boxing, but took no real interest in acting. At age 18, after graduating from high school in New Haven, and undecided about his future career, he joined the United States Navy, where he stayed for ten years until leaving in 1945. After a few factory jobs, his mother suggested that his forceful personality could make him suitable for a career in acting, and Borgnine promptly enrolled at the Randall School of Drama in Hartford. After completing the course, he joined Robert Porterfield's famous Barter Theatre in Abingdon, Virginia, staying there for four years, undertaking odd jobs and playing every type of role imaginable. His big break came in 1949, when he made his acting debut on Broadway playing a male nurse in \"Harvey\".\n\nIn 1951, Borgnine moved to Los Angeles to pursue a movie career, and made his film debut as Bill Street in The Whistle at Eaton Falls (1951). His career took off in 1953 when he was cast in the role of Sergeant \"Fatso\" Judson in Verdammt in alle Ewigkeit (1953). This memorable performance led to numerous supporting roles as \"heavies\" in a steady string of dramas and westerns. He played against type in 1955 by securing the lead role of Marty Piletti, a shy and sensitive butcher, in Marty (1955). He won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, despite strong competition from Spencer Tracy, Frank Sinatra, James Dean and James Cagney. Throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, Borgnine performed memorably in such films as M√§dchen ohne Mitgift (1956), Eisstation Zebra (1968) and Ein Zug f√ºr zwei Halunken (1973). Between 1962 and 1966, he played Lt. Commander Quinton McHale in the popular television series McHale's Navy (1962). In early 1984, he returned to television as Dominic Santini in the action series Airwolf (1984) co-starring Jan-Michael Vincent, and in 1995, he was cast in the comedy series Ein Single kommt immer allein (1995) as doorman Manny Cordoba. He also appeared in several made-for-TV movies.\n\nErnest Borgnine has often stated that acting was his greatest passion. His amazing 61-year career (1951 - 2012) included appearances in well over 100 feature films and as a regular in three television series, as well as voice-overs in animated films such as Charlie - Ein himmlischer Held (1996), Small Soldiers (1998), and a continued role in the series SpongeBob Schwammkopf (1999). Between 1973 until his death, Ernest was married to Tova Traesnaes, who heads her own cosmetics company. They lived in Beverly Hills, California, where Ernest assisted his wife between film projects. When not acting, Ernest actively supported numerous charities and spoke tirelessly at benefits throughout the country. He has been awarded several honorary doctorates from colleges across the United States as well as numerous Lifetime Achievement Awards. In 1996, Ernest purchased a bus and traveled across the United States to see the country and meet his many fans. On December 17, 1999, he presented the University of North Alabama with a collection of scripts from his film and television career, due to his long friendship with North Alabama alumnus and actor George Lindsey (died May 6, 2012), who was an artist in residence at North Alabama.\n\nErnest Borgnine passed away aged 95 on July 8, 2012, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, of renal failure. He is survived by his wife Tova, their children and his younger sister Evelyn (1926-2013)\n\nThe son of a sales clerk and a department store owner, Bill Bixby was the sixth-generation Californian born as Wilfred Bailey Bixby, on January 22, 1934, in San Francisco, California. An only child growing up in the 1940s and 1950s, he attended schools in the same area, took ballroom dance lessons, before attending Lowell High School, where he excelled in drama. After his graduation from high school, he attended San Francisco City College, where he majored in drama. He transferred to the University of California-Berkeley, where he majored in the pre-law program, but never stopped falling in love with his interest in acting. After almost graduating, he left his native San Francisco, to travel to Los Angeles, where he became a lifeguard and a bellhop.\n\nTwo years later, in 1959, two executives noticed him and hired him immediately for commercial work and modeling, in Detroit, Michigan. At the same time, he auditioned for theater roles. He joined the Detroit Civic Theatre Company and made his professional stage debut in the musical, \"The Boy Friend.\" Long after his trip to Michigan, he continued doing commercial work and made numerous guest appearances on popular TV sitcoms.\n\nHe made his TV debut in an episode of The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis (1959). He also did many other roles, most notably as \"Charles Raymond\" in The Joey Bishop Show (1961). After many guest and recurring roles, he landed a co-starring role opposite Ray Walston in Mein Onkel vom Mars (1963), in which he portrayed a newspaper reporter playing host to a visitor from another planet. After the first season, it became a hit and Bixby became a household name to millions of fans who liked the show. The show was going well until its cancellation in 1966, which left Bixby in the dark, for the time being. However, he finally got the chance to go onto the big screen. The first of the four post-\"Martian\" 60s movies he played in was the Western, Der Tag der Abrechnung (1966). The following year, he played in Doktor - Sie machen Witze! (1967) and, soon after, he was approached by Elvis Presley to appear in both Nur nicht Million√§r sein (1967), and Speedway (1968). Afterwards, he once again returned to series television, this time playing widowed father, \"Tom Corbett\", on Eddies Vater (1969), based on the popular 1963 movie. After its first season, it became a much bigger hit than his first show and Bixby, heretofore one of Hollywood's most confirmed bachelors, changed his views on marriage and family, subsequently taking actress Brenda Benet as his bride and fathering a son. He also tried his hand at directing an episode of the series, called \"Gifts Are For Giving,\" about Norman's highly treasured gift. After completing its second season, Bixby received an Emmy nomination for Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, but didn't win. By its third season in 1972, the show had bad scripts and ABC decided to pull the plug.\n\nOnce again, Bixby was not long out of work and was offered a chance to star in a lead role as \"Anthony Dorian/Anthony Blake,\" on his first and only NBC dramatic series called, Der Magier (1973). The show focused on Anthony performing magic tricks which helped people who were in trouble, and in real-life, Bill became a fine magician, performing to both children and adults. But sadly, the show was canceled after one season due to its expensive costs.\n\nAfter a seven-year absence from the big screen, he co-starred in another western, opposite Don Knotts and Tim Conway, in Die Semmelkn√∂delbande (1975). Like most of the theatrical movies he did, it was not a blockbuster at the box office, but was still an average hit. In late 1977, he was offered the role of \"Dr. David Bruce Banner,\" in a two-hour pilot called, Der unglaubliche Hulk (1977). About a physician/scientist who turned into a green monster whenever he became angry, the idea appealed to CBS, and several months later, they premiered a new science fiction-dramatic series, called, Der unglaubliche Hulk (1977). When it debuted as a mid-season replacement, it became the #1 show in the United States, and in many other countries. His character became famous for ripping up shirts each time he turned into the Hulk, played by bodybuilder Lou Ferrigno. Bixby had wanted to direct some episodes, but the time he had to spend in the make-up chair for the transformation sequences made that problematical, and he managed to helm only one segment, \"Bring Me the Head of the Hulk,\" in the fourth season. The series was canceled in 1981 (although the last few episodes didn't air until 1982).\n\nBixby, once again, came back to series television, acting in, producing and directing his last sitcom, Goodnight, Beantown (1983), on which he played \"Matt Cassidy.\" Chosen for the role of \"Jennifer Barnes,\" was one of Bixby's old friends, Mariette Hartley, who had won an Emmy for her guest appearance in Der unglaubliche Hulk (1977) as Banner's second wife. The two played co-anchor newscasters of a Boston television station whose sparring on and off the air developed into friendship and respect. Discounting a brief, inconsequential return to the network's schedule in the summer of 1984, the series lasted for less than a year, from April 1983 to January 1984.\n\nBixby now decided to concentrate on directing and worked on Wizards and Warriors (1983), Goodnight, Beantown (1983) and Sledge Hammer (1986). He also directed the pilot for a New York spy series, \"Rockhopper.\" He also appeared in front of the camera as the host of the daytime anthology series, True Confessions (1985), which dealt with real-life crises of everyday people. Bixby additionally served as host for two shows targeting younger viewers: \"Against the Odds,\" a series of biographies of prominent people, frequently from history, for the Nickelodeon cable channel; and \"Once Upon a Classic,\" a collection of British TV adaptations of literary classics on PBS.\n\nHe came back to reprise his role of \"Dr. David Banner\" from Der unglaubliche Hulk (1977) by acting in, producing, and directing the three spin-off movies: Die R√ºckkehr des unheimlichen Hulk (1988), Der unheimliche Hulk vor Gericht (1989) and Der Tod des unheimlichen Hulk (1990). He also directed TV movies such as Ein Baby kommt selten allein (1991) and Zwei Asse schlagen wieder zu (1991).\n\nIn April 1991, while directing one of his last movies, he became very ill and was diagnosed with prostate cancer. He underwent surgery and by December, his cancer seemed to be in remission, so he came back to guest star as \"Nick Osborne\" in a two-hour TV movie/pilot called Dick van Dyke - Diagnose Mord (1992). In mid-1992, while his cancer continued to be in remission, Bixby returned to work as a director to direct several episodes of the popular NBC sitcom, Blossom (1990), where he became the main director of the show. At first, he hid his illness from the cast and crew, until one of the producers found out, and then he announced publicly that he wanted to continue working until he could no longer do so. Prior to going public with his cancer, he directed a TV movie starring Roseanne Barr and Tom Arnold, The Woman Who Loved Elvis (1993), which was his final directing project.\n\nUnfortunately, the cancer returned by mid-1993 and, on November 21, 1993, six days after directing his last episode on \"Blossom\" (1991), Bill Bixby died at age 59 in his home after a two-year battle with cancer. For over 30 years, he was in great demand and his big roles and directing credits have been a personal testimony to his fans. His life is gone, but his legacy lives on for years to come.\n\nDavid Hasselhoff has become one of the most recognizable faces on television and throughout the world. Aside from starring in Knight Rider (1982) and Baywatch - Die Rettungsschwimmer von Malibu (1989), he is also an accomplished singer and popular recording artist.\n\nDavid Michael Hasselhoff was born on July 17, 1952 in Baltimore, Maryland, to Dolores Therese (Mullinex) and Joe Hasselhoff (Joseph Vincent Hasselhoff), a business executive. He is of German (from his paternal grandfather), English, and Irish descent. The acting bug first hit when David was seven and so he took acting, singing and dancing lessons. He was very shy off stage in front of girls because he was tall and thin, but when he was on stage he was in his element. Due to his father's work, his family (he has four sisters) moved around frequently. He initially thought his career was going to go in the direction of musicals and Broadway.\n\nAmerican audiences first came to know Hasselhoff when he portrayed the popular \"Dr. Snapper Foster\" for six seasons on CBS's soap opera, Schatten der Leidenschaft (1973). Lured by NBC's Brandon Tartikoff to move from daytime to prime time, Hasselhoff went on to star as \"Michael Knight\" in NBC's hit series Knight Rider (1982). The role garnered him a \"People's Choice Award\" for most popular actor and the show became a huge success overseas. The success of Knight Rider (1982) resulted in Hasselhoff's first major international following. When the show ended, Hasselhoff launched a successful recording career in Europe. In 1989, \"Looking for Freedom\" remained in the number one spot on the German charts for eight consecutive weeks. He has continued to perform regularly in concert and has released nine albums to date.\n\nHasselhoff returned to episodic television as Mitch Buchannon on Baywatch - Die Rettungsschwimmer von Malibu (1989) when the show debuted on NBC in 1989. Though it enjoyed good ratings, the network canceled the series after only one season. Undeterred, Hasselhoff and his partners acquired the rights to the show and, based on Hasselhoff's popularity overseas, they were able to secure financing and revive \"Baywatch\" in 1991. Now a piece of American pop culture and an international television phenomenon, Baywatch - Die Rettungsschwimmer von Malibu (1989) was at its peak seen in 140 countries by over one billion viewers each week. During his lengthy career, Hasselhoff has flexed his acting muscles in numerous other projects. He starred in the epic miniseries Shaka Zulu (1986), shot on-location in Morocco.\n\nHasselhoff is an outdoor sports enthusiast whose interests include scuba diving, hiking, white water rafting, tennis, and jogging. In addition, he has parachuted with the US Army Parachute Demonstration Team, The Golden Knights, and flown with the US Navy's Blue Angels. He is an avid sports fan, and has attended the World Cup Soccer Finals, the NBA Finals, the Olympics, the Indy 500, and the Kentucky Derby. Hasselhoff has traveled throughout Australia, Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Caribbean. He spends many hours visiting children's hospitals throughout the world. His charity, \"Race For Life\", works with the terminally ill and handicapped children in America.\n\nHe was married to the beautiful actress Pamela Bach-Hasselhoff, with whom he has two daughters, Taylor-Ann and Hayley Amber."
