        "text": "In Mein Kampf (1924), Hitler had suggested a three-fold division of races, using the Japanese as the sole example of “culture-baring” and thus intermediate races. Therefore, in 1933, when Hitler became chancellor, the Japanese found themselves sandwiched between the allegedly “culture-creating” Aryans and the Jews, which – according to Hitler – were “culture-destroying”. The Nuremberg Race Laws of 1935 changed the above-mentioned three-fold scheme into a binary system, singling out the Jews as the only subordinate race, making most others “honorary Aryans”. Despite this and the official Axis policy, Japanese-German couples along with their children continued to experience distress. Following a short introduction to the Japanese’ position within the Nazi race system and the discussion about Nazi admiration of Japanese “racial purity”, this paper is going to take a look at some of the problems Japanese-German couples faced during the Nazi years. Finally, some concrete examples of the difficulties these couples encountered in Japan will be presented. The local Nazi Party machine excluded Jews as well as Germans married to Japanese from the German community called “Deutsche Gemeinde”. Anyone expressing the intention to marry a Japanese national was pressured to give up on this plan. The Nazis went as far as threatening to induce young Germans into Wehrmacht or Kriegsmarine to render planned weddings impossible. The majority of examples presented here are taken from the files of the Nazi embassy in Tokyo, found in the political archive of the German foreign office in Berlin.\n\nThe academic study of kabbalah is a new field, growing by leaps and bounds. Because kabbalah has literary, historical, ritual, cognitive, and experiential dimensions, it crosses many disciplinary and methodological lines. The discipline must therefore graduate from its initial focus on the textual. The roundtable aims re-examine methodologies for its study. We will ask four key questions: First, How do we define the disciplinary domain of kabbalah? Second, What are the most pressing questions in the study of kabbalah? Third, have we adopted new theories or methodologies in recent years? If so why? Fourth, What are the advantages and disadvantages of your theoretical and methodological approach to the study of kabbalah? Fifth, what comes next? To reach this goal the panel will be comprised of scholars representing different approaches. Hartley Lachter will discuss kabbalistic texts whose provenance is already established. He asserts the importance of social context to their meaning. Ronit Meroz, on the other hand, emphasizes the value of literary analysis not only for its intrinsic value but also as a means for deciphering the archeology of the text and its different historical strata. Vadim Putzu will draw from the burgeoning developments in the scientific study of the human mind, brain, and psyche, to discuss how the findings and methodologies of neurocognitive and psychiatric research may contribute to a better understanding of Jewish mystical practices and experiences to place its study within broader scholarly conversations in the fields of comparative religion, Religious Studies, and beyond. Pinchas Giller will explore the role of technology in the current practice and study of kabbalah, which opens new possibilities for both scholars and practitioners. Marla Segol will discuss the importance of new approaches to understanding gender, embodiment and sexuality beyond French feminism, grounded in the mythology and the scientific lore of the period, and understood through the various lenses of queer theory. Moderator Ginsburg, given his research using many of these methodologies, will aim to focus the discussion on how the above issues impact specifically on the contemporary study of kabbalah, and how they should shape it in the future."
