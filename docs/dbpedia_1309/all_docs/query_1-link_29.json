I hereby appoint the Honorable Virginia Foxx to act as Speaker pro tempore on this day. John A. Boehner, Speaker of the House of Representatives. ____________________ PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: Eternal God, we give You thanks for giving us another day. Send Your spirit upon the Members of this people's House to encourage them in their official tasks. As the Members approach the votes they are making today, may they be imbued with courage and leadership that looks to the health and vibrancy of our great Nation. Assure them that in the fulfillment of their responsibilities, You provide the grace to enable them to be faithful to their duties and the wisdom to be conscious of their obligations and fulfill them with integrity. As the Congress looks to the upcoming holy celebrations of millions of Americans, may they, and may we all, be mindful of God's love for us. May we be faithful stewards, not only of Your creation, but also Your desire that all people would be free from whatever inhibits them to be fully alive. May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. ____________________ THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day's proceedings and announces to the House her approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the Speaker's approval of the Journal. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8, rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. ____________________ PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Kilmer) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. KILMER led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. ____________________ ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will entertain up to 5 requests for 1-minute speeches on each side of the aisle. ____________________ THE BATTLING BOYS OF BENGHAZI (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I want to share with the American people a poem a written by a Marine Corps officer. It is about two former Navy SEALs: Ben Doherty and Ty Woods. They were killed in Benghazi. It is called ``The Battling Boys of Benghazi'': We're the battling boys of Benghazi! No fame, no glory, no paparazzi. Just a fiery death in a blazing hell, defending our country we loved so well. It wasn't our job, but we answered the call, fought to the Consulate and scaled the wall. We pulled 20 countrymen from the jaws of fate. Led them to safety, and stood at the gate. Just the two of us, and foes by the score, but we stood fast to bar the door. Three calls for reinforcement, but all were denied, So we fought, and we fought, and we fought `til we died. We gave our all for our Uncle Sam, but our leaders didn't give a damn. Just two dead SEALs, who carried the load, no thanks to us, we were just ``Bumps in the Road.'' These two Navy SEALs did their jobs. Let's do our jobs and bring those thugs who killed them to justice ____________________ EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK (Mr. KILMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of a very simple principle: equal pay for equal work. It turns out I am not the only one in my household who supports equal pay. One morning last month, on my way out the door, my 8-year-old, Sophie, asked me my plans for the day. I said I was having an event called ``When Women Succeed, America Succeeds'' focused on economic opportunity for women, including good jobs and good pay. She said, Dad, that's my agenda. I said, You have an agenda? She said, Yeah. She showed me her ``Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' book. At the top of one of the pages it says, When I am elected President, the laws I pass will be--and number one, she wrote, in penmanship we are going to work on, Women should get paid the same as men. [[Page 6088]] This shouldn't be hard, Madam Speaker. My 8-year-old gets it, and the American people are waiting for Congress to get it too. So let's stand up for equal pay for equal work and bring the Paycheck Fairness Act up for a vote. ____________________ HONORING THE LIFE OF SERGEANT TIMOTHY OWENS (Mr. SMITH of Missouri asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of United States Army Sergeant Timothy Owens, who lived in Rolla, Missouri, in the Eighth Congressional District. Sergeant Owens was killed in senseless act of violence at Fort Hood, Texas, last week. Sergeant Owens deployed to Iraq with the 396th Transportation Company. During his military service, Sergeant Owens earned numerous awards, including the Army Commendation Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, Overseas Service Ribbon, and four Certificates of Achievement. Additionally, Sergeant Owens served as a counselor to his fellow soldiers at Fort Hood. In addition to his service to our Nation, Sergeant Owens was a devoted husband and a loving father of three. He will be greatly missed by his wife, Billy, his children, and his numerous family and friends. Madam Speaker, we honor the service and life of Sergeant Timothy Owens, and we lift his family in prayers. ____________________ CLIMATE CHANGE (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LOWENTHAL. Madam Speaker, last week in the Natural Resources Committee one of my esteemed colleagues from across the aisle claimed that the scientific evidence regarding human contributions to climate change was inconclusive. Well, Stanford researcher, Dr. James Powell, a geochemist, and a 12- year member of the non-partisan National Science Board, recently completed an update to his survey of peer-reviewed literature on climate change. As it points out, in the year 2013, there were 10,885 peer-reviewed articles and only two rejected human contributions towards climate change. That is less than two hundredths of 1 percent. Madam Speaker, this is not disagreement. This is not a divided scientific community, case closed. Congress must stop denying the science and take action. Future generations are depending upon us. ____________________ EASTER IN IRAN (Mr. HOLDING asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HOLDING. Madam Speaker, Good Friday and Easter are right around the corner. For some Christians in the Middle East, specifically in Iran and Egypt, these holidays can only be observed and celebrated in fear. Madam Speaker, Christians continue to be persecuted for their religious beliefs across the globe by intolerant, oppressive regimes and governments that seek to impose strict religious rule. Many of these Christians, if they aren't killed, tortured to death, or imprisoned, must flee for their lives from places that they and their ancestors called home, for the simple and single reason that they are Christians. Madam Speaker, as we celebrate Easter this year, let us not forget the plight and daily struggle of those who can't freely practice the religion of their own choosing. More importantly, Madam Speaker, let us continue to hold those regimes and governments accountable for their systematic targeting and continued oppression of Christians. ____________________ BUREAU OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION SMALL BUSINESS ADVISORY BOARD ACT (Mr. HECK of Washington asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HECK of Washington. Madam Speaker, I rise today in steadfast support of small business and H.R. 4383, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection Small Business Advisory Board Act. Within the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau consumers have a voice. Credit unions have a voice. Community banks have a voice. And appropriately, men and women in uniform have a voice through the Office of Servicemember Affairs. These are all important contributors to include. Yet, one group was left out, and that group was America's small businesses. While identified as ``small,'' they are mighty when it comes to our local economy and job creation. As a small business owner, I know they have insight to offer during the development of new rules and regulations. Under the leadership of the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger), I have cosponsored this critical improvement to the CFPB. I ask that our colleagues now join us in this bipartisan effort to allow small businesses in the financial sector to be heard. ____________________ MEDICAL EVALUATION PARITY FOR SERVICEMEMBERS (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, yesterday afternoon U.S. Senators Rob Portman and Jay Rockefeller introduced the Medical Evaluation Parity for Servicemembers, or MEPS, Act, companion legislation to the bill that I introduced with the Congressman from Ohio, Mr. Tim Ryan, on March 27 of this year. Most are aware that incoming soldiers must pass a physical and medical evaluation, which is the case, but so many are shocked that there is no similar evaluation for mental health competency. Madam Speaker, according to recent studies, nearly half of all soldiers who tried suicide first attempted it before enlisting. A large number of suicides in the military were individuals who had never been deployed in a combat role. These studies give us insight into the mental well-being of our military, but what they also show is that we must know more. The bipartisan MEPS Act would require a preliminary mental health assessment for military recruits prior to joining the service, which will dramatically improve the way the military identifies and assesses mental health issues. The bill has no budget impact and has support from a large number of veterans groups. I thank my Senate colleagues for introducing this bill and encourage my colleagues in the House to join the support. ____________________ RECOGNIZING THE 45TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MINORITY BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AGENCY (Mr. GARCIA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GARCIA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the 45th anniversary of the Minority Business Development Agency. Throughout its history, MBDA has spurred business development and worked tirelessly to advance the growth and global competitiveness of the minority business community. These businesses fuel the economic engine of our country, revitalizing our communities by creating hundreds of new jobs. In my home State of Florida, this agency helped create 2,500 jobs in 2009, including over 800 new jobs in the past year alone. At a time when many communities blighted by recession continue to struggle, the Minority Development Business Agency will strengthen businesses on the verge of recovery. I look forward to seeing this agency continue to create jobs and prosperity both in Florida and across our country. [[Page 6089]] ____________________ {time} 0915 KELSEY HIRSCH (Mr. WOODALL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, we all know that April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month, but what you all may not know is about the amazing accomplishments of a young freshman at South Forsyth High School down in my district. Her name is Kelsey Hirsch. Having been affected by all of the events that she saw in the media around our part of the world, she founded a group in my neighborhood. It is called Bands4RAINN. RAINN is the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network, and she came up with the idea of selling wristbands to raise money for that network. She set a goal for herself of raising $600. She ended up raising more than $10,000. She ended up winning the HOPE Award for RAINN. She ended up founding a group at her high school called WarEagles4RAINN, and this weekend, she is holding a Concert4Courage and Hoops4Hope, which are two more fundraising events, to draw attention to sexual assault and violence, particularly among young people. Mr. Speaker, one person can make a difference, and in my district, it is Kelsey Hirsch, a freshman at South Forsyth High School. ____________________ LOUIS ZAPATA (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about a giant whom we lost in the Fort Worth community--Louis Zapata, the first Hispanic ever elected to the Fort Worth City Council. Mr. Zapata held the post for 14 years. He was one of the longest- serving city council members in the city's history. Mr. Zapata was so proud of the city's north side, which he represented well. He did so many wonderful things for the community, like advancing the arts and protecting the Rose Marine Theater. Mr. Zapata was also someone who was interested in raising the quality of life for all of our city's citizens. In addition to his duties on the Fort Worth City Council, he was also a union member and a union representative at Bell Helicopter, one of the city's largest employers, where he worked tirelessly to make sure that every man and woman who worked at the plant enjoyed a better quality of life. I want to thank Mr. Zapata for everything that he did to help make our city better and to help make our community better. He will be missed. He is one of the legends of the Fort Worth City Council, and he is someone who will always be remembered fondly in our city. ____________________ CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015 General Leave Mr. WOODALL.

LIMITATION ON ADVANCE APPROPRIATIONS. (a) In General.--In the House, except as provided for in subsection (b), any bill or joint resolution, or amendment thereto or conference report thereon, making a general appropriation or continuing appropriation may not provide for advance appropriations. (b) Exceptions.--An advance appropriation may be provided for programs, projects, activities, or accounts referred to in subsection (c)(1) or identified in the report to accompany this concurrent resolution or the joint explanatory statement of managers to accompany this concurrent resolution under the heading ``Accounts Identified for Advance Appropriations''. (c) Limitations.--For fiscal year 2016, the aggregate level of advance appropriations shall not exceed-- (1) $58,662,202,000 for the following programs in the Department of Veterans Affairs-- (A) Medical Services; (B) Medical Support and Compliance; and (C) Medical Facilities accounts of the Veterans Health Administration; and (2) $28,781,000,000 in new budget authority for all programs identified pursuant to subsection (b). (d) Definition.--In this section, the term ``advance appropriation'' means any new discretionary budget authority provided in a bill or joint resolution, or amendment thereto or conference report thereon, making general appropriations or any new discretionary budget authority provided in a bill or joint resolution making continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2016. SEC. 202. CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS. Upon the enactment of any bill or joint resolution providing for a change in budgetary concepts or definitions, the chair of the Committee on the Budget may adjust any allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this concurrent resolution accordingly. SEC. 203. ADJUSTMENTS OF AGGREGATES, ALLOCATIONS, AND APPROPRIATE BUDGETARY LEVELS. (a) Adjustments of Discretionary and Direct Spending Levels.--If a committee (other than the Committee on Appropriations) reports a bill or joint resolution, or amendment thereto or conference report thereon, providing for a decrease in direct spending (budget authority and outlays flowing therefrom) for any fiscal year and also provides for an authorization of appropriations for the same purpose, upon the enactment of such measure, the chair of the Committee on the Budget may decrease the allocation to such committee and increase the allocation of discretionary spending (budget authority and outlays flowing therefrom) to the Committee on Appropriations for fiscal year 2015 by an amount equal to the new budget authority (and outlays flowing therefrom) provided for in a bill or joint resolution making appropriations for the same purpose. (b) Adjustments to Fund Overseas Contingency Operations/ Global War on Terrorism.--In order to take into account any new information included in the budget submission by the President for fiscal year 2015, the chair of the Committee on the Budget may adjust the allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate budgetary levels for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism or the section 302(a) allocation to the Committee on Appropriations set forth in the report of this concurrent resolution to conform with section 251(c) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (as adjusted by section 251A of such Act). (c) Revised Congressional Budget Office Baseline.--The chair of the Committee on the Budget may adjust the allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate budgetary levels to reflect changes resulting from technical and economic assumptions in the most recent baseline published by the Congressional Budget Office. (d) Determinations.--For the purpose of enforcing this concurrent resolution on the [[Page 6095]] budget in the House, the allocations and aggregate levels of new budget authority, outlays, direct spending, new entitlement authority, revenues, deficits, and surpluses for fiscal year 2015 and the period of fiscal years 2015 through fiscal year 2024 shall be determined on the basis of estimates made by the chair of the Committee on the Budget and such chair may adjust such applicable levels of this concurrent resolution. SEC. 204. LIMITATION ON LONG-TERM SPENDING. (a) In General.--In the House, it shall not be in order to consider a bill or joint resolution reported by a committee (other than the Committee on Appropriations), or an amendment thereto or a conference report thereon, if the provisions of such measure have the net effect of increasing direct spending in excess of $5,000,000,000 for any period described in subsection (b). (b) Time Periods.--The applicable periods for purposes of this section are any of the four consecutive ten fiscal-year periods beginning with fiscal year 2025. SEC. 205. BUDGETARY TREATMENT OF CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS. (a) In General.--Notwithstanding section 302(a)(1) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, section 13301 of the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, and section 4001 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, the report accompanying this concurrent resolution on the budget or the joint explanatory statement accompanying the conference report on any concurrent resolution on the budget shall include in its allocation under section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to the Committee on Appropriations amounts for the discretionary administrative expenses of the Social Security Administration and the United States Postal Service.

(c) Adjustments.--The chair of the Committee on the Budget may adjust the allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate levels for legislation reported by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform that reforms the Federal retirement system, if such adjustments do not cause a net increase in the deficit for fiscal year 2015 and the period of fiscal years 2015 through 2024. SEC. 206. APPLICATION AND EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ALLOCATIONS AND AGGREGATES. (a) Application.--Any adjustments of the allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate levels made pursuant to this concurrent resolution shall-- (1) apply while that measure is under consideration; (2) take effect upon the enactment of that measure; and (3) be published in the Congressional Record as soon as practicable. (b) Effect of Changed Allocations and Aggregates.--Revised allocations and aggregates resulting from these adjustments shall be considered for the purposes of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 as allocations and aggregates included in this concurrent resolution. (c) Budget Compliance.--The consideration of any bill or joint resolution, or amendment thereto or conference report thereon, for which the chair of the Committee on the Budget makes adjustments or revisions in the allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate levels of this concurrent resolution shall not be subject to the points of order set forth in clause 10 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives or section 504. SEC. 207. CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE ESTIMATES. (a) Findings.--The House finds the following: (1) Costs of Federal housing loans and loan guarantees are treated unequally in the budget. The Congressional Budget Office uses fair-value accounting to measure the costs of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but determines the cost of other Federal loan and loan-guarantee programs on the basis of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (``FCRA''). (2) The fair-value accounting method uses discount rates which incorporate the risk inherent to the type of liability being estimated in addition to Treasury discount rates of the proper maturity length. In contrast, FCRA accounting solely uses the discount rates of the Treasury, failing to incorporate all of the risks attendant to these credit activities. (3) The Congressional Budget Office estimates that if fair- value were used to estimate the cost of all new credit activity in 2014, the deficit would be approximately $50 billion higher than under the current methodology. (b) Fair Value Estimates.--Upon the request of the chair or ranking member of the Committee on the Budget, any estimate prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office for a measure under the terms of title V of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, ``credit reform'', as a supplement to such estimate shall, to the extent practicable, also provide an estimate of the current actual or estimated market values representing the ``fair value'' of assets and liabilities affected by such measure. (c) Fair Value Estimates for Housing Programs.--Whenever the Director of the Congressional Budget Office prepares an estimate pursuant to section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 of the costs which would be incurred in carrying out any bill or joint resolution and if the Director determines that such bill or joint resolution has a cost related to a housing or residential mortgage program under the FCRA, then the Director shall also provide an estimate of the current actual or estimated market values representing the ``fair value'' of assets and liabilities affected by the provisions of such bill or joint resolution that result in such cost. (d) Enforcement.--If the Director of the Congressional Budget Office provides an estimate pursuant to subsection (b) or (c), the chair of the Committee on the Budget may use such estimate to determine compliance with the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and other budgetary enforcement controls. SEC. 208. TRANSFERS FROM THE GENERAL FUND OF THE TREASURY TO THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND THAT INCREASE PUBLIC INDEBTEDNESS. For purposes of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, or the rules or orders of the House of Representatives, a bill or joint resolution, or an amendment thereto or conference report thereon, that transfers funds from the general fund of the Treasury to the Highway Trust Fund shall be counted as new budget authority and outlays equal to the amount of the transfer in the fiscal year the transfer occurs. SEC. 209. SEPARATE ALLOCATION FOR OVERSEAS CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS/GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM. (a) Allocation.--In the House, there shall be a separate allocation to the Committee on Appropriations for overseas contingency operations/global war on terrorism. For purposes of enforcing such separate allocation under section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the ``first fiscal year'' and the ``total of fiscal years'' shall be deemed to refer to fiscal year 2015. Such separate allocation shall be the exclusive allocation for overseas contingency operations/ global war on terrorism under section 302(a) of such Act. Section 302(c) of such Act shall not apply to such separate allocation. The Committee on Appropriations may provide suballocations of such separate allocation under section 302(b) of such Act. Spending that counts toward the allocation established by this section shall be designated pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. (b) Adjustment.--In the House, for purposes of subsection (a) for fiscal year 2015, no adjustment shall be made under section 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 if any adjustment would be made under section 251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. SEC. 210. EXERCISE OF RULEMAKING POWERS. The House adopts the provisions of this title-- (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the House of Representatives and as such they shall be considered as part of the rules of the House of Representatives, and these rules shall supersede other rules only to the extent that they are inconsistent with other such rules; and (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of the House of Representatives to change those rules at any time, in the same manner, and to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of the House of Representatives. TITLE III--POLICY SEC. 301. POLICY STATEMENT ON HEALTH CARE LAW REPEAL. It is the policy of this resolution that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148), and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-152) should be repealed. SEC. 302. POLICY STATEMENT ON MEANS-TESTED WELFARE PROGRAMS. (a) Findings.--The House finds that: (1) Too many people are trapped at the bottom rungs of the economic ladder, and every citizen should have the opportunity to rise, escape from poverty, and achieve their own potential. (2) In 1996, President Bill Clinton and congressional Republicans enacted reforms that have moved families off of Federal programs and enabled them to provide for themselves. (3) According to the most recent projections, over the next 10 years we will spend approximately $9.7 trillion on means- tested welfare programs. (4) Today, there are approximately 92 Federal programs that provide benefits specifically to poor and low-income Americans. (5) Taxpayers deserve clear and transparent information on how well these programs are working, and how much the Federal Government is spending on means-tested welfare. (6) It should be the goal of welfare programs to encourage work and put people on a path to self-reliance. [[Page 6096]] (b) Policy on Means-tested Welfare Programs.--It is the policy of this resolution that-- (1) the welfare system should be reformed to give states flexibility to implement and improve safety net programs and that to be eligible for benefits, able bodied adults without dependents should be required to work or be preparing for work, including enrolling in educational or job training programs, contributing community service, or participating in a supervised job search; and (2) the President's budget should disclose, in a clear and transparent manner, the aggregate amount of Federal welfare expenditures, as well as an estimate of State and local spending for this purpose, over the next ten years. SEC. 303. POLICY STATEMENT ON BLOCK GRANTING MEDICAID. It is the policy of this resolution that Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) should be block granted to the States in a manner prescribed by the State Health Flexibility Act of 2013 (H.R. 567, 113th Congress). SEC. 304. POLICY STATEMENT ON A CARBON TAX. It is the policy of this resolution that a carbon tax would be detrimental to American families and businesses, and is not in the best interest of the United States. SEC. 305. POLICY STATEMENT ON THE USE OF OFFICIAL TIME BY FEDERAL EMPLOYEES FOR UNION ACTIVITIES. It is the policy of this resolution that, as called for in H.R. 107, the Federal Employee Accountability Act of 2013, Federal employees shall not use official time to conduct union activities. SEC. 306. POLICY STATEMENT ON CREATION OF A COMMITTEE TO ELIMINATE DUPLICATION AND WASTE. It is the policy of this resolution that a new committee, styled after the post-World War II ``Byrd Committee'' shall be created to act on GAO's annual waste and duplication reports as well as Oversight and Government Reform Inspector General reports. SEC. 307. POLICY STATEMENT ON FEDERAL FUNDING OF ABORTION. It is the policy of this resolution that no taxpayer dollars shall go to any entity that provides abortion services. SEC. 308. POLICY STATEMENT ON READABLE LEGISLATION. It is the policy of this resolution that bills should be made more readable and for Members of Congress and more accessible to the public as called for in H.R. 760, the Readable Legislation Act of 2013. SEC. 309. POLICY STATEMENT ON WORK REQUIREMENTS. It is the policy of this resolution that the work requirements in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grant program should be preserved as called for in H.R. 890, 113th Congress. SEC. 310. POLICY STATEMENT ON ENERGY PRODUCTION. It is the policy of this resolution that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) and currently unavailable areas of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) should be open for energy exploration and production. To ensure States' rights, states are given the option to withdrawal from leasing within certain areas of the OCS. Specifically, a State, through enactment of a State statute, may withdrawal from leasing from all or part of any area within 75 miles of that State's coast. SEC. 311. POLICY STATEMENT ON REGULATION OF GREENHOUSE GASES BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY. It is the policy of this resolution that the Environmental Protection Agency should be prohibited from promulgating any regulation concerning, taking action relating to, or taking into consideration the emission of a greenhouse gas to address climate change. SEC. 312. POLICY STATEMENT ON REFORMING THE FEDERAL BUDGET PROCESS. It is the policy of this resolution that the Federal budget process should be reformed to promote accountability, increase transparency, and make it easier to reduce spending. SEC. 313. POLICY STATEMENT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH AND PUTTING AMERICANS BACK TO WORK. (a) Findings.--The House finds the following: (1) Although the United States economy technically emerged from recession nearly five years ago, the subsequent recovery has felt more like a malaise than a rebound. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth over the past four years has averaged just over 2 percent, well below the 3 percent trend rate of growth in the United States. (2) The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) did a study in late 2012 examining why the United States economy was growing so slowly after the recession. They found, among other things, that United States economic output was growing at less than half of the typical rate exhibited during other recoveries since World War II. CBO said that about two-thirds of this ``growth gap'' was due to a pronounced sluggishness in the growth of potential GDP--particularly in potential employment levels (such as people leaving the labor force) and the growth in productivity (which is in turn related to lower capital investment). (3) The prolonged economic sluggishness is particularly troubling given the amount of fiscal and monetary policy actions taken in recent years to cushion the depth of the downturn and to spark higher rates of growth and employment. In addition to the large stimulus package passed in early 2009, many other initiatives have been taken to boost growth, such as the new homebuyer tax credit and the ``cash for clunkers'' program. These stimulus efforts may have led to various short term ``pops'' in activity but the economy and job market has since reverted back to a sub-par trend. (4) The unemployment rate has declined in recent years, from a peak of nearly 10 percent in 2009-2010 to 6.7 percent in the latest month. However, a significant chunk of this decline has been due to people leaving the labor force (and therefore no longer being counted as ``unemployed'') and not from a surge in employment. The slow decline in the unemployment rate in recent years has occurred alongside a steep decline in the economy's labor force participation rate. The participation rate stands at 63.2 percent, close to the lowest level since 1978. The flipside of this is that over 90 million Americans are now ``on the sidelines'' and not in the labor force, representing a 10 million increase since early 2009. (5) Real median household income declined for the fifth consecutive year in 2012 (latest data available) and, at just over $51,000, is currently at its lowest level since 1995. Weak wage and income growth as a result of a subpar labor market not only means lower tax revenue coming in to the Treasury, it also means higher government spending on income support programs. (6) A stronger economy is vital to lowering deficit levels and eventually balancing the budget. According to CBO, if annual real GDP growth is just 0.1 percentage point higher over the budget window, deficits would be reduced by $311 billion. (7) This budget resolution therefore embraces pro-growth policies, such as fundamental tax reform, that will help foster a stronger economy and more job creation. (8) Reining in government spending and lowering budget deficits has a positive long-term impact on the economy and the budget. According to CBO, a significant deficit reduction package (i.e. $4 trillion), would boost longer-term economic output by 1.7 percent. Their analysis concludes that deficit reduction creates long-term economic benefits because it increases the pool of national savings and boosts investment, thereby raising economic growth and job creation. (9) The greater economic output that stems from a large deficit reduction package would have a sizeable impact on the Federal budget. For instance, higher output would lead to greater revenues through the increase in taxable incomes. Lower interest rates, and a reduction in the stock of debt, would lead to lower government spending on net interest expenses. (b) Policy on Economic Growth and Job Creation.-- (1) In general.--It is the policy of this resolution to promote faster economic growth and job creation. By putting the budget on a sustainable path, this resolution ends the debt-fueled uncertainty holding back job creators. Reforms to the tax code to put American businesses and workers in a better position to compete and thrive in the 21st century global economy. This resolution targets the regulatory red tape and cronyism that stack the deck in favor of special interests. All of the reforms in this resolution serve as means to the larger end of growing the economy and expanding opportunity for all Americans. (2) JOBS act.--It is the policy of this resolution that to create jobs, opportunity, and economic growth, H.R. 4304, the Jumpstarting Opportunities with Bold Solutions (JOBS) Act, should be enacted. This legislation, introduced by the Republican Study Committee, would unleash North American energy production, reform labor laws, reduce the regulatory burden, and increase access to capital. SEC. 314. POLICY STATEMENT ON TAX REFORM. (a) Findings.--The House finds the following: (1) A world-class tax system should be simple, fair, and promote (rather than impede) economic growth. The United States tax code fails on all three counts-it is notoriously complex, patently unfair, and highly inefficient. The tax code's complexity distorts decisions to work, save, and invest, which leads to slower economic growth, lower wages, and less job creation. (2) Over the past decade alone, there have been more than 4,400 changes to the tax code, more than one per day. Many of the major changes over the years have involved carving out special preferences, exclusions, or deductions for various activities or groups. These loopholes add up to more than $1 trillion per year and make the code unfair, inefficient, and highly complex. (3) The large amount of tax preferences that pervade the code end up narrowing the tax base. A narrow tax base, in turn, requires much higher tax rates to raise a given amount of revenue. (4) It is estimated that American taxpayers end up spending $160 billion and roughly 6 [[Page 6097]] billion hours a year complying with the tax code-a waste of time and resources that could be used in more productive activities. (5) Standard economic theory shows that high marginal tax rates dampen the incentives to work, save, and invest, which reduces economic output and job creation. Lower economic output, in turn, mutes the intended revenue gain from higher marginal tax rates. (6) Roughly half of United States active business income and half of private sector employment are derived from business entities (such as partnerships, S corporations, and sole proprietorships) that are taxed on a ``pass-through'' basis, meaning the income flows through to the tax returns of the individual owners and is taxed at the individual rate structure rather than at the corporate rate. Small businesses, in particular, tend to choose this form for Federal tax purposes, and the top Federal rate on such small business income reaches 44.6 percent. For these reasons, sound economic policy requires lowering marginal rates on these pass-through entities. (7) The United States corporate income tax rate (including Federal, State, and local taxes) sums to just over 39 percent, the highest rate in the industrialized world. Tax rates this high suppress wages and discourage investment and job creation, distort business activity, and put American businesses at a competitive disadvantage with foreign competitors. (8) By deterring potential investment, the United States corporate tax restrains economic growth and job creation. The United States tax rate differential with other countries also fosters a variety of complicated multinational corporate behaviors intended to avoid the tax, which have the effect of moving the tax base offshore, destroying American jobs, and decreasing corporate revenue. (9) The ``worldwide'' structure of United States international taxation essentially taxes earnings of United States firms twice, putting them at a significant competitive disadvantage with competitors with more competitive international tax systems. (10) Reforming the United States tax code to a more competitive international system would boost the competitiveness of United States companies operating abroad and it would also greatly reduce tax avoidance. (11) The tax code imposes costs on American workers through lower wages, on consumers in higher prices, and on investors in diminished returns. (12) Revenues have averaged about 17.5 percent of the economy throughout modern American history. Revenues rise above this level under current law to 18.4 percent of the economy by the end of the 10-year budget window. (13) Attempting to raise revenue through tax increases to meet out-of-control spending would damage the economy. (14) This resolution also rejects the idea of instituting a carbon tax in the United States, which some have offered as a ``new'' source of revenue. Such a plan would damage the economy, cost jobs, and raise prices on American consumers. (15) Closing tax loopholes to fund spending does not constitute fundamental tax reform. (16) The goal of tax reform should be to curb or eliminate loopholes and use those savings to lower tax rates across the board--not to fund more wasteful Government spending. Tax reform should be revenue-neutral and should not be an excuse to raise taxes on the American people. Washington has a spending problem, not a revenue problem. (b) Policy on Tax Reform.--It is the policy of this resolution that Congress should enact legislation that provides for a comprehensive reform of the United States tax code to promote economic growth, create American jobs, increase wages, and benefit American consumers, investors, and workers through revenue-neutral fundamental tax reform that provides for the following: (1) Aims for revenue neutrality (relative to the CBO baseline revenue projection) based on a dynamic score that takes into account macroeconomic effects. (2) Simplifies the individual rates from seven brackets to two, with a top rate of 25 percent. (3) Simplifies the tax code by ensuring that fewer Americans will be required to itemize their deductions. (4) Gives equal tax treatment to individual and employer health care expenditures modeled on the American Health Care Reform Act (H.R. 3121). (5) Eliminates the current Earned Income Tax Credit that is given in a yearly lump-sum payment and replaces it with a program that would allow workers to exempt a portion of their payroll taxes every month. (6) Repeals the death tax or inheritance tax. (7) Reduces the rate of double taxation by lowering the top corporate rate to 25 percent and setting a maximum long-term capital gains tax rate at 15 percent. (8) Sets a maximum dividend tax rate at 15 percent. (9) Encourages (on net) investment and entrepreneurial activity. (10) Moves to a competitive international system of taxation. SEC. 315. POLICY STATEMENT ON REPLACING THE PRESIDENT'S HEALTH CARE LAW. (a) Findings.--The House finds the following: (1) The President's health care law has failed to reduce health care premiums as promised. Health care premiums were supposed to decline by $2,500. Instead, according to the 2013 Employer Health Benefits Survey, health care premiums have increased by 5 percent for individual plans and 4 percent for family since 2012. Moreover, according to a report from the Energy and Commerce Committee, premiums for individual market plans may go up as much as 50 percent because of the law. (2) The President pledged that Americans would be able to keep their health care plan if they liked it. But the non- partisan Congressional Budget Office now estimates 2 million Americans with employment-based health coverage will lose those plans. (3) Then-Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, said that the President's health care law would create 4 million jobs over the life of the law and almost 400,000 jobs immediately. Instead, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the law will reduce full-time equivalent employment by about 2.0 million hours in 2017 and 2.5 million hours in 2024, ``compared with what would have occurred in the absence of the ACA.''. (4) The implementation of the law has been a failure. The main website that Americans were supposed to use in purchasing new coverage was broken for over a month. Since the President's health care law was signed into law, the Administration has announced 23 delays. The President has also failed to submit any nominees to sit on the Independent Payment Advisory Board, a panel of bureaucrats that will cut Medicare by an additional $12.1 billion over the next ten years, according to the President's own budget. (5) The President's health care law should be repealed and replaced with reforms that make affordable and quality health care coverage available to all Americans. (b) Policy on Replacing the President's Health Care Law.-- It is the policy of this resolution that the President's health care law must not only be repealed, but also replaced by enacting H.R. 3121, the American Health Care Reform Act. SEC. 316. POLICY STATEMENT ON MEDICARE. (a) Findings.--The House finds the following: (1) More than 50 million Americans depend on Medicare for their health security. (2) The Medicare Trustees Report has repeatedly recommended that Medicare's long-term financial challenges be addressed soon. Each year without reform, the financial condition of Medicare becomes more precarious and the threat to those in or near retirement becomes more pronounced. According to the Congressional Budget Office-- (A) the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be exhausted in 2026 and unable to pay scheduled benefits; and (B) Medicare spending is growing faster than the economy and Medicare outlays are currently rising at a rate of 6 percent per year over the next ten years, and according to the Congressional Budget Office's 2013 Long-Term Budget Outlook, spending on Medicare is projected to reach 5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2040 and 9.4 percent of GDP by 2088. (3) The President's health care law created a new Federal agency called the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) empowered with unilateral authority to cut Medicare spending. As a result of that law-- (A) IPAB will be tasked with keeping the Medicare per capita growth below a Medicare per capita target growth rate. Prior to 2018, the target growth rate is based on the five- year average of overall inflation and medical inflation. Beginning in 2018, the target growth rate will be the five- year average increase in the nominal GDP plus one percentage point, which the President has twice proposed to reduce to GDP plus one-half percentage point; (B) the fifteen unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats of IPAB will make decisions that will reduce seniors access to care; (C) the nonpartisan Office of the Medicare Chief Actuary estimates that the provider cuts already contained in the Affordable Care Act will force 15 percent of hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and home health agencies to become unprofitable in 2019; and (D) additional cuts from the IPAB board will force even more health care providers to close their doors, and the Board should be repealed. (4) Failing to address this problem will leave millions of American seniors without adequate health security and younger generations burdened with enormous debt to pay for spending levels that cannot be sustained. (b) Policy on Medicare Reform.--It is the policy of this resolution to protect those in or near retirement from any disruptions to their Medicare benefits and offer future beneficiaries the same health care options available to Members of Congress. (c) Assumptions.--This resolution assumes reform of the Medicare program such that: (1) Current Medicare benefits are preserved for those in or near retirement. (2) For future generations, when they reach eligibility, Medicare is reformed to [[Page 6098]] provide a premium support payment and a selection of guaranteed health coverage options from which recipients can choose a plan that best suits their needs. (3) Medicare will maintain traditional fee-for-service as an option. (4) Medicare will provide additional assistance for lower- income beneficiaries and those with greater health risks. (5) Medicare spending is put on a sustainable path and the Medicare program becomes solvent over the long-term. SEC. 317. POLICY STATEMENT ON SOCIAL SECURITY. (a) Findings.--The House finds the following: (1) More than 55 million retirees, individuals with disabilities, and survivors depend on Social Security. Since enactment, Social Security has served as a vital leg on the ``three-legged stool'' of retirement security, which includes employer provided pensions as well as personal savings. (2) The Social Security Trustees Report has repeatedly recommended that Social Security's long-term financial challenges be addressed soon. Each year without reform, the financial condition of Social Security becomes more precarious and the threat to seniors and those receiving Social Security disability benefits becomes more pronounced: (A) In 2016, the Disability Insurance Trust Fund will be exhausted and program revenues will be unable to pay scheduled benefits. (B) In 2033, the combined Old-Age and Survivors and Disability Trust Funds will be exhausted, and program revenues will be unable to pay scheduled benefits. (C) With the exhaustion of the Trust Funds in 2033, benefits will be cut nearly 25 percent across the board, devastating those currently in or near retirement and those who rely on Social Security the most. (3) The recession and continued low economic growth have exacerbated the looming fiscal crisis facing Social Security. The most recent CBO projections find that Social Security will run cash deficits of $1.7 trillion over the next 10 years. (4) Lower-income Americans rely on Social Security for a larger proportion of their retirement income. Therefore, reforms should take into consideration the need to protect lower-income Americans' retirement security. (5) The Disability Insurance program provides an essential income safety net for those with disabilities and their families. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), between 1970 and 2012, the number of people receiving disability benefits (both disabled workers and their dependent family members) has increased by over 300 percent from 2.7 million to over 10.9 million. This increase is not due strictly to population growth or decreases in health. David Autor and Mark Duggan have found that the increase in individuals on disability does not reflect a decrease in self-reported health. CBO attributes program growth to changes in demographics, changes in the composition of the labor force and compensation, as well as Federal policies. (6) If this program is not reformed, families who rely on the lifeline that disability benefits provide will face benefit cuts of up to 25 percent in 2016, devastating individuals who need assistance the most. (7) In the past, Social Security has been reformed on a bipartisan basis, most notably by the ``Greenspan Commission'' which helped to address Social Security shortfalls for over a generation. (8) Americans deserve action by the President, the House, and the Senate to preserve and strengthen Social Security. It is critical that bipartisan action be taken to address the looming insolvency of Social Security. In this spirit, this resolution creates a bipartisan opportunity to find solutions by requiring policymakers to ensure that Social Security remains a critical part of the safety net. (b) Policy on Social Security.--It is the policy of this resolution that Congress should work on a bipartisan basis to make Social Security sustainably solvent. This resolution assumes these reforms will include the following: (1) Adoption of a more accurate measure for calculating cost of living adjustments. (2) Adoption of adjustments to the full retirement age to reflect longevity. (c) Policy on Disability Insurance.--It is the policy of this resolution that Congress and the President should enact legislation on a bipartisan basis to reform the Disability Insurance program prior to its insolvency in 2016 and should not raid the Social Security retirement system without reforms to the Disability Insurance system. This resolutions assumes that reforms to the Disability Insurance program will include-- (1) encouraging work; (2) updates of the eligibility rules; (3) reducing fraud and abuse; and (4) enactment of H.R. 1502, the Social Security Disability Insurance and Unemployment Benefits Double Dip Elimination Act, to prohibit individuals from drawing benefits from both programs at the same time. SEC. 318. POLICY STATEMENT ON HIGHER EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITY. (a) Findings on Higher Education.--The House finds the following: (1) A well-educated workforce is critical to economic, job, and wage growth. (2) 19.5 million students are enrolled in American colleges and universities. (3) Over the last decade, tuition and fees have been growing at an unsustainable rate. Between the 2002-2003 Academic Year and the 2012-2013 Academic Year-- (A) published tuition and fees for in-State students at public four-year colleges and universities increased at an average rate of 5.2 percent per year beyond the rate of general inflation; (B) published tuition and fees for in-State students at public two-year colleges and universities increased at an average rate of 3.9 percent per year beyond the rate of general inflation; and (C) published tuition and fees for in-State students at private four-year colleges and universities increased at an average rate of 2.4 percent per year beyond the rate of general inflation. (4) Over that same period, Federal financial aid has increased 105 percent. (5) This spending has failed to make college more affordable. (6) In his 2012 State of the Union Address, President Obama noted that, ``We can't just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we'll run out of money.''. (7) American students are chasing ever-increasing tuition with ever-increasing debt. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, student debt more than quadrupled between 2003 and 2013, and now stands at nearly $1.1 trillion. Student debt now has the second largest balance after mortgage debt. (8) Students are carrying large debt loads and too many fail to complete college or end up defaulting on these loans due to their debt burden and a weak economy and job market. (9) Based on estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, the Pell Grant Program will face a fiscal shortfall beginning in fiscal year 2016 and continuing in each subsequent year in the current budget window. (10) Failing to address these problems will jeopardize access and affordability to higher education for America's young people. (b) Policy on Higher Education Affordability.--It is the policy of this resolution to address the root drivers of tuition inflation, by-- (1) targeting Federal financial aid to those most in need; (2) streamlining programs that provide aid to make them more effective; (3) maintaining the maximum Pell grant award level at $5,730 in each year of the budget window; and (4) removing regulatory barriers in higher education that act to restrict flexibility and innovative teaching, particularly as it relates to non-traditional models such as online coursework and competency-based learning. (c) Findings on Workforce Development.--The House finds the following: (1) Over ten million Americans are currently unemployed. (2) Despite billions of dollars in spending, those looking for work are stymied by a broken workforce development system that fails to connect workers with assistance and employers with trained personnel. (4) According to a 2011 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, in fiscal year 2009, the Federal Government spent $18 billion across 9 agencies to administer 47 Federal job training programs, almost all of which overlapped with another program in terms of offered services and targeted population. (5) Since the release of that GAO report, the Education and Workforce Committee, which has done extensive work in this area, has identified more than 50 programs. (3) Without changes, this flawed system will continue to fail those looking for work or to improve their skills, and jeopardize economic growth. (d) Policy on Workforce Development.--It is the policy of this resolution to address the failings in the current workforce development system, by-- (1) streamlining and consolidating Federal job training programs as advanced by the House-passed Supporting Knowledge and Investing in Lifelong Skills Act (SKILLS Act); and (2) empowering states with the flexibility to tailor funding and programs to the specific needs of their workforce, including the development of career scholarships. SEC. 319. POLICY STATEMENT ON DEFICIT REDUCTION THROUGH THE CANCELLATION OF UNOBLIGATED BALANCES. (a) Findings.--The House finds the following: (1) According to the most recent estimate from the Office of Management and Budget, Federal agencies were expected to hold $739 billion in unobligated balances at the close of fiscal year 2014. (2) These funds represent direct and discretionary spending made available by Congress that remains available for expenditure beyond the fiscal year for which they are provided. (3) In some cases, agencies are granted funding and it remains available for obligation indefinitely. (4) The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 requires the Office [[Page 6099]] of Management and Budget to make funds available to agencies for obligation and prohibits the Administration from withholding or cancelling unobligated funds unless approved by an act of Congress. (5) Greater congressional oversight is required to review and identify potential savings from unneeded balances of funds. (b) Policy on Deficit Reduction Through the Cancellation of Unobligated Balances.--Congressional committees shall through their oversight activities identify and achieve savings through the cancellation or rescission of unobligated balances that neither abrogate contractual obligations of the Government nor reduce or disrupt Federal commitments under programs such as Social Security, veterans' affairs, national security, and Treasury authority to finance the national debt. (c) Deficit Reduction.--Congress, with the assistance of the Government Accountability Office, the Inspectors General, and other appropriate agencies should continue to make it a high priority to review unobligated balances and identify savings for deficit reduction. SEC. 320. POLICY STATEMENT ON RESPONSIBLE STEWARDSHIP OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS. (a) Findings.--The House finds the following: (1) The budget for the House of Representatives is $188 million less than it was when Republicans became the majority in 2011. (2) The House of Representatives has achieved significant savings by consolidating operations and renegotiating contracts. (b) Policy on Responsible Stewardship of Taxpayer Dollars.--It is the policy of this resolution that: (1) The House of Representatives must be a model for the responsible stewardship of taxpayer resources and therefore must identify any savings that can be achieved through greater productivity and efficiency gains in the operation and maintenance of House services and resources like printing, conferences, utilities, telecommunications, furniture, grounds maintenance, postage, and rent. This should include a review of policies and procedures for acquisition of goods and services to eliminate any unnecessary spending. The Committee on House Administration should review the policies pertaining to the services provided to Members and committees of the House, and should identify ways to reduce any subsidies paid for the operation of the House gym, barber shop, salon, and the House dining room. (2) No taxpayer funds may be used to purchase first class airfare or to lease corporate jets for Members of Congress. (3) Retirement benefits for Members of Congress should not include free, taxpayer-funded health care for life. SEC. 321. POLICY STATEMENT ON DEFICIT REDUCTION THROUGH THE REDUCTION OF UNNECESSARY AND WASTEFUL SPENDING. (a) Findings.--The House finds the following: (1) The Government Accountability Office (``GAO'') is required by law to identify examples of waste, duplication, and overlap in Federal programs, and has so identified dozens of such examples. (2) In testimony before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, the Comptroller General has s"
