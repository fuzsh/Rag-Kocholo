The execution team had difficulty finding a useable vein through which to administer the lethal drugs. An hour into the scheduled execution, the team secured a vein in Lockett’s groin area and began giving him a dose of midazolam, a drug previously untried in Oklahoma. Shortly thereafter, he was declared unconscious and two other drugs were administered which were known to cause excruciating pain if the recipient was conscious. Despite the earlier pronouncement, Lockett seemed to remain conscious. Witnesses saw him nod, mumble, and writhe on the gurney. He even struggled to lift his head. Eventually the Director the Oklahoma Department of Corrections halted the execution, but it was too late. A few minutes later Lockett died of a heart attack. Trying to explain what went wrong, Oklahoma officials said it appeared “that a vein [in Lockett’s body] blew up or exploded, it collapsed, and the drugs were not getting into the system like they were supposed to.” Whatever the cause, Lockett’s botched execution made headlines around the world. Suddenly, what had been a largely neglected aspect of America’s death penalty system galvanized the attention of citizens and leaders both in the United States and abroad. As a result, the fact of botched executions has now become an important part of the death penalty debate. Indeed 2014 turned out to be a very bad year for lethal injection. Three months before Lockett’s execution, in January 2014, Oklahoma\n\nPreface viii\n\nexecuted Michael Wilson, who said, after his execution began, that he felt his “whole body burning.” One week later, Ohio botched the lethal injection of Dennis McQuire. McGuire gasped for air for some twentyfive minutes after the administration of two drugs, hydromorphone and midazolam. During this time he made “horrible” snorting and choking sounds. In July, Arizona again used midazolam in the execution of Joseph Wood, which went on for an hour and forty minutes making it one of the longest executions in American history. A reporter for The Arizona Republic said that he counted 640 gasps from Wood before he finally died. Nonetheless, in June 2015, the Supreme Court upheld the use of midazolam in lethal injections, continuing the Court’s traditionally lax attitude toward methods of execution used in the United States. Despite the Court’s decision, the consensus that lethal injection is safe, reliable, and humane has fallen apart. Shortages of sodium thiopental, the first drug used in the traditional three-drug protocol, have left states scrambling to find which drug, or drug combination, would work most efficiently. Thus, as Jeffrey Stern recently reported in The Atlantic, “South Dakota and Nebraska approached Kayem Pharmaceuticals in India, which sold each state sodium thiopental before halting U.S. sales in April 2011. In Arkansas, corrections officials obtained sodium thiopental from British distributors and then shared it for free with Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Tennessee. But the states soon ran afoul of federal regulators for violating trade restrictions. . . . Georgia purchased sodium thiopental from Dream Pharma, a British distributor operating out of the back of a driving school in London.” As the difficulties in obtaining sodium thiopental mounted, some states started to use massive single doses of pentobarbital to carry out executions. Trying a different approach, Ohio turned to midazolam as part of a two-drug protocol and then used it as the first drug in a revised three-drug protocol even though midazolam is not used in standard medical procedures to render patients unconscious. Other states, Oklahoma, Arizona, and Florida, followed Ohio in using it with two other drugs, which resulted in 2014’s spate of botched executions.\n\nPreface ix\n\nBeyond these difficulties, the past two years have been an extraordinary time for America’s death penalty. The New Hampshire legislature came within one vote of abolishing its death penalty, a California federal district judge held that state’s death penalty unconstitutional, and Nebraska abolished capital punishment. A well-regarded study estimated that 340 people may have been put to death unjustly since 1973, and President Obama acknowledged: “In the application of the death penalty in this country, we have seen significant problems— racial bias, uneven application of the death penalty, you know, situations in which there were individuals on death row who later on were discovered to have been innocent because of exculpatory evidence. And all these, I think, do raise significant questions about how the death penalty is being applied.” These events indicate the turmoil that has come to surround the death penalty. The national conversation about capital punishment has taken a turn that would have been hard to foresee a decade ago. More and more Americans seem to be asking not what the death penalty does for us but rather what the death penalty is doing to us and to some of our most cherished values. Can we continue to use the death penalty and not run the risk of executing the innocent? Can we administer capital punishment in a way that insures against arbitrariness and discrimination? Is there a method of execution that is safe, reliable, and humane? These questions implicate America’s constitutional commitments to due process of law, equal protection, and the avoidance of cruel punishment. Efforts by death penalty proponents to respond to these new conditions and concerns have backfired. For example, passage of state laws mandating secrecy about drug protocols and the sources of the drugs used in lethal injection have spawned a series of lawsuits. Moreover, Ninth Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski’s statement that executions are “brutal, savage events, and nothing the state tries to do can mask that reality” was a surprisingly candid admission by an ardent defender of capital punishment, echoing as it did the things abolitionists have long said about the death penalty.\n\nPreface x\n\nAs this book notes, throughout the twentieth century botched executions played little role in the debate about whether the United States should retain or abolish capital punishment. Now that seems to be changing. Today’s botched executions seem less like inexplicable mishaps and more like the latest symptoms of a death penalty machinery in disarray. From start to finish that machinery appears to be broken. The risk of convicting and executing the innocent raises grave doubts about the reliability of the death penalty system. Beyond this risk, there is visible bias and arbitrariness in the determination of who receives a death sentence. Delays now stretch to decades in the period between sentencing and execution. Capital prosecutions no longer seem to be worth their high costs. Recent graphic reminders of our inability to get it right in the grim business of lethal injection fit into a coherent and compelling story that may be leading Americans to conclude that we should “no longer tinker with the machinery of death.” Austin Sarat\n\nContents\n\n1.

Technological Efficiency, Botched Executions, and the Legitimacy of Capital Punishment in the United States On September 28, 1900, the state of North Carolina hanged Art Kinsauls for a murder committed in Sampson County. Born in that county in 1865, Kinsauls had lived there his entire life, marrying a local girl, Posunnie Gibsy Bass, in 1896. Even though Art weighed only 110 pounds, he was said to be “tough as iron.”1 He had the unfortunate habit of getting into violent arguments and carried on a long running feud with John C. Herring, his neighbor. One night when Kinsauls was in Art Vann’s Store at Beaman’s Crossroad, an argument began and then a fight broke out. “Kinsauls reached into the meat box and got a sharp butcher knife and stabbed young Herring to such an extent that he died during the night.”2 Kinsauls was arrested a few days after Herring’s death and taken to the county jail in Clinton. With the help of a group of his friends, he soon escaped, and avoided capture for nine months. The sheriff and a posse only recaptured him after a gunfight at his farm, which left him seriously wounded. Brought to trial in October 1899, Kinsauls was found guilty of murder and was sentenced to hang. On the surface at least, there was nothing remarkable about North Carolina’s plan for the Kinsauls execution. Hanging had been the primary method of execution in the United States since the founding of the American colonies. It was an inexpensive, low-tech way of putting people to death. Hangings could be handled at the local level, and did not require elaborate execution protocols.3 Kinsauls refused to go quietly. He tried to kill himself twice, first with an overdose of sleeping pills and later by using a tin lid to cut his throat. Both attempts failed, but each resulted in a postponement of his\n\nThe Mere Extinguishment of Life? 2\n\nexecution. In the meantime, North Carolina governor Daniel Russell received many requests for a reprieve from influential Sampson County citizens, each of which the governor refused. On the day of the hanging, hundreds of people traveled from all over the county to witness it. The gallows was erected near the jail where Kinsauls had originally been held. As in all its executions, Sampson County used a stepladder as its gallows, but in this instance it failed to do its job. The drop height proved insufficient to break the condemned’s neck. With Kinsauls suspended at the end of the rope, the attending physician quickly determined that he was still alive. Compounding the problem was the fact that his neck had only partially healed from his last suicide attempt. As a result, when Kinsauls fell from the stepladder, the rope ripped open his neck wound and left him bleeding profusely. The assembled crowd of friends and neighbors nearly rioted. Undaunted by the failure of their first execution attempt and the increasingly chaotic, bloody scene, officials cut him down, forced him up the ladder again, and repeated the drop. This time the execution succeeded and Kinsauls died. His was the last public hanging in Sampson County.4 Newspapers all over the country took note of the Kinsauls execution. Headlines in the Atlanta Constitution, the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Republic (St. Louis, Missouri) announced that it had not gone as planned. For example, the Washington Post titled its article “Murderer Hanged Twice.”5 The stories, in turn, used vivid language to convey the horror of Kinsauls’s last minutes on earth. The Post described a “Ghastly Gallows Scene,”6 and the Virginian Pilot called it a thoroughly “revolting execution.” Almost a century later, in March 1997, American newspapers carried stories of another botched execution—the electrocution of Pedro Medina, a thirty-nine-year-old Cuban immigrant convicted and condemned for stabbing a Florida high school teacher to death.7 After the current was turned on, as one newspaper put it, flames “leaped from the head” of the condemned. “‘It was horrible,’ a witness was quoted as saying, ‘a solid flame covered his whole head, from one side to the other. I\n\nTechnological Efficiency, Botched Executions, and Legitimacy 3\n\nhad the impression of somebody being burned alive.’”8 Another reporter wrote, “The electrocution of Pedro Medina on Tuesday was the stuff of nightmares and horror fiction novels and films. A foot-long blue and orange flame shot from the mask covering his head for about 10 seconds, filling the execution chamber with smoke and sickening witnesses with the odor of charred human flesh.”9 Yet news reports also conveyed the “reassuring” reaction of Dr. Belle Almojera, medical director at Florida State Prison, who said that before the apparatus caught fire Medina already had “lurched up in his seat and balled up his fists—the normal reaction to high voltage. . . . ‘I saw no evidence of pain or suffering by the inmate throughout the entire process. In my professional opinion, he died a very quick, humane death.’”10 The Florida Supreme Court found that “Medina’s brain was instantly and massively depolarized within milliseconds of the initial surge of electricity. He suffered no conscious pain.”11 And others defended his botched electrocution by noting that it “was much more humane than what was done to the victim.”12 Despite these attempts to contain adverse public reaction, the Medina execution, like the Kinsauls execution before it, made headlines because it suggested that the quest for a painless, and allegedly humane, technology of death was by no means complete. Both botched executions remind us of the ferocity of the state’s sovereign power over life itself. At the same time, these news stories also offered capital punishment’s supporters a hint of relief. Most stories treated Medina’s electrocution as a mere technological glitch rather than as an occasion to rethink the practice of state killing itself. Florida’s Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel opined, for example, that the state “is justified in imposing the death penalty. . . . But it has no justification for retaining a method . . . that is so gruesome and violent and sometimes flawed.”13 What might have been a challenge to the legitimacy of the killing state was quickly written off as Florida’s failure to keep up with the technology of the times. Botched executions, like those of Kinsauls and Medina, have been, and remain, an important part of the story of capital punishment in the United States. From the beginning, American execution practices\n\nThe Mere Extinguishment of Life? 4\n\nhave been designed to differentiate law’s violence from violence outside the law—to sharply set capital punishment apart from the crimes the law condemns. This was especially true in the twentieth century, when enormous efforts were made to put people to death quietly, invisibly, and bureaucratically.14 The course of the last century is littered with various technologies—hanging, firing squad, electrocution, the gas chamber, lethal injection—used in a continuing effort to find an apparently humane means by which the state could take life.15 Executions, in this system, are not supposed to make headlines. Headlines today tell of a remarkable transformation in America’s death penalty. Over the course of the last decade, death sentences and executions have both fallen dramatically.16 We now impose fewer death sentences and execute fewer people than at any time in a quarter century. These changes have been driven by concerns about the reliability of the death penalty system in fairly adjudicating guilt and innocence, and in differentiating those who deserve a death sentence from those who do not. In addition, today the state’s dealing in death is linked to a concern for technological efficiency. We are invited, following Dr. Almojera, to imagine the body as a legible text, readable for what it can tell us about the capacity of technology to move us from life to death, swiftly and painlessly17—to ensure that execution is nothing more than “the mere extinguishment of life.” But why should the state care about the suffering of those it puts to death? Painful death might be more just and more effective as a deterrent than a death that is quick, quiet, and tranquil. Because justice would seem to demand equivalence between pain inflicted in the crime and the pain experienced as part of the punishment, there is something unsettling and paradoxical about the state’s constant search for a painless way of killing those who kill. As Arlene Blanchard, a survivor of Timothy McVeigh’s 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, in which 168 people were killed, explained after McVeigh’s death sentence was handed down, “death by injection is ‘too good’ for McVeigh.” She said he should be put in solitary confinement for life or simply hanged from a tree. “I know it sounds uncivilized, but\n\nTechnological Efficiency, Botched Executions, and Legitimacy 5\n\nI want him to experience just a little of the pain and torture that he has put us through.”18 Or, as William Baay, an emergency worker who helped remove bodies from the Murrah building, put it, “I don’t think conventional methods should be used. They should amputate his legs with no anesthesia . . . and then set him over a bunch of bamboo shoots and let them grow up into him until he’s dead.”19 Even as capital punishment seeks to do justice and/or satisfy the public desire for vengeance, the state has countervailing concerns. It must distinguish execution from the acts to which it is a supposedly just response. The state must also find ways of killing in a manner that does not allow the condemned to become an object of pity, or to appropriate the status of the victim. But despite determined claims to the contrary, capital death never simply means death. Rather, since its inception, it has been inextricably tied to the instruments used to carry it out. The legitimacy of state killing depends largely on execution method. Technology mediates between the state and death by masking physical pain and allowing citizens to imagine that execution is clean, efficient, and painless. When executions go wrong, they signal a break in the ritualization and routinization of state killing. Such mishaps can turn the organized, state-controlled ritual into torture. Solemn spectacles of sovereign power morph into horrible events and critical attention gets focused on the evolving execution technologies—and, even more intently, on their failures. Gruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America’s Death Penalty examines the history of botched executions in the United States from 1890 to 2010, a period in which approximately 3 percent of all executions were botched.20 Botched executions occur when there is a breakdown in, or departure from, the “protocol” for a particular method of execution. The protocol can be established by the norms, expectations, and advertised virtues of each method or by the government’s officially adopted execution guidelines. Botched executions are “those involving unanticipated problems or delays that caused, at least arguably, unnecessary agony for the prisoner or that reflect gross incompetence of the executioner.”21 Examples of such problems include, among other things,\n\nThe Mere Extinguishment of Life? 6\n\ninmates catching fire while being electrocuted, being strangled during hangings (instead of having their necks broken), and being administered the wrong dosages of specific drugs for lethal injections. Of approximately nine thousand capital sentences carried out in the United States from 1890 to 2010, we know of 276 that were botched—79 from 1900 to 1919, 70 from 1920 to 1949, 23 from 1950 to 1979, and 104 from 1980 to 2010 (see Appendix A).22 This book describes the problems that have plagued the technologies of state killing in an effort to understand those numbers as well as how and why things go wrong during executions. It tells the story of America’s death penalty through the eyes of those whose executions have gone terribly wrong (see Appendix B). The book focuses on 1890–2010, which was a crucial period in the transformation of America’s capital punishment from its traditional to its more modern form. It was, in addition, a critical period in what death penalty historian Stuart Banner calls “the continual centralization and professionalization of punishment,”23 and in the development of new technologies of execution. In this context, one might expect that botched executions would have undermined the death penalty’s legitimacy. As Chris Greer argues, Botched executions are of particular interest for at least two obvious reasons. First, they represent a direct challenge to the state’s desired presentation of capital punishment as quick, clean and painless. Secondly, by making the violence inherent in capital punishment clearly visible, and raising questions about the suffering of the condemned, they present abolitionists with an important opportunity to mobilize support against the continued use of the death penalty.24\n\nYet despite Greer’s reasonable expectation, throughout the twentieth century botched executions played only a minor role in efforts to end the death penalty in the United States. This book considers why they have not played a larger role in the efforts of abolitionists to end the death penalty. The twentieth-century search for ever more invisible, “humane” methods of state killing depended upon certain assumptions about the\n\nTechnological Efficiency, Botched Executions, and Legitimacy 7\n\nlegibility of pain in the journey from life to death. But the legal construction of state killing, while it appears to reveal an assumed empathy or identification between the state and those it kills, works primarily to differentiate state killing from murder. In these efforts, we are collectively invited to search for a way of taking life that signals our superiority and that marks the distinction between state violence and violence outside the law, between a death we call capital punishment and a death we call murder.\n\nDoing Death Silently, Invisibly The recent history of state killing in the United States reads like a story of the triumph of progress applied to the technologies of death.25 From hanging to electrocution, from electrocution to lethal gas, from electricity and gas to lethal injection, the law has moved, though not uniformly, from one technology to another.26 With the invention of new technologies for killing or, more precisely, with each new application of technology to killing, the law has proclaimed its own previous methods barbaric, or simply archaic, and has tried to put an end to the spectacle of botched executions. Thus, as one judge said about electrocution, “Execution by electrocution is a spectacle whose time has passed—like the guillotine or public stoning or burning at the stake. . . . Florida’s electric chair, by its own track record, has proven to be a dinosaur more befitting the laboratory of Baron Frankenstein than the death chamber of Florida State Prison.”27 Responding to the advent of lethal injection, another judge characterized the continuing use of hanging as “an ugly vestige of earlier, less civilized times when science had not yet developed medically-appropriate methods of bringing human life to an end.”28 Nothing but the best will do in the business of state killing. This search for a technological fix contrasts markedly with the execution practices of another era. As historian and social theorist Michel Foucault notes, in the past executions were “[m]ore than an act of justice”; they were a “manifestation of force.”29 They were always centrally about display, in particular the display of the majestic, awesome power of sovereignty to decide who suffers and who goes free, who lives and\n\nThe Mere Extinguishment of Life? 8\n\nwho dies. Public executions functioned as public theater but also as a school for citizenship.30 Selecting the right method to kill was a matter of sovereign prerogative. Execution methods were chosen for their ability to convey the ferocity of the sovereign’s vengeance. In the past, state killing produced a sadistic relation between the executioner, the victim, and the spectators. The pleasure of viewing, as well as the instruction in one’s relation to sovereign power, was to be found in witnessing pain inflicted. The excesses of execution and the enthusiastic response of attending audiences blended the performance of torture with pleasure, creating an unembarrassed celebration of death as one person’s sovereign will materialized on the body of the condemned. The display of violence—of the sovereignty that was constituted in killing—was designed to create fearful, if not obedient, subjects. Gruesome spectacles simply accentuated the fearsome lesson. The act of putting someone to death contained a dramatic, awe-inspiring pedagogy of power. “The public execution,” Foucault explained, has a juridico-political function. It is a ceremonial by which a momentarily injured sovereignty is reconstituted. It restores sovereignty by manifesting it at its most spectacular. The public execution, however hasty and everyday, belongs to a whole series of great rituals in which power is eclipsed and restored (coronation, entry of the king into a conquered city, the submission of rebellious subjects). . . . There must be an emphatic affirmation of power and its intrinsic superiority. And this superiority is not simply that of right, but that of the physical strength of the sovereign beating down upon the body of his adversary and mastering it.31\n\nCapital punishment was precisely about the right of the state to kill as it pleased, and sovereignty was known in and through the very act of taking life. Executions were designed to make the state’s dealings in death majestically visible to all. Live, but live by the grace of the sovereign; live, but remember that your life belongs to the state. These were the messages of executions in an earlier era. Without a public audience state killing would have been meaning-\n\nTechnological Efficiency, Botched Executions, and Legitimacy 9\n\nless. As Foucault put it, “Not only must the people know, they must see with their own eyes. Because they must be made afraid, but also because they must be witnesses, the guarantors of the punishment, and because they must to a certain extent take part in it.”32 According to this understanding of punishment, the people were, at one and the same time, fearful subjects, authorizing witnesses, and lustful participants. Today, execution, with some notable exceptions, has been transformed from dramatic spectacle to cool, bureaucratic operation, and the role of the public is now strictly limited and strictly controlled. Modern executions are carried out behind prison walls in what amounts to semiprivate, sacrificial ceremonies in which only a few selected witnesses are gathered in a carefully controlled environment to see and, in their seeing, to sanctify the state’s taking of the life of one of its citizens.33 Capital punishment has become, at best, a hidden reality. It is known, if it is known at all, by indirection. Hugo Bedau, a distinguished philosopher and ardent abolitionist, noted that “The relative privacy of executions nowadays (even photographs of the condemned man dying are almost invariably strictly prohibited) means that the average American literally does not know what is being done when the government, in his name and presumably on his behalf, executes a criminal.”34 What was public is now private. What was high drama has been reduced to a matter of technique. Whereas the technologies of killing deployed by the state were once valued precisely because of their gruesome effects on the body of the condemned, today we seek a technology that leaves no trace. While in the past technologies were valued as ways of making sovereign power awe-inspiring and terrifying, today the process of state killing is medicalized; it is less about sovereignty than science. Executions were progressively stripped of their ritualistic and religious aspects. . . . [A]s Americans developed a keen dread of physical pain, medical professionals teamed up with . . . engineers to devise a purportedly “painless” method of administering the death penalty. . . . The condemned man. . . . had now become simply the object of medico-bureaucratic\n\nThe Mere Extinguishment of Life? 10\n\ntechnique—his body read closely for signs of pain. . . . The overriding aim of the state functionaries charged with conducting executions nowadays is to “get the man dead” as quickly, uneventfully, impersonally, and painlessly as Nature and Science permit.35\n\nSince the earliest recorded execution in America in 1608, the state has put approximately 17,000 men and women to death.36 “We’ve sawed people in half, beheaded them, burned them, drowned them, crushed them with rocks, tied them to anthills, buried them alive, and [executed them] in almost every way except perhaps boiling them in oil.”37 Today, however, five methods of execution are legally available: firing squad, hanging, lethal gas, electrocution, and lethal injection. Lethal injection is an authorized method of execution in thirty-two states. The firing squad is legal only in Oklahoma (but only if lethal injection and electrocution are declared unconstitutional), while New Hampshire and Washington allow death by hanging in addition to lethal injection. Four states (Arizona, California, Missouri, and Wyoming) allow the use of lethal gas and nine more permit electrocution.38 This array of methods stands in stark contrast to the end of the nineteenth century when hanging was America’s primary method of execution. In 1888, when New York became the first state to substitute death by electrocution for hanging, it did so because an expert commission found it to be “the most humane and practical method known to modern science of carrying into effect the sentence of death.”39 States that eventually followed New York’s lead “viewed (electrocution) as less painful than hanging and less horrific than having the condemned swing from the gallows.”40 In time, states that rejected hanging in favor of the gas chamber viewed the latter as “more decent” than electrocution since it seemed less violent and did not mutilate the body.41 The original legislation authorizing the use of gas stipulated that the condemned was to be put to death “without warning and while asleep in his cell.”42 Similar concerns about decency have been echoed in the most recent development among the technologies of state killing. Upholding the constitutionality of lethal injection, a federal district court recently\n\nTechnological Efficiency, Botched Executions, and Legitimacy 11\n\nnoted that “There is general agreement that lethal injection is at present the most humane type of execution available and is far preferable to the sometimes barbaric means employed in the past.”43 This is hardly the language of the survivors and families of the victims of the Oklahoma City bombing or the awe-inspiring sovereignty about which Foucault wrote. It begs the question, What exactly is at stake when the state imagines itself executing decently, painlessly, humanely, and flawlessly?\n\nOn the Invisible Body of the Condemned Cases challenging the constitutionality of particular methods of execution are regularly, though not frequently, brought before courts in the United States.44 In the first two cases to reach the United States Supreme Court, it first upheld the use of firing squads45 and then electrocution as methods by which the state could take life.46 In the latter case, the Court proclaimed that no method of execution could be used that would “involve torture or a lingering death.”47 It went on to say that the state could kill so long as it used methods that did not impose “something more than the mere extinguishment of life.”48 In a single remarkable sentence, the Court casually purports to limit sovereign prerogative. The juxtaposition of the word “mere” with the phrase “extinguishment of life”—an awkward circumlocution for death—seemingly acquiesces in the view that this “mere” death at the hands of the state gives no grounds for complaint. With this declaration, the Court leaves no room for mishaps that very often make execution something more than merely extinguishing life. It condemns excess, “something more,” as if state-imposed death itself was not already an excess that marks the limits of the state’s sovereignty over life.49 The state can spare life, or extinguish it, but it cannot require its victims to “linger” between life and death. Law stands ready to police the work of sovereignty, but it still grants sovereignty its due. The sovereign domain extends to deciding who shall die and how they die; law is left to regulate only the technologies through which the state takes life. Sometimes, however, even this jurisdiction has seemed more than the law could, or would, handle. Indeed, more often than not, the law\n\nThe Mere Extinguishment of Life? 12\n\nhas restrained itself from intervening in the face of allegations about the excesses of the state’s dealing in death or about executions gone wrong. Perhaps the most famous instance of such inaction occurred in Francis v. Resweber,50 a case in which the Supreme Court allowed the state of Louisiana to electrocute a convicted murderer a second time after the first attempt was botched. As the Court recounted the relevant facts, “Francis was prepared for execution and on May 3, 1946 . . . was placed in the official electric chair of the State of Louisiana. . . . The executioner threw the switch but, presumably because of some mechanical difficulty, death did not result.”51 Sometime later Francis sought to prevent a “second” execution by contending that it would constitute cruel and unusual punishment.52 Justice Reed, writing for a majority, responded to these claims in what initially appears to be a rather unusual way. For him, the cruelty of Louisiana’s plan had little to do with Francis,53 and any pain he might have suffered during the first execution or his painful anticipations of the second. The Constitution, as Reed understood it, clearly permits “the necessary suffering involved in any method employed to extinguish life humanely.”54 In Reed’s formulation, then, some suffering, suffering deemed “necessary,” is fully compatible with humane killing. Something more than the mere extinction of life is permissible so long as that excess inheres in the “method” and so long as it is impossible for the state to kill without it. If Francis were to undergo a second, more lethal dose of electricity, it would be because the law, not the judges, allowed it. According to that law, the fact of the first, unsuccessful execution would not “add an element of cruelty to a subsequent execution.”55 The constitutional question, as Reed saw it, turned instead on the behavior of those in charge of Francis’s “first” execution, those authorized to unleash state violence. Their acts and intentions were decisive in determining whether a second attempt at execution would be unconstitutionally cruel. From the facts as he understood them, Reed found those officials to have carried out their duties in a “careful and humane manner” with “no suggestion of malevolence”56 and no “purpose to inflict unnecessary\n\nTechnological Efficiency, Botched Executions, and Legitimacy 13\n\npain.”57 The fact that the execution was botched had no independent constitutional significance. Justice Reed described diligent, indeed even compassionate, executioners frustrated by what he labeled an “unforeseeable accident . . . for which no man is to blame,” and concluded that the state itself would be unfairly punished were it deprived of a second chance to electrocute Francis.58 Indeed, when Reed does consider the effect the first attempt had on Francis, he suggests, again relying on the image of the first electrocution as an accident, that Francis could only have suffered “the identical amount of mental anguish and physical pain (as in) any other occurrence, such as . . . a fire in the cell block.”59 While Reed described Francis as an “accident victim,” the issue from Francis’s perspective was the future as much as the past. What was constitutionally significant was the connection between the violence inflicted on him during the first execution attempt and the violence the state, with the Supreme Court’s blessing, proposed to inflict on him in a second electrocution. The Court’s interest in the pain Francis had already experienced and would again experience was so remote, as was the singular and individual death it was condoning, that only late in the dissenting opinion of Justice Burton was any reference made to the effect of the first execution attempt on Francis. There we are told that his “lips puffed out and he groaned and jumped so that the chair came off the floor.”60 Nonetheless, even here the significance of Francis’s pain and impending death is deferred. References to that pain, taken from affidavits by witnesses to the first electrocution, were included solely to point out a “conflict in testimony,”61 which made it impossible, in Burton’s view, to determine whether any electricity had actually reached Francis during the abortive execution attempt. The conflict to which Burton refers arose when those in charge of the electrical equipment testified that “no electrical current reached . . . (Francis) and that his flesh did not show electrical burns.”62 Burton did worry about the number of botched executions the majority might tolerate before declaring subsequent attempts to be cruel and unusual. Yet while he labeled the state’s desire to carry out another\n\nThe Mere Extinguishment of Life? 14\n\nattempt “death by installments,”63 most of his opinion was devoted to careful scrutiny of Louisiana’s death penalty statute. Death itself was not the object of attention. Instead Burton affirmed the possibility of law’s mastery over death, as well as law’s fidelity to its own rules for taking life. A proper execution is one whose occasions and procedures are prescribed by law, just as a proper judgment is one governed by the law and the law alone. Since the statute made no provision for “a second, third or multiple application of (electric) current,”64 a second execution attempt should not be permitted. Though he differed as to the correct outcome, Burton joined Reed in severing the connection between their own acts of judgment and the fate of Willie Francis. The Court acted as if the state’s behavior was constitutionally significant, while it ignored the experience and prospective death of the state’s intended victim. The way Burton and Reed proceeded in Francis seems, in the end, all too familiar and yet, from the perspective of the reactions to the Kinsauls and Medina executions, somewhat strange. In Francis, death and the fact of an execution gone wrong is the heart of the matter. But it has only a shadowy presence, barely acknowledged. Where it is, as it were, inadvertently glimpsed, Francis’s return date with electrocution is presented as the implementation of some abstract, impersonal set of written rules; the judge’s own hand is stayed. In Burton’s and Reed’s opinions, both death and the event of the state’s failure to get it right become strangely absent subjects. This book seeks to reverse the perspectives of Burton and Reed by bringing the experiences of those whose executions have been botched into the history of America’s death penalty—by telling the stories of the people whose deaths involved something much more than the “mere extinguishment of life.”\n\nThe “Body in Pain” Today death remains the absent subject when courts confront challenges to the state’s technologies of death. However, since the Francis case, where the question of pain was almost completely elided, courts faced with these challenges now focus, almost obsessively, on that ques-\n\nTechnological Efficiency, Botched Executions, and Legitimacy 15\n\ntion.65 Sometimes they treat the body as a legible text. Evidence that the state’s method of taking life imposes something more than the mere extinction of life can be read on the body of the condemned, they assume. At other times, however, courts seek to read pain indirectly, hardly mentioning the body at all. That said, the law’s increasing obsession with pain is much more about the way it appears to those who serve as witnesses, real or imagined, to executions. The experience of execution by its witnesses—their “suffering”—fuels the search for painless death. Three late-twentieth-century examples serve to highlight this continuity and difference. All of these cases try to identify the line between an acceptable use of a technology of execution and a botched execution. The first, Campbell v. Wood,66 decided in 1994, dealt with the constitutionality of hanging; the second, Fierro v. Gomez,67 decided later that same year, dealt with execution by lethal gas; the third, a 1999 decision of the Florida State Supreme Court, Provenzano v. Moore,68 concerned the constitutionality of electrocution. The first upheld the use of hanging; the second prohibited California from using gas to kill; the third found that death in the electric chair did not violate the Constitution.\n\nCampbell v. Wood In 1976, Charles Campbell was sentenced to forty years in prison for assaulting and sodomizing Renae Wicklund in her home two years earlier. After five years of “good conduct,” he was transferred to a work release facility in Everett, Washington. A few months later, Renae Wicklund, her eight-year-old daughter, Shannah, and her neighbor Barbara Hendrickson were found brutally murdered in Wicklund’s home. All three were strangled, slashed at the throat, and had bled to death. Campbell was convicted on three counts of aggravated first-degree murder on November 26, 1982, and sentenced to death.69 From March 1985, when the Snohomish County Superior Court first issued a death warrant, to the Ninth Circuit’s remand for an evidentiary hearing concerning the constitutionality of hanging on May 1,\n\nThe Mere Extinguishment of Life? 16\n\n1993, Campbell filed a total of four appeals, three habeas corpus petitions, and six other various motions.70 Along the way, hanging was put on trial. In one of Campbell’s appeals Judge John C. Coughenour, of the federal district court in Seattle, conducted a three-day evidentiary hearing in order to determine whether execution by hanging constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. While the state attempted to prove the mathematical precision and painlessness of hanging and its compatibility with the ideals of the modern liberal state, Campbell’s lawyers fought against this abstracted scientific construction and “domestication” of the noose. They argued that “what the law essentially is cannot be dissociated from the hood placed over Campbell’s head, the shackles fastened around his ankles, the oversized eyehook securing the rope that ends in a noose encircling his neck.”71 They tried to expose hanging as a barbaric anachronism. Campbell’s case rested, in effect, almost entirely on the history of botched executions. At first, Campbell’s attorneys’ task might not seem difficult at all. Throughout the course of the twentieth century, jurisdiction after jurisdiction in the United States and around the world had rejected hanging precisely because it was deemed excessively and irreconcilably “barbaric.” By 1973, only seven states still permitted it. However, from the outset, Campbell’s challenge faced two formidable obstacles. First, although hanging was used in each of the seventy-three executions carried out in Washington’s history, the state admitted that it had no records, of any kind, of judicial hangings occurring prior to January 1993.72 Moreover, the district court held that any evidence Campbell offered concerning past hangings was irrelevant unless it met certain, practically unobtainable criteria. An impressive compilation of evidence documenting 170 botched judicial hangings performed in the United States between 1622 and 1993 was excluded because Campbell’s lawyers (understandably) could not specify (1) the executed person’s weight, (2) the exact height that person dropped, and (3) the width of the rope.73\n\nTechnological Efficiency, Botched Executions, and Legitimacy 17\n\nIn short, the court deemed every execution conducted before Washington’s adoption of its present protocol irrelevant. During the evidentiary hearing, Walla Walla State Penitentiary’s superintendent acknowledged that the Field Instruction Manual prepared by the Department of Corrections in 1992, outlining the state’s “new” hanging procedures, had been copied verbatim from a 1959 manual of army regulations titled Procedure for Military Execution. When Campbell’s leading attorney asked superintendent Tana Wood why the state specifically chose to adopt the army’s protocols, she responded, with a shocking lack of pretense, “Because it came from the military.”74 In fact, as Campbell’s lawyers pointed out, the military manual based its procedure on a mathematical table correlating the weight of the condemned and the length of the rope, measurements produced by a British investigative committee in 1886 (see Table 1). British Home Secretary Richard Asshelton Cross had appointed the committee and charged it with inquiring into “the existing practices as to carrying out of sentences of death, and the causes which in several recent cases have led either to failure or to unseemly occurrences.” The table was generated out of the committee’s research using a dynamometer and hundreds of sacks filled with varying amounts of sand. The 1993 evidentiary hearings revolved around the state’s contention that the table “may be fully depended upon to produce instantaneous Table 1.

Kaufman-Osborn, From Noose to Needle, 88.\n\nThe Mere Extinguishment of Life? 18\n\nloss of consciousness and the speedy death of even the most robust.”75 As Kaufman-Osborn observes, “In a nutshell, whereas the state’s attorneys must render persuasive the table’s implicit claim to eliminate the possibility of error and so guarantee a death that entails no detectable suffering, Campbell’s attorneys must seek to trouble these claims by undermining the table’s pretense to practical certitude and so rendering the body a site of possible pain.”76 In the words of a prison spokesperson, Campbell’s imminent execution would be, like “any given hanging,” nothing more than a simple “math problem.”77 And yet, despite such official confidence, history emphatically demonstrates that hanging human bodies “without risk of failure or miscarriage of any sort” has always been, and continues to be, an unrealizable dream.78 This was the context of Campbell’s appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and his claim that hanging violated the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment. According to Judge Beezer, writing for the Campbell majority, the court had to decide “whether hanging comports with contemporary standards of decency.”79 He noted that while few states used hanging, no court in the United States had ever found execution by hanging to violate the Constitution. As Beezer argued, the question of whether hanging was acceptable depended on “the actual pain that may or may not attend the practice.”80 Determining the constitutionality of this method of execution required the court to read the body of the condemned for what it reveals of its suffering as it moves from the world of the living to the world of the dead. Beezer took note of the fact that the district court had heard extensive expert and eyewitness testimony concerning the pain associated with hanging.81 He wrote confidently about the court’s ability to know the pain of the condemned even as he noted that pain itself would not render hanging invalid. A method of execution, he claimed, relying on In re Kemmler, an 1890 case in which the Supreme Court upheld electrocution, and Francis, is unconstitutional if it “involves the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.”82 With this as the standard, Beezer offered an extended discussion\n\nTechnological Efficiency, Botched Executions, and Legitimacy 19\n\nof the methods used in hanging, contrasting in particular the so-called “long-drop” with the “short-drop” method.83 Several factors, he found, contribute to making death by hanging “comparatively painless”84; for example, the length of the drop, the selection and treatment of the rope, the positioning of the knot. The state of Washington’s use of the longdrop method, he said, is designed “to ensure that forces to the neck structures are optimized to cause rapid unconsciousness and death.”85 The result of that method, Beezer argued, was that “unconsciousness and death . . . occur extremely rapidly, that unconsciousness was likely to be immediate or within a matter of seconds, and that death would follow rapidly thereafter.”86 He ended his opinion by reiterating that “Campbell is not entitled to a painless execution, but only one free of purposeful cruelty.”87 Here Beezer seems to return us, at least partially, to the world of Francis in which attention moves from the executed to the executioner, from the body in pain to the intentions of state officials. But there is a crucial difference: unlike in Francis, where the subject of pain is almost completely avoided, in Campbell determining the pain associated with one or another technology of death is a necessary, though not sufficient, first step. If such a determination suggests that the condemned is subject to pain, the court must then, but only then, inquire into the purposes of the state in imposing death through that method. Evidence of pain attendant to a routine or a botched execution is significant as a sign of barbarism on the part of those who take life. Pain is thus the dangerous supplement of death, signaling as it does excess or sadistic pleasure associated with the willful taking of human life. Judge Reinhardt dissented from Beezer’s view in Campbell because it seemed to equate the Eighth Amendment’s “evolving standard of decency” jurisprudence solely with an inquiry into pain and its purposes. In Reinhardt’s view the development of “new and less brutal methods of execution, such as lethal injection . . . as well as the risks of pain and mutilation inherent in hanging” make the latter constitutionally defective.88 The fact that by the time of Campbell all but a few state legisla-\n\nThe Mere Extinguishment of Life? 20\n\ntures had abolished hanging provided, for Reinhardt, a crucial indicator of its incompatibility with contemporary standards of decency. Moreover, if the reduction of needless pain were to be taken as the exclusive measure of a technique’s constitutionality, “barbaric and savage” forms of punishment, such as the guillotine, would not be constitutionally impermissible. In the end, even if the Constitution were to mandate only an objective inquiry into pain and its purposes, and even if every hanging were carried out in a flawless manner, judicial hanging would still, in Reinhardt’s view, be unacceptable because it is “a crude, rough, and wanton procedure, the purpose of which is to tear apart the spine. It is needlessly violent and intrusive, deliberately degrading and dehumanizing. It causes grievous fear beyond that of death itself and the attendant consequences are often humiliating and disgusting.”89 Reinhardt focused too on the prospect of a botched execution as he contemplated a “high risk of pain far more than is necessary to kill a condemned inmate. If the drop is too short, the prisoner will strangle to death, a slow and painful process . . . [if the drop] is too long the prisoner may be decapitated.”90 A punishment can be cruel, Reinhardt contended, even if it is not painful. Cruelty can arise “from the relatively painless infliction of degradation, savagery, and brutality. . . . Indignities can be inflicted even after a person has died.”91 The Constitution obligates the state, when it chooses to kill, to “eliminate the degrading, brutal, and violent aspects of an execution, and substitute a scientifically developed and approved method of terminating life through appropriate medical procedures in a neutral, medical environment.”92 Where science makes available technologies for ending life that serve the same goals, but with markedly lower risk of imposing pain, the Constitution requires that the state follow science. On Reinhardt’s reading, the state is not master of technology; it is instead subservient to it. Whereas Beezer imposed few limits on the sovereign’s choice of methods of execution, Reinhardt would eliminate much, if not all, of the sovereign’s discretion. While Beezer and Reinhardt differ on the sufficiency of pain and\n\nTechnological Efficiency, Botched Executions, and Legitimacy 21\n\nthe significance of the risk of a botched execution as a standard in determining the constitutionality of a method of execution, both assume that they can know the pain of another and that they can represent it faithfully in their opinions. As Reinhardt put it, “There is absolutely no question that every hanging involves a risk that the prisoner will not die immediately, but will instead struggle or asphyxiate to death. This process, which may take several minutes, is extremely painful. Not only does the prisoner experience the pain felt by any strangulation victim, but he does so while dangling at the end of a rope.”93Although neither Beezer nor Reinhardt may know, or be able to accurately represent, death, they write with no hesitancy about their ability to know the pain that precedes it.94\n\nFierro v. Gomez The apparent displacement of death, as well as this same confidence in the court’s ability to read and represent pain, reappear in Fierro. Judge Patel notes, early in her opinion, that while lethal gas had been California’s execution technology of choice since 1937, in the mid-1980s Warden Vasquez of San Quentin revised the state’s execution protocol. This statement takes on significance later in her decision when it is linked to the kind of technological imperative hinted at in Reinhardt’s opinion in Campbell. As Patel put it, neither the warden nor his staff “consulted scientific experts or medical personnel in formulating the execution protocol nor did they examine records from previous California executions.”95 The result is characterized as an “unscientific, slapdash” execution protocol.96 When sovereignty today exercises its power over life and death, it is no longer free to kill in a gruesome way in order to instill awe and fear in the citizenry. The availability of lethal injection, which Patel characterized as “more humane than lethal gas as a method of execution,” renders the latter “antiquated” and suddenly incompatible with the Constitution.97 Taking Campbell as governing authority, Patel characterized it as making “clear” that the “key question to be answered in a\n\nThe Mere Extinguishment of Life? 22\n\nchallenge to the method of execution is how much pain the inmate suffers.”98 Campbell, she argued, “dictates that a court look first to objective evidence of pain.”99After providing an elaborate description of the gas chamber and the procedures used during an execution by lethal gas, Patel reviewed contradictory expert testimony concerning the effects of lethal gas and the precise ways it brings about death. According to her summary, the basic disagreement between plaintiff and defense experts is “whether unconsciousness occurs within at most thirty seconds of inhalation, as defendants maintain, or whether, as plaintiffs contend, unconsciousness occurs much later, after the inmate has endured the painful effects of cyanide gas for several minutes.”100 To resolve this conflict, she reviewed extant scientific literature and determined that while “plaintiffs’ theory of death through cellular suffocation has traditionally been the accepted viewpoint,”101 the scientific community was neither uniform nor clear in its conclusions. Next Patel reviewed two types of eyewitness accounts of execution by lethal gas. The first type, contemporaneous observations and records of physicians who attended every execution by lethal gas, reads like an obsessive archive of death. In those records physicians note when, during the course of an execution, each of the following events occur: “‘Sodium Cyanide Enters’; ‘Gas Strikes Prisoner’s Face’; ‘Prisoner Apparently Unconscious’; and ‘Prisoner Certainly Unconscious’ and ‘Last Bodily Movement.’”102 Second, she also considered the observations of lay witnesses. Patel prefaced her discussion of all this evidence by noting that “neither consciousness nor pain is easy to gauge. Actions that appear volitional or appear to be a reaction to pain may in fact be unconscious and non-volitional.”103 Yet these cautions did not inhibit her interpretation of the observational testimony. Pain, while difficult to measure, could be read on the surface of the body, by untrained people as well as by medical personnel. Their observations provided the basis for constitutional judgment. In California’s two most recent executions, physicians observed that\n\nTechnological Efficiency, Botched Executions, and Legitimacy 23\n\n“certain unconsciousness” did not occur until three minutes after the gas hit the face of the condemned. Records of California’s earlier executions contain similar results. Taken together, the expert testimony, the scientific literature, the physicians’ records, and eyewitness statements “compel” and “unmistakably” point,104 according to the judge, to the conclusion that during a period of consciousness following the dispensing of lethal gas, “inmates suffer intense, visceral pain, primarily as a result of lack of oxygen to the cells.”105 This shows that, in contrast to its advertised virtues, execution by lethal gas is frequently botched. The result, Patel asserted, moving from calm balancing of evidence to vivid imagery, is “akin to the experience of a major heart attack, or to being held under water.”106 Resorting here to analogy, Patel conjures imagined horrors somewhat closer to the average citizen’s experience than the particular horrors of death in the gas chamber. Patel, like Beezer and Reinhardt in Campbell, foregrounds the question of what the journey from life to death might be like under a certain execution technique. She too focuses on the risk of executions gone wrong and the presence of pain as she carefully constructs a narrative from different strands of evidence. Her opinion textualizes pain, at times by focusing on the body of the condemned and at other times by reading through it to understand consciousness and its limits. She insists that the state kill as flawlessly, as softly, as gently, as painlessly as the innovations of men and women allow.107\n\nProvenzano v. Moore The majority in Provenzano, which began by taking the fact of botched executions seriously, focused on problems in the execution of another Florida inmate, Allen Lee Davis, though it claimed that his execution was not botched. “Allen Lee Davis,” the court claimed, “did not suffer any conscious pain while being electrocuted in Florida’s electric chair. Rather he suffered instantaneous and painless death once the current was applied to him.”108 The Provenzano majority cautioned against misreading the body, saying, “The nose bleed incurred by Allen Lee\n\nThe Mere Extinguishment of Life? 24\n\nDavis began before the electric current was applied to him, and was not caused whatsoever by the application of electrical current to Davis.”109 It noted that “the record in this case reveals abundant evidence that execution by electrocution renders an inmate instantaneously unconscious, thereby making it impossible to feel pain.”110 Because it is painless, the court concluded, death by electrocution is not cruel, and because it is not cruel, it is not unconstitutional. In his dissent Justice Shaw agreed, at least in part, about the centrality of pain, though he reached strikingly different conclusions about its presence when electrocution is used. Like Reinhardt in Campbell, he insisted that the courts should not focus exclusively on pain as the sole indicator of cruelty. Taking botched executions as his template, he insisted the court should attend to the question of what he labeled “violence, mutilation, and disgrace.”111 Choosing the guillotine as his example, Shaw expressed a breezy confidence in his ability to read pain when he noted, “while beheading results in a quick, relatively painless death, it entails frank violence (i.e. gross laceration and blood-letting) and mutilation (i.e. decapitation), and disgrace . . . and thus is facially cruel.”112 Pain as well as violence, mutilation, and disgrace, he claimed, accompany electrocution. “Not only was every execution in Florida accompanied by the inevitable convulsing and burning that characterizes electrocution, but further, three executions were marred by extraordinary violence and mutilation. In two . . . , smoke and flames spurted from the headpiece and burned the heads and faces of the inmates. In the third execution, the inmate bled from the nostrils and was at least partially asphyxiated by the restraining devices; and he too was burned.”113 Shaw’s opinion goes on for pages providing elaborate, detailed, and graphic descriptions of those three executions, paying particular attention to the third, the Davis execution. But in a truly extraordinary gesture, he appended to his opinion “post-execution color photos of Davis before he was removed from the electric chair. These photos . . . provide a vivid picture of a violent scene . . . [and] show a ghastly post-\n\nTechnological Efficiency, Botched Executions, and Legitimacy 25\n\nexecution scene.”114 While he provided a description of what those photographs show (“a stream of blood pours from his nostrils, flows over the wide-leather mouth-strap, runs down his neck and chest, and forms a bright red pool . . . on his white shirt”115), the photographic evidence was meant to speak for itself and, in so doing, to capture the brutal reality of an execution gone awry. Appending such images to a judicial opinion transgresses convention in such a way as to ensure that they will be the subject of considerable attention and commentary. Photographs shock and appeal to a different register of understanding. They make pain and the violence associated with state killing into a matter of sight. Because they are so “vivid,” Shaw assumed that they would convey reality in a way language never could. Thus the presence of the photos is not only an almost unprecedented judicial effort to make state killing visible, it also provides a stark reminder of the limits of language when it ventures to speak about physical violence and physical pain. Pain, literary theorist Elaine Scarry observes, has no voice. . . . When one hears about another’s physical pain, the events happening within the interior of that person’s body may seem to have the remote character of some deep subterranean fact, belonging to an invisible geography that, however portentous, has no reality because it has not yet manifested itself on the visible surface of the earth.116\n\nAccording to Scarry, “Whatever pain achieves, it achieves in part through its unsharability, and it ensures this unsharability through its resistance to language.”117 “A great deal is at stake,” Scarry herself suggests, “in the attempt to invent linguistic structures that will reach and accommodate this area of experience normally so inaccessible to language.”118 Judicial opinions on methods of execution surely confirm this view. Yet Scarry reminds us that the courts’ capacity to understand and to convey to their readers the pain of the person being executed is quite limited. Scarry invites us to consider Francis, Campbell, Fierro, and Provenz-\n\nThe Mere Extinguishment of Life? 26\n\nano for what they tell us about the use of language to comprehend and represent violence and pain. She invites us to consider how we can understand what happens to the condemned when executions are botched. However, she suggests that in law, as elsewhere, the language available to capture that understanding is quite limited. “As physical pain is monolithically consistent in its assault on language,” Scarry writes, “so the verbal strategies for overcoming the assault are very small in number and reappear consistently as one looks at the words of the patient, physician, Amnesty worker, lawyer, artist.”119 Those verbal strategies “revolve (first) around the verbal sign of the weapon.”120 We know pain, in the first instance, through its instrumentalities, for example hanging or lethal gas. Second, we know it through its effects. Here violence and pain are represented in the “wound,” that is, “the bodily damage that is pictured as accompanying pain.”121 But as Scarry suggests, these representations cannot provide certain or reliable grounding for a jurisprudence that seeks to govern the technologies through which the state puts people to death. Yet it is precisely those representations that play a central role in the way we understand botched executions. If Scarry is right, then when judges, journalists, and scholars confront the fact of botched executions, they face epistemological and interpretive as well as legal and political problems. By deferring the question of death and foregrounding the question of pain, they are required to take seriously the empirical world of the body and its suffering even as they necessarily run up against the limits of their capacity to know that world and to translate that knowledge into language.122 Yet again, we are driven back to the question of why the issue of pain and the search for efficient, reliable, and painless execution play so large a part in the law’s effort to regulate execution and to police the boundary between an acceptable and a botched execution.\n\nTechnological Efficiency, Botched Executions, and Legitimacy 27\n\nThe Hand of Punishment, Humanely Applied? Even as the United States seems to be on the road to abolishing death as a criminal punishment, we remain committed to the effort, when we do execute, to execute gently—to impose no more pain than is necessary. That the law requires the state to kill in this manner seems, in a way, counterintuitive; it may precipitate one kind of crisis of legitimacy by distancing the state from the voices of victims and the demands of vengeance and, in so doing, by raising questions like those raised by the mother of a murder victim quoted in one of the epigraphs of this book: “Do they feel anything? Do they hurt? Is there any pain? Very humane compared to what they’ve done to our children. The torture they’ve put our kids through. I think sometimes it’s too easy. They ought to feel something. If it’s fire burning all the way through their body or whatever. There ought to be some little sense of pain to it.” Perhaps this strategy is less counterintuitive than it might seem. Legal scholar Alan Hyde argues that the requirement that the state kill humanely “follows a common pattern in which the humanistic, sentimentalized body in pain emerges as a site of empathy and identification” in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.123 Sentimentalizing the body of the condemned, Hyde notes, establishes a bridge between the criminal and the public. The criminal, no matter how horrific his deeds, is like us in his body’s most basic “amenability to feeling.”124 The concern that punishment not inflict physical pain and the empathy which pain enables and expresses, Hyde observes, “lies behind the curious search in American legal history for painless methods of execution.”125 In an endlessly repeating ritual, he says, “electrocution, gas chambers, lethal injections are each introduced with tremendous fanfare as a painless form of death, until each is revealed to promote its own kind of suffering on the way to death.”126 Yet as Hyde himself recognizes, execution marks the limits of empathy, reminding citizens of the ultimate disconnection between themselves and the condemned, a disconnection that seeks to operate at the moral level.127\n\nThe Mere Extinguishment of Life? 28\n\nThus the problem of botched executions and the search for painless death might be better understood as one way of keeping sentimental, simplifying narratives of criminal and victim intact by not allowing the condemned to assume the status of victims of outmoded technologies of death. Law imposes on sovereignty the requirement that no matter how heinous the crime or how reprehensible the criminal, we not do death as death has been done by those we punish. We give them a kinder, gentler death than they deserve to mark a boundary between the “civilized” and the “savage,” rather than to establish a connection between citizens and murderers. We kill humanely, not out of concern for the condemned but rather to vividly establish a hierarchy between the law-abiding and the lawless.128 We may not be able to know death, or comprehend its possibilities or its horrors, but where law requires the killing state to kill efficiently and reliably, it seeks legitimacy in an image of the hand of punishment humanely applied. It may be death we are doing, but it is a death whose savagery law insists it can, and will, control. Botched executions would seem to complicate that effort and to turn executions into the kind of gruesome spectacles that marked the premodern era. For the judges in Campbell, Fierro, and Provenzano, botched executions threatened to erode the boundaries between the state’s violence and its extralegal counterpart. As Judge Shaw observed, “The color photos of Davis depict a man who—for all appearances—was brutally tortured to death by the citizens of Florida. . . . Each botched execution cast[s] the entire criminal justice system of this state—including the courts—in ignominy.”129 Botched executions generate for Shaw, and others like him, an anxious questioning about the ways state violence truly differs from the violence to which it is, at least in theory, opposed. The effort to kill softly, gently, painlessly, humanely is one response to that questioning, one way of trying to show that the state, though born of the violent disruptions of the existing order of things, can transcend the violence of its origins.130 As a response to this anxious questioning, courts insist on policing\n\nTechnological Efficiency, Botched Executions, and Legitimacy 29\n\nthe technologies of death and work hard to ensure that sovereign power responds to scientific progress, that ferocity gives way to bureaucracy. State killing, guided by the restraining hand of law, in this view should be rational, purposive, and proportional; the violence to which it responds is, in contrast, imagined to be irrational, anomic, and excessive. In the face of scientific “progress,” the forms of legal procedure cannot condone archaic displays of sovereignty like those demanded by the survivors and families of the victims of the Oklahoma City bombing. The chapters that follow take up each of the major methods of execution used during the twentieth century,131 in each case first examining how the technology was linked to the effort to kill painlessly and efficiently. These chapters describe the kinds of things that have gone wrong with those technologies, and tell the stories of some of the men and women who have died when those technologies misfired. Schooled by Scarry about the limits of representation, this book nonetheless takes up the metric of pain. It does so precisely because of its centrality within the contemporary jurisprudence of capital punishment, and to show how that metric works in popular culture as well as judicial opinions. This is done to foreground the question of whether the state can even superficially live up to its commitment that execution should involve no more than “the mere extinguishment of life.” The book also investigates how botched executions propelled changes in methods of execution over the course of the twentieth century. Although at times they have occasioned challenges to particular execution methods, botched executions have contributed little to the effort to end capital punishment itself. This is so because they have been understood, to borrow the language of political theorist Judith Shklar, as misfortunes rather than injustices. The book will conclude by describing how, during the twentieth century, the cultural reception of botched executions helped to insure that they did little to undermine the legitimacy of America’s death penalty.\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nA Clumsy, Inefficient, Inhuman Thing Death by Hanging\n\nIn “Earth’s Holocaust,” an allegorical short story set in the American Midwest, Nathaniel Hawthorne has his fictional reformers throw society’s instruments of capital punishment—“those horrible monsters of mechanism . . . which lurked in the dusty nooks of ancient prisoners, the subject of terror-stricken legend”—into their great redeeming bonfire along with the other “condemned rubbish” of the world.1 The “old implements of cruelty,” the halters, axes, and guillotines, are all successively destroyed. When, in 1844, Hawthorne wrote this story, a death sentence meant judicial hanging: to hang by the neck until dead. For the bulk of human history, states have relied exclusively on the gallows to do their killing. During the two centuries following the Glorious Revolution, when a judge at Old Bailey in London imposed a death sentence he would traditionally don a black cap and print the Latin abbreviation sus per coll next to the name of the recently condemned. Suspendatur per collum, let him be hanged by the neck.2 In Hawthorne’s tale, it is the gallows’ threatened destruction that draws the greatest interest from the surrounding crowd. At the foot of the fire, Hawthorne stages a debate. “Stay, my brethren!” a particularly bold defender of capital punishment cries out at the sight of the gallows in peril. “The gallows is a heaven-oriented instrument!” the man warns, “Bear it back, then, reverently, and set it up in its old place; else the world will fall to speedy ruin and desolation!” In reply, a “leader in the reform” commands without hesitation, “Onward, onward! . . . Into the flames with the accursed instrument of man’s bloody policy! How can human law inculcate benevolence and\n\nDeath by Hanging 31\n\nlove while it persists in setting up the gallows as its chief symbol? One heave more, good friends.”3 In the end, the reformers manage to “convince mankind of the long and deadly error of human law” and the gallows is fed to the flames. Finally, in the twenty-first century, it appears that hanging is indeed near extinction. Congress rejected it as a punishment for federal crimes in 1937 as did the army in 1986, and the vast majority of states no longer use hanging as an execution method. At the turn of the twenty-first century only four states still allowed it, and today just two states, New Hampshire and Washington, continue to permit death by hanging.4 The United States inherited its hanging technologies from England. Although the exact date is unclear, we can safely surmise that hanging was first introduced to England by the Germanic tribes who invaded the isle around the middle of the fifth century. Throughout much of its early history, hanging coexisted with other unquestionably brutal forms of execution. Hanging dates back to a time, that is, when torturous methods of execution, such as burning and boiling alive, drowning, stoning, disemboweling, drawing and quartering, and gibbeting were the norm.5 By the seventeenth century in England, hanging had replaced most of those other methods of execution. So important was it that Brian Bailey calls the noose and the cross the founding symbols of English society,6 and in Charles Duff ’s sharply satirical A Handbook on Hanging, he similarly quips, “With the English the hangman is like the dog: the friend of man.”7 Until the 1830s, hangings were the most frequent and firmly embedded rituals in English metropolitan and provincial urban life.8 Tying a rope around a man’s neck in a slipknot, passing that rope over the bough of a particularly sturdy tree, and hoisting him to the sky turned out to be an invention that would stand the test of time. That said, in the beginning, it was still considered a more disgraceful way to die than beheading or shooting.9 Until the end of the eighteenth century, the basic method of hanging remained essentially unchanged and relatively simple. In its most rudimentary form, victims “launched into eternity” from tree branches were left to die of asphyxiation caused\n\nA Clumsy, Inefficient, Inhuman Thing 32\n\nby strangulation, although disruption of oxygen and blood flow to the brain, combined with structural damage to the neck, certainly played a lethal role as well.10 Progress came slowly to the hangman’s craft. Eventually, crossbeams were manufactured to supplement the often unreliable natural structure of trees. By the twelfth century at least, although perhaps earlier, literal “hanging trees” were being replaced by manufactured uprights in some English communities.11 In what Gatrell refers to as the distinctly “medieval way” of hanging, the condemned—noose already fastened around his neck—was required to climb several rungs of a ladder placed against the gallows, at which time the hangman’s assistant would tie the rope’s far end around the crossbar and the hangman below would twist the ladder, “turning off ” the victim as he was suddenly deprived of support.12 Although ostensibly more refined, “turning off ” allowed the condemned to fall only a few inches, insufficient to cause cervical dislocation, so the principal cause of death remained slow asphyxiation. Thus, corpses were customarily not cut down for at least an hour after the drop, not only for the purposes of drama and edification but also to foreclose any possibility of recovery after “death.”13 Traveling through England in 1698, M. Mison described an execution scene at Tyburn, just outside London: They put five or six in a Cart . . . and carry them, riding backwards with the Rope about their Necks, to the fatal Tree. The Executioner stops the Cart under one of the Cross Beams of the Gibbet, and fastens to that ill-favour’d Beam one End of the Rope, while the other is round the Wretches Neck: This done, he gives the Horse a Lash with his Whip, away goes the Cart, and there swing my Gentlemen kicking in the Air: The Hangman does not give himself the Trouble to put them out of their Pain; but some of their Friends or Relations do it for them. They pull the dying Person by the Legs, and beat his Breast, to dispatch him as soon as possible.14\n\nEngland’s most primitive hanging practices were transported—along with many of its capital criminals—to the American colonies. While to-\n\nDeath by Hanging 33\n\nday we have witnessed the “virtual demise of state-sponsored hangings,” in the centuries preceding the electric chair’s introduction in the late nineteenth century, the gallows was the primary, and often exclusive, apparatus of capital death in the colonies and then in all of the United States.15 This is not to say that the art of hanging has been perfected in the United States. While the earliest American criminals were, like their English counterparts, hanged from tree branches, most colonial communities made the transition to other devices shortly after settlement. The ladder would remain the most common method of hanging, despite obvious shortcomings, until the end of the 1600s. Stuart Banner reports that a fall from the ladder was often too gradual or too short to be fatal. Removed horizontally, Banner explains, the ladder allowed prisoners to let themselves down slowly. In a particularly strange incident, Dorthy Talbye, hanged in Boston in 1639, was able to catch the ladder with her legs as she swung and break the force of her own drop. After another Massachusetts woman “was turned off and had hung a space she spake, and asked what did they mean to do.”16 The gallows cried out for reform. As Banner explains, by the beginning of the eighteenth century—although the innovation came a bit earlier in England—executions were more typically carried out by means of the horse-drawn cart. And as Mison recounted, the new method was not without its own set of irresolvable problems. In 1738, near Williamsburg, Virginia, Anthony Dittond was hanged twice by the cart. When the hangman found Dittond still alive several minutes after the initial drop, he began to pull on his legs. In this case, however, the executioner’s well-intended efforts broke the rope, and Dittond, not yet dead, crashed to the ground.17 While the cart did away with the complications caused by prisoners either unwilling or unable to climb the ladder of the medieval gallows, and while it made it possible to carry out several hangings at one time, it was still removed horizontally and at a relatively slow speed.18 What’s more, the fall was also still only a few inches. “If anything,” Gatrell remarks, “death was more prolonged than hitherto, since at least you\n\nA Clumsy, Inefficient, Inhuman Thing 34\n\ncould jump off a ladder and break your neck.”19 In other words, because it was even less likely that the condemned would “lapse into unconsciousness at rope’s end,” deployment of the cart “often extended the duration of visible suffering.”20 At this point in hanging’s history, however, technological im­ provements were intended to promote efficiency more than painlessness. The gallows was an obvious and undeniable “site of physical pain.” “[N]obody doubted,” Gatrell writes, “that hanging was a slow and painful way of killing people.”21 Kaufman-Osborn describes a number of types of recurring misadventures at Tyburn in the eighteenth century— ranging from “snapped ropes, to necks that slipped out of nooses, to decapitations, partial and total, to post-hanging revivals of the supposedly dead”—that would persist, remarkably, for centuries to come.22 Dissatisfaction with the efficacy of both ladders and carts prompted further innovation. In 1759, Tyburn’s infamous “Triple Tree” was torn down and replaced by a portable gallows outfitted with a trapdoor. Now the condemned could simply stand on a trapdoor built into the floor of a raised platform, or scaffold, until its supports were pulled away. In England, the scaffold was first used in the execution of Lord Ferrer. The drop through the trapdoor, however, failed to kill him, and the “timehonored method of pulling on his legs was employed to finish him off.” After this initial deployment, the trapdoor was abandoned for a time, not because it was ineffective but rather because, according to London mayor Sir Peter Laurie, it was “too aristocratic a mode for common vagabonds.” The basest of England’s criminal class deserved the “tortured asphyxiation” of Tyburn’s cart.23 In the American colonies, the use of the scaffold appears to have predated its first deployment in England by several decades. Boston, for example, had such a device as early as 1694. The scaffold also seems to have caught on more quickly; that is, in the United States scaffolds were already in common use by the beginning of the nineteenth century. Yet problems persisted. The force of the drop and the actual cause of death in judicial hangings remained impossible to predict or control. Ropes ripped apart as\n\nDeath by Hanging 35\n\nprisoners lurched abruptly downward, and drops were often too short to kill. Even more frequently, the condemned continued to die hard upon the scaffold. Before the introduction of the long drop in the latter part of the nineteenth century, “the agony of slow suffocation without loss of consciousness could last up to twenty minutes.”24 In 1774, Doctor Alexander Monro, a professor of anatomy at Edinburgh, likewise wrote that “the man who is hanged suffers a great deal; that he is not at once stupefied by the shock . . . a man is suffocated by hanging in a rope just as by having his respiration stopped by having a pillow pressed on the face.”25 By the late eighteenth century, capital punishment became the subject of extensive public conflict in England. In 1783, hangings were moved from Tyburn to a more controlled site just outside the walls of Newgate prison, and it became the custom to drape a white hood over the head of the condemned as he stood on the scaffold. The famed twentieth-century hangman, Albert Pierrepoint, would later claim that the hood was adopted to “mask the contortions of slow strangulation, which were considered too horrible even for the ghoulish British public to witness.”26 Thus, even in this small innovation, it is quite clear that mounting apprehensions about the sanctity of the noose were focused not on the “agony of slow suffocation” suffered by the condemned, but rather on the effect of the sight of that pain on spectators crowded before the scaffold. As the eighteenth century came to a close, calls for reform—both for a decrease in the number of crimes punishable by death and for total abandonment of the gallows—reached unprecedented volumes. And “[n]owhere,” American cultural historian Louis Masur writes, “was the debate over the death penalty and the drive to find alternative punishments more compelling than in the United States.”27 Kathryn Preyer explains, “It was easy in America to identify reason and humanity, the watchwords of the Enlightenment, with the successful republicanism of the new nation,” and consequently, “to find imprisonment the ideal embodiment of these new goals.”28 Reform of capital punishment was understood by some to be a mark\n\nA Clumsy, Inefficient, Inhuman Thing 36\n\nof the new nation’s progress. Benjamin Rush, a prominent physician and signer of the Declaration of Independence, became the first great spokesperson for the anti-gallows movement in the United States when he gave an address in 1787 advocating the total abolition of capital punishment.29 Then, borrowing from Cesare di Beccaria’s renowned essay On Crimes and Punishments, Rush responded to critics in 1792 with his Considerations on the Injustice and Impolicy of Punishing Murder by Death. Rush’s treatises exemplify—in their strong religious undertones and emphasis on the incongruity of capital punishment with the ideals of republican government—the fact that the antebellum critics of the American death penalty were not primarily concerned with the welfare of the condemned. On the contrary, “arguments against capital punishment centered on the corrupting example of public hangings and on the social guilt of depriving an individual of his inalienable right to live.”30 Rush was not worried about the potential cruelty of hanging—or of the penitentiary for that matter. Capital punishment, he claimed, “lessens the horror of taking away human life and thereby tends to multiply murders.”31 The reform impulse was driven by concern for the “ghoulish public” and their new republican state. The persons killed by that state—the thousands of criminal bodies struggling at the end of the rope—remained, for the most part, absent subjects in the escalating debate. Furthermore, with no alternative method of execution in prospect, problematizing the “black, giant-like” gallows necessarily meant critiquing the very institution of capital punishment.32 Banner notes that the small number of capital offenses relative to the English criminal code became a “point of pride” for Americans in the late eighteenth century.33 After stalling in the first decades of the new century, the spirit of reform peaked from the 1830s through the early 1850s as social organizations such as New York’s and Massachusetts’s Societies for the Abolition of Capital Punishment were formed.34 In the North, state after state decapitalized lesser felonies like rape, burglary, and arson, while no state added to its list of capital crimes. By the mid-1850s, three states—Mich-\n\nDeath by Hanging 37\n\nigan in 1847, Rhode Island in 1851, and Wisconsin in 1853—had abolished the death penalty.35 Significantly more successful than efforts to abolish capital punishment completely, however, were legal reforms that relocated the gallows. To take but one example, the hanging of John Lechler on October 15, 1822, triggered the Pennsylvania legislature’s initial interest in ending public hangings. This interest arose, however, not because the hanging itself was botched. Rather, the editor of the Yorktown Gazette reported that “What has taken place at Lancaster would lead one to believe that the spectacle of public execution produces less reformation than criminal propensity.”36 Somewhere between fifteen and forty thousand spectators gathered to watch Lechler die on the gallows at Lancaster common. Until the late nineteenth century, hangings were conducted before crowds numbering in the thousands, as part of a larger ritual which included a procession from the jail to the gallows, a sermon, and usually a speech by the condemned.37 As the burglar Levi Ames is supposed to have said on the morning of his execution in 1773, dramatic spectacle was the objective: Ah! what a Spectacle I soon shall be A Corps suspended from you shameful Tree.38\n\nBy the 1820s, critics began to see public hangings as “festivals of disorder” that, as Rush had warned, “subverted morals, increased crimes, excited sympathy with the criminal, and wasted time.”39 Crowds drawn to the gallows, larger than crowds gathered for any other purpose, threatened public order. These early charges of barbarism were not directed at hanging per se, “but at the crowds whose attendance was now construed not as the assertion of a collective political right, but as the expression of an unseemly appetite for sordid amusement.”40 An 1835 New York committee report described spectators as “that class of citizens whose reason is to be convinced, or whose animal feelings are to be excited.”41 One month after the report was published, New York abolished public hanging. The legislatures of Connecticut, in 1830, and of Pennsylvania, in\n\nA Clumsy, Inefficient, Inhuman Thing 38\n\n1834, also ended public hangings.42 By 1845, all the states in the New England and Mid-Atlantic regions had eliminated public executions in favor of quasi-private hangings.43 Throughout the nineteenth century, legislatures around the country followed suit in taking hanging day away from the public. As the country edged towards civil war, the movement to abolish the death penalty itself faded. Barton summarizes the situation of the anti-gallows movement in the late 1850s: “Largely due to the impending Civil War, however, the inevitable violence associated with the effort to abolish slavery, a movement with which the reformation of capital punishment was intimately connected, death penalty abolitionism lost its momentum, not fully to return to the public spotlight until the turn of the twentieth century.”44 With war raging between North and South, Martin Bovee expressed a shared abolitionist sentiment: “It is useless to talk of saving life when we are killing by the thousands.”45 And yet, from midcentury on, the privatization of judicial hangings was accompanied by technological innovation in both England and the United States. Hanged at Newgate in 1868, Fenian Michael Barrett died after repeated convulsions, his “protruding tongue and swollen distorted features discernible under the thin white cotton covering, as if they were part of some hideous masquerading.”46 The privatization of executions did not put an end to the potentially preventable, and thus suddenly problematic, painful death by asphyxiation at the gallows. By then, technological change and the general advancement of knowledge in the medical sciences made it possible to minimize human pain and suffering. And so officials began tinkering once again with the design of the gallows and the techniques of the drop.\n\nOn the Search for More Efficient Methods of Hanging An early nineteenth-century innovation was the “upright jerker.” This technology, unique to the United States, used a pulley system in which weights fixed at the end of the rope were released by officials, to jerk the condemned up into the air rather than dropping him as\n\nDeath by Hanging 39\n\nwas done in other methods of hanging. The upright jerker was engineered to guarantee the sudden application of a force to the neck greater than that supplied by the weight of the prisoner alone. Local officials in counties across the country, searching for a surer means of conducting painless hangings, adopted the new device. While the upright jerker was already the standard gallows used in New York City by 1845, it spread more gradually to other regions over the next three decades.47 Despite its intermittent popularity, it never fulfilled its promise of quick and painless execution. Rather, inexperienced executioners continued to struggle with procedure, and far too often the device simply failed to sever the spinal cord, leaving prisoners to die by slow asphyxiation. Critics began to long for the return of the old-fashioned, yet “more certain and humane method of the ‘drop.’”48 The most important technical improvement of the period was the invention of what eventually came to be known as the “long drop,” that is, a fall whose explicit purpose was “to cause a quicker death by dislocating the uppermost cervical vertebrae, thereby separating the spinal cord from the brain stem.”49 The long drop, in other words, was designed to ensure death by the elusive “hangman’s fracture,” rather than by strangulation.50 Its basic engineering rationale was similar to that of the upright jerker: a longer drop would allow the condemned to fall at a greater velocity and thus generate a greater force on the neck. In Ireland, where the technique was first employed, drops typically ranged from ten to seventeen feet; unfortunately, such lengths tended to hasten death by causing decapitation rather than cervical dislocation.51 The trial and error efforts of William Marwood, who served as Great Britain’s executioner from 1874 to 1883, are credited with the “perfection” of the long drop method. He experimented with various locations for the knot (occipital, subaural, and submental) and worked to calculate the optimal distance of the drop with more precision. His tireless experimentations, in turn, would ultimately drive the conception of the mathematical table discussed in Chapter 1.52 Nevertheless, as the resurgence of the American reform impulse at\n\nA Clumsy, Inefficient, Inhuman Thing 40\n\nthe end of the nineteenth century would attest, disturbing uncertainties survived the supposed scientific rationalization of the noose. The standardization of drop length did not automatically eliminate the characteristic variability of death by the rope. Besides knowing the height and weight of the condemned, the hangman had to take age, physical condition, and musculature into account.53 Furthermore, in practice, the difference between a painless and an excruciating death depended on a wide range of external conditions, including rope elasticity, the position of the knot, the weather, and not least the skills of the hangman.54 As Koestler notes, “like any other operation,” the “efficacy of breaking a neck depends entirely on the skill of the surgeon.”55 In this sense, the intrinsic unpredictability of hanging was only exacerbated in the United States, where unlike in England and elsewhere in Europe, death sentences were not carried out by professional hangmen. Instead, the responsibility for executions—everything from raising the gallows, tying the noose, and pulling the lever, to the disposition of the corpse—fell to county sheriffs, who, unwilling and unable, tended to delegate these responsibilities whenever possible, often to amateurs even more incapable than themselves.56 “This diffusion of responsibility to nonprofessionals,” Banner argues, “would contribute, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, to the United States assuming the lead in developing alternatives to hanging.”57 While technological innovation slowed at the turn of the century, the duration and degree of pain, and even the cause of death, associated with judicial hanging remained essentially indeterminable. As a medical examiner from San Francisco once explained, “Hanging in itself is a very general term”; it “represents a gamut of effects upon the neck and the structures, leading to some type of neuro or cardiogenic shock.” 58 The “hangman’s fracture” has always been, and remains, incredibly rare. An early study of sixty-five hangings conducted in the United States from 1869 to 1873 reported only six complete cervical fractures a"
