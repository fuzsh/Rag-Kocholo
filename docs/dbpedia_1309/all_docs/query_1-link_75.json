        "text": "I am compiling this evolving timeline from online and published sources to better understand the flow of history in Syracuse, and how my German ancestors fit into it. I have also included county, state, national, international, German, and German-American events and their dates that interested me. I make no guarantees about the facts or dates included, as I did not research them in primary sources myself. My timeline is merely meant to be a study guide and a jumping-off point for further research.\n\n< >\n\n[1348 - Great Plague/the \"Black Death\" sweeps Europe]\n\n[1608 - Germans are among the settlers at Jamestown, Virginia]\n\n[1616 - The native Indian population of the Northeastern American coast (Massachusetts, Maine, etc.) begins to suffer a significant reduction by pandemics of smallpox, spotted fever and measles contracted from European traders and fishermen]\n\n[1618-1648 - Thirty Years' War ravages the German lands and people; the Palatinate loses 70 percent of its population]\n\n[1620 - The \"Mayflower\" brings the English Pilgrims to found Plymouth colony in what is today Massachusetts]\n\n[1626 - Peter Minuit, a Rhinelander, and director of a Dutch colony, buys the island of Manhattan from the native American Indians and establishes the settlement known as New Amsterdam (later, New York, New York). This Dutch colony includes some Germans among its settlers.[28]\n\n1654 - First white man into the area, Father Simon LeMoyne, arrives from French Canada as an ambassador of peace to the Onondagas. Visits the Indian village near present-day Brewerton.\n\n1655 - Two Jesuit priests, Father J. M. Chaumonont and Father Dablon, engaged in a mission to the Onondagas (at present-day Indian Hill on Town Road about two miles southwest of Oran in the Town of Pompey); they offer the first mass in New York State and celebrate, with a simple observance, the first Christmas in what would later be Onondaga County.\n\n1656 - Establishment by the Jesuits of a chapel and mission house (Sainte Marie de Gannentaha) overlooking the lake [Onondaga Lake, near the present site of Liverpool]. The mission house was intended to be an embassy and was meant to be a point of departure for most of the eight Jesuits who came with Frs. Chaumonot and Dablon to this site. They would depart for the main Iroquois villages in Central and Western New York State (mostly in the Onondaga, Cayuga and Seneca Nations) in late autumn and would return to Ste. Marie in the spring. Members of the mission who stayed behind at the mission house (approximately 30 in all) went about the business of creating a village in the wilderness.[7]\n\nMarch, 1658 - Mission Sainte Marie de Gannentaha is abandoned by the Jesuits in the face of imminent attack by the Mohawks. Research indicates the French were helped in their escape by the Onondagas, who had pledged to the French safe passage throughout their territory.[7]\n\n1673 - French explorer LaSalle visits the Onondaga village near present-day Brewerton.\n\n1675 - \"King Philip's War,\" a bloody conflict between the native American Indians and the colonists of southern New England, breaks out.\n\n1676 - King Philip's War in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island ends with the defeat of Metacom (King Philip), the Indian leader; some captured Indians are executed on the Boston Common; some are shipped as slaves to the West Indies. Meanwhile Bacon's Rebellion breaks out in Virginia, where Jamestown is burned.\n\n1678 - \"New Paltz,\" the first self-contained all-German settlement of colonists on North American soil is founded, on territory purchased from the Indians by Huguenot families emigrated from the Palatine (the \"Paltz Patent\").\n\n1683 - The \"Mayflower\" of German immigration: having crossed the Atlantic from London on the schooner \"Concord,\" thirteen German families from Krefeld in the Rhine Valley arrive in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and establish a home on the city's northern outskirts, later known as Germantown.\n\n1685 - The big exodus begins from the Palatinate, including the more recently-settled Huguenot refugees from France and Mennonite refugees from Switzerland (pushed out by the French against the western border and the new government of the House of Neuberg openly favoring Catholicism). Emigrants--families, friends, and neighbors--begin fleeing to North America and other destinations. Until 1720 the modern State of New York would be the preferred destination of Palatine emigrants.[32]\n\n1688 - War in the Palatinate (\"Pfälzischer Erbfolgekrieg\") begins (ends in 1697); French troops destroy villages and the castle of Heidelberg.\n\n1690 - Jacob Leisler, born in Frankfurt, is elected the first people's governor of New York and calls for the first congress of American colonies.\n\n1696 - The French attempt a return to the Onondaga territory when Canada's governor, Count de Frontenac, builds a fort there, but the Indians drive the white men back to Canada.\n\nOctober 1708-March 1709 - A devastatingly cold and harsh winter (the worst in 100 years) hits the Palatinate/Pfalz (area of today's southwest Germany), killing humans, crops, vineyards, and fruit trees.\n\n1709 - Following two wars (1689-1709) and an unbelievably hard winter in the Palatinate, one-fourth of the population (about 7,000 Palatines) emigrate (1709-1710), many to London, Ireland, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, New York, or Virginia; many pay for their passage by indentured servitude. The Palatines headed to New York establish Neuberg (today, Newburgh) on the Hudson River, and then spread north into the Mohawk Valley. They arrive as indentured servants of the British government, which paid for half their transportation and settlement costs.[28], [32]\n\n1711-1712 - About 3,000 German immigrants, settled by the British Admiralty to collect tar and pitch in the Hudson River Valley buffer-zone between the British settlements and the Indians, are cheated and starved by Indian agent Robert Livingston, and revolt.\n\n1734 - John Peter Zenger, owner of the New York Weekly Journal, establishes freedom of the press in America when he protests British rule.\n\n1745 - An estimated 45,000 Germans now live in Pennsylvania.[28] Moravian missionaries Bishop Spangenberg and David Zeisberger visit the Onondaga Indians (about one mile south of present-day Syracuse on NY State Route 11); they return in 1750, 1752, 1753, 1754, and 1766.\n\n1749 - The death toll of German emigrants heading for just one city, Philadelphia, totaled 2,000 during this year, reflecting both the mortal dangers of crossing the ocean during this period, and the determination of Germans to immigrate.[28]\n\n1751 - An English agent, Sir William Johnson, in order to prevent the French from establishing a claim there, buys Onondaga Lake and its surrounding land to a width of two miles from the Indians. In the same year, Benjamin Franklin expressed a common fear of \"Germanization\" by asking, \"Why should the Palatine Boors be suffered to swarm into our Settlements, and by herding together establish their Language and Manners to the Exclusion of ours? Why should Pennsylvania founded by Englishmen suffer to become a colony of foreigners, who shortly will be so numerous as to Germanize us instead of our Anglifying them?\"[32] (Of course, all immigrants to the colonies arrived on soley aboard British ships during this period.)\n\n10 September 1753 - Sir William Johnson, British head of Indian affairs in the North, hears grievances of Mohawk chief King Hendrick at Onondaga, NY: \"We are so hemmed in by you...if we find a bear in a tree, there will immediately appear an owner of the land to claim the property and hinder us from killing it, by which we live.\"\n\n1759 - The victory of the English under General Wolfe near Quebec ends the fighting between France and England and Canada becomes English.\n\n1765 - In Britain, Edmund Burke expressed the fear that Pennsylvania might become entirely German \"in language, manners and even in political inclinations.\"[32]\n\n1772 - The Baltic port city of Gdansk in Poland is seized by Prussia.\n\nJuly 1776 - First printed copy of the official Declaration of Independence appears in Heinrich Miller's Philadelphia newspaper, Pennsylvanischer Staatsbote--published in German. Congress establishes a German-American regiment of four companies.\n\n1778 - Baron von Steuben writes the first U.S. Army training manual and helps organize the U.S. Army.\n\nApril 1779 - The Battle of Onondaga Valley and the Sullivan-Clinton campaign to destroy the Onondaga camp. (The Continental Army seeks to destroy the Onondaga tribe, who had aligned with the British forces.) The Van Schaick expedition against the Onondagas landed near present-day Brewerton on 20 April.\n\n1782 - At the end of the Revolutionary War, title to the land around Onondaga Lake reverted from the English to the Indians and was subsequently purchased by New York State. A military tract of 1 million acres, including the present counties of Onondaga, Seneca, Cayuga, Cortland, and parts of Oswego, Wayne, Schuyler and Tompkins counties, was established and divided into towns and homesteads, parcels to be awarded to Revolutionary War veterans.\n\n9 February 1783 - Northern border of Onondaga County was the scene of the last hostile movement of the American troops in the Revolution. Colonel Willett and 470 men and 120 sleighs rallied at Brewerton to launch an ineffective assault on the British holding Fort Ontario.\n\n1786 - 1787 - Shays' Rebellion in Massachusetts. First white settler and Indian trader, Ephraim Webster (a Revolutionary War veteran), settles in Onondaga county. What would later become the city of Syracuse (located near the mouth of Onondaga Creek) was called Webster's Camp and Webster's Landing.\n\n1788 - Onondaga Indian Reservation established (about one mile south of present-day Syracuse). First white settlers begin arriving to take up land grants awarded to former soldiers of the Revolution.\n\n1790 - First census taken in the U.S. shows a population of 3,929,625. Most populous state is Virginia (820,000; New York state has 340,120 residents); most populous city is Philadelphia (42,000; New York City has 33,000 residents). There are 75 post offices in the United States. Naturalization Act of March 26, 1790 states that only \"free white\" persons may become citizens; also states that children automatically become U.S. citizens by the naturalization of their parent. A wife now becomes naturalized upon citizenship conferred to her husband; no separate filings are required (until 1922). \"The end of mass-immigration and the expansion to the west furthered between 1790 and 1820 a linguistic fusion of the different German dialects spoken in Pennsylvania. The result was a strikingly homogenous dialect, which in its linguistic substance was most similar to the dialect of the Palatinate (H. Kelz).\"[32],\n\n1791 - John Young (1752-1834), Revolutionary War soldier, is first settler in present-day Town of DeWitt, which at first is known as Youngsville.\n\n1792 - The new American government draws up a plan to import indentured German labor to help construct the new capital city of Washington, D.C.[28] First German settler in what would later become Onondaga County, Johannes A. Schaeffer, establishes inn and trading post in Manlius Village. Danforth Sawmill established on creek about one-half mile north of present-day Jamesville in the Town of DeWitt.\n\n1793 - The Army of the French Revolution conquers the German area west of the Rhine; the Palatine/Pfalz falls under French dominion. The Baltic port city of Gdansk becomes part of Prussia, and is now known as Danzig. Patrick McGee is the first settler in the Town of Clay (Onondaga County). Jonathan Palmer, Revolutionary War soldier, is first white settler and builds his home in the present-day Town of Lysander near Jacksonville.\n\n12 February 1793 - Fugitive Slave Act passed by U.S. Congress.\n\n1794 - Whiskey Rebellion in western Pennsylvania. First white child, \"Baron Steuben\" Schaeffer, born in Manlius. John Danforth (brother of Asa) commences the manufacture of salt at \"Salt Point\" (later known as Salina, near present-day NY State Routes 57 and 370 in Liverpool). Salt springs along the borders of Onondaga Lake would make Syracuse the first place in the United States where salt for commercial purposes was obtained other than from sea water. John Danforth had learned the technique of making salt from salt springs from the Indians, who had learned it from Father LeMoyne.\n\n5 February 1794 - \"Petition for the Establishment of Onondaga County, signed by Asa Danforth (John Danforth's brother) and 134 others of the County of Herkimer.\"\n\n5 March 1794 - Onondaga County formed from Herkimer and Tioga Counties, the twenty-first of New York State's present sixty-two counties.\n\n1795 - Naturalization Act passed by Congress in Philadelphia (29 Jan.) mandates five-year residency for citizenship.\n\n1796 - What would become the city of Syracuse was then known as Bogardus Corners. The central part of what would be Syracuse was still a dense cedar forest.\n\n1797 - Village of Liverpool (formerly known as \"Little Ireland\") is officially renamed and laid out by New York's surveyor general. Most of the inhabitants of its ten log cabins are Irish immigrants. Second German settler in the county, Conradt Busch, arrives with his family in Pompey. (Link to his genealogy.)\n\n1798 - By the Treaty of Luneville, the German Palatinate west of the Rhine legally becomes a part of France (until 1814), which institutes \"modern\" civil administrative practices in the area, including standardized vital records. In the midst of undeclared war against France, U.S. Congress passes legislation (aimed primarily at the French and the Irish): the Naturalization Act, requiring aliens to live in the United States for fourteen years (instead of five) before being naturalized, and the Alien Act, granting the President the legal right to expel any foreigner he considered \"dangerous.\" President John Adams never invoked this law. [18]\n\n1799 - \"Rebellion\" breaks out in southeastern Pennsylvania in the form of an armed uprising of German (Pennsylvania Dutch) farmers angry over the federal tax on land and the high-handed ways of federal tax collectors. Its leader, John Fries, and two others are sentenced to hang in federal court for treason. [18]\n\n1800 - President John Adams pardons John Fries and his two cohorts for having led a \"riot,\" not an insurrection. [18] National census shows population at 5.3 million, more than 30-percent increase in a decade. Virginia remains most populous state (807,557) with Pennsylvania (602,365) and New York (589,051) gaining. Onondaga County has around 885 residents, 309 of them living in Pompey Township.\n\n1801 - Thomas Jefferson's first inaugural address contains his famous reference to the United States as \"the world's best hope\" and his praise of \"wise and frugal government which shall restrain men from injuring one another, [and] shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits.\" [27] His election marks the first real change of party control of government.\n\n1802 - Congressional law changes requirements for naturalization of aliens to five years of residency in the U.S. (instead of fourteen years). Seneca Turnpike completed through the community of Onondaga Hill, which included among its dozen buildings the first Onondaga County Courthouse (built 1802). Johannes Baar, a German settler in Pompey, seeks permission from the governor to establish an academy there. John Leach, first settler in Cicero, arrives; will keep a tavern in a log house at Cicero Corners.\n\n1803 - Louisiana Purchase virtually doubles the size of the United States. What would later be the city of Syracuse consisted of \"eight frame houses, a few log cabins, a post office, and a court. Most of the 60 inhabitants were involved in salt production.\" [2]\n\n1804 - John Geddes surveys the site of future Syracuse. Summer - First Germans arrive to boil salt on the shores of Onondaga Lake (Salina/Salt Point, in what would later become Syracuse): Johann Jacob Mang, Christian Uzenbenz, and Henrich Philipp Bentz.\n\n1805 - First schoolhouse (Little Red Schoolhouse, in the town of Salina) erected.\n\n1806 - Onondaga County Medical Association organized with a membership of 22 doctors.\n\n13 October 1806 - First German child, Sophie Usenbents, born within what would later become the Syracuse city limits.\n\n1807 - Baldwinsville founded.\n\n1809 - What would become the city of Syracuse was then named Milan.\n\n1810 - Third census of the United States shows a population of 7,239,881, a jump of 36.4 percent. 153 blacks residing in Onondaga County, 41 being slaves living with white owners. German immigrants and German-Americans from Schoharie County begin to settle in Clay, which, in ten years, would become known as \"the Dutch Settlement.\"\n\n1812 - War of 1812 (War declared by Congress in June). What would become the city of Syracuse was then known as South Salina.\n\nOctober 1813 - Napoleon loses the bloody and decisive battle of Leipzig.\n\n1814 - After crossing the Rhine River, Prussian General Bluecher regains the Palatinate from France. British forces burn Washington, D.C. on 24 August, but the War of 1812 ends in December. What would someday be called Syracuse was then known as Cossit's Corners. First newspaper published there. The Halfway Tavern (four miles north of present-day Baldwinsville on NYS Route 48) becomes the stopping place for Oudiaga, Indian runner, first mail carrier between Syracuse and Oswego. (Later, up until 1834, it also becomes a stagecoach stop).\n\n26 May 1814 - First Germans in Onondaga County to become naturalized American citizens: Christian Uzenbenz/Usenbents and Heinrich P. Bentz.\n\nApril, 1815 - Eruption of the volcano Tambora on the Indonesian island of Sumbawa ejects twice the volume of material into the atmosphere as Krakatoa would in 1883, lowering the average world's temperature by almost 1 degree Celsius, and causing dramatic climate changes that would produce poor grain harvests that summer and during the following year. [26]\n\n10 August 1815 - Ga-ne-o-di-yo (Handsome Lake), who founded Gai'wiio or the Longhouse religion among the Seneca indians, dies on the reservation at Onondaga at the age of 75. He began his movement in 1800 after having a vision in which four angels commanded him to preach against alcoholic beverages and urge a return to the faith and values of the Seneca fathers and family life.\n\n1816 - Following the conference in Vienna, the Palatine/Pfalz officially becomes part of the kingdom of Bavaria, but retains the civil administration procedures instituted there by the French (civil marriage ceremonies preceding ecclesiastical ones, etc.). 1816 was also known as \"the year without summer,\" in parts of Canada, New England, and Western Europe due to significant weather-related disruptions caused by the 1815 eruption of the volcano Tambora. Killing summer frosts, hailstorms, and a radically shortened growing season resulted in widespread crop failures and food shortages (\"the last great subsistence crisis of the Western world\"). The German wheat crop failed entirely; the price of flour doubled and there were reports of famine, riots, and mass migrations. [26] The stethoscope is invented.\n\n1817 - The price of rye in Germany/Europe is three to four times normal; bakers go of business; the poor eat grass and roots; over 20,000 Germans emigrate to America, while others choose Russia and Brazil. James Monroe becomes fifth President of the United States. What would one day be the city of Syracuse was that year named Corinth.\n\n4 July 1817 - Governor De Witt Clinton breaks ground in Rome, New York today on the Erie Canal (\"Clinton's Ditch\") planned to connect the Great Lakes with New York harbor and the Atlantic (350 miles). The first segment of the canal to be constructed will run between Rome and Corinth (Syracuse).\n\n1818 - Paul Revere dies.\n\n1819 - U.S. Immigration Act requires improvements in conditions of vessels bringing immigrants to the U.S.; requires ship captains to provide customs officials with a list of immigrants describing age, sex, occupation, where they came from, and where they were going. Passengers ill with contagious diseases had to be quarantined. (The individual states carried out the provisions of this law.)\n\nThe \"panic\" (financial recession) of 1819 puts the brakes on the economic boom that followed the end of the War of 1812. Triggered by the revival of European agriculture after the end of the Napoleonic Wars, and the contraction of credit by the Second Bank of the United States (paying off its Louisiana Purchase loans), the bottom dropped out of the markets for land, cotton, and other U.S. crops, resulting in foreclosures and bank failures. Bad times would last until around 1822. [27]\n\n22 October 1819 - First boat to travel the Erie Canal makes its way from Rome to Utica.\n\n2 November 1819 - County agricultural fair held on Onondaga Hill.\n\n1820 - Congress enacts the Missouri Compromise. According to the fourth census, U.S. population is 9,638,453, excluding Indians. New York is the largest city (124,000). There are five new states and the population has increased by about 30 percent since the 1810 census. Seventy-two percent of employed Americans work in agriculture. Liverpool's first church (Methodist Episcopal, 11 members) is organized.\n\n\"The country at that time [1820] from Rome to Salina (predecessor of Syracuse) was wild. The canal pierced the wilderness at Rome only to emerge therefrom at this place. The land almost the entire distance was low, marshy, and cold. The forests, most of the distance evergreen, were deep and dank; and the advancing settlers had eschewed the region as unfit for cultivation. But the clearing for the canal let in a stretch of daylight, which enabled people to see more distinctly. The marshes were to a considerable extent drained by the canal; and to its banks, instead of the shades of the gloomy forest, [would come] the sight...of a well-settled country, smiling under the hand of well-rewarded industry.\n\n\"I lodged for a night at a miserable tavern, thronged by a company of salt-boilers from Salina, forming a group of about as rough-looking specimens of humanity as I had ever seen. Their wild visages, beards thick and long, and matted hair, even now rise up in the dark, distant and picturesque perspective about me. I passed a restless night disturbed by strange fancies...The few houses...standing upon low and almost marshy ground, and surrounded by trees and entangled thickets, presented a very uninviting scene. 'Mr. Forman,' said I, 'do you call this a village? It would make an owl weep to fly over it.' 'Never mind,' said he in reply, 'you will live to see it a city yet.'\" [Hungerford, Pathway of Empire, p. 124]\n\n21 April 1820 - First Erie Canal boat (the \"Montezuma,\" towed by galloping horses) arrives in the town that would later be known as Syracuse.\n\n1822 - Joshua Foreman sponsors a bill in the New York legislature to lower Onondaga Lake two feet, thus draining the water from what is today downtown Syracuse and eliminating much of the swamp there. First church (Presbyterian, on the northwest corner of Washington Park) built in Syracuse.\n\n1824 - Syracuse receives its rightful name. Baptists erected their first church there at W. Genesee and Franklin Streets. First schoolhouse built in Town of Cicero (District No. 1), about one-half mile south of present-day Brewerton.\n\n1825 - John Quincy Adams becomes the sixth President of the U.S. The Erie Canal is completed \"from Albany to Buffalo.\" Lafayette, the 67-year-old French Revolutionary War hero, visits Onondaga County on his year-long tour of America.\n\n13 April 1825 - Syracuse incorporated as a village in the town of Salina, has a population of about 500.\n\n1826 - Thomas Jefferson and John Adams both die on the Fourth of July, the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence. St. Paul's Episcopal Church constructed in Syracuse. Syracuse village acquires a steam fire-pump with hoses and appoints a captain (Thomas B. Heermans) of a volunteer fire brigade company of 35 men.\n\n1827 - The \"friction match\" is invented by English chemist John Walker. Slavery is officially abolished in New York State; 10,000 slaves are freed. Onondaga County Poor Farm established [photo; info].\n\n1828 - The Oswego Canal opens from Syracuse, offering direct access to Lake Ontario and international shipping. Liverpool becomes a trading point, with many of its residents entering the boating and boat repair business.\n\n1829 - Andrew Jackson becomes the seventh President of the United States. County courthouse moved from Onondaga Hill to Ash & North Salina Streets, a midpoint between Salina and Syracuse (which were nearly equal in population; population of the village of Syracuse had swelled to 2,500 thanks to the canals). First Catholic church in the area erected on North Salina Street by Irish and German Catholics.\n\n1830 - U.S. census population that year is 12,866,020, including 150,000 immigrants arrived since 1820. Latter Day Saints (Mormon) Church is organized. First hospital facility within the present boundaries of Syracuse is built beside the canal in Geddes (today Erie Blvd. West & W. Genesee St.): Dr. Cyrus Thompson's Botanic Infirmary. Comprised of 50 houses, Liverpool incorporates.\n\n12 October 1831 - First state railroad convention held in The Syracuse House (hotel).\n\n1832 - An electromagnetic telegraph is created in Germany by Baron Schilling von Canstedt. Louisa May Alcott is born.\n\n23 January 1832 - A second volunteer fire-brigade company is organized in Syracuse.\n\nMay 1832 - A milestone in German history, the Hambacher Fest is held in the Palatinate. It is the \"first voluntary mass demonstration in German history.\" The main demands of the meeting (disguised as a non-political county fair) were liberty, civil rights and national unity. Afterwards many participants and sympathizers emigrated.[32]\n\n23 June 1832 - Syracuse divided into four wards.\n\nJune - July, 1832 - Cholera epidemic results in about 100 deaths in Syracuse and Salina.\n\n1833 - The first coeducational college, Oberlin, is founded in the U.S. Yosemite Valley is discovered in California. Georg Kolb, a journalist from Speyer, Germany, writes: \"An emigration from [the Palatinate] to America already took place earlier but most of the time it was a phenomenon of individuals of the mostly poor who did not know how to support themselves. But now there is a change. Well-to-do, wealthy, and even rich people left their fatherland in masses. They did not have to dissipate any worries over food, they did not flee because of a pursuit by their inner judge; the bitter pain which was expressed in view of the loss of their dear fatherland could not stop them, they faced the terrible cholera right away, but -- they rushed towards the land of Freedom that should take the place which the former Palatinate could hold no longer.\"\n\n9 November 1833 - \"Immanuel's Church of the Town of Clay\" is incorporated; their church building, completed the previous year, was the first established by Germans in Onondaga County.\n\n1834 - Richest man in the U.S. is John Jacob Astor, German immigrant, who had established the American Fur Company. The German-language newspaper, the New Yorker Staatszeitung, (still in existence today) begins publication; Gustav Adolph Newmann is its first editor. Village of Syracuse's population about 3,800. Most of Syracuse's business district is leveled by a fire along the Erie Canal. Cholera again strikes the village in July.\n\nHere is a travelogue written by Miss Caroline Hall of Milton, Vermont,[33] describing her trip from Schenectady to Ohio via the Erie Canal to visit relatives in June of 1834:\n\nOn Tuesday evening at 8 o'clock went on board a canal boat, which we called home. We passed through many flourishing and handsome villages, some of them very romantic, the Village of Little Falls, for instance. It is entirely surrounded by mountains, and contains three or four houses of public worship. Here the canal is cut through a solid rock upon one side for a mile and a half and the Mohawk River on the other. The canal is fifty or sixty feet higher than the river, and a wall is built upon the bank that height. It is a great curiosity. We were deprived of the privilege of seeing Utica, having passed it in the night. The country for sixty miles beyond Utica is unpleasant; being very low and marshy, and filled with swamps. Every six, eight or ten miles a little village has sprung up within a few years.\n\nAfter passing Montezuma we entered a large marsh three miles in width, over which a bridge is erected for the horses to pass over. This place has the appearance of a pond or creek. The next large town we entered was Syracuse. Here was grandeur itself. It was just at sunset when we entered this place. The scenery was beautiful beyond description. Each side of the canal is lined with lofty buildings from three to four stories high. There the Oswego Canal intersects the Erie. One mile and a half north are the salt works of Salinas. Here the country begins to assume a handsome appearance. On Saturday morning we entered the city of Rochester. Spent the whole day and had an opportunity of walking about the streets and seeing a good part of the city. It is said to contain 15,000 inhabitants. It was certainly the largest city I ever was in. Here every stranger that arrives visits Genesee Falls. Of course I did. These falls are rendered doubly interesting from the fact that Sam Patch made his last leap here. I was shown the place from whence he jumped, and thought what a preposterous being was man. The water falls the distance of ninety feet perpendicular, and forms a most beautiful rainbow. The falls are of a circular form. The river is perhaps a hundred rods in width. There are eleven places of public worship, and another elegant building called The Arcade.\n\nWe left Rochester 7 o'clock and Sunday night at the same hour entered Lockport. Here I suppose is one of the greatest works of art that perhaps is in the United States or in the world. Half a mile below the village the canal is dug between two high hills till we get to the locks. Here we rise sixty feet from one lock into another in the space of ten rods. We walked all over this place, for we were almost afraid of staying in the boat for fear of its being filled with water. But I suppose there was no danger, as the boat went through without any difficulty. Here the canal is cut through a solid rock for three miles, being just wide enough for boats to pass. The wall on each side is twenty or thirty feet high. I stood upon deck a good part of the time in going through this place, for I thought it a great curiosity and I was resolved to see all that was worth seeing.\n\nMonday morning at sunrise we found ourselves on the bank of Niagara River opposite Grand Island. In a short time we came to Black Rock, a pretty little village opposite Fort Erie in Canada. The river here has the appearance of a lake. Going three miles further we entered Buffalo, the great emporium of the west. We were glad to leave the canal, for it is a dirty place as I ever saw, but the accommodations are very good. We stopped in Buffalo about two hours, waiting for the steam boat. This place commands the handsomest prospect from the lake I ever beheld. At nine o'clock we left the harbor, and for the first time had a view of Lake Erie. It is the most beautiful expanse of water imaginable, of a palish green color, and as the sun shone on it gave it the appearance of so many rainbows. It was a perfect calm in the forenoon, and the scenery was almost enchanting. We went upon the upper deck where we could have a view of Canada, Niagara River and New York State on the south. The lake grows wider as we leave the harbor, and we had a full and perfect view of the whole city as far as the eye could reach. In ten and a half hours from the time we left Buffalo we landed at Conneaut in Ohio, a distance of one hundred and twenty miles at the rate of thirteen miles per hour. . . .\n\n1835 - Fire in New York City's financial district consumes 674 buildings and plunges the nation into a depression.

Competition is now keen among the railroads, canal packet boats, and stagecoach lines for the favor of the traveling public.\n\n\"Syracuse in 1839...was still a village. Humpback bridges riding high above the canal stood out sharply at crossings over Clinton, Salina, and Warren Streets. The hub of the town was the junction of East Genesee and Salina Streets, the spot which for years was referred to as \"Bogardes Corners.\" Clinton Square, north of the canal, was the farmers' market. It is said that even from across the canal one could hear the pigs squealing and the sheep bleating. On the south side, facing the canal, was Water Street, which had a row of stores that catered to the carriage trade.\n\n\"Business centered around Bogardes Corners. On the southeast corner stood the town's popular tavern, the Syracuse House. This was the terminal for the stagecoaches, where the leading citizens and politicians often met for talk and refreshment.\n\n\"The first block on South Salina Street had a few brick business buildings, but farther down the street one could see the steeple of the First Presbyterian Church rising above the one-and-a-half-story white houses which lined both sides of Salina Street from Washington Street south to Jefferson Street. That block and Water Street, where the leading stores stood, had recently been paved with cobblestones. All the other streets were ordinary dirt roads. Occasionally one would see a stray farm animal wander across the streets....\n\n\"Salina was then, as it is now, the main street. It was the only road that went all the way from the town of Salina in the north, through the village of Syracuse, and on to Onondaga Valley in the south. On the north side of the canal there were a few stores and businesses. The first block of James Street was full of taverns. Farther up the hill, James Street had begun to take on the character of a beautiful residential area.\n\n\"Besides Salina Street, the two principal streets running north and south which were important to the village were Warren and Clinton Streets. These contained the blacksmith shops, the carriage and harness makers' establishments, the livery stables, and more of the one-and-a-half-story wood frame houses....\n\n\"The Erie Canal (which had taken almost twenty years to build) was now completed all the way from Albany to Buffalo. Syracuse, halfway between the two cities, was about to benefit greatly from the trade generated....\n\n\"Beyond Division Street on the north was the village of Salina....The salt industry required many laborers, most of whom were crude and rude but had money to spend. They frequently came to the adjoining village of Syracuse to patronize the saloons on lower James Street, and the popular name for that block became 'Robber's Row.' They also often stopped to trade at the stores on the north side of the canal, and it was there that many of our Jewish immigrants opened their small dry goods and clothing stores.\" Rudolph [25]\n\n1840 - U.S. census population is 17,069,453, including 600,000 immigrants since 1830; New York is the most populous state (2.4 million, up 500,000).

Hanchett of Syracuse invents an early version of the adjustable dentist's chair.\n\n\"A city it now is [1840], in extent, and the magnitude and durability of its buildings, albeit it may not boast of a mayor and common council to oppress the people by insupportable assessments, and partake of turtle and champagne for the benefit of the poor. But as I glanced upwards and around, upon splendid hotels, and rows of massive buildings in all directions, and the lofty spires of churches and well-built streets, thronged with people full of life and activity--the canal basins crowded with boats lading and unlading at the large and lofty stone warehouses upon the wharves--the change [since 1820] seemed like of enchantment.\"\n\n...The canal passed through its very heart, with the chief buildings of the place--the courthouse, the theater, the famed Syracuse Hotel, the banks--ranged round a long open plaza, down the middle of which the busy Erie squarely ran.... By 1840, the railroad had found its way into the town, from the east and west, had placed its rails down the center of a street closely parallel to the canal and had taken Vanderbilt Square for its first station. The spreading trainshed of Syracuse's depot spanned the square...

The progress and failure of the revolution and its figures are followed closely in the German-American press; revolutionary clubs spring up and funds are raised by the U.S. German communities and sent to support the revolution and, in its aftermath, its victims. [21] Included among the refugees is Carl Schurz, who would become a Civil War general, U.S. Secretary of the Interior (1877-1881), a senator from Missouri, and Ambassador to Spain.\n\nApril 1848 - Syracuse public school system established; Hiram Putnam first president of the Board of Education.\n\nOctober 1848 - Samsel's German Brass Band starts providing music for Syracuse area events.\n\n1849 - Zachary Taylor becomes the 12th President of the U.S. Edgar Allan Poe dies.

We were actually suffering from hunger.\"* Syracuse streets are illuminated by gas lights.

[29] When the Reverend Jermain Loguen of Syracuse is urged to flee to Canada (see 1841 above), he refuses to leave his home in Syracuse and proclaims his defiance from pulpits throughout Central New York. \"The question is with you,\" he tells Syracusans at a rally that spawns a local anti-slavery Vigilance Committee. \"If you will give us up, say so, and we will shake the dust from our feet and leave you. But we believe better things. Whatever may be your decision, my ground is taken....I will not live a slave, and if force is employed to reenslave me, I shall make preparations to meet the crisis as becomes a man.\" The mayor of Syracuse declares the town an \"open city\" for fugitive slaves.

May), driven out of its usual meeting place in New York City, convenes in Syracuse. More anti-slavery conventions would follow and the city would gain notoriety as an abolition stronghold and station on the \"Underground Railroad.\" (\"We must trample this infamous law [the 1850 Fugitive Slave law] underfoot, be the consequences what they may,\" Unitarian minister Samuel J. May tells his Syracuse congregation. \"It is not for you to choose whether you will or not obey such a law as this. You are as much under obligation not to obey it, as you are not to lie, steal, or commit murder.\" [29])\n\n11 July 1851 - The State of New York passes a law prohibiting the landing of immigrants having less than $20 in their possession.\n\n1 October 1851 - The rescue of the \"fugitive slave\" \"Jerry\" (William Henry, who worked as a cooper in Morrell's barrel-making shop) from the custody of the U.S. Marshal by a large crowd of abolitionists and other indignant Syracuse citizens (and his successful escape to Canada with their help) would become a national event and is still commemorated today as what was arguably Syracuse's \"finest hour.\" See the German viewpoint of this event.\n\n1852 - Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel, Uncle Tom's Cabin is published.

At least one family ended up in Syracuse. Possibly others?\n\nExcerpt from a letter written back to Germany in late 1852 by Philipp Sax II, who emigrated from Viernheim to Syracuse with his wife and seven children: My heart aches sometime when I notice that my wife Anna is quietly crying, pining for the home land, friends, and relatives. Home sickness tortures ones soul but I think time will be a great healer [Syracuse is a] very important commercial center and its geographical location is very propitious. The great Erie Canal, that permits large canal boats to navigate between the immense Erie Lake and New York, runs right through the city .[there are also] inexhaustible salt springs around Onondaga Lake .Everyone can find a job here .You can see that although we are in a strange land, we are among Germans, our own people.

Well, dear friend, that is a difficult question to answer because not everyone who comes to America finds his fortune. Many get into dire need and misery. You will find here as many poor people who are in want as you do in Germany. Then too, it is not an easy undertaking for a family man to come to a foreign land where he is not familiar with the language, which of course, adds to the difficulty. Many are then disallusioned [sic] and damn this country.\n\nIt is true that the outlook for a better life is better here than it is in Germany, but to say that one finds money in the street is not true. The times for the workers here are not the best, because in most cities there is an overabundance of workers. One tries to displace the other and by doing so they depress the wages. Also, a worker must work more vigorously than in Germany. Here you have no breakfast break, nor a vesper bread pause. Here you work right through. Living costs are much higher here than where you are.\n\nIf you judge American conditions according to the behavior of people who come to Germany from America, you would be disillusioned. The true economic condition of these people you do not know, because the people are only boasting. Many possess only a few dollars above the cost of the fare and this is their entire wealth.\n\nIn regard to ourselves, although we are not rich, we enjoy, thank God, an adequate living standard. What is wrong here is the immense haughtiness of the people and their mad pursuit for fancy attire. Many of our young girls you would, if you could see them in the streets, in fancy clothes and bedecked with jewelry, take them for daughters of millionaires. Most of them are only daughters of poor people employed as maids and store clerks....\n\nThe population of our city is 81,000. It contains 4,000 business establishments. It has 433 streets, 41 schools, 61 churches and every week there appear 29 newspapers. All in all, Syracuse is a nice city.\n\nDecember 1889 - Scribner's magazine runs \"How the Other Half Lives,\" a shocking photographic essay by Jacob Riis concerning the squalid living conditions of immigrants in New York City.\n\n1890 - Kaiser Wilhelm II fires Otto von Bismarck as chief minister.
