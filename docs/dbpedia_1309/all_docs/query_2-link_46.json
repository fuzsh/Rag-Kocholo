        "text": "Construction and functional screening of ruminal metagenomic libraries\n\nRuminal liquid was harvested as described in Appendix S1 and used for in vitro microbial enrichment with PCS, PSCS and OL as a source of carbon and energy. The hemicellulose content of PCS was 3.5 g 100 g−1 dry matter, whereas for PSCS and OL, the hemicellulose content was around 15 g 100 g−1 dry matter (see Table S1). After 72 h at 39 °C, we observed a significant increase in turbidity of the cultures; then, cells were harvested by centrifugation and DNA was extracted from cell pellets. This DNA was used to construct functional metagenomic libraries in pCCFOS 1. The resulting titres of the libraries were 3.0 × 107 CFUs ml−1 for the PSCS library; 2.3 × 107 CFUs ml−1 for the PCS library; and 3.3 × 107 CFUs ml−1 for the OL library. Digestions of a number of randomly chosen fosmids with BamHI revealed that the restriction patterns of these clones were different, confirming that these libraries contained reasonably good DNA diversity (not shown). On average, each fosmid had an insert of about 42 kb. To ensure identification of different hemicellulases, more than 50 000 colonies per library were assayed. We found 22 clones with endoxylanase activity and 125 with β‐xylosidase activity (Table ); this indicated that the rate of recovery of hemicellulases was in the range of 1 in 0.5 Mb, much higher than in other reports in which hemicellulases hits were in the range of 1 in 8 Mb or more (Gao et al., 2011; Nguyen et al., 2012). We consider that our high rate of success was due to the specific enrichment of rumen microbes that used industrial substrates rich in hemicellulose as a carbon and energy source. It should also be noted that the number of hemicellulase positive clones was higher in OL and PSCS libraries than in the PCS library (Table )— a finding that is expected given the higher hemicellulose content of OL and PSCS compared to PCS. Therefore, the combination of both in vitro enrichment of rumen microorganisms with industrial substrates and functional assays to identify enzymes with potential for use in biotechnological applications enhances the chances of success.\n\nFosmid DNA from the 147 clones was sequenced en masse, and the resulting sequences were subjected to BLAST analysis to identify hemicellulases. This approach provided very few known hemicellulases. To ensure that we were not overlooking novel hemicellulases, we BLAST searched for glycosyl hydrolase GH domains. The search revealed the presence of domains corresponding to (GH) from families 1, 5, 8, 11, 14 and 43, confirming the presence of the expected catalytic activities (Zhou et al., 2012; Zimbardi et al., 2013), although the overall identity of these sequences at the protein level was on average below 48%. BLAST analysis of the identified domains revealed certain homology with hemicellulases of microorganisms of the rumen or from anaerobic environments that is Bryantella, Lachnospiraceae, Butyrivibrio, Fibrobacter, Prevotella, Saccharophages and uncultured microbes (Hulo et al., 2006).\n\nThe positive clones were grown individually in multiwell plates, and the culture supernatants were analysed for either xylanase or β‐xylosidase activity. In the assay for endoxylanase, we used Azo‐wheat‐arabinoxylan as a substrate while in the assay for β‐xylosidase, we use p‐nitrophenyl‐β‐D‐xylopyranoside as a substrate; the assays were run under the conditions described in the experimental procedures with pH varying half a unit between 4.0 and 7.0 and temperatures varying 5°C between 30 and 70°C. We retained clones that were active in the pH range of 4–5.5 and temperatures over 50°C because we were searching for enzymes that could supplement cellulase‐rich fungal enzymatic cocktails that work optimally in these ranges of pH and temperatures. With these restrictions, six endoxylanase and six β‐xylosidase clones were kept for further assays.\n\nThe 12 positive clones were grown in 20 mL LB medium with chloramphenicol until they reached the stationary phase, and supernatants were then used for quantitative assays. The assays were run with the above substrates and at different pH and temperatures as above. We found that clones C5 and C20 had a xylanase activity that was at least twofold higher than that of the other four. Of these, clone C5 was superior to C20 at all pHs tested and optimal temperature was about 50 °C, being notorious that > 95% of the maximal activity was recorded in the range between 5 and 7 (Table ). Optimal temperature was found at 50 °C, but 70% of the activity was recorded at 60 °C and near 25% activity at 70 °C. For this reason, we chose clone C5 as a source of endoxylanase for further assays (see below).\n\nOur first attempt to determine the optimal conditions for pH and temperature of the β‐xylosidase clones showed relatively low activity. The presence of β‐xylosidase in the secretome was confirmed in zymogram assays. Figure S1 depicts the zymogram in which concentrated protein is clearly visible as a single band for a few clones. As the positive clones were selected in assays run on microtitre plates, we hypothesized that oxygen levels in the test tube assay may be affecting results. To test whether this was the case, we repeated the assays under air atmosphere and under strict anaerobic conditions and found that β‐xylosidase activity was lower in the presence of oxygen. Our results revealed that clones C92 and C104 had the highest activity (Table S2 and Table ). Fosmid DNA digestion pattern of C92 and C104 was almost identical, and we chose clone C104 for further analysis.\n\nFirst, we sequenced the selected fosmid clones (xylanase C5 and β‐xylosidase C104). Sequence analysis of fosmid C5 revealed an insert of about 45 kb in size. BLAST analysis revealed a number of ORFs that exhibited an identity range between 34 and 98% to translated sequences of a cellulolytic bacterium present in the rumen of goats known as Fibrobacter succinogenes (Table S3). Of these sequences, we identified a putative ORF that shared 59% similarity with an Fibrobacter succinogenes endo‐1,4‐β‐xylanase (Bae et al., 1993; Fukuma et al., 2015). PROSITE analysis of this translated polypeptide identified two domains, one spanning residues 45 to 254 and another spanning residue 309 to 508, which are believed to be part of the GH family 11 (GH11) active domain (Hulo et al., 2006). GH11 is a family of mono specific enzymes that only have xylanase activity and lack of cellulase activity. Analysis of the sequence of fosmid C104 revealed an insert of about 40 kb with a long contig of 31 kb and a number of smaller contigs. BLAST analysis identified a β‐xylosidase ORF that presented 63% identity with an enzyme from Lacchnospiraceae bacterium NK4A179 (Table S3).\n\nTo further confirm that the two ORFs identified above encode an endoxylanase and a β‐xylosidase, the corresponding genes were amplified by PCR using appropriate primers (See Suporting Information), cloned into pET24b and expressed in E. coli BL21 with an N‐terminal 6× histidine tag. The recombinant proteins were purified to homogeneity, as described in Appendix S1. Overexpressed histidine‐tagged xylanase C5 protein ran as a single protein band that migrated at 66 kDa in a Coomassie‐stained gel and exhibited endoxylanase activity, with the maximum activity levels recorded at 50°C and pH 5, confirming the results obtained with the fosmids. The overexpressed histidine‐tagged β‐xylosidase C104 protein ran as a protein band that migrated at 74.6 kDa in SDS polyacrylamide gels, and its maximum specific activity was recorded at 60°C and pH 5.5."
