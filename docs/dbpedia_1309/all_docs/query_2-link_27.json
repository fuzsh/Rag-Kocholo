        "text": "Over the years, Stanford University’s incoming president, Marc Tessier-Lavigne, has developed a career that successfully melds science, business and academia.\n\nAt Rockefeller University in New York, where he is currently president, he is known not only for his fund-raising prowess, but also for directing a laboratory that specializes in studying brain development and what goes wrong in neurodegenerative brain disease.\n\nHe may be best known, though, for his work at Genentech. As the No. 2 executive in research, he oversaw 1,400 scientists in one of the most innovative and successful companies in the biotech industry, known for the groundbreaking cancer drugs Avastin, Rituxan and Herceptin.\n\nHis appointment at Stanford, announced on Thursday, follows what the university described as “an extensive, global search” to find a replacement for John L. Hennessy, who announced last year that he would be stepping down this year after 16 years as president.\n\nIn a telephone interview Friday, Dr. Tessier-Lavigne, 56, declined to identify his immediate priorities at Stanford, where he previously served on the faculty, but added, “We do have to ensure access, broadly, both in terms of access for people who are disadvantaged socioeconomically and, of course, diversity.” He said current financial aid programs at Stanford were already a huge step in ensuring access.\n\nStanford benefits greatly from its relationships in Silicon Valley and also in the biotech industry, a field in which, in addition to his executive role at Genentech, Dr. Tessier-Lavigne has been involved, at several startups.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
