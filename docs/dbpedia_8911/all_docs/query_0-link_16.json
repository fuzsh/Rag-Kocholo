        "text": "I was born in Weatherford, Texas in 1965. Graduated Weatherford High 1983, did 2 years at North Texas State Univ., 1.5 years at University of Texas at Arlington. I moved to Nashville in 1989 to try the music business. I tinted windows for a living until about 1995, when I decided to commit fully to pursuing my dream, left my job, and starved myself for about 9 months until I finally gathered enough demo work to pay bills. I always had a knack for harmony vocals, and fortunately the business was in need of someone else to do them in Nashville.\n\n************\n\nSince then I’ve sung on 156 Number One Billboard Hits, several hundred million records sold world-wide, and a few billion streams… You can scope the full list here. Music Row Magazine has named me Musician Of The Year (for Background vocals) 14 times. I’ve also been touring as a member of George Strait’s Ace in the Hole band since 1999 (on and off)…\n\n************\n\nMy heroes are John Wesley Ryles, Curtis Young, Dennis Wilson, and Don Rich. Everything I ever did singing harmonies I learned from these guys. My influences go farther back, but my education definitely came from them. I just had to listen to the greatest records made in the seventies and eighties in Nashville and those are the guys that were the backbone of all the recordings.\n\n*********\n\nI am now focusing more on songwriting. I’ve had songs recorded by South 65, Jake Owen, Montgomery/Gentry, Gary Allan, Gene Watson, Sammy Kershaw, and Russell Hitchcock.\n\n*********\n\nI enjoy travel, good food, golf, and boating. I treasure good friends and I’m proud to have hundreds of them in Nashville. I only regret not getting to see all of them more of the time.\n\n********\n\nI credit God, Mom and Dad, Sis, and the friends I’ve made along the way for sustaining me through some very, very tough times, and celebrating with me in the great times… Thanks to all of them."
