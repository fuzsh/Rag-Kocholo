        "text": "Mike Daily (steel guitar)\n\nMike has been a member of the Texas Jamm Band since its inception and he is also one of the original founding members of the Ace in the Hole Band. Mike comes from a proud country music family tradition that originated in Houston. His grandfather – known as Pappy – discovered George Jones and recorded and produced Jones for his first years as an artist. Mike’s father Don and his uncle owned the legendary Cactus Records. Don was the first to record his son’s Ace in the Hole Band with George Strait as lead vocalist. Three of those original eight recordings can be found on the George Strait Box Set. Mike has performed with many other acts, including Rick Trevino, The Derailers, Aaron Watson, and Houston Marchman.\n\nRonnie Huckaby (piano)\n\nRonnie Huckaby was born and raised in Waco, Texas. He began playing music at the age of six and formed his first band at eleven playing country and rock music. After graduating high school, Ronnie moved to Austin, Texas to experience the exploding outlaw movement firsthand. He played locally around the Austin area until an audition with George Strait in 1983 led him to his current position as band leader and piano player for the Country music superstar. One of the highlights of Ronnie’s tenure with George Strait has been playing the presidential retreat at Camp David, Maryland for then President George H. W. Bush, First Lady Barbara Bush, and prime minister Brian Mulroney of Canada. Ronnie feels fortunate to have been on the same bill with so many of his music heroes and to have worked with many talented musicians.\n\nBenny McArthur (guitar, fiddle, vocals)\n\nBenny McArthur began playing the guitar when he was 13 years old and he picked up the fiddle in his early 20s. He played all the honky tonks and beer joints around his home town of Fort Worth until he moved to Austin in the early 1970s where he joined the Country Music Revue, considered the premier country band in Austin at the time. Later, he joined Houstonian Mundo Earwood as his guitar and fiddle player and front-man. In 1983, Benny had the opportunity to join George Strait and he has been a member of Ace in the Hole ever since. His talents are many: guitar, fiddle, vocals, songwriting, producer and studio musician. He wrote George’s hit song When it’s Christmas Time in Texas. Benny is also co-founder of the Artist Exclusive Channel which is a new subscription web site designed for independent artists and their fans.\n\nRick McRae (guitar, fiddle, vocals)\n\nRick McRae has traveled extensively for over three decades as a guitarist for George Strait’s “Ace In The Hole Band”. A versatile player in several styles, Rick also sings and doubles on fiddle and Mandolin. Rick was elected to the Texas Western Swing Hall of Fame in 2008 and has toured and recorded with many local and national acts including Don Walser, and Jason Roberts and Asleep at The Wheel. He can also be seen fronting his own groups around central Texas.\n\nTom Batts (bass guitar, vocals)\n\nTom Batts grew up in Port Lavaca, Texas, where he began in music by playing piano, saxophone, and guitar. He eventually found his niche, moving to bass guitar and singing while jamming in the rhythm section. An advocate of traditional country music, this 28-year veteran of the Texas honky-tonk circuit has played the world famous WSM Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, backed George Strait on two occasions, and recently toured with Dean Dillon on the Legends and Lyrics tour.\n\nJon Kemppainen (fiddle, vocals, guitar)\n\nJon is a fiddle player, multi-instrumentalist and vocalist originally from Chapel Hill, NC. He began playing violin at age 7 and branched out to playing a host of other instruments along the way. Jon has recorded and performed with nationally acclaimed bands such as the 90’s retro swing band, the Squirrel Nut Zippers, classic honky tonk revivalists, the Two Dollar Pistols and, more recently, Rick Trevino. He has had the great fortune to play with many of his heroes including Pete Mitchell, Bert Rivera, Red Volkaert, Cindy Cashdollar, and Johnny Cuviello who played drums with Bob Wills’ Texas Playboys. Aside from meeting Johnny Gimble for the first time, one of his greatest musical highlights was opening for Merle Haggard.\n\nBobby Jarzombek (drums)\n\nBobby was born and grew up in San Antonio, Texas. He started playing drums when he was 10 years old, joining the school band and taking lessons on the drumset. Bobby’s first love was rock music but he also began playing country music when his high school music teacher asked him to join her band. It was also during this time that Bobby would frequent music venues in the SA area to watch the late, great Mike Kennedy play. Bobby’s appreciation of and dedication to musical diversity has served him well. More than three decades into his career as a professional musician, Bobby’s résumé includes over 30 major record label recordings and U.S. and worldwide tours with artists such as Rob Halford, Sebastian Bach, Gary Stewart, Fates Warning, and many more.\n\nBobby has recently been named George Strait’s latest and current drummer!"
