It includes the stomach (with the lower part of the esophagus), small and large intestines, liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and other organs.\n\nablate [ab-late]\n\nTo remove or destroy the function of an organ or body tissue. See also ablation.\n\nablation [a-BLAY-shun]\n\nTreatment to remove or destroy all or part of a body part or tissue. Can also be used to remove or stop the function of an organ. For example, removing the ovaries or testicles or taking medicines that stop them from making hormones would be called ablation. Besides surgery and drug treatment, other ways of ablating body tissues and tumors include extreme heat, freezing, and chemicals. Also called ablative ( ab-LAY-tive) therapy.\n\nabscess [ab-SES]\n\nA collection of pus in tissues, organs, or other parts of the body.\n\nabsolute risk [ab-so-loot risk]\n\nThe likelihood a person will develop a disease (such as a type of cancer) over a certain period of time. Absolute risk is shown as a fraction or percentage. For example, in the US, the average absolute risk of a man developing colorectal cancer in his lifetime is about 4%. In other words, in a group of 100 men, about 4 will develop colorectal cancer in their lifetime.\n\nacquired mutation [uh-KWY-erd myoo-TAY-shun]\n\nA mutation (change) in DNA that starts in one cell of the body after a person is born. This mutation is then passed on to any new cells that arise from that cell. In some cases, acquired mutations can lead to cancer. This is different from inherited mutations, which are present at birth and in almost all the cells of the body. Acquired mutations are not passed on to children.\n\nactinic keratosis [ak-TIH-nik KAYR-uh-TOH-sis]\n\nA rough raised area of skin that can develop after a lot of sun exposure. They are benign (not cancer), but over time a few can develop into squamous cell cancer.

Active surveillance may be part of a treatment plan for certain types of cancers like prostate cancer.\n\nadenocarcinoma [A-deh-noh-KAR-sih-NOH-muh]\n\nCancer that starts in glandular tissue. Glandular tissue makes and secretes a substance, such as in the breast (milk) or in the gland cells of the prostate (seminal fluid).\n\nadenoma [A-deh-NOH-muh]\n\nA benign growth (not cancer) that starts in glandular tissue. Glandular tissue makes and produces a substance. For example, glandular tissue in the ducts or lobules of the breast produce milk, and the gland cells of the prostate produce seminal fluid.\n\nadenomatous polyp [ad-no-muh-tus or ad-uh-NO-muh-tus pa-lip]\n\nA benign (not cancer) growth of abnormal glandular cells. These can become cancer, so they are usually removed when found. For example, 3 types of adenomas that can grow in the colon are tubular, villous, and tuberovillous. In each type, the cells are arranged differently, but there is some overlap so that an adenoma can have both tubular and villous features. See also glandular cells, hyperplastic polyp, inflammatory polyp, polyp, tubular adenoma,villous adenoma.\n\nadhesions [ad-HEE-zhunz]\n\nScar tissue that can form after surgery or injury. If the scar tissue tightens, it may bind organs together that are normally separate. This can sometimes cause problems, for instance, if there is partial or total blockage of the intestine.\n\nadjuvant therapy [ad-juh-vunt]\n\nTreatment used in addition to the main treatment. It usually refers to hormone therapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy added after surgery to increase the chances of curing the disease or keeping it in check.\n\nadvanced cancer\n\nCancer that has spread from where it started (the primary site) to other parts of the body. When the cancer has grown outside the body part where it started but has not yet spread to other parts of the body, it is called locally advanced cancer. If it has spread to other parts of the body, it is called metastatic cancer.\n\nadvance directive\n\nA legal document that tells a person’s health care provider and loved ones his or her wishes about their health care if the person later becomes unable to make decisions for him or herself. This may include whether to start or when to stop life-sustaining treatments. Another type of advance directive lets you choose a person to make decisions for you if you become unable to do it for yourself.\n\naggressive cancer\n\nCancer that develops, grows, or spreads quickly.\n\nAJCC Staging System\n\nAmerican Joint Committee on Cancer staging system helps determine how much and where the cancer is in the body using the TNM system. T describes the tumor’s size, location, and if it has grown into nearby areas. N describes the spread of cancer to nearby lymph nodes, and M describes metastasis (the spread of cancer to distant parts of the body).\n\nallogeneic stem cell transplant [A-loh-jeh-NAY-ik]\n\nUses bone marrow or stem cells from a donor whose tissue type closely matches the patient’s to replace blood-forming cells that have been destroyed by disease or cancer treatment. This can be from a related donor or an unrelated donor. See also stem cells.\n\nalopecia [al-o-PEE-shuh]\n\nHair loss, which can include loss of scalp hair, body hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes as well as pubic hair. This often happens with chemotherapy treatment or radiation therapy. In most cases, the hair grows back after treatment ends.\n\nalpha blocker [al-fuh]\n\nA drug that relaxes smooth muscle tissue. Alpha blockers are sometimes used to help men who have trouble passing urine because of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) by improving the flow of urine and blood. See also benign prostatic hyperplasia.\n\nalternative medicine\n\nAn unproven or disproven therapy that is used instead of standard (proven) medical treatment. Some examples of alternative medicines are special diets, certain supplements or herbs, or high doses of vitamins. The American Cancer Society recommends that patients thinking about using any alternative therapy discuss it first with a member of their cancer care team. Some alternative therapies are known to cause harmful or even life-threatening side effects. With others, the main danger is that the patient may lose the chance to benefit from standard treatment. See also complementary therapy.\n\nambulatory [AM-byou-luh-tor-ee]\n\nBeing able to walk or walking. Ambulatory care centers treat outpatients, that is, people who are not staying overnight in a hospital. Short procedures or treatments are often done in such centers.\n\nAmsterdam criteria [am-STIR-dam cry-TEER-ee-uh]\n\nCriteria doctors use to identify families who might have hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC). Not all people who have HNPCC meet these criteria, but people who meet the criteria may want to consider genetic testing.\n\nanalog [an-uh-log]\n\nA substance that is similar, but not identical to another substance. For example, a man-made version of a naturally occurring substance. See also LHRH analogs.\n\nanastomosis [uh-NAS-toh-MOH-sis]\n\nA procedure in which a diseased part of a tubular body structure is removed, and the ends of healthy sections are reconnected.\n\nandrogen [AN-druh-jen]\n\nHormones found in males and females but with much higher levels in males; commonly called male sex hormones.

Each antibody can only work to destroy one certain antigen.\n\nanti-emetic [an-tee-ih-MEH-tik or an-tie-ih-MEH-tik]\n\nA drug that prevents or relieves nausea and vomiting.\n\nanti-estrogen [an-tee-ES-tro-jen or an-tie-ES-tro-jen]\n\nSomething (for example, the drug tamoxifen) that blocks cells from making estrogen. Anti-estrogens are used to treat breast cancers that depend on estrogen for growth and are being studied for use in treating other types of cancers. An anti-estrogen is a type of hormone antagonist. Also called estrogen blocker.\n\nantigen [an-tuh-jen]\n\nA foreign substance that causes the body’s immune system to respond by making antibodies. For example, the immune system responds to antigens that are part of bacteria and viruses to help people resist infections. Certain cancer cells have antigens that can be found by lab tests. The antigens can help in diagnosing those cancers and in watching response to treatment. Other cancer cell antigens play a role in immune reactions that may help the body resist cancer.\n\nantimetabolites [an-tee-muh-TAB-o-lites or an-tie-muh-TAB-o-lites]\n\nSubstances that interfere with the body’s chemical processes, such as those that create proteins, such as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and other chemicals needed for cell growth and reproduction. In treating cancer, antimetabolite drugs disrupt DNA production, which in turn prevents cell division and tumor growth.\n\nantioxidants [an-tee-OX-uh-dunts or an-tie-OX-uh-dunts]\n\nSubstances that protect cells from damage caused by the process of oxidation during metabolism. Some vitamins, such as vitamins C and E and beta-carotene are antioxidants. Antioxidants that are found in foods are thought to reduce the risk of some cancers. But taking certain antioxidants as supplements has been linked to higher cancer risk in some people.\n\nAPC gene\n\nA gene that helps keep cell growth balanced. Inherited changes in this gene can cause familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and Gardner syndrome. People who have a mutation (change) in this gene can develop hundreds of polyps in the colon.\n\napheresis [a-fur-REE-sis]\n\nA procedure that takes blood out of the body, part of the blood is removed, and the rest of the blood is infused back into the body. Called plasmapheresis if plasma is removed, leukapheresis if white blood cells are removed, or platelet pheresis when platelets are removed. Might also be called pheresis (fur-ree-sis).\n\napoptosis [a-pop-TOE-sis]\n\nProgrammed cell death.

Ataxia-telangiectasia is a rare, inherited, progressive, degenerative disease of childhood that causes loss of muscle control, a weakened immune system, and an increased risk of cancer. If this mutation is present, the carrier may have a higher risk of several types of cancer.\n\nattributable risk [at-trib-ut-a-ble risk]\n\nHow much a known factor increases the risk of a disease (such as cancer). Usually given as a percentage, it compares the percentage of people who were exposed to the risk factor and developed the disease to the percentage of people who were not exposed but developed the same disease. For example, if the attributable risk of a factor for a certain type of cancer is 80%, it means that 80% of people who developed this cancer were exposed to that factor, and 20% of people who developed the cancer were not exposed.\n\natypia [a-tip-ee-yuh]\n\nNot normal; atypical. Often refers to the appearance of cancerous or pre-cancerous cells.\n\natypical [a-tip-uh-kul]\n\nNot usual; abnormal.\n\nautologous [aw-tahl-uh-gus]\n\nUse of a person’s own blood or tissue in a medical procedure.

But the change in overall (absolute) risk would depend on what the person’s risk was to begin with. So, for example, if a person's baseline risk of a certain type of cancer is 10% (1 in 10), and a factor lowers this by half, the relative risk would be 50% lower, but the change in absolute risk would be 5% (because their overall risk went from 10% to 5%).\n\nrelative survival rate [REH-luh-tiv ser-VY-vul risk]\n\nThe percentage of people with a disease (such as a type of cancer) who are expected to be alive after a certain period of time when compared to a similar group of people who do not have the disease. Relative survival rates help account for people who die from other causes. Relative survival rates are usually given as a percentage. For instance, if the 5-year relative survival rate of a certain type of cancer is 50%, it means that people with this cancer are half (50%) as likely to still be alive 5 years after their diagnosis, as compared to people without this cancer.\n\nrem\n\nSee radiation dose.\n\nremission [re-MISH-un]\n\nA period of time when the cancer is responding to treatment or is under control.

The TNM staging system is used the most.\n\nstandard of care\n\nTreatment or care process that medical experts accept as the appropriate treatment for a disease at a certain time.\n\nstandard therapy\n\nTreatment based on studies that show that the treatment is safe and effective in one or more types of cancer or for managing side effects of treatment. Also called conventional or mainstream treatment.\n\nstatistical analysis\n\nSeries of methods used to explore and organize large amounts of data to discover patterns and trends. For example, American Cancer Society researchers use statistical analysis to identify which risk factors affect the development of cancer.\n\nstem cells\n\nCells that may mature into different types of cells. In cancer, the term usually refers to the immature blood cells (called hematopoietic stem cells) found in the bone marrow and in the blood. These stem cells can mature into all types of blood cells.\n\nstem cell transplant\n\nSee bone marrow transplant.\n\nstenosis [steh-no-sis]\n\nA narrowing (stricture) of a duct or canal.\n\nstent\n\nA very small tube or “straw-like” device put in to support and hold open a tube-shaped organ, such as a blood vessel, bile duct or intestine.\n\nstereotactic body radiation [steer-e-o-TACK-tick ]\n\nUsing stereotactic radiosurgery techniques for areas outside the brain, such as to the lung, spine or liver.\n\nstereotactic needle biopsy [steer-e-o-TACK-tick need-ul by-op-see]\n\nA type of needle biopsy that is useful when calcifications or a small mass can be seen on imaging tests but cannot be felt (such as in a breast) or tumors are in a location where surgery to remove them is risky (such as a brain tumor).
