        "text": "WACO, Texas (KWTX) - A man with arguably the best seat in the house amongst the nearly 111,000 people at George Strait’s record-breaking concert at Kyle Field in College Station June 15 says his road to being on stage with Strait as a member of his “Ace in the Hole” band all started in Waco.\n\nJohn Michael Whitby, 45, of New Braunfels, lived in Waco from the ages of two to fourteen and says it was in Central Texas he learned to love and play the piano.\n\nWhitby has been the keyboardist for George Strait for 19 years and said being a part of breaking an attendance record set by the Grateful Dead in 1977 was incredible.\n\n“It was pretty amazing getting to play especially coming from Waco, Texas. Taking piano lessons growing up, I remember a recital at Mountainview Elementary in the first grade and then taking more lessons and then seeing George for the first time at the Ferrell center,” Whitby recalled. “I think it was 1992. I was 14 years old.”\n\nWhitby was born in Austin but moved to Waco with his family, including his mom, Susan, and dad, Bill, when he was a toddler.\n\nHe attended Viking Hills Elementary, Mountainview Elementary and St. Albans in Waco.\n\nHe spent his junior high years at Lake Air Junior High before attending one year at Waco High School. His family then moved to New Braunfels.\n\nWhitby said despite his move, it was a Waco connection that would end up bringing him alongside the King of Country Music.\n\n“We moved to New Braunfels, and I started taking lessons from George’s piano player band leader, a Waco native, Ronnie Huckaby and that’s how I got into all this,” Whitby said.\n\nWhitby has had countless memories with Strait over nearly two decades, touring alongside him all over the United States and once in Europe, but he said topping the Kyle field performance will be tough.\n\n“I mean it was amazing,” Whitby said. “It’s unbelievable.”\n\nWhitby said he talked with Strait’s son, Bubba, to find out his dad’s reaction after having a few days to reflect on the show.\n\n“Talking to Bubba yesterday I said, ‘what did your dad think,” Whitby said. “That’s what I was going to ask really is after all these years, everything, about 50 years, to set that record for the most people there coming to see you and he said, ‘he can’t believe it.”\n\nWhitby said it’s a feeling he shares.\n\n“It hasn’t sunk in all the way just yet but if it’s never broken or broken again in 50 years, because it was about 50 years for The Grateful Dead. So, at least I can say that, or my kids can say that. We played for the most people, ever.”\n\nWhitby and Strait didn’t have much rest after the much talked about Texas show.\n\nThey will perform together in Salt Lake City Saturday night."
