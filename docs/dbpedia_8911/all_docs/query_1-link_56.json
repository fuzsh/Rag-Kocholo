        "text": "June 6 | Georgia Parker\n\nGeorgia Parker is a Western Swing performer from the hills of Central Texas. She holds the Ameripolitan Award for Western Swing Female of 2020, The Ameripolitan Award for Western Swing Band (Big Cedar Fever) for 2019, and the Academy of Western Artists Award for Western Swing Album (“Tumbleweeds” by Big Cedar Fever) for 2020. A Hill Country Texan through and through, her sound is of a quality and character that can only be acquired over many years of listening to country greats like Willie Nelson, Cindy Walker, and Bob Wills.\n\nJune 13 | Bill Kirchen & Too Much Fun\n\nBill Kirchen, the “Titan of the Telecaster” is a Grammy-nominated guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter. He embodies the spirit of rock ‘n’ roll, Western swing, and California honky-tonk, earning praise from Rolling Stone as “one of our best.” Kirchen’s odyssey began in Ann Arbor, where he honed his skills as a trombonist, laying the groundwork for his future mastery of the Telecaster guitar, which he now wields with undistorted, heartfelt passion. An Austinite, Kirchen’s versatility shines through his rootsy blend of blues, country, and rock, infused with high-octane energy and finesse. Having toured with acclaimed artists like Nick Lowe and Elvis Costello, his performances exemplify an unwavering commitment to entertaining and reveling in the moment. With a career spanning decades, Kirchen’s humorous and soulful approach to music captivates audiences, leaving them craving more.\n\nJune 20 | Texas Jamm Band\n\nFor over twenty years, even as members have come and gone, the Texas Jamm Band has kept its core players. The music remains the same as when the group first began filling the dance floors of dance halls, night clubs, and special events venues. To this day, fans continue to enjoy the timeless and classic sound of The Texas Jamm Band, featuring members of George Strait’s Ace in the Hole band.\n\nJune 27| Rochelle and the Sidewinders\n\nBased in Austin, Texas, Rochelle and the Sidewinders are a high-energy blues rock band that’s a local legend. Led by Rochelle, the “Texas Songbird,” this dynamic five-piece ensemble blends classic blues with rock and roll to create an irresistible sound. Known for their catchy, groove-laden tunes and electrifying live performances. They have won several awards including the Austin Blues Society’s “Heart of Texas Blues Challenge.” Rochelle’s powerful vocals and striking stage presence, backed by the tight musicianship of the Sidewinders, deliver an unforgettable experience.\n\nJuly 4 | Brave Combo\n\nTrying to describe Brave Combo’s music requires a pretty extensive vocabulary – at least when it comes to musical styles. For the past three decades the Denton, Texas based quintet has perfected a world music mix that includes salsa, meringue, rock, cumbia, conjunto, polka, zydeco, classical, cha cha, the blues and more. They are America’s Premier Dance band and a rollicking, rocking, rhythmic global journey — offering what one critic recently wrote, “Even if you come for the party, you’ll leave with something of a musical education.”\n\nJuly 11 | Matt Kirk and the Güefarers\n\nHailing from the heart of Texas, Matt Kirk and the Güeyfarers (pronounced Wayfarers) are more than just a musical group; they’re a celebration of family heritage and a fusion of diverse sounds. Led by the incomparable Matt Kirk, whose musical roots run deep thanks to his upbringing in the picturesque hill country of New Braunfels, the Güeyfarers bring a rich tapestry of influences to the stage. Matt, whose talents extend to lead vocals, guitars, mandolin, and harmonica, inherited his musical prowess from his mother, the renowned singer Sylvia Kirk. Together, they’ve lit up stages with their undeniable chemistry and soulful performances. But the magic doesn’t stop there. The Güeyfarers are a collective of some of the finest musicians in the area, each bringing their own flair to the mix. With Jimmy Hartman on bass, Brendon Custer keeping the rhythm alive on drums, and Matt Cain adding layers of melody on keys and Eric Demmer on the saxophone. Creating a sonic landscape that knows no bounds, with influences spanning folk country, blues, classic rock, Tejano, and Western Swing, their music transcends genres and transports listeners to a realm where every note tells a story. Matt Kirk and the Güeyfarers deliver an unforgettable live experience.\n\nJuly 18 | Emily Gimble\n\nPiano beckoned Emily early on – in fact, the Austin Music Awards named her “Best Keyboards” of the city three times (2013, 2014, 2018) – as did another instrument, full of natural range and feeling: her voice. “A Case of the Gimbles,” the 2005 album she recorded with her father and grandfather, showcased her vocals and launched Emily on a national family tour, playing folk festivals and charming audiences across the country.\n\n“The time I got to spend traveling around the country playing music with my Dad and Grandpa are the most cherished musical memories of my life,” says Emily. “It was then that I really started learning how to communicate through music, speaking with my dad and grandpa through solos and spaces on stage.”\n\nJuly 25 | Blue Water Highway\n\nBased in the musical landscape of Austin, Texas, Blue Water Highway isn’t just a band — they’re a journey. With a sound that echoes the soul of Americana-folk rock, their harmonies ripple through modernity while honoring the roots of tradition. Drawing inspiration from city and country life, their music resonates with the depth of the heartland. Often compared to legendary acts such as the Eagles, Bruce Springsteen, and the Counting Crows. Over a decade of touring, sharing stages with icons like Bob Seger and Big Head Todd and the Monsters, they have honed their craft to perfection. At the helm of this musical voyage are Zack Kibodeaux and Greg Essington, childhood friends from Lake Jackson, whose bond forms the bedrock of the band. Alongside them stand Catherine Clark, a fellow opera singer, whose voice adds to the soulful harmony, and Kyle James Smith, whose basslines anchor the band’s sound. Together, they craft tight, inventive music that captures the essence of their namesake — the hometown coastal stretch from Surfside to Galveston. Blue Water Highway isn’t just a band you listen to; they’re a passage to somewhere deeper, somewhere real.\n\nAugust 1 | Seth James\n\nSeth James is a rare musical talent whose infectious sound blends the gritty Texas blues with\n\nsoulful R&B, rootsy Americana, and groove-laden funk. This lifelong West Texas rancher may\n\nbe clothed in a cowboy hat and boots, but his music embodies the rock, soul and blues styles\n\nmore associated with Detroit, Chicago, New Orleans and Memphis.\n\nWith virtuosic guitar chops, soulful vocals, and an innate ability to craft songs brimming with\n\ngroove. Seth comes from a long line of musical talent including his father, grandfather, great-\n\ngrandfather, and older brother, and has married a singer. Seth has spent years honing his\n\ndistinctive musical blend. His isolated ranch upbringing, with just one ’90s country station to\n\nlisten to, fueled his relentless hunt for music that resonated deeper. Inspired by the bluesy, soulful\n\nsounds of Delbert McClinton, he studied and eventually collaborated with Delbert and other\n\nmusicians including Chris Stapleton.\n\nDespite a prolific songwriting career collaborating with such well-known artists, Seth remains\n\nhumble about his achievements. This awe-shucks authenticity only makes his top-tier talent more\n\ncaptivating. Whether crooning with an easy grace or unleashing a gripping soul shout, Seth’s\n\nperformances are an exercise in feeling good.\n\nAugust 8 | Tejas Brothers\n\nThe Tejas Brothers are musicians with extreme dedication to the art of entertaining. They have been recognized as one of the best live acts to see in the Lone Star State. Their signature style of Tex-Mex Honky Tonk was crafted in the Stockyards of Fort Worth, TX. The Tejas Brothers are committed to providing fun, energetic and uplifting performances for audiences of all ages and various types of listeners. Whether you like Country or Tejano, Rock ‘n’ Roll or Blues, or just laughing, dancing or people watching… You’ll be so happy you came to this show!\n\nAugust 15 | Kelly Willis\n\nWith rockabilly roots and a heartache-meets-honky-tonk voice, Kelly Willis has been labeled a country ingenue. As a new traditionalist singer-songwriter, her tunes effortlessly combine the storytelling and strings aspects of country music and the driving force of rock. Kelly Willis is the alluring voice and songwriting talent who pioneered both Americana and the Texas young country scene with her debut album in 1990, and has since, over the course of five more gems, proven how she can do it all from contemporary to traditional and beyond with finesse, smarts, and irresistible charm."
