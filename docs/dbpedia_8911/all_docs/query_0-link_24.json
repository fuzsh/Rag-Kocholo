        "text": "Mike Daily (steel guitar) Mike has been a member of the Texas Jamm Band since its inception and is also one of the original founding members of the Ace in the Hole Band. Mike comes from a proud country music family tradition that originated in Houston. His grandfather – known as Pappy – discovered George Jones and recorded and produced Jones for his first years as an artist. Mike’s father Don was the first to record his son’s Ace in the Hole Band with George Strait as lead vocalist.\n\nRonnie Huckaby (piano) Ronnie Huckaby was born and raised in Waco. After high school, he moved to Austin in the early 1970s to experience the exploding outlaw country movement firsthand. He played in local bands around the area until an audition with George Strait in 1983 led him to his current position as band leader and piano player for the country music superstar. Benny McArthur (guitar, fiddle, vocals) Benny McArthur began playing the guitar when he was 13 years old and he picked up the fiddle in his early 20s. In 1983, Benny had the opportunity to join George Strait and he has been a member of Ace in the Hole ever since. His talents are many: guitar, fiddle, vocals, songwriting, producer and studio musician. He wrote George’s hit song “When it’s Christmas Time in Texas”. Benny is also co-founder of the Artist Exclusive Channel which is a new subscription web site designed for independent artists and their fans. Joe Manuel (guitar, vocals) Joe Manuel started in the music business with the Manuel Family Band at a Shakey’s Pizza Parlor in Lake Charles, La., in 1970 at the age of 10. The Manuel family band hit the road in 1976 and Joe eventually landed in Nashville for 23 years. He has worked with Lynn Anderson, T.G. Sheppard, the Grand Ole Opry’s Jimmy C. Newman, Ricky Skaggs, Merle Haggard, Randy Travis, Lee Ann Womack and, of course, George Strait, as a member of the Ace in the Hole Band for the past eight years."
