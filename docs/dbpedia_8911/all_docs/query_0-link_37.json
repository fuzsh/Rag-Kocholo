Their latest album, ‘Snapshots,’ reflects their evolution with familiar yet matured sound, featuring relatable tracks like “Snapshot” and “So Called Perfect Life.” The band's revamped version of “Absolutely (Story of a Girl)” captures their journey and growth, thanks to producer Jim Scott's guidance, marking a new chapter for Nine Days after learning from past experiences and taking a more prudent approach to recording.\n\nShelby Darrall, reminiscent of her hometown in Napa Valley, embraces her journey as a country storyteller, relishing every milestone along the way. Starting her career in the tasting rooms of wineries in Calistoga, California, she inherited a musical spirit from her father, a member of Silver Creek. Encouraged by her roots, she ventured to Nashville, where her charisma and powerful vocals earned her respect on Music Row. Collaborating with esteemed songwriters, she began releasing original music and sharing the stage with notable acts like Sam Hunt and Little Big Town. With over 8.5 million global streams and inclusion on major playlists, Darrall's music resonates with audiences, blending her life experiences with authentic storytelling. As she embraces this new chapter, she looks forward to connecting with fans nationwide, her songs reflecting the threads of her wine country upbringing and her passion for intimate storytelling.\n\nWill Jones has been immersed in Country music since childhood, joining his family's bluegrass band, The Cana Ramblers, at the age of six. The band gained national recognition with their 2009 album, \"No Expectations.\" Transitioning to a solo career as a singer-songwriter at 17, Will has performed extensively across the southern United States. His music has graced high-profile events alongside renowned figures in the country music scene, including Tracy Lawrence, Sierra Hull, and Johnny Cash, among others.
