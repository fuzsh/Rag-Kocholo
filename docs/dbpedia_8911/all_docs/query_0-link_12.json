        "text": "Over on the Warwick Bass site, there’s an interview with Terry Hale, Red Leaf’s bass teacher. We always look forward to Terry’s positivity, stories from the road, and that low end rumble coming from his students’ lessons. Check out the article below, written by Dale Titus, and get to know Mr. Hale a little better!\n\nTerry Hale: George Strait’s Ace-in-the-Hole\n\nAs a veteran journalist I rarely have trouble coming up with a title for an article or interview. That is, until I tried to come up with one for this interview with bassist Terry Hale. Most of the world knows Terry has the longtime bassist for George Strait’s band, The Ace In The Hole band. So, the title I chose seems fitting, if not all that original. But as I was interviewing Terry I found out that he is MUCH more than what my title implies. He is a devoted student of music, a respected jazz bassist and a true gentleman.\n\nAfter you read this interview feel free to email me with any suggestions you might have for a title that better describes one of the bass world’s brightest lights.\n\nWhen did you first pick up the bass?\n\nThe first time I played a bass gig was when I was 11 years old. It was our sixth grade graduation party. Three friends and I made an attempt at putting a band together. The band consisted of two guitars, bass and drums. We played “Louie, Louie” about six times and one original that consisted of a G and an F chord. We called ourselves Green Saphron Mist. We were not very good, but we were entertaining to our classmates.\n\nMy first instrument was the guitar – all of my older siblings played. I did try sax for about three months, until my Dad couldn’t handle it any longer. I came home one afternoon and the sax was gone!\n\nDid you take formal lessons?\n\nNo, just what was offered within the elementary school system at the time, which was singing, playing the recorder, and simple percussion. I mostly learned from my brothers and sister, who at the time where into the folk scene. I am most definitely an ear player.\n\nWhen the touring slowed down in the mid-90’s, I did pursue some education from some local universities. I studied Music Theory, Improv, and Ear Training. I now have about 15 hours of credit from classes taken.\n\nWho were your early influences on the bass?\n\nI remember being about 12 years old when I first heard Ray Brown on the Merv Giffin show and it was a life-changing experience. I have spent the rest of my life trying to duplicate that sound. Motown was also a big deal for me. Those are just classic lines, and great musical lessons. The first song I ever learned note-for-note was Otis Redding’s “Sittin’ on the Dock of the Bay”. It was a proud moment. Next came the local Bay Area guys: Jack Cassidy, Phil Lesh, Rocco Prestia – amazing players all. I then devoured the “Wheels of Fire” album (Cream). Jack Bruce was, and is to this day, a great hero of mine. Rick Danko was the guy who hipped me to fretless.\n\nI guess I’d have to say I listen like a thief, and steal from almost every bassist I hear.\n\nYou are most famous for playing in the Ace in the Hole Band with George Strait singing. How did you first hook up with George?\n\nIt was in the summer of 1975. I’d been playing with some guys for about 18 months, when on one night the singer unceremoniously fired all four of us. We decided to stick together – I mean how hard could it be to find a singer, right? Well it took us a couple months. Right before school was to start, (we were all going to Southwest Texas State University ) we placed an ad on the bulletin board in the student union, “band looking for a singer….” On the other side of the board someone had placed an ad for a singer looking for a band. My room mate was the guitarist at the time and called me and said I should cut my trip home short and come check out this guy that wanted to try out for the band. I did and it was George. He was just out of the military and starting school on the G. I. bill. He came to our house that afternoon, sick with a cold, sang one verse and one chorus of a song called “Frauline” I was floored, told him to take two weeks off and come back when he felt better. We started rehearsals twice a day from about mid August until mid October. Our first gig was October 13th, (Ray Brown’s birthday as a matter of fact) and the rest is still to be seen.\n\nThe Ace in the Hole band has had the same musicians (with the exception of the guitarist who passed away) for over 30 years. Most bands don’t survive past 30 weeks! How is it that you all have stayed together for so long?\n\nDesire, tolerance and a combined effort to learn our instruments. I guess the most important thing is to have mutual respect, knowing when to step in and when to jump back. This is one of the things I am most proud of, the fact that it is now a 12-piece band, but that there are still 4 out of the original 5 members here.\n\nMusically, how do you stay fresh when you have been in the same band for so many years?\n\nSpace. When we aren’t working together, we’re working with different people in different genres. Also it’s very comfortable now to be on stage with each other. There is a lot of spontaneity – we can pick up on each other’s vibes and play off each other’s efforts. The things we’ve learned from working with other players we bring back to this band. We all are great at sharing musically.\n\nWhat is coming up for The Ace in the Hole Band?\n\nAs far as I am aware right now, there is a CMA award shows this fall and our tour will start in January, 2007. Just “keep on keepin on” I guess.\n\nHow did your relationship with Warwick begin and what made you want to play them?\n\nOur relationship had a rather mysterious start; seems some one was impersonating me at a Summer NAMM show in Nashville . Apparently this imposter kept stopping by the Warwick booth to get an endorsement. Luckily for me, (Dana B. Goods’ Artist Relations Manager) Michael Brown follows through. He got in touch with management, and they contacted me.\n\nWhat made me want to play Warwick basses is the tone, the sound of wood, just huge balls. Warwick played a major roll in enabling me to “name my sound”. I found what I was looking for.\n\nWhat Warwick basses and amps do you use?\n\nI am proud to say my arsenal now contains two 5-string Thumb basses, one fretted with Seymour Duncan Basslines pickups that I used on the Festival Tours (5 yrs. of stadiums), a frettless that is my main instrument and closest to my heart, and a new Triumph electric up right which is blowing my mind and all those around me with the tone and warmth that I’ve never heard from a non-acoustic upright. It is an amazing instrument and incredibly fun to play.\n\nAs for amps, I use the Pro Tube IV with a 4X10 cab, and the new Blue Cab 60 for the Triumph. I had the opportunity to play the Blue Cab 30 recently and it sounds great and is compact as well. (The older I get, the less my amps weigh.)\n\nNot many people know this, but you are an accomplished Jazz bassist too. How long have you played jazz?\n\nI have always been a jazz fan, but I’ve only seriously been learning and practicing it for the last 10-to-12 years. I studied it by the only method I’ve ever used, which is to listen and play. I have the great fortune to be in a local music union that has many great jazz players, and they often teach summer workshops which I partake of whenever available. I also had the good fortune to be able to go back to my old alma mater and take a jazz improv class from Dr. James Polk, who was Ray Charles’ band director for 10 years. What an experience!\n\nI currently have a couple jazz groups that I work with here in Austin . Javier Chaparro’s Jazz Ensemble, Playa Azul, (a Latin Jazz group) and the Rick McRae Trio (Rick being the guitarist for George for the last 22 years), and Caravan, which is a group I put together to help me learn how to play. Caravan has a flexible line-up that can be a duo, trio, or a quartet . Plus my swing groups, the Riff Ryders and the Hip Replacements, the Floyd Domino Big Band, and the Johnny Nicholas Texas All Stars, which is a jump blues big band.\n\nHow do you get yourself ready to tour?\n\nPhysically, I will increase my jogging miles and weights. Just being in shape when the tour begins is a great asset.\n\nMusically, I will listen to shows from the previous tour and go over any new stuff off of the recent releases. George will usually call for about three days of full band rehearsals, usually hitting the road at the end of the last one. So I’ll make a personal CD of the songlist that we are sent, and play along with it for a week prior to those rehearsals, so I’m all ready to go when the rehearsals start. Mostly now it’s just like riding a bicycle.\n\nYou have accomplished so much as a musician. What goals have you set for yourself for the future?\n\nTo try to figure out how Ray Brown did what he did and why. To relax and enjoy and hopefully teach younger players anything I might be able to pass along. Catch up on lost years with my wife and kids. Learn how to play bass.\n\nWhat are three things that a young bassists needs to be successful in music?\n\nPractice: learn your instrument, where the notes are, the sweet spots. Music in general\n\nPractice: your self-respect, respect for those that came before as well as those who follow and music in general.\n\nPractice: humility, it will protect your self-respect. There are always better players, there are always those just learning, never believe your own hype; it is death for sure. Humble yourself to music in general.\n\nInterview by: Dale Titus – DaleT@danabgoods.com"
