        "text": "Country music legends like Bob Wills and Buck Owens had backing bands (The Texas Playboys and the Buckaroos). George Strait has his Ace in the Hole Band.\n\nThe band has been with Strait since their early days at Southwest Texas State University, now known as Texas State University, in San Marcos, Texas. Its origins lie in the band that was known as Stoney Ridge.\n\nCoincidentally, Strait became the bandâ€™s lead singer after members of Stoney Ridge were looking for one.\n\nHow George Strait Became The Lead Singer\n\nThe story goes that the band put out fliers seeking a lead singer. Strait, who was an agriculture science major at Southwest Texas State, saw a flier and made a phone call.\n\nBand members listened to Strait, liked what they heard, and added him to the roster in the mid-1970s.\n\nStrait eventually went on to have his solo career in the 1980s. The band, though, continued to play behind Strait and does so to this day.\n\nMembers of the band include Mike Daily on steel guitar, Terry Hale on bass, Ron Huckaby on keyboards, Rick McRae on lead guitar, Benny McArthur on guitar and fiddle, Gene Elders on fiddle, Wes Hightower and Marty Slayton on backing vocals, Joe Manuel on acoustic guitar, John Michael Whitby on keyboards, and Lonnie Wilson on drums."
