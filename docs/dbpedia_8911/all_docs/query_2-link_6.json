A little secret that nobody knows. Life is a gamble, a game we all play, But you need to save something for a rainy day. You've got to learn to play your cards right if you expect to win in life. Don't put it all on the line for just one roll. You've got to have an ace in the hole. If you're headed down a one way street. And you're not sure it's the way you wanna go. In money or love, or all the above, Have a little more than what you show. When life deals out a surprise Have a few surprises of your own. No matter what you do, no matter where you go You've got to have an ace in the hole. You've got to have an ace in the hole. A little secret that nobody knows. Life is a gamble, a game we all play, But you need to save something for a rainy day. You've got to learn to play your cards right if you expect to win in life. Don't put it all on the line for just one roll. You've got to have an ace in the hole. Don't put it all on the line for just one roll You've got to have an ace in the hole.
