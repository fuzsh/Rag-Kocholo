        "text": "The country music world shockingly lost Jeremy Tepper on Friday to a heart attack.\n\nThat alone would have been heartbreaking, but it was the second death announced in a week involving a prominent country music figure. And, for the year, it continued a trend with the industry losing 16 performers or key figures.\n\nHere is a look at the tragic losses the community has suffered so far in 2024:\n\nNorah Lee Allen\n\nIt has been an emotional year for The Oak Ridge Boys, and things took a particularly heartbreaking turn on Easter.\n\nAccording to Taste of Country, Norah Lee Allen, the wife of lead singer Duane Allen, died Sunday morning after battling an illness for “an extended period of time.” The site reported that she had been at Vanderbilt Hospital when she died.\n\nAllen reportedly shared the news on social media Sunday.\n\n“This morning, my wife of 54 years and 8 months took her last breath of air on planet Earth,” he wrote. “Norah Lee went to be with Jesus at 7:28 am, Easter morning. She had not been feeling well for some time. Her family all spent the night with her last night at Vanderbilt Hospital. We took time singing with and to her, telling her stories, and loving her every second that God let us share her here on this Earth.”\n\nThe Grand Ole Opry took time to remember Allen, too.\n\n“During (Wednesday’s show), we paused to remember a beloved member of our Opry family we lost earlier this week, Norah Lee Allen,” a post on the Opry’s X page, formerly Twitter, read. “For decades, Norah Lee added her voice to Opry performances as one of our background vocalists, our Opry Singers.\n\n“She was also a member of our family as the wife of Duane Allen of Opry group The Oak Ridge Boys,” the post continued. “She will be lovingly remembered by all who knew her and all who knew her voice here at the Grand Ole Opry.”\n\nMore country music news\n\nHonky-tonk legend recovering after emergency quadruple bypass surgery\n\nCountry music legend announces final tour, talks about why he’s retiring\n\nCountry music star announces changes to shows because of her heart condition\n\nFran Boyd\n\nFran Boyd, a country music groundbreaker and champion of the genre, died March 9, according to Billboard.\n\nShe was 84.\n\nBillboard said that Boyd “played a key role in shaping and advancing the (Academy of Country Music) from its early years in California in the late 1960s, through the start of the millennium.”\n\nBoyd was reportedly the first paid employee of the ACM, coming onboard in 1968 as executive secretary. She worked her way all the way up to executive director. Per Billboard, she “oversaw nearly every aspect of the annual (ACM) awards” show.\n\nShe worked for the ACM for more than three decades before retiring in 2002.\n\n“Fran Boyd played an essential part in the Academy’s history, stretching way back to the 1960s and steering the ship through decades of change, innovation, and growth, all while fostering an incredible passion for country music,” Gayle Holcomb, ACM Board Sergeant-At-Arms told Billboard. “Fran will always be remembered as a champion for our industry, its artists, and this organization.”\n\nLarry Collins\n\nLarry Collins, a former country music child star turned legendary guitarist and song writer, died on Jan. 5.\n\nHe was 79. Per reports, Collins died of natural causes.\n\nHe first made his splash in country music alongside his older sister, Lorrie, when they formed the “The Collins Kids” duo when Larry was just 9 years old. They recorded a series of hits — “Hop, Skip and Jump,” “Hoy Hoy,” and “Beetle Bug Bop” — with music catering to children. They became regulars on “Town Hall Party” in 1954 and performed together into the 60s.\n\nPer reports, Lorrie had her first child in 1961 and stepped away from music to focus on family. The duo did reunite years later in the 90s.\n\nWhile Lorrie, who died in 2018, focused on building her family, Larry moved on to a solo career where he made, perhaps, his biggest mark as a songwriter. He is credited as the co-writer for “Delta Dawn,” which became Tanya Tucker’s first hit song, among other songs.\n\nAllison Cornell\n\nAllison Cornell died in February.\n\nShe was a part of Shania Twain’s band for years.\n\n“Allison Cornell was such a talented and wonderful person,” Twain wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “It was a privilege, as an artist, to have her on stage with me through a lot of my touring career. Feeling very sad. Allison’s memory will live on but sadly another beautiful human has gone too soon. Rest in Peace (heart emoji).”\n\nA post on Cornell’s artist management page also addressed her death.\n\n“It is with great sadness that we say farewell to Allison Shropshire Cornell,” the post began. “Rest in Peace. Heaven has opened up its gates to an incredible talent!”\n\nGene Elders\n\nGene Elders, a longtime fiddle player in Country Music Hall of Famer George Strait’s legendary Ace in the Hole Band, died March 20.\n\nHe was 66 years old, and no cause of death was reported.\n\nIt was the second heartbreaking death to rock Strait in a day’s time after his manager, Erv Woolsey, also passed away.\n\n“Hard to believe we lost two of our music family members on the same day,” Strait posted on X, formerly Twitter. “Our Ace in the Hole treasured band member Gene Elders passed away yesterday afternoon shortly after we lost Erv. All of our prayers go out to both families. We loved him so much.”\n\nElders’ website said he played in Strait’s band since 1984. It said he also played in Lyle Lovett’s Large Band for 11 years and played on recordings for Joan Baez, Lucinda Williams and Dan Fogelberg.\n\nFans took to social media following the news to remember Elders.\n\n“I’ve been fortunate enough to watch Gene Elders play that haunting fiddle outro on ‘Amarillo By Morning’ live several times,” one person wrote. “The arena goes dark except for a long spotlight on Gene, it sends chills every time. RIP Gene Elders.”\n\nTom Foote\n\nTom Foote, a former drummer for Strait’s Ace in the Hole band and the singer’s longtime road manager, died April 29.\n\n“We lost another one of our good friends and a huge part of our musical journey yesterday,” Strait wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “Tom Foote, our one-time drummer and long-time road manager for around 48 years, suddenly passed away at his home after our rehearsal. The band and I were with him most of the afternoon, and he was great. Just doing what he loved to do which was making sure we were taken care of. 2024 is taking its toll on the Ace in the Hole group. We’re all heartbroken to say the least. Rest in peace brother Tom. You will be hugely missed. I’ll see you down the road amigo.”\n\nFoote was reportedly the drummer for a band that hired Strait to be its new singer back in 1975. That band eventually became the Ace in the Hole Band. He reportedly stayed on as drummer through 1983 when he moved into his role as road manager.\n\nWayland Holyfield\n\nWayland Holyfield might not be a name that most country music fans know, but that probably should not be the case.\n\nBecause the guy was an icon.\n\nHolyfield died on May 6, according to multiple reports. He was 82.\n\nHolyfield was one of the greatest songwriters country music has ever seen. He helped write 14 No. 1 hits and had more than 40 songs reach the Top 10 during his time, according to Taste of Country.\n\nThe site said Holyfield wrote songs for some of country music’s most legendary performers including George Strait, George Jones, the Judds, Brooks & Dunn, Randy Travis, Reba McEntire, Waylon Jennings, Conway Twitty and many more.\n\n“Wayland Holyfield — who died May 6 — wrote sons of unflagging devotion, including the Don Williams hit ‘You’re My Best Friend’ and Anne Murray’s ‘Could I Have this Dance,’” the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum said in a post on X, formerly Twitter. “Holyfield was devoted to his wife, to the craft of songwriting, and to advocating for the rights of his peers.”\n\nMark James\n\nMark James, a legendary songwriter and hitmaker, died on June 8.\n\nHe was 83.\n\nJames, who was a Houston native, died at his home in Nashville.\n\nJames won a pair of Grammys in 1983 for “Always on My Mind,” which was performed by Willie Nelson. He also wrote the hits “Hooked on a Feeling” and “Suspicious Minds.” He is a member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\n“Mark’s legacy and zest for life will live on in the hearts of those who loved him; and through his timeless lyrics and melodies that have been the soundtrack of lovers for generations,” his family said according to the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nAlong with Nelson, James wrote hits for the likes of Elvis Presley, B.J. Thomas and Brenda Lee.\n\nToby Keith\n\nToby Keith died on Feb. 5 following a battle with stomach cancer.\n\nHe was 62.\n\nIt was tragic news, especially, for a man who battled so bravely such a horrible disease, but if there’s any solace to be found for his fans, it could be in some of his final words. Because, in his final days, Keith sat down with News 9 in Oklahoma to talk about his journey.\n\nHe called cancer a “long dark hallway,” but he also approached the subject in a way that only a man at complete peace could. And that is something he pinned on faith.\n\n“You take it for granted on the days that things are good, and you lean on it when days are bad,” he said. “It has taught me to lean on it a little more every day.”\n\nAnd that is when Keith talked about thinking about, at times, the possibility that he might die.\n\n“I was going through all the chemo, radiation, surgery, and I got to the point where I was comfortable with whatever happened,” he said. “I had my brain wrapped around it, and I was in a good spot either way.”\n\nThat, he said, was a point that people with faith are not able to so easily get to.\n\nMojo Nixon\n\nThe headline in Rolling Stone called Mojo Nixon an “unabashed outlaw cult hero,” and if you dig into the story you quickly find out that’s just about a perfect way to sum the guy up.\n\nNixon was one heckuva interesting guy.\n\nHe died on Feb. 7 at the age of 66, and even how he went was out of the ordinary. He was a host aboard the Outlaw Country Cruise and his family said he suffered a cardiac event, that took his life.\n\n“How you should live is how you should die,” the family told Rolling Stone. “Mojo Nixon was full-tilt, wide-open rock hard, root hog, corner on two wheels + on fire. Passing after a blazing show, a raging night, closing the bar, taking no prisoners + a good breakfast with bandmates and friends.\n\n“A cardiac event on the Outlaw Country Cruise is about right… & that’s just how he did it, Mojo has left the building,” they added. “Since Elvis is everywhere, we know he was waiting for him in the alley out back. Heaven help us all.”\n\nRolling Stone wrote that Nixon “enjoyed a supremely weird yet singular career.”\n\nHis big break came in 1987 with his hit novelty song “Elvis is Everywhere,” that became a regular on MTV.\n\nHe put out six albums alongside Skid Roper, and five more solo projects. He also served as a DJ for SiriusXM’s Outlaw Country for years.\n\nMargo Smith\n\nMargo Smith might not be a name that most young country music fans know, but if you Google her you will see “legend” right there next to her name.\n\nSadly, the headlines will also mention that she has died at the age of 84. According to multiple reports, Smith passed away on Jan. 23. A cause of death has not been reported.\n\nSmith was reportedly a kindergarten teacher in Ohio for about a decade before her career took off.\n\nKnown as “The Tennessee Yodeler,” she churned out 18 studio albums between 1971 and 2005.\n\nSmith was named ASACP Country Artist of the Year in 1979 and won the CCMA Living Legend Award in 2001.\n\nJo-El Sonnier\n\nJo-El Sonnier might not be a name that most fans of modern country music would know well, but read up and it doesn’t take long to realize the guy was a legend.\n\nHe put his heart and soul into a show, and apparently, he did that right up until the end. Sonnier died on Jan. 13 after a performance.\n\nLouisiana Music Hall of Fame Executive Director Mike Shepard told WWL Radio New Orleans that the 77-year-old Sonnier “died doing what he loved.”\n\n“Jo-El’s death on stage after a successful encore is actually the only way a musician should go out,” he said.\n\nThe station reported that Sonnier, a singer/songwriter who played the accordion, had a long list of accolades that included a Grammy in 2015 and an ACM Male Vocalist of the Year nomination. He was reportedly inducted into seven different Music Hall of Fames and worked as a studio musician for a long list of stars including Dolly Parton and Johnny Cash.\n\n“He loved the idea of being honored for his music,” Shepard told WWL, “being honored for what he loved to do, pure as his heart.”\n\nRoni Stoneman\n\nCountry music legend Roni Stoneman died on Feb. 22.\n\nShe was 85. No cause of death was given.\n\nStoneman was known as the “first lady of the banjo” and was a popular performer on the hit TV show “Hee Haw.”\n\nStoneman was a native of Washington, D.C.\n\nShe was the daughter of Ernest “Pop” Stoneman, who was reportedly one of the first performers to make a career of recording country music.\n\nCountry Music Hall of Fame and Museum CEO Kyle Young said country music was “a birthright and her life’s work.”\n\n“The second youngest of 23 children born to Hattie and Ernest ‘Pop” Stoneman, Roni was an integral part of a bedrock country music family, who were longtime fixtures in the country music scene of Washington D.C.” Young said. “For 18 years on ‘Hee Haw,’ she stole scenes as both a skillful banjo player and as a comical, gap-toothed country character. She was a great talent and a strong woman.”\n\nBanjo News said Stoneman said she glued picks to her fingers so she could play the banjo faster.\n\nJeremy Tepper\n\nJeremy Tepper, a legend in the country music world, died on June 14.\n\nHe was 60.\n\nTepper reportedly suffered a heart attack. Variety reported that his wife, singer Laura Cantrell, announced that he died on social media.\n\nTepper occupied multiple roles across his years, working as a musician, journalist, executive and finally the program director of SiriusXM’s “Outlaw Country,” according to Variety.\n\nVariety referred to Tepper as a “music lifer.” According to the site, that trek began when he was the frontman for the band World Famous Blue Jays and then co-founded the record label Diesel Only in 1990. He also served as the country music critic for Pulse! Magazine and was the editor of the Journal of Country Music, per Variety.\n\nThe site said he had been the format manager for SiriusXM’s Outlaw Country channel since 2004. It noted that he also worked with the “Willie’s Roadhouse” and “Road Dog Trucking” channels.\n\nErv Woolsey\n\nLegendary country music figure Eugene Ervine “Erv” Woolsey died March 20.\n\nHe was 80.\n\nWoolsey reportedly died Wednesday from complications following surgery, according to multiple reports.\n\nWoolsey was one of country music’s most influential managers. Most notably, he was the long-time manager of Country Music Hall of Famer George Strait, as well as stars Lee Ann Womack, Dierks Bentley, Ronnie Milsap and Clay Walker.\n\nStrait posted about Woolsey on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n“My manager for around 45 years and most importantly my friend for even longer, Erv Woolsey, passed away this morning,” he wrote. “He had complications from surgery and just couldn’t overcome it. He was a very tough man, and fought hard, but sadly it was just too much. We will miss him so very much and will never forget all the time we had together. Won’t ever be the same without him.”\n\nAccording to a Billboard report, Woolsey worked for several labels before moving to Nashville in 1973 and become the head of promotions for ABC Records. The site said that Woolsey helped guide the careers of several top artists there, but it was during his time as the owner of The Prairie Rose, a club in Texas, that he first met Strait and began to book him for regular shows.\n\nBillboard said Woolsey worked for MCA in the 1980s and helped artists such as Loretta Lynn, Tanya Tucker, Conway Twitty and the Oak Ridge Boys find radio success. And, then in 1981, he reportedly got MCA records to sign Strait.\n\nHe wasn’t just a manager, though.\n\nPer Billboard, Woolsey wrote “In Too Deep” for Strait and also had a hot country chart topper that he wrote, “I Can Still Make Cheyenne.”\n\nArch Yancey\n\nArch Yancey, a Country Radio Hall of Famer, died March 4.\n\nHe was 88. No cause of death was reported.\n\nCountry Air Check said that Yancey got his first break way back in 1955 when he beat out Johnny Cash for a job at WBIP in Boonesville, Mississippi. The site reported that just three years later, Yancey was at Top 40 KNUZ-AM in Houston.\n\nHe reportedly spent 31 years on the air before retiring in 1989.\n\nCountry Air Check reported that, among his awards, he won Gavin Country Personality of the Year in 1971 and was ACM Personality of the Year in 1982.\n\nIt said he was inducted into the Country Radio Hall of Fame in 2006."
