        "text": "Gene Elders, a mandolin and fiddle player for George Strait’s band Ace in the Hole Band, has died though no cause of death has been reported. He was 66.\n\nIt was also the second tragic death in Strait’s life following the news of his manager, Erv Woolsey, who passed away recently.\n\n“Hard to believe we lost two of our music family members on the same day,” Strait, 71, wrote on a post on X, formerly Twitter. “Our Ace in the Hole treasured band member Gene Elders passed away yesterday afternoon shortly after we lost Erv. All of our prayers go out to both families. We loved him so much.”\n\nHe also shared the post on his Instagram and Facebook accounts.\n\nAccording to Elders’ official site, he has played in Strait’s band since 1984. He also played in Lyle Lovett’s Large Band for 11 years, and also recorded with artists like Joan Baez, Lucinda Williams and Dan Fogelberg.\n\nFriends and fans expressed their condolences for Elders following the news of his passing.\n\n“I’ve been fortunate enough to watch Gene Elders play that haunting fiddle outro on ‘Amarillo By Morning’ live several times,” one person wrote. “The arena goes dark except for a long spot light on Gene, it sends chills every time. RIP Gene Elders.”\n\n“One of the finest violin players in the history of Country music,” another fan wrote on Instagram. “I’ll never forget Alan Jackson giving him credit in George’s “cowboy rides away” performance. May God rest his incredible soul.”\n\nMore music coverage\n\nLegendary classic rock singer calls it quits after 50 years\n\nPopular rock drummer dead at 57 from brain cancer\n\nLegendary rock band’s co-founder stepping back after heart attack\n\nLegendary rock drummer recovering from major hand surgery ‘has his life back’"
