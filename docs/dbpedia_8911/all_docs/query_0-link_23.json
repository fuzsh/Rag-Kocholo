        "text": "George Strait Introduction “I want to reach the point where people hear my name and immediately think of real country music (“George Strait Quotes,” 2018).” George Strait made this happen too, with hard work and persistence. Being turned down by multiple record companies was very hard on Strait. He kept working though, and it paid off. George won many awards, was inducted in the Hall of Fame, and kept old country alive when the “urban country” era started, making him one of the most influential artists of the twentieth century. Childhood Influences George Strait had many things that happened in his youth that influenced his future career. George was raised by his father on a 2,000-acre farm with his older brother Buddy. At a young age, his …show more content…\n\nGeorge Strait had to work for his big break, but the final outcome was rewarding. After being in the army, Strait joined the Ace in the Hole band. One day, Erv Woolsey, a Texas club owner, had the Ace in the Hole band playing at his club. One of the singers caught his attention. It was George Strait. Woolsey was Strait's big break (George Strait, 2012). Ron Chancey, the vice president at MCA Records , went to Erv Woolsey’s club to see Strait sing with his band because Woolsey had asked him to. Chancey liked him, but did not think that he had what it took to be an artist at MCA Records (Bego, 1997). Erv Woolsey helped Strait when he was upset about not being able to sign with MCA Records. \"Too country\" is what they called his singing. Woolsey made him keep trying though until he got a record deal (Teutsch, 2010). In the year 1981, Strait had a chance to prove to MCA Records to sign him. MCA let him make one song. If people liked it and bought it at stores, then he would get to make a whole album (Bego, 1997). George’s song was a success. MCA Records signed him giving Strait his first record deal. That was the beginning of it though, because nobody knew the real cowboy George Strait. Contribution to the Music Business George Strait was and still is an influential artist. From the lyrics and sound of his music to his cowboy look, many other musicians were influenced …show more content…\n\n13 year old Jenifer Strait died in a car crash on June 25, 1986. This was one of the most tragic days of George's life (Bego, 1997). Strait closed himself off about the topic for a long time. He was not able to talk about the tragedy for several years. George had to withdraw himself from the public to avoid any conversations about his daughter (Bego, 1997). Strait has never been the one to seek the spotlight on his private life, and the death of his daughter was no exception. All of the reporters gave him privacy out of courtesy (Bego, 1997). Strait loved his daughter and did not want her memory to be ruined by the reporters. That same year, he won the CMA Male Vocalist of the Year award. The award was taken in Jenifer’s honor (George Strait, 2012). Sadly, this was not the only terrible event that would happen to Strait. George's best friend and older brother died in a hotel in April of 2009. Buddy and George were very close and had done everything together (Teutsch, 2010). Strait would remember Jenifer and Buddy for the rest of his life, but he would move on as he remembers and mourns them. Currently Doing George Strait had a long, successful career. But in 2013, Strait went on tour for the last time. He had been touring for 30 years (West, 2013). George enjoyed making music for all those years, but sometimes it gets tiring. After \"The Cowboy Rides Away\" tour, George Strait planned to spend time with his wife,"
