Gilchrist led the Blue Raiders with a round of 70 (-1) as the team combined for a score of 290 (+6).\n\nUsing a 7 iron, Gilchrist aced the 146-yard par-3 third hole at Council Fire Golf Club on Monday morning. She became the second Blue Raider with a hole-in-one in the team's last three rounds.\n\nGilchrist's second-round score of 70 matched her career low. She enters the third round tied for 50th at 151 (+9) after taking 11 strokes off her first-round score.\n\nLanie Campbell improved upon her first-round score by three strokes with a 72 (+1) Monday. She picked up three birdies in the second round and heads into the final round tied for 26th at a team-low 147 (+5).\n\nElla Manley is tied for 60th at 152 (+10) after a round of 74 (+3) Monday. She made an eagle on the second hole and picked up three other birdies in the second round.\n\nNicole Johnson is tied for 68th at 153 (+11).

I'm proud of the way everyone competed and super happy for Lauren's hole-in-one and her under par finish. Ella eagled on her second hole, so we had some momentum early and steadied the ship after a few doubles. We have another day to come out and move up the leaderboard.\"\n\nTournament Notes\n\nSouth Florida and Michigan are tied for the team lead with matching scores of 570 (+2).\n\nMonet Chun of the Wolverines is the individual leader at 135 (-7).\n\nTuesday's third round will be the final regular season action for MTSU.\n\nFollow the Blue Raiders\n\nFollow Middle Tennessee Women's Golf on social media on Facebook /MTWGolf Twitter (@MT_WGolf) and Instagram (@mt_wgolf).\n\nPlayers Mentioned"
