        "text": "George Strait already had secured himself a place in Milwaukee Brewers and local concert history as the first artist to headline Miller Park a little over a month after it opened in 2001.\n\nBut that wasn’t enough for the King of Country Music.\n\nOn Saturday, Strait returned to the Brewers ballpark, now called American Family Field, with special guests Chris Stapleton and Little Big Town. And he set a new concert attendance record for the 22-year-old stadium, performing in front of 46,641 fans, besting Paul McCartney’s record from a decade ago by a few thousand people.\n\nI guess that’s what happens when you only schedule eight stadium shows this year, you haven’t played Milwaukee since 2009 and you have a staggering 61 Top 10 songs on the Billboard country charts — more than anybody else.\n\nNaturally, Strait couldn’t get to all of them Saturday, although I wish he would have swapped out his glorified jingle promoting his Codigo tequila brand for one of the 37 No. 1 songs he skipped.\n\nNevertheless, the 71-year-old Strait offered a generous set — 32 songs over two hours and 12 minutes — and made sure to include signatures like “The Chair” and “Amarillo by Morning,” the latter, Strait said Saturday, being his favorite song that he’s ever recorded.\n\nRELATED: With big concerts with Morgan Wallen, George Strait and more, Milwaukee has become a must-play market for country music.\n\nRELATED: From Drake to Post Malone to Willie Nelson, here are 17 top Milwaukee concerts this summer\n\nWith support from the 11-member “Ace in the Hole” band (named after a hit that also was skipped Saturday), Strait’s setlist in Milwaukee was nicely plotted, frequently going back and forth between somber songs and playful tunes.\n\nThe cheeky “Ocean Front Property” was placed before tears-in-your-beer breakup ballad “Nobody in His Right Mind Would’ve Left Her,” both released in 1986. And ode to miracles “I Saw God Today,” one of his last No. 1 songs, from 2008, appeared Saturday before his last gold-certified single from 2019, the swinging “Every Little Honky Tonk Bar.”\n\nStrait has never been the most animated performer, and the old cowboy isn’t going to learn new tricks. But he is blessed to have a catalogue with some of the sharpest songwriting of any country artist, and Saturday he let the storytelling seize the spotlight, expressed with a golden croon that showed no strain while offering enough emotional nuance to embody the material.\n\nFor “I Can Still Make Cheyenne,” Strait Saturday squeezed his eyes shut for the haunted last lines “And she always expected the worst in the back of her mind.” But for subsequent song “Check Yes or No,” Strait sang of that famous lifelong love with Emmylou Hayes with a pearly white smile and smitten twinkle in his eyes.\n\nBut there were two categories of songs Saturday where Strait offered his most impassioned vocals. They included thoughtful end-of-life reflections — \"When The Credits Roll,\" \"I'll Always Remember You,\" \"The Cowboy Rides Away\" — delivered Saturday with a heightened poignancy and understanding natural for a man in his twilight years.\n\nAnd then there were the covers, during which an eager Strait, with almost childlike glee, honored his heroes, from Merle Haggard (via a sobering \"Misery and Gin\") to Waylon Jennings through \"Waymore Blues,\" with standout guitar sizzle from Rick McRae.\n\nStrait's take on Johnny Cash's \"Folsom Prison Blues\" was the best part of his set, with McRae, along with longtime Strait bandmates Joe Manuel on acoustic guitar and Gene Elders on fiddle, offering crackling solos. And Strait shared the covers joy with Stapleton, who joined him at the tail end of Townes Van Zandt's classic \"Pancho and Lefty,\" one of three songs they did together Saturday (the others were Strait originals \"You Don't Know What You're Missing\" and \"Love's Gonna Make It Alright,\" two songs Stapleton co-wrote).\n\n\"I can't believe I'm on stage singing with George Strait,\" a beaming Stapleton blurted out at one point.\n\nBelieve it, Chris: there were 46,641 people in Milwaukee who were witnesses.\n\nMore: These are all of the arena, amphitheater and stadium concerts in Milwaukee in 2023\n\nMore: From Summerfest to Country Thunder, the 6 best music festivals in Wisconsin this summer\n\nChris Stapleton brings out a guest for his third Milwaukee show since 2021\n\nIt’s been a long time since Strait’s been in these parts, but maybe Stapleton should consider getting a place here. Milwaukee is one of the only cities in the world to get three Stapleton shows over three years — each one sold-out in a huge venue, despite no new music since 2020.\n\nGiven his esteemed company, this, naturally, was a shorter Stapleton set than at Summerfest in 2021 or Fiserv Forum last October, with 18 songs in 82 minutes and virtually no banter.\n\nBut Stapleton treated any repeat customers to one very special bonus: harmonica master Mickey Raphael, who’s been on the road with Willie Nelson for 50 years.\n\nRaphael’s signature radiant tone was heavenly for “The Devil Wears Music,” enhancing the lonesome lyrics about life on the road, with Stapleton at the song's climax embracing the seductive allure of his profession with sweet and smoky guitar licks and hellfire vocals. Raphael also playfully tried to one-up a fellow legendary country sideman, lap steel ace (and Stapleton band regular) Paul Franklin during “Hard Livin’,” before Stapleton answered them both with a soulful yell and a gut-punch guitar solo (although he and Franklin let their special guest get the final say on his harmonica).\n\nDo we dare dream of yet another Chris Stapleton Milwaukee show in 2024? If we’re lucky — and I bet he could sell out the Brewers stadium with his name topping the bill. (Although I hope we'll get some new songs before the next show.)\n\nLittle Big Town kicks off the night with spectacular vocals\n\nPity those who take Little Big Town for granted. Despite all their awards and accolades over a 25-year career, they don’t have the pedigree of the two A-listers on the bill (few do); during their night-opening set, there were pockets of empty seats in the stadium. But over 63 minutes, they showcased a vocal richness and soul worthy of Stapleton, and storytelling prowess worthy of Strait. Plus, they had something the other fellas didn’t: four-part harmonies, which sounded angelic even on a playful summer jam like “Pontoon.”\n\nEach powerhouse vocalist also had ample opportunity to shine on lead — from Kimberly Schlapman with bluegrass barn burner “Evangeline”; to Karen Fairchild with a heart-crushing “Girl Crush”; to Jimi Westbrook's moving post-pandemic reflection “Rich Man”; to Philip Sweet closing the set with gracious “Friends of Mine” with his tender voice and keys.\n\nSo sure, Little Big Town may not have been the primary selling point Saturday, but they’re future Hall of Famers for sure.\n\n6 takeaways from George Strait's Milwaukee concert\n\nBefore introducing Strait, Saturday’s announcer cried out “Go Pack Go.” As one should.\n\nDuring “The Weight of the Badge,” Strait honored Milwaukee police, with pictures of officers (and local firefighters) and the Milwaukee Police logo appearing on the big screens.\n\nAfter 20 songs, Strait brought out Leroy Sisco, CEO and founder of the Military Warriors Support Foundation, who announced that through Strait’s support the foundation was giving away a mortgage-free home — the 105th with Strait — to a veteran who was badly injured by an IED. Up in my section of the stadium, folks were sitting the entire show — but when that veteran was introduced on stage, nearly everyone got on their feet to give him a standing ovation.\n\nMorgan Wallen’s management denied having the roof open for his Milwaukee tour kickoff at American Family Field in April despite the magnificent weather that first night. Thankfully, such cruelty was not repeated Saturday. The roof was open the whole night, and it was bliss.\n\nAs far as traffic went: From the moment I first hit the brakes by the stadium, to the moment I parked, it took me 58 minutes. So, worse than Wallen (46 minutes), but much better than Janet Jackson at the American Family Insurance Amphitheater last month (a whopping 82 minutes). So if you’re coming back out to the stadium for Pink Aug. 14, give yourself tons of time — especially since that show will be on a Monday night.\n\nAnyone waiting to get in by the left field entrance got free preshow entertainment from concertgoers who hopped out of cars off the freeway, trekked up a steep hill, and attempted to climb over a fence. It was perilous, but with some hoisting from fellow country fans, they cleared the fence to the cheers of many (until cops figured out what was going on and kept a patrol at the spot).\n\nGeorge Strait's American Family Field setlist\n\n\"Deep in the Heart of Texas\"\n\n\"Stars on the Water\"\n\n\"I Got a Car\"\n\n\"The Fireman\"\n\n\"How 'Bout Them Cowgirls\"\n\n\"Run\"\n\n\"Here for a Good Time\"\n\n\"I Can Still Make Cheyenne\"\n\n\"Check Yes or No\"\n\n\"Wrapped\"\n\n\"Waymore's Blues\" (Waylon Jennings cover)\n\n\"The Weight of the Badge\"\n\n\"Ocean Front Property\"\n\n\"Nobody in His Right Mind Would've Left Her\"\n\n\"When the Credits Roll\"\n\n\"Misery and Gin\" (Merle Haggard cover)\n\n\"Pancho and Lefty\" (Townes Van Zandt cover, with Chris Stapleton)\n\n\"You Don't Know What You're Missing\" (with Chris Stapleton)\n\n\"Love's Gonna Make It Alright\" (with Chris Stapleton)\n\n\"I Saw God Today\"\n\n\"Every Little Honky Tonk Bar\"\n\n\"The Chair\"\n\n\"Give It Away\"\n\n\"Amarillo By Morning\"\n\n\"I'll Always Remember You\"\n\n\"Troubador\"\n\n\"Unwound\"\n\n\"Codigo\"\n\n\"All My Ex's Live in Texas\"\n\n\"Folsom Prison Blues\" (Johnny Cash cover)\n\n\"Take Me to Texas\"\n\n\"The Cowboy Rides Away\""
