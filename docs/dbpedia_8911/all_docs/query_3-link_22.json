        "text": "In Atkinson’s and Lind’s new book, available this March, they argue that small business is not, as is widely claimed, the basis of American prosperity. Small business is not responsible for most of the country’s job creation and innovation. American democracy does not depend on the existence of brave bands of self-employed citizens. Small businesses are not systematically discriminated against by government policy makers. Rather, Atkinson and Lind argue, small businesses are not the font of jobs, because most small businesses fail. The only kind of small firm that contributes to technological innovation is the technological start-up, and its success depends on scaling up. The idea that self-employed citizens are the foundation of democracy is a relic of Jeffersonian dreams of an agrarian society. And governments, motivated by a confused mix of populist and free market ideology, in fact go out of their way to promote small business. Every modern president has sung the praises of small business, and every modern president, according to Atkinson and Lind, has been wrong. Below is an excerpt from chapter 5, looking at job creation:\n\nMost Small Firms Are Dependent on Big Firms\n\nIn the natural world, “capstone species” — large animals or plants — help to shape an environment in which many smaller organisms can flourish. On the North American prairie, bison clear spaces for prairie dogs and grasses by grazing and wallowing. In tropical rainforests, giant trees provide support for vines and shade for smaller, shade-loving plants.\n\nLike capstone species, in many sectors big firms provide “ecosystem services” to much greater numbers of small and medium-sized companies. Large corporations are customers for complex webs of smaller suppliers. Their spending benefits yet other firms, as does the spending of their large number of more highly paid employees. And large firms can help innovations scale up, by buying them from startups, or buying the startups. In advanced industrial economies, many small firms and big firms are mutually interdependent partners in a common productive enterprise — not natural enemies engaged in a battle to the death. Moreover, whether America thrives in the global economy is not whether Justin’s clothing shop on Main Street sells more pants. It is whether companies that export goods and services and compete in tough international markets do well; whether companies that drive productivity in their operations through the introduction of new technology do well; and whether high-growth entrepreneurial companies, especially ones that that develop and commercialize innovations, do well. While they may have Main Street suppliers, these are not Main Street companies. These are “Industrial Street” and “Office Complex Street” companies; the former being manufacturing firms, particularly those competing in international markets, and the latter being technology-based nonmanufacturing companies\n\nWhy does job creation or loss by large firms have a bigger effect on the unemployment rate than similar changes by small firms? One reason is, as we showed in Chapter 3, that larger firms are more likely to be globally traded. It’s important to understand the difference between what regional economists refer to as local-serving and export-serving businesses.\n\nConsider the Maytag factory that closed in Newton, Iowa a few years ago. In a 60 Minutes segment about the suffering of local, small businesses in Newton, caused by the closing (the washers and dryers were to be made in Mexico), host Scott Pelly bemoaned the fact that these small companies weren’t getting help: “Three years after the beginning of the Great Recession, with interest rates the lowest they have ever been in history, banks are lending less money to the engines that create jobs.”[i]\n\nThis misses the point. Maytag was an export-serving business, meaning that it shipped products outside of the local labor market. While a small share of the washers and dryers coming off the assembly line were sold to local Newton residents, most were sold to customers throughout the nation or even the world, who sent money back to Maytag, who paid some of it to their local workers and contractors.\n\nIn contrast, the local Newton restaurants, dry cleaners, clothing stores, and barber shops are local-serving, as the lion’s share of their output is sold to Newton residents, including Maytag workers. If one of these local-serving small “Main Street” restaurants had gone out of business, it would have had no effect on the output of the Maytag factory. Moreover, another restaurant would more or less automatically expand or emerge to meet local demand.\n\nBut the Maytag factory closure had an immediate negative impact on the local-serving businesses, whose customers (Maytag workers, their suppliers, and the suppliers’ workers) had much less money to spend locally on meals, haircuts, dry cleaning, and other needs and desires. Conversely, if Newton Iowa were to attract a large company to occupy the abandoned Maytag facility, the health of Newton’s small businesses would immediately revive.\n\nSo what determines whether America thrives, including impacts on the unemployment rate, is not whether Justin’s clothing shop on Main Street sells more pants. It is whether companies that export goods and services and compete in tough international markets do well. As noted, while some small firms export, big firms are more likely to export…You can buy your copy of Big is Beautiful here.\n\nAbout the Authors\n\nRobert Atkinson is Founder and President of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a Washington, D.C. think tank, and coauthor of Innovation Economics: The Race for Global Advantage.\n\nMichael Lind is a Visiting Professor at the Lyndon B.
