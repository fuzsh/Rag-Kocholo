What began as a weekly local jam session for some of the Ace In The Hole band members has grown into a successful honky-tonking, hard-driving country band of seasoned musicians.

Their popularity has expanded from that weekly local jam to other venues, private parties, and corporate events in Texas and neighboring states, including a monthly kick-butt and dance crowd night at Moâ€™s Place in Katy, Texas. This December will mark the fifth year that Members of Ace in the Hole have played in Las Vegas, Nevada during the National Rodeo Finals.

The band has changed a little over time, but the music remains the same as it was when the group originally started out, filling the dance floor of that college night club while the club-goers partied and danced their feet off.
