        "text": "Meeting for the first time on the set of the TV show, Bosom Buddies, in the 1980s, Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson have been together ever since. On April 30, 2023, the couple celebrated their thirty-fifth wedding anniversary, marking over 3 decades of love, commitment, and devotion. In a heartfelt Instagram post, Wilson shared a touching tribute to her husband. In this article, we’ll explore the secrets behind their happy marriage and what we can learn from their enduring love story.\n\nIt was love at first sight for Tom Hanks.\n\nTom Hanks revealed that he was smitten with his wife, Rita Wilson, from the moment he saw her on television, even though they didn’t meet until years later. Wilson debuted on the Brady Bunch in 1972, and Hanks couldn’t help but notice how cute she was.\n\nHowever, it wasn’t until they worked together on the set of Bosom Buddies in 1981 that they finally met in person, and the chemistry between them was palpable. At the time, Hanks was still married to his college sweetheart, Samantha Lewes. Little did he know, in 2016, he’d admit to occasionally watching Wilson’s old TV appearances on YouTube.\n\nWhen they reunited for a film in 1984, their chemistry was off the charts. Hanks’ first marriage to Samantha Lewes broke off a few years later, and despite Hanks’ divorce not being finalized until 1987, Wilson and the actor made their relationship public in 1986. On April 30, 1988, they tied the knot in a sweet ceremony.\n\nThe couple welcomed their first child together, Chet, in 1990, and their second, Truman, in 1995, bringing their total number of children to 4. Hanks had 2 children, daughter Elizabeth and son Colin, with his ex-wife, Lewes, who passed away in 2002.\n\nNow 35 years strong, the couple still keeps the sparks alive.\n\n“Love is everything,” Wilson shared alongside a photo of her and Hanks celebrating their milestone anniversary. In the picture, Hanks, 66, looks at his wife lovingly as he holds a cake decorated with yellow frosted flowers and the words, “Happy Anniversary.” Wilson, 66, sits beside him, smiling and resting her hand on her cheek. It’s a heartwarming moment that shows the couple’s love and affection for each other.\n\nHanks considers himself “a lucky man.”\n\n“I view my wife as my lover, and we have a bond that goes beyond words like wife or girlfriend or mother,” Hanks said. “When I played Forrest Gump, who loved Jenny? Without my connection with Rita, I don’t know how I would’ve been able to connect with what Forrest was going through.”\n\nAs for Wilson, she’s pretty lucky too, as she revealed, “Sometimes we’re just sitting on the couch talking or something like that...I don’t even have to ask for them. He always gives me back and foot rubs.”\n\nHanks explained further that their successful relationship is due to timing, maturity, and willingness to connect on a deeper level. He admitted that he knew it would require some changes when he married Wilson.\n\nHe admitted that maybe fate had a hand in bringing them together, but he clarified that their relationship isn’t the stuff of fairy tales. Their connection is as real and solid as he is sitting there. Marriage can be challenging, he acknowledged, but they’re in it for the long haul and will always have each other’s backs no matter what."
