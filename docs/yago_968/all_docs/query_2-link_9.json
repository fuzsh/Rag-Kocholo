News' Francesca Amiker with a smile. \"How about that.\" (For more from Tom and Rita, tune into to E! News April 11 at 11 p.m.)\n\nThe parents of Chet, 33, and Truman, 28, were all smiles as they hit the red carpet as the honorary chairs of \"An Unforgettable Evening\" benefiting the Women's Cancer Research Fund. The cause is near and dear to them, especially for Rita, who underwent a double mastectomy for breast cancer in 2015.\n\n\"It takes a village,\" Rita told E! about supporting cancer research. \"And this community in our town of Los Angeles, California has turned out for 25 years to support this cause. We don't do it alone.\""
