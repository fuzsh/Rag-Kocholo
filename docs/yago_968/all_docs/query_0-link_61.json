        "text": "The Oscar-winning Hollywood star Tom Hanks has captivated the audience with his exceptional performances throughout his decades-long career. As much as the actor is celebrated for his on-screen performances, fans also adore his lovely relationship with his wife Rita Wilson. In contrast to the often-tabloid-ridden love lives of popular Hollywood stars, the actor has not been linked with too many names. Before Wilson, he was married to actress Samantha Lewes, though the couple parted ways after nearly a decade into their marriage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead More: “He was greeted with a massive welcome celebration”: Did Tom Hanks Become a Jew and Move to Israel? Viral Video Has Internet Stumped\n\nTom Hanks’ Relations With Samantha Lewes\n\nBefore making his film debut in the 1980s, Tom Hanks landed his first acting job in The Taming of the Shrew, the same year he welcomed his eldest son, Colin Hanks, with Samantha Lewes. The Forrest Gump star and Lewes reportedly met at Sacramento State University.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike her ex-husband, Lewes was also an actress and producer, known for her brief appearances on Bosom Buddies and Mr. Success. The college sweethearts decided to tie the knot a year after welcoming their son in 1978. Hanks was 22 at the time of his first marriage and was yet to embark on his journey towards stardom.\n\nFour years into their marriage, the ex-couple welcomed their second child, Elizabeth Ann Hanks in 1982. While they started a family and were happily married, Hanks and Lewes decided to part ways in 1984 and finalized their divorce in 1987.\n\nRead More: Tom Hanks’ Unique Record of Playing 7 Roles in the Same Movie Matches Beverly Hills Cop Star Eddie Murphy Film That Many Fans Forgot\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy did Tom Hanks Break Up With Samantha Lewes?\n\nNot much is known about Tom Hanks’ marriage to Samantha Lewes. The couple was together for almost a decade before they parted ways in 1987. Talking about his split in an interview with Express, the actor shared that the lack of maturity in the relationship was one of the reasons for their split.\n\n“I was just too young and insecure for marriage,” he said before adding, “I was not really ready to take on those responsibilities.” Hanks, who grew up with his father after their parents divorced, expressed guilt after the separation as he did not want his kids to go through the same thing.\n\n“A broken marriage meant I was sentencing my own kids to the sort of feelings I had at their age,” he told the outlet. Despite their split, the former couple was on good terms. However, following their divorce, Samantha Lewes was diagnosed with terminal bone cancer in 2001, with doctors stating that she had only a few more months to live.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Greyhound star was “devastated” by the news and arranged for her to be treated by top bone cancer specialists at UCLA. Despite all the efforts, Lewes tragically passed away in 2002. Nothing much is available on Lewes’ perspective on their separation.\n\nRead More: “We don’t hang out for coffee”: Tom Hanks Made a Startling Revelation About Meg Ryan That Makes Their Chemistry More Surprising\n\nTom Hanks’ 35 Year Long Marriage With Rita Wilson\n\nA year after his split from Samantha Lewes, Tom Hanks got married to the singer-actress Rita Wilson. The couple first met on the set of Bosom Buddies in 1981. However, the sparks truly ignited during their collaboration on the 1985 film Volunteers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter finalizing his divorce from Lewes, Hanks and Wilson tied the knot in April 1988. Talking about his relationship with the Asteroid City actress, Hanks said, “The success of our relationship was a matter of timing, maturity, and our willingness to have an intimate connection.”\n\nHanks and Wilson once again shared the screen in the 1993 romantic comedy-drama Sleepless in Seattle and later collaborated for the 2002 film My Big Fat Greek Wedding. They welcomed their first child together, Chester Hanks, in 1990 and their youngest son, Truman Hanks, in 1995.\n\nThe couple continues to express their love for each other on several occasions and celebrated 35 years of their enduring bond in April 2023. “35 years of marriage. April 30, 1988. Love is everything,” Wilson mentioned in the caption of a heartfelt Instagram post."
