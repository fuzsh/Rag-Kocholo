        "text": "Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson are the definition of a Hollywood power couple.\n\nTheir relationship dates back four decades, when the two first met on the set of ABC’s sitcom Bosom Buddies in 1981. However, they were just friends at first, since at the time Hanks was married to his college sweetheart, Samantha Lewes. They went public with their relationship in 1986, and after two years of dating, Hanks and Wilson got married in 1988.\n\nAnd their love is still flourishing. On July 9, Wilson penned a sweet birthday message to her husband, and shared everything she adores about him, including some of Tom’s more unique qualities.\n\nMore info: Instagram\n\nTom Hanks turned 67 years old on Sunday\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: ritawilson\n\nAnd his wife, actor, singer and film producer Rita Wilson shared an incredibly sweet message to celebrate the occasion\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: ritawilson\n\nHanks and Wilson met on the set of Bosom Buddies in 1981, an ABC sitcom that Hanks had been starring in for two seasons, and even though Wilson only appeared in just one episode and Hanks was married at the time, she said they instantly hit it off as friends.\n\n“One of the things, when we met, was that we just got along instantly,” Wilson told Kelly Clarkson of her first impression of Hanks.\n\n“First of all, I love a good storyteller. So anybody who could tell a good story, I’m down with that … I love that. He makes me laugh all the time. He’s a great storyteller,” she then continued.\n\nWilson and Hanks have been together for 38 years\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: ritawilson\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: ritawilson\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: tomhanks\n\nHanks and Wilson reunited on set once again when they starred in 1985’s feature Volunteers. In the film, they played lovers in which Hanks later expressed that there was instant chemistry.\n\n“Rita and I just looked at each other and — kaboing — that was that,” he told GQ. “I asked Rita if it was the real thing for her, and it just couldn’t be denied.”\n\nThey’ve been married for 35 years\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: ritawilson\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: ritawilson\n\nHanks and Wilson made their red carpet debut as a couple at the premiere of Three Amigos in 1986, and although Hanks and Lewes officially divorced in 1987, they were broken up for a while before he and Wilson linked up.\n\nHanks and Wilson got married in April 1988, when she iconically wore an untraditional, short-length wedding dress.\n\n“The success of our relationship was a matter of timing, maturity and our willingness to have an intimate connection,” Hanks told Oprah Winfrey. “When I married Rita, I thought, ‘This is going to require some change on my part.’ I won’t deny that providence was part of us finding each other, but our relationship isn’t magic — the way it’s shown in movies.”\n\n“In real life, our connection is as concrete as me sitting here,” he added. “Not that marriage doesn’t come close to being hell in a handbasket sometimes. But we both know that no matter what, we’ll be with each other — and we’ll get through it.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: ritawilson\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: ritawilson\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: ritawilson\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: ritawilson\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: ritawilson\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: ritawilson\n\nTwo years after tying the knot, Hanks and Wilson welcomed their first child on the 4th of August, 1990. They named him Chester “Chet” Hanks, and he follows in the footsteps of his parents and has pursued a career in entertainment.\n\nHanks and Wilson welcomed their second son together on December 26, 1995. Named Truman Theodore Hanks, he also works in the entertainment industry — but instead of acting like his brother and parents, he spends his time behind the camera. Truman has worked in the camera and electrical department of notable TV series and films.\n\nAnd share two children together, Chet and Truman\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: ritawilson\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: ritawilson\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: ritawilson\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: ritawilson\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: ritawilson\n\nThe couple has continuously expressed their love for each other over the years, but one example really stands out. In 2012, Wilson opened up during an interview with Piers Morgan about one of the sweetest moments she had with her husband.\n\n“I’ll never forget, we were standing on the corner of 57th and 5th in New York, or 58th and 5th,” Wilson said. “We were holding hands, and we were waiting for the traffic light to change. And he looked at me and he said, ‘You know, I just want you to know that you never have to change anything about who you are in order to be with me.’ Literally, a wave of — if love is a feeling, or a cellular thing that happens to your body — it went through me, and that’s pretty much who he is, and how he’s been.”\n\nIn 2015, for every 1,000 married persons ages 50 and older, 10 divorced – up from five in 1990. Among those ages 65 and older, the divorce rate has roughly tripled since 1990, reaching six people per 1,000 married persons in 2015. But these two continue their journey, which is more impressive, since celebrity couples aren’t known for fostering the longest relationships.\n\nMany, including the couple’s famous friends, took to the comments to wish Hanks a happy birthday\n\nShare icon\n\nShare icon\n\nShare icon\n\nShare icon\n\nShare icon\n\nShare icon\n\nShare icon\n\nShare icon"
