        "text": "Rita Wilson and Tom Hanks have shared more sweet moments in their 30 plus year marriage than what you'd find in any rom-com.\n\nThe 63-year-old actors make up one of the industry's most beloved couples, and have been on more red carpet dates than we can count. Their latest? They appeared at the 77th annual Golden Globe Awards, where Hanks received the honorary Cecil B. DeMille Award for his monumental contributions to entertainment. During his acceptance speech, Hanks teared up while thanking his family.\n\nAnd as many stars in Tinseltown, their love story began on the set of the ABC TV series, , in the '80s. In honor of the power coupleâ€™s relationship and their ability to overcome even the toughest of times, hereâ€™s a look at the enduring love story of Hanks and Wilson.\n\n1972: Hanks first developed a crush on Wilson when he saw her on The Brady Bunch.\n\nIn the early '70s, Wilson made her acting debut as cheerleader Pat Conway on the family sitcom, . Apparently, her pom-pom skills caught the eye of then 16-year-old Hanks.\n\n\"I was actually at a friend of mineâ€™s house when it aired and I remember thinking 'that girlâ€™s cute,\" Hanks shared with reporters at the 2016 New York City premiere of , which the couple produced together. But Hanks didn't act on his feelings until the mid-1980s.\n\n1981: Hanks and Wilson actually met on the set of Bosom Buddies.\n\nHanks first laid eyes on his future wife-to-be from the comfort of his friend's couch. But in 1981, he finally got the chance to meet Wilson in person while filming the ABC comedy, , that he starred in for two seasons. Wilson appeared as a guest on an episode about a video dating service, and Hanks immediately felt a connection, according to People.\n\n\"Rita and I just looked at each other andâ€”kaboingâ€”that was that,\" he said. \"I asked Rita if it was the real thing for her, and it just couldn't be denied.\"\n\n1985: Hanks and Wilson starred in their first movie together.\n\nAs fate would have it, Hanks and Wilson would find themselves paired together in the 1985 comedy, . Proving that his nice guy act carries off-screen as well, Hanks had nothing but complimentary things to say about Wilson after filming the movie.\n\n\"When we first looked at each other there was definitely a kind of like, 'Hey, this is the place!' I felt that, anyway,\" Hanks told Entertainment Tonight in 2015. \"I think the end result is that we got married for all the right reasons.\"\n\nTom Hanks and Rita Wilson in Volunteers.\n\nHowever, the actors didn't take their chemistry off-screen, choosing to remain friends instead. At the time, Hanks was still married to his college sweetheart, Samantha Lewes. She passed away in 2002 of bone cancer. Hanks and his late ex-wife had two children together before divorcing in 1987, actor Colin Hanks, 41, and Elizabeth Hanks, 34, who is also an actress and former Huffington Post editor.\n\nDecember 1986: Hanks and Wilson went public with their relationship.\n\nAfter working together on , the two lovebirds made their debut as a couple at the Three Amigos premiere. While Hanks was still legally married to Lewes, they were separated.\n\n\"I was looking for something I had not found as a kid,\" Hanks reportedly told the UK Express. \"And a broken marriage meant I was sentencing my own kids to the sort of feelings I had at their age. I was just too young and insecure for marriage. I was 23 and my son Colin was already two when I married for the first time. I was not really ready to take on those responsibilities.\"\n\nAt the time of their separation, Colin was 7 and Elizabeth was 3. Hanks and Lewes's divorce was finalized in 1987.\n\nApril 1988: Wilson and Hanks get their wedding.\n\nOn April 30, 1988, the happy couple tied the knot. Nearly 30 years later, they're still in love and supportive of each other, both in front of the camera and off-screen.\n\n\"The success of our relationship was a matter of timing, maturity, and our willingness to have an intimate connection,\" Hanks told his friend Oprah in 2001. \"When I married Rita, I thought, 'This is going to require some change on my part.'\"\n\nHanks continued: \"I won't deny that providence was part of us finding each other, but our relationship isn't magicâ€”the way it's shown in movies. In real life, our connection is as concrete as me sitting here. Not that marriage doesn't come close to being hell in a handbasket sometimes. But we both know that no matter what, we'll be with each otherâ€”and we'll get through it.\"\n\nLittle did he know, exactly 14 years later from his interview with Oprah, he and his wife would face their biggest hurdle yet, when Wilson was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015.\n\nMarch 1989: The newlyweds attended their first Oscars ceremony together.\n\nFresh off the heels of their \"I do's,\" the couple walked the red carpet at the 1989 Academy Awards. Hanks was nominated for his performance in the feel-good, body-swap film, . And right by his side was Wilson. Just two months before, in January 1989, Hanks gushed over his wife at the Golden Globes, while accepting the trophy for Actor in a Musical or Comedy for .\n\n\"I married a Greek babe,\" he started his speech. \"She was born right here in California, right here in Hollywood, but her folks are great, she's marvelous, Rita Wilsonâ€”thank you, babe, for marrying me. You made my year already, but thank you, Hollywood Foreign Press.\"\n\nAugust 1990: Hanks and Wilson welcome their first child.\n\nOn August 4, 1990, Hanks and Wilson welcomed their son, Chester \"Chet\" Marlon Hanks, into the world.
