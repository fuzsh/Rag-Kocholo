        "text": "In 1972, Wilson made her acting debut on The Brady Bunch. She played cheerleader Pat Conway and, according to Hanks, he was instantly taken with her. According to People, the actor revealed at the premiere of My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 in 2016, \"I was actually at a friend of mine’s house when it aired and I remember thinking 'that girl’s cute.'\"\n\nHanks and Wilson costarred in 1985 movie Volunteers. Filming throughout 1984, apparently the connection between the pair was obvious. Costar Xander Berkeley told People, \"You could tell they were fond of each other.\"\n\nHanks later told GQ (via People), \"Rita and I just looked at each other and—kaboing—that was that... I asked Rita if it was the real thing for her, and it just couldn’t be denied.\"\n\nThe actor took his romance with Wilson public in July 1986 at the Nothing in Common premiere [pictured].\n\nHanks' divorce from Lewes wasn't finalized until 1987, per E! News. The Big star told the Express in 2013, \"And a broken marriage meant I was sentencing my own kids to the sort of feelings I had at their age. I was just too young and insecure for marriage. I was 23 and my son Colin was already 2 when I married for the first time. I was not really ready to take on those responsibilities.\"\n\nThe couple got hitched in April 1988, and Wilson looked honestly iconic in her short wedding gown [pictured].\n\nOf his marriage to Wilson, Hanks told Entertainment Tonight, “When we first looked at each other there was definitely a kind of (pointing to camera), ‘Hey, this is the place!’ I felt that anyway... I think the end result is that we got married for all the right reasons.”\n\nIn 2001, Hanks told Oprah, \"When I married Rita, I thought, This is going to require some change on my part... Not that marriage doesn't come close to being hell in a handbasket sometimes. But we both know that no matter what, we'll be with each other—and we'll get through it.\"\n\nWilson supported Hanks at the Oscars on March 29, 1989, where he was nominated for the Best Actor Academy Award for his role in Big. He lost to Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man.\n\nAlso in 1989, Hanks paid tribute to his wife during his speech at the Golden Globes, after winning a Best Actor award. He said, \"I married a Greek babe. She was born right here in California, right here in Hollywood, but her folks are great, she's marvelous, Rita Wilson—thank you, babe, for marrying me. You made my year already, but thank you, Hollywood Foreign Press.\"\n\nPictured at the Elton John AIDS Foundation Party after the 66th Annual Academy Awards on March 21, 1994. Hanks took home the Best Actor Oscar for his role in Philadelphia. In his speech, he said of his wife, \"I could not be standing here without that undying love that was just sung about by, not Bruce Springsteen, but Neil Young. And I have that in a lover that is so close to fine we should all be able to experience such heaven right here on earth.\"\n\nJust a year after his Philadelphia Oscar win, Hanks took home the Best Actor Academy Award yet again, this time for his performance in Forrest Gump. In his acceptance speech at the ceremony on March 27, 1995, Hanks said, \"I am standing here because the woman I share my life with has taught me and demonstrates for me every day just what love is,\" via BBC.\n\nHanks and Wilson produced their first project together: , which was released in 2002. The couple would later produce Mamma Mia! and its sequel, too.\n\nAccording to The Knot, it's all thanks to Wilson that My Big Fat Greek Wedding got made. The site reported that Hanks said on the red carpet for the movie's sequel, \"My wife saw an ad back in the day in the LA Times calendar section for a one woman show called My Big Fat Greek Wedding and she laughed and said ‘I’m going to go see the show,’ and she did.” He continued, \"She came home and said, ‘I think that’s a movie,’ and it was.\"\n\nIn 2015, Wilson announced that she'd been diagnosed with breast cancer. She told People in a statement, \"Last week, with my husband by my side, and with the love and support of family and friends, I underwent a bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction for breast cancer after a diagnosis of invasive lobular carcinoma. I am recovering and most importantly, expected to make a full recovery. Why? Because I caught this early, have excellent doctors and because I got a second opinion.\"\n\nWilson later revealed to The New York Times, \"You never know how your spouse is going to react in a situation like this... I was so amazed, so blown away by the care my husband gave me... who knew it would make you even closer?\"\n\nWhen Wilson released her in 2016, she told E! News that her husband had accompanied her on tour. She explained, \"We've gone all over the world. We've taken our family. We've gotten to live in cities that you normally wouldn't get to live in and become a normal person and going to the market and finding your favorite coffee shop. Just pretending that you're a local and that's really great. You don't feel rushed.\""
