Slight fevers too.\n\n\"To play things right, as is needed in the world right now, we were tested for the coronavirus, and were found to be positive.\"\n\nHe added: \"Well now. What to do next? The Medical Officials have protocols that must be followed.\n\n\"We Hanks will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires.\n\nHe continued: \"Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no?\n\n\"We'll keep the world posted and updated.
