        "text": "Apparently, Tom Hanks just can't relate to divorce woes.\n\nHanks' wife of 35 years Rita Wilson revealed that the actor turned down iconic rom-com \"When Harry Met Sally\" because of his own feelings about divorce, she said on a podcast this week.\n\n\"People probably donâ€™t know this, but Tom was offered 'When Harry Met Sally,'\" Wilson said on \"Table for Two with Bruce Bozzi\" in a Tuesday episode.\n\nHanks was offered the lead role of Harry Burns, which eventually went to Billy Crystal. Crystal starred alongside Meg Ryan in the iconic will-they-won't-they 1989 film about a pair of close friends who wonder if being \"just friends\" is possible for them.\n\nWilson said Hanks turned a role in the movie down because the lead character was newly heartbroken over a divorce. Hanks \"was going through a divorce and he was very happy to be not married,\" she said.\n\n\"So he could not understand that a person going through a divorce would (feel) anything other than just like, 'I'm so happy,'\" she joked.\n\nHanks divorced actress Samantha Lewes in 1987, after nine years of marriage. Hanks and Wilson wed in 1988.\n\nWhile Wilson may have questions about some of her husband's career choices, she was a huge fan of his most recent film \"Asteroid City,\" gushing about the movie at its New York red carpet premiere. Directed by Wes Anderson, the charming alien story is set in a desert town (in New York and Los Angeles theaters Friday before a wide release on June 23).\n\nWilson, who is a musician, told USA TODAY at the premiere that she \"loved the music in the movie\" in particular. \"Wes gets these great people around him, and they all play (the film's) cowboy musicians,\" she said. The troupe plays folk songs alongside Asteroid City visitors during the movie.\n\nThe country artist most recently released the single \"Little Black Dress\" earlier this month. \"This song is meant to tell a story for the little black dress that every woman has in her closet,\" the singer wrote on social media.\n\nContributing: Elise Brisco"
