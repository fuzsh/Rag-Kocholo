        "text": "American movie stars Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson have officially become citizens of Greece, the country's prime minister has announced.\n\nThe couple posed for a picture with their new passports alongside Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and his wife.\n\nThe PM posted the picture on Instagram on Saturday. Hanks and Wilson \"are now proud Greek citizens\", he wrote.\n\nGreek media said the meeting took place on the island of Antiparos.\n\nHanks, Wilson and their children were granted honorary Greek citizenship last year for their role in bringing attention to a devastating wildfire near Athens in July 2018.\n\nThe wildfire ripped through the seaside village of Mati, killing more than 100 people.\n\nAllow Instagram content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Instagram .

I've been around the world, I've been to the most beautiful places in the world, none of them tops Greece. The land, the sky, the water, it's good for the soul, it's a healing place.\""
