        "text": "The definition of a Hollywood power couple.\n\nTom Hanks and Rita Wilson first met on the set of ABC's sitcom Bosom Buddies in 1981.\n\nThough they were just friends at first, since Hanks was married to his college sweetheart Samantha Lewes at the time, they later went public with their relationship in 1986.\n\nAfter two years of dating, Hanks and Wilson got married in 1988. They went on to welcome two kids together, Chester \"Chet\" Hanks and Truman Theodore Hanks.\n\nThe Forest Gump actor is also a father to Colin Hanks and Elizabeth Hanks, whom he shared with Lewes, who died of bone cancer in 2002.\n\nFrom friends to 30-plus years of marriage, here's a timeline of Hanks and Wilson's sweet love story.\n\n1981: Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson First Meet\n\nHanks and Wilson first met on the set of Bosom Buddies in 1981, an ABC sitcom that Hanks had been starring in for two seasons. While Wilson only appeared in one episode and Hanks was married at the time, Wilson said they instantly hit it off as friends.\n\n\"One of the things, when we met, was that we just got along instantly,\" Wilson told Kelly Clarkson in 2020 of her first impression of Hanks. \"First of all, I love a good storyteller,\" she continued. \"So anybody who could tell a good story, I'm down with that. ... I love that. He makes me laugh all the time. He's a great storyteller.\"\n\nAugust 1985: Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson Star in Their First Film Together\n\nHanks and Wilson reunited on set once again for their first feature together in 1985's Volunteers. In the film, they played lovers in which Hanks later expressed that there was instant chemistry.\n\n\"Rita and I just looked at each other and — kaboing — that was that,\" Hanks told GQ. \"I asked Rita if it was the real thing for her, and it just couldn't be denied.\"\n\nDecember 1986: Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson Make Their Red Carpet Debut\n\nHanks and Wilson made their red carpet debut as a couple at the premiere of Three Amigos in 1986.

I won't deny that providence was part of us finding each other, but our relationship isn't magic — the way it's shown in movies.\"\n\nHe added, \"In real life, our connection is as concrete as me sitting here. Not that marriage doesn't come close to being hell in a handbasket sometimes. But we both know that no matter what, we'll be with each other — and we'll get through it.\"\n\nAugust 1990: Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson Welcome Their First Child Together\n\nTwo years after tying the knot, Hanks and Wilson welcomed their first child on Aug. 4, 1990.

And he looked at me and he said, 'You know, I just want you to know, that you never have to change anything about who you are in order to be with me.' Literally, a wave of — if love is a feeling, or a cellular thing that happens to your body — it went through me, and that's pretty much who he is, and how he's been.\"\n\nApril 2015: Tom Hanks Supports Rita Wilson During Hard Times\n\nWilson revealed to PEOPLE in 2015 that she had undergone a double mastectomy and reconstruction after being diagnosed with breast cancer — and although she was concerned at first about how her husband would react, she was relieved by his response.\n\n\"You never know how your spouse is going to react in a situation like this,\" Wilson told the New York Times. \"I was so amazed, so blown away by the care my husband gave me ... who knew it would make you even closer?\"\n\nApril 2018: Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson Celebrate Their 30th Wedding Anniversary\n\nHanks and Wilson celebrated their 30th wedding anniversary with a star-studded bash in April 2018, including Hollywood A-listers such as Oprah Winfrey, Kate Hudson, Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell, Conan O'Brien, Martin Short, Isla Fisher, and Jimmy Kimmel.\n\nMarch 2019: Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson Attend Her Walk of Fame Ceremony\n\nIn 2019, Hanks supported Wilson during her Hollywood Walk of Fame star ceremony.
