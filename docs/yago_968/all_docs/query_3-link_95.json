I won't deny that providence was part of us finding each other, but our relationship isn't magic — the way it's shown in movies.\n\n\"In real life, our connection is as concrete as me sitting here.\n\n\"Not that marriage doesn't come close to being hell in a handbasket sometimes. But we both know that no matter what, we'll be with each other — and we'll get through it.\"\n\nDo Rita Wilson and Tom Hanks have kids?\n\nThe couple have two sons, Chester and Truman, and Tom has two children from a previous relationship, Colin and Elizabeth Hanks.\n\nShe is also grandma and step-grandma to three children.\n\nWhat do we know about Rita Wilson and Tom Hanks' coronavirus diagnosis?\n\nThe Hollywood actor took to Instagram on Thursday March 12, telling fans the couple had both started to feel unwell while he was filming in Australia.\n\nHe wrote: \"Hello, folks.
