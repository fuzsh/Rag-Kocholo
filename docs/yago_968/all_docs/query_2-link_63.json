        "text": "Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson just celebrated 35 years of marriage together — and they made sure to share the sweet love with a heartfelt social media post. Wilson took to Instagram on Sunday, April 30, to share a photo of herself along with Hanks and a cute yellow cake that reads “Happy Anniversary.”\n\n“35 years of marriage. April 30 1988. Love is everything,” Wilson captioned the post. Hanks holds the cake and looks at his wife with what seems to be pure adoration in the sweet snap celebrating their wedding anniversary.\n\nCelebrity friends joined in on the celebration via the comments, congratulating Wilson for her and Hanks’ longstanding commitment to each other. “Happy anniversary, Rita! Congratulations!,” wrote Jennifer Garner. “HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!!! So happy for you both. ❤️❤️,” added Will & Grace actor Sean Hayes.\n\nThe singer-songwriter and actor first met on the set of ABC’s series Bosom Buddies back in 1981. At the time, Hanks was still married to his college sweetheart Samantha Lewes.\n\nIt wasn’t until Hanks and Wilson worked together again on 1985’s Volunteers that the two started to acknowledge there was something going on between them. “Rita and I just looked at each other and — kaboing — that was that,” Hanks told GQ per People. “I asked Rita if it was the real thing for her, and it just couldn’t be denied.”\n\nAfter his divorce from Lewes was finalized, Hanks and Wilson started dating. The two went public with their relationship in 1986 and got married two years later in 1988. The longterm couple has two kids together, Chet Hanks, 32, and Truman Hanks, 27. Wilson also is a step-mom to Hanks’ older kids, Colin, 45, and Elizabeth, 40, from his previous relationship.\n\nLong-lasting relationships take work, but the payoff is extra sweet, according to Hanks.\n\n“The success of our relationship was a matter of timing, maturity, and our willingness to have an intimate connection,” Hanks told Oprah in 2001. “When I married Rita, I thought, ‘This is going to require some change on my part.'”\n\nHanks continued: “I won’t deny that providence was part of us finding each other, but our relationship isn’t magic—the way it’s shown in movies. In real life, our connection is as concrete as me sitting here. Not that marriage doesn’t come close to being hell in a hand basket sometimes. But we both know that no matter what, we’ll be with each other—and we’ll get through it.”\n\nCongrats to the happy couple!"
