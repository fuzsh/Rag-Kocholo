        "text": "Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson have a lot to celebrate!\n\nOn Tuesday, the couple marked their 36th wedding anniversary with a series of sweet tributes.\n\n\"1988? April 30th? Big Doings. The Wilson & Hanks couple became Wife & Husband. 36 years! Nothing but Love since… Hanx,\" the Oscar-winning actor wrote alongside a selfie of him and Wilson snapped while they were on a boat.\n\nFor her tribute, the Asteroid City actress used a series of sweet pictures to put her love with her leading man on display.\n\n\"36th anniversary! April 30,1988. 'Grow old along with me; the best is yet to be.' – Robert Browning,\" the \"Throw Me a Party\" singer captioned the post.\n\nWilson's carousel of photos led with a picture of her and Hanks dancing while they look at the camera and followed with a series of travel selfies, pictures of moments in the studio and ended with a silly photo of them laughing in the car.\n\nWilson and Hanks, both 67, first met in 1981 on the set of the series Bosom Buddies. Together, the pair are parents of sons Truman, 28, and Chet, 33. Hanks is the father of Elizabeth, 41, and Colin, 46, from his first marriage.\n\nOver the course of their decades-long romance, Hanks and Wilson have worked together on screen and behind the scenes on films. The pair also stuck together through Wilson's 2015 breast cancer diagnosis.\n\nIn January 2023, Hanks and Wilson teased what was to be expected from their 35th wedding anniversary celebration -- after marking their 30th milestone with a massive party.\n\n\"That's coming up! That's coming up, yeah,\" the Forrest Gump star said, beaming, before recalling the pair's blow-out 30th anniversary, gushing, \"That was something else.\"\n\n\"You know, it's funny, it seems like it was last year. But that's how fast things go along,\" Hanks added. \"But that was such a great party, that people who were not at that party claimed to have been at that party. That's how good of a party it was.\"\n\nFor her part when speaking to ET, Wilson remained mum about the possible celebration.\n\n\"That is a big secret,\" Wilson said with a smile when asked about any big plans.\n\nFor more on Tom and Rita's romance, click below."
