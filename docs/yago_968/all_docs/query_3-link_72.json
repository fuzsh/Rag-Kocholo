        "text": "Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson’s Los Angeles home has been burglarized, local news outlets reported on Monday (August 5).\n\nThe celebrity couple were not home at the time of the theft.\n\nThe break-in occurred in a guest house next to the couple’s main home, the Los Angeles Times reported, citing police sources. They did not enter the main house.\n\nIt is unknown what was taken from the property. So far no arrests have been made.\n\nThe Independent has contacted representatives for Hank and Wilson for comment.\n\nThe incident is the latest in a string of high-profile burglaries in the area. ABC News reports more than a dozen home break-ins have been reported in the San Fernando Valley in the past few weeks.\n\nOther celebrities including Bhad Bhabie, Sarah Hyland and Marlon Wayans’s homes have recently been targeted; however, ABC reports that investigators don’t believe the burglars knew it was Hanks’s home they were robbing.\n\nThere have currently been no arrests but suspects are believed to be part of the crews that have been burglarizing high-end neighborhoods in recent weeks.\n\nWilson recently took to her Instagram on Sunday to wish her and Hanks’s son Chet a happy 34th birthday. “You came out curious, alert, aware. You always have and always do make us laugh so hard,” her caption read alongside a series of photos.\n\nThe Hollywood couple, who have been married since 1988, also share 28-year-old son Truman Hanks. Tom is a father to three children from his previous marriage to ex-wife Samantha Lewes: Colin Hanks, 46, and Elizabeth Ann Hanks, 41. Lewes, who was married to the actor for nearly 10 years, died in 2002 following a battle with bone cancer.\n\nOver the years, Hanks and Wilson have owned homes in Malibu and the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles County, as well as in Sun Valley, Idaho, and in Greece. In fact, Hanks and Wilson were involved so heavily in efforts to help the country recover from wildfires in 2018 that they were awarded honorary Greek citizenship the following year.\n\nIn 2016, the couple sold side-by-side estates in Pacific Palisades for a combined $18m."
