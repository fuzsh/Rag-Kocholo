Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson were married in 1988 and, this year, are celebrating their 35 year wedding anniversary.

How has their marriage stood the test of time in Hollywood? We find out.

Hanks converted to Rita’s faith, the Greek Orthodox Church, and had two sons Truman Theodore Hanks and Chester Hanks.

Since the beginning, the couple have been singing each other’s praises.

In 1989, Hanks won a Golden Globe for Best Actor and in his acceptance speech said: “I married a Greek babe. She was born right here in California, right here in Hollywood, but her folks are great, she’s marvellous, Rita Wilson — thank you, babe, for marrying me.”

The couple bought a home in Greece in 2004, on the island of Antiparos. In 2018, they bought a second home on the island of Patmos.

Nowadays, the pair are currently producing the highly anticipated film My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3 to be released in September this year. They also produced the hit films My Big Fat Greek Wedding and My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2.

In 2019, Hanks and his family received honorary Greek citizenship.
