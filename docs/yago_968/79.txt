Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson are one of the few Hollywood couples who have managed to stay together for an impressive 38 years.

The couple first met in 1981 on the set of the sitcom Bosom Buddies. However, at that time Tom was married to his college sweetheart Samantha Lewes.

Tom and Rita crossed paths again in 1985 when they starred in the film Volunteers but, again, Tom was still married to Samantha.

But, as fate would have it, Tom ended up separating from Samantha shortly after Volunteers, and Tom and Rita made their red carpet debut in 1986 at the premiere of Three Amigos.

They tied the knot just two years later in April 1988 – with Rita wearing a still-talked about short-length wedding dress – and the rest is history.

Tom and Rita now share two children, Chester and Truman, have starred in 6 films together, the most recent being Wes Anderson’s Asteroid City, and celebrated their 35th wedding anniversary in 2023.
