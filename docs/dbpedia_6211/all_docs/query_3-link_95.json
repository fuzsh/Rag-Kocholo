        "text": "Just as it sounds. As revealed by the journalist José Manuel Puertas de Ideal of Granada, Will Barton has reached an agreement with Covirán Granada to play the remainder of the 2023-24 campaign in the ACB League; that is, in Spain.\n\nWith 10 games left to continue fighting for permanence, the Nasrid team has chosen the 33-year-old veteran forward to reinforce itself and try to take the final step towards salvation. Currently, with a balance of 7-17, Covirán Granada is one game ahead of the relegation places.\n\nThe truth is that the incorporation of Barton, in the absence of official confirmation and checking his state of form, seems a great success on the part of the Andalusian squad, which takes on a player who has spent 12 seasons in the NBA to play a total of 679 games with four different franchises. In that period he has averaged 11,2 points, 4,1 rebounds and 2,7 assists.\n\nBarton's arrival at Granada comes weeks after a failed adventure at CSKA Moscow. Announced as the Russians' star signing at the end of January, he did not make his debut, as they opted to terminate his contract.\n\n(Photo by Scott Taetsch/Getty Images)"
