I regard it as a privilege and a challenge which I look forward to.\"\n\nBarton was ratified as manager by the county committee on Tuesday night with his backroom team yet to be confirmed.\n\nThe 53-year-old has managed a number of club sides including Ballinderry and Slaughtneil.\n\n\"Damian Barton brings a wealth of playing and coaching experience to the position, as well as an in-depth knowledge of Derry football,\" said the county.\n\n\"On behalf of all members, supporters and patrons of Derry GAA, we warmly welcome Damian and wish him every success in his future endeavours.\"\n\nThe county hurling and minor football manager positions are unchanged.\n\nAn announcement regarding the U21 football manager will be made at a later date."
