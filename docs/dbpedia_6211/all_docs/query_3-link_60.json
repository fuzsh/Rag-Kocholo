I have taken all sorts of photos and within the past few years have become the head studio photographer for my full time job.  On a daily basis I take full length, group and individual portraits for the employees of the building. These photos are used in their bios, internal newsletter, award ceremonies, service records, leadership  boards and other various things.  I also provide creative photos used for signage for digital and print products. I have taken a few classes and am constantly shooting and learning. I currently have a Nikon D7100. I utilize my eye on the weekends shooting little league team photos. I have also taken photos for retirement functions, birthday parties and other events.",
