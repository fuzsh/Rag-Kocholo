        "text": "Barton thinks. And speaks his mind. Steven Doherty reports from the Athletic Grounds WHILE he was glad to back on the Derry sidelines where he can at least affect the game, Derry manager Damian Barton was disappointed to lose to Armagh on Sunday. In a game that had much more significance to an in the end relegated Armagh, Barton, did, however, believe that it was game that his side could have won. “We were eight points down at half-time and we got it back to three points and we were in apposition to and win the game,” the Derry manager explained. “I just thought we over-elaborated with our decision making. I know we threw a couple of lads in today that haven’t played a lot of football and it showed. I’m not being disrespectful to them, mind you. I think we did well where we were at half-time by comparison to bringing it back to three points because we knew Armagh needed eleven. “It’s a difficult situation. We knew we had to focus on the win. We could have won the match. Equally we could have lost it. We had opportunities in the final third. In summation I wasn’t happy with the way we played in the second half. We started off very well and then we conceded three or four points. We were allowing them to come on. They scored a couple of great scores. The goal was a bit of a sucker. But sure that’s the way it is.” The 53 year old was glad to swerve relegation, and believes that Division Two is the most arable land to sew the seeds of future growth. “I think it’s a cruel league, if you are sitting where Armagh is today. It’s a league of fine margins. If you consider late goals and points against Laois and Meath last week in a game we should have won. We can only concentrate on ourselves and look at how we can score so much but our concession of scores is quire incredible. I think the overall impression, and I know I talked about possible Division One and we are a Division Two team. We can develop in Division Two. I’m happy we didn’t go down.” Barton also called for a change to the current county timetable.” I think it’s ridiculous. I think a championship/league combination should be the way. There are teams that will never play the Dublins, the Kerrys, whoever in Division One. And it’s not fair. We should have a league championship, condense our season. This is nonsense that we are waiting now six weeks to play our championship season, absolute nonsense. Then the break if you are going through the back door. But it suits the powers that be.” As for his own county, the Derry manager also called for a sea change in what he called the ‘culture’ of commitment to the county. “I think there is a huge cultural change that needs to take place in Derry, I don’t mind saying that. We haven’t had underage success for a while. You look at the teams that are going well – Galway, Cavan, Roscommon. There’s players coming through from underage that obviously know each other, socialise with each other, know each other’s game, develop with each other in every way. We need that success at underage. And we need to look at our structures at how we bring players through. We don’t forget about them until next season, that they are brought on as under 21s or under 20s. I think we have a lot of work to do there and I think that then there will be a bit more potency in your level. Because we have some fantastic players. I think it’s just the buy-in, the culture. And that has been difficult this year in the league. The players have been fantastic, really fantastic. Everyone wants to play at this level but you can’t play everyone. They should have an expectation of playing. It requires an awful lot from players who are sitting on the bench who are there in the squad. So that is proving difficult as well. “Our Under 21s went out of the championship a couple of weeks ago and you lift some of the Under 21s and their immediate commitment is to their clubs. The clubs have been very kind to us by releasing players because they are their players at the end of the day. But whenever you get a situation where 50% of them don’t want to come to senior training after an Under 21 competition, that culture has to change. We have developed players from under 15, under 16 right through to senior. They should have a commitment to this county. And the sooner we change that culture instead of letting people walk away, having invested so much time and energy in them. That has to change, and that change is not in Derry at the minute.” Asked how we can change that culture, and Barton replied: “Yeah, we win at underage level. And everything that goes with it. There is a bond, a commitment to each other. And that’s why underage is so vital. Derry minors did fantastically well last year. I hope and I believe that they can build on that comradery and quality of game. We need to bring a game pattern through from minor, Under 21 to senior that is consistent. I know that is something Brian McIver is looking at. It’s big. It’s a massive, massive task. I’m just a custodian. I don’t mind telling you, players have got to want to play for this county. Club football in Derry is huge. Derry clubs have gone into Ulster football and all done well. Someone else from another club is looking at these clubs and thinking ‘we can beat these clubs’. Clubs are investing a lot too in terms of personnel and facilities. Our club season starts next week as most counties do and we’ll be as kind to the clubs as possible. And hopefully that is reciprocated. At the end of the day we want to send players back better. Physically prepared, technically a bit more astute. We have an obligation to do that for the club.” Having spoken to the assembled press pack for over ten minutes, Barton reassured Derry fans that his team will be ready for the 22nd May. “We’re as ready as we’re going to be. At the end of the day, I don’t care if we are playing Tyrone. We’re representing this county. I’m very disappointed today because I don’t think we’ve seen the full talent of all of our players. I’m happy enough with where we are. There are so many permeables – people can get hurt. There are club fixtures and the players are going to be going ding dong in those. I think our league (form) has no significance in where we are.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW"
