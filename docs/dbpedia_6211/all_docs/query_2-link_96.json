        "text": "Damien Woody is a two-time Super Bowl Champion offensive lineman and current ESPN analyst. He appears on NFL Live, SportsCenter and other ESPN programs.\n\nA 12-year NFL veteran, Woody played in 173 career games – starting all but seven – for the New England Patriots (1999-2003), Detroit Lions (2004-07) and New York Jets (2008-10).\n\nSelected as a center by the Patriots with the No. 17 overall pick in the 1999 NFL Draft, Woody started all 16 regular season games as a rookie and was part of two Super Bowl winning teams (2001 and 2003). He also earned a Pro Bowl selection in 2002.\n\nWoody moved to guard, and then tackle later in his career. He signed with the Lions in 2004 before returning to the AFC East as a member of the rival Jets, a squad he helped lead to the 2009 AFC Championship game.\n\nAs a player, Woody participated in the NFL’s Broadcast Boot Camp in 2009. Upon announcing his retirement from pro football in August of 2011, he immediately made the transition to ESPN television analyst.\n\nA native of Beaverdam, Va., Woody was an All-American and an All-Big East offensive lineman at Boston College. As a prep, he helped lead Patrick Henry High School in Ashland, Va., to the 1994 State Championship.\n\nIn 2014, Woody was a participant on NBC’s The Biggest Loser: Glory Days. During the reality show’s six-month competition, he lost 107 pounds.\n\nWoody currently lives in New Jersey with his wife, Nicole, and their children."
