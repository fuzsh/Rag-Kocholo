He loves the physicality of Wheelchair rugby and travelling around the world meeting awesome people along the way.\n\nHayden has had the opportunity to play in the Australian (South Australian Sharks) and Japanese (Tokyo Suns) domestic competitions.\n\nHe was selected to the Wheel Blacks squad for the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games – the team’s first appearance at the Paralympics for 13 years . The team placed 8th overall and gained valuable experience to build on for their journey to Paris 2024.\n\nHayden is working towards a Bachelor in Sports Science and hopes to work within the industry once he graduates.\n\nHayden also plays wheelchair basketball for the Auckland team, and he sees this as an opportunity to complement his Wheelchair rugby."
