Four of those players - Marcus Douthit (Providence College/2004 Los Angeles Lakers 2nd round, 56th overall), Ryan Gomes (Providence College/2005 Boston Celtics 2nd round, 50th overall) Will Blalock (Iowa State/2006 Detroit Pistons 2nd round, 30th overall) and Michael Beasley (Kansas State/2008 Miami Heat 1st round, 2nd overall) were drafted by NBA teams.\n\nSome of the other prominent names who played for Barton include: Modibo Diarra (Memphis), Chester Frazier (Illinois), Paul Harris (Syracuse), Lazar Hayward (Marquette), Gary Ervin (Arkansas) and Carl Krauser (Pitt).\n\nBarton, who completed his undergraduate degree in business at Salem State in 1989, added a master[apos]s in business administration from Suffolk University in 1991. Barton put those degrees to work at Notre Dame Prep, where he also served as the school principal and athletic director as well as an English teacher.\n\nBarton and his wife, Susan, have two daughters, Maeve and Nell."
