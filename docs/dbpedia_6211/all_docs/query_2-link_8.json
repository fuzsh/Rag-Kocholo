        "text": "Derry has announced Damian Barton as the county's new senior football manager for a two-year term, taking over from Brian McIver, who stepped down after the qualifier defeat to Galway.\n\nA highly respected All-Ireland winner with Derry in 1993, Barton brings a wealth of playing and coaching experience to the position, as well as an in-depth knowledge of Derry football. His backroom team will be confirmed in due course.\n\nBarton said: “I’m honoured to accept the responsibility that goes with this role. I regard it as a privilege and a challenge which I am very much looking forward to.”"
