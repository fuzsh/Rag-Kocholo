        "text": "The Nuggets have climbed steadily over the past three seasons — from 33 wins to 40 to 46 — in large part because of the season-over-season growth of a young roster. That was no different this year, when Barton (27 years old), Jamal Murray (21), Gary Harris (23) and Nikola Jokic (23) all took major leaps. But who improved the most? This week we’ll be breaking down each of those four candidates for the team’s most improved player. Today, we begin with Barton, whose rise in efficiency led to a career season.\n\nBarton’s 2016-17 averages: 13.7 points, 4.3 rebounds, 3.4 assists, 0.8 steals, 44.3 field-goal percentage, 37.0 3-point percentage, 75.3 free-throw percentage, 28.4 minutes.\n\nBarton’s 2017-18 averages: 15.7 points, 5.0 rebounds, 4.1 assists, 1.0 steals, 45.2 field-goal percentage, 37.0 3-point percentage, 80.5 free-throw percentage, 33.1 minutes.\n\nWhen Will Barton charted a plan for his summer workouts three years ago, he reviewed a cut-up of every shot he had taken the previous season. He was a surveyor scouring the land ahead for any mole hills that were popping up.\n\nFlash forward three years, and the Barton preparing for unrestricted free agency has come a long way from that 2015 summer of reconstruction in Baltimore, when he ditched many of the hitches in his jump shot and further elevated himself as one of the league’s top bucket-getters off the bench.\n\nBut when the bell rang on the 2017-18 season, it was just one shot, a floater Barton has “made a million times before,” that he kept pulling up on an iPad. It was an 8-foot attempt that would have tied the winner-take-all season finale against Minnesota with 24 seconds to go in overtime, but it bounced harmlessly away, leaving the Timberwolves to celebrate and the Nuggets to feel the burn of a fifth straight season without a postseason berth.\n\nBarton doesn’t expect the pain of that miss and that loss to fade anytime soon, but when it does, he’ll be left with the knowledge that the Nuggets would not have reached that very spot — one or two shots away from a playoff berth — were it not for the growth this season of the 6-foot-6 playmaker.\n\n“I thought Will was fantastic,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. “I really did.”\n\nThat the Nuggets were able to author their longest winning streak in five seasons, largely without the services of Harris, the team’s starting two-guard, is a testament to the impact Barton had on Denver’s last-gasp dash toward the playoffs. As a starter during the final 12 games of the season, Barton averaged 19.2 points, 5.6 rebounds and 3.8 assists while shooting 46.1 percent from the floor, 40 percent from 3-point range and 87.5 percent from the line — marks well above his averages during what was already a career season.\n\nHe stepped up even further during the six-game winning streak in April that brought the Nuggets to within one game of a playoff spot, pouring in 20.3 points and pulling down seven rebounds while hitting 51.8 percent of his shots. For a player who will enter unrestricted free agency for the first time in July, Barton couldn’t have picked a better time to play his best basketball. And as much as his stellar play down the stretch emboldened the Nuggets, it could also make Barton more difficult to retain once the bidding for his services begins.\n\nBut that’s an issue for a different day. The point here is how Barton managed to hit career highs in nearly every category this season, upping an already impressive ability to score the basketball while also becoming a more consistent and efficient playmaker.\n\n“I just feel like I became more professional, more of a leader,” Barton said as the Nuggets cleaned out their lockers earlier this month. “The team really counted on me. That’s something I really took pride in, not only on the court but off the court. Make sure I’m doing the right things and bringing these young guys along and being the vet on my team. They talk to me and they tell me I got to be one of those guys on the team. It’s something I really take pride in and hopefully, I can keep doing that.”\n\nBarton was indeed counted on more than ever before — his 33.1 minutes per game were second on the team behind Harris — even as he shuffled from scoring guard off the bench to backup point guard to fill-in small forward to starter. And his efficiency was the biggest reason Malone was able to trust Barton with so many responsibilities and feature him more prominently into Denver’s free-flowing offense.\n\nBarton’s field-goal percentage of 45.2 last season was the best of his career. And he tied his best 3-point shooting mark (37 percent) while attempting 5.2 long-range shots per game. He also shot 37 percent from 3-point range last season, but on just 3.9 attempts. More playing time spawned higher efficiency for Barton, a player who has always claimed that the more time he spent on the court, the more damage he could do.\n\nStill, Barton’s evolution was more than a case of higher volume creating bigger raw numbers. His usage rate was a modest 20.7 percent, just the seventh-highest mark on the team. His true shooting percentage of 56.2 — a measure of efficiency that factors in field-goal, 3-point and free-throw averages — was the best of his career.\n\nToward the end of the season, Barton explained that his jump shot simply felt more fluid than it had at any point in his career. In the past, there had often been an element of herky-jerky motion in Barton’s game, a series of starts and stops that didn’t always produce the smoothest aesthetics when he had the ball in his hand. That included a jump shot that had some hitches along the way. Most notably, he had the tendency to fall away from his shot, even when he was open, a major priority during that 2015 summer. Mind you, this was no Charles-Barkley-golf-swing type of issue, but hitches in his mechanics could be blamed for extended droughts.\n\nThese days, there is more fluidity with a jump shot that Barton was able to get to more quickly off the dribble. Take this first play in this highlight reel below. There is no wasted motion as Barton dribbles up the floor, puts a mini stepback on Chris Paul and rises up for the 3-pointer, his shoulders square to the basket and in line with his knees.\n\nMalone has always relied upon Barton to carry the Nuggets offense in stretches, a burden he carried down the stretch this season. But the coach came away more impressed with how Barton grew as a defender, blossoming in April while taking on Harris’ responsibility of tagging the opponent’s best perimeter player.\n\nThis was on display prominently when the Nuggets beat the Trail Blazers in their home finale on April 9. He flip-flopped on Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum during Portland’s 13-point fourth quarter, and Barton’s effort helped hold the duo to 3-of-9 shooting in the period. That’s not to say Barton became a stopper this season; his wiry frame will keep him from ever being a defensive bruiser. But Barton’s strides on that end didn’t go unnoticed, even as he was reaching a new level of offensive efficiency.\n\n“I thought he improved this year, defensively,” Malone said. “He showed he could go out there and get the job done. He took it personal some nights. He has to be more consistent with that, but I saw definite growth there. I think he’s understanding the importance of being an efficient Will Barton. Will was terrific for us this year. Again, I think he had a career season. Obviously, he was a big part of what we did this year, and I would love nothing more than to have Will Barton back in a Denver Nugget uniform.”\n\n(Photo by Aaron Ontiveroz/The Denver Post via Getty Images)"
