        "text": "VIDEO: How is Maryland basketball's recruiting going?\n\nThe Will Barton Elite Camp has always been a great opportunity to not only get eyes on some of the top prospects from the DMV, but from around the country. Dating back to when Donta Scott was entering his senior year of high school, I remember watching him take full advantage of the stage by displaying much of the versatility that he has translated on the floor for the Terps.\n\nThis year’s camp this weekend will be no different, featuring several top targets and possible future Maryland stars. Let’s take a look at who is scheduled to attend along with some updated recruiting buzz.\n\nEfeosa Oliogu"
