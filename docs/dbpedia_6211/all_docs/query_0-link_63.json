        "text": "WHILE the qualifying games produced some good games, it is now at the knockout stages with the quarter finals being played over the coming weekend. The top four in reach group have made it through so now it is the real thing.\n\nLavey v Newbridge, 4pm, Owenbeg, Saturday\n\nThis could be the game of the quarter finals. When Lavey got relegated from the senior league, allied to losing five top players, they looked set for a bad season but they showed that they still had a lot to offer by winning four of their six games.\n\nIn round six they hit their best form with a big win over Swatragh. Newbridge are powered by Derry defensive stars Paudie McGrogan and Conor Doherty and they will start slight favourites after holding Magherafelt to a draw in their last game. Another Derry player, namely Niall Toner, is the key man for Lavey. He scored both their goals against Swatragh.\n\nBoth teams play on the front foot so the scoreboard operator should be busy. It is one of these games that could need a replay.\n\nGlen v Kilrea, 5.45pm, Owenbeg, Saturday\n\nGlen cruised through their group with six wins from six and a scoring difference of 39 points and they never really were at full strength in any of the games.\n\nThey are already seen as hot favourites for a third Derry title in a row and a second Ulster but manager Malachy O’Rourke will not allow his players to get carried away.\n\nKilrea did well to finish fourth when Ballinderry did them a favour by beating Steelstown last Saturday. With the Glen team strengthened by the return of Ciaran McFaul and a few young players coming into the squad it’s hard to see who will stop them.\n\nKilrea did well to beat The Loup away coming from four points down at half time. They are capable of getting goals but it is difficult to see them completing a shock here.\n\nSlaughtneil v Bellaghy, 4pm, Owenbeg, Sunday\n\nAfter a sluggish start to their campaign Slaughtneil slipped into gear with comfortable wins over The Loup, Ballinderry and Kilrea but got a good test from Newbridge to complete four wins in a row.\n\nThey are now under the management of Down native Mark Doran and have introduced a number of young players. One of their stalwarts, Chrissy McKaigue, has not played in the last few games due to an ankle injury.\n\nBellaghy won the league but have won just three of their six qualifying games. They were against Eoghan Rua, Ballinascreen and Dungiven. In their final game last Sunday they were no match for champions Glen and they are not expected to top Slaughtneil either.\n\nYoung players like Peter McCullagh, Jack Cassidy and Ruairi O’Mianain have impressed in the slightly new look Emmett’s lineup. Bellaghy are not strong around the middle of the field where potential All Star Brendan Rogers is expected to dominate. It should be comfortable for Doran’s men."
