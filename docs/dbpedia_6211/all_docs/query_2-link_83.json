        "text": "Weber State junior point guard Damian Lillard has been selected to participate in the Adidas Nations basketball global experience this weekend in Los Angeles. Lillard will join several of the top collegiate players in the country as well as some of the top high school players in the nation at the tournament.\n\nLillard, a native of Oakland, Calif., is one of 29 college players selected to participate in the tournament. He and the other players will serve as counselors and mentors to the high school players. The collegiate players will also play in the showcase. Lillard participated in the Adidas Nations showcase last year in Chicago.\n\nSome of the collegiate players include Memphis' Will Barton, Xavier's Tu Holloway, Baylor's Perry Jones, NC State's CJ Leslie, UCLA's Reeves Nelson, Duke's Mason Plumlee, Kansas' Thomas Robinson and Ohio State's Jared Sullinger.\n\nLillard has played in 71 career games at Weber State and has scored 1,150 career points, which ranks as 13th in Weber State history. He ranks fourth in school history in career three-point field goals with 152. He missed all but nine games last season due to an foot injury. In the nine games he played with the 'Cats averaged 19.7 points and 4.2 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game, while shooting nearly 44 percent from the field and scored in double digits in the eight full games he played in.\n\nLillard was named the 2009-10 Big Sky Conference MVP after his sophomore season in which he helped lead the Wildcats to their second-straight Big Sky title. He led the Big Sky in scoring at 19.9 points per game, was fourth in the league in assists at 3.6 and was first in three-point field goals made with 84. Those 84 three-pointers is the most in WSU single-season history. He received Honorable Mention All-American honors by the Associated Press. His 617 points that season was the eighth most in WSU single-season history."
