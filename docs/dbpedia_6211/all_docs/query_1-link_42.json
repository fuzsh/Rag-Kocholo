        "text": "Cailean O'Boyle is looking forward to playing a more expansive style of football under new Derry manager Damian Barton.\n\nThe Oak Leaf County were heavily criticised for their ultra-defensive approach in 2015 but the new man in charge has vowed to focus on attacking football, which is music to O'Boyle's ears.\n\n\"A fresh face is always a good thing as such,\" the talented forward told The Irish Daily Star. \"The ruthless character that Damian is, from his playing days and managing elsewhere, it is probably what Derry needs.\n\n\"He's going to call a spade a spade and I would say it will work well. It will put a few boys in position, including myself.\n\n\"Personally speaking, as a forward, it will be a real delight to have the shackle off your back rather than when you're sitting with five defenders and being made to look like you're the worst in the world.\n\n\"You don't want to be standing there getting no touches of the ball and then being taken off. It's not the way football should played in my eyes.\n\n\"The new manager is the type of boy where he won't care if there's 15 of the best players on the other team. He will say 'we are going out to play our own style of play'.\n\n\"And it will be welcomed because there is plenty of talent in Derry. It's just restricted in terms of what we can do.\"\n\nTweet\n\nMost Read Stories"
