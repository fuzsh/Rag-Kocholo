        "text": "MOVILLE GOALKEEPER Dylan Doherty has been called into the Derry senior football panel and is being tipped to be given a debut by Damian Barton this weekend.\n\nDerry manager Barton has called Doherty in as one of three new goalkeepers to the Oak Leaf panel.\n\nDoherty plays for Moville, who lead the way in Division 4 of the AllSportStore.com All-County Football League after a superb start to the 2016 campaign.\n\nDoherty lives in Derry and is a student at St Columb’s College in the city.\n\n[adrotate group=”43″]\n\nIn December, Doherty was named as a Colleges All-Star winner. He helped St Columb’s reach the MacLarnon Cup final, which they lost 1-17 to 2-12 against Holy Trinity, Cookstown.\n\nDoherty also helped Moville to victory over Malin in the Inishowen A final last year and now looks set to be handed the Derry number one jersey for Saturday evening’s qualifier against Louth at Owenbeg.\n\n[adrotate group=”53″]\n\nAlthough he is a native of Derry, Doherty has played for Moville for a number of years now. He has family in Moville and spends a good portion of his time in Inishowen.\n\nThomas Mallon played in the Ulster SFC defeat to Tyrone at Celtic Park, but injured a shoulder last weekend.\n\nEoin McNicholl has left the squad and Doherty was drafted in along with Magherafelt’s Conor McLarnon and Callum Mullan-Young from Glen. McLarnon is on holiday this week and Doherty is seen as the favourite to get selected for duty.\n\n[adrotate group=”74″] Tags:"
