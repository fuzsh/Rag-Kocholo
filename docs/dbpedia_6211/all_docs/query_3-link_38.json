        "text": "TORONTO — Things can move quickly when a player switches teams on the buyout market. For Will Barton, things moved so quickly that he missed his own reunion tour.\n\nAfter a cameo appearance against Chicago, Barton’s next three games as a Raptor were two in Washington, where he just came from, and then one in Denver, where he spent parts of eight seasons. After the Washington Wizards waived him, the Raptors signed him.\n\n“It happened so fast that I really didn’t get a chance to think about it,” Barton said. “It’s just crazy that I came from those two former teams, and then my first games were against them. It’s crazy.”\n\nIt continues on Tuesday, when Barton will play 669th regular-season game. The Nuggets are in town. Barton should get more of a chance to play in Toronto than he did in Washington, with Nick Nurse referring to him as the backup point guard on Monday. That perhaps stretches the definition of “point guard,” but Barton is likely to continue to get a shot to help prop a struggling bench.\n\nHe has 14 more games to make an impact as a Raptor. That’s just a blip in his career. In his 11th season, Barton has scored 7,566 points and assisted on 1,806 baskets in 16,954 minutes. On Monday, Barton sat down with The Athletic to take a quiz about some of the highlights.\n\n(As always with the pop quizzes, thanks to Basketball Reference for the data. This interview has been edited for length, style and clarity.)\n\nThree of your college teammates at Memphis ended up playing at least one NBA game in the regular season. Can you name them?\n\nTarik Black.\n\nHe was No. 1. He played 220.\n\nI would say Adonis Thomas.\n\nNo. 2, he played six.\n\nAfter that I would go D.J. Stephens.\n\nYes. Nailed it. Four games. Do you remember playing against Tarik?\n\nYeah. I dunked on Tarik one game. I definitely remember that. One-hander. I came through the lane, broke the defence down and he jumped at the last minute and I dunked on him.\n\nDid you trash-talk him?\n\nOf course. Me and him, we’re really good friends.\n\nCan you name your coaches at Memphis who are currently coaching in the NBA. They’re both assistants. One of them has been a head coach before.\n\nGlynn Cyprien. He was assistant coach, right?\n\nWho?\n\nGlynn Cyprien.\n\nI don’t think he’s in the NBA. (Editor’s note: Cyprien never coached in the NBA, but he did coach Iowa and Memphis in the G League.)\n\nYou’re saying in the NBA now? Hold on.\n\nThey’re both former NBA players.\n\nI do not remember.\n\nDamon…\n\nWhat? Noooooo. No. No. I do remember. Damon Stoudamire and Luke Walton.\n\nYep. I know Luke was a special case because he was only there during the (2011 NBA) lockout.\n\nThat’s the thing. Neither one of them was there for my freshman year. They were only there for my second year. Luke Walton and Damon Stoudamire, yeah.\n\n(Editor’s note: During this interview, reports surfaced that Stoudamire, an assistant with the Celtics, was to become the next head coach at Georgia Tech. The news was later confirmed)\n\nYou’ve scored more than 7,500 points. Name the two players who were born in Baltimore who have scored more than you.\n\nThere are only two players?\n\nOnly two. Maybe some more than were raised in Baltimore, but only two were born in Baltimore.\n\nS—. Is one Rudy Gay?\n\nNo. (Gay was born in Brooklyn but raised in Baltimore.)\n\nSam Cassell?\n\nYes. (Cassell scored 15,635 points).\n\nMuggsy Bogues?\n\nNo.\n\nI scored more points than Muggsy?\n\nYep. He’s an answer to the next question. (Bogues scored 6,858 points.) He’s one of two Baltimore-born players to play more minutes than you. Sam Cassell is the other.\n\nSo to score more. Sam and …\n\nHe played in the ‘90s.\n\nIs it Reggie Lewis?\n\nYes.\n\nI didn’t want to guess him because of what happened. (Lewis, the Boston forward, died due to a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy during an offseason practice in 1993. He was 27.)\n\nIt was tragic. I know.\n\nYeah. Man, I gotta remember that. I’m glad you asked me that. I need you to text me those two questions you just asked me. Those are the stats I can brag about back home.\n\nBefore you got into the league, the (40th-overall) pick that Portland eventually used to select you in 2012 was traded twice. Do you have any idea where it came from?\n\nWho originally had that pick? No idea.\n\nIt was Minnesota’s pick.\n\nWas that Brandon Roy?\n\nNo. They traded it with Jonny Flynn, Donatas Motiejūnas to Houston for Brad Miller, Nikola Mirotić, Chandler Parsons and the first-round pick that became Andre Roberson.\n\nWow. I never knew that.\n\nAnd then your pick was traded to Portland in March 2012. Do you know who Houston got back for that?\n\nNo idea.\n\nMarcus Camby.\n\nYou are second among all 2012 second-rounders in points scored.\n\nKhris Middleton’s first.\n\nBeat me to the question. There are three others, including Middleton, with more than 5,000 points.\n\nDraymond Green and Jae Crowder.\n\nWow. You guys would have a pretty good five-man unit.\n\nI’ve scored more total points than all of them, right?\n\nExcept Middleton.\n\nYeah, except Middleton. I’ve got more points than Draymond?\n\nHe doesn’t shoot that much. (Before Monday’s game in Phoenix, Green had 6,464 regular-season points.)\n\nDamn.\n\nI don’t know if you want to get into a trash-talking match with Draymond, but you could tell him that next time you’re playing.\n\nYour first two baskets were in your second career game. Who were you playing in that game, and who assisted on your first 3?\n\nWere we playing against Sacramento?\n\nNo.\n\nDid Earl Watson give me the assist?\n\nNo.\n\nDamian Lillard.\n\nRight team, wrong guy. Another starter on that team. You just played against him.\n\nWe just played against him? Last week. I was with the Raptors?\n\nHe came off the bench for the Clippers.\n\n*long pause*\n\nBig forward. Play-making forward.\n\nNic Batum. F—— Nic Batum. Who were we playing against?\n\nHouston.\n\nHow many times do you think you’ve scored 30 or more points in a game?\n\nIn my NBA career? Five.\n\nNine.\n\nAll right. Nice.\n\nThere was one former lottery pick who was traded with you from Portland to Denver.\n\nThomas Robinson.\n\nBeat me to the question again. Do you remember all the guys in that trade?\n\nThomas Robinson. Me and Victor Claver for Arron Afflalo and picks?\n\nI don’t actually have it written down so I’m gonna take your word for it. (Barton, Robinson, Claver and the first-round pick that became Malik Beasley went to Denver for Afflalo and Alonzo Gee.)\n\nWhat is your career high, and who was it against?\n\nMy career high was 37 against the Bulls.\n\nYep. What can you tell me about the game-winning basket?\n\nI hit a layup. Driving through defenders, off my right foot and got to the other side of the rim.\n\nDo you know who contested it at the rim?\n\nMan. It happened so fast. Robin Lopez?\n\nYep. Very good. Nine of your 13 buckets that night were assisted. Six players contributed to those nine assists.\n\nGary Harris.\n\nYep, he had three. He had the most.\n\nRichard Jefferson.\n\nYep.\n\nNikola Jokić. How many more players do I need?\n\nThree more.\n\nEmmanuel Mudiay. *Pause* Juancho Hernangomez.\n\nVery good.\n\nI don’t know the last one.\n\nTrey Lyles.\n\nAh, Trey!\n\nA few weeks later, you had a career-high 10 assists. Only time that’s ever happened for you. Do you remember who it was against?\n\nNope.\n\nDetroit.\n\nAh yeah, Detroit. I remember that.\n\nJokić didn’t play, so you needed some playmaking.\n\nWe lost that game.\n\nI think you won, but I didn’t write it down. (The Nuggets won 103-84.) You found six guys for assists. There is some crossover from the last question. Who are the six?\n\nTrey Lyles.\n\nYep.\n\nGary Harris.\n\nYep. Actually, no. You had no assists to Gary Harris that game.\n\nI had no assists to Gary? Trey Lyles. Richard Jefferson.\n\nNo.\n\nDamn. Juancho?\n\nNope.\n\nGoddamn, who played that game? Did I say Trey Lyles already?\n\nThree times now.\n\nDid I get Mudiay one?\n\nNo. One guy who is still in Denver.\n\nOh, Jamal Murray.\n\nYep. One guy who you played last game, Lakers.\n\nWho played on my team with the Lakers? Oh, Malik Beasley.\n\nYep.\n\nWho else did I get an assist to that game? I have no idea.\n\nAll right. Some clues. One’s a big man who you actually just played on this road trip, too.\n\nWho does he play with?\n\nClippers.\n\nWho is it?\n\nHe has a brother who was in the NBA.\n\nMason (Plumlee).\n\nYep. The other two are Wilson Chandler and Darrell Arthur.\n\nMy guys.\n\nYour eight most common teammates, the guys you have played the most games with, were all your teammates in Denver. The ninth wasn’t. Who is he?\n\nJust who I shared the court with?\n\nYou would have played the same game, yes.\n\nSo he wasn’t just on the same team with me, but we shared the court together? S—, Damian Lillard?\n\nGot it.\n\nHow many times do you think you have scored on a Jokić assist?\n\nPsssst. A lot.\n\nCorrect. Give me a ballpark.\n\nTwo hundred?\n\n*points up*\n\nFour hundred?\n\nThat’s about it. You scored 393 times off his assist. He has assisted two players more than you.\n\nJamal Murray and Gary Harris.\n\nYes. Do you have any great Jokić stories?\n\nNot really. He was just funny every day. A lot of people think he’s quiet, but he’s not. He talks a lot. He’s funny. He likes to laugh and joke. He’s got a great personality and sense of humour.\n\nLast question. One of your nicknames listed on Basketball Reference is The People’s Champ. How did that happen?\n\nYep. I think after a game I said it in Portland. I was just saying how much the crowd was showing me love even though I don’t play a lot. I said, ‘I guess I’m just the people’s champ.’\n\nIs there somebody you think of before yourself when I say, ‘The People’s Champ?’\n\nYeah, The Rock.\n\nI figured. Were you a big Rock guy growing up?\n\nOf course. Him and Stone Cold (Steve Austin), my favourite wrestlers ever.\n\nWhich one are you taking in a match?\n\nStone Cold.\n\n(Top photo: Mark Blinch / Getty Images)"
