        "text": "Alpena, Mich. — An Alpena man who is already facing charges for bestiality has been hit with another felony warrant.\n\n18-year-old Damian Barton has been charged with criminal sexual assault in the first degree.\n\nA child family member came forward and told her mother that she was inappropriately touched by Barton. The girl reported the incident on the day of a presentation about inappropriate touching according to Michigan State Police. MSP’s investigation discovered additional evidence that supported the child’s statement.\n\nBarton was served the warrant last week while in Alpena County Jail. He’s being held on $250,000 bond. The 18-year-old was arraigned in the 88th District Court."
