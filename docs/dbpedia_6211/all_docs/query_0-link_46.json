        "text": "Meath manager Mick O'Dowd resigned after a 68th-minute goal by substitute Niall Loughlin snatched a 1-14 to 1-11 victory for Derry at Owenbeg.\n\nMeath led the whole way until Loughlin's late strike but only scored three points in a second half controlled by Derry.\n\nAfterwards O'Dowd, who has been in charge for four years, confirmed he was stepping down.\n\nThe Royals led by 1-8 to 0-4 at half time but should have been further ahead and were left to regret those missed opportunities when Derry came storming back.\n\nDamian Barton's side kicked six points in the nine minutes after the restart before Mickey Burke stopped the rot with a 45th minute point.\n\nMeath kept their noses in front until Loughlin's composed finish. James Kielt's attempt for a point dropped short and Loughlin's superb dummy took the goalkeeper and his marker out of the game, allowing him to roll the ball into an empty net.\n\nMeath, who lost by 10 points to Dublin in the Leinster semi-final two weeks ago, started brightly and raced into a four-point lead after just seven minutes.\n\nDerry won the toss and gave Meath the chance to make the most of a strong wind in the first half, and the visitors cashed in with Padraic Harnan opening the scoring in the third minute.\n\nGraham Reilly's pace and runs through the middle caused problems for a static Derry defence and he kicked two points from play before Mickey Newman's free put Meath four up.\n\nMark Lynch's well-judged point into a difficult breeze finally got Derry on the scoreboard after 16 minutes but it was a very poor first half display by the home team.\n\nDonal Lenihan, one of three late changes to the Meath starting team, missed a great goal chance. He collected Cillian O'Sullivan's diagonal ball but his low shot across goal flew narrowly wide of the far post.\n\nLynch scored again from play and a free to keep Derry in touch but Newman's goal in the 26th minute put clear daylight between the teams.\n\nReilly punched another hole in Derry's defence and passed out to Donnacha Tobin who fired a low shot into a crowded square. Newman got on the end of it and tapped the ball in from close range to put Mick O'Dowd's side 1-7 to 0-3 clear.\n\nGareth McKinless' superb block on Newman's shot prevented Meath extending their lead and a James Kielt point left Derry 1-8 to 0-4 adrift at the break.\n\nMark Lynch, Christopher Bradley, Eoghan Brown and Kielt (free) scored four points in as many minutes straight after the interval.\n\nLynch and Kielt tagged on more scores as Derry pushed up and ran at Meath.\n\nChrissy McKaigue kicked a curling score from the wing and Derry kept the pressure on, despite Brendan Rogers' black card on the hour mark.\n\nMeath surprisingly replaced free-taker Newman, who wasn't injured, and Donal Lenihan then missed a crucial free when Meath were two points ahead.\n\nThe Royals had to take off full-back Donal Keogan with concussion after 64 minutes, and four minutes later Derry pounced for the late goal which puts them into Monday' sdraw for Round 3A of the All-Ireland SFC qualifiers.\n\nDerry: T Mallon; G McKinless, C McKaigue (0-1), K McKaigue; C McFaul, B Rogers, C Mullan; C McAtamney, N Holly; D Heavron, C Bradley (0-1), E Brown (0-1); J Kielt (0-4, 3f), E McGuckin, M Lynch (0-6, 2f).\n\nSubs: N Toner for McGuckin (28), N Loughlin (1-0) for Brown (46), E Bradley for Holly (46), E Lynn (0-1) for C Bradley (53), N Forrester for Rogers (BC, 62), L McGoldrick for Mullan (63).\n\nMeath: P O'Rourke; S Lavin, D Keogan, M Burke (0-1); D Tobin, D Smyth, A Douglas; P Harnan (0-1), H Rooney; C O'Brien, G Reilly (0-2), C O'Sullivan (0-2, 2f); B McMahon, D Lenihan, M Newman (1-4, 3f).\n\nSubs: E Wallace for McMahon (42), D McDonagh for Newman (52), A Tormey (0-1, f) for Lenihan (60), S Tobin for Keogan (63)."
