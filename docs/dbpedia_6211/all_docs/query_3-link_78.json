        "text": "Daily Countdown: The best football teams from the San Gabriel Valley Tribune, Pasadena Star-News and Whittier Daily News areas are ranked in an all-encompassing preseason Top 10 countdown that will conclude with the top team unveiled on Aug. 17.\n\nTHE LEAD\n\nDamien is entering a new era under new football coach Matt Bechtel, who is a Spartans alum. The Spartans were able to wrestle Bechtel away from South Hills after Bechtel led the Huskies to a CIF Southern Section Division 6 title last season while going 14-0.\n\nSupport our high school sports coverage by becoming a digital subscriber. Subscribe now: Tribune | Star-News | Whittier Daily News\n\nIt was a major hire for Damien which has been searching for a coach who can turn the program around. That is no easy task considering the Spartans participate in the always tough Baseline League, where Upland and Rancho Cucamonga have dominated for years.\n\nAnd it’s not as if the Spartans haven’t tried splashy hires before. They brought in Greg Gano and most recently Mark Paredes, two coaches who have won multiple CIF championships, but for whatever reasons they couldn’t get the job done at Damien.\n\nThe Spartans bottomed out last season, finishing in a three-way tie for last place in the Baseline League and going 4-7 overall, but they do have strong pieces returning this season. With that talent, Damien is ranked No. 6 in our preseason football top 10.\n\n“The expectation is, and always will be, to win a Baseline League title,” Bechtel said. “Obviously, we are in the beginning stages of building the championship attitude and culture that is necessary to accomplish our goals, but we are on a mission to make Damien football the greatest program in the area.”\n\nSTRENGTHS\n\nThe good news for the Spartans is that Bechtel is seemingly a magician on offense and is known for grooming quarterbacks. He has a solid returner in senior Jordan Barton, who threw for 2,294 yards and 16 touchdowns last season.\n\nBarton is expected to start, but the Spartans also have junior Zack Camarena, who transferred from Bishop Amat and will also play linebacker this season.\n\n“Offensively, everything runs through the quarterback position and we feel that we have a very good stable of quarterbacks led by Barton that will lead the way,” Bechtel said.\n\nThe Spartans also return their leading rusher from last year, senior Jermaine Barner, who rushed for 849 yards and 11 touchdowns, but look for junior newcomers Chase Carter and Jacob Leazenby to contribute the most in the backfield as Barner transitions to wideout.\n\nSenior receiver Blake Boucher is back, but for a team that is expected to sling it, the Spartans depth at the receiving position is thin and must be figured out.\n\nOne area where Bechtel expects the Spartans to be improved is the defensive line, led by Seth Broussard and Sam Sachs.\n\n“We must replace three starters on the offensive line and a secondary that is young and inexperienced,” Bechtel said. “The Baseline League is always very tough and competitive. You have big time players and very good coaches week in and week out.\n\n“We never concern ourselves with who we are playing. We concern ourselves with our own ability to play fundamentally sound football on a consistent basis. With a new coaching staff here and an entirely different set of expectations, the greatest challenge we will face is getting our guys to believe in the process and follow the script we have laid out for them.”\n\nOther important returners are seniors Cordell Towns (OL/DL), Ethan DeGenaro (OL/DL0 and Andy Moraga (safety).\n\nNewcomers expected to contribute include junior David Rivas (OL/DL) and seniors Gabriel Webb (LB/FB), Tony Ovalles (TE/DE) and junior Damian Sanchez (MLB).\n\nOUTLOOK\n\nThe Spartans will be tested right away, as they open the season against Glendora, which is one of the favorites to win CIF-SS Division 5. There will also be great nonleague tests for the Spartans against St. Francis and Charter Oak before they begin play in the punishing Baseline League.\n\nDamien has dropped from Division 3 to Division 4 this season, which should help their playoff chances if they can reach the playoffs. But a bounce-back season is expected for the Spartans.\n\nBechtel hired an extremely competent staff, and he’s no stranger to a challenging schedule having been the head coach at Chino Hills before going to South Hills. And remember, when he was at Chino Hills he was able to defeat Bishop Amat, so he knows what to do against the big boys.\n\nThe biggest challenge will be getting the Spartans to believe, because the glory days were so long ago.\n\n“We are extremely fired up at the opportunity to bring the Damien football program back to a championship level,” Bechtel said. “There is no greater feeling than locking horns again with the teams in our league. Our coaching staff and our players have been working extremely hard to get ready for what will be an exciting season.”\n\nSCHEDULE\n\nHome games at Damien High School.\n\nAll games start at 7 p.m.\n\nAug. 23 vs. Glendora\n\nAug. 30 at Claremont\n\nSept. 6 vs. St. Francis\n\nSept. 13 at Charter Oak\n\nSept. 20 vs. Alta Loma\n\nOct. 4 at Upland\n\nOct. 11 vs. Chino Hills\n\nOct. 18 vs. Rancho Cucamonga\n\nOct. 25 at Etiwanda\n\nNov. 1 at Los Osos"
