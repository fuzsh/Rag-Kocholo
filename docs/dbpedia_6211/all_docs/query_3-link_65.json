        "text": "Owning the unofficial title of best college basketball player in the state is something a Vanderbilt player has not been able to claim in a long time. You would have to go back to at least the days of Shan Foster and Derrick Byars winning back-to-back SEC Player of the Year Awards for the 'Dores to be in the conversation.\n\nSince then, Tennessee and Memphis have trotted out a continuous lineup of stars including Jordan McRae, Jarnell Stokes, Tyreke Evans and Will Barton. Meanwhile, the state's mid-major programs have suited up honorable mention All-Americans (J.J. Mann of Belmont), NBA players (Kevin Murphy of Tennessee Tech) or both (Ian Clark also of Belmont). Vanderbilt has been crowded out of the conversation for best player in Tennessee in recent years.\n\nEnter sophomore phenom Damian Jones.\n\nIn just his second season, he already has a legitimate claim to the unofficial Tennessee throne. Jones averaged 11.3 points and 5.7 rebounds last season on his way to being named to the SEC’s All-Freshman Team. He's set to surpass those averages this season. In his first game of the 2013-14 season, an 83-56 thrashing of fellow Nashvillians Trevecca Nazarene, Jones notched 24 points (on 10-13 shooting) and 12 rebounds in just 23 minutes of play.\n\nJones is the unquestioned leader and best player on this Vandy roster, and his recent inclusion on the preseason All-SEC First Team is confirmation of that, but the title will not be Jones’ for the taking in a cake walk. There are quite a few candidates who would like the main seat at the table.\n\nSome of these players have been grinding for a while now, while others are brand new on the scene, but they all are some of the best players in the state.\n\nReece Chamberlain, Belmont:\n\nChamberlain is Belmont’s jack-of-all trades senior point guard. Last season he averaged a line of 10.9 points, 5.5 assists, 3.7 rebounds and 1.4 steals per game. He’s already doubled his rebound and steal averages this season, albeit in a short sample size, while upping his points per game his well. If Belmont makes their fifth consecutive NCAA Tournament, and Chamberlain is instrumental in the Bruins pulling off a first round upset, he could steal the title from Jones.\n\nJosh Richardson, Tennessee:\n\nWith Stokes, McRae and Jeronne Maymon all departed from the Vols roster, Richardson is poised to take over as the team’s primary scorer. If Richardson can elevate his play, and the play of his teammates, in what was expected to be a down year for the Vols, he may earn the top spot. The senior, who averaged just over 10 points per game last year as more of a defensive stopper for Tennessee, scored 17 points in the season opener against the vaunted VCU defense.\n\nShaq Goodwin, Memphis:\n\nIf Memphis wants to make it back to the Big Dance, Goodwin will have to shoulder a bog load for the team. As a sophomore, Goodwin averaged 11.5 points, 6.5 rebounds, 1.8 blocks and 1.3 steals per game. If he can step up into a playmaker role, a role the Tigers desperately need filled, then Goodwin may find himself at the top of this list.\n\nJosh Williams, Lipscomb:\n\nAs a freshman for Lipscomb last season, Williams scored 20 or more points eight times and dropped 34 on ETSU. With a year of experience under his belt, Williams will be the go-to scorer and best rebounder on a deep Bisons squad that Coach Casey Alexander has ready to keep the pace an all-time high for the program. Williams will be key in determining whether or Lipscomb can win the Atlantic Sun."
