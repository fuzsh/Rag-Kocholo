        "text": "O’Neill’s Senior Football Championship\n\nTHE four top teams in the two groups will qualify for the county championship quarter finals. A few teams look to have no chance but they can still have a say on how other teams do.\n\nOnly two teams out of the 14 who are competing have won all their four games to date. They are Group A leaders Glen and Group B leaders Magherafelt.\n\nGroup A\n\nGlen have eight points followed by Lavey and Bellaghy on six. Ballinascreen have four, Dungiven and Swatragh two with Eoghan Rua still without a win but all their four defeats have been by small margins.\n\nSwatragh v Bellaghy, 5.30pm, Saturday, Referee: Gavin Dixon\n\nBellaghy are four points ahead of Swatragh but they could well come unstuck at Davitt Park if Swatragh can play as well as they did in a narrow defeat up the road at Glen in the last round.\n\nA defeat for Damian Cassidy’s team could knock them out of the running as their last game is against unbeaten Glen. Bellaghy won their last game at home to Eoghan Rua but it took until the final ten minutes for them to put the Coleraine men away. They conceded two first half goals and this Swatragh team hit three against Glen.\n\nBellaghy are a very fast and cohesive unit so the big Swatragh pitch will suit their style. They may struggle at midfield against Conor McAtamney and Patrick Kearney, two big men who are top class footballers.\n\nDerry player Paul Cassidy has not hit his best form for Bellaghy yet and if he does it will not be good news for the hosts. Swatragh have been missing the injured Oisin McWilliams all season and there is no indication as to when he will be back. His twin brother Lorcan has been prominent in the attack all season and he is a player well capable of leading the way to a shock result.\n\nLavey v Dungiven, 5.30pm Sunday. Referee: Martin McErlaine\n\nAn expected win for Lavey would put them directly into the quarter finals. They face a Dungiven team that has been struggling for scores at Guladuff where points are hard to come by. The new look Lavey team is full of grit and determination but they will be hoping to find their goal touch in this game.\n\nDefensively they have been excellent and they are as good as any in the middle of the field but the lack of major scores will be a concern to manager Gary Cushenan.\n\nDungiven have not built on the promise of last year and the task of rebuilding the team has fallen into the hands of former player James McNicholl. Lavey have won away to Coleraine and Ballinascreen and have had a home victory over Bellaghy. Their only defeat in the first four was by four points at Glen. Dungiven have only manager 1-36 in four games while Lavey are 15 points better off. On form it has to be Lavey.\n\nBallinascreen v Glen, 5.30pm Sunday. Referee: Damian Harkin\n\nA tough one for Ballinscreen who are on the fringes of a quarter final spot. With four straight victories the champions Glen are already in the knockout stages so they can approach this game in whatever manner they like. They have built an even more formidable panel than they had last year with the young McDermott brothers coming through to challenge for a regular spot in the defence.\n\nThey also have Ciaran McFaul back after he missed out last season due to being in America. Ballinascreen will be sweating on the outcome of two red card appeals but no matter who they have available it will be a difficult task. For some of their players it will be a third game in a week.\n\nGlen are raging hot favourites to win the county title for a third successive year and in truth it is difficult to see who will stop them. They did struggle a bit against Lavey and Swatragh in the group games so far but they were not at full strength on either occasion.\n\nBallinascreen are a team that will battle to the finishing line but they lack the scoring potential of Glen who look good for another victory.\n\nGroup B\n\nMagherafelt lead the way on full points and they look well on their way to the knockout stages. There is a real scramble behind them with Newbridge, Steelstown, Slaughtneil and Kilrea all in contention for the other three places.\n\nSlaughtneil, who made a poor start to the campaign with just a point from their first two games, will finish with home games against Kilrea and Newbridge. Steelstown and Magherafelt is a vital one for the improving Steelstown. The bottom two spots are occupied by neighbours The Loup and Ballinderry.\n\nSlaughtneil v Kilrea, Wednesday 7.45pm. Referee: Maurice Corrigan\n\nKilrea have two wins from two but their prospects of making the knockout stages could hinge on this game. It has been quite a few years since the Pearses got the better of Slaughtneil and they cannot be ruled out of causing an upset here. Their blend of youth and experience plus their pace on the wings makes them difficult to beat. It cannot be overlooked that they have beaten Newbridge by a considerable margin in round three.\n\nSlaughtneil struggled at times against pointless Loup in the last round before eventually winning by 0-12 to 0-8 in a low key game. Young PJ McAleese is hugely impressive in the Kilrea attack but he will need more assistance if they are to come back with something from the game.\n\nSlaughtneil have been bringing in younger players but in the end the skill of players like Brendan Rogers and Shane McGuigan should push their team nearer to a spot in the last eight.\n\nBallinderry v The Loup\n\nThere was the time when these two teams would have been battling for a place in the county final, now they are battling against relegation. While neither has any points to their names The Loup have shown the better form of the two. They ran Steelstown and Slaughtneil close but suffered a heavy defeat at Newbridge.\n\nBallinderry, who last won the title ten years ago, have been gradually slipping down the ladder. The loss of so many key players through retirement has not helped their cause but they do have some bright young players now filtering into the team. Niall O’Donnell was a star of the Derry minor team that won the 2020 All Ireland and Ruairi Forbes is another who will make his mark.\n\nThe Loup look to have a better attack than the Shamrocks. The two Devlin brothers Ciaran and Caolan have been their main scorers. They have also been conceding less than Ballinderry who still rely heavily on Ryan Bell for scores. Home advantage may not be enough for a much needed Ballinderry victory.\n\nSteelstown v Magherafelt, 3.30pm Sunday. Referee: Brendan Quinn\n\nThis is a game that will fully test the improving Brian Og’s as they welcome unbeaten Magherafelt to Pairc Brid. In a previous stint in senior football Steelstown scored a shock championship win over the Rossas but much has changed since then. Magherafet have gone on to win a county title while Steelstown have virtually the same team that won the 2021 All Ireland intermediate title.\n\nBoth have had close games against Slaughtneil, Steelstown held them to a draw and Magherafelt won by two points. Steelstown’s only blip was at home to Newbridge were they lost a game that they could easily have won. Away wins over Kilrea and The Loup has given them a confidence that had been missing in senior football until this year.\n\nThe Magherafelt team features Derry seniors Odhran Lynch, potential All Star Conor McCluskey and county full back Eoin McEvoy. Pencil in former county players at all levels and the Rossa Gaels are seen as the team most likely to give Glen a real run for the county title.\n\nThe experience of the Heavron brothers Daniel and Shane has been central to the rise of Damian Barton’s team and with a host of glittering talent waiting on the wings they are a team that will be around for a few years yet. The Steelstown defence will have to be wary of Magherafelt corner forward Cormac Murphy who hit two goals in their last outing. Magherafelt will be favourites but this Steelstown team is improving.\n\nSlaughtneil v Newbridge, 5.30pm Sunday. Referee: Barry Cassidy\n\nThere will be some tired legs in the Slaughtneil squad as quite a few of them line out for a third game in a week. The previous Sunday it was the county hurling final and three days later a round five championship clash with Kilrea. Newbridge come with three wins from four games. Their only defeat came at Kilrea when they had Nathan Rocks wrongly sent off early in the game, the player successfully appealed the red card.\n\nBy the time this game is played both are likely to have one foot in the quarter finals but neither will be taking any chances. Slaughtneil, with a new management set-up, have looked a bit below their best so far but looking at the quality players they have improvement is just around the corner. Newbridge, powered by Conor Doherty and Padraig McGrogan, have been impressive but victories are never easily gained at Emmett Park.\n\nReports and photos in next Tuesday's newspaper..."
