        "text": "RIVERSIDE –Tom Craft’s accountability-driven philosophies have conditioned quarterbacks at the collegiate level for decades.\n\nAccepting and learning from your mistakes is only half the equation. Fixing the mistakes, getting better and winning are the only allowable options.\n\n“Guys have to get better or they won’t play. That’s the bottom line,” Craft said early in the 2021 season.\n\nNow in his 12th year at Riverside City College, Craft’s teachings have perhaps never been more apparent than with freshman quarterback Jordan Barton, who has emerged as the team’s offensive leader during a late-season surge to the Southern California Football Association championship.\n\nBorn within steps of RCC at Riverside Community Hospital, Barton will start Saturday when the Tigers (10-2) go up against City College of San Francisco (12-0) in the California Community College Athletic Association championship game at 1:05 p.m. at Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut.\n\nCRAFT SCHOOL OF QBs\n\nThe opportunity to compete is everything for all junior college student-athletes, but getting there can be particularly perilous for young quarterbacks at RCC.\n\nMaking the cut in the competition for the two or three roster spots is its own achievement. Quarterbacks hand-picked by Craft undergo rigorous film and study sessions before putting it into practice on the field for three-plus hours every day for months ahead of any official game.\n\nIf quarterbacks don’t meet the coach’s discerning standards during the preseason, they don’t start Week 1. If they make obvious mistakes, they are benched. If they continue to make mistakes they will be replaced with someone who does not.\n\nThe process sharpens young playmakers’ decision-making and grinds diamonds out of hidden gems.\n\n“That made me cherish opportunities,” said Jacob Barlage, who led the Tigers to the 2019 CCCAA state title. “I understood I wasn’t going to get too many opportunities so I knew I had to take advantage. I knew I had to compete for everything.”\n\nWORKING FOR THE CHANCE\n\nEngaged students shape the future and so Craft’s quarterbacks are keen to absorb their playbooks and stay ready to play when the time comes.\n\nBarton stepped onto the field for the first time in a 37-20 loss to Golden West College in Week 4 and completed just 1 of 3 pass attempts, but was 15 for 30 in Week 5 at College of the Canyons and has remained the starter since.\n\n“Having to go through being the third-string guy, it was tough but it definitely strengthened me mentally and taught me to be patient,” said Barton, who has completed 68 percent of his passes this season with 19 touchdowns and more than 2,100 yards.\n\nPreparing like the starter can be an advantage but so can refusing to act as if you’re anything but the starter, like Barlage two years ago.\n\n“You prepare like you think you’re going to play,” said Barlage, who began the 2019 season No. 2 on the depth chart. “I was getting reps in practice and running plays so when it came to watching film and studying, I was the starter.”\n\n“I was always getting ready like, ‘Hey, something might happen and I might get in the game.’ So I always have to be ready and not let anybody down,” said Barlage, currently a sophomore at Nevada.\n\nTHE NEW ‘BIG’ MAN\n\nAt 6-foot-1 and 180 pounds, Barton knows his height and weight don’t scream – or even speak – to most football recruiters. So why not learn to use that to his advantage?\n\n“He has qualities you can’t teach, and he’s also a really good football player,” said Matt Bechtel, who coached Barton during his senior season at Damien High School. “He can command an offense, extends plays with his feet and can really sling it on the run.”\n\nOverlooked by NCAA Division I coaches because he is undersized, Barton is increasingly in demand at the Division II, III and NAIA levels for his mobility and throwing accuracy.\n\n“There are a lot of big guys that can’t move as well as I can and I feel like my game can help a team more because I can run it,” Barton said. “I just want to make plays and win. I’ll do whatever it takes to cause problems for the defense.”\n\nBarton declined a walk-on opportunity from NCAA Division III power University of Redlands following graduation from Damien, and seems glad he made the decision to go to quarterback school under Craft.\n\n“Sometimes I have to pinch myself that I’m being coached by one of the best quarterback coaches in the business,” Barton said. “I’m a whole different player having played for Coach Craft.”\n\nSTEPPING INTO THE MOMENT\n\nWith the game tied 17-17 against Golden West last Saturday, the time came to take a chance. The play call came in – the team’s top receiver, Jammal Houston, was running a deep slant route.\n\nBarton saw Golden West was playing with a single safety over the middle and knew this could be the moment. As soon as Houston angled his route and gained inside position on his defender, Barton stepped up into the pocket, gripped it and ripped it.\n\n“It was all going in slow motion in my head. I can still feel the shot of adrenaline I felt once I knew it was on,” he said.\n\nBarton’s lofted 40-yard throw tailed slightly but Houston raced under it in stride and outran the lone safety for the go-ahead touchdown as RCC went on to beat Golden West 27-23 in the SoCal final.\n\n“I’m just grateful for every opportunity I get and I honestly love football even more now than I did before,” said Barton following the game.\n\nThe Riverside native completed his final 18 pass attempts and finished the game 28 of 38 for 312 yards and two touchdowns in the Tigers’ win ahead of Saturday’s CCCAA Championship.\n\nOfficially a student of the Craft, Barton has been conditioned for this."
