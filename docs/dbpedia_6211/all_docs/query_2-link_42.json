        "text": "- BOULDER - A University of Colorado football player accused of assaulting his pregnant wife will have his criminal record wiped clean if he stays out of trouble during the next 18 months.\n\nDamion Barton, 21, pleaded guilty Wednesday to third-degree assault and wiretapping. In exchange, Barton received a deferred sentence from Judge Dan Hale.\n\nBoth misdemeanor charges relate to a Feb. 28 fight with his then pregnant wife, 19-year-old Kalani.\n\nProsecutor Kathy Delgado asked Hale not to impose a jail sentence, saying the attack by Barton on his wife was out of character. Delgado talked to both Barton's CU counselor and his wife before she made her recommendations.\n\n\"I truly got a sense from him that he was worthy of a second chance,\" Delgado said.\n\nBarton began counseling almost immediately after the incident and has consistently shown remorse for what he did, she said.\n\n\"He's a really good kid,\" said Barton's lawyer, Louis Rubino. \"We can make this family happy and healthy and better because of this unfortunate experience.\"\n\nBarton is a junior cornerback for CU.\n\nHe was originally charged with felony menacing, third-degree assault, false imprisonment and wiretapping.\n\nThe day of the attack, the couple argued after Barton's wife accused him of using the Internet to cheat on her, according to police reports.\n\nAt one point, Kalani Barton tried to leave the apartment but was carried back into the apartment bedroom. Barton then put her on the bed and cut her hair with scissors, according to police reports.\n\nBarton took responsibility for his \"immature and foolish\" actions, Rubino said. Barton had no scraps with the law until this incident.\n\nHe is doing well in his domestic violence classes and is serious about expunging his criminal past because he wants to be an FBI agent, Rubino said.\n\n\"Damion's a pretty amazing kid, and he has a lot of people around him who want him to succeed,\" Rubino said."
