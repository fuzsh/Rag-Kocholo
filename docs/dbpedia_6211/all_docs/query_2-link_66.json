        "text": "Drew Barton\n\nMen's Basketball 7/16/2024 1:30:00 PM\n\nSummer Spotlight: Damian Forrest signs pro contract in Germany\n\nFormer standout forward to play for Nuernberg Falcons\n\niFLORENCE, Ala. (July 16, 2024) – Another Lion has gone pro.\n\nWithin the last month, the University of North Alabama has announced professional opportunities for both former UNA volleyball standout Anna Kathrine Griggs and former UNA golfer Carter Goodwin.\n\nNow, men's basketball forward Damian Forrest can be added to the list.\n\nThis past Friday, the 2023 Atlantic Sun Conference All-Tournament selection and multi-time Academic All-ASUN selection signed a pro contract with Nuernberg Falcons BC in Germany. He will begin play this upcoming season.\n\nForrest said he would not have gotten here without his team at UNA, specifically his coaches who brought out his best.\n\n\"This would not have been possible without Coach Tony Pujol, Coach Ahmad Smith, as well as the rest of the UNA coaching staff,\" said Forrest, who completed three seasons games for the Lions. \"They brought me on years ago and saw the potential in me and greatness I can achieve before I even knew. They have helped me become not only a great basketball player, but a great man, and are instrumental in me being able to have achieved the opportunity to play professionally.\"\n\nForrest started 92 career games for the Lions over three seasons, making the fifth-most appearances for UNA since moving to Division I in 2018. As a senior, he averaged 10.4 points per game and a team-high 8.2 rebounds per game — which ranked second in the ASUN.\n\nThis past season, he scored his 1000th collegiate point against Morehead State, recorded three double-doubles, posted 16 games with double digit scoring totals and 12 with double-digit boards, set a new career-high in scoring with 21 points at Lipscomb and finished his career with 30 points and 19 rebounds over two tournament games in a run to the ASUN Semifinal Round.\n\n\"We are incredibly proud of Damian and his signing with the Nuernberg Falcons,\" said UNA head coach Tony Pujol. \"His discipline, determination and contagious personality has impacted our men's basketball program and the athletic department. He has been a great ambassador for the University of North Alabama and Shoals community. We look forward to watching Damian do great things in his professional career.\"\n\nHis position coach was Ahmad Smith, the Associate Head Men's Basketball Coach. Smith enjoyed a similar path to Forrest in the college ranks, spending two years at Cedar Valley Junior College before playing the final two at Appalachian State in the Southern Conference.\n\n\"A great accomplishment from a great person,\" said Smith of Forrest's signing. \"I am happy to be a part of his growth on and off the court. He exceeded expectations of what a student-athlete is all about at North Alabama. The sky is the limit for him.\"\n\nForrest is one of six Americans on the roster, while the other eight players are from Germany. He joins one other recent NCAA graduate, Mohamed Fofana, who is from Harlem, N.Y. and played at Valdosta State before joining the Nuernberg roster in 2023.\n\nOne interesting fact about Forrest is that he can speak multiple languages, including German. In fact, Forrest recorded an introduction video and addressed his new fan base in German. That video was recorded in the UNA locker room. A number of other Lions have gone pro from the basketball program, most recently Jamari Blackmon in Cyprus and Tavon King in Finland. Other notable recent pro players include Bilal Richardson (TBL) Aleksa Matic (Croatia) and Jere Vucica (Spain).\n\nWhile Forrest said he is excited to experience a new culture, he will continue to cherish his time in the Shoals.\n\n\"I am so grateful for UNA and the community of support and love that embraced me when I first got here,\" Forrest said. \"UNA and the surrounding community made my journey so enjoyable, helped me really fall in love with the game of basketball and created life-long friendships and relationships. It makes me proud to say I will always have a home in Florence because of that.\"\n\nFor more information on North Alabama Athletics, visit www.roarlions.com and follow UNA Athletics on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nPlayers Mentioned\n\n#33 Damian Forrest\n\nF\n\n6' 9\"\n\nJunior"
