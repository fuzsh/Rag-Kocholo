        "text": "Damian Barton is convinced that his Derry team can shock Ulster Championship favourites Tyrone in Sunday's game at Celtic Park.\n\n\"I'm confident we can go and win in Celtic Park. Without doubt,\" Barton told BBC Sport NI's Thomas Niblock.\n\n\"We have some fantastic players. We are in a period of transition and I'm not undermining Tyrone's characteristics because we know they have a classical defensive set-up and a classic counter-attacking team.\n\n\"We have to concentrate on us. We made too many basic errors (during the Football League), turning the ball over too easily and unfortunately they have been punished by teams like Tyrone.\n\n\"We've had to learn from that.\""
