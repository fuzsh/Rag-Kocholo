        "text": "A day of many positives for Barton Steven Doherty reports from Owenbeg DAMIAN Barton was much in demand after Derry’s ten point win over Antrim. He’ll have missed the chance to speak to his victorious players in the changing rooms after the match as they trundled past their managers who was knee-deep in interviews for television, radio and the printed press. Barton prefers the coaching side of his job, and while the post-match obligations took up a sizeable chunk of his time he’ll have been buoyed after witnessing such a sparkling performance from his team. It was a near perfect start to the year and promised much for the season ahead. “4-16 would make you happy,” said the new Derry manager, “2-12 and the nature of the two goals would not make you happy. I think we looked good at times going forward which has always been a bit of an Achilles heel for Derry. We’re very good defensively (traditionally). Offensively there were positives despite the conditions. I think we’ll take more positives from it that anything else.” All too often the Oakleafers have been accused of being too lateral in their attacks, but with Antrim, like Derry, unwilling to field any sweepers, Barton’s side produced a very attacking brand of football that was at it’s very best when early, dangerous ball was played into their deadly inside forward line of Ryan Bell and Emmet McGuckin. “Yeah, Ryan and Emmet inside. There was space in front of them and they are two big strong fellas and they were actually winning ball. So why not put it in in front of them. And there were things came off when we got it into the scoring zone as quick as possible. I think the two boys did very well. But I think there is more. You could see the skill level wasn’t what it should be. The work rate dropped before half-time and at certain stages you could feel it and see it in their bodies. There are wee things we need to address.” Barton acknowledged that the very open style of football suited Derry. “Look, that’s what boys train for don’t they. Put the ball over the bar, under the bar, create scores, and support in the final third of the pitch. It’s something that we will be trying to do a wee bit more often and more consistently. There’s a lot of boys we could throw in next week or the week after, and from that point of view it’s good to play competitive football.” Coleraine man Liam McGoldrick personified Barton’s belief that improving Derry’s athleticism and dynamism was crucial to his side’s chances of competing at the top level in 2016. “Liam McGoldrick’s a good athlete. It wouldn’t take a genius to work out we need athletes to play this game now – people that can get up and get back and support ahead of the ball moreso than laterally. Liam did fairly well, Danny (Heavron) did fairly well. Ciaran McFaul is an athlete as well. We just need to make sure we have a dozen others.” And along with the running side of the game, Barton also had the luxury of bringing on Slaughtneil star Christopher Bradley for his county debut. “Well Sammy’s a nice footballer. The game had fragmented a bit and we over-elaborated a few times, even in the first half in front of goal. He’s an excellent footballer and it’s nice to see a footballer express themselves. Derry have some great footballers. My expectation is that they express themselves – offensively as much as defensively.” With 2015 captain Mark Lynch starting on the bench, Chrissy McKaigue captained Damian Barton’s first 2016 side. However, the Newbridge man is determined to keep his options on that front open for the McKenna Cup at least. Derry’s general is anxious to see many of his foot soldiers step up to officer class. “They all should be captains shouldn’t they? I don’t know, we’ll have a different captain next week and a different captain against Queens. They all have to accept responsibility of managing it out on the pitch. If you think of the personnel we have, a lot of them are very quiet. So that’s something we need to develop within them as well – the communication aspect. But we’ll keep working at it.” An entertaining, heart-warming start for Derry, but with old foes arriving at Owenbeg on Sunday, Barton is certainly not getting too carried away. “Tyrone’s one of the top teams in the country. If Kerry were coming, if Dublin were coming they are special games and you have to treat Tyrone in the same bracket. We’ll not be making any real significant changes in terms of our game plan. We still want to go out and win the game. Tyrone are full of athletes and you could see that and that’s what they’ve been developing. That’s something we have to cope with next week – their running game.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW"
