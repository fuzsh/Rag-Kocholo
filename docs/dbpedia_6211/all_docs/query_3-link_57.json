        "text": "Derry manager Damian Barton went on the attack yesterday after his Derry side succumbed to a much stronger Tyrone at Celtic Park, 0-22 to 0-11.\n\nThe subject of Barton's ire, although not specifically named is most likely fellow county-man and former team mate Joe Brolly.\n\nBarton lashed back after rumours of a club - county divide in Derry were put to him In an interview with Newstalk after the game\n\nBarton nonsensed rumours about low turnouts for training in recent weeks, saying \"Rubbish. Absolute rubbish. There are a few begrudgers, and I can't understand what their nonsense is.\n\n\"It's strange. People might be doing gym work, and people might be out on the pitch; that's the way training is these days,\" he said.\n\n\"Some people would see 24 out on a pitch and think, 'Wait a minute, where's everyone else at?'.\n\n\"The bottom line is, and it's part of the bigger picture, that there are some very, very rich counties that are well-supported financially, and they can have 35 or 40 men at training, and they can go on holidays, or training camps. We can't do that.\n\n\"And this promotion of a top eight will make that gulf bigger. Counties like Derry don't need to do that, they don't need to be running with 35 or 40 players. So I don't know what the big deal is, but we've always had healthy numbers at training.\n\n\"There have been idiots who have been suggesting that they've been talking to players, and so on: they haven't been talking to anyone. I can think of one pundit in particular. Absolute trash. We should just put 'attention seeker' on his forehead. It's hard to believe he is a Derry person.\n\n\"Absolutely crap. That's what galls me more than most.\"\n\nWhen speaking to RTE, he said: \"Obviously, we have our critics, some of whom are amongst our own folk, which is absolutely ridiculous.\n\n\"The begrudgery is quite incredible and there will we be a wee bit more after this.\n\n\"I can think of one pundit who suggested that Tyrone would be popping their champagne once they saw the draw. He might drink some with them tonight!\""
