Derry were relegated to Division Three earlier this year.\n\n“We would like to sincerely thank Damian, his management and backroom teams, and all the players who have represented their county during this period,” said Derry GAA.\n\n“Nominations for the position of Derry senior football manager will be sought from our clubs in the coming weeks.”"
