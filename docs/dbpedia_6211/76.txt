Damian Barton is going to be retained as Derry senior football manager.

The 1993 All-Ireland winner and his backroom team will be put forward at tonight's County Board meeting for reappointment for a second year in charge of the Oak Leaf County.

In 2016, the Newbridge man brought Derry to within touching distance of a first All-Ireland quarter-final appearance in nine years (they were edged out by three injury-time Tipperary points at Breffni Park) and his retention alongside Tony Scullion, Brian McGuckin and Hugh McGrath is expected to be a formality.
