'Caught in the Rain' is the first movie entirely directed and written by Charles Chaplin. Although he had tried his hand in directing before once and had helped to write other movies, this movie can be named as his directorial debut. The film was released at the beginning of May - so within four months in the Keystone Charles Chaplin had risen from beginner movie actor to movie director. 'Caught in the Rain' is a comedy that is quite equal to other better Keystone productions. A private screening to usual Keystone directors was held and they were impressed by Chaplin's work. So, that says something.

Although quite a good and entertaining movie, the genius we all know Chaplin now, doesn't show yet. What this movie proves, is that Chaplin was a quick learner to create such a coherent work of comedy so early in his career. Charming but the humor is still not so well refined. He still plays on his, by this time, so familiar drunk who makes passes on the women act.
