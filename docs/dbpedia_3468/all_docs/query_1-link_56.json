        "text": "Charlie Chaplin was an English actor and comedian.\n\nBiography[]\n\nBorn in London, England to two stage performers, Chaplin followed his mother Hannah onto the stage, before going onto to work with impresario Fred Karno as a comedy performer. Whilst on tour in America he made his screen debut in Making a Living and soon after made his directorial debut with Caught in the Rain, as well as introducing \"The Tramp\" to screen audiences.\n\nChaplin became hugely successful as the director and star of silent comedies such as The Kid, The Gold Rush and Modern Times before transitioning into \"talkies\", most notably with the satirical The Great Dictator and Limelight, which he appeared in opposite his comic rival Buster Keaton.\n\nChaplin passed away in 1977.\n\nSinging[]\n\nWhilst Chaplin often wrote songs for his puctures, he also occasionally performed songs, singing \"Swing, Little Girl\" for the sound rerelease of The Circus and \"Le cherche après Titine\" in Modern Times. He also sang a number of songs in 1952's Limelight.\n\nFilm[]\n\nThe Circus (1928)[]\n\nSwing, Little Girl (solo)\n\nModern Times (1936)[]\n\nLe cherche après Titine (solo)\n\nLimelight (1952)[]\n\nThe Animal Trainer (solo)\n\nSpring is Here (solo)\n\nThe Life of a Sardine (solo)"
