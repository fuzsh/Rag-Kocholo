        "text": "Today is anniversary of Charlie Chaplin’s debut as solo director of a film, Caught in the Rain (1914).\n\nThe film is a fairly routine little Sennett style Francophile farce. It starts out in a park. Chaplin moves in on Mack Swain’s wife (Alice Davenport) while the poor schmo is buying candy. A squabble. Then Charlie follows the couple back to their hotel. Lots of the usual farce about who is in who’s bedroom when. At one point Charlie is stuck hiding on the roof outside in the rain, hence the title. A quiet, sensible beginning to an extraordinary career."
