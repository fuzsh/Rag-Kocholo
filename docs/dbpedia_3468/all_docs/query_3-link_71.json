        "text": "Directorsâ€™ 100 Greatest Films of All Time 2012\n\nThe 100 best movies of all time, as chosen by 358 directors including Roy Andersson, Charles Burnett, Francis Ford Coppola, Guillermo del Toro, Mia Hansen-LÃ¸ve, Koreeda Hirokazu, Joanna Hogg, Bong Joon-ho, Miranda July, Asif Kapadia, Michael Mann, Steve McQueen, Tsai Ming-Liang, Carol Morley, Horace OvÃ©, Pawel Pawlikowski, the Safdie Bros., Hong Sangsoo, Martin Scorsese, Cate Shortland, Quentin Tarantino, Apichatpong Weerasethakulâ€¦\n\nUpdated: 2 June 2021\n\nSign up for Sight and Soundâ€™s Weekly Film Bulletin and more\n\nNews, reviews and archive features every Friday, and information about our latest magazine once a month.\n\nEmail\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn these celebrity-centred times, itâ€™s a refreshing anomaly that our poll of directorsâ€™ top ten greatest films of all time is secondary to the criticsâ€™ poll.\n\nBut since the criticsâ€™ poll has been going since 1952, and the directorsâ€™ only since 1992, itâ€™s the former that has the gravitas.\n\nBut the directorsâ€™ choices this time have created their own startling surprise. Not only has Citizen Kane not won, it hasnâ€™t even come a clear second, while the criticsâ€˜ favourite, Vertigo, isnâ€™t even in the top six. The winner, Ozuâ€™s magisterial Tokyo Story, is of course a mainstay in these lists, and yet itâ€™s intriguing that it should top the directorsâ€™ poll, for the formal aesthetic of Ozuâ€™s films is so singular, so patient and precise, that his direct influence on the films of other directors is not always obviously apparent. And yet the triumph of Tokyo Story (along with the presence of Bicycle Thieves at number 10) is a recognition of the fact that sometimes the most powerful films seem at first to be the simplest â€“ and that an unforgettably framed image of an ageing married couple sitting contemplatively on a seafront can say more than a thousand lines of dialogue.\n\nItâ€™s striking also that where the criticsâ€™ top ten features three films from the silent era, and nothing later than the 1960s, the earliest film on the directorsâ€™ list is Citizen Kane (1941). The directors have chosen four films from the 1970s, including two mid-decade films making their first appearance in the top ten: Tarkovskyâ€™s poetic and intimate Mirror and Scorseseâ€™s Taxi Driver, which interestingly replaces Raging Bull, a fixture in the directorsâ€™ top ten in both 1992 and 2002.\n\nThe appearance of such boldly defiant, bravura technical accomplishments as 2001, Apocalypse Now, Citizen Kane and The Godfather might be expected, for each stands as magnificent proof that boundless ambition need not equal folly. The legendary stories of their production are a reminder to anyone picking up a camera that after the blood, sweat and tears of creation â€“ a process best captured, of course, by Fellini in 8Â½ â€“ there just might come a triumph.\n\nâ€” James Bell\n\nDirectorsâ€™ top 100 films\n\n1. Tokyo Story\n\nOzu YasujirÃ´, 1953\n\n48 votes\n\nThe final part of Ozu YasujirÃ´â€™s loosely connected â€˜Norikoâ€™ trilogy is a devastating story of elderly grandparents brushed aside by their self-involved family.\n\nSubtle and sensitive, Tokyo Story lets the viewer experience the tensions and demands that modern life makes on people â€“ here family members.\n\nâ€” Adoor Gopalakrishnan\n\n=2. 2001: A Space Odyssey\n\nStanley Kubrick, 1968\n\n42 votes\n\nStanley Kubrick took science fiction cinema in a grandly intelligent new direction with this epic story of manâ€™s quest for knowledge.\n\nThis is the film Iâ€™ve seen more than any other in my life. 40 times or more. My life altered when I discovered it when I was about seven in Buenos Aires. It was my first hallucinogenic experience, my great artistic turning-point and also the moment when my mother finally explained what a foetus was and how I came into the world. Without this film I would never have become a director.\n\nâ€” Gaspar NoÃ©\n\n=2. Citizen Kane\n\nOrson Welles, 1941\n\n42 votes\n\nGiven extraordinary freedom by Hollywood studio RKO for his debut film, boy wonder Welles created a modernist masterpiece that is regularly voted the best film ever made.\n\nWellesâ€™s feat of imagination in Citizen Kane remains dazzling and inspiring. Cinema aspiring to great art, political import â€“ and delivered with unabashed showmanship. The fervour of the work is as excited and electric as ever. The thriller plot never disappoints.\n\nâ€” Kenneth Branagh\n\n4. 8Â½\n\nFederico Fellini, 1963\n\n40 votes\n\nFederico Fellini triumphantly conjured himself out of a bad case of creative block with this autobiographical magnum opus about a film director experiencing creative block.\n\n8Â½ is a film I saw three times in a row in the cinema. This is chaos at its most elegant and intoxicating. You canâ€™t take your eyes off the screen, even if you donâ€™t know where itâ€™s heading. A testament to the power of cinema: you donâ€™t quite understand it but you give yourself up to let it take you wherever.\n\nâ€” Pen-Ek Ratanaruang\n\nA true classic has to be both intimate and universal. To speak about cinema through cinema requires a voice unwavering in its passion and purity. 8Â½ speaks as much about life as it does about art â€“ and it makes certain to connect both. A portrait of the teller and his craft â€“ a lustful, sweaty, gluttonous poem to cinema.\n\nâ€” Guillermo del Toro\n\n5. Taxi Driver\n\nMartin Scorsese, 1976\n\n34 votes\n\nMartinâ€™s Scorseseâ€™s unsettling story of disturbed New York cab driver Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) is a classic of 70s cinema.\n\nA film so vivid, hypnotic and corrosive that it feels forever seared onto your eyeballs, Taxi Driver turns a city, a time and a state of mind into a waking nightmare thatâ€™s somehow both horribly real and utterly dreamlike.\n\nâ€” Edgar Wright\n\n6. Apocalypse Now\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola, 1979\n\n33 votes\n\nTransplanting the story of Joseph Conradâ€™s colonial-era novel Heart of Darkness to Vietnam, Francis Ford Coppola created a visually mesmerising fantasia on the spectacle of war.\n\nCoppola evoked the high-voltage, dark identity quest, journeying into overload; the wildness and nihilism â€“ all captured in operatic and concrete narrative, with the highest degree of difficulty. A masterpiece.\n\nâ€” Michael Mann\n\n=7. The Godfather\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola, 1972\n\n31 votes\n\nThe first of Francis Ford Coppolaâ€™s epic trilogy about the Corleone crime family is the disturbing story of a son drawn inexorably into his fatherâ€™s Mafia affairs.\n\nA classic, but I never tire of it. The screenplay is just so watertight, and Michaelâ€™s journey is one of the best protagonist arcs ever created.\n\nâ€” Justin Kurzel\n\n=7. Vertigo\n\nAlfred Hitchcock, 1958\n\n31 votes\n\nA former detective with a fear of heights is hired to follow a woman apparently possessed by the past, in Alfred Hitchcockâ€™s timeless thriller about obsession.\n\n[These are the scenes or aspects I usually think about in the movies I have thought about most oftenâ€¦] In Vertigo, after heâ€™s worked so hard to remake her and finally she emerges: hair dyed platinum, grey suit, misty lens. Itâ€™s her!\n\nâ€” Miranda July\n\n9. Mirror\n\nAndrei Tarkovsky, 1974\n\n30 votes\n\nAndrei Tarkovsky drew on memories of a rural childhood before WWII for this personal, impressionistic and unconventional film poem.\n\nI must have been around 13 when I first watched Mirror. This time I realised that there are films that are not even meant to be â€˜understoodâ€™. Itâ€™s the poetry of cinema in its purest form, on a very delicate verge of being pretentious â€“ which makes its genius even more striking.\n\nâ€” Alexei Popogrebsky\n\n10. Bicycle Thieves\n\nVittorio De Sica, 1949\n\n29 votes\n\nVittorio De Sicaâ€™s story of a father and son searching for a stolen bicycle on the streets of Rome is a classic of postwar Italian cinema.\n\nMy absolute favourite, the most humanistic and political film in history.\n\nâ€” Roy Andersson\n\n11. Breathless\n\nJean-Luc Godard, 1960\n\n27 votes\n\nAbout an American girl studentâ€™s encounter with a young hoodlum in Paris.\n\nThe first modern movie, pure cinema avant-garde.\n\nâ€” Manuel Ferrari\n\n12. Raging Bull\n\nMartin Scorsese, 1980\n\n26 votes\n\nStarring Robert De Niro as the middleweight boxer Jake La Motta, Scorseseâ€™s biopic is widely acknowledged as one of the greatest films of the 1980s.\n\nExtremely brutal, extremely beautiful, Raging Bull is a film of confession and redemption. Perhaps one of the last great films from Hollywood before it turned its back completely on an adult audience.\n\nâ€” Pen-Ek Ratanaruang\n\n=13. Persona\n\nIngmar Bergman, 1966\n\n24 votes\n\nA nurse (Bibi Andersson) and an actress who refuses to speak (Liv Ullmann) seem to fuse identities in Ingmar Bergmanâ€™s disturbing, formally experimental psychological drama.\n\nMy favourite of Bergmanâ€™s psychological chamber films.\n\nâ€” Greg Mottola\n\n=13. The 400 Blows\n\nFranÃ§ois Truffaut, 1959\n\n25 votes\n\nThe directorial debut of film critic FranÃ§ois Truffaut, this autobiographical story of a wayward child marked a fresh start for French cinema.\n\nThe 400 Blows is a highly sensitive recreation of Truffautâ€™s own difficult childhood, unsympathetic parents, oppressive teachers and petty crime â€“ a remarkable first feature, mirroring oneâ€™s own life and times so effectively.\n\nâ€” Adoor Gopalakrishnan\n\n=13. Andrei Rublev\n\nAndrei Tarkovsky, 1966\n\n25 votes\n\nThe life of a 15th century icon painter takes centre stage in Andrei Tarkovskyâ€™s epic meditation on the place of art in turbulent times.\n\nAn Ivan the Terrible of the post-Stalinist generation, Andrei Rublev is a manifesto for the continuity of Russian thinking that undermined the Soviet system. The creatorâ€™s fable in the third act remains one of the most imposing pieces of its kind in the entire history of art.\n\nâ€” Andrei Ujica\n\n16. Fanny and Alexander\n\nIngmar Bergman, 1984\n\n24 votes\n\nThe grand summation of Ingmar Bergmanâ€™s career, this epic family drama drew on the directorâ€™s own childhood experiences in early 20th century Sweden.\n\nFanny & Alexander wonderfully encapsulated the history of the baleful effect of Christianity on paganism. Plus the first hourâ€™s wonderful evocation of the childâ€™s perfect Christmas.\n\nâ€” Terry Jones\n\n17. Seven Samurai\n\nAkira Kurosawa, 1954\n\n22 votes\n\nRice farmers hire a band of samurai to defend them against marauding bandits in Akira Kurosawaâ€™s influential epic, a touchstone for action movies ever since.\n\nGroundbreaking cinema that set the standard for action films, weaving great characterisation, a strongly crafted story and stunning cinematography to ultimately offer a compelling philosophy about the nature of violence.\n\nâ€” Ann Turner\n\n18. Rashomon\n\nAkira Kurosawa, 1950\n\n21 votes\n\nCredited with bringing Japanese cinema to worldwide audiences, Akira Kurosawaâ€™s breakthrough tells the story of a murder in the woods from four differing perspectives.\n\nThe only thing that is fact in this film is that a samurai is dead and a woman has been raped. Akiru Kurosawaâ€™s tale unfolds to challenge our perceptions of truth and plays with what our expectations of this elusive search are. This is filmmaking of the highest order.\n\nâ€” Akin Omotoso\n\n=19. Barry Lyndon\n\nStanley Kubrick, 1975\n\n19 votes\n\nStanley Kubrickâ€™s exquisitely detailed adaptation of William Makepeace Thackerayâ€™s novel about the picaresque exploits of an 18th century Irish adventurer.\n\nA kind of perfect film â€“ a fully realised universe, like walking through a living, breathing museum. The scale of achievements within the cinematography alone will never be equalled. Baroque, elegant, and yet somehow still raw, it is film as dreamscape, every individual component subjugated to the expression of the whole. Kubrick seems interested in everything in ways other filmmakers seem not to be. The rigour behind this film and his wish to strive for perfection, for something not yet seen, is unbelievable. The interaction of image and music is perfect. The wordless seduction of Lady Lyndon by Barry set to Schubert is one of the most sublime sequences in film: the play of glances at the card table (noticed by her companion), Lady Lyndonâ€™s slow walk outside, Barryâ€™s approach glimpsed through the window, the slow tracking shot as he approaches her, the turn, the gaze, the first kiss. Incredible.\n\nâ€” Duane Hopkins\n\n=19. Ordet\n\nCarl Theodor Dreyer, 1955\n\n19 votes\n\nThe penultimate film by the Danish master Carl Theodor Dreyer is a parable on the power of faith, set in a remote religious community.\n\nOrdet touches your inner side deeply. You feel the invisible world. From the moment you see this film, you start to believe in miracles â€“ motion pictures being one of them! There might not be a better film in white (nor in black-and-white) and no better hypnotism of space.\n\nâ€” Luis MiÃ±arro\n\n21. Au Hasard Balthazar\n\nRobert Bresson, 1966\n\n18 votes\n\nRobert Bressonâ€™s distinctive pared down style elicits extraordinary pathos from this devastating tale of an abused donkey passing from owner to owner.\n\nAu hazard Balthazar is a hieratic but nevertheless profoundly moving film, by the auteur who perhaps, more than any other, explored the specific possibilities of cinematographic expression.\n\nâ€” EugÃ¨ne Green\n\n=22. Modern Times\n\nCharles Chaplin, 1936\n\n17 votes\n\nThe final outing for Charlie Chaplinâ€™s beloved Tramp character finds him enduring the pratfalls and humiliations of work in an increasingly mechanised society.\n\nAbsolute genius of cinema. Director, producer, screenwriter, Chaplin did everything! I choose Modern Times but several films from him could be in this list.\n\nâ€” Pablo Giorgelli\n\n=22. Lâ€™Atalante\n\nJean Vigo, 1934\n\n17 votes\n\nNewly-weds begin their life together on a working barge in this luminous and poetic romance, the only feature film by director Jean Vigo.\n\nThat underwater scene where Jean opens his eyes underwater in a despondent cleansing, a scene thatâ€™s been homaged a million times ([The] Graduate being the most obvious to me), carries me through most days. Jean Vigo is a god. He was the son of an outlaw. Also this was an introduction to Michel Simon for me. Emotional, Sloppy, Manic, Cinema.\n\nâ€” Josh Safdie\n\n=22. Sunrise\n\nF. W. Murnau, 1927\n\n17 votes\n\nLured to Hollywood by producer William Fox, German Expressionist filmmaker F.W. Murnau created one of the silent cinemaâ€™s last and most luminous masterpieces.\n\nA big budget Hollywood movie with plenty of special effects, 1920s style. Murnau for greatest director?\n\nâ€” Ben Hopkins\n\n=22. La RÃ¨gle du jeu\n\nJean Renoir, 1939\n\n17 votes\n\nMade on the cusp of WWII, Jean Renoirâ€™s satire of the upper-middle classes was banned as demoralising by the French government for two decades after its release.\n\nA big budget Hollywood movie with plenty of special effects, 1920s style. Murnau for greatest director?\n\nâ€” Ben Hopkins\n\n=26. Touch of Evil\n\nOrson Welles, 1958\n\n15 votes\n\nOrson Wellesâ€™s return to Hollywood after ten years working in Europe is a sleazy border tale in which he takes centre stage as gargantuan detective Hank Quinlan.\n\nThe second Orson Welles movie in my list. Citizen Kane is his most acclaimed work but personally I love this one even more. The story has its wonderful pulpy aspects but Welles gives it tremendous ambivalence and depth. Directed with great gusto, awesome photography and wonderful music by the great Henry Mancini.\n\nâ€” Martin Koolhoven\n\n=26. The Night of the Hunter\n\nCharles Laughton, 1955\n\n15 votes\n\nActor Charles Laughtonâ€™s only film as a director is a complete one-off, a terrifying parable of the corruption of innocence featuring a career-best performance from Robert Mitchum.\n\nThis tense, exquisite, malevolent little song is one of the most beautiful things that I have ever seen after Rembrantâ€™s The Abduction of Proserpina.\n\nâ€” Emily Wardill\n\n=26. The Battle of Algiers\n\nGillo Pontecorvo, 1966\n\n15 votes\n\nGillo Pontecorvoâ€™s masterpiece about the turbulent last years of French colonial rule in Algeria, seen from the perspective of both the guerrilla revolutionaries and the French authorities.\n\nThe Battle of Algiers for me is the combination of Battleship Potemkin and Pather Panchali. Itâ€˜s not simply political. It has a documentary feel to it, which makes it convincing and strong.\n\nâ€” Kutlug Ataman\n\n=26. La strada\n\nFederico Fellini, 1954\n\n15 votes\n\nA brutish travelling strongman (Anthony Quinn) acquires a waif-like young assistant (Giulietta Masina) before taking to the road in Federico Felliniâ€™s acclaimed neo-realist fable.\n\nLa strada is a great saga of love and bondage, very raw and real, almost brutal in its portrayal. The images are so strong that they refuse to dim with the passage of time.\n\nâ€” Adoor Gopalakrishnan\n\n=30. Stalker\n\nAndrei Tarkovsky, 1979\n\n14 votes\n\nAs a teenager, I used to go the Everyman cinema in Hampstead where I would devour the films of Tarkovsky, Bergman, Rosselini, Fellini and other giants of what was then hard-to-find â€˜alternativeâ€™ cinema. Stalker is a film I keep returning to for its equivocal plot, atmospheric score and beautiful camera work.\n\nâ€” Gary Tarn\n\n=30. City Lights\n\nCharles Chaplin, 1931\n\n14 votes\n\nThe Tramp wins the affections of a blind flower seller (Virginia Cherrill) in this hilarious but heartbreaking comedy â€“ one of Charlie Chaplinâ€™s uncontested masterpieces.\n\nChaplin was the best at everything: actor, director, screenwriter, producer, clown, acrobat, dancer, musician. The art of counterpoint: scenes that are still funny today, in a melodramatic script thatâ€™s stayed touching. Itâ€™s impossible not to cry in the last scene, one of the most beautiful scenes ever made.\n\nâ€” Michel Hazanavicius\n\n=30. Lâ€™Avventura\n\nMichelangelo Antonioni, 1960\n\n14 votes\n\nIn Michelangelo Antonioniâ€™s groundbreaking and controversial arthouse milestone, the mystery of a womanâ€™s disappearance from a Mediterranean island is left unresolved.\n\nAll ten on this list could be Antonioni films. Every one of them changed the game, especially from this film on. It was as if the window panes had been cleaned and you could see the world you lived in more clearly. With this film, cinema came out of the cave.\n\nâ€” Ron Peck\n\n=30. Amarcord\n\nFederico Fellini, 1972\n\n14 votes\n\nFederico Fellini returned for inspiration to his own childhood in 1930s Rimini for this colourful comedy-drama about life in a small seaside town under Fascist rule.\n\nA film hand-woven with memories, made to be remembered even before having seen it.\n\nâ€” Rodrigo CortÃ©s\n\n=30. The Gospel According to St Matthew\n\nPier Paolo Pasolini, 1964\n\n14 votes\n\nPier Paolo Pasoliniâ€™s third feature abandons the profane in favour of the sacred in a documentary-like retelling of the story of Christ.\n\nOnly an atheist director could make the ultimate film about religion.\n\nâ€” Bruce LaBruce\n\n=30. The Godfather: Part II\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola, 1974\n\n14 votes\n\nThe expansive second part of Francis Ford Coppolaâ€™s Mafia saga continues the Corleone family story, charting in parallel young Vitoâ€™s earlier rise to prominence.\n\nSequels are tough at the best of times. Francis Ford Coppola not only redefined what a sequel could be but he achieved something that is notoriously difficult in film: two timelines, father and son, merge to give a complete story of the Corleones. This film is a gem.\n\nâ€” Akin Omotoso\n\n=30. Come And See\n\nElem Klimov, 1985\n\n14 votes\n\nByelorussia, 1943. Story of Flera, a youth who joins the partisans, before the Nazis execute all the inhabitants of his village. Flera witnesses many atrocities committed by the Nazis and is physically aged by his experiences.\n\nItâ€™s no wonder Klimov could never make a movie after this. How could you? Filmmaking at the highest level.\n\nâ€” Darrell James Roodt\n\n=37. Close-Up\n\nAbbas Kiarostami, 1989\n\n13 votes\n\nDrama-documentary, based on the true story of an unemployed movie buff, Hossein Sabzian, who passes himself off as the celebrated movie director, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, to a woman he meets on a bus. He is invited into her middle-class home and leads her family to believe that, if they finance him, they will appear in his next film. Eventually, they come to suspect he is an imposter and call the police. He ends up in jail where his trial is filmed by Kiarostamiâ€¦\n\nA re-enactment of a re-enactment of a re-enactment, Close Up essentially destroys the very conception of a â€˜documentaryâ€™ and yet is one of the best ever made.\n\nâ€” Ashim Ahluwalia\n\n=37. Some Like It Hot\n\nBilly Wilder, 1959\n\n13 votes\n\nOn the run from Chicago mobsters, two musicians don drag to join an all-girl jazz band fronted by Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) in Billy Wilderâ€™s hugely popular comedy.\n\nNo justification needed for Some Like It Hot, as it will appear in dozens of â€˜desert-island filmâ€™ lists. Sheer entertainment and great lines.\n\nâ€” Malcolm Le Grice\n\n=37. La dolce vita\n\nFederico Fellini, 1960\n\n13 votes\n\nFederico Felliniâ€™s epic charts a week in the life of a tabloid journalist (Marcello Mastroianni) as the excesses of modern Roman life go on around him.\n\nEver dear to me personally, La dolce vita was the first â€˜realâ€™ film I saw, when I was 13. Itâ€˜s also one of the most emblematic of Felliniâ€™s genius.\n\nâ€” EugÃ¨ne Green\n\n=37. The Passion of Joan of Arc\n\nCarl Theodor Dreyer, 1927\n\n13 votes\n\nSilent cinema at its most sublimely expressive, Carl Theodor Dreyerâ€™s masterpiece is an austere but hugely affecting dramatisation of the trial of St Joan.\n\nEver dear to me personally, La dolce vita was the first â€˜realâ€™ film I saw, when I was 13. Itâ€˜s also one of the most emblematic of Felliniâ€™s genius.\n\nâ€” EugÃ¨ne Green\n\n=37. Playtime\n\nJacques Tati, 1967\n\n13 votes\n\nJacques Tati directs and stars in this fun account of the bumbling M Hulotâ€™s day in Paris.\n\nTati is the most generous and humble filmmaker I know. The funniest and the most serious. He and Jerry Lewis are the best architects of cinema, of rhythm and colour; both of them remind us that the worst thing about humour is that nobody takes it seriously.\n\nâ€” Javier Rebollo\n\n=37. A Man Escaped\n\nRobert Bresson, 1956\n\n13 votes\n\nTrue story of the hazardous and daring wartime escape of a French officer from the condemned cell of a Nazi prison, with action set to Mozartâ€™s Great C-Minor Mass.\n\nNot quite sure what to say about this movie other than itâ€™s one of the top five movies ever made. When they touch the ground at the end, I feel like Iâ€™ve been escaping with them. Never has a movie that gives away its ending the title been more suspenseful. The spoon slot, the little broom, the handkerchief pulley systemâ€¦ Like Fontaine, Bresson is the master.\n\nâ€” Benjamin Safdie\n\n=37. Viridiana\n\nLuis BuÃ±uel, 1961\n\n13 votes\n\nIn Luis BuÃ±uelâ€™s controversial masterpiece, a novice nun gets more than she bargains for when she turns her dead uncleâ€™s estate into a home for beggars.\n\nUn Chien Andalou is still one of the most revolutionary films ever made but Viridiana has all BuÃ±uelâ€™s modernity in one mature work that contains the contradictory essence of the Spanish way.\n\nâ€” Luis MiÃ±arro\n\n=44. Once Upon a Time in the West\n\nSergio Leone, 1968\n\n12 votes\n\nThe railroad rushes westward, bringing power and progress with it, in Sergio Leoneâ€™s grandest spaghetti western, an operatic homage to Hollywoodâ€™s mythology of the Old West.\n\nOnce Upon a Time in the West is playful, political, poetic and so stylishly elaborate itâ€™s almost parodic. That westward bound train must be one of film historyâ€™s most potent metaphors.\n\nâ€” Arild Andresen\n\n=44. Le mÃ©pris\n\nJean-Luc Godard, 1963\n\n12 votes\n\nWorking with his biggest budget to date, Jean-Luc Godard created a sublime widescreen drama about marital breakdown, set during pre-production on a film shoot.\n\nA truly beautiful and sad self-reflective movie about filmmaking.\n\nâ€” Norbert Pfaffenbichler\n\n=44. The Apartment\n\nBilly Wilder, 1960\n\n12 votes\n\nIn Wilderâ€™s Oscar-winning comedy, Jack Lemmon plays an office worker who lends his apartment to adulterous superiors in order to get ahead.\n\nThe Apartment is the funniest recognition of the social climber that everybody has inside.\n\nâ€” Juan Carlos Fresnadillo\n\n=44. Hour of the Wolf\n\nIngmar Bergman, 1968\n\n11 votes\n\nPainterâ€™s pregnant wife tries to communicate with her husband, to give him the strength to combat his years and hallucinations, while he is obsessed with a woman with no understanding of the personality of the artist.\n\n=48. One Flew Over the Cuckooâ€™s Nest\n\nMilos Forman, 1975\n\n11 votes\n\nThe comic energy and tragic weight of Jack Nicholsonâ€™s unforgettable lead performance make this a classic of 70s cinema.\n\nA masterpiece for its characters, its actors, its story and its perfect blend of humor and drama.\n\nâ€” Jean-Marc VallÃ©e\n\n=48. The Searchers\n\nJohn Ford, 1956\n\n11 votes\n\nJohn Ford created perhaps the greatest of all westerns with this tale of a Civil War veteran doggedly hunting the Comanche who have kidnapped his niece.\n\nInscrutable faces under an endless sky. The dust of ages landing on a film.\n\nâ€” Rodrigo CortÃ©s\n\n=48. Psycho\n\nAlfred Hitchcock, 1960\n\n11 votes\n\nPsychological horror thriller about lonely, disturbed young Norman Bates with an unhealthy mother fixation who runs an out of the way motel which Marion Crane, on the run and with a guilty secret, makes the mistake of staying in.\n\nPsycho is a really strange black and white film where the protagonist dies halfway through. The viewer is left puzzled yet absorbed in the story. Unforgettable images: the shower, the stairs, the mansionâ€¦ What a risky and daring film!\n\nâ€” Fernando Colomo\n\n=48. Man with a Movie Camera\n\nDziga Vertov, 1929\n\n11 votes\n\nAn impression of city life in the Soviet Union, The Man with a Movie Camera is the best-known film of experimental documentary pioneer Dziga Vertov.\n\nAn honest self-portrait of what we documentarists still do, not in a much more sophisticated way.\n\nâ€” Petra Seliskar\n\n=48. Shoah\n\nClaude Lanzmann, 1985\n\n11 votes\n\nThe bravest tackling of the most difficult subject matter Iâ€™ve ever seen. Devastating and pitch-perfect.\n\nâ€” Saul Metzstein\n\n=48. Lawrence of Arabia\n\nDavid Lean, 1962\n\n11 votes\n\nAn eccentric English officer inspires the Arabs to unite against the Turks during WWI in David Leanâ€™s seven Oscar-winner, an epic in every sense.\n\nDavid Lean and JG Ballard raise issues of empire, colonialism and the individual on a platform of cinematic reflection. The screenplay by Bolt is brilliant. The characters, Oâ€™Tooleâ€¦ The epic nature of this film has for me never been topped.\n\nâ€” Oliver Schmitz\n\n=48. Lâ€™eclisse\n\nMichelangelo Antonioni, 1962\n\n11 votes\n\nAntonioniâ€™s film charts the hot and cold relationship of a young couple in bustling Rome.\n\nAntonioni [defined] the zeitgeist of the film century more precisely than any other.\n\nâ€” Thomas Clay\n\n=48. Pickpocket\n\nRobert Bresson, 1959\n\n11 votes\n\nPsychological study of a thief.\n\nThe most precise, scientific and, at the same time, realistic movie about a precise action.\n\nâ€” Manuel Ferrari\n\n=48. Pather Panchali\n\nSatyajit Ray, 1955\n\n11 votes\n\nThe first part of Satyajit Rayâ€™s acclaimed Apu Trilogy is a lyrical, closely observed story of a peasant family in 1920s rural India.\n\nOf all the films that Iâ€™ve ever seen, none can describe as deeply about the sacredness of humanâ€™s life as this beautiful and simple film does.\n\nâ€” Phan Dang-Di\n\n=48. Rear Window\n\nAlfred Hitchcock, 1954\n\n11 votes\n\nI clearly remember the excitement I felt when I saw this film. It was the first one I saw from Hitch. After that, I saw almost all his films over a short period. I was around 15 or 16 and my parents gave me a book about him as a present. This was the first book about cinema I had in my life.\n\nâ€” Pablo Giorgelli\n\n=48. GoodFellas\n\nMartin Scorsese, 1990\n\n11 votes\n\nWith GoodFellas Scorsese gives birth to the 21st century in one of the most influential films of the last two decades.
