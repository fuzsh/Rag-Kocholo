        "text": "Charlie Chaplin Filmography Continued\n\nKEYSTONE MUTUAL FIRST NATIONAL UNITED ARTISTS\n\nE S S A N A Y\n\nHis New Job\n\n1915 - Two Reels\n\nAKA Charlie's New Job\n\nCharlie Chaplin began his new job at Essanay Studios, who lured him away\n\nfrom Keystone with an offer of $1250 a week plus a bonus of $10,000, with a\n\nparody film on his former employer. It features two actresses at the\n\nbeginning of their careers in minor roles - Gloria Swanson and Agnes\n\nAyres.\n\nCharlie applies for work at the Lockstone Motion Picture Company.\n\nArriving at the office just after him is cross-eyed comedian Ben Turpin.\n\nCharlie is interviewed by the boss who uses a funnel and long tube as a\n\nhearing aid. Charlie uses the device with a cigarette in his mouth which\n\ngets lodged in the funnel. Charlie tries to dislodge it by pouring ink into\n\nthe funnel and blowing but ends up with the ink on his own face. Hired as\n\nan assistant carpenter/prop man, he disrupts rehearsals and gets into\n\ntrouble with the director. He is told to don an extra's military costume\n\nfor the Russian melodrama being filmed, but goes instead into the star's\n\ndressing room and steals his costume. Charlie is as inept as an actor as he\n\nis a carpenter, sitting on the train of the leading lady's gown, tearing it\n\noff as she walks up a staircase and blowing his nose in it as he overacts\n\ntearfully. (This scene contains one of the first dolly shots in Chaplin\n\nfilms). He later topples a large column which lands on top of him and is\n\nsat upon by Turpin, who, having replaced him as prop man is called to lift\n\nthe column.. Eventually, the star actor arrives and enraged at finding his\n\ncostume missing, starts a melee on stage which ends with everyone but\n\nCharlie unconscious.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Film Extra\n\nBen Turpin - Film Extra\n\nLeo White - Actor, Receptionist\n\nCharlotte Mineau - Film Star\n\nGloria Swanson - Extra, Stenographer\n\nAgnes Ayres - Extra, Secretary\n\nProduction Team\n\nCharles Chaplin - Screenwriter, Director\n\nJess Robbins - Producer\n\nThe Beautiful Edna Purviance\n\nA Night Out\n\n1915 - Two Reels\n\nIn his second Essanay comedy Charlie Chaplin is teamed with cross-eyed\n\ncomic Ben Turpin as two drunks on a spree. It is noteworthy as his first\n\nfilm with Edna Purviance, who was to be his love interest in films for the\n\nnext eight years, and in real life for the next three. It combines elements\n\nfrom at least three Keystones, Mabel's Strange Predicament, The\n\nRounders and Caught in the Rain, but uses a number of comic\n\ntranspositions of the type that were to become Chaplin's hallmark. Charlie\n\nand Ben carouse to a saloon and a restaurant, incurring the wrath of a\n\nFrench boulevardier and a restaurant manager. Ejected from the restaurant,\n\nthey return to their hotel room where they meet Edna, whose room is across\n\nthe hall. Charlie flirts with Edna until her husband, the restaurant\n\nmanager returns and chases him away. Charlie and Ben then have a fight and\n\nCharlie packs and leaves the hotel, checking into another one nearby. Edna\n\nand hubby decide they don't like the hotel either and move in to Charlie's.\n\nCharlie undresses for bed in his room while Edna, across the hall, plays\n\nfetch with her dog. When she throws her slipper into the hallway, the dog\n\ntakes it into Charlie's room and under his bed. Chasing the dog, Edna hides\n\nunder Charlie's bed when he re-enters the room from the bathroom. He\n\nescorts her back to her room but is caught there by the irate husband.\n\nWhen hubby draws a pistol Charlie escape through the window, but makes his\n\nway back into the hotel. He encounters Ben who has come looking for\n\nCharlie's share of the rent on their former room, and a fight ensues in\n\nwhich Charlie ends up floundering in the bathtub.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Drinker\n\nBen Turpin - Fellow Drinker\n\nBud Jamison - Head Waiter\n\nEdna Purviance - Head Waiter's Wife\n\nLeo White - French Boulevardier and Desk Clerk\n\nErnest Van Pelt -Second Desk Clerk\n\nProduction Team\n\nCharles Chaplin - Screenwriter, Director\n\nHarry Ensign - Cinematographer\n\nErnest Van Pelt - Asst. Director\n\nThe Champion\n\n1915 - Two Reels\n\nAKA Battling Charlie\n\nThe Champion, Chaplin's third film for Essanay, is easily his most\n\nadvanced film to date in plotting and characterization and one of the\n\nfunniest. We meet Charlie and his bulldog sharing a found hot dog, which\n\nthe dog won't eat until it is salted. They pass a gymnasium advertising\n\nfor sparring partners who can take a punch. Charlie finds a lucky horseshoe\n\nand after witnessing the condition of the previous sparring partners,\n\ndecides to employ it in his left boxing glove. He thereby kayos the club\n\nchamp and becomes the new golden boy. He begins to train for the big\n\nchampionship fight against Champ, Bud Jamison. The beautiful daughter of\n\nthe Gym owner, Edna Purviance gets his interest and seems taken with him.\n\nA shady character Leo White, a slimy betting tout, oozes into camp and\n\ntries to bribe Charlie into throwing the big fight, but while Charlie takes\n\nhis money, he treats him with total contempt. On the day of the fight\n\nCharlie says an emotional goodbye to his dog and enters the ring. In the\n\naudience are cowboy star Bronco Billy Anderson, one of the founders of\n\nEssanay (whose initials, along with partner George K. Spoor's are the\n\nsource of its name), and Ben Turpin as the vendor. The hilarious\n\nslapstick prizefight is pretty even at first but by the fourth round\n\nCharlie's getting the worst of it. Seeing the trouble his master is in, the\n\nbulldog jumps into the ring and restrains the opponent by the seat of his\n\npants while Charlie delivers a series of coup-de-grace punches. Charlie is\n\nhoisted on the shoulders of his cornermen as the new Champion.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Challenger\n\nEdna Purviance - Trainer's Daughter\n\n? - Trainer\n\nErnest Van Pelt - Club Champ, later Bud's Trainer\n\nBud Jamison - World Champion\n\nLeo White - Dishonest Better\n\nGilbert M.

Director\n\nIn The Park\n\n1915 - One Reel (12 minutes)\n\nCharlie Chaplin's fourth release for Essanay is very similar to his\n\nKeystone Twenty Minutes of Love. He had taken longer than planned to\n\ncomplete his previous film, The Champion, and he felt obliged to give\n\nEssanay a new film quickly, so he shot and edited this park farce in the\n\ncourse of a week. It opens with Leo White in his French Count costume and\n\nLeona Anderson (Broncho Billy's sister) spooning on a park bench, observed\n\nby an amused Edna Purviance seated on a nearby bench, wearing a nursemaid's\n\noutfit and minding a baby carriage. Charlie, strolling through the park, encounters an\n\ninept pickpocket, from whose pocket Charlie picks a cigarette and a match.\n\nCharlie comes upon the couple and mocking their emotions, gets chased away.\n\nEdna is joined by her boyfriend Bud Jamison, who goes off to buy a hot dog\n\nfrom a vendor. Finding Edna alone, Charlie makes eyes at her and gets a few\n\nsmiles in return, but when he tries to mash her she spurns him. Meanwhile\n\nthe pickpocket steals Leona's purse while the couple are necking.\n\nReturning to Edna, Bud chases Charlie away. Charlie encounters the same hot\n\ndog vendor and steals a string of hot dogs which he hangs from his breast\n\npocket and eats by swinging them up to his mouth. The pickpocket steals\n\nCharlie's hot dogs, but Charlie steals the purse from his pocket. While\n\nCharlie sells the purse to Bud for $2, the pickpocket starts a brick fight\n\nduring which everyone except Charlie is knocked out. Charlie gives the\n\npurse to Edna, who rewards him with a hug, but Bud awakens and returns to\n\nclaim the purse and Edna. By this time Leona has discovered her purse is\n\ngone and sends Leo over to Bud to retrieve it. He is beaten back by Bud and\n\nwhen Leona spurns him for his ineptitude he contemplates suicide. Charlie\n\ncomes along and obliges him by booting him into the lake. Meanwhile Leona\n\nhas summoned a cop who gets the purse back from Bud and confronts Charlie,\n\nbut ends up in the lake along with Bud, as Charlie strolls away.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Tramp\n\nEdna Purviance - Nursemaid\n\nBud Jamison - Her Boyfriend\n\nLeo White - European masher\n\nLeona Anderson - His Girlfriend\n\nErnest Van Pelt - Hot Dog seller\n\nPaddy McQuire - Hot Dog thief\n\nLloyd Bacon - Pickpocket\n\nProduction Team\n\nCharles Chaplin - Director, Screenwriter\n\nHarry Ensign - Cinematographer\n\nErnest Van Pelt - Assistant Director\n\nJess Robbins - Producer\n\nA Jitney Elopement\n\n1915 - Two reels - 26 mins\n\nAKA Charlie's Elopement\n\nMarried in Haste\n\nThe title of Charlie Chaplin's fifth comedy for Essanay refers to the\n\npopular term for a Model T Ford, a jitney. Its theme of impersonation was\n\none Chaplin had used before in Caught in a Cabaret and Her Friend the\n\nBandit, and would use again in The Count and other films. Charlie's\n\ngirlfriend Edna is about to be forced by her father to wed the wealthy\n\nCount de Ha-Ha, whom neither has met. Charlie, dropping by for a visit,\n\nstands below her bedroom window whistling for her. She tosses him a note\n\nfrom the Count, announcing his visit and pleads to be rescued. Charlie\n\nimpersonates the Count and is welcomed by her mercenary father. He's given\n\ndrinks and cigars and sits down to lunch with Edna and her father. Chaplin\n\nperforms a bit that he had done in one of the Karno sketches, that of\n\ncarving a loaf of bread into a spiral and using it as an accordion.\n\nAlthough his table manners are decidedly not upper class, Charlie pulls off\n\nthe impersonation until the real Count arrives. The enraged father kicks\n\nCharlie out of the house, then goes out for a spin with Edna and the Count\n\nin the latter's car. They drive to a park where father hopes the Count can\n\nsweet talk Edna into marrying him. At first horrified by his intentions,\n\nshe breaks out into gales of laughter at the sight of the tattered seat of\n\nhis pants. Charlie happens by and steals Edna away, dispatching Count and\n\nfather, along with a couple of cops. The fleeing couple steal the Count's\n\njitney, and lead Count, father and cop, now following in a car they've\n\ntaken, a merry chase. The chase leads them to a pier, where in a clever\n\nstop motion photography scene, the cars jockey about until Charlie bumps\n\nthe other car off the pier and into the water. A happy Charlie and Edna are\n\nabout to kiss as the film fades out.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Charlie\n\nEdna Purviance - Edna\n\nErnest Van Pelt - Her Father\n\nLeo White - Her Millionaire Suitor, Count de Ha-Ha\n\nLloyd Bacon - Butler & Policeman\n\nPaddy McQuire - Old Servant & Policeman\n\nBud Jamison - Policeman\n\nProduction Team\n\nCharles Chaplin - Screenwriter, Director\n\nJess Robbins - Producer\n\nHarry Ensign - Cinematographer\n\nErnest Van Pelt - Assistant Director\n\nThe Tramp\n\n1915 - Two Reels - 20 minutes\n\nThe Tramp, Charlie Chaplin's sixth film for Essanay is generally\n\nconsidered his first masterpiece. It is the first of his films that blended\n\npathos with comedy and contains subtle pantomime along with the knockabout\n\nslapstick. Charlie is truly a tramp in this film, wandering down a dusty\n\ncountry road carrying his bindle. He is knocked down by near misses from\n\ntwo passing autos and pulls a whisk broom from his pocket and dusts himself\n\noff. He sits by a tree to eat his lunch but it is stolen by a hobo, Leo\n\nWhite. Despondent, Charlie salts some grass and eats it. We next meet farm\n\ngirl Edna Purviance and her father Ernest Van Pelt, who gives her some\n\ncash and sends her on an errand. She stops on her way to count her money\n\nand is robbed by Leo. Her cries bring Charlie who rescues her from Leo and\n\ntwo other tramp thieves. Edna brings Charlie home to the farm where he is\n\nrewarded with a job as a farm hand. He is inept at the job, the source of\n\nseveral funny scenes with fellow hand Paddy McQuire. The three thieving\n\nhobos show up and try to involve Charlie in a scheme to rob the farmer's\n\nmoney. Charlie foils their efforts by hitting them on their heads with a\n\nmallet as they reach the top of the ladder that he has set up at his\n\nbedroom window. Farmer Ernest, alerted by the noise, grabs his shotgun and\n\nchases off the crooks, but Charlie gets shot in the leg accidentally. This\n\nscenes is played completely straight and is utterly convincing as Charlie\n\npasses out from the pain. Charlie is next seen recuperating from his\n\ninjuries, lounging at an outdoor table with Edna and squirting seltzer into\n\nhis drink. But his happiness is short lived. Edna's boyfriend, Lloyd\n\nBacon, arrives on the scene and Charlie, seeing that his love for Edna is\n\nunrequited, goes into the farmhouse and writes a note: \"i thout your\n\nkindness was love but it ain't cause i seen him\". He turns his back to the\n\ncamera and picks up Edna's hat, kisses it and walks outside. Bidding Edna\n\nand Lloyd farewell, Charlie refuses the money offered by Lloyd. The film\n\ncloses with what would become Chaplin's classic ending -Charlie walking\n\nsadly back along the road, but suddenly putting an optimistic little spring\n\nin his step as the camera irises in.\n\nThe iconic final scene\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - A Tramp\n\nEdna Purviance - Farmer's Daughter\n\nErnest Van Pelt - Farmer\n\nLloyd Bacon - Edna's boyfriend & thief\n\nPaddy McQuire - Farmhand\n\nLeo White - Tramp/thief\n\nBud Jamison - Thief\n\nBilly Armstrong - Poet\n\nProduction Team\n\nCharles Chaplin - Director, Screenwriter\n\nHarry Ensign - Cinematographer\n\nErnest Van Pelt - Assistant Director\n\nJess Robbins - Producer\n\nBy the Sea\n\n1915 -One Reel\n\nCharlie Chaplin's last one-reeler (with the exception of The Bond), is\n\nan impromptu film shot on the beach at Crystal Pier in Los Angeles, his\n\nfirst film shot there since leaving Keystone. It is superior to similarly\n\nmade Keystones in that the timing and gag ideas are much better realized.\n\nThe film opens with couple Billy Armstrong and Margie Reiger at the\n\nbeach on a windy day. Margie goes off telling Billy to stay put. Charlie\n\ncomes walking down a seaside street eating a banana and, after tossing the\n\npeel away, he slips on it. He encounters Billy when both men's hats,\n\nattached to them by elastics, get blown off by the wind and entangled. This\n\ncauses a fight between them in which Charlie gets Billy in a headlock and\n\nknocks him unconscious, but fleas from Billy's head jump onto Charlie's\n\narms. He performs a precursor of the flea circus routine that is featured\n\nin Limelight and the never released The Professor. Just then Edna\n\nPurviance passes by and Charlie flirts with her. She is amused by his\n\nantics despite herself. She goes off and sits down by her boyfriend, Bud\n\nJamison, who has been waiting for her on a nearby bench. Charlie and Billy\n\nmake up and Billy offers to buy them refreshments at a nearby ice cream\n\nstand operated by Snub Pollard. They again begin to fight as Billy\n\nrefuses to pay. During the fight Bud gets hit by flying ice cream and joins\n\nthe fray. The fight is broken up by a cop, who drags Billy off. Escaping,\n\nCharlie sits down next to Edna, bouncing her up and down by sitting down\n\nheavily. He's chased off by the returning Bud and joins Margie (who has\n\nbeen looking for Billy) on another bench until all the others arrive,\n\nwhereupon Charlie tips over the bench and makes his getaway.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Tramp\n\nBilly Armstrong - Husband\n\nMargie Reiger - Wife\n\nEdna Purviance - Girl\n\nBud Jamison - Jealous Boyfriend\n\nHarry \"Snub\" Pollard - Ice Cream Vendor\n\nEd Armstrong - Tobacconist\n\nErnest Van Pelt - Policeman\n\nPaddy McQuire - Policeman\n\nProduction Team\n\nCharles Chaplin - Director, Screenwriter\n\nHarry Ensign - Cinematographer\n\nErnest Van Pelt - Assistant Director\n\nJess Robbins - Producer\n\nWork\n\n1915 - Two Reels - 20 minutes\n\nWork, Charlie Chaplin's eighth film for Essanay casts Charlie as a\n\nwallpaper hanger's assistant who must pull the wagon containing the boss\n\n(Charles Insley) and all his gear through the city streets and up some\n\nimposing hills (created by using tilted camera angles). Charlie is little\n\nmore than a beast of burden and must do all the work when they arrive at a\n\nwealthy couple's (Billy Armstrong, Marta Golden) home. The woman of the\n\nhouse suspects the workers of being dishonest when she catches Charlie\n\nadmiring a small statue and locks up her valuables in a safe. This prompts\n\nCharlie to \"lock up\" his and his boss' watches and cash by pinning them\n\ninto his pants pocket. Charlie proves to be an inept decorator, making a\n\nhuge mess and causing his boss to get a bucket of wallpaper paste over his\n\nhead. He befriends Edna Purviance, the maid, and in a rather intimate\n\nscene, tells her his story and his hopes for the future. The wife's lover,\n\nLeo White arrives, but when he sees that Billy is still home, he pretends\n\nto be a workman. Billy is wise to the dodge and attacks Leo, eventually\n\npulling out a revolver and chasing him around the house. A stray bullet\n\nhits the gas stove which explodes, partially burying everyone. In the\n\nfamous last scene Charlie emerges from the inverted oven door, exhales some\n\nsmoke and sizing up the situation, smiles into the camera.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Charlie, the Paperhanger's Assistant\n\nEdna Purviance - Maid\n\nCharles Insley - Boss Paperhanger\n\nMarta Golden - Wife\n\nBilly Armstrong - Husband\n\nLeo White - Lover\n\nPaddy McQuire - Cart Passenger\n\nProduction Team\n\nCharles Chaplin - Director, Screenwriter\n\nHarry Ensign - Cinematographer\n\nErnest Van Pelt - Assistant Director\n\nJess Robbins - Producer\n\nA Woman\n\n1915 - Two reels - 20 minutes\n\nDirector Charles Chaplin\n\nCharlie Chaplin's ninth film for Essanay contains his third and last\n\nfemale impersonation. It begins, as so many of Chaplin's early films do, in\n\na park. Edna Purviance is seated on a park bench with her parents,\n\nCharles Insley and Marta Golden. Mother has fallen asleep and is\n\nsnoring loudly, much to Edna's disgust. Bored, Edna herself soon falls\n\nasleep and Father, spotting a fetching lady (Margie Reiger), chases after\n\nher. Charlie appears wandering through the park and, after Father departs\n\nto buy sodas, joins Margie and flirts with her. When Father returns he is\n\nenraged and hits Charlie on the head with one of the soda bottles,\n\nescorting Margie away. A couple of dandies out for a stroll, Leo White\n\nand Billy Armstrong, sit down next to Charlie and when he's caught taking\n\na sip out of one of their sodas, they fight. Leo runs away and Billy is\n\nknocked unconscious. Meanwhile Father and Margie are playing hide and seek\n\nand Margie has taken the opportunity of a blindfolded Father to escape.\n\nCharlie comes upon him and leads him around by the neck with his cane until\n\nthey reach the lake into which Charlie throws Father. Charlie wanders off\n\nto discover Edna and Mother still asleep. Awakened, they become acquainted,\n\ninviting Charlie home for tea. Father meets Billy and invites him home for\n\na drink. When they show up at home, Charlie is recognized and when a fight\n\nbreaks out, Charlie runs upstairs to hide. Hiding in Edna's room, he dons\n\nher dress and hat. Edna, finding Charlie in the hall falls down laughing at\n\nCharlie's female impersonation, but suggests he shave his mustache and don\n\na pair of her shoes. When this is done, the illusion is perfect. So\n\nperfect that both Father and Billy are totally fooled and flirt\n\noutrageously with Charlie, much to Edna's amusement and Mother's anger.\n\nBoth men ask for a kiss and Charlie suggests that they kiss opposite cheeks\n\nat the count of three. Of course Charlie steps back at three and the men\n\nkiss each other. This starts another fracas during which Billy is ejected\n\nfrom the house. Still enamoured, Father accidentally pulls off Charlie's\n\ndress, revealing his true identity. Edna intervenes and begs forgiveness\n\nfor Charlie, but Father gives him the boot and he ends up on the sidewalk\n\nbeside Billy to whom he delivers a knockout slap as the film ends.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Charlie\n\nEdna Purviance - Daughter\n\nCharles Insley - Father\n\nMarta Golden - Mother\n\nMargie Reiger- Girl in park\n\nBilly Armstrong - Father's Friend\n\nLeo White - Dandy in park\n\nJess Robbins - Soft drink salesman\n\nProduction Team\n\nCharles Chaplin - Director, Screenwriter\n\nHarry Ensign - Cinematographer\n\nErnest Van Pelt - Assistant Director\n\nJess Robbins - Producer\n\nThe Bank\n\n1915 - Two reels 20 minutes\n\nCharlie Chaplin's tenth Essanay film marks a further development for him\n\nin story construction, gag development and the use of pathos along with\n\nphysical comedy. Charlie enters the bank importantly, strolls down a\n\nstaircase and opens a large safe. But he emerges carrying a mop and bucket\n\nand dons his janitor's uniform. He wanders into the lobby/reception area\n\nand accidentally puts his soaking mop into the top hat of a bond salesman,\n\n(Lawrence A. Bowes) who's waiting for the arrival of the Bank President.\n\nHitting the salesman and a bank worker Leo White with the wet mop, he's\n\nchased away to the back office where he finds fellow janitor Billy\n\nArmstrong with whom a series of minor battles occur. Edna Purviance, a\n\nstenographer, arrives at work with a birthday present, a tie, for a cashier\n\nwho's name is also Charles, (Carl Stockdale). She types a note: \"To Charles\n\nwith love from Edna\". Charlie finds the note and tie and assumes they're\n\nfor him, and it's clear he loves Edna. He brings her a bouquet of flowers\n\nand leaves a note \"To Edna with love, Charlie\". The bank President arrives\n\nand rejects the bond salesman's pitch and the angry salesman vows revenge.\n\nAs the salesman stands dazed, Charlie, told to mail a letter, indicates\n\nthat he doesn't look well, takes his pulse and tells him to stick out his\n\ntongue, on which Charlie moistens the postage stamp. The Cashier comes in\n\nto thank Edna for the tie and tells her that it wasn't he who left the\n\nflowers, but Charlie the Janitor. Angry, Edna calls Charlie a fool and,\n\nunaware that he's watching through the door, throws the flowers into a\n\ntrash basket. Crushed, Charlie retrieves the flowers, goes back downstairs\n\nto the vault and sits down to rest. Shortly, the bond salesman along with\n\nfour seedy crooks enter the bank. Two of them go upstairs and see the\n\nPresident, Edna and the Cashier counting money. When Edna and Charles head\n\ndownstairs to the vault, they hold up the President. The other three\n\nintercept Charles and Edna downstairs. At the first opportunity Charles\n\npushes Edna over and runs away, but he's held at gunpoint by one of the\n\ncrooks as the other tussles with the President. Meanwhile Edna's screams\n\nhave awakened Charlie and he rescues her, kicking three of the crooks into\n\nthe safe and locking it as Edna collapses. Carrying her over one shoulder,\n\nhe climbs the stairs and rescues the cashier by disarming the crook. He\n\nthen takes care of the other thief, rescuing the President. When the\n\npolice have the robbers in custody, Charlie is congratulated by the\n\nPresident. He wanders into the office and takes the flowers out of his\n\ncoat. Edna enters and picks up the flowers, smiling, and the look of love\n\nand hope on Charlie's face is truly angelic. They embrace, but just then\n\nthe camera crossfades -it was all a dream, and Charlie awakens in the vault\n\nkissing a mop. As the picture fades he wanders off screen holding the\n\nflowers.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - The Janitor\n\nEdna Purviance - The Stenographer\n\nCharles Insley - The Bank President\n\nCarl Stockdale - Charles the Cashier\n\nBilly Armstrong - Another Janitor\n\nLawrence A.

Charlie is in love\n\nwith Edna, whose father owns a ship which he plans to have blown up for the\n\ninsurance money. Forbidden to see Charlie, Edna runs away, leaving a note:\n\n\"Father - I have stowed away on your boat. Goodbye. Your unhappy daughter,\n\nEdna\". Coincidentally, Charlie is hired to hit prospective crew members\n\nover the head with a mallet, whereupon they are shanghaied. He is himself\n\nshanghaied by the first mate in the same fashion. Charlie is a willing but\n\ninept seaman, knocking the whole crew overboard by misdirecting a loading\n\ncrane, and washing dishes in the soup that the cook is preparing. As the\n\nship's rolling increases, Charlie has difficulty serving dinner and becomes\n\nseasick. He discovers Edna hiding in the hold just before the Captain and\n\nFirst Mate light the fuse on a keg of TNT and escape in a launch.Meanwhile,\n\nEdna's father has found her note and is chasing after them in a speeding\n\nboat, trying to stop the explosion.

Chaplin plays two roles,\n\nMr. Pest, his famous inebriate role from the Karno sketch and Mr. Rowdy, a\n\ndrunk in the balcony. Mr. Pest disturbs his fellow audience members,\n\ncontinuously changing his seat and making passes at Edna Purviance, until\n\nher boyfriend returns to his seat. He gets into a row with the orchestra\n\nleader, John Rand, before being moved to a seat in a box by the stage.\n\nWhen the show starts he interferes in the acts, an exotic dancer, a snake\n\ncharmer, a fire eater and two terrible singers who are pelted with tomatoes\n\nand ice cream cones thrown by Mr. Rowdy from the balcony, much to the\n\ndelight of the audience. Alarmed by the fire eater, Mr. Rowdy fetches a\n\nfire hose and drenches everyone below, including his doppleganger, Mr.\n\nPest.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Mr. Pest/Mr. Rowdy\n\nFred Goodwins - Audience Member\n\nPaddy McQuire - musician (clarinet)\n\nJames T.

It is a parody of two contemporary films based on Bizet's opera,\n\nby Cecil B. De Mille (starring opera star Geraldine Farrar) and Raoul\n\nWalsh (starring vamp Theda Bara).\n\nChaplin plays Darn Hosiery (Don Jose) the Corporal of the Guard who is\n\nseduced by Carmen (engagingly played by Edna Purviance) so that Gypsy\n\nsmugglers can get their swag through the city gates. His chief rivals for Carmen's\n\naffections are Escamillo, the Toreador and a fellow soldier of the guard,\n\nLeo White. The interjection of the Turpin sections and the use of out takes of\n\nthe Chaplin materialmakes the plot rather murky.\n\nDon Jose is charmed by Carmen and ignores his military duties. He allows\n\nthe smugglers to enter the city gates but other\n\nguards, alerted by his rival White, give chase. Later, as the guards and\n\ngypsies struggle at a village gate, Don Jose gets into a duel for Carmen's\n\nattentions with White, during which Don Jose engages in some Chaplinesque\n\nfencing and wrestling, but aided by Carmen he kills White. Realizing the\n\ndepth of his deed he pursues Carmen who has taken off out a window. He\n\ncatches up with her, but the Toreador interrupts his accusations and takes\n\nCarmen away. Sometime later they are seen arriving at the bull ring. Don\n\nJose catches up with Carmen and, playing it perfectly straight, chillingly\n\naccuses her of infidelity and when she mocks his love, stabs her and then\n\nhimself. They are discovered by the Toreador, but Don Jose revives, mule\n\nkicks Escamillo back into the arena and picks up Carmen who also comes back\n\nto life. Looking into the camera, they smilingly show the audience the\n\ncollapsible knife as the camera irises in.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Darn Hosiery (Don Jose)\n\nEdna Purviance - Carmen\n\nJohn Rand - Escamillo, the toreador\n\nBen Turpin - Remendado, a smuggler\n\nLeo White - Officer of the Guard\n\nJack Henderson - Lilas Pastia\n\nWesley Ruggles - Vagabond\n\nMay White - Frasquita\n\nBud Jamison - Soldier\n\nLawrence A.

Charlie is released from prison with the customary few dollars\n\nin his pocket. He's approached on the street by a fake preacher who asks\n\nCharlie to \"Let me help you go straight\", making him sob with his touching\n\nsermon, while picking his pocket. Charlie encounters a drunk with his\n\npocket watch hanging from his vest, but resists the temptation of stealing\n\nit. A few moments later, after realizing he has been robbed, Charlie sees\n\nthe preacher with the drunk and notes, after the preacher departs, that the\n\nwatch is gone. Approached by a real preacher this time, Charlie chases him\n\ndown the street. As evening approaches Charlie goes to a seedy flop house,\n\nbut is ejected because he cannot pay. He encounters an old cell mate on the\n\nstreet and is recruited to participate in the robbery of Edna's house.\n\nCharlie proves an inept burglar making so much noise that Edna is roused\n\nand calls the police before confronting them. She begs them not to go\n\nupstairs because her mother is very ill and the shock might kill her. She\n\neven provides food and beer for the burglars, asking Charlie to let her\n\nhelp him to go straight. But Charlie's partner is heartless and heads\n\nupstairs despite Edna's pleas. When Edna tries to stop him he threatens to\n\nstrike her and that is too much for Charlie, who fights with the thief\n\nuntil the police arrive. Firing his pistol the thief escapes through a back\n\nwindow, but the cops catch Charlie before he can escape. Edna, grateful to\n\nCharlie for his protection lies to the police telling them Charlie is her\n\nhusband. After the cops leave, Edna gives Charlie a coin and sends him off\n\ndown the road in a spirit of renewed hope.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Tramp\n\nEdna Purviance - Girl\n\nWesley Ruggles - Thief\n\nBilly Armstrong - Fake Preacher and Policeman\n\nFred Goodwins - Real Preacher and Policeman\n\nBud Jamison - Flophouse patron\n\nPaddy McGuire - Flophouse patron\n\nHarry \"Snub\" Pollard - Flophouse patron\n\nJames T.

Director\n\nTriple Trouble\n\n1918 Two reels\n\nTriple Trouble, although commonly acknowledged in Chaplin filmographies,\n\nwas not really a Charlie Chaplin film in that it was released without his\n\npermission, and much to his annoyance by Essanay three years after he left\n\nthem. Its jumbled story is cobbled together out of pieces of Police,\n\nWork and the unfinished feature, Life, which Essanay insisted Chaplin\n\nabandon in favor of making more quickly produced two-reelers. It also\n\ncontains new footage shot in 1918 by Leo White in order to provide the\n\nweak plot on which to hang the Chaplin footage. Chaplin is a janitor in the\n\nhome of Colonel Nutt, the inventor of a new secret weapon, the wireless\n\nbomb. Edna Purviance is the cleaning woman in the same household and\n\nCharlie incurs her anger by spilling garbage on her clean floor, getting\n\nher into trouble with their boss, the cook Billy Armstrong. A group of\n\nforeign diplomats led by White plan to get the formula from the Professor\n\nby either bribe or theft. When he is ejected from the house by the butler\n\nat the Colonel's request, Leo hires a thief to do the dirty work, but is\n\noverheard by a cop. Meanwhile, in a scene excised from Life and\n\nPolice, Charlie goes to a flop house for the night where he encounters\n\nsome rather odd characters including a drunk who won't stop singing until\n\nCharlie smashes him with a bottle, but not before preparing his bed and\n\npillow and tucking him in afterward. A riot starts at the flophouse when\n\nCharlie robs a pickpocket who has been robbing the sleepers. Chaplin uses a\n\ngag he was to repeat in The Gold Rush, that of laying covered in bed,\n\nwrong way round, with hands in shoes. The thief, having co-opted Charlie,\n\narrives at the Nutt house and tries to steal the formula, but the cops are\n\nthere and a melee ensues in which the thief fires his gun into the\n\nColonel's invention and the house, the diplomats and everyone else\n\nexplodes. Charlie is seen emerging from the oven door - just as he had at\n\nthe end of Work.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Charlie, the Janitor\n\nEdna Purviance - Maid\n\nBilly Armstrong - Cook and Pickpocket\n\nWesley Ruggles - Crook\n\nLeo White - Diplomat/Spy and Flophouse owner\n\nJames T.
