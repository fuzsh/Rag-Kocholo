        "text": "Charlie Chaplin\n\nFrom \"Easy Street\" (1917) to \"Modern Times\" (1936), he made many of the funniest and most popular films of his time. He was best known for his character, the naive and lovable Little Tramp. The Little Tramp, a well meaning man in a raggedy suit with cane, always found himself wobbling into awkward situations and miraculously wobbling away. More than any other figure, it is this kind-hearted character that we associate with the time before the talkies. Born in London in 1889, Chaplin first visited America with a theater company in 1907. Appearing as \"Billy\" in the play \"Sherlock Holmes\", the young Chaplin toured the country twice. On his second tour, he met Mack Sennett and was signed to Keystone Studios to act in films. In 1914 Chaplin made his first one-reeler, \"Making a Living\". That same year he made thirty-four more short films, including \"Caught in a Cabaret\", \"Caught in the Rain\", \"The Face on the Bar-Room Floor\", and \"His Trysting Place\"\n\nCharlie Chaplin Powerpoint\n\nCharlie Chaplin Early years · Charles Spencer Chaplin was born in London on 26 April 1889. · Chaplin's childhood was fraught with poverty and hardship.

So television is the chief source of news for many households around the world. TV does what none of the other media can: it brings the sights and sounds of some importnant news events by means of filmed, taped, or live reports. In addition to daily news reports, television covers special news events. Coverage of such an event may replace many hours of regular TV shows.
