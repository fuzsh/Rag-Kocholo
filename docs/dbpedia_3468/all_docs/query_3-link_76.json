        "text": "So now we’re in the 1950s. It was a time of great conservatism. Of Eisenhower, McCarthyism, the Korean War, and suburban sprawl. This was the first decade that the television became a full force in the market. The film studios felt they needed to compete to bring people to the theater with sprawling epics complete with overtures and intermissions, the advent of 3D, and adapting Broadway musicals to the screen. It ultimately paid off.\n\nThis was the decade of Marilyn Monroe, the first Disney live action films, and the last gasps of Charlie Chaplin and Universal Studios monsters. Speaking of monsters the horror and sci-fi genres were heavily inundated with post-nuclear war monster movies and alien invasions. This decade saw the rise of Billy Wilder, Stanley Kubrick, and Sydney Lumet. Foreign films exploded in the ‘50s after the U.S. release of Akira Kurosawa’s Rashomon with other examples of Japanese cinema, the French New Wave, and Italian Neo-Realism. Film was expanding its view and range for audiences. It was both dazzling spectacle and challenging political and social commentary. It just depended on the week.\n\nI’ve seen over 120 films from the 1950s, a bit of a leap from the 70+ I’ve seen from the ‘40s. I wish I was able to squeeze in Niagara, Carmen Jones, La Strada and The Spirit of St. Louis. That said, below are my 50 favorites. I hope it serves as a guide for those who have some catching up to do and need some direction. For others it’ll be an enjoyable read to look out for their favorites.\n\nNOTE: If you’re using a phone to read this article turn it to landscape view to read the article as it was intended.\n\nSo, those are my favorite movies of the 1950s. Every year of the decade is represented. The year 1954 made the list the most with 9 films. The years 1950 and 1955 came in 2nd with 6 films each. The only unique thing I can point to about those years are the collection of Japanese films that came from them. But that’s only 4 of the 21 films; there were also great films by Billy Wilder, Joseph Mankiewicz, and Alfred Hitchcock those years. Director Alfred Hitchcock has the most entries on this list with 4 films. Thanks to her bit part in All About Eve, Marilyn Monroe made the list more than any other actor or actress with 4 films. Along with Monroe James Stewart, Elizabeth Taylor, Grace Kelly, Takashi Shimura, William Holden, and James Mason make up my favorite actors of the decade with three films each on the list.\n\nAgain, the best resources for films from this decade are Amazon Prime and HBO Max. You can also rent many films on Amazon. I hope you find some new favorites. What are some of your favorites from the decade already? Feel free to share."
