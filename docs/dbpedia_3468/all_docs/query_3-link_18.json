        "text": "by Sam Juliano\n\nHe is in my carefully considered opinion the greatest versatile genius the cinema has ever produced, and on a list of my favorites may well rank as my top choice, (depending on what day of the week I am asked the question. Ingmar Bergman is the one who seems to alternate with him, but both Yasujiro Ozu and Robert Bresson and even Carl Dreyer are with them at the pinnacle) No film artist has engaged me as thoroughly, no comic has made me laugh as much, no humanist has brought more tears, no technical genius -not even Keaton- has caused me to marvel just how much acrobatic brilliance can come from a single person. He was the consumate genius, writing and directing his films, serving as the main star, and to boot, writing his own music, some of which includes some of the finest compositions of the century. Michael Jackson’s favorite ‘song’ of all time is “Smile” from Modern Times, and the overwhelming poignancy of the music he wrote for the final flower girl scene in City Lights (his greatest film across the board) is the perfect embodiment of theme expressed in music. His physical agility, his astute understanding of the human condition, and his uncanny sense of timing all are part of this Shakespeare of film, the single man who set the standard that has not subsequently been equalled. If by now the name of Charles Spencer Chaplin has not been figured, well then the reader is from another planet.\n\nChaplin is the subject of some of the best biographies, and the documentary Unknown Chaplin is one of the greatest appraisals of a single director ever produced. No American film artist has equalled the stature and adoration he has enjoyed abroad, and none match the sheer passion his visage has engendered. City Lights is my personal favorite film of all-time, and the single one that would accompany me to a desert island if I were limited to just a single choice. Chaplin wrote his own autobiography and has been toasted worldwide by kings and presidents, some of the greatest literary figures, and his life has been the subject of more sustained interest for both the layman and the scholar, the upper and the lower classes and a wide range of admirers ranging from young kids to the elderly. His influence was enormous, his personality infectious, and his success complete on every level. He was lauded for his business sense and known for his frugality, and his canon continues today to exert an enormous influence on new filmmakers and those who value the film as an art form. His personal life was a fishbowl even after the move to Switzerland; his marriage to Oona O’Neill -the daughter of American playwright Eugene O’Neill- despite their 36 year age difference caused a near scandal and cost Oona any further relations with her father, and the subsequent communist witch hunts eventually forced Chaplin to move to Europe.\n\nManhattan’s movie mecca, the Film Forum on Houston Street ran as comprehensive a festival on Chaplin’s work as could be conjured up over three weeks. The first week featured an exclusive run of 1925’s The Circus, while the remaining two weeks offered up every feature film Chaplin ever produced with the understandable exception of A Countess from Hong Kong, which many consider a complete abomination. (I think it is better than that, but perhaps not a wise choice for this collection) Of the shorts, every significant title appeared in the festival, and the five most widely praised of the Mutuals were offered up as a single feature. Only the beginning Essanays were excluded, but this lot, produced in the early teens doesn’t really belong with the mature work that follows. Save for a few other Mutuals (like One A.M.) that could have further enriched the final cut, the festival was as complete as one could possibly have hoped for, and the double-feature groupings were inspired. On the evening of Monday, August 2nd, Steve Sterner provided live piano accompaniment for the screening of the four mutual shorts, The Cure, The Adventurer, The Immigrant and Easy Street. Virtually all 35 milemeter prints used for the festival were beautiful, but this is hardly surprising when one considers the excellent care that Chaplin employed in keeping all his holdings in pristine condition over the decades. (in marked contrast to the film of Japanese master Yasujiro Ozu, whose films were heavily damaged due to neglect.) Much like the Anthony Mann Festival that preceeded it, the Chaplin retrospective attracted sell-out or near sell-out audiences for many of its shows.\n\nI have decided to forego the technical aspects of Chaplin’s work, which by and large are known by most cineastes and film lovers, and instead offer capsules on the twenty (20) features and short films that I saw at this festival. Luck and fortitude enabled me to see the entire program, as I had done with the Anthony Mann venue, and I was thrilled that my wife and kids came along for the ride most of the time. My lifelong friend Tony Lucibello came along for Monsieur Verdoux, and I was alone only for Limelight, which somehow seems appropriate.\n\nVodpod videos no longer available.\n\nThe Complete Schedule Of Charlie Chaplin’s Films That Sam Juliano, Viewed at “The Film Forum” in New York.\n\nThe Circus A restored print was the lynchpin to launch the festival and this 1925 gem, produced at a “down” time in Chaplin’s personal and professional life, was given a full one-week run. So many sequences are unforgettable including the one where Chaplin impersonates a figure in front of the fun house, his tightrope act, during which the safety device breaks and he is attacked by three escaped monkeys, the chase through the hall of mirrors, the various circus acts where the Tramp is always wildly applauded whenever he isn’t trying to be funny and vice-versa, his imitation of traditional clown acts, and his being trapped in the lion’s cage. The ending is underlined by sadness, and was further proof of Chaplin’s ability to peel off the comic gauze and find the underlying humanity that he probed further in The Gold Rush, City Lights and Modern Times. The Circus is one of Chaplin’s four great masterpieces in my view. The ‘rainbow’ song over the credits is another musical treasure from this multi-talented genius.*****\n\nCity Lights Known as “a comedy romance in pantomine” the film is actually a bittersweet tragedy, and Chaplin’s genius knew it would only work the way it if it stayed a silent at a time when talkies had taken control of Hollywood for several years. It’s Chaplin’s greatest masterpiece, and it’s final scene with the Tramp smiling, and holding a flower near his mouth is one of the truly great moments in the entire history of the cinema, and one that brings tears as decisively as any film in any genre, from any country. It also features a rapurous operatic score that explodes in the end with the aural underpinnings that lifts this film into an emotional epiphany. Many of the earlier sequences at a park dedication, in a boxing ring, the scenes with the drunken millionaire who only knows him when he’s drunk, and a sequence when the Tramp swallows a whistle are as funny as anything Chaplin ever wrote, but it’s the humanism that elevates this. The film is told in the spare style of the classics, and is the result of what was purportedly Chaplin’s most painstaking work ever. The difficulty he had with the flower girl Virginia Cherill (who was nearly fired) is now legendary. *****\n\nThe Gold Rush Chaplin has been known to have said on record that if this were the one film he was to be remembered by, it would be fine by him. More than any other of his film’s this one has a psychological depth and richness, and tragedy that is incorporated into comedy. It has the scope of a great novel, and Chaplin delivers in it what many consider to be his greatest performance as an actor, using his brows and shoulders in a way that eclipses what some actors convey with their eyes and lips. A number of the famous sequences in the film rank among the greatest of all Chaplin moments (and for that matter in all of screen comedy), and they include the dance with the dinner rolls, the eating of the shoe and the laces (daintily) as if they were spaghetti, the scenes where Big Jim sees Charlie as a chicken, and the darker scenes with Black Larsen. The dance hall sequence near the end is also unforgettable. The setting in the snow, and the house swaying on the cliff are indellible Chaplin settings, and the film is probably his most popular. *****\n\nModern Times One critic opined that Modern Times was the equivalent of Disney meeting Fritz Lang. Chaplin himself credit Rene Clair for some ideas from one of the French master’s best films. In any case, many consider this to be Chaplin’s most brilliant film, and it’s hard to dispute that estimation. The conveyor belt sequence, the food-tasting machine gig, the high society party where Chaplin spews gibberish, and the achingly poignant scenes with Paulette Godard as the waif are ingrained in the mind as is the spirit of the song “Smile” presented here for the first time in instrumental form. (but no less lyrical and tremendously moving) The film shows Chaplin at the peak of his powers, and in theme and presentation it’s the most auspicious and sophisticated statement he’s ever made. Again, Chaplin refused to conform with the talking medium (though some gibberish, sound effects and music are in place) and again his decision resulted in a huge commercial and artistic success. *****\n\nThe Great Dictator Many have derided the film’s final scene,where Chaplin goes on his political soapbox, but at the time his heart was in the right place, even with the overbearing execution. I liked this film more than I ever did after the screening I saw here at the festival on a Sunday afternoon, but I still found it less than the four masterworks (since joined by The Kid and Limelight.) in large measure because the famous scene with Charlie and the “globe” is just not funny. I can well understand the situation in the world at that time diminishing many of the comedic possibilities, but even the attempts at satire and wordplay could have been widened. It’s a good film, but the one of his films that has enjoyed an undeserved repuation over the years. It does contain, however, one of Chaplin’s greatest performances. ****\n\nA Woman in Paris Set in a small French village with Edna Purviance aboard, this is one film where Chaplin never appears on-screen, and serves solely as writer-director. It’s a masterful piece with the depth of a novel and a largely serious and tragic tone. Chaplin composed one of his exceedingly beautiful scores, and the cinematography and art direction are exqusite. ****½\n\nLimelight There is a Shakespearean grandeur in this elegiac story of an aging clown and a young ballerina who professes undying love, and that one great moments of triumph that brings down the house, while the Grim reaper waits in the wings. There is wisdom and deep humanity, and some great dialogue on the fleeting aspects in life, and having Buster Keaton aboard-if only for a few short scenes- seems to enhance the film’s central theme. Clair Bloom gives an outstanding and moving performance and Chaplin is every bit as persuasive as he was in Monsieur Verdoux. And a great song, “Eternally” also plays into the theme powerfully. *****\n\nMonsieur Verdoux Chaplin plays a man who has killed off a number of woman a la Bluebeard for their money in this pointed pacifist satire aimed at those who support their nations going to war and killing innocents, which condemning domestic incidents of murder. Some unforgettable gags (one in a greenhouse is an all-time classic) and the final scene in a courthouse is extremely affecting. The most unforgettable money-counting and rose pruning are included in this defining example of black comedy, with a similarity to the British film Kind Hearts and Coronets, made a few years later. ****½\n\nThe Kid With Limelight, this is the second film of this festival that made me re-think my original position and elevate my estimation of it to the top level. There is a naturalism, a poignancy (and that great surrealist sequence near the end) and one of Rollie Totheroh’s most exquisite turns as director of photography for Chaplin, and the great work by young Jackie Coogan. It’s certainly the most Dickinsinian of all Chaplin’s films, even with a number set in the ghettos. But it’s irresistible. *****\n\nA King in New York Made during the period where Chaplin had moved from America, this is an autobiographical satire aimed at American consumerism and political oppressions. Many scenes do resonate, like the movie house with its absurd films, the rock n roll nightclub , Hamlet’s soliloquy, the society party and the commercial interruptions. The film has its moments, but by this time Chaplin was artistically receding. ***½\n\nA Day’s Pleasure Probably the weakest of the Chaplin shorts. Some effective pantomine and burlesque, but a standard narrative line with a central idea that never takes off. ***\n\nShoulder Arms Brilliant satire on army life with Chaplin as an incompetent private in the trenches during World War I. A charismatic combination of slapstick, pathos and irony filmed in 1918 when the war was still in progress, and, until The Gold Rush in 1925, the movie considered by most critics to be Chaplin’s masterwork. The unquestionable highlight is Charlie disguised as a tree trying to delude the enemy. *****\n\nA Dog’s Life Bittersweet comedy in which a desparate begger – Chaplin – teams up with a mongrel dog called Scraps and becomes involved with crooks and stolen money. Some brilliantly timed comedy, but distinguished mainly by its pathos and realistic emphasis on the little tramp’s desparate struggle for survival. The film was Chaplin’s first acknowledged masterpiece, and it again featured Chaplin female lead Edna Purviance. This one was a special treat to see on the big screen. *****\n\nThe Pilgrim Chaplin is featured as an escaped convict masquerading as a minister in a small Western town. Relatively less famed than some of the films it is coupled with, it does contain several bright moments and some gentle satire of American rural types and small-town puritanism. This turned out to be the last of 34 films that Purviance worked with Chaplin, but all in all its underrated. ****\n\nThe Immigrant Chaplin’s penultimate Mutual comedy (my own favorite, Mutual, actually) with Charlie and fellow immigrant Purviance sharing hardship and happiness as they make a new life together in America. Admittedly a slower pace than the other short comedies, but containing some acute observations of the difficulties and loneliness experienced by outsiders in a foreign country. Almost the entire last half of the film revolves around a single comic incident – Chaplin and waiter Eric Campbell continually finding and losing a coin in a restaurant. *****\n\nEasy Street The most famous of Chaplin’s films for Mutual finds Charlie in the role of a reformed derelict who becomes a policeman and cleans up a tough city street. Very funny although like The Vagabond containing several moments of genuine pathos and emphasizing the struggle for life in the slum areas of a big city. Most memorable sequence: Charlie overcoming head bullyEric Campbell by pushing his head through the top of a street gas lamp. Edna Purviance and Henry Bergman are on board. **** 1/2\n\nThe Cure Boisterous Mutual that has Charlie always clad in light coat and straw hat, who becomes involved in a series of slapstick adventures at a spa. Several memorable scenes, including those in which Charlie suffers on a masseur’s table and Eric Campbell’s foot gets caught in a revolving door. For me it’s the least of the four Mutuals shown here, but it’s still quite good. ****\n\nThe Adventurer Chaplin plays an escaped convict on the run from the police in his last Mutual film and a return to the slapstick form that made him famous. The best scenes are when Charlie is being chased around cliff paths and across beaches, emerging from the sand and looking straight into the barrel of a guard’s rifle, and dropping ice cream down a woman’s back. Great stuff, and a favorite of my two oldest boys. *****\n\nPay Day In this short, Charlie plays a laborer on a building site, who arrives for work late, admirers the pretty daughter (Purviance) of the foreman, Swain, and tries to hide his pay from his enormous, shrewish wife. He takes the money from her bag, has a night out with the boys, and returning home just as the alarm clock rings, pretends he is getting up. Finally his wife drives him off with a rolling pin. Pretty much an expertly paces, hysterical short. ****½\n\nThe Idle Class Mistaken identity at a golf club is the central premise, here where Charlie playa poor drunk, but gets involved in some very well timed gags at a country club. ****"
