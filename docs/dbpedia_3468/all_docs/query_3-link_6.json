        "text": "(A Work in Progress)\n\nby Phil Posner\n\nESSANAY MUTUAL FIRST NATIONAL UNITED ARTISTS\n\nK E Y S T O N E 1914\n\nMaking a Living\n\nOne Reel\n\n(N.B.: all subsequent Keystones are one reel unless otherwise noted).\n\nNotable as Charles Chaplin's first film, Making a Living is a standard\n\nKeystone farce. Chaplin plays a ne'er-do-well con man sporting a top hat,\n\nfrock coat, monocle and a walrus moustache. He first encounters his rival\n\nHenry Lehrman (who also directed) on the street, where Chaplin begs a\n\nloan. Chaplin then encounters a mother and daughter outside their home\n\nand proposes to the daughter. Lehrman arrives, also enamoured of the\n\ndaughter, exposes Chaplin as a bum, and engages him in a fight which is\n\nstopped by the ladies' butler.\n\nLehrman arrives at the newspaper office at which he works. Passing the\n\noffice building, Chaplin sees a sign advertising \"Reporters Wanted\". He\n\ngoes in to apply, but again is exposed as a bum by Lehrman.\n\nWhile on his rounds Lehrman witnesses a horrific auto accident and takes\n\npictures and interviews the victim before help arrives. Chaplin happens\n\nupon the accident and steals Lehrman's camera and notebook and runs at top\n\nspeed to file the story. In pursuit, Lehrman gets tangled up with a married\n\ncouple, in whose flat Chaplin tries to hide. He arrives at the office too\n\nlate, as Chaplin has already filed the story and has even helped to load up\n\nthe delivery truck and newsboys with papers.\n\nLehrman catches up to Chaplin and a fight ensues which ends with both\n\nof them caught up in the cow catcher of an oncoming streetcar.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Swindler\n\nHenry Lehrman - Reporter\n\nChester Conklin - Policeman/Bum\n\nAlice Davenport - Mother\n\nVirginia Kirtley - Daughter\n\nProduction Team\n\nHenry Lehrman - Director\n\nE.J. Vallejo - Cinematographer\n\nMack Sennett- Producer\n\nMack Sennett - The Boss at Keystone Studios\n\nVirginia Kirtley\n\nKid's Auto Race\n\n(a.k.a. Kid's Auto Races at Venice, Ca.)\n\nSplit Reel\n\nAn impromptu film, shot at a soap box derby at Venice Beach, California on\n\nJanuary 10, 1914, Kid's Auto Race is notable as the first released film\n\nfeaturing Charlie Chaplin's beloved Tramp character. Keystone Studios\n\nchief Mack Sennett often sent film crews to public events to improvise a\n\nfilm with the event as a backdrop. The intertitle that introduces the Tramp\n\ncharacter accurately describes the film's plot: \"In picturing this event an\n\nodd character discovered that motion pictures were being taken and it\n\nbecame impossible to keep him away from the camera\". In this half-reel,\n\nfilm-within-a-film, the Tramp continuously gets in the way of the camera\n\nand the soap-box cars, and is constantly being shooed, cajoled and shoved\n\nout of the way by the director, Henry Lehrman. Just as interesting as the\n\nantics of the Little Tramp, are the fascinated reactions of the kids on the\n\nsidelines. They were there to watch the race, but unknowingly got a preview\n\nof the comedy character who was to become known and loved throughout the\n\nworld.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Tramp\n\nHenry Lehrman - Film Director\n\nFrank D. Williams & Hans Koenekamp - Cameramen\n\nMabel's Strange Predicament\n\nIn this Keystone hotel farce starring Mabel Normand, Charles Chaplin\n\nfirst donned his Tramp costume. It was shot largely before Kid's Auto\n\nRaces, the first released film with the Tramp, but released a week later.\n\nChaplin plays not a penniless Tramp, but a drunk and a masher who staggers\n\naround a hotel lobby trying to ingratiate himself to all the women. He\n\nflirts with Mabel, a guest in the hotel who is concealing her dog in her\n\nroom, but she rejects him. Later, while playing with the dog, Mabel\n\naccidentally gets locked out of her room, wearing only her pajamas. Charlie\n\nstumbles upstairs and again flirts with her, but she escapes into the room\n\nof a quarrelling couple (Chester Conklin, Alice Davenport) across the\n\nhall. She is discovered hiding there by her jealous suitor (Harry McCoy)\n\nand a fight ensues involving the suitor, the couple and Charlie. It ends\n\nwith Mabel and her boyfriend kissing and making up, the fighting couple\n\nstill locked in battle and Charlie heading down the hallway presumably to\n\nreturn to his bottle and his chair in the lobby.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Inebriate\n\nMabel Normand - Mabel\n\nHarry Mc Coy - Boyfriend\n\nChester Conklin - Husband\n\nAlice Davenport - Wife\n\nAl St. John - Bellboy\n\nBilly Gilbert - Bellboy\n\nBilly Hauber - Hotel Guest\n\nSadie Lampe - Hotel Guest\n\nNB: The Billy Gilbert in this and other Keystones is not the more\n\nfamous actor of the same name who appeared in Chaplin's \"The Great\n\nDictator\".\n\nBilly Gilbert (from His Musical Career)\n\nBilly Hauber\n\nA Thief Catcher\n\nEdgar Kennedy, Mack Swain, Chaplin and an unidentified actor\n\nA recent discovery as a previously unknown appearance, A Thief Catcher is\n\nactually a Ford Sterling film, with Chaplin appearing briefly as a Keystone Kop.\n\nFilm historian and preservationist Paul Gierucki found a 16mm print of it by\n\nchance in 2010 at an antiques show in Michigan. After consultations with\n\nother silent film experts, Chaplin was recognized in the film. A Thief Catcher\n\nwas released on February 19, 1914, nine days before Between Showers. It\n\nco-stars Mack Swain and Edgar Kennedy as burglars whom Sheriff Sterling is\n\npursuing. Chaplin appears as one of two cops who rescue Sterling from\n\ncaptivity by the yeggmen.\n\nBetween Showers\n\nIn his fourth film for Keystone, Charlie Chaplin was assigned for the\n\nlast time to Henry Lehrman, his first director at Keystone. It was\n\nChaplin's first film with the ostensible star of the film, Ford Sterling,\n\nwho had announced that he would be leaving Keystone for a more lucrative\n\ndeal well before Chaplin joined Keystone. Between Showers is the first\n\nChaplin film shot partially at Echo Park. It shows a few developments\n\nof his Tramp character, mostly little bits of \"business\" that would recur\n\nin later films. Sterling plays a womanizer who steals an umbrella from a\n\ncop and his girlfriend. He encounters a pretty girl, Emma Clifton, on a\n\nstreet corner who is impeded from crossing the street by a huge puddle.\n\nFord gives his new umbrella to the girl to hold and goes off to find a\n\npiece of lumber for a makeshift bridge. Charlie, dressed as the Tramp but\n\nwithout the cane, saunters on the scene and also offers his help. While\n\nthey're gone, another cop carries the girl over the puddle. Sterling\n\nreturns and when he asks for his umbrella back, the girl refuses. Sterling\n\nattacks her and Charlie comes to her rescue, although she seems capable of\n\nhandling both men. A fight sequence through the park ensues, after which\n\nCharlie restores the umbrella to Emma. It climaxes when Chester the cop,\n\nsummoned by Ford, recognizes the umbrella as his own. Charlie admits to\n\ntaking it from Ford, but Ford has no alibi and an amused Charlie watches\n\nChester haul him off to jail.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - A Masher\n\nFord Sterling - A Rival Masher\n\nEmma Clifton - Lady in Distress\n\nChester Conklin - Cop\n\nSadie Lampe - His Girlfriend\n\nSadie Lampe and Chester Conklin\n\nProduction Team\n\nHenry Lehrman - Director\n\nReed Heustis - Scenario\n\nMack Sennett/Keystone Film Company - Producer\n\nN.B.: David Robinson (from Mitry) credits Sadie Lampe as Conklin's\n\ngirlfriend in Between Showers, Although I can't confirm this, if this\n\nis correct then a number of roles can be credited to her, most notably\n\nthe Hat Check Girl in Tango Tangles. Therefore I am identifying all\n\nappearances of this actress with that name.\n\nA Film Johnnie\n\nIn Charlie Chaplin's fifth Keystone comedy we get a look inside the\n\nfamous laugh factory. Charlie is a movie fan and we first see him creating\n\nhavoc at a theatre where he gets too involved with the action on the screen\n\nand the beautiful actress in the film. Ejected from the theatre, he\n\nproceeds to Keystone itself where he mooches money from Roscoe Arbuckle as\n\nhe arrives at work. Charlie sneaks into the studio and disrupts the\n\nfilming, much to the chagrin of the director. He mistakes a scene where the\n\nstarlet is being manhandled for reality and comes to her rescue. Firing a\n\nprop pistol in all directions, he clears the stages before leaving.\n\nMeanwhile, a Keystone scout sees a building on fire in a nearby street and\n\ntelephones the studio. In a parody of Mack Sennett's propensity to use\n\npublic events and disasters as backdrops for his films, the cast and crew\n\nrush off to do some location filming at the fire. Charlie shows up and\n\nagain disrupts the filming, causing the director to take after him\n\nbrandishing a club. The firemen arrive and seeing the struggle between the\n\ndirector and his assistants who are trying to restrain him, turn the hoses\n\non the fighting men. Charlie again tries his luck with the beautiful\n\nactress and receives a good shaking in response, followed by a soaking by\n\nthe fire squad. In a classic Chaplin move, he twists his ear as water\n\nsquirts from his mouth. When the beautiful actress laughs at his condition,\n\na waterlogged Charlie gives up on his movie fanaticism.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - The Film Johnnie\n\nEdgar Kennedy - Director\n\nFord Sterling - Himself\n\nRoscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle - Himself\n\nHenry Lehrman - Himself\n\nPeggy Pearce - Keystone Actress\n\nMinta Durfee - Actress/Woman in Audience\n\nHank Mann - Prop Boy\n\nHarry McCoy - Fireman and Audience Member\n\nFrank Opperman - Audience Member with handlebar mustache\n\nBilly Gilbert - Usher\n\nBilly Hauber - Audience Member\n\nSadie Lampe - Audience Member\n\nGrover Ligon - Audience Member\n\nGeorge Nichols - Actor in Film\n\nN.B. : Previous filmographies credit Mack Sennett in the role\n\nof the director. A closer look reveals that the part is played\n\nby Edgar Kennedy.\n\nProduction Team\n\nGeorge Nichols - Director\n\nCraig Hutchinson - Scenario\n\nTango Tangles\n\nTango Tangles is an impromptu Keystone comedy which exploited the current\n\n\"tango craze\". A tango contest and exhibition prompted Mack Sennett) to\n\nsend a crew out to a local dance hall where some of the film was shot.\n\nCharlie Chaplin appears in a tuxedo, sans the famous Tramp makeup and\n\ncostume, as a drunk who flirts with the hat check girl, Sadie Lampe, and\n\ngets into fights with Ford Sterling and Roscoe Arbuckle, both musicians\n\nat the dance hall who are also enamoured with her. Although slight in plot,\n\nthe film is interesting because the three principal Keystone actors appear\n\nwithout comic makeup, and because we can observe the mirthful reactions of\n\nthe real dancers in the hall to the comic fight between Chaplin and\n\nSterling. Also of interest is the blending of location and studio footage,\n\nnoticeable due to differences in lighting and set.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Tipsy Dancer\n\nRoscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle - Musician\n\nFord Sterling - Band Leader\n\nSadie Lampe - Hat Check Girl\n\nEdgar Kennedy - Dance Hall Manager\n\nChester Conklin - Guest in Police Costume\n\nMinta Durfee - Dancer\n\nBilly Hauber - Flautist\n\nGlen Cavender - Drummer, Guest in Cone Hat\n\nAlice Davenport - Guest\n\nAl St. John - Guest in Convict Costume\n\nFrank Opperman - Clarinettist, Guest\n\nBilly Gilbert - Guest in Cowboy Hat\n\nDave Morris - Dance Organizer\n\nHank Mann - Guest in Overalls\n\nN.B.: The role of the Hat Check Girl is often credited to Minta Durfee,\n\nbut this is in error (see note on Sadie Lampe above). Durfee appears as\n\none of the guests in the dance hall.\n\nHis Favorite Pastime\n\nIn Charles Chaplin's seventh film for the Keystone Company, the Little\n\nFellow's favorite pastime is drinking and chasing women. The film opens in\n\na saloon where Charlie is partaking of a free lunch and teasing a down-on-\n\nhis-luck Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle who is trying to bum a drink. We see an\n\nearly Chaplin \"transposition\" gag when Charlie tries to light a sausage,\n\nthinking it's a cigar. After leaving the bar, Charlie accosts beautiful but\n\nmarried Peggy Pierce (with whom Chaplin was involved romantically at the\n\ntime) as she and her maid wait for her husband to return to their taxi.\n\nAfter being shooed away by the husband, he returns to the saloon and gets\n\ninto fights with various patrons. In the men's washroom he hands a towel,\n\nwith which he's polished his shoes to a man who has soap in his eyes,\n\ncausing him to blacken his face. Exiting the bar again, he follows the\n\nmaid's taxi home and gets into a melee with the maid, the lady herself and\n\nher irate husband, who, with the aid of his household servants, ejects\n\nCharlie from their home.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Tramp\n\nRoscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle - Drunk\n\nPeggy Pearce - Beautiful Lady\n\nEdgar Kennedy - Bullying Patron at Bar\n\nHarry McCoy - Patron at Bar\n\nPeggy Page- Member of Household\n\nBilly Gilbert - Shoeshine Boy\n\nBilly Hauber - Shoeshine Customer\n\nwith Peggy Page in \"Laughing Gas\"\n\nN.B.: The petite but buxom young actress who debuts in a very minor\n\nrole in this film went on to perform roles in half of Chaplin's Keystones.\n\nPlaying key parts such as the pretty patient in \"Laughing Gas\", Garlico's\n\nassistant in \"The Property Man\", the love interests in \"Recreation\" and\n\n\"His New Profession\", Clarice the secretary in \"The New Janitor\" and the\n\nlandlady in \"Those Love Pangs\", until now has never been properly credited.\n\nShe is often mistakenly cited as Minta Durfee, Norma Nichols or Rhea Mitchell.\n\nIn her last Chaplin/Keystone appearance as one of King Lowbrow's cave girl\n\nwives in \"His Prehistoric Past\", she is assumed by some to be the actress\n\ncredited as Gene Marsh, but I am informed by Bo Berglund that Marsh\n\nactually plays the first wife with whom Chaplin interacts and that Marsh\n\nwent on to co-star with Harold Lloyd in some of his 1915-1916 comedies.\n\nUntil now I referred to her in this listing as Helen Carruthers, but now,\n\nthanks to articles found by friend and researcher Steve Rydsewski,\n\nI have reason to identify her as Peggy Page. However I consider it a\n\npossibility that Peggy Page might have been the stage name of Helen\n\nCarruthers, due to her resemblance to an unclear photograph of Carruthers\n\nin a newspaper article from the Oregonian newspaper from 1915. The\n\narticle describes her as a Chaplin co-star at Keystone and tells of a suicide\n\nattempt and recovery.\n\nCruel, Cruel Love\n\nIn his eighth film for Keystone Charlie Chaplin, in frock coat and bushy\n\nmustache, is cast in the role of a melodramatic lover who attempts suicide\n\nover his lost love. The film is a farce, a parody of the overacted\n\nmelodramas of the day. Mr. Dovey (Chaplin) is first seen in the drawing\n\nroom of his lady, Minta Durfee, on his knees proposing. The couple are\n\noverheard and mocked by the lady's maid, whose laughter causes Minta to\n\neject her from the house. To get back at her boss, she arranges a hoax with\n\nthe gardener. She feigns injury and her cries bring the departing Dovey to\n\nher aid. When Minta sees her maid flirting with Dovey, she rejects him in a\n\njealous rage. Back at home the despondent Dovey drinks what he thinks is\n\npoison; only his highly amused butler knows it was just water. Waiting for\n\nthe poison to take effect, Dovey has horrifying visions of his eternal\n\ndamnation. Meanwhile, Minta has learned of her maid's deception and has\n\nsent the gardener to Dovey with a letter of apology. \"It's too late. I've\n\nbeen poisoned,\" says Dovey and the gardener goes back to retrieve Minta to\n\nbe at her dying man's side. Dovey now summons doctors to save him,\n\ndrinking all the milk he can with evident distaste. When the physicians\n\narrive the butler lets them in on the joke and they play along too,\n\njokingly examining him. Minta, having raced to her man's home, learns of\n\nthe hoax and tells Dovey he's going to live. First relieved, then enraged,\n\nhe attacks all the pranksters and finally embraces his lady, removing from\n\nhis fingers a ball of hair he had pulled from his head and blowing it away.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Lord Helpus/Mr. Dovey\n\nMinta Durfee - The Lady\n\nEdgar Kennedy - Lord Helpus' Butler\n\nBilly Hauber - Gardener\n\nGlen Cavender - Doctor\n\nBilly Gilbert - Ambulance Attendant\n\nEva Nelson - Maid\n\nNB: Previous Chaplin filmographies list Chester Conklin and Alice Davenport\n\nin the roles of Chaplin's butler and Durfee's maid respectively, but\n\nviewing the film clearly reveals this to be in error. The actress playing\n\nthe maid has been identified by Bo Berglund as Eva Nelson, who also played\n\nConklin's girl in \"Twenty Minutes of Love\" and Mack Swain's wife in\n\n\"Mabel's Married Life\".\n\nProduction Team\n\nMack Sennett - Director\n\nCraig Hutchinson - Screenplay\n\nMack Sennett/Keystone Film Company - Producer\n\nThe Star Boarder\n\nIn Charlie Chaplin's ninth Keystone comedy Charlie is the star boarder in\n\nMinta Durfee's rooming house. We first see his Tramp's shoes as he lies\n\nin bed, a shot probably inserted to draw applause, a sign that the\n\ncharacter was gaining popularity. He gets preferential treatment at the\n\ndinner table, much to the chagrin of the landlady's husband. After lunch\n\nMinta and Charlie go out to play tennis. Charlie, taking a left handed\n\nbaseball swing, sends the ball into the bushes. They go together to look\n\nfor the ball and begin to flirt. Minta's son mischievously takes their\n\npicture with a box camera as Minta straightens Charlie's tie. Edgar has\n\nfollowed them and found the ball. His arrival breaks up the flirtation in a\n\nflurry of ball-searching. Edgar then goes off and encounters one of the\n\nfemale boarders Alice Davenport, who accidentally hits her head and\n\ncollapses into Edgar's arms. This too is photographed by the boy. Later\n\nthe boy sets up his slide projector and gets a boarder to hang a sheet for\n\na screen. With everyone in attendance the slide show proceeds until the\n\nphoto of Alice and Edgar brings scowls from Minta and laughter from\n\nCharlie. However the next slides of Charlie and Minta infuriate Edgar who\n\nattacks Charlie, and a general melee ensues during which the boy gets a\n\nspanking from his mother while Charlie finally bests Edgar.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - The Star Boarder\n\nMinta Durfee - Landlady\n\nEdgar Kennedy - Landlady's Husband\n\nGordon Griffith - Their Son\n\nAlice Davenport - Landlady's Friend\n\nPhyllis Allen - Boarder\n\nBilly Gilbert - Boarder\n\nHarry McCoy - Piano Playing Boarder\n\nAl St. John - Boarder\n\nProduction Team\n\nGeorge Nichols or Mack Sennett - Director\n\nCraig Hutchinson - Scenario\n\nMabel At The Wheel\n\nTwo reels\n\nMabel Normand wrote, directed and starred in Charlie Chaplin's tenth\n\nfilm for Keystone. After disagreements with the directors of his previous\n\nfilms, Sennett assigned him to Normand, but Chaplin was chomping at the bit\n\nto direct his own films and, for this film at least, the Chaplin/Normand\n\nrelationship was not any better. It is another Keystone that takes\n\nadvantage of a public event, an auto race, for background. Chaplin plays\n\nthe motorcycle riding villain of the film, dressed in frock coat and top\n\nhat (similar to his costume in his first film, Making a Living). Mabel's\n\nboyfriend, Harry McCoy, is a race car driver who comes to Mabel's house\n\nto take her to the racetrack, but they argue because Harry won't let Mabel\n\ndrive. Charlie comes along on his bike and offers Mabel a ride, which she\n\naccepts to make Harry jealous. When the cycle hits a bump, Mabel is thrown\n\noff and lands in a puddle, unnoticed by Charlie who goes on talking. Harry\n\ncomes to her aid, they reconcile and he lets her drive the race car.\n\nCharlie, having noticed Mabel's absence, finds them together and tries to\n\nwin her back, but is rejected. He decides to ruin Harry's chances of\n\nwinning the race, beginning with puncturing one of the tires on his car.\n\nLater Charlie and his henchmen kidnap Harry and tie him up in a shed,\n\nforcing Mabel to drive in the race. Determined to stop Mabel from winning,\n\nCharlie and his men soak the track with water and throw bombs at the car,\n\nbut Mabel's driving skills prevail and she wins the race, much to the\n\nchagrin of Charlie who, in a fit of rage, blows himself and his henchmen up\n\nwith their last remaining bomb.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - The Villain\n\nMabel Normand - Mabel\n\nChester Conklin - Mabel's Father\n\nMack Sennett - Rube/Newsman\n\nHarry McCoy - Mabel's Boyfriend\n\nEdgar Kennedy - Man in Grandstand\n\nMack Swain - Man at Races\n\nBilly Hauber - Mabel's co-driver\n\nAlice Davenport - Woman in Grandstand\n\nProduction Team\n\nMabel Normand/Mack Sennett - Director, Scenario\n\nTwenty Minutes of Love\n\nCharlie Chaplin once said, \"All I need to make a comedy is a park, a\n\npoliceman and a pretty girl\". In this, his eleventh film for Keystone and\n\narguably his first original screenplay, his milieu is just that - Echo\n\nPark, where most of the Keystone park films were shot. The Tramp makes fun of a\n\nromantic couple (Minta Durfee, Edgar Kennedy) kissing on a bench.\n\nHe hugs and kisses a tree in mock romantic ardor, then goes over to pester\n\nthem and insinuate himself with the girl. Meanwhile another couple on\n\nanother park bench (Chester Conklin, Eva Nelson) argue because he\n\nhas no ring to give her nor the funds to buy one. He goes off and steals a\n\npocket watch from a sleeping man. His girlfriend has meanwhile wandered off\n\nand encountered Charlie, with whom she flirts. The Little Fellow pursues\n\nher but encounters Conklin who is looking for his girl. Charlie steals the\n\nwatch. He next meets a cop who gives him a scare by asking to see the\n\nwatch, but only wants to know the time. Charlie gasps for breath, pats his\n\nheart and wipes his brow after the cop departs. Chester finds his\n\ngirlfriend back on the same bench, but when he looks for the watch he finds\n\nthat it's gone. He goes off again to look for it. Charlie finally catches\n\nup with Chester's girl and gives her the watch, for which he receives a few\n\nkisses, then declares his love for her. Chester returns to find Charlie\n\nromancing his girl and accuses him of stealing the watch which Charlie\n\nagain steals and flees. As he turns a corner he sees the cop, raises his\n\nright leg and skids to a stop (the first time this famous gag was seen in a\n\nChaplin film). The couple get the cop to join in the chase, which ends\n\nwith everyone being thrown into the lake with the exception of Charlie, his\n\nnew girlfriend and the watch.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Tramp\n\nChester Conklin - Pickpocket\n\nEva Nelson - Chester's Girl\n\nEva Nelson in \"Twenty Minutes of Love\"\n\nMinta Durfee - Edgar's Girl\n\nEdgar Kennedy - Lover\n\nJosef Swickard - Sleeping Victim\n\nProduction Team\n\nCharles Chaplin - Writer/Director\n\nMack Sennett - Producer\n\nCaught in a Cabaret\n\nTwo reels\n\nCharlie Chaplin's twelfth film for the Keystone company was also his\n\ndirectorial debut, getting a co-directing credit with co-star, Mabel\n\nNormand. Chaplin plays a waiter in a seedy cabaret who is always in\n\ntrouble with his boss, Edgar Kennedy, and at odds with another waiter,\n\nChester Conklin. While walking his dachshund in a park during his lunch\n\nbreak, he rescues rich girl Mabel from the clutches of a thief who has\n\nchased away her boyfriend, Harry McCoy.. Charlie introduces himself as\n\nO.T. Axle, Ambassador from Greece, (the first of Chaplin's \"impersonation\"\n\nroles) and is brought home to meet her parents and receive their thanks,\n\nmuch to the chagrin of Mabel's boyfriend. He receives an invitation to\n\nreturn later for a garden party. The suspicious boyfriend follows Charlie\n\nback to work and discovers the truth. Back at work Charlie deals with a\n\nbullying customer, Mack Swain, by serving him a drink and knocking him\n\nout with a large mallet when Swain tilts his head back to drink. Later, at\n\nthe garden party, Charlie misbehaves, getting drunk, flirting with Mabel\n\nand singing loudly along with the band. The boyfriend, watching from a\n\ndistance is now determined to expose him. When Charlie takes his leave to\n\nreturn to work, Harry suggests that the party go slumming to the very\n\ncabaret at which Charlie works. When the upper class guests arrive they are\n\ntreated like royalty by the workers and other patrons. When Charlie\n\ndiscovers them at his table he hides the apron he's wearing and sits down\n\nnext to Mabel, pretending that he's another guest. When the boss scolds him\n\nfor sitting down on the job, Charlie is exposed as a lowly waiter, much to\n\nthe shock of Mabel and her father. A melee then ensues between Charlie and\n\nhis pistol wielding Boss, who Charlie knocks out while Mabel hides under a\n\ntable.

It follows the well trodden path of the classic\n\nKeystone park/hotel farces with a few twists added in. The film opens in\n\nEcho Park where couple Mack Swain and Alice Davenport are seated on a bench .\n\nHubby gets up to buy refreshments at a nearby stand.\n\nWe first see Charlie by a drinking fountain as he flirts with Alice. Mack returns\n\nand chases Charlie off, fighting with Alice all the while. The arguing\n\ncouple return to their hotel, while The Tramp goes off to a saloon. He\n\nlater arrives at the hotel where, it turns out, they are all guests.\n\nCharlie wreaks a bit of havoc in the lobby, flirting with the ladies and\n\nupsetting the desk clerk. His acrobatic efforts to mount the stairs in his\n\ninebriated condition anticipates his classic short One A.M.. Charlie\n\nfinally makes it upstairs but enters the wrong room, interrupting the now\n\nreconciled Mack and Alice. Mack, jealous again, ejects Charlie from the\n\nroom. Charlie goes to his own room across the hall where he comically\n\nprepares for bed. Meanwhile Mack has gone out for a drink, and his\n\nsleepwalking wife now enters Charlie's room, sits on his bed waking him up,\n\nand begins searching his pants for money. Charlie wakes her up, and is\n\nabout to escort her back to her room, when Mack returns. When Mack goes\n\ndownstairs to find his missing wife, Charlie takes her back to her room.\n\nJust as Charlie is about to leave, Mack appears in the hall. Panicked,\n\nAlice pushes Charlie, still in his pajamas, out the window and onto the\n\nbalcony, in the middle of a drenching deluge. Meanwhile a suspicious Mack\n\nhas again taken up the fight with his wife. A Keystone Kop on the sidewalk\n\nbelow assumes Charlie's a burglar and begins firing his pistol, which\n\ncauses Charlie to burst back into the room. A melee ensues in which the\n\ncops are scared away, Mack collapses in Charlie's room, and Charlie and\n\nAlice pass out on the hallway floor.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Tipsy Hotel Guest\n\nAlice Davenport - Wife\n\nMack Swain - Husband\n\nAlice Howell - Hotel Guest\n\nPeggy Page - Chambermaid\n\nGrover Ligon - Cop\n\nSlim Summerville - Cop\n\nProduction Team\n\nCharles Chaplin - Writer/Director\n\nMack Sennett - Producer\n\nA Busy Day\n\nSplit Reel\n\na.k.a. Lady Charlie, A Militant Suffragette\n\nNotable as Charlie Chaplin's first female impersonation film, the half-\n\nreel A Busy Day is another of the Keystone shorts in which a film crew\n\nwas dispatched to improvise a comedy at the site of a public event, in this\n\ncase a parade celebrating the opening of a new harbor in San Pedro,\n\nCalifornia. Chaplin plays a shrewish wife, attending the event with her\n\nphilandering husband, Mack Swain. Mack takes up with a young woman at the\n\nparade and his wife follows him around trying to catch them in the act. In\n\nthe process, \"she\" gets involved with a film crew trying to record the\n\nevent, getting in the way of the camera as Chaplin's Tramp had done in the\n\nearlier Kid Auto Races. In this case the director who manhandles the\n\nobstreperous wife is Keystone boss, Mack Sennett. The jealous wife also\n\nengages in some humorous dancing as she listens to the band play, and\n\ntussles with a cop who earlier had tried to get her away from the movie\n\ncamera. Eventually she catches up to Mack and his paramour and when she\n\nconfronts and attacks them, she is thrown off a pier into the ocean\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Wife\n\nMack Swain - Husband\n\n? - The Other Woman\n\nBilly Gilbert - Cop, Bystander\n\nMack Sennett - Newsreel Film Director\n\nProduction Team\n\nCharles Chaplin - Director\n\nMack Sennett - Producer\n\nThe Fatal Mallet\n\nCharlie Chaplin's fifteenth comedy for Keystone is another violent park\n\nfarce. It is the only teaming of this quartet of Keystone stars. Chaplin,\n\nMack Sennett and Mack Swain are all suitors for the attentions of\n\nMabel Normand. Charlie comes upon Sennett (playing his \"dumb rube\"\n\ncharacter) and Normand flirting by a tree. Charlie attempts to dispatch\n\nSennett with a thrown brick, but grazes Mabel, incurring her wrath. Swain,\n\nthe rival who seems to have Mabel's favor, shows up and takes Mabel off.\n\nCharlie and Sennett sneak up on Swain, seated on a swing with Mabel, and\n\nknock him out with more bricks. A series of confrontations between the\n\nthree suitors ensue, won mainly by Chaplin. He ends up temporarily\n\nimprisoning his rivals in a nearby shed, through his deft use of a large\n\nmallet (although not fatal) which he wields with customary grace. Due to\n\nhis bullying of a young boy who he discovers sitting with Mabel, Charlie\n\ndoesn't win her favor. When the recovered Swain confronts him, Swain winds\n\nup in the lake. Sennett, watching from nearby, returns and similarly\n\ndispatches Charlie, and then strolls away with Mabel on his arm.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Suitor\n\nMabel Normand - Mabel\n\nMack Sennett - Rival Suitor\n\nMack Swain - Another Rival\n\nGordon Griffith - Boy\n\nHer Friend the Bandit\n\nChaplin's sixteenth film for Keystone is the only Chaplin film known to be\n\nlost. What we know of its plot comes from the movie magazines of the day.\n\nApparently Charlie is the bandit who accosts a Count on his way to a\n\nsociety party and assumes his clothes, invitation and identity. He\n\nencounters rich girl Mabel Normand there and eventually the Keystone Kops\n\nshow up to arrest Charlie. The plot seems to anticipate Chaplin's later\n\nMutual film, The Count.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Bandit\n\nMabel Normand - Mrs. De Rocks\n\nCharlie Murray - Count De Beans\n\nThe Knockout\n\nTwo reels\n\nAlthough better known as Charlie Chaplin's seventeenth appearance in a\n\nKeystone comedy, The Knockout is really a Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle film.\n\nThe big event in Fatty's town is a prize fight in which champ Cyclone Flynn\n\nwill meet all comers. Fatty is tricked into accepting the fight by two\n\nhobos who are making book on the fight. Through a note ostensibly from\n\nFlynn, they offer Fatty a split if he throws the fight, but Fatty, thinking\n\none of the hobos is Flynn, refuses. The real Flynn arrives and dispatches\n\nthe impostors. The match proceeds with heavy betting going on and Fatty's\n\ngirlfriend dressed as a boy in order to gain entrance to the arena. Charlie\n\nis the referee who is constantly being knocked down by the fighters because\n\nhe keeps getting in between them. Angered by losing after a short count,\n\nFatty grabs two six-guns from a gambler at ringside and begins firing in\n\nall directions. Cyclone takes to his heels and a classic rooftop Keystone\n\nchase ensues, with the Keystone Kops in pursuit of Fatty, in pursuit of\n\nCyclone. When the Kops lasso Fatty, he drags six of them along the ground\n\nby the rope until he leaps off a pier taking them all with him. With\n\neveryone treading water, the Kops surround Fatty as the film ends.\n\nCast\n\nRoscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle - Fatty\n\nMinta Durfee - Fatty's Girlfriend\n\nEdgar Kennedy - Cyclone Flynn\n\nCharles Chaplin - Referee\n\nFrank Opperman - Fight Promoter\n\nJoe Bordeaux - Policeman\n\nCharley Chase - Policeman, Spectator\n\nEdward F.

It was shot entirely on location at an automobile race track during a racing event.\n\nMabel plays a hot dog vendor who sneaks in to the track by bribing the cop who guards the gate with one of her hot dogs. As soon as she sets up shop she's accosted by various male customers who give her a hard time by refusing to pay, or returning a hot dog when she has no change.\n\nChaplin isn't dressed in his usual Tramp outfit, but as a race track tout in a frock coat with a flower in his lapel. He is clearly broke - he sneaks into the stadium by beating up a cop and crashing past a ticket taker and, finding one of Mabel's hot dogs on the ground, first tries to light it from the stub of his cigar, and then eats it hungrily. Charlie rescues Mabel from a particularly aggressive customer, but then steals her tray and tries to sell the hot dogs himself. The other race track fans give him a hard time as well, jostling him about and knocking off his hat. Meanwhile, Mabel has fetched a cop who the agile Chaplin bests in a fight. Defeated, Mabel bursts into tears and Charlie, touched by her emotions, decides he feels sorry for her and walks off with her arm in arm, presumably to protect her from further harassment.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Tipsy Nuisance\n\nMabel Normand - Mabel\n\nChester Conklin - Policeman\n\nMack Sennett - Customer\n\nGlen Cavender - Customer\n\nBillie Bennett - Woman\n\nEdgar Kennedy - Spectator\n\nHarry Mc Coy - Spectator\n\nCharley Chase - Spectator\n\nPeggy Page - Spectator\n\nSlim Summerville - Policeman\n\nWallace MacDonald - Spectator\n\nFrank Opperman - Spectator\n\nCharles Bennett - Spectator\n\nMabel's Married Life\n\nIn his nineteenth film for Keystone Charlie Chaplin plays a somewhat more\n\nsympathetic role as the husband of comedienne Mabel Normand. As so many\n\nof his Keystone comedies do, it begins in a park where Mack Swain,\n\ndressed in a sporty outfit and carrying a tennis racquet, leaves his wife\n\nseated on a bench and goes off to a neighbouring saloon. Charlie and Mabel\n\nare seated on a nearby bench arguing about the state of Charlie's worn out\n\nshoes. Charlie goes off for a drink in the saloon, passing Mack on the way\n\nin, who returns to the park and begins to flirt with Mabel. She is first\n\nbemused by his attentions but then is outraged when Charlie returns and is\n\nunable to rescue her. In fact he isn't even able to get Mack's attention\n\ndespite increasingly hard kicks to Mack's posterior, anticipating Charlie's\n\nconfrontation with the bully in Easy Street. Mack eventually flings\n\nCharlie's top hat off in the direction of the bench where Mack's wife is\n\nseated. While Charlie retrieves the hat Mack take Mabel over to the lake\n\nshore where despite her protestations and calls for Charlie to help her, he\n\npersists in mashing her. Mack's wife hears the commotion and, with Charlie,\n\nshe confronts Mack and Mabel, accusing Mabel of flirting with Mack.\n\nCharlie, angry with Mabel, sends her home. Mabel, angry with Charlie for\n\nhis weakness in not defending her, buys a prizefighter's dummy, which is\n\ndressed just like Mack, from a sporting goods store. Meanwhile, Charlie has\n\nreturned to the saloon where he is harassed by the other patrons including\n\nMack. Finally, Charlie is drunk enough to defend himself which he does by\n\nfelling all four patrons with one well placed kick. The dummy is delivered\n\nto Charlie and Mabel's apartment and when Charlie comes home, he drunkenly\n\nbelieves the dummy to be Mack. He is intimidated by the dummy and tries to\n\npacify it, offering it a drink. Whenever he pushes it, it rebounds and\n\nknocks him to the floor. Finally, Mabel enters from the bedroom and shows\n\nher soused husband that he's been afraid of a dummy.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Husband\n\nMabel Normand - Wife\n\nMack Swain - Wellington, a Ladykiller\n\nEva Nelson - Wellington's Wife\n\nAlice Davenport - Neighbor\n\nDixie Chene - Neighbor\n\nHank Mann - Tough in Bar\n\nHarry Mc Coy - Man in Bar\n\nCharles Murray - Man in Bar\n\nGrover Ligon - Bartender\n\nFrank Opperman - Sporting Goods Salesman\n\nWallace MacDonald - Delivery Boy\n\nLaughing Gas\n\nCharlie Chaplin's twentieth film for Keystone marks a turning point in\n\nhis career. From this point on, with one exception, he was to write and\n\ndirect all his future films.\n\nIn Laughing Gas Chaplin plays a dentist's assistant who is first seen\n\nentering the office officiously. The patients are fooled into thinking he is the\n\ndentist himself, until he picks up the spittoons and exits to a back room. He\n\nconfronts a midget size co-worker there. The Dentist finally arrives and the\n\nfirst patient is admitted. Laughing gas is administered and the extraction\n\nperformed, but the dentist is not able to awaken the patient. He sends Charlie\n\nout to the pharmacy for an antidote.\n\nCharlie encounters Mack Swain who is standing in front of the pharmacy, blocking the\n\nentrance. Charlie gains entrance by performing some of his famous hat tricks, which\n\nnon plus Swain. Exiting the pharmacy Charlie gets into a fight with Swain which evolves\n\ninto brick throwing. Swain and an innocent bystander, Slim Summerville, are both hit\n\nOn his way back to the office, Charlie encounters and flirts with the dentist's wife, and accidentally tears off her skirt. When Charlie arrives with the medicine, the patient has left and the dentist has been called away to attend his distraught wife. Charlie admits a beautiful female patient who he pretends to examine, but with whom he flirts by grasping her nose with a pair of pliers and kissing her, to her apparent amusement. Slim and Mack then arrive at the office and Mack catches sight of Charlie in the back room. The dentist and his wife arrive and a melee ensues in which everyone is literally kicked out onto the pavement, except Charlie and the wife who collapse in the waiting room.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Dentist's Assistant\n\nAlice Howell - Dentist's Wife (Mrs. Pain)\n\nJosef Swickard - Patient\n\nFritz Schade - Dentist (Dr. Pain)\n\nMack Swain - Patient\n\nPeggy Page - Pretty Patient\n\nSlim Summerville - Patient\n\nJoseph Sutherland - Short Assistant\n\nThe Property Man\n\nTwo reels\n\nIn Charlie Chaplin's 21st Keystone film, Charlie is the prop man and\n\ngeneral factotum at a vaudeville house. The artists arrive backstage as\n\nCharlie swigs beer from a pitcher, refusing to share with his elderly,\n\nhunchbacked assistant, whom he mistreats throughout. The headliners are the\n\nGoo-Goo Sisters, with whom Charlie flirts outrageously, while hiding his\n\nbeer in his roomy pants, only to be undone when he bends to pick up one of\n\nthe ladies' purses.\n\nGarlico the Strong Man and his assistant arrive, and Charlie must struggle\n\nto load in his heavy props trunk and the trunks of the other acts. He shifts\n\nhis burden to his assistant, making him carry the heavy trunk on his back,\n\nwhile Charlie carries a hat box. After an argument over dressing rooms, the\n\nshow begins before a rowdy audience which includes Keystone boss\n\nMack Sennett in his \"Rube\" character.\n\nCharlie messes up the acts, going onstage, dropping scenery backdrops at\n\nthe wrong time and fighting with his assistant all the while. When the\n\nstrong man's assistant is accidentally knocked out during the fighting,\n\nCharlie takes her place, disrupting Garlico's act by ripping a piece of\n\ncloth behind his back as he lifts each weight, making him think that it's\n\nhis costume that has ripped. When the infuriated Garlico attacks Charlie, a\n\nmelee breaks out which ends with Charlie grabbing a fire hose and soaking\n\nactors, scenery and audience alike, anticipating similar gags in the\n\nsubsequent films, A Night in the Show and A King in New York.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - The Property Man\n\nJosef Swickard - Assistant Prop Man\n\nJess Dandy - Garlico, the Strongman\n\nPeggy Page - Garlico's assistant\n\nPhyllis Allen - Lena Fat\n\nCharles Bennett - Geo.

The film begins in a saloon where Charlie, a\n\ndestitute Tramp is bumming drinks. He offers to tell the story of his\n\ndownfall to the other patrons, and the story goes into a long flashback\n\nsequence. The Tramp was once a successful artist. We see him dressed in a\n\ntuxedo, at work in his studio, painting a portrait of his wife, played by\n\nCecile Arnold. His next client is a portly man, who is obviously well to\n\ndo. When the wife comes into the studio, she and the client fall instantly in\n\nlove. Later they run off together, leaving a note pinned to the nose of the\n\nportrait. Charlie returns to the studio and upon finding the note, flies into\n\na rage, destroying the portrait.\n\nTime passes. Charlie is now a Tramp in a park. His former wife and her lover\n\ncome into view with four children in tow and another in a baby carriage. She\n\nis berating her new man and doesn't notice Charlie, but her husband looks at\n\nhim enviously. Charlie wipes his brow, looking relieved and strolls off.\n\nBack in the bar room, the flashback finished, Charlie is handed a piece of\n\nchalk. Now quite drunk, he attempts to draw his ex-wife's picture on the\n\nfloor. He is ordered out of the bar by the other patrons and a fight breaks\n\nout, ending with Charlie collapsing, unconscious on the face upon the\n\nfloor.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Artist\n\nCecile Arnold - Madeleine\n\nJess Dandy - Lover who Stole her\n\nVivian Edwards - Model\n\nChester Conklin - Drinker\n\nJosef Swickard - Drinker\n\nFritz Schade - Drinker\n\nCharles Bennett - Sailor\n\nFrank Opperman - Drinker\n\nHarry McCoy - Drinker\n\nNB: The role of Madeleine's lover has been erroneously credited to\n\nFritz Schade, but is actually played by Jess Dandy.

While a sleeping sailor and his bored girl\n\nfriend occupy a park bench, the little Tramp is contemplating suicide on a\n\nnearby bridge. Leaving her boring beau she passes Charlie and inspires in\n\nhim a new will to live. He follows her to another bench and, shyly at\n\nfirst, begins a flirtation. The sailor wakes and finding them together,\n\nchases Charlie away with a hard slap. Charlie, from behind a tree begins a\n\nbrick throwing match in which inevitably, two Kops become involved. One\n\ncomes up behind Charlie as he's about to throw another brick and Charlie\n\n(in a bit of business which anticipates a bit he gave to Jackie Coogan in\n\nhis 1921 classic, The Kid) dusts off the brick, tosses it idly, and\n\nthrows it over his shoulder. Eventually the Kops catch up with the sailor\n\nand he successfully fights them off, getting them embroiled with each\n\nother. Meanwhile the Girl has escaped to the lake side and is joined by\n\nCharlie. When the sailor and Kops arrive, all five end up treading water in\n\nEcho Lake.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Tramp\n\nCharles Bennett - Seaman on Park Bench\n\nPeggy Page - Girl\n\nN.B.: All Chaplin filmographies identify Charlie Murray in the\n\nrole of the sailor. A close examination of the film reveals this\n\nto be in error. Murray, at over 6' tall, towered over Chaplin. The\n\nsailor is roughly the same height and size as Chaplin. He is the\n\nsame actor who plays the sailor in \"Face on the Barroom Floor\"\n\n(in the same costume) and Douglas Banks in \"Tillie's Punctured Romance\",\n\nCharles Bennett.\n\nProduction Team\n\nCharles Chaplin - Director\n\nMack Sennett - Producer\n\nThe Masquerader\n\nVivian Edwards, Chaplin and Cecile Arnold\n\nCharlie Chaplin's twenty fourth short for the Keystone company is a film\n\nabout making films at Keystone. It is unusual in that we see Chaplin the\n\nactor, Charlie the Tramp, and Chaplin's second female impersonation in a\n\nfilm. The film opens outside the Keystone Studio where Chaplin, in street\n\nclothes, is talking to Mabel Normand and a reporter, who is writing on a\n\npad. Charlie Murray emerges and grabs Chaplin by the ear and drags him\n\ninside - it's time for work. Murray leaves Chaplin at the dressing room\n\nwhere Fatty Arbuckle is also preparing for work. Chaplin begins by\n\nbrushing off his Tramp pants. Seated at a dressing table across from\n\nArbuckle he hears Fatty open a beer bottle and tries to sneak a swig, but\n\nFatty substitutes his hair tonic instead. Meanwhile, on the stage, Murray\n\nis rehearsing a melodramatic scene with two actors. Chaplin is now in\n\ncostume as the Tramp. On the set, Charlie misses his entrance because he is\n\nflirting with two lovely actresses, and messes up the scene. He is replaced\n\nby fellow actor Chester Conklin, but interferes with Chester's entrance\n\nand is chased out of the studios. The next day a \"Beautiful Stranger\"\n\nappears - it's Charlie in drag and his female impersonation is perfect. He\n\nimmediately attracts the attentions of every male in the company,\n\nespecially director Murray's. Murray tries to make time with the stranger\n\nand hires her to act in films. He gives her the men's dressing room, amid\n\nthe objections of all the actors. While Murray's back is turned Charlie\n\nlets us in on the gag by winking at the camera, and later takes a very\n\nunladylike drag on Murray's cigarette. Alone, Charlie removes his disguise,\n\nand resumes his Tramp outfit. When the director comes looking for his new\n\nactress, he finds Charlie and discovers his deception. He chases Charlie\n\nthrough the various film sets until Charlie jumps into what he thinks is a\n\nprop well. It turns out to be a real one and the film closes as Murray and\n\nthe actors mock Charlie as he struggles, sinking, at the bottom of the\n\nwell.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Film Actor/Beautiful Stranger\n\nCharles Murray - Film Director\n\nChester Conklin - Film Actor\n\nRoscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle - Film Actor\n\nMabel Normand - Actress\n\nCecile Arnold - Actress\n\nVivian Edwards - Actress\n\nCharley Chase - Actor\n\nPeggy Page - Actress\n\nMinta Durfee - Leading Lady\n\nHarry Mc Coy - Actor\n\nJess Dandy - Actor/Villain\n\nGlen Cavender - Other Director\n\nFrank Opperman - Actor\n\nBilly Gilbert - Cameraman\n\nHis New Profession\n\nCharlie Chaplin's 25th Keystone comedy is a park farce on the same order\n\nas many of his earlier shorts. It opens with a famous shot of Charlie\n\nsitting on a park bench, reading Police Gazette, the National Enquirer of\n\nits time. A couple nearby are unhappy; the boy, Charles Parrot (later\n\nknown as Charley Chase), has to take care of his gouty, wheelchair bound\n\nuncle, preventing him from going off with his girlfriend. He gets an\n\nidea - find someone to push uncle around for the day. He finds Charlie,\n\nof course, but not before his girlfriend encounters the Tramp. She\n\naccidentally drops her purse in front of him and he retrieves it and tries\n\nto flirt. When Charlie agrees to push Uncle around, the Nephew finds his\n\ngirlfriend and they go off for a stroll. Wheeling Uncle past a saloon,\n\nCharlie asks for an advance for a drink but the Uncle refuses. Charlie\n\npushes Uncle to a nearby pier where another invalid in a wheelchair with a\n\ntin cup and a \"Help A Cripple\" sign has fallen asleep. Charlie deftly puts\n\nthe sign and cup on Uncle, who is also dozing. The first contribution is\n\nenough to send Charlie off to the saloon for a drink. Meanwhile the couple\n\narrive at the pier and find the sleeping Uncle in this embarrassing\n\nposition. Gene laughingly teases her beau as they again escape. Another\n\ncharitable soul comes by and drops a coin in the cup which awakens the\n\ncripple who takes back his sign and cup and strikes Uncle on his gouty foot\n\nwith his cane. Charlie arrives quite tipsy and wheels Uncle further along\n\nthe pier, amusing him with his Police Gazette. The couple has meanwhile had\n\na fight and the girl arrives on the pier and sits down next to Charlie. He\n\nbegins flirting again and when Uncle tries to interfere Charlie pushes him\n\nright to the end of the pier. Nephew arrives and is enraged to see Charlie\n\nand Gene together. A scrap begins also involving a couple of Kops, one of\n\nwhom shoos the boyfriend away before being pushed off the pier. The other\n\nKop pinches Uncle as a troublemaker, leaving Charlie and Gene to walk off\n\ntogether.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Charlie\n\nCharley Chase - Nephew\n\nPeggy Page - Nephew's girlfriend\n\nJess Dandy - Uncle\n\nCecile Arnold - Girl with eggs\n\nRoscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle - Bartender\n\nBilly Hauber - Policeman\n\nGlen Cavender - Man at Bar/Cripple\n\nCharlie Murray - Man at Bar\n\nVivian Edwards - Nurse\n\nProduction Team\n\nCharles Chaplin - Director, Scenario\n\nMack Sennett - Producer\n\nThe Rounders\n\nIn his twenty-sixth Keystone comedy Charlie Chaplin pairs off with fellow\n\nKeystone star Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle.

The\n\nfilm is a forerunner of his later Essanay film The Bank. It is the first\n\nChaplin film in which is seen a glimmer of the pathos mixed with comedy\n\nthat would become his Tramp's defining characteristic. Charlie is first\n\nseen in the lobby of the building with his broom and dustpan being shut out\n\nof an elevator ride by a nasty elevator operator. He makes the long climb\n\nupstairs and begins his duties cleaning the offices, but bungles most of\n\nthe jobs. Dusting in the President's office he is clearly smitten by the lovely\n\nstenographer. She is in love with the Manager, which is seen\n\nas she caresses his hat hanging outside his office. In that office the\n\nManager receives a note from his bookie who threatens to expose him if he\n\ndoes not pay his gambling debts. He decides to rob the safe in the\n\nPresident's office. Meanwhile, Charlie accidentally dumps a bucket of\n\nwater out the office window which soaks the President. Enraged, the\n\nPresident rushes upstairs and fires Charlie, who begs for his job. (During\n\na rehearsal of this scene, according to Chaplin's autobiography, Alice\n\nDavenport watching from the sidelines found Charlie's protestations so\n\npathetic she burst into tears.) Unable to change the Presidents mind,\n\nCharlie heads downstairs to the storage room and prepares to leave. When\n\nthe President and the stenographer leave, the Manager sneaks into the\n\nPresident's office and opens the safe. He's caught by the steno who has\n\nreturned unexpectedly and he attacks her, threatening her with a gun. Just\n\nbefore she faints, she presses a call button which rings in the janitor's\n\nstorage room. Charlie, after a moment of indecision, makes his way upstairs\n\nand seeing the situation, knocks the gun from the Manager's hand. Bending\n\nover to pick it up with his back turned, he holds the Manager at bay by\n\naiming the gun between his legs. He steps over his arms and goes to the\n\nwindow, firing some shots which quickly brings a cop to the office. The\n\nPresident arrives and when it is assumed that Charlie is the hold up man,\n\nhe is apprehended by the cop. The stenographer awakens and identifies\n\nCharlie as the real hero, who receives a reward and a handshake for his\n\nefforts.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Janitor\n\nJohn T.

After the mid day meal each of the rivals tries to chat up the\n\nlandlady, only to be prevented by the other.\n\nThey decide to go out together to prevent a fight, but split up as Charlie\n\nstops in front of a bar while Chester proceeds to a park. Charlie is\n\ndistracted, however, by a passing beauty who gives him the eye. He follows\n\nher a bit but is put off by the lady's large boyfriend. Going on to the\n\npark, Charlie has a confrontation with the large boyfriend and observes\n\nChester's meeting with his girlfriend who is incredibly solicitous. She\n\nbegs for affection and even gives Chester money, much to Charlie's\n\namazement and envy. Charlie eventually dispatches both boyfriends and\n\nfollows the girls to a movie theatre where, sitting between them, he charms\n\nthe pair of beauties making some rather amusing gestures with his feet. The\n\nboyfriends show up and replace the girls in their seats while Charlie\n\ndozes. A fight ensues in which Charlie is thrown through the movie screen.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Masher\n\nChester Conklin - Rival\n\nPeggy Page - Landlady\n\nCecile Arnold - Blond Girl\n\nVivian Edwards - Brunette Girl\n\nHarry Mc Coy - Policeman\n\nFritz Schade - Movie Patron\n\nFred Fishback - Vivian's Boyfriend\n\nSlim Summerville - Movie Patron\n\nGrover Ligon - Movie Patron\n\nBilly Gilbert - Movie Patron\n\nBilly Hauber - Movie Patron\n\nProduction Team\n\nCharles Chaplin - Director, Scenario\n\nMack Sennett- Producer\n\nDough and Dynamite\n\nTwo reels\n\nCharlie Chaplin's 29th comedy for Keystone was one of his most popular,\n\ngrossing $130,000 in its initial year of release. It was shot before, but\n\nreleased after Those Love Pangs, and was originally conceived as an early\n\nsequence of the latter, showing Charlie and Chester Conklin at work in a\n\ncombination cafe/bakery. The sequence was so good Mack Sennett suggested\n\nthat Chaplin expand it. Waiter Charlie has his mind on a waitress as he\n\nclears one patron's plate onto the food of another. He mans the bakery\n\ncounter and is taken with a female customer, especially her hip movements\n\nwhich he imitates. He gets into fights with fellow waiter Chester and\n\ndisrupts work in the bakery below. The bakers strike for higher wages and\n\nCharlie and Chester are imprest into service as bakers at which both are\n\ninept. The striking bakers plot revenge as one of them buys a loaf of bread\n\nand inserts a stick of dynamite into it. They send a little girl to return\n\nit as undercooked, and the owner's wife brings it downstairs to have it\n\nbaked further. She observes Charlie's method of bagel making - whipping a\n\nroll of dough around his wrist forming a ring and rolling it off over his\n\nhand. Meanwhile the owner, Fritz Schade, has been noticing that the\n\nwaitresses have dough on their derrieres, indicating they've been\n\nsocializing with Charlie in the bakery. When his wife returns from\n\ndownstairs, the owner likewise sees dough on her behind, put there by\n\nCharlie, and he flies into a rage. He goes down to the bakery and berates\n\nCharlie, slaps him around and chases him upstairs to the restaurant and\n\ndown again. In self defense Charlie flings dough and flour bags at Fritz\n\nand Chester. Just then the oven explodes, covering Chester and Fritz with\n\ndebris and burying Charlie under a huge lump of dough from which he\n\nemerges, eyes first, as the film ends.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Pierre\n\nChester Conklin - Jacques\n\nFritz Schade - Monsieur La Vie, bakery owner\n\nNorma Nichols - Owner's Wife\n\nVivian Edwards - Customer\n\nCecile Arnold - Waitress\n\nJess Dandy - Female Cook\n\nCharles Bennett - Angry Customer\n\nCharley Chase - Customer\n\nGlen Cavender - Head Baker\n\nSlim Summerville - Striking Baker\n\nPhyllis Allen - Customer\n\nWallace MacDonald - Customer\n\nN.B.

However this time, as Chaplin scholar Harry Geduld\n\nsuggests, it was likely shot at the Keystone studios with shots of the race\n\nintercut. Charlie tries to sneak in by walking backwards through the gate\n\nbut is turned back. He has a contretemps with Ambrose (Mack Swain), also\n\ntrying to sneak in. The two resolve their differences for the moment and\n\ntry to sneak in through a gap in the fence. Swain gets stuck and Charlie\n\ntries to help him through the gap with pushes, kicks and by trying to wedge\n\nhim in with a baseball bat. Mabel and boyfriend Chester are there too, but\n\nChester insists on flirting with the unlikely Phyllis Allen. Mabel, fed up\n\nwith Chester's infidelity, is charmed by the nervy gentleman tramp. When\n\nChester returns to the grandstand to reclaim a protesting Mabel, Charlie\n\ncomes to her rescue. He shoves Chester into Ambrose and a cop, who arrests\n\nboth as troublemakers, to the delight of Charlie and Mabel. Mabel rewards\n\nCharlie by letting him kiss her hand and playfully tweaks his nose as the\n\nnew couple enjoy the rest of the race.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Mr. Wow-Wow\n\nMabel Normand - Mabel\n\nChester Conklin - Walrus\n\nMack Swain - Ambrose\n\nPhyllis Allen - Flirty woman\n\nCharley Chase - Spectator at entrance\n\nCecile Arnold - Spectator\n\nPeggy Page - Spectator with checkered coat\n\nHarry McCoy - Spectator\n\nGlen Cavender - Spectator at entrance, Cop\n\nTammany Young - Spectator at entrance\n\nSlim Summerville - Spectator\n\nVivian Edwards - Spectator\n\nBilly Gilbert* - Spectator\n\nBilly Hauber - Spectator\n\nDixie Chene - Spectator with bottle\n\nAlice Davenport - Patron at outdoor bar\n\nFred Fishback - Spectator\n\nProduction Team\n\nCharles Chaplin - Director, Scenario\n\nMack Sennett - Producer\n\nHis Musical Career\n\nCharlie Chaplin's musical career is as a piano mover for a music store in\n\nthis, his thirty-first comedy for Keystone. The film is a direct\n\ninspiration for Laurel and Hardy's 1932 short, The Music Box. His\n\nLittle Fellow is not a tramp but a hard-working labourer. Charlie is first\n\nseen applying for his job, being examined, muscles and even teeth, by Mack\n\nSwain. In the showroom, we see Mr. Rich (Fritz Schade) deciding to buy a\n\npiano from salesman, Charley Chase, and a few moments later, Mr. Poor\n\nbeing threatened that his piano will be repossessed if he can't make his\n\npayments. Mack and Charlie are sent to deliver the one piano and pick up\n\nthe other, for which, of course, they will mix up the addresses. As they\n\ntake the piano outside, Mack pulls Charlie along the showroom floor, as\n\nCharlie smiles to the camera, expressing his delight in a free ride. They\n\nload the piano onto the horse-drawn wagon. At one point the slope is so\n\nsevere that when Mack leans to the back of the wagon, the donkey is lifted\n\nright off the ground. Arriving at Mr. Poor's house the residents are\n\ndelighted that they seem to be receiving a free piano, as Charlie carries\n\nthe piano on his back and must be straightened out by boss Mack. Next, the\n\nmovers proceed to Mr. Rich's house and proceed to take his piano, over the\n\nobjections of Mrs. Rich. Mr. Rich arrives as Charlie and Mack get the piano out\n\nto the sidewalk. A kick to Mack's backside sends the piano, Charlie and Mack\n\nskidding down a steep hill, and to Mr. Rich's horror, into Echo Lake in Echo Park\n\nwhere Charlie plays some last notes before they begin to sink.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Piano Mover\n\nMack Swain - Mike, His Partner\n\nFrank Hayes - Mr. Poor\n\nPeggy Page - Miss Poor\n\nCharley Chase - Piano Store Manager\n\nBilly Gilbert - Piano Store Salesman\n\nCecile Arnold - Mrs. Rich\n\nFritz Schade - Mr. Rich\n\nBilly Hauber - Servant\n\nHis Trysting Place\n\nTwo reels\n\nIn his 32nd film for Keystone, Charlie Chaplin is a married man, an\n\nunusual state for his film character. His wife, played by Mabel Normand,\n\ncomplains that they have no money for new shoes for her or food for their\n\nbaby. They have a fight and Charlie leaves, promising to bring a present\n\nhome for their son. Meanwhile another couple in a hotel room are rather\n\nlovey, as the wife, Phyllis Allen helps hubby Ambrose, Mack Swain\n\nprepare to go out. On his way out, a young lady who has just completed a\n\nlove letter asks Ambrose to mail it for her. He puts the letter in his\n\ncoat pocket. Charlie goes to a drug store and buys a bottle for the baby,\n\nwhich he puts in his coat pocket. He proceeds to a diner where,\n\ncoincidentally, Ambrose has gone for lunch. The pair get into a funny food\n\nfight at the lunch counter, and switch coats accidentally. When Charlie\n\narrives home Mabel finds the note in his pocket and flies into a rage,\n\neventually breaking an ironing board over his head. Charlie escapes to a\n\nnearby park where Ambrose has met his wife who consoles him over the\n\nbeating he has just taken from Charlie. Calmed down, Mack goes to a nearby\n\nrefreshment stand. Mabel has by now caught up with Charlie and is\n\ndelivering quite a beating, which delights Mack. Meanwhile, Phyllis has\n\nfound the baby bottle in \"his\" coat pocket and when he returns to their\n\nbench berates him for his infidelity. When Mabel shows Charlie the note she\n\nhas found, he examines the coat and the mystery is solved. The two men\n\nexchange coats, but when Charlie returns the love note to Mack, Phyllis\n\nattacks him with her umbrella. But Charlie, Mabel and their baby are\n\nreunited in a picture of connubial bliss.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Clarence, the Husband\n\nMabel Normand - Mabel, His Wife\n\nMack Swain - Ambrose\n\nPhyllis Allen - Ambrose's Wife\n\nPeggy Page - Clarice\n\nNick Cogley - Bearded Diner\n\nFrank Hayes - Diner\n\nGlen Cavender - Cook, Park Cop\n\nVivian Edwards - Lady Outside Restaurant\n\nBilly Gilbert - Restaurant Patron\n\nProduction Team\n\nCharles Chaplin - Screenwriter, Director\n\nMack Sennett - Producer\n\nTillie's Punctured Romance\n\nSix reels\n\nThis Keystone comedy, Charlie Chaplin's 33rd, is the first feature length comedy\n\never made and contributed to making Chaplin and his co-star Marie Dressler major\n\nstars.\n\nChaplin plays a con artist (not the Tramp) who talks Tillie, an innocent country lass,\n\ninto taking her father's savings and running off to the city with him. Once there,\n\nhe re-establishes his affair with the beautiful Mabel Normand, abandoning\n\nTillie, who must begin working at a restaurant, while Charlie and Mabel\n\nspend her father's money for new clothes.\n\nMeanwhile, Tillie's millionaire uncle is reported to have died in a mountain climbing\n\naccident. When the opportunistic Charlie learns that Tillie has just inherited three\n\nmillion dollars, he immediately rushes over to propose. She joyfully accepts, but\n\nis suspicious when she learns of her inheritance. Later, at a wedding gala\n\nat Tillie's new mansion where Normand has begun working as a maid, Charlie\n\nsneaks off for a little tete-a-tete with the latter. Trouble erupts when\n\nDressler catches them smooching. Suddenly all the slapstick craziness for\n\nwhich director Mack Sennett is famous erupts as Tillie grabs a pistol and\n\nbegins chasing Charlie and Mabel, firing randomly. Just as the wayward\n\nCharlie is to be strangled to death, the \"late\" uncle suddenly appears and\n\nejects all the celebrants. Charlie and Mabel, chased by Tillie race out of\n\nthe ruined mansion to a pier where they are followed by the ubiquitous\n\nKeystone Kops whom the uncle has summoned. Tillie ends up in the drink, and\n\nwhen rescued after numerous attempts, rejects Charlie while consoling Mabel\n\nsaying, \"He ain't no good to neither of us\", as the Kops drag Charlie away.\n\nCast\n\nMarie Dressler - Tillie Banks, Country Girl\n\nCharles Chaplin - Charlie, City Slicker\n\nMabel Normand - Mabel, Charlie's Girl Friend\n\nMack Swain - John Banks, Tillie's Father\n\nCharles Bennett - Douglas Banks; Mortgage Holder; Maitre D'\n\nChester Conklin - Mr. Whoozis, Friend of Douglas Banks\n\nPhyllis Allen - Wardress\n\nBillie Bennett - Maid and Guest\n\nCharley Chase - Detective at Movie Theatre\n\nAlice Davenport - Guest\n\nDixie Chene - Guest\n\nPeggy Page - Maid and Waitress\n\nGordon Griffith - Newsboy\n\nAlice Howell - Guest\n\nEdgar Kennedy - Restaurant Owner, Butler\n\nGlen Cavender - Pianist in Restaurant and Cop\n\nHarry Mc Coy - Second Pianist in Restaurant and Pianist in Theater\n\nFritz Schade - Waiter and Diner\n\nCharles Murray - Detective in Film\n\nMinta Durfee - Crook's Accomplice in Film\n\nFrank Opperman - Rev.

Phyllis Allen, Mabel Normand, Mack Swain, Charlie Chaplin\n\nCharlie Chaplin's penultimate Keystone comedy takes us back to the\n\nscene of so many of his Keystones, Echo Park. It is unusual in\n\nthat it is a story of two married couples with wandering husbands:\n\nCharlie and battle-ax Phyllis Allen, and Mack Swain and Mabel\n\nNormand. Mack and Mabel, taking the air, spot a stalled sports car\n\nwhich fascinates Mack, who leaves Mabel and goes off to help the\n\ndriver start it up. Seated on a park bench with Charlie, Phyllis has\n\nhas fallen asleep.\n\nA beautiful young woman, Cecile Arnold pauses by the bench, looking\n\nfor her beau, a mysterious Turk. Charlie flirts with her and is spurned, but\n\nleaves Phyllis asleep and chases after her. When he catches up, the Turk\n\narrives and after a brief confrontation in which he stabs Charlie in the backside,\n\nCharlie is chased off. Charlie comes upon Mabel and begins to mash her.\n\nTipping his hat, he hooks her skirt with his upside down cane and raises it\n\nabove her knees. When she protests, he scolds the cane as if it had a mind of its\n\nown. Mack arrives on the scene and doesn't heed Mabel's complaints but introduces\n\nher to Charlie, who he seems to know. Mack leaves them alone to go back to the\n\ncar, and Charlie persists in mashing Mabel until a cop shows up behind\n\nCharlie. Mabel then turns all smiles and winks hoping Charlie will mash her\n\nin the presence of the cop which he does, until the presence of the cop's\n\nbilly club on his shoulder makes him take to his heels. Meanwhile Mack has\n\ncome upon Phyllis and begins to mash her. Her cries also bring the cop who\n\nchases Mack away. Mabel and Phyllis eventually meet and commiserate with\n\neach other about the mashers they've encountered in the park. There\n\nfollows a series of comedic chases and fights between the cop and Charlie\n\nand Mack. While hiding from the cop in the same bushes they are both\n\napprehended and dragged off, but Phyllis and Mabel intercede to save their\n\nspouses from the clutches of the police. The two couples reconcile their\n\ndifferences but Charlie still insists on flirting and Phyllis, to Mack and\n\nMabel's amusement, drags him off by the seat of his pants.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Mr. Sniffels\n\nPhyllis Allen - Mrs. Sniffels\n\nMabel Normand - Ambrose's Wife\n\nMack Swain - Ambrose\n\nCecile Arnold - Mary\n\nGlen Cavender - Turk\n\nEdgar Kennedy - Cop\n\nHarry McCoy and Peggy Page - Young Couple in Park\n\nJoe Bordeaux - Stalled Driver\n\nHis Prehistoric Past\n\nTwo reels\n\nIn his thirty fifth and last Keystone comedy, Charlie Chaplin parodied the\n\nrecent hit, D.W. Griffith's stone age drama, Man's Genesis. Charlie is\n\ncaveman Weakchin, dressed in derby, cane and bearskin. He plucks some fur\n\nfrom his bearskin and fills his pipe with it, lighting the pipe by picking\n\nup a stone and striking it against his thigh. He is an outsider, invading\n\nthe territory and harem of King Lowbrow. At first welcomed by the King, Weakchin\n\npersists in wooing Sum Babee, one of Lowbrow's favorite wives. Eventually the men\n\nclash and Weakchin kicks Lowbrow over a cliff. Taking over the leadership of the\n\ntribe, Weakchin repairs to the King's cave with another Mrs. Lowbrow. Rescued by\n\nhis sycophantic court jester, the King sneaks into the cave and clobbers Weakchin\n\nfrom behind with a rock, whereupon Charlie the Tramp awakes on a park bench with a\n\ncop looming over him - it has all been a dream - the first of many dream sequences in\n\nChaplin's films.\n\nCast\n\nCharles Chaplin - Weakchin\n\nMack Swain - King Lowbrow\n\nGene Marsh - The King's Water Maiden\n\nPeggy Page - King's Second Wife\n\nFritz Schade - Cleo, Medicine Man\n\nCecile Arnold - Cavewoman\n\nVivian Edwards Cavewoman\n\nTed Edwards - Caveman\n\nGrover Ligon - Caveman\n\nThe Unknown Keystone\n\nIt's a Keystone, with Chaplin in street clothes, Mabel Normand at the switchboard, and an unidentified third person. It's not the Normand film \"Hello Mabel\" as was once suggested. There's a possibility that the stills come from a late 1913 production \"How Motion Pictures are Made\" which was shot during Chaplin's earliest days at Keystone. Below is a poster from that film:\n\nThat's all anyone can say about these stills, two of which appeared in Maurice Bessy's 1985 book \"Charlie Chaplin\". It is an ongoing subject of curiosity and research to Chaplinphiles.\n\nContinue to the Essanays\n\nBack Home\n\nMy thanks to Keystone scholars Steve Rydsewski, Bo Berglund, Brent Walker,\n\nRob Farr, Glenn Mitchell and Pierre Pageau, who offered suggestions,\n\nchanges and additions to the cast lists in the Keystone page of this filmography,"
