        "text": "Description\n\nIn 1914, Keystone Studios boss Mack Sennett, the “King of Comedy”, put his newest hire to work. Charles Chaplin made 36 pictures there during his first year on the screen: 35 shorts and a feature, Tillie’s Punctured Romance.\n\nHe started out as merely an actor, tasked with replacing the departing Ford Sterling, and he certainly did that. However, he took on other roles too, from building gags to writing scripts and, halfway through the year, directing his own films.\n\nHe learned as he went, picking up knowledge everywhere, but he taught as much as he learned, bringing his vaudeville training to the Hollywood screen and reinventing film comedy in the process. By the end of the year, Chaplin was a star.\n\nTo celebrate and reaffirm his unparalleled contribution to cinema, film critic Hal C F Astell of Apocalypse Later reviewed each of these 36 films in 2014 on the centennials of their original release dates. In doing so, he experienced them as audiences of the time experienced them, watching this new talent grow and mature.\n\nFrom early appearances like Kid Auto Races at Venice, Cal to his first classic, Dough and Dynamite, this book takes a fresh look at these Keystone pictures which had languished for years in poor quality prints.\n\nChaplin said that all he needed to make a comedy was “a park, a policeman and a pretty girl”. Here’s where he learned how to do it.\n\nFilms reviewed include the following:\n\nMaking a Living\n\nKid Auto Races at Venice, Cal\n\nMabel’s Strange Predicament\n\nA Thief Catcher\n\nBetween Showers\n\nA Film Johnnie\n\nTango Tangles\n\nHis Favorite Pastime\n\nCruel, Cruel Love\n\nThe Star Boarder\n\nMabel at the Wheel\n\nTwenty Minutes of Love\n\nCaught in a Cabaret\n\nCaught in the Rain\n\nA Busy Day\n\nThe Fatal Mallet\n\nHer Friend the Bandit\n\nThe Knockout\n\nMabel’s Busy Day\n\nMabel’s Married Life\n\nLaughing Gas\n\nThe Property Man\n\nThe Face on the Barroom Floor\n\nRecreation\n\nThe Masquerader\n\nHis New Profession\n\nThe Rounders\n\nThe New Janitor\n\nThose Love Pangs\n\nDough and Dynamite\n\nGentlemen of Nerve\n\nHis Musical Career\n\nHis Trysting Place\n\nGetting Acquainted\n\nHis Prehistoric Past\n\nTillie’s Punctured Romance\n\nSigned by Author"
