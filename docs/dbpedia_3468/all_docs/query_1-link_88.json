A one-reel comedy short, it was completed in three days at Keystone Studios in Los Angeles, California and was released for distribution on February 2, 1914. In it Chaplin portrays a charming swindler who runs afoul of a news reporter and a Keystone Cop.\n\nA Film Johnnie\n\nA young man falls in love with an actress he sees in a movie and goes to Keystone Studios to find her. However, his clumsiness ruins a film shoot and even starts a fire.\n\nMabel's Strange Predicament\n\nA drunk Tramp is trying to find his room at a hotel when he meets Mabel, who is locked out of her room; they eventually end up in the room of an old man with an extremely jealous wife who sees Mabel hiding under the bed.\n\nKid Auto Races at Venice\n\nA vagabond comes across a cart race for babies in Venice, California, and goes on to create chaos and confusion on and off the track.\n\nThe Fatal Mallet\n\nThree man will fight for the love of a charming girl. Charlie will play dirty, throwing bricks to his contender, and using a huge hammer to hurt one of them. But a precocious kid will be the fourth suitor in discord.\n\nCaught in the Rain\n\nWhen a married couple become separated in the park, Charlie takes up with the lady and is beat up when her husband rejoins her. He takes a room in their hotel, and she sleepwalks into his room so that when her husband returns from his walk he must go out again to look for her. Charlie returns the lady to her room but must climb out onto the window ledge in a downpour.\n\nCaught in a Cabaret\n\nCharlie is a clumsy waiter in a cheap cabaret and must endure the strict orders from his boss. He meets a pretty girl in the park and pretends to be a fancy ambassador but must contend with the jealousy of her fianc√©.\n\nMabel at the Wheel\n\nCharlie, competing with his rival's race car, offers Mabel a ride on his motorcycle but drops her in a puddle. He next joins some dubious characters in abduction of his rival just before the race for the Vanderbilt Cup. With her boyfriend locked up in a shed, Mabel takes his place. Charlie does what he can to sabotage the race, even causing Mabel's car to overturn."
