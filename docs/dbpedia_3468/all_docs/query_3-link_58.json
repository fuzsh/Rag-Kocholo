        "text": "“It was early 1952, I was seven years old, and silent screen legend Charlie Chaplin lived around the corner from my family in a big house on Summit Drive in Beverly Hills, California.” Those are the first words of a hugely interesting and fascinating essay Peter Ford (b. 1945), son of legendary screen actors and stars Eleanor Powell (1912-1982) and Glenn Ford (1916-2006)—all pictured above—once wrote when reminiscing about what happened to his beloved dog, a German shepherd named Bill, when he was a young boy.\n\nI had the pleasure of meeting Peter Ford on numerous occasions; we became friends, and I visited him regularly when I came over to the U.S. A wonderful family man with a wonderful family—I also remember and cherish our dinners at his home very dearly, enjoying the pleasure of his entire family—while during interview sessions at his home, we talked for hours about the careers of his parents in movies. His mother was Eleanor Powell, best remembered for her incredible tap dance numbers in some of MGM’s most prestigious musicals of the 1930s to the mid-1940s; she was undoubtedly the ‘Queen of Tap Dancing’ on the MGM lot and of her era—and beyond. In 1965, two decades after she virtually retired from acting to raise her son Peter, she was named the World’s Best Tap Dancer by the Dance Masters of America. Click here to see her dancing in one of her many highlights on the screen: from “Broadway Melody of 1940,” this is Ms. Powell and Fred Astaire’ dancing sequence (“Begin the Beguine”), also included in MGM’s astounding compilation feature, “That’s Entertainment” (1974). Watching Ms. Powell and Fred Astaire in this particular sequence—perfection was rarely this perfect.\n\nNext to his mother’s achievements on the screen, Peter Ford’s father, Glenn Ford, had a long and rewarding career as one of Hollywood’s most reliable and talented leading men. With an impressive career on the screen, beginning in the late 1930 to his final appearance in 1991, his numerous highlights include several screen classics. Just to name a few, there’s “Gilda” (1946), co-starring his favorite leading lady Rita Hayworth; Fritz Lang’s “The Big Heat” (1953); “Blackboard Jungle” (1955), about a teacher’s harrowing experiences in New York City’s school system (Mr. Ford played the teacher, Sidney Poitier in an early role played a troubled youth); and the film noir “Ransom!” (1956), remade four decades later by Ron Howard, with Mel Gibson in the Glenn Ford role.\n\nThe interview I did with Peter Ford appeared a number of years ago in a Flemish academic film journal called Cinemagie and will also be posted here in time to come. A few years ago, Mr. Ford wrote an in-depth biography on the life and career of his father, titled “Glenn Ford: A Life” (2011, published by The University Press of Wisconsin, with a foreword by film historian Patrick McGilligan). The recently deceased Debbie Reynolds once described Mr. Ford as ‘more than an accomplished and brilliant actor. He was a master at his craft: comedy, westerns, drama film noir—everything. I adored working with him.” Voilà, her knowledgeable comment sums it up pretty much.\n\nAs a Hollywood insider (click here for his personal website), Peter Ford wrote a few fascinating essays over the years, including about what it was like to grow up in Hollywood during the early 1950s, among neighbors such as David O. Selznick and Charlie Chaplin, in a turbulent era marked by the witch-hunt of the House Committee on Un-American Activities which eventually led to the Hollywood blacklist—with Mr. Chaplin as one of its victims.\n\nThe following essay ultimately deals with the death of his dog when Peter Ford was seven, but he puts everything in the right perspective, with a lot of background information and quite a bit of unknown Hollywood history—at times also anecdotical—to give the reader an accurate idea of what the situation in Hollywood was like in those days, and what his life as the young son of two legendary screen actors and stars was like. Here we go.\n\nA boy, his dog, and Charlie Chaplin\n\nIt was early in 1952, I was seven years old, and silent screen legend Charlie Chaplin lived around the corner from my family in a big house on Summit Drive in Beverly Hills, California. Mr. Chaplin had recently been under investigation by the FBI for suspected communist activities. He had also suffered under three trials for violations of the Mann Act for immoral conduct with teenage girls, and had felt the pressure of other charges of moral turpitude when he left the U.S. for England to attend the premiere of his latest film, “Limelight.” My first—and only close—encounter with the actor the world knew as the “little tramp” occurred one rainy winter night shortly before his departure for England, a departure that was to mark the beginning of his life-long exile from the United States. The encounter is etched keenly in my memory, partly because my parents convinced me that the tragedy that happened that night was directly connected to Chaplin’s exile from America. But I am getting ahead of my story.\n\nA New Adventure\n\nWhen the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HCUA) first convened in February 1947, the career of my father, actor Glenn Ford, was in its ascendancy. The previous year, he had starred in the film “Gilda” with a frequent visitor to our home in those days, Rita Hayworth. My mother, Eleanor Powell, had recently retired from a stellar career at MGM Studios when my parents decided to combine their resources to purchase what was to become our family’s first home—a 22-room “nest” on Cove Way in the heart of Beverly Hills.\n\nMy father had gotten his first big “break” when Bette Davis asked him to co-star with her in “A Stolen Life” at Warner Brothers, and it was there that dad met one of the pre-eminent Hollywood composers at the time, Max Steiner. He mentioned to dad that he wanted to sell his home. On the heels of scoring such classics as “Gone With the Wind” and “Casablanca,” Mr. Steiner was moving on to bigger “digs,” so dad and mom took the opportunity to buy his home and move the four of us onto the three acres of this incredible estate. We weren’t exactly the Beverly Hillbillies, but for a child moving to a house bigger than some hotels—with grounds to match—it was the beginning of quite an adventure. I mention the “four of us” because, in addition to my parents and me, there was another member of the family who shared our home: Bill, my beloved German shepherd. Sadly, Bill was to play a principal role in the drama that was to unfold between Charlie Chaplin and me.\n\nThe David O. Selznicks lived across the street from us in an even bigger house. Mary Pickford lived up the road in a still larger home on Summit Drive called ‘Pickfair.’ And at the bottom of our hill on Benedict Canyon was Harold Lloyd’s huge 22-acre estate aptly named ‘Greenacres.’ Our little ‘spread’ was modest by comparison, but this was the Hollywood I knew as a child.\n\nWhen the Selznicks stopped by to welcome us to the neighborhood, they offered to introduce my dad to another famous neighbour who lived in the big yellow house a few doors up—Charlie Chaplin. My father told Mr. Selznick that he already had the pleasure.\n\nMy father had first met Charlie Chaplin in 1943 when the first of Mr. Chaplin’s legal problems surfaced. I was told Mr. Chaplin had fled his forested palace in Beverly Hills and was in hiding to avoid being subpoenaed regarding his dalliance with a starlet by the name of Joan Barry. He took shelter in the West Angeles home of his friend, producer Eugene Frenke. Mr. Frenke’s wife was actress Anna Stern, who starred with my father in the 1941 film “So Ends Our Night.” In this film my father portrayed a refugee from Nazi oppression, fleeing through Europe to avoid persecution.\n\n“So Ends Our Night” was the first major film that my father made in his long career, and its subject matter kindled within him a patriotic fervor that continues to this day. Never in his life has wavered in expressing this point of view in his films or in his devotion to his country.\n\nOne day in 1943, dad was invited to stop by the Frenkes’ home for a drink after work, where he found Charlie Chaplin sequestered in the house along with his 17-year-old girlfriend, Oona O’Neill. Theirs was a relationship of which Oona’s father, playwright Eugene O’Neill, disapproved.\n\nBy the end of the visit, Mr. Chaplin had discussed with my father his plight in avoiding prosecution under the Mann Act for transporting a minor (Miss Barry) across state lines, his views on the ongoing war, Russia, and the ‘Second Front’ speech he had given in New York in 1942, among other subjects. It was an unusual encounter between my 27-year-old father and the older comic actor who was later to become our neighbor, and my father found that he held few views in common with Chaplin.\n\nThe House on the Hill\n\nFour years later, when we moved into the house on Cove Way, Oona O’Neill and Chaplin were married. Our neighborhood was a bustle of parties and excitement. Ronald Coleman, Joan Crawford, Errol Flynn, Lucille Ball, John Garfield, William Holden, and a host of others were regular guests at events up and down the hill during those halcyon days. Much later, I was to learn that things were not quite as innocent in Hollywood as they seemed.\n\nMr. Chaplin’s big yellow house on the hill looming above us certainly commanded our attention, but there was also gossip at the dinner table in our home about some unusual goings-on there. Hollywood in the late 1940s and early 1950s was a hotbed of politics, and it was almost unfashionable to be apolitical in those days. Our house was always full of activity, and all present were free to express their opinions. Even when I was young, my parents treated me as an adult and talked freely in my presence. I learned that our English neighbor, Charlie Chaplin, was a bit of an eccentric. This, of course, was not unusual in a town made famous by the eccentricities of its inhabitants, but there was more that caught the interest of this seven-year-old’s inquisitive mind.\n\nMy mother had renewed her friendship with the lady across the street, David O. Selznick’s wife Irene (the daughter of my mother’s mentor at MGM, Louis B. Mayer), who was no stranger to conservatism. Adolphe Menjou, Robert Taylor, and columnist Hedda Hopper were frequent visitors in our home. Through associations at his work in films at the time, my father often had visitors stop by the house who were of a different political persuasion, such as Edward G. Robinson, David Niven, and directors Fritz Lang and Orson Welles. For a child in his formative years, it was an opportunity to be exposed to a wide variety of ideologies.\n\nBut there was more that piqued my young mind, apart from the snippets I had gleaned from adult conversation. At night I heard haunting music coming from the yellow house up the road, and my neighborhood playmates said that Mr. Chaplin didn’t like children. They said he spied on his neighbors from a hidden telescope in the house, and the rumor among us impressionable youths was that Mr. Chaplin was a ‘secret agent from a foreign land.’\n\nTelevision was a new medium, and our family was one of the first in the neighborhood to get a television set. I soon discovered “Captain Video and His Video Rangers”—the rage among my friends at the time. I was a devotee of the program, and I took very seriously the program’s mandate that the safety of the Universe was dependent on the vigilance of the Video Rangers. I, of course, became a Video Ranger when I strapped on my decoder ring, one of the many products young fans of the program could acquire through the mail. I was prepared to conquer evil wherever I found it, and I believed Charlie Chaplin was the perfect place to start.\n\nIn my mind, Charlie Chaplin was the personification of the show’s villainous genius, “Dr. Pauli,” head of the Astroidal Society. After all, hadn’t Mr. Chaplin portrayed Adolf Hitler in “The Great Dictator”?\n\nAll of this fuelled my active imagination, and I convinced myself that I must investigate. However, if I were caught on the grounds of his home, there was a distinct possibility of being kidnapped, never to be seen again. Even if I were to take my homemade version of the “Chaplin’s Atomic Rifle” with me on my clandestine sorties, I could not be sure of success. Our neighbor was also well equipped to battle, but I was determined to venture where I was warned not to go—risking it all on scouting parties into the woods around Charlie Chaplin’s estate.\n\nHollywood Reds\n\nThose readers unfamiliar with the days of the Hollywood Ten and the HCUA’s investigation of the film industry in the 1940s and 50s may have been convinced by the major media’s revisionist myths that there was a no-holds-barred Red witch-hunt going on among actors, writers, directors, and producers. But in truth, the HCUA probe had uncovered undeniable evidence of the Communist Party’s subversive influence in Hollywood.\n\nIn the early 1920s, Will Hays was appointed head of the newly formed Motion Picture Producers and Distributors Association (MPPDA). It was Hays who established the moral clause in films, which was to become the anathema of civil libertarians and studio heads alike. In 1930, with the guidance of the Roman Catholic Church, Hays presented a ‘Production Code’ that banned some of the perceived immoralities in the films being produced in Hollywood. It was also in the early 1930s that the Legion of Decency was formed under the direction of Joseph Breen, West Coast representative of MPPDA. The Production Code Administration (PCA) was also created and Joe Breen became its director. Without the PCA’s approval, a film could not be exhibited in any legitimate movie theater in America. Overnight, Joseph Breen became one of the most powerful men in the film industry.\n\nFDR’s New Deal socialism, Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, and the pain of the Great Depression brought on turbulent times. For some, allegiance to the country conflicted with other commitments and was compromised or abandoned altogether. Ours was a nation in the midst of a crisis, and it was dramatically reflected in the arts.\n\nWhat started in June 1936 as the Anti-Nazi League—an anti-Hitler, pro-communist alliance—was transformed into something less acceptable to many people in the Hollywood community when in August 1939 Stalin and Hitler shocked Western Europe by signing a non-aggression treaty, a pact that Pravda announced as an ‘act of peace.’ A few days later the Nazis invaded Poland and eventually devastated much of Europe. Within a year, Stalin subjugated Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia and moved against Finland.\n\nDuring this time there were many communists and fellow travelers at work in Hollywood as writers, producers, directors, and actors—people whose sympathy went beyond cocktail party rhetoric and found its way into many of the films coming out of Hollywood. The Communist Party, USA (CPUSA) and its many front groups were being closely monitored by the FBI and other agencies who suspected disloyalty to the United States. In coordination with the FBI, the HCUA was trying to determine to what extent communist propaganda existed and who was responsible for it.\n\nWhen the Nazis attacked the USSR in June 1941, the vehement campaign to create a Second Front to defend Russia became a passion among the Hollywood elite. The brutality of Stalin against his own people was ignored, and defending the Russian motherland became the rage among the cocktail communists and Hollywood Reds. It was in this climate that the CPUSA held considerable influence in Hollywood.\n\nWhile it is true that Charlie Chaplin’s membership in the CPUSA was never absolutely documented, he nevertheless worked diligently to thwart the objectives of the HCUA, and there is considerable evidence that he was a ‘concealed communist.’ He was identified as such by the managing editor of the Daily Worker, Louis Budenz.\n\nIn 1922, a secret convention of the top U.S. communists and their Moscow handlers was being held at a farm near Bridgman, Michigan, when it was raided by local, state, and federal authorities. Captured along with the participants were numerous documents detailing the communist plans for subversion and revolution in America. One of those in attendance was Communist Party leader William Z. Foster. Shortly before the Bridgman convention, Foster had been in Los Angeles, where he was the guest of honor at a reception given by Chaplin.\n\nMany experts on communist tactics believe that Chaplin was not carried on the ordinary rolls, but was directly controlled by the Central Committee, without direct ties to the local Party organization in Hollywood.\n\nIn his films, speeches, associations, and personal life Chaplin certainly fit the profile of a ‘Party’ man. As Kenneth S. Lynn points out in his brilliant book, “Charlie Chaplin and His Times,” on December 3rd, 1942 in a speech in New York sponsored by the Arts to Russia committee of Russian War Relief, Chaplin “told seven hundred guests that the American people were finally beginning to understand the Russian purges, and what a wonderful thing they were.” This was the beginning of the end of America’s love affair with Chaplin. Ten years later, he left the U.S. in exile and eventually moved to Switzerland to live out his last days, dying in 1977.\n\nTragic Encounter\n\nIt was the winter before Chaplin’s departure from his big house on the hill that Bill, my German shepherd, and I were to play a dramatic part in Mr. Chaplin’s life.\n\nIt was late at night and raining. I was seven years old and asleep in my bed when I was awakened by the ringing of our doorbell. As a curious young lad, I was not about to remain in bed when someone was at our door at such a late hour, especially when I heard voices of consternation. I recognized my parents’ voices, but there was someone else. As it turned out, the other person was Charlie Chaplin. He explained to my parents that there had been an accident—he had hit and killed my dog Bill with his car. I rushed downstairs and saw Bill on the front steps just beyond the open front door. To his credit, Chaplin had carried Bill’s lifeless body through the rain to deposit it on our front doorstep. Chaplin dutifully reported the sad news to my parents.\n\nI was grief-stricken and would not be consoled. I had never met our neighbor before, but I had seen him walking at times alone late at night in the neighborhood. Additionally, my father kept chickens on a part of our property, and it was my job not only to care for them but to gather the eggs they laid. My father had made arrangements to sell eggs to Charlie and other neighbors. Chaplin had benefited from my labor, I thought, and the thanks I received was that he had killed my best friend, Bill. I would not rest until my parents could explain how someone could take the life of my dog and not be punished. Charlie Chaplin was, indeed, the incarnation of the nefarious Dr. Pauli!\n\nAt my door that night was the last time I saw Mr. Chaplin. I was intent on retribution for his crime, heightened, no doubt, by all the gossip the neighborhood children had been spreading about him. I’m sure his reputation was not enhanced by what I had heard about him at home, and I was convinced that I was extremely lucky not to have been discovered by him lurking in the woods by his house.\n\nAll summer, I anguished over what had happened to my dog. In September, I suppose, my parents read in the paper that as Charlie Chaplin was traveling to England, he was told that he would be denied re-entry into the United States. However, that is not what they told me. I learned from them the real reason Chaplin was not allowed to come back to his house on Summit Drive, and it had nothing to do with his tax problems, his violations of the Mann Act, the paternity suit involving Joan Barry, the charges of moral turpitude, or his affiliations with the Communist Party.\n\nNo, these were not the reasons Charlie Chaplin was exiled for the rest of his life from the United States. I was finally placated when my parents, in their loving attempt to protect their son’s feelings and assuage his sorrow, told me that Mr. Chaplin would not be coming back to the neighborhood because he had killed my dog, Bill. Justice, I thought, had finally been wrought.\n\n1. THE FILMS OF ELEANOR POWELL\n\nQUEEN HIGH (1930) DIR Fred C.
