Chaplin became hugely successful as the director and star of silent comedies such as The Kid, The Gold Rush and Modern Times before transitioning into "talkies", most notably with the satirical The Great Dictator and Limelight, which he appeared in opposite his comic rival Buster Keaton.

Chaplin passed away in 1977.
