“Caught in the Rain” May 1914, some have suggested this was not the first film Charlie Chaplin directed but:

According to author James L. Neibaur “Early Charlie Chaplin the Artist As Apprentice at Keystone Studios” - according to existing records this was inf act the first film Charlie directed and had full control of.

I source James Neibaur quite frequently, I find it an invaluable source on his Keystone Days, it is also an easy read. Sourcing of unusual material or photos (outside of the most commonly seen ones of which there are many) for me is really important and a sign of respect. Now I will get off my soap box :)
