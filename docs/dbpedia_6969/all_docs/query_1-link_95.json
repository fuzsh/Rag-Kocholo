        "text": "Note: Contains spoilers for Mary Poppins Returns\n\nIt might have taken 54 years for Mary Poppins Returns to arrive after the iconic original, but we have a feeling that a third movie won't take as long.\n\nWith Oscar buzz and positive first reviews, the Disney sequel has proven to be a huge hit over the Christmas period, especially as it's not had a Star Wars movie to bother it, so it's no surprise that a follow-up is already in development.\n\n\"It is early stages but I will say right now that there were eight books, so thereâ€™s a lot of great material still to mine. Thatâ€™s what we worked from, those incredible eight books of PL Travers. So, you know...,\" he revealed in early January.\n\nDisney hasn't officially announced Mary Poppins 3 yet, but it only feels like a matter of time, so what could we expect from the magical nanny's return?\n\nMary Poppins 3 cast: Who would come back?\n\nMary Poppins Returns isn't Avengers: Infinity War, so there aren't any major deaths to traumatise the little ones in the audience.\n\nIt was a tough enough task to replace Julie Andrews and we doubt Disney would want to go through that again, meaning Emily Blunt would return as Mary Poppins â€“ and she seems up for it.\n\n\"Yes, I would! I want to be her again. I like being her,\" she told CBS News, adding to Yahoo! Movies that she'd call the threequel Mary Poppins Returns Again or \"Mary Poppins, Please God, Come Back Again, now we really need her!\".\n\nThe threequel will also likely bring back Lin-Manuel Miranda as Jack the Lamplighter, as well as Ben Whishaw and Emily Mortimer as the grown-up Banks children Michael and Jane.\n\nMeryl Streep could also return as Mary's second cousin Topsy, alongside Colin Firth as Fidelity Fiduciary Bank chairman William 'Weatherall' Wilkins and Julie Walters as the Banks' housekeeper Ellen.\n\nAnd of course, we would never say no to more Dick Van Dyke as Mr Dawes Jr, Angela Lansbury as The Balloon Lady and David Warner as Admiral Boom.\n\nMary Poppins 3 plot: How does the sequel set it up?\n\nAs in the first movie, Mary Poppins leaves without saying goodbye at the end of the sequel having fixed the Banks family's troubles.\n\nMichael saves his home from being repossessed by the bank (thanks to the tuppence his father invested in the bank), while Jane looks to have sparked up a romance with Jack that could continue in a third movie.\n\nEven though there were 54 years between the movies, the sequel picks up only around two decades after the first. We can't rule out a similar timejump and Whishaw has a slightly \"darker\" story idea for the third one along those lines.\n\n\"The next one would have to be us, in an old retirement home and Jane and Michael Banks are terrible, incontinent old people,\" he told Yahoo! Movies.\n\nMortimer added: \"But we need [Mary] just as much as old-age pensioners as we ever did as middle-aged people or young people. I mean, really, more than ever! When youâ€™re about to die, you need a dose of Mary Poppins.\"\n\nBoth movies have taken inspiration from the original eight Mary Poppins novels by PL Travers and sequel director Rob Marshall believes there's still plenty to use.\n\n\"The first film, the majority of it is the first book. They used little pieces of the other ones. But not that much. We actually picked up from the second book. Which is called Mary Poppins Comes Back. Then worked from others like Mary Poppins Opens the Door, Mary Poppins in the Park,\" he told Metro US.\n\n\"We worked from those and basically cherry-picked the adventures that we could musicalise. What is interesting is that her books are very episodic. There's no real narrative. There's no narrative to any of them. So we found the adventures and characters we thought would be interesting to work from. Then created a completely original storyline.\"\n\nMary Poppins 3 release date: When could we expect it?\n\nThe sequel was first announced in September 2015 with filming taking place in 2017, meaning it took three years for Mary Poppins Returns to finally reach cinemas on December 19, 2018.\n\nIf we look at a similar timescale for the third movie, then if Disney announces it soon, the earliest we could expect it would be 2021, probably around Christmas time again.\n\nHowever, with the cast established, the pre-production phase might not take as long, so there's a chance that we could be looking at 2020. Rob Marshall certainly seems keen to return as director, but he is hedging his bets at the moment.\n\n\"It all depends on how we do. Of course, knock on wood, we do well and it does well. This has been a three-year project. But we shall see. There's still a lot of great material. She is so inventive. It is like James Bond. It is just a great character that you want to revisit again and again and again,\" he told Metro US.\n\nAnd Blunt definitely wants to work with Marshall again. \"Oh, I would pay Rob to do it again with me. Yeah, I would. Definitely. More stories left to tell,\" she told Vogue.\n\nMary Poppins 3 trailer: It'll be a while yet\n\nOf course, with no third movie officially confirmed, you can't expect a trailer for a movie that doesn't exist.\n\nFortunately, there's plenty of Mary Poppins Returns clips to tide you over instead."
