        "text": "With the release of Mary Poppins Returns this month, fans have been getting nostalgic about the original movie.\n\nEmily Blunt stars as the titular character in Disney’s new adaptation, and some are trying to remember who played Ms Poppins in the original and when it was released.\n\nThe new movie is set two decades after the original, with children Jane and Michael all grown up and played by different actors.\n\nHowever, in reality, there is a 54-year gap between the two movies, with the original being released on 17 December 1964.\n\nThe new film features a nearly entirely new cast, although two stars of the original movie are back.\n\nDick Van Dyke, who played Bert – as well as Mr. Dawes Senior under the acronym Navckid Keyd – is in the new film, appearing as Mr. Dawes Jr.\n\nAnd Karen Dotrice, who played the young Jane Banks in the original, has a small cameo in the new film, credited as an ‘Elegant Woman’.\n\nThe new film also has Richard M. Sherman on board for music and Tony Walton for production design. Both worked on the classic film.\n\nMary Poppins was originally played by Julie Andrews and although it would have been possible for her to make a cameo, like Dick and Karen, she turned it down.\n\nWho else was in the cast of the original movie?\n\nMary Poppins – Julie Andrews\n\nBert / Mr Dawes Senior – Dick Van Dyke / Navckid Keyd)\n\nMr George W. Banks – David Tomlinson\n\nMrs Winnifred Banks – Glynis Johns\n\nEllen the Maid – Hermione Baddeley\n\nMrs Brill the Cook – Reta Shaw\n\nJane Banks – Karen Dotrcie\n\nMicahel Banks – Matthew Garber\n\nThe Constable – Arthur Treacher\n\nUncle Albert – Ed Wynn\n\nThe Bird Woman – Jane Darwell\n\nSpeaking to Variety about the possibility of including 83-year-old Andrews, director Rob Marshall recalled why she declined.\n\n‘She immediately said no,’ Marshall revealed. ‘She said, “This is Emily’s show and I want her to run with this. She should run with this. This is hers. I don’t want to be on top of that.”’\n\nAlthough he didn’t have a specific role in mind for her, sources told Variety she may have played the balloon lady. That role, of course, went to Angela Lansbury.\n\nSaying that, there seems to be a bit of disagreement about Andrews’ possible involvement, and La La Land producer Marc Platt told Variety at the movie’s premiere on Thursday that the actress ‘wasn’t supposed to be in it at all’.\n\nHe added: ‘She’s a friend of Rob’s and a friend of ours and a big fan of Emily Blunt and has been lovely since day one about how this is Emily’s turn and how happy she is for her. And it’s Emily’s turn.’\n\nWhen is the Mary Poppins Returns release date?\n\nMary Poppins Returns is out in UK cinemas on 21 December 2018.\n\nWhat about a trailer?\n\nFill your boots:\n\nWhat is Mary Poppins Returns about?\n\nSet two decades after the original, in the new story, our beloved Michael (played by Ben Whishaw) and Jane (Emily Montimer) are all grown up with children of their own, and after Michael suffers a personal loss, Mary Poppins re-enters their lives.\n\nShe helps the children, who are played by Pixie Davies, Nathanael Saleh and Joel Dawson, rediscover the joy and wonder that is missing in their lives.\n\nWith up-to-date CGI wizardry and new songs, this new film has a lot to live up to but it looks like there’s going to be plenty of the original charm and imagination, as Mary takes the children to far away lands, ‘filling their heads with stuff and nonsense’, and reminding us all what it’s like to be a child.\n\nWho else stars in Mary Poppins Returns?\n\nBlunt will be supported by Lin Manuel-Miranda as Jack, Meryl Streep as Poppin’s eccentric cousin Topsy, Colin Firth as banker William Weatherall Wilkins, and Julie Walters as the Banks housekeeper.\n\nMary Poppins – Emily Blunt\n\nMichael – Ben Whishaw\n\nJane – Emily Mortimer\n\nTopsy (Poppins’ eccentric cousin) – Meryl Streep\n\nBanker William Weatherall Wilkins – Colin Firth\n\nBanks’ housekeeper – Julie Walters\n\nStreet lamplighter – Lin-Manuel Miranda\n\nWhat has the initial reception been like?\n\nLuckily, it seems there is no need to worry about the sequel living up to the hype as the film has screened for the first time to ‘lengthy applause’ and a standing ovation at a later screening where the director, Rob Marshall, was attending a question and answer session.\n\nThe film has been described as a ‘salve’ for these times we live in, while Emily Blunt may just land herself in the awards race – despite an already crowded field for best actress – and Disney have already decided to submit two songs to the Academy for consideration in the best original song category, Trip A Little Light Fantastic and The Place Where Lost Things Go.\n\n‘It’s a very complicated time we’re living in,’ Marc Platt, one of the film’s producers, said at the Producer’s Guild Award event, adding that it is ‘so valuable to export this [film] to the world at this moment in time, when we wish for more optimism and hope, which we all had as kids.’\n\nMary Poppins Returns hits cinemas on Friday 21 December."
