        "text": "The Novels Written By Robert Louis Stevenson Have Captivated The Imaginations Of Young And Old Alike Ever Since They Were First Written\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson has written many works of literature and poetry which have become part and parcel to our culture. Although I have always loved Stevenson’s poetry—The Land of Counterpane is definitely one of my favorite poems—I was delightfully surprised when I was teaching one of my little sisters 1st grade that the poem that they used for their first prose memorization was Robert Louis Stevenson's At The Seaside.\n\nNeedless to say, these poems have a pleasant rhythm that make them very easy to memorize and remember years down the road. Other favorite poems include My Shadow and The Land of Storybooks. A Child's Garden of Verses contains many of his poems, most of which relate to childish hopes, dreams and fears.\n\nAnd what young boy hasn't read Treasure Island? In this novel, readers are taken to a mysterious island where a famous pirate is said to have buried an immense treasure and murdered all of the mates that helped him bury it.\n\nOne map is passed off to the next captain when the pirate dies. The other mates dupe a few gentlemen into financing the treasure hunt and they bring along a young boy who suddenly finds himself embroiled in pirate treachery far from English shores.\n\nSeveral movie adaptations have been made from this novel, our two favorite being the 1950 Disney version and the 1990 version with Charlton Heston starring as the slightly likable pirate, Long John Silver.\n\nIn the book Kidnapped, Robert Louis Stevenson sweeps the reader to Scotland in 1751, six years after the Jacobite uprising. This adventure novel tells the story of David Balfour who travels through the lowlands as well as the highlands of Scotland with the outlaw to the crown, Alan Breck Stewart. Although the two have nothing in common they manage to build a unique friendship and end up sticking together through thick and thin.\n\nThe Most Endearing Robert Louis Stevenson Poem Of All Time, The Land of Counterpane\n\nWhen I was sick and lay a-bed,\n\nI had two pillows at my head,\n\nAnd all my toys beside me lay\n\nTo keep me happy all the day.\n\nAnd sometimes for an hour or so\n\nI watched my leaden soldiers go,\n\nWith different uniforms and drills,\n\nAmong the bed-clothes, through the hills;\n\nAnd sometimes sent my ships in fleets\n\nAll up and down among the sheets;\n\nOr brought my trees and houses out,\n\nAnd planted cities all about.\n\nI was the giant great and still\n\nThat sits upon the pillow-hill,\n\nAnd sees before him, dale and plain,\n\nThe pleasant land of counterpane.\n\n2. One Of The Best Fiction Books Set In Scotland Is Kidnapped: The Story About The Unique Friendship Between The Naïve Lowlander And The Experienced Highlander\n\nKidnapped is one of our favorite books about Scotland (besides Outlaws of Ravenhurst, of course). This story takes place in the lowlands and highlands of Scotland. The Jacobite Uprising has just settled down in 1751, with Scotsmen separating themselves into two groups.\n\nJacobites live as Scotsmen loyal to their “Bonnie Prince Charlie” who is living in France. The highlanders seem to have their own laws and follow their chieftains instead of the British government.\n\nIn the lowlands, the Whigs are loyal to the English king. The reader also gets a glimpse of the solitary islands and the wild and dangerous Scottish sea.\n\nThis adventurous epic introduces the reader to many characters while covering a large setting. In this adventure setting Robert Louis Stevenson introduces young David Balfour of Shaws and the doughty outlaw, Alan Breck Stewart.\n\nDavid is a young man whose parents have recently died. He is, being a lowlander, a Protestant Whig. After the death of his father, David finds out that he is a man of rich descent and entitled to a large estate called Shaws. He is determined to go and claim it.\n\nIt turns out that David has a misery uncle who is the custodian of Shaws. His uncle, Ebenezer Balfour, is not going to give David the estate easily and nothing would make him happier than to be rid of David altogether. He pays to have David kidnapped and taken to the Carolinas to be sold as a slave.\n\nAfter being kidnapped by his selfish uncle, David finds himself getting farther and farther away from his goal and homeland. Working as a cabin boy for the captain of the ship the Covenant bound for America, David is not the only one who is in danger.\n\nAlan Breck Stewart is a Highland Jacobite. He has many sharp skills such as sword fighting, piping, singing and finding his way in the mountains while dodging red coats.\n\nHe has fought in France and returns to Scotland a hunted man. His duty to his clan is to carry the rent from his chieftain to Bonnie Prince Charlie.\n\nAlthough he has many good traits, Alan is quite vain and gets easily offended.\n\nBeing the only survivor of a small boat run over by The Covenant, Alan Breck Stewart finds himself with rough men who are ready to murder anyone for the sum of money he has on him.\n\nAboard this craft he meets David, and together they decide to help each other out of their mutual and imminent danger. The two suffer shipwreck, are separated and find each other again in an unhappy circumstance: only seconds after the murder of Collin Roy Campbell.\n\nDavid Is Not The Only One In Danger.\n\nThe chance of them both being there for the murder causes them to both be suspects, and Alan and David must “take to the heather.” Dodging red coats and using secret hiding places, Alan and David finally make it to safety in the lowlands.\n\nIn this novel, Robert Louis Stevenson uses the characters to teach the reader loyalty, courage, forgiveness of enemies and friendship. Although David and Alan have many differences they stay loyal to their political parties. The book also portrays that even though you are at the losing end of an argument, it is good to stick to your principles.\n\nThe highlanders show a courageous spirit as they face hardships. In the book, David's initial reaction is to get even with his uncle, but in the end he forgives Ebenezer all his wrongs. At one point David says to Alan, “Opinion here or opinion there, it’s a kent (known) thing all Christianity forbids revenge.”\n\nIt's A Story About Loyalty, Courage, Forgiveness And Friendship\n\nDavid and Alan build a strong and unique friendship that never wavers despite their many differences. Loyalty, courage, forgiveness and friendship linger in the reader’s mind and help inspire him to develop these traits in his own life.\n\nI personally liked this book because I am of Scottish decent, and I learned a lot about the Jacobite Uprising of 1745 through this novel. It also made me curious as to whether my family were Whigs or highlanders. I am proud to say they were highlanders.\n\n5. Can't Get Enough Of Scottish Poetry?
