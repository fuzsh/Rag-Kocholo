        "text": "Mary Poppins is the best. Fight me.\n\nJust below an assortment of films with Star Wars and The Godfather in their titles, Mary Poppins has been in my top 5 films of all time for as long as I can remember having a list.\n\nIronically, it wasn't a childhood favorite. While I grew up inundated with Disney films, the story of the magical nanny didn't really register until I was an adult– and understood the incredible adult themes of this magnum opus of Walt Disney's that he worked so hard to bring to screen.\n\nIn his final days on earth, dying a painful death of lung cancer, desperately trying to get The Jungle Book finished, and casting a new series of live action films about a young man named Dexter Riley starting with The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes, Walt would call Richard and Bob Sherman to his office and have them play Feed The Birds.\n\nWhy? What was it about that song that made it the thing on Disney's mind as he faced the end of his mortal existence?\n\nWe'll get there. I've divided this into several pieces:\n\n1- Why all your other favorite movie musicals suck\n\n2- Feminism and A Jolly Holiday With You, Bert (vs. Baby It's Cold Outside)\n\n3- Feed the Birds vs. Fidelity Fiduciary Bank\n\n4- Go Fly a Kite\n\n1- Why all your other favorite movie musicals suck\n\nLet's start at the very beginning, a very good place to start. Sorry, wrong Julie Andrews musical.\n\nI've had this argument with numerous other cinephile friends, and they're always incredulous. Mary Poppins? What about Singing in the Rain, West Side Story, The Sound of Music, or Grease? Ok, first, Grease and West Side Story can suck it. They're terrible and they've always been terrible.\n\nThe Sound of Music… there's an argument there because Julie Andrews. And her presence in both films really put them both up there, but it's precisely because what she does in both films is so great, that they shine. But Maria Von Trapp is a far less complex character than Mary Poppins. The songs are of lesser quality, and despite having a backdrop of being anti-Nazi that is now (surprisingly) socially relevant again, the film's message is less stirring than Poppins'.\n\nAnd then there's Singing in the Rain, which most groups like AFI will rate higher on their lists of classic films. So, yes, that's no slouch. But at it's core, it's a sort of basic movie. Hollywood has always been in love with a movie about making movies. And when you break it down, the film is merely an excuse to let Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor perform their respective schticks on a grand stage. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Indeed, it makes a close second because it is truly great.\n\nAnd close to or tied with that is The Wizard of Oz, the only other film that works on multiple levels and which has aged as well as Poppins has. It's also the only other musical that competes with Poppins on its music. But Dorothy's journey is still just about a girl trying to find her way home and the new friends she finds on the way.\n\nBut Mary Poppins is about so much more– charity, materialism, and most importantly– family. Singing in the Rain has never made me cry. Mary Poppins gets me. . . every time.\n\n2- Feminism and A Jolly Holiday With You, Bert (vs. Baby It's Cold Outside)\n\nMary Poppins is a feminist masterpiece. From an explicit subplot about Mrs. Banks being a suffragette, this is pretty surface-level clear. (\"No more the meek and mild subservients we! We're fighting for our rights, militantly! Never you fear!\") Mary is also here to smash the patriarchy of Mr. Banks, but we'll get to that.\n\nMary as a character is also a powerful, magical woman with agency of her own. She comes and goes as she pleases, even under the guise of giving \"the man of the house\" Mr. Banks what \"he\" wants. In fact, she's always in control of every situation she's in, and she is the inciter of every action in the film.\n\nEven better, she has a sense of whimsy about all of it. When the children try to tell their parents about how they jumped into a sidewalk chalk painting and went fox hunting, she pretends like none of it happened, and is even a bit faux-offended, as though she would never do such a thing!\n\nShe gives the children medicine to make sure they don't a cold, but it's magic– not just a spoonful of sugar, but it actually tastes like something you, the person drinking it, like. When she takes some herself, it's telling that she identifies the flavor as \"rum punch.\" Mary Poppins is on the sauce. And she hiccups after taking it. More like a shot than a spoonful, Mary. We see what you're doing. And we approve.\n\nShe is nurturing and unfailingly kind. But she is also strong, in charge, and no nonsense. She gets @#$% done.\n\nWhat sort of job was Katie Nana doing that the children's' nursery was so messy? Mary Poppins shows up, and within minutes, has the kids doing the work, by using the old trick that singing a song while you do it makes it seem not so bad.\n\nMary Poppins was the first female superhero. She was a Hogwarts graduate before JK Rowling was even born. (And she was definitely a Ravenclaw. I will also fight people on this point.)\n\nYou can also make the case that Mary Poppins was explicitly asexual, which would make this a major victory for representation as far back as 1964 for the Ace community. One thing author P.L. Travers was adamant about was that there was absolutely no romantic interaction between Mary and Bert. They were friends only. Mary did not have romantic partners.\n\nSo along comes the song \"Jolly Holiday,\" specifically in its third verse when Mary turns the tables and starts singing to Bert the chimney-sweep. This song has been on my mind as a perfect counterpoint to the inane annual \"debate\" over the song \"Baby It's Cold Outside.\" He's been singing to her about when you hold Mary's hand, you feel so grand, your heart starts beating like a big brass band. He's interested. But Mary's going to tell him how it is. First, let him know how awesome he is.\n\n\"Oh it's a jolly holiday with you, Bert.\n\nGentlemen like you are few.\n\nThough you're just a diamond in the rough, Bert\n\nUnderneath your blood is blue.\"\n\n3- Feed the Birds vs. Fidelity Fiduciary Bank\n\nThe moral fulcrum upon which the film rests is, Walt's favorite, \"Feed the Birds.\" Why this song?\n\nMary has a plan. Only a few days into her work at the Banks household on 17 Cherry Tree Lane, she demands a day off, and gets Mr. Banks to agree to take the children to the bank with him– and makes him think it was his idea. (Wow– what kind of magic is this she's pulling. Imagine doing this with your boss!)\n\nIn talking to the children about the outing, she gives them tuppence, or the equivalent of about 4 cents in 2018 US dollars. She sings to them about a woman who sits on the steps of St. Paul's Cathedral asking people to feed the birds for tuppence a bag."
