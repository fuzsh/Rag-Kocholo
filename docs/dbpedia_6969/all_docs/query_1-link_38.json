        "text": "Many of you will remember growing up with the music and all-around magic of the original Mary Poppins film.\n\nThe 1964 musical was one of Disney's highest-grossing films at the time and was nominated for 13 Academy Awards.\n\nIt featured stars such as Dame Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke who are now the stuff of Hollywood legend, along with iconic songs (Super-cali-fragil-istic-expi-ali-docious anyone?).\n\nREAD MORE: I'm A Celebrity: Richard Madeley on show 'moaners' and missing 35th wedding anniversary to go into castle\n\nIf you want to take a walk down memory lane, you can watch the film on BBC1 this Saturday at 4.20pm.\n\nAnd in case you're wondering what has since happened to the star-studded cast, we created a round-up of where the original stars of Mary Poppins are now.\n\nJulie Andrews\n\nOf course, Dame Julie Andrews played the starring role of the film as Mary Poppins herself - the magical nanny who can fly using her umbrella.\n\nSince Mary Poppins, the actress has starred in a number of films over nine decades including The Sound of Music (1965), The Princess Diaries (2001), and Shrek (2001).\n\nAndrews was married to set designer Tony Walton until their divorce in 1968, and then director Blake Edwards until his death in 2010.\n\nShe has five children from her two marriages, along with nine grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.\n\nIn 2019, she opened up about having major surgery to remove a cyst on her vocal cord in 1997, which permanently damaged her singing voice.\n\nMore recently, she voiced the narrator of Netflix's smash hit drama Bridgerton last year.\n\nDick Van Dyke\n\nDick Van Dyke played Bert, the close friend of Mary Poppins and a jack-of-all-trades.\n\nThe actor is now 95 years old and had a long career spanning seven decades.\n\nSince Mary Poppins, he went on to star in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968), Night at the Museum (2006), and even starred in the 2018 sequel, Mary Poppins Returns.\n\nIn 2012, Dick Van Dyke married professional makeup artist Arlene Silver, 49.\n\nThe star can still be seen singing and dancing on social media, regularly posting on his Instagram account.\n\nDavid Tomlinson\n\nDavid Tomlinson played Mary Poppins' employer, George Banks.\n\nThe Disney legend was born in Oxfordshire in 1917 and died in 2000, at the age of 83.\n\nAfter Mary Poppins, the actor played Emelius Browne in Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971), and Peter Thorndyke in The Love Bug (1968).\n\nHe later appeared on radio and TV in the 1970s and 1980s to promote autism charities but retired at 63 to spend more time with his family.\n\nTomlinson was married twice, and remained with actress Audrey Freeman until his death.\n\nThe actor passed away in his sleep in a hospital in Westminster after suffering a stroke.\n\nGlynis Johns\n\nGlynis Johns played George's wife, Winifred Banks and mother to Jane and Michael.\n\nThe actress is now 98, making her one of the last surviving stars of the Golden Age of Hollywood.\n\nBorn in South Africa in 1923, Glynis Johns began acting in the 1930s and played the lead role in Miranda (1948).\n\nShe went on to star in The Court Jester (1955), The Sundowners (1960), and While You Were Sleeping (1995).\n\nThe star last appeared in the 1995 film Superstar, playing the grandmother of Molly Shannon's character.\n\nThe actress has been married four times and had one child, who died in 2007.\n\nHermione Baddeley\n\nHermione Youlanda Ruby Clinton-Baddeley played Ellen, the Banks family's maid.\n\nThe actress was born in 1906 in Shropshire, and died in 1986.\n\nShe starred in a number of films over decades including Brighton Rock (1948), The Belles of St. Trinian's (1954), and Maude (1972).\n\nAfter starring in Room at the Top (1959), she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nHer last film appearance was in the American animated film The Secret of NIMH (1982), playing Auntie Shrew.\n\nThe actress was married and divorced twice, including to British aristocrat David Tennant in 1928.\n\nShe had two children from her first marriage and died in Los Angeles at the age of 79 after a series of strokes.\n\nKaren Dotrice\n\nKaren Dotrice played the Banks' daughter, Jane.\n\nThe British actress was born in 1955 in Guernsey and is now 66.\n\nShe is also known for starring in the Disney films The Three Lives of Thomasina (1963) and The Gnome Mobile (1967).\n\nBut she retired from acting in 1984 to spend more time with her family. She has been married twice and has three children.\n\nIn 2004, the actress was named a 'Disney Legend', which recognises people who have made an \"extraordinary\" contribution to the company.\n\nDotrice went on to make a cameo in the 2018 sequel Mary Poppins Returns.\n\nIn 2020, she starred in an episode of the Disney documentary series Prop Culture which looked at the original Mary Poppins.\n\nMatthew Garber\n\nMatthew Garber played Jane's younger brother, Michael Banks.\n\nThe British actor was born in London in 1956 but tragically died in 1977 from pancreatitis at the age of 21.\n\nDuring his short career, the child star appeared alongside co-star Karen Dotrice in The Three Lives of Thomasina (1963) and The Gnome-Mobile (1967).\n\nGarber later contracted hepatitis which damaged his pancreas, and he died in a hospital in Hampstead.\n\nIn 2004, the actor was named a Disney Legend posthumously, and his brother accepted the award on his behalf.\n\nEd Wynn\n\nThe American actor was known for playing Uncle Albert, whose laughter causes him to float in the air.\n\nHe was born in 1886 in Philadelphia and starred in a number of films including Alice in Wonderland (1951), The Gnome-Mobile (1967), and The Twilight Zone series (1963).\n\nThe actor died of oesophagal cancer in Beverly Hills in 1966 at the age of 79.\n\nThe actor's distinct voice has given him an interesting legacy, inspiring many other actors to emulate it when playing certain characters.\n\nIt is believed his voice was used as an inspiration for the character King Candy in the animated film Wreck-it Ralph (2012), by actor Alan Tudyk.\n\nIt is also thought his voice inspired Mr Scatterbrain in The Mr Men Show.\n\nIn 2013, the star was posthumously named a Disney Legend.\n\nJane Darwell\n\nJane Darwell played the famous 'Bird Woman' who sold breadcrumbs for pigeons.\n\nThe American actress was born in 1879 in Missouri and appeared in over 170 films.\n\nMost notably, she starred in The Grapes of Wrath (1940) and won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress after playing Ma Joad.\n\nThe actress also made an appearance in 1939 classic Gone with the Wind, playing Mrs Merriwether, and Huckleberry Finn (1931).\n\nIn 1960, she was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and spent her last years semi-retired.\n\nDarwell died in California in 1967 at the age of 87 from a myocardial infection."
