        "text": "Jane Banks actor Karen Dotrice starred in her first film at age 8, Disney's 1963 movie The Three Lives of Thomasina. Impressed with her performance, the studio invited her back for Mary Poppins. The role required singing, however, and Dotrice signed up for lessons at the Royal Shakespeare Company. Her vocal coach instructed her in the style of an operetta singer, and they practiced \"The Perfect Nanny\" together. But when it came time to sing the song during filming, the crew had a less than positive response.\n\nThey \"pissed themselves laughing\" at her choice of singing style, causing Dotrice to burst into tears and Julie Andrews to step in to help. Andrews spent her next day off re-training Dotrice to sing in her natural voice, which was better suited to the lighthearted musical.\n\nReal life experiences also inspired \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,\" as Richard Sherman claimed it came from him and his brother's experiences making up words at summer camp. Years later, they remembered it while trying to think of a nonsense word Mary Poppins could use. They changed the syllables slightly to make it easier to rhyme, and the song became a standout in the film.\n\nBut then, the Sherman brothers found themselves in the middle of a copyright infringement lawsuit as two other songwriters claimed they wrote the similar \"Supercalafajalistickespeealadojus\" as far back as 1949 and sent their song to Disney Studios in the early 1950s. A judge eventually threw the case out, citing the phrase's origin as predating both songs. And several years later, a librarian working for Disney discovered the word \"supercaliflawjalisticexpialadoshus\" written in a newspaper clipping from 1931, proving neither group of songwriters invented it.\n\nAlthough the part of the bird woman was small with only a single line, it was essential to the film's heart. Walt Disney asked veteran actor Jane Darwell to play it, knowing she could bring humanity and warmth to the scene. Darwell was 83 years old at the time and had retired from acting after a long career that included an Oscar for playing Ma Joad in The Grapes of Wrath. Because she suffered from heart problems, it took a lot of convincing by Disney to get her to agree.\n\nDisney promised her filming would only take a day and offered a limo to take her to and from the studio. To make her more comfortable, the crew cut a hole in the stairs of the set so she could sit on a pillow. Mary Poppins was Darwell's final film, and she passed a few years after its release.\n\nDisney considered a number of actors to play Mary Poppins, including Angela Lansbury, Bette Davis, and Mary Martin. At the time, Julie Andrews had never appeared in a film and was starring in Camelot on Broadway. A few Disney employees happened to be in the audience of the Ed Sullivan Show when she appeared along with Richard Burton to perform a number from the musical and realized she would be perfect.\n\nWalt Disney himself flew to New York to see a performance and immediately went backstage to offer Andrews the role. He even promised her husband a job as a costume designer for the film. Andrews signed on, partly because she had been turned down for the film version of My Fair Lady; a role which she had previously played on Broadway to rave reviews. When she beat her replacement, the more famous Audrey Hepburn, for a Golden Globe that year, Andrews thanked My Fair Lady's director for freeing her up to take on Mary Poppins.\n\nAt the time Disney offered her the part, however, Andrews was pregnant. He made an exception since he considered her a must for the role and allowed production to be delayed. Although Disney remained adamant that Andrews play Mary Poppins, P.L. Travers wasn't so sure. She called Andrews in the hospital the day after she gave birth to find out what kind of person she was.\n\nAndrews remembered being surprised at the phone call, explaining to Travers, \"I'm feeling a bit woozy right now. I just had a baby yesterday.\" Although she was less than excited about the casting, Travers eventually accepted her in the role, according to Andrews, saying, \"Well. You're far too pretty, of course. But you've got the nose for it.\"\n\nTapes recorded while P.L. Travers met with the songwriters and screenwriters at Disney Studios reveal her asking how characters will jump into a sidewalk, only to get an unsatisfying answer: \"Walt Disney magic!\" This brand of studio magic had a substantial role in the film, leading to many special effects that were ahead of their time.\n\nAlong with animatronics and uncomfortable harnesses used to make actors \"fly,\" sodium vapor compositing (the predecessor to green screen) allowed real actors to appear in cartoon worlds alongside animated characters. Unfortunately, this process was hard on the actors' eyes and felt far from magical on the set.\n\n\"Because the special effects were filled in later, we had these large, sweaty prop guys in braces dancing about with cut-out horses and penguins to show us what was going on. They both tried hard not to cuss in front of us children,\" actress Karen Dotrice recalled to The Guardian. To keep things interesting for the child actors and to capture authentic reactions, the crew often didn't tell the kids about the special effects. For instance, Jane's reaction to her medicine turning another color was genuine, as was the children's surprise at the ability of Mary Poppins's bag to hold huge objects.\n\nAlong with having to act alongside crew members holding cardboard cutouts of animals that would later be animated over, the child actors of Mary Poppins experienced first-hand how cinematic special effects don't always look so special behind the scenes. Karen Dotrice recalled in an interview with The Independent that the filmmakers used an unusual technique to allow the characters to magically ascend the handrail of a staircase.\n\nThe crew made plaster casts of their behinds, and those casts were later fitted with wires and used as a form-fitting seat to carry them up the railing. The casts were hidden by the children's clothing throughout the scene and made them appear to be moving on their own. \"I thought it was fantastic, going to have your bum imprinted,\" Dotrice remembered. \"It's not quite Mann's Chinese Theatre, but it's close.\""
