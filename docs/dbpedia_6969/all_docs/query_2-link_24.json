        "text": "Mary Poppins is a 1964 American musical live-action/animated film about a magical nanny, played by Julie Andrews, who comes to work for a cold banker's unhappy family.\n\nDirected by Robert Stevenson. Written by Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi, based on the novel by P. L. Travers.\n\nIt's supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!\n\nAs I expected. \"Mary Poppins, practically perfect in every way.\"\n\nReading her magical tape measure, after the children ask her to measure herself.\n\nIn every job that must be done, there is an element of fun. You find the fun and snap! [snaps her fingers] The job's a game.\n\nClose your mouth please, Michael, we are not a codfish.\n\nSacked?! Certainly not, I am never sacked.\n\nIt's grand to be an Englishman in 1910\n\nKing Edward's on the throne; it's the age of men.\n\nIt's 6:03 and the heirs to my dominion are scrubbed and tubbed, and adequately fed. And so I'll pat them on the head, and send them off to bed. Ah, lordly is the life I lead.\n\nA man has dreams of walking with giants\n\nTo carve his niche in the edifice of time\n\nBefore the mortar of his zeal\n\nHas a chance to congeal\n\nThe cup is dashed from his lips\n\nThe flame is snuffed a-borning\n\nHe's brought to wrack and ruin in his prime.\n\nA British bank is run with precision\n\nA British home requires nothing less\n\nTradition, discipline and rules\n\nMust be the tools\n\nWithout them: disorder, catastrophe, anarchy\n\nIn short, you have a ghastly mess!\n\nKindly do not attempt to cloud the issue with facts.\n\n[shakes Winifred's hands] You know, Winifred, I think she will. [Laughs] I think she will!\n\nOh, George, you didn't jump into the river. How sensible of you!\n\n[sings] Our daughters' daughters will adore us and they'll sing in grateful chorus, \"Well done, sister suffragettes.\"\n\n[sings] Though we adore men individually, we agree that as a group they're rather stupid.\n\nOh, it's you! Hello! … Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane, you say? Alright. … Come on with me.…\n\nHere we are, 17 Cherry Tree Lane. Home of George Banks, Esq. [hears yelling inside] Hello, hello, hello. Admiral's right, heavy weather brewing at number 17 and no mistake.\n\nOpening comments to viewers of the film, breaking the fourth wall.\n\nWinds from the east... Mist comin' in... Like something's a brewin', about to begin... Can't put me finger on what lies in store... But I feel what's to 'appen, all 'appened before...!\n\nNot Royal Academy, I suppose. Still, a bit of a finger in the eye, ain't they?\n\nComment about his chalk drawings\n\nWhat did I tell ya? There's the whole world at your feet. And who gets to see it? But the birds, the stars, and the chimney sweeps.\n\n[Surprised] What? No road?!\n\n[Laughs while taking a tissue from his pocket] It's just good clean soot, Michael.\n\nGoodbye, Mary Poppins, don't stay away too long.\n\nClosing line of film\n\nAdmiral Boom: [observes the long queue of want-to-be nannies] Ghastly looking crew, I must say!\n\nMr. Dawes, Sr.: While stand the banks of England, England stands — whoa, whoa...! [Mr. Dawes stumbles over his own cane] When fall the banks of England... ENGLAND FALLS! [Mr. Dawes falls backward and the rest of the Board of Directors have to catch him]\n\nUncle Albert: The other day, when it was so cold, a friend of mine went to buy some long underwear. The shopkeeper said to him, \"How long you want it?\" And my friend said, \"Well, from about September to March.\"\n\nOld Crone: Come with me, my dears. Granny'll hide you!\n\nAdmiral Boom: Time Gun ready?\n\nMr. Binnacle: Ready and charged, Sir.\n\nAdmiral Boom: Three minutes and six seconds.\n\nMr. Binnacle: Aye, aye, sir.\n\nBert: [to the audience] What he's famous for is punctuality [touches his nose as he says this]. The whole world takes its time from Greenwich. But Greenwich they say, takes its time from Admiral Boom. [calling up to the admiral] What cheer, Admiral?\n\nAdmiral Boom: Good afternoon to you, young man. Where are you bound?\n\nBert: Number 17. Got some parties who want to see it.\n\nAdmiral Boom: Enter that in the log.\n\nMr. Binnacle: Aye, aye, sir.\n\nAdmiral Boom: A word of advice, young man. Storm signals are up at number 17. Bit of heavy weather brewing there.\n\nBert: Thank you sir! Keep an eye skinned.\n\nWinifred Banks: Well, there're missing. Katie Nanna has looking everywhere.\n\nGeorge Banks: Very well. I'll deal with this at once.\n\n( phone circle rings )\n\nGeorge: Give me the police station, quickly, please.\n\nWinifred: I don't think, we need the police, dear. The facts of the matter--\n\n( doorbell rings )\n\nGeorge: Come in, Constable. Come in.\n\nConstable Jones: Thank you, sir.\n\nGeorge: Valuables?\n\nConstable: Come along, now. Come along.\n\nWinifred: Jane! Michael!\n\nGeorge: Winifred, please. Don't be emotional.\n\nConstable: Oh, I wouldn't be too hard on them, sir. They've had a long, weary walk today.\n\nGeorge: Children, come here at once. Well?\n\nJane Banks: I'm sorry, we lost Katie Nanna, Father.\n\nMichael Banks: You see, it was windy.\n\nJane: And, the kite was too strong for us.\n\nJane: Thank you, Constable.\n\nGeorge: I would indeed! Ellen, take Jane and Michael upstairs straightaway.\n\nEllen: Yes, sir.\n\nGeorge: Thank you. Most interesting. And now, I think we've had quite enough of this nonsense. Please return to the nursery.\n\nWinifred: They we're only trying to help. They're just childen.\n\nGeroge: I'm well they're just children, Winifred. I only congratulate myself that I decided to step in and take a hand. ( paper rips ) \"Play games, sing songs, give treats.\" Ridiculous. There's no question in my mind whatsover. Now, is the time for action.\n\n( phone circle rings )\n\nGeorge: Give me The Times, please. No, I do not know the number.\n\nWinifred: Oh, George, you're alaways so forceful.\n\nGeorge: The Times? George Banks here. 17 Cherry Tree Line. I wish to place an advertisement in your column.\n\n[George and Winifred are talking about the failure of their previous nanny]\n\nWinifred: I'm sorry, dear, but when I chose Katie Nana, I thought she would be firm with the children. She seemed so solemn and cross.\n\nGeorge: My dear, never confuse efficiency with a liver complaint.\n\nJane: [reads an ad she and Michael wrote] Wanted: a nanny for two adorable children.\n\nGeorge: Adorable — well that's highly debatable, I must say.\n\n[Jane continues reading while singing alone.]\n\nJane: If you want this choice position, have a cheery disposition...\n\nGeorge: Jane, I don't... [Winifred silences him.]\n\nJane: Rosy cheeks, no warts...\n\nMichael: That's the part I put in!\n\nJane: Play games all sorts. You must be kind, you must be witty; very sweet and fairly pretty...\n\nGeorge: Well, of all the ridic... [Winifred silences him again.]\n\nJane: Take us on outings, give us treats. Sing songs, bring sweets. Never be cross or cruel, never feed us castor oil, or gruel. Love us as a son and daughter, and never smell of barley water...\n\nMichael: I put that in, too.\n\nJane: If you won't scold and dominate us, we will never give you cause to hate us. We won't hide your spectacles so you can't see, put toads in your bed, or pepper in your tea. Hurry, Nanny! Many thanks! Sincerely...\n\nMichael and Jane: Jane and Michael Banks.\n\n[Having seen Mary Poppins's first arrival as she's floating down from the sky.]\n\nMichael: Perhaps it's a witch.\n\nJane: Of course not. Witches have brooms.\n\n[As George puts his head down in the fireplace, to look for his children's ad, which he ripped up, and is now mended in Mary Poppins' hand.]\n\nMary Poppins: I beg your pardon, are you ill?\n\nGeorge: I hope not.\n\nJane & Michael: Please, Mary Poppins, please?\n\nMary Poppins: I have no intention of making a spectacle of myself, thank you.\n\nBert: I'll do it myself.\n\nMary Poppins: Do what?\n\nBert: A bit of magic.\n\nMichael: A bit of magic?\n\nBert: It's easy. You think. You wink. You do a double blink. You close your eyes... And jump.\n\n[Nothing happens]\n\nJane: Is something supposed to happen?\n\nMary Poppins: Bert, what utter nonsense. [sighs] Why do you always complicate things that are really quite simple? Give me your hand please, Michael. Don't slouch. One, two...\n\n[They jump into the sidewalk drawing. Afterwards, they find that their clothes have magically transformed.]\n\nBert: Mary Poppins, you look beeeeautiful.\n\nMary Poppins: Do you really think so?\n\nBert: I cross my heart you do, like the day I met ya.\n\nMary Poppins: You look fine too, Bert.\n\nBert: [sings] It's true that Mavis and Sybil have ways that are winning\n\nAnd Prudence and Gwendolyn set your heart spinning\n\nPhoebe's delightful, Maude is disarming.\n\nPenguins: Janice, Felicia, and Lydia.\n\nBert: [sings] Charming!\n\nCynthia's dashing\n\nVivian's sweet\n\nStephanie's smashing\n\nPriscilla a treat.\n\nPenguins: Veronica, Millicent, Agnes, and Jane.\n\nBert: [sings] Convivial company, time and again\n\nDorcas and Phyllis and Glynis are sorts\n\nI'll agree are three jolly good sports\n\nBut cream of the crop, tip of the top....\n\nBert and the Penguins: It's Mary Poppins, and there we stop!\n\nHorseman: View halloo!\n\nHorse: Oh, yes, definitely. A view halloo.\n\nFox: View halloo?! [The horseman blows a trumpet, causing his dogs to go charge at the Fox.] Faith and begora, it's them redcoats again!\n\nGentleman: There probably aren't words to describe your emotions.\n\nMary Poppins: On the contrary, there's a very good word. Am I right, Bert?\n\nBert: Tell 'em what is it.\n\nMary Poppins: Right. [sings] Iiiiit's Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.\n\nMary Poppins: You know, you can say it backwards, which is dociousaliexpilisticfragicalirupus, but that's going a bit too far, don't you think?\n\nBert: Indubitably.\n\nMary Poppins: [sings] So if the cat has got your tongue, there's no need for dismay...\n\nBert: Here, here!\n\nMary Poppins: [sings] Just summon up this word and then you've got a lot to say\n\nBut better use it carefully or it could change your life...\n\nBusker: For example...\n\nMary Poppins: Yes?\n\nBusker: One night I said it to me girl, and now me girl's me wife. [Wife hits him with tambourine] Ow! And a lovely thing she is, too. [laughs]\n\nWinifred: As a matter of fact, since you hired Mary Poppins, the most extraordinary things seem to have come over the household.\n\nGeorge: Is that so?\n\nWinifred: Take Ellen for instance. She hasn't broken a dish all morning.\n\nGeorge: [uninterested] Really. Well, that is extraordinary.\n\nGeorge: Ellen, stop making that offensive noise. And shut the window. That bird is giving me a headache.\n\nEllen: Yes, sir! [to the bird] Quiet! You're giving the master an 'eadache!\n\n[The bird chirps one last time and Ellen shuts the window.]\n\nJane: Good morning, father!\n\nGeorge: Morning.\n\nJane: Mary Poppins taught us the most wonderful word...\n\nMichael: Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!\n\nGeorge: What on Earth are you talking about? Superca — Super — or whatever the infernal thing is.\n\nJane: It's something to say when you don't know what to say.\n\nGeorge: Yes, well, I always know what to say. Go on. Hurry along, please.\n\nJane: Yes, father.\n\nGeorge: Have this piano repaired. When I sit down to an instrument, I like to have it in tune.\n\nWinifred: But George, you don't play.\n\nGeorge: Madame, that is entirely beside the point!\n\nBert: Speaking of sight, it reminds me of me brother. He's got a nice cushy job in a watch factory.\n\nUncle Albert: In a watch factory? What does he do?\n\nBert: [laughs] He stands about all day and makes faces!\n\nUncle Albert: [laughs] He makes faces in a watch factory!\n\nBert: Speaking of names, I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith.\n\nUncle Albert: What's the name of his other leg?\n\nEveryone: [laughs]\n\nBert: Uncle Albert, I got a jolly joke I save for just such an occasion. Would you like to hear it?\n\nUncle Albert: I'd be so grateful.\n\nBert: Righto. Well it's about me granddad, see, and one night he had a nightmare. So bad, he chewed his pillow to bits. To bits. The next morning, I says, \"How do you feel, Granddad?\" He says, \"Oh not bad, a little down in the mouth.\" [laughs] I always say there's nothing like a good joke.\n\nUncle Albert: And that was nothing like a good joke.\n\nGeorge: [As they arrive at the bank where George works] We must be on our best behavior.\n\nMichael: But I thought it was your bank.\n\nGeorge: Well, I'm one of the younger officers, so in a sense it is. Sort of.\n\nMichael: [about his tuppence] I want it to feed the birds.\n\nMr. Dawes, Sr.: Fiddlesticks, boy. Feed the birds and what have you got? Fat birds. But...\n\n[sings] If you invest your tuppence wisely\n\nin the bank safe and sound,\n\nsoon, the tuppence, safely invested in the bank,\n\nwill compound.\n\nAnd you'll achieve that sense of conquest as you affluence expands\n\nin the hands of the directors who invest... [coughs] ...As propriety... [coughs again] ...Demands. [coughs once more]\n\nGeorge: May I, Sir?\n\nMr. Dawes, Sr.: Carry on, Banks.\n\n[After Jane and Michael realized that the man who startled them was only Bert as a chimney sweep for the day]\n\nJane: Bert. It's you.\n\nBert: In the flesh and at your service.\n\nMichael: You're filthy.\n\nBert: Oh. Perhaps a smudge or two? It so happens that today, I'm a chimney sweep.\n\nJane: Oh, Bert, we're so frightened!\n\nBert: Now, now, don't take on so. Bert will look after you. Like I was your own father. Now who's after you?\n\nJane: Father is.\n\nBert: What?\n\n[Jane and Michael have just told Bert that the run on the bank is their fault.]\n\nBert: Let's sit down. You know, begging you pardon, but the one who my heart goes out for is your father. There he is in that cold, heartless bank day after day, hemmed in by mounds of cold, heartless money. I don't like to see any living thing caged up.\n\nJane: Father? In a cage?\n\nBert: They makes cages in all sizes and shapes, you know. Bank-shaped some of 'em, carpets and all.\n\nJane: But Father isn't in trouble, we are.\n\nBert: Oh, sure about that, are you? Look at it this way. You've got your mother to look after you. And Mary Poppins and Constable Jones and me. Who looks after your father? Tell me that. When something terrible happens, what does he do? Fends for himself, he does. Who does he tell about it? No one! Don't blab his troubles at home. He just pushes on at his job, uncomplaining and alone and silent.\n\nMichael: He's not very silent.\n\nJane: Michael, be quiet. And Bert, do you think father really needs our help?\n\nBert: Well, Jane, it's not my place to say. [the three of them stand up] I only observe that a father can always do it with a bit of help. Come on, I'll take you home.\n\nMary Poppins: [sings] Chim Chiminy, Chim Chiminy, Chim Chim Cher-ee\n\nWhen you're with a 'sweep, you're in glad company.\n\nBert: [sings] Never was there a more happier crew.\n\nBoth: Than them what sings Chim Chim Chiree Chim Chiroo! Chim Chim Chiminy Chim Chim Chiree Chim Chiroo.\n\nGeorge: Just a moment, Mary Poppins. What is the meaning of this outrage?\n\nMary Poppins: I beg your pardon?\n\nGeorge: Will you be good enough to explain all this?\n\nMary Poppins: First of all I would like to make one thing quite clear.\n\nGeorge: Yes?\n\nMary Poppins: I never explain anything.\n\nBert: [sings] You're a man of high position, esteemed by your peers. And when your little tykes are crying, you haven't time to dry their tears... And see their thankful little faces smiling up at you... 'Cause their dad, he always knows just what to do...\n\nGeorge: [caught off guard by this new knowledge] ...Well, look — I...\n\nBert: Like you said, Gov'ner. [sings] You've got to grind, grind, grind at that grindstone... Though childhood slips like sand through a sieve... And all too soon they've up and grown, and then they've flown... And it's too late for you to give — just that spoonful of sugar to 'elp the medicine go down — the medicine go dow-own — medicine go down. [speaks again] Well, so long, Gov'ner. Sorry to have troubled you.\n\n[Bert exits, whistling \"A Spoon Full of Sugar\"]\n\n[soft music plays and chorus vocalizing softly]\n\n[bank tower bell rings]\n\nMr. Dawes, Jr.: In 1773, an official on this bank unwisely loaned a large sum of money to finance a shipment of tea to the American colonies. Do you know what happened?\n\nGeorge: Yes, sir... yes, I think I do. As the ship lay in Boston Harbor, a party of the colonists dressed as red Indians boarded the vessel, behaved very rudely, and threw all the tea overboard, making the tea unsuitable for drinking. [jokingly] Even for Americans.\n\nMr. Dawes, Jr.: Precisely. The loan was defaulted. Panic ensued within these walls. There was a run on the bank.\n\nMr. Dawes, Sr.: From that time to this, sir, there has not been a run on this bank... until today! A run, sir, caused by the disgraceful conduct of your son, do you deny it?\n\n[George has just been discharged from the bank]\n\nMr. Dawes, Sr.: Well, Banks — have you anything to say for yourself?\n\nGeorge: Well, sir... they do say that when there's nothing to say, all you can say is...\n\n[He feels something in his pocket, takes it out, and looks at it: Michael's tuppence]\n\nMr. Dawes, Sr.: Confound it, Banks! I said do you have anything to say?\n\nGeorge: [starts to laugh] There's just one word, sir...!\n\nMr. Dawes, Sr.: Yes?\n\nGeorge Banks: Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious! [laughs]\n\nMr. Dawes, Sr.: What?\n\nGeorge: Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious! Mary Poppins was right! It's extraordinary! It does make you feel better! [laughs]\n\nMr. Dawes, Sr.: What are you talking about, man? There's no such word.\n\nGeorge: Oh, yes. It is a word. A perfectly good word. Actually, do you know what there's no such thing as? It turns out, with due respect, when all is said and done, that there's no such thing as you!\n\nMr. Dawes, Sr.: Impertinence, sir!\n\nGeorge: Speaking of \"Impertinence,\" would you like to hear a perfectly marvellous joke? A real snapper!\n\nMr. Dawes, Sr.: \"Joke?\" \"Snapper?\"\n\nGeorge: Yes. There were these two wonderful young people, Jane and Michael. And they meet one day on the street, and Jane says to Michael, \"I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith.\" And Michael said, \"Really? What's the name of his other leg?\" [laughs even more]\n\nMr. Dawes, Sr.: The man's gone mad! Call the guard!\n\nGeorge: Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious! I'm feeling better all the time!\n\n[he moves toward Dawes, Sr., as if to punch him; Dawes, Jr., stands up in his father's defense]\n\nMr. Dawes, Jr.: Banks, don't you dare strike my father!\n\nGeorge: [hands Dawes Sr., the tuppence] There's the tuppence. The wonderful, faithful, Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious tuppence! Guard it well! Bye-bye!\n\nMr. Dawes, Sr.: Banks, where are you going?\n\nGeorge: I don't know. I might pop through a chalk-pavement picture, and go for an outing in the country. Or I might seize a horse off a merry-go-round and win the derby! Or I might just fly a kite! Only Poppins would know!\n\nMr. Dawes, Sr.: Poppins?\n\nGeorge: My nanny. She's the one who sings that ridiculous song. [sings while he dances out of the bank] A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down, the medicine go down, the medicine go down...! [Fades while door closes]\n\nMr. Dawes, Jr.: Mad as a march hare.\n\nMr. Dawes, Sr.: [caught up on the joke] A wooden leg named \"Smith\"... A wooden leg named \"Smith\"... A wooden le- [starts to wheeze-laugh before he flies up]\n\nMr. Dawes, Jr.: Father... Father! [while the Bankers try to take the chairman of the bank down] Father, come down! Daddy! Daddy, come back! [wails]\n\n[The bankers see the Banks family flying a kite]\n\nMr. Dawes, Jr.: Ah, there you are, Banks! I want to congratulate you. Capitol bit of humour. \"Wooden leg named 'Smith!'\" [laughs and pauses] Or Jones, whatever it was. Father died laughing!\n\nGeorge: Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.\n\nMr. Dawes, Jr.: Oh, no, nonsense. Nothing to be sorry about. Never seen him happier in his life. [hands George back the flower badge] He left an opening for a new partner. Congratulations.\n\nGeorge: [delighted] Thank you, sir. Thank you very much indeed, sir!\n\n[Winifred kisses her husband]\n\n[As Mary Poppins watches the Banks family at the park, the parrot-shaped handle on her umbrella speaks]\n\nParrot Umbrella: [squawks] That's gratitude for you! Didn't even say goodbye.\n\nMary Poppins: No, they didn't.\n\nParrot Umbrella: Look at them! You know, they think more of their father than they do of you!\n\nMary Poppins: That's as it should be.\n\nParrot Umbrella: Well, don't you care?\n\nMary Poppins: Practically perfect people never permit sentiment to muddle their thinking.\n\nParrot Umbrella: Is that so? Well, I'll tell you one thing, Mary Poppins: you don't fool me a bit!\n\nMary Poppins: Oh, really?\n\nParrot Umbrella: Yes, really. I know exactly how you feel about these children. And if you think I'm going to keep my mouth shut any longer, I--\n\nMary Poppins: [clamps his mouth shut] That will be quite enough of that, thank you.\n\n[music playing]\n\nBert: Good-bye, Mary Poppins. Don't stay away too long.\n\nMary Poppins: Jane! Michael! Stay close now. Oh, Bert, all your fine drawings.\n\nBert: Well, there more where they came from meantime. I'm changing businesses. This is here love hot chestnut weather.\n\nMary Poppins: Come along, children. Bye, Bert.\n\nJane: Bye, Bert.\n\nMichael: Bye, Bert.\n\nMichael: No, no, I won't take your nasty medicine!\n\nJane: Do we have to, Mary Poppins?\n\nMary Poppins: People who get their feet wet, must learn to take their medicine.\n\nMichael: I don't want it. I'm not gonna--\n\nJane: Oh! Lime cordial! Delicious!\n\nMichael: Strawberry! Mmm!\n\nMary Poppins: R-r-rum punch.
