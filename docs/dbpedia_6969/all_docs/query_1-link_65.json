        "text": "THAT wonderful English nursemaid, Mary Poppins, who has charmed millions of children (and grown-ups) throughout the world since she first entered literary service under the encouragement of Miss P. L. Travers in 1934, has finally been embodied in a movie. And a most wonderful, cheering movie it is, with Julie Andrews, the original Eliza of \"My Fair Lady,\" playing the title role and with its splices and seams fairly splitting with Poppins marvels turned out by the Walt Disney studio.In case you are a Mary Poppins zealot who dotes on her just as she is, don't let the intrusion of Mr. Disney and his myrmidons worry you one bit. Be thankful for it and praise heaven there are such as they still making films. For the visual and aural felicities they have added to this sparkling color film—the enchantments of a beautiful production, some deliciously animated sequences, some exciting and nimble dancing and a spinning musical score—make it the nicest entertainment that has opened at the Music Hall this year.And, of course, if you know Mary Poppins, you know that no one would dare to try to fool around with her appearance and her stanch individuality. Even the great Mr. Disney would find himself being subdued by a prim nanny flying through his window and warning crisply, \"That will be quite enough of that.\"This is the genuine Mary Poppins that comes sailing in on an east wind, her open umbrella canted over on the starboard tack, to take on the care of the Banks children, Jane and Michael, in their parents' London home, and vastly uplift the spirits of that father-dominated family.It is she, played superbly by Miss Andrews, with her button-shoed feet splayed out to give her an unshakable footing and a look of complete authority, who calmly proceeds to show her charges that wonders will never cease and that there's nothing like a spoonful of sugar to sweeten the nastiest medicine. And it is she, with her unrelenting discipline and her disarmingly angelic face, who fills this film with a sense of wholesome substance and the serenity of self-confidence.But don't think that Mary Poppins is simply a nursery martinet. She is a wonderfully agile spirit with a gift for expansion and fun. To her, it is not the least amazing that she can fly with an umbrella, slide upstairs on banisters on which ordinary people slide down, walk through chalk drawings on the pavement into glittering magical worlds and take her young charges along with her, to their surprise and delight.And it is in the performances of these wonders that Mr. Disney and his people assist in their most felicitous fashion. Flying characters are easy for them. There's nothing at all unusual about sliding a nanny upstairs. And when it comes to surrounding live persons with adorable animated cartoons, they are, of course, the past masters. They are close to their best in this film.By far the most fanciful passage is a winning one in which Mary Poppins, her two young people and Bert, the sidewalk artist and match-seller, pass into a cartoon wonderland where barnyard animals frolic. And there's a tinkling carousel, on the horses of which the four voyagers go bouncing off on adventuresome jaunts.To a thoroughly rollicking musical number,\" Jolly Holiday,\" they get mixed up in a cartoon fox-hunt, with a darling Irish fox, and ride on into the Derby horse-race, which, needless to say, Mary Poppins wins.Maybe it's our imagination, but there's something about the tunes that Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman have written for this film that reminds us of the tunes in \"My Fair Lady.\" And also the Edwardian costumes and the mellow London settings recollect that hit. A brilliant ballet in which Miss Andrews and Dick Van Dyke as Bert scatter and leap with a gang of sooty chimney-sweeps on the London rooftops is reminiscent, too. The comparison is not unflattering to either. \"Mary Poppins\" is a fair-lady film.Bouquets don't go only to Miss Andrews. Mr. Van Dyke is joyous as Bert, the gay and irrepressible street merchant who is the companion of Mary Poppins and the kids. The latter, performed by Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber, are just as they should be, and their parents—appropriately eccentric—are done beautifully by David Tomlinson and Glynis Johns.Ed Wynn is grand as Uncle Albert, who soars up to the ceiling when he laughs, and Reginald Owen makes of Admiral Boom, the nautical neighbor, a natural caricature. Hermione Baddley, Elsa Lanchester and Arthur Treacher are droll in smaller roles. Robert Stevenson has directed with inventiveness and a true Mary Poppins flair.Of course, it is sentimental. And, as Mary Poppins says, \"Practically perfect people never permit sentiment to muddle their feelings.\" But being not practically perfect, I find it irresistible. Plenty of other adults will feel the same way. And, needless to say, so will the kids.On the stage of the Music Hall is a revue, saluting New York and Lincoln Center, with the Del Rey Brothers, comedians; Nana and Fred Albee, dancers; the Choral Ensemble and Rockettes.\n\nThe CastMARY POPPINS, screenplay by Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi, based on the \"Mary Poppins\" books by P.
