The film was shot entirely at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California, using painted London background scenes.[7]\n\nMary Poppins was released on August 27, 1964, to critical acclaim and commercial success, earning $44 million in theatrical rentals in its original run. It became the highest-grossing film of 1964 in the United States, and at the time of its release became Disney's highest-grossing film. During its theatrical lifetime, it grossed over $103 million worldwide. It received a total of thirteen Academy Award nominations—a record for any film released by Walt Disney Studios—including Best Picture, and won five: Best Actress for Andrews, Best Film Editing, Best Original Music Score, Best Visual Effects, and Best Original Song for \"Chim Chim Cher-ee\". It is considered Walt Disney's crowning live-action achievement and is the only one of his films to earn a Best Picture nomination during his lifetime.[7] In 2013, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"[8]"
