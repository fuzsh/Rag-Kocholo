        "text": "Where are the cast of Mary Poppins now? Find out what happened to the stars after the film...\n\nMary Poppins has become a Disney classic after hitting the big screen back in 1964.\n\nIt’s unsurprising the movie went on to win five Academy Awards out of 13 nominations, including for the song ‘Chim Chim Cher-ee.’\n\nNow, six decades on we take a look back at what happened to the stars of the musical, and where they are now…\n\nJulie Andrews (Mary Poppins)\n\nMary Poppins fans might know that the film was actually Julie Andrews' big screen debut at the age of 29.\n\nAfter winning an Oscar for Best Actress, Julie Andrews went on to bag a role in The Sound of Music the next year.\n\nNow in her 80s, the mum-of-three has had a long career in films such as Victor/Victoria, That's Life!, Duet for One and The Princess Diaries.\n\nOver the past few years, she has starred in Despicable Me 3, Aquaman and recently voiced the narrator Lady Whistledown in the Netflix series Bridgerton.\n\nDick Van Dyke (Bert)\n\nJust like his co-star, Dick Van Dyke's role in Mary Poppins catapulted him into other roles such as Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.\n\nNow in his late 90s, has also starred in Curious George, Night at the Museum, Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb and had a cameo in 2018’s Mary Poppins Returns.\n\nJulie Andrews gives lovely tribute to 'Mary Poppins' co-star Dick Van Dyke at Kennedy Center Honors\n\nDick Van Dyke, 97, leaves judges in tears during 'greatest reveal ever' on The Masked Singer\n\nKaren Dotrice (Jane Banks)\n\nAt just nine years old, Karen Dotrice got the role of little Jane Banks.\n\nPrior to this, she had previously appeared with her on-screen brother Matthew Gerber in The Three Lives of Thomasina.\n\nThe two also played siblings in The Gnome-Mobile, while Dotrice went on to star in The Thirty Nine Steps in 1978.\n\nThe Holiday cast: Where are the stars of the Christmas movie now?\n\nAt 55 years old, Karen has retired from acting and has three kids from two marriages.\n\nShe has relocated to an area of Los Angeles where she is said to live nearby to Andrews and Van Dyke.\n\nDotrice also made a brief cameo in Mary Poppins Returns.\n\nMatthew Garber (Michael Banks)\n\nJust like his on-screen sister, Matthew Garber appeared in The Three Lives of Tomasina and The Gnome-Mobile.\n\nSadly, he died at the age of just 21 in 1977 from pancreatitis.\n\nDavid Tomlinson (Mr Banks)\n\nDavid Tomlinson was already an experienced actor by the time he took on the role of Mr Banks.\n\nThe trained pilot went on to star in The Love Bug, Bedknobs and Broomsticks and his last role was in The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu.\n\nHe retired in 1980 and died in 2000 at the age of 83 after suffering a stroke.\n\nGlynis Johns (Mrs Banks)\n\nJust like Tomlinson, Glynis Johns was already a seasoned actress before taking the role of Mrs Banks.\n\n10 secrets about Grease you probably never knew\n\nHer other credits include The Sword and the Rose, Batman, Cheers and The Love Boat, While You Were Sleeping and Superstar.\n\nAfter retiring in 1999, Johns died at the age of 100 in late 2023."
