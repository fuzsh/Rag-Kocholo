        "text": "When I was growing up, I had access to two VHS videos. One was The Snowman, the classic adaption of the Raymond Briggs cartoon, and the other was Mary Poppins. (I’m talking about the mid-1980s, when this represented an extraordinary range of options on top of Britain’s four terrestrial TV channels.) As a result, I watched Poppins probably 3,000 times; I know it from the first spit-spot to the umbrella’s final squawk. It is thanks to this movie that I still misuse the word “amortize” and, in times of stress, can be unaccountably soothed by the phrase “Shipyards, the mercantile”.\n\nI was, therefore, interested to read this week of a new Poppins movie in the works, to be directed by Rob Marshall – who just made a long-winded version of Stephen Sondheim’s Into the Woods – and with new music by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, a songwriting duo known mainly for Hairspray and the Broadway production of Catch Me if You Can. There is no word on casting yet, but with the memory of Carrie Underwood’s Maria von Trapp still waking many of us screaming in the night, I am braced for the worst.\n\nThe rationale for remaking a successful film – the original Poppins won Julie Andrews and composers the Sherman brothers all Oscars – is, often, that it will revisit the source material to do it greater justice. As we know from Saving Mr Banks, the recent PL Travers biopic starring Emma Thompson, Travers hated the Disney adaptation of her book. She thought it sentimental and silly. She hated the fact they turned Mrs Banks into a suffragette. And she thought the film-makers got the character of Poppins all wrong.\n\nThe author had some cause for complaint. The first Poppins book was written in 1934, but was set 20 years earlier, in Edwardian England, and its central character, like the woman who created her, was difficult to the point of obnoxious. PL Travers described Mary Poppins as a woman who “never wastes time being nice”. She was sharp, short-tempered and a bit of a tyrant, a childcare professional with no references who did not, as in the Disney version, materialize by gliding serenely down onto the doorstep, but was hurled against the gate by the wind.\n\nNeither was she sentimental. Poppins had little time for the Bird Woman, the vagrant stationed on the steps of St Paul’s Cathedral, and on the issue of avian welfare in the capital went further even than Dawes Sr – “Feed the birds and what have you got? Fat birds!” – by suggesting they should be baked in a pie.\n\nThe biggest difference between the book and film versions of Poppins, however, was one of class. In the guise of Julie Andrews, you would call Poppins posh; all those crystal-cut vowels and crisp consonants. The original Poppins was nothing of the sort. Travers, an Australian immigrant to London, placed her heroine further down the social scale, as she herself, in that era, would have been judged to be. This is unequivocal. The original Poppins, in the accent that so magnificently eluded Dick Van Dyke, refers to the birds as “sparrers”.\n\nPoppins is also a bit of a snob, disdainful of the Banks’ aspirational middle class style. (On a deputy bank manager’s salary, the Bankses could not have afforded 17 Cherry Tree Lane, which is clearly in one of the grand squares in Chelsea. Travers deals with this in the book by identifying their house as the shabbiest in the street and having them constantly worry about money, particularly after the arrival of Jane and Michael’s twin siblings, John and Barbara, whom Disney cut from the movie.)\n\nIn spite of all this, Travers was wrong in her assessment of the Disney film, which was more faithful to her version than she allowed herself to see. The tone of the movie is sharp and the moral at times subversive. Mr Banks is slyly ridiculed by his wife. His stuffiness and commitment to “tradition, discipline and rules” is presented as ruinously inflexible. The banking system, the preserve of ancient old men shouting at each other across marble hallways, is a farce and a confidence trick.\n\nI’ve always thought that Mary Poppins is David Tomlinson’s movie as much as it is Julie Andrews’. When, as Mr Banks, he gets his hat punched inside out and his bosses destroy his umbrella, he plays the scene with a pathos that, to a child of seven or eight, does terrible violence to the notion of parental infallibility. Tomlinson is the great heart of the movie, the warmth to Andrews’ splinter of ice, who, while sustaining the film’s line in jokey verbosity, still manages to be moving.\n\n“The cup is dashed from his lips / The flame is snuffed aborning / He’s brought to rack and ruin in his prime,” he sings with quiet defeat after the collapse of his career. (To which Bert, of course, replies gamely: “Life’s a rum go, guv’nor, and that’s the truth.” Perhaps Ray Winstone – or indeed Idris Elba – in this role for the remake?)\n\nThe problem for Travers was that in the movie, none of this goes far enough. It all comes right in the end. Mr Banks does not become a stay-at-home dad, but returns to the bank, triumphant. Order is restored.\n\nThe book occupies a darker moral universe, one in which an alternative, more definitive ending is alluded to. Poppins is always looking in mirrors because she feels only tenuously connected to the physical world. (One sees why Sylvia Plath liked these books; TS Eliot, too.) What’s more, she has a cousin who is a snake and who, on the night of her birthday, gives her his shed skin and speculates that to eat and be eaten amount to the same thing when we are, “as one, moving to the same end”. It’s an extraordinary piece of paganism for a children’s book, prefiguring the end, when Poppins disappears with a “wild cry”, never to return. You don’t get that in Lassie Come Home.\n\nEnough of this complexity made it into the movie, however, to preserve its original flavour and even, perhaps, to deepen it. I have a theory that the Bird Woman is Poppins’s alter ego: despised and destitute, the mad old bat whom women like PL Travers were expected to become – invisible, husbandless and in need of a chin wax. She is the crone in the snow globe whom Poppins compels us to see.\n\nPoppins herself, of course, remains defiant, both in the book and in the movie, which denies us the resolution it has spent the entire storyline setting up. At the end, Bert gazes at Poppins’ retreating form as she floats up through the sky. “Don’t stay away too long,” he says, touching his cap and looking incredulous as only Dick Van Dyke can.\n\nLooking down, Poppins smiles back rather condescendingly, as if to say, very much in the spirit of her creator: “Really, Bert. I don’t have the requisite vulnerabilities for marriage. Don’t you know that about me by now?”"
