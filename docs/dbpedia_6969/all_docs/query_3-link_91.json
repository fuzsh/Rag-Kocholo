        "text": "Avast me hearties! It be time to make our first venture to the Golden Age of Piracy. Weigh anchor and hoist the mizzen! But remember- dead men tell no tales! This be Treasure Island, yaaaaar!\n\nDisclaimer: This blog is purely recreational and not for profit.

The opinions expressed therein reflect those of the authors and are not to be viewed as factual documentation. All photos are capped from my copy of the movie with Lightshot Screenshot or the Disney Wikia unless otherwise specified.\n\nSome time after So Dear to My Heart, RKO relaxed their restrictions requiring Disney to include animation in their films. As a result, Walt was finally able to start making a fully live-action picture like he’d been wanting to. His choice in story was Robert Louis Stevenson’s classic novel, Treasure Island, which has long been a personal favorite. There was just one problem. Due to new laws made after World War II, Walt could no longer take the money his films made in the UK market outside of the UK. The solution? To film Treasure Island entirely on location in Cornwall, Bristol, Devon, and Buckinghamshire.\n\nThe film was largely well-received. It was praised as being an extremely entertaining action film and a beautifully shot one at that. They also enjoyed that the movie was a faithful adaptation of the original novel, something that is all too rare in the cinema world. Some questioned whether Bobby Driscoll was a good enough actor for the role of Jim, and thought the American actor was out of place in a British story. But on the whole, audiences loved it enough to make Treasure Island the sixth highest grossing movie in British cinemas that year.\n\nFor my part, as previously mentioned, I’ve loved the book since I was a little girl. Not only was 12-year-old me absolutely obsessed with pirates but 26-year-old me is a big fan of Stevenson. This is my second favorite of his books (behind Jekyll and Hyde, if you’re curious). I’ve seen and loved both other Disney adaptations of the story, as well as a small handful of others. However, somehow or other, this version slipped through the cracks. I’ve never seen it. I know, crazy, right? So, let’s see how it stacks up against the Muppets and the cyborgs!\n\nSTORY\n\nThis version of Treasure Island dispenses with any semblance of backstory or character introductions. I mean, we skip the first few chapters of Billy Bones terrorizing the Admiral Benbow Inn and jump right in to Jim Hawkins being approached by a sketchy old sailor with a nasty scar. Side note, it is so weird seeing a ten-year-old tending bar. The old sailor, Black Dog, orders double rum and asks if Jim knows a sailor named William Bones. Jim acts confused, but Black Dog lays eyes on an old sea chest with the initials W.B. carved in the side. He bolts away, leaving Jim very confused as to what just happened.\n\nBones himself hobbles down the stairs, looking like hell warmed over. He asks if Jim’s strange seafaring visitor was a man with one leg. He wasn’t, but he did have an ugly scar which would make him the one-legged man’s right hand and no less dangerous. Bones pleads for Jim to give him a drink of rum to calm his nerves, but Jim refuses because it’s against the doctor’s orders. You can’t keep a pirate from his rum so Bones just forces his way behind the bar and steals a whole bottle of rum. Jim races outside to fetch the doctor and the squire because he knows that alcohol does not mix with this guy’s already fragile health.\n\nHe doesn’t get very far. Another pirate, Blind Pew, seizes him and threatens to break his arm if he doesn’t take him to Bones. And can I just say that while Pew isn’t in the movie long enough to warrant an entry in characters, he is delightful? He has an extremely hammy Scottish-Irish-ish accent and chews the scenery to bits throughout his limited screen time. His sense of menace makes him a true one-scene wonder. He doesn’t die like in the book either so that’s cool I guess. Blind Pew forces the Black Spot, a pirate’s death sentence, into Bones’ hands and leaves the movie. So sad.\n\nHe’s given Bones until dark to live, so Bones tells Jim to help him to his sea chest. In an understandable panic, he slices a small piece of paper out of the lining. It’s a treasure map, leading to the loot of the legendary pirate Captain Nathaniel Flint! He goes to stuff it into his shirt but collapses before he finishes the action. He pleads for Jim to go for help, then shoves the map into his vest just in case the pirates come back. Jim barely gets down the road before… shocker… the pirates come back! They turn the inn upside down but don’t find the map. Jim returns with a small cavalry of lawmen that send the pirates scurrying. Among them are Dr. Livesy and Squire Trelawney, who kinda show up with no introduction at all.\n\nDr. Livesy gets to Bones’ side but he’s already dead. And before the murderous pirates got to him, too. Everyone wonders what the pirates were really after, until Jim hands over the treasure map. Trelawney is over the moon, gushing about what a great adventure it will be to go after some pirate treasure. Livesy, ever the voice of reason, points out that Trelawney is incapable of shutting his mouth for five seconds and if he tries to go after the treasure he’ll tell half of London about it before they even set foot on the ship. He also brings up the very sensible fact that Jim’s unseen mother won’t want him risking his life like this, but Jim’s sure she’ll be cool with it as long as he’s with the doctor. I’m not entirely sure that’s how parenting works but all right then.\n\nThe next morning, Jim and the adults ride into town, where the good ship Hispaniola rises above the matte painted buildings. Trelawney has decided he’s an admiral and won’t stop screaming about treasure, much to Livesy’s frustration. Trelawney doesn’t care about practicality, though. He’s frustrated that the captain is taking so long to choose a crew because he’s worried about silly things like whether or not they’re trustworthy or experienced. He has a better idea: ask the new ship’s cook just because he used to be a sailor. What could possibly go wrong? Trelawney leads the group into a tavern to meet the infamous Long John Silver.\n\nSilver is nothing but courteous and polite when they walk in, but Jim Hawkins is still horrorstruck when he sees that Silver is missing a leg and hobbling around on a crutch. He hasn’t really earned this immediate dislike, though. He just serves the three of them what Trelawney says is an excellent lunch. Even Livesy is impressed by the appearance of apples on the table. Silver replies that he always keeps a barrel of apples on his ship to prevent scurvy, which endears him to the doctor and provides a nice touch of foreshadowing. Trelawney laments on how hard it’s proving to find a good crew for their voyage, and Silver offers to help out. He personally knows quite a lot of good, experienced men, who may not be pretty but they know what they’re doing. Jim can’t hold his tongue any longer and demands to know if Silver knows any pirates. The adults only laugh, and Silver fondly says he and his silly ideas remind him of a younger version of himself.\n\nIn an effort to defuse the awkwardness and get the kid to shut up and not call his bluff before he even gets started, Silver asks Jim to help him around the tavern. Child labor laws aren’t a thing yet so Livesy and Trelawney have no problem with leaving the kid to work for a guy they’ve never met. He barely gets started when he hears a shrieky voice swearing up a storm from the kitchen. Silver says he really isn’t acquainted with pirates, but his pet parrot was once owned by one and as a result he calls her Captain Flint. Jim feeds the bird a piece of his apple and decides then and there that Silver’s all right. Bones must have been talking about some other one-legged man. Just as he makes that decision, he hears a familiar order for a double rum. Black Dog is back! Jim panics, and Silver orders the ruffians in his tavern to catch the man.\n\nJim explains what happened at the Inn. Silver is horrified that a common filthy pirate would enter his tavern. As someone who knows the story well, it comes off as a bit of suspiciously specific denial, but I suppose he’s convincing if you don’t. He hobbles off to prepare a pistol to protect himself and Jim from any future pirate attacks. But then he has another idea. He hands the pistol off to Jim and tells him to shoot Black Dog if he ever sees him again. Guns in a child’s hands? In the 50’s? This movie was not messing around. They shake hands and decide that they’ll be friends. And there’s no way any of this could backfire.\n\nThe time comes to board the Hispaniola! Other than the dour first mate, Mr. Arrow, there’s a thrill of excitement in the air. No one is more ecstatic than Trelawney. Silver did it! He pulled through and got them a crew, as rough around the edges as they may be. Captain Smollett arrives on deck and demands for Arrow to write down everyone’s names and work experience. Then he orders Livesy and Trelawney belowdecks to have a little chat with them. He doesn’t trust anyone on this ship… because though the reason for the voyage is a secret, everyone seems to know about the treasure. Trelawney gets defensive because everyone knows it’s entirely his fault, and Livesy has nothing to add but eye rolls. Smollett’s not going to let any of this stop the voyage from happening, though, which is enough to get Trelawney to stop whining like a spoiled child. He just wants the map hidden and the weapons moved away from the crew’s quarters, which honestly? Not unreasonable.\n\nThe ship gets underway by way of a montage of the sailors working while Jim munches his apple and looks awed. Even Smollett can’t deny that they’re efficient and for just a moment, it looks like they’ve changed his mind about them. And then that moment ends. One of the sailors, George Merry, is found with a gun tucked into his belt. Smollett confiscates it with a warning that anyone else found with a weapon will get twelve lashes. Jim is worried because he still has the gun Silver gave him. Silver promises that it’ll be fine because he’s “smart as paint” and also not a hot-headed drunkard like the rest of these idiots. To prove his point the crew starts grumbling that Arrow will punish all of them for Merry’s gun by cutting the rum rations. Merry decides he’s going to take care of Arrow then and there with a knife he has up his pant leg (come on, dude, really?). Silver catches him and hurls the knife into the sea, reminding Merry just who’s in charge of that part of the crew. Jim is utterly confused and so am I. Why are we revealing that Silver is a bad guy so early?\n\nThat scene may have been an embarrassingly heavy-handed bit of foreshadowing, but the movie does try to recover. It makes it out like Silver’s way of “taking care of Arrow” involves baking him a cake to butter him up. But there’s one problem. The cake’s just not right without plenty of rum, and the rum is gone (what, did you think I wasn’t going to reference Pirates of the Caribbean?). Spurred on by Silver’s manipulations, Hawkins offers to sneak into Arrow’s private stores to steal some for the cake. A huge store kicks up, and Arrow is in charge of pushing the crew up into the gale to make sure they don’t sink. Silver stops him and offers the cake he made special for him. He hands him a bottle of rum and tells him to pour as much as he wants over the cake. So Arrow just chugs it from the bottle. He swaggers up to the deck roaring drunk, past a murderous George Merry. Silver stops him from stabbing him because he’s “the one taking care of Mr. Arrow.” And fade to black.\n\nThe next morning, the crew is gathered on the deck, looking solemn. Captain Smollett reads a eulogy for Mr. Arrow, who tragically fell overboard during the storm the previous night. Silver has the best poker face I’ve ever seen. During the repeated closeups on his face, he never blinks or shows any indication that Arrow’s death was a carefully orchestrated murder and not an accident. It’s done so well that it almost convinced me that Silver was a good guy. It may feel a little anticlimactic because it happens off-screen very early compared to a lot of versions’ very dramatic death scenes (I’m thinking of Treasure Planet in particular), but that’s how it happens in the book. Arrow only exists for like five pages and has about two lines before his death. So, I can’t really fault the movie for that.\n\nThe Hispaniola sails along. Jim has cabin fever and now that song is stuck in your head, you’re welcome. He goes to the helmsman and basically asks “are we there yet?” The helmsman is a sweetheart and promises that they won’t be long. When the last apple is gone, that’s when they’ll sight land. Jim immediately rushes down to get an apple to speed things along, but he can’t quite reach the bottom of Silver’s apple barrel. And that’s when he overhears a very important conversation. George Merry and Israel Hands, among others of the unsavory crew, are getting restless and ready to slaughter all the honest men on board. Who should tell his underlings to cool their jets but Long John Silver? He wants the treasure for himself as much as they do, but he knows they have to plan this mutiny carefully if it’s going to go off without a hitch. And that means George Merry has to keep his mouth shut and stop trying to stab people.\n\nHorrified by the betrayal, Jim scrambles up to tell Trelawney, Livesy, and Smollett that everything Silver’s ever said was a lie. Trelawney apologizes for ever trusting him, because he was an idiot and he really should have known that someone’s cooking skills do not correlate to their trustworthiness. To make matters worse, Smollett points out that there are only nine honest sailors against twenty pirates, which are horrible odds. Luckily, he had the foresight to hide the guns so all the firepower is on the good guys’ side. The adults ask Jim to stay on Silver’s good side and keep fishing for information. Jim is less than thrilled about having to pretend to be the traitor’s friend, but he agrees just as the watchman cries “land ho!”.\n\nThe officers and Jim scramble above decks to meet with the crew and get their first glimpse of the island. Smollett asks if anyone on board has any knowledge of the island and knows where to lay anchor. Without hesitation, Silver answers, arousing everyone’s suspicions. But when all you have is a hammer, you follow his advice and send him and your ten-year-old spy in a jolly boat to lead the way. Merry still wants to murder everyone so he ignores Silver’s warnings and attacks the lookout. The other mutineers follow suit and our first battle begins! The fight choreography is pretty primitive but a guy does get shot in the face in a Disney movie so there’s that. Trelawney, Livesy, and Smollett immediately point muskets at Silver’s jolly boat, knowing he instigated this whole thing. Silver gets crazy eyes and points a gigantic knife at Jim’s throat, saying if they shoot, Jim dies. He orders Merry to stand down and offers a peace treaty: the map for their lives. And to twist the knife, he thanks Jim for being such a good bartering chip.\n\nJim is not having any of this damsel in distress nonsense. He leaps off the jolly boat and races into the jungle with the pirates hot on his heels. I think it was in Bobby Driscoll’s contract that he has to have a scene of him running the same way through the woods in every movie. Seriously, he does the exact same arm flail as Johnny, Jeremiah, and Jim. He hides from the pirates by… laying behind a log. It’s a terrible hiding spot and they could easily see him if they just like, looked down. But by the power of plot convenience it works and they go away, deciding he must have gone back to the boat for some reason. It’s not the best bit of writing in the movie, that’s all I’m saying.\n\nSuddenly, a man leaps down from the rock and lands three inches from Jim’s log! Jim has the natural response to being startled right after someone’s tried to kill him and goes for his gun. The newcomer promises he’s not a threat despite being dirty, unshaved, dressed in goat skins, and talking like Gollum. He says he’s just “poor Ben Gunn” and he’s been trapped on this island ever since Flint’s crew marooned him there five years ago. Jim reassures him that the captain of the ship is legit but Ben Gunn has seen some of Flint’s hands. He’s particularly terrified of Silver, who was Flint’s quartermaster five years ago, and also the one that marooned him. On the promise of human contact and a piece of cheese, Ben Gunn immediately warms up to Jim and shows him a little boat he made out of goat skins.\n\nMeanwhile, Team Good Guys have found an old fort to use as a base. They leave two lookouts to watch over the pirates in the brig, then take a jolly boat out to search for Jim. George Merry can’t handle going five whole minutes without stabbing someone so he and the pirates escape the hold. Livesy, Smollett, and Trelawney shoot at the pirates, but it’s nine against twenty. A weirdly bloodless battle ensues, the pirates kill both watches, and the Jolly Roger flies high over the mast. They’ve taken the ship! Next order of business is to sink the jolly boat but everyone important survives.\n\nBen Gunn takes Jim to the fort, knowing it’s the best shelter on the island. Jim urges him to come with him but for some reason Ben Gunn refuses unless Smollett meets him alone on the top of Spyglass Hill. Cut back to the pirates, singing and drinking ludicrous amounts of rum as pirates do. Silver is salty that Merry stepped out of line and took the ship against orders, because he’s the captain thank you very much. He’s on the point of throwing him back in the brig but another pirate, Israel Hands, points out Merry’s too good in a fight to lock up. Grudgingly agreeing, Silver orders Hands and one other guy to act as lookouts while everyone else searches for Jim and the map.\n\nSafe and sound in the fort, Jim tells Trelawney, Smollett, and Livesy about Ben Gunn, telling them he’s perfectly sane. Either he’s lying or he was watching a completely different scene because yikes. Smollett says maybe he’ll meet Gunn later but they’ve got bigger fish to fry right now. For example, Silver is now approaching the fort with a flag of truce, pretending to be a friendly face. He generously offers to let them all live and send them a ship to take them back to England if they hand over the map. Smollett has absolutely no time for this nonsense and basically tells Silver to bite him. He threatens to have them all arrested and hanged if they go near the stockade. Silver is not pleased and orders his men to attack. Every good pirate movie needs a swashbuckling sword fight scene, but it’s a little weird here. Walt was determined to get the movie a G-rating so people are flying backward from invisible bullets and staggering from bloodless cuts. I get why they staged it like this, it just looks kinda funky. Also, they need to fire their fight choreographer.\n\nTeam Good Guys wins but not before Silver shoots Smollett in the shoulder. This time there’s blood and everything! Livesy and Jim rush to work to save him, and Livesy gives Jim the map. He even uses the same exact line as Bones did at the beginning, about how it’s just a precaution. They assess their situation as Livesy patches the captain up. Six of the pirates are dead, which evens the numbers out a bit, but if the Hispaniola gets close enough to fire the cannons on the fort, they’re done for. That bleak pronouncement gives Jim an idea. He sneaks out of the stockade while the others are asleep. Using the little boat Ben Gunn showed up, he rows out and climbs aboard the Hispaniola. The worst sentries ever are below deck, drunk off their heads and fighting over the last few bottles of rum. While Jim goes to the helm to bring the ship away from the fort, one of the sentries staggers onto the deck with a bottle in tow. The other sentry, Israel Hands, hurls a knife at him despite being visibly (and bloodily) wounded and kills him. And they leave the body on screen! This is the same movie that showed people falling overboard because of invisible bullets!\n\nHands gets a musket from somewhere, Jim wrestles it away, and Hands appears to succumb to his wound. But he’s only pretending, and grabs Jim’s leg to get the gun back. The map falls out of Jim’s pocket, and that’s much more enticing. Jim gets it back and throws the musket into the water, then scrambles up the rigging. His leg gets caught in a line, and he pulls Silver’s pistol from his belt. Hands pulls another knife and throws it right into Jim’s shoulder, pinning the boy to the rigging. Jim almost makes the Bobby Driscoll crying face but not quite, and manages to give as good as he gets to boot. Our young child hero actually shoots Hands in the face!\n\nAs Hands sinks into the sea below, Jim rips the knife out of his own shoulder. Despite the injury, he climbs down and raises the Union Jack to signal that he’s successfully gotten the ship back. There’s another interminable Bobby Driscoll running montage as Jim stumbles back to the stockade. He stops to wash his wound… in swamp water. That helps about as much as you’d expect. To be fair, he’s like ten but still… that’s a swamp. You can probably smell that it’s loaded with grossness. Wash it in the sea, kid. It’s still loaded with grossness but probably not as much. Anyway, Jim finally makes it back to the fort and finds everyone asleep. He spies Doctor Livesy’s coat and goes to shake the man under it awake… but Silver pops up! There’s no scare chord, but his terrifying crazy eyes and the snarl of “MATEYYYYY” make it a really effective jump scare nonetheless. I certainly jumped! Jim is in no shape to cope with this and succumbs to his infection right into Silver’s chest.\n\nSilver immediately drops the mutinous psychopath act because his fatherly affection for Jim is genuine… though he does stop to take the map from Jim’s pocket. Before he can really take a look at Jim’s wound, Captain Flint the parrot squawks loud enough to wake everyone up. The pirates decide Jim must be dead from blood poisoning, and George Merry wants to stab him just to be sure he’s dead. Yet again, Silver reminds him that he is the captain and the captain says chill out and bring him clean water. Merry does it, but he’s not happy about having to take care of an injured enemy prisoner. Silver points out that Team Good Guys will easily give up the map in exchange for saving Jim’s life. Instead of going to get the doctor, Merry takes the rest of the crew outside for a pirate’s council. This gives Silver the chance to wash and bind Jim’s wound properly. He even drapes his own coat over the boy, which is almost sweet.\n\nJim wakes up and demands to know where everyone else is, but Silver doesn’t answer him. He climbs up the ladder (and with one leg, no less!) and sees the Union Jack flying over the Hispaniola. He knows he’s completely screwed. He yells for the doctor so Team Good Guys know they have Jim and he’s in trouble. Merry finishes up with the crew and they hand Silver the Black Spot… written on a page of the Bible. Silver does not give a rat’s behind about the Black Spot, and taunts them for ripping up a Bible because that’s a bad omen and they’re all idiots. Livesy answers the summons, but he won’t come any closer than the edge of the forest until he’s seen Jim. Silver agrees and takes him to the doctor, and Jim collapses literally the second he lays eyes on the doctor.\n\nLivesy gives Jim a bullet to bite as he patches him up. He asks Silver to give him some space, which he does, and immediately starts conspiring with Jim to get out of this mess in one piece. He points out that Silver has a genuine fondness for Jim, but Jim doesn’t buy it, saying the only reason Silver hasn’t already killed him is the map. But Silver reveals that he already has the map and still saved Jim’s life. He already knows it’s over, and offers to rejoin Team Good Guys if it means he doesn’t get hanged for piracy. Livesy, still concerned for Jim’s safety, asks the boy to run away but he’s given his word that he’ll stay put. The doctor gives in and tells Silver that if he doesn’t screw them over, he’ll try his best to save his life.\n\nAs part of his ploy, Silver makes it look like he successfully retrieved the map from Jim and wins back the pirates’ trust. He pretends to resign as captain, but the pirates (even Merry!) want him now that he has the way to get the treasure. They take the Black Spot and put it back into the Bible it came from, and the whole party heads out to find the treasure at long, long last. To keep up appearances, Silver carries Jim on a leash like he’s afraid he’ll run. Along the way, they come across a series of skeletons pointing the way like macabre arrows. Flint was just that kind of extra.\n\nAt long last, they find the X marked on the map. They descend on the spot with pickaxes and shovels and find…. nothing. George Merry has had about enough of this and pulls a gun on Silver. Silver is faster and pulls a bunch more guns out of hammerspace, killing Merry and a bunch of other pirates. He even throws his crutch at one of them which sounds like a bad plan. Livesy, Trelawney, Ben Gunn, and the rest of Team Good Guys show up to finish off the rest of the pirates. Ben Gunn, being a good dude, hands the crutch back to his old quartermaster as a peace offering. He cackles and reveals that he’s hidden all the treasure in his cave!\n\nWith that loose end tied up, Team Good Guys load the treasure onto a boat to take back to the Hispaniola. Smollett shames Silver, who is at least contrite, but he promises he’ll have a fair trial. Silver asks Jim to take care of his parrot, but Jim refuses because he can’t handle the memories or the guilt. Knowing he’s totally screwed, Silver goes “look, a distraction!” and steals back Jim’s pistol to threaten Trelawney and the others to jump overboard. He decides he’s going to take the little rowboat and the treasure to Jamaica because a fair trial is going to end in a hanging and screw that noise. He threatens to shoot Jim if he doesn’t help him shove off through the channel… but he’s too fond of the boy to pull the trigger. Jim shoves him off, and the rest of the honest sailors make it onto another boat to go get Jim. Silver is long gone, waving goodbye to Jim. And Livesy watches him go, lamenting losing him. But as Jim smiles and waves at the boat disappearing onto the horizon, the doctor almost hopes he makes it.\n\nThis is an almost word for word adaptation of one of my childhood favorite stories. Naturally, I’m going to approve most highly of the storyline. There’s a lot of time spent on the voyage and not a lot on the island, but again, the book does that too so I can’t be super mad about it even though I’d like to have the actual treasure hunt take more priority. The performances are solid all around, even Bobby Driscoll, and I found myself thoroughly entertained from beginning to end. It’s not my favorite adaptation of Treasure Island, but it’s very, very solid.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nJim Hawkins has been aged down from 15 in the book to around 10 here. That gives him a naïveté and innocence that adds a nice new layer to his relationship with Silver. He’s very gullible but learns pretty quickly not to trust pirates. That’s going to happen when you’re repeatedly double-crossed. He’s a crafty kid, not afraid to get his hands dirty, and way more enjoyable to watch than the last two Bobby Driscoll characters we saw. Driscoll himself has vastly improved as an actor, and it’s almost a shame that we’ll only see (or, rather, hear) one more performance from him before… things happen.\n\nLong John Silver steals the whole movie, tosses it in a long boat, and sails away to Jamaica. He’s that good. His craft and cunning make it impossible to look away, lest you miss what he’s going to do next. He’s by turns sweet and fatherly and ruthless and vicious, often in the same scene. Not for nothing is Silver considered one of the greatest literary characters of all time. A large part of what makes this incarnation of Silver so great is the truly stellar performance by Robert Newton. His exaggerated West Country British accent is so iconic that it’s still known as the “pirate voice”. That’s right, this guy invented talking like a pirate. Add that to the one leg and the parrot on his shoulder? Yeah, your stereotypical pirate is basically Robert Newton’s Silver. So a big “thank ye” to Robert Newton!\n\nCaptain Alexander Smollett is the no-nonsense, by-the-book captain of the Hispaniola. Even when things go sideways, it’s basically his level head and grace under pressure that save everyone’s bacon. It takes a bullet to the shoulder to bring him down, but by that point the pirates are basically eating each other anyway. Basil Sydney isn’t nearly as memorable as certain other Disney incarnations of the character but he’ll do.\n\nSquire Trelawney is a reckless dreamer with a lot of money and a lot of power. He gets ideas in his head and who cares about the consequences? So much would have been avoided if he knew how to keep his mouth shut or ask for references. Still, Walter Fitzgerald is a lot of fun to watch in the role, all loud and boisterous. He brings a lot of energy to a character who’s often left out entirely and it’s much appreciated.\n\nDoctor Livesy is the voice of reason that reigns in Trelawney’s crazy ideas. He’s not paid enough for this pirate nonsense and is basically only along to make sure Trelawney doesn’t get anyone killed. So he basically failed spectacularly at that. Still, it wasn’t his fault and he’s very sweet, always looking out for Jim when Silver’s off being terrible. Also I thought Denis O’Dea was cute so there’s that. Kind of reminded me of James Norrington from Pirates of the Caribbean: lawful good, earnest, goodhearted, little too uptight, the only straight man in an outlandish cast of characters. And I adore Norrington so it’s definitely a favorable comparison.\n\nBen Gunn is clearly suffering from some crazy PTSD. That, on top of five years of utter solitude, means he has a few screws loose. But his heart is in the right place and Jim would have been completely stuck without him. It’s very easy to go too over the top with this kind of character (looking at you, Martin Short), but Geoffrey Wilkinson does an excellent job of keeping the balance between comedic and tragic without completely ruining the tone of the movie (again, looking at you, Martin Short). This may not be my favorite version of Treasure Island but I think it’s my favorite version of old Ben Gunn. Good job, buddy. Hope you got that cheese.\n\nGeorge Merry is the only other really relevant pirate besides Silver. The dude needs to take about five chill pills. It’s his impatience and bloodlust that completely wrecks the pirates’ plans. And he’s warned about this time and again, but he thinks he knows better than Silver. Take a breath and stop trying to murder everyone, bro. Maybe you would have gotten that treasure and not, you know, died. Merry is played by Ralph Truman with some impressive crazy eyes and a great sense of menace.\n\nOne more interesting thing about the characters in this movie before we move along. There’s not a single woman on screen, besides a few random extras. Jim’s mother appears in the book and most other versions, but here she wasn’t even cast.\n\nARTISTRY\n\nWalt’s version was the first adaptation of Treasure Island to be filmed in color. To do such an auspicious milestone justice, Walt brought in cinematographer Freddie Young of Lawrence of Arabia fame. The result is a breathtaking journey on the high seas. A lot of pirate movies, especially recent ones, tend to be filmed in what feels like near total darkness. Not this one. This one is bright and vibrant and beautiful and really captures the spirit of adventure from the book. Critics praised the gorgeous Technicolor photography and I can certainly see why.\n\nMUSIC\n\nTreasure Island isn’t a musical, but it still has an excellent score courtesy of Clifton Parker. Every note is loaded with excitement and suspense that emphasizes the action just like a good score should. Is it the best pirate score ever? Of course not, nothing here is as iconic as Klaus Badelt’s He’s a Pirate. But it’s fun to listen to nonetheless. I want to make special mention of the instrumental version of “Fifteen Men on a Dead Man’s Chest” that plays over the end credits because that was awesome.\n\nTHEME PARK INFLUENCE\n\nphoto credit\n\nYou won’t find a whole lot of Treasure Island nowadays. However, in the early days of Walt Disney World, guests could take a boat from Fort Wilderness or the Contemporary to a relaxed wildlife sanctuary in the middle of Bay Lake. Original plans for Treasure Island included replicas of the Benbow Inn, the fort, and the inexplicably wrecked Hispaniola. When it actually opened, though, the only pirate theming was the wreckage of Captain Flint’s ship The Walrus at Shipwreck Point, a scavenger hunt for buried treasure, and the names of some of the locales. Guests could explore places like Captain Flint’s Perch, Black Dog Bridge, and Mutineer Falls as they encountered hundreds of species of rare and endangered animals. This incarnation of the island only lasted two years before the sanctuary was renamed Discovery Island and rethemed to emphasize ecology over adventure. In 1999, following the opening of the conservation-themed Animal Kingdom, Discovery Island was closed forever. The animals were moved to Animal Kingdom or other zoological parks, but the island still sits abandoned as a favorite haunt of urban explorers.\n\nI can’t find anything confirming or denying this, but I also have a sneaking suspicion making Treasure Island heavily influenced the creation of another, much more famous ride. Disney, of course, has a long and epic tradition when it comes to pirates. I can’t help but feel like Walt was inspired by the novel and Newton’s performance to begin plans for Pirates of the Caribbean. The characters in the ride all speak with the pirate accent created by Robert Newton, and the costumes wouldn’t be out of place among Silver’s cutthroat crew. This is all heresy, but I don’t think the idea is farfetched.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nTreasure Island was a fun and fanciful romp through one of my childhood obsessions. Watching this movie and doing this review made me feel twelve years old again. And isn’t that always a wonderful feeling? It told a classic story faithfully, which is all too rare in movies based on books, and the acting was truly great, especially from Robert Newton. I was a little worried about watching these old fifties movies because I often have a hard time following the acting style of the era and all the white guys tend to look the same. But I’m very pleased to say I didn’t have that problem here. It gives me hope for the rest of the older Disney live-action films!\n\nFavorite scene: Long John Silver plotting to kill Mr. Arrow and manipulating Jim into getting the rum to do it. It was such a great and chilling bit of manipulation, and I was living for it. Also during the funeral, Silver pronounces “amen” as “yaaaaar-men” and it’s hilarious."
