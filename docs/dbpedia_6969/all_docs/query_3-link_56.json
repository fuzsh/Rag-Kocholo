        "text": "Fifty years ago, Disney’s Mary Poppins had been firmly established as the highest-grossing movie of 1964, with a degree of cultural omnipresence that now seems all but unrecognizable—adjusted for inflation, its box office take works out to an astonishing $600 million. Ever since, it’s been so ubiquitous that it’s hard to regard it as an ordinary movie, much less as a work of art. Yet it’s wonderful in ways that have nothing to do with nostalgia, a witty, inventive blockbuster that feels almost like a more innocent extension of the work of Powell and Pressburger: it has the same technical ambition, depth of cast, and richness of design. For much of the last few weeks, its soundtrack has resided on my record player, and it delights me almost as much as it does our daughter. There isn’t a clunker in the entire score, and at least six of the songs by the Sherman Brothers are outright classics. (If the movie’s look and atmosphere were secretly shaped by the Archers, the music draws openly on Lerner and Lowe, and in retrospect, it feels like a natural bridge between My Fair Lady and its even more commercially spectacular successor, The Sound of Music.)\n\nYet its full legacy wouldn’t be felt for another four decades. In a sense, it’s the first unmistakable example of the business model that currently dominates Hollywood: the adaptation of an established children’s property, aimed squarely at all four quadrants of the public, with every resource of a major studio lavished on casting, art direction, music, and visual effects. For all its undeniable charm, it marks the beginning of a lineage that runs from Harry Potter through the Marvel Universe to The Hunger Games, with movie companies investing everything in tentpole franchises that stake much of the available money and talent on a single roll of the dice. Lionsgate is The Hunger Games, much as MGM is James Bond and the Hobbit franchise, and it’s no exaggeration to say that Disney was Mary Poppins for the years in which the movie was in production. The artistic legacy of Walt Disney, the man, is a mixed one, but there’s no question of his perfectionism or the demands he made on his creative team, and it shows. Mary Poppins cuts no corners, and it looks so good, with such attention to detail and so much money visible on the screen, that it makes most children’s movies seem cheap by comparison.\n\nIn other words, Mary Poppins was the original big bet, albeit one driven less by market calculation than by the obsessiveness of Walt Disney himself. (There’s a strong case to be made that its real impact has been even greater than that of Star Wars, which was a comparatively ragged production made in the face of active corporate interference.) And it stands as the culmination of everything the studio represented, in craft if not in content. It’s a repository of nifty tricks, both old and new: the gag with Mary Poppins rescuing her carpet bag from sinking into the cloudbank is lifted almost intact from the stork in Dumbo, as if an old hand on the Burbank lot, possibly Disney himself, had simply pitched a joke that he knew had worked well in the past. Mary Poppins is made up of a thousand little touches like this, and part of its magic is how seamlessly it synthesizes the work of so many craftsmen and disparate influences into something that seems so inevitable. The director, Robert Stevenson, was a capable journeyman who had worked with Disney for years—although not, confusingly, on Treasure Island—and if the result doesn’t bear much trace of his personality, there’s no doubt that he deserves much of the credit for keeping it so superbly organized.\n\nAnd audiences obviously responded to it, even if some critics were skeptical both of its departures from its source material and of the apparent reassurances it provided. Even at the time, many cultural observers felt that it offered nothing but a form of Edwardian escapism from current events, and a glance at the headlines from the year in which it was released—this was the summer of the Civil Rights Act, the Gulf of Tonkin incident, and the dawn of Beatlemania, with race riots erupting in Philadelphia the day after its premiere—creates an undeniable dissonance. Yet the same could be said of nearly every big movie in nearly every decade, and few have managed to carve out their own perfect worlds so beautifully. Mary Poppins is a little like the snow globe of St. Paul’s Cathedral that its title character holds as she sings “Feed the Birds”: closed, gorgeously rendered, and complete in itself. It’s the kind of movie that the major studios ought to be able to do best; it certainly couldn’t have been produced in any other way. And if few comparable films since have matched its grace and imagination, it still stands as an example of Hollywood’s potential, even for an industry that has always been run by the likes of Mr. Banks.\n\nYesterday I posted a list of my fifty essential books—that is, the fifty books that I would keep if I were deprived of all others. When I tried to do the same for movies, I found that the task was slightly easier, if only because I had fewer titles to choose from. (In both cases, I’ve tried to limit myself to books and movies that I actually own.) The result, as before, is a portrait of myself as expressed in other people’s works of art—which, in the end, may be the most accurate kind of self-portrait there is.\n\nAs usual, there are a few caveats. I’ve tried to be as honest as possible. This means omitting some of the very best movies of all time—The Rules of the Game and Tokyo Story, for instance—that I admire enormously but encountered too late for them to burrow into my subconscious. There’s an obvious preference for entertainment over art, as is generally the case in a home video library. And many of the movies named below might be ranked differently, or left out altogether, on another day (or hour). As of today, January 5, 2011, here’s how the canon looks to me:\n\n1. The Red Shoes (d. Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger)\n\n2. Chungking Express (d. Wong Kar-Wai)\n\n3. Blue Velvet (d. David Lynch)\n\n4. Casablanca (d. Michael Curtiz)\n\n5. The Third Man (d. Carol Reed)\n\n6. Eyes Wide Shut (d. Stanley Kubrick)\n\n7. L.A. Confidential (d. Curtis Hanson)\n\n8. Seven Samurai (d. Akira Kurosawa)\n\n9. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (d. Nicholas Meyer)\n\n10. Citizen Kane (d. Orson Welles)\n\n11. Vertigo (d. Alfred Hitchcock)\n\n12. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (d. Steven Spielberg)\n\n13. Lawrence of Arabia (d. David Lean)\n\n14. The Shining (d. Stanley Kubrick)\n\n15. A Canterbury Tale (d. Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger)\n\n16. The Empire Strikes Back (d. Irwin Kershner)\n\n17. The Last Temptation of Christ (d. Martin Scorsese)\n\n18. Inception (d. Christopher Nolan)\n\n19. The Silence of the Lambs (d. Jonathan Demme)\n\n20. Spellbound (d. Jeffrey Blitz)\n\n21. Mary Poppins (d. Robert Stevenson)\n\n22. 2001: A Space Odyssey (d. Stanley Kubrick)\n\n23. The Godfather (d. Francis Ford Coppola)\n\n24. Spirited Away (d. Hayao Miyazaki)\n\n25. Casino Royale (d. Martin Campbell)\n\n26. Fast, Cheap and Out of Control (d. Errol Morris)\n\n27. JFK (d. Oliver Stone)\n\n28. Barry Lyndon (d. Stanley Kubrick)\n\n29. Miller’s Crossing (d. Joel and Ethan Coen)\n\n30. Sleeping Beauty (d. Clyde Geronimi)\n\n31. Psycho (d. Alfred Hitchcock)\n\n32. Kill Bill Vol. 1 and 2 (d. Quentin Tarantino)\n\n33. The Untouchables (d. Brian DePalma)\n\n34. Raiders of the Lost Ark (d. Steven Spielberg)\n\n35. The Dark Knight (d. Christopher Nolan)\n\n36. Last Tango in Paris (d. Bernardo Bertolucci)\n\n37. Children of Men (d. Alfonso Cuarón)\n\n38. The Departed (d. Martin Scorsese)\n\n39. The Godfather Part II (d. Francis Ford Coppola)\n\n40. Crumb (d. Terry Zwigoff)\n\n41. The Searchers (d. John Ford)\n\n42. The Usual Suspects (d. Bryan Singer)\n\n43. The Long Goodbye (d. Robert Altman)\n\n44. Zodiac (d. David Fincher)\n\n45. The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (d. Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger)\n\n46. Boogie Nights (d. Paul Thomas Anderson)\n\n47. Taxi Driver (d. Martin Scorsese)\n\n48. The Limey (d. Steven Soderbergh)\n\n49. Dancer in the Dark (d. Lars von Trier)\n\n50. Pink Floyd The Wall (d. Alan Parker)\n\nRandom observations: I had to look up the names of two of the directors (for Spellbound and Sleeping Beauty). Up until a few minutes ago, the last place on this list was occupied by The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou, which I had to drop after realizing that I’d left out Last Tango in Paris. I allowed myself more than one movie per director, with the largest number of slots occupied by Kubrick (four), Powell and Pressburger (three) and Scorsese (three). And I’m slightly surprised to find that my three favorite movies of the last decade are evidently Spellbound, Spirited Away, and Casino Royale.\n\nSharp observers might be able to guess which film occupies the top spot in the list of my favorite movies of the past year, which I’m hoping to post later this week. And in any case, if you have a Netflix account that you aren’t using, well, hopefully this will give you a few ideas."
