        "text": "I have a confession to make, you guys. This spoonful of sugar has a little bit of a sour taste for me. When I was a kid, I was in a production of Mary Poppins with this nasty bully of a girl in the lead role and her horrible stage mom ripping the rest of us apart at every rehearsal despite not actually being part of the staff. I also sprained my wrist on opening night. Ever since that show, I’ve had a little beef with Mary Poppins. However, I fully acknowledge that none of this has anything to do with the movie itself whatsoever, so I’ll try to be objective when reviewing Walt’s magnum opus!\n\nDisclaimer: This blog is purely recreational and not for profit. Any material, including images and/or video footage, are property of their respective companies, unless stated otherwise. The authors’ claim no ownership of this material. The opinions expressed therein reflect those of the authors and are not to be viewed as factual documentation. All photos are from Animation Screencaps unless otherwise stated.\n\nAs we all know, Mary Poppins had no problems whatsoever and production was smoother than Michael Jackson’s criminal.\n\nHAH.\n\nI can’t even type that sarcastically.\n\nThe troubled production of Mary Poppins has become something of a legend among Disney fandom, largely because of Saving Mr. Banks outlining the drama. Walt Disney’s young daughters, Sharon and Diane loved the Mary Poppins series by P.L. Travers so much that they begged their father to adapt them. He tried to do just that way back in 1938, but Ms. Travers turned up her nose at some cartoonist getting his ink-stained hands all over her work. For twenty years after that, Walt kept the pressure on until finally, in 1961, Ms. Travers relented due to declining book sales. Of course, it couldn’t be that simple, so she had a few stipulations. She needed to approve the script (you’ll see her credited for this as a “consultant”). The music needed to be authentically Edwardian English. Romance between Mary Poppins and Bert was expressly forbidden (although honestly, I saw this in the books, so this makes no sense to me). And above all, there was to be absolutely no animation whatsoever.\n\nYeah, no.\n\nRoughly a year later, the film premiered at Grauman’s Chinese Theatre, the first premier Walt had attended since Snow White. Ms. Travers stormed up to him and demanded that he cut out the animation. Cool as a cucumber, Walt told her, “that ship has sailed” and walked away. The author famously left the premier in tears after seeing the rest of the audience give the film she so hated a standing ovation. She hated the finished product so much that she vowed Disney would never touch her work again (So they did. Twice). Later on, though, she cooled off enough to admit that it’s still an excellent movie, even if it wasn’t a faithful adaptation. She even allowed Cameron Mackintosh to use some of Disney’s songs in their musical adaptations on the stories, on the condition that no Americans be involved in the production. Well after she died in 1996, Disney jumped onto the project and co-produced one of their most popular Broadway musicals ever. Later on, Disney produced a sequel to the film Mary Poppins Returns, which I presume went a little easier than the original.\n\nNo matter how the author of the source material felt about it, Mary Poppins was a smash hit. Audiences and critics alike could not think of a single negative thing to say about the performances, the songs, the script, the visuals, or anything else. Despite being the most expensive movie produced by Walt Disney Pictures up to this point at between $4.4-6 million, this one actually turned a profit of $31 million! The Academy nominated the film for a staggering 13 Oscars, including Best Picture, and it won five of them as well as two Grammys (more on that later). Mary Poppins became the first live-action Disney movie inducted into the U.S. National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being “culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant”. It’s never been out of print and retains a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. This was Walt Disney’s crowning achievement, his magnum opus… one might even say it’s supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!\n\nSTORY\n\nAfter a gorgeous pan over Peter Ellenshaw’s dreamlike London and that brilliant silent introduction to our title character, we drift down to a lovely little park, where a street musician named Bert entertains the crowd. Fun fact, everybody Bert makes up a poem for is a character in the book! Some of them (notably Mrs. Corry) even get expanded roles in the musical! Suddenly, he stops. Something’s about to happen. Something big. I cannot possibly translate the change in Dick Van Dyke’s performance into words here. Right from the start, you know this is going to be good. And just in case that doesn’t draw you in, Bert breaks the fourth wall to lead us onwards to Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane, where all the magic happens.\n\nFirst, he stops to introduce us to Admiral Boom and Mr. Binnacle, two senile old men who think they’re fighting an eternal Naval battle and keep firing a cannon on the roof at precisely 6 AM and 8 PM because this street has no HOA. He warns Bert that there’s a storm brewing at Number 17, and sure enough, when we get there, the air itself is filled with monsters. Katie Nanna, created in a weird scientist’s laboratory from the skeletons of two women and the heart of a living girl, rushes down the stairs. Okay, not really, but she is played by Elsa Lanchester, who, if you don’t get my weird obscure references, played the Bride of Frankenstein. She declares that she’s quitting her job because the children she’s nannying have gone missing for the fourth time this week. What kind of monster doesn’t even try to look for someone else’s kids when they disappear?\n\nMrs. Brill, the cook (Reta Shaw, aka Tillie in Pollyanna. I was her in the disaster I mentioned in the cold open!), can’t wait to see the last of her. On the other hand, Ellen, the housekeeper (Hermione Badley, who we’ll hear from again shortly) begs her to stay, mostly so she doesn’t get saddled with these demon children. While the two domestics bicker, Mrs. Winifred Banks returns home in such high spirits, she can’t wait to tell everyone all about it. Winifred is a very passionate suffragette who spends all her time at rallies stirring up political change, which is a very noble cause except she’s so into it she has no room in her head for anything else. She won’t even listen to Katie Nanna announce she quits for about five minutes, nor does she seem particularly concerned about the missing children.\n\nHer whole attitude about “meek and mild subservients” flips around when her domineering husband returns home at 8 sharp. The cannon keeps track. This is, of course, the point. As passionately progressive as she is, George Banks is so aggressively traditionalist that he drowns her voice out. He calls the status quo “The Age of Men” and pays her just as little attention as she just paid Katie Nanna despite the gravity of their missing children. These aren’t villains, they’re just two very damaged people who don’t even realize they’re damaged. It’s high time for a little divine intervention. Finally, Winifred tells George they can’t find the kids and their nanny up and quit instead of looking for them, and George calls the police to organize a search party. As it turns out, there’s no need. The constable turns up and… wait a sec. Surely these doe-eyed babies begging their father to help fix their kite can’t be Jane and Michael, the monstrous little terrors who scared off six nannies within four months!\n\nOkay, maybe Jane is capable of being a monstrous little terror, but not in this movie. The adorable little moppets apologize for the trouble they’ve caused. They just wanted to catch their broken kite. George completely brushes off their plea for his help fixing it and sends them off to bed so he doesn’t have to deal with them. There’s no time for childish nonsense. He has important adult things to do, like draft a newspaper advertisement for a nanny who will act like a general and squeeze all that “fun” and “happiness” out of his children. Just as he finishes, Jane and Michael come down with an advertisement of their own, asking for someone who will be kind to them and play with them- basically someone who treats them like children. The plea fails to move Mr. Banks, who sends them away again and tears the letter up, dismissing his children’s needs as “ridiculous.” Little does he know the shreds of paper drift up the fireplace….\n\nDour old women line up at the door the next morning under the bitter east wind, candidates for the nanny position. One thing’s for sure: every one of them fits George’s idea of a nanny, not Jane’s and Michael’s. The cannon strikes 8 and George gets ready for the interviews. Just then, something strange happens. A huge gust of wind blows all the prospective nannies away! All of these “nannies” were stuntmen in drag, trained to do the flying stunts. Some of them might even be chimney sweeps later, but don’t quote me on that. Anyway, once the competition is out of the way, Mary Poppins herself drifts down from the sky with her flying umbrella, landing gracefully in the front garden like the goddess/fey/witch/Time Lord she is. She reads from the kids’ letter, not George’s, comes with no references, and basically just hires herself on the spot before George knows what hit him. Like a boss.\n\nThe kids’ jaws drop as Mary Poppins slides up the banister to meet them in the nursery, but the parents, of course, don’t see her magic. Winifred comes home to find her husband’s head in the fire, but at least he found a nanny quickly and put her to work. As confused as George is, he knows Mary Poppins will solve all their problems… just maybe not in the way he expected. Mary Poppins gets to work settling in and unpacking her things from her magical bottomless carpet bag, including a hatstand and an ornate, lit floor lamp! And a huge gold-framed mirror to replace the little spotty one in the nursery, of course. The carpet bag scene is one of several that Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber weren’t told about, so their astonishment is actually genuine.\n\nAll those incredible things come out of that bag, but it takes Mary Poppins a moment to find what she’s really looking for. Eventually, she fishes her tape measure out of the bottom and goes to have a look at the children. Of course, this is no ordinary tape measure- instead of showing the kids’ heights, it shows her exactly what she has to fix. Michael is “extremely stubborn and suspicious” (“I am not!”) and Jane is “rather inclined to giggle, doesn’t put things away.” As for Mary Poppins herself? “Practically perfect in every way,” of course! There’s no character arc necessary here. And I just realized that that’s the first time she’s introduced herself to anyone. She hired herself without even giving her employer her name. What a queen.\n\nNow that she knows what she’s dealing with, it’s time for their first game: cleaning the nursery. It doesn’t sound like much of a game, but of course, a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down! The sequence features some brilliant special effects work from X Atencio and Ub Iwerks that reminds me a lot of Babes in Toyland but vastly improved. It also introduces the world to a whole new technology, but I’ll get to that under Theme Parks. Most importantly of all, it’s the first time in we don’t even know how long when Jane and Michael are allowed to have some childish fun. Sure, their enthusiasm gets the better of them and traps Michael in a closet for a little bit, but it’s a start.\n\nWith the nursery clean, Mary Poppins sweeps the kids up for an outing to the park. We cut ahead of them, and our good buddy Bert greets us with the biggest smile. He’s a screever today, painting chalk pictures and loving every second. A very familiar shadow falls across one painting, and he falls over himself to sketch it. And the way his whole face lights up when he sees her and says her name is adorable. I know it’s not supposed to be romantic but they’ve got so much chemistry and Bert is so sweet I can’t help it okay? He notes that the park doesn’t seem good enough for his Mary so he acts out some of his paintings for the kids’ entertainment. Jane and Michael decide the world they’d like to see most of all is the lovely English countryside. With some cajoling from Bert, Mary Poppins takes everyone’s hands and jumps— right into the painting!\n\nThe art shift here is gorgeous, not just in the group’s new outfits but in the way the backgrounds turn to chalk. The animators outdid themselves creating this new world and making it look like the perfect place for a jolly holiday. The kids hear merry-go-round music and run down the road to the fair. Confident that they’re safe, Mary Poppins and Bert enjoy a stroll down the lane (and ride some turtles!) and lunch at a little diner with some penguin waiters. I’ve got to say: Bert created this whole world, where the inhabitants do nothing but sing Mary Poppins’ praises, and what does she have to say? “Forbearance is the hallmark of your creed”. Bert’s expressions when he gets friendzoned are priceless. But he drinks his respect women juice so he lets it be and dances with the penguins to impress her slash show off. It’s so charming and well-choreographed it’s easy to forget everything just came to a screeching halt!\n\nThe merry-go-round music draws closer and the two adults waltz over to rejoin Jane and Michael on the carousel. But Mary Poppins isn’t one to just spin in a circle. In the blink of an eye, the carousel horses break free and bounce over the road. The attention to detail in this sequence is so great the animators drew in little tracks in the road where the carousel poles dug into the dirt! Along the way, they encounter a fox hunt where a bunch of British dogs and animated humans terrorize a very Irish fox. Noooo unfortunate implications there. Happily, it turns out more progressive than expected when Bert rescues the poor thing and carries it over a hedge. All the dogs proceed to get stuck in the hedge and the fox goes free!\n\nOn the other side of the hedge, the group finds themselves participating in a horse race. Mary Poppins takes the lead just by asking because she’s just that awesome and of course ends up winning the race. What can one possibly say to such a glorious victory? Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, of course! It’s the perfect word for when you do don’t know what to say! Suddenly, a clap of thunder interrupts the lesson. Rain washes the picture away and returns our quartet to the real world. A little rain can’t wash away Bert’s sunny attitude- he just goes to sell hot chestnuts instead. As for Mary Poppins and the kids, it’s time to go home.\n\nWet weather can cause pneumonia in Movie Land, so Mary Poppins doles out some medicine to keep Jane and Michael healthy. But this is no ordinary medicine: when she fills the spoons, the liquid comes out in a different color and flavor for each of them! I would have thought it was done by splicing together different shots but apparently it was a working prop. Even cooler, once again, they didn’t tell the kids this was going to happen so when Jane screams in surprise, it’s 100% real! I wish medicine worked like this in real life. Have the makers of Airborne ever tasted an orange? Because that ain’t it, chief. The delicious medicine is the icing on the cake of a lovely day and the kids can’t bear to think that Mary Poppins might leave them one day. But she’s not one to leave the kids with illusions. She’s only here until the wind changes. What’s more, she acts as though their trip through the chalk painting never happened! The kids excitedly recount the whole thing, too excited to sleep until Mary Poppins sings them a lullaby.\n\nA very different Banks household meets us in the next scene. Winifred can’t wait to get going to throw eggs at the Prime Minister, Ellen and Mrs. Brill actually get along, and no one can stop singing! Only George retains his sour mood, though he tries to deny it. Such a stupid, meaningless word has no place in this house, and all this cheerfulness is giving him a headache. He knows exactly who’s behind all of these changes to his perfect world and goes on a tirade against Mary Poppins that even Admiral Boom’s cannon can’t distract him from. Little does he know she’s coming for him…\n\nFirst, Mary Poppins takes the kids with her to run some errands. Before they get very far a little dog named Andrew comes to warn Mary Poppins about… something. We don’t really know what’s going on yet but Mary Poppins speaks dog because of course she does. At one point in the scene, Andrew sneezes and Mary Poppins says “bless you” perfectly primly, which was actually ad-libbed! Dogs are so good. Julie Andrews is so good. The errands go straight to the back burner and Mary Poppins sweeps the kids off to a house in London where Bert waits to warn that the owner is “worse than he’s ever been.” But when they enter his home, they find Uncle Albert isn’t sick at all. He’s just laughing so hard he can’t breathe. Oh, yeah, and he’s flying around on the ceiling from laughing so hard. His mirth is so infectious that it sends Jane, Michael, and Bert straight to the ceiling with him.\n\nThough she thoroughly disapproves of their antics and has no problem showing it, Mary Poppins flies up to join them and brings a whole table laid for tea to boot. The following sequence seems to have very little purpose other than to let Ed Wynn and Dick Van Dyke play off each other and tell increasingly terrible jokes but it’s just so much fun it’s hard to mind. Besides, it does come back later so it’s not, strictly speaking, a Big Lipped Alligator Moment. And did I mention it’s hilarious? The only thing that can bring them down is to… well, bring them down. They have to think of something sad to get back to the floor, and nothing could be sadder than having to leave Ed Wynn behind.\n\nWhen George returns home, he’s in quite a mood. The kids’ noisy chatter about their tea party on the ceiling doesn’t help, so he sends the kids to bed and decides he’s going to put a stop to all this happiness. It’s so serious he stops Winifred from leaving the house and the servants stop to eavesdrop. George berates Mary Poppins for Jane’s and Michael’s heads with nonsense and taking them on outings that aren’t educational instead of training them up to grow up just like him. No one talks to Mary Poppins like that so she flips this right around to suggest that George take his kids to the bank with him tomorrow. That way they can learn about his work and the life he wants them to lead. With that, she disappears before he knows what he just agreed to.\n\nUpstairs, Jane and Michael are freaking out thinking Mary Poppins got fired but she doesn’t get fired. And man, I wish I could pull that. She tells them about their big day tomorrow, which, judging by their reaction, is the first time they’ve ever gone anywhere with their father. Poor babies. More than anything, Jane can’t wait to see the city, but there are things in the city that George Banks has never seen. And then we get Feed the Birds. And it is glorious. On the surface, it’s a lullaby about an old woman who sells birdseed in front of St. Paul’s Cathedral. But it’s so, so much more than that. It’s a beautiful metaphor about the power of kindness and compassion and how even a small thing like tuppence can mean everything to those in need. A whole army of onion chopping ninjas swarmed my bedroom.\n\nSure enough, when they get to the city, they spot the Bird Woman herself, crying out for someone to feed the birds. The Bird Woman, by the way, is played by Jane Darwell, a classic film actress who had long since retired to a nursing home. Walt Disney was such a big fan of hers that he personally picked her up to be a part of this, her final movie. Age and illness made her voice too feeble for the microphone to pick up so Robert B Sherman had to dub her one line. Ironically, Ms. Darwell actually outlived Walt by a few years. Michael finds tuppence in his pocket, but Mr. Banks refuses to let him spend it on something silly and frivolous like birdseed. He has something much more “interesting” in mind for those little coins. Ha. Puns.\n\nAt the Fidelity Fiduciary Bank, the children meet their father’s co-workers, a small group of decrepit and miserable old men. The most decrepit and miserable of all are the father and son team of Mr. Dawes Sr and Jr. George announces that Michael wants to open an account and invest his tuppence, ignoring Michael’s protests completely. The decrepit old man gang backs the kids into a wall trying to convince them to hand over the tuppence and, eventually, Dawes Sr just snatches them out of Michael’s hands. For some reason, stealing his money gets a negative reaction and Michael screams to get it back. Patrons outside hear the commotion and one gross misunderstanding later we have a run on the bank!\n\nThe bank scrambles to protect their assets and the kids run for it. They find themselves lost down a dark and spooky alley, mentioned by dogs and Cruella de Vil. I’m not kidding, the creepy old hag they run into is actually Betty Lou Gerson! After her, they run smack into a dark figure that scares them out of their wits, but it’s okay. It’s just Bert. Today he’s a chimney sweep, so he’s covered in soot, but he’s the same old friendly guy, happy to listen to their troubles. Once he hears their story, he tries to reassure them that their father loves them no matter what. They kind of doubt it. This calls for a new tack, so Bert drops the whole theme of the movie. The kids aren’t the only ones who needed to learn the power of fun and whimsy. Their father needs those lessons too, and the kids have the power to set him free. Not in those exact words, but that’s the gist of it. He offers to take them home, all while telling them how great it is to be a chimney sweep.\n\nWhen they get to Cherry Tree Lane, Bert plans on just dropping the kids off at home. But it’s Mary Poppins’ day off, and the servants have stuff to do, and Winifred can’t just look after her own kids for five minutes. The obvious answer is to pressgang this dirty homeless guy she doesn’t know into babysitting. Well, there go his plans for the night. He might as well clean up the chimney while he’s at it, so he waxes poetic about the amazing view he’s privy to as a chimney sweep. The “chimney sweep” world entices the children so much that they beg to be allowed to see it. Jury’s out on whether or not Bert has that power, but Mary Poppins does. The second she walks into the room, Jane and Michael shoot up the ceiling. The two adults follow because someone has to keep an eye on them as they explore the forest of chimneys that only the sweeps get to see.\n\nMary leads the way across the rooftops, even leading the group across a staircase made of billowing black smoke. None of this sounds particularly enthralling but Dick Van Dyke’s performance, the ringing orchestral music, and Peter Ellenshaw’s artwork really sell it. But as lovely as it is, it’s very cold, so it’s time to go home. As they head back, Mary Poppins and Bert sing a little duet about how much they enjoy each others’ company because they are Totally Not a Thing. Out of absolutely nowhere, dozens of chimney sweeps pop out of the most unlikely places to hang out with their best mate. And now we dance! For seven minutes straight! Like the penguin dance before it, the choreography is stellar and the energy is so high that it doesn’t drag at all. You completely forget that nothing is happening. The dance is that enthralling, and it’s all thanks to the brilliant choreography by Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood (who seems like a very cool old lady, judging by Prop Culture).\n\nAfter about seven solid minutes of fancy footwork, Admiral Boom starts shooting fireworks at the chimney sweeps. The visuals are quite nice even if the dialogue… isn’t. Bert smacks the fireworks back at them with his broom like a cricket bat, and the sweeps dive down the chimney to dance inside the Banks’ house. Ellen and Mrs. Brill freak out, resulting in one of the funniest parts of the movie (that sounds terrible when I say it like that but “AAAH! STEP IN TIME! had me laughing so hard I couldn’t breathe). Winifred comes home but quickly gets swept into the frivolity when these nice gentlemen start chanting “Votes for Women” along with them. And then George comes home.\n\nSensing that their brand of joyful chaos isn’t welcome here, the chimney sweeps (and very nearly Michael) file out, stopping only to shake George’s hand. This is yet another brilliant small detail that turns out to be vital in the finale. All that luck rubbed off onto him, making the entire rest of the movie possible… or at least that was my takeaway. His takeaway is that Mary Poppins just caused more chaos in his perfect orderly life but she just sasses off like the queen she is. “I never explain anything” indeed! But that’s the least of his problems. The telephone rings. It’s Mr. Dawes Jr. George tries to apologize for the bank run, but it’s no good. His boss demands that he come in after hours, and that can only mean one thing.\n\nTrue to form, George initially blames everyone but himself for the turn of events. Namely, Mary Poppins, who turned his whole orderly world upside down and tricked him into the whole disastrous outing in the first place. A little reverse psychology from Bert helps George finally realize the truth: these changes are for the better. He’s worked so hard for so long he’s missing his children’s whole lives. Jane and Michael creep downstairs to apologize for everything, and Michael hands over the tuppence that started it all. It’s a small gesture, but an infinitely meaningful one. The kindness finally melts Mr. Banks’s cold heart. We can actually see it happen, too, because David Tomlinson brought his A-game to this scene. It’s brilliant.\n\nThe following montage is even more brilliant. I can’t believe it used to bore me as a kid, because it’s phenomenal. George Banks walks slowly through a dark, foggy street. As he walks, he reflects on everything he just learned. He passes by the cathedral. He pauses, even gets the tuppence out of his pocket, but the Bird Woman isn’t there. It’s heavily implied that she died. The music swells into this stunningly powerful instrumental of Feed the Birds, almost like a choir of angels. He missed his chance to show her compassion, and now it’s too late. It’s so, so heavy for a family movie and I love it so much. That’s what’s so great about this movie: there’s something incredibly deep under all the frivolity. And now it’s all coming to a head.\n\nI’ll bring this back in Artistry but the shot when George arrives at the bank also really stood out. The decrepit old bankers glare at George, and Mr. Dawes Jr announces that this was the first bank run they’ve had since the Boston Tea Party. For the first time ever, George tries to respond with a joke. It falls flat and the bankers give him a long, melodramatic “cashiering” which is a pun I probably wouldn’t have gotten without reading other reviews. At the end of the ceremony, Dawes Jr asks if their disgraced fellow has anything to say for himself. And, as it happens, there’s a very good word to say when you don’t know what to say: Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!\n\nLaughter bubbles up as George basks in the relief of being freed from the responsibilities that shackled him for so long. Bert said the bank trapped George in a cage, but now he’s free to laugh and skip and even repeat one of Uncle Albert’s jokes! Naturally, all the bankers think he’s insane, but he doesn’t care. He’s completely carefree! He shoves the two magical tuppence that changed his whole life into Mr. Dawes Sr’s hand and skips out, singing Mary Poppins’ theme song off-key (and with slightly incorrect lyrics) the whole way. Everyone else wonders what just happened. Everyone, that is, except Mr. Dawes, Sr. He mulls over Mr. Banks’ joke for a moment, then the lightbulb goes off. He slowly starts laughing for the first time in a long time, maybe ever. This new lightheartedness makes him float right off the ground, just like Uncle Albert!\n\nThe banks’ frivolity doesn’t spread to the Banks’ house. In fact, everyone there is in a panic because George never came home, even going so far as to worry he killed himself! That line took me aback for a second, as I’d completely forgotten about it and let’s be real do you expect a suicide reference in a movie so deliriously joyful? Anyway, while Winifred and the servants fret and the constable makes his report, the kids cry for a different reason. The wind changed. Mary Poppins is packing to leave. Suddenly, George’s singing rings out from downstairs. He was in the basement the whole time! Winifred flings her arms around her husband in relief, and he responds by laying a big old smooch on his wife.\n\nBest of all, he has a surprise for the kids. He was in the basement all night repairing their kite! They race down when he calls them to see what he did for them. He loves them after all! As cute as it is, I can’t help wondering why it took him all night to glue some paper onto the tears in the kite. Oh, cynical adult eyes. Speaking of cynical, I’ve seen a lot of criticism of Winifred’s part in the frivolity, where she takes off her suffragette sash and ties it to the kite’s tail. People, including noted ray of sunshine P.L. Travers, criticize this as abandoning a good cause to be a better wife and mother. Honestly, I can kind of see that, but as so little time is spent on Winifred, I prefer to see it as Winifred learning the same lesson as George. She doesn’t have to completely abandon her work with the suffragette movement to spend more time with her kids. She just shouldn’t completely abandon her kids in favor of the suffragette movement, that’s all. Balance is important.\n\nReunited at last, the Banks family skips outside to fly the kite. It’s the first time the parents have ever stopped their busy life to play with the kids, and you can tell how much it means to everyone. It’s adorable. And when they get to the park, the whole place is full of people flying their own kites with huge smiles on their faces! Maybe it’s because Bert decided to sell kites today. It’s hard not to smile with that guy around. Among the crowd, George spots Mr. Dawes Jr and the other bankers- minus one. It seems the joke George told last night caused Mr. Dawes Sr. to die laughing! That sounds terrible, but his son doesn’t mind. He got to see his father happy, and that means everything to him. It means so much, in fact, that Dawes Jr. offers George his job back! I assume the hours won’t be quite as long this time. Probably.\n\nOnly one character stays away from the kite-flying festivities. Mary Poppins finishes packing up her magical carpet bag and makes her way onto the doorstep, looking back at the house for the last time. Her parrot-headed umbrella reveals out of nowhere that it can talk! It notes how much the kids love their parents like it’s a bad thing, which of course, it isn’t. Her whole reason for coming was to reignite the Banks’ love for each other, not for the kids to love their nanny like a parent. Still, her eyes grow rather misty even she assures the parrot that she feels no sentiment whatsoever. Still, she doesn’t say goodbye or even glance back at the family. She just opens her umbrella and takes off into the sky to do whatever it is goddesses/fey/witches/Time Lords do during their time off. Bert waves goodbye and asks her not to wait 54 years before she regenerates into Emily Blunt.\n\nIt’s amazing how much better this movie is watching it as an adult. Sure, as a kid, all the magical adventure stuff is loads of fun and the music’s great, but the third act always bored me because I didn’t understand the bank stuff. Now, I can see just how well everything fits together. Cleaning the nursery shows the importance of seeing the positive side of things, the chalk drawing opens up the kids’ eyes to the power of imagination, and Uncle Albert teaches the value of a good strong laugh. Once the kids learn these lessons, they can pass them along to their father along with a good strong dose of kindness. It seems episodic on the surface, but when you analyze it, it’s not episodic at all. Everything ties together and pays off in George’s redemption.\n\nThere’s literally nothing in this movie that doesn’t work. The characters are multi-faceted, complex people who are fascinating to watch, the performances are stellar all around, the music is incredible. It looks great, it sounds great, it is great. It’s not my favorite Disney live-action film for reasons mentioned above, but none of that says anything about the quality. The only minor criticism I can even come up with is the run time, and even then I can’t think of anything I’d cut! P.L. Travers may have hated it but 56 years of positive reviews can’t be wrong. This really is Walt’s crowning achievement.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nMary Poppins really is practically perfect in every way. Despite her strict, no-nonsense exterior she really does care for these kids in a way they’ve never really known by the beginning. That’s not even going into the way she melts around Bert (stop booing me, I’m right). She’s much sweeter than her book counterpart, one of many things that P.L. Travers took issue with, but I don’t think her book persona would have worked on screen. This isn’t the kind of movie where an unsympathetic title character would work. Walt made the right call in creating the perfect mix of “sugar” and “medicine”. She’s one of the very few live-action characters with the same iconic, mascot-like status as Mickey Mouse or Jiminy Cricket.\n\nIn the early stages of production, Disney considered actresses like Hayley Mills, Mary Martin, and Bette Davis for the part. Once he saw Julie Andrews play Guinevere in Camelot on Broadway, however, that was it. Walt met up with her backstage to offer her the part of Mary Poppins, but she had to decline because she was pregnant. Walt wanted her so badly he waited until she had her baby to start production! Around the same time, producer Jack Warner was working on a film adaptation of My Fair Lady, in which Julie Andrews played the lead on Broadway. Thinking his film needed more star power, he passed her over and cast Audrey Hepburn as Eliza Doolittle (at least he had her singing dubbed, unlike some people in musicals nowadays…). Julie Andrews had the last laugh, though. Her very first performance on film won her an Oscar for Best Actress, while Hepburn wasn’t even nominated!\n\nBert is a precious baby angel and I love him so much. He’s the antithesis of everything George Banks represents at the beginning of the story: a poor grown-up kid who hops from job to job as he pleases, never letting his low class get him down. I didn’t notice what perfect foils the two male figures are until this viewing, but it works so well from a storytelling perspective. It’s his happy-go-lucky nature that helps remind Jane and Michael how to be kids and his unique perspective that helps finally bring George back to his sense. That pivotal scene after George gets fired wouldn’t work as well with strict, stern Mary Poppins. It had to be Bert, with his childlike wonder, wearing his heart on his sleeve.\n\nThere’s only one part of Bert that isn’t completely genuine: that accent. Dick Van Dyke has apologized profusely for “the most atrocious Cockney accent in the history of cinema”. Apparently J. Pat O’Malley, who sported a Cockney accent in The Wind in the Willows and Alice in Wonderland, coached him on his accent, which really wasn’t any better because O’Malley was Irish. Why did none of the actual British people in the cast correct him? I don’t know. But Van Dyke’s natural charm and warmth more than make up for it. Walt was a big fan of The Dick Van Dyke Show, where he showcased his comedic talents. And I learned something about him while researching that completely blew my mind. While Dick Van Dyke had a background in mime and acrobatics, he’d never danced before! He’d never danced before! He rocks the penguin dance and Step in Time and he’d never danced before!!!!\n\nIncidentally, while reading the script for the role, Dick Van Dyke thought the part of Mr. Dawes Sr. was so funny that he just had to have it. He offered to do it for free, but Walt made him audition and only gave it to him in exchange for a donation to his newest pet project, The California Institute of the Arts. What sold it was his stepping-down routine, which Walt found so funny he built a six-inch riser on the bank set just so he could include it in the movie. Neither of the actors playing the kids knew it was him, either, so they spent the whole sequence thinking he was just going to keel over. Oh, and his posh British accent as Dawes Sr. is completely fine.\n\nGeorge Banks is the real protagonist of the movie, which is a really clever thing from the screenwriters that a lot of people don’t pick up on as kids. I know I didn’t! It makes so much sense, though. He goes through such a strong character arc that you want him to be better, even though he’s not super likable at the beginning. You never really hate him, but he’s very cold and careless. Even worse, he’s more set in his ways than George Darling before him to the point where he dismisses his wife’s passions and ignores his kids completely. We want him to be better for his kids’ sakes until we see him at the bank and learn what he has to deal with. Then we just want him to be saved. David Tomlinson does a magnificent job of showing all these different sides of his character, making it abundantly clear that he’s not a bad guy all the way up until he’s finally liberated at the end. I can’t wait to see more of him as we move down the list. He also voiced Mary Poppins’ umbrella!\n\nWinifred Banks doesn’t get as much focus as her husband, which is a real shame because she goes through a very similar arc. She at least attempts to care for her children, but she’s too ditzy and distracted to do a great job of it. Her passion for the suffragette movement is admirable and never made to feel like the problem. Rather, she’s ignorant of her female servants’ unhappiness and borderline neglectful of her kids until she rediscovers her love for them thanks to Mary Poppins. Part of the problem is her redemption gets glossed over really fast, to the point where it can be read as something else entirely. When she ties her sash on the kite’s tail, it doesn’t have quite the same effect as George playing with his kids while getting his job back. They also make a point that her passionate feminism is all performative, as she folds to her domineering husband the second he walks into the room every time. We see them as equals at the end but barely, and that could also have been fixed with one line. That said, she’s very entertaining and does a lot with a little screen time.\n\nGlynis Johns returns to Disney after quite a long break. The Sword and the Rose and Rob Roy feel like an eternity ago! She initially thought she’d been cast as Mary Poppins herself and was rather disappointed when they told her she was going to be Mrs. Banks. However, she was a good sport about it and agreed to do it on the condition that she got a song. In full earshot of The Sherman Brothers, Walt loudly proclaimed that they were working on a great new song. I guess Johns missed the “wink wink nudge nudge” and she got her song so all’s well that ends well! This was her final movie with Disney, though she kept working all the way up until 1999.\n\nJane and Michael Banks function kind of like a composite character. That could be a real negative… if it was their story. But it’s not. In fact, they’re pretty minor characters compared to the growth their father goes through. Jane is the more sensible one and Michael pretty much exists to make goofy faces, but they’re kids. They don’t need to be more complex than that to make this story work. They break your heart every once in a while with little hints of how little they know their parents and warm your heart as their situation gets better, and that’s what they need to do. I do wish they had a little more meat because Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber don’t get nearly as many chances to show off their chops as they did in Thomasina. However, this is a larger cast and they’re more minor roles, so it’s fine for what it is.\n\nMUSIC\n\nThe soundtrack to Mary Poppins is widely considered to be The Sherman Brothers’ best work in a long career of really, really fantastic work. Despite P.L. Travers’ insistence that they only use Edwardian folk songs, they spent about two years writing original songs based on their personal experience. Irwin Kostal (famous for both the musical and movie West Side Story as well as A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum) worked in tandem with the Shermans to work their melodies into the score as different characters’ leitmotifs. His piece-de-resistance is that gorgeous orchestra arrangement of Feed the Birds that I waxed poetic about earlier, but the whole score is brilliant. Several more songs were written but cut including Land of Sand and The Beautiful Briny, which I’ll talk about a little later down the line.\n\nSister Suffragette was adapted from an introduction song for Mary called Practically Perfect (no relation to the one in the Broadway show) specifically so Glynis Johns would join the cast. It celebrates protest songs like the ones real suffragettes would have sung which, semi-incidentally, were coming back into vogue thanks to bands like The Beatles protesting the Vietnam War. It really shows how much work the Sherman Brothers put into this soundtrack, mentioning historically accurate details like Emmeline Pankhurst, founder of the Women’s Social and Political Union in Manchester. Also arsonist. But this is Disney, we don’t talk about that.\n\nThere are two lines to this song that I wanted to talk about, one for a good reason and one for a bad one. Let’s start with the bad one. In her fight for social justice, she declares that women will be “no more the meek and mild subservient.” Well, she spends the entire rest of the movie being nothing but that. This could very well be intentional, showing that she’s so deep into the movement that she can no longer see the trees for the forest, but they never follow up on it. She defers to George in everything and even talks down her own abilities, making that line feel a little misleading. I don’t think she needed to stand up to her husband, but as I said, it would have been nice to see her and her husband on more equal footing towards the end.\n\nThe line that I really like from a character perspective is “our daughters’ daughters will adore us”. This is Winifred’s character introduction of course, but this line, in particular, establishes everything we need to know about her as a mother. Sure, your daughters’ daughters will be grateful, but what about your daughter? You’re missing her entire life. You’re skipping over her well-being completely in favor of a hypothetical. It perfectly described what I mentioned earlier: Winifred can’t see the trees for the forest. Look at the big picture, sure, but don’t miss out on the little things.\n\nThe Life I Lead and its first reprise, A British Nanny, introduce George Banks’s character in almost exactly the same way Sister Suffragette introduces his wife’s. He even ignores her exactly like she ignores Katie Nanna when both women have important things to tell them. He views his family as “subjects” and himself as a “lord”, which anyone can see is toxic but not really his fault. I’m skirting dangerously close to rhetoric I don’t like very much but the gist of it is, George Banks is the victim of the very system he spends the whole song lauding. You can see it from the beginning if you know where to look.\n\nAs far as musical composition goes, this song reminded me a lot of Henry Higgins’ pieces in My Fair Lady, which is to be expected given that whole thing about Julie Andrews. Listen to Why Can’t The English? and this back to back. They sound almost identical. The pompous, exaggerated patter song marches to an almost militaristic rhythm, telling us even the instrumentals how regimented George Banks’s life is. I’ve frequently waxed poetic about the power of music to tell a story, and The Sherman Brothers harnessed it to great effect in this song especially.\n\nThe Perfect Nanny introduces the kids and acts as their leitmotif. It’s very sweet and genuine, contrasting with Katie Nanna calling them beasts until they actually show up. They’re not beasts, they just want someone to be nice to them. It absolutely breaks my heart when they require their nanny to “love them as a son and daughter”. Their own parents don’t love them as a son and daughter at this point and that’s the tragedy of the whole movie. Once again, the song reminds us of how little George even considers his children’s emotional needs. He even responds sarcastically when they call themselves adorable! Rude. Fortunately, they get their perfect nanny, but their song really makes you feel for their terrible situation.\n\nA Spoonful of Sugar replaced a sappy love song for Mary Poppins and Bert called The Eyes of Love because Julie Andrews felt like it wasn’t catchy enough. Instead, Mary Poppins’ leitmotif becomes an ode to the power of positive thinking and making the bests of bad situations, whether it be cleaning your room or getting fired from your job. To keep it from being too obnoxiously sweet, the music uses the same brassy, almost militaristic sound the parents’ songs have, showing that Mary Poppins herself does have her strict side. I really like the juxtaposition now that I’m listening for it. After The Eyes of Love got cut, the Sherman Brothers looked to their own lives for ideas on its replacement. Robert B Sherman remembered the time his son got his polio vaccine. Thinking it was administered as a shot, he asked his son if it hurt, but they just dabbed the liquid vaccine onto a sugar cube for him to swallow. So, back in the day, they literally gave kids a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down!\n\nJolly Holiday really makes me question whether they actually cut out any inkling of romance between Mary Poppins and Bert or not. Seriously, they’ve got that whole verse that’s like “you’re such a good friend” but as I said, Bert designed this whole world to shower her in compliments. He tries so hard and she really seems into it. I kinda feel bad for him, but he gets some minor vindication when he outlines all the other women he’s presumably dated (though Mary Poppins is still “tip of the top”, of course).\n\nThe Sherman Brothers borrowed from popular Music Hall pieces popular in 1910 to help create the setting, capturing an authentic Edwardian feel without giving in to P.L. Travers’ demand to only use real Edwardian work. Personally, I like the final result better. The penguin dance part drove animators Frank and Ollie Thomas crazy, because every time they thought they had their penguins animated perfectly, one of his flying feet would nail it in the head! The end result is delightful, but animating around that dance cannot have been easy.\n\nSupercalifragilisticexpialidocious existed as a word before this movie, contrary to popular belief. Reports of a very similar word meaning “all that is grand, great, glorious, splendid, superb, and wonderful” appeared in an issue of a Syracuse University document as early as 1931. Also, each syllable has its own individual meaning: “super” means above, “cali” means beauty (ayyy!), fragilistic roughly means “delicate”, expiali means “to atone”, and docious means “educable”. All together, that means that this nonsense word would mean “atoning for educability through delicate beauty” which seems like an odd thing to say after a horse race. Mostly, The Sherman Brothers remembered hearing it at summer camp and thought it was a delightful word for kids to share that adults wouldn’t recognize. It seems the general public agreed, as the song hit number 66 on Billboard’s Top 100. Also, if I never have to type this word again, it’ll be too soon.\n\nStay Awake was Julie Andrews’ favorite song in the film, to the point where she wrote a long letter begging for it not to be cut. I can’t agree with that one. More than any other song on the soundtrack, it slows things down and drags, plus it comes right between two fun, upbeat numbers which makes it really stick out. It works as a lullaby but lacks the emotional punch of the other lullaby on the soundtrack. I like to say that most movie musicals have a “Cheer Up Charlie”, a slow ballad that stops all the magic and wonder dead in its tracks. It’s pretty on its own but as part of this film I could skip it.\n\nI Love to Laugh exists so Ed Wynn can show off and it is glorious. Sure, Uncle Albert is in the book and the scene is pretty accurate, but let’s be real, it’s an Ed Wynn vehicle. The puns and jokes are appallingly bad but everyone’s having so much fun it’s impossible not to crack a smile during it… unless you’re Mary Poppins. Her look of utter disapproval is funnier than the jokes. At first glance, it’s kind of a Big Lipped Alligator Moment, but it comes back in the climax in such a big way that it’s so satisfying. And did I mention it’s hilarious?\n\nA British Bank doesn’t have much to it. It’s another reprise if The Life I Lead, intercut with some skillful reverse psychology from Mary Poppins. You can see her pushing George Banks towards becoming a more loving father, though the melody still sticks to his leitmotif. She plays along and sings his tune, but that will all change when we revisit this melody.\n\nFeed the Birds has become something of a legend among Disney fans. Most people know it was Walt’s favorite song, to the point where he used to call The Sherman Brothers up to his office every Friday and tell them “Play it.” That was all. Just “play it.” They knew exactly what to play. Then he’d look out the window, smile, and say “That’s what it’s all about.” Even after his death, the Sherman Brothers used to go up to his office every day just to play this song. And there’s another story about this song that brought me to tears. Long after Walt’s death, Disneyland held a ceremony to dedicate the Partners statue. As part of the festivities, Richard Sherman played a few songs including Walt’s favorite. During the song, a little bird flew down from the sky, listened, and disappeared into the heavens. Sherman still believes it was Walt, come to hear his song one last time.\n\nQuite apart from all the Disney fandom feelings, I think this is my favorite song on the soundtrack, too. It’s got such a beautiful, simple message that ties together all the lessons about kindness, humility, and charity that tie the whole movie together. The orchestral versions played throughout the score are even more powerful, especially that swell when we see the Bird Woman’s empty place on the steps. It’s not just a lullaby, it’s not just a bedtime story. It’s everything. Unfortunately, its immense popularity hurt the real birds of St. Paul’s cathedral. So many people took Mary Poppins’ advice that the whole cathedral ended up with a rather disgusting coat of white paint and London outlawed feeding the birds. That’s not the note I want to leave this section on, so here’s a happier fact. This was the only song in the film that P.L. Travers liked!\n\nFidelity Fiduciary Bank strongly resembles a Gilbert and Sullivan aria with all its long words and steady rhythm. Some classify it as a villain song which I don’t think is fair, since the bankers prove later that they’re not so bad. Even if it’s not a villain song, it’s still a fun and underrated piece that provides some sharp satire of British colonialism and industrialization. The mechanical choreography and the little triangle “dings” in the instrumentation give it that extra little touch of pretentiousness.\n\nChim Chim Cher-ee won Best Song at the 1964 Oscars and I can’t help but wonder… why? Not that it’s a bad song because it’s probably my second favorite, but… really? This over Feed the Birds or Supercali, which got onto the Billboard charts? Oh well. Bert repeats his leitmotif several times throughout the movie before it actually shows up as a full-blown song. It contrasts with Mary Poppins’s, George’s, and Winifred’s in every possible way. Where their songs are in a major key, his is in a minor key. Where they have military-sounding marches, he has a breezy waltz. Bert is the spirit of fun and life and free spirit, the final piece of the puzzle that Mary Poppins can’t provide for the family.\n\nThe Sherman Brothers took inspiration from a little sketch of a chimney sweep screenwriter Don DaGradi drew for… some reason. They also looked to a rather bittersweet British folk legend. Chimney sweeps in the old days lived tragically short lives thanks to all the carcinogens they breathed in all day. When you shook hands with one, people said they gave you all the luck they didn’t have for themselves. Poor Bert.\n\nStep in Time walked so Portobello Road can run… and run… and run… Seriously, this number is SO LONG, but as I said in Story, it’s hard to imagine Mary Poppins without the dancing chimney sweeps. The number’s so high energy and fun that it never gets boring (unlike its successor but we’ll get there when we get there), though personally if I were on the editing team I would consider cutting the fireworks. The song took inspiration from a classic pub song called Knees Up Mother Brown, which was written in 1918 and sung often around World War II. They missed the Edwardian feel by a few years but it’s a great song anyway.\n\nA Man Has Dreams completes Mr. Banks’s character arc. It starts as a slow, self-pitying reprise of The Life I Lead before Bert weaves in Mary Poppins’ theme to hammer home all the lessons the kids have been inadvertently trying to teach. Finally, he learns to see the other point of view with help from his perfect foil. Juxtaposing The Life I Lead with A Spoonful of Sugar to show the exact moment where George has his change of heart is a masterstroke.\n\nLet’s Go Fly A Kite is so completely different from The Life I Lead that you know from the first note everything’s going to be all right. It’s the only time where George Tomlinson actually sings instead of doing that Henry Higgins patter song thing, it’s in a major key instead of a minor key, and it’s a waltz instead of a march. Hey— who else do we know whose leitmotif is a waltz? Our old buddy Bert, now a kindred spirit with George instead of his opposite. It’s the culmination of everything we’ve been working towards all movie, making it a beautifully satisfying ending. The inspiration for this one is two-fold: first, Mary Poppins appears on the end of a kite in the second book and secondly, the Sherman Brothers’ father was an amateur kite maker who used to make them for the neighborhood children.\n\nARTISTRY\n\nLike several films before it, Mary Poppins was filmed entirely on soundstages in the Walt Disney Studios. This time, they didn’t rehash the same neighborhood settings and call it a day. Peter Ellenshaw created more than one hundred matte paintings to create the illusion that they were really in London. You can tell they’re paintings, but it doesn’t detract from the film’s beauty at all. Rather, it gives everything a sort of dream-like quality that adds to the story’s whimsical, magical feel. My favorite paintings are the ones in the chalk drawing- the backgrounds actually look like chalk! It’s a brilliant touch.\n\nSpeaking of the chalk drawing, the animation here is easily the best of the ‘60s, possibly the whole Xerography era. The scratchy black lines are barely visible and the live-action actors are seamlessly integrated into this animated world. Ub Iwerks modified the Technicolor camera used to mix live-action and animation in previous endeavors to help the sodium-vapor process. We’ve seen this process before in The Parent Trap, where it was used to hide the special effects, but this was a whole new level. Adding a prism to the camera allowed the studio to separate the brown screen background from the colors on the actors, making it seem that these actors are really in this world. Unsurprisingly for a film that went that far towards improving technology and included so many brilliant flying effects, Mary Poppins was nominated for an Oscar for Best Visual Effects. Surprisingly, it lost to Cleopatra.\n\nTHEME PARK INFLUENCE\n\nphoto credit\n\nMary Poppins in the theme parks is made up of a whole lot of “used to be”s and “almosts.” One of the highlights of Hollywood Studios’ dearly departed, sorely missed Great Movie Ride was a trip to the rooftops of London to sing Chim Chim Cher-ee with Mary and Bert. I don’t know if this is true or not, but someone once told me that Dick Van Dyke bought his animatronic and set it on his front lawn. I’m choosing to believe this because it’s just too funny not to be true. Also in Florida, Disney announced at D23 2019 that they would be building some sort of Cherry Tree Lane attraction in the UK Pavillion at Epcot. Whether or not this actually happens remains to be seen, but as the ground had not yet broken before the pandemic slashed budgets, my hopes are not high. If it does happen, I’d really like to see them go back to some of the ideas from the project Tony Baxter pitched that got him hired at Disney Imagineering. I doubt it at this point, but it’d be cool.\n\nAs far as things that actually exist go, Mary Poppins is a common meet and greet character in most of the parks. If you’re lucky, she’ll be accompanied by one of her penguin waiter friends. If you’re really lucky, in California, or at Mickey’s Very Merry Christmas Party, she’ll be accompanied by Bert, who is a precious ray of sunshine. Judging purely by observation and not objective fact, his friends seem to be coached on a Dick Van Dyke accent and not a real Cockney one, which is a really nice touch. Either that or said friends are just as bad at the accent. The couple (because they are a couple) frequently appear in parades and shows, such as Soundsational at Disneyland and Once Upon a Christmastime at the Magic Kingdom.\n\nDisneyland’s Main Street U.S.A. features a small quick-service restaurant called the Jolly Holiday Bakery and Cafe that serves up sandwiches, pastries, and breakfast foods. References to the film are subtle but include stained glass penguin windows, silhouette art of Mary Poppins and the Banks kids, and mosaic chalk drawings on the floor. Disneyland’s King Arthur Carousel has a special horse called Jingles that was rededicated as the Mary Poppins horse, complete with a parrot-headed umbrella on the saddle blanket and a robin painted on his horseshoes. Lastly, though this isn’t strictly Mary Poppins related, Walt Disney World’s Main Street U.SA. has some suffragette characters that walk around and interact with guests. Every so often you can catch them singing Sister Suffragette!\n\nOn a more meta example, Mary Poppins introduced the world to an invention that changed the theme parks forever. Sure, an attraction featuring this technology opened before the film, but the Audio-Animatronic robin in Mary Poppins was built and filmed first. As this was one of the first Audio-Animatronics ever, the technology wasn’t yet perfected and Julie Andrews had yards of wires running up her sleeve to control it. However, by the time the film opened, The Enchanted Tiki Room had already been in operation for over a year. The 1964 New York World’s Fair opened before Mary Poppins debuted, too, introducing the world to such classic Audio-Animatronic attractions as Great Moments With Mr. Lincoln, Ford’s Magic Skyway/The Peoplemover, The Carousel of Progress, and the irrepressible, inescapable, unforgettable It’s a Small World. Oh, and the profits from Mary Poppins allowed Walt to start buying up a few acres of swampland in Florida. No big deal.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nI told you my beef with this movie had nothing to do with the movie! It’s not one I come back to often because it brings back memories of being bullied and getting hurt. When I make an effort to push past that, what I see is really, really impressive. The story has so many incredible layers and the production value is the highest it’s ever been. It even brought me to tears more than once! Anything negative I have to say is the most minor of nitpicks. It’s not really my cup of tea but even then, I have nothing but good things to say about what’s actually on screen.\n\nFavorite scene: The shot of Mr. Banks looking at the empty cathedral steps. The Bird Woman died, you guys. The Bird Woman died. I can’t remember the last time I saw such subtle, powerful emotion on film."
