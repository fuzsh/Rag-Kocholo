        "text": "Dance\n\nRoslyn Sulcas\n\nYou might feel, along with Yaron Lifschitz, the artistic director of CIRCA, the nouveau cirque troupe coming to the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts on Thursday, that circus is — as he put it in an article last year — generally “cluttered with lycra and smoke machines.” (Not to mention all those animals and clowns.) Instead Mr. Lifschitz offers his streamlined ensemble of seven in simple body tights, doing far-from-simple things with their bodies to a soundtrack that includes Sigur Ros, Leonard Cohen and Jacques Brel. There are hoops and ropes and sticks, but mostly there is just astonishing physical mastery. Sequences possess a poetic resonance that brings these performances closer to dance than to the big top. 8 p.m. Thursday through Saturday, 566 La Guardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (866) 811-4111, skirballcenter.nyu.edu; $25-$45. Through March 6.\n\nIf you’re looking for something sooner, Sunday is the last day of the photographer Nan Melville’s “DANCE UNFRAMED,” an exhibition that features not just ballet stars like Darcey Bussell, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Diana Vishneva and Carlos Acosta, but a far-flung range of dance and dancers across the globe. Ms. Melville, who has been photographing dance for over two decades (sometimes for The New York Times), captures the intricate physical calligraphy of the Nrityagram Dance Ensemble, the exuberance of the Mark Morris Dance Group and the excitement at the International Ballet Festival in Havana last year. 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., JMC Custom Framing and Art Gallery, 674 Ninth Avenue, at 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 977-8877; free.\n\nTheater\n\nBen Brantley\n\nSports are generally better described than played in the theater. (Even Broadway’s biggest barn can’t accommodate a football field.) But the boxing ring, a conveniently sized stage unto itself, has proved irresistible to playwrights in recent years. Following the nose-breaking path of Richard Maxwell’s “Boxing 2000” (first produced in New York in 2000) and Roy Williams’s “Sucker Punch” (seen in London last year) comes Bryony Lavery’s “BEAUTIFUL BURNOUT,” which opens this week at St. Ann’s Warehouse in Brooklyn. The arrival of “Burnout,” which was conceived and directed by Scott Graham and Steven Hoggett, is a spiritual homecoming of sorts, since the show is partly inspired by Mr. Hoggett’s observations of boxers in training at Gleason’s Gym in Brooklyn. Ms. Lavery’s version — a, uh, hit at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and in London — is set in a gym in Glasgow, where working-class lads (and one determined lass) hope to punch their way into a better life. As the author of the Tony-nominated “Frozen,” which explored the aftereffects of a child’s murder, Ms. Lavery has proved herself a master of psychological pain. Here she extends that expertise into a brutal realm of the senses. Through March 27, 30 Water Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, ovationtix.com, (866)811-4111; $45 to $60.\n\nTelevision\n\nGinia Bellafante\n\nThe Triangle shirtwaist factory fire 0f 1911 was one of the deadliest workplace disasters in United States history, killing nearly 150 people, most of them women. The fire started with a dropped cigarette on the eighth floor of a factory building in Greenwich Village occupied by the Triangle Waist Company. The story of the fire and its aftermath is chronicled in the documentary “TRIANGLE FIRE,” complete with re-enactments, to be shown Monday at 9 p.m. on PBS as a production in its “American Experience” series. The fire deeply influenced building codes, labor laws, politics and the beginning of the New Deal two decades later.\n\nThe MINNESOTA ORCHESTRA has become one of the world’s most distinctive ensembles since OSMO VANSKA became music director in 2003. The orchestra’s breathtaking performance of Sibelius’s “Kullervo” last March at Carnegie Hall was a highlight of 2010. Beethoven is another of Mr. Vanska’s specialties, and the Minnesota musicians have proved their mettle with extensive Beethoven recordings. On Monday they return to Carnegie, where Mr. Vanska will conduct Sibelius’s sixth and seventh symphonies and Beethoven’s Violin Concerto, with the distinguished young performer Lisa Batiashvili as soloist. 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $16.50 to $98.\n\nPop\n\nJon Caramanica\n\n“American Idol” has its winners, its future stars who don’t make it all the way but persevere and, its biggest group, singers of varying skill who find ways of extending their lifelines. MELINDA DOOLITTLE placed third in the show’s sixth season, in 2007, though that always seemed generous. An old-fashioned soul belter with limited emotional range, she was rewarded for coming out of her shell more and more each week until there wasn’t any shell left — and she still appeared to be hiding. A pop star she’ll never be, but she’s a cabaret natural, with a sharp gift for embellishing traditional numbers with small details that make them exciting. This week she’ll perform several nights as part of her two-week run at Feinstein’s at Loews Regency. 8:30 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday; 8 and 10:30 Friday and Saturday, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095; feinsteinsattheregency.com; $72-$110.\n\nJASON CASTRO will never have Ms. Doolittle’s voice or her command of a vast repertory, but he’s a much more slippery example of “Idol” success. A lazy and charismatic singer, he placed fourth on Season 7 in 2008 largely in spite of himself. Post-“Idol,” though, he caught up to the adulation, releasing a surprisingly strong soft-rock album last year that showed contours of his voice that seemed to have slipped his mind for the duration of his “Idol” run. The Mr. Castro performing at the YMCA Boulton Center for the Performing Arts on Long Island this week may not resemble the one on “Idol” but wouldn’t be here without him. 8 p.m. Monday, 37 West Main Street, Bay Shore, N.Y., (631) 969-1101, boultoncenter.org, $35.\n\nArt\n\nHolland Cotter\n\nWith the annual convergence of art fairs, this is shopping week in New York City. The senior fair among them, the ART SHOW at the Park Avenue Armory, now in its 23rd year, opens Tuesday and runs through Sunday. It was once known as an Upper East Side blue-chip-modernist stronghold, and that element is still present. But with galleries all over the place these days, and everything looking a bit staid, any uptown-downtown divide based on style, price, etc., is pretty much gone. 643 Park Avenue, at 67th Street, (212) 616-3930, artdealers.org. Younger and bigger, the ARMORY SHOW, installed on two humongous shipping piers at 55th Street and 12th Avenue, has done its part to eliminate the gap. Founded as a funky purveyor of new international art 13 years ago, it now has a whole pier devoted to modern material. Wednesday through Sunday; thearmoryshow.com. Three other fairs are on a Thursday-through-Sunday schedule. VOLTA NEW YORK distinguishes itself by featuring solo artist projects. 7 West 34th Street, Manhattan, 11th floor; voltashow.com. PULSE CONTEMPORARY ART FAIR accommodates works that are too large or too strange to fit into a standard art fair booth. MetropolitanPavilion, 125 West 18th Street, Chelsea; pulse-art.com. Finally, the INDEPENDENT, in its second year, jettisons booths altogether in an effort to loosen up the business-as-usual mindset, and even adds nonprofit spaces. And unlike the other fairs, admission to the Independent is free. 548 West 22nd Street, Chelsea; independentnewyork.com."
