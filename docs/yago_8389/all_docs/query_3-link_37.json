        "text": "Why is food cast so often in leading roles in film? Food facilitates conversation, making the kitchen and dinner table natural locations for advancing the plot, every bit as intimate as the bedroom. The action of preparing meals, feeding someone, and eating arouses audiences, and they make superb metaphors for pleasure and sex, wealth and excess, mythology and religion, family and friendship, dedication, and skill. Here are my favorite meals on reels. I have divided them into two menus, films where food is a lead character, and films where food plays an important supporting role. Tell me about the ones I’ve missed and start the popcorn.\n\nMeals on reels in a starring role\n\nMeals on reels in a supporting role\n\nSuggestions from readers\n\nHere are some additional films suggested by readers. I will add them as I screen them:\n\nFrom Dave Pohl via Facebook: Also could have included Ang Lee’s “The Wedding Banquet”, “My Big Fat Greek Wedding”, and “Joy Luck Club”. Also, food and drink play a role in my favorite movie of all time, Bergman’s “Fanny and Alexander”. The Christmas Eve dinner scene is fantastic.\n\nFrom James Michael via Facebook: “Monty Python’s ‘The Meaning of Life’. “I can’t eat another thing!” “Oh, but they are waffer theen…”\n\nFrom TeacherReaderCitizen via Huffington Post: There was a little movie called “The Bread, My Sweet” that was set in a Pittsburgh bakery owned by an Italian family. The movie’s plot concerned a romance intended to make the family matriarch die happy, but the real star is the BREAD.\n\nFrom LoreleiEve via Huffington Post: I just got back from the new Harry Potter and, as always, whenever the camera tracks lovingly down the length of those food-laden tables in the dining hall, I am amazed at 1) what those lucky students get to eat on a nightly basis, 2) whoever does the art direction/food prep (in all the Potter films), and 3) is it just me, or is there always something that looks like perky breasts in silver serving dishes? (In this one, they have whipped cream and a cherry on top.) What could the subtext possibly mean?\n\nFrom Vickster via Huffington Post: How about Alfred Hitchcock’s “Rope”? For those who haven’t seen the film, it involves two young men who commit the perfect murder (or so they think), then celebrate by holding a dinner party, setting the food out on the chest that contains their victim.\n\nFrom DemocraticVoter via Huffington Post: Another worth mentioning is The Last Supper.\n\nFrom CARTERJ via Huffington Post: As Mildred Pierce (Joan Crawford) seats her guests at their table in her brand-spanking-new restaurant, named “Mildred’s” of course, she hands them her menus and, as she takes her leave, casually remarks, “We have wonderful fried chicken”. And then she walks. Earlier, reminiscing about those first horrible days as a waitress, but determined to make a life for her girls, including that rotten Veda, we hear Joan in a voice-over remarking, “I took tips and I was glad to get them.”\n\nFrom AlButerol via Huffington Post: You left out the French film “Delicatessen”. This depicts a post-apocalyptic world where meat is very scarce and vegetarian terrorists roam the sewers. A butcher/landlord entices new tenants and then carves them up for sale as meat to the other tenants. As grisly as this sounds, the film is very funny and entertaining.\n\nFrom David Nance via Huffington Post: I would like you to add two of my favourites to your list….Somethings gotta give!….and of course “Spanglish”, absolutely a must see.\n\nFrom LMPE via Huffington Post: What about “Stand By Me”? (barforama). There’s also “Monty Python’s Meaning of Life” (Mr. Creosote quite literally eats too much). A slightly less pleasant (but still worth seeing) one is “Ravenous”, focusing on cannibalism.\n\nFrom sexyrexy via Huffington Post: oh another great film.. THE RISE OF LOUIS IV.. by ROBERTO ROSELLINI.. loved it.. it captured the whole eating ritual at Versailles.. 14 courses, the norm.. no wonder they usually suffered from gout. where’s Nora’s own film about her marriage.. what’s the title?? forget with likewise Streep & Jack Nicholson. oh yes.. HEARTBURN.. I must admit– it has the best recipe for SPAGHETTI CARBONARA.. I got fat testing it.. even my cat loved it. yummy!!!\n\nFrom cemadi via Huffington Post: Another great film for food is “The Age of Innocence”. It shows some of the best feasts I’ve seen on the screen.\n\nFrom cminca via Huffington Post: I’d just add one–The Big Chill. Lots of scenes of eating, drinking, and talking around the table.\n\nSpecial thanks to the Internet Movie Database from which I collected credits, cast information, and some quotes.\n\nMy memories of Julia\n\nSeems like everybody who ever lifted a turkey by the wings has a Julia story. Here’s mine:\n\nIn the 1961, when I was an undergrad at the University of Florida, I got a job at ABC Liquors and rapidly fell in love with wine. Then I fell for food.\n\nIn 1963, WGBH in Boston started broadcasting Julia’s “The Art of French Cooking” on PBS. Between classes I would watch Julia in black and white. She had the only cooking show on TV at the time, and she was a hoot with her chirpy voice, playful demeanor on PBS, and her occasional hilarious forays onto Johnny Carson’s Tonight show. She dropped things and caught her towels on fire. She made it OK to screw up which I did frequently.\n\nShe swept crumbs on the floor and added parenthetically in her “Oh, I can do that because they clean up after me, but you don’t want to do it” and let loose with that otherworldly laugh all of which were famously and fabulously parodied by Dan Akroyd on Saturday Night Live in 1979.\n\nMany years later, in the early 1990s, when I set up the Food & Drink Network (FDN) on AOL, at the time the most popular hangout for foodies online, Julia and her assistant were my guest in her first live online chat. It was a raging success, but sadly, my software failed to record a transcript of the evening.\n\nShe reciprocated by inviting me to her home in Cambridge, MA, for an evening with friends and associates. It was an unforgettable night. She and her assistants laid on countless hors d’oeuvres and finger foods accompanied by the newest rage, Jordan Cabernet and J sparkling wine from Sonoma, CA. But just being in the same room with her made me humble and giddy.\n\nBut she put me at ease instantly. I struggled to stifle the guffaws when she showed me the avocado green masonite pegboard walls of her kitchen where she often taped her shows. The pegboards were on the side walls, out of view of the cameras. Her pots and pans hung from hooks, and their shapes were outlined in marker so her staff would return them to their proper place. Just like my basement! I asked where she got the inspiration, and she said “it was Paul’s idea, he said we should have matching workshops!” The whole kitchen has been re-assembled at the Smithsonian so you can see for yourself.\n\nMuch has been said about Julia’s importance, and I can only gazillion the motion. She appeared on the scene after WWII, just about the same time television was becoming popular. She reminded former soldiers, who were becoming the nation’s leaders, of the great breads, cheeses, and simple pleasures of the well herbed roasted chicken they had in Europe.\n\nAt the same time, the Boeing 707 made it fast and affordable for Americans to travel overseas, and many GIs returned and rediscovered the secrets of old world cuisine. Julia, the dishwasher, the emergence of American wine, and the Weber Kettle, all conspired to awaken our food consciousness and spark the gourmet revolution in the US: Cooking on TV, expanded food sections in newspapers, food magazines, culinary schools, great chefs, and fine dining for the masses. She influenced so many, among them this Meathead.\n\nJulia stood 6’2″ tall and was an imposing presence, but she was really a giant."
