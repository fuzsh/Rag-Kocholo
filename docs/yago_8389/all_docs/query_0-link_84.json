        "text": "Born in Milan in 1928, Marco Ferreri began directing and co-scripting films in Spain in 1958. In Italy, he began directing such offbeat and acidic satires of contemporary life as The Conjugal Bed and The Ape Woman (both 1963). After the tour-de-force of Dillinger is Dead (1969), his work turned even more savage with films like La Grande Bouffe (1973), a Swiftian account of four men eating themselves to death, starring Marcello Mastroianni; The Last Woman (1976), a shocking exploration of changing sexual roles starring Gerard Depardieu; and Tales of Ordinary Madness (1981), an adaptation of the memoirs of Charles Bukowski. His 1991 House of Smiles won the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival.\n\nRialto Pictures"
