        "text": "In the mid-20th century, playwrights and artists such as Bertolt Brecht and the Dadaists rejected the concept of the \"well-made play\". This was theatre acted in a naturalistic manner, by actors usually playing upper-class, or upper-middle-class characters, often in evening dress, in a set - often a drawing room or dining room - so naturalistic that it looked as if the room's fourth wall had simply been removed. These plays, attended by the upper and upper-middle classes, also in evening dress, were anathema to Marxists and anarchists alike.\n\nAlfred Jarry's PÃ¨re Ubu was a shot across the bows of the well-made play; soon Brecht, and the Berliner Ensemble, had sunk the decrepit and discredited barque entirely. For several decades, in world theatre, the very notion of the \"well-made play\" was loathsome, derided by all. Only in the late 20th century did it make its return, playing to younger, post-Thatcher elites, who also enjoyed easy drama, and dressing up in dickie-bows.\n\nIn the cinema, and in TV drama, there was never a rejection of the \"well-made film\". Directors like Glauba Rocha, Marco Ferreri, and Lindsay Anderson tried to break the mould; Anderson came closest to demolishing it, with his features If . . . and O Lucky Man, and his brilliant, angry and subversive TV drama, The Old Crowd. But The Old Crowd was rejected both by the public, and, more crucially, by the critics, and, being himself one of the \"old crowd\" - the upper class - Anderson was broken by the experience. His last years were spent directing \"well-made films\" such as The Whales of August and \"well-made plays\" on the West End stage.\n\nIngmar Bergman began his long directorial career as something of a radical, even a surrealist. He has done some amazing, ground-breaking work. But, like all directors with long, distinguished careers, he has produced some stinkers too. Which brings us to Fanny and Alexander, which he made in 1982.\n\nFanny and Alexander is the \"well-made film\" par excellence. It has more butlers, maids, and servants than three Merchant Ivory films put together. It was photographed by Sven Nykvist, and every image - even a shot of a dead dog - is a thing of beauty. Apparently it's a semi-autobiographical piece, from which we can deduce that Bergman grew up in a very wealthy environment which was also, paradoxically, a family of actors; that he had an inventive, active mind; that he was persecuted by a wicked stepfather.\n\nThis brief description is much more lucid than the film itself. Fanny and Alexander is a very long film: 188 minutes. The plot doesn't get going until the third hour of the film. The first two hours are dedicated to scenes of family life within the very upper-middle-class Ekdahl household. There is much dancing, laughing, gaiety and a little sadness. There is a farting paedophile, but no harm befalls the Ekdahl children when they are left alone with him. The family travel everywhere by sleigh, in a city which appears to have been designed by Thomas Kinkade, painter of light. No one appears to have a job, except for the children's parents, Oscar and Emilie, who are both actors.\n\nWhat we see of their theatrical exploits is pretty hysterical: coarse acting of the most tedious and amateurish nature, performed on million-dollar stage sets, watched by hundreds of tuxedo-clad patrons in a three-tiered opera house. I know this is supposed to be Sweden in 1907, but I can't believe that Swedish theatre was ever as bad as this. At the conclusion of their Christmas play, Oscar makes a prolonged and tearful speech to all his friends: \"My only talent is that I love this little world inside the playhouse.\"\n\nYou will not be surprised to learn that tearful Oscar dies shortly thereafter, apparently felled by an excess of sentimentality. At which point mum goes off the rails and marries the wicked Bishop, and the story finally begins. Fanny and Alexander are nominally the protagonists, but they appear very little in the overall film. Even after they're locked up in the Bishop's house of horrors, we don't see much of them. Instead we're drawn back to the Ekdahls' summer house, where the family dress all in white, like extras from The Great Gatsby or The Garden of the Finzi-Contini, and go on boat trips. In these scenes, the matriarch muses that they are all actors, really: \"I played a mother . . . then a widow . . . then a grandmother. One role followed another.\"\n\nWhat insights! The script - once the plot has surfaced - stresses that young Alexander is supposed to be like Hamlet: his dad even dies while playing Hamlet's father's ghost. But this is spurious. Hamlet's predicament is that he isn't sure what the truth is - whether dad is a demon, whether his uncle Claudius is really all right. Alexander's stepdad is presented as an obvious bastard and a monster, attended by a phalanx of sadistic, black-clad harpies, in case you don't get it. This is worse than spurious, it is sentimental. Sentimentality has been described as unearned emotion - and that is certainly what's going on here. Fanny and Alexander is like a big, sugary cake: it looks nice, but it isn't good for you, and it leaves a sickly taste.\n\nPart of the problem may be the length of the film: paradoxically, that it may be too short. This feature version of Fanny and Alexander is apparently a knock-down from a five-hour TV movie, so far broadcast only in Sweden. What I've read of the longer version makes it sound tedious in the extreme, but maybe the heartwarming scene in which doomed dad demonstrates to Fanny and Alexander \"the nature of storytelling with a simple chair\" somehow helps the film to make more sense.\n\nAs it is, the only real cohesion comes from the art department, with its fixations on over-done sets, excessively pretty exteriors, and chandeliers. The chandeliers are especially weird: even the austere Bishop's place - supposed to be a total contrast to the Ekdahl residence - is lit by glittering gold candelabras. Maybe everybody lit their homes with chandeliers and had 10ft Christmas trees in Sweden in 1907. But I doubt it.\n\nNeedless to say, such a mishmash of posh tosh was well-rewarded by the Academy of Sentimental Arts and Sciences, and Fanny and Alexander won four Oscars.\n\nYet, for such a feel-good film, the production history is surprisingly alienated and unpleasant. Liv Ullmann found the part of Emilie boring and didn't want to play it; Bergman, furious, ostracised her and told her \"she'd lost her birthright\" (presumably the right to appear in Bergman films). When Nykvist's ex-wife died, Bergman refused to let him leave to attend her funeral. Yet Bergman himself took sick during the filming, and left entire sequences in the hands of his assistants.\n\nClearly he was legend-making in all of this. He also directed a documentary - The Making of Fanny and Alexander - which was longer than the film itself. He also gave an hour-long interview to promote the film he claimed would be his last: \"Ingmar Bergman Says Farewell To Film.\" Bergman directed 15 films thereafter."
