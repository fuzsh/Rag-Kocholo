Starring Marcello Mastroianni, Ugo Tognazzi, Michel Piccoli and Philippe Noiret, it is ostensibly about four men who get together to eat themselves to death. La Grande Bouffe – aka Blow Out – is a still-jawdropping satire of decadence and conceit. It is re-released in cinemas today\n\nMost viewed\n\nMost viewed"
