        "text": "Tag Archives: Italian\n\nREADER RECOMMENDATION: WILD, WILD PLANET [I CRIMINALI DELLA GALASSIA] (1965)\n\nThe fifth submission in the June review writing contest: by Andreas O. Stoehr.\n\nDIRECTED BY: Antonio Margheriti\n\nFEATURING: Tony Russel, Lisa Gastoni, Massimo Serato, Franco Nero\n\nPLOT: In 2015, the space police fight to stop an organ-miniaturizing mad scientist from\n\nbuilding a utopian community.\n\nWHY IT DESERVES TO MAKE THE LIST: Although the synopsis might make it sound like a typical space opera, Wild, Wild Planet is anything but. Everything about the film simultaneously screams “bad!” and “weird!” The dubbed dialogue, for example, is as laughable as any Toho monster movie, with a mix of technobabble and would-be ‘60s clichés like “That’s the wildest, most way-out I’ve ever heard!” The grandstanding villain, Nurmi, constantly repeats his ill-conceived master plan, and his kidnappings are carried out by beautiful women teamed with bald, four-armed mutants. This is 1960s Italian sci-fi at its wildest and most way-out.\n\nCOMMENTS: I’m not sure why Margheriti (who was credited as “Anthony Dawson”) hasn’t become more of a cult figure, though being name-checked in Inglourious Basterds might raise his status among film geeks. Wild, Wild Planet displays much of the same untalented passion you might expect from Ed Wood or Coleman Francis, and with the screenplay so awkwardly translated into English, it feels even more delirious.\n\nThe film’s futuristic aesthetic, which was already outdated in 1965, involves bad model cities and psychedelic dresses; it’s like “The Jetsons” meets Invasion of the Body Snatchers by way of “Pee-Wee’s Playhouse.” TVs advertise “Computo-dolls,” and the only remaining form of art has performers dressed as butterflies prancing around in a circle. When the mutant henchmen attack, they do so by suggestively enclosing victims in their trench coats; one scientist escapes in the midst of this process, and ends up as a comatose midget. It may be ridiculous, it may be cheap, but it sure ain’t predictable.\n\nWho, after all, could guess that the climax would take place on a resort planet amidst an exploding river of blood (that looks suspiciously like cranberry juice)? With its bizarre interior design and enough hilarious non sequiturs to rival Plan 9, Wild, Wild Planet is a weird, weird movie.\n\nWHAT THE CRITICS SAY:\n\n“The Wild, Wild Planet has a colourful bizarreness to it… But despite throwing up such an outre and colourful plot, the way Antonio Margheriti allows it all to transpire on screen is really rather pedestrian and dull. This rather wild skew of ideas ends up as a rather murky plot.”–Richard Scheib, Moria: Science Fiction, Horror and Fantasy Film Review\n\nCAPSULE: THE HOUSE WITH LAUGHING WINDOWS [LA CASA DALLE FINISTRE CHE RIDONO] (1976)\n\nAKA The House of the Laughing Windows\n\nDIRECTED BY: Pupi Avati\n\nFEATURING: Lino Capolicchio, Francesca Marciano, Gianni Cavina, Giulio Pizzirani, Tonino Corazzari\n\nPLOT: An art historian becomes embroiled in a sick mystery when he arrives in a rural village to restore a religious painting.\n\nWHY IT WON’T MAKE THE LIST: Giallo films always tend to be a little bent when compared to U.S. horror movies. Despite the strange characters, unsettling tone and death-fetish subject matter, La casa dalle finestre che ridono is not weird by Euro-thriller standards. In fact, it plays out like a conventional mystery,\n\nCOMMENTS: Producers of Italian Euro-thrillers have rarely constrained themselves by strictly adhering to regimented structure, timing and consistency. La casa dalle finestre che ridono, aka The House With Laughing Windows, like Suspiria or Baba Yaga is an exception. It retains the feel of a giallo film, yet stands up to conventional Hollywood standards. This makes it a candidate for conventional thriller audiences. The House With Laughing Windows is more of a mystery than a horror movie, yet still qualifies for the “shocker” designation. As a puzzler, it is not exactly up to Agatha Christie standards of construction, but what it lacks in precision, it makes up for in color and atmosphere. There are a couple of slow spots, but overall this gory film demands attention with its curious plot, steady, brooding pace, and consistently suspenseful, creepy feel.\n\nStefano (Capolicchio) is an art historian and restoration specialist who is summoned to an eerie parish to complete a long unfinished fresco in an equally eerie church. The painting was supposedly never completed, but closer examination reveals that certain parts were intentionally obfuscated by being painted over. The seeds of Stefano’s undoing lie in his urge to uncover what lies beneath.\n\nThe grim fresco depicts the violent torture death of Saint Sebastiano. It is the work of Continue reading CAPSULE: THE HOUSE WITH LAUGHING WINDOWS [LA CASA DALLE FINISTRE CHE RIDONO] (1976) →\n\n58. DILLINGER IS DEAD (1969)\n\nDillinger e Morto\n\n“Dillinger Is Dead throws narrative, psychological, and symbolic common sense out the window… the film’s refusal of clear-cut logic, its contradictory symbols, and its moral ambiguity open it to endless interpretation.”–Michael Joshua Rowin, from the notes to the Criterion Collection edition of Dillinger is Dead\n\nDIRECTED BY: Marco Ferreri\n\nFEATURING: Michel Piccoli, Annie Girardot, Anita Pallenberg\n\nPLOT: Glauco designs gas-masks by day. One night, he returns to the apartment he shares with his wife and live-in maid and, while searching for ingredients for dinner, discovers a gun wrapped in newspaper in his pantry. He spends an evening puttering around the house, making dinner, watching home movies, playing with his various toys, disassembling and reassembling the gun, painting it, then using the weapon in a senseless final act.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nJohn Dillinger was a bank robber in the 1930s who became both Public Enemy #1 and a folk hero.\n\nFerreri barely directed Piccoli, giving him only simple blocking instructions and dialogue and allowing the actor to improvise the rest of the performance.\n\nThis is the first of six films Ferreri and Piccoli made together.\n\nModel Anita Pallenberg may be best known for her romantic involvements with two members of the Rolling Stones (first Brian Jones, and later Keith Richards), but she has had small roles in a couple of weird movies besides this one: Barbarella (1968) and Performance (1970).\n\nThe movie was filmed in the apartment of Italian pop-artist Mario Schifano, and some of the painter’s works (most prominently, “Futurismo Rivisitato“) can be seen in the background.\n\nThe observations that the young worker makes to Glauco in the prologue are all paraphrases from philosopher Herbert Marcuse’s essay One-Dimensional Man, a critique of then-contemporary consumerism, mass media and industrialism. Marhola Dargis of the New York Times believes that the entire movie is an attempt to give cinematic form to Marcuse’s ideas.\n\nAfter its initial release, Dillinger is Dead nearly disappeared. Variety‘s 1999 version of the “Portable Movie Guide” didn’t mention it among their 8700 reviews, Halliwell never heard of it, and Pauline Kael didn’t encounter it in “5001 Nights at the Movies.” It was seldom screened and never appeared on home video until a 2006 revival led to the film being virtually rediscovered, culminating in a 2010 release by the Criterion Collection.\n\nINDELIBLE IMAGE: The gun that may have belonged to John Dillinger, which fascinates the protagonist. Especially after he paints it bright red and carefully paints white polka dots on it.\n\nWHAT MAKES IT WEIRD: Dillinger is Dead is a disconnected, absurdist parable where nothing seems to be happening, and when something happens, it doesn’t make sense. It’s very much a product of its time—the anarchic, experimental late 1960s—-yet the world it portrays still feels oddly, and awfully, familiar.\n\nClip from Dillinger is Dead\n\nCOMMENTS: Dillinger is Dead doesn’t take leave of reality until its very last moments, Continue reading 58. DILLINGER IS DEAD (1969) →\n\nCAPSULE REVIEW: BABA YAGA (1973)\n\nAKA: Kiss Me Kill Me\n\nDIRECTED BY: Corrado Farina\n\nFEATURING: Carroll Baker, George Eastman, Isabelle De Funès,\n\nPLOT: A fashion photographer is beguiled by a lesbian witch who seeks to dominate, seduce and consume her.\n\nWHY IT WON’T MAKE THE LIST: Bab Yaga is straight Euro-thriller. While such films have an unconventional feel by US standards, the style is characteristic of this distinctive 1960’s-’70’s genre, and therefore very conventional on its own terms.\n\nCOMMENTS: Baba Yaga is a very stylish Italian occult film in the Euro horror tradition of Suspiria. It is based on artist Guido Crepax’s highly stylized graphic novel about a sorceress who tries to bewitch a fashion photographer. Crepax adapted the novel from his risqué S&M comic .\n\nValentina (De Funès) is an up and coming fashion photographer with a knack for controversial shoots. After she has a chance encounter with the fashionable and alluring society matron Baba Yaga, her life takes strange and eerie turns. Yaga discovers Valentina on a darkened street, becomes attracted to her and begins to inject herself into the young shutterbug’s life in odd ways. Yaga develops a strange fixation on Valentina, one that is more than platonic.\n\nYaga lives in a striking Gothic Revival mansion, it’s interiors bedecked with layers of satin, red velvet –and heavy leather in the boudoir. While the house is very luxurious, it is in need of a few repairs. There is a nasty hole under the oriental rug in the drawing room—the opening of a bottomless pit to Hell. It is only fitting to have an eccentric home, because the owner isn’t exactly mainstream. Babs is taken with keeping vipers and Australian fruit bats for pets, has some creepy taxidermy a la Norman Bates, and owns a collection of cursed curios.\n\nIn a gesture of benevolence, Baba Yaga gives Valentina a large Victorian doll “to protect” her. Valentina counters that she doesn’t need any protection. Well, she does now! The Continue reading CAPSULE REVIEW: BABA YAGA (1973) →\n\nPLEASE HELP, NON-AMERICAN FRIENDS: A LIST OF OBSURE, FOREIGN (TO US) FILMS\n\nThe Internet Movie Database is a wonderful and a terrible thing. Wonderful, because it allows you to create impressively thorough lists of potentially weird movies. Terrible, because it may tease you with the names of intriguing movies you may never be able to see.\n\nBelow is a list of dozens of highly-rated movies that have been tagged with “surrealism” or similar keywords, broken down by country. To my knowledge, none of these movies is currently available on DVD, and I suspect that several of them may never have been translated into English. Any information on these titles by people who are familiar with them would be of enormous value to us in deciding whether or not we should invest time in trying to track them down. So, my non-American friends, please have at it! If you leave a comment with some information on any of these titles, I’ll update the body of the text to reflect it. (Information supplied by readers is added in bold).\n\nArgentinian\n\nRazón de mi vida, La (20??) [The Reason for My Life]. This showed up on the IMDB as a highly rated 2008 release a while back. Now, the link goes to a movie of the same name, but it has no rating and is listed as a 2010 release. OFFICIAL UPDATE: Per Kino Red: “completed in this month. Release soon (Buenos Aires, Paris and Tokyo). Trailer and teaser (in Spanish) in youtube: NOTE: The film is not based on the Eva Perón autobiography. The title of the film is ironic or parodic about the Eva Perón’s book.” I will add that the trailer looks very promising!\n\nRosaura a las 10 (1958) [Rosaura at 10 o’clock]. Alon thinks it’s only borderline weird at best.\n\nBrazilian\n\nDeus e o Diabo na Terra do Sol (1964) [God and the Devil in the Land of the Sun] Per Alon: “interesting, beautifully filmed and edited, movie about the drama of the Brazilian dispossessed… but I wouldn’t consider it weird by any measure.”\n\nO Anjo Nasceu (1969) [The Angel Was Born]\n\nPer Alon: “…seems to be famous for its unconventional camerawork and editing. The film tells the story of two murderers, one of whom has mystic visions, and was regarded as quite gory for its time.”\n\nTerra em Transe. No English translation of the title. Per Alon, Entranced Land or Land in Anguish. Has read it’s more “daring” than Deus e o Diabo na Terra do Sol by the same director.\n\nCzech/Czechoslovakian\n\nAdéla jeste nevecerela (1978). Per LRobHubbard: translates to Adele Hasn’t Had Her Dinner Yet. From the director of Lemonade Joe (which we do plan to review). “Spoofs the ‘Nick Carter’ detective stories, featuring Carter investigating strange disappearances, which involve a carnivorous plant, the ‘Adele’ of the title.” No Region 1 release. Worth seeing, but not necessarily weird.\n\nAkumulátor 1 (1994).\n\nJak utopit doktora Mrácka aneb Konec vodniku v Cechách (1974) [How to Drown Dr. Mracek, the Lawyer]\n\nKytice (2000) [Wild Flowers]\n\nLepsie byt bohaty a zdravy ako chudobny a chory (1993) [It’s Better to Be Wealthy and Healthy Than Poor and Ill]\n\nNejasná zpráva o konci sveta (1997) [An Ambiguous Report About the End of the World]\n\nNevesta (1970).\n\nPane, vy jste vdova! (1970) [You Are a Widow, Sir]\n\nPostav dom, zasad strom (1980) [Build a House, Plant a Tree]\n\nSedím na konári a je mi dobre (1989). No English translation of the title. Probably never translated into English.\n\nTajemství hradu v Karpatech (1981) [The Mysterious Castle in the Carpathians]. Per LRobHubbard: from the director of and similar to Adele Hasn’t Had Her Dinner Yet (above) but a pastiche/parody. The idea may be from a story by Jules Verne.\n\nTisícrocná vcela (1983) [The Millennial Bee]\n\nZítra vstanu a oparím se cajem (1977). No English translation of the title.\n\nFrench\n\nLa Cicatrice intérieure (1972). Written by and featuring glacial chanteuse Nico (best known here for her work with The Velvet Underground).\n\nLa Dernière femme (1976) [The Last Woman]. Despite the presence of a young Gerard Depardieu, I am not sure this was ever translated into English for home video. Controversial on release due to its sexual content. Per Irene, not a weird film.\n\nGreek\n\nSouvliste tous! Etsi tha paroume to kouradokastro (1981) [Barbecue them!]. A Greek correspondent tells me this is basically unknown even in Greece and no DVDs are available. It is on Google video, with no English subtitles.\n\nItalian\n\nCapricci (1969). By Carmelo Bene.\n\nDon Giovanni (1970). Also by Carmelo Bene.\n\nFantozzi (1975) and Il Secondo tragico Fantozzi (1976). These popular Italian comedies seem to have never been released in America. I gather Fantozzi is something like the Italian Monsieur Hulot?\n\nLa Rabbia (2008). With Faye Dunaway and Franco Nero in the cast, I would assume this might see the light of day soon.\n\nIndian\n\nPoi (2006).\n\nJapanese\n\nDen-en ni shisu (1974) [Pastoral Hide and Seek]\n\nTokyo senso sengo hiwa (1970) [He Died After the War]\n\nMexican\n\nPafnucio Santo (1977). Per Alon: “…seems promising… directed by Jodorowsky’s cinematographer… the trailer on YouTube is rather terse.”\n\nPolish\n\nEwa chce spac (1958). No English translation of the title. Per Irene Goncharova, “a mere comedy… I didn’t find it weird.”\n\nJak daleko stad, jak blisko (1972) [How Far, How Near]\n\nWalkower (1965) [Walkover]. Per Irene Goncharova, “A Polish movie, just drama, nothing weird.”\n\nRussian/Soviet\n\nDen vyborov (2007) [Election Day]. Per Irene Goranchova: “…absolute trash, a really BAD Russian movie. I sometimes laugh watching it. Bad, bad, bad! Nothing weird…”\n\nPosetitel muzeya (1989). [Visitor of a Museum]?\n\nSobachye serdtse (1988). Literally, Heart of a Dog. Based on a Mikhail Bulgakov novel that was also adapted by the Italians into a film called Cuore di cane. Produced for television? Per Irene Goncharova: It was a television production, although there may also be another filmed version. “…a good movie, quite weird.”\n\nZhena kerosinshchika (1988) [Kerosene Salesman’s Wife]? Per Irene Goncharova: hasn’t seen it, but looks weird from the description.\n\nSpanish\n\nAmanece, que no es poco (1989). No English translation of the title. Per Alon, English translation may be Isn’t dawn enough? “…a masterpiece of surreal humour. You have a serious candidate for The List.”\n\nDon Juan Tenorio (1952). Alon thinks it’s unlikely to be weird, mentions that its notoriety may come from the fact that Salvador Dalí served as the costume designer.\n\nIn the interest of thoroughness, we’re potentially saving a spot on the List for all these movies, so any help as to whether they are must-sees or duds will be greatly appreciated!"
