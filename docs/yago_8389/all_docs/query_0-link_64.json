        "text": "Dear Diane , Dear shaded viewers, this\n\nis the kind of film I like to watch in the summer.\n\nDIrected by Marco\n\nFerreri, Liza (Catherine Deneuve) is in a boat with friends , she is bored and doesn't know what she wants. She dives in the water and\n\nlands on an island where she finds Giorgio (Marcello\n\nMastroianni) an intellectual and an artist who decided to live in\n\nsolitude with his dog Melampo.Giorgio takes care of Liza who is\n\nconfused and injured his foot . They have a passionate encounter. Liza leaves because she knows that Girogio is a loner and on top of that she is jelaous of his dog Melampo..She wants to take the place of the dog in GIrogio's heart so she kills it. Liza then becomes the dog of Giorgio…\n\nI really love this movie and the\n\nhandmade sunglasses! Enjoy summertime\n\nStefania"
