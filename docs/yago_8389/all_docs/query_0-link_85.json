        "text": "I am counting days to watch “Yves Saint Laurent” directed by Jail Lespert. Waiting for the fashion movie of the year, let’s have a look at Yves Saint Laurent himself, and his relationship with cinema.\n\n“Yves Saint Laurent” in theatres March 21st, 2014\n\nYves Saint Laurent was known for his tweed jackets, high boots, safari style and tuxedos. He was the one who saved House of Dior from bankruptcy after Christian Dior’s death. Not many people know, that he was also a costume designer and created many outfits for several Hollywood movies, such as The Pink Panther (1963), The Hunger (1983) and Celebration (2007). It’s very crucial to mention here relationship between the designer and French actress, Catherine Deneuve.\n\nSaint Laurent considered Deneuve as his muse and best friend for decades. Deneuve once said “Saint Laurent designs for women with double life. His clothes for daywear help women to enter a world full of strangers. They enable her to go wherever she wants without arousing unwelcome attention, thanks to their somehow masculine quality. However, for the evening, when she may choose her company, he makes her seductive.”\n\nFashion and Cinema in partnership with Vanity Fair:\n\nCatherine Deneuve and Yves Saint Laurent’s long lasting partnership started when they worked together for Luis Buñuel’s film Belle de Jour in 1966, where he dressed her stylishly for misspent afternoons. The relationship lasted until the death of the designer in 2008 and included several films such as La Sirène du Mississipi (François Truffaut, 1969), La Chamade (Alain Cavalier, 1968), Liza (Marco Ferreri, 1972) and The Hunger (Tony Scott, 1983).\n\nCatherine Deneuve’s acting career spans more than fifty years and well over a hundred films, with an impeccable reputation for her understated acting and her choice of unconventional, auteurist filmmakers. While her acting career is key to her status as a star, it is her association with fashion, and especially haute couture, which makes her a specifically French fashion icon. As such, her image embodies what is considered the essence of femininity, exquisite sophistication and elegance, something that has been reinforced by her advertising campaigns for both Chanel and Yves Saint Laurent. Her special relationship with Saint Laurent and mutual admiration gave way to a particular muse-artist partnership that would go on for over thirty years and which is reflected in the on and off screen clothes he designed for her. This relationship confers her a special position within the fashion sphere.\n\nConsidered a genius and an artist rather than a mere designer, Yves Saint Laurent first wanted to create theatrical costumes after seeing in his native Oran a Molière play designed by Christian Bérard. The fact of being hired by Christian Dior after winning a fashion competition (together with Karl Lagerfeld) aged only 18 changed his future and paved the way to him becoming one of the most significant fashion revolutionaries. If Chanel liberated women, Saint Laurent gave them power by providing them with clothes inspired in the male wardrobe, characterised by comfort and confidence (tuxedos, reefer and safari jackets, trousers, sport and trench coats) acknowledging the active role of the modern woman in society and not as a mere object of admiration. Haute couture had offered until his arrival perfect, “frozen” looks. He gave them motion. Perhaps this is one of the reasons for which Chanel said he was her only worthy successor.\n\nThis event examined the careers of both actress and designer and the work that they created together on screen.\n\n#1 La Sirene du Missisipi\n\nLouis and Julie make contact through small-ads in the newspaper, both seeking a relationship and, hopefully, love. Julie joins Louis in Reunion and they marry. Soon afterwards Julie disappears with nearly all his money… Her real name is Marion and Julie was killed on her way to the island. Truffaut’s film is an exploration of love: on Louis’ side it is pure and absolute, on Marion’s provisional and calculated until she crumbles in the face of his unswerving and unselfish passion. Deneuve’s clothes were designed for her by Saint Laurent producing the image of a sensuous woman of refined and expensive taste.\n\n#2 The Hunger\n\nMiriam and John are a couple living in Manhattan who keep their youth and longevity thanks to the blood they take from others. When John loses his youth and energy, Miriam seduces Sarah, a researcher on the ageing process, in a superb and elegant scene. The directorial début of Ridley Scott’s younger brother is a vampire film against all stereotypes with beautiful and dream-like cinematography by Stephen Goldblatt and a sublime score by Michel Rubini and Denny Jaeger. Set in sumptuous surroundings, the film shows Deneuve exquisitely dressed by Saint Laurent and embodying timeless elegance and ambiguity as well as Old World sophistication and decadence against Sarandon’s Sarah, who offers a fresher and troubled New World spontaneity.\n\n#3 Belle de Jour\n\nBuñuel’s film about the misspent afternoons of a Parisian bourgeoise with masochistic inclinations marked the beginning of the long-standing collaboration between Yves Saint Laurent and Catherine Deneuve. Saint Laurent’s clothes for Deneuve’s Séverine are sophisticated but also ambiguous, denoting coolness and containment through their simple and elegant lines and their just-above-the-knee length, but also provoking with their extreme femininity.\n\nSource: Fashion&Cinema in media partnership with Vanity Fair"
