        "text": "PARIS — The star of this year’s official festival poster, Joanne Woodward, will make an appearance as a producer in this year’s Cannes Classics series.\n\nWoodward is a producer on Shepard & Dark, a documentary directed by Treva Wurmfeld delving into years of correspondence between actor Sam Shepard and his longtime friend Johnny Dark.\n\nShepard & Dark will appear as one of three documentaries in the sidebar, which will also screen 20 feature films including Elizabeth Taylor’s classic portrayal of Cleopatra, directed by Joseph Mankiewicz (1963); and the Catherine Deneuve musical The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, by Jacques Demy (1964).\n\nAs previously announced, actress Kim Novak will also present Alfred Hitchcock’s Vertigo, and his The Birds will also be shown as part of the sidebar.\n\nBernardo Bertolucci’s The Last Emperor will screen in 3D, and Chris Marker and Pierre Lhomme’s 1963 documentary about everyday life in Paris, Le Joli Mai, will debut a new cut.\n\nTwo special presentations will also take place to honor anniversaries. Jean Cocteau’s La Belle et la Bette will be shown in honor of the 50th anniversary of the director’s death, and Euzhan Palcy’s Simeon will be shown in honor of the 100th birthday of her fellow Martiniquais, poet Aime Cesaire. Musical Opium by Arielle Dombasle will be shown in a special evening presentation.\n\nAs part of the Official Selection, the sidebar showcases re-discovered films and works with filmmakers to restore prints, and the selections coincide with new releases on DVD or theater re-releases.\n\nRestored prints will include Ousmane Sembene’s Borom Sarret (1963), Satyajit Ray’s Charulata (1964), Jacques Baratier’s Goha (1957), Valerio Zurlini’s The Desert of the Tartars (1976), Marco Ferreri’s The Grand Bouffe (1973), Patrice Chereau’s La Reine Margot (1994), Lino Brocka’s The Nail of Brightness (1975), Rene Clement’s Blazing Sun (1960), Yasujiro Ozu’s An Autumn Afternoon (1962), Ted Kotcheff’s The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz (1974), Hal Ashby’s The Last Detail (1973), Franceso Rosi’s Lucky Luciano (1973) and Alain Resnais Hiroshima Mon Amour (1959).\n\nIn addition to The Birds as part of Cinema de la Plage, the Classics series will also show Jacques Tati’s Jour de Fete (1949), Buster Keaton’s The General (1926), Alfred Hitchcock’s The Birds 91963), Luc Besson’s Le Grand Bleu (1988), Jerry Lewis‘ The Ladies’ Man (1961), Philippe de Broca’s The Man From Rio (1964) and Fred Newmeyer and Sam Taylor’s Safety Last (1923).\n\nThe sidebar runs as part of the festival, which takes place May 15-26."
