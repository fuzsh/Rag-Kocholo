        "text": "Many of Deneuve’s sharpest interpretations are of women who leave most of their thoughts unsaid, subsumed in interior turbulence. In Agnès Varda’s dystopian The Creatures (1966), Deneueve is a cheerfully blank housewife married to Michel Piccoli, a science fiction writer, living on the island of Noirmoutier off the Atlantic coast. Mute after a car accident and cloistered at home, her character communicates the simplest of phrases with a handy whiteboard, only to regain speech after giving birth to a son. Just a year before that, in Polanski’s Repulsion, she delivered a feat of manic claustrophobia, playing a young manicurist negotiating repressed sexual trauma cracking up in a London apartment with a bloated corpse and rotting rabbit head.\n\nDeneuve would act with Piccoli again in Belle de Jour (1967), her first collaboration with Buñuel, who was moving into the satirical richness of his late French period. The film was released when she was 23, and it crystallized the impression of Deneuve as frigid and untouchable. She handles the trancelike performance—of a naïve newlywed who affirms her sexual proclivities by working in an upscale Parisian brothel—with surgical deftness. Her Séverine smiles nervously and navigates her fashionably furnished apartment with stunted, dollish idleness, sleeping apart from her husband in a twin bed. She is so ill at ease with her body, and clumsy; the lightness of a tennis racket is unwieldy in her hands. But she is convincing as a fetishist even before joining Madame Anaïs at 11 cité Jean de Saumur, her fastidiously buttoned suits, oil-slick patent coats and supple fur-trimmed leather telegraphing a desire for sensorial extremes.\n\nPealing carriage bells and high-pitched mewing cats transition between Séverine’s waking and dreaming lives, cueing her masochistic fantasies, most of which take place in stretches of remote countryside. In the first, she is tied to a tree branch, stripped, and whipped; in another, she is bound with rope again, her draped chiton dress and face, pelted with mud, inspiring ecstasy. The indelible image of her in an austere black shift dress with white collar and cuffs, designed by Yves Saint Laurent, encapsulates the sublimation of one life for another. The film had an incalculable effect on the Milanese fashion designer Miuccia Prada—another architect of double-personality-type women—who told The New Yorker’s Judith Thurman in 2012, “I’m always happiest when dressed almost like a nun.”\n\nSaint Laurent was a friend and a crucial collaborator, outfitting Deneuve for many of her other roles, including as a con-artist mail-order bride in Truffaut’s Mississippi Mermaid (1969) and for Tony Scott’s pulpy, blue-scrimmed vampire debut, The Hunger (1983), where the centuries-old Miriam Blaylock trawls Manhattan’s goth clubs in dark glasses and sternum-baring black looking to feed alongside her husband (David Bowie, obviously). In the daylight, she seduces in round-shouldered ’40s suiting, a specialty of the couturier. (Off-camera, Deneuve was one of the first to wear Saint Laurent’s “Le Smoking” tuxedo after its debut in 1966.) His wardrobes provided a foundation of rarefied consistency, which must have been security to Deneuve, while also offering a mutable identity.\n\nCut to a haughty woman dressed in pristine white Saint Laurent resort wear—the kind made for sun, but not sea or dirt—who jumps ship from a sailboat to be rid of her tedious friends. She lands on a Mediterranean island populated by one man (Marcello Mastroianni), an artist in retreat from the civilized world, and his dog, Melampo, living in a domed structure. There’s frisson almost immediately, as he removes a splinter from her injured foot with his teeth, carrying her across the island on his shoulders. Intent on wholly possessing him, she plots to kill Melampo—and does, wearing his collar, walking around on all fours, licking, barking, and assuming the submissive. In Italian, Marco Ferreri’s Liza (1972) is entitled La cagna—the bitch, and it’s one of Deneuve’s most reprobate roles. Pregnant with her and Mastroianni’s daughter, Chiara, during filming, she even recorded the barking audio for the dog in addition to herself during sound looping—an odd echo of her barking in Lars von Trier’s Dancer in the Dark (2000) decades later, and her line, “I don’t want to play the dog,” an improvisation.\n\nAccording to Truffaut, “With Catherine, there’s a very important element of dreams and a secret life. No matter what role you give her, you have the impression that there’s the role on the screen and then other thoughts that are not expressed. You always think that. She is an actress, I don’t know how else to say it, of dreams, of a dual personality.” With a dexterity in manipulating the fantasy arena of surface appearances, waking dreams, and the schisms of the subconscious, it’s fitting that Deneuve would appear, in 1970, in two nightmarish fairy tales—both concerning motherless daughters grappling with incestuous daddies. Aided by her godmother (Delphine Seyrig), the princess in Demy’s surreal Donkey Skin escapes the prospect of marrying her father, the king, after the death of the queen (also Deneuve, slyly), by leaving under cover of darkness, dressed in the mangy pelt of the castle’s slain gold and gemstone-bearing donkey. In a village far away, she toils at menial tasks, soiled and ostracized, but ends up landing the handsome prince. The second, Tristana, Deneuve’s final collaboration with Buñuel and screenwriter Jean-Claude Carrière—and her self-described favorite—has a different sort of happy ending. In 1920s Toledo, Spain, a pious young orphan is taken in as a ward by Don Lope (Fernando Rey), a lecherous nobleman who insists his role is both father and husband. Even without marriage, he forces her to have sex.\n\nDeneuve plays the young Tristana coltish and goofy, lovingly polishing the silver on her mother’s portrait and fixated on choosing her preference out of pairs: a certain garbanzo bean, a certain street. Don Lope confines her to their rambling, wood-paneled household, and when Tristana falls in love with a painter and moves to Barcelona, the only thing that could inspire her return is the unthinkable, an illness that causes her to lose her leg. Still beautiful, but once again restricted to Don Lope’s domain, Deneuve’s elder Tristana is a commanding presence who succumbs to desperation, then defiant bitterness and spite. The black mantilla she wears to their eventual wedding barely camouflages her disgust; as Deneuve once told Arnaud Desplechin in an interview, she applied her own make-up for Tristana’s final scenes, opting for a ghostly white powder to create a particularly severe pallor. When the time comes for Tristana to enact her revenge, she regrets nothing. I can’t help but recall her first appearance after the credits, slowly advancing across the frame under the diaphanous curtain of a black veil: a smoldering dirge for the rest of her life.\n\nColleen Kelsey is a writer living in New York City."
