Dear Diane , Dear shaded viewers, this

is the kind of film I like to watch in the summer.

DIrected by Marco

Ferreri, Liza (Catherine Deneuve) is in a boat with friends , she is bored and doesn't know what she wants. She dives in the water and

lands on an island where she finds Giorgio (Marcello

Mastroianni) an intellectual and an artist who decided to live in

solitude with his dog Melampo.Giorgio takes care of Liza who is

confused and injured his foot . They have a passionate encounter. Liza leaves because she knows that Girogio is a loner and on top of that she is jelaous of his dog Melampo..She wants to take the place of the dog in GIrogio's heart so she kills it. Liza then becomes the dog of Giorgioâ€¦

I really love this movie and the

handmade sunglasses! Enjoy summertime
