        "text": "Forecasters are warning of possible flash flooding and landslides across the eastern Yucatan peninsula and western Cuba, and Florida is bracing for a possible hurricane by midweek, as a weather system off the coast of Mexico is expected to become a tropical storm by Sunday.\n\nThis weekend warms up and thundershowers will come in to play Saturday afternoon. Sunday looks hot! Temperatures will rise and dewpoints will cool off. Severe weather will play a role in our next rain chances as our next weather system will move through overnight Sunday and into Monday.\n\nHurricane Zeta passed through Wednesday leaving much of the city and metro area without power. Even as Zeta battered the south, the upcoming election was still on the mind of some residents. “Guys, we received the brunt of Zeta, and Zeta gave us a good punch,” McInnis told WDSU-TV. More than 875,000 customers were without electricity in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, including about 350,000 in metro New Orleans. Zeta had top sustained winds of 110 mph (177 kph) as a Category 2 hurricane at landfall and is the 27th named storm of a historically busy Atlantic hurricane season — with over a month left to go.\n\nROANOKE, Va. – 5 p.m. Wednesday updateA Tropical Storm Warning has been issued for many along and south of U.S. 460. Hurricane Zeta has continued to gain strength this afternoon and it’s now a category 2 hurricane with winds of 110 mph. 5 a.m. Tuesday updateZeta made its first landfall along the Yucatan Peninsula and is now emerging into the Gulf of Mexico as a strong tropical storm. Hurricane and tropical storm warnings have been posted in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico and western Cuba ahead of the storm’s arrival. On the forecast track, Zeta will move into the Gulf of Mexico and make landfall late Wednesday along the Gulf Coast.\n\nMIAMI – Newly formed Tropical Storm Zeta gradually strengthened Sunday in the western Caribbean and forecasters said it would likely become a hurricane before hitting Mexico's resort-dotted Yucatan Peninsula and the U.S. Gulf Coast in coming days. Zeta was the earliest named 27th Atlantic storm recorded in an already historic hurricane season. The system was centered about 260 miles (420 kilometers) southeast of Cozumel island late Sunday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. The government is still handing out aid, including sheet roofing, to Yucatan residents hit by Hurricane Delta and Tropical Storm Gamma earlier this month. The hurricane center said it could make landfall anywhere from Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle.\n\nThis photo provided by Greg Crippen shows the scene where a U.S. Navy training plane crashed in an Alabama residential neighborhood near the Gulf Coast, Friday, Oct. 23, 2020 near Foley, Ala. (Greg Crippen via AP)FOLEY, Ala. – A U.S. Navy training plane that took off from Florida crashed Friday in an Alabama residential neighborhood near the Gulf Coast, killing both people in the plane, authorities said. Zach Harrell, a spokesperson for Commander, Naval Air Forces, said both people in the T-6B Texan II training plane died, but they weren't immediately releasing their names. The crash occurred southeast of Mobile, near the city of Foley and the town of Magnolia Springs. The plane had flown out of Naval Air Station Whiting Field, about 30 miles (48.28 kilometers) northeast of Pensacola, Florida, Navy spokeswoman Julie Ziegenhorn said. The U.S. Department of Defense and the Navy were set to handle the investigation, the Baldwin County Sheriff’s Office tweeted.\n\nLouisiana residents still recovering from the devastation of a powerful hurricane less than two months ago braced for another hit as Hurricane Delta steamed north through the Gulf on Thursday after swiping Mexicos Yucatan Peninsula. The projected path included the southwest area of Louisiana where Category 4 Hurricane Laura made landfall less than two months ago. Randazzo watched pieces of one of his restaurants, Panorama Music House, fly past a meteorologist’s car on a Facebook Live video during Hurricane Laura. The most recent forecast for Hurricane Delta has the storm making landfall “almost precisely” where Hurricane Laura struck — a region where homes and electrical infrastructure are still damaged, Edwards said in a radio interview. New Orleans, well to the east of the projected landfall area, was expected to escape the worst of Hurricane Delta.\n\nThe storm being watched Wednesday was Hurricane Delta, the 25th named storm of the Atlantic's unprecedented hurricane season. Forecasts placed most of Louisiana within Delta's path, with the latest National Hurricane Center estimating landfall in the state on Friday. Along with getting hit by Hurricane Laura and escaping Hurricane Sally, Louisiana saw heavy flooding June 7 from Tropical Storm Cristobal. Tropical Storm Beta prompted tropical storm warnings in mid-September as it slowly crawled up the northeast Texas coast. “Not seeing any signs of any additional tropical weather in the extended which is OK with us because we are SO DONE with Hurricane Season 2020,” they wrote.\n\n5:00 a.m. Sunday UpdateROANOKE, Va. – The National Hurricane Center says Delta has become a post-tropical cyclone, but it’s still a heavy rainfall threat. 5:00 p.m. Friday UpdateHurricane Delta is expected to make landfall on the southwestern Louisiana coast within the next few hours. Delta is expected to bring hurricane conditions and life-threatening storm surge to portions of the northern gulf coast on Friday. 11:00 p.m. Wednesday UpdateAs of 11 p.m., Hurricane Delta has maximum sustained winds near 90 mph with higher gusts. 5 p.m. Tuesday UpdateCategory 4 Hurricane Delta continues to strengthen as it approaches the Yucatan Peninsula.\n\nFishermen pull in a boat before the arrival of Hurricane Delta in Puerto Juarez, Cancun, Mexico, Tuesday, Oct. 6, 2020.

The post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the east near 15 mph, and this motion is expected to continue tonight and Monday morning. Maximum sustained winds are near 15 mph (30 km/h) with higher gusts. Some further weakening is possible tonight as a new surface low develops in the Carolinas, and Delta's surface low is expected to be absorbed by this new low pressure area on Monday. Moderate to major river flooring will continue across the Calcasieu and Mermentau river basins in Louisiana through much of next week\n\nForecasters said Beta was not expected to bring the same amount of rainfall that Texas experienced during either Hurricane Harvey in 2017 or Tropical Storm Imelda last year. The first rain bands from Beta reached the Texas coast on Sunday, but the heaviest rain wasn't expected to arrive until Monday into Tuesday. If the system makes landfall in Texas, it would be the ninth named storm to make landfall in the continental U.S. in 2020. A tropical storm warning was in effect for Bermuda. Wilfred, which had been a tropical storm, weakened to a tropical depression earlier Sunday.\n\nROANOKE, Va. – 5 p.m. UpdateTropical Depression 22 is now Tropical Storm Beta in the Gulf of Mexico. Beta will likely form Friday as well in the Gulf of Mexico. Friday Morning UpdateJust a day after Sally’s remnants dumped rain on our region, the Atlantic hurricane season strikes again. Tropical Storm Wilfred forms in the open AtlanticThis is the last name on the list for the 2020 season. 2020 hurricane namesIt’s remarkable to run out of names, but it’s especially remarkable considering hurricane season doesn’t end until November 30th.\n\n– As rain and wind from Sally starting reaching the Gulf Coast, the manager of a Mississippi alligator ranch was just hoping he wouldn’t have to deal with a repeat of what happened during Hurricane Katrina. That’s when about 250 alligators escaped their enclosures as storm surge pushed water over the grounds. “I’m thinking a sigh of relief somewhat,” said manager Tim Parker, who took over Gulf Coast Gator Ranch & Tours after Katrina. As the hurricane moved east of Mississippi, the surge forecast was reduced to no more than 4 feet (1.2 meters). Parker’s farm has alligators up to 14 feet long, roaming and swimming through ponds, sand dunes and tall marsh grass.\n\nROANOKE, Va. – The eye wall of Hurricane Sally continues to lash the Alabama Gulf Coast and Florida Panhandle Wednesday morning, with reports of 12-18″ of rain already. Life-threatening flooding and extreme wind are both ongoing and expected to continue in these areas throughout the day Wednesday. The higher rain totals will be closer to the storm, so for us that means areas south of U.S. 460. The farther north you go, the lesser rain totals will be.

The county includes Pensacola, one of the largest cities on the Gulf Coast. Landfall was expected on the northern Gulf Coast early Wednesday. Although the hurricane had the Alabama and Florida coasts in its sights Wednesday, its effects were felt all along the northern Gulf Coast. With Hurricane Sally expected to dump rain for days, the problem could be worse than normal, she said.\n\nPeople play in a flooded parking lot at Navarre Beach, Tuesday, Sept. 15, 2020, in Pensacola Beach, Fla.

Volunteers from the Southwest Virginia chapter have provided assistance after disasters for years, but that response looks different this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Executive director Jackie Grant said they’re still sending people to affected areas for relief, but now they’re working with FEMA and the CDC to make sure they also protect people from the pandemic. “Some of these more serious disasters like Laura and impending Sally and the wildfires out in the west, we’re having to open emergency shelters but again having all those safety precautions in place,” Grant said.

Bren Haase, who heads the states Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, said the eastern Cameron shoreline got pounded pretty hard.\" SALINITY'S A PROBLEMAnother question is how long storm surge waters sit before eventually draining away. Laura took a slight jog to the East just before making landfall which probably prevented some of the worst storm surge from pushing all the way into Lake Charles. This might be in part because the storm blew through so quickly and the storm surge was so high that it simply rode over the marshes, rather than tearing them up.\n\nA girl wades towards her flooded home the day after the passing of Tropical Storm Laura in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Monday, Aug. 24, 2020.

A re-energized Tropical Storm Cristobal advanced toward the U.S. Gulf Coast early Saturday, bringing with it the heavy rains that already caused flooding and mudslides in Mexico and Central America. After weakening to a tropical depression while moving over land in Mexico's Gulf coast, Cristobal headed back into the southern Gulf of Mexico from the Yucatan Peninsula on Friday and powered back up into a tropical storm. Outer rain bands from the storm were spreading across parts of the northern Gulf Coast early Sunday, and conditions were expected to deteriorate. A tropical storm warning was posted for the northern Gulf of Mexico coast from Intracoastal City, Louisiana, to the Alabama-Florida border.\n\nROANOKE, Va. According to the National Hurricane Center, Tropical Storm Cristobal officially made landfall in southeast Louisiana on Sunday evening. Tropical storm warnings remain in effect along the Gulf Coast from Louisiana to the panhandle of Flordia.

After weakening to a tropical depression while moving over land in Mexico's Gulf coast, Cristobal headed back into the southern Gulf of Mexico from the Yucatan Peninsula on Friday and powered back up into a tropical storm. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said in its 7 a.m. advisory Saturday that the storm was expected to slowly strengthen until it makes landfall, expected Sunday night along the U.S. Gulf Coast. A tropical storm watch was posted for the northern Gulf of Mexico coast from Intracoastal City, Louisiana, to the Alabama-Florida border. Cristobal formed this week in the Bay of Campeche from the remnants of Tropical Storm Amanda, which had sprung up last weekend in the eastern Pacific and hit Central America.\n\n(CNN) - Tropical Storm Olga was downgraded to a post-tropical cyclone Friday night as it continued to move toward the Gulf Coast. The central Gulf Coast into the Lower Mississippi Valley and western Tennessee Valley is expected to receive 3-6 inches of rain Saturday morning, forecasters said. Olga, previously a tropical depression, was upgraded to a tropical storm Friday afternoon. A tropical depression has wind speeds of less than 39 mph, while a tropical storm can reach wind speeds of up to 73 mph. There are currently no tropical cyclone watches or warnings in effect.\n\nMarianna Massey/Getty Images(CNN) - The first bands of Tropical Storm Nestor are beginning to affect the Gulf Coast, the National Hurricane Center said Friday afternoon. The system gained tropical storm status and had maximum sustained winds of 60 miles per hour. Surges of 1 to 3 feet were possible in Tampa Bay, the hurricane center said. \"Persons located within these (storm surge warning) areas should take all necessary actions to protect life and property from rising water and the potential for other dangerous conditions.\" Winds and rainTropical-storm-force winds of 39 mph and higher are expected Friday in the tropical storm warning areas.\n\nCNN image(CNN) - A disorganized area of storms in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to develop into a tropical or subtropical storm Thursday as it heads toward the U.S. Gulf Coast, the National Hurricane Center said. The system is expected to continue to intensify, and tropical storm watches and warnings and storm surge watches have been issued for parts of the Gulf Coast, from Louisiana into Florida. The storms will also bring heavy rain and possible flooding tomorrow and through the weekend from the Gulf Coast into the Southeast. The system is expected to begin moving northeast toward the U.S. Gulf Coast, with a potential landfall along the north-central Gulf region Saturday. Regardless of tropical formation, the system could bring heavy rainfall and high winds to Gulf Coast states.\n\nFrom Morgan City, Louisiana across Mississippi and Alabama, the Gulf Coast is dealing with flooding from Barry. Barry -- which weakened to a tropical depression Sunday as it moved slowly north across Louisiana and into Arkansas -- had put Louisiana on high alert for much of the weekend with a threat of epic flooding. But the storm did dump significant rain on already inundated parishes, causing flooding, and authorities still warn that more water could be on the way. A stormy weekendHeavy rains and strong winds brought flooding and storm surges to several parishes throughout the state, causing power outages and road closures Saturday. Entergy Louisiana said it brought in crews from all over the country to assist with repairs to equipment and restoration efforts.\n\nROANOKE, Va. - The weekend is looking absolutely fantastic in terms of staying dry. Granted, itll be hot and humid with highs each day topping out in the low to mid-90s. Spotty showers will be possible late Monday as temperatures warm into the low to mid 90s. Highs from Tuesday through the rest of the work week will top out in the upper 80s and lower 90s. Regardless, it is expected to bring a lot of rainfall to the central Gulf Coast, lower Mississippi Valley and the Tennessee Valley through the weekend and into early next week.\n\n(CNN) - Tropical Storm Barry, the first tropical system to strike the US this year, is just off the Gulf Coast and gaining power. Here's what you should know:How strong is the storm and where is it? Barry is expected to grow into a hurricane by the time it makes landfall, the National Hurricane Center said. While wind is a huge threat in tropical systems, the dangers here are posed by heavy rainfall, storm surge and flooding, authorities have emphasized. The worst weather during hurricanes is typically found closest to the eye of the storm, but that's not necessarily the case with tropical storms that are still forming, like Barry.\n\n\"There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge inundation along the coast of southern and southeastern Louisiana,\" the National Weather Service said. What exactly is storm surge? The rise in water levels, known as storm surge, happens when winds from a fierce storm push water up and onto shore. Forecasters said the stronger the storm, the stronger the winds and the higher the storm surge will be. Rising water is the deadliest part of a stormWhen a big storm approaches, many people worry about wind and debris.\n\nROANOKE, Va. - Following Thursday's storms, we're left with some humidity but also a little bit of a breeze too. Just be mindful each afternoon that as temperatures rise, and the humidity stays fairly typical, the heat index will go up too. Meanwhile, parts of the Gulf Coast are preparing for the inevitable landfall of Tropical Storm Barry. This will bring a lot of rain and serious flooding to parts of Louisiana, Mississippi and perhaps even west Tennessee. That could wind up bringing us increased rain and storm chances, if the center of the storm can drift east enough.\n\nDelta Airlines via CNNNEW ORLEANS - As the newly named Tropical Storm Barry barrels toward the Gulf Coast, several airlines have announced that they're offering travel waivers. United Airlines says it's issuing travel waivers for those whose trips include about a dozen airports along the Gulf Coast through Sunday. As Barry moves west through the Gulf of Mexico, Southwest Airlines shows travel waivers through Saturday for those on flights involving Panama City Beach and Pensacola, Florida. Delta has a travel waiver listed on its website through Sunday for those traveling through six airports in the region. The travel alert website for American Airlines offers travelers going through seven Gulf Coast airports, including New Orleans and Baton Rouge, the chance to rebook without change fees.\n\njoe Raedle/Getty Images(CNN) - While many Americans along the Gulf Coast are bracing for torrential rain and a possible hurricane, millions of others are dreading the oppressive heat to come in the next few days. More than 6.5 million people are under an excessive heat warning, including residents of Phoenix. Above normal temperatures in the Arizona capital could factor into heat indexes close to 120 degrees on Friday and Saturday. On Wednesday the temperature alone was headed toward 110 degrees and Thursday will be hotter. Medical experts say it is important during heat waves to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids.\n\nJason Oxenham/Getty Images(CNN) - Beachgoers heading to the Gulf Coast this week could be greeted by the first tropical storm of the Atlantic hurricane season. \"A tropical depression is expected to form by Thursday from a broad area of low pressure moving slowly westward over the northern Gulf of Mexico,\" the National Hurricane Center said. If that happens, we'll see the first tropical depression of the 2019 season. But what if the tropical depression doesn't happen? \"Even if the system doesn't fully develop, very heavy rains are forecast along the Gulf Coast region, with up to 10 to 15 inches of rain possible along the future path of the storm,\" Hennen said.\n\nROANOKE, Va. - Monday morning starts with some areas of dense fog after storms moved through once again Sunday. The still air and tropical moisture will keep fog around until 8 or 9 a.m. Monday. A front to our north is going to help trigger some scattered showers and storms. We lose the tropical moisture, but keep the typical summertime humidity around for the middle of the week. The National Hurricane Center has a 70% chance of this system turning tropical, at which point is would become \"Barry.\"\n\nAlong the state's Gulf Coast, all 21 of the state's beaches have been shut down for swimming due to a blue-green harmful algal bloom (HAB), according to the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ). The toxic algae can cause rashes, stomach cramps, nausea, diarrhea and vomiting, the state agency warned. In fact, every US coastal and Great Lakes state experiences them, the NOAA says. However, they are popping up with increasing frequency due to climate change and increasing nutrient pollution, according to the NOAA. If you think you may have been exposed to toxic algae, the CDC recommends calling your local poison information center or consulting your doctor about managing symptoms.\n\n2005: Hurricane Katrina makes landfall as a Category 3 hurricane in southeast Louisiana. Katrina would go on to devastate much of the U.S. Gulf Coast from Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle, killing more than 1,836 and causing more than $80 billion in damage. The most significant number of deaths occurred in New Orleans, which flooded after the city's levee system catastrophically failed, in many cases hours after the storm had moved inland. Hide Caption"
