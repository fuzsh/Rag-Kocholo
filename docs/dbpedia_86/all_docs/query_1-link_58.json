        "text": "Governor Kathy Hochul today urged New Yorkers to prepare for a lake effect weather system that is expected to dump more than a foot of snow in locations near Lakes Ontario and Erie starting Monday and continuing into Tuesday evening. For areas near Lake Erie, a widespread 6-12” of snow is expected beginning Monday morning in areas south of Buffalo, with up to 18” possible in parts of southern Erie, Chautauqua, and Cattaraugus counties. For areas near Lake Ontario, beginning Monday afternoon, a widespread 6-12” of snow is expected in areas east of the lake and up to two feet of snow possible in the Tug Hill area. Snowfall rates could reach up to three inches per hour where the snow is heaviest, and wind gusts up to 35 mph are possible in these locations through Tuesday. The rest of Western New York, including the City of Buffalo, and the Finger Lakes regions are expected to receive up to six inches of snow in some locations. New Yorkers should use extra caution when traveling in impacted areas, especially during commuting hours, as weather conditions will likely cause blowing snow and reduce visibility on roads.\n\n“The most hazardous weather conditions will be in the areas where lake effect snow bands form and produce a lot of snow in a short period, which will hamper travel in some places for the next day or so,” Governor Hochul said. “There is still some uncertainty where and when snow bands will form and the heaviest snow will fall, so use extra caution when traveling and stay on top of the forecast throughout this event so you can plan your travel and other activities accordingly. My team will monitor this weather system and its impacts throughout this event and are ready to assist partners at the local level as needed.”\n\nA Lake Effect Snow Warning is in effect Monday through late Tuesday night for southern Erie, Chautauqua, Cattaraugus, Wyoming, Oswego, Jefferson, and Lewis counties. A Winter Storm Watch for possible heavy lake effect snow is also in effect Monday afternoon through late Tuesday night for northern Oneida, northern Herkimer, and Hamilton counties. Through Monday, most of the rest of the state is forecast to receive up to an inch of rain and higher elevations could see a few inches of snow, causing Monday morning commutes to be potentially unsafe in some places.\n\nFor a complete listing of weather alerts and forecasts, visit the National Weather Service website at https://alerts.weather.gov.

Statewide equipment numbers and resources are listed below:\n\n359 large and medium duty plow trucks\n\n9 tow plows\n\n65 loaders\n\nMore than 130,000 tons of salt on hand\n\nVariable Message Signs and social media are utilized to alert motorists of winter weather conditions on the Thruway.\n\nThe Thruway Authority encourages motorists to download its mobile app which is available for free on iPhone and Android devices. The app provides motorists direct access to real-time traffic information, live traffic cameras, and navigation assistance while on the go. Motorists can also sign up for TRANSalert e-mails which provide the latest traffic conditions along the Thruway.\n\nNew York State Department of Public Service\n\nUtility companies regulated by the Department of Public Service have approximately 5,500 workers available statewide to engage in repair and restoration efforts for the winter weather system. DPS staff will track utilities' work throughout the event and ensure utility companies shift appropriate staffing to regions that experience the greatest impact. If your service is interrupted, visit the DPS Utility Service Interruptions website for tips.\n\nNew York State Police\n\nState Police are monitoring weather conditions and are prepared to deploy additional Troopers as needed. All State Police four-wheel drive and specialized vehicles, including snowmobiles and utility terrain vehicles, are staged and ready for immediate response, and all emergency power and communications equipment has been tested.\n\nNew York State Department of Environmental Conservation\n\nDEC Emergency Management staff, Environmental Conservation Police Officers, Forest Rangers, and regional staff are on alert and monitoring the developing situation.

Additional information on winter hiking is available at https://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/112826.html.\n\nNew York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation\n\nNew York State Park Police and park personnel are on alert and closely monitoring weather conditions and impacts. Response equipment is being fueled, tested, and prepared for storm response use. Park visitors should check parks.ny.gov or call their local park office for the latest updates regarding park hours, openings, and closings.\n\nSafety Tips\n\nTravel\n\nSome of the most important tips for safe driving include:\n\nDo not drive unless necessary.\n\nIf you must travel, make sure your car is stocked with survival gear like blankets, a shovel, flashlight and extra batteries, extra warm clothing, set of tire chains, battery booster cables, quick energy foods and brightly colored cloth to use as a distress flag.\n\nIf you have a cell phone or other communications device such as a two-way radio available for your use, keep the battery charged and keep it with you whenever traveling. If you should become stranded, you will be able to call for help, advising rescuers of your location.\n\nThe leading cause of death and injuries during winter storms is transportation accidents. Before getting behind the wheel, make sure that your vehicle is clear of ice and snow; good vision is key to good driving. Plan your stops and keep more distance between cars. Be extra alert and remember that snowdrifts can hide smaller children. Always match your speed to the road and weather conditions.\n\nIt is important for motorists on all roads to note that snowplows travel at speeds up to 35 mph, which in many cases is lower than the posted speed limit, to ensure that salt being dispersed stays in the driving lanes and does not scatter off the roadways. Oftentimes on interstate highways, snowplows will operate side by side, as this is the most efficient and safe way to clear several lanes at one time.\n\nMotorists and pedestrians should also keep in mind that snowplow drivers have limited lines of sight, and the size and weight of snowplows can make it very difficult to maneuver and stop quickly. Snow blowing from behind the plow can severely reduce visibility or cause whiteout conditions. Motorists should not attempt to pass snowplows or follow too closely. The safest place for motorists to drive is well behind the snowplows where the roadway is clear and salted. Never attempt to pass a snowplow while its operating.\n\nPower Outages\n\nCheck with your utility to determine area repair schedules.\n\nTurn off or unplug lights and appliances to prevent a circuit overload when service is restored; leave one light on to indicate when power has been restored.\n\nIf heat goes out during a winter storm, keep warm by closing off rooms you do not need.\n\nTo Report an Electric Outage, Call:\n\nCentral Hudson: 800-527-2714\n\nCon Edison: 800-752-6633\n\nNational Grid: 800-867-5222\n\nNYSEG: 800-572-1131\n\nO&R: 877-434-4100\n\nPSEG-LI: 800-490-0075\n\nRG&E: 800-743-1701\n\nHeating Safety\n\nUse only safe sources of alternative heat such as a fireplace, small well-vented wood or coal stove or portable space heaters.\n\nWhen using alternative heat sources such as a fireplace, woodstove, etc. always make sure you have proper ventilation. Always follow manufacturer's instructions.\n\nKeep curtains, towels, and potholders away from hot surfaces.\n\nHave a fire extinguisher and smoke detectors and make sure they work.\n\nIf you use kerosene heaters to supplement your regular heating fuel, or as an emergency source of heat, follow these safety tips:\n\nFollow the manufacturers' instructions.\n\nUse only the correct fuel for your unit.\n\nRefuel outdoors only and only when the unit is cool.\n\nKeep the heater at least three feet away from furniture and other flammable objects.\n\nWhen using the heater, use fire safeguards and ventilate properly.\n\nFor more winter safety tips, visit https://dhses.ny.gov/safety.
