        "text": "Syracuse, N.Y. -- Forecasters are increasingly confident that a powerful winter storm will hit the Northeast Wednesday and Thursday, but the exact path of the storm is still uncertain and subject to change.\n\nThe seeds of that storm system are over Nevada now, but they’re expected to churn across the Southeast and then turn left at the East Coast mid-week. As that coastal storm heads north, a high pressure system of very cold air from Canada will push into Upstate New York, raising the odds that whatever precipitation comes our way will be in the form of snow.\n\nBut how much? The most recent forecasts from the National Weather Service show the storm path farther east than it appeared last week. That means the best chances for heavy snow, beginning late Wednesday, will be the Hudson Valley, eastern Southern Tier and Capital Region. The weather service is predicting about 10 inches of snow for Poughkeepsie, 6 for Binghamton, and 4 for Albany.\n\nThe weather service has issued a hazardous weather outlook for those areas.\n\n“Uncertainty still exists, but there is increasing confidence for a widespread accumulating snow, possibly heavy and impacting travel,” the outlook says. “This may include high snowfall rates from late Wednesday through Wednesday night.”\n\nMuch less snow is predicted to the north and west. Syracuse is expected to get an inch or 2, while Western New York gets a dusting.\n\nThat could change.\n\n“A sharp cutoff is currently showing up with this storm as well where accumulations could have wide variations, with locations only a few miles apart having vastly different totals,” said the weather service office in Binghamton, which forecasts for the Southern Tier and Central New York. “Given this is still 3-4 days away, the exact track and intensity of the storm is still uncertain.”\n\nThe worst of the storm’s impacts look to be in southern New England. The weather service in Boston is warning of heavy snow, high winds and coastal flooding.\n\nThere are lots of moving parts, forecasters say. The coastal storm is expected to form near North Carolina early Wednesday, with a second low pressure system likely heading northeast out of Kentucky. Those two systems will merge somewhere around New Jersey, with the coastal storm picking up the extra energy. As it reaches the Northeast, that strengthening storm will run into that high pressure of very cold air, which is bringing temperatures of 20 below or colder today to the Canadian plains.\n\nIt won’t get that cold in Upstate New York, but temperatures are expected to fall into the teens overnight and below freezing during the day in the middle of the week. The weekend looks warmer, with highs in the 30s.\n\nBefore we get to the coastal storm, though, there’s a potential for some lake effect snow in Western and Central New York this afternoon and tonight. Forecasters aren’t expecting a lot of snow, but in those areas where narrow lake effect bands linger, up to 4 inches could fall.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nBrace yourself for a snowier-than-normal winter in CNY\n\n25 Things That Make Syracuse Great: Snow"
