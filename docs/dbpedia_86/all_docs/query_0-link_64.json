        "text": "A winter storm is forecast to strike Chicagoland Tuesday night February 1, 2022 through Wednesday, with accumulating snow of a lesser disturbance and also light Lake Effect Snow (LES) likely to linger into Thursday.\n\nOvernight DuPage and Kendall counties were added to the Winter Storm Warning, as snow amounts in excess of 6 inches looks probable at these locations as well, especially in southern sections of these counties. Arlington Heights was upgraded to a Winter Weather Advisory overnight.\n\nO”Hare International Airport is in the Winter Storm Warning category, while just north of the airport in Des Plaines, southern Mount Prospect, and southern Arlington Heights is in the Winter Weather Advisory category.\n\nConfidence continues to increase with very heavy snowfall amounts materializing, with amounts up to and even exceeding a foot likely in southern parts of Chicagoland through early Wednesday evening. Unfortunately, however, uncertainties continue to be above average with forecast snowfall amounts across far northern IL, especially along and north of I-88, where a sharp northwest to southeast gradient in snow amounts is likely to reside.\n\nOvernight on the ECMWF weather model Arlington Heights snowfall accumulation wavered between 4.7 inches and 5.3 inches.\n\nAt 7:15 AM the NWS Chicago office forecast the following accumulation outlooks showing the gradient from south to north …\n\nO’Hare International Airport\n\n5.6″ Tuesday 6 PM to Thursday 11 AM\n\nLake Briarwood in south Arlington Heights\n\n4.6″ Tuesday 6 PM to Thursday 11 AM\n\nDowntown Arlington Heights\n\n3.8″ Tuesday 6 PM to Thursday 11 AM\n\nLake Terramere in north Arlington Heights\n\n2.9″ Tuesday 6 PM to Thursday 11 AM\n\nGlobal Weather Models on Arlingtoncardinal.com/snow\n\nECMWF — European Model\n\nGFS — Global Forecast System US\n\nBreezy southerly winds developed across the area overnight in the warm sector of a strong area low pressure shifting eastward into far southwestern Ontario. Temperatures have responded by steadily warming into the lower 30s through the night, and this warm start to the day will help push temperatures into the low- to mid-40s for highs early Tuesday afternoon in advance of an approaching cold front. The cold front will move over the area early this evening. Precipitation, likely initially in the form of rain, will develop in the vicinity of the front this afternoon over parts of northeastern Illinois into northwestern Indiana. The rain will then change to snow from northwest to southeast through the evening as colder air filters into the area.\n\nThe complicating factor to the snow forecast tonight is that a drier low level airmass will be trying to undercut the better moisture shifting in from the south tonight. This is likely to prohibit snow from reaching the ground (due to sublimation) across parts of far northern/northwestern Illinois where the drier lower level airmass looks to become the most pronounced. A sharp northwest to southeast gradient in snowfall amounts is thus likely to set up somewhere across far northern Illinois into Wednesday morning.\n\nWhere it does snow tonight into Wednesday (likely across most of the warned and advisory areas), the the rates are likely to be moderate to heavy at times (1″+ per hour). The period of highest rates is expected to be after midnight tonight through early Wednesday afternoon. During this period, forecast guidance continues to develop a strong and rather persistent low-to-mid level frontogenetic circulation over the area in association with a strengthening baroclinic zone and beneath the favorable entrance (exit) region of an Upper Great Lakes (southern and central Plains) jet streak. Together, this should produce deep and strong forced ascent through the dendritic growth zone, and through an elevated layer of rather steep lapse rates (in excess of 6.5C per KM). Moisture should also become plentiful, especially in the waring area, where a feed of deeper Gulf Moisture is expected. Significant snow accumulations up to, and even a bit above a foot are forecast through early Wednesday evening, especially across southern sections of the area. This will most certainly create dangerous travel conditions across the area late tonight through Wednesday.\n\nNOTE: The second system is less likely to have much punch (including accumulation) as forecast time approaches storm time.\n\nAdditional snow accumulations continue to look probable Wednesday night into Thursday in association with the next wave shifting out of the southwestern Continental United States. However, the main area with a threat of at least a few additional inches of snow is expected to be in the southern/southeastern area (east central Illinois and into parts of northwestern Indiana). Farther to the north, lake effect/enhanced snow showers may result in some additional accumulations across parts of northeastern Illinois on Thursday. However, the lake effect parameters do not look overly impressive, so any additional snow amounts look to be on the light side, and likely not of warning caliber impacts. Any lingering snow should end across the area late Thursday, according to the NWS Chicago office.\n\nWeather Radar in northeast Illinois was clear.\n\nSee also Arlingtoncardinal.com/clouds\n\nROUND 1 SNOW\n\nROUND 2 SNOW\n\nWinter Weather Advisory URGENT – WINTER WEATHER MESSAGE National Weather Service Chicago IL 238 AM CST Tue Feb 1 2022\n\nILZ010>012-103-011645- /O.NEW.KLOT.WW.Y.0007.220202T0200Z-220203T0000Z/ Lee-De Kalb-Kane-Northern Cook- Including the cities of Dixon, DeKalb, Sycamore, Aurora, Elgin, Evanston, Des Plaines, Schaumburg, Palatine, and Northbrook 238 AM CST Tue Feb 1 2022\n\n…WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN EFFECT FROM 8 PM THIS EVENING TO 6 PM CST WEDNESDAY…\n\n* WHAT…Snow and slippery travel expected.
