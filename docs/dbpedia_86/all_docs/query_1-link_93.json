        "text": "A cold front has moved through Michigan today, and behind it lake-effect snow showers have set up shop in the Upper Peninsula. These snow showers will stick around into Wednesday, and give us some accumulating snow, especially in the eastern part of the U.P.\n\nSnow showers are currently ongoing across parts of the northern Upper Peninsula. These showers are going to continue into tonight and intensify across the eastern Upper Peninsula. A Winter Weather Advisory is in place for Chippewa, Alger, Luce, and Northern Schoolcraft counties until 7 a.m. Wednesday, when the snow showers are expected to dissipate.\n\nWhen it comes to snow totals, the eastern Upper Peninsula is going to get the most snow in Northern Michigan. Amounts of 6 to 8 inches of snow are expected for that part of the peninsula, with isolated areas potentially seeing up to 9 inches of snowfall between today and tomorrow morning. Besides the band of high snowfall totals, 4 to 6 and 6 to 8 inches of snow is likely for other areas in the easter Upper Peninsula.\n\nOther parts of the Upper Peninsula can expect some snow, but it wonâ€™t be as much. In the northern counties of the western Upper Peninsula, 1 to 2 inches of snow is expected by tomorrow morning, with areas surrounding that only getting a dusting at most. The northern Lower Peninsula could also see some accumulation from lake-effect off of Lake Michigan, with totals around 1 to 2 inches.\n\nBesides snow, the winds will also be a problem for today and tonight. Winds could gust between 35 and 40 mph during this lake-effect event before dying down later on. This will cause blowing and drifting snow, especially in areas where more snow is expected, and could lead to dangerous travel conditions due to snow covering the roads and reduced visibility.\n\nAny snow showers will come to an end early tomorrow morning as conditions become unfavorable for lake-effect snow. This will leave us with dry conditions for the rest of the day."
