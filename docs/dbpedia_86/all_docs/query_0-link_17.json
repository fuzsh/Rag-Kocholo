        "text": "CHICAGO (CBS) -- A Winter Storm Warning will be in effect on Thursday for Lake and McHenry counties, due to the potential for 4 to 6 inches of snowfall, especially near the Illinois-Wisconsin state line.\n\nThe Rockford, Milwaukee, and Janesville areas are also under the winter storm warning. It runs until 9 p.m. Thursday.\n\nA Winter Weather Advisory will be in effect on Thursday for Cook County and the western suburbs, due to the likelihood of slippery travel especially in the afternoon. All of Cook, DuPage, Will, Kane, Kendall, Grundy, DeKalb, and LaSalle counties are affected. It is also in effect from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. Thursday.\n\nThursday morning: A rain and sleet mix for Chicago and most of the western suburbs. Wet snow will be increasing through the morning from DeKalb to McHenry to Waukegan and points northward. Areas south of I-80 will have a chance for rain and freezing rain, where a light glaze of ice is possible.\n\nThursday afternoon: Snow for areas north of I-80. Some of the snow could be heavy for locations near the Wisconsin and Illinois state line. Areas south of I-80 will have mainly a rain and sleet mix.\n\nSlippery travel is likely, especially for the afternoon and evening commute. The most hazardous travel will be in McHenry and Lake County (Illinois), that's where a Winter Storm Warning will be in effect all day Thursday.\n\nSnowfall amounts from Thursday morning to Friday morning: Four to six inches near the Wisconsin and Illinois state line, in McHenry and Lake County (Illinois). Areas along I-88 will be in the range of two to four inches. Lighter amounts south of I-88 and mainly rain south of I-80.\n\nIsolated locations of 4 inches will be possible in Northwest Indiana, thanks to lake effect snow late Thursday into Friday morning.\n\nTONIGHT: Cloudy skies with a chance for rain and sleet overnight. Low 32°\n\nTHURSDAY: A rain and sleet mix in the morning, then snow likely in the afternoon. High 34°"
