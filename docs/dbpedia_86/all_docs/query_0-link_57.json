Take a look at the beautiful satellite imagery of our great state this morning. You can see the snow covered ground for much of the state where the clouds are not obscuring the ground. From a consensus standpoint, the GFS, UKMET and GEM models all keep the storm far enough south to miss us completely. However, what makes me nervous is that the one model that hits us with a solid snowfall is that trusty ECMWF model.\n\nHow familiar are you with all the storm terms and hurricane categories? Do you know the difference between a Category 2 storm and a Category 5?\n\nWAYNE COUNTY, Mich. – A severe thunderstorm warning issued for Wayne County expired at 4 p.m. Monday.

The Liquor Control Commission, which is the sole wholesaler of liquor in Michigan, uses three private distributors.
