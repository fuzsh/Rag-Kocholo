        "text": "Editor's note: The below updates are from Wednesday, Aug. 7. Click here to see live updates during the day Thursday, Aug. 8.\n\nAs Tropical Storm Debby continues to make its way up the coast toward North Carolina, heavy rain bands and flooding have been reported across the Cape Fear region.\n\nThe storm is expected to move slowly off the South Carolina coast through Wednesday. Debby may make landfall late Wednesday night or early Thursday morning along the South Carolina coast, then begin moving northward Thursday night and Friday, according to the National Weather Service in Wilmington.\n\nThe Cape Fear region is expected to see historic rainfall amounts, with up to 15 inches possible.\n\nThe StarNews will be providing live updates throughout the day, so check back regularly for the latest news associated with Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nTropical Storm Debby: The latest on what to expect in the Wilmington area\n\nTRACK THE STORM: See the latest path for Tropical Storm Debby\n\nBrunswick County has reopened the public shelter at Town Creek Middle School as of 9:30 p.m. on Wednesday, according to a news release from the county.\n\nThe shelter, located at 6370 Lake Park Dr. SE in Winnabow, had previously suspended operations at 5:30 p.m. Wednesday. Brunswick County is reopening the shelter based on current and future estimated conditions from Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nPeople using the shelter are encouraged to bring enough clothing, medication, toiletries, pet food, and other essential items for three or more days. Domestic cats and dogs are allowed. More details on what to expect at a public shelter and recommended items to bring are at brunswickcountync.gov/shelters.\n\n-- Owen Hassell\n\nDuke Energy was reporting only a few hundred outages in the Wilmington area Wednesday evening as Tropical Storm Debby draws closer to the Cape Fear region.\n\nThe region’s primary power provider showed the biggest outage area in New Hanover County, with just over 200 customers losing power, was in the Lansdowne neighborhood at the end of 17th Street Extension in Wilmington. A few dozen outages also were reported in Ogden, Kings Grant and near the Cape Fear Hospital on Wrightsville Avenue as of 9:30 p.m.\n\nBrunswick Electric was showing no power outages in Brunswick County, and only 41 customers out of power in Columbus County.\n\nAt Wilmington International Airport, three arriving American Airlines' flights from Charlotte and one from Philadelphia were shown as canceled Wednesday night. Subsequent departing flights to the same locations Thursday morning also were canceled.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear if those flight cancellations were related to Debby or other factors.\n\nThe N.C. Department of Transportation also wasn’t reporting any major road closures, although the Brunswick County Sheriff’s Office and the Surf City Police Department had reported standing water on some roadways.\n\nReports of flooded roads and road closures in Wilmington also were slowly filtering in after a heavy rain band moved through New Hanover County early Wednesday evening.\n\n-- Gareth McGrath\n\nTropical Storm Debby continued to soak Southeastern North Carolina Wednesday evening as it moved ever closer, albeit at a snail's pace, to the Tar Heel State.\n\nAccording to the 8 p.m. National Hurricane Center advisory, the weak tropical storm was 75 miles south-southwest of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. The storm, with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph, was moving north at a lethargic 3 mph.\n\nDebby is forecast to make landfall south of Myrtle Beach Thursday morning, where the storm will gain speed but lose power as it heads inland and toward North Carolina's Piedmont region. It is expected to cross into the Tar Heel State just after lunch on Thursday.\n\nA tropical storm warning remained in effect for the Wilmington area up to Surf City, and the Cape Fear region remained under a high risk of flash flooding and tornadoes. With stronger bands and more turbulent weather expected to hit tomorrow, officials warned coastal residents not to drop their guard.\n\nDebby is expected to exit Southeastern N.C. on Friday, but emergency officials said flooding could remain a concern through the weekend as all of the precipitation that the storm has dumped in inland areas makes its way toward the ocean.\n\n-- Gareth McGrath\n\nAs Debby approaches North Carolina, the weak tropical storm's impacts are already being felt north of Wilmington in Pender County.\n\nAccording to a Facebook post by Pender County Emergency Management, the county has opened two shelters for residents seeking higher ground or feeling vulnerable to flooding associated with Debby − although no voluntary or mandatory evacuation orders have yet been issued.\n\nThe shelters are at Topsail Elementary School in Hampstead and Cape Fear Elementary in Rocky Point. As of early Wednesday evening, neither shelter was hosting any evacuees.\n\nThe move to open shelters comes as Pender County prepares to deal with up to another 8 inches of rain through Thursday on top of the 4-5 inches in some places that has already fallen.\n\nThe heavy precipitation has already prompted several flash-flood warnings, and emergency officials warned that both the Northeast Cape Fear and Black rivers are forecast to crest above flood stage − with the Black River in Pender County reaching major flood stage and rising through Friday.\n\nOfficials also said that there were two possible tornadoes in Pender County Wednesday afternoon, but that there were no injuries or reports of property damage.\n\n-- Gareth McGrath\n\nBrunswick County has suspended public shelter operations at Town Creek Middle School in Winnabow effective 5:30 p.m. on Wednesday.\n\nBrunswick County Emergency Management continues to monitor Tropical Storm Debby and will assess if additional shelter needs are necessary in the future, according to a news release from the county.\n\nFor questions about shelters, contact Emergency Management at 910-253-5383 or email emergency.management@brunswickcountync.gov.\n\nBrunswick County is not aware of any mandatory evacuations at this time. Brunswick County Chairman Randy Thompson declared a state of emergency as of Tuesday at 8:30 a.m., which includes a voluntary evacuation of low-lying and flood-prone areas of the unincorporated area of Brunswick County.\n\n-- Owen Hassell\n\nAs intermittent heavy rain bands continued to lash the Cape Fear region late Wednesday afternoon, Tropical Storm Debby continued its slow trek toward the Tar Heel State.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center's 5 p.m. advisory found the storm still lingering in the Atlantic just off the South Carolina coast, 50 miles east-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, and about 85 miles south of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Debby had sustained winds of 60 mph and was moving north-northeast at a glacial 3 mph.\n\nA tropical storm warning for the Wilmington area as far north as Surf City remains in effect.\n\nAccording to the hurricane center, Debby is expected to make landfall along the South Carolina coast, likely south of Myrtle Beach, Thursday morning. It will then pick up speed and likely cross into North Carolina around lunchtime Thursday west of Interstate 95.\n\nBut officials caution that even as the bulk of the storm moves more west than first forecast, Debby's impacts − especially potential tornadoes and flash-flooding events − will still be felt in the Wilmington area until the weekend, with flooding concerns likely extending in some areas to early next week.\n\nAlthough the storm surge watch for the N.C. coast has been lifted, coastal areas up to the southern Outer Banks also could see an additional 1 to 3 feet of tide.\n\n-- Gareth McGrath\n\nFor much of the day, the area experienced a reprieve from Tropical Storm Debby’s heavy rains with the sun peeking through a few times.\n\nBut that ended around 2 p.m. as some of the storm’s rain bands swirled through the Wilmington area, bringing winds, pouring rain, dark clouds, and one tornado in Pender County.\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service office in Wilmington, much of the area has received between 2 and 4 inches of rain, with some areas of Brunswick County getting just over 5 inches.\n\nIn addition, a tornado watch has been issued for Brunswick, New Hanover and Pender counties from 4-11 p.m.\n\nWhile roads that were flooding yesterday afternoon had improved by Wednesday morning, many areas still have standing water, and the Brunswick County Sheriff’s Office took to Facebook urging drivers to use caution.\n\n\"Please slow down and avoid distractions while traveling the roadways,\" the post stated. \"Hitting a puddle of water at a high rate of speed can cause a loss of control of the vehicle.\"\n\nThe Weather Service warns there could be periods of moderate to heavy rain over the next couple of days. Along with the tornado watch, the area remains under a tropical storm warning and a flood watch.\n\n-- Renee Spencer\n\nEven with the on-and-off raining from Tropical Storm Debby’s rain bands, people still made their way out to downtown Wilmington on Wednesday, some wearing colorful ponchos for an extra layer of protection against the rain.\n\nBusinesses were still open with visitors coming in and out and taking cover under awnings during short spurts of rain. Some walked their dogs on the Riverwalk.\n\nThe Cape Fear River was flowing steadily and had normal water elevation transitioning into low tide. According to the North Carolina Fiman database, which reports data from river gauges across the state, the water elevation is 2.1 feet as of 1:54 p.m.\n\nThe river’s peak elevation is expected to be at 1 a.m. Thursday morning at 3.2 feet, which is considered minor flooding. Black River in Pender County is flowing at about eight feet and is projected to reach nearly 25 feet at its peak late Friday, which is considered major flooding.\n\n-- Madison Lipe\n\nTropical Storm Debby is still slowly making its way up the South Carolina coast and toward North Carolina, according to the latest advisory by the National Hurricane Center.\n\nBut the hurricane center has discontinued the storm surge watch for the Brunswick County beaches.\n\nStill, officials are warning of heavy rains over the next few days, and the tropical storm warning for the Wilmington area remains in effect. That mean winds of at least 39 mph are likely in parts of the Cape Fear region within 48 hours.\n\nAs of 2 p.m. Debby was located about 55 miles east-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph and was moving northeast at 3 mph.\n\nThe hurricane center said Debby is expected to produce an additional 3 to 9 inches of rainfall with locally higher amounts, leading to maximum storm total amounts as high as 25 inches in South Carolina and 15 inches in Southeastern N.C.\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service's Wilmington office, most of the Cape Fear region has already seen between 2 and nearly 5 inches of rain this week, with the heaviest amounts in coastal Brunswick County.\n\n-- Gareth McGrath\n\nWhile Tropical Storm Debby continues to meander in the Atlantic Ocean off South Carolina and very slowly make its way north, Gov. Roy Cooper made clear that North Carolina is fully ready for whatever the storm brings to the Tar Heel State.\n\nAt a press conference Wednesday morning, the governor said the state had fully activated its emergency operations center and was focusing on being prepared for any potentially severe flooding impacts across much of Eastern and Central North Carolina from the slow-moving storm.\n\nSteps included activating 17 swift-water rescue teams and pre-positioning many of them in counties across the state's coastal plain; deploying more than 350 members of the N.C. National Guard, many with high-clearance vehicles to traverse flooded areas; and assigning more than 2,200 NCDOT workers to the storm to help with preparations like clearing debris off storm grates and clearing out drainage ditches.\n\n\"While we hope for the best, we are prepared for the worst,\" Cooper said.\n\nThe governor said residents should stay alert and informed, highlighting several times the state's relatively new Flood Inundation Mapping & Alert Network website, which includes information on more than 300 river gauges across the state, as a great tool to monitor.\n\nHe also said the next few days weren't the time to see if you could drive along a flooded road or ignore road-closure barriers.\n\n\"Now is not the time to see if your car floats, because it doesn't,\" Cooper said.\n\n-- Gareth McGrath\n\nTropical Storm Debby is a little bit stronger, according to the National Hurricane Center’s latest advisory.\n\nAt 11 a.m. Tropical Storm Debby was located 55 miles southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, and about 100 miles south of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.\n\nMaximum sustained winds were at 60 mph — a 15 mph increase since the 8 a.m. advisory.\n\n“Some additional strengthening is possible today or tonight before the center of Debby reaches the coast of South Carolina,” the hurricane center said.\n\nThe storm is moving northeast at 5 mph, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles from the center. The storm is expected to track north later today, bringing the center to the South Carolina coast by tonight or early Thursday before picking up speed and moving toward the north and northeast across the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic Region.\n\n-- Renee Spencer\n\nPresident Joe Biden has approved federal disaster assistance for North Carolina due to emergency conditions resulting from Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nIn a news release, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) announced Wednesday that President Biden’s action authorizes FEMA to coordinate all disaster relief efforts to alleviate the hardship and suffering caused by the emergency on the local population and to provide appropriate assistance to save lives, to protect property, public health and safety and to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe. Specifically, FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize and provide, at its discretion, equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the impacts of the emergency.\n\nBrunswick, New Hanover and Pender counties are included where emergency protective measures, limited to direct federal assistance and reimbursement for mass care including evacuation and shelter support, will be provided at 75% federal funding.\n\n-- Owen Hassell\n\nThe skies over Southport are gray, but there has been a temporary reprieve from Tropical Storm Debby’s rain bands.\n\nConditions are breezy, and for now, things are mostly quiet. Restaurants in Southport’s Yacht Basin remain closed due to the weather, and some businesses in downtown Southport have also closed for the storm.\n\nThe town of Oak Island will continue flying its double red beach warning flags today, which means all swimming and in-ocean activities are restricted until further notice. The town’s recreation, nature, ocean education, and community center will all be closed today and tomorrow. The Oak Island Pier and 801 Ocean are also closed Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nThe city of Southport opened its Emergency Operations Center at 8 a.m. The Board of Aldermen meeting for Thursday at 6 p.m. will be rescheduled for a date and time to be determined soon, according to the city's website.\n\nThe Holden Beach Town Hall will be closed today and tomorrow.\n\nBrunswick County has canceled all parks and recreation activities through Sunday, Aug. 11.\n\n-- Renee Spencer\n\nOn Wednesday, residents in the Wilmington area woke up under a tropical storm warning as Tropical Storm Debby continued to crawl up the coast.\n\nAccording to the National Hurricane Center’s 8 a.m. update, Tropical Storm Debby was located 50 miles southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, and about 90 miles east of Savannah, Georgia, with maximum sustained winds at 45 mph.\n\nIn addition to the tropical storm warning, the Brunswick County coast remains under a storm surge watch, meaning there is a possibility of “life-threatening inundation” from rising water moving inland from the coastline over the next 48 hours.\n\nThe storm is currently moving to the northeast at 4 mph. “A turn toward the north and north-northwest is expected today, bringing the center of Debby to the South Carolina coast by tonight or early Thursday,” the National Hurricane Center said in its 8 a.m. advisory. The storm is then expected to pick up speed and move toward the north and northeast across the Carolinas and into the Mid-Atlantic region on Thursday and Friday.\n\nMaximum sustained winds remain at 45 mph. Some strengthening is possible today or tonight as the center of Debby moves over the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n-- Renee Spencer\n\nBy Tuesday night, some areas of the Cape Fear region had already seen more than 4 inches of rain from Tropical Storm Debby. And road flooding was being reported in several areas of Brunswick County due to heavy rains associated with Debby.\n\nThe Brunswick County Sheriff’s Office reported pooling water along U.S. 74/76 at the westbound on ramp from U.S. 17 and flooding along Bellamy Road in Longwood, Mill Branch Road and Danford Road. The Boiling Spring Lakes Police Department warned residents about flooding along Fairway Drive on the N.C. 87 side, areas of Masters Drive and Windemere Drive. Portions of Caswell Beach Road in Caswell Beach were also beginning to flood.\n\nAs of 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, the highest rainfall total in the region was 4.24 inches in Calabash, according to the National Weather Service in Wilmington. Most other areas in Brunswick and New Hanover counties had seen 1-3 inches of rain. With heavy downpours overnight and into Wednesday, totals will increase with the weather service predicting 10-15 inches across the region in the coming days.\n\n-- Sherry Jones, Renee Spencer\n\nMore: Flooding hotspots to watch for in the Wilmington area with historic rainfall predicted\n\nAs of 5 a.m. Wednesday, Tropical Storm Debby was located about 45 south-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina. The storm was moving toward the east around 5 mph. A slower motion toward the north and north-northwest is expected Wednesday.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center reported that Debby is expected to make landfall along the South Carolina coast Wednesday night or early Thursday morning. Maximum sustained winds were near 45 mph with higher gusts.\n\nSome strengthening is possible before the center of Debby reaches South Carolina coast. But weakening isforecast to begin on Thursday after the center moves inland. Debby is expected to merge with a frontal boundary over the U.S. Mid-Atlantic on Friday.\n\nTropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles from the center.\n\n-- Sherry Jones\n\nShelter opening in Brunswick County | 4 a.m. Wednesday\n\nBrunswick County is opening a public shelter at 9 a.m. Wednesday at Town Creek Middle School, 6370 Lake Park Drive SE, Winnabow.\n\nYou are encouraged to bring enough clothing, medication, toiletries, pet food, and other essential items for three or more days. The only pets allowed will be domestic dogs and cats.\n\nMore details on what to expect at a public shelter and recommended items to bring can be found at brunswickcountync.gov/shelters.\n\n-- Sherry Jones"
