        "text": "Welcome to the Daily Weather Update from FOX Weather. It’s Monday, Nov. 27, 2023. Start your day with everything you need to know about today's weather. You can also get a quick briefing of national, regional and local weather whenever you like with the FOX Weather Update podcast.\n\nMultiday lake-effect snowstorm kicks off Monday in eastern Great Lakes\n\nLake-Effect Snow Warnings have been issued along the eastern shores of lakes Erie and Ontario in northeastern Ohio, New York state and northwestern Pennsylvania as the region braces for the first significant multiday lake-effect snowstorm of the season that will kick into high gear starting Monday. Areas south of Buffalo and north of Syracuse in New York could receive more than a foot of snow through Wednesday. Farther west, between 6 and 12 inches is expected near and northeast of Cleveland.\n\nThe winter weather comes on the heels of a powerful storm that brought several inches of snow from the Plains to the Midwest and slowed travel over the Thanksgiving weekend, leaving at least three people dead in Nebraska.\n\nKona Low to bring flooding rain to Hawai\n\nA storm system called a Kona Low is forecast to develop near Hawaii this week, fueling a threat of flooding rain and thunderstorms over the islands. Heavy rain is expected to begin Tuesday on Kauai and Oahu before spreading across the rest of the island chain from late Tuesday through the end of the week.\n\nWhen a Kona Low forms near or west of the Hawaiian Islands, the counterclockwise flow around it results in southwesterly winds over much of the state. That brings moisture-rich air over the so-called kona side – the leeward or dry side – of the islands rather than the typical fair-weather trade winds that blow from the northeast.\n\nDeath toll rises in massive Alaska landslide\n\nThe death toll from a landslide that buried homes and a highway outside of Wrangell, Alaska, last week has risen to four after officials said crews recovered the body of an 11-year-old girl from the debris on Saturday. Officials said that a scent detection team remains on standby and will resume searching for the two missing victims if new information or evidence leads to a specific search area.\n\nWatch this\n\nRescue crews faced extreme weather in Eastern Europe over the weekend as a winter storm brought blizzard conditions, reducing visibility to near zero across parts of Romania and Ukraine. Video and photos from Romanian emergency officials (IGSU) show firefighters working to clear trees from completely snow-covered roads in the dangerous winter weather.\n\nBefore you go\n\nHere are a few other stories you might find interesting.\n\nBeaver Moon: How and when to see November's full Moon\n\nActive El Nino pattern delivers with surf as high as 50 feet in Hawaii\n\nSailors missing after gale-force winds sink freighter off Greek island\n\nNeed more weather?
