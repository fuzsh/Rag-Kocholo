Today's post focuses on Skywarn... the NWS-trained storm spotter network.\n\nSevere weather can strike during any month of the year at any time of the day or night. When severe thunderstorms threaten... the National Weather Service calls Skywarn volunteers into action. Skywarn volunteers are the eyes and ears of the National Weather Service... providing instant reports of severe weather including hail... high winds... and dangerous cloud formations.\n\nSkywarn spotters keep a close eye on the sky anytime severe thunderstorms approach. Many communities deploy spotters around the edge of the city and use their early reports of impending hazardous weather to warn the community. Some spotters relay reports from their home or business while other more adventurous volunteers brave the elements and try to get as close to the storm as possible.\n\nWho are these Skywarn volunteers? A large number of sky warn storm spotters in the Mid-South are amateur radio operators... or hams. These public-service minded individuals make ideal storm spotters... since they have the ability to communicate their reports. They are willing to be trained and they have a real interest in helping the National Weather Service and their local communities prepare for severe weather. Amateur radio operators are on call 24 hours a day... 365 days a year... even though they receive no compensation of any kind for their hard work.\n\nMany other groups participate in the Skywarn program... including law enforcement agencies... fire departments... utility companies... rescue squads... and the news media. In some areas... individual citizens are trained as spotters and are asked to relay their reports to the National Weather Service. Spotters are a vital link in the warning process and it is important to have as many trained spotters in each county as possible.\n\nThe National Weather Service can help your community set up a Skywarn spotter network. For more information on Skywarn and how you can help... contact the National Weather Service office in Memphis Tennessee.\n\nMemphisWeather.net provides the latest severe weather information, including flood and flash flood warnings, for the Memphis metropolitan area. This includes all watches and warnings, an interactive severe weather map of the Mid-South, and free delivery of severe weather alerts for the metro area via e-mail and Twitter. Find these services under the \"Severe Weather\" menu on MemphisWeather.net.\n\nWe hope you have enjoyed reading this week's series of posts for Severe Weather Awareness Week.\n\nMost of this post's content courtesy of the National Weather Service.\n\nSevere Weather Awareness Week 2010 - NOAA Weather Radio and EAS\n\nThis is post #6 in a series published for Severe Weather Awareness Week 2010. Today's post focuses on NOAA Weather Radio and the Emergency Alert System.\n\n...NOAA Weather Radio and the Emergency Alert System...\n\nWeather radio is the voice of the National Weather Service. It provides continuous weather information 24 hours a day every day of the year. The nationwide network of weather radio stations provides the public with the fastest most reliable source of\n\nup-to-date weather information directly from the National Weather Service.\n\nYou need a special radio to receive weather radio broadcasts... a radio that is capable of receiving signals in the very high frequency public service band. In Memphis, the National Weather Service broadcasts on a frequency of 162.475 MHz.\n\nBroadcasts may vary but generally include area forecasts... present weather conditions... short-term forecasts... climatic data... river and lake stage forecasts... and other specialized information. The broadcasts are updated continuously.\n\nWeather radio is useful anytime... but it is most important when severe weather threatens. During periods of severe weather routine programming is interrupted and the focus shifted to the local severe weather threat. In an emergency... a warning alarm tone is broadcast that activates specially designed receivers to turn on automatically... or to produce a visual or audible alarm.\n\nA primary source of weather information is the emergency alert system. EAS is a system of communications links that utilize data in a digital form. It is a reliable means of linking the National Weather Service... emergency management agencies... and the radio and television broadcast media together. EAS helps participating radio and television stations receive and relay weather warnings and other emergency information in a timely manner.\n\nFor more information on weather radio... contact the National Weather Service office in Memphis Tennessee.\n\nDid you know that you can get a FREE Midland WR-100 NOAA Weather Radio like the one pictured above? MemphisWeather.net is running two advertising specials this month that will net you a free radio, already programmed to alert for your county! Rates are very competitive and our audience is regional.

Today's post focuses on the dangers of flooding and flash flooding.\n\n...Flood and Flash Flood Awareness day...\n\nSevere weather awareness week continues today with a look at flood and flash flood safety. Flooding and flash flooding are... perhaps surprisingly to some... the #1 weather-related cause of death in the United States.\n\nFloods and flash floods occur every year in the Mid-South. River flooding occurs seasonally when winter or spring rains or torrential rains associated with tropical storms fill river basins with too much water too quickly. Flash floods occur suddenly... usually occurring within hours of excessive localized rainfall. These flash floods can become raging torrents which rip through river beds... urban streets... or valleys... sweeping everything before them.\n\nWhen a Flash Flood Warning is issued for your County... or the moment you first realize that a flash flood is imminent... act quickly to save yourself. You may only have seconds.\n\nA Flood Watch means it is possible that heavy rains will cause flooding in the specified area. Stay alert to the weather and think about what you would do if water begins to rise or if you receive a warning. Watch for development.\n\nHere are some flash flood safety rules:\n\nGet out of areas subject to flooding. This includes dips... low spots... valleys... stream banks... and flood plains.\n\nAvoid already flooded and high velocity flow areas. Do not attempt to cross a flowing stream on foot where water is above your ankles. Do not allow children to play in or near ditches... gulleys... or culverts following a heavy rain event. Though children are adventurous and may find the fast-flowing water intriguing... lives can be lost if they lose their footing or attempt to cross the flowing water.\n\nIf driving... know the depth of water in a dip before crossing. The road bed may not be intact under the water. Don't drive into a pool of water or where water is flowing. Water up to the bumper will likely stall a car and can pick it up and move it.\n\nIf the vehicle stalls... abandon it immediately and seek higher ground. Rapidly rising water may engulf the vehicle and its occupants and sweep them away. Turn Around - Don't Drown.\n\nBe especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize flood dangers. Heavy rain events frequently occur at night!\n\nDo not camp or park your vehicle along streams or drainage areas particularly during threatening conditions.\n\nMemphisWeather.net provides the latest severe weather information, including flood and flash flood warnings, for the Memphis metropolitan area.

Today's post focuses on tornadoes.\n\n...Tornado Awareness Day...\n\nIn 2009, 39 Tennessee counties were affected by tornadoes, with two fatalities and 62 injuries reported. Total damage estimates for the year exceeded $100 million. Most residents of the Mid-South will remember the July 30th storms that dropped two tornadoes in the metro area, including an EF-1 that struck Cordova near Wolfchase Galleria and an EF-2 that hit parts of Olive Branch.\n\nYour safety depends on being constantly alert to the possibility of tornadoes from the thunderstorms that approach you. This is especially true during tornado watches. A careful lookout should be kept during any period of severe weather activity. Plan in advance where you will go and what you will do if a tornado threatens you.\n\nRemember...a Tornado Watch means that tornado development is possible... so watch the sky for developing thunderstorms and all the hazards they bring. Stay tuned to weather radio... commercial radio or television for weather statements or warnings.\n\nA Tornado Warning...usually issued for 1 or 2 counties at a time... means that a tornado has been sighted or indicated by weather radar. Persons in the path of the storm need to immediately find shelter... preferably in a sturdy building (below ground if possible).\n\nHere are some tornado safety rules:\n\nIn homes or small buildings... go to the basement or storm shelter or to an interior room such as a closet or bathroom on the lowest level. Get under something sturdy... such as a heavy table or a bed.\n\nIn mobile homes and vehicles... abandon them and go to a storm shelter or sturdy structure. If there is no such structure nearby... lie flat in a ditch ravine... gully... culvert... or a low spot with your arms and hands shielding your head.\n\nIn large buildings such as schools... factories... hospitals... nursing homes... and shopping centers... go to the predesignated shelter area. Interior hallways on the lowest floor are usually best. Stay away from rooms that are large in area because they have weakly supported roofs.\n\nIn all cases... stay away from windows.\n\nThis morning... between 9am and 9:30am... a regional Tornado Drill will be conducted. NOAA Weather Radio tones will sound and the Emergency Alert System will be activated. Many schools... businesses... and other venues with tornado preparedness plans will exercise those plans. Now is a good time to review your personal preparedness plan. Where will you go and what will you do should a tornado threaten you while at work... school... or home?\n\nMemphisWeather.net provides the latest severe weather information for the Memphis metropolitan area.

Today's post focuses on the hazards of lightning.\n\n...Lightning Awareness Day...\n\nSevere weather awareness week continues today with a look at lightning safety. Here are some lightning safety rules.\n\nAny lightning safety plan should incorporate the 30/30 rule. The 30/30 rule states people should seek shelter if the flash to bang delay (length of time in seconds between a lightning flash and its subsequent thunder) is 30 seconds or less and that they remain under cover until 30 minutes after the final clap of thunder.\n\nMove inside a well constructed house... a large building... or an all metal vehicle. Stay away from electrical appliances and do not use the telephone.\n\nIf you are in a boat... get off the water and into a substantial building... or at least into an enclosed and all-metal vehicle with the windows up. If you're caught in an open metal boat... lie down in the boat with cushions between you and the metal sides and bottom.\n\nIf you are caught outdoors... get down to avoid being the highest point for a lightning discharge. If you're caught in a flat open field or if you feel your hair standing on end... crouch down and cover your head with your hands. That way only your feet will touch the ground.\n\nMove away from motorcycles... scooters... golf carts... bicycles... tractors... and other metal farm equipment. Avoid wire fences... clothes lines... metal pipes... drains... railroad tracks... and other metallic objects.\n\nAvoid lone trees and the tallest trees. If caught in the woods... pick a small grove of trees as your shelter and stand at least 5 feet from the trunk of the nearest tree to avoid flying bark if the tree is struck.\n\nAvoid standing in a small isolated shed or other small ungrounded structure in other areas.\n\nIf in a group of people in an open area... spread out before you kneel down.\n\nOn Wednesday... we will conduct a tornado drill between 9 and 10 A.M. in Tennessee... Arkansas... and Mississippi.\n\nMemphisWeather.net provides the latest severe weather information for the Memphis metropolitan area.

Today's post focuses on severe thunderstorms.\n\n...Severe Thunderstorm Awareness Day...\n\nThere are approximately two thousand thunderstorms in progress around the world at any given time. Most of these storms are beneficial and bring needed rain. Only a small fraction... less than one percent... are classified as severe. Severe thunderstorms are those thunderstorms that produce hail one inch in diameter or larger and or strong wind gusts of 58 mph or greater. Hail that is one inch in diameter is about the size of a quarter.\n\nA small fraction of these thunderstorms produce tornadoes. All thunderstorms are capable of producing deadly lightning. The heavy rains or the lightning activity in a thunderstorm do not have anything to do with a thunderstorm being classified as severe.\n\nSome of the severe thunderstorms safety rules are as follows.\n\nFind shelter immediately. Go to a sturdy building that will withstand high winds. Avoid electrical appliances and telephones.\n\nIt would be a good idea to bring your car inside a garage and to secure loose objects.\n\nRemember...a Severe Thunderstorm Warning means that a severe thunderstorm is occurring. The severe thunderstorm has been detected by the Doppler radar or reported to the National Weather Service by our Skywarn spotter network or the local law enforcement agency in a particular county.\n\nA Severe Thunderstorm Watch means that conditions are right for severe thunderstorms to develop... but none has been observed. Folks should keep an eye on the sky and listen to commercial broadcasts... weather radio... or check MemphisWeather.net for any subsequent warnings.\n\nWhen a Severe Thunderstorm Warning is issued for your location treat it the same as you would a Tornado Warning. Severe thunderstorms can produce damaging winds large hail and deadly lightning.\n\nMemphisWeather.net provides the latest severe weather information for the Memphis metropolitan area.

My 500th blog post, sent earlier today and one week shy of the two year anniversary of the start of this blog, discussed the fact that this is severe weather awareness week in the Mid-South. I encourage you to read it, as well as the series of posts coming this week on various topics related to severe weather. Now is the time to make sure you are prepared for any severe weather we may get this season, which runs from mid-March through early May in this region of the country.\n\nAs I type this, showers and embedded thunderstorms are rumbling through the region. I stepped outside a bit ago and smelled the distinctive aroma of a spring rain shower as I listened to thunder rumble in the distance. After a seemingly long winter, these are welcome signs that spring is not too far away!\n\nUnfortunately, we will have to deal with a little more winter cold this week in the wake of this evening's cold front, and another that will come through Tuesday night. While today's front brings in an airmass of Pacific origin and not a lot of cold air (but noticeable still the same), Tuesday's front marks the leading edge of an Arctic airmass that will thankfully just provide the Mid-South with a glancing blow, while the brunt of the cold air remains over the Ohio Valley. The MWN forecast shows as much, with highs dropping back nearly 20 degrees from today's mid 60s readings for Monday and even cooler air expected for mid-week. Lows will be back below freezing by Wednesday morning. Fortunately, there doesn't appear to be any precipitation in the forecast after tonight for the rest of the week, though subtle upper-level systems will bear watching. Sunshine should re-appear in force by Wednesday.\n\n----\n\nGet the latest weather conditions and much more by checking out MemphisWeather.net on Facebook and Twitter!\n\nSevere Weather Awareness Week 2010\n\nThis is post #1 in a series published for Severe Weather Awareness Week 2010. Today's post provides an overview of the week's activities.\n\n...SEVERE WEATHER AWARENESS WEEK IN THE MID-SOUTH...\n\nTHE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE IN COOPERATION WITH EMERGENCY\n\nMANAGEMENT AND THE MEDIA ARE PARTICIPATING IN SEVERE WEATHER\n\nAWARENESS WEEK ACROSS TENNESSEE...ARKANSAS...AND MISSISSIPPI FROM\n\nMONDAY...FEBRUARY 22ND THROUGH FRIDAY FEBRUARY 26TH.\n\nEACH DAY DURING AWARENESS WEEK WILL FOCUS ON A DIFFERENT ASPECT OF\n\nSEVERE WEATHER. DURING THE WEEK...THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE IN\n\nMEMPHIS WILL ISSUE SAFETY MESSAGES ON THE FOLLOWING TOPICS.\n\nMONDAY...WE WILL FOCUS ON SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS.\n\nTUESDAY...THE TOPIC WILL BE LIGHTNING.\n\nWEDNESDAY IS TORNADO AWARENESS AND WILL SERVE AS TORNADO DRILL DAY.\n\nTHURSDAY...WE WILL LOOK AT FLOODING AND FLASH FLOODS.\n\nFRIDAY IS WEATHER RADIO DAY AND THE EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM DAY.\n\nSATURDAY WILL CONCLUDE SEVERE WEATHER AWARENESS WEEK WITH A\n\nDISCUSSION ABOUT THE SKYWARN STORM SPOTTER PROGRAM.\n\nTHE PURPOSE OF SEVERE WEATHER AWARENESS WEEK IS TO DRAW ATTENTION\n\nTO THE MANY ASPECTS OF SEVERE WEATHER WHICH AFFECT ALL OF US... TO\n\nFOCUS ON SAFETY... AND TO LEARN WHAT TO DO WHEN HAZARDOUS\n\nWEATHER THREATENS.\n\nWinter takes a short break; satellite indicates global warmth for January\n\nThe cold weather pattern of the past few weeks has broken for just a few days as the Mid-South saw their first 50 degree day today since January 28. A full day of sun was a welcome sight, and so was the lack of snow cover! Today was the first day without any snow on the ground at WXLIVE! in Bartlett since the February 8th storm, and only the 5th day this month.\n\nThough it was still below normal temperature-wise, that streak (which is also at 21 days) should end tomorrow as highs climb to the mid to upper 50s. It's been an unusually cold and active winter for the region (see Eddie Holmes' blog on the topic as it relates to Jackson, TN), so a few nice days in the mix is welcome. Following a low pressure system that will bring rain to the area this weekend, another round of Arctic air will spill into the tri-state region next week, which could hold tight through the early part of March (8-14 day outlook), as we end meteorogical winter.\n\nThough the U.S. has been well below normal this winter, Jeff Masters at Weather Underground reports that last month was the warmest January in the lower atmosphere since 1978, globally speaking, continuing a trend of above normal temperatures since the current El Nino began last summer. The measurements are taken from Microwave Sounding Unit aboard a polar-orbiting satellite.\n\nOne final note... I'll be speaking tomorrow to the second graders at Rivercrest Elementary School for their Career Day. I hope they enjoy my talk on being a world famous pastry chef! Ha! I always look forward to opportunities like this and am especially grateful to the staff at Rivercrest for having me tomorrow. I think my second-grade daughter is more excited than I though!\n\n----\n\nGet the latest weather conditions and much more by checking out MemphisWeather.net on Facebook and Twitter!\n\nWinter Storm Watch Sunday night for west TN and north MS\n\nURGENT - WINTER WEATHER MESSAGE\n\nNATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MEMPHIS TN\n\n330 PM CST SAT FEB 13 2010\n\n...WINTER WEATHER EXPECTED TONIGHT AND AGAIN SUNDAY NIGHT INTO\n\nMONDAY...\n\n.A FAST MOVING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL APPROACH THE MID SOUTH\n\nTONIGHT.

With two winter storm events in January and one so far in February (not counting the one that is going by to our south today), no one would argue that it has been an active pattern. El Nino has at least something to do with that, as we have had several southern stream storm systems (say that three time fast)like today's which move across the southern U.S., tapping the Gulf of Mexico as their moisture source.\n\nWhile we narrowly missed out on today's storm, we have yet another chance in the short-range forecast as a clipper system takes a nose-dive out of the Northern Plains into the Mid-South on Sunday. It will bring with it a couple of rounds of precipitation - scattered light showers ahead of the Arctic cold front, an upper-level low that will be trailing the main surface low, and then another impulse in the resulting northwest upper level flow on President's Day.\n\nAs of now, it appears we might be warm enough to start out as rain early Sunday morning ahead of the cold front, though a little snow could be mixed in to the north where surface temps may support it. The cold front then comes through during the morning and cold air begins to move in by afternoon, accompanied by the first upper-level low. That round of precipitation could change over to snow during the afternoon hours, continuing into the evening, as much colder air pours over the region. Then on Monday, in the Arctic air behind the system, mostly cloudy skies and cold air filtering into the region could be enough to produce some flurries during the day.\n\nA far as totals, it's too early to say for sure, but there is the possibility of about an inch or so from late afternoon into the evening on Sunday. I don't expect any snow that falls early in the day or on Monday to amount to anything.\n\nThis winter system will be enough to continue our streak of below normal temperatures. High temperatures at Memphis International have been below average every day since January 28, and that appears as though it will continue through the extended forecast, pushing us towards 3 straight weeks below normal. I guess maybe the groundhog was right this year? I for one am looking forward to spring!\n\n----\n\nGet the latest weather conditions and much more by checking out MemphisWeather.net on Facebook and Twitter!\n\nYet another possibility of snow on Friday\n\nSPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT\n\nNATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MEMPHIS TN\n\n630 AM CST WED FEB 10 2010\n\n...ACCUMULATING SNOW POSSIBLE ALONG AND SOUTH OF INTERSTATE 40\n\nLATE THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY MORNING...\n\nA STORM SYSTEM OFF THE SOUTHWEST CALIFORNIA COAST WILL TRACK EAST\n\nACROSS NORTHERN MEXICO AND SOUTHERN TEXAS WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY\n\nNIGHT.

Once it began falling over northeast AR and critical low-level surface temps were better analyzed, the NWS upgraded a Winter Weather Advisory to a Winter Storm Warning early this morning, which will continue until 4pm. The snow began around 3:30-4:00am in the city and has piled up quickly along the TN/MS state line since then, with most places blanketed by 1\"+ as of 6:30am. The airport area, southern Germantown, Collierville, Olive Branch, and Southaven are already at 2-4\"!\n\nAs for the rest of the day, it looks like snow will continue through mid-afternoon before transitioning to rain. Some sleet could mix in during the transition this afternoon. Snowfall rates could continue near 1\"/hr. at times, with some heavier bands producing more. Thus, the predicted totals of 4-8\"+ are well within reason. The rain late this afternoon and evening should help the traffic situations somewhat, but rain will transition back to light snow after midnight as temps drop back into the upper 20s, possibly making Tuesday morning's commute a tricky one. The toughest remaining part of this forecast is when exactly the rain changeover will take place. If it is delayed, look for snow totals to increase further.\n\nAs for the rest of the week, another storm system will move in Thursday night and Friday. Once again, the atmosphere will be cold enough to support snow, so this one will also bear watching.\n\nEnjoy your snow day kids!\n\nStay with MemphisWeather.net and the MWN Blog for the latest details on today's winter weather.\n\n----\n\nGet the latest weather conditions and much more by checking out MemphisWeather.net on Facebook and Twitter!\n\nWinter Storm Warning for Memphis metro area\n\nURGENT - WINTER WEATHER MESSAGE\n\nNATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MEMPHIS TN\n\n425 AM CST MON FEB 8 2010\n\n...WINTER STORM TO AFFECT THE MIDSOUTH TODAY AND TONIGHT\n\nWITH HEAVY SNOW ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE AREA...\n\n.HEAVY SNOW ACCUMULATIONS ARE EXPECTED TODAY INTO TONIGHT\n\nACROSS NORTHEAST ARKANSAS...THE MISSOURI BOOTHEEL...\n\nMUCH OF WEST TENNESSEE...AND EXTREME NORTHWEST MISSISSIPPI.\n\nTHE AFFECTED AREA IS GENERALLY ALONG AND NORTH OF A LINE\n\nFROM FORREST CITY ARKANSAS TO HERNANDO MISSISSIPPI TO\n\nHUNTINGDON TENNESSEE.

Given the current forecast, I'm not one to argue much with him, at least for the first week of that six week period! We've left behind a month with two winter storms and threats of others that did not materialize (see the satellite image above taken mid-day today showing the snow cover that is still remnants of last Friday's storm and notice how well it lines up with the snow map in my previous post).\n\nAs to the forecast, we'll have two systems affect the Mid-South in the next six days that are definitely winter-time storms, with the second one having the early makings of another snow event. The first comes tomorrow and Friday as mainly rain in the metro area. Low pressure will move by to our south, similar to last week's storm, only this time the colder air will be displaced farther north. Some areas of northeast AR and northwest TN that got a dumping of snow last Friday could get a little more with this system. As for the metro area, I expect rain Thursday and Thursday night, a break Friday morning, then showers possible again Friday afternoon and evening with a possible mix of light snow Friday night. No accumulations are expected. The weekend will see more clouds than sun and cool temperatures.\n\nAnother system will take a similar track through the Lower MS Valley early next week. This one also appears to have plenty of moisture and dynamics associated with it. The mid-range models are still having some difficulties with the eventual evolution, strength, and degree of cold air associated with this one, but it definitely has a shot at bringing at least part of the area our next good chance for winter precipitation. We'll continue to monitor. In the meantime, be thankful for some rain on Thursday and Friday to finish the snow melting job and wash the roads and our cars of all the sand/salt/ash from last week's storm!\n\n----\n\nGet the latest weather conditions and much more by checking out MemphisWeather.net on Facebook and Twitter!\n\nNOAA Weather Radio All Hazards\n\nNOAA Weather Radio All Hazards (NWR) is a nationwide network of radio stations broadcasting continuous weather information directly from the nearest National Weather Service office. NWR broadcasts official Weather Service warnings, watches, forecasts and other hazard information 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\nWorking with the Federal Communication Commission's (FCC) Emergency Alert System, NWR is an “All Hazards” radio network, making it your single source for comprehensive weather and emergency information. In conjunction with Federal, State, and Local Emergency Managers and other public officials, NWR also broadcasts warning and post-event information for all types of hazards including natural (such as earthquakes or avalanches), environmental (such as chemical releases or oil spills), and public safety (such as AMBER alerts or 911 Telephone outages).\n\nKnown as the “Voice of NOAA's National Weather Service,” NWR is provided as a public service by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), part of the Department of Commerce. NWR includes more than 985 transmitters , covering all 50 states, adjacent coastal waters, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the U.S. Pacific Territories. NWR requires a special radio receiver or scanner capable of picking up the signal.\n\nIn the Memphis area, NOAA Weather Radio is broadcast on WXK49 on a frequency of 162.475 Mhz. Most NWR's will automatically pick up this station or allow you to scan for it. In addition, there are \"SAME\" codes that can be programmed into most radios that allow you to set a county or counties to warn for, rather than the entire listening area. For more information on NOAA Weather Radio in the metro area, see this page from NOAA or contact MemphisWeather.net.\n\nIncidentally, MemphisWeather.net is currently running an advertising special whereby you can receive a free Midland Weather Radio when your small business or organization palces on ad on MWN!
