        "text": "5.1 Background\n\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canadaâs (ECCC) Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) is the agency responsible for delivering Canadaâs weather service. The MSC offers a broad range of products and services that are designed to help mariners make informed decisions on how weather will affect them. The Canadian Coast Guard also plays an important role in disseminating forecasts and warnings, and in collecting and relaying weather information from volunteer observers and ships.\n\nThe constant stream of data coming from both automated and manned coastal observation stations, as well as ships and weather buoys, is supplemented by satellite imagery, weather radar and a full set of numerical weather products adapted for marine operations.\n\n5.2 Marine Weather Alerting Program\n\nThe MSC is responsible for issuing marine weather alerts for coastal and offshore waters, as well as the St. Lawrence Seaway, and major inland waters such as the Great Lakes. These alerts include warnings of extreme weather events that can pose a threat to life and property at sea, such as gales or storms and freezing spray. Localized warnings and watches are also issued for phenomena such as squalls, high water levels and waterspouts. Advisories are issued as a caution to mariners for weather-related events that may not meet warning criteria but may nonetheless pose significant inconvenience or hazard to navigation.\n\nMajor inland waters are defined as having significant marine activity and where time to reach safe harbour is comparable to the marine weather alert lead time. The criteria for issuing marine weather alerts is based on national guidelines, but determined regionally to account for regional climatology and the nature of the regional marine community.\n\nThe following tables describe the various types of marine warnings, watches and advisories comprising the Marine Weather Alerting Program:\n\nTable 5-1 - Synoptic Warnings Synoptic WarningsFootnote * Warning Criteria Strong wind warning Footnote 1 Winds Footnote 2 20 to 33 knots inclusive occurring or expected to occur in any portion of a marine area including any portion defined by a local effect or an âexceptâ statement. Gale warning Winds Footnote 2 34 to 47 knots inclusive occurring or expected to occur in any portion of a marine area including any portion defined by a local effect or an âexceptâ statement. Storm warning Winds Footnote 2 48 to 63 knots inclusive occurring or expected to occur in any portion of a marine area including any portion defined by a local effect or an âexceptâ statement. Hurricane force wind warning Winds Footnote 2 64 knots or above occurring or expected to occur in any portion of a marine area including any portion defined by a local effect or an âexceptâ statement. Freezing spray warning Ice accretion rate of 0.7 cm/hr or more occurring or expected to occur in any portion of a marine area including any portion defined by a local effect or an âexceptâ statement.\n\nRange: With the exception of Note (1) above, when a range is used to describe the wind speed, the upper value of the range determines the warning category.\n\nTable 5-2 - Localized Warnings / Watches and Marine Weather Advisory Localized Warnings/Watches and Advisory Footnote * Issuing Criteria Squall watch Advance notice of conditions that are favourable to the development of squalls. Squall warning Wind gust ≥ 34 knots associated with a line or an organized area of thunderstorms. Tornado watch Advance notice of conditions that are favourable to the development of tornados. Tornado warning Evidence of tornado formation (radar, report from a reliable source, etc.) over a marine area, oran existing tornado moving from land to an adjacent marine area. Waterspout watch Footnote 1 Advance notice of conditions that are favourable to the development of cold-air waterspouts. High water level warning Footnote 2 Issued to warn mariners and coastal populations of potentially hazardous impacts due to abnormally high water levels or waves along coastal areas. Special marine warning/watch Used to describe conditions other than those defined above that may have potentially hazardous impacts on navigation. Marine weather advisory Footnote 3 Issued as necessary to caution mariners about conditions that may not meet established warning criteria but may nonetheless pose significant inconvenience or hazard to navigation.\n\nIce warnings: refer to the Canadian Ice Services, Section 5.15.\n\n5.3 Marine and Ice Forecast Program\n\nMarine forecasts are issued for the offshore economic zone including the St. Lawrence Seaway and major inland waters.\n\nFor sea ice, ice forecasts are issued for offshore marine areas as well as the Great Lakes. The production schedule is detailed in each regional section of this chapter. The forecast program includes the following bulletins:\n\nTable 5-3 - Marine Forecast Program Forecast or bulletin name Details Technical marine synopsis Provides the positions and trends of the main weather systems for the forecast period covering Days 1 and 2. Marine forecast (or Regular marine forecast) Provides information on: synoptic warnings, wind, visibility, precipitation and freezing spray. It may include air temperature as appropriate. Valid for Days 1 and 2. Recreational boating marine forecast Tailored to the needs of recreational boaters, it is available on a seasonal basis and only in specific regions. Wave height forecast Provides information on significant wave heights for Days 1 and 2 (not available for northern and Arctic lakes or inland waterways). Extended marine forecast Meant for longer-range planning purposes, it provides an extended marine wind outlook for Days 3, 4, and 5. Iceberg bulletin Provides information on distribution of icebergs valid for the time of issue of the bulletin. Ice forecasts Provides information on hazardous ice conditions for Days 1 and 2. NAVTEX Footnote 1 International Maritime Organization (IMO)-compliant NAVigational TelEX bulletin issued with each regular marine forecast or ice forecasts in a standardized abbreviated format - see section 5.7.1 for Abbreviations. MAFOR Footnote 1 This is a specialized coded marine forecast produced for QuÃ©bec and Ontario regions.\n\n5.3.1 Monitoring the Forecast\n\nForecasts are monitored, and amended as necessary, to reflect unexpected or changing weather conditions according to criteria based on the following principles:\n\nwhen safety or security is at risk;\n\nwhen inconvenience to the marine community will be extensive; or\n\nwhen the product could adversely affect the credibility of the marine forecast program.\n\n5.3.2 Marine and Ice Forecast Areas\n\nMarine forecasts and ice forecasts are issued for marine and ice areas as outlined in the regional maps. The sizes and boundaries of these areas are determined regionally based on the following considerations:\n\nmarine traffic density;\n\nthe ability to forecast to the proposed resolution;\n\nthe degree to which, climatologically, marine weather varies; and\n\nthe ability to distribute the information effectively to the marine community.\n\n5.3.3 Current Conditions\n\nCurrent weather data is available to Canadians for their local area. The frequency and quality of the data will be consistent with the standards established by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The data may include, as appropriate:\n\nwind speed and direction;\n\natmospheric pressure;\n\nsky conditions;\n\nprecipitation type;\n\nrestrictions to visibility;\n\nwave height; and\n\ncurrent temperature.\n\nGeneral information on current sea-ice will be provided to the marine community once a week to provide an adequate planning tool for those considering entering ice-encumbered waters.\n\n5.3.4 Emergency Response\n\nMeteorological support is provided during emergencies and includes the provision of meteorological information and forecasts. In the case of a pollution event, Environment and Climate Change Canada adheres to the âpolluter payâ policy for the provision of all services. Where agreements are in place, Environment and Climate Change Canada will make its distribution systems available to transmit vital information during emergency situations.\n\n5.3.5 Delivery of Marine Warning and Forecast Services\n\nDelivery of marine warning and forecast services to mariners navigating waters within Environment and Climate Change Canadaâs forecast areas of responsibility is primarily by mass communication in order to reach the greatest number of mariners through the standard communications technologies available to mariners. The following principles apply, regardless of the specific available technologies:\n\nMarine forecasts and warnings comprising the meteorological Maritime Safety Information (met MSI) issued by Environment and Climate Change Canada will be made available to the marine community via the CCG MCTS according to established procedures within the framework of the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (see RAMN Part 4 Section 4.2.1 General Procedures â Systems â GMDSS).\n\nAll forecast and warning information will be found at the Government of Canada web page. Mariners should note, however, that the internet is not part of the Maritime Safety Information system and should never be relied upon as the only means to obtain the latest marine forecasts and warning information. Access to the internet may be interrupted or updated information delayed without prior notice.\n\nMarine and Environmental Advisories, Watches and Warnings are distributed through various mechanisms including partnerships with national and regional media distributors and local emergency measures organizations.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned mediums, basic services to mariners and Canadians in general shall also be delivered by mass distribution in partnership with media, relying on current and developing technologies in radio, television, newspaper and the Internet. These distribution mechanisms represent the primary methods by which most Canadians receive their weather information, now and in the future.\n\n5.4 Voluntary Observing Ship (VOS) Program\n\nThe VOS program has been discontinued within Canada. Environment and Climate Change Canada currently supports the Automated Voluntary Observing Ship program (AVOS) program and will support visiting VOS ships from other jurisdictions on a âbest effortsâ basis. Contact your regional PMO for further information.\n\n5.5 Buoys Program\n\nIn order to complement the observational network, Environment and Climate Change Canada operates a network of buoys across the country. This data becomes part of the collection of weather reports sent to the distribution network and is used to improve marine forecasting. The location, WMO identifiers and names of the Environment and Climate Change Canada buoys are given in the regional annexes.\n\nMariners are requested to use caution when approaching buoys as mooring chains are normally not detectable from a ship and can be damaged or even severed if there is contact. Such a mishap could possibly result in the buoy going adrift thus requiring a costly effort to recover the platform. Please keep the regional PMO informed of any incidents involving buoys.\n\nBuoy locations: Buoy positions are described in each specific regional annex.\n\n5.6 Port Meteorological Officers (PMOs)\n\nIn addition to a variety of other duties, PMOs also act as a liaison between Environment and Climate Change Canada and ships involved in the VOS and AVOS programs. This is to encourage vessels to report weather and ice conditions, to instruct observers about procedures and the use of code; to supply observing forms, handbooks (free of charge); to calibrate equipment; and, in some cases, to install, on loan, meteorological or oceanographic instrumentation. The PMO is also responsible for recruiting new vessels to participate in the AVOS program.\n\nIf a PMO visits your ship, feel free to ask questions about observing and coding, and reporting weather and ice conditions. Inform the PMO of any concerns you may have with forecasts, warnings, or facsimile products, especially if you have specific problems. The PMO will contact the appropriate party for investigation. Keep the PMO informed of your contact information.\n\n5.6.1 Port Meteorological Officers (PMOs)\n\n5.7 NAVTEX\n\nMSC will provide Canadian Coast Guard with marine forecast information in NAVTEX format for coastal and offshore areas of responsibility based on IMO standards. Marine forecast information provided will include:\n\nwarnings (winds and ice accretion);\n\nsynopsis (major features); and\n\nforecasts (wind, visibility, ice accretion, wave height).\n\nEach bulletin will contain a WMO telecommunication header, a valid period, notes on parameters used within the bulletin, a synopsis section, a weather forecast section and a wave forecast section. Below is a sample of a partial NAVTEX produced for CCG MCTS Sydney. Note that NAVTEX will make use of abbreviations: this is necessary in order to comply with the physical limitations of the NAVTEX system. In the example, text in superscript indicates how abbreviations are used. Section 5.7.1 provides a detailed list used by NAVTEX.\n\nNAVTEX service sample (518 kHz) - NAVTEX service sample (518 kHz) Header FQCN34 CWHX 171400 Title(part one) NAVTEX/1 FOR SYDNEY VCO AT 10:00 AM AST FRI Friday 17 NOV November 2006.

Wave height forecasts are provided for salt water areas. The PASPC-Edmonton forecast area encompasses Lake Athabasca, Great Slave Lake, the Mackenzie River, as well as the waterways of the Western and High Arctic, and Baffin Bay.\n\nThe PASPC-Winnipeg provides marine forecasts for Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Foxe Basin, Ungava Bay, and Davis Strait. Marine forecasts are also provided for Lake Winnipeg (north and south basins), Lake Manitoba and Lake Winnipegosis during the open water season in support of pleasure and commercial activities.\n\nThe forecast program for the Manitoba Lakes continues through the winter months as a public rather than a marine forecast in aid of commercial ice fishing. Minimum and maximum temperatures along with wind chill are included in the forecast.\n\nTable 5-23 â Northern Canada: Production Schedule - Text Format Forecast Name Issue Time Time Zone Marine Region Technical marine synopsis 06:30, 18:30 MDT/MST Western Arctic 06:30, 18:30 MDT/MST Central Arctic 04:45, 16:45 EDT/EST Hudson Bay and Eastern Arctic Marine forecast 03:00, 11:30, 16:30 CDT/CST Manitoba 05:00, 17:00 MDT/MST Inland waters (Lake Athabasca, Great Slave Lake, the Mackenzie River) 07:00, 19:00 MDT/MST Western Arctic Waterway 05:30, 17:30 EDT/EST Arctic 05:00, 17:00 CDT/CST Hudson Bay 05:30, 17:30 EDT/EST Southern Nunavut 05:00, 17:00 EDT/EST Eastern Nunavut Extended forecast 05:00, 17:00 MDT/MST Inland waters 07:00, 19:00 MDT/MST Western Arctic Waterway 05:30, 17:30 EDT/EST Arctic 05:00, 17:00 CDT/CST Hudson Bay 05:30, 17:30 EDT/EST Southern Nunavut 05:00, 17:00 EDT/EST Eastern Nunavut Wave height forecast 07:00, 19:00 MDT/MST Western Arctic Waterway 05:30, 17:30 EDT/EST Arctic 05:00, 17:00 CDT/CST Hudson Bay 05:30, 17:30 EDT/EST Southern Nunavut 05:00, 17:00 EDT/EST Eastern Nunavut Marine weather statement As needed MDT/MST\n\nEDT/EST Where needed\n\nTable 5-24 â Northern Canada: Production Schedule - NAVTEX Format MCTS Centre NAVTEX Transmitter Header Issue Time Iqaluit/ VFF Iqaluit\n\nFQCN36 CWNT\n\nFICN36 CWIS\n\n05:30, 17:30 EDT/EST\n\n7:00, 19:00 UTC\n\nNote the following particulars:\n\nMarine Weather Warnings - Warning Types Comments 1 Strong wind warning Applies to Manitoba Lakes, Lake Athabasca, Great Slave Lake and Mackenzie River\n\n5.9.2 Weather and Ice Messages\n\nShip weather and ice reports in the international meteorological code, taken at the standard synoptic hours of 00:00, 06:00, 12:00 and 18:00 UTC are solicited from ships of all nationalities which have been recruited by their national weather service, or other weather services. These reports should be transmitted directly to the circuit using Inmarsat. Alternatively, the observation should be passed to the nearest CCG MCTS Centre, irrespective of the shipâs position. Reports made close to, or even within sight of land, are as important as reports made offshore, due to the greater variability of weather conditions in proximity to a coastline. Such reports contribute to the overall knowledge of Arctic weather from both a real-time operational perspective and from a climate perspective.\n\nThe PASPC welcomes weather, sea, and ice observations from the lakes. Real-time observations, and those up to a few hours after the event, are most valuable. Relay observations to 1 800 66STORM (1-800-667-8676).\n\n5.9.3 Weatheradio Canada\n\nWeatheradio is a public service designed to make weather information available over VHF or FM radio continuously. Weatheradio is dedicated to transmitting up to the minute weather reports and forecasts directly to all users including the marine community.\n\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada Weatheradio operates several stations serving Northern region.

Forecast service to Greenlandic waters within METAREA XVIII is provided by the Danish Meteorological Institute. Further information may be obtained by contacting these agencies directly.\n\nDetailed information regarding the geographic locations and boundaries associated with the METAREAs forecast zones may be obtained by contacting the Meteorological Service of Canada at the following:\n\nTelephone: 587-334-2892\n\nEmail: metarea17.18@ec.gc.ca\n\nAdditional information may be obtained by consulting the Joint Commission on Oceanography and Marine Meteorology (JCOMM) web site or by consulting the CCG Notices to Mariners (NOTMAR) web site.\n\n5.9.7 METAREAs Forecast Transmission\n\nDuring the navigation season, met MSI issued for METAREAs XVII and XVIII and northwestern sections of METAREA IV is broadcast via both Iridium SafetyCast and Inmarsat SafetyNET, noting the following:\n\nSafetyCast met MSI is broadcast directly into the GMDSS METAREA zones; and\n\nSafetyNET met MSI for sections of METAREA XVII and XVIII south of 75Â°N, and northwestern sections of METAREA IV, is broadcast over Inmarsatâs Asia-Pacific (APAC), Americas (AMER) or Atlantic Ocean Region-West (AOR-W) satellite network.\n\nScheduled broadcast times are:\n\nBroadcast Hour (UTC) Met MSI Transmission Area Transmitting Satellite 03:00 and 15:00 daily METAREA XVII Inmarsat (APAC & AMER) Iridium 03:00 and 15:00 daily METAREA XVIII Inmarsat (AMER & AOR-W) Iridium 03:00 and 15:00 daily Northwestern METAREA IV Inmarsat (AMER) Iridium\n\nMet MSI for METAREAs XVII and XVIII will be transmitted using rectangular addressed messaging that encompasses waters comprising these two METAREAs until Inmarsat-C receivers or Mini-C terminals operating in Arctic waters have been updated to recognize the SafetyNET address code C3 = 17 and 18 for METAREAs XVII and XVIII respectively. Users should note that meteorological MSI received by their sat-C terminals may be labeled as navigational MSI.\n\nMet MSI for the northwestern sections of METAREA IV is transmitted using rectangular addressed messaging that encompasses waters comprising Hudson Bay and Approaches. The SafetyNET address code for this rectangular area is C3 = 50n098w18030. Thus only those Inmarsat-C receivers aboard vessels navigating within the boundaries defined by this rectangular area will print out met MSI for the northwestern sections of METAREA IV.\n\nDuring the navigation season met MSI for sections of METAREA XVII and XVIII north of 70° N is broadcast via High Frequency Narrow Band Direct Printing (HF NBDP) on 8416.5 kHz from the CCG MCTS Centre in Iqaluit NU. Scheduled broadcast times are 03:30 UTC and 15:30 UTC daily. Mariners should note that actual HF service provision dates will be announced by CCG Navigational Warning.\n\nMariners navigating northern or Arctic waters may also obtain METAREAs forecast bulletin via internet by accessing Environment and Climate Change Canadaâs âDatamartâ web page. However, users are cautioned that the internet is not part of the GMDSS MSI dissemination system and should never be relied upon as the only means to obtain the latest marine forecast and warning information. Access to the internet may be interrupted from time to time, or updates may be delayed. Mariners are advised to refer to the appropriate GMDSS marine communication systems such as Inmarsat-C SafetyNET, International NAVTEX, or HF NBDP for the latest information.

Leads are corridors of mainly ice-free water surrounded by pack ice. 3 Special Ice Warning When one tenth or more of grey-white ice or older is expected to move into areas when that ice is not normally present, or forany unusual or significant ice event that may present a hazard to navigation.\n\n5.15.2 Ice Program\n\nIce forecasts are issued for daily, monthly and seasonal time scales.\n\n5.15.3 Ice Reports or Observations\n\nIce reports from ships or aircraft are normally relayed through MCTS Centres for broadcast. These reports are all assimilated in the daily ice charts produced by CIS.\n\n5.15.4 Ice Charts\n\nDaily ice charts are produced in areas of active marine activity. Recent satellite imagery as well as computer model output are used as guidance to create the charts. The charts depict the forecast of the ice conditions at the valid time. The area covered by the chart depends on the time of the season and these charts are normally broadcast at times specified in tables below.\n\nSatellite image analysis charts are produced for active marine areas when satellite is available. These represent the actual conditions at the time of the satellite image\n\nOnce a week, the CIS produces Regional ice charts. These charts are intended to be used as a planning tool and are available on the CIS webpages of Environment and Climate Change Canadaâs website.\n\nUsers should note that these charts are not broadcast through MCTS Centres.\n\n5.15.5 Weatheradio Canada\n\nIce forecasts and warnings are not broadcast via Weatheradio, however, mariners planning operations in waters impacted by hazardous ice conditions may obtain details regarding ice conditions by consulting the CIS webpages of Environment and Climate Change Canadaâs website, or by contacting their regional MCTS Centre. Detailed ice information may also be obtained through consultation with an Environment and Climate Change Canada meteorologist using the âWeather One-on-Oneâ 1-900 service at 1-900-565-5555. For cell phone users and credit card billing call 1-888-292-2222. User fees apply.\n\n5.15.6 CIS Service to Marine Forecast Areas\n\nThe CIS issues ice bulletins and forecasts for most marine forecast areas with navigable waters, including Lake Michigan and the U.S. portion of the Great Lakes, whenever the presence of ice may hinder or otherwise pose a hazard to navigation. The areas for which ice bulletins and forecasts are issued correspond to the marine forecast areas as depicted in the Chapter 5 regional maps; refer to your region of interest for further information.\n\n5.15.7 Daily Ice charts Broadcast\n\nThe following list describes daily ice charts produced to support marine activities which are available for broadcast from MCTS Sydney. All available charts can be transmitted or re-transmitted on request. Broadcast times are found in Part 2. The specific daily chart used to depict the ice conditions may vary depending on the location of the ice. For example, either Northeast or East Newfoundland charts may be provided, but not both at the same time.\n\nTable 5-67 - Ice Charts Listing Ice Charts Broadcast Site Seasonal Availability Iceberg limit Sydney MCTS Year round Gulf of St. Lawrence Sydney MCTS Winter Cabot Strait Sydney MCTS Winter Northeast or East Newfoundland Waters Sydney MCTS Winter Southeast Newfoundland Waters Sydney MCTS Winter Newfoundland Coast Sydney MCTS Winter\n\nTable 5-68 - MCTS Sydney Radio Facsimile Transmitter Details Call Sign Modulation Index of Cooperation Power Frequencies (kHz) Drum Speed VCO J3C (FM) 576 5 KW 4416, 6915.1 120 RPM\n\nFor correct reception of this broadcast on WMO standard facsimile recorders requiring 2300 Hz for White and 1500 Hz for Black, 1900 Hz centre frequency, radio receivers should be tuned in the UPPER SIDEBAND MODE or USB: add 1.9 to the indicated USB frequencies for FSK frequencies.\n\n5.15.8 Facsimile Broadcast\n\nUpon authorized request from CCG, Transport Canadaâs reconnaissance aircraft C-GCFR can transmit observed conditions via satellite fax.
