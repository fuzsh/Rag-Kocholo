        "text": "California's Sierra Nevada could see up to 10 feet of snow, which combined with powerful winds, blizzard conditions will make for life-threatening travel conditions at times through early Monday. Some locations could also experience power outages and tree damage because of the heavy accumulations.\n\nT​his system has been named Winter Storm Orzelle by The Weather Channel.\n\nThe winter storm is pushing through much of the West now. Below is the latest radar showing rain and mountain snow from Orzelle in the Pacific Northwest, California, the Great Basin and northern Rockies. Heavy snow is coming down in the Sierra Nevada.\n\nG​usty winds are also sweeping through the rest of the west, creating some wind damage and tumbleweed pileups in Utah.\n\nA​lready feet of snow: As of Sunday morning, parts of the Sierra have already measured more than seven feet of snow from the storm, including Donner Peak, along Interstate 80 northwest of Lake Tahoe. Soda Springs Ski Resort picked up 84 inches of snow.\n\nThe UC Berkeley Central Sierra Snow Lab near Soda Springs, California, has recorded over 60 inches of snow.\n\nW​inds gusted as high as 160 mph atop the summit at Palisades-Tahoe Ski Resort Thursday night, and numerous gusts from 50 to 80 mph have been clocked since Thursday from California to the northern Rockies.\n\nM​any got stuck in Donner Pass Friday night as conditions worsened.\n\n(​MORE: Meteorology 101 - All About Blizzard Requirements)\n\nForecast Timing: The activity should diminish, but snow showers as low as 1,000 feet elevation remain possible into the overnight Monday.\n\nAn additional 1-2 feet of snow is possible above 4,000 feet in the Northern Sierra through early Monday morning.\n\nR​ain and snow showers are not expected to completely shut off as the new work week begins. Several other smaller systems are expected to work through the West with much lighter precipitation and less gusty winds.\n\n(Further beef up your forecast with our detailed, hour-by-hour breakdown for the next 8 days – only available on our Premium Pro experience.)\n\nN​ot a major heavy rain threat: Heavy snow will be this storm's primary calling card. However, some rain will fall at elevations too warm for snow, primarily in Northern California.\n\nT​his will generally be of little to no impact going forward, but a stray rockslide is possible along with localized flooding.\n\nJonathan Erdman is a senior meteorologist at weather.com and has been covering national and international weather since 1996.
