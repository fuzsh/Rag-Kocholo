Here's why\n\nArticle content\n\nOttawa has officially taken over as the weather alert capital of the country.\n\nData released by Environment and Climate Change Canada reveals Ottawa had 65 weather advisories and warnings in 2022 – more than any other of the country’s major population centres.\n\nIt was the first time Ottawa has topped the weather alert table, which has been previously dominated by Quebec City. The national data table ranks 23 cities, including at least one from each province and territory.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles from Elizabeth Payne, David Pugliese, Andrew Duffy, Bruce Deachman and others.

A single alert can be issued for a severe weather event that lasts one hour or a full day, he noted, and does not necessarily reflect the impact of that event.\n\n“Because of this, the number of alerts listed does not necessarily reflect whether a city is receiving more or less severe weather in a particular year,” Cragg said, “or whether the severe weather it has received has been more impactful.”\n\nWhat’s more, the rules that govern the issuance of weather alerts vary from place to place in Canada.\n\nIn Iqaluit, for instance, a weather warning is issued for extreme cold only if the temperature is expected to reach -50C for at least two hours, while in Ottawa it’s issued when the temperature is expected to dip to -35C for at least two hours. In Montreal, the standard is -38C.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nSimilarly, Ottawa will receive a snowfall warning if 15 cm of snow is expected to fall within a 12-hour period. In parts of B.C., Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, it’s 10 cm.\n\nThe system is designed to account for the way people have acclimatized to their local conditions.\n\nCragg said he suspects Ottawa’s rising number of weather alerts may reflect an increase in warnings issued about summer heat waves and localized thunderstorms.\n\n“There’s a lot of summer thunderstorm activity in Ottawa and that would help to generate alerts,” Cragg said.\n\nLast year, the most damaging weather event in Ottawa was a powerful derecho thunderstorm that swept through the capital region on the afternoon of May 21.\n\nThe unusual storm, which featured strong, sustained winds, left 180,000 homes and businesses without power, toppled barns and sent a church steeple in Sarsfield crashing to the ground. The thunderstorm affected every part of Hydro Ottawa’s 1,100-square-kilometre coverage area and was significantly more damaging to the electrical grid than the 1998 ice storm or the 2018 tornadoes.\n\nArticle content\n\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada’s data shows Ottawa has been among the top four cities for weather alerts in each of the past seven years. During that time, it had no fewer than 46 weather warnings and advisories.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nIn the four years before that, however, Ottawa averaged just 32 weather alerts a year. In 2015, it ranked 12th among the country’s main population centres with 31 weather alerts.\n\nIn 2016, the number of weather alerts in Ottawa jumped to 50.\n\nThat sudden rise may be partially explained by the fact Environment and Climate Change Canada changed its approach to the issuance of heat warnings in Ontario in May 2016 to better account for the health threat posed by heat waves.\n\nStill, the increased volatility in Ottawa’s weather evinced by the data table is broadly consistent with predictions made about the impact of climate change on the National Capital Region.\n\nThe National Capital Commission (NCC) and the City of Ottawa commissioned a joint study to examine how the region is likely to be affected by climate change in the coming decades. That study, published in 2020, forecast a warmer and wetter climate in the National Capital Region whether greenhouse gas emissions grow at a moderate or high rate.\n\nWarming is expected throughout the year along with more precipitation in every season except summer. Summers are projected to be hotter, drier and more humid.\n\n“Conditions favourable for extreme events such as freezing rain, tornadoes and wildfires are projected to be more common,” the study said.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nCragg said firm conclusions about the impact of climate change in the National Capital Region can’t be drawn from the department’s weather alert data alone. There can be changes in how severe weather forms and flows across the country, he said, and Ottawa could be seeing something “cyclical in nature.”\n\n“I’d be reticent to draw conclusions straight from this data,” he said, adding: “It would have to be one piece of a larger puzzle.”\n\nWEATHER PHOTO GALLERY\n\nArticle content\n\nArticle content\n\nArticle content\n\nArticle content\n\nArticle content\n\nArticle content\n\nArticle content\n\nArticle content\n\nArticle content\n\nRECOMMENDED FROM EDITORIAL\n\nDeachman: Trying to keep up with an 88-year-old winter cyclist\n\nUnofficial plaque marks historic site of ‘Battle of Billings Bridge,’ almost one year later\n\nOttawa might’ve had a different mayor if not for the convoy.
