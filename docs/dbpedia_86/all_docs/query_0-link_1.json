        "text": "Thunderstorm Threats\n\nSevere Thunderstorm RISK Terminology\n\n(used in Hazardous Weather Outlooks)\n\nSLIGHT RISK: Severe thunderstorms are expected to be few or isolated.\n\nMODERATE RISK: Severe thunderstorms are expected to be more organized, numerous, or widespread.\n\nHIGH RISK: Severe thunderstorms with the potential for tornadoes, damaging windstorms, and/or large hail are expected\n\nSEVERE THUNDERSTORM or TORNADO WATCH Severe thunderstorms with large hail, damaging winds, and/or tornadoes are possible, but the exact time and location of storm development is still uncertain. A watch means be prepared for storms.\n\nSEVERE THUNDERSTORM WARNING A severe thunderstorm is imminent or occurring; it is either detected by weather radar or reported by storm spotters. A severe thunderstorm is one that produces winds 58 mph or stronger and/or hail 1 inch in diameter or larger. A warning means to take shelter.\n\nTORNADO WARNING A tornado is imminent or occurring; it is either detected by weather radar or reported by storm spotters. A warning means to take shelter.\n\nFLOOD WATCH Conditions are favorable for flash flooding. A watch means to get prepared for possible flooding.\n\nFLASH FLOOD WARNING Life-threatening flooding is imminent or occurring; it is either detected by weather radar, indicated by stream gauges, or reported by storm spotters. A flash flood is a flood that occurs very quickly; it is caused by heavy rainfall over a short period of time or from a dam break. A warning means to leave low-lying or flood prone areas.\n\nNon Precipitation Phenomena Warning Terminology\n\nThe State College NWS Office will issue Advisories and Warnings under the header \"PHLNPWCTP (WWUS71 KCTP)\" for situations where the following non-precipitation phenomena are expected :\n\nWinds NOT associated with a specific Thunderstorm:\n\nWind Advisory: sustained winds 31 to 39 mph, for better than 1 hour - and/or wind gusts 46 to 57 mph for any duration.\n\nHigh Wind Warning: sustained winds 40 mph or greater, for better than 1 hour - and/or wind gusts 58 mph or greater, for any duration.\n\nHigh Wind Watch: Possibility that High Wind Warning Criteria may be met at longer ranges (24 to 48 hrs out).\n\nWidespread Frosts/Freezes, after the beginning (and before the end) of the \"growing season\":\n\nThe BEGINNING of the growing season is set by the average date of the last freeze in spring, and normally happens during very late April to mid May in Central PA. The NWS will then issue Frost Advisories and Freeze Warnings when appropriate, until the end of the growing season, according to the following rules:\n\nFrost Advisory: a widespread frost, which typically occur with mainly clear skies and light winds, and low temperatures near or slightly above freezing (33°F to 36°F).\n\nFreeze Warning: low temperatures across the whole county/zone at or below 32°F.\n\nThe END of the growing season occurs when most of the county/NWS zone has had it's first freeze in the autumn (1/2 or more of the zone has reached 32°F or below) which usually occurs in late Sep to late Oct in Central PA. See a map of the Average Date of the First Autumn Freeze. As you might expect, the growing season is much shorter in the Northern Mountains than in the Lower Susquehanna Valley.\n\nFreeze Watch: Possibility that Freeze Warning Criteria may be met at longer ranges (24 to 48 hrs out).\n\nFor High Heat Indicies:\n\nExcessive Heat Warning: Heat indicies will attain or exceed 105°F. (see map of Excessive Heat Warning Threshold)\n\nHeat Advisory: Issued when the Heat Index will be equal to or greater than 100°F, but less than 105°F. (see map of Heat Advisory Threshold)\n\nExcessive Heat Watch: Possibility that Excessive Heat Warning Criteria may be met at longer ranges (12 to 48 hrs out).\n\nFor Widespread Dense Fog:\n\nDense Fog Advisory: widespread areas of fog reducing the visibility to less than 1/4 mile."
