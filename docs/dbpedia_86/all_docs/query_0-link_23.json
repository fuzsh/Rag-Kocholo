        "text": "Extreme Heat\n\nLocated near the urban Dallas / Fort Worth Metroplex, McKinney is at a greater risk from the effects of prolonged heat.\n\nVery common occurrence for the summer months of June through September, but can be recorded as early as April and late into November.\n\nExtreme heat is generally defined as temperatures that hover 10 degrees or more above the average high temperature for the region and last for several weeks.\n\nAir quality conditions may also deteriorate due to trapped pollutants, such as ozone from the atmosphere or carbon monoxide from vehicles.\n\nWhat to Do Before, During and After Extreme Heat | Spanish\n\nThe Heat Index takes the relative humidity into account, providing the \"feels like\" temperature.\n\nFind more information about heat and heat hazards\n\nSee NOAA's National Weather Service Heat Index chart\n\nAlert Levels\n\nExcessive Heat Outlook: Issued when the potential exists for an excessive heat event in the next 3 to 7 days.\n\nExcessive Heat Watch: Issued when conditions are favorable for an excessive heat event in the next 12 to 48 hours. A watch is used when the risk of an event has increased, but the timing and occurrence is still uncertain.\n\nExcessive Heat Warning / Advisory: Issued when an excessive heat event is expected within the next 36 hours. These are used when an event is occurring, is imminent or has a very high probability of occurring. The warning is used for conditions posing a threat to life or property, while the advisory is used for less serious conditions that cause significant discomfort or inconvenience and if caution is not taken, could lead to a threat to life or property.\n\nOzone Health Advisory: Issued when ozone levels in outdoor air are expected to be greater than 0.08 parts per million when averaged over an eight-hour period.\n\nTop\n\nFlooding Hazards\n\nA condition where two or more acres of normally dry land or two or more properties are inundated by water or mudflow. Flooding in McKinney can result from hurricane remnants, dam / levee failure, clogged drainage systems or rapid accumulation of rainfall.\n\nEarly Flood Warning Systems\n\nMcKinney roadway flooding status\n\nRegional roadway flooding status\n\nFlood Insurance\n\nThe National Flood Insurance Program was created in 1968 by Congress to help provide a means for individuals to protect themselves financially since most homeowner's insurance does not cover flooding.\n\nFlood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) display the following flood risk categories:\n\nHigh-risk areas | Special Flood Hazard Area)\n\nModerate-to-low risk areas | Non-Special Flood Hazard Area\n\nUndetermined-risk areas\n\nVisitExplore McKinney to see what areas in McKinney are at risk from flooding.\n\nFlash Flood vs. Flood\n\nFlash floods occur during heavy rain events and happens very quickly. They also end quickly,\n\nFlooding occurs as the result of a more prolonged rain event or lake / creek overflow. It is gradual, more predictable and lasts longer.\n\nWhat to Do Before, During and After a Flooding Event\n\nAlert Levels\n\nFlood Watch: Issued when flooding is possible in a given area.\n\nFlash Flood Watch: Issued when heavy rains and flash flooding are possible. You should be ready to move to higher ground immediately.\n\nFlood Warning: Issued when flooding is occurring or is imminent. If you are advised to evacuate, do so immediately.\n\nFlash Flood Warning: Issued when a flash flood is occurring and moving to higher ground is necessary.\n\nTop\n\nHail\n\nHail is produced when updrafts within a storm carry water droplets to a height in the sky where freezing occurs. These ice particles continue to grow as they circulate within a storm, allowing ice layers to build. When the ice, or hail, becomes too heavy for the storm to circulate, it falls to the ground. Hail is considered to be severe when it reaches a diameter of 0.75 inch or more.\n\nWhat to Do Before, During and After a Hail Event | Spanish\n\nHail occurs during severe thunderstorms and tornadoes so look and listen for warning information about these storms.\n\nEstimating Hail Size\n\nPea = 1/4 inch diameter\n\nMarble/Mothball = 1/2 inch diameter\n\nDime/Penny = 3/4 inch\n\nNickel = 7/8 inch\n\nQuarter = 1 inch\n\nPing-pong ball = 1 ½ inches\n\nGolf ball = 1 ¾ inches\n\nTennis Ball = 2 ½ inches\n\nBaseball = 2 ¾ inches\n\nTea cup = 3 inches\n\nGrapefruit = 4 inches\n\nSoftball = 4 ½ inches\n\nTop\n\nThunderstorms & Lightning\n\nTo generate a thunderstorm, the surrounding area needs moisture, unstable air and lift (such as a cold front). Thunderstorms have the capability to produce straight-line winds, large hail, flash floods and even tornadoes.\n\nWhat to Do Before, During and After a Thunderstorm | Spanish\n\nA dry thunderstorm can occur when the rain produced by the storm does not reach the ground, but evaporates in the air. Lightning will still strike and reach the ground, potentially starting structural and wildfires.\n\nThe National Weather Service classifies a thunderstorm as severe if its winds reach or exceed 58 mph, it produces a tornado or if it drops surface hail at least one inch in diameter.\n\nLightning is present in all thunderstorms and results from the buildup and discharge of electrical energy between positively and negatively charged areas.\n\nA cloud-to-ground lightning strike begins as an invisible channel of electrically charged air moving from the cloud toward the ground. When one channel nears an object on the ground, a powerful surge of electricity from the ground moves upward to the cloud and produces a visible lightning strike.\n\nAlert Levels\n\nSevere Thunderstorm Watch: Issued when the conditions are favorable for a thunderstorm to develop. A watch will tell you when and where severe thunderstorms are likely to occur.\n\nSevere Thunderstorm Warning: Issued when severe weather has been reported by spotters and indicated by radar. Warnings indicate imminent danger to life and property to those in the path of the storm.\n\nTop\n\nTornado Safety\n\nPeak tornado season for McKinney is March - May, but they are still possible in the summer and fall. Tornadoes may strike quickly with little or no warning and may appear translucent until dust and debris are picked up or a cloud forms in the funnel.\n\nTornadoes spawn from strong thunderstorms, a tornado appears as a rotating funnel-shaped cloud that extends to the ground with whirling winds. Tornadoes are rated on the Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale between 0 and 5.\n\nOperational Enhanced Fujita Scale\n\nEF Number3 Second Gust (MPH)065-85186-1102111-1353136-1654166-2005Over 200\n\nSheltering-in-Place\n\nGo to the link below for sheltering-in-place actions to take during a tornado.\n\nWhat to Do Before, During and After a Tornado | Spanish\n\nAlert Level\n\nTornado Watch: Issued when the conditions are favorable for a tornado to be produced. Watch the sky for signs of the storm and stay tuned to weather and news sources\n\nTornado Warning: Issued when a tornado has been sighted by storm spotters or indicated on radar. Take shelter immediately when there is a tornado warning for the City of McKinney or Collin County.\n\nTop"
