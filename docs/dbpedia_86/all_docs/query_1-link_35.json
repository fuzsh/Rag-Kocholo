        "text": "Weather warning indicating heavy snowfall amounts generated by convective lake-effect snow\n\nA lake effect snow warning is a bulletin issued by the National Weather Service in the United States to warn of heavy snowfall accumulations that are imminent from convective snow generated by very cold airmass passing over unfrozen lakes (lake effect snow). The criteria for amounts may vary significantly over different county warning areas.[1] On October 2, 2017, some National Weather Service Forecast Offices discontinued issuing the Lake Effect Snow Warning, and consolidated it with the Winter Storm Warning.[2] On October 15, 2018, the National Weather Service discontinued issuing Lake Effect Snow Warnings nationwide all together, and all offices consolidated it with the Winter Storm Warning.[3] Lake effect snow warnings were reinstated for the 2019â€“20 winter season.[4]\n\nEnvironment Canada's Meteorological Service of Canada issues similar warnings but they are called snowsquall warnings.\n\nExamples\n\n[edit]\n\n879 WWUS41 KBUF 171935 WSWBUF URGENT - WINTER WEATHER MESSAGE National Weather Service Buffalo NY 235 PM EST Tue Dec 17 2019 NYZ006-180345- /O.NEW.KBUF.LE.W.0001.191218T1400Z-191219T0000Z/ Oswego- Including the city of Oswego 235 PM EST Tue Dec 17 2019 ...LAKE EFFECT SNOW WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 9 AM TO 7 PM EST WEDNESDAY... * WHAT...Heavy lake effect snow expected.
