        "text": "National Grid is preparing for today’s shift from spring-like conditions to winter weather by increasing staffing and extending work shifts through Thursday. With forecasts calling for heavy rain, high winds and lake effect snow across portions of Upstate New York, the company has activated its comprehensive emergency response plan, which includes:\n\nSecuring external line crews and mobilizing them across Upstate New York to support restoration efforts for any customer interruptions.\n\nPre-staging materials and equipment in areas anticipated to be most severely impacted.\n\nProactively reaching out to elected, municipal and emergency management officials to keep them updated on our preparations and provide safety information.\n\nReaching out directly to customers through traditional and social media, email and texts and on our website to provide safety information and to urge them to be prepared.\n\nConducting outbound calls to life support and critical facility customers to ensure they are prepared.\n\nNational Grid remains committed to public safety and is prepared if the storm impacts the energy delivery system. The company also encourages customers to keep safety a priority with the following reminders:\n\nElectricity & Generator Safety\n\nIf a power outage occurs, customers can notify National Grid online to expedite restoration.\n\nGenerators used to supply power during an outage must be operated outdoors to prevent the buildup of deadly carbon monoxide. Before operating a generator, be sure to disconnect from National Grid’s system by shutting off the main breaker, located in the electric service panel. Failure to do this could endanger our crews and your neighbors.\n\nCustomers who depend on electrically powered life support equipment, such as a respirator, should register as a life support customer by calling National Grid at 1-800-642-4272. In a medical emergency, always dial 911.\n\nKeep working flashlights and an extra supply of batteries in your home and be sure to charge all electronic devices before the storm.\n\nStay tuned to local news outlets or the National Weather Service for storm updates, weather alerts\n\nIf the power is out, use flashlights or other battery-powered lights. Do not use candles, which can pose a fire hazard.\n\nPlease use caution when driving near emergency responders and crews restoring power.\n\nBe sure to check on elderly family members, neighbors and others who may need assistance during an outage.\n\nSafety Near Downed Power Lines\n\nAlways use extreme caution near downed power lines and wires, and always assume that they are carrying live electricity.\n\nNever touch a person or an object that is in contact with a downed line, as electricity can pass through to you.\n\nTake caution when approaching fallen trees, which could have power lines caught in them.\n\nRemember that water can conduct electricity. If you see a line down in a puddle or flooded area, avoid contact with the water to prevent risk of shock.\n\nLearn more about downed power line safety at our website.\n\nStay Informed and Connected\n\nCustomers with active electricity accounts who text ‘REG’ to 64743 can have personalized alerts sent to them via text, email or phone call when we detect an outage on their properties.\n\nCustomers also can text ‘OUT’ to 64743 to report an outage.\n\nFor real-time power outage information, online outage reporting, and in-depth storm safety information, visit National Grid’s Outage Central website. Customers are encouraged to make sure that National Grid has their correct addresses and phone numbers on file. Customers who create online profiles also can register for email alerts.
