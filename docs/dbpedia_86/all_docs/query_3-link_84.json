        "text": "SYRACUSE, N.Y. - Lake effect snow develops across the North Country this morning, gradually dropping south through CNY later today. Only minor impacts are expected for most of the region with a generally light snowfall accumulation. The highest amounts will be for the higher elevations to the north and northeast of Syracuse.\n\nThere are Winter Weather Advisories in effect for the areas that will see the highest snowfall totals. This includes, Oswego, Oneida, Herkimer, Lewis, and Jefferson Counties, in effect now through Wednesday late evening.\n\nThis morning we have a cold west wind coming off Lake Ontario creating lake effect snow across the North Country. Then our wind direction changes to a northwest flow later today as a weather system passes by to our north, pushing the lake effect snow south through CNY.\n\nLake effect snow timing with our Futurecast:\n\nTotal snowfall accumulation by tonight:"
