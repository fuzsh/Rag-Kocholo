        "text": "After a band of heavy lake effect snow developed Friday morning and dumped over 2 feet of snow across La Porte Co., IN, we will finally see an end to the lake effect snow this weekend!\n\nA WINTER STORM WARNING will be in effect for La Porte and St. Joseph Co., IN and Berrien Co., MI until 10 p.m. Saturday. A band of heavy lake effect snow will continue to impact the warning area. Additional snowfall totals under the band of heavy lake effect snow will range from 1 to 3\", though there could be some heavier pockets. Traveling will be very difficult under the heaviest snow.\n\nA WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY will be in effect for Elkhart Co., IN and Cass Co., MI until to 10 p.m. Saturday. Snowfall totals could range from 1-2\".\n\nLake effect is expected to continue through Saturday afternoon, potentially giving impacted areas an additional 1 to 3\" of snow.\n\nSeveral plows are out across the region clearing the fluffy snow, however drivers should be aware of a layer of ice underneath the snow. There could be some slick spots, some roads that are still snow covered and reduced visibility from blowing snow!\n\nRoad conditions will improve for many as we head into the afternoon, though it might take a little longer for areas in LaPorte County to be dug out.\n\nAs the snow comes to an end Saturday, cold air will still be in place. Highs will be in the low 20s, but feel like the single digits thanks to the wind.\n\nThere will likely still be slick spots through Sunday morning as overnight temperatures fall to around 0.\n\nRoads will improve greatly through the day Sunday as we return to the low 20s and even see some sunshine! Outside of a wintry mix in the first half of the week, melting will continue with highs climbing into the upper 30s by the end of the week."
