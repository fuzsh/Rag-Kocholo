        "text": "Weather Summary for the Next 24 Hours:\n\nHot and humid conditions can be expected to develop across the state throughout the day. While conditions will be less breezy compared to yesterday, wind gusts upwards of 15-20 mph will develop throughout the day across the Sunshine State. Lingering tropical moisture from the Big Bend and throughout the Peninsula will give way to scattered showers and thunderstorms during the peak heating hours of the afternoon and evening (20-40% chance of rain). Any of these thunderstorms could become strong to severe, and may be capable of producing frequent lightning, gusty winds (40-50 mph) and heavy downpours. With any additional rainfall over flooding areas and saturated grounds and soils, flooding may be exacerbated from showers and thunderstorms today, especially from the Big Bend and through Southwest Florida. The Weather Prediction Center (WPC) is outlooking a Marginal Risk (level 1 of 4) for Flash Flooding today due to the potential for additional flooding.\n\nDangerously hot and humid conditions will develop across the state as high temperatures will reach the 90s this afternoon and heat index values climb well into triple digits (105-115-degrees). An Excessive Heat Warning will go into effect at 11:00 AM EDT/10:00 AM CDT across the eastern Panhandle and through the western Suwannee Valley as dangerously hot and humid conditions will create heat index values upwards of 115-degrees this afternoon. Heat Advisories will go into effect later this morning throughout the rest of the state where heat index values of 112-degrees can be expected this afternoon. Those responding to and recovering from Debby should take precaution and practice heat safety, including taking breaks from direct sunlight, wear loose fitting clothing and drinking plenty of water.\n\nShowers and thunderstorms will continue into the evening hours and early overnight hours before dissipating overnight (15-20% chance of rain). A weak frontal boundary will attempt to approach the western Panhandle later in the day before stalling west of the Apalachicola River overnight. Low temperatures will remain in the middle to upper 70s and low 80s. These mild low temperatures and humid conditions overnight will bring little relief compared to daytime heat and humidity.\n\nTropical Storm Debby: As of 8:00 AM EDT, Debby was located about 65 miles west-northwest of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and moving northwestward at 7 mph. The storm is expected to accelerate toward the north-northwest and north across eastern South Carolina and central North Carolina through tonight. Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph with higher gusts. Continued weakening is forecast during the next day or so, and Debby is likely to become a tropical depression this afternoon and evening.\n\nNear the Lesser and Greater Antilles: An area of low pressure could form in the central or western tropical Atlantic Ocean early next week. Some development of this system is possible while it approaches the Lesser Antilles during the early to middle part of next week and moves generally westward to west-northwestward towards the Greater Antilles thereafter. There is a low chance (near 0%) for development through the next 48 hours, and low chance (30%) through the next 7 days. This system poses no direct threat to Florida through the next 7-10 days, at least.\n\nFor the latest on the tropics, please visit the National Hurricane Center (NHC) at www.hurricanes.gov.\n\nFire Weather: Minimal fire concerns will continue today as relative humidity values will remain above critical thresholds. Drier conditions along the far western Panhandle will bring relative humidity values into the low 40%. Lingering breezy wind gusts of 15-20 mph will develop throughout the day across the state. According to the Florida Forest Service, there are 8 active wildfires across the state burning approximately 194 acres.\n\nDrought: Widespread improvements on last week’s drought monitor update (8/1) as soil moisture and streamflows improved. Abnormally dry conditions remain in place across southern and central portions of the Suwannee Valley with an isolated pocket between Bartow and Sebring. A pocket of abnormally dry to moderate drought conditions remains in place near Melbourne. Drought reduction will be likely this week in the wake of Debby’s excessive rainfall.\n\nThe Keetch-Byram Drought Index average for Florida is 86 (+16) on a scale from 0 (very wet) to 800 (very dry). There are no Florida Counties with an average KBDI over 500 (drought/increased fire danger).\n\nFlash Flooding: Grounds and soils remain very saturated following rainfall from Debby, and any additional rainfall today could exacerbate any ongoing flooding. The Weather Prediction Center (WPC) is outlooking a Marginal Risk (level 1 of 4) for Flash Flooding from the eastern Big Bend through Northeast Florida and the I-4 corridor where any additional rainfall could bring flooding. Any heavy and intense downpours could bring localized flash flooding for urban and low-lying/poor drainage areas through the afternoon and evening hours.\n\nRiverine Flooding: With heavy rainfall from Debby, rivers are already beginning to rise in response across the Big Bend, Northeast and West Florida. Numerous River Flood Warnings are in effect as rainfall deposits into the river basins. Moderate riverine flooding is ongoing for the Alafia River at Lithia, Little Manatee River at Wimauma, and Myakka River at Myakka River State Park. Minor flooding is ongoing throughout the Hillsborough River and Cypress Creek, Manatee River at Myakka Head and Horse Creek near Arcadia. Major flooding is ongoing for the St. Mary’s River at Macclenny but is forecast to fall into moderate flood stage later today. Minor to moderate riverine flooding is ongoing throughout the northern Suwannee River and Santa Fe River. The Santa Fe River at Fort White and at Three Rivers Estates are still forecast to rise into major flooding stage over the next several days. The Aucilla River and lower Suwannee River are currently within Action Stage (bank-full) but are forecast to rise into minor flooding through the next couple of days. Long-term minor to moderate flooding can be expected along the Suwannee River as the crest wave gradually propagates through the basin. Additional rises within water levels can be expected over the next several days in response to the heavy rainfall. Any heavy rainfall that occurs across southern Georgia will flow downstream into already elevated water levels and allow for additional rises. For more details, please visit the River Forecast Center.\n\nLake Okeechobee’s average elevation is 13.86 feet, which is within the operational band and 0.00 feet below normal for this time of year."
