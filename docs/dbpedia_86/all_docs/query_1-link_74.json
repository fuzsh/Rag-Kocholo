        "text": "MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (WMBF) - Very heavy rain overnight and early this morning has lead to areas of flooding across the Grand Strand. Additional showers and storms will remain possible today.\n\nFLASH FLOOD WARNING\n\nA FLASH FLOOD WARNING remains in effect for southwestern Brunswick County in southeastern North Carolina, Georgetown County and coastal Horry County until 7:30 AM.\n\nAreas of heavy rain have been falling across the warned area. Between 1 and 3 inches of rain have fallen during the past 3 hours on already saturated grounds. Additional rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches are possible. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly.\n\nDangerous flooding from heavy rainfall can be expected, especially\n\nnear poor drainage areas and other flood prone locations. It is\n\nharder to recognize flood dangers at night, as it will be difficult\n\nto determine the depth of the water. Roads may be damaged or washed\n\naway. Most flood deaths occur in vehicles. If flooding is observed,\n\nthen turn around, don`t drown.\n\nFLASH FLOOD WATCH\n\nThe FLASH FLOOD WATCH has been extended through the evening. This morning’s rain will ease up by late morning into midday with a round of pop up storms developing this afternoon. With the ground saturated from Debby’s rainfall, additional storms could quickly lead to areas of flash flooding.\n\nTHROUGH THE WEEKEND\n\nDebby will continue to pull away from the region on Friday and will be long gone by the weekend. The result will be a gradual return to more typical mid-August weather.\n\nLingering tropical moisture will maintain a 60% chance of showers and storms at times on Friday between rounds of sunshine. Temperatures will climb into the middle 80s.\n\nThe weekend will see rain chances continuing to drop to around 40% on both Saturday and Sunday - pretty typical for this time of the year. Afternoon temperatures on both days will climb into the middle and upper 80s.\n\nRIVER FLOODING\n\nWith the recent heavy rainfall, local rivers are already swollen and climbing. The National Weather Service expects flooding to occur on all area rivers, with the Waccamaw River forecast to reach minor flood stage on Friday. Inland rivers may take an extra day or two to crest, hitting the highest levels over the weekend. We have a full breakdown of the river flooding threat here."
