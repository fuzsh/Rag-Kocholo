Redman, a primary marksmanship instructor with Weapons and Field Training Battalion, adjusts the position of a recruit during marksmanship training March 1, 2016, on Parris Island, S.C. Marksmanship instructors, like Redman, 25, from Pittsburgh, teach recruits the fundamentals of marksmanship before shooting live ammunition the following week. Oscar Company is scheduled to graduate April 15, 2016. Parris Island has been the site of Marine Corps recruit training since Nov. 1, 1915. Today, approximately 19,000 recruits come to Parris Island annually for the chance to become United States Marines by enduring 12 weeks of rigorous, transformative training. Parris Island is home to entry-level enlisted training for approximately 49 percent of male recruits and 100 percent of female recruits in the Marine Corps. (Photo by Pfc. Carlin Warren).
