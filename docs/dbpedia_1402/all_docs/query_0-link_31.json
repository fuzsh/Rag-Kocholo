        "text": "After hearing short presentations from four candidates for the interim borough council member position that will last until January 3, 2022, the Gettysburg Borough Council elected Nicholas Redman to fill the seat vacated by former council president Jake Schindel.\n\nRedman said he had been a resident of Gettysburg for 9 years, 4 of them as a student at Gettysburg College and had recently purchased a house on Ridge Ave.\n\n“I’ve really felt like I’m a member of this community and I was looking for a way to give back,” said Redman. Redman said he had been a member of several committees at the college, and had held a position drafting legislation for the New York State Legislature. Although acknowledging the borough council was its own challenge, Redman said “the principles are the same – members of the community working to serve their fellows.”\n\nChad-Alan Carr, Brian Hodges, and Robert Krummerich were not selected, although Carr and Hodges said they will be running in the November election to serve the remainder of Schindel’s term, which ends in 2003.\n\nIn a unanimous vote Wes Heyser was nominated and unanimously voted to serve as council president until January 2022 and Matt Moon was unanimously voted to serve as vice president.\n\nRedman’s election went through three rounds of voting.\n\nOn the first round, Redman received 2 votes (Butterfield and Lawver), Kummerich received 2 votes (Heyser and Berger), and Carr received 2 votes (Moon and Lawson).\n\nFor the second round of voting Hodges was removed from consideration. Redman received 3 votes (Butterfield, Heyser, and Lawver), Kummerich received 1 vote (Berger), and Carr received 2 votes (Moon and Lawson).\n\nFor the third round, Kummerich was removed and Redman received the necessary four votes (Berger, Butterfield, Lawver, and Hyser). Lawson and Moon voted for Carr.\n\nCouncil members thanked all of the candidates and encouraged them to stay involved in local government.\n\nButterfield said she thought “all of the candidates brought positives.”\n\nHeyser said he did not choose either Carr or Hodges because he thought the council might be seen as influencing the political process, given they would be running for the position while in office..\n\nMoon said “I’m not voting against anyone; I’m voting enthusiastically for Mr. Carr.”\n\nubmission)\n\n1.
