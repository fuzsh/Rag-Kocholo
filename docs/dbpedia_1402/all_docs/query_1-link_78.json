        "text": "Dr. Redmanâ€™s research program focuses on quality and patient safety in nursing practice environments and their impact on clinical and organizational outcomes. He has conducted a number of research projects based on this focus, ranging in scope from the patient to the organizational level. Currently he is involved in three projects: the first is finalizing an instrument to measure patient expectations for care; second, he is examining the relationship between adverse patient events and nurse staffing at the unit level; and finally, Dr. Redman is collaborating with an interdisciplinary team to examine effective interdisciplinary team performance in emergency clinical events."
