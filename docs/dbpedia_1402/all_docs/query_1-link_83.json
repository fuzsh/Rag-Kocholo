        "text": "In spite of the fact that most of our classmates are retired, no one seems to have the time to write to the secretary and tell the news of his family. The forty-one living members are scattered in sixteen states, the District of Columbia (Oliver Cromwell), and Max Hartmann lives anywhere in the world that he can find a place to lay his head.\n\nOnly one of our members is a bachelor, Randall Cooke, and he has remained single because he has lived in the same house in which he was born and never went out so the girls could see what a wonderful husband he would be.\n\nThe three classmates, King Benton, Pitcher Glaze, and Hamp Howe, who live in California and Bobby Wallace who lives in Florida are the only ones who have not been snowed in this winter.\n\nWinifred Glaze writes, \"Where Ralph gets his pep and ambition is beyond me. He never runs less than four miles a day over hill and dale, and when he gets back spends the rest of the day in the garden. A big hello to all the classmates from the Glazes.\"\n\nIf there is anyone who would like a copy of the 1906 Aegis, send two dollars to the Secretary's Office, 205 Crosby Hall, Hanover, N. H. 03755, and they will be glad to send one to you.\n\nAs he has for several years, Ned French is the first classmate to send in a gift to the 1967 Alumni Fund. Ned has moved his office to 10 Post Office Square and his man address is P.O. Box 2317, Boston, Mass. 02107.\n\nIf you have not sent in your contribution to the 1967 Alumni Fund, please do so as soon as possible. We need your help.\n\nCatherine and Arthur Chapin are back from their western trip and Edith and Leigh Martin are back home from Palm Springs.\n\nIn May, Phil Chase, Hamp Howe, and Watson Smith will have another candle on their birthday cakes.\n\nFred Baldwin '07, the honorary \"TownCrier\" of Provincetown, Mass., callinghis classmates to their 60th Reunion.\n\nSecretary and Class Agent 420 Merwyn Rd., Merion Station, Pa. 19066"
