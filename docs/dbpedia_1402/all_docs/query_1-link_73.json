        "text": "Got a 1970s Redman Unity shortboard for $30 in 2017 (Jack Meyer airbrush). Worked on that board and stared at it for 8 months. Finished it and sold to one of Jack's relatives. Never rode it. Want the full story and pics? http://backyardbullard.com/surf-she...manville-and-possible-airbrush-by-jack-meyer/\n\nHas any one ever had a board that long and never ridden it?\n\nNice to see the nod to Redman.\n\nAs far as Jack Meyer, who also passed all too soon\" he was a friend & did my 1st logo way back when. Just a couple days ago an Meyer double dolphin airbrushed Owl surfboard I shaped & glassed in 1972 came up for sale. I was going to buy it but was told his son & family have been seeking boards with Jack's work, and it sold to them.\n\nI thought that was very fitting and would've given them the board had I scooped them on it.\n\nRedman, Meyer, and to many other great & deserving craftsman & artists have passed onto the great lineup in the sky.\n\nI hope the surf is firing wherever they may be.\n\nNice to see the nod to Redman.\n\nAs far as Jack Meyer, who also passed all too soon\" he was a friend & did my 1st logo way back when.

Redman shaped me one of the best riding surfboards that I ever owned. Unfortunately, that board got ridden to death. A victim of the light glass jobs from the 1980's where everything unraveled due to delamination. I wish I still had that board even in bad condition.\n\nAnother nod I would like to give is to a San Fernando Valley shaper named Ken Polinski. Kenny was a friend of both Glenn Kennedy and Greg Liddle. He had a small shop in the West San Fernando Valley called Innervision Surfboards. Kenny got his wings as a production shaper for Con Surfboards in the 1970's. One of the nicest people you every met and he could recreate just about anything. I use to bring him some of my hair brain projects and he would do them with no questions asked other than what I wanted even with the idea that he was skeptical of whether it worked or not. Of the more normal boards he shaped for me, they were works of art in my opinion and if alive today, he would no doubt in my opinion, be up there with the best of them. Ken Polinski died of a brain tumor in the late 1980's.\n\nI had heard the name Redman mentioned reverently for a few years as a great shaper and tracked him down to Hatteras Island Surf Shop where he moonlighted on weekends. I was fortunate to have him shape 3 custom boards for me in the 90's - two 9'6\" \"modern/classic\" longboards and one \"Evolution\" model. In the picture his boards are the two standing upright and the one on the right on the ground. All are great boards which I still have - the single stringer 9'6\" I keep in Mexico as my number 1 board, it's just a great all purpose board the works from 2 feet to 2 feet overhead.\n\nAttachments\n\nSurfboards.jpg"
