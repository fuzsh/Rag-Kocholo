        "text": "HAVE YOU PAW YOUR CLASS DUES?\n\nWhile in Hanover I took the time to view the portrait of Harold Rugg, which was painted by Paul Sample and given to the College by the Library staff and the New Hampshire Alpha of Phi Beta Kappa. Be sure to see-it the next time you are in Hanover.\n\nCalled on Shorty Davis at Dick's House and found him in excellent spirits in spite of his many tribulations. When I left him he was expecting Florence to take him to the Dartmouth-Colgate game.\n\nNed French was at the Colgate game looking younger and healthier than ever. Either his fishing trip or his operation did him a world of good.\n\nSaw Lorraine and Halsey and was surprised to learn that freshman Bill was a member of the Dartmouth Band. I understand that he's a very accomplished musician and can play most any kind of an instrument. Bob Edgerton is at Andover.\n\nWent to see Harold and found him preparing for another sojourn at the hospital. He expected to enter on October 26.\n\nI met another classmate whom I had not seen for a great many years. Wore glasses and had put on so much weight I couldn't place him at first. It seems that 48 years ago he hurt his knee in the Colgate game so he came back with Mrs. Swasey to celebrate.\n\nEighteen '06 men and one guest were present at the 1905-1906 dinner at the Algonquin Club, Boston, on October 23. Our florist, Harvey Whittemore, had a white carnation for each '06 man and a white chrysanthemum for each '05 man. President Powers presided and called on a number of men from both classes for a brief oration. The only business transacted was the acceptance of the Treasurer's report and the announcement that Francis Childs had agreed to prepare the Secretary's report for our 50th Reunion. Those present were Chapin, Cheney, Childs,Connell, Cooke, Cromwell, Denison, Dwyer,Frazier, Ned French, Leverone, Neal, Powers,Rainie, Redman, Russell, Wallace and Harvey Whittemore. Our guest was Dr. Hill, Cromwell's son-in-law.\n\nOn November 1, Ray Butterfield accepted a call to the Perkinsville (Vt.) Community Church.\n\nRuth and Eliot Cogswell and Mary and Bill Page were guests at the Hanover Inn the last of September.\n\nMax Hartmann writes from \"Yougoslavie\" that he will be home for Christmas but plans to start travelling again in the spring.\n\nNew addresses: Cutting, Ray - % Mrs. Beatrice Cram, Northfield Falls, Vt.; French,Charles W. - 226 Chestnut Street, Lynnfield, Mass.; Wood, Robert W. - 1005 So.
