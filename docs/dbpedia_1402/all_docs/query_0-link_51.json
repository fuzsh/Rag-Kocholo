Redman Sr. (1740-1836) and Jane Gamble (1742-).[Needs source].\n\nJohn Redman Jr., a 'Free Person of Color', served in the American Revolution. In 1775, George Washington opened enlistment in the Continental Army for free blacks. Over the course of the American Revolutionary War, approximately 5,000 African American men joined the American side, fighting in integrated military units and generally for two consecutive years, or more, in some cases the full war versus the short term enlistments of white soldiers.[1]\n\nJohn Redman's military service and activities with the 1st Virginia Regiment of Light Dragoons is derived from the Op-Ed 'Native Sons of Liberty' contribution in The New York Times on 6 August 2006 by his 5th great grandson and one of the few African Americans to be inducted into the Sons of the American Revolution, Harvard Professor, Dr. Henry Louis Gates Jr.:[2]\n\nOn June 11, 1823, a man named John Redman walked into the courtroom of Judge Charles Lobb in Hardy County, Virginia, to apply for a pension, claiming to be a veteran of the Revolutionary War. Redman, more than 60 years old, testified that he had been in the First Virginia Regiment of Light Dragoons from Christmas 1778 through 1782, serving initially as a waiter to Lt. Vincent Howell.\n\nThe Light Dragoons fought mainly on horseback, using sabers, pistols, and light carbines. They marched from Winchester, Va., to Georgia, where, in the fall of 1779, they laid siege to Savannah. The following year, they fought in Charleston, S.C., narrowly escaping capture in a rout by the British. Redman's regiment fought the Creek Indians and the British early in 1782, ultimately triumphing over them in June at Sharon, Ga., near Savannah. After the war, Redman settled in Hardy County, where he and his wife kept a farm''.[3]\n\nJohn Redman's service is recorded in Johnston's West Virginians in the American Revolution. This record indicates that John [Service-Virginia; Va. No. 19017; No. W. 5691] was born in Hampshire County, Virginia in 1763 and died October 8, 1836. John enlisted in 1778 and remained in service until 1783 in the First Virginia Regiment with commanders listed. John's marriage to Sarah Day is recorded as 1785, along with his pension, Sarah's pension and relatives named Richard, Nimrod and Rachel. Notably, A Richard Redman [Service-Virginia; Va. No. 20867; No. S. 38327], born in 1759 and likely John's brother also served as a Private in the company of Capt. Atwell, Second Virginia Regiment. Richard served 18 months, was honorably discharged and received a pension in 1829.[4]\n\nJohn Redman, by occupation a farmer, married Sarah Day (alias Daye) in say 1785, which was recorded in Hampshire County, Virginia.[4]Their farm was located in the Shenandoah-Valley area. In 1785, that part of Hampshire County, Virginia went into the formation of Hardy County, Virginia. John and Sarah had 8 sons and 1 daughter born at Hardy County, Virginia.[1]\n\nReuben Redman (b. 1784; d. 25 Feb 1863, IN),\n\nMoses Redman (b. 1789; d. 13 Jun 1781, OH),\n\nIsaac Redman (b. 1796),\n\nNimrod (alias Rod) Redman (b. 1798),\n\nSanford Redman (b. 1804)\n\nBenjamin Redman (b. 1805),\n\nLucy Redman (b. 1806; d. Apr 1857),\n\nJoel Redman (b. 1808),\n\nEdmund Redman (b. 1809; d. 20 Jul 1898, Wayne, OH)\n\nBased on an 1803 tax record, John's occupation is listed as 'Farmer' and his wife, Sarah, as a 'spinner'.[5]\n\nOn 11 June 1820, at 60 years of age, John made a declaration in the Hardy County, Virginia Court to obtain a military pension for his services during the American Revolutionary War stating that he enlisted at Winchester, Hampshire, Virginia. He testified in the courtroom of Judge Charles Lobb in regarding his military pension application. A neighbor and fellow veteran named John Jenkins affirmed his court testimony.[6] A few weeks later, John was granted his Certificate of Pension in Hardy County, Virginia and received $8/month until his death in 1836.[7]\n\nThere is a US Census Record for John Redman Sr., who could be the father of the John Redman in this profile. The census was taken at Westmoreland, Virginia. There are no other Redmans listed in this area on this census.[8]\n\nThe 1830 U.S. Census shows John Redman as a 'Free Colored Person' residing in Hardy, Virginia. There was a total of six persons residing in the household. Also listed individually on this census are Robert Redman, James Redman and Nimrod Redman[9]\n\nJohn Redman Jr. died 8 October 1836 in his 76th year at Hardy, Virginia.[10]His will was entered into probate on 18 October 1836 at Hardy, West Virginia.[11]\n\nJohn's widow, Sarah, applied for a survivor's pension on 9 August 1838 stating that they had been married about 50 years prior and that her husband died on 8 Oct 1836. Richard Redman made an affidavit stating that John Redman married Sarah about 2 years after the American Revolutionary War [the war ended 3 September 1783].[12] Mrs. Rachel Redman, wife of Richard Redman, made an affidavit stating Sarah's maiden name was Sarah DAY.[12] In 1844, Sarah (Day) Redman, widow of John, who was 80 years of age, received a widow's military widow's pension at Hardy County, Virginia.[13]\n\nOn 26 May 1849, Nimrod Redman, 51 years of age, appeared in the Hardy County, Virginia Court stating that he was the son of John and Sarah, who died 4 Nov 1848,[14]\n\nResearch Notes\n\nThis John Redman's line has been professionally researched because he is the 5th great-grandfather of well-known Harvard Professor Dr. Henry Louis \"Skip\" Gates Jr., who is the first African American to be accepted as a member of the Sons of the American Revolution Society based on this John Redman's military service. Dr. Henry Louis Gates Jr. is the host of the PBS \"Finding Your Roots\" genealogy televised PBS program. The program uses FTDNA, 23andme and African Ancestry for DNA analyses.\n\nIt is not known if Dr. Henry Louis Gates Jr. found a living Redman descendant.
