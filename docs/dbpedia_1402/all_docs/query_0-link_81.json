It is merely a record of facts which if not soon presented in this tangible form might easily be blotted out forever.\n\nAs it is intended as a history and record of Redmanship in Kentucky only, I have made but brief mention of those intensely interesting events leading up to the establishment of the Great Council of the United States. They will be found recorded in the Official History of the Order in detail, and the reader is referred to its pages for the most complete information.\n\nThe records of Redmanship in Kentucky have been diligently searched, a careful digest made of them, and I believe the information herein contained may be regarded as authentic.\n\nI am indebted to many brothers for kindly assistance in the compilation of these pages, and I wish to thank them one and all for the many courtesies shown me.\n\nFraternally, in F. F. & C.,\n\nFrank L. Smith.\n\nLexington, Kentucky, 1st Snow Moon, G. S. D. 418.\n\n8\n\nSTYLE OF DATING\n\nPrior to the year A. D. 1865, the Jewish style namely, the Year of the World, was observed by Red Men in dating their documents. At the Council held in G. S. 5626, this system was discontinued and G. S. D. (Great Sun of Discovery) was adopted, the year of 1492 being considered G. S. D. 1. For convenience it was determined that the Great Sun should commence on the first of the Cold Moon, to conform to the common era. 9\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nTHE FORE-HISTORY (1765-1833).\n\nThe history of the Improved Order of Red Men is so interwoven with the history of the struggles of the American Colonies for independence that to record the one is to repeat the other in a great measure.\n\nThe first settlers upon this continent were imbued with the spirit of freedom, and to gain this object left their mother country. The American shores became the asylum of the oppressed of all nationalities. They were not, however, thus easily to escape the hand of British tyranny. The British Government soon learned that the American colonists were a thrifty, prosperous people, strong and skilled in the arts and sciences and were rapidly gaining wealth. The temptation to tax these people for the maintenance of its government and army was too strong upon the mother country, and severe taxes were imposed; but the right of representation in the British Parliament was denied them.\n\nThis usurpation of power created the greatest dissatisfaction among the colonists, who repeatedly memorialized the English Government for relief, and for redress for their many wrongs, but without avail.\n\nAs early as 1765, it was the custom of the citizens of the city of Boston and vicinity to assemble and discuss the aggravating situation. Their favorite place of meeting was under the famous Liberty Tree, which stood at what is now the corner of Essex and Washington streets. These citizens had perfected a permanent organization, bound together by signed pledges to appose by all legitimate means the enforcement of the obnoxious \"Stamp Act.\" It is not known that at that time they had any particular name for their organization, but Col. Barre, in a speech in the House of Commons, February 7, 1765, referred to American colonists in opposition to the stamp act as the \"Sons of Liberty,\" and this name seems to have been applied to them from that time.\n\nOn the 13th of May, 1766, the news of the repeal of the stamp act was received in Boston and was celebrated under the Liberty Tree and on the Commons with great rejoicing. 10\n\nThe repeal of the stamp act, however, did not satisfy the patriots. While the excessive taxation that had been so oppressive and burdensome had been removed, the English Government still held to their right to tax the colonists, and did so tax them, though in a lighter degree.\n\nThe Sons of Liberty called a meeting on the afternoon of the 13th of May, 1767, at Faneuil Hall and prepared a petition to the Governor for the removal of a British warship from Boston harbor which was there for the purpose of enforcing the taxation laws.\n\nA meeting was held March 6th, in Faneuil Hall, with nearly three thousand members present, Samuel Adams presiding, to protest against the presence of British soldiers in the city, the result of their presence being riot and bloodshed.\n\nNovember 3, 1773, a meeting of the Sons of Liberty was called under the Liberty Tree to protest against the landing of certain ships supposed to be laden with taxable tea. Notice of the meeting was posted, and it bore at the bottom this legend: \"Show me the man that dare take this down.\"\n\nThere is also a record of a meeting of the Sons of Liberty in the old tavern in Providence, R. I., at about the same time, November 3, 1773.\n\nOn the 16th of December, 1773, occurred the famous \"Boston Tea Party,\" given under the auspices of the Sons of Liberty of Boston and Vicinity.\n\nOn March 1, 1776, the Sons of Liberty held their first meeting in Baltimore. Wm. Paca, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, was the secretary. In Savannah, Ga., the first meeting was held July 14, 1774, when they concurred in the action of their Northern brethren. In 1765, the first meetings were held in South Carolina, and in New York meetings were held about concurrent with those in Massachusetts.\n\nWhen first organized the Sons of Liberty had no thought of Independence, but were loyal to the British crown, though protesting against \"taxation without representation.\"\n\nTheir motto was \"FREEDOM,\" however, and as that could not be obtained under British rule, as a last resort they determined to be free and independent.\n\nIt is unnecessary to here record the many deeds of heroism performed by the Sons of Liberty, the \"Liberty Boys,\" the \"Minute Men\" and the members thereof. They will be found emblazoned upon every page of the history of the American Revolution.\n\nIn many localities the Sons of Liberty adopted the title of \"Sons of Saint Tamina,\" or \"Saint Tamina Society,\" and set apart the first day of May as their anniversary. 11\n\nWe quote from the Official History of the Great Council of the United States, page 158, as follows:\n\n\"In this year, 1771, and for many years later, there existed in the town of Annapolis a society called the 'Saint Tamina Society,' who set apart the first day of May in memory of Saint Tamina, their patron saint, whose history is now lost in fable and uncertainty. It was usual, on the morning of this day, for the members of this society to erect in some public location in the city 'a May-pole,' and to decorate it in a most tasteful manner with wild flowers, gathered from the adjacent woods, and forming themselves in a ring around it, hand in hand, perform the 'war-dance' with many other customs which they had seen exhibited by the 'Children of the Forest.' It was also usual, on this day, for such of the citizens as chose to enter into the amusements, to wear a piece of buck-tail in their hats, or in some conspicuous part of their dress. General invitations were given out, and a large company usually assembled during the course of the evening, and whilst engaged in the midst of a dance, the company would be interrupted by the sudden intrusion of a number of the Saint Tamina Society, habited like Indians, who, rushing violently into the room, singing war songs and giving the 'whoop,' commenced dancing in the style of that people. After this ceremony, they made a collection of money, and retired evidently well pleased with their reception and entertainment.\"\n\nAt a later date the day for celebration was changed from the first day of May to the 12th, which is now observed as \"St. Tamminy's Day.\"\n\nAfter the close of the Revolutionary War, the object for which they had banded themselves together having been accomplished, the Sons of Liberty, or Saint Tamina Societies, became less prominent in public affairs, and it was the differences of opinion among the citizens as to the permanent form the government should take that brought them again to the front as a political organization with the addition to their motto of \"FRIENDSHIP.\"\n\nThe Saint Tamina Societies, or Societies of St. Tammany, as they were variously called, became quite powerful in the political affairs of the young nation and were organized in all parts of the country from the close of the Revolutionary War up to as late as 1820.\n\nThe only record we find of this Society in Kentucky is in Ranck's History of Lexington, from which we quote the following:\n\n\"A St. Tammany Society was instituted in Lexington about this time, 1811, and continued to exist up to 1820. The 'Wigwam' was in the second story of a building which stood on the corner of Main and Broadway. The sons of St. Tammany often 12 paraded through the streets disguised as Indians, and magnificent in red paint, feathers, bows, tomahawks, and war clubs. It was one of the most noted Democratic organizations in the West. Thomas T. Barr, Richard Chinn, and others successively filled the office of 'Sachem.' We give verbatim one of the Society's orders, viz.:\n\nSt. Tammany's Day.—The Sons of St. Tammany, or Brethren of the Columbian Order, will assemble at the council fire of their great wigwam on Tuesday, the 12th of the month of Flowers, at the rising of the sun, to celebrate the anniversary of their patron saint.\n\nA dinner will be provided at Bro. John Fowler's garden, to which the brethren will march in procession, where a long talk will be delivered by one of the order.\n\nAn adjourned meeting of the Society will be held on tomorrow evening, at the going down of the sun. By order of the Grand Sachem.\n\nN. S. Porter, Sec.\n\n8th of the month of Flowers, 1Year of Discovery, 326.\"\n\nDuring the second war with Great Britain, Fort Mifflin, on the Delaware River, near Philadelphia, was garrisoned for a time by a military company composed of the sons of the leading citizens of Philadelphia. At Fort Mifflin, and among these volunteers originated the \"Society of Red Men,\" about the year 1813. Their motto was \"Freedom and Friendship,\" and they were a natural outgrowth from and sequence to the St. Tammany Societies.\n\nThe records of the Society of Red Men are abundant and the Great Council of the United States in its Official History of the Order traces its growth and decline in detail as well as its customs and ceremonies. It flourished until about the year 1828, when it began to decline, and in 1832 was about extinct. The elements of conviviality, which seems to have been inseparable from all fraternal organizations of that period, finally produced such a degeneration in the Society as to disgust the better element, and cause the reorganization in its present form, and the incorporation of the word \"Improved\" in its title.\n\n13\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nTHE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE IMPROVED ORDER OF RED MEN (1833-1847).\n\nIn a pamphlet prepared by Bro. John F. Weishampel, Sr., containing a long talk delivered by him on Saint Tammany's Day, May 12, 1837, in the city of Baltimore, Md., he says:\n\n\"For some length of time prior to organizing the present Improved Order of Red Men, there existed in Baltimore, Md., a lodge, or society, called Red Men. They had their wigwam, or place of meeting, in the garret of a tavern. They met once a week, paid their dues, and initiated new members if any were on hand. After the business was over, the rest of the evening was spent in singing, telling yarns, making speeches, and convivial enjoyment, in which the decanter largely figured. The object of the society appeared to be only convivial entertainment. Several gentlemen who had been induced to join the lodge, but who did not favor such a course, withdrew as soon as they discovered the nature and object of the society, and it soon afterwards broke up.\"\n\nAmong those who had become members of the Red Men, though ignorant of its pernicious customs, were Geo. A. Peter and William T. Jones, as well as a number whose names it is unnecessary to record, yet admiring the beauties of its aboriginal ceremonies, determined to revive the society upon a basis of sobriety, virtue and mutual assistance in time of need.\n\nSeveral preliminary meetings were held, at which plans, rules and regulations for its government were discussed and adopted, and the Tribe was duly organized under the title of Logan Tribe, No. 1, Order of Improved Red Men, having for their motto, \"FREEDOM, FRIENDSHIP AND CHARITY.\"\n\nThe presiding chief was styled the Sachem, and the others graded as Sagamores, Prophet, Chief of Records, Keeper of Wampum, Guards of the Forest and Wigwam, Sanaps, Warriors and Braves. They also later prefixed the word \"Worthy\" to the titles of the chiefs.\n\nDates were computed according to the Jewish method, using the year of the world, or, as it was called, the \"Grand Sun of the world.\" 14 A year was a \"grand sun,\" and continued to be so styled until 1868, when it was changed to \"great sun.\"\n\nA calendar or table of nomenclature was established, practically the same as that now in use. The chiefs of the Tribes were elected every three moons, which continued to be the custom for many \"grand suns.\"\n\nAfter Logan Tribe had been in existence for about one great sun, and there had also been instituted Metamora Tribe, No. 2, it was deemed advisable to apply to the Maryland Legislature for a charter, so that the Tribe could be recognized as an important body. Brother John F. Weishampel, Sr., was appointed to draw up the petition, and in so doing prepared the papers in the name of the \"Improved Order of Red Men,\" thus transposing the original title, \"Order of Improved Red Men.\" None of members seemed to notice the alteration in the name and it therefore remained so.\n\nSoon after the organization of Metamora Tribe, No. 2, it was deemed best to form a higher body, and therefore on the 20th sun of Flower Moon, G. S. 5595, the Grand Council of Maryland was organized.\n\nPocahontas Tribe, No. 3, was instituted three great suns later, and the Order was now firmly established and seemed on the high road to success and prosperity.\n\nIn September, 1841, a new Tribe was instituted under the name of Metamora Tribe, No. 4, the old Tribe, Metamora, No. 2, having forfeited its charter and become defunct. Metamora, No. 4, did not last long for a difficulty arose between the Tribe and the Great Council of Maryland, and the membership withdrew and formed the nucleus of the organization known as the Independent Order of Red Men, composed entirely of Germans.\n\nSeveral additional Tribes were established by the Great Council of Maryland, and on November 4, 1845, there having previously been established three Tribes in the District of Columbia, the Great Council of Maryland granted a charter to the Great Council of the District of Columbia, and it was established on that day.\n\nFrom this time on the Order spread, until there were Tribes in several Reservations, and on the 1st sleep of the 5th seven suns of Cold Moon, 5607, which in the common era corresponds to Monday, January 30, 1847, was instituted and organized the Great Council of the United States, which was and is recognized as the Supreme Body of the Improved Order of Red Men. 15\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nTHE ESTABLISHMENT OF REDMANSHIP IN KENTUCKY BY THE GREAT COUNCIL OF THE UNITED STATES, 1852.\n\nWe have but the briefest record of the introduction of Redmanship into the Reservation of Kentucky.\n\nWorthy Great Incohonee Wm. Tucker, in his long talk to the Great Council of the United States in 5613 (1852), referred to the organization of Chickasaw Tribe, No. 1, of Newport, Kentucky, and Black Hawk Tribe, No. 2, of Covington. The date of the introduction of the Order into Kentucky was the 29th of Hot Moon, G. S. 5612, (June 29, 1852). The first Prophet of Black Hawk Tribe, No. 2, was A. J. Francis, afterwards sixteenth Great Incohonee of the G. C. U. S.\n\nThere were also established the following Tribes, though we have no record of the exact date of their institution:\n\nPocahontas Tribe, No. 3, of Newport, G. S. 5613.\n\nKentucky, No. 4, of Louisville, G. S. 5614. 16\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nTHE GREAT COUNCIL OF KENTUCKY, 1854-1884.\n\nPursuant to a notice given, the Past Sachems of Chicasaw Tribe, No. 1, of Newport, Blackhawk Tribe, No. 2, of Covington, and Pocahontas Tribe, No. 3, of Newport, of the Improved Order of Red Men, assembled in Newport on the 9th of Sturgeon Moon, G. S. 5614, for the purpose of organizing a Great Council in the Reservation of Kentucky.\n\nThe following named Past Sachems were present:\n\nFrom Chicasaw Tribe, No. 1—Geo. W. Ford, P. A. C. Kemper, J. H. Barlow, G. D. Allen, Wm. Ostler, D. H. B. Coffin and C. J. Murdock.\n\nFrom Black Hawk Tribe, No. 2—V. Schinkle, E. Reese, Uriah Schinkle, and A. J. Francis.\n\nFrom Pocahontas Tribe, No. 3—Geo. W. Schmidt.\n\nIt is worthy of note that of the foregoing, 2Geo. W. Ford afterwards became the 9th Great Incohonee of the Great Council of the United States, and 3A. J. Francis the 16th.\n\nThe Great Council Fire was kindled in due form by the Worthy Great Incohonee George A. Peter, and the following named chiefs were elected or appointed and raised up:\n\nGeorge W. Ford Most Worthy Great Sachem E. Reese Most Worthy Great Senior Sagamore Uriah Schinkle Most Worthy Great Junior Sagamore P. A. C. Kemper Most Worthy Great Prophet A. J. Francis Most Worthy Great Chief of Records V. Schinkle Most Worthy Great Keeper of Wampum17 D. H. B. Coffin Great Sannap Wm. Ostler Great Guard of Wigwam G. W. Schmidt Great Guard of Forest\n\nIt was ordered that Kentucky Tribe, No. 4, be notified of the institution of this Great Council and that it is now under its jurisdiction.\n\nKentucky Tribe was located in Louisville and it is probable that it did not join in the call for the institution of the Great Council.\n\nIt was agreed that the annual sessions of the Great Council be held in the hunting grounds of Newport, and the quarterly sessions in such place as a majority of the members present may determine from time to time.\n\nVarious committees were appointed, including one on Constitution and Laws, and the council fire was quenched, to be rekindled on the 19th sleep of Sturgeon Moon, on which date the Great Council met pursuant to adjournment, and the council fire was kindled with due solemnity.\n\nNo important business was transacted at this council other than the adoption of a code of Rules and By-Laws, and the council fire was quenched to be rekindled on the 26th sleep of Sturgeon Moon.\n\nAt this adjourned council Representatives to the Great Council of the United States were elected as follows: E. Reese, G. W. Ford, and U. Schinkle, and the council fire was quenched to be rekindled on the 2nd sleep of Traveling Moon, but did not meet until the 16th sun, when the council fire was kindled and routine business transacted.\n\nAt this session it was ordered that all Tribes in the jurisdiction be requested to surrender the charters they had received from the G. C. U. S., and apply to the Great Council of Kentucky for charters.\n\nThe next session was held in Covington, on the 15th of Cold Moon, 5615, when several Past Sachems presented credentials and were admitted.\n\nA petition was received from pale faces residing in Alexandria praying for the institution of Choctaw Tribe, No. 5, in those hunting grounds, and a dispensation was granted to kindle the council fire.\n\nThe next session was held in the hunting grounds of Louisville, on the 16th sun of Plant Moon, 5615.\n\nWorthy Great Sachem Geo. W. Ford stated that he had been appointed Vice Great Incohonee for the Southern States, and was soon to visit New Orleans for the purpose of instituting a Tribe there. 18\n\nIt was decided that a Brother elected Prophet of a Tribe at its institution was entitled to the honors of a Past Sachem without passing through the chairs.\n\nThe council fire was then quenched in due form.\n\n1855.\n\nSECOND GRAND SUN COUNCIL.\n\nThe Great Council fire was kindled in ample form at Newport on the 16th sun of Buck Moon, G. S. 5615.\n\nPast Sachems and representatives were admitted from Chickasaw Tribe, No. 1; Black Hawk Tribe, No. 2; Pocahontas Tribe, No. 3; Kentucky Tribe, No. 4; Choctaw Tribe, No. 5, and Tecumseh Tribe, No. 6, of Louisville. The records fail to show the date of the institution of this Tribe, but it must have been during the Great Sun 5614-5615, and was authorized to work in the German language.\n\nGreat Chiefs for the ensuing Great Sun were elected and raised up as follows:\n\nElias Reese, of No. 2 Worthy Great Sachem S. I. B Badgley, of No. 4 Worthy Great Senior Sagamore Chas. Amann, of No. 3 Worthy Great Junior Sagamore J. B. Monder, of No. 1 Worthy Great Prophet A. J. Francis, of No. 2 Worthy Great Chief of Records V. Schinkle, of No. 2 Worthy Great Keeper of Wampum G. W. Ford, Great Representative to G. C. U. S. for two great suns Bros. Brown and Coffin, for one great sun each.\n\nGreat Sachem Geo. W. Ford read the first long talk, an able and comprehensive document. He said: \"The Grand Sun just past is the first of this Great Body. It has been one of great trial. The Great Manitou's face has been under a cloud, our corn patches have been barren and our vines brought forth no fruit; yet has not the faith of the Red Man faltered. The cloud is being lifted, our hearts are made glad, the corn and vine promise much, our squaws and pappooses shall not go hungry, and the wampum belt shall again be full. During the past Grand Sun two more Tribes have been added to our number—Choctaw Tribe, No. 5, at Alexandria, and Tecumseh Tribe, No. 6, at Louisville. In the absence of written law I have been governed by this alone, our motto, \"Freedom, Friendship, and Charity. Freedom of thought in discussion; Friendship in our intercourse with the brotherhood, and 19 Charity towards our brothers' faults, frailties and the foibles of human nature.\" Speaking as he was to Past Sachems only, the following was not only timely then, but is still pertinent and should be heeded: \"We would earnestly recommend that you attend regularly the councils of your respective Tribes, for to you it is natural to look for countenance and advice. It is a too common failing that when a brother has attained the highest post of honor for him to become remiss in his duties to his Tribe, for it is his duty to attend the kindling of his council fire upon every occasion, when health and private duties permit. It is essentially the province of all past officers to guide their respective Tribes in the right path, that they go not astray and follow the path of the evil spirit. Let this advice sink deeply into your hearts and penetrate fruitfully your understanding.\"\n\nThe following was adopted:\n\n\"Resolved: That this Great Council instruct its Representatives to the G. C. U. S. to call the attention of that body to the subject of establishing a chief's degree to be conferred upon the squaws of Red Men.\"\n\nThe Great Council fire was quenched, to be rekindled in the hunting grounds of Alexandria, on the 15th sun of Traveling Moon, G. S. 5616.\n\nOn the above date the council fire was rekindled. Since the quenching of the last council fire the Great Council of the United States had convened, and Past Great Sachem Geo. W. Ford had been elected Great Incohonee of that body, and he presided at this session of the Great Council of Kentucky.\n\nSeveral Past Sachems presented credentials and were admitted, routine business was transacted and the council fire was quenched, to be rekindled in the hunting grounds of Covington, on the 21st sun of Cold Moon, G. S. 5616, on which date the Great Council reconvened, but transacted no important business other than a resolution to fine all Great Chiefs for non-attendance, and the council fire was quenched, to be rekindled in the hunting grounds of Louisville, on the 14th sun of Plant Moon, 5616.\n\nAt this adjourned session much business of only local interest, however, was transacted.\n\nA resolution was adopted to kindle the Great Council fire semi-annually instead of quarterly, once in Louisville and once in Newport or Covington.\n\nThe council fire was then quenched. 20\n\n1856.\n\nTHIRD GREAT SUN COUNCIL.\n\nThe council fire was kindled with due solemnities in the hunting grounds of Newport, on the 21st sun of Buck Moon, G. S. 5616.\n\nRepresentatives were present from Chickasaw Tribe, No. 1; Black Hawk Tribe, No. 2; Pocahontas Tribe, No. 3, and Tecumseh Tribe, No. 6.\n\nGreat Sachem Elias Reese presented his long talk, regretting that he had not been able to institute any new Tribes, but reported the Order in a very healthy condition.\n\nThe election of Great Chiefs for the Grand Sun ensuing resulted as follows:\n\nA. J. Francis M. W. Great Sachem John Hughes M. W. Great Senior Sagamore John Amann M. W. Great Junior Sagamore Wm. Schmidt M. W. Great Prophet Peter Ruhl M. W. Great Chief of Records Vincent Schinkle M. W. Keeper of Wampum Elias Reese Great Representative to G. C. U. S.\n\nThe finance committee reported total receipts for the Grand Sun, $374.40; expenses, $324.50; balance in the wampum belt, $49.90.\n\nNo business was transacted at this session worthy of being recorded on these pages, and after the Past Great Sachem had instructed the brethren in the secret work the Great Council fire was quenched, to be rekindled in the hunting grounds of Louisville, on the 13th sun of Cold Moon, G. S. 5617.\n\nOn the above date the Great Council reconvened, and representatives were admitted from Kentucky Tribe, No. 4; Tecumseh, No. 6, and Delaware, No. 7.\n\nThe Great Sachem reported that he had granted a dispensation for a new Tribe at Louisville, to be known as Delaware Tribe, No. 7, and that its first council fire had been kindled on the 2nd sun, Traveling Moon, G. S. 5617.\n\nReports were received in correct form from all Tribes except Chickasaw Tribe, No. 1, and Choctaw, No. 5, and as no further mention is made of No. 5 in subsequent records, it is probable that it was at this time defunct.\n\nPast Great Sachem Elias Reese, Great Representative to G. C. U. S., made a lengthy report, stating at that time there were nine States having Great Councils, viz.: Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, District of Columbia, New Jersey, Ohio, Kentucky, Delaware, 21 and New York, and that hereafter the Great Council of the United States would be a representative body, exclusively. He also reported that P. G. I. Geo. W. Ford had been appointed Vice Great Incohonee for Louisiana, Tennessee and Texas.\n\nA committee was appointed to have the Great Council of Kentucky incorporated.\n\nThe council fire was then quenched.\n\n1857.\n\nFOURTH GRAND SUN COUNCIL.\n\nThe council fire was kindled in the wigwam of Black Hawk Tribe, No. 2, Covington, on the 13th of Buck Moon, G. S. 5617.\n\nRepresentatives were admitted from Tribes Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7.\n\nThe long talks of the Great Chiefs were not copied in the proceedings, therefore no excerpts can be made from them.\n\nA committee of three was appointed to draft a constitution for the government of Tribes under the jurisdiction of this Great Council. Previous to this time each Tribe had prepared its own constitution as well as by-laws, subject, however, to approval by the Great Council.\n\nChiefs for the ensuing Grand Sun were elected and raised up as follows:\n\nJohn Hughes M. W. Great Sachem Gregory B. Kiteley M. W. Great Senior Sagamore John B. Davies M. W. Great Junior Sagamore W. D. Turner M. W. Great Prophet Peter Ruhl M. W. Great Chief of Records A. J. Francis M. W. Great Keeper of Wampum A. J. Francis Representative to G. C. U. S.\n\nAfter transacting the usual routine business, the council fire was quenched, to be rekindled in the wigwam of Kentucky Tribe, No. 4, hunting grounds of Louisville, on the 11th of Cold Moon, G. S. 5618.\n\nThe Great Council reconvened, pursuant to adjournment, with all Great Chiefs present.\n\nRepresentatives were admitted from Tribes Nos. 2, 4, 6 and 7.\n\nNo business was transacted other than the payment of current bills and acting upon a new code of by-laws for the Great Council, and the council fire was quenched in due form. 22\n\n1858.\n\nFIFTH GRAND SUN COUNCIL.\n\nThe council fire was kindled in the hunting grounds of Newport, on the 12th of Buck Moon, G. S. 5618, all Great Chiefs being present.\n\nRepresentatives were present from Tribes Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 6.\n\nPast Sachems were present from Kentucky Tribe, No. 4, and Delaware, No. 7, but without credentials as representatives, and they were refused admission, whereupon they gave notice of an appeal to the G. C. U. S.\n\nGreat Sachem John Hughes, in his long talk, stated that the Order was in good condition and that efforts were being made to establish Tribes in Frankfort and Lexington. He complimented the Louisville brethren for their zeal. Among his rulings was one that a paleface being admitted under lawful age, by mistake, should remain a member of the Tribe which had adopted him.\n\nReports of the G. C. of R. and G. K. of W. showed the Great Council to be in debt to the Great Keeper of Wampum for 7 fathoms 1 foot and 9 inches.\n\nThe election for Great Chiefs for the ensuing Grand Sun resulted as follows:\n\nJohn B. Davies M. W. Great Sachem A. C. Harig M. W. Great Senior Sagamore Jacob Schenk M. W. Great Junior Sagamore C. Rice M. W. Great Prophet Jas. N. Tyrack M. W. Great Chief of Records A. J. Francis M. W. Great Keeper of Wampum\n\nBros. Ruhl, Harig and Tyrack were elected Great Representatives to the G. C. U. S., and were instructed that if they desired to attend that Grand Body at their own expense they would be furnished with credentials.\n\nAfter passing an order to borrow 50 fathoms from Tecumseh Tribe, No. 6, the Great Council fire was quenched, to be rekindled in the hunting grounds of Louisville, on the 12th of Cold Moon, G. S. 5619.\n\nAt the semi-grand sun session, Great Sachem John B. Davies was not present, owing to afflictions in his family, and Past Great Sachem A. J. Francis occupied his stump.\n\nRepresentatives were present from Tribes Nos. 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7.\n\nIt was announced that Chickasaw Tribe, No. 1, of Newport, had become defunct and its members were desirous of uniting with some other Tribe, taking with them the property of former Chickasaw 23 Tribe in lieu of admission fee, and requested of the Great Council permission so to do. Acting Great Sachem ruled the request out of order, on the ground that the property of defunct Chickasaw Tribe did not belong to the members, but to the Great Council.\n\nIt was ordered that no Tribe shall be entitled to the pass-word, nor shall its chiefs be raised up until its reports and percentage have been placed in the hands of its Deputy Great Sachem.\n\nThe constitution was amended so as to provide for annual sessions only, to alternate between the cities of Louisville and Covington.\n\nAfter levying an assessment of ten fathoms upon each Tribe under its jurisdiction, the council fire was quenched.\n\n1859.\n\nSIXTH GRAND SUN COUNCIL.\n\nThe Grand Sun Council fire was kindled in the wigwam of Black Hawk Tribe, No. 2, hunting grounds of Covington, on the 11th of Buck Moon, G. S. 5619, Great Sachem John B. Davies presiding.\n\nRepresentatives were admitted from Tribes Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 6.\n\nThe Great Sachem, in a very brief talk, reported that Black Hawk, Pocahontas, Kentucky, Tecumseh, and Delaware Tribes were in a nourishing condition, a spirit of emulation pervading their wigwams.\n\nGreat Chief of Records J. N. Tyrack presented a very complete report, from which the following is gleaned: Amount in Great Council wampum belt, 142 fathoms; number of working Tribes, 6; members in good standing, 267; withdrawn by card, 9; adopted, 52; admitted by card, 3; rejected, 3; expulsions and suspensions, 40; deaths, 3; widows and orphans, 14; amount paid for relief of brothers, $258.50; for relief of widows and orphans, $53.75.\n\nElection for Great Chiefs resulted as follows:\n\nA. C. Herig M. W. Great Sachem Jacob Schenk M. W. Great Senior Sagamore W. H. Patton M. W. Great Junior Sagamore John B. Haltimus M. W. Great Prophet Jas. N. Tyrack M. W. Great Chief of Records A. J. Francis M. W. Great Keeper of Wampum Bros. Tyrack, Davis and Herig Representatives to G. C. U. S.\n\nTrustees—Bros. Kiteley, Davis and Haltimus.\n\n24\n\nA constitution for the government of all Tribes in this reservation was adopted.\n\nThe Great Keeper of Wampum reported that all bills and claims had been paid and that there was a balance in the wampum belt of 18 inches.\n\nThe council fire was then quenched with due solemnity.\n\n1860.\n\nSEVENTH GRAND SUN COUNCIL.\n\nThe Most Worthy Great Council of Kentucky kindled its seventh Grand Sun Council fire in the wigwam of Delaware Tribe, No. 7, hunting ground of Louisville, on the 9th sun of Buck Moon, G. S. 5620, Great Sachem A. C. Herig on his stump.\n\nRepresentatives were admitted from Black Hawk Tribe, No. 2; Pocahontas, No. 3; Kentucky, No. 4; Tecumseh, No. 6, and Delaware, No. 7.\n\nThe Great Sachem's long talk reviewed the progress of the Order for the Grand Sun. He regretted that he had been unable to institute any new Tribes, and called the attention of the Great Council to the fact that there were in the possession of the Great Chief of Records the effects of defunct Tribes Chickasaw, No. 1, and Choctaw, No. 5, and urged that some action be taken to dispose of the same.\n\nThe election resulted as follows:\n\nChas. Amann M. W. Great Sachem C. Rice M. W. Great Senior Sagamore John B. Haltimus M. W. Great Junior Sagamore Richard W. Elsey M. W. Great Prophet Jas. N. Tyrack M. W. Great Chief of Records W. D. Turner M. W. Great Keeper of Wampum\n\nJohn Hughes, Chas. Amann, and Martin Borntraeger, Great Representatives to G. C. U.

Kiteley, Fresher and Strube were elected Great Trustees.\n\nThe council fire was then quenched. 25\n\nBro. Jas. N. Tyrack, Great Chief of Records, having resigned his chieftaincy, a special council was called to meet in the wigwam of Pocahontas Tribe, No. 3, at Newport, on the 18th of Worm Moon, G.

S. 5621, M. W. Great Sachem Chas. Amann presiding.\n\nPast Sachems from Tribes Nos. 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 were in attendance.\n\nIn his long talk the Great Sachem said: \"As all earthly joys are tinged with sorrow, these hunting grounds of our fathers are now clamorous with the wild and frantic war whoop. The pleasure of this meeting is alloyed with pain. Oh, how different is the scene presented from that of one Grand Sun ago. Everything then was bright and prosperous, and bid fair to be the golden harvest of ages. The fruits of the earth were abundant and our forest replete with game. * * * I cannot report that all the Tribes in this jurisdiction are in healthy condition, or that the most friendly relations exist around their council fires. There have been some grievances and misunderstandings between Tribes and our former Great Chief of Records which caused that Great Chief to resign. I visited all Tribes during my chieftaincy.\"\n\nThe Great Chief of Records, B. Strobe, reported as follows: Amount in wampum belt, 138 fathoms; number of working Tribes, 5; adoptions, 9; suspensions, 15; expulsions, 3; withdrawn by card, 4; admitted by card, 2; deceased, 4; number of members, 303; paid for relief of brothers, $341; for widows and orphans, $89.\n\nThe election for Great Chiefs resulted as follows:\n\nW.

Francis M. W. Great Keeper of Wampum\n\n26\n\nA. J. Francis, E. Merkley and St. A. Gray, Representatives to G. C. U. S.\n\nJ. B. Heltimus, Chas. Hebel and Bro. Weichert, Trustees.\n\nThe Great Council passed upon several appeal cases, ordered current bills paid, and the council fire was quenched.\n\n1862.\n\nNINTH GRAND SUN COUNCIL.\n\nThe council fire was kindled in the wigwam of Kentucky Tribe. No. 4, hunting grounds of Louisville, at the 9th run, rising of the 14th sun of Buck Moon, G. S. 5633, with Great Sachem W. D. Turner on his stump.\n\nPast Sachems were admitted from Black Hawk Tribe, No. 2; Kentucky, No. 4; Tecumseh, No. 6, and Delaware, No. 7.\n\nThe following extract from the Great Sachem's long talk reveals the condition of the Order at this time: \"The events of the past year, so fatal to the political and financial prosperity of the country, has not been without its influence upon the prosperity of our Order. It has prevented a great number of our chiefs from attending the meetings of this Great Council, also from attending their respective Tribes. * * * It is, however, our duty by all means in our power, to make every exertion to maintain the Order and to keep constantly in view of our respective Tribes the beautiful motto of our Order, and the necessity of being united.\"\n\nThe following is from the report of the Great Chief of Records:\n\nNumber of working Tribes, 5; members, 259; deceased, 3; rejected, 1; suspended, 23; expulsions, 2: withdrawn by card, 3; paid for relief of brothers, $227.50; paid for relief of widows and orphans, $99.00.\n\nThe Great Keeper of Wampum reported 86 fathoms in the wampum belt.\n\nThe election resulted as follows:\n\nGregory B.

Francis M. W. Great Keeper of Wampum\n\nE. Reese, M. Borntraeger, and R. McCracken, Representatives to G. C. U. S. 27\n\nBros. Turner, Frische and Clark, Trustees.\n\nAfter passing bills and a resolution not to pay mileage for the ensuing two Grand Suns, the council fire was quenched.\n\n1863.\n\nTENTH GRAND SUN COUNCIL.\n\nThe Great Council assembled and the council fire was kindled in the wigwam of Black Hawk Tribe, No. 2, hunting grounds of Covington, on the 17th sun of Sturgeon Moon, G. S. 5623, Great Sachem G. B. Kiteley presiding.\n\nPast Sachems were admitted from Tribes Nos. 2, 4 and 6.\n\nThe Great Sachem said: \"I am sorry that we were not able to meet at the appointed time, according to law, but owing to the declaring of martial law in Louisville, and the stoppage of all travel, it was utterly impossible for the brothers from any of the Tribes in Louisville to come here; hence the necessity of postponing the meeting until the present time. I instituted in Kentucky and Delaware Tribes a degree council, and would suggest the propriety of its being done by all the Tribes, as by so doing the brothers will get to know the unwritten work of the Order much better than they do at present. It affords me much pleasure to state that the Tribes are in much more flourishing condition than they have been for some time past.\"\n\nThe Great Chief of Records reported:\n\nNumber of working Tribes, 5; adoptions, 21; rejections, 1; suspensions, 22; expulsions, 1; admitted by card, 3; deceased, 3; whole number of members, 245; paid for relief of brothers, $158; for relief of widows and orphans, $61.25.\n\nPast Great Sachem A.

S. 28\n\nPast Great Incohonee Geo. S. Peters and the Great Chiefs of the Great Council of Ohio being present, they were invited to raise up the Great Chiefs-elect, which they did.\n\nAfter routine business the Great Council fire was quenched.\n\n1864.\n\nELEVENTH GRAND SUN COUNCIL.\n\nThe eleventh Grand Sun Council of the Right Worthy Great Council of Kentucky, Imp'd O.

S. 5624, Great Sachem Borntraeger presiding, and all the elective Great Chiefs being present.\n\nPast Sachems were admitted from Tribes Nos. 4, 6 and 7.\n\nThe Great Sachem said: \"Though it has not been our good fortune to add another to the number of Tribes already established in this State, I am happy to state that the initiations in some of the Tribes have been right numerous, and the receipts of wampum quite large. I hope that the bloody strife now raging in this our beautiful land may soon be ended and that the Great Spirit may spare you all for many a meeting of this Great Council.\"\n\nThe following is gleaned from the report of the Great Chief of Records:\n\nNumber of working Tribes, 5; initiations, 33; rejections, 7; suspensions, 11; expulsions, 1; withdrawn by card, 3; deceased, 4; whole number of members, 260; paid for relief of brothers, 499 fathoms; for widows and orphans, 132 fathoms; amount in the Great Council wampum belt, $220.66.\n\nThe election of Chiefs resulted as follows:\n\nB.

S.\n\nA communication was received from the Great Council of the United States warning the Great Council not to print odes, diplomas, cards, or other supplies, in violation of the laws of the Great Council of the United States. 29\n\nThe Great Council at this session liquidated its debt to Black Hawk Tribe, No. 2.\n\nAfter passing a resolution instructing the Great Representatives to invite the Great Council of the United States to kindle its next Great Sun Council fire in the hunting grounds of Louisville, the council fire was quenched with due solemnity.\n\n1865.\n\nTWELFTH GRAND SUN COUNCIL.\n\nThe twelfth Grand Sun Council fire of the Right Worthy Great Council of Kentucky, Improved Order of Red Men, was kindled in the wigwam of Pocahontas Tribe, No. 3, in the hunting grounds of Newport, on the 10th sun of Buck Moon, G.

Francis Worthy Great Keeper of Wampum\n\nA. J. Francis, R. B. McCracken and A. Reese, Great Representatives to G. C. U. S. 30\n\nNotice was received from the Great Council of the United States of the proposed change in the mode of dating, to substitute Grand Sun of Discovery, 1492, as the base, computing from that date as G. S. D. 1, instead of the Jewish method then in use, and the Great Representatives were instructed to vote against the proposed change.\n\nThe Great Chief of Records was instructed to devise and have printed a new form of Tribal Reports.\n\nIn secret session, Past Great Incohonee A.

D. 375, Great Sachem Jacob Schenk presiding, and all the elective Great Chiefs present.\n\nPast Sachems were admitted from Tribes Nos. 4, 6 and 7.\n\nThe Great Sachem in his admirable long talk said: \"The mingling together of the honored brothers of the Order, the kind interchange of opinions upon the various topics introduced for consideration, the animated yet decorous discussion of various subjects, indicate too plainly for any doubt that our beloved Order is not only firmly established, but that a strong desire exists, not only to keep it in its present position, but if possible to advance it to one yet more deserving of respect. The law now is that no Tribe is entitled to the semi-annual pass-word, nor their chiefs-elect to installation until their reports are placed in the hands of the D. G. S. or the Great Chief of Records. I have been instructed by the Great Council of the United States of the change in the mode of dating, from Grand Sun 5626 to Grand Sun of Discovery 375. Also the law of representations in the G. C. U. S. has been changed as follows: State Great Councils shall have two Representatives for 500 members or less, and one for every additional 500 31 or fraction exceeding 300, who are to serve for two years, but at the first election one-half of the number are to be elected for one year, so that their terms expire alternately.

On the 15th sun of Sturgeon Moon I received a petition from a number of palefaces residing in Lexington asking for a dispensation to establish a Tribe in that city, and on the 29th of the same moon I visited Lexington in company with Past Great Sachem Chas. Amann, Past Great Incohonee A. J. Francis, and Great Sachem Chas. Reed, of Ohio, and established Osceola Tribe, No. 8. The following Chiefs were elected and raised up: James Crystal, Sachem; Thos. A. Hornsey, Sr. Sag.; B. P. Watkins, Jr. Sag.; A. W. Trebien, C. of R.; V. N. Gardner, K. of W.; D. A. King, Prophet.\n\nOn the 25th of Traveling Moon I received a petition from a number of Past Sachems and a few other brothers for a dispensation to establish a new Tribe in the city of Louisville, to be known as Seneca Tribe, No. 9. I requested Past Great Sachem Chas. Amann to institute the Tribe, which he did, and installed the following chiefs: P. S. Conrad Koch, Sachem; P. S. Christ Mayflor, Sr. Sag.; P. S. Jacob Lezinski, Jr. Sag.; P. S. Tebel, C. of R.; P. S. Ph. Leonhard, K. of W.; P. S.

C. Herig was announced and appropriate resolutions of respect were adopted. 33\n\nToronto Degree Council, No. 1, of Louisville, having outlived its usefulness, surrendered its dispensation to the Great Council and ceased to exist.\n\nCharters were granted to Osceola Tribe, No. 8, and Seneca Tribe, No. 9.\n\nThe council fire was then quenched.\n\n1868.\n\nFIFTEENTH GREAT SUN COUNCIL.\n\nThe fifteenth Great Sun Council fire of the Great Council of Kentucky was kindled in the wigwam of Osceola Tribe, No. 8, hunting grounds of Lexington, at the first run, setting of the 27th sun of Buck Moon, G.

The Tribe was instituted on the 19th sun of Flower Moon, G. S. D. 377, and I would recommend that a charter be granted. On the 16th sun of Hunting Moon I received notice of the death of our beloved Past Great Sachem R. B. McCracken. He died on the 29th of Beaver Moon. The Great Spirit has taken him to his better forest and the Great Council has lost a good member. I would recommend that a certain fund be placed at the disposal of the Great Sachem so that he may be enabled to travel, visit Tribes and attend properly to the business of the Order.\"\n\nThe Great Chief of Records reported as follows: Number of Tribes, 8; members, 402; adopted, 64; rejected, 4; suspended, 13; expelled, 6; reinstated, 3; admitted by card, 2; withdrawn by card, 11; deceased, 5; Past Great Sachems, 12; Past Sachems, 114; Tribes instituted past great sun, 1.\n\nA charter was granted Minnehaha Tribe, No. 10.\n\nSuitable resolutions were adopted on the death of Past Great Sachem R.

Francis Great Keeper of Wampum\n\nGreat Representative to G. C. U. S.—Chas.

S. D. 378, Great Sachem Thomas W. Giedeon and Great Chief of Records Chas. Hebel being the only Great Chiefs present.\n\nRepresentatives were admitted from Tribes Nos. 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10.\n\nThe Great Sachem said: \"During the past great sun I have granted dispensations to open two new Tribes. One in Bowling Green, hailing as Oswego Tribe, No. 11, on the 12th sun, Traveling Moon, G. S. D. 377. Past Great Sachems G. B. Kiteley and W. D. Turner, of Louisville, instituted the Tribe, to whom I am under many obligations for their kind services; also to Past Sachem Lezinski, Bro. Thos. Carnet, of Bowling Green, and Deputy Great Incohonee of Tennessee, in opening Matamora Tribe, No. 12, at Hopkinsville, on the 19th sun of Cold Moon, G. S. D. 378, and I now ask that charters be granted to them.\" The Great Sachem also made many valuable recommendations to the Great Council.\n\nThe Great Chief of Records reported: \"Number of Tribes, 10; members, 548; adoptions, 139; rejections, 4; suspensions, 34; admitted by card, 3; withdrawn, 7; deceased, 4; Past Great Sachems, 9; Tribes instituted, 2.\n\nFor the first time bonds were required of the Great Chief of Records and the Great Keeper of Wampum.\n\nThe finance committee reported $356.74 in the hands of G. K. 35 of W. A. J. Francis, and $165.86 in the hands of G. C. of R. Charles Hebel.\"\n\nThe election resulted as follows:\n\nEdmund Merkley Great Sachem Fred Braum Great Senior Sagamore D. A. King Great Junior Sagamore Geo. W. Reese Great Prophet G. B. Kiteley Great Chief of Records W. D. Turner Great Keeper of Wampum G. B. Kiteley Great Representative to G. C. U. S.\n\nTrustees—Thos. Giedeon, G. W. Reese and J. B. Davis, who were instructed to take steps to recover the wampum in the hands of former G. K. of W. A. J. Francis.\n\nThe council fire was then quenched in due form.\n\n1870.\n\nSEVENTEENTH GRAND SUN COUNCIL.\n\nThe Great Council fire was kindled in the wigwam of Pocahontas and Minnehaha Tribes, hunting grounds of Newport, on the 25th sun of Buck Moon, G. S. D. 379, Great Sachem Edmund Merkley presiding.\n\nRepresentatives were present from the following Tribes, which was probably the largest representation in the history of this Great Council: Blackhawk, No. 2, Covington; Pocahontas, No. 3, Newport; Kentucky, No. 4, Louisville; Tecumseh, No. 6, Louisville; Delaware, No. 7, Louisville; Osceola, No. 8, Lexington; Seneca, No. 9, Louisville; Minnehaha, No. 10, Newport; Oswego, No. 11, Bowling Green; Matamora, No. 12, Hopkinsville; and Hiawatha, No. 13, Covington.\n\nThe Great Sachem said: \"The Improved Order of Red Men has become one of the most important among the benevolent institutions of the age. I believe without exception the utmost harmony and brotherly feeling prevails throughout the entire jurisdiction. I have granted dispensations for two new Tribes—Hiawatha, No. 13, of Covington, instituted on the 12th sun of Sturgeon Moon, G. S. D. 378, and Cherokee Tribe, No. 14, at Paris, on the 8th sun of Hot Moon, G. S. D. 379, and I would ask that charters be granted to both Tribes.\"\n\nGreat Chief of Records C. S. Betts, of Ohio, was a visitor and was welcomed to a seat by the Great Sachem. 36\n\nA constitution governing Tribes under the jurisdiction of the G. C. was adopted, also uniform by-laws.\n\nThe election resulted as follows:\n\nJohn Steinhauer Great Sachem Geo. W. Reese Great Senior Sagamore Samuel Spaeth Great Junior Sagamore J. Lezinsky Great Prophet G. B. Kiteley Great Chief of Records W. D. Turner Great Keeper of Wampum Chas. Amann Great Representative to G. C. U. S.\n\nThe Great Chief of Records reported as follows: Number of Tribes, 12; members, 611; adopted, 171; rejected, 8; suspended, 24; expelled, 16; admitted by card, 6; withdrawn, 14; deceased, 3; new Tribes, 2; Past Great Sachems, 10; Past Sachems, 118.\n\nIt was decided that the first Prophet of a Tribe is entitled to the honors of a Past Sachem.\n\nIt was agreed that former Great Keeper of Wampum A. J. Francis be given until the 15th of Corn Moon to pay his indebtedness to this Great Council.\n\nThe Great Prophet, at the request of the Great Sachem, said a prayer and the council fire was quenched.\n\n1871.\n\nEIGHTEENTH GREAT SUN COUNCIL.\n\nThe Great Council of Kentucky assembled in the wigwam of Oswego Tribe, No. 11, at Bowling Green, on the 25th sun of Buck Moon, G. S. D. 380, and the council fire was kindled in ample form at the 9th run, Great Sachem John Steinhauer presiding.\n\nRepresentatives were present from Tribes Nos. 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13.\n\nFrom the Great Sachem's long talk: \"The Order of Improved Red Men, as far as I can judge, is progressing, notwithstanding the desertion of two Tribes in Louisville, namely, Tecumseh, No. 6, and Delaware, No. 7. On the 16th sun of Cold Moon I visited Tecumseh, and on the 17th of the same moon I visited Delaware, which Tribes afterwards deserted, and as I understand joined the Independent Order. I received a communication from Deputy Great Sachem Alex Knapp stating their reasons for doing so, but it does not prove that they acted like honest men. I sent a communication to the Great Incohonee of the United States asking how 37 to proceed, but I did not receive an answer. I now leave the matter in the hands of the Great Council of Kentucky. On the 8th sun of Flower Moon I granted a dispensation for a Tribe to be instituted at King's Lodge, Calloway County, under the title of Minneola Tribe, No. 15. I deputized John T. Irion, of West Tennessee, to institute, which he did on the 6th sun, Hot Moon, G. S. D. 380, and raised up the following chiefs: W. M. P. Pool, Sachem; H. B. Landon, Sr. Sagamore; W. H. Clarke, Jr. Sagamore; J. C. Shelton, Prophet; S. F. Kirkeley, C. of R.; T. A. Hughes, Asst. C. of R.; D. G. Reed, K. of W. I would recommend that a charter be granted them.\"\n\nThe Great Chief of Records reported as follows: Tribes, 11; members, 550; adopted, 145; rejected, 7; suspended, 28; expelled, 17; admitted by card, 18; withdrawn by card, 4; deceased, 9; new Tribes, 1; Past Great Sachems, 6; Past Sachems, 85.\n\nVarious amendments to the constitution were offered and laid over one great sun for action.\n\nElection resulted as follows:\n\nJacob Lezinski Great Sachem S. F. Schell Great Senior Sagamore D. A. King Great Junior Sagamore W. H. Glore Great Prophet G. B. Kiteley Great Chief of Records W. D. Turner Great Keeper of Wampum G. B. Kiteley Representative to G. C. U. S.\n\nThe committee on state of the Order recommended that legal action be taken to recover the effects of Tecumseh Tribe, No. 6, and Delaware Tribe, No. 7, of Louisville.\n\nThe Great Chief of Records read an application for a charter for a Tribe in Maysville, and a charter was granted.\n\nThe Great Council went into committee of the whole and decided to prosecute the two deserting Tribes to the full extent of the law.\n\nThe Francis case was brought up and Brothers Glore and Kannard were appointed to assist the trustees in effecting a settlement.\n\nThe Great Prophet, at the request of the Great Sachem, repeated a prayer and the Great Council fire was quenched.\n\n1872.\n\nNINETEENTH GREAT SUN COUNCIL.\n\nThe Great Council assembled in the wigwam of Kentucky and Seneca Tribes, hunting grounds of Louisville, and the council fire was kindled in ample form at the 9th run, rising of the 23d sun of 38 Buck Moon, G. S. D. 381, Great Sachem Jacob Lezinski presiding, all the elective Great Chiefs being present.\n\nRepresentatives were present from Tribes Nos. 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13 and 16.\n\nThe Great Sachem said: \"The Order in this jurisdiction is not making as rapid strides as it would if the beauties of it were more fully known. Some hunting grounds are extending their influence, while others are languishing for the want of some fraternal care. I most respectfully recommend to your earnest consideration the appointment of a suitable chief, one who has time and ability to visit all the Tribes in this reservation. It is impossible for any Great Chief without great pecuniary loss on his part to give that attention to the visiting of Tribes, which is almost absolutely necessary in what might be called the infancy of our Order in this jurisdiction. I am satisfied if this system of visiting was faithfully carried out it would increase our membership threefold and the Tribes in general gain by it. I appointed Bro. Kiteley a special deputy to institute Wyandotte Tribe, No. 16, at Maysville, which he did on the 10th of Sturgeon Moon, 380, and raised up the following chiefs: M. C. Russell, Sachem; E. A. Robinson, Sr. Sagamore; J. H. Hall, Jr. Sagamore; A. Brillstein, Prophet; Thomas A. Davis, C. of R.; A. B. Cochran, K. of W.\"\n\nThe Great Chief of Records reported that some mode should be adopted to compel Tribes to be more prompt in making their reports.\n\nThe death of Past Great Sachem Charles Amann was reported and suitable resolutions were passed.\n\nThe election resulted as follows:\n\nW. H. Glore Great Sachem John Vogle Great Senior Sagamore J. J. Hillburb Great Junior Sagamore Thos. A. Hornsey Great Prophet G. B. Kiteley Great Chief of Records W. D. Turner Great Keeper of Wampum Isaac Leiber Great Representative to G. C. U. S.\n\nAfter an exemplification of the secret work and a prayer by the Great Prophet the council fire was quenched.\n\n1873.\n\nTWENTIETH GREAT SUN COUNCIL.\n\nThe Great Council assembled in regular session in the wigwam of Hiawatha Tribe, No. 13, hunting grounds of Covington, on the 22nd sun of Buck Moon, G. S. D. 382, and the council fire was kindled in ample form at the 9th run, rising of the sun, Great 39 Sachem W. H. Glore presiding. All the elective Great Chiefs were present.\n\nRepresentatives were admitted from the following Tribes: Nos. 2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 11, 13 and 16.\n\nThe Great Sachem said: \"Our Order has not been as progressive for the past great sun as it might or ought to have been. We have not instituted a new Tribe, and the brothers have to a certain degree been very negligent, as well as myself, in the working and interest of the Order. I would suggest that some active brother be appointed by this Great Council, and make it his duty to visit every Tribe in the State at least once in every four moons, to build them up and give the secret work as laid down by the Great Council of the United States. At present Matamora Tribe, No. 12, at Hopkinsville, is suspended, and has been for some time back. I am sorry to say that Seneca Tribe, No. 9, at Louisville, has suspended.\"\n\nThe committee appointed at the lest session to wait upon A. J. Francis, late Great Keeper of Wampum, reported unable to make a settlement with him, and asked that another committee be appointed, which was done.\n\nResolved: That the Great Chief of Records be instructed to summons Brother A. J. Francis to appear before the Great Council at its next session, 1874, and show cause why he should not make proper settlement to this Great Council, or be expelled from all rights and privileges of the Great Council of Kentucky.\n\nThe election resulted as follows:\n\nThomas A. Hornsey Great Sachem C. H. Conn Great Senior Sagamore Thomas A. Davis Great Junior Sagamore E. H. Mottley Great Prophet G. B. Kiteley Great Chief of Records W. D. Turner Great Keeper of Wampum\n\nThe Great Chief of Records reported as follows: Number of Tribes, 8; members, 540; adoptions, 109; reinstated, 3; admitted by card, 1; withdrawn by card, 10; expelled, 7; rejected, 8; deceased, 5; Past Sachems, 94.\n\nThe council fire was then quenched.\n\n1874.\n\nTWENTY-FIRST GREAT SUN COUNCIL.\n\nThe Great Council of Kentucky assembled in regular session in the wigwam of Wyandotte Tribe, No. 16, on the 28th sun of Buck Moon, G. S. D. 383, and the council fire was kindled in due form, Great Sachem Thos. A. Hornsey presiding. 40\n\nRepresentatives were admitted from the following Tribes: Nos. 2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 13 and 16.\n\nThe Great Sachem said: \"Though we have been visited by pestilence since we last met together in council, we should return heartfelt thanks to the Great Spirit that so many of us are permitted to meet this sun around our council fire. I visited every Tribe in our reservation and I found them in good working condition, and my visitations have fully persuaded me that the frequent visits of the Great Sachem of the State to the various Tribes is of the very greatest importance. I deputized Great Prophet E. H. Mottley to visit Hopkinsville in endeavor to resuscitate Matamora Tribe, No. 12, but without success, and he took into his keeping the charge books and jewels of the Tribe.\"\n\nThe committee on the A. J. Francis matter reported that they had accepted his note for the amount, which would be due on the 20th of Corn Moon, 383, and the Great Sachem was instructed to sue in case the note was not paid.\n\nA petition was received from various palefaces, colored citizens of Newport, praying for a charter to establish a Tribe. The petition was laid on the table.\n\nThe Great Chief of Records reported as follows: Number of Tribes, 8; members, 480; adoptions, 57; reinstated, 2; admitted by card, 4; withdrawn by card, 10; expelled, 28; suspended, 72; rejected, 4; deceased, 8; Past Sachems, 8.\n\nThe number of expulsions reported, not only at this, but at other councils, indicates that but little care was taken in the selection of the material of which the Tribes were composed.\n\nThe finance committee reported that there was $132 in the hands of the Great Chief of Records not accounted for, and the Great Keeper of Wampum not being present, nor his books, an adjustment could not be reached.\n\nThe election resulted as follows:\n\nThomas A. Davis Great Sachem J. T. Follett Great Senior Sagamore John P. Phister Great Junior Sagamore C. H. Conn Great Prophet E. H. Meyers Great Chief of Records W. G. Stone Great Keeper of Wampum\n\nThe council fire was then quenched.\n\n1875.\n\nTWENTY-SECOND GREAT SUN COUNCIL.\n\nThe Great Council met in the wigwam of Minnehaha Tribe, No. 10, hunting grounds of Newport, on the 27th sun of Buck 41 Moon, G. S. D. 384, the council fire being kindled in due form, Great Senior Sagamore J. F. Follett presiding, the Great Sachem being absent.\n\nRepresentatives were admitted from Tribes Nos. 2, 3, 4, 10 and 13.\n\nThe Great Senior Sagamore in his long talk said: \"By the surrender of the charter of Wyandotte Tribe, the Great Sachem, Thos. A. Davis, is an absentee from our council today, and I am illy prepared to entertain you with an account of the workings of our Order in the State during the past great sun. I can confidently, though with regret, say that the Order has retrograded to a considerable extent. Osceola Tribe, No. 8, of Lexington, surrendered shortly after our last Great Council, and Wyandotte Tribe, on the 8th sleep of Buck Moon, last past, and to the best of my knowledge none of those in existence can boast of doing deeds to add additional feathers in their crests. In the absence of facts whereupon to base an opinion, I am unable to offer any suggestion, except to recommend an effort individually to carry out the tenets of our Order, especially in the wigwam, and when the lessons of Freedom, Friendship and Charity shall have been thoroughly learned there, our associations with the outer world will certainly be more pleasant, and we can give our brothers in the forest as well as in the wigwam the warm grasp of friendship and another knot to the cord that binds us as brothers.\" The Great Senior Sagamore, continuing, called the attention of the Great Council to laxity of Tribes and individuals in obeying the laws, and recommended their revision. He cited several decisions made by him and dispensations granted. \"On the sleep of the 27th sun of Plant Moon, G. S. D. 384, I granted a dispensation to Minnehaha Tribe to turn out in procession to assist in laving of the corner stone of a new market house in Newport. I did this at the earnest request of some of the members of the Tribe, believing at the time that whenever the fact of our existence was brought to the public notice it would be to the good of the Order. I have since been cured of the delusion. Finally, let it be borne in mind that the one thing needful in the Order and to maintain our organization is to elect chiefs who can and will do their duty, and see that the several Tribes of this jurisdiction maintain a proper discipline, and that ignorance, coupled with incompetency, shall not be the means of destroying our Order in the State of Kentucky. I thank you for listening to an ill excuse for what should be the journal of your Great Sachem.\"\n\nThe Great Chief of Records reported: \"Cash in hands of Great Keeper of Wampum, $233.19; number of Tribes, 6; members, 415; adoptions, 14; suspensions, 57; expulsions, 26; reinstatements, 2; 42 admitted by card, 5; deceased, 5; Past Great Sachems, 7; Past Sachems, 79.\"\n\nThe election resulted as follows:\n\nG.

Stone Great Keeper of Wampum Conrad Schmidt Great Representative to G. C. U. S.\n\nThe Great Council fire was quenched in due form.\n\nAn extra session was called in the wigwam of Minnehaha Tribe, No. 10, on the 23d of Hunting Moon, G. S. D. 385, when charges were preferred against Great Keeper of Wampum W. G. Stone for conduct unbecoming a Great Chief. There is no records of a trial, and probably the charges were not sustained, if there was one, for Bro. Stone was subsequently twice elected Great Chief of Records.\n\nThe Great Chief of Records was instructed to notify Brother A. J. Francis that he stood expelled from this Great Council, and that he also notify Brother Francis' Tribe of the fact.\n\nThus ingloriously comes to end the career of a brilliant Red Man. He had held every position of honor and trust that could have been conferred upon him. A. J. Francis successively held the positions of Great Chief of Records, Great Sachem, Great Incohonee of the G. C. U. S., Great Representative to G. C. U. S. for many Great Suns, and Great Keeper of Wampum of the Great Council of Kentucky for eleven Great Suns.\n\n1876.\n\nTWENTY-THIRD GREAT SUN COUNCIL.\n\nWe find no records of the session of this Great Sun, but from the records of the ensuing Great Sun we learn that the following chiefs were elected:\n\nC.

S. D. 387, and the council fire was kindled in due form, Great Sachem Geo. Brunk presiding.\n\nRepresentatives were present from Tribes Nos. 3, 10 and 17.\n\nPast Great Sachem C. H. Conn was refused admission on the grounds that he was not a member of any Tribe at that time.\n\nThe long talk of the Great Sachem is not given, nor is the report of the Great Chief of Records.\n\nThe finance committee reported amount in the wampum belt at $61.31.\n\nThe election resulted as follows:\n\nJohn N. Stauder Great Sachem F. Bismark Great Senior Sagamore C. Maunder Great Junior Sagamore S. F. Schell Great Chief of Records John Wolfhardt Great Keeper of Wampum Geo. Reese Great Representative to G. C. U.

S. 5612, 1852. Pocahontas Tribe, No. 3, of Newport, and Kentucky, No. 4, of Louisville, were instituted in the following grand sun. The Great Council fire was lighted on the 9th of Sturgeon Moon, G. S. 5614, 1854. The Order in Kentucky flourished for many great suns, but finally began to lose interest and membership, and was not represented in the G. C. U. S. after G. S. D. 398. In G. S. D. 395, but one Tribe was reported in the State—Miami, No. 17, of Newport. The Great Council fire had long ceased to burn. In G. S. D. 397 Kentucky was placed under the jurisdiction of the Great Council of Ohio, and the standing of its Tribes on the 30th of Hot Moon, G. S. D. 401, is included in the statement given for that reservation. During its existence as a Great Council, Kentucky furnished two Great Incohonees to the G. C. U. S.\"\n\nWhile under the jurisdiction of the Great Council of Ohio the following Tribes were instituted in Kentucky:\n\nShawnee Tribe, No. 18, was instituted at Winchester in G. S. D. 396 (1887), by B. W. Kline, a German living in Cincinnati, and holding a minor chieftaincy in the Great Council of Ohio. He visited Winchester on business, and being an enthusiastic Red Man, immediately set about the organization of a Tribe. In less than two days he had secured a list of petitioners, and in a couple of seven suns he returned and instituted Shawnee Tribe, No. 18, under the jurisdiction of the Great Council of Ohio. C. E. Lyddane was the first Sachem, who ten years later was Great Chief of Records for five great suns, and now ranks as a Past Great Sachem. After the Tribe was organized it received no further attention from the Great Council of Ohio, was never visited by any of its Great Chiefs, and was never represented in its Great Council. Red Men were very scarce and a visitor was a rare occurrence. However, 49 Shawnee grew and flourished and for several great suns held regular meetings. A loft of Haymakers was instituted and sometimes the fun was so fast and furious that the police threatened to interfere. The Tribe finally died of pure neglect and loneliness. It had considerable amount of wampum in its belt, which was parceled out to the members in good standing. The love of Redmanship did not die in the breast of its members, however, and when in G. S. D. 403 Miantonomo Tribe, No. 1, was organized at Lexington, among its charter members were several of those who had belonged to old Shawnee, No. 18, and it was very little trouble a few seven suns later to kindle the council fire of Onequa, No. 2, amid the ashes of the old Tribe. Some of the members of old Shawnee have lapsed from the Order, some have passed to the Eternal Hunting Grounds, while others are still found around the council fire and are training a new generation in Freedom, Friendship and Charity.\n\nOsceola, No. 19, at Ashland, on the 26th of Buck Moon, G. S. D. 399, with 15 charter members, Harry C. McKay being then Great Sachem. This Tribe is still in existence, and is one of the strongest in the reservation.\n\nMohawk, No. 20, at Louisville, on 1st Hot Moon, G. S. D. 400. At the institution of this Tribe it was hoped that Redmanship would be once more revived in Kentucky and would flourish, but the anticipation of its founders were not realized, as it lived but a short time and was never prosperous. 50\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nKENTUCKY UNDER A DEPUTY GREAT INCOHONEE, AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF TRIBES BY THE GREAT COUNCIL OF THE UNITED STATES, 1894.\n\nIn the summer of G. S. D. 403, there came to the hunting grounds of Lexington J. B. Mendenhall, holding a commission as Deputy for Great Incohonee Andrew H. Paton. Mendenhall held a withdrawal card from Ninegret Tribe, No. 21, of New London, Conn. Where he received his honors as a Past Sachem is not known, as it is certain he was not known as a Past Sachem in Ninegret Tribe. During the autumn of this great sun Mendenhall began an active canvas for petitioners for a charter for a Tribe of Red Men in Lexington, and with the assistance of O. R. King, J. R. McConnell, and others he was abundantly successful, so that on the 15th of Hunting Moon, G. S. D. 403, he had a list of 121 accepted applicants, including Past Great Sachem Thos. A. Hornsey, formerly a member of old Osceola, No. 8, of these hunting grounds, who deposited his withdrawal card from that Tribe. On the above date the Tribe was instituted in the Opera House by Great Incohonee A. H. Paton, of Massachusetts, assisted by Great Chief of Records of the G. C. U. S., Charles C. Conley, of Pennsylvania; Past Great Incohonee and National Exemplifier Thos. K. Donnalley, of Philadelphia; Great Sachem of Illinois, Wilson Brooks, of Chicago, and Past Great Sachem Judge Alfred Ellison, of Indianapolis, Ind. The work of the Adoption Degree was exemplified by the chiefs of the new Tribe, the National Exemplifier having been drilling them for several suns, and it is doubtful if the work done by the team at that time has ever been excelled in this reservation. Immediately the Tribe was instituted its members began active efforts to establish other Tribes in their vicinity, and under the leadership of Deputy Great Incohonee J. B. Mendenhall, Miantonomo Tribe, No. 1, of Lexington, of which he was now a member, assisted in the institution of the following Tribes:\n\nOnequa Tribe, No. 2, at Winchester, on the 29th of Cold Moon, G. S. D. 404, with 41 charter members, of whom 18 had previously 51 taken membership in Miantonomo Tribe, No. 1, and became members of Onequa, No. 2, by the deposit of withdrawal cards. Many of these members had been formerly members of Old Shawnee Tribe, No. 18.\n\nWyandotte Tribe, No. 3, at Maysville, on the 3d of Hot Moon, G. S. D. 404, with 35 charter members, including many members of old Wyandotte Tribe, No. 16, one of whom was Past Great Sachem Thos. A. Davis.\n\nWinona Tribe, No. 4, at Lexington, on the 24th of Hot Moon, G. S. D. 404, with 25 charter members.\n\nTecumseh Tribe, No. 5, at Harrodsburg, on the 27th of Hot Moon, G. S. D. 404, with 25 members.\n\nPaughcaughnaughsinque Tribe, No. 6, at Augusta, on the 1st of Beaver Moon, G. S. D. 404, with 41 charter members.\n\nHiawatha Tribe, No. 7, at Louisville, on the 6th of Hunting Moon, G. S. D. 404. with 63 charter members.\n\nCherokee Tribe, No. 8, at Louisville, on the 22d of Hunting Moon, 404.\n\nMinnehaha Council, No. 2, Degree of Pocahontas, at Lexington, with a charter membership of 49, on the 28th of Worm Moon, 404.\n\nCharters were issued to the foregoing by the Great Council of the United States.\n\nIn his long talk to the Great Council of the United States in Corn Moon, G. S. D. 404, Great Incohonee Andrew H. Paton said:\n\n\"More than forty great suns ago a Great Council fire was kindled in Kentucky, which was extinguished after burning somewhat feebly for about thirty great suns. In G. S. D. 397 the few members in the State were by this great Council placed under the jurisdiction of Ohio. The Order here, as it has in some of the other States we are trying to reorganize, had fallen into disrepute because of the carelessness, bad management, and vicious material which had been admitted into the Tribes. Although these characteristics had ceased to be, the Order was and is yet suffering in that State because of what had been, and the Great Council of Ohio found itself unable to overcome the prejudices which prevailed. Under these circumstances it seemed better to place the interests of the Order in Kentucky in charge of some one on the ground, who could give them personal oversight. By consent of our Board of Great Chiefs the Great Sachem of Ohio was visited, and at a meeting of the Great Chiefs of Ohio and several of its Representatives and ex-Representatives to this body, arrangements were made by which Ohio resigned its control of Kentucky except of the two Tribes, the fires of which were then burning. At the Great Sun Council of Ohio in Flower Moon, it was voted that its authority over these two Tribes should be withdrawn this Cold Moon. By 52 good fortune, an enthusiastic Red Man from Connecticut, Brother J. B. Mendenhall, had taken up his residence in Lexington, Kentucky, and arrangements were made with him to rebuild the Order in the State. In spite of many obstacles, and at much cost of labor and wampum, Brother Mendenhall has added five Tribes to the two existing at the time of his appointment, and of material which is an ornament to the fraternity. A Great Council of Kentucky is therefore also within sight. No member of the Order has made more sacrifices the past great sun for the Improved Order of Red Men than has Brother Mendenhall. He has spent his time, his efforts, and his wampum without stint and under circumstances which often gave good excuse to do otherwise.\"\n\nOn the 7th sun of Hunting Moon, G. S. D. 404, Deputy Great Incohonee J. B. Mendenhall addressed a circular letter to all Tribes and Past Sachems in the Reservation of Kentucky, from which the following extracts are made:\n\n\"Your attention is again directed to my talk of the 11th sun of Beaver Moon, relative to the institution of the Great Council of Kentucky.\n\nMiantonomo Tribe, No. 1, adopted 106 pale faces last sleep, and I will institute Hiawatha Tribe, No. 7, at Louisville, Ky., on the 9th sleep of this moon, with about 70 charter members. This will give us a total of about 700 members and 50 past Sachems in good standing.\n\nEvery Past Sachem will therefore take notice and make a special effort to be present in the hunting grounds of Lexington on the 27th and 28th suns of Hunting Moon, G. S. D. 404.\n\nThe council fire will be kindled at the 10th run, rising of the sun, and the Great Council Degree conferred upon all Past Sachems then in waiting, and the transaction of business will begin immediately thereafter.\n\nThe institution will take place in Red Men's Hall, 38 East Short street.\n\nOsceola Tribe, No. 18, Ashland, and Miami Tribe, No. 17, Newport, are now under my jurisdiction, and they will pay their per capita tax to the Great Council of Kentucky, as soon as instituted, instead of to the Great Council of Ohio.\"\n\nThe Great Chief of Records of the Great Council of the United States, in his report to the G. C. U. S. for G. S. D., gives the following statistics for the Tribes in Kentucky under the jurisdiction of the G. C. U. S., which does not include Miami, No. 17, and Osceola, No. 18:\n\nNumber of Tribes, 5; adopted, 267; admitted by card, 2; withdrawn by card, 20; Past Sachems, 26: total membership, 249.\n\n53\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nESTABLISHMENT OF THE GREAT COUNCIL OF KENTUCKY AND ITS RECORDS FROM 1895 to 1907.\n\nIn compliance with request of petitioners from various Tribes in Kentucky, Great Chief of Records of the Great Council of the United States, Charles C. Conley, acting Great Incohonee, and Past Great Sachem William C. Conley, of Pennsylvania, acting Great Chief of Records, appeared in the wigwam of Miantonomo Tribe, No. 1, hunting grounds of Lexington, on the 27th sun of Hunting Moon, G. S. D. 404, for the purpose of kindling the Great Council fire of Kentucky.\n\nAfter appropriate remarks of instruction had been given by the two Great Chiefs, the following named Past Sachems, who responded to the call, were marked as present:\n\nMiantonomo Tribe, No. 1—J.

T. Farnsworth, of No. 1, John D. Walker, of No. 2 and Charles Scott, of No. 4 as being in the forest with proper credentials, and recommended they be admitted, and they were admitted and received the Great Council degree. It was voted that an appropriation of two hundred fathoms be made for the expense of the Great Chiefs for the ensuing term.\n\nThe Great Chief of Records was authorized to prepare an original design for a seal and to procure the seal as soon as possible.\n\nThe following resolution was unanimously adopted:\n\nResolved: That in expression of its appreciation of the invaluable services performed by the Great Chief of Records of the Great Council of the United States, Charles C. Conley, acting Great Incohonee, and Past Great Sachem William C. Conley, of Pennsylvania, acting Great Chief of Records, who have so ably and courteously assisted and instructed the Great Council of Kentucky during its course of organization, the records of the Great Council shall contain this resolution expressive of its gratitude for their distinguished services.\n\nThe various bills and expenses incident to institution were ordered paid, leaving a balance in the wampum belt of seven fathoms, six feet and two inches. 55\n\nIt was voted to kindle the next council fire in the wigwam of Paughcaughnaughsinque Tribe, No. 6, at Augusta.\n\nFollowing are the statistics of the Order at the time of institution—Whole number of Tribes, 10; Tribes not reporting, 2; adopted, 265; admitted by card, 12; withdrawn by card, 4; suspensions, 10; rejections, 9; total membership, 638; Past Sachems, 71.\n\nCouncil of the Degree of Pocahontas—Minneola, No. 1, at Ashland; Minnehaha, No. 2, at Lexington.\n\nThe Great Sachem announced the appointment of standing committees for the ensuing great sun, as follows—\n\nFinance—J.
