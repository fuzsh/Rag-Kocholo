        "text": "Clara Redman Adams, 74, went to be with her Heavenly Father on Wednesday, December 18, 2002. She is survived by her two daughters, Paula Sue Adams Clark of Kamiah, Idaho and Carol Ann Adams Knox of Dallas. Clara was preceded in death by her husband, Paul B. Adams, November 1974. Other survivors include one granddaughter, Molly Rogers, Olympia, Washington; one sister, Eugenia Dover, Eufaula, Oklahoma; three brothers, William Redman, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Robert Redman, Muskogee, Oklahoma and Eugene Redman, Denver, Colorado; and several nieces and nephews. Clara was born on November 18, 1928 in Eufaula, Oklahoma. She graduated from Southeastern State University in Durant, Oklahoma. She did her masters work at Texas Tech University in Lubbock before moving to Lamesa, where she took a position as Dawson County Home Demonstration Agent. While in Lamesa, Clara met Paul B.
