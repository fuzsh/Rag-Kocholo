The woman who inspired Pulp's hit song Disco 2000 has died shortly after being appointed an MBE.

Deborah Bone, 51, from Letchworth, Hertfordshire was a childhood friend of lead singer Jarvis Cocker in Sheffield. She was diagnosed with cancer in 2013.

The 1995 Britpop hit contains the lyric: "Your name is Deborah. Deborah. It never suited ya."

The nurse received an MBE for services to children's mental health in the New Year Honours list.

Mental health professional Mrs Bone led the Step 2 young people's health programme in Stevenage and created the BrainBox, a resource for improving emotional and mental wellbeing for both children and adults.

Cocker reportedly sang Disco 2000 at her 50th birthday party.

The lyrics also include the line: "Well we were born within one hour of each other. Our mothers said we could be sister and brother."
