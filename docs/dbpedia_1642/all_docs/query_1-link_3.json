        "text": "The woman who inspired Pulp's hit song Disco 2000 has died shortly after being appointed an MBE.\n\nDeborah Bone, 51, from Letchworth, Hertfordshire was a childhood friend of lead singer Jarvis Cocker in Sheffield. She was diagnosed with cancer in 2013.\n\nThe 1995 Britpop hit contains the lyric: \"Your name is Deborah. Deborah. It never suited ya.\"\n\nThe nurse received an MBE for services to children's mental health in the New Year Honours list.\n\nMental health professional Mrs Bone led the Step 2 young people's health programme in Stevenage and created the BrainBox, a resource for improving emotional and mental wellbeing for both children and adults.\n\nCocker reportedly sang Disco 2000 at her 50th birthday party.\n\nThe lyrics also include the line: \"Well we were born within one hour of each other. Our mothers said we could be sister and brother.\""
