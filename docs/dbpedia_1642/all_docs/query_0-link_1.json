        "text": "\"Disco 2000\" is a hit single by British band Pulp, released in 1995. It reached #7 in the UK Singles Chart.[1] It was the third single from the album Different Class, following \"Common People\" and the double A-side \"Mis-Shapes\"/\"Sorted for E's & Wizz\", both of which reached #2.\n\nThe song tells the story of a narrator falling for a childhood friend called Deborah, who is more popular than he is and wondering what it would be like to meet again when they are older. The song is based on true events. Pulp frontmanJarvis Cocker said \"the only bit that isn't true is the woodchip wallpaper.\"[2]\n\nIt is believed that the fountain referred to as the meeting place was Goodwin Fountain, formerly located on Fargate, in Sheffield city centre. The song's riff is said to be influenced by Laura Branigan's 1980s hit \"Gloria\".[3]\n\nDue to its millennial subject matter, Pulp removed the song's synchronisation licence, effectively banning the song from being used in TV and radio trailers throughout 1999 and 2000.[4]\n\nContents[]\n\n[hide] *1 Track listing\n\n1.1 CD\n\n1.2 12\"\n\n1.3 7\"\n\n2 In popular culture\n\n3 Cover versions\n\n4 References\n\n5 External links\n\nTrack listing[edit][]\n\nCD[edit][]\n\nAll lyrics written by Jarvis Cocker, all music composed by Jarvis Cocker, Nick Banks, Steve Mackey, Russell Senior,Candida Doyle and Mark Webber.\n\nPart one No. Title Length 1. \"Disco 2000 (7\" Mix)\" 4:51 2. \"Disco 2000 (Album Mix)\" 4:33 3. \"Ansaphone\" 4:01 4. \"Live Bed Show (Extended)\" 4:10\n\nPart two No. Title Length 1. \"Disco 2000 (Album Mix)\" 4:33 2. \"Disco 2000 (7\" Mix)\" 4:51 3. \"Disco 2000 (Motiv 8 Discoid Mix)\" 7:31 4. \"Disco 2000 (Motiv 8 Gimp Dub)\" 6:31\n\nSingle-CD version No. Title Length 1. \"Disco 2000 (7\" Mix)\" 4:51 2. \"Disco 2000 (Motiv 8 Discoid Mix)\" 7:31\n\nUK Cassette editions have the same track listing.\n\n12\"[edit][]\n\nSide A No. Title Length 1. \"Disco 2000 (7\" Mix)\" 4:51 2. \"Ansaphone\" 4:01\n\nSide B No. Title Length 3. \"Disco 2000 (Motiv 8 Discoid Mix)\" 7:31 4. \"Disco 2000 (Motiv 8 Gimp Dub)\" 6:31\n\n7\"[edit][]\n\nOrange Vinyl No. Title Length 1. \"Disco 2000 (7\" Mix)\" 4:51 2. \"Ansaphone\" 4:01\n\nReleased: November 1996.\n\nIn popular culture[edit][]\n\n\"Disco 2000\" was featured in Episode 7 of the first series of Life on Mars, where DI Sam Tyler hears it come on the radio in 1973, and mentions to DCI Gene Hunt that he had seen Pulp play the Manchester Nynex in 1996, to Hunt's bemusement. The song also appeared in a party scene in the 2013 Seth Rogen film \"This Is the End\".\n\nCover versions[edit][]"
