Overview:

Different Class is the fifth studio album by English Britpop band Pulp. It was released in 1995 at the height of Britpop, and led to the band being regarded as part of that movement. Two of the singles on the album - "Common People" (which reached number two in the UK singles chart) and "Disco 2000" (which reached number seven) - were especially notable, and helped propel Pulp to nationwide fame. A "deluxe edition" of Different Class was released on 11 September 2006. It contains a second disc of B-sides, demos and rarities.

The album was the winner of the 1996 Mercury Music Prize. In 1998 Q readers voted Different Class the 37th greatest album of all time; a repeat poll in 2006 put it at number 85.[citation needed] In 2000 the same magazine placed it at number 46 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever.[citation needed] In 2004 it was voted number 70 of Channel 4's 100 greatest albums. It has sold 1,255,000 copies in the United Kingdom as of September 2011.

The inspiration for the title came to frontman Jarvis Cocker in Smashing, a nightclub on Regent Street in London. Cocker had a friend who used the phrase "different class" to describe something that was "in a class of its own". Cocker liked the double meaning, with its allusions to the British social class system which was a theme of some of the songs on the album.[citation needed] A message on the back of record also references this idea:

"We don't want no trouble, we just want the right to be different. That's all."

Also, as much as "Common People" and "Disco 2000" were played to death, I don't think I could ever get sick of them. The bit in "Common People" where he sings "She just smiled and held my hand!" and the laser sound goes off at the same time is just magic. The treated violin in the background is terrific too. I get goosebumps listening to it.

And Nick Cave has done two covers of "Disco 2000", one of which was a b-side to Pulp's "Bad Cover Version" single (from We Love Life in 2002) and the other was included in the deluxe remastered version of this album. Personally I prefer the really sad version from "Bad Cover Version" but both are worth listening to.

Also, for years I refused to listen to any other Pulp album because this one was so perfect, I was afraid I'd sully it if I didn't like their other albums. I still have only dipped into the rest of their back catalogue.

I was the same, I loved Different Class and didn't really check anything else out; I keep meaning to get This is Hardcore, which I've heard only good things about.
