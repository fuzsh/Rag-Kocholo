Theodore Dreiser claimed to have written part of the lyrics himself. For a discussion of this, see On the Banks of the Wabash: The Life and Music of Paul Dresser by Clayton W. Henderson (Indiana Historical Society Press, 2003). See also “’On the Banks of the Wabash’: A Musical Whodunit” by Richard W. Dowell in Indiana Magazine of History 66 (June 1970) and “Collaborating on ‘The Banks of the Wabash’: A Brief History of an Interdisciplinary Debate, Some New Evidence, and a Reflexive Consideration of Turf and Ownership” by Carol S. Loranger and Dennis Loranger in Dreiser Studies 30.1 (1999).\n\n“On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away”\n\n(Verse)\n\nRound my Indiana homestead wave the cornfields,\n\nIn the distance loom the woodlands clear and cool.\n\nOftentimes my thoughts revert to scenes of childhood,\n\nWhere I first received my lessons, nature’s school.\n\nBut one thing there is missing from the picture,\n\nWithout her face it seems so incomplete.\n\nI long to see my mother in the doorway,\n\nAs she stood there years ago, her boy to greet.\n\n(Chorus)\n\nOh, the moonlight’s fair tonight along the Wabash,\n\nFrom the fields there comes the breath of newmown hay.\n\nThrough the sycamores the candle lights are gleaming,\n\nOn the banks of the Wabash, far away.\n\n(Verse)\n\nMany years have passed since I strolled by the river,\n\nArm in arm, with sweetheart Mary by my side,\n\nIt was there I tried to tell her that I loved her,\n\nIt was there I begged of her to be my bride.\n\nLong years have passed since I strolled thro’ the churchyard.\n\nShe’s sleeping there, my angel, Mary dear,\n\nI loved her, but she thought I didn’t mean it,\n\nStill I’d give my future were she only here.\n\n*****************************************************\n\n“My Gal Sal; or, They Called Her Frivolous Sal” (1905)\n\nComposed by Dreiser’s brother Paul Dresser, this song did not become a hit until after Paul Dresser’s death in 1906. The song is about Annie Brace (alias Sallie Walker), an Evansville, Indiana madam who was Paul Dresser’s paramour. “My Gal Sal” is also the title of a 1942 film produced by Twentieth Century-Fox that was based on Paul Dresser’s life and which draws loosely on Theodore Dreiser’s affectionate memoir “My Brother Paul” in his Twelve Men.\n\n“My Gal Sal.” Composed by Paul Dresser. Performed by Joan Morris, mezzo; William Bolcom, piano. From the album “Moonlight Bay” (Albany Records, catalogue # TROY318). Used with permission of Albany Records.\n\n“My Gal Sal; or, They Called Her Frivolous Sal”\n\nEverything is over and I’m feeling bad\n\nI lost the best pal that I ever had\n\n‘Tis but a fortnight since she was here\n\nSeems like she’s gone tho’, for twenty years\n\nOh, how I miss her, my old pal\n\nOh, how I’d kiss her, My Gal Sal\n\nFace not so handsome, but eyes don’t you know\n\nThat shone just as bright as they did years ago.\n\nThey called her frivolous Sal\n\nA peculiar sort of a gal\n\nWith a heart that was mellow\n\nAn all ’round good fellow, was my old pal\n\nYour troubles, sorrow and care\n\nShe was always willing to share\n\nA wild sort of devil, but dead on the level\n\nWas My Gal Sal.\n\nBrought her little dainties just afore she died\n\nPromised she would meet me on the other side\n\nTold her how I love her, she said, “I know Jim\n\nJust do your best, leave the rest to Him.”\n\nGently I pressed her to my breast\n\nSoon she would take her last, long rest\n\nShe looked at me and murmured, “Pal.”\n\nAnd softly I whispered “Goodbye, Sal.”\n\n— posted by Roger W. Smith\n\nFebruary 2016"
