        "text": "Monthly Archives: May 2017\n\nGeorge K. Nelson to Theodore Dreiser, June 8, 1933\n\nPosted here is a copy of a letter dated June 8, 1933 to Theodore Dreiser from his nephew George K. Nelson.\n\nGeorge Kates Nelson (1892-1955) was the son of Dreiser’s sister Emma Wilhelmina Dreiser by Lorenzo A. Hopkins. Mr. Nelson was the manager of a hotel in Manhattan.\n\nDreiser was close to George K. Nelson’s sister Gertrude A. Hopkins, his niece. But, the cold, businesslike letter posted here shows that there was no personal relationship between Dreiser and his nephew George. Nelson had had a relationship in his adolescence with his uncle Paul Dresser, the songwriter (Theodore Dreiser’s brother), this according to an interview with Gloria N. Vevante, George K. Nelson’s daughter, conducted by Roger W. Smith in 2007.\n\nNelson writes here: “It is understood that any such moneys received by me will be received as agent for Mary F. Brennan, Sylvia Kishima, Emma A. Nelson [George K. Nelson’s mother], Albert J. Dreiser and Rome M. Dresser. …” They were Dreiser’s siblings.\n\n— Roger W. Smith\n\nMay 2017\n\nEd Dreiser to brother Theodore, April 30, 1938\n\nPosted here is a copy of a letter dated April 30, 1938 from Theodore Dreiser’s younger brother Eduard Minerod Dreiser (1873-1958) to Dreiser\n\nMentioned in the letter:\n\n“the Astoria family” — Dreiser’s sisters Emma Wilhelmina Dreiser (1863-1936); Maria Franziska Dreiser (Mame; 1861-1944); and Cacilia Dreiser (ca. 1865-1945), all of whom lived in their later years in Astoria, Queens, New York City\n\n“Mame” — Dreiser’s sister Maria Franziska Dreiser\n\n“Mai” — Edward Dreiser’s wife Mai V. (Skelly) Dreiser (1878-1955)\n\n“Vera” — Edward Dreiser’s daughter Vera Dreiser (1908-1998), Theodore Dreiser’s niece\n\n“Paul” – Driers brother, the songwriter Paul Dresser (1856-1906)\n\n— posted by Roger W. Smith\n\nMay 2017\n\n“Dreiser Seriously Hurt in Mishap”\n\nnews item from unidentified newspaper, May 14, 1919\n\nTCM screens 1931 film version of “An American Tragedy”\n\nIt was great to see a rare screening of the original 1931 film version of An American Tragedy on Turner Classic Movies (TCM) this evening. I am convinced that this version is superior to the acclaimed film A Place in the Sun, which I, personally, do not feel deserves the praise it has been accorded. See my post to this effect at\n\n“A Place in the Sun” is overrated, to put it kindly (two critics’ views)\n\nParticularly appealing — indeed, gratifying — to me was the quality of the print. I have seen the 1931 film several times, and the image was always grainy.\n\nThe host for the program, Ben Mankiewicz, got most of the details about the circumstances associated with the making of the film — and Theodore Dreiser’s objections to it — right. But, at the end of the program, he made a serious factual error. He stated that Chester Gillette’s mother sued Paramount. This is not true.\n\nIt was Grace Brown’s mother who sued the producers, as is indicated in the following news item:\n\n“Ithaca Picked for Trial of Movie Suit; ‘American Tragedy’ Producers Denied Pre-Trial Questioning Petition,” Syracuse Herald, September 7, 1934, pg. 16\n\n$150,000 libel action of Mrs. Grace Brown, 78, of Smyrna [NY], against Paramount-Publix moving picture corporation for alleged destructive character delineation in the film version of “An American Tragedy.” … Clifford Searl of Syracuse, counsel for Mrs. [Minerva] Brown. “Mrs. Brown claims in her suit she was depicted as ‘illiterate’ in the film version.”\n\nAlso see below a PDF file of a New York Times article dated November 9, 1934 about the settlement of the suit.\n\n— Roger W. Smith\n\nMay 17, 2017\n\n‘Paramount Settles Suit’ – NY Times 11-9-1934\n\na few Dreiser book covers\n\nFrom my personal library. Images below.
