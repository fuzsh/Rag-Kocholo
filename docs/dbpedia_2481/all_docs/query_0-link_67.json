        "text": "01 Aug 2024\n\n+\n\nModern Rooftop Addition Kicks Off\n\nAugust 1, 2024 – Our Modern Rooftop Addition, a mixed-use building in Fletcher Place, has kicked off!\n\nThis project has been in the works for a while already and we have been eager to start our build. We are helping to renovate the existing spaces, both commercial and residential, as well as add an addition to the residential suite above. This will practically double the square footage of the residential portion of the building.\n\nOur client will continue running their company out of the commercial space post-construction, and inhabiting the unit when they are in town. Stay tuned for more updates – it won’t be one you’ll want to miss!\n\n03 Jun 2024\n\n+\n\nDylan Gahimer back at HAUS\n\nJune 03, 2024 – Everyone please welcome back Dylan Gahimer; he interned for us the summer of 2022 and was excited to come back to work with us full-time as an architectural associate.\n\nDylan holds his Bachelor’s of Architecture from Ball State University. We already know of Dylan’s attention to detail and love for technical aspects of a project and he is eager to gain more experience as he works to become licensed.\n\nOutside of work Dylan likes to dabble in photography, exploring new places and creating music; playing 4 different instruments: trumpet, piano, guitar and electric bass. We are so pleased to have Dylan back and diving into projects again with us all!\n\n11 Jan 2024\n\n+\n\nHAUS Honored at Excellence in Architecture 2024\n\nJanuary 11, 2024 (Indianapolis) – We are happy to report that HAUS was honored at the 2024 AIA Indianapolis Excellence in Architecture Gala for G BLOC Modern Live + Work!\n\nChris and Paul were on-hand to celebrate the achievement. Of 39 submissions, G BLOC was one of 10 to receive recognition at the event hosted at Indiana Landmarks in Indianapolis’ Old Northside historic district. The project received a Merit Award for Architecture (New Construction – Project Cost Less Than $5 Million).\n\nThanks to all project collaborators, and AIA Indianapolis for organizing and hosting another outstanding event to support community-building!\n\n21 Dec 2023\n\n+\n\nPHIUS Certified Builder Indianapolis\n\nWe are proud to announce that our associated partner and Indianapolis builder, WERK | Building Modern, is officially a PHIUS-Certified Builder.\n\nActually it’s not new news. In early 2022, Paul Reynolds trained and passed the certification program with flying colors.\n\nSince then, Paul and the team have been working diligently to integrate the new and continuous learning into our client projects.\n\nSo if you are interested in the latest news and knowledge about efficient design + build, HAUS and WERK have you covered!\n\n12 Dec 2023\n\n+\n\nHERS Rating for Brick Modern\n\nPart of the process of well-designed and constructed homes is validating through a third-party. We are experts in the design and detailing of homes but testing to ensure it is built well is important. The Brick Modern House is a completely electric home when it comes to heating and cooling, including water heating.\n\nPost-Construction testing gives the Brick Modern House a Home Energy Rating System (HERS) Index of 77 excluding the solar panels. When accounting for the solar panels, the HERS Rating adjusts to 17!\n\nThe third-party energy rater asks us for input so they’re able to form a design baseline and then post-construction they perform a draft test to check for air leaks but also to pressurize the house and determine how tight (or not) the house is. Contrary to what one might think, your house doesn’t need to breathe. You, however, do need to breathe.\n\nThe approach to get fresh air into a home should be through a designed and measured location, not through random leaks in the exterior of your home. If you’re interested in learning more about this, we’ll have more information to share under our ‘Topics’ tab. For the Brick Modern House, we’ll track the energy usage to provide feedback to our energy modeling that we perform through the design process.\n\n04 Oct 2023\n\n+\n\nHAUS Awarded at Monumental\n\nHAUS Awarded at Monumental – HAUS team was honored to receive two awards at the Monumental Awards Event at Tibbs Drive-In.\n\nG BLOC Live + Work received an Achievement Award for Real Estate Development and also an Achievement Award for Neighborhood Revitalization. Below, Paul, Derek, Ashleigh, Tom, and Chris were on-hand to celebrate the achievement.\n\nThanks to the many partners, collaborators, and supporters who helped us cross the finish line on this challenging opportunity! #indychamber\n\n15 Sep 2023\n\n+\n\nG BLOC wins AIA Award\n\nWe are happy to announce that G BLOC Modern Live + Work has won a 2023 AIA Indiana Design Award!\n\nOf 44 submissions, G BLOC was one of 9 to receive recognition at the event. The project received a Merit Award for Architecture (New Construction – Project Cost Less Than $5 Million).\n\nThanks to all project collaborators, and AIA Indiana + AIA Kentucky for organizing and hosting another outstanding event to support community-building!\n\n09 Jul 2023\n\n+\n\nAshleigh Totten Architectural Associate\n\nJuly 10, 2023 – We are happy to announce that Ashleigh Totten, Architectural Associate, has joined us from Ball State University – College of Architecture and Planning, where she completed her Bachelor of Architecture, with minors in Environmental + Social Justice and Philosophy.\n\nAshleigh brings experience in design, project management, and photography to her role at HAUS. As if Architecture weren’t enough, Ashleigh was also involved as a peer wellness ambassador, lead designer and editor for ‘Stance Philosophy Journal’, and active in student council.\n\nWe are excited to see how she can best immerse herself and actively demonstrate her creativity, marketing, and organizational skills!\n\nWelcome to the studio, Ashleigh!\n\n15 Jun 2023\n\n+\n\nLive-Work Expansion Approved\n\nLive-work expansion has been approved at 545 S East Street in the Fletcher Place/Holy Rosary Neighborhood by City of Indianapolis across from the Eli Lilly and Company headquarters.\n\nWe applied for and received a variance to expand the existing upper levels living component so that it becomes the predominant use from a square footage perspective. City also approved the Regional Center application without resistance or remonstrance.\n\nWe are looking forward to completing the balance of the design for permitting and starting the construction phase. Please see the project page for more images and ongoing storyline. We’ll be adding updates as we do, so please check-back!\n\n12 Jun 2023\n\n+\n\nSarah Borders Student Intern\n\nJuly 10, 2023 – Sarah Borders, Architecture Student Intern, joins HAUS from the University of Pennsylvania – College of Arts and Sciences, where she completed her Bachelor of Arts in Architecture with a minor in Urban Studies.\n\nSarah brings her prior experience as an architectural intern, involvement with affordable housing, participation in architectural research, and an enthusiasm for design to the studio.\n\nWe look forward to having Sarah in-studio to contribute to the work of the firm while bringing a fresh perspective to the table during her gap year until she embarks on her graduate studies.\n\nPlease join us in welcoming Sarah to the studio!\n\n10 May 2023\n\n+\n\nADUs Bring Organic Growth to Suburbia\n\nCheck out this article from Francesc Zamora on Architizer.\n\nAccessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) mandated by the State of California override local planning regulations to permit a second unit on almost any single-family zoned property. The law also allows any single-family zoned lot to be subdivided into two parcels. Additionally, it allows ADUs to be built with just a four-foot setback or no setback at the new interior property line of a subdivided parcel, in contrast with most towns, which have setbacks of more than 7 feet, up to 30 feet. It also mandates very relaxed parking requirements or no parking if the project is near public transit.\n\nIs California paving the way for ADUs across the US?\n\n01 May 2023\n\n+\n\nDerek & Paul Skydive\n\nDerek & Paul Skydive and do so representing HAUS as part of Derek’s bachelor party festivities.\n\nWho looks more nervous?\n\nWe’re glad they made it back alive!\n\n24 Dec 2022\n\n+\n\nHappy Holidays\n\nFrom G BLOC, our team at HAUS would like to wish our clients, friends, consultants, colleagues happy holidays!\n\nWe look forward to our journey with you all forward into 2023 and beyond :).\n\n10 Dec 2022\n\n+\n\nJOIN US\n\nJOIN US: If you are an architect, interior designer, or recent graduate, please let us know if you are interested in a change-of-scenery or even a first-time position out-of-school.\n\nWe are looking for smart, well-rounded people who love participating with design teams on creative-focused projects.

Check-out the article and the informative links.\n\nExcerpt\n\n“Today, climate change is a well-known fact, but for years it was a hotly debated topic. While there are still some climate deniers, the majority of people have finally accepted the harsh truth that we’re facing. There’s no longer room for debate – we’ve had the 10 warmest years ever recorded since 2005, and hundreds of species are at risk if we continue on this path. We’re at risk to lose entire cities, as increased temperatures cause sea levels to rise.\n\nThere have been plenty of warning signs over the years. We can look back at the past century and see exactly what was happening. So, what did the earth look like before climate change? What will it look like in the future? This article will act as a climate time machine, taking you back to look at the changing climate over the years. Then, we’ll consider what these changes mean for us in the present day, what the future looks like, and, perhaps most importantly – whose problem is it, really?”\n\n06 Mar 2022\n\n+\n\nFree Home Construction\n\nFree Home Construction: In partnership with our friends at WERK | Building Modern, we are now offering “FREE HOME CONSTRUCTION”.\n\nSimply hire us to design your new home, and we’ll take care of all construction costs for free.\n\nPlease inquire at create@haus-arch.com to set-up a call and learn more!\n\n#everybodyknows #freeisnotreallyfree 🙂\n\n11 Nov 2021\n\n+\n\nBridging Environments\n\nBridging environments | the award-winning, low-profile retreat that lightly touches its landscape, paying tribute to both its homeowners’ affinity for nature and art.\n\nCheck out Great Lakes by Design Magazine, Volume 5, Issue 5, featuring Bridge House.\n\nThanks again to our client and collaborators!\n\n09 Aug 2021\n\n+\n\nCode Red for Humanity (Climate Crisis)\n\nCode Red: UN Report details how climate change is affecting the earth.\n\nWhat can we do to help? We continue to integrate resilience and energy efficiency goals into our design + build process whether or not our clients are requesting it (many clients are, some are not). We are being proactive and making sure our clients have the latest information to informatively make their final choices and decisions.\n\nContact us for a deeper dive into this very important topic and our process!\n\n10 Jul 2021\n\n+\n\nLower Level Finish\n\nWe’ve finally produced and uploaded photos of the Scandinavian Modern Interior project that we mentioned in 2020.\n\nHave a look at the detail on this one.\n\n10 Jul 2021\n\n+\n\nRural Modern Pool Deck\n\nCheck out this new photo of Rural Modern pool deck.\n\nOur client finished Phase Two of this project in summer 2021 to complete a project process that began in 2014.\n\nPlease check-back for other updates about the design + construction process!\n\n19 Jun 2021\n\n+\n\nNestled in the Trees\n\nWe are so happy how Grandview is turning-out (nestled in the trees).\n\nThe pre-existing tree canopy and lakeside location is such an idyllic setting.\n\nSo much work goes into dreaming and creating a work of architecture. Working with our clients to come-up with the design concept, then the key details may only get you 25% there.\n\nYou have to have really great communication between Owner, Architect, and Construction Team from beginning-to-end to get you to the finish-line. We are almost to a-hundred!\n\n08 May 2021\n\n+\n\nLumber Price Explosion\n\nThe lumber price explosion has been a hot topic for about 9 months, and the story continues.\n\nUp to now, we have blamed COVID mainly, but also the cold weather event in Texas. But there are some other factors at play also, per this attached article from Visual Capitalist.\n\nThese extraordinary events and costs are certainly affecting the construction industry. However, all indicators are telling us that the design + construction markets remain as hot as ever. How much will these circumstances affect your decision to renovate or build new?\n\n10 Feb 2021\n\n+\n\nWe’ve Moved to G BLOC!\n\nWe have moved our studio to G BLOC in Broad Ripple North Village right next to the Monon Trail!\n\nIt’s been a long COVID-influenced, socially-distanced 12 months, and we are very much looking forward to the future. In fact, we are all back together in one space again!\n\nAlthough we are still keeping socially distanced (for the most-part), it’s great to be able to communicate and collaborate with team members in-person again.\n\nIf you are in the area, please stop by G BLOC for a visit!\n\n07 Nov 2020\n\n+\n\nMeridian-Kessler Tudor … A Perfect Canvas?\n\nThanks, Tiffany, for the collaboration on your home in Meridian-Kessler, and the nice words in Indianapolis Monthly Magazine Home of the Month!\n\nWe enjoyed our small part in helping to open the kitchen and integrate access and functionality to the upstairs. And you brought it all together with your excellent interior design sensibilities!\n\nAnd thanks to Kameron Shepherd – Innovative Construction – for excellent execution.\n\n17 Aug 2020\n\n+\n\nMaarten Bergsma Student Intern\n\nMaarten Bergsma joins HAUS as Student Intern for Fall term 2020.\n\nWe look forward to having Maarten on the team during this difficult time as we navigate COVID protocols.\n\nEveryone please join us in welcoming Maarten to the team!\n\n18 Jul 2020\n\n+\n\nHAUS is Hiring!\n\n18 July 2020: We are currently looking for a creative Graduate Architect to grow with our team. If you know someone who loves to contribute their talents to interesting architecture + interior design projects, please send them our way!\n\nWe believe this person will have up to 3 years of professional experience and have earned an architectural degree. Also, they will have experience and talent in design, drawing, and enjoy the design collaboration process. And last but not least, this person may also enjoy the construction process and helping to see that their ideas are successfully executed in the construction phase.\n\nPlease email inquiries with resume and portfolio links to “create@haus-arch.com”.\n\nUpdate (17 Aug 2020) – Thanks for all of the shares! We have filled our immediate need. Interested candidates, please continue to send resumes and portfolios our way for future consideration!\n\n31 May 2020\n\n+\n\nCrazier X2 – Racial Awareness\n\n2020 is challenging us on various fronts beyond crazy architectural details and a worldwide virus without a cure. Now racial awareness issues have again come to the forefront and have challenged us to be better as a nation and as a people.\n\nArchitectural details are not a new thing, just tools to help solve functional problems, ideally with aesthetic benefit.\n\nViruses are not a new thing either. But most of us have not experienced this level of interruption to our daily routines from the threat of sickness.\n\nAnd now the topic of racial diversity is before us front-and-center. How our differences affect all levels of the life experience has become a most urgent focus society-wide.\n\nIs it possible to put all of these things together to make a difference and help spur positive change?\n\nAs we ponder how we can help, many of our “solutions” center on the things we know. For us, that is urban planning and architecture.\n\nIs there any learning from the past that can help guide us? Perhaps. One particular effort comes to-mind. We dusted-off this thesis project from 1992 to see what motivated us to tackle similar issues almost 30 years ago.\n\nUnification Memorial: Catalyst for Social Change – A learning resources center specifically attempting to raise awareness and shape views of past and existing racial diversity in the United States.\n\nIs it naive to think that the process and result of creating a significant socially-conscious multi-purpose civic resource (a building) can serve as a “catalyst for social change”?\n\n27 Mar 2020\n\n+\n\nCrazier Times – A New Normal\n\nThese are crazier times. At this point, we have now been confined to our homes for a couple of weeks.

It gives a nice texture and warmth to the modern bathroom, says Christopher Short, principal architect at HAUS | Architecture For Modern Lifestyles. They were installed with inexpensive barn door hardware.\n\nIf there is old paint on the doors, people may want to consider sealing them with a satin finish to maintain their rustic quality, Short says.\n\n“Using old doors is a great way to recycle while maintaining character of an original historic space, even if they were not originally part of that same structure,” he says.\n\n17 May 2016\n\n+\n\n20 Awesome Examples Of Wood Ceilings\n\nHAUS project featured in Contemporist article about wood ceilings – check out these amazing projects from around the world!\n\nWood is a great way to add warmth to an interior, but it doesn’t just have to be about floors and furniture.

Another walkway leads to a third building, which houses the kitchen and dining area, as well as a suite for Ms. Krebs’s mother, a frequent visitor. The garage is in a fourth building. What ties it all together: white, modern facades and black, gabled roofs.\n\n“Our goal was to maximize privacy and view,” says Mr. Krebs, a 69-year-old retired gynecologic oncologist. With his wife, a 65-year-old health care lawyer, Mr. Krebs spent $1.5 million to build the four-bedroom, 5,000-square-foot home, which also includes a boathouse and a farm-equipment building.\n\nArchitects call them campus or compound-style homes. Like small university campuses, they are made up of separate wings or buildings that have distinct functions, such as sleeping, cooking or lounging. Separating different parts of living, fans say, allows not just for privacy, but also for a different look and feel in each area. Proponents also argue that campuses blend into the landscape and allow for life with few or no stairs, a popular feature with aging Americans.\n\nCampus-style living has its roots in American history. Maryland, where Annapolis-based architect Marta Hansen built the Krebs’s home in 2006, is rife with five-part Colonial compounds that consist of a main house attached to smaller wings on both sides. The classic American homestead is a cluster of buildings that include the kitchen and smokehouse, set apart to reduce fire risk. In traditional Spanish and Mexican architecture, connected buildings are arranged around a patio.\n\nCreating a village for one owner has its downsides. A house deconstructed into different parts can be more expensive than a single-unit home—between 25% and 30% more, estimates San Francisco-based architect Malcolm Davis, who frequently designs multipart homes. More buildings require more perimeter foundation, he explains, adding to construction costs. More exterior walls need more windows and cause more potential heat loss, adding to maintenance costs.\n\nMultibuilding living can also create its own set of practical considerations—one may have to traipse a longer distance to find the children, or retrieve the Amazon package from the front door.\n\nFans dismiss such criticisms. Kristin and Scott Fine, a general partner at a hedge fund, recently completed renovating their 101-year-old waterfront home in Darien, Conn. As part of the two-year, $2.5 million project, a glass-and-steel structure was created to attach a kitchen wing to one side of the house, and a separate, open-air steel arbor was erected to create an outdoor living room, framing the view of Long Island Sound.\n\nThe arbor connects the home to a new yoga and pool house, whose detachment from the main house—busy with four children and two dogs—makes the space more effective, according to the Fines. “A yoga room being physically separate is key to quieting my mind,” says Ms. Fine, a 43-year-old interior designer who has her own company, Fine Concepts, and worked on the project with New York City-based architect Michael Haverland. She says she usually runs to the building barefoot—”maybe” throwing on boots if there is snow.\n\nThe Fines’ compound isn’t done: The two buildings are first steps in a master plan for the 6-acre property that now has 13,400 square feet of living space. The couple is expecting to add a sports building with an indoor lap pool, spa and batting cage, as well as a building with private gallery space that can also house three artists as part of a planned residency program.\n\nIn 2014, Jonathan King and Jim Stott bought one of the oldest houses in Maine, 354-year-old Bray House in Kittery Point. The founders of Stonewall Kitchen, a York, Maine-based maker of jams, sauces and other specialty foods, Messrs. King and Stott had previously lived in historic homes and knew the shortcomings, such as low ceilings and wind blowing through old walls in the winter. But they were drawn to Bray House’s rich past and waterfront setting, to Mr. King “the most beautiful view in the world.”\n\nThe pair turned to Jacobsen Architecture, a Washington, D.C., firm with expertise in fusing contemporary space and historic buildings, including at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nNow, 1,450-square-foot Bray House is undergoing a $1 million renovation. It will be linked on both sides to indoor glass walkways leading to no fewer than 12 gabled pavilions that house a large living and dining space, a master-bedroom suite and an office. As part of the $5 million project, which Messrs King and Stott hope to complete by Labor Day 2017, even the laundry room will have its own building.\n\n“We want friends to come in, enjoy cocktails by the fire at Bray House, but then go into a 21st century space,” says Mr. King, who is 50 and chief creative officer of Stonewall Kitchen. Spreading out the additions horizontally, he says, means adding space—8,125 square feet of it—without adding height. “It’s not going to feel like we’re building this massive thing to block the view of the ocean.”\n\nOwner Diane Goldsmith from Orinda, Calif., bought the 2,700-square-foot, three-bedroom house with her husband, David, for $1.6 million in 2012. “I liked the idea of a sense of privacy and change as you walk from one part of the house into another,” says Ms. Goldsmith, a 65-year-old graphic designer. “Family and interactions on one side; rest and contemplation of the beauty of Sea Ranch on the other,” adds Mr. Goldsmith, a 68-year-old retired investment banker.\n\nSpreading out a house can create inconvenience. Answering the door is a trek. So is hauling around laundry or fixing a cup of tea. Owners say technology helps keep it together: Baby monitors can track children in far-off nurseries, and many keep kettles and refrigerators in the master suite to avoid nighttime trips to the kitchen.\n\nPeter and Maria Grazia Selzer’s $2 million, 3,600-square-foot home built by San Francisco-based architect Nick Noyes in Taos, N.M., consists of a rammed-earth Territorial-style house and two flat-roof Pueblo-style buildings on both sides. As such, the distance from the master bedroom to the kitchen is between 60 and 70 feet.\n\nMr. Selzer, a 70-year-old radiologist, says the isolation of the bedroom, located at the end of its own wing, is an advantage. “You could have a brass band going on in the main part of the house and we wouldn’t hear it,” he says.\n\nWrite to Cecilie Rohwedder at cecilie.rohwedder@wsj.com\n\n07 Mar 2016\n\n+\n\nCreative Shared Bedroom Ideas for a Modern Kids’ Room\n\nCreative Shared Bedroom Ideas Kids Modern Bedroom\n\nCheck out this article at Freshome.com which features HAUS custom shared kids’ room – project photo #15.\n\nBy Neila Deen March 7, 2016\n\nLaughing…crying…playing…fighting. A shared sibling bedroom is a beehive of activity and needs. And that means there’s a lot for parents to tackle when creating their kids’ shared bedroom. With twice the amount (or more) of evolving personalities and necessities, it’s often a daunting task for parents to accommodate storage, space and the individual style of each child.\n\nHere are some helpful tips to overcome common design challenges and create a happy and functional room for your young roommates.\n\nCreating a Boy and Girl Shared Room\n\nDesigning a room for a brother and a sister doesn’t have to be challenging. In fact, it’s probably the easiest challenge to overcome when planning a shared room.\n\nYour first step is to select an underlying color palette for the main elements of the room (walls, rug, furniture) that is gender neutral…and, if they’re old enough to chime in, that each sibling gives the thumbs up. Color combos such as white and grey, turquoise and white or a mix of primary colors work well for both boys and girls.\n\nTo complement your underlying palette, layer complementary colors and patterns on top of that. For example in a grey and white room, try accenting with yellow accessories. For patterns, lean towards stripes, chevron or solids with large geometric shape(s).\n\nWhen selecting furniture, opt for furniture with clean lines and that’s non-themed (steer clear of the race car or sleeping beauty beds) and pair with neutral colored essentials such as lamps and window treatments.\n\nThe exciting part of creating a super fun bedroom for your young brood is accessorizing and customizing design elements to match their budding personalities. Select design elements that make the room feel like it belongs to both of them. Personalize accessories throughout the room such as wall art or coat hooks. Marquee lights with their names or first initial add a pop of energy and excitement to any space. Likewise, subtly add gender specific themes in one or two accessories, but keep them color coordinated. For example when accessorizing with red, try a throw pillow with a red fire engine for him, and a pillow with a red flower or heart for her. Storage that is complementary to the design scheme but specific for each gender (think charcoal for boys and yellow for girls) can also seamlessly pull a room together.\n\nCreating a Room For Different Ages\n\nSometimes its not just Jeremy and Sarah that you need to accommodate, but a 3-year-old Jeremy and a 4-month-old Sarah can definitely add another layer of design anxiety.\n\nThe first thing to tackle is the furniture layout. If you have a baby, chances are you’ll be in and out of the room at night to tend to the baby. If possible, place their beds in opposite corners or walls with the crib being most accessible to the door. Obviously structural elements such as windows and heaters can dictate otherwise but your design objective is to give each child the most comfortable night’s sleep without one waking the other.\n\nCreating a play area that both siblings can enjoy, even simultaneously, is super helpful, especially for tired mommies and daddies. Floor mats, cushions and soft larger items like a rocking horse and tents are perfect to outline the area and fun for both to play in. Place your older child’s toys in accessible storage containers, but higher than the floor so your youngest can’t easily touch it.\n\nFor example, whether it’s a bookshelf, storage cube or wall unit, place baby friendly toys and items on the lower shelves. Your toddler or older child can stand and reach for the basket of Lego.\n\nIncorporate elements that show your children their growing family. Photos of the kids together, framed handprints of when they each were newborns encourage them to appreciate their younger or older sibling while adding a warm family atmosphere to their bedroom.\n\nCreating Ample Storage for Two or More\n\nFinding the space in one room for twice as much furniture and storage is one of the most daunting tasks when designing a shared room. This is where your resourcefulness and editing eye need to kick into high gear. Less is definitely more in a shared bedroom, as is multifunctional and shared design.\n\nAs a baseline, selecting streamlined furniture is essential to keep the room feeling as spacious as possible and allow for storage and playing. If your kids are old enough, bunk beds are always an excellent choice. Whether L-shaped or vertical, a bunk bed is an efficient use of space and oftentimes has built-in storage underneath.\n\nSpeaking of…under the bed storage such as rollaway drawers is always helpful in creating more space and can hold seasonal or limited use items. Storage chests with cushions can be used as a seat to a play table as well as conceal a mountain of toys. A wall unit with drawers can pull double duty as a dresser and desk.\n\nShelving is super convenient for toy organization as it doesn’t take up a lot of space and can be placed above dressers, desks, even above the door for hardly used items. Similarly, placing a bookshelf at the foot of the bed doesn’t take up valuable wall space and may even give you another surface near the bed for a lamp or nighttime book.\n\nFor clothing, wall and door hooks are helpful for every-day go-to items. In the closet, install two rods (i.e. double hanging) so each child can have separate hanging space.\n\nRegardless of your design challenge, when creating a shared room for your little ones if you stick to resourceful, efficient, fun and creative choices, you’ll no doubt create a bedroom your kids will love!\n\nHow are you going to design your kids’ bedroom?\n\nCreative Shared Bedroom Ideas Kids\n\n24 Feb 2016\n\n+\n\nPOP ART Apartment Therapy\n\nHAUS’ Broad Ripple Bungalow POP ART Apartment Therapy featured in article.

Now, some homeowners are asking designers to reimagine them as versatile spaces. Photo: Drew Kelly for The Wall Street Journal\n\nBy ALINA DIZIK\n\nUpdated Aug. 20, 2015 1:53 p.m. ET\n\n15 COMMENTS\n\nWhen Gary Loeb and David Fraze host a party in their 1897 Elizabethan home in San Francisco, many guests barely get past the front door. Instead they gather inside the wood-paneled foyer, which has 16-foot ceilings, an original fireplace and a vintage rug. “A lot of people just spend half the party standing in the foyer,” says Mr. Loeb, a 46-year-old executive for a health technology firm.\n\nLong the doormat of home design, entryways and hallways are often an afterthought for home buyers, who typically spend their money on other rooms. In a recent survey at The Wall Street Journal’s request, 46% of respondents on home-design website Houzz.com said hallways are the most overlooked spaces when decorating a home.\n\nNow, irked by what they see as wasted space, some homeowners are asking designers to reimagine entryways as versatile spaces that double as dining rooms, dens and entertaining spaces. “People are not just hanging art on the walls and walking through,” says Jennifer Roberts, an associate broker with the Fisher Roberts team at Engel & Völkers in New York.\n\nWhen renovating their Sacramento, Calif., home, Randy Reynoso and Martin Camsey removed part of a wall to open up the entryway and create a homey feel where the two would want to linger. The long staircase in their Monterey Colonial-style home now has a custom wrought-iron railing and a vintage French chandelier that can be mechanically lowered for cleaning. The foyer also includes a powder room, and shelving in a seating area holds Longfellow’s “The Song of Hiawatha” and other vintage tomes from Mr. Reynoso’s great-grandmother’s library. “We reimagined what [the foyer] would look like in 1928,” when the house was built, said Mr. Reynoso, a 57-year-old financial institution executive who worked with local interior designer Curtis Popp on the project. He estimates the foyer cost about $35,000 to create.\n\nModern, open-plan architecture poses a particular challenge for clients looking to bring back that Old World grandeur of entrances, says Gisue Hariri, co-founder of an architecture and interior-design firm in New York. “Historically, entrances were very much celebrated,” says Ms. Hariri. “In general, we try to make sure these neglected areas do make a comeback.”\n\nIn newer condos that lack formal entryways, Ms. Hariri suggests a partial wall to create an intimate space with a gallery feel when walking in the front door. For a client in Manhattan’s Sutton Place neighborhood, she created a wall that features a modern mural of walking figures by artist Julian Opie. Other wall designs by Ms. Hariri also include hidden storage—a way to keep clutter to a minimum without adding extra furniture.\n\nIn Indianapolis, Phil Salsbery created a false hallway using cabinetry with hidden, built-in storage. The new corridor allows access to the master bedroom without cutting through the living room, where someone may be relaxing and watching television. The hallway cabinets provide much-needed storage space, since the condo has many floor-to-ceiling windows, says Mr. Salsbery, 52-years-old and owner of an investment firm. He also worked with designer Chris Short to create a circular entryway, with a blue-lighted ceiling, that leads to the false hallway. “It creates a spectacular entrance that cuts the harshness of the angles” in the home, says Mr. Salsbery, who estimates that he spent $50,000 on building out the hallway and foyer.\n\nMs. Roberts, the New York broker, says sellers see more value in homes where transitional spaces have been put to work. A recent buyer turned the hallway between a two bedrooms into a den with a television. She has also seen homes where owners used a spacious entryway for formal dining. When selling a home, Ms. Roberts tells clients to be more creative when showing off their foyers and hallways. “You should definitely stage it so people can see how they should be utilizing it,” she says.\n\nRegardless how foyers are used, they still need to make a good first impression. Melody Adhami, a 34-year-old who runs a mobile-app agency, says the foyer in her Toronto home is the one room that’s off limits to her two young children. The space is often used for side conversations when guests come over and has an oversize velvet ottoman and art created from metal disks, along with a console table for a wow factor when guests enter, she says. “It’s not necessarily used by the kids, so we could do nicer things,” says Ms. Adhami, who worked with designer Ines Mazzotta but declined to disclose costs.\n\nPamela O’Banion, a 62-year-old homemaker, wanted to create a sense of surprise when guests entered her 1,500-square-foot Nob Hill condo with views of San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge. First, she and her designer, Matthew Turner, closed up several doorways that led to other rooms and painted the walls a dark green to better define the entryway. Then they added dimly lighted sconces, a woven Versailles-style parquet floor and gilded furniture for a sense of romance. In all, the entryway project cost about $50,000.\n\n“I wanted [visitors] to think they were walking into a jewel box,” she says.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications:\n\nJennifer Roberts is an associate broker with the Fisher Roberts team at Engel & Völkers in New York.
