        "text": "Latest Books on Amazon:\n\nVivekananda the man Who Brought Hinduism to America - edited and introduced by Tim Dalgleish\n\nThis short account of Swami Vivekananda, the Vedantist who brought Hinduism to America, focuses on the years 1893 to 1897. After a famous speech at the World’s Columbian Exposition of 1893, Vivekananda promoted his religious beliefs and practices by lecturing extensively across the United States, teaching and attracting devotees, producing a wealth of publications and tracts on Hinduism, encouraging vegetarianism, writing the first book on yoga to appear in America and so on, for a new and enthusiastic audience.\n\nThis book draws together letters, memoirs and other writings from a wide array of his admirers (and some detractors), including Ella Wheeler Wilcox, Annie Besant, Emma Calvé and Caroline K. Sherman. Also included are contemporary newspaper reports and commentary.\n\nCreating The Life of Paul Dresser\n\nIn November 1923, Max Ehrmann, the poet and author of the underground classic Desiderata, interviewed Theodore Dreiser, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature. For two days they discussed the life of Paul Dresser the composer of On the Banks of the Wabash, one of the best-selling songs of the nineteenth century. When Dresser died in 1906 his fame had faded, he was a penniless alcoholic. Ehrmann was determined to rehabilitate the image and memory of one of America’s finest songwriters. This book explores the background to Ehrmann’s quest, his relationship with Dreiser and the consequences of their meeting in Washington.\n\n​\n\nThe Crime of the Congo - edited and introduced ​by Tim Dalgleish\n\nConan Doyle's political and humanitarian campaigning with relation to the Congo was not an isolated incident nor out of character for the creator of the world's most famous detective. In tandem with my work as a playwright and narrator of several books on the Holocaust, I introduce Conan Doyle's outraged polemic using contemporary newspaper articles to give additional context to the genocidal crimes committed in King Léopold's name.\n\n​'Ten million people had been murdered. For fifteen years, atrocities had been perpetrated by King Leopold II of Belgium and his Force Publique in the Congo Free State. By 1909, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle could stand it no longer...'\n\n​\n\nThe Three Hearts of the Octopus\n\nThis new volume of essays includes pieces on: meeting the film director Ken Loach, contemporary artist Shelly Wyn-de-Bank, literary figures Alan Moore the graphic novelist, Primo Levi, Anaïs Nin, George Orwell, Arthur Koestler, Robert Bolt, and more..."
