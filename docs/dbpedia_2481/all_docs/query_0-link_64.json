        "text": "When visitors see “Beauty in a War Torn World,” a new exhibition at Memphis Botanic Garden this month, they will glimpse a piece of Mid-South history that may come as a surprise — the existence of two Japanese-American internment camps that operated in Jerome and Rohwer, Arkansas, during World War II.\n\nThe photographs and artwork on display March 5-31 at Memphis Botanic Garden offer a two-fold purpose. One collection features approximately 30 black-and-white photographs taken from 1942 to 1945 by professor Paul Faris (1905-1989) that capture camp life at the Rohwer Relocation Center and the Japanese Americans who produced artwork while incarcerated there.\n\nThe second collection highlights the intricate watercolors, letters, diaries, and furniture designs created by Memphian Floy Hanson (1878-1951). This talented artist’s sophisticated knowledge of Japanese art helped facilitate an exhibition at Hendrix College in 1944 by one of the incarcarees, Japanese painter Henry Sugimoto.\n\nThe current show is curated by Sarah Wilkerson Freeman, a history professor at Arkansas State University who has been researching the lives of Faris and Hanson and the Japanese. “My aim is to shine a light on their work,” says Freeman.\n\nexhibit origins\n\nWhen Freeman initially met with Mary Ann (Faris) Thurmond and Eliot (Tim) Faris several years ago, they presented a huge, well-documented collection of negatives. Thousands of photographs had been taken by their father, Paul Faris, a professor of English and photography at Hendrix College in Conway, Arkansas, where he worked from 1928 until his retirement in 1971.\n\n“Our father taught photography, so he was always developing pictures at the house,” says Thurmond. “His darkroom was really the heart of our home.”\n\nHis photographs largely depicted rural life in Arkansas: landscapes, cotton production, homestead cabins, and craftsmen, as well as newsworthy events at the college. Some work was even published nationally by Life magazine and The New York Times. When Freeman encountered the 100+ images Faris shot in July 1945 during a visit to the Rohwer Relocation Center, however, she recognized their historic significance. The material was strengthened by the oral histories his wife, Ann Faris, wrote about each resident they photographed.\n\nOf particular interest to Professor Freeman was a picture that featured Henry Sugimoto encircled by several faculty members. In the center was a handsome, self-possessed woman. Who was she? Freeman wondered. This was her introduction to Floy Hanson, a gallery director at Hendrix College during the 1940s, whose expertise in Japanese art helped to bring Sugimoto and his work to the college.\n\nTo understand the audacity of such an invitation, however, one must know something about the climate of the internment period.\n\nThe internment camps of Arkansas\n\nFollowing the bombing of Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, authorizing the removal “of all people from military areas.” Fueled by decades of racial intolerance and worry about national security, a wave of anti-Japanese hysteria crested in the spring of 1942. Since 80 percent of the Japanese lived on the West Coast, the region was declared a military area, forcing the incarceration of Japanese Americans residing there, many of whom were U.S. citizens.\n\nGovernment notices began appearing in Japanese neighborhoods ordering residents to report to assembly centers. Some received less than two weeks’ notice as they scrambled to get their personal affairs in order, leaving behind homes, farms, and treasured keepsakes they would never see again. Parents arrived with children in tow, carrying but a single suitcase, uncertain of what the future held.\n\nThrough that summer and fall, more than 110,000 Japanese Americans were relocated to internment camps built by the U.S. military. Most were in the West, but two camps were located in the Delta, at Jerome and Rohwer, Arkansas (110 miles southeast of Little Rock).\n\nArmy barracks were hastily assembled at the sites, eventually housing some 16,000 Japanese Americans from September 18, 1942, to November 30, 1945. Upon arriving, families were settled in empty barracks, given a single room “apartment,” and issued one cot per person, three blankets, and a pot-bellied stove.\n\nTheirs was a life interrupted.\n\nShining a light on injustice\n\nThe building of the internment camps made headlines in Arkansas and sparked conversation at Hendrix College, a private, liberal arts school where several art faculty decided to visit Jerome in 1943. There, Floy Hanson and Elsie Freund met Henry Sugimoto, an artist who had been trained and shown in California and France. Sugimoto was interned at Jerome (and later Rohwer) with his wife, Susie, and 6-year-old daughter, Sumile Madeleine.\n\nIn an unpublished manuscript, Ann Faris wrote, “When Henry Sugimoto realized there would be minimal photographic record of the Japanese American internment experience, he changed his artistic style and began in secret to create what he called “documentary paintings” — works that depicted incarceration from a resident’s point of view.”\n\nThough he worried that his artwork would be considered subversive, camp administrators granted permission for him to continue. When Hanson and Freund saw the paintings, they, too, encouraged him.\n\nAt the college’s invitation, Sugimoto and his family traveled to Hendrix in February 1944, where he showed 15 works. Faris photographed the event, and Hendrix purchased one painting, Arrival at Jerome, a beautiful portrait which still hangs at the school today.\n\nThe Farises later traveled to Rohwer in July 1945, on assignment for folk art expert Allen H. Eaton. The author was gathering material for his book, Beauty Behind Barbed Wire: The Arts of the Japanese in Our War Relocation Camps (Harper & Brothers, 1952). With Sugimoto as his guide, the couple attended an arts exhibition at the camp and stayed several days, capturing the range of traditional arts being produced at Rohwer. The spartan conditions made waste unthinkable, and items such as gunnysacks and cardboard were recycled into things of beauty. The creation of art brought balance and peace.\n\nFaris’ photographs, which are artfully lit and well-produced, show Japanese doing ikebana, a spiritual form of flower arranging; kobu, the collection and burnishing of unusually shaped cypress knees; calligraphy, sculpture, and wood carving. As Paul shot, his wife, Ann, who did feature writing for the Arkansas Gazette, took oral histories from the residents, providing details about their lives and how they coped with internment and loss. Some of their work was published in Eaton’s book.\n\nMary Ann and Tim consider their parents quiet activists, doing what they could to shine a light on intolerance and injustice. “Mom and Dad’s arms were always open,” says Thurmond. Living with those photographs, many of which decorate her home, Thurmond is reminded of how the Japanese Americans “created a life of creativity and joy in the midst of a terrible thing that had been done to them.”\n\nJapanese-American author Delphine Hirasuna refers to this as “the art of gaman” — the patient endurance of the unbearable.\n\nExamining the work of Floy Hanson\n\nAs a highly trained visual artist, Floy Hanson spent time studying and living in New York City and Kyoto, Japan, before eventually joining Hendrix College in 1940. What a shock the war and internment must have been to her.\n\nHanson was part of a coterie of college-educated women during the early twentieth century in the Mid-South that included educator Mary Grimes Hutchison (the founder of Hutchison School), Nan Halliburton (the mother of travel writer Richard Halliburton), art instructor Jessie Clough, and Floy’s sister, musician Etta Hanson. Lovers of art and culture and travel, their knowledge of the world would have been decidedly broader than most of their era.\n\nHanson met her mentor and lifelong collaborator, Jessie Clough, at the esteemed college preparatory for young ladies, The Higbee School, where Clough taught art. Hanson graduated as Higbee’s valedictorian in 1897. She continued her education at Chicago Institute of Art and Columbia University Teachers College, where she was heavily influenced by Arthur Dow, a leading figure in the pre-World War I Arts and Crafts revival.\n\nDow’s emphasis on Japanese-inspired appreciation of nature and the notion that art should be both pictorial and decorative would shape Hanson’s work. While in New York during the teens and 1920s, she designed handsome wood furniture with Jessie “overseeing the construction of textiles for Floy’s couches and chairs,” notes Bill Short, associate director of Barret Library at Rhodes College, where Hanson’s work now resides.\n\nPictures of her furniture designs and watercolor paintings shown in the exhibit belie her aesthetic. Expertly crafted, her symmetrical designs reference nature themes in a muted palette of greens, ocre, and mauve.\n\nUltimately, Floy and Clough assembled an 1,100-piece collection they used to study and teach art and design that included Italian and French brocades from the eighteenth century, Japanese woodblock prints, lacquerwork, obi textiles, and other objects from foreign lands. In 1950, Floy established the Jessie L. Clough Art Memorial for Teaching at Rhodes College, creating a trust in honor of her mentor. The collection is still in use today as a teaching tool for the arts and humanities. Short plans to reorganize the collection with information Freeman’s research is bringing to light."
