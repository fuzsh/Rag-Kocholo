        "text": "This site was once owned by Moses W. Hall and Leonard Farnham, both shoemakers, who had their garden on a portion of the lot. These men sold a small portion ti the Inhabitants of the newly created Village School District in 1829. The district built their first schoolhouse on this site, a one room structure, with a hip roof, which is shown on two drawings of Andover in 1856 and 1882. The school operated at this location until 1851 when a new and large building was constructed at 27 Cuba St. The lot and building were auctioned of, and Jacob Chickering was the highest bidder.\n\nChickering held the property until December 4, 1861 selling to David Johnson. It is unlikely that Chickering added a second floor to the schoolhouse as he had shifted his business to Piano manufacturing by 1850. The valuation of the property is also the same $200. in 1860. David Johnson, may have added the second story on the old schoolhouse, or built a completely new structure. By 1870 the property has doubled in value.\n\nEliza Johnson sells on February 28, 1882 to Alexander Lamont. A Birds Eye View of Andover 1882 still shows a one story hip roof structure at this site.\n\nMarch 27, 1829 – Book 253 leaf 71 – Salem Registry of Deeds\n\nMoses W. Hall and Leonard Farnham, both cordwainers, (shoemakers) sell land to the Inhabitants of the Village School District for $50. Land; on northeast corner of road (Shawsheen Rd.) at corner of Farnham and Damon’s garden – then southwest by garden wall 90.42’ to SW corner of garden – then NW by garden 30’ to stake & stones – SW 44’ by our own land to a stake& stones – then SE by our land 71’ to a stake & stones – NE 135.3’ by our land to road – NW by road 41.25’ to first bound. Total about 25 +/- rods – Reserving the right to laying a road (Cuba St.) across the easterly part of the land to pass to our land.\n\nThis parcel of land included about half of the property at #26 Shawsheen Rd and 71’ back from the road at #3 Cuba Street creating an “L” shaped lot.\n\nThe Village District was created on November 28, 1828 when the South Centre District was divided into three separate school districts, the Phillips District being the other new school district created. The Village District voted to build a wooden schoolhouse on May 12, 1829. They pay a Mr. Clements $330. on February 22, 1830, presumably for its construction. March 27, 1829 – Book 253 leaf 71 – Essex County Registry of Deeds, Salem - Moses W. Hall and Leonard Farnham, both cordwainers, (shoemakers) sell land to the Inhabitants of the Village School District for $50. “Land; on northeast corner of road (Shawsheen Rd.) at corner of Farnham and Damon’s garden – then southwest by garden wall 90.42’ to SW corner of garden – then NW by garden 30’ to stake & stones – SW 44’ by our own land to a stake & stones – then SE by our land 71’ to a stake & stones – NE 135.3’ by our land to road – NW by road 41.25’ to first bound. Total about 25 +/- rods – Reserving the right to laying a road (Cuba St.) across the easterly part of the land to pass to our land.”\n\nThis parcel of land included about half of the property at #26 Shawsheen Rd and 71’ back from the road at #3 Cuba Street creating an “L” shaped lot.\n\nIn 1832 the schoolhouse is painted red with white trim. No record of its size is given but the school was one room, heated by a stove and may have had a hip roof. On April 11, 1851 the district voted to build a larger schoolhouse on a new site. They purchase land from Abiel Russel for $300. This is now the site of the playground on Cuba Street. The old schoolhouse, privy and stove was auctioned off, selling for $203.\n\nOctober 8, 1851 – Book 464 leaf 156 Salem Registry of Deeds\n\nVillage School District sells the land to Jacob Chickering, a housewright, for $200.\n\nIt is the same lot dimensions as above. Chickering is a well known house builder in Andover and many homes have been attributed to him. He was also a Piano-Forte Manufacturer.\n\nJuly 15, 1852 – Book 464 leaf 158 Salem Registry of Deeds. Jacob Chickering, Piano-forte manufacturer purchases land from James & Ann Crooper and Samuel & Isabella Anderson for $52.31. (Ann & Isabella are sisters, daughters of Isaac Howarth, who inherited the land.) – On the road from the Widow A. Marland to the house of Amos Abbott 2nd. (Cuba Street – Marland’s house is #31 Shawsheen Rd. and Abbott’s house is 51 Red Spring Rd.) - beginning at the SW corner of the road then N 40° W to land of Grantors 236.9’ to stake and stones by land of Deacon Peter Smith, then N 60 ¾° E 58.7’ & N 66 ¼ ° E by land of Smith as the wall stands 45.5’ to land of the estate of Abraham Marland, then S 27 ¾° E by land of Marland 166.3’ as the wall stands to other land of Chickering S 62 ½° W 44.22’ and S 27 ¾° E 58’ by land of Chickering to road 9.9’ to first bound about 55 8/10 sq. rods.\n\nWith this purchase Chickering expands the lot width on Cuba St. by 10 feet, the current driveway area of #3 Cuba, and the majority of the lot behind the house. We believe that Chickering built the house as it is marked on the 1852 Andover map. Chickering’s home & business were located 33 Essex St. so the Cuba St. house may have been investment\n\nproperty. The 1860 Real estate valuation of his properties in the Centre District include, Dwelling house, barn & land $2600, carpenters shop $250, Steam Mill $3000, Long shop $600, Old schoolhouse $200, Lumber houses $100, Wardwell’s house and land $400. for a total of $7150.\n\nDecember 4, 1861 – Book 630, leaf 79 Salem Registry of Deeds.\n\nJacob Chickering sells to David Johnson. 1870 Real estate valuation in the West District gives Johnson’s house at $400 and the land $100.\n\nFebruary 28, 1882 – Book 67, page 377 North Essex Registry of Deeds, Lawrence\n\nEliza Johnson, William & Elizabeth Doughty sell to Alexander Lamont.
