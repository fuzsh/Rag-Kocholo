        "text": "Week 11 was about the composer of our state song, Paul Dresser. Dresser was raised in Terre Haute and, at the urging of his father, attended St. Meinrad’s Seminary for two years to become a priest. He quickly realized that priesthood was not for him and left the seminary to pursue a life of the road with a traveling medicine show. Dresser performed songs to entertain the crowds that gathered around the medicine show and gained popularity as an entertainer and singer. This life on the road led him to some trouble and he spend some short stints in jail along the way.\n\nin 1894 he became a silent partner in a music publishing firm and was wrote nearly 50 songs between 1886 and 1893. His popularity exploded nationwide and even globally when he wrote what would become the state song of Indiana, “On the Banks of the Wabash Far Way”, in 1897. Although his song is truly the state song of Indiana, the song “Back Home Again in Indiana” which borrowed some lyrics and notes from Dresser’s song is more widely thought to be the state song due to it’s popularity and use at the Indianapolis 500 race.\n\nOver his short lifetime, Dresser wrote and published 106 songs, but due to poor investments and his extravagant lifestyle, he died penniless in the home of his sister in New York in 1906.\n\nDresser’s life story was portrayed in the 1942 popular film “My Gal Sal”.\n\nWeek 11 sculpture was a relief sculpture of Paul Dresser and the hunt took place at Fairbank’s Park which is the modern day location of Dresser’s boyhood home. Here are the winners from week 11!\n\nThe sculpture was found by Shaun Hussey and his daughter Sophia (upper left), the first coin was found by Jeremy and Jessica Johnson and family (lower left), the second coin was found by Trevor Bridgewater, Stefani Pichonnat and her daughter Julie (lower right), and the third coin was found by Joe Syester (upper right). Congratulations to all hunters and I’m glad you joined the hunt!\n\nWeek 10 clues were about Josephus Collett. Collett was a well known and successful financier in the area with investments ranging from a pork packing facility to railroads. He was also a great humanitarian, forming the Collett Home for orphans and assisting Chauncey Rose with the Rose Children’s Home among other charitable works. He also served as president of the board of Rose Poly Technic (Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology).\n\nIn 1883, Collett donated the 21 acre Barbour Woods property to the city to form the first city park – Collet Park. Collett’s investments stretched across the country with railroad holdings as far away as Texas and a partnership in 1885 with other investors to build the Hotel del Cornonado in San Diego which is, to this day, one of the most famous hotels in California visited by the wealthy and celebrities alike.\n\nCollett lived most of his years in this area in the Terre Haute House and was known to have kept the largest private library in the area and also the largest archaeological and geological collection in the U.S. at that time. He died in 1893.\n\nThe hunt took place in Collet Park. The sculpture was a chipmunk – a nod to the wildlife in the park and in thanks to Mr. Josephus Collett for providing our first city park. Here are the winners from week 10!\n\nThe sculpture went home with Sophia and Shaun Hussey (Bottom right), coin 1 was found by the family of Jeremy Johnson (upper left) and coin 2 was found by Joe Syester (bottom left). No hunter ever claimed coin 3…. hmmmm. It could still be out there! Congratulations to all hunters and I’m glad you joined the hunt!\n\nWeek 9 clues were about Friedrich J. Biel. The sculpture was a bust of the harlequin, Punch, that stood at the doors of Biel’s cigar store for more than 50 years.\n\nBiel was a Prussian born in 1843 and migrated to America in 1854. He moved to Terre Haute in 1861 and, in 1866, opened his cigar store in downtown Terre Haute. Over the years the store was located in three different store fronts, but all were between 4th and 5th street on Wabash.\n\nIn 1866, Biel commissioned a sculptor in New York City to carve to wooden figures – Punch and his companion Judy – for this storefront. Punch and Judy were well known puppet characters of the day from a British humor magazine. Punch was carved from the mast of an old ship and arrived in Terre Haute to take his post at the cigar store in 1867. The sculptor died before he could complete Punch’s companion, Judy.\n\nRumors were heard around town that Punch was taken on many tours around town including some of the saloons in the area. He became a beloved figure in the city. Fredrich Biel was also well liked as an area businessman and also was elected to serve on the City Council. He died in 1917. Punch can be seen in person at the Vigo County Historical Museum.\n\nHere are week 9 winners! There were some errors in my clues, but the family of Jeremy and Jessica Johnson persevered and prevailed, taking home the sculpture (top), there were only two coins in week 9 and both families were new to the hunt! The Toney family found coin 1 (lower left). The family of Rachel Davis took home coin 2 (lower right). Congratulations to all of the week 9 winners and I’m glad you joined the hunt!"
