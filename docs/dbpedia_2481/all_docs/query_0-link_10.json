        "text": "The following is an archived discussion of a featured article nomination. Please do not modify it. Subsequent comments should be made on the article's talk page or in Wikipedia talk:Featured article candidates. No further edits should be made to this page.\n\nThe article was not promoted by SandyGeorgia 23:10, 23 January 2010 [1].\n\nNominator(s): —Charles Edward (Talk | Contribs)\n\nFeatured article candidates/On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away/archive1\n\nFeatured article candidates/On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away/archive2\n\nI am nominating this for featured article because after significant research, several copy edits, and a successful GA review, I feel this article now meets the FA criteria. —Charles Edward (Talk | Contribs)\n\nComments:\n\nI am confused by \"Theodore Dresser\" in the lead. Was this his real name and \"Dreiser\" a nom-de-plume? It's not relevant to the main thrust of this article, but since you've brought Theodore in, a brief explanation is necessary.\n\nPaul changed the spelling of his last name to Dresser to Americanize it. I thought it was a bit off topic so I just stuck with the original spelling in the article. I've made a footnote for this. —Charles Edward (Talk | Contribs)\n\n\"Composure and popularity\" heading. \"Composure\" is wrong word here, should be \"Composition\"\n\nFixed —Charles Edward (Talk | Contribs)\n\n\"and published it in fall\" - needs to be \"the fall\"\n\nfixed. - I changed it to the month. —Charles Edward (Talk | Contribs)\n\n\"chained dollars\": you need to include in his article some reliable source which provides the justification for this method. The link to a Wikipedia article is not sufficient\n\nThere is nothing in the sources that adjust the dollar amount for inflation, I thought it might be useful to the reader though. I have removed it. —Charles Edward (Talk | Contribs)\n\nRe Theodore: \"parts of the song's content reflect his writing style.\" Which parts have the sources identified?\n\nI added a line pointing out what the source says as a connection. —Charles Edward (Talk | Contribs)\n\nAre \"Indiana\" and \"Back Home Again in Indiana\" the same song?\n\nThey are, I attempted to shorten it to \"Indiana\" to make the sentences less wieldly when I was coming it \"Wabash\". Do you think I should just use the full title? Or perhaps put (Indiana) after my first mention of the song? —Charles Edward (Talk | Contribs)\n\nForeign language sources (No. [20]) should give the language, in this case presumably Swedish\n\nDone —Charles Edward (Talk | Contribs)\n\nNotes show citations to \"Loving\" and \"Lovering\", sources list just \"Loving\"\n\nFixed, Loving is correct. —Charles Edward (Talk | Contribs)\n\nA couple of image points (this does not constitute a full image review)\n\nFile:Wabashsheetmusic.jpg: Described in the infobox as \"Sheet music cover 1897\". In the image description the year is 1898.\n\nI do not have a copy of the sheet music cover, only some photos in my books. The date of the images is not listed, but I presume (but am not certain) that the year would be 1897 I will change them both to be \"c. 1897\". —Charles Edward (Talk | Contribs)\n\nFile:Paul_Dresser,_1897.jpg: Is the source the same sheet music as depicted in the earlier image? The publisher's name and location should be given.\n\nI have fixed this as well. I made a copy off a reprint in a book. I have noted that as well. —Charles Edward (Talk | Contribs)\n\nBrianboulton (talk)\n\nThanks for your review. —Charles Edward (Talk | Contribs)\n\nSource comments Everything fine. RB88 (T)\n\nQuestion I was doing some research on JSTOR to check the comprehensiveness of this article and I came across about 20 articles that mention this song. Have you read these? One looked quite interesting - it had a lot more details about copyright than are contained in the Wikipedia article. Awadewit (talk)\n\nNo I have not read those articles, but would be interested in doing so. The majority of the article is based off two book , one with a whole chapter dedicated to the song, and information available from the Indiana historical society and Indiana historical bureau. There was a significant fight over the plagerism, but it fizzled out and never really got anywhere. I made a search of JSTOR but didn't find anything that looked promising or as useful as the sources I already had. Could you give me a link? —Charles Edward (Talk | Contribs)\n\nI've skimmed the 23 hits. Here are ones that I thought would be the most relevant. Let me know if you would like me to send them to you:\n\nDanish Emigrant Ballads and Songs. By Rochelle Wright and Robert L. Wright. Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1983. - Explains that Danish songs were influenced by \"On the Banks of the Wabash\"\n\nLisa Gitelman, \"Reading Music, Reading Records, Reading Race: Musical Copyright and the U. S. Copyright Act of 1909\", The Musical Quarterly Vol. 81, No. 2 (Summer, 1997), pp. 265-290 - Copyright of the song\n\nBarry Maine, \"U.S.A.: Dos Passos and the Rhetoric of History\" South Atlantic Review Vol. 50, No. 1 (Jan., 1985), pp. 75-86 - How the song was used in newsreels\n\nGayle Sherwood, \"Questions and Veracities: Reassessing the Chronology of Ives's Choral Works\" The Musical Quarterly, Vol. 78, No. 3 (Autumn, 1994), pp. 429-447 - This indicates that Ives wrote a parody of the song, but says nothing about it. Have you found any other information about the parody?\n\nI hope this is helpful. Awadewit (talk)\n\nThe first one looks like it would be useful for expanding the adaptations section. The others sound only marginally so. —Charles Edward (Talk | Contribs)\n\nYou've read them? The one on copyright has some interesting information not in the article and the one which mentions its use in newsreels is a good example of how the song was used and contains an explication of the song's lyrics. Awadewit (talk)\n\nNo I haven't yet. I am sorry, I was just judging by the titles you gave me. I will try to read over them all this evening and see what I can glean. Thanks for the info though! —Charles Edward (Talk | Contribs)\n\nOh, sorry, I should have been clearer when I posted the list - I've actually read these, so I know there's useful info there. :) Awadewit (talk)\n\nI checked them out, but unfortunately I do not have a JSTOR account, so all I can read is the first pages. I've also checked my library catalog and these books are not available there either. I have checked out a few other places, like google scholar, but and finding the same situation where I can only view the first page. The sources I have go into more detail on the copyright fight between Dresser's estate at the plagiarizers, I could expand it if you feel the article is lacking in that area. 02:10, 23 January 2010 (UTC)\n\nI do have access to JSTOR, so I can send them to you, if you want. Let me know. Awadewit (talk)\n\nIf you can, I would appreciate it. Can you do it by email? —Charles Edward (Talk | Contribs)\n\nSure, just email first. I can't attach documents to Wikipedia emails, but once you email, I can reply with the attachments. Awadewit (talk)\n\nSupport having previously reviewed and copyedited the article. Great job again!
