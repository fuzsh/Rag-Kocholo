A car, empty except for crew members, collided with another car carrying passengers from Bluffton to the Fort Wayne County Fair. Upon impact, the emptier car rode atop the full car, ripping the top off of it.\n\nBecause of Kingsland's remoteness, no physician was available to treat the victims, and train cars could not transport doctors until an hour and a half after the crash that took the lives of over forty passengers. Survivor John Boyd recalled, \"There was a splintering crush, a dull, grinding as wood and iron resolved themselves into a mass of wreckage and mingled themselves with human blood and flesh and bones.\" A 2014 Indy Star article noted that a crash investigation found that dispatchers failed to monitor the extra cars on the track that day.\n\nLearn more with their Indiana state historical marker: Kingsland Interurban Wreck.\n\nIimage showing the scene of the wreck, courtesy of the Indiana Historical Society.\n\nNewspapers.com clipping\n\nNewspapers.com clipping\n\n1910, October 23 - Blanche Stuart Scott became the first American woman to make a solo public flight when she flew across the Fort Wayne Driving Association's field.\n\n1910 - Miss Scott Makes Bow to Public, Clipped from The Fort Wayne Journal-Gazette, 24 October 1910, Monday, page 1.

Despite reports to the contrary, Lysol was aggressively marketed to women as safe and gentle. Once cresol was replaced with ortho-hydroxydiphenyl in the formula, Lysol was pushed as a germicide good for cleaning toilet bowls and treating ringworm, and Lehn & Finkâs, the company that made the disinfectant, continued to market it as safeguard for womenâs âdainty feminine allure. As if that wasn’t bad enough, Lysol isn’t even an effective contraceptive.â\n\nMarch 13, 2023 post by Smithsonian Magazine on Facebook:\n\nThe campaign made Lysol the best-selling method of contraception during the Great Depression.\n\nLysolâs Vintage Ads Subtly Pushed Women to Use Its Disinfectant as Birth ControlAs if that wasnât bad enough, Lysol isnât even an effective contraceptive, Rose Eveleth, Contributor September 30, 2013 at SmithsonianMagazine.com.\n\nThese ads arenât frightening women into thinking their genitals smell badly. According to historian Andrea Tone, âfeminine hygieneâ was a euphemism. Birth control was illegal in the U.S. until 1965 (for married couples) and 1972 (for single people). These Lysol ads are actually for contraception. The campaign made Lysol the best-selling method of contraception during the Great Depression.\n\n1911, May 20\n\nNWS Northern Indiana Twitter photo\n\nAt 7:00 AM on Saturday, May 20th, 1911, the first official weather observation in Fort Wayne’s history was taken on the southeast corner of Berry and Calhoun Streets.

July 4, 1912, will hereafter be memorable to the citizens of Fort Wayne and Allen county. On that day Albert and Charles Loch- ner uncovered the grave of Little Turtle, the great Miami war chief. The brothers had contracted to build a house for Dr. George W. Gillie on Lawton place, and in digging the cellar uncovered several Indian graves. Noticing that whatever was in the graves was appropriated by the laborers, the contractors called off the crew and with the assistance of Dr. George W. Gillie dug the drain in which the grave of Little Turtle was found. The finders had no idea of the identity of the body. The skull was carefully kept and presented to Dr. M. W. Ivins, dentist at 1118 Rivermet avenue, who had requested the Lochner brothers to save a good specimen for him. The balance of the remains were scattered and carried away by the curious as mementos.

This trend began when women began using cotton flour sacks to make dresses and shirts for their children.\n\n~Farm families were known for being creative and using what they had. Women would use feed sacks and flour bags to make dresses, underwear, towels, curtains, quilts, and other household necessities.\n\n~Flour sack dresses were a way for rural women to show off their fashion sense while being frugal. Women continued to sew garments out of feed sacks through the 1930s until World War 2, when production of cotton feed sacks was largely converted to paper bags. **I'll be posting some photos of dresses made with flour sacks in the near future.\n\nThe Ladies' Home Journal 1913-01: Vol 30 Iss 1 on Archive.org\n\nThey have over 1,870 issues of Ladies' Home Journal\n\nSewing with Cotton Bags Sewing with Cotton Bags.

They awarded prizes for the best clothing made from feed sacks, These contests continued into the early 1960s.\n\nFebruary 5, 2024 post by A Daily Dose of History of Facebook:\n\nWhen I was a boy, I remember my mother remarking that when she was growing up she wore dresses that her mother made out of feed sacks. I imagined her wearing burlap dresses with the name of our local feed store printed on them. The reality of feed sack fabric is more interesting.\n\nIn the mid to late 19th century cotton sacks began replacing barrels as feed containers. Homemakers werenât going to let that cotton go to waste, so they used it to make quilts and undergarments. At that time the sacks were plain and usually had a brand name printed on them. They would not have made attractive dresses.\n\nBut manufacturers soon saw a marketing opportunity and in the mid-1920âs they began printing colorful designs on their sacks, making them attractive fabric for pillowcases, dresses and aprons. They pasted paper labels on the sacks, which could be easily removed. With women doing most of the shopping and sewing, fierce competition arose among manufacturers to produce the most desirable fabric for their bags and women buying sacks of flour or feed would have had many attractive options to choose from. People of that time may have wished they could afford âstore-madeâ clothes, but being dressed in feed sack cloth wasnât nearly as awful as it may sound today.\n\nBy the 1960âs paper bags were replacing cloth, and fewer women were making clothes at home. Thus, the days of feed-sack fabric came to an end.\n\n1913, January 1 - Parcel Post began\n\nSeptember 4, 2023 post by the Smithsonian Magazine on Facebook:\n\nJust a few weeks after Parcel Post began, an Ohio couple named Jesse and Mathilda Beagle “mailed” their 8-month-old son James to his grandmother, who lived just a few miles away in Batavia.

The law applied specifically to tenement houses and required landlords to provide adequate ventilation, waste disposal, and fire protection. Bacon’s visits to Indiana slums alerted her to abhorrent housing conditions that facilitated the spread of disease and impacted the welfare of children. She then delivered lectures in nearly every city in Indiana about the need for “’a sanitary measure in the interest of public health, public morals and public safety.’”\n\nAlthough her bill had been defeated twice by the Indiana General Assembly, she mounted a wave of support for the 1913 session. This coalition was comprised of suffragists and womenâs clubs, the State Board of Heath, Commercial Club, Indianapolis News, Anti-Tuberculosis Society, Governor Ralston, prominent businessman Thomas Taggart, and the Housing Association of Indiana. At the height of the Progressive Era, Baconâs bill inspired reformers in other American cities and Canada, who invited her to speak about housing regulation.\n\nWhen Indianapolis News reporters at the statehouse asked her for a reaction to the billâs passage she responded, âJust now I am so desperately tired that all I want is to get home and rest. . . . I just feel relief and gratitude.ââ She noted the bill was âjust the first stepâ and planned to turn her attention to suburban and industrial building conditions.\n\nLearn more about the bill here: A Law to Notice - Richmond Palladium (Daily), Volume 38, Number 95, 1 March 1913\n\nThe image below of Bacon is courtesy of the Library of Congress.\n\n1913, March 10 - the Indiana legislature passed a bill setting the third Friday of April as Arbor Day.

The most common date was the last Friday of October. It is not known why a fall date was chosen over a spring day. ... In 1929, an amendment was passed in the legislature changing the date to the second Friday in April. Due to frequent conflicts with school spring vacations and the fact that Arbor Day occasionally fell on Good Friday, the date was again changed in 1991 to the last Friday of April, corresponding to the official date of the National Arbor Day.

The species lived in enormous migratory flocks until the early 20th century, when hunting and habitat destruction led to its demise. One flock in 1866 in southern Ontario was described as being 1 mi[le] (1.5 km) wide and 300 mi (500 km) long, took 14 hours to pass, and held in excess of 3.5 billion birds. That number, if accurate, would likely represent a large fraction of the entire population at the time. Some estimate 3 to 5 billion Passenger Pigeons were in the United States when Europeans arrived in North America. Others argue the species had not been common in the pre-Columbian period, but their numbers grew when devastation of the American Indian population by European diseases led to reduced competition for food. The species went from being one of the most abundant birds in the world during the 19th century to extinction early in the 20th century. At the time, Passenger Pigeons had one of the largest groups or flocks of any animal, second only to the Rocky Mountain locust.

By 1914 the last remaining pigeon would die... on Audubon.org. Why the Passenger Pigeon Went Extinct And whether it can, and should, be brought back to life a century after it disappeared. by Barry Yeoman, posted May-June 2014 in Audubon Magazine.\n\nThe epic story of why passenger pigeons became extinct and what that says about our current relationship with the natural world. When Europeans arrived in North America, 25 to 40 percent of the continent's birds were passenger pigeons, traveling in flocks so massive as to block out the sun for hours or even days. The downbeats of their wings would chill the air beneath and create a thundering roar that would drown out all other sound. John James Audubon, impressed by their speed and agility, said a lone passenger pigeon streaking through the forest âpasses like a thought.â How prophetic-for although a billion pigeons crossed the skies 80 miles from Toronto in May of 1860, little more than fifty years later passenger pigeons were extinct. The last of the species, Martha, died in captivity at the Cincinnati Zoo on September 1, 1914.

Ralston created the Indiana Committee on Mental Defectives (ICMD) to determine the services and care afforded to “mental defectives” (diagnosed epileptics, the “feebleminded,” and the insane) throughout the state.\n\nAugust 5, 2019 post by Indiana Magazine of History on Facebook.\n\nIn 1915, Governor Samuel M. Ralston created the Indiana Committee on Mental Defectives (ICMD) to determine the services and care afforded to “mental defectives” (diagnosed epileptics, the “feebleminded,” and the insane) throughout the state. At this time, progressive reform and legislation in Indiana focused on dependency, prohibition, and public health, but lawmakers often viewed the care of populations considered mentally defective as burdens, with heavy social and financial costs. The ICMD, then, “appealed to legislators because it offered\n\npotential methods to monitor public health efficiently, to decrease dependency scientifically, and to limit alcohol consumption.”\n\nOne of the ICMD’s goals was to survey the entire state by conducting interviews, administering intelligence tests, and assessing “mental ability.” The committee recruited trained field workers from the Eugenics Record Office in Cold Spring Harbor, New York, a research institution for eugenics and hereditary research, and from the Training School at Vineland, New Jersey, dedicated to the education of individuals with developmental disabilities. The commission conducted three surveys, publishing the final reports in 1916, 1918-19, and 1922. The field workers brought onto the project were almost entirely (except for one man) female.\n\nEdna R. Jatho, one of the field workers, trained as an educator who taught incorrigible, feebleminded, and disabled students. She began working with Indiana populations in 1918 on the ICMD’s second survey. Upon its completion, Jatho returned to Philadelphia to pursue a career in the burgeoning field of psychology. She returned to Indiana in 1921 upon invitation to participate in the final survey for the ICMD. Jatho scored tests, wrote reports, and corresponded with the project administrator. She also spoke to prominent groups and organizations, including the Indiana Academy of Science and the Indiana Conference on Mental Hygiene. Jatho’s reports highlighted changing attitudes toward special education during the 1920s, which included the belief that individuals labeled “mentally defective” could still be productive members of society with training, and could even thrive if they engaged with “pedagogy appropriate for their age level and life experience.”\n\nFor more, see Kendra Clauser-Roemer’s “‘What Indiana Can Do’: The Influence of Female Field Workers on the Indiana Committee on Mental Defectives, 1915-1924” in the September 2010 issue of the Indiana Magazine of History, available online through IU ScholarWorks atÂ https:// scholarworks.iu.edu/ journals/index.php/imh/ article/view/12559/18789.\n\nFor more on eugenics on our site, see March 9, 1907, 1915, September 11, 1920, February 13, 1974, and Indiana at 200 (72): Sadly, Indiana Pioneered Eugenics posted March 7, 2016.\n\n1915 - The Fort Wayne Friars bring professional football to Fort Wayne.

In 1928, the Lincoln Highway Association erected concrete posts across the country with the aid of Boy Scouts of America to mark the route. The sections of highway in Allen County were later assigned numbers and became U.S. 30 and U.S. 33.\n\nOne comment by Bruce ButgereitÂ on the archway shown in image four: There were two of these illuminated arches in Fort Wayne. They were erected in 1915. According to newspaper accounts, one was at Maumee and Edsall Ave. (when the Lincoln Highway followed Maumee into town (pre-one way streets) and the other was on Wells just south of State. No record has been found as to how long they existed or what happened to them.\n\n1915, July 6th - 50,000 person give reception to Liberty Bell, which was drawn along a Pennsylvania Railway sidetrack on Murray Street while en route from Philadelphia to the Panama-Pacific Exposition in San Francisco.

The bell left Philadelphia on July 5th, beginning a journey across the country to San Francisco and the Panama-Pacific Exposition of 1915. A special railroad train was custom built to ensure the bellâs safety, and a lighting system was designed to show it off at night. The trip covered 17 states and 105 cities. It stopped in Fort Wayne for just under an hour. Huge crowds followed the bell, with people hanging out windows and off utility poles in order to get a better look. Every building the bell passed was decorated with red, white, and blue bunting. When the Liberty Bell returned to Philadelphia, it was re-hung in Independence Hall, and the city has refused any tour requests since.\n\nLiberty Bell Parade photo in Fort Wayne Indiana at History Center Digital Collection on the mDON mastodon Digital Object Network .\n\nThe Liberty Bell in Fort Wayne by Carmen Doyle published July 9, 2014 in the History Center Notes & Queries blog .\n\nMarch 29, 2018 post by the Indiana Album on Facebook:\n\nFort Wayne - On the back of this snapshot is written \"Liberty Bell last trip from East to Chicago World Fair, Fort Wayne.\"\n\nAccording to a blog post by the Fort Wayne and Allen County History Center, the Liberty Bell visited Ft.

The contest was inspired by city council's creation of a flag commission, and the winning design was announced 103 years ago today on April 16, 1916. The winner, Guy P. Drewett, received $50 for his submission of a flag with plain symbolism and two colors. More elaborate flags which received consideration are pictured in the background of an article about the contest. Colors cannot be discerned in the image, but some designs used common symbols and locally-relevant imagery. Stars were popular, as well as the Y-shaped bars. Symbols with historical significance included the head of a bear, possibly symbolizing Indiana's frontier roots; and corn or grain symbolizing Northeast Indiana's agricultural roots. Drewett's design included two stars, symbolizing Fort Wayne's status as \"the second city in the state,\" and a bold Y, representing the confluence of the city's three rivers.

Fort Wayne celebrated this auspicious year with a week full of festivities, including a Sacred Concert, Industrial Exposition and historical pageant. Our Centennial festivitiesÂ began on Sunday, June 4th, when a large union concert of music was held at Reservoir Park. During this concert, a choir of six hundred voices, representing the various city churches, presented various songs. One of the selections chosen for the Sacred Concert was the Fort Wayne Centennial Hymn. The Centennial Hymn was composed by D. Parsons Goodrich and the lyrics written by Wallace Rice. The Industrial Exposition took place the entire week and featured the various items produced by Fort Wayne industry. The grandest portion of the celebration featured the historical pageant. The pageant was presented at Reservoir Park every evening on a lighted island stage.

Still fresh in the nationâs memory was the May 1915 sinking of the RMS Lusitania, and the ensuing loss of 131 Americans, as evidence of the chaos German submarines could cause.\n\nWilson also cited the intercepted Zimmerman telegram as evidence that peace had been compromised. The telegram proved that Germany was a real security threat to the United States and sparked anger that was instrumental in altering American public opinion towards war.\n\nCongress concurred with the Presidentâs reasoning and passed the resolution to declare war against Germany. On April 6, Wilson signed the resolution, and issued a Presidential Proclamation declaring war against Germany.
