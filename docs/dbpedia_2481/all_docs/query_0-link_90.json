        "text": "Queen Elizabeth's former close aide Angela Kelly served as a confidante and dresser to the late monarch for more than 20 years.\n\nBut, as revealed last month, Kelly has been 'cut off' by King Charles since Her Late Majesty's death and is now moving from her grace and favour home on the Windsor estate.\n\nYet Kelly, who has been given another property to live in for the rest of her life, is far from the first servant to have apparently ruffled royal features.\n\nFrom Queen Victoria's 'Munshi' Abdul Karim to the Queen Mother's 'Backstairs Billy' Tallon, the death of a royal charge has often led to an ignominious fall from grace.\n\nAnd, as with the Queen's former nanny Marion Crawford and Princess Diana's one-time butler Paul Burrell, decisions to reveal palace secrets have also led to banishment from the royal scene.\n\nMarion 'Crawfie' Crawford - Nanny to Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret\n\nAlthough Marian Crawford of course did not outlive the Queen, her tell-all memoir of her time as nanny to the then Princess Elizabeth and her sister Margaret was released in 1950, two years before the death of her former boss, King George VI.\n\nAlthough the revelations were harmless - providing wonderful windows into the lives of the nation's favourite princesses - Crawford was shunned and disgraced by the Royal Family and spent the rest of her life an outcast.\n\nCrawford had taken up her post in the early 1930s, when Elizabeth and Margaret's father - then the Duke of York - had no inkling that he would become monarch.\n\nShe spent 17 years shepherding the young princesses through their early lives, collecting anecdotes that she would later reveal to the world.\n\nHer book, The Little Princesses, recounted the moment that 'Crawfie' - as she was affectionately known - met the future Queen, then aged just six.\n\nShe was sitting up in bed and using two dressing gown cords attached to her bedposts to pretend to drive her horses.\n\nLater, in 1936, she delivered the news to Elizabeth and Margaret that their father had become the King - after his brother Edward VIII abdicated to marry Wallis Simpson.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Crawfie rushed the princesses down to the dungeons of Windsor Castle amid the threat of German bombs.\n\nThere were also tales of journeys with the princesses on the London Underground and recollections of the sisters' squabbles when they had to wear hats with elastic straps.\n\n'Neither was above taking a whack at her adversary if roused and Lilibet was quick with her left hook,' she wrote.\n\n'Margaret was more of a close-in fighter, apt to bite on occasions. More than once I have been shown a hand bearing royal teeth marks.'\n\nBut most revealingly, Crawfie told of the Queen's early meetings with her future husband, Prince Philip, when he was an 18-year-old cadet at Dartmouth Naval College.\n\nShe recounted how Elizabeth and Margaret were sent to play with the children in the Captain's House at the college after a mumps outbreak among some of the boys.,\n\n'Among them was a fair-haired off-handed boy of 18 who showed off to them by jumping the tennis nets and eating several platefuls of shrimps for tea,' she said.\n\nThe whole time that the pair were in the same room, Elizabeth never took her eyes off of Philip.\n\nAnd later, when Philip began visiting Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace, the princess would, Crawfie said, 'watch through the window to 'see the tall, lean figure coming past the fountain in the centre of the road outside the Palace, or to see his small sports car turn in at the Palace gates. Usually a deal too fast...'\n\nWhen she finally retired from her duties in 1949 aged 40 - after giving much of her 20s and all of her 30s to royal service - she was allowed to live in Nottingham Cottage - the three-bed home at Kensington Palace where Prince Harry proposed to Meghan Markle.\n\nBut the revelations that came in published form the following year prompted an immediate and brutal response from the palace - even though the idea for the book had stemmed from a suggestion by the Queen Mother.\n\nShe had wanted Crawford to provide material for articles about Princess Elizabeth that were to run in an American magazine.\n\nWhilst the plan was for a Palace-approved writer to pen the articles themselves, Crawford's husband suggested she write them herself.\n\nBy the time that the Queen Mother refused, Crawfie had already secured a publishing deal.\n\nRegarding the book as being tantamount to treason, the Royal Family made Crawford leave her grace and favour home.\n\nShe fled to Aberdeen and bought a home yards from the road that the Windsors took to Balmoral.\n\nEven after George VI's death in 1952 and the Queen's crowning in 1953, she remained firmly outside of the royal circle.\n\nThen, after her husband died in 1977, she made at least one suicide attempt.\n\nA note that she left read: 'I can't bear those I love to pass me by on the road.'\n\nWhen she died in 1988, there was no royal presence at her funeral.\n\n'Backstairs' Billy Tallon - the Queen Mother's closest aide\n\nWilliam Tallon, who became known as Backstairs Billy, spent half a century as a close aide of the Queen Mother.\n\nHe was a man of all talents; acting as a dance partner, supplier of gin and manager of her famous lunch parties.\n\nBut, as author Tom Quinn's biography of the aide revealed, Tallon's powerful sex drive and habit of inviting young men back to Clarence House ensured that he made many enemies.\n\nRita Edwards, who served for years as a maid at the Queen Mother's official residence, recalled one of many such incidents, when she encountered a well-dressed young man in the corridors one night.\n\n'For there to be a stranger alone in the house at night was a serious security breach,' she said.\n\n'Then I saw Billy suddenly at the far end of the corridor. His hair was all over the place and he was trying to put his jacket on – I'd never seen him so flustered.\n\n'He quickly reached the young man and was clearly furious. Next time we met he made absolutely no reference to this night-time escapade.\n\n'But then he always would simply float above any difficulty or embarrassment.'\n\nWhen the Queen Mother was away, he would allegedly invite two or three men back at a time.\n\nOne former partner recalled, on condition of anonymity, how he had sex with Tallon on the Queen Mother's favourite sofa.\n\nLater, when a newspaper reported that a 'rent boy' had been invited back to Clarence House by Tallon, the Queen Mother betrayed her endless tolerance for her aide, responding: 'How kind of William to invite that poor boy in out of the rain.'\n\nOne contemporary, who worked with Tallon at Clarence House, recalled: 'Billy was two completely different people.'\n\n'He was calm and almost rigidly decorous during the day, but at night he had only one aim: to have sex with as many men as possible. The truth is that Billy's only real interest outside his work was sex.'\n\nAnother servant recalled how the Queen Mother did not mind Tallon getting drunk, as long as he did not 'actually fall over in front of her'.\n\nAt the Queen Mother's lunch parties, Tallon would ensure that everyone had an alcoholic drink, and would even pour wine through a guest's fingers if they tried to cover up their glass.\n\nOnce guests had left, Tallon would ridicule or mock them to make the Queen Mother laugh.\n\nHis friend Noel Kelly recalled: 'I think she was definitely rather in love with Billy.\n\n'We all thought it. He was the only person in the household who seemed to her to be in touch with the bawdy, funny, irreverent world outside the horribly closed-up, serious world of the Royals.\n\n'He also stood up to her now and then, as no one else ever did, and he reminded her of the fun and gaiety of the 1920s, which is where she really lived.'\n\nTallon himself recalled how the Queen Mother's love of dancing meant he would often be 'drafted in'.\n\nHe said how dancing, 'was above all things the pastime she pursued with a real passion, and as she had few partners who were deemed suitable, I was often drafted in.\n\n'And she might decide to dance on a whim when one was least expecting it, perhaps five minutes before her luncheon guests were due to start arriving.'\n\nHowever, Tallon relied on the Queen Mother for his job security, and so when her mind began to fail in her final decade, he was no longer safe.\n\nHe was barred from her personal quarters and, when she died aged 101 in 2002, no member of the Royal Household told him of her passing and he was instead told by a journalist.\n\nAfter suffering liver failure, Tallon himself was found dead at his ground-floor flat in Kennington, south-east London, in 2007.\n\nAbdul Karim - Queen Victoria's 'Munshi'\n\nQueen Victoria's Indian manservant Abdul Karim became extremely close to his boss after meeting the monarch in 1887, the year of her Golden Jubilee.\n\nKarim, who became known as the Munshi, or 'teacher', gained huge influence over the Queen, leaving many of her aides and family members scandalised.\n\nLike Prince Harry and Meghan Markle more than a century later, he lived at Frogmore Cottage in the grounds of Windsor Castle, and also had his own set of rooms at the Queen's beloved Osborne House.\n\nKarim gained his nickname after teaching his boss Hindustani. The phrases he taught her included 'the tea is always bad at Osborne [House]' and 'you will miss the Munshi very much'.\n\nThe pair's relationship was profiled in 2017 film Victoria and Abdul, which starred Judi Dench as the monarch and Ali Fazal as Karim.\n\nHis place by Victoria's side continued even after she was warned by aides about his influence.\n\nRoyal physician Sir James Reid wrote in 1897: 'There are people who say the only charitable explanation is that Your Majesty is not sane, and the time will come when, to save Your Majesty's reputation, it will be necessary for me to come forward and say so.'\n\nThe medic also reported that Munshi's claim about his own father being a doctor was false.\n\nHowever, Victoria told him: 'To make out that the poor good Munshi is low is really outrageous', and added that she had known two archbishops who were the sons of a butcher and a grocer.\n\nSir James also claimed to the Queen that Munshi was suffering from the sexually transmitted disease gonorrhoea.\n\nBut the monarch, who had been in a state of almost permanent mourning since the unexpected death of her beloved Prince Albert in 1861, showed Karim her loyalty by showering him with honours.\n\nShe made him Indian Private Secretary and a Companion of the Indian Empire, awarding him the Eastern Star.\n\nThe Queen also had a portrait of him commissioned and he regularly appeared in the Court Circular of official royal engagements.\n\nIn the last year of the Queen's life, Karim was being paid the enormous salary of £922, the equivalent of more than £100,000 today.\n\nBut his world came crashing down when the Queen died in January 1901 at the age of 81.\n\nHer son and successor, King Edward VII, acted quickly. Karim was thrown out of Frogmore Cottage and forced to go back to India.\n\nThe monarch also ordered that the letters exchanged between his mother and Karim be burned.\n\nKarim died in his homeland in 1909, aged 56.\n\nPaul Burrell - Butler to Princess Diana\n\nPaul Burrell, now 64, joined the Buckingham Palace staff as an 18-year-old servant and would go on to serve as Princess Diana's butler for a decade until her death in 1997.\n\nBut he invoked the wrath of the royals when he released his tell-all memoir, A Royal Duty, in 2003.\n\nIt led to a rift with Buckingham Palace, with Prince William and Prince Harry calling the book a 'cold and overt betrayal' of their late mother\n\nIn a 2003 statement unprecedented for its strength of feeling, William, then 21 and also speaking on behalf of his younger brother, showed his deep pain at Mr Burrell's revelations in his tell-all book.\n\nThe Princes said Diana would have been 'mortified' at his actions if she were alive today and called on him to put an end to his disclosures.\n\nPrince William said in the statement released by Clarence House: 'We cannot believe that Paul who was entrusted with so much could abuse his position in such a cold and overt betrayal.\n\n'It is not only deeply painful for the two of us but also for everyone else affected and it would mortify our mother if she were alive today and, if we might say so, we feel we are more able to speak for our mother than Paul'.\n\nBurrell made millions from the claims he made in his books about his life with Diana and also secured lucrative deals on reality shows such as I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here.\n\nLast year, a 2002 letter written by the then Prince Charles revealed the depth of animosity for the former aide.\n\nWriting to Miss Majorie Dawson, who had served as personal maid and dresser to Princess Alexandra, the Queen's cousin, Charles wrote: 'Bless you for taking the trouble to write as you did in the wake of all the ghastliness that has being going on!\n\n'I find it utterly incredible, as I have done nothing but show people like Paul Burrell every consideration over the years.\n\n'Unfortunately we are now to be treated as mere pawns in a terrifying and ongoing media circulation war where the actual facts are totally disregarded and vast sums of money are offered as bribes to former and current members of staff to exercise their pathetic jealousies and vendettas in public.\n\n'One member of staff has been offered a total of £5 millions by the newspapers in recent weeks.'\n\nWeeks before the letter, Burrell had gone on trial on theft charges relating to 310 of items worth £4.5m that had belonged to the late Princess of Wales.\n\nBut the Old Bailey trial collapsed part-way through after the Queen recalled that Burrell had told her he was keeping some of Diana's possessions\n\nAmong Burrell's statements was a claim that Diana feared for her life and spoke of a plot to tamper with the brakes of her car before she died in 2003.\n\nHe also alleged that Diana's mother, Frances Shand Kydd, called her a 'wh***' for dating Muslim men - heart surgeon Hasnat Khan and Dodi Fayed, who was killed alongside her in 1997.\n\nBurrell claimed Diana was told: 'That's what you are. I've raised a wh***, who**** around town with Muslim men.\n\n'You should be ashamed of yourself.' Diana was sobbing, saying 'Mummy, please don't say those words to me.\n\n'Please don't call me those names.' She begged her. She kept begging her not to say it.'\n\nAfter the tirade Diana apparently pulled back from her relationship with her mother, and shortly afterwards she was killed in the car crash in Paris in 1997."
