        "text": "Billy Wilder’s 1960 classic “The Apartment” is one of my favorite films. I have seen it countless times and I never tire of it. Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine have such incredible chemistry. Their interactions on screen are filled with wit and drama. The ending line “Shut up and deal” is one of the best in all of cinema. The film is at times tragic, at points completely hilarious and in total a true piece of art.\n\nSpeaking of: I’m not sure if you have noticed, but Lemmon’s character Calvin Baxter’s apartment in the film is decorated with a number of posters and framed artworks. I noticed this a few rewatches in and have looked closer and closer at the specific pieces on his walls. The set dresser would then have picked artworks with a purpose. I think that the posters on the wall of Baxter’s apartment relate to the story as a whole, even if they are not entirely clear to the human eye.\n\nAll the posters that I have spotted and identified are from the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Makes sense. Baxter probably went to MOMA and bought the posters in the gift shop. Which works did he pick?\n\nThree Musicians, Pablo Picasso (1921):\n\nThis work is situated in the bedroom to the right of the bed, tacked up on the wall. It features a trio of musicians: one playing the clarinet, another a guitar and the third holding sheet music. I love a painting similar to this one at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. It also features a trio of musicians and was painted the same year. So, when I spotted this painting in “The Apartment” I knew immediately it was a Picasso.\n\nMy immediate instinct is to connect the painting with the trio of Baxter, Fran Kubelik and Fred MacMurray’s Jeff Sheldrake. They are the central three characters in the story and also a dramatic love triangle. I would say that Kubelik is the monk who is singing with the sheet music, serenaded by Baxter and Sheldrake (who both seek to woo her). Though Kubelik appears to be in a position of power, I would argue that she is still beholden to the sheet music and to her fellow musicians. Just like in the film where she seems incapable of escaping the grip of Sheldrake.\n\nThe Studio, Pablo Picasso (1927-28) -\n\nThis abstract image of two figures in a studio evokes the shot at the end of the film with Baxter and Kubelik playing rummy. The canvases in the background appear almost as blank spots on the wall, similar to the empty rectangles of past artworks as Baxter prepares to move. Also significant is that this room, though abstracted, is the clearest representation of a room in all of these paintings. We see the door, we see a table and table cloth, we see multiple walls and even some perspective. I feel like this painting points to Baxter and Kubelik’s future together. Just the two of them, existing in their own space (and probably playing rummy at the table).\n\nBaxter places this poster right on your left as you enter the apartment. It is only clearly visible a view times during the film.\n\nUnidentifiable Works\n\nThere are a few pieces that I don’t recognize or simply cannot identify but I still think it is worth mentioning their presence in the apartment.\n\nOne is a framed still life of a pear and an orange. It is on the right wall as you enter through the door. It’s a classic still life with the pear leaning up against the semi-unpeeled orange. I’m tempted to connect these two fruit figures to Baxter and Kubelik with Kubelik (the pear) leaning on Baxter (the orange) for support.\n\nThere is a group photograph in Baxter’s bedroom which I think could possibly be a tennis team photograph from high school. At least a sport’s team of some sort. Baxter has a tennis racket so that’s why I assume it is the tennis team.\n\nAlso in his bedroom is a collection of four prints, tacked up in a square orientation. I am still trying to identify these works, it is hard to get a clear shot of them as the film plays. I thought initially that they are small works by Klee but the MOMA collection doesn’t have Klee works that resemble these. Will require more research.\n\nAnother puzzling work is a sexualized painting of two lovers in the main living space. I attempted to identify this work to no avail. I thought perhaps it could be a Shunga piece from Japan but no works that I researched resembled this one. Regardless, it is interesting that such a sexual image is on the wall of the living space. I think it alludes to the fact that Baxter’s apartment has sexual activity throughout the entire space, though unfortunately for Baxter none of it includes him.\n\nFinally there is a second still life that is confounding me. It appears to be a framed painting (like the pear and orange) with a bowl and more fruit. But I can’t be sure. Could be from the 19th century possibly. It is hard to tell how abstract the objects are, so could also be 20th century."
