        "text": "Indiana State Song\n\n\"On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away\"\n\nWritten by Paul Dresser\n\nComposed by Paul Dresser\n\nAdopted on March 14, 1913.\n\nOn the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away, written by Terre Haute native Paul Dresser and dedicated to 14-year-old Mary E. South of Terre Haute, whom Dresser had never met, is the state song of Indiana. First published in July 1897, the song was adopted as the official state song on March 14, 1913, by the Indiana General Assembly. The state song is the oldest of Indiana's state emblems, being adopted four years before the flag.\n\nPaul Dresser was the brother of noted Hoosier writer Theodore Dreiser. He supposedly was so scandalized by his brother's frank writings that he changed his name from Dreiser to Dresser.\n\nIndiana State Song:\n\n\"On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away\"\n\n\"On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away\"\n\nRound my Indiana homestead wave the cornfields,\n\nIn the distance loom the woodlands clear and cool.\n\nOftentimes my thoughts revert to scenes of childhood,\n\nWhere I first received my lessons, nature's school.\n\nBut one thing there is missing in the picture,\n\nWithout her face it seems so incomplete.\n\nI long to see my mother in the doorway,\n\nAs she stood there years ago, her boy to greet!\n\nMany years have passed since I strolled by the river,\n\nArm in arm with sweetheart Mary by my side.\n\nIt was there I tried to tell her that I loved her,\n\nIt was there I begged of her to be my bride.\n\nLong years have passed since I strolled thro' the churchyard,\n\nShe's sleeping there my angel Mary, dear.\n\nI loved her but she thought I didn't mean it,\n\nStill I'd give my future were she only here.\n\nCHORUS\n\nOh, the moonlight's fair tonight along the Wabash,\n\nFrom the fields there comes the breath of new mown hay.\n\nThro' the sycamores the candle lights are gleaming,\n\nOn the banks of the Wabash, far away.\n\nOrigin of Song:\n\n\"On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away\"\n\nIn 1897 Ted was with his brother Paul in the offices of Howley, Haviland & Co. While improvising on the piano, Paul urged Ted for a idea for a song. The resulting conversation led to \"On the Banks of the Wabash\"; Ted, in fact, wrote the first verse and chorus. It speaks of the Wabash River, which enters Indiana in Jay County and flows west and southwest. It forms 200 miles of the Indiana-Illinois border and exits at the southwest corner of the state to finally flow into the Ohio River. In 1913 the State Assembly of Indiana adopted \"On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away\" as the official state song.\n\nOn the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away and After the Ball were two of the biggest hits of the 1890s. Wabash is the 1899 masterpiece of Paul Dresser, the brother of novelist Theodore Dreiser. Its compelling combination of longing, humility and nostalgia are unequaled in songwriting of the period.\n\n\"On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away\" words and music by Paul Dresser, adopted by the 1913 General Assembly\n\nThe law designating the song \"On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away,\" as the official Illinois state song is found in the Indiana Statutes, Title 1, Article 2, Chapter 6, Section 1. The words to the song are included within the statute.\n\nTITLE 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\nARTICLE 2. STATE EMBLEMS\n\nCHAPTER 6. STATE SONG\n\nSECTION 1\n\nSec. 1 The song entitled, \"On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away,\" words and music by Paul Dresser, be and is hereby established as the state song of Indiana. The form in which this song shall be sung as the state song of Indiana shall be as follows:\n\n'Round my Indiana homestead wave the cornfields,\n\nIn the distance loom the woodlands clear and cool,\n\nOftentimes my tho'ts revert to scenes of childhood,\n\nWhere I first received my lessons - nature's school.\n\nBut one thing there is missing in the picture,\n\nWithout her face it seems so incomplete,\n\nI long to see my mother in the doorway,\n\nAs she stood there years ago, her boy to greet.\n\nCHORUS\n\nOh, the moonlight's fair tonight along the Wabash,\n\nFrom the fields there comes the breath of new-mown hay,\n\nThrough the sycamores the candle lights are gleaming,\n\nOn the banks of the Wabash, far away.\n\nMany years have passed since I strolled by the river,\n\nArm in arm, with sweetheart Mary by my side,\n\nIt was there I tried to tell her that I loved her,\n\nIt was there I begged of her to be my bride.\n\nLong years have passed since I strolled thro' the churchyard.\n\nShe's sleeping there, my angel, Mary dear,\n\nI loved her, but she thought I didn't mean it,\n\nStill I'd give my future were she only here.\n\n(Formerly: Acts 1913, c.254, s.1.)"
