        "text": "By examining these professional and amateur minstrelsy in Lynchburg, VA in light of the Southern condition at the turn of the twentieth century, one finds that they suggest not only nostalgia for the old South, but also white Southern views of African Americans within a derogatory, subservient relationship as depicted in images, lyrics, and musical settings. The songs I have examined in this study were “hits” of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It is notable that the un-coached amateur shows performed the more racially charged songs, while the professionally coached amateur shows, such as the Elks, included more sentimental songs. This suggests that the locally produced amateur shows reflected a social and cultural environment that more closely depicted the disrupted Southern attitudes during Reconstruction. While racism was certainly not limited to Lynchburg, or even to the Southern states, the perpetuation of these notions gave way to a Southern patriotic subculture, where the citizenry harmonized their class structure within these annual minstrel events, and in doing so, reestablished Southern patriotism from the dominant white perspective."
