        "text": "2700 Prehistoric painters in the Rocamadour cave in Ardéche, France use carbon black derived from burned wood or bone, along with red ocher, the naturally occurring iron compound. The evidence of the extreme image permanence and light stability of carbon black is still visible today.\n\n1040 Bi Sheng invents the world’s first movable type printing press in China during the Northern Song Dynasty.\n\n1250 Albertus Magnus first hypothesizes the photosensitive properties of silver nitrate.\n\n1430 Intaglio printmaking is first invented and used in Germany.\n\n1440 The printing press, based on existing screw processes, is introduced by Johannes Gutenberg.\n\n1515 Etching applied as a printmaking technique possibly invented by Daniel Hopfer of Augsburg, Germany.\n\n1642 German Ludwig von Siegen invents mezzotint printing process.\n\n1650 Jan van de Velde IV invents aquatint printing process in Amsterdam.\n\n1727 German physicist and medical professor Johann Heinrich Schulze first scientifically proves the photosensitivity of silver.\n\n1760 The French printmaker Jean-Baptiste Le Prince perfects the aquatint process.\n\n1772 English cartographer and artist Peter Perez Burdett introduces a new aquatint technique.\n\n1787 Gilles-Louis Chrétien invents a semi-automatic machine called a physionotrace.\n\n1790 Thomas Wedgwood makes photograms by placing objects on leather sensitized with silver nitrate.\n\n1792 Jacob Perkins introduces steel engraving for printing banknotes.\n\n1798 Alois Senefelder of Munich first discovers lithography.\n\n1799 The French Revolution ends.\n\n1801 Societe d’encouragement pour l’Industrie nationale is founded.\n\n1802 Thomas Wedgwood publishes the dissertation “An Account of a Method of Copying Paintings upon Glass and of Making Profiles by the Agency of Light upon Nitrate of Silver” in the Journal of the Royal Institution, London.\n\n1806 Joseph Nicéphore Niépce begins to experiment with chemically fixing the images of the Camera Obscura.\n\n1815 Lithographic printmaking introduced in France.\n\n1816 Niépce discovers the light sensitive properties of Bitumen of Judea.\n\n1819 Sir John Frederick William Herschel discovers that a solution of hyposulphite of soda is a perfect agent for dissolving silver salts, which could then be washed away. This led to the use of hyposulphite as a fixing agent in photography.\n\n1825 Joseph Nicéphore Niépce creates the first photomechanical reproduction, a print made from a photo-engraved printing plate of a horse and its leader.\n\n1826 Joseph Nicéphore Niépce successfully reproduces in photogravure an etching of Cardinal D’Amboise.\n\nLouis Daguerre contacts Joseph Nicéphore Niepce about his work. Niépce creates the first camera photographic image using a camera obscura and his photo-etching process. The image shows the view from an upstairs window at Niépce’s estate, Le Gras, in the Burgundy region of France. Niépce’s invention is the origin of today’s photography, film, and other media arts.\n\n1827 Louis Daguerre sends examples of his dessin fumée works to Nicéphore Niépce.\n\n1829 Joseph Nicéphore Niépce and Louis Daguerre form a partnership to work towards the development of the heliograph.\n\nRose-Joseph Lemercier establishes a lithographic printing house in Paris.\n\n1833 Joseph Nicéphore Niépce dies, and his son, Isidore, succeeds him in the partnership with Louis Daguerre.\n\nHercules Florence, a French painter and inventor living in Campinas, Brazil, coins the word photography, meaning “drawing with light.”\n\n1834 William Henry Fox Talbot creates the first permanent (negative) images using paper soaked in silver chloride and fixed with a salt solution. His photogenic drawings mark the first photographic process.\n\n1835 William Henry Fox Talbot develops his photogenic-drawing process and produces silhouettes of objects laid on sensitized paper. Using this process and a “mousetrap” camera, Talbot then creates the earliest surviving negative, Latticed Window, Lacock Abbey.\n\n1837 Daguerre perfects the daguerreotype, the first practical photographic process.\n\n1838 William Henry Fox Talbot records his first notes on etching steel using sun rays.\n\nSamuel Morse demonstrates the telegraph at the Speedwell Iron Works in Morristown, New Jersey. Moritz von Jacobi invents the electrotype.\n\n1839 On January 7, François Arago announces Louis Daguerre’s invention of the daguerreotype to the French Academy of Sciences.\n\nScottish inventor Mungo Ponton discovers that potassium bichromate is light sensitive, paving the way for the invention of the Carbon process and essential to the growth of photomechanical printing. Dr. Joseph Berres, an Austrian anatomis, Vienna etches a microphoto of a plant. Dr. Alfred Donné displays at the French Academy of Science an etched daguerreotype of microscopic images and the intaglio prints made from these plates. He is the first to print true photogravures of camera images. Hippolyte-Louis Fizeau etches and prints a daguerreotype in an effort to produce multiple copies. Talbot writes “Some Account of the Art of Photogenic Drawing, or, the Process by Which Natural Objects May be Made to Delineate Themselves With the Aid of the Artist’s Pencil.” Photographers begin to travel to Egypt, Russia and other areas remote from Europe to satisfy the growing public demand for pictures. Hippolyte Bayard discovers a process for making direct positive photographs on paper.\n\n1840 Dr. Joseph Berres of Vienna publishes the booklet Phototyp nach der Erfindung des Prof. Berres in Wien, illustrated with five plates created by the etching of daguerreotype plates with nitric acid. The first printed matter, known to us, illustrated by a photomechanical method. Dr. Berres’ process was announced in The Mirror – May 30, 1840 No. 1007.\n\nAn incentive-based competition is held in connection with the Société d’encouragement pour l’industrie nationale, and leads to preliminary experiments to improve photogravure in the work of Dr. Alfred Donné. Fizeau develops a method of increasing the brilliance of daguerreotypes by toning the image with a solution of gold chloride.\n\n1841 William Henry Fox Talbot patents the Talbotype or Calotype process.\n\nSir William Robert Grove announces his photogalvanic-caustic process for etching daguerreotypes. Armand-Hippolyte-Louis Fizeau, a French physicist, devises a method for copying daguerreotypes. His method involved etching directly into the daguerreotype plate and printing the image with ink. The original daguerreotype is thereby destroyed, however, the new printing plate allowed for multiple permanent ink prints to be produced. Hector Horeau creates the illustrated book Panorama d’Egypte et de Nubie – the first photographic survey of Egypt and a very early example of aquatints made after dagurreotypes. N.M.P. Lerebours, a French publisher, issues Lerebours, Excursions Daguérriennes, a series of travel views comprised of aquatint engraving made from daguerreotypes.\n\n1842 Excursions Daguérriennes publishes three examples of Fizeau’s complex direct-etching process.\n\nThe Illustrated London News begins publication. The galvanograph process, invented by Mr. Thomas Spencer, is published by Franz von Kobell in Munich.\n\n1843 Edinburgh Calotype Club of Scotland, the first photographic club in the world, is founded.\n\nThe painter Robert Octavius Hill and engineer Robert Adamson establish a partnership and open Scotland’s first photographic studio. Antoine Claudet patents practical method for etching daguerreotypes. William Henry Fox Talbot and his assistant, Nicolaas Henneman, establish the first photographic production facility in Reading, UK.\n\n1844 William Henry Fox Talbot publishes The Pencil of Nature, the first book illustrated with original photographs, in an attempt to disseminate information about the calotype process. To print the book, Talbot and is assistant/partner Nicolaas Henneman, establish the Reading Establishment in Reading, UK where they could produce hundreds of prints each day.\n\n1845 Alfred Donné publishes the atlas his textbook Cours de Microscopie illustrated with 86 engravings copied from micro-daguerreotypes taken by Foucault. Changed to 1845\n\nNoel Paymal Lerebours opens a photographic studio in Paris.\n\n1846 William Henry Fox Talbot’s Reading Establishment prints 7,000 images to accompany copies of the June 1846 Art –Union Journal, a publication particularly well known for graphic illustrations. Due to the high volume of prints, the process is rushed and the prints begin to fade soon after.\n\nWilliam Henry Fox Talbot’s mother dies, prompting him to abandon his failing The Pencil of Nature project and instead focus on making silver prints more permanent. Blanquart-Évrard improves William Henry Fox Talbot’s negative-positive calotype process by floating paper in silver solution rather than brushing the chemicals. He also developed out his prints rather than printing out – thus able to print faster.\n\n1848 Abel Niepce de St. Victor introduces albumen on glass negatives as a photographic surface superior to the calotype.\n\nDavid Octavius Hill comments on the artistic qualities of the calotype versus the daguerreotype: “The rough and unequal texture throughout the paper is the main cause of the calotype failing in details before the daguerreotype….and this is the very life of it. They look like the imperfect work of man and not the much diminished perfect work of God.” The Pre-Raphaelite art movement begins. Gustave Le Grey discovers the waxed-paper process. Frederick Scott Archer develops the wet collodion process.\n\n1850 Louis Désiré Blanquart-Évrard shows the first albumen paper prints to the French Academy of Sciences, and describes the ability of the albumen process to increase sharpness by lifting the sensitized surface off of the fibrous photogenic drawing paper.\n\nGustave Le Grey describes his waxed paper process in the first of his four treatises on photography. Firmin Gillot develops his Paniconograph, a relief process compatible with type. Publication of the first journal devoted to photography, The Daguerrian Journal, NY, Nov. 1, 1850\n\n1851 Frederick Scott Archer publishes his wet-plate collodion process in the March issue of The Chemist.\n\nPhotographs are included in The Great Exhibition in London. Recognized by William Henry Fox Talbot, the inclusion of photographs in the first World’s Fair marked a pivotal moment for the medium. The first national photographic society, Société Héliographique, is formed in Paris. Members are committed to exploring photography as an artform with creative potential. Under the presidency of the daguerreotypist Jean-Baptiste Louis, Baron Gros, members included: Hippolyte Bayard; Edmond Becquerel; Eugène Durieu; Niépce de Saint-Victor; Olympe Aguado; Gustave Le Gray; Édouard Baldus; Henri Le Secq; N. M. P. Lerebours; the writers Francis Wey, Henri-Victor Regnault, and Ernest Lacan; the painter Eugéne Delacroix; the engraver Augustin-François Lemaître; and the optician Charles-Louis Chevalier. Louis Désiré Blanquart-Évrard and Hippolyte Fockedey start the Imprimerie Photographique de Lille, the first large scale photographic printing company.\n\n1852 William Henry Fox Talbot patents his photographic engraving process, based on the insolubilization of bichromated gelatin exposed to light, which produced printable steel plates.\n\nRosé-Joseph Lemercier collaborates with Noel Lerebours, Barreswill, and Alphonse Davanne to develop the Lithophotographie, a photolithographic process. The process is reported to the French Academy of Sciences, and Lemercier is granted a patent for the process. The Exhibition of Recent Specimens of Photography is organised by the Society of Arts. It is the first exhibition in the world dedicated solely to photography. It is held at the House of the Society of Arts in London from December 22, 1852 until January 29, 1853 and features the work of 76 photographers, for many of whom this is their first public exhibition. It led directly to the creation of the Photographic Society. The exhibition wanted to focus on the artistic aspect of photography, and excluded daguerreotypes. Alois Auer publishes his development of nature printing, “Naturselbstdruck”.\n\n1853 Niepce de Saint-Victor patents an improvement on asphaltum process and begins using aquatint grain. He presents his findings to the Paris Academy.\n\nPhotographie Zoologique ou représentation des animaux rares des collections du muséum d’histoire naturelle is released by Louis Rousseau and Achille Devéria. The publication originally called for sixty photographs of rare specimens from the salted paper print negatives of Louis-Auguste and Auguste-Rosalie Bisson, however, due to fading only 38 prints were ever complete, eighteen of which were heliogravures made using A. N. de St. Victor’s bitumen process. Rosé-Joseph Lemercier establishes his lithographic studio in Paris where he produces prints from the negatives of Henri Le Secq. The Photographic Society (the future The Royal Photographic Society) is first formed in London. The early years of the society focused on the issues of photography’s image permanence English miniature painter, Sir William J. Newton suggests photographing nature “with the acknowledged principles of Fine Art” at the first meeting of the Photographic Society of London. Alois Auer publishes The Discovery of the Nature Printing-Process: An Invention. John Pouncy presents a method of carbon printing to the Photographic Society of London.\n\n1854 Experimentation with photomechanical printing in France spreads, and is followed by writers of the journal La Lumière.\n\nNicéphore Niépce work on etching steel plates covered with asphaltum influences Charles Nègre and Édouard Baldus’s work on héliogravures. Paul Pretsch patents Photogalvanography in England. Édouard Baldus begins producing ‘line’ héliogravures, a precursor to his work in continuous tone. Société Française de Photographie is founded October 7 La Lumière publishes the ‘unretouched’ heliographie sur acier, “Bibliothèque du Louvre” by Bisson frères and produced by Riffaut.

John Pouncy presents a method of carbon printing to the Royal Photographic Society. Henry Peach Robinson makes Fading Away, a narrative genre print, and begins to establish rules for photographic art. These rules sparked a debate between Robinson and Peter Henry Emerson, who considered Robertson’s allegorical images to be unnatural, saccharine, and damaging to photography as an artform. James Ambrose Cutting and Lodowick H. Bradford are awarded a patent for improvements in photolithography. Joubert and M. Henri Garnier invent the aciérage process.\n\n1859 A.J. Berchtold creates a line screen by exposing his negatives on a metal plate coated with asphalt, re-exposing the metal plate across a piece of glass onto which he has traced parallel lines, and re-exposing the metal plate again after having rotated the glass plate.\n\nThe original cut-off date for the Duc de Luynes contest for image permanence. The decision is made to extend the competition through 1864, and then again to 1867. Alphonse Louis Poitevin and Rosé-Joseph Lemercier have a falling out related to the authorship of the plates.
