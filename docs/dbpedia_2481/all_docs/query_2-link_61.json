        "text": "Expanding the collections?\n\nExpanding French state collections involves filling existing gaps in order to strike new chords. In common with the process of harmonic composition, acquiring a new work raises the profile of existing works thus enhancing the general understanding of the history of art by revealing new angles and eliciting simultaneous responses from all the senses.\n\nIt seemed appropriate to show visitors the results of the Musée d'Orsay's acquisitions policy since 2008 under the presidency of Guy Cogeval. Acquired after complex decision-making in a buoyant international market, these acquisitions are the fruit of a strategy which must adapt to the unpredictable vagaries of the art market. Acquiring collections carries a heavy responsibility vis-à-vis future generations and is one of the key tasks of national museums. Collections remain vibrant by virtue of research, exhibitions and acquisitions which introduce harmonious variations to historic archives of works.\n\nThis collective policy defines development priorities for the collection, building up certain periods which are poorly or inadequately represented from a stylistic perspective. From initial suggestion to actual acquisition, every decision is the fruit of a reflection guided by a well-regulated process. Significant purchases made in the last seven years play their part in tracing the huge burgeoning of intellectual activity in Europe in the brief but rich and influential period covered by the Musée d'Orsay (1848-1914).\n\nThe Second Empire\n\nThe glittering and paradoxical Second Empire era was one of the most fertile periods in the history of art and sits neatly within the museum's chronological timeframe.\n\nThe museum was keen to add to its collections a major work by Tissot, The Rue Royale Circle dating from 1868, which depicts the members of this very exclusive monarchist gentlemen's club on the terrace of the Hôtel de Coislin on the Place de la Concorde. This portrayal of Second Empire society depicts the Marquis de Miramon and illustrious members, including the son of the banker Charles Haas, who provided the inspiration for Proust's character Swann in his work In Search of Lost Time.\n\nThree paintings by Bouguereau from a group of five spanning the period 1848 to 1902, which entered the collection in 2010 under the Acceptance in Lieu scheme, provide a fine overview of this iconic painter's development as an artist. Masterpieces by Puvis de Chavannes, Baudry and Picou round off the acquisitions made in this period.\n\nThe decorative arts peaked with gold and silverware by Poussielgue-Rusand and Barbedienne; furniture by Diehl, Sauvrezy and Popelin reflect the triumph of eclecticism which made its mark throughout Europe, epitomised by the desk designed by Coco in 1878 for Queen Margherita of Savoy. Works by Morel-Ladeuil in electroplated versions by Elkington, pieces by Christofle and terracotta works by Carrier-Belleuse demonstrate the popularity of editions of artworks which account for many pieces gifted to the museum by SAMO (The Society of Friends of the Musée d'Orsay). Sculpture takes pride of place with the remarkable polychrome Corinthia by Gérôme.\n\nBack to the origins\n\nA section is devoted to sources of inspiration for late 19th century and early 20th century French and English art. English art is superbly represented by an Edward Burne-Jones tapestry donated by Pierre Bergé in 2009, the first to enter the national collections which had previously lacked Pre-Raphaelite works of this calibre. A Christopher Dresser \"elephant\" chair, a low chair attributed to Arthur Simpson, photographs by Julia Margaret Cameron, Frederick Evans, and Clarence White, a drawing by Sir Joseph Paxton for the Paris World Fair in 1867, a furniture design by Edward William Godwin and a gouache by Arthur Robertson, Project for the Tomb of the Duke of Clarence by Gilbert round off this overview of English art, which draws to a close with a chryselephantine reduction of St George in bronze by Sir George Gilbert, acquired in 2014.\n\nThe chair designed in 1916 by Ede Wigand, representing the Gödöllö school, owes its originality to its roots in Hungarian tales. A painting by Edgard Maxence, influenced by Breton legends, builds on the body of works by this artist who drew his inspiration from the medieval repertoire, in common with Gustave Doré, who produced the unusual bronze group, Joy also known as Leapfrog. The painting Scourge , by Camille Danger, dating from 1901, and a picture by Hans Thoma reflect the enduring appeal of the myth of Hercules in the early 20th century.\n\nNabi paintings\n\nFrench art experienced a true Golden Age at the turn of the 20th century under the influence of the Nabis, who made their mark on the French artistic landscape with their response to Naturalism and Post-Impressionism. Some of the most significant Nabi canvases acquired in recent years by the Musée d'Orsay are grouped together in this room. Works by Bonnard, Vuillard, Denis and Vallotton hang side by side, and Ranson is represented here by an esoteric painting dating from the same period. The work by Vuillard Jeune fille la main sur la poignée de la porte forms part of an anonymous donation with life interest of 141 Nabi canvases - the largest of its kind received by the Musée d'Orsay since its foundation. This very fine pictorial environment, dominated by a Bonnard landscape dating from 1916, provides an understanding of the development of form in the decorative arts between the early 20th century and the eve of World War I.\n\nThe Triple Portrait of Yvonne Lerolle , painted by a twenty-year old Maurice Denis in 1897, is an example of a masterpiece which makes us the envy of museums worldwide. Yvonne Lerolle kept this painting, which was given to her by the artist, all her life. The arrival of this very sensual portrait, acquired in 2010, was the highlight of a splendid year at the Musée d'Orsay. The work was purchased with Musée d'Orsay funds supplemented by the kind generosity of an American citizen, George Havas. This concentration camp survivor donated the compensation he had recently received for artworks plundered from his family in Germany to the Musée d'Orsay in 2010. By displaying this painting, we would like to pay tribute to this donor who made a discreet visit to see the painting acquired in part through his generosity.\n\nThis moving gesture enabled us to finalise the acquisition of this major work symbolising, through the features of the woman who married Eugène Rouart a year later, the happy days of youth and the richness of nature bathed in the surreal light of a special moment on a summer evening or morning.\n\nCézanne's Seated Peasant , acquired under the Acceptance in Lieu scheme in 2009, hangs alongside a work by Seyssaud gifted to the museum by a private donor Honoré Daumier's painting The Woodcutters , given to the museum by SAMO (The Society of Friends of the Musée d'Orsay) entered the collections at the same time as the Pointillist work by Léo Gausson acquired from a Parisian gallery.\n\nThe Church at Hurlus in Ruins by Vallotton, a former French army painter, was bought on the international art market, as was Expulsion from Paradise , a sophisticated Symbolist painting by Franz von Stuck addressing the theme of Paradise Lost, which he subsequently revisited in a large format. The preliminary sketch for the painting Verdun by Vallotton was sold to the museum by private individuals and Sérusier's Field of Golden Wheat and Buckwheat was acquired by pre-emptive purchase in the French provinces. Two Women in a Wood , a pastel by Vuillard dating from the 1890s, previously owned by Maurice Denis, was bought at auction in France.\n\nThe revival of decorative arts\n\nThe hanging embroidered by France Ranson, based on a design by Paul Ranson, was a significant purchase for the museum as it only owned one such piece which entered the collection in 1949. The art textiles collection, which has received two donations - velvet for Ruhlmann furniture, and silk by Suzanne Lalique woven by Tassinari & Chatel - is an area designated for future development.\n\nA wooden cabinet gilded with gold leaf (circa 1912) illustrates the high degree of refinement exhibited by Paul Follot, who established himself as a true force for renewal in French furniture with the refurbishment of his Parisian town house at 5 rue Schoelcher. This piece of furniture reflects the influence of Darmstadt in France and was the only item purchased pre-emptively at the auction sale held to dispose of all the furniture from the designer's house.\n\nTwo works by Gallé - a large sea-themed vase presented at the 1900 exhibition and a grasshopper jug - reflect the extraordinary fantasy world of the artist. A sculpture by Schnegg is one of a group of several works donated by the artist's family. Three pieces of enamel jewellery with cabochons by Comte du Suau de la Croix serve as a reminder of the major group of one hundred pieces donated in memory of his grand-daughter. The art of the enameller is showcased by a precious bowl in plique-à-jour enamel by Feuillâtre.\n\nAs Art Nouveau mellowed into its mature phase, exemplified by a shelving unit by Majorelle (Rispal donation), new and more radical forms heralded the refined art of the future in the shape of a bergère chair by Karbowsky produced for Doucet, a cabinet by Mère with engraved leather panels, and an early Ruhlmann bergère chair reflecting Viennese design influences and already displaying his consummate mastery of line. In this period prefiguring the \"return to order\" which flourished in the arts in the interwar period, the decorative arts were already drawing on tradition for the essence of one of the last major French national styles, characterised by profuse, cutting-edge ornamental sophistication, exemplified in the works of Paul Follot.\n\nThe exhibition also features a pair of candelabra by Georges Hoentschel presented at the Universal Exhibition in 1900 in the \"Bathroom\" adjoining the \"Wood drawing room\" which is now preserved at the Musée des arts décoratifs in Paris. Stoneware vases embellished with gilt bronze work in an aesthetic combining Art Nouveau and the prevailing tradition of the 18th century are set on sculpted Algerian plane wood pedestals.\n\nDesigned for the bathroom of the Comtesse de Ganay, these pieces, which are one of a kind stylistically, were acquired pre-emptively at auction in Paris in 2013 at the recent sale in France by an English auction house of collections from a Japanese museum. The inclusion of these two prestigious objects in the national collections offers a perfect illustration of the benefits of the pre-emptive purchase process, a valuable tool for museums, regulated by a legislative framework which is the envy of many countries.\n\nNorthern schools\n\nOne room showcases the main acquisitions made by the museum reflecting the creativity of eastern and northern European schools in Germany, Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden. An active purchasing drive is very apparent in certain areas of the decorative arts and photography, enriched by rare works which are crucial to the collection.\n\nThe Decorative Arts Department has received Blomstedt chairs dating from 1905, a Sinding bench, and a chair by Fjaestad, all drawing their inspiration from national folklore and legends, an armchair by Hulbe for Tiffany displaying Nordic influences, and a chair by Moser epitomising the luxury of the Vienna Secession. The Society of Friends of the Musée d'Orsay has recently gifted a significant canvas by the painter Lentz, a co-founder of the Secession, to the museum. Symbolist gold and silver work by Riegel, radical pieces by Hoffmann and from the Nordic repertoire of Strobl also reflect a wealth of meaning and a diversity of sources and influences similar to those found in the field of furniture.\n\nThe acquisition of a work by Rippl-Rónai illustrates the policy of focusing the expansion of collections on foreign schools which are poorly or inadequately represented.\n\nFamous photographs by Blossfeldt, Rejlander and Kühn are supplemented by key photographs by the Frenchmen Marville, Mestral and Albert Londe, which have been added to the substantial photographic collection.\n\nThe Italian Section\n\nA room illustrates the importance of Italian styles from late 19th century to early 20th century, including Lovati chairs for the American design house Herter Brothers, Frullini chairs dating from 1868, and innovative designs by Carlo Bugatti, one of the great masters, renowned for the extreme originality of his creations, represented here by a large cheval glass and two rare pieces of silverware which entered the collection under the Acceptance in Lieu scheme in 2009. . The Italian Liberty style was represented by the acquisition in 2013 of delicate study furniture and a precious pedestal table by Eugenio Quarti; these designs were presented in Paris in 1900. Furthermore, the bold desk by Federico Tesio, acquired in 2012, exemplifies and blazes the trail for the major role played by Italy in the creative landscape of the 20th century.\n\nThe space is dominated by the large canvas One Thousand and One Nights , by Vittorio Zecchin, acquired in 2012, which formed part of a large 1914 composition intended for the dining room of a Venetian hotel.\n\nAs a glass, furniture and tapestry designer, Zecchin made his mark in Italy through his affiliation to Symbolism and the Viennese Secession, which is visible here in the decorative power of this painting.\n\nGiovanni Boldini's work, Celebration at the Moulin Rouge, painted circa 1889, entered the museum collections under the Acceptance in Lieu scheme. It rounds off this tribute to Italy, which the artist left permanently in 1871 in order to settle in Paris, where his paintings depicted high society and Parisian life. The acquisition of an expressionist bust by Wildt in 2013 filled a major gap in the Musée d'Orsay sculpture collections.\n\nArchitectural drawings\n\nGiven that the Musée d'Orsay was founded in a railway station, the epitome of 19th century architecture, and has an interdisciplinary agenda, it was only natural to establish an architecture collection designed to make a significant contribution to the reappraisal of hitherto disparaged buildings. By pursuing a sustained acquisitions policy in this field, the Musée d'Orsay has acquired over 600 drawings, sketches, drafts, tracings and fine watercolours over the last seven years. Most of them reflect the main development area chosen for the collection, namely temporary or permanent changes in the capital. Thus the body of work produced by Jules Formigé in his capacity as architect of the promenades and planted areas of the city of Paris offers a rare illustrated account of the urban aspect of 19th century architects' work.\n\nBy contrast, the work of Félix Duban, Henry Provensal and Henri Mayeux demonstrates the importance of the concept of utopia in architectural practice of the era.\n\nBy contrast, the work of Félix Duban, Henry Provensal and Henri Mayeux demonstrates the importance of the concept of utopia in architectural practice of the era. Major drawings by foreign architects or drawings illustrating French projects abroad have also been acquired. The collection has been enriched by truly exceptional donations from descendants of architects (Ms Léon Marcotte, descendant of Labrouste) and collectors (Neil Levine).\n\nGraphic works\n\nThe acquisition of drawings has been guided by several key themes: exceptional drawings by artists under-represented in the collections (Léon Spilliaert, Light Reflections), drawings which are particularly interesting examples of a major artist's work in the period covered by the Musée d'Orsay (an Edouard Vuillard study, Feuille d'étude), drawings by sculptors (Bernhard Hoetger, Nude studies) and book illustrations. The latter category of work has been significantly enhanced by several groups of works, including some thirty drawings by Maurice Denis for André Gide's Urien's Voyage . A selection of his drawings, which played an innovative role in the history of illustration, are exhibited here. A spectacular. A spectacular Medusa by Carlos Schwabe (whose group of drawings for Zola's The Dream is also held by the museum) was acquired in 2014 by pre-emptive purchase. Based on Baudelaire's The Flowers of Evil, it has enriched the dialogue between art and literature, thus fulfilling the interdisciplinary criteria at the heart of the museum's agenda.\n\nFor the first time four drawings with gouache highlights by Luc-Olivier Merson, created to illustrate José Maria de Heredia's poetry anthology Les Trophées are unveiled. Acquired by pre-emptive purchase, the drawings form part of a group of 250 pieces subsequently incorporated into bindings.\n\nWhy acquire an additional work by Degas when the Musée d'Orsay, along with the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, indisputably owns one of the finest collections of the artist's works? This very late pastel, in fact supplements the extraordinary bequest made by Count Camondo in 1911 of a group of works giving pride of place to the artist's realist period, and to the early works of Degas, pervaded by his admiration for the Old Masters, on which French state acquisitions focused after the artist's death.\n\nThis Dancer, whose leotard may only have existed in the eyes of beholders surprised by the work's daring and by the presence of this quasi-primitive nude body, is emblematic of the artist's last works.\n\nFree from all constraints, Degas innovated continuously in pastels, his medium of choice throughout his entire career, achieving a physical presence in the secrecy of his studio through formal perfection worthy of the Fauve artists or Picasso, who was in thrall to tribal art at that time."
