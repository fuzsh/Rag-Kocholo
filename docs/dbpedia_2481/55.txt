an editorial comment

The arrangement is corny (annoying), but you can’t beat Burl Ives.

No one ever bothered to look.

A couple of emails about the Gillette murder case today and a discussion with my wife got me thinking about Dreiser and his novels.

The chief influence on Dreiser the novelist — at the outset — was Balzac, not Zola. The influence of novels like The Wild Ass’s Skin and Père Goriot was immense.

It has been long known that Sister Carrie was Dreiser’s reworking of true story involving his sister Emma and Lorenzo A. Hopkins, the prototype of George Hurstwood.

The story was not an obscure one. Hopkins’s theft from his employer Chapin & Gore (not Fitzgerald and Moy’s, as most people who get their facts from Dreiser’s novel assume) was headline news at the time.

It will probably sound as if I am showing off, but it is apparent to me how often it’s the case that literary scholars and biographers never go much deeper than the author’s works and published information — i.e., secondary sources — in their research; never look elsewhere for critical information.

This was the case with my discoveries about Lorenzo A. Hopkins — the real George Hurstwood. He died in Brooklyn, where he was working as a bartender. He did not go back to his wife in Chicago, as some writers have speculated. (Most biographers, to their credit, dismissed this.)

He had one daughter about whom I found some facts in census and other records, including her marriage record. Her name was Maria and she was married in 1900 at the age of 30. She would have been age 19 at the time of Hopkins’s theft.

No one ever bothered to find out what happened to the real Mrs. Hurstwood: Margaret (Menkler) Hopkins. I found two key records: her suit for divorce from Hopkins; and her subsequent marriage to Alfred D. Lutz, president of the Acme Copying Company in Chicago, in 1892.

Margaret Lutz was murdered by Alfred Lutz’s brother Charles in 1900, subsequent to a dispute he had with Maragret and his brother Charles over his employment at the firm. Margaret took an active interest in the business.

None of this was known before.

No one bothered to try and find the real identity of “Don Ashley” — the lover, in Warsaw, Indiana, of Theodore Dreiser’s jilted sister Sylvia — or the death of Sylvia’s abandoned son Carl Dresser, a bellhop, in Chicago; and possible connections (in Dreiser’s mind) with the fictional Chicago bellhop Clyde Griffiths, and perhaps, in Carl’s mind (he died of asphyxiation from illuminating gas), with Hurstwood’s suicide in Sister Carrie.

Marie Pergain and the toothpick incident

There is loads of information about her. She was a lounge singer and (briefly) a concert pianist; a silent movie actress; and the lover of the Hungarian pianist Ervin Nyiregyházi, whom both Deriser and Helen knew well.

“Marie Pergain—possibly a fictitious name” — Swanberg

“Marie Pergain, probably a pseudonym” — Lingeman

“Miss Pergain’s identity has been a mystery, with many commentators on Dreiser’s Harlan experience holding that since she doesn’t seem to exist outside of that occasion, her name is probably a pseudonym. The mystery has been cleared up. …” — Donald Pizer, “John Dos Passos and Harlan: Three Variations on a Theme,” Arizona Quarterly, Spring 2015

(No acknowledgment of my groundbreaking article.)

“A platinum-blonde Hollywood bit player in the late 1920s who was also a serious student of the piano, Marie Pergain (1911–51) was Nyiregyházi’s mistress in Los Angeles for several years. She met Dreiser in New York in 1930 and began a relationship with him that lasted until early 1932.” — Pizer, Op. cit.

Pizer jauntily throws out these facts, as if they were discovered by him. He barley acknowledges his sources.

an exchange of letters

Posted above are letters from

Dreiser to his brother Ed, April 18, 1938

Ed’s reply, April 20, 1938

Also — Rome Dreiser’s death certificate

Ed was Dreiser’s young brother

Rome (born Markus Romanus Dreiser) was the second oldest of the Dreiser siblings and Theodore and Ed’s brother. He is the same Rome, a railroad engineer said to be a drifter, who — in his autobiographical work Dawn, published in May 1931, Dreiser wrote, “drank himself into failure if not death.”

Other Dreiser family members mentioned in Dreiser’s and Ed’s letters are their older sister Mame (Maria Franziska Dreiser) and her husband [Austin] Brennan; sister Emma; Mai (Skelly) Dresser. Ed’s wife; Paul Dresser, who died in 1907, the oldest of the Dreiser siblings; and Vera Dreiser, Ed and Mai’s daughter and Dreiser’s niece.

‘Dreiser’s nephew Carl’

This post is in the form of a downloadable Word document (above).

transcript of Carl Dresser birth record

*****************************************************

Abstract

This article focuses on Theodore Dreiser’s nephew Carl Dresser, who was born out of wedlock in 1886 to Dreiser’s sister Cacilia (Sylvia) Dreiser. The article provides hitherto unknown details about Sylvia’s affair with Carl’s father — the pseudonymous “Don Ashley” — when Theodore Dreiser, his sister Sylvia, and other siblings were living in Warsaw, Indiana with their mother, as recounted by Dreiser, with some major modifications of facts, in his autobiographical work Dawn.

I have discovered the identity of Carl’s father and confirmed details of Carl’s death. It was “known” on scant evidence that he was a suicide. It has been said, which is inaccurate, that Carl died in his teens. I have found Carl’s death record, as well as his birth record.

Dreiser’s sister Sylvia abandoned Carl and did not raise him; he was raised by Dreiser’s parents and also by his aunt Mame (Theodore Dreiser’s sister) and her husband. As an unwanted child, Carl had a difficult life. Many details have remained sketchy or were never investigated by Dreiser biographers; there is scant mention of Carl in Dreiser biographies.

The story of Sylvia’s affair and pregnancy, a scandal at the time, is worth investigating, since Dreiser saw it as not insignificant in his family history and as contributing to ideas about sex and morality he had as a teenager — he used it as the subject matter of two chapters in Dawn. And, the story of Carl’s birth and his short, unhappy life throws some light on characters in Dreiser’s An American Tragedy and, to a lesser extent, in his novel Jennie Gerhardt.

Addendum, August 16, 2020:

I received an email from Professor Emeritus Thomas Kranidas today which called my attention to something I had overlooked (italics): “Dreiser was surely influenced by memory of Carl’s bellhop days. And Carl was tragically influenced by Dreiser’s portrayal of Hurstwood’s suicide in “Sister Carrie.”

Note that Carl Dresser (as detailed in my essay ) died from “Asphixiation by illuminating gas.”

new article published regarding the real “My Gal Sal”

An important article, viewed from the perspective of Dreiser studies, has just been published. It provides new information about the possible, if not likely, identity of a lover of Theodore Dreiser’s older brother Paul Dresser, the songwriter.

“112-year-old mystery solved? Indiana madam may have inspired famous song”

by Domenica Bongiovanni

http://www.indystar.com/story/entertainment/music/2017/08/03/112-year-old-mystery-solved-indiana-madam-may-have-inspired-famous-song/497691001/

*****************************************************

Paul Dresser wrote a popular song, “My Gal Sal,” in 1905, which, with the exception of another one of his songs, “On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away,” is Paul’s best known song and which was a hit in its day. The song is about Paul’s lover, who was said to be the madam of a house of prostitution in Evansville, Indiana.

The article refers to ongoing research that has been pursued doggedly by New York Times Magazine writer John Jeremiah Sullivan and his research assistant Joel Finsel.

In his autobiogaphical work Dawn, Theodore Dreiser identified Sal, Paul’s lover, as Annie Brace, a madam whose working name was Sallie Walker.

Through painstaking sleuthing, Sullivan believes he has discovered the identity of the real Sal.

My thanks to Tamie Dehler for informing me about this article.
