        "text": "This is one of those star ratings that reflects my personal enjoyment more than anything else. Halfway through this movie I turned to Audrey and said \"This is an erotic Jack the Ripper thriller that's shot like an episode of 'Wishbone'.\"\n\nTurns out I wasn't THAT far off. It's a Jack the Ripper thriller made by the guy who did Escape to Witch Mountain, and all the nude scenes in the first 10 minutes were shot by the studio and added after the fact.\n\nAnyway, the movie plays out nearly exactly as you might imagine if someone described the premise to you, right down to the final ambiguous \"twist,\" but it doesn't matter -- I found myself compelled the wholeâ€¦\n\nMaureen Hatcher is thoroughly messed up on account of being kidnapped by a psycho who believes that she's the reincarnation of the lover of the person who killed him in a previous life. Now in a mental hospital (and played by a different, less competent, actress) she believes that her doctor is the reincarnation of her past-life lover, one Jack the Ripper.\n\nwhat an awful movie, it you simply have too see any of this train wreck then watch the first 5-10 minutes then be done with it. Anything more and I'm afraid your sanity (not to mention will to live) might start to crumble."
