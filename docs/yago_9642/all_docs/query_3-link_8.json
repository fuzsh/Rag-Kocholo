        "text": "Four teenage delinquents and a couple of caretakers encounter bloodthirsty villagers during a team-building exercise in Yorkshire, England (aka the middle of nowhere).\n\nI remember watching this years ago and absolutely hating it, as it left me feeling extremely unsettled afterwards. It's savagely brutal, gory and unforgiving. But that's pretty much the point of it all; ain't supposed to be nice in a place like that.\n\nThe characters we follow feel like real people, which makes everything that follows so much more harrowing. Of course you think they should have noticed all of the warning signs when they arrived at their dilapidated accommodation. Or when they stepped into the off-putting pub. Even after meeting the locals, they're able to stay…\n\n\"Arite pal, I'll give you something too ease the pain\" Boom, machete through the neck!\n\nThis is a crazy ass sick film, a sort of west county Deliverance crossed with the creepy humour of The League of Gentlemen mixed in with bucket loads of blood and viscera. The kind of film where death by horse is just an average death scene.\n\nFour troubled youths along with their two carers travel to the country for a weekend of team building and moral boosting activities, on the first night the venture to the local pub, The Dirty Hole for a few quiet drinks but get more than they bargained for when they run into the locals.\n\nFor those who aren't easily offended…\n\nA group of 'problem' teenagers and their socal workers on a weekend excursion unfortunately find themselves in a hidden Yorkshire backwater populated entirely by knuckleheaded,sadistic yokels! This rare British contribution to the 'backwoods horror' genre is ridiculous but undeniably entertaining, playing out like a grotesque, gore spattered combination of '2000 Maniacs' with the cult 'The League of Gentlemen' TV show. Jo Hartley..a regular collaborator with Shane Meadows and Ricky Gervais..makes a surprisingly kick-ass heroine as the leader of the beleaguered group but special mention has to go to Seamus O Neill as Jim,the blackface-wearing proprietor of village pub 'The Dirty Hole'..make sure if you pop in to try the homemade 'pork scratchings'.. erm.. on second thoughts maybe skip the pork…"
