Cut to three years later - Molloy has taken his miraculous survival to heart cleaned-up, employed and deeply in love with Kelly Sanders (Vanessa Gray), the girl of his dreams. But when Yale, fresh out of prison and bent on vengeance, starts stalking Molloy and frames him for a brutal robbery/homicide, Molloy finds his new life quickly falling apart, as all he loves and cares for is targeted for destruction by his psychopathic former partner-in-crime."
