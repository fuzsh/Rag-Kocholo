        "text": "Starting with your definition of Karma or Justice:\n\nthe good guy that beats the villan and gets the girl and the bad guys who learn their lessons one way or another in the end\n\nAnd your first questions:\n\nIs the concept of karma in movies (or any story in general) a valid idea?\n\nIf yes, is it intentional or is it inherently in the nature of stories?\n\nYour concept of Karma to me sounds like the Happy Ending trope, where\n\nstories just end happily, with the villain defeated (or the basic problem resolved) and the heroes triumphant.\n\nThis is one of the most common tropes ever in cinematic history, and it is intentional. I claim its intentional, because there are movies (albeit rare) that have no such ending (see Downer and Bitterweet endings), which brings us to your last question.\n\nWhat are some of the good examples that don't utilize this concept and how successful are those movies?\n\nThere are a few I can think of, mostly because my favorite characters die in the end. Careful, major spoilers for movies ahead.\n\nDog Day Afternoon, American Beauty, American History X, Rogue One, Donnie Darko, Hachinko, Marley & Me, Fellowship of the Ring, Requiem for a Dream, La vita Ã¨ bella\n\nAll of these movies are very successful, and some are even considered landmarks in cinema history. I would say that part of that success is due to the not so happy ending, which (usually) makes things more realistic and makes the viewers connect with the characters.\n\nEdit: Based on your recent edits, I guess you mean fairness and justice, as opposed to happy endings. While I don't have reliable sources to answer you, I can give you some counter examples of movies where people were wrongfully rewarded. For example,\n\nHunger Games 4 - Primrose (little young nurse, a very lawful good character), dies in an attack by her own faction. American History X - Danny (became a white supremacist since his brother went to jail, but turned alright after he came back) gets killed by race gang wars. Don't Breathe - Alex (reluctant thief) dies while trying to protect Rocky (who was stealing to protect her baby girl)"
