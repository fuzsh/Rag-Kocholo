        "text": "January 30, 2024\n\nI was really quite enjoying this - great art, interesting characters, funny dialogue, rooted in some sense of realism. And then it all collapsed into nonsense in the final two chapters/issues. It just becomes a Hollywood action movie, the worst kind, which seems to assume its audience is quite stupid. A baddy appears who is like a walking cluster of clichés, including chomping on a fat cigar while explaining their motives. Seven chapters/issues and the final showdown still feels rushed. And then we are drowned in a lake of happy endings. It's a real shame.\n\nThe art is still pretty marvellous, though.\n\n(Picked up a review copy through Edelweiss)\n\nJanuary 31, 2024\n\nThis shit is incredible. It's not perfect, but it also read way better all together than it did when I read it on release, and I was already high on it then. The characterization of the fellas is great, the side characters get a little bit short shrift, but it's really an exploration of friendship between guys, both of whom are, in fact, pretty different, other than their service. It's a love letter to platonic friendship, with a whole lotta hijinks thrown in. (If those hijinks involve betrayal by your own country, violent murder, vitriolic racism and bigotry, sandwiched by heart wrenching commitment to found family.)\n\nNovember 18, 2023\n\nCinematic. Like Lethal Weapon and Die Hard, but military-style. It’s a bound 90s action flick.\n\nApril 23, 2024\n\nThis is a good sized book (300 pages) and tells a great story of two life long friends who were chewed up and spit out by the US military industrial complex. Ethan and Sully were both in the army and later became mercenaries that worked for private contractors who did stuff the CIA couldn't legally authorize. They both end up with disabilities, Ethan lost a leg from an explosion, Sully has some bad memory issues. They're both together for Christmas and have a sort of unbreakable bond of knowing the traumas that each has been through.\n\nWhen they see that a man is set to be executed for a crime that he did not commit (which they know because they committed the crime as mercenaries) they set out on a road trip to make it right and try to save this man from his impending execution. This book was humorous, action packed, and had plenty of heart. I would definitely recommend this book.\n\nApril 20, 2024\n\nAnother great book from Alex de Campi. At this point it's safe to say she doesn't miss. It's my first brush with Ryan Howe's work, and I am an immediate fan. He (along with Cunniffe's solid color work) is able to maintain a kinetic, tense momentum to the action sequences of the book without becoming chaotic or illegible, which isn't always a given. De Campi does her own lettering as well. I love how the sound effects are integrated into the action in the panel, a lovely touch. And that's not even mentioning the narrative, a timely story about veterans trying to right a wrong from their past that touches on the way we treat our service members, disability, trauma, and family. A great read, check it out! Plus Bad Karma is a lovely hardcover, what more could you want??!\n\nRead\n\nApril 16, 2023\n\nEthan and Sully were in the US Army in Afghanistan; people are happy to thank them for their service, but in practical terms they've got little to show for it beyond one of them missing most of a leg and the other not knowing what day of the week it is. But they do know that the kid on death row for the murder of financier Vladimir Soska didn't do it, because they did, after they went into mercenary work*. So by way of a good deed for the festive season, they decide to say as much and get him let off. Which goes about as well as anybody without the after-effects of a major head injury would expect. It's played largely for black comedy, openly indebted to the work of Shane Black and Martin McDonagh, and mostly able to live up to the comparison. Though it should be noted that the moody cover bears minimal resemblance to the entirely different, much livelier look of the interiors, and I don't think does anyone any favours.\n\n*As a name for the dodgy outfit in question, Blackthorn is both a sound Blackwater stand-in, and impossible to take seriously if you remember the cider.\n\n(Edelweiss ARC, but only because I was impatient for the final chapter; the rest is, and that will be, PWYW on Panel Syndicate)\n\nMay 13, 2023\n\nWell whaddaya know, an Alex de Campi book that's actually worth trying to read. Yes, after three humongous fails (and one reasonable other, it has to be admitted) I came to this, and found a reasonable entertainment. It's not a perfect book by any means, not knowing when to do Tarantino comedy and when to do Tarantino edge, but it has a story that is worth following. It starts dreadfully, of course, with people just bickering for no reason, until we see two guys are a bit more likeable than everyone else. They're bitter, broken ex-hitmen for the US forces, and when their over-medicated, addled minds realise someone days from finishing his stay on Death Row is innocent – because it was them that did the murder he's accused of – they demand it of themselves to go against anyone and everyone to set the record straight.\n\nYes, combatants seeking reparation and a beneficent end to their life is becoming a bit of a boring subject for comics like this, but this one, featuring as it does not one well-oiled old man but two blokes in need of WD40 instead, is at least different. It didn't quite convince as to the workings of CIA, the FBI and all those dodgy Northwoods-styled shenanigans, and as I say it seems to aim for flippant when high drama is needed and vice versa, but compared to the sinfully bad downloads this author has subjected me to over the last few years, she's smashed it out the park here. As I say, flawed, but a surprising success in comparison – three and a half stars.\n\nJune 15, 2024\n\nA prison break leading into a thriller involving the CIA and clandestine military operations as part of a loose critique of the military industrial complex. There's stuff to like in Bad Karma, starting with the decent characterization of the main cast along with the snappy dialogue, but unfortunately the story does devolve into what seems mostly as a pitch to become your standard Hollywood fare. Filled with action clichés and tropes, most seen via the portrayal of the central villain, the story is a lot less interesting as the series goes on. Feels a little like a failed movie script turned film, but atleast the artwork is pretty great.\n\nApril 26, 2023\n\nI enjoyed this. It's both a buddy-cop (or rather military buddy) and family mash-up of social satire, action, chase, come-uppance story with understated humor that is endearing and optimistic in its own oddball way. I liked the art, though sometimes the layouts and visual storytelling felt a bit stagnant, but this is more likely due to how much of the script is people sitting and talking, and viewed through that lens, the artist does a good job of keeping the backgrounds relatively visually interesting.\n\nAugust 23, 2023\n\nThe story of two washed up mercenaries. One is missing a leg, the other has major head trauma. They meet a death row inmate who they know didn't kill anyone 10 years ago, because they did it. Now they have to try and make amends. Along for the ride is the ex-wife of one of them. It's sometimes funny, sometimes really sad as they get pulled into a coverup by a group of people who are perfectly OK with this kid taking the rap for them. This was originally a web comic from Panel Syndicate. I enjoyed this quite a bit.\n\nFebruary 18, 2024\n\n'Bad Karma' displays more empathy for veterans of real conflicts, PTSD, and disability than I've ever seen in a comic. Hell, you'd be hard-pressed to find those elements in genre fiction of any medium expressed half as competently, if at all. The characters are well-defined, their motivations compelling, and the art is beautiful and action-packed. I ALMOST gave this five stars, but the ending felt a bit too rushed, suffering from cliche and monologuing villains in its last act. With that single complaint, this comic gets an easy 4.5 for me.\n\nJuly 9, 2024\n\nTwo mercenaries decide to bust a guy out of jail who’s on death row. Why? Because they know he didn’t kill the guy— They did.\n\nWhat a great concept. The story is fun with decent characterisation for the main cast (not so much for the supporting characters), with a filmic tone throughout. The art is enticing with some clever ways of showing sound and other effects (a dazed person, for instance). The story eventually becomes a little too ridiculous but hey, sometimes it’s more about the journey than the destination.\n\nMay 27, 2024\n\nBig, honkin', giant, hardcover of a graphic novel but it reads surprisingly fast. Humor, drama, poignant, politics, action, smart aleck dialogue, wonderful art, and a dynamic pace. I enjoyed every page. Felt like I'd watched a movie or read a prose novel. I don't remember where or how I heard about this, but seven months ago I picked it up at Laughing Ogre in Columbus, OH and just got around to it.\n\nJuly 30, 2024\n\nΧορταστικό, με καλή γραφή και ενδιαφέρουσα πλοκή που δεν γίνεται μπερδεμένη άνευ λόγου"
