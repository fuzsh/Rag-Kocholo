        "text": "Okay, let’s say something shitty happens. Maybe a bird poops on your head. 😬🐦\n\nThen some wisecracking bystander says, “You’ve got some bad karma!” As if karma is some kind of fateful tit-for-tat.\n\nLike so many people, (and maybe you) he’s got it wrong.\n\nKarma isn’t fate — like a movie script of your life that’s playing out all set in stone. That’s not how karma works.\n\nBut when you really understand what karma is, you can use it to create your own happiness.\n\nKarma is the effect of the choices you make in life:\n\n💜 the energy you create from your actions (thoughts, words, deeds)\n\n💜 the consequences of those actions\n\nIn Sanskrit, karma literally means “action.”\n\nThink of karma as an internal power – an energy you create in each moment.\n\nWhen you know this, whatever you’re giving your time and attention to gets a lot more important.\n\nFor example, what if you’re focused on feeling like you’re not enough? Or maybe you want someone else to be different than they are? Your energy is feeding pain. And since what you focus on expands, the disconnect deepens. That’s karma.🙄\n\nWe’re not talking a “universal justice” kind of thing — like if you pick up someone’s trash, you’ve earned some equally good karma later on. It’s about how your actions and thoughts affect how you live your life. If you pick up someone else’s trash, you get to live in a world with less litter.\n\nIf you like your life and how it feels, keep doing what you’re doing.\n\nIf you don’t, what are you going to do about it?\n\nThe good news is your life doesn’t have to suck just because the other people in it aren’t enlightened. 🤣💜😂 As author Dr. Wayne Dyer said, “How people treat you is their karma. How you react is yours.”\n\nWhen you create positive choices and thoughts, you get positive outcomes. That’s not fate. That’s just the natural consequence of your action.\n\nI was devastated after the death of my premature daughter, Amy, when she was nine days old. My making her death wrong simply added to my pain. I needed to wail, grieve, and honor the cycle of this deep loss for years.\n\nAs I leaned in and did my work, I experienced how Amy was born to escort her identical twin sister into this life, invite me to show the fu@k up and fully live my life, and ultimately touch hundreds of others as well. I believe that Amy’s short life was full and complete.\n\nHer death was the pain I needed to wake up to see what mattered, what didn’t, and to fully live my life as the gift that it is. Karma played its role in my action to how I moved forward in my life after my experience with her life and death.\n\nAll of us will experience pain and loss in our lives, that’s just how life is, but we get to choose what we make of that pain and those losses. That’s what karma and this work are all about. We have choices. We get to choose what we do with what life offers us.\n\nHere are the 12 laws of karma. Use them to help create good karma in your life so you can live a life you fricken love. 🙌💜🥳\n\nThe Great Law\n\nWhatever you put into the Universe will come back to you.\n\nIf you plant love and kindness, you’ll get it in return.\n\nPut out hatred, you’ll get back hatred.\n\nThe hatred inside of you needs to be healed so you can remove blocks to love.\n\nLike the Beatles sang, “And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.”\n\nThe Law of Creation\n\nLife doesn’t just happen. You need to make it happen.\n\nNo playing the victim-y, it’s-someone-else’s-job-to make-me-happy role.\n\nNo shutting down and playing small to stay safe and little.\n\nYou must show the fuck up and actively invest time and effort in the things you want.\n\nThe Law of Humility\n\nYou have to accept things before you can change them.\n\nYou must be humble in your thinking to accept your mistakes.\n\nAvoiding, pretending and denying truth doesn’t make it any less true.\n\nWhat you resist will persist.\n\nThe Law of Growth\n\nWhen you change yourself, your life changes, even if nothing outside of you changes. It’s magical.\n\nWhen you change your thoughts, your feelings change.\n\nWhen you change your feelings, your actions change.\n\nWhen you change your actions, the outcomes change.\n\nThe Law of Responsibility\n\nYou’re responsible for what happens in your life.\n\nWhat happens around you is a reflection of what’s going on inside you.\n\nTaking responsibility empowers you to let go of being a victim of your life.\n\nTaking responsibility allows you to be authentically YOU — no matter what’s going on in your life.\n\nNo matter what the Universe throws at you, it’s your responsibility to respond or react in a way that’s authentic to you.\n\nThe Law of Connection\n\nThe past, present and future are all connected.\n\nEvery person and everything is connected in some way.\n\nEverything you’ve experienced has led to the next thing.\n\nYou can’t have peace in your life today if you don’t have peace with your past.\n\nYou doing your work and releasing blocks to love changes how you experience your future.\n\nThe Law of Focus\n\nYou cannot think of two different things at the same time.\n\nWhen you divide your mind, you’re more susceptible to negative thoughts – and to negative energy.\n\nYou accomplish more when you focus on one thing at a time.\n\nThe Law of Giving and Hospitality\n\nYour behavior should match your thoughts and feelings.\n\nIf you aren’t living in integrity of yourself on all levels, it feels like shit.\n\nYou have to walk the walk of your beliefs. It’s not enough to just think good thoughts.\n\nThe Law of Here and Now\n\nYou cannot be present if you’re looking backward (or into the future)\n\nOld thought patterns prevent us from having new ones.\n\nWhen you live in the present moment, you can make choices of what’s best for you.\n\nYour divine life is playing out NOW, whether you know it, like it, or believe it.\n\nThe Law of Change\n\nThe past repeats itself until you learn from it and change your path.\n\nChange is the Universe’s way of nudging you to learn a lesson.\n\nYou have to connect thoughts and feelings to adjust and change patterns.\n\nThe Law of Patience and Reward\n\nThe most valuable, lasting rewards require persistence.\n\nYou must show up, do the work, and never give up on your big goals.\n\nYou may need to try 10,000 ways that don’t work to find the one way that does.\n\n10,000 ways that don’t work aren’t wrong. Savor each little milestone you achieve along your journey.\n\nThe Law of Significance and Inspiration\n\nYou get back what you put into something. Long-term rewards require more time and effort.\n\nEvery contribution you make influences the whole, however great or small it is.\n\nAs you align with the light, truth and love that you are, you’re inspiring others and attracting more light, truth and love into your life.\n\nKarma is a glorious goddess. It doesn’t matter whether you believe in karma. She doesn’t care. Live as though you did believe and you’ll be fine. 🌱\n\nShit is going to happen and your world is going to blow up at times. That’s life. How you respond to the shit is what creates your karma. Contrast is our teacher.\n\nSome of the most difficult times in my life — like my 9-day-old daughter Amy dying in my arms — have given me the greatest gift I’ve ever received. The gift of knowing my life was for me to live it.\n\nWhen you understand that karma is this amazing internal power — not fate — you’re empowered. And that’s a beautiful way to live."
