        "text": "Disasters, Conflicts and Migration\n\nNatural Hazards\n\nType\n\nOccurs\n\nComments / Details\n\nDrought\n\nYes\n\nDue to the increase activity of atmospheric phenomena in the region of the Caribbean, during recent decades there has been an increase in the severity of violent natural phenomena and droughts.\n\nThe effects of climate change in the rain seasons have caused a change in yearly patterns in the Dominican Republic. The drought periods have also changed, becoming longer throughout the decades. In the past 50 years, the Dominican Republic has been affected by droughts that reduce the agricultural and milk production, increase animal deaths, lower dam and river water levels, increase rural migration and affect the food security of communities. Droughts result in slow onset emergencies, not perceived until their effects are shown in development indicators later on. The main droughts which have caused significant damage to the country have occurred in the years 1957, 1960, 1967, 1997, 2000, 2010 and 2014.\n\nThe Dominican Republic and Haiti also suffer increased desertification, especially in the border areas due to incorrect management of soil, which combined with lack of rain have caused 70% of the Dominican territory to be partially or completely affected by desertification, in the southwest, northwest and east of the country.\n\n40% of droughts that have occurred from 1966 to 2000, were recorded in the northwestern part of the country, specifically in the provinces of Santiago, Valverde, Puerto Plata and Monte Cristi, and south of the National District. However, agricultural drought affects mainly the south and west and the border with Haiti.\n\nEarthquakes\n\nYes\n\nThe whole island has a high vulnerability to seismic hazard due to its location in the zone between the North American tectonic plate and the Caribbean tectonic plate. In Dominican Republic, the highest risk is concentrated in the Cibao Valley, the northern mountains, the Samaná Peninsula, the Atlantic coast and the northern insular slope.\n\nThe history of earthquakes on the island reports that there were multiple earthquakes throughout the decades - six of them considered devastating in the years 1562, 1783, 1842, 1887, 1904 and 1946, with and approximate recurrence period of 70 ± 10 years for earthquakes of great destructive power on Hispaniola.\n\nThe 1946 quake in Samaná Bay was of magnitude 8.1 and since then there has not been an earthquake of similar magnitude on the Dominican Republic. It caused a tsunami with waves of 5 meters.\n\nThe following events recorded magnitudes of 6.4 to 6.5 degrees on the Richter Scale: September 2003 in Puerto Plata, leaving 2 dead and damage to productive infrastructure, buildings, hospitals and schools.\n\nOn March 21, 2010 there was a 4.6 magnitude earthquake near the towns of Valverde and Santiago. There was no damage.\n\nOn April 18, 2010 there was a 5.1 magnitude earthquake in Dominican Republic, felt especially in Santo Domingo and East of the country. There was no loss of life or significant property damage caused by the earthquake directly, although as a result of the earthquake there was a strong surge that killed three people who were sailing in waters near Isla Saona.\n\nOn May 16, 2010 there was a 5.7 magnitude earthquake in Puerto Rico, which was also felt in the Dominican Republic, no damage.\n\nThere are many municipalities qualified as having High Seismic Risk. These municipalities range from the northwest corner to the northeast of the island, and include Montecristi, Mao, Santiago, Salcedo, Moca, San Francisco de Macoris, La Vega, Nagua and Samaná. Also, in the south there are particular flaws in the municipalities of San Juan de la Maguana, Neyba and Jimaní.\n\nAccording to the Technological Institute of Santo Domingo (INTEC), 75% of 61 schools evaluated in Santo Domingo are seismically vulnerable. The number could be extrapolated to the rest. According to the Dominican School of Engineers, Architects and Surveyors (CODIA), 30% of the buildings in the country are classified as \"informal construction\" and do not follow the set construction criteria and are therefore vulnerable to high intensity quakes.\n\nSource: Analysis of disaster risks and vulnerabilities in the Dominican Republic. Consulting for the European Commission, 2009.\n\nEpidemics\n\nYes\n\nDengue\n\nIn 2012 the country recorded an epidemic that killed 68 people officially registered and affected 9,284. Meanwhile, the previous year had low incidence rates with 2,324 cases and two deaths reported.\n\nTuberculosis\n\nIn 1996 there was an epidemic in the country, with 6,302 cases. This incidence took on a downward trend until 2004, with fewer than 5,000 cases, but in 2005 there was an increase in the number of cases, with a total of 5,003. In 2007, the incidence rate was 42.3 tuberculosis per 100,000 inhabitants.\n\nTuberculosis is the first opportunistic infection in people with HIV (about 12.2%) and in 2005, 8.6% of TB cases were HIV positive.\n\nMalaria\n\nMalaria mainly affects rural and suburban populations of the provinces classified as high risk of transmission. The species is native parasite Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine sensitive. Outbreaks are associated with internal and external migration of temporary workers linked to agriculture and construction, with natural phenomena that cause high rainfall, mainly hurricanes, and the limited response capacity at the local level.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2004, the annual average number of cases was 1,490 and increased to 2,354 in 2004 (incidence rate of 27.5 per 100,000 population). In 2005, 3,837 cases (64% in men) were recorded, with the most affected age group being the population of 10 to 49 years (73.8% of cases), and 75% of these cases occurred in rural areas. For 2008, 1,840 cases of malaria were reported, resulting in a 3.4% of the population being at risk of malaria.\n\nHIV / AIDS\n\nHIV and AIDS is one of the leading causes of death for people between 15 and 49. The prevalence is 1.1 % with a slight downward trend.\n\nCholera\n\nBecause of the cholera epidemic in neighbouring Haiti, which started in October 2010, a cholera outbreak was also recorded in the Dominican Republic in November 2010. The outbreak occurred in the main towns and rural areas with services deficit of water, sanitation and hygiene, and the provinces of the Dominican-Haitian border. In February 2011 the disease was considered endemic epidemic by the Ministry of Public Health. A total of 19 provinces were affected. Monitoring of cholera is included in the monthly surveillance of the Ministry of Public Health. The outbreak has been reduced and controlled since then.\n\nInfluenza A H1N1\n\nSince the beginning of the epidemiological surveillance of influenza A H1N1 virus in 2009, a total of 491 cases for the influenza A H1N1 virus were confirmed in the Dominican Republic. (Source: Bulletin secretary of state for public health and welfare Dominican Republic, November 3, 2009).\n\nEbola\n\nEbola virus is a serious, often fatal, infectious viral disease that causes hemorrhagic fever and affects animals and people, the exact origin of which is unknown.\n\nThis epidemic represented a threat to the health of the world population. Although for the Dominican Republic the risk was low, in 2014 the Ministry of Public Health worked along with other sectors to avoid the introduction of this virus into the territory. Therefore, he advised knowing and complying with the recommendations issued by this agency and PAHO / WHO (Source: Boletín informativo DIGPRES semana del 03 al 09 de noviembre 2014: ébola enfermedad por el virus del ébola (EVE), October 14, 2014).\n\nChikungunya\n\nSymptoms of chikungunya, which also include headache and muscular pain, usually appear three to seven days after a person is bitten by an infected mosquito. The disease is only rarely fatal, but the joint pain it causes can last for months or even years for some. The Dominican Republic's Ministry of Public Health, with support from the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO), in May 2014 released a guide for the clinical management of patients, distributing it to public and private hospitals throughout the country (Source: Dominican Republic is first country in the Americas to publish guidelines for clinical management of chikungunya, July 17, 2014).\n\nZika\n\nOn 23 January 2016, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) reported the presence of the Zika virus in the Dominican Republic after ten cases were confirmed, eight were contracted locally and two were imported from El Salvador. After confirming the circulation of the virus, the Dominican government issued Decree 7-16 on 23 January 2016, which instructed the Ministry of Health to coordinate actions to detect and confirm cases of dengue, chikungunya and Zika, address and implement a guidance strategy and to reduce the number of mosquito-breeding sites (Source: Dominican Republic: Zika, dengue and chikungunya virus outbreak DREF Operation Final Report n° MDRDO008, November 14, 2016).\n\nCovid-19\n\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment. The Dominican Republic has local capacity to diagnose the COVID-19 through the National Public Health Laboratory. The Ministry of Health advises of mandatory quarantine or self-quarantine for COVID-19 positive patients (Source: Coronavirus Information for the Dominican Republic, July 7, 2020).\n\nThe last updates published by the Epidemiology Department about COVID-19, 27,370 confirmed cases (693 new infected) have been reported in the Dominican Republic: 2,726 are in hospital isolation, 8,637 in home isolation, 15,338 recovered and 669 deceased (7 deaths), lethality = 2.44%; per million habitants, the case fatality rate is 64.03. 175 cases have been found in the Intensive Care Unit; 44.43% in Santo Domingo City, 34.29% in Santiago and 9.71% in Duarte Province.\n\nMedian age of total cases: 39 years, interquartile range is from 28 to 53 years. 54.06% (14,795) are men and 75.92% (20,779) of the cases are concentrated in 12 municipalities. In total, there are 223 COVID-19 positive health workers, of whom 65.47% (146) are female. In the last 4 weeks, the positivity of the processed samples is 19.89%. (Diary bulletin).\n\nExtreme Temperatures\n\nNo\n\nFlooding\n\nYes\n\nFloods are one of the largest and most regular natural disasters in the Dominican Republic. Throughout the years between 1966 and 2000, higher impact floods in the country have had recurrence periods between 4 and 6 years. The years of most intense recorded flooding have been: 1970, 1975, 1981, 1988, 1993, 1998 and 2007.\n\nFrom a total of 464 registered floods in the period 1966-2000, just over 50% were caused by rainfall proper to the rainy season, and only 8.4% to extreme weather events (tropical storms, hurricanes and tornado).\n\nAbout 46% of floods registered in the period from 1966 to 2000 were concentrated in major urban areas such as the National District and several cities in the subregion of Central and Eastern Cibao. The rest were located in throughout entire territory, with a high incidence in rural areas.\n\nThe cause of these events is not only the level of precipitation that may occur during the rainy season but also inappropriate or inefficient use of the river system, particularly in Yuma, Camú and Yaque del Norte.\n\nMost recent floods:\n\nNovember 2003. Flooding on the lower areas of the rivers Yaque del Norte and Yuna. Affected Population: 65,848 people.\n\nMay 24, 2004. The floods caused by the overflowing of the White River of Jimani, affected 5,000 people, out of which 500 lost their lives, in the municipality of Jimani and specifically the community Jimani and El Limon,\n\nBetween October and November 2007, heavy rains caused by tropical storms Noel and Olga caused extensive flooding, loss of life, destroying more than 38,000 hectares of crops and causing the displacement of over 130,000 people.\n\nOn June 16, 2008, storm Fay affected the country through La Altagracia province, killing four people. Due to its rains, 11,760 people were displaced, 446 homes were affected, 30 areas were isolated, and five bridges and highways with considerable damage.\n\nOn August 26, 2008, tropical storm Gustav entered the Pedernales province, killing 8 people due to landslides, some 6,255 people were evacuated, and more than 1,239 houses were damaged and 12 totally destroyed.
