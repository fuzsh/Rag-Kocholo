        "text": "Loma de Cabrera is a Dominican city and municipality of the Dajabón province, on the northwestern part of the country, near the border with Haiti.\n\nIt was a small town in the Monte Cristi province that became a municipality when the Dajabón province was created in 1938.\n\nIts Spanish name, Loma de Cabrera, means in English Hill of Cabrera or Cabrera's Hill. The city and most of the municipality is among hills and its old name was Loma de David (David's Hill) but it was named after José Cabrera, one of the leaders of the Restoration War against Spain and who fought in this region.\n\nThe municipality is surrounded by municipalities of the Dajabón province: Dajabón to the north, Rstauración to the south, and El Pino and Partido to the east. To the west, Loma de Cabrera borders with Haiti.\n\nThe city had, in 2014, a total population of 10,893: 5,647 men and 5,246 women. The urban population was 67.4% of the total population.[1]\n\nLoma de Cabrera has a total area of 140.0 square kilometres (54.1 square miles), about 13.7% of the total area of the province of Dajabón .[1] The city is an elevation of 206 metres (676 feet),[2] and at 20 kilometres (12 miles) to the south of the city of Dajabón, the capital of the province.\n\nMost of the municipality is among mountains because it is in the northern side of the Cordillera Central (\"Central mountain chain\"). The highest mountains are to the south of the city; to the north, there are only low hills with small valleys.\n\nTo the north of the city there is a hill with pines that can be seen from the city because it is alone; it is the Cerro Chacuey (in English, Chacuey Hill).\n\nThe most important river of the municipality (and of the province) is the Dajabón River, also called Masacre River; it flows across the municipality from south to north. There are other rivers but they are very small and tributaries of the Dajabón.\n\nThe municipality of Loma de Cabrera has two municipal districts: Capotillo, to the west of the city and close to Haiti, and Santiago de la Cruz in the northern part of the municipality.[3]\n\nMunicipal districts of Loma de Cabrera Code Municipal district Population\n\n(2010) 050202 Capotillo 2,112 050203 Santiago de la Cruz 2,619\n\nThe main economic activity of the province is farming; the main products are coffee, beans and manioc."
