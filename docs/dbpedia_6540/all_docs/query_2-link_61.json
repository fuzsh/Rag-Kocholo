They are apparently impervious to the official meaning of this river as a national boundary that rigidly separates these two contiguous Caribbean island nations. Just as the water flows, so do people, goods, and merchandise between the two countries, even as the Dominican border guards stationed on a small mound above the river watch. The ironies of history lie here, as well as the poetics of its remembrance. This river is called El Masacre, a name which recalls the 1937 Haitian massacre, when the water is said to have run scarlet red from the blood of thousands of Haitians killed by machetes there by soldiers under the direction of the Dominican dictator, Rafael M. Trujillo (1930–61).\n\nType\n\nThe Ethics of Difference\n\nInformation\n\nComparative Studies in Society and History , Volume 36 , Issue 3 , July 1994 , pp. 488 - 526\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S0010417500019216 [Opens in a new window]\n\nCopyright\n\nCopyright © Society for the Comparative Study of Society and History 1994\n\nAccess options\n\nGet access to the full version of this content by using one of the access options below.

It listed the following as identifying features: name, age, race, color, eye color, civil status, birth marks (Consulado General de la República, Puerto Principe, Haitf, exp. asuntos varios, leg. 10, 27 Sep. 1932, Archivo General de la Nación, Santo Domingo, hereinafter AGN). In this usage, raza is synonymous with nación, which in the 1920s meant “the collectivity of persons who have the same ethnic origin and, in general, speak the same language and possess a common tradition” (The Dictionary of the Spanish Academy [1925Google Scholar edition], cited in Hobsbawm, E. J., Nations and Nationalism since 1780: Programme, Myth, Reality [New York: Cambridge University Press, 1990], 15). “Color” is the internal taxonomy (not synonymous with raza) used to differentiate between Dominicans of different shades, i.e., Dominicans are all one raza, but of different colores and hair textures (i.e., “pelo malo,” etc.). A few Dominican elites, however, did use raza as synonymous with color. Since the popular Dominican notion of race hovers somewhere between the United States notion of race and ethnicity, I have chosen here to use the term, race, when discussing ideology and the term ethnicity when discussing labor regimes and kinship structures.Google Scholar\n\n5\n\n5 Febvre, Lucien, “Frontiére: the Word and the Concept,” A New Kind of History: From the Writings of [Lucien] Febvre, P.

Although his concern is primarily with the development of popular notions of identity on the border, the historical process of the development of official French and Spanish borders was exported to their colonies and can be seen as a kind of colonial mimesis in the history of the Haitian-Dominican border.Google Scholar\n\n7\n\n7 Lauren Derby and Richard Turits, “Historias de terror.”\n\n8\n\n8 For more on civilization and barbarism in the Latin American imagination and its utility for justifying state violence in borders, see Coronil, Fernando and Skurski, Julie, “Dismembering and Remembering the Nation: The Semantics of Political Violence in Venezuela,” Comparative Studies in Society and History, 33:2 (04 1991), 288–337CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Baretta, Silvio R.

For more on the shocking treatment of Haitian cane cutters in the Dominican Republic, see Lemoine, Maurice, Bitter sugar: Slaves Today in the Caribbean [Sucre amer: Esclaves aujourd'hui dans les Caraïbes] (Paris: Nouvelle 1981: Chicago: Banner Press, 1985).Google Scholar For an example of the literature which treats anti-Haitianism as racism, see Loewenthal, Meindert Fennema and Troetje, Construcción de razay nación en República Dominican (Santo Domingo: Editora Universitaria. 1987).Google Scholar\n\n13\n\n13 Dominguez, Virginia, People as Subject, People as Object: Selfhood and Peoplehood in Contemporary Israel (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1989), 12.Google Scholar\n\n14\n\n14 I want to stress, however, that even given these tensions there was a tightly knit Haitian-Dominican border community. Thus, I disagree with Box and de la Rive's assumption that a “racial frontier” divided the two nations and peoples before the massacre, particularly at the local level of the border communities.

Bahia also had a cycle of cattle ranching combined with the use of slave labor, but several factors rendered this experience distinct from the Dominican case: Cattle ranching was practiced only at the margins of the dominant sugar economy (while in Santo Domingo, it was the central activity); it occurred in an area of high population density; and ranching was never highly capitalized because it was for the domestic market.

The report goes on to complain that “the new system implanted in the country is absolutely foreign to it's [the Dominican Republic's] idiosyncracies and laws.” There were also protests over other icons of modernity, which to some were synonymous with the United States. Defending the patria meant keeping out roads and prisons, which were seen as unnecessarily costly, “repressive,” “a great immorality” and like other aspects of the occupation must be challenged “for honor and duty” (por decoro y por deber) (Gobernación de Barahona 24 (1924–25), February 5, 1925; May 19, 1925; February 4, 1925, AGN).\n\n62\n\n62 Stallybrass and White, Transgression, 30.\n\n63\n\n63 These writers argue that the Haitian caco guerilla war against the United States Marines during the occupation, combined with the upheaval caused by the imposition of the corvée, or forced labor, system and peasant land dispossessions created a new migrant stream to the Dominican border in the 1920s. See LaTortue, Paul R., “La migración haitiana a Santo Domingo,” Estudios Sociales, 18:59 (01–03 1985), 45Google Scholar; and Castor, Suzy, La occupación norteamericana de Haiti v sus consequencias 1915–1934 (Mexico City: Siglo XXI), 1971.Google Scholar\n\n64\n\n64 This point is important because, by the Dominican constitution, all those born on Dominican soil are Dominican. If this population was primarily migrants, then they were Haitians, thus making it easier to justify the slaughter. However, our findings indicate that they were legally Dominicans, even if culturally defined as Haitian, since they were of Haitian origin. This statement is based on life histories collected by Richard Turits and myself in 1988, in a series of visits to the agricultural colonies formed in Haiti in 1938 by President Vincent to accommodate the Haitian escapains, or survivors, of the 1937 massacre. In the North, these colonies lie between Ouanaminthe and Cap-Haïtien and include Dosmont, Tenier Rouge, and Grand Bassin. In southern Haiti, we interviewed in Port-au-Prince, Thiote, and Savane Zombi. Palmer reports that the cemetery of Macasia has Haitian gravestones from the mid-nineteenth century (Palmer, “Land Use,” 101).\n\n65\n\n65 I am here diverging from the standard Dominican literature which gives primacy to the “overpopulation” of Haiti in explaining Haitian migration to the Dominican border provinces (for example, Joaquin Balaguer, La isla al revés: Naiti y el destino Dominicano [Santo Domingo: Libre Dominicana, 1987]).

These documents record numerous legal property transfers to Haitians (both those born in the Dominican Republic and in Haiti). Interestingly, we found land claims as late as the 1940s by Haitians in Haiti trying to reclaim land to which they held title but lost when forced to flee the Dominican Republic during the 1937 Haitian massacre. From the scant information available, it appears that the terrenos comuneros form of ownership was a uniquely Dominican practice, particularly as, over time, shares were frequently sold out of the family. The Haitian system of communal land tenancy, the lakou, was family based and was practiced on Dominican soil, for example in the mountainous central frontier. We have no evidence of ethnic mixing in these two land tenure systems.\n\n72\n\n72 Interview, Pedernales, Dominican Republic; Palmer, “Land Use,” 103.\n\n73\n\n73 Unlike Tambiah's model of ethnic incorporation on the basis of labor market segmentation, see Tambiah. “Ethnic Conflict.” 345.\n\n74\n\n74 I am grateful to Richard Turits for this idea.\n\n75\n\n75 See Pons, Frank Moya, “Haiti and Santo Domingo: 1790-c. 1870,” in The Cambridge History of Latin America, vol.

It was renamed Restauración in the 1940s, after the 1865 Independence War of the Restoration against the Spanish. A nationalist monument was also constructed on the mountain overlooking the town. (The Trujillo regime built monuments in other areas of the border as well. A large obelisk marks the entry to Dajabón, for example.) As part of the nationalist, anti-Haitian thrust of the Trujillo regime after the massacre, many border communities were renamed so as to erase the memory of the Haitian presence and symbolically integrate these areas into the Dominican nation, such as Téte á L'Eau, which was renamed Cabeza de Agua; L'Eau Noir became Aguas Negras; and Banans, Banano. This attempt to rewrite history was not entirely a success, however, as many border residents continue to call these townships by their older names. And the obelisk in Dajabón has lost its original significance. People today say it is a fetish protecting the town from vodoun.\n\n77\n\n77 For more on the Haitian lakou, see Larose, Serge, “The Haitian Lakou: Land, Family and Ritual,” in Marks, A. F. and Romer, R. A., eds., Family and Kinship in Middle America and the Caribbean (Leiden: University of the Netherlands Antilles and the Royal Institute of Linguistics and Anthropology, 1978), 482–512.Google Scholar\n\n78\n\n78 However, these stereotypes tend to be directed at the Haitian cane cutter in the abstract; most Dominicans who live and work in the sugar sector do not share this view. See Pons, Frank Moya et al., Batey, El: estudio socioeconómico de los bateyes del Consejo Estatal del Azucar (Santo Domingo: Fondo Para el Avance de las Ciencias Sociales, 1986), 130.Google Scholar\n\n79\n\n79 After the massacre, Trujillo called for the “Dominicanization” of the frontier which entailed building schools, churches, colonies and military posts along the border as well as white immigration to finalize the process of defining the border (which began with the 1936 border treaty and the 1937 Haitian massacre). On the policy of “Dominicanization,” see Roorda, “Genocide;” and Vega, Trujillo y Haiti. Pena Battle was responsible for revaluing the frontier from a territorial issue to one of the organic unity of the nation (see Raymundo González, “Pena Battle”).\n\n80\n\n80 Even today Haitians are perceived to “monopolize” İn the Dominican Republic the highly valued black market product of imported French perfumes, which hold far higher status than the cheap American colognes readily available legally. Working-class Dominican men, particularly those of the barrios surrounding Santo Domingo, will pay Haitian market women exorbitant prices to secure the perfumes for themselves and their girlfriends. The link was sought perhaps out of terror. Chicho, still prominent today, has been a military favorite since the 1930s of both the Trujillo and Balaguer regimes for his prowess as an assassin. This contrasts sharply with the work of Paul Friedrich, who demonstrates that the more egalitarian Tarascan Indian villagers did not seek out rich or powerful compadres to form vertical links but, rather, sought ties which bound political blocks together horizontally. See his The Princes of Naranja: An Essay in Anthrohistorical Method (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1986), 108–14. I would like to thank Paul Liffman for bringing this point to my attention.Google Scholar\n\n81\n\n81 Ducoudray, F.

The issue of whether or not Haitian co-wives inherited the land they worked is also one which we hope to clarify in future field work. The pattern of inheritance is critical to Goody's distinction between co-wives and concubines. I am using the term “co-wife” because my understanding is that co-wives did inherit, as in Haitian plasaj. This would distinguish the border conjugal system from that of concubinage, the form practiced in wider Dominican society. See Goody, Jack, Production and Reproduction: A Comparative Study of the Domestic Domains (London: Cambridge Studies in Social Anthropology, 1976).Google Scholar\n\n86\n\n86 We heard of a few examples of Haitian men marrying Dominican women, although there were many Dominican prostitutes in Haitian bordertowns. There also were Haitian-Dominican marriages, primarily of small cultivators and coffee producers, which were monogamic. One such couple we interviewed fled to Haiti during the Haitian massacre.\n\n87\n\n87 This section derives primarily from interviews we conducted during a series of visits to the Dominican border in 1988, including Monte Cristi, Dajabón, Santiago de Ia Cruz, Loma de Cabrera, Restauración, Pedro Santana, Pedernales, Duvergé, Neiba, and Barahona (we also interviewed in Haiti but that material is treated elsewhere). All the interviewees chosen were mature at the time of the massacre in an effort to capture images of Haitians formed during the pre-massacre period. I have not cited specific interviews (except in a few cases in which the stories were specific to particular oral informants) both to protect the identity of informants and because the images reported here derive from stories that all elderly border residents repeat and that form a part of the collective imagination of the Dominican frontier.\n\n88\n\n88 Haitian currency and the U.S. dollar were used until the Dominican Republic established its first national currency in 1947, although there was a brief but failed attempt to do so under the Heureaux regime. However, Haitian currency was more common in the border provinces.\n\n89\n\n89 This argument renders the Haitian-Dominican case closely parallel to that of Jews in Nazi Germany.

Although both women and men are mounted in vodoun, the idea that only Haitians could be mounted reflects the female gende?ng of Haitians in the Dominican imagination. Haitians are notorious in the anti-Haitian literature for their extraordinary procreativity as well. See Joaquín Balaguer's La isla al revés, in which he describes Haitians as multiplying “like vegetables” (Balaguer was implicated in the 1937 Haitian massacre).
