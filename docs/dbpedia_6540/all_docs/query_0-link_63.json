Concurrent with urban development, it continues to expand its geographical and habitat range throughout the region, especially in the Greater Antilles. Through personal research, supplemented by relevant publications, unpublished results from othersâ research and casual observations, as well as checklists including Pearly-eyed Thrasher sightings submitted to Cornell Universityâs eBird online database, we document the speciesâ apparent colonization of Hispaniola. Most sightings of pioneering Pearly-eyed Thrashers in Hispaniola have been made by âeBirdersâ from coastal urban sites, particularly from resorts, hotels, and golf courses. Historical and contemporary evidence and the recent colonization of several islands in the northern Caribbean and The Bahamas, strongly suggest that the Pearly-eyed Thrasher may very well attempt to gain a foothold on the North American continent in the near future as a result of the effects of global climate change pursuant to natural and anthropogenic disasters and accelerated urban development in the USA and the Greater Caribbean Basin. Natural and human-influenced habitat alteration often culminates in a reduction in avian species richness, thus opening an avenue for colonization by this intrepid avian supertramp."
