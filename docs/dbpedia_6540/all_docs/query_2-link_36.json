Some feel that despite the problems that may arise here, the\n\narea provides an opportunity for the people of our two countries to cooperate, share experiences and\n\nfind joint solutions to shared problems. At the same time, others consider the border zone as a region\n\nwhere development opportunities are limited by poverty and isolation.\n\nNotwithstanding these different perspectives, addressing the challenges in the border zone is important not\n\nonly for the development of local communities, but also for the implementation of cooperation strategies\n\nand joint initiatives between the two countries. For this reason, the governments, development actors,\n\nand civil society in both countries have strengthened their efforts in the border zone and are building on\n\nsuccessful initiatives that have already taken place.\n\nAmong these efforts, we would like to mention those initiatives adopted at both the community and\n\ngovernment levels that seek to address the diverse challenges in the border zone, some of which have\n\nstemmed from the short-sighted exploitation of natural resources. At the same time, we welcome the\n\nefforts of the Joint Dominican-Haitian Bilateral Commission, a flagship initiative which will guide the\n\nimplementation of joint interventions in the border zone. This initiative, which originates from the highest\n\nlevels of both States, has catalyzed the development of an increasing number of binational programs.\n\nIn the environmental sector, momentum for joint programs has also grown. On 16 May 2011, the Ministry\n\nof Environment and Natural Resources of the Dominican Republic, the Ministry of Environment of Haiti,\n\nand the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, signed a Declaration of Intent, in Ouanaminthe, for the\n\nTriangular Cooperation between the three parties, to support the Frontera Verde Programme. The first step\n\nin this cooperation was to implement the first phase of the Transboundary Natural Resource Management\n\nand Restoration Project, focusing on the Massacre and Pedernales Watersheds. Technical support in the\n\nimplementation of this work is being provided by UNEP and UNDP. This commitment further highlights\n\nthe willingness of our two governments to jointly address the problems associated with natural resource\n\nmanagement in the border zone.\n\nWe are aware that in order to effectively address the challenges faced in the border zone, a deep\n\nunderstanding and an accurate analysis of the driving forces that have contributed to the present situation\n\nis necessary. For this reason, we welcome this report and analysis on the state of transboundary natural\n\nresources and how they are linked with different aspects of life both within the border zone and within\n\nour respective countries. This report provides information on natural resources and their role in trade,\n\nagriculture, human mobility, energy, among others.\n\nThis document provides up-to-date information and confirms the close relationship that exists between\n\nthe state of transboundary natural resources, poverty, and recurring social conflicts. In this respect, this\n\nreport is an indispensable tool that will inform decision making in the coming years.\n\n4 Haiti – Dominican Republic: Environmental challenges in the border zone\n\nWe congratulate all those who contributed to the preparation of this report, both from our Ministries, UNEP,\n\nand other institutions. We invite all actors that are providing assistance, or that are asked to intervene in the\n\nborder zone, to consult this report and to take into consideration its recommendations when carrying out\n\nfuture action. We are firmly committed and dedicated to take the conclusions and recommendations\n\nof this report to the highest levels of our governments. It will inform the work of the Joint Dominican-\n\nHaitian Bilateral Commission as well as guide the political decisions and actions undertaken in the\n\nborder zone.\n\nDR. JEAN FRANCOIS THOMAS DR.
