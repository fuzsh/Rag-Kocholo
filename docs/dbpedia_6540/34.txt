The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is seeking applications for a Cooperative Agreement from qualified entities to implement the Climate Adaptation Activity. Eligibility for this RFA is not restricted.

The Dominican Republic (DR) is among the countries most vulnerable to climate hazards in the world . Intense storms often affect coastal areas and river banks, resulting in significant damages 1 to infrastructure, natural resources, and livelihoods both in urban and rural settings. The effects of climate change have exacerbated these vulnerabilities, especially for marginalized communities and key economic sectors for the country, such as agriculture and tourism--which are both highly dependent on water security.

This Activity targets the DR-Haiti northern border provinces of Santiago Rodríguez, Montecristi, and Dajabón which are home to important transboundary watersheds that supply water for human consumption, irrigation, and industrial use for towns on both sides of the border. These provinces have seen the highest increase in population density and city growth relative to other provinces in the region.

The purpose of the Climate Adaptation Activity is to build climate change resilience by promoting water security and sustainable livelihoods through reduced pressures on key water sources, enhanced watershed governance, and strengthened adaptation practices of vulnerable communities. This Activity will support locally-led development and catalyze private sector engagement to promote ownership and sustainability of climate adaptation actions, and their mitigation co-benefits, in the northern border region between the Dominican Republic and Haiti.
