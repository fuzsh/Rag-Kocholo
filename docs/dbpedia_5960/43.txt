Twin brothers grow up on a Welsh hill farm

This drama is based upon the 1982 novel of the same name by Bruce Chatwin and covers eighty years in the lives of a pair of identical Welsh twins. It features a scene filmed on the Severn Valley Railway at Arley station, with GWR 4500 Class 2-6-2T No.4566 on a train. All frontal identity has for some strange reason been removed from the loco, but the cast cabside numberplates were still retained allowing us to confirm its identity.
