        "text": "Cobra Verde\n\nDirector: Werner Herzog\n\nWriters: Werner Herzog, Bruce Chatwin (novel)\n\nDirector of Photography: Viktor Ruzicka\n\nLead Role: Klaus Kinski\n\nSynopsis\n\nIn the opening scene we meet our main character, Francisco Manoel da Silva, played by Klaus Kinski panning for gold. Da Silva however was originally a Brazilian rancher, but lost his land to a drought. After he is seen panning, he heads to the pay line but is immediately told that he would not be paid. Da Silva becomes furious and begins to make a scene but is taken away. The next clip is later that day when da Silva murders the man who rejected giving him his pay. Da Siva flees as an outlaw who id then on named the infamous Cobra Verde.\n\nWhile traveling, Cobra Verde impresses the wealthy plantation owner Don Octavio Coutinho, played by Jose Lewgoy, through his work with a stranger slave. Don Octavio does not actually know that da Silva is the outlaw who murdered his last boss. So, he hires “Cobra Verde” as a manager of the slaves on his sugar plantation.\n\nAfter some time working there we find that da Silva impregnates three women. To make the situation even more “juicy”, we find out that these women are actually the Don’s three daughters! Obviously he becomes furious of this news. Now to make the situation get even worse, Octavio finds out who da Silva actually is.\n\nOctavio could have easy killed da Silva by hanging him or doing various other things, but instead he decides to send him on a mission to re-open the slave trade with Western Africa. This task is nearly impossible! Cobra Verde realizes that he is most likely to be killed in Africa, but goes anyway. He travels to West Africa where he then negotiates with the terrible King Bossa Ahadee who was actually played by His Royal Highness Nana Agyefi Kwame II of Nsein. Incredibly da Silva is able to convince the King to exchange the slaves for new rifles!\n\nHowever, Da Silva then takes over the castle and Taparica, the only survivor of the last expedition, for a partner. They control and operate the slave trade across the Atlantic all the way to Brazil. But, soon the king has them captured and brought to him. The King furiously accuses da Silva of various random ridiculous crimes, such as poisoning the King’s greyhound, and orders him to death. Lucky for Cobra Verde and Taparica they are rescued the night before da Silva’s decapitation by the nephew of the king. Da Silva was able to use his social skills again and create an alliance with him. Together they plan to overthrow the King! Cobra Verde then trains a giant army of native women, and successfully raids and overthrows King Bossa.\n\nFinally, the slave trade stays successfully maintained under the new King, well at least until da Silva loses favor with the King. But, in the meantime the Portuguese made slavery illegal and seized him. The English even placed a price on his head. Despite all of this, da Silva is glad that finally a change has come. He tries desperately to take a boat to the water, but is unable to accomplish the task. He falls next to the ship as the tide slowly comes in and dies.\n\nSide Note\n\nWhen Cobra Verde was released in the United States it was actually titled as Slave Coast. However the title literally translates to the Green Cobra.\n\nArtistic Context\n\nThe Move was filmed in Brazil, Africa and Colombia. Herzog showed Kinski photographs of the locations where he would like to work, Kinski liked some of the landscapes in Colombia, but Herzog did not agree at all. Kinski then traveled to the Cape of The Sailing, Colombia and the foothills of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. Herzog decided on Valle del Cauca and Villa de Leyva, in Columbia. Kinski said: “Herzog does not know that I give life to the dead scenery. ”\n\nThe film is based upon Bruce Chatwin’s 1980 novel, The Viceroy of Ouidah. The book is based on the slave trader Francisco Felix de Sousa of Brazil and his role in helping King Ghezo overthrow his brother Adandozan as King of Dahomey. This was made possible with the help of Ghezo’s Dahomey Amazons.\n\nThis film is the final collaboration between the director Werner Herzog and actor Klaus Kinski. The movie was released in Germany on December 3rd 1987. Cobra Verde has been considered by many critics to be the weakest of this outstanding duo’s work. Together the two have also created Aguirre: The Wrath of God, Woyzeck, Nosferatu, and Fitzcarraldo.\n\nThe duos’ personality conflict reached new heights during the making of this film. Many say that the film’s production was very affected by Kinski’s outbursts. The cast and crew were very often exposed to Kinski’s wrath, one of the most famous is when the film’s original cinematographer Thomas Mauch walked out on the project after verbally assaulted several times from Kinski. Herzog then replaced Mauch with Viktor Ruzicka.\n\nHerzog’s opinions of Kinski are shown in detail through his 1999 documentary, My Best Fiend, where he explores their strange friendship, hatred, and the glory that culminated from both qualities.\n\nDiscussion Questions\n\nIs there a reason why there are three lit candles on the table when Da Silva is sitting in the bar, and he impregnated three daughters?\n\nDo you believe this film is not as great as the other two parts to this trilogy because Kinski had become uncontrollable?\n\nWhat other issues is Herzog trying to bring up rather than just the evilness of slavery?\n\nWhat do you believe to be the true and deepest meaning for the name Cobra Verde?\n\nIs the closing scene of the man walking on the beach and the women laughing during the credits symbolic of something?\n\nDid you find this movie entertaining? (I had to watch it a few time because I kept dozing off)\n\nReferences\n\nhttp://movies.nytimes.com/2007/03/23/movies/23cobr.html\n\nhttp://www.moviecritic.com.au/images/cobra-verde1.gif\n\nhttp://www.movieposterdb.com/posters/08_12/1982/83946/l_83946_3e73d9ba.jpg\n\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JQ5EMVBCL._SL500_AA300_.jpg\n\nhttp://www.altfg.com/blog/classics/woyzeck-by-werner-herzog/\n\nhttp://www.imagensdeposito.com/papel%20de%20parede/32183/papel+de+parede+de+cobra+verde.html\n\nhttp://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2007/03/22/movies/23cobr600.jpg\n\nhttp://www.hatii.arts.gla.ac.uk/MultimediaStudentProjects/00-01/0009135b/fruits/images/herzog/herzog3.jpg\n\nhttp://cdnimg.visualizeus.com/thumbs/84/09/cobra,verde,klaus,kinski,werner,herzog-840970d746061bfeabf2a6088fff4c83_m.jpg\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094888/fullcredits#cast"
