        "text": "Lydia Davis wins Man Booker Int’l Prize\n\n“Heart weeps.\n\nHead tries to help heart.\n\nHead tells heart how it is, again:\n\nYou will lose the ones you love. They will all go. But even the earth will go, someday.\n\nHeart feels better, then.\n\nBut the words of head do not remain long in the ears of heart.\n\nHeart is so new to this.\n\nI want them back, says heart.\n\nHead is all heart has.\n\nHelp, head. Help heart.”\n\nLydia Davis (Click to see large) Photo by Odeta Catana\n\nBombsite interview\n\nFP You read Beckett at 13?\n\nLD Yeah, I didn’t read the whole thing.\n\nFP Where did you find it?\n\nLD My father was an English professor, and somehow it must have been in the house. It made a very strong impression because it was so different from anything I had read. I opened this book and it said on the first page, “I’m lying here. I’ve dropped my pencil.” Later, in high school, I would go through one novelist after another—Nabokov, Thomas Hardy, George Eliot, Dostoevsky, Joyce—and read everything.\n\nFP Do you think about Beckett a lot now?\n\nLD He was very important to me in my early twenties. I studied him. I was really picking apart sentence structures, seeing exactly how he constructed a sentence. Why it worked so beautifully. I suppose I wanted to do it as well as Beckett. So if I was going to do it as well as he did, I had to learn how he did it.\n\nThe Believer Interview.. here.\n\nCongratulations Jurgen Trautwein. Wall St Int’l\n\n<> <> <>\n\n<> <> <>\n\nRecalled from memory, Silent Topography are painted aerial views of land and water formations observed on transcontinental flights between Europe and the West Coast of the United States.\n\nSaturday, June 15, 2013\n\n66 Elgin Park\n\nSan Francisco CA 94103\n\nGallery 60Six\n\nSee more from Silent Topography\n\nAt the gallery -click to see large\n\nSF Chronicle – Kenneth Baker\n\nA Trautwein such as “Frozen Blue” hints at his process. It involves crumpling and flattening found paper – in many cases old airport blueprints – then coating and flooding the sheet with acrylic to produce a sort of relief-map-like skin.\n\nEchoes abound of an earlier generation’s more rugged exercises in color field abstraction. I think particularly of the turn-of-the-’70s unframed soaked paper abstractions of Manny Farber (1917-2008).\n\nYet Trautwein’s works’ illegibility as imagery does more than frustrate. It calls up the anxious uncertainty that attends our inability to read satellite imagery of the Earth.\n\nAlmost offhand, it seems, Trautwein aligns the inscrutability of certain scientific imaging with that of his paintings and with our incapacity to recognize in everyday life the signs of snowballing ecological calamity. Or rather, he relies on us to do that. And once the possibility comes to mind, resisting it feels like denial.\n\n2008 prototype..\n\n(photo by Fung Lin Hall -This was taken in his apartment. He explained that this painting was the prototype for the new work.)\n\nSee Jurgen with Daisy and Spike in 2008 here.\n\nBruce Chatwin Edinburgh flat\n\nBruce was born on May 13, 1940\n\nSusan Sontag wrote of him: “There are few people in this world who have the kind of looks which enchant and enthrall … It isn’t just beauty, it’s a glow, something in the eyes. And it works on both sexes.”\n\nWerner Herzog – Nomade in the footsteps, Bruce Chatwin\n\nWerner Herzog said Chatwin was a great story teller..\n\nGerman filmmaker Werner Herzog relates a story about meeting Chatwin in Australia while Herzog was working on his 1984 film, Where the Green Ants Dream. Finding out that Chatwin was in Australia researching a book (The Songlines), Herzog sought him out. Herzog states that Chatwin professed his admiration for him, and when they met was carrying one of Herzog’s books, On Walking In Ice. The two hit it off immediately, united by a shared love of adventure and telling tall tales. Herzog states that he and Chatwin talked almost nonstop over two days, telling each other stories. He said that Chatwin “told about three times as many as me.”[24] Herzog also claims that when Chatwin was near death, he gave Herzog his leather rucksack and said,”You’re the one who has to wear it now, you’re the one who’s walking.”\n\nIn 1987, Herzog made Cobra Verde, a film based on Chatwin’s 1980 novel The Viceroy of Ouidah, depicting the life of Francisco Manoel da Silva, a fictional Brazilian slave trader working in West Africa. Locations for the film included Brazil, Colombia and Ghana. via his wiki..\n\nCobra Verde was based on Bruce Chatwin’s novel The Viceroy of Ouidah.\n\nThe Essential Truthiness of Bruce Chatwin and Werner Herzog\n\nHis Notebook..narrated by his wife (youtube)\n\nClick to see large ( Photo by Eve Arnold)\n\nINDIA.

He read, that is, as he walked — large swatches of Western literature and thought were lavished on the places and people he visited — and he walked as he read.\n\nIn Patagonia\n\nThe quest writing was dazzling at the time (I reviewed some of it, and was dazzled). Visiting the aged Nadezhda Mandelstam, he sorts out body and soul. She lies curled up in bed, shabby and unkempt, welcoming a gift of marmalade, sniffing at a bottle of less than premium Champagne and getting Chatwin to straighten a painting she’d knocked awry by hurling an unsatisfactory book at it. It was modernist white-on-white: ”Perhaps that is all one can do today in Russia?” she muses.(via There’s No Place That’s Home)\n\nBruce Chatwin Photo by James Ivory\n\nIn the summer of 1972, before starting to work as an adviser on art at the Sunday Times, Chatwin went to Oregon (USA) trying to finish his nomad book. He stayed in a cabin, owned by the film director James Ivory, in the Lake of the Woods (Klamath County).\n\nChatwin met Ivory in England in 1969, at the house of the painter Howard Hodgkin near Bath.\n\nHere is a Chatwin’s picture taken by Ivory in the Oregon desert (1972): (via Facebook)\n\nWhat Am I Doing Here?\n\nIn this text, Bruce Chatwin writes of his father, of his friend Howard Hodgkin, and of his talks with Andre Malraux and Nadezhda Mandelstram. He also follows unholy grails on his travels, such as the rumour of a “wolf-boy” in India, or the idea of looking for a Yeti.\n\nChatwin Travel writing\n\nChatwin was one of the first prominent men in Britain known to have contracted HIV and died of AIDS, although he hid the facts of his illness.\n\nAids Memorial – previous post – Photos of Eleven Good Men\n\nFlorence Nightingale 12 May 1820 – 13 August 1910 was a celebrated English social reformer and statistician, and the founder of modern nursing.\n\nFlorence Nightingale click to see large\n\n(via Crimean casualties)\n\nDuring her service in the front Nightingale collected data from diseases, wounds and deaths. Her data showed that a large part of the casualties was due to bad or non-existent sanitation in the barracks. She made her data tangible using a special graphic representation, known originally as the “Nightingale’s Coxcomb”, or more recently, the “Nightingale’s Rose”. The graph efficiently portrayed the root causes of deaths, and was the beginning of modern nursery and sanitation, helping to save millions of lives.\n\nDespite her intense personal devotion to Christ, Nightingale believed for much of her life that the pagan and eastern religions had also contained genuine revelation. She was a strong opponent of discrimination both against Christians of different denominations, and against those of non-Christian religions. Nightingale believed religion helped provide people with the fortitude for arduous good work, and would ensure the nurses in her care attended religious services. However she was often critical of organised religion.
