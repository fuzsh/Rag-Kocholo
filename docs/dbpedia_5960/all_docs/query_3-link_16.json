        "text": "Whether you prefer to read before, during, or after your travels, we've handpicked a small library of captivating books that we believe can change your whole perception of Patagonia.\n\nWith the following categories, there is something to suit every taste: Fiction, Travel Writing, History, Memoir and Poetry.\n\nThis guide was lovingly created using contributions from our team and the Swoop community all over the globe.\n\nThe House of the Spirits by Isabel Allende (1985) - A spellbinding saga of a Latin American family and their fortunes over three generations. Our team members also voted for other Allende works including Ines of My Soul, Of Love and Shadows and Daughter of Fortune.\n\nLabyrinths by Jorge Luis Borges (1962) - A compilation of fantastical tales that redefine reality and fiction from one of South America's finest writers.\n\nThis Thing of Darkness by Harry Thompson (2005) - An epic historical novel about the voyages of HMS Beagle and the complex relationship between Captain FitzRoy and Charles Darwin.\n\nAcross Patagonia by Lady Florence Dixie (1880) - An adventurous Victorian lady's travels and hunting experiences in the wilds of Patagonia.\n\nThe Uttermost Part of the Earth by Lucas Bridges (1948) - A unique insight into the life and customs of the indigenous people of Tierra del Fuego.\n\nIn Patagonia by Bruce Chatwin (1977) - A travelogue that combines the bizarre, the historical, and the personal in a quest across Patagonia.\n\nPatagonia Wild and Free by William Greenwood, Duncan Campbell & Gladys Grace-Paz (2015) - An exploration of Patagonia's vibrant wildlife and breathtaking landscapes.\n\n180° South: Conquerors of the Useless by Yvon Chouinard, Doug Tompkins, and Chris Malloy (2013) - Learn more about the people who made the original overland journey to Patagonia in 1968, and the repeat journey over ocean and land 40 years on.\n\nFalse Calm by María Sonia Cristoff (2018) - A narrative journey into the remote towns of Patagonia, revealing the untold stories of its inhabitants.\n\nVoyage of the Beagle by Charles Darwin (1839) - A groundbreaking scientific expedition that explores the rich diversity of plant and animal life across the globe.\n\nPatagonia - A Cultural History by Chris Moss (2008) - An exploration of Patagonia's mythical status in literature, history, and travel (including a section on Patagonian literature).\n\nEuropean Encounters with the Yamana people of Cape Horn by Anne Chapman (2023) - A narration of dramas played out from 1578-2000 in Tierra del Fuego, between the native Yamana and Charles Darwin, explorers, whalers and missionaries.\n\nThe Motorcycle Diaries by Ernesto Che Guevara (1952) - Read about the iconic journey that transformed a young Che Guevara and ignited his revolutionary spirit. Through Guevara's eyes, readers witness the transformative power of travel as he grapples with the stark realities of poverty and inequality.\n\nAlberto Granado, a biochemist and travel buddy of Che provides some light relief along the road. Their motorcycle nicknamed \"La Poderosa\" (The Powerful One) was the foundation for the memoir, although you'll have to see how long the bike lasts!\n\nThe film from 2004 directed by Walter Salles is also well worth a watch. It was nominated for several awards and won Best Film Not in the English Language at the BAFTAs.\n\nPatagonia, windswept and torn by sea, barren and rough, you hold the heart of a lonely earth, carved by the elements' glee.\n\nBruce Chatwin (1940-1989) - Already mentioned above and although primarily known for his travel writing and prose, Chatwin infused his works like \"In Patagonia\" with a poetic sensibility, capturing the lyrical beauty and enigmatic spirit of the Patagonian landscape through his evocative descriptions.\n\nGwyneth Lewis (b. 1959) - Though not specifically focused on Patagonia, Welsh poet Gwyneth Lewis includes reflections on her travels. Her works often touch on themes of exploration and the natural world, with Patagonia serving as an inspiring backdrop for her contemplative and vivid imagery.\n\nLiliana Ancalao (b. 1961) - A poet of Mapuche heritage, writes about Patagonia with a connection to its indigenous culture and history. Her poetry often explores identity, heritage, and the relationship between the land and its people. Ancalao's work emphasises the cultural and spiritual significance of the region.\n\nPablo Neruda (1904-1973) - The famous Chilean poet drew inspiration from the natural beauty of his homeland. His poetry captures the essence of wilderness and its links to the human experience. One of Neruda's most notable works, \"Canto General\", includes descriptive passages about the landscapes of South America, including Patagonia.\n\nThere is so much wonderful literature about this special part of the planet. A few standouts for me are In Patagonia, This Thing of Darkness and the wide-ranging scope and subject weavings in the work of Chris Moss. Pack an e-reader too if you can - it's an ideal way to unwind after an active day of exploring.\n\nWe're not surprised that Patagonia's raw beauty and vast (untamed) nature has inspired many filmmakers.\n\nHaving surveyed people about watching films and documentaries before their big trip to the region there is a divide - Those who want to watch absolutely nothing before their trip (want it all to be a surprise) versus those who want to get a sense of where they're going to enrich their experiences once they arrive.\n\nFor those of you in the latter category, we've put together a mini timeline in chronological order of possible films to check out...\n\nBegin your cinema journey with In Patagonia (1977), a classic film that introduces the region’s terrain and cultural history, setting the stage for understanding this remote area.\n\nJump forward to Scream of Stone (1991), which delves into the world of rock climbing set against the striking backdrop of the Patagonian landscape.\n\nMove on to Mi Mejor Enemigo (My Favourite Enemy) (2005), which explores personal rivalries and relationships within the dramatic setting.\n\nExperience the thrill of Wenger Patagonian Expedition Race 2011: The Last Wild Race, which documents a challenging adventure race through Patagonia’s demanding landscapes.\n\nWitness the climbing feats in A Line Across The Sky (2015), which follows climbers as they tackle some of Patagonia’s most iconic and challenging peaks.\n\nExplore environmental issues with A Story for Tomorrow (2016), addressing the conservation efforts and challenges faced in protecting these unique ecosystems.\n\nEnjoy the stunning visuals of Magical Andes (2020), showcasing the diverse and breathtaking scenery across the Andes in both Argentina and Chile.\n\nSettle in for the historical drama in Wakolda/The German Doctor (2013), set in Patagonia and blending a compelling story with the region’s atmospheric environment.\n\nBuckle up for Cerro Torre (2013), a documentary focusing on this formidable peak and the challenges faced by climbers attempting to conquer it.\n\nConclude with the Oscar-winning revenge story, The Revenant (2015), starring Leonardo De Caprio. Although set in the American Frontier the film was shot in Patagonia to visually enhance the intense survival elements.\n\nWe also wanted to give a special mention to the wonderful documentaries that shine a light on Patagonia. Again they can be a perfect primer for your trip or a great thing to watch on your return.\n\nYou can find many documentaries, but we particularly wanted to highlight three: Our Great National Parks, Wilderness and Wild Life. Plus a few extras if you could scroll down.\n\nPlease note that streaming platforms do change their content regularly. What's accessible is based on the region/country you live in - so you may have to use your investigation skills to hunt down the episodes.\n\nLove is a force of nature...\n\nThis eagerly awaited film by Oscar-winning directors Jimmy Chin and Chai Vasarhelyi tells the incredible love story of Doug and Kris Tompkins, who devoted their lives to preserving wild landscapes.\n\nThe 90-minute film centres on Kristine Tompkins, former CEO of Patagonia and co-founder of Tompkins Conservation. After falling in love later in life, Doug & Kris left their successful careers at Patagonia, The North Face, and Esprit to create national parks in Chile and Argentina, resulting in the largest private land donation in history.\n\nSpanning decades, the film showcases Kristine's personal and professional journey, featuring stunning Chilean wilderness footage and archival clips. It also highlights their friendship with Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard and Kris's early work with his company, which evolved into the Patagonia brand.\n\nIt also chronicles Doug's unfortunate death from hypothermia as part of a kayaking accident. This part is a hard watch but shows how it steeled Kris in her mission to build upon his legacy and the fight to preserve one of the last truly wild places on earth.\n\nRuntime: 90 minutes\n\nTrailer: Youtube\n\nAvailable on: Disney+ & Hulu\n\nIf you have access to BBC iPlayer I'd also give a shoutout to Race Across the World. Series 2 shows the teams travelling from Mexico down to Ushuaia, Argentina. It's a fun way to see South America from the comfort of your sofa and the personal stories of the different pairs are surprisingly impactful.\n\nThe Cordillera of Dreams (2019) - Produced by Icarus Films and directed by Patricio Guzmán - At times disturbing but compelling coverage of elements of Chilean history, in particular the dictatorship and recent civil unrest using an artistic style. Find out more here.\n\nPumas: Legends of the Ice Mountains (2021) - This documentary follows the captivating tale of a lineage of pumas, passed down through generations of mothers and daughters, unfolding against the backdrop of Patagonia's landscapes. According to Swoop Patagonia Expert, Harriet, this is the best Puma film available. Watch the preview or full episode here.\n\nThe Settlers (2023) - Set in 1901 Chile, three horsemen are hired to guard a large estate, joined by a British soldier and an American mercenary. Among them is a sniper who discovers the actual mission is to eliminate the indigenous people.\n\nIf you read or watch something from this guide do let your Customer Experience Coordinator know how you get on. We'd love to know your favourite. Also, do let us know if we've missed anything.\n\nTo conclude, with the words of one of the featured writers, Chris Moss:\n\n\"Despite the richness and variety of the literature, nothing ever equals the experience of seeing such natural beauty.\"\n\nHappy exploring in your imagination and on the ground in Patagonia!"
