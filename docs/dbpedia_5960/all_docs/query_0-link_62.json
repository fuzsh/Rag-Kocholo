Writer/director Lulu Wang imbues THE FAREWELL with warmth and knowing wit, while the uniformly excellent ensemble cast (anchored by a breakout performance by Awkwafina) invites us to share this extended clan’s joy and sorrow—and to feel, for the length of this remarkable film, like a part of their family.\n\n[New Mavericks]\n\nWriter-Director Lulu Wang scheduled to attend.\n\nOpening Night Film & Party Sponsored by Moonshine Post Production\n\nCLOSING NIGHT\n\nTHEM THAT FOLLOW\n\nDirected by Britt Poulton & Dan Madison Savage\n\nUSA, 2019, English, 98 minutes, The Orchard\n\nSaturday, April 13, 2019, 7:30 PM — Plaza Theatre\n\nIn the rugged wilderness of Appalachia, the members of an isolated community of Pentecostal snake handlers led by Pastor Lemuel (Walton Goggins) risk their lives to attest themselves before God.
