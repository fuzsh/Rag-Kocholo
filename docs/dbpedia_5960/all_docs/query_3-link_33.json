This story is based on Chatwin's experiences of working at Sotheby's and a collector, and is about Kasper Utz Harbouring his private collection of Meissen porcelains, that Utz found a refuge from the horrors of the twentieth century. Compared with the exquisite reality of his figurines, rescued and safe in the illusionist city of Prague, the Gestapo and the Secret Police were to Utz `creatures of tinsel'. It was the colourful Harlequin, `the Trickster', with whom nondescript Utz most identified. Utz too was adept at wriggling into positions of advantage, at outwitting authorities - and the love of his own Columbine was nearer at hand than he knew. By modelling and remodelling the figure of Utz as each new detail about his life is unearthed, Bruce Chatwin offers an insight into the fictional process itself. Utz was Chatwin's last novel, and was published in September 1988, it was shortlisted for the Booker Prize Chatwin was very ill . Size: 14.5 x 22cm Approx.\n\nJonathan Cape. UK. 1988.
