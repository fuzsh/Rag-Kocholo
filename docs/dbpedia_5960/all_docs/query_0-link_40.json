        "text": "For this issue, we're excited to claim a C&TH first. Arizona Muse, model and climate activist, is welcomed as our very first guest editor extolling the power of nature and regeneration. For the cover story, Lucy Cleland chats to both Arizona and fellow model and activist, Lily Cole about the fashion industry, motherhood, mental health and more. Fleur Britten digs deep into regenerative farming, claiming that soil is now a super-sexy topic â€“ with thanks to everyone from Jeremy Clarkson to Gisele Bundchen; and in a moving conversation, Annabel Heseltine talks through trauma with Christiana Figueras, the woman responsible for achieving the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. Full of inspiration, joy, wonder, and good advice, this issue will leave you brimming with ideas about how we can all do our bit to help heal our world."
