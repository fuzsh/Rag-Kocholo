        "text": "Bruce Chatwin's memorial service at St Sophia Greek Orthodox church in Bayswater was leant an unexpected drama by the proclamation of a fatwa against his friend Salman Rushdie who, having attended the service, disappeared from public view for some months. Neil Herrington's short story 'Blessed Is The Road On Which You Are Travelling Today', offers a fictionalised and emotive account of that February morning, and I'm delighted that he and The London Magazine have agreed to allow it to be reproduced at brucechatwin.co.uk. The story follows a short note from Neil – enjoy!\n\n\"Bruce Chatwin’s memorial service was held on the same day that the fatwa was announced on Salman Rushdie. The moment I read this, I thought there might be a story in it. I liked the idea of one writer’s travels coming to an end just as another was being forced out on the road.\n\nNicholas Shakespeare’s wonderful biography and the documentary, In the Footsteps of Bruce Chatwin, provided me with some of the details, but I would have to make up the rest. I hoped the tension that would arise between fact and fiction would prove to be an apt means of representing a writer whose books were always difficult to categorise in terms of fiction or travel literature.\n\nThe story, Blessed Is The Road On Which You Are Travelling Today, was first published in The London Magazine. I’m delighted that it has now been reproduced here on the Bruce Chatwin website.\"\n\n'Blessed Is the Road On Which You Are Travelling Today' by Neil Herrington"
