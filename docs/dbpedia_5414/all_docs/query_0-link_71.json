        "text": "Nature writer, environmentalist, essayist, educator, conservationist, and former president of the National Parks Association, Sigurd F. Olson had a long career working in wilderness areas. For some, such as myself, he is best remembered for his gentle, thoughtful reflections of nature found in books like Listening Point, The Singing Wilderness, or Runes of the North (among others).\n\nEditor David Backes has previously written a biography of Olson and put together a collection of Olson’s notable quotes, but with this book we get our best, most intimate look at Sigurd F. Olson, the man, the dreamer.\n\nAs I only know of Olson from his published books of nature reflection, what struck me here was how much he agonized over his desire to be a writer – to be able to quit his other work (primarily, early on, as a college teacher) and just be outdoors and writing. And when he wasn’t waxing on about his desire to just focus on writing, he was wondering and worrying about what to write. In his earliest days he was writing short stories but having limited luck selling them. With each rejection would come angst-filled journal entries questioning whether or not he could do this, generally followed by yes, what should he write.\n\nThis is often quite repetitive, but editor David Backes does a great job of selecting entries that differ just enough to show Olson’s frame of mind during these different periods and how Olson slowly grows into the author most of us know him as.\n\nFor those who might be drawn to this, hoping for some wilderness connections – there is some here. Olson spent his time and his thoughts in the outdoors, and that comes through in his personal reflections.\n\nYoung or hopeful writers will understand Olson’s frustrations about making time to write and the hard questioning of one’s work with each rejection. That Olson ultimately became quite successful with his goal gives every amateur writer hope.\n\nThe book includes a few photos from the appropriate time periods and often showing someone that Olson mentions in one of his journal entries.\n\nWe have to remember that journal entries are meant to be private reflections and never intended for a general readership and even though nicely edited, there are times when we sometimes feel we’re intruders.\n\nI highly recommend this book.\n\nLooking for a good book? A Private Wilderness: The Journals of Sigurd F. Olson is just what the title suggests – a look at the man, Sigurd Olson, through his private journal writings. It is an excellent book on many levels (such as nature writing, autobiography, psychology, and the business of writing).\n\nI received a digital copy of this book from the publisher, through Netgalley, in exchange for an honest review.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nA Private Wilderness: The Journals of Sigurd F.

Simple. To love and be loved. Ambiguity was my enemy.”\n\nMichael Moorcock – The Whispering Swarm\n\nFrom my first post of book quotes I wrote:\n\nFor about as long as I have been reading, I have collected quotes. What makes a good quote? I think it’s a snippet of writing that speaks volumes. It is the prose version of a poem – something that, in a condensed manner, waxes philosophic on a subject. Or it might be a turn of a phrases that perfectly captures or identifies a moment. Or might just be a sentence that makes me burst out laughing.\n\nThere have been times that I’ve looked back on a quote and wondered why I had thought a quote worth saving, but more often than not, I’ve enjoyed looking back on the quotes I’ve collected.\n\nI thought it might be nice to share some of the quotes I’ve been finding in the books I’ve been reading for this blog. I hope you enjoy these as well.\n\nMy collection of quotes has been growing rapidly, but I’ve been slow on sharing them. I hope I can change that in 2019.\n\n* * * * * *\n\n“I think maybe my waking life is becoming so interesting that I don’t need to dream things up anymore.”\n\nThe Strange Gift of Gwendolyn Golden by Philippa Dowding\n\n“All I want to do with my life is get out and fly above the troubles of this crappy world.”\n\nThe Strange Gift of Gwendolyn Golden by Philippa Dowding\n\n“You’re alone when you die, even if you’re surrounded by hundreds.”\n\nA Fistful of Charms by Kim Harrison\n\n“People are a precious commodity, in bulk.

In this case, I hadn’t yet read the book when I agreed to let E. Van Lowe have a little bit of space on this blog. But I was attracted by his writing history – a television writer/producer and author of some successful YA books.\n\nAnd he’s male.\n\nThere are clearly a number of male authors writing Young Adult fiction, but most of them are writing action/adventure fiction and often in the science fiction/fantasy genre. How many male authors can you think of are writing YA in a romantic vein? Romance for boys? You bet! But that doesn’t mean there isn’t any action or that … well… you can read my review after this.\n\nAnyway, here’s a working writer, with a new book out, and I invited him to say whatever it was he might want to say. And when he’s done, I hope you’ll click the link at the end and enter the drawing for a free e-copy of his new book.\n\nE … it’s all yours…\n\n◊ ◊ ◊ ◊ ◊ ◊ ◊ ◊\n\nDamned Internet\n\nI’ve noticed something strange lately. I don’t read as many books as I used to. I used to love to curl up in bed or on the sofa and devour a good book. But lately I can’t seem to stay focused. I know why. It’s that damned internet. It keeps calling me. It’s like that old Twilight Zone episode where a guy goes to Las Vegas for the first time and discovers slot machines. You know the one I’m talking about? He goes back to his room and tries to go to bed but he hears his name being called in a loud whisper. “Franklin.” The slot machines are calling.\n\nThat’s how I feel. The internet is calling and I must heed the call: email, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, my blog. I must check them. I MUST CHECK THEM!\n\nLast evening, I sat in the living room, book in hand and began to read: “Franklin.” (I know that’s not my name but it has an ominous ring to it). A few nights ago I lay in bed, picked up my book and began to read: “Franklin.” I realize I just checked my email ten minutes ago so I continue reading… “Franklin!” But when was the last time I checked my Facebook page? An entire hour ago. It’s important that I find out what Barbara Jensen had for lunch, so I stop reading and I check.\n\nI’ve been reading the current book I’m on for nearly a month now. Yes, it’s interesting. No, it’s not as long as War And Peace. But I can’t get through it. Am I alone in this? Do any of you out there have this problem? That damned internet is destroying my life. Someone has to shut it down. It’s dangerous… Excuse me? What was that?\n\n“Franklin.”\n\nTime to sign off. I have to check my Twitter stream.\n\nAside from being addicted to the internet, I am an author who writes with a sense of humor. I have a new book called Moondancers. If you like a little paranormal with your romance, this book is for you. You can find out more about me on my website. http://evanlowe.com/ By the way, my books are addictive, just like that damned internet.\n\n◊ ◊ ◊ ◊ ◊ ◊ ◊ ◊\n\nYes! Yes, E, I have that same problem. But I’m glad it’s not keeping you from writing!\n\nPlease enter the giveaway for a copy of Moondancers by clicking the link below. There will be five lucky winners. But I promise, anyone can be lucky just by giving this a read.\n\na Rafflecopter giveaway for Moondancers\n\nCheck out my review which you can find right down there ⇓.\n\nQuotes from the books I’ve been reading.

I’ll tell you what: badly written novels about nice girls and boys falling in love, who make each other suffer without meaning to, and spend all their time crying and saying they’re sorry. Ridiculous.\n\nThe Library of Unrequited Love – Sophie Divry\n\nThe readers down here, they’re seriously depressed and that cheers me up.\n\nThe Library of Unrequited Love – Sophie Divry\n\nYou only need one ray of light to chase all the shadows away.\n\nA Man Called Ove – Fredrik Backman\n\nMany people find it difficult living with someone who likes to be alone.\n\nA Man Called Ove – Fredrik Backman\n\nIllusion is a story. Weave it with characters and feelings and love and loss and the audience will follow you as surely as the children of Hamlyn followed the Pied Piper.\n\nThe Bullet-Catcher’s Daughter – Rod Duncan\n\nNever repeat a trick, for the same eyes may not be misdirected twice. And never return to the same pitch.\n\nThe Bullet-Catcher’s Daughter – Rod Duncan\n\nIt is in our faults and failings, not in our virtues, that we touch each other, and find sympathy. It is in our follies that we are one.\n\n-Edgar Allan Poe\n\nShe was some kind of rockabilly goddess, with a halter top showing off an uneasy détente between cleavage and tattoos.\n\nGet Blank – Justin Robinson\n\nI didn’t spend a decade being paranoid for nothing.\n\nGet Blank – Justin Robinson\n\nIt’s time for a few more quotes from some of my recent readings.
