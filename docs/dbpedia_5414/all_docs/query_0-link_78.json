        "text": "Omg next chapter is the one I've had written since like July. It's not completely finished but it won't take long. I can't believe this book is nearly finished!\n\nAnyways, much love and kisses!\n\n-the bored writer\n\nIt was March.\n\nCalifornia warmed up quickly as it got closer to the spring months and Mike was growing unhappy with it.\n\n\"I wish it snowed here like it does back home,\" Mike had said.\n\n\"You're from Texas, babe.\"\n\n\"It snows at least once a year though. Here it's just dry and sometimes gets chilly. I want snow.\"\n\n\"Then let's take a vacation.\"\n\nMicky appeared from the kitchen. Davy followed shortly, his mouth covered in red, probably from one of Micky's snow cones. Mike snickered and said,\"Is Valleri on her perio-\"\n\n\"YES! VACATION SOUNDS LOVELY.\"\n\nI shouted as I cut him off. For such a seemingly innocent boy, he sure had a dirty mind. Peter came in from the warm outdoors with a towel over his shoulder, his hair damp. \"Vacation? Where to?\"\n\n\"Somewhere with snow,\" Mike declared.\n\n\"My uncle Mark-Andrew owns a ranch up in Washington. He told me I could visit any time I see fit. I'll write him a letter-\"\n\n\"How old fashioned are you, Micky?\"\n\n\"Mike, you write your grandma Lou a letter every night.\"\n\n\"That's because she's 93! She wouldn't consider touching a telephone, nevermind answer one.\"\n\nI rolled my eyes as Micky continued. \"Anyways, I can write to him this evening, and see if the ranch is available right now. It snows a lot up there in the winter months.\"\n\nMike clapped his hands joyously.\n\n\"Personally, I hate the cold.\" Davy wiped his mouth as he stated his opinion.\n\n\"But you like us,\" Peter said as he ruffled his damp hair with his towel. Davy groaned. \"That, unfortunately, is quite true.\"\n\n\"So we're doing this?\" Micky sounded excited to be the host of this new adventure. Everyone raised their hands and we all clapped. Micky took off to his room to \"Get right to it,\" and Davy went back into the kitchen. Peter trailed into his and Davy's room and left Mike and I alone in the living room. Mike grinned at me.\n\n\"I love snow.\"\n\n\"I can tell, I like it too. Say, I'll need to figure which outfits to wear. I can't go on vacation looking like a hobo.\"\n\nMike smiled at me mischievously. \"Make sure you pack something dressy. I might take you out for dinner.\"\n\nI returned his sly smile. \"Is that so?\"\n\nHe winked at me. Oh that wink made me feel things that aren't properly allowed to be felt.\n\n\"That is for me to know, and for you to find out.\"\n\n~*~\n\nDear Mick,\n\nI would be happy to have you boys here! Unfortunately, Lesley, Randy, and I are heading to Randy's Archery championship during the week that we discussed. If you boys decide to come, we won't be there to show you the sights, as though you need them. Feel free to come anyways, though. I'll leave a list of instructions for the house (the property is taken care of by our ranch hand, Larr) and we might see you boys on our way out.\n\nLove you, Mick. See you soon, I hope!\n\nThe following week...\n\nWe left as soon as Micky got the letter that weekend. The trip to Forks, Washington, was a short flight which mainly consisted of Peter throwing up and Davy getting a really bad pressure toothache. Mike, who confessed that he loved flying, couldn't help but laugh at the two invalids. That is, until he himself got sick on the bad egg salad. While the other three were sick, Micky and I talked about cats. Apparently Micky was extremely allergic but he owned three when he was in highschool.\n\n\"Why don't we get a cat for the house?\" I suggested.\n\n\"I-urg-hate cats.\"\n\nDavy groaned out his protest. I glared at him.\n\n\"Cats are Gods way of showing us that there are aliens among us that we can have as pets, even though they always have a vengeful nature towards us.\"\n\n\"That's a shockingly perfect answer to that statement. I'm impressed.\"\n\nMicky gave me a fist bump and Peter vomited into the third small bag the stewardess had brought him. I gently stroked his back and handed him a mint, which he gingerly ate. Mike was fast asleep by now. That boy slept more then anyone I knew. And he slept through anything! He once slept through Valleri and Davy making out loudly in the kitchen. They're practically the same room. You could have sex on top of a sleeping Mike and he wouldn't even move.\n\nWhen we finally landed and made it to the farm, everyone was exhausted from the flight, whether reason be sickness or boredom.\n\nThere was so much snow on the ground. Mike almost had a heart attack. He was running around and jumping in snow drifts like a little kid. It made me happy to see him having such a wonderful time.\n\nThe ranch was beautiful: there was a large log cabin and a huge barn and a pond within walking distance from the cabin (it looked to be covered with ice) and the snow just made it look like a scene from a Christmas card.\n\nMicky's aunt, uncle, and cousin were leaving the house when we arrived at the cabin. Micky introduced us all and his uncle Mark-Andrew gave each of us a bear hug, (Peter nearly threw up again) and told us how excited he was to have us stay at his place. He and his wife Lesley (she didn't say anything to any of us, but we didn't take it personally: she looked like an introvert) loaded their car.\n\nMicky's cousin Randy, who looked about 19, gave us all sour looks. His gaze fell on me. I was standing there, wearing a blouse that revealed my cleavage a little more then I liked ( I had made the mistake of wearing something perfect for LA weather and terrible for Forks weather).\n\nRandy looked me over and I immediately felt uncomfortable under his gaze.\n\n\"Who's this, Micky? I didn't know you were bringing a girl, I might've stayed.\"\n\nSuddenly, Mike had appeared at my side and he was spanking my rear with one of his large hands while the other hand took my hand in his. It was quite a loud THWACK!\n\nHe had never done this before, but dang, I liked it.\n\nRandy nodded, looking as though he understood and said, \"Ah, so she's your girl?\"\n\nMike nodded solemnly, now wrapping his hand protectively around my waist and pulling me to him. He lifted one eyebrow as if you say, \"Go ahead and challenge me, hoe.\"\n\nRandy muttered, \"Sheesh, I get the picture, Bismarck.\"\n\n\"Nesmith. Get it right next time.\"\n\nHe rolled his eyes at my words. Randy got in the car with his parents and they waved goodbye to us before driving down the long dirt drive. I sighed with relief and looked at Mike, who was grinning at me. I knew he hated it when someone got his name wrong. He pressed a kiss to my cheek, and I laughed.\n\nMy gaze fell on Peter, who was holding a bottle of soda, which was crushed in his grip. He looked like he was about to have an aneurysm.\n\n\"Can. You. Not.\"\n\nMike smirked, this time full on grabbing my rear with both hands and kissing me passionately. When we broke apart, Peter was just gone. I heard a shriek from inside the house and Davy and Micky yell, \"NO, PETER, THOSE STEAK KNIVES ARE NOT FOR GAUGING OUT YOUR EYES!\""
