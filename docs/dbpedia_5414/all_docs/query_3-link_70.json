        "text": "By Cary Ginell\n\nSpecial To The Star\n\nHere they come ...\n\nThe three surviving Monkees ? Micky Dolenz, Peter Tork and Mike Nesmith ? will appear at the Arlington Theatre in Santa Barbara tonight and the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles on Saturday as part of a 12-city nationwide tour, the group's first since the passing of fourth member Davy Jones from a sudden heart attack at age 66 this past February.\n\nThe Monkees were a phenomenon in the 1960s, created to capitalize on Beatlemania, but for an American television audience. In time, the quartet decided to become a real group and play their own instruments. To the music world's surprise, they showed a great deal of talent on their subsequent albums.\n\nAfter \"The Monkees\" series was canceled in 1968, the group slowly disintegrated. Beginning in 1986, successful reunion tours brought Dolenz, Tork and Jones back together regularly ? but Nesmith rarely participated. His appearance on this tour marks only the second time since 1969 that he's taken part in a Monkees tour; his last jaunt with the group came in 1997.\n\nFor Monkees fans, this is a melancholy time; they're excited about Nesmith's return, but sad Jones isn't around to take part.\n\nThe tour came together after Dolenz, Tork and Nesmith got together in Los Angeles at a private memorial for Jones.\n\n\"This seems like a good time to do this ? the right time,\" Nesmith said in August when the tour was announced. \"Who knows when we will get another chance?\"\n\nThis week on The Monkees' Facebook page, Nesmith began dropping hints about what the shows will be like. Fans can expect some deep album cuts, like \"Tapioca Tundra\" and \"Daily Nightly,\" alongside more familiar hits like \"Pleasant Valley Sunday.\" Special emphasis will be placed on the group's third album, \"Headquarters,\" which featured such songs as \"Shades of Gray,\" \"For Pete's Sake,\" \"No Time\" and \"You Just May Be the One.\"\n\n\"So far so good,\" Nesmith wrote on Facebook, referring to the tour rehearsals. \"Back-up band sounds good. Mick and Pete are in fine form. I'm happy and working hard to learn all the songs. It's been a long time, but I'm getting up to speed.\"\n\nDolenz, the group's drummer and singer of such hits as \"Last Train to Clarksville\" and \"I'm a Believer,\" has lived in Ventura County for 10 years. When he was a child actor, he starred in \"Circus Boy,\" which was filmed at the old Jungleland facility in Thousand Oaks. In September, he released a new CD called \"Remember,\" which features versions of songs that had significant meaning for him during the '60s and '70s.\n\nIn a phone interview last month, the 67-year-old Dolenz chatted about the concert tour and the group's history.\n\nHad there been plans for a tour before Davy passed away?\n\nYeah, there were, actually. At the end of last year, we'd already started talking about other projects. One was an idea about doing \"Headquarters\" in its entirety. It sounded like a great idea. But then the holidays came along, and when David passed away in February, it looked like everything was going to come to a standstill.\n\nMike and Peter and I were here in Los Angeles, and everyone wanted us to do a memorial concert. We tried to figure out where we would do it because David had friends and family all over the place. So that and the \"Headquarters\" idea evolved into a 12-city tour.\n\nThough we're not calling it the \"Davy Jones Memorial Tour,\" he will definitely be remembered and there will be a tribute and homage to him.\n\nHow is it working with Mike Nesmith again?\n\nMike is a consummate musician and entertainer and always keeps his chops up. We had to go back into the library and relearn some of those early Monkee tunes that we hadn't done in a long, long time, especially the ones he wrote and sang.\n\nSo what's the new show going to include?\n\nWe're going to be sticking mainly with \"Headquarters,\" the Brill Building hits, and then some of the songs we started writing and producing ourselves.\n\n\"Headquarters\" was the result of the four of you demanding to play your instruments on an album instead of studio musicians. What do you think of it today?\n\nWell, not only had we fought for the right to do it, but it turned out to be very successful, so I'm very proud of it. I was never a big songwriter and that's why it was Mike who spearheaded the \"palace revolt.\" And I don't blame him. He wanted to get some of his material out there and listened to, because it was great material. I think he'd been promised that when he first signed on and it didn't turn out that way.\n\nTalk about the TV show and the characters you played.\n\n\"The Monkees\" was a television show about a group. But we weren't just actors playing parts. The audition process was expensive and involved singing, playing, acting and improvisation. My audition piece was \"Johnny B. Goode.\" Peter plays four or five instruments; Mike was a singer-songwriter; and David had been on Broadway. So the show was about this imaginary group, and at one point, as Mike put it, Pinocchio became a little boy. The closest thing to come along in that sort of paradigm is \"Glee,\" which is a show about an imaginary glee club. But they can actually sing, dance and act. The fact that The Monkees did it 40 years ago was unheard of back then.\n\nDo you remember your first live performance?\n\nI remember that KHJ radio rented a train and got a bunch of photographers and kids dressed up in hippie gear and took this train down to Del Mar where the mayor renamed the town Clarksville for the day. And we were flown in by helicopter and played a couple of tunes on the train on the way back. The film crew didn't even think to tie down the drums. The first time I heard a Monkee tune on the radio was \"Clarksville,\" and it was on KHJ that day. Davy and I were driving back from filming the TV show and we pulled into the driveway and all of a sudden it came on.\n\nHow do you view The Monkees today?\n\nI don't look at it as a band. It was a cast for a television show that became a band. It's more like musical theater to me. I've done a lot of that, so when we get back together, it's like we're re-creating the roles. So I'm playing the role of Micky, the wacky drummer of The Monkees in this musical comedy.\n\nWere you all big Beatles fans?\n\nAll of us were, but I was especially a huge, huge Beatles fan. They had an enormous impact on everybody. When I went to England in 1967, I met Paul McCartney and he invited me to Abbey Road to hear \"Sgt. Pepper,\" which they were making then. I was there when they were recording the tracks for \"Good Morning, Good Morning.\" That's one of the reasons it's on my new CD. We even got The Beatles' version played on the TV show, which was unheard of at the time. It was an episode that I wrote and directed called \"The Frodis Caper.\"\n\nWhat did The Beatles think of your show?\n\nThey got it. John Lennon was the one who said The Monkees were like the Marx Brothers, and that was very accurate. You see, the difference between us and them was that on the TV show, we were never famous. That was a very important element to the success of the show because it was the struggle for success that the audience related to. In The Beatles' movies, they were famous already. But we were just an out-of-work garage band that wanted to be The Beatles.\n\nYou were one of the first people to play the Moog synthesizer on a pop record, on The Monkees' album \"Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn and Jones Ltd.\" Talk about that experience.\n\nI got it from Paul Beaver, who was representing Robert Moog here on the West Coast. I had the second one ever made. Eventually, I sold it to Bobby Sherman in the early '70s, who had a lot of equipment at his house. I was learning how to program it for the entire time I had it. It wasn't easy. It was an incredibly sophisticated and powerful instrument. I was working on it until the day I sold it.\n\nWhat do you think of \"Head\" now? Was that ahead of its time?\n\nEither ahead of its time or in another time (laughs). I'm very proud of the movie. If you look at the people involved ? Bob Rafelson, Bert Schneider and Jack Nicholson ? and the guys they were hanging with at the time like Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper, that was the beginning of the independent film industry in Hollywood. These were the young bucks trying to break into the Hollywood studio system. The movie is about the deconstruction of this system and the deconstruction of The Monkees.\n\nTalk about your new CD.\n\nThe album is an audio scrapbook of my life. My producer and arranger David Harris had a lot to do with these re-envisioned arrangements and the tone of the songs. All the songs have stories about them; they all have a reason for being there.\n\nI came up with some unusual treatments for things like \"Johnny B. Goode,\" \"Good Morning, Good Morning\" and a couple of others. David had the idea of giving \"Randy Scouse Git\" a kind of a Coldplay feel. I always thought that \"I'm a Believer\" would make a really cool country tune, so we did that too.\n\nI'm very proud of that CD.\n\nWill you do these versions at the concert?\n\nYou gotta be very careful because there's an expectation when you go out and do a show, especially with the big, big hit Monkee tunes. Audiences want to hear \"I'm a Believer\" like they remember it. Mike put it really well when he said, \"We don't own these songs anymore. They do.\" Artists need to remember that.\n\nWhat about \"Daydream Believer\"?\n\nThat belongs to the audience, too. And it belonged to David. I can't ever imagine doing any other kind of version of that. It's going to be tough enough doing it at all.\n\nWho is going to sing lead on it?\n\nThat ... is a surprise!\n\n? ? ?\n\nTHE MONKEES"
