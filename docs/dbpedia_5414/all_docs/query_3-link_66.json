        "text": "Today in the “rock room” we undertake a reconstruction of a\n\ncritical yet underrepresented player of the “Country Rock” era of the mid to late\n\n1960’s. Michael Nesmith, singer, songwriter, renaissance man of the Monkees, attempted to bring the country music aesthetic of his upbringing into the pop\n\nworld of his made for television rock and roll band. As early as the Monkees\n\ndebut LP in 1966 Michael had contributed his own original music to the group,\n\noften facing consternation from the producers who were searching for “hits”\n\nwritten by Brill Building composers who\n\nwere kicking out songs like a sausage factory.\n\nToward the end of the Monkees astronomical popularity, Nez\n\nstarted to focus his energies on his own musical future. From May 31st\n\nthrough June 2nd 1968 country music pioneer, Michael Nesmith, laid down nine of\n\nhis songs with pro Nashville musicians who played under the moniker “Area Code\n\n615”. These musicians were the best of\n\nthe best and offered their abilities to a plethora of famed records and\n\nperformances from the era including Dylan’s Blonde On Blonde.\n\nSmack dab in the middle of a world wide musical maelstrom\n\nNesmith’s extreme foresight and creativity was given the freedom to run with\n\nhis muse. Following the completion of filming on the Monkees film Head, Nesmith\n\nteamed with producer Felton Jarvis (Elvis Presley) to record nine of his own\n\ncompositions. The original intent was for a Monkees record in which each\n\nrespective member would be represented on one side of the double record set. While\n\nthe sessions took place for this Monkees next prospective LP, Nesmith used them\n\nto relieve a constipation of unique original music that had been building since\n\nhis joining the Monkees.\n\nCharlie McCoy, David Briggs, Wayne Moss, Bobby Thompson,\n\nNorbert Putnam, Felton Jarvis, Lloyd Green and Kenny Buttrey helped to make up\n\nthis collaborative who was a veritable “who’s who” of country music session\n\nmen. All the players would go on to have stellar careers in the field.\n\nNesmith had been disenchanted for a while in regards to the\n\ntreatment of his compositions under the “Monkees” moniker, and had started to\n\ncultivate plans for his own music. While the Monkees had visited Nashville in\n\nlate 1967 for sessions, Nesmith had a more finite vision for the May 1968\n\nsessions. He would continue to mine his work during this era for songs for the\n\nnext five or more years.\n\nNesmith had already recorded an instrumental album of his own\n\ncompositions during a 1967 visit to Hollywood which resulted in the July 1968\n\nalbum The Wichita Train Whistle Sings. Backed by the famed “Wrecking\n\nCrew” Nesmith spent $50,000 of his own money to create a proper first “solo”\n\nrecording.\n\nInspired by his contemporaries the Beatles and Byrds, and Frank Zappa, Nesmith felt a need to express his artistic abilities outside of the confines\n\nof the “bubblegum” Monkees. Still underrepresented in music history for his cutting-edge\n\ndissemination of country rock, the lack of tragedy in Nesmith’s life must have\n\nmade him uninteresting in the analysis of his contributions. Gene Clark, Gram Parsons\n\nand others, while deserving of their musical accolades are often thought of\n\nbefore Nesmith.\n\nNez had been writing country rock for years prior and now\n\nthat mainstream rock artists were combining genres into new and exciting music,\n\nNesmith felt the freedom to join the movement even though he was the one\n\npulling the cart. Nez remembered, I could just feel this happening, that there was this thing. So, I headed off to Nashville to see if I couldn’t get some of the Nashville country thing into the rock and roll or vice versa.” The May/June Nashville sessions in RCA Records\n\nstudio A would unknowingly become the influential lodestone for what would become\n\nthe alternative country rock movement.\n\nMost of the music recorded during Nesmith’s visit to Nashville\n\nwould end up being piecemealed throughout several both solo Nesmith records and\n\nalternate Monkee releases. Some as Monkee singles, some as “First National Band”\n\ncuts and some as unreleased deep cuts. The\n\n“rock room” has taken the liberty to collect the available recordings and\n\ncollect them into a proper collection. The hope is that someday this effort is\n\ndone on an official level and Michael Nesmith’s stellar and influential 1968\n\nNashville sessions are given a proper historical view.\n\nIt is the “rock room’s” humble opinion that if the Nashville\n\nsessions would have been released as a proper Nesmith solo LP in 1968 it would\n\nhave been one of the greatest records of the country rock genre and rock albums\n\nof the era. Nesmith was authentic and came at the music from the inside.\n\nCollecting these tracks together lets us imagine the prospect of a 1968 Nesmith\n\nsolo LP.\n\nThe “rock room” presents Michael Nesmith and Area Code\n\n615 – Listen to the Band:\n\nThis Side:\n\nListen to the Band– Our opening track on side A was\n\nrecorded on June 1, 1968 and ended up being the only Monkees A side single\n\ncomposed by Nesmith when released in 1969 (with later overdubs). The song was recorded in Nashville\n\nand features stratospheric pedal steel and a catchy series of chord changes\n\nthat Nesmith revealed came from his song “Nine Times Blue” but played\n\nbackwards. A powerful cut that Nez would recut with the First National Band in\n\n1970. A rare Monkees live version was spotlighted on the 1969 television\n\nspecial 33 1/3 Revolutions per Monkee. A tune of such majesty that it’s title has become synonymous with its author.\n\nPropinquity (I’ve Just Begun to Care)– One of Nez’s\n\nearliest compositions, the reading found on Missing Links Volume 3 hails from the first day of sessions on May 29, 1968 and is a superior rendition. An earlier solo\n\ndemo circulates with a more up-tempo rhythm, while this version has slowed to increase its poignancy. Glittering Nesmith twelve\n\nstring strums carry some of his finest vocals ever. Double tracked and harmonizing\n\nwith himself, Mike’s mature grasp of the country form is stunning. In\n\nhindsight, Mike’s compositions from this era (also to be inspected on his Fall\n\n1967 demos) are beyond his contemporaries, but unfortunately obscured by his\n\npop culture backlisting by the hip musical experts of the time.\n\nSt. Matthew– One of Nesmith’s finest unreleased\n\nsongs. First attempted during The Birds, Bees, and the Monkees sessions,\n\nMike returned to the song on June 2, 1968. Nesmith reveled in an interview that\n\nthe song was influenced by Bob Dylan’s “She Belongs to Me” and that he later\n\nunderstood that the track was a commentary on Dylan’s biblical representations\n\nof the Holy Ghost in his songs. The instrumentation is the perfect collaboration\n\nof rock, country, funk and feel. Over a strong arrangement of mush of chorused guitars, slick\n\nfiddles, and steady drums Nesmith’s hearty echoed wail comes down from the top of the\n\nhill, telling the tail of beautiful St. Matthew’s doings.\n\nThe Crippled Lion– The gentle clip clop of “The\n\nCrippled Lion” is an enduring Nesmith melody, sparse in its 1968 arrangement\n\nallowing the melody to focus on Nesmith’s reassuring timbre. Acoustic guitar,\n\ndrums and steel delicately drift over Papa Nez’s reclining chair arrangement.\n\nThe song would reappear on Nesmith’s debut solo record Magnetic South, but\n\nthis particular reading (found on The Monkees Missing Links Volume Two) emits a\n\nconfident magic that evades description.\n\nThat Side:\n\nGood Clean Fun– A song that would become the opening\n\nnumber of the Monkees 1969 trio LP The Monkees Present. Nesmith is his\n\ntypically sardonic style turned the song into band management with the title of\n\nthe song not mentioned once in the lyrics. This was after he was told by a publisher that single’s needed to be “Good Clean Fun”. A undistilled country number the\n\nsong moves eagerly on squiggling fiddles and honky banjo.\n\nDon’t Wait For Me– The work done on this song on May\n\n29th, 1968 resulted in the track being officially included on the Monkees 1969 LP Instant\n\nReplay. The song, another Nez weeper, features his 12 string acoustic guitar and Lloyd\n\nGreen’s mournful steel work. A highlight of Instant Replay and a definite\n\ndeparture from the overall sound of the record.\n\nSome of Shelly’s Blues– A song originally released in\n\n1968 by Linda Rondstadt and the Stone Poneys, Nez’s definitive Nashville recording\n\nfrom May 29th would remain unreleased until its appearance on 1990’s\n\nMissing Links Volume 2. Pleading double tracked vocals and emotional\n\nlyrical eavesdropping highlight the chilling recording. While Nez would\n\nre-record the song on 1973’s Just Your Standard Ranch Stash, there is\n\nsomething in the water on the Nashville 1968 recordings.\n\nHollywood– A song that would never see and official\n\nrelease by the Monkees, “Hollywood” is a shuffling country lament about leaving\n\nthe glitz and glamor of the left coast behind for a more comfortable living\n\nsituation. Nesmith’s swinging vocals nurture the fiddle heavy shit kicking\n\narrangement. If this track would have been released as a single, the future Flying\n\nBurrito Brothers heads would have exploded. Nesmith would revisit the song on 1970’s Magnetic South.\n\nHow Insensitive– We close our hypothetical Michael\n\nNesmith solo record with his dramatic cover of a bossa nova standard by Antonia Carlos\n\nJobim. Nez takes the Brazilian and makes it country with a low key rearrangement\n\nand an emotive vocal. Banjo, acoustic guitar and fiddle weave a lacy spell\n\nunder Nez’s almost monotone rendition. A fitting closer, and a song that sums up our hypothetical collection from the 68′ sessions.\n\nThankfully, Michael Nesmith was well aware of the cache of\n\namazing music he had in his grasp in 1968. While mainstream recognition was\n\nplentiful, Nesmith’s personal musical satisfaction remained out of his grasp\n\nuntil he left the Monkees. Nesmith struggled with his early pop family connections for much\n\nof his life. The songs he recorded in Nashville in 1968 while alluding their\n\nconfirmation as era specific examples of the country rock movement, have now\n\nbeen recognized due to Mike’s own career accomplishments receiving a reinspection."
