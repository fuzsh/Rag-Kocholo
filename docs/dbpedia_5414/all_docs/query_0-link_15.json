        "text": "Oh man. I’ve lost count of the number of conversations I have had with my great friends Leo and Hughes about this great man, his band and the Americana style that he pioneered which no doubt lead us to the Ryan Adams/Jesse Malin country tinged rock of the 90’s and beyond.\n\nI put on my latest playlist to write this difficult piece and three songs in, after The Beatles and The Beach Boys, there he is with the classic You Just May Be The One, one of my faves of all time and Hughes’ very favourite. And that is the company The Monkees/Nesmith deserve to keep. Sure, to some people they were just a bubblegum pop extension of The Beatles ideas and ideals, but the story is much more interesting than that. Sure early records (I remember the first time I found a Monkees vinyl, the debut, in my mom’s collection and could not believe that this ‘make believe’ band that I enjoyed weekly on TV had real records. And they were great! Thanks Mom!) may have been ‘just’ pure pop, but they often equalled the pop thrills that Liverpool’s own had cemented into the mainstream and there are some great great pop writers behind the scenes, I don’t see Neil Diamond giving away a classic to any bunch of ragtag Bohemians.\n\nVenture past the (brilliant) Best Of records and you’ll find all kinds of psychedelia and trippy works as well as romantic yearning equal to anything Dylan or your fave millennial came up with. And then there was Head. Yes, The Monkees made a movie, but it was nothing like the TV show that preceded it, it was much closer in tone to Slade In Flame, another excellent look at the upside and downside of being in a famous band. See the band being dandruff! Surreal as all hell, the film continues to get noticed now for just being nothing like you expect. Thank you Jack Nicholson, but also Nesmith is obviously in his element here.\n\nAs with all bands of the era, they came and went in different incarnations but it is only the albums Pool It and Just Us that I would not recommend in the year 2021. I was lucky enough to see the four piece Monkees with Leo at the Cardiff CIA and it was one of the best shows I have ever seen. I also got the chance to see Mike’s son Jason Nesmith with one of my other fave bands Nancy Boy, one of the American glam Britpoppers also featuring Donovan’s son Donovan Leitch. We met both these members of Nancy Boy and they were so happy I had bought a t shirt, it was fantastic. We also met Davy and Peter and had great chats about Head, whilst women old enough to know better tried to get very close to them…Of course, this is before everyone had a camera in their pocket and an online gallery, but they are grand memories, especially today.\n\nCheck out my Best Of The Monkees below and check out any and all the Nesmith you can.\n\nGodspeed, sir, truly one of the greats. ❤"
