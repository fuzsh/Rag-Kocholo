        "text": "At the top of our survey of the music of 1972, we noted, “By the start of 1972, the major artists and styles of the ’60s were beginning to give way to new names that would come to dominate the still-unfolding decade.” That trend picked up steam in 1973, as pop music styles diversified even more and the ’70s truly forged its own identity.\n\nWhile some ’60s superstars hung on (the individual Beatles, in particular; the Rolling Stones; several classic Motown acts), our 1973 timeline is devoid of many of the others. New names are poking through, artists who will become part of the permanent fabric of our musical culture: This year saw debut albums from Bruce Springsteen, Aerosmith, Queen and several others. Some we’d been introduced to in the past few years were now established superstars (David Bowie, Elton John).\n\nIn 1973, Kiss and AC/DC played their first concerts—if that isn’t a sign that the ’70s were going to be different, we don’t know what was!\n\nAnd, oh yeah, a band that had started out several years earlier in London with a psychedelic approach did some fine-tuning and cooked up an album called The Dark Side of the Moon. You may have heard of it.\n\nNew styles of music also began to assert themselves, including reggae and what would come to be called hip-hop, while genres such as prog, heavy metal/hard rock and Southern Rock were falling into place. Even the first stirrings of punk were present, as the New York Dolls and others stripped things down and channeled their power into short, fast, fun tunes. The singer-songwriter revolution, too, grew in popularity.\n\nFor this survey, we’ve turned back the clock 50 years and compiled a timeline of the year’s top events (including album releases) in rock and related music. Then we’ve listed the bands that formed during that year, and those that called it quits. Finally, we’ve compiled a list of the year’s top singles. Looking at it all now, we have to admit that we were all very lucky to have this music in our lives—and we still are!\n\nJan. 5—Aerosmith releases their self-titled debut album; on the same day, Bruce Springsteen releases his debut LP, Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.\n\nJan. 8—Yoko Ono releases Approximately Infinite Universe; the Beach Boys release Holland\n\nJan. 12—Deep Purple releases Who Do We Think We Are\n\nJan. 14–Elvis Presley’s Aloha From Hawaii Via Satellite television special is broadcast\n\nJan. 16—Gospel singer Clara Ward dies\n\nJan. 18—The Rolling Stones perform a benefit concert at the L.A.
